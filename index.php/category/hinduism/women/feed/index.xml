<p>Written by Sulaiman Razvi</p>
<p>Women in India has been suffering for ages. Hindu scriptures treat women as a commodity, and equates them to animals. Even a Brahmin woman is like a Shudra as per the Hindu scriptures. Hinduism deprives women of their basic rights. In Hinduism only the wife has to fast during Karvachauth but not the husband. The wife has to wear Mangulsutra and apply Sindoor to signify that ‘She is the property of others’ just like a board is set up in an open land stating it’s owner but the husband has no such thing to wear. If the girl is born in inauspicious months then she is termed as Manglik, and per this superstition the husband of such girl dies soon so she is made to marry a peepul tree or a dog. As per Hindu scripture the wife either has to lead a life of celibacy after the death of her husband or mount husband’s pyre on the other hand there is no such option for husbands. The husband is free to marry another wife after the death of his wife and can marry many wives even when the wife is alive. Only the son can light the funeral pyre of his parents while the daughter is barred from it. Hindu culture is a male dominated culture, women in Hindu society has been submissive while men are aggressive.</p>

<h1>Preference of son over daughter</h1>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-7139" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/https-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2015-06-wome-1.jpeg" alt="https://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/women-female-foeticide-fb_img_1483520239159.jpg?w=441&amp;h=307" width="305" height="212" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/https-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2015-06-wome-1.jpeg 441w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/07/https-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2015-06-wome-1-300x209.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 305px) 100vw, 305px" /></p>
<p>Leave aside giving equal rights to women, verses in Hindu scriptures that prays for the birth of a daughter are rare while there are several verses and especially dedicated hymns for the birth of a Son. As per Hindu text the son saves the father from the hell called Put hence he is called Putra (Son) while a daughter is Duhita i.e. one who does bad. Hindu scriptures has a ritual called Pumsavan Sanskar for the birth of a son. There are thousands of verses in Vedas but not even a single verse prays for the birth of a daughter. The Vedas rather say,</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 6.11.3 Prajāpati, Anumati, Sinivāli have ordered it. Elsewhere may he effect the birth of maids, but here prepare a boy.</p>
<p>It is mentioned in Grihya Sutras,</p>
<p>Sankhayana Grihya Surtra 1.19.6 …Pragapati has created him, Savitar has shaped him. Imparting birth of females to other (women) may he put here a man…</p>
<p>There are especial hymns and verses in Vedas which prays for the birth of a son like Atharva Veda 6.11; 3.23 and 7.48 and verses like Atharva Veda 14.1.22; 12.3.47; 2.36.3, 14.2.72, Rig Veda 3.31.1; 10.85.42-45 and so on but not even a single verse wishes for a daughter. As a result of these verses female infanticide is still in practice. India looses millions of unborn female baby every year,<br />

Krishna Yajur Veda also has reference about female infanticide in Vedic period where in Aryans used to abandon female girl,<br />
Krishna Yajur Veda 6.5.10.3 “…Therefore they deposit a daughter on birth, a son they lift up…”</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-7140" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/word-image-65.jpeg" width="285" height="387" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/word-image-65.jpeg 1108w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/07/word-image-65-221x300.jpeg 221w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/07/word-image-65-754x1024.jpeg 754w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/07/word-image-65-768x1042.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 285px) 100vw, 285px" /></p>
<p>Following is the reference about Kashyap Rishi recommending Pumsavan,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 6.18.54 Kaśyapa Muni continued: If you perform this ceremony called puṁsavana, adhering to the vow with faith for at least one year, you will give birth to a son destined to kill Indra. But if there is any discrepancy in the discharge of this vow, the son will be a friend to Indra.</p>
<p>Sankha Samhita 2.1 “On the full manifestation of the signs of pregnancy, the rite of Nisheka should be performed (an encicnte); the wise should perform the rite of Pumsavanam (rite for the causation of the birth of a male child) unto her, as soon as she would be quick with the child.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Garuda Purana goes a step ahead and says that the wife giving birth only to daughters should be abandoned,</p>
<p>Garuda Purana 1.115.64 ”A barren woman shall be abandoned in the eighth year after marriage; a woman whose children die in infancy shall be abandoned in the ninth year; a woman who gives birth only to daughters shall be abandoned in the eleventh year and a woman who speaks unpleasant words shall be abandoned immediately.” Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by Jagdish Lal Shastri</p>
<p>It is mentioned in Smritis that a wife who drinks liquor, who is barren, who hates her husband’s people and who bears only females should be superseded i.e., she must be replaced by another wife in polygamy and she must be abandoned in the sense that she is to be deprived of her rights as a wife.</p>
<p>Yajnavalkya Smriti verse 73 “The liquor drinker, the diseased, the cunning, the barren, the killer of wealth, the unpleasant spoken, who bears female children should be superseded, so also (one) who hates people.” Tr. Srisa Chandra Vasu</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 9.81 A barren wife may be superseded in the eighth year, she whose children (all) die in the tenth, she who bears only daughters in the eleventh, but she who is quarrelsome without delay.</p>
<p>Narada Smriti 12.94 Let not a husband show love to a barren woman, or to one who gives birth to female children only, or whose conduct is blamable, or who constantly contradicts him; if he does (have conjugal intercourse with her), he becomes liable to censure (himself).</p>
<p>It is mentioned Shatapath Brahmana that a wife who has no son is a discarded wife and possessed with destruction,</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana 5.3.1.13 And on the following day he goes to the house of a discarded (wife), and prepares a pap for Nirriti;–a discarded wife is one who has no son…hail!’ For a wife that is without a son, is possessed with Nirriti (destruction, calamity)…</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 2.6.36-48 ”…Once while he was listening to the religious discourses of the Munis, he heard unmistakeably the Munis telling that the man who is sonless can never go to the Heavens; so he must get a son somehow or other…” Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 1.4.15-27 There is no prospect in the after birth of the sonless; never, never will Heaven be his. Without son, there is none other who can be of help in the next world. Thus in the Dharma S’âstras, Manu and other Munis declare that the man who has sons goes to Heaven and the sonless one can never go to Heaven. The man possessing a son is entitled to the Heavenly pleasures can be vividly seen, rather than imagined. The man with son is freed from sins; this is the word of the Vedas…</p>
<p>Brahma Vaivarta Purana Ganesha Khanda 2.16-31 …The life of a woman who has no son, is useless…</p>
<p>Skanda Purana V.iii.103.121-140 “…A son saves the father from the Naraka called Put. So he is called Putra by the Self-born Lord himself. The house of a man without a son is a void…King Raghava (i.e. Dasaratha) convened an assembly of sages for the sake of (obtaining) a son since the seat of Indra occupied by him was purified by sprinkling water. Residence in Svarga is not (possible) without a son, O son of Pandu. Hence Dasaratha performed an excellent Yajna for the sake of sons. Rama, laksmana, Satrughna and Bharata were born to him…” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Himavat and Mena the parents of Parvati said,<br />
Skanda Purana I.i.20.60- “…For the accomplishment of the task of Devas a good daughter has to be begotten. It is for the benefits of Devas, sages and ascetics. (Of course) the birth of a daughter may not be pleasing to women. Still, O lady of splendid face, a daughter has to be procreated. Mena laughed and spoke to her husband Himalaya: ‘What has been spoken by you (is true). Let my words be heard by you now. O my lord, a daughter is the cause of misery unto men. So also, O highly intelligent one, she causes sorrow unto women. Hence ponder over this for a long time yourself with your keen intellect. Let what is conducive to our welfare to our welfare be told, o lord of Mountains.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>When highest authoritative text like Vedas and other scriptures like Puranas, Brahamanas doesn’t wish for daughter, we can conclude why female foeticide was prevalent in ancient India and still many Hindus prefer son over daughter. When asked, Hindus reply that they prefer son because it’s only the son that can perform certain rites like funeral rite of parents, the son looks after the parents in their old age etc.</p>
<p>Brahma Purana 113.75-76 “In the case of the people of all castes, a woman in her monthly course should be avoided for the first four nights. To prevent the birth of a female child, one shall avoid the fifth night also. Thereafter he shall carnally approach her on the sixth or other excellent nights even in number. Boys will be born (if intercourse is carried out) on even nights and girls on nights odd in number.” Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Garuda Purana I.178.27 “A woman desiring to beget a male child must drink ghee medicated with seeds of Matulunga and roots of Eranda.” Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 3.262-3 The (sacrificer’s) first wife, who is faithful and intent on the worship of the manes, may eat the middle-most cake, (if she be) desirous of bearing a son. (Thus) she will bring forth a son who will be long-lived, famous, intelligent, rich, the father of numerous offspring, endowed with (the quality of) goodness, and righteous.</p>
<p>Narada Purana 266-8 “The devotee shall worship at night, a jar filled with the boiling decotion of (the pieces of twigs) of a milk exuding tree and on the next day in the morning he shall repeat the mantra ten thousand times. For twelve days the woman should be bathed with that water. If this is performed, even a barren woman shall beget sons of longevity in life. The woman who is desirous of a son shall silently drink in the morning the water charged with the mantra in a leaf of the holy fig tree. The mantra should be repeated hundred and eight times. The procedure should be continued for a month. Even a barren woman will beget a son with all good makrs.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Skanda Purana III.i.15.47-51 “…There is a Tiirtha there, well-known in the worlds as Hanumatkunda. It suppresses all great miseries. It yields the benefit of heavenly pleasures and salvation. It subdues the suffering in hells (Narakas). It liberates (people) from poverty. It bestows sons on those who are sonless and wives on those who have no wives.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 6.81.3 The Amulet which Aditi wore when desirous of a son, Tvashtar hath bound upon this dame and said, Be mother of a boy.</p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.63.15 Vouchsafe us blessing in our paths and desert tracts, blessing in waters and in battle, for the light; Blessing upon the wombs that bring male children forth…<br />

<p>It is mentioned in Shastra,</p>
<p>Sankhayana Grihya Sutra 1.19.3-6 When he has finished, let him murmur, ‘Into thy breath I put the sperm, N.N.!’ Or, ‘As the earth is pregnant with Agni, as the heaven is with Indra pregnant, as Vayu dwells in the womb of the regions (of the earth), thus I place an embryo into thy womb, N.N.!’ Or, ‘May a male embryo enter thy womb, as an arrow the quiver; may a man be born here, a son after ten months. ‘Give birth to a male child; may after him (another) male be born; their mother shalt thou be, of the born, and (to others) mayst thou give birth…</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When there is already a male child then why wish for more male children? Dayanand Saraswati founder of Arya Samaj recommended Niyoga for procuring sons even when the couple had a daughter. Why so much discrimination against birth of daughters? Various other texts like Sankhayana Grihya Sutra 1.16.11; Narada Purana II.56.320-325; Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 6.4.20 also prays and gives instructions which secures the birth of a male child.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Purpose of creating women</h1>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="300" height="263" class="wp-image-7142" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/https-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2015-06-wome-2.jpeg" alt="https://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/women-status.jpg?w=300&amp;h=263" /></p>
<p>Brahma Vaivarata Purana 61.22-41 ”…There can be no creation without a woman. This is why at the command of Lord Krisna, Brahma created the woman to entice the heart of lustful people. The beauty of a woman is the seat of illusion, the bar or bolt (or obstacle) in the way of a man’s act or Karma, the impediment of meditation and the harbour of evil…” Tr. Rajendra Nath Sen</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 3.31.40 The woman, created by the Lord, is the representation of maya, and one who associates with such maya by accepting services must certainly know that this is the way of death, just like a blind well covered with grass.</p>
<p>Maya means illusion, deceit and fraud. Maharishi Manu writes that after creating women god allotted to them dishonesty malice, bad conduct etc.</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 9.17 (When creating them) Manu allotted to women (a love of their) bed, (of their) seat and (of) ornament, impure desires, wrath, dishonesty, malice, and bad conduct.</p>
<p>It is also mentioned in Mahabharata,</p>
<p>Mahabharata 13.40 The Sruti declares that women are endued with senses the most powerful, that they have no scriptures to follow, and that they are living lies. Beds and seats and ornaments and food and drink and the absence of all that is respectable and righteous, indulgence in disagreeable words, and love of sexual companionship,–these were bestowed by Brahman upon women.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As per Mahabharata, God created women to make men unrighteous,</p>
<p>Mahabharata 13.40 “Bhishma said, ‘It is even so as thou sayest, O thou of mighty arms. There is nothing untrue in all this that thou sayest, O thou of Kuru’s race, on the subject of women. In this connection I shall recite to thee the old history of how in days of yore the high-souled Vipula had succeeded in restraining women within the bounds laid down for them. I shall also tell thee, O king, how women were created by the Grandsire Brahman and the object for which they were created by Him. There is no creature more sinful, O son, than women. Woman is a blazing fire. She is the illusion, O king, that the Daitya Maya created. She is the sharp edge of the razor. She is poison. She is a snake. She is fire. She is, verily, all these united together. It has been heard by us that all persons of the human race are characterised by righteousness, and that they, in course of natural progress and improvement, attain to the status of deities. This circumstance alarmed the deities. They, therefore, O chastiser of foes, assembled together and repaired to the presence of the Grandsire. Informing Him of what was in their minds, they stood silent in his presence, with downcast eyes. The puissant Grand sire having ascertained what was in the hearts of the deities, created women, with the aid of an Atharvan rite. In a former creation, O son of Kunti, women were all virtuous. Those, however, that sprang from this creation by Brahman with the aid of an illusion became sinful. The grandsire bestowed upon them the desire of enjoyment, all kinds of carnal pleasure. Tempted by the desire of enjoyment, they began to pursue persons of the other sex. The puissant lord of the deities created Wrath as the companion of Lust. Persons of the male sex, yielding to the power of Lust and Wrath, sought the companionship of women. Women have no especial acts prescribed for them. Even this is the ordinance that was laid down. The Sruti declares that women are endued with senses the most powerful, that they have no scriptures to follow, and that they are living lies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Women are of sinful birth</h1>
<p>Krishna said,</p>
<p>Gita 9.32 ”For those who take refuge in Me. O Partha, though they be of sinful birth- women, Vaisyas, and Sudras even they attain the Supreme Goal.” Tr. Swami Nikhilananda</p>
<p>Mahabharata 14.19.61 By adhering to this religion, even they who axe of sinful birth, such as women and Vaisyas and Sudras, attain to the highest goal.</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 2.7.46 “Surrendered souls, even from groups leading sinful lives, such as women, the laborer class, the mountaineers and the Siberians, or even the birds and beasts, can also know about the science of Godhead and become liberated from the clutches of the illusory energy by surrendering unto the pure devotees of the Lord and by following in their footsteps in devotional service.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 7.7.54 “O my friends, O sons of demons, everyone, including you (the Yakṣas and Rākṣasas), the unintelligent women, śūdras and cowherd men, the birds, the lower animals and the sinful living entities, can revive his original, eternal spiritual life and exist forever simply by accepting the principles of bhakti-yoga.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Nature of women</h1>
<p>Manu Smriti 2.213-214 ”To defile men is the nature of women, hence the wise are never infatuated nor un-circumspect about them. Man, by nature, is subject to lust and anger; women are quite competent to lead even the wise men astray, not to speak of fools, (their easy victims).” Tr. M.N. Dutt<br />
Mahabharata 13.19 Women, in particular, the Rishis have said, are false in behaviour. When human beings are such, and when women in particular have been declared in the ordinances to be false, how, O sire, can there be a union between the sexes for purposes of practising all duties together? In the very Vedas one may read that women are false.</p>
<p>Lakshmana addresses Sita in the following way,</p>
<p>Valmiki Ramayana, Aranya Kanda, Sarga 45.29-30 ”Thou art a very Goddess unto me, I therefore dare not answer thee. What thou hast spoken, O Maithili, is nothing surprising for females. Such is the nature of womankind on this earth. Women by nature are crooked, fickle, devoid of religious knowledge, and bring about difference between father and sons.” Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 1.15.1-67…The fools do not understand how the women suck the blood out of persons like leeches, for they get themselves deluded by their gestures and postures! The lady of the house, whom the people call kântâ, the beautiful one, steal away the semen virile, the strength and energy in the way of giving them happiness as sexual intercourse, and their minds and wealth and everything by their crooked love conversations; so see what greater thief can there be than a woman? In my opinion, those that are ignorant are certainly deluded by the Creator; they accept wife to destroy their own pleasure of happiness. They can never understand that the women can never be the source of pleasure; they are the source of all miseries…</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Testimony of women not valid</h1>
<p>A women should give witness for women likewise a Shudra for Shudra, Dvija for Dvija but in some cases (in which witness given by anyone is allowed) women’s witness is not valid at all. It is mentioned in Manu Smriti,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 8.77 One man who is free from covetousness may be (accepted as) witness; but not even many pure women, because the understanding of females is apt to waver, nor even many other men, who are tainted with sin.<br />

<p>Chanakya Neeti Shastra 1.15 Do not put your trust in rivers, men who carry weapons, beasts with claws or horns, women and members of a royal family.</p>
<p>Katyayana Smriti verse 351 “Women should bear witness for women (when women are litigants)…” Tr. P.V. Kane</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Women are equivalent to dogs, pigs</h1>
<p>Manu Smriti 3.239. A Kandala, a village pig, a cock, a dog, a menstruating woman, and a eunuch must not look at the Brahmanas while they eat.</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 4.5.2 …Lull all the women, lull the dogs to sleep, with Indra as thy friend!<br />

<p>Shatpath Brahmana says that dog, Sudra and women are untruth,</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana 14.1.1.31. And whilst not coming into contact with Sûdras and remains of food; for this Gharma is he that shines yonder, and he is excellence, truth, and light; but woman, the Sûdra, the dog, and the black bird (the crow), are untruth: he should not look at these, lest he should mingle excellence and sin, light and darkness, truth and untruth.</p>
<p>Samvarta Samhita verses 181 “By being touched by a dog or by another woman in her menses, a woman in menses should fast for the remaining days [of the menstrual period] and get herself purified by drinking clarified butter after bathing [at the end of the menstrual period].” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Women in her Menses</strong></h2>
<p>Hindu text often compare woman in her menses to dogs and pigs, and such things are still in practice. A Hindu temple board decided that women should be allowed inside temple only after the machine detects that they are not in their menstrual periods,<br />
<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3332227/Hindu-temple-declares-allow-women-enter-scanning-machine-designed-check-going-menstruating.html" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3332227/Hindu-temple-declares-allow-women-enter-scanning-machine-designed-check-going-menstruating.html<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>Another humiliating thing is that when a woman barged into a temple for worship, the idol and temple were purified by cow urine,<br />

<p>Hinduism even says that a woman in her menses touching a Dvija must be lashed with whip,</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti 5.105 If a woman in her courses (touches a member of a twice-born person), she shall be lashed with a whip.</p>
<p>As its a tradition in Hinduism that anything can be purified with cow dung and urine, read the article <a href="/index.php/2014/01/05/importance-of-cow-dung-and-urine-in-hinduism/" data-wpel-link="internal">Importance of Cow dung and Urine in Hinduism</a>.</p>
<p>Garuda Purana ch 231 “A Brahmana having touched a dog, a Sudra, or any other beast, or a woman in her menses, before washing his face after a meal, shall regain his purity by fasting for a day, and by taking Panchgavyam.” Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Markandeya Purana 35.26-28 “…After touching a menstruous woman, a horse, a jackal, and other animals, or a woman recently delivered of a child, or people of low caste, one should bathe for the sake of purification…”</p>
<p>Brahma Purana 113.140-7 “…A person who is conversant with righteousness becomes purified by taking a bath if he touches these: a medicant who is not worthy of being fed (?), a heretic, a cat, an ass, cook, a fallen man, an outcaste (a person ostracised), a Candala and those who bear dead bodies, a country pig and a woman in her monthly course…” Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Kurma Purana II.17.26 “One shall avoid an article once smelt by a dog and cooked again. So also the article seen by a Candala, or a woman in her menses, or smelt by a cow, or seen by a fallen men, shall be avoided.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 4.208 Nor that at which the slayer of a learned Brahmana has looked, nor that which has been touched by a menstruating woman, nor that which has been pecked at by birds or touched by a dog,</p>

<h1>Women devoid of intellect</h1>
<p>Swami Prabhupada founder of ISKCON wrote,</p>
<p>“Here is a difference between male and female that exists even in the higher statuses of life — in fact, even between Lord Śiva and his wife. Lord Śiva could understand Citraketu very nicely, but Pārvatī could not. Thus even in the higher statuses of life there is a difference between the understanding of a male and that of a female. It may be clearly said that the understanding of a woman is always inferior to the understanding of a man. In the Western countries there is now agitation to the effect that man and woman should be considered equal, but from this verse it appears that woman is always less intelligent than man.”<strong> Swami Prabhupada on </strong><a href="https://vedabase.io/en/library/sb/6/17/34-35/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right"><strong>Srimad Bhagavatam 6.17.34-35</strong><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>He also said, “We are speaking of ordinary woman. Because Kṛṣṇa says, in another place, striyo vaiśyas tathā śūdraḥ [Bg. 9.32]. They are considered, women, vaiśya, the mercantile community, and śūdra, and the worker class, they are less intelligent.” <strong>Swami Prabhupada, Lectures Bhagavad-gītā 1.40 — London, July 28, 1973</strong><br />

<p>He also said,</p>
<p>”To understand Brahman is not the business of teeny brain. Alpa-medhasam (BG 7.23). There are two Sanskrit words: alpa-medhasa and su-medhasa. Alpa-medhasa means having little brain substance. Physiologically, within the brain there are brain substance. It is found that the brain substance in man is found up to sixty-four ounce. They are very highly intellectual persons. And in woman the brain substance is not found more than thirty-four ounce. You’ll find, therefore, that there is no very great scientist, mathematician, philosopher among women. You’ll never find, because their brain substance cannot go. Artificially do not try to become equal with men. That is not allowed in the Vedic śāstra. Na striyaṁ svatantratām arhati (Manu-saṁhitā). That is called śāstra.”- A.C.

<h1>Women should not be given freedom</h1>
<p>Hinduism says that woman is dependent and not fit for being independent, she is incapable of being independent. Swami Prabhupada the founder of ISKCON said that female must never be given independence, she must always be controlled and that women is not capable of being ruler.</p>
<p>“In India we have got little experience. The female is always controlled. Female is never given the position of controller. Nowadays it is going on. Just like Indira Gandhi, she has given the position of controller. This is artificial. In the history of India, greater India, Mahābhārata, you will never find that a woman has been given a position of controller. No. It is not possible. We have to take things from the śāstra. In the Bhagavad-gītā also woman&#8217;s position has been equated with śūdra. Striyaḥ śūdrās tathā vaiśyas te &#8216;pi yānti parāṁ gatim.” <b>Swami Prabhupada, Lectures <a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/classes/bg/1?d=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Bhagavad-gītā 1.21-22<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> — London, July 18, 1973</b></p>

<p>Narada Purana, Uttarabhaga 24.46-47a “O Brahmanas, the following fall into hell: viz.- a woman who behave according to her own sweet will…” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 5.147-148 By a girl, by a young woman, or even by an aged one, nothing must be done independently, even in her own house. In childhood a female must be subject to her father, in youth to her husband, when her lord is dead to her sons; a woman must never be independent.</p>
<p>Yajnavalkya Smriti verse 85 When a maiden, her father; when married her husband; and when old, her sons, should protect her. In their absence, the kinsmen (should take care of her.) The women are never independent.</p>
<p>Mahabharata 13.45 There is the well-known declaration of the scriptures that women are incompetent to enjoy freedom at any period of their life</p>
<p>Rishi Ashravakra said,</p>
<p>Mahabharata 13.20 “Ashtavakra said, ‘Women can never be their own mistresses. This is the opinion of the Creator himself, viz., that a woman never deserves to be independent”</p>

<p>Baudhayana Dharma Shastra 2.2.3.44-5 Women do not possess independence. Now they quote also (the following verse): ‘Their father protects (them) in childhood, their husband protect (them) in youth, and their sons protect (them) in old age; a woman is never fit for independence.’</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Swami Prabhupada writes,</p>
<p>”… woman is not supposed to take sannyāsa. So-called spiritual societies concocted in modern times give sannyāsa even to women, although there is no sanction in the Vedic literature for a woman’s accepting sannyāsa. Otherwise, if it were sanctioned, Kardama Muni could have taken his wife and given her sannyāsa. The woman must remain at home. She has only three stages of life: dependency on the father in childhood, dependency on the husband in youth and, in old age, dependency on the grown-up son, such as Kapila. In old age the progress of woman depends on the grown-up son.” A.C.

<p>Swami Prabhupada had approved wife beating,</p>
<p>“Prabhupāda: Dull, dull. Dhol guṇār, dhol means drum and guṇār means dull. Śūdra, and the laborer class. Three. Dhol, guṇār, śūdra, and paśu, household animals, just like cows, dogs.<br />
Brahmānanda: Pet.<br />
Prabhupāda: Pet, like that. Dhol guṇār śūdra paśu and narī. Nari means woman. (laughs) Just see. He has classified the narī amongst these class, dhol, guṇār, śūdra, paśu, narī. Ihe sab śaśan ke adhikārī. Sasan ke adhikārī means all these are subjected for punishment. And what about the guest?<br />
Govinda dāsī: Oh, the guest? It&#8217;s coming.<br />
Prabhupāda: So śaśan ke adhikārī means they should be punished. (laughs) Punished means, just like dhol, when the, I mean to say, sound is not very hard, dag-dag, if you beat it on the border, then it comes to be nice tune. Similarly, paśu, animals, if you request, &#8220;My dear dog, please do not go there.&#8221; Hut! (laughter) &#8220;No, my dear dog.&#8221; Hut! This is the way.(?) Similarly, woman. If you become lenient, then she will be troublesome. So in India still, in villages, whenever there is some quarrel between husband wife, the husband beats and she is tamed. (laughs) In civilized society, &#8220;Oh, you have done this?&#8221; Immediately some criminal case. But in uncivilized society they don&#8217;t care for court or civilized way of&#8230; Kicharī.

<p>Garuda Purana 1.109.31 ”Wicked persons, artisans, slaves, defiled ones, drums and women are softened by being beaten; they do not deserve gentle handling.” Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>It is mentioned in Tulsi Ramayana,</p>
<p>ढोल गवाँर सूद्र पसु नारी। सकल ताड़ना के अधिकारी।।३</p>
<p>Tulsi Ramayana, Sundar Kanda, Doha 58.3 A drum, a rustic, a Shudra, a beast and a woman all these deserve to be beaten up.</p>
<p>Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 6.4.7 “If she does not willingly yield her body to him, he should buy her with presents. If she is still unyielding, he should strike her with a stick or with his hand and overcome her, repeating the following mantra: “With power and glory I take away your glory.” Thus she becomes discredited.” Tr. Swami Nikhilananda</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 8.299-300 A wife, a son, a slave, a pupil, and a (younger) brother of the full blood, who have committed faults, may be beaten with a rope or a split bamboo, But on the back part of the body (only), never on a noble part; he who strikes them otherwise will incur the same guilt as a thief.</p>
<p>But a wife cannot beat her husband,</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Rudra Samhita 2, Parvatikhanda section III, 54.53-55 “If she desires to beat her husband in retaliation, she becomes a tiger or a wild cat. She who ogles at another man becomes squint eyed. She who partakes of sweet dish denying the same to her husband becomes a pig in the village or a wild goat eating its own dung. She who addresses her husband in a singular becomes dumb. She who is jealous of a cow-wife becomes ill-fated in matrimony again and again.” Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>

<h1>Barred from studying Vedas, to perform sacrifice and to worship</h1>
<p>Before teaching Veda to students, a ceremony is to be performed called Upanayana. After this ceremony the Dvija students are made to wear sacred thread. You may have seen Brahmins wearing this thread but have you ever heard of women wearing this thread? It’s because women are not allowed to study the Vedas. And as per Hindu scripture people who have gone through Upanayana ceremony alone are eligible to read the Vedas. It is mentioned in Agni Purana,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Agni Purana 152.9-12 ”…The women are not entitled to utter the Veda Mantras, and hence they are not invested with the holy threads, but their marriage ceremonies should be celebrated by repeating the sacred hymns of the Vedas.” Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 154.156-74 ”Women are by their nature meek and weak, women cannot study the Sastras.” Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>Swami Prabhupada the founder of ISKCON said in one of his lectures,</p>
<p>“So dealing with woman&#8230; Especially instruction are given to men. All literatures, all Vedic literatures, they are especially meant for instruction to the men. Woman is to follow the husband, that&#8217;s all. The husband will give instruction to the wife. There is no such thing as the girl should go to school to take <em>brahmacārī-āśrama</em> or go to spiritual master to take instruction. That is not Vedic system. Vedic system is a man is fully instructed, and woman, girl, must be married to a man. Even the man may have many wives, polygamy, still, every woman should be married. And she would get instruction from the husband. This is Vedic system. Woman is not allowed to go to school, college or to the spiritual master. But husband and wife, they can be initiated. That is Vedic system.” Swami Prabhupada, Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam 1.3.13, Sept. 18, 1972 — Los Angeles<br />

<p>It is mentioned in Bhagvad Purana that, Ved Vyasa composed Mahabharata out of compassion for women and Shudras as women and Shudras are barred from the study of Vedas,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 1.4.25 ”The degenerated twice-borns, the Sudras and women are barred from the holy truths of the Vedas, and, out of compassion for them, Maharshi Vyasa composed the Mahabharata.” Tr. J.M. Sanyal</p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 1.3.18-24 “…knowing this in every Dvâpara Yuga Bhagavân expounds the holy Purâna Samhitas. The more so because women, S’udras, and the lower Dvijas are not entitled to hear the Vedas; for their good, the Purânas have been composed…” Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Brahma Purana 64.19 ”In regard to the people of the first three castes the rite of holy bath and the reception of Mantras is in the manner mentioned in the Vedas. The utterance of the Vedic passage is to be avoided by women as well as Sudras.” Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Women are not even allowed to utter Om and Vedic Japas,</p>
<p>Narada Purana, Uttarabhaga 61.51-53 “The procedure for the holy dip and the repetition of Japas is, in regard to the three castes, the same as mentioned in the Vedas. O fair lady, in regard to the Sudras and the women the repetition of the Vedic texts is to be avoided…” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Narada Purana III.70.72-73 “This is called Visnu Gayatri which removes all sins. Tara=om., hrt=namah, then bhagavan ending in the dative case, then vausdevaya. This great mantra consisting of twelve syllables gives enjoyment and salvation. This is to be used without tara=om by women and sudras but by the twice born it is used with tara=om.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Skanda Purana V.iii.228.9 “The following six things cause downfall of women and Sudras: japa, penance, pilgrimage, renunciation of the world, practice of Mantras and initiation for the adoration of a deity” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Maharishi Manu writes that marriage for a woman is equivalent to study of Vedas, which means they should not study it,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 2.66 This whole series (of ceremonies) must be performed for females (also), in order to sanctify the body, at the proper time and in the proper order, but without (the recitation of) sacred texts.</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti 27.13-14 For female children the same ceremonies, (beginning with the birth ceremony, should be performed, but) without Mantras. The marriage ceremony only has to be performed with Mantras for them.</p>
<p>Hindu scripture even punishes people in hell for reading Vedas in presence of women and Shudras,</p>
<p>Narada Purana I.15.100-1 “I shall mention the fruits of sins accruing to those who engage themselves in the recitation and study of the Vedas in the vicinity of women and Sudras. Listen to it attentively. They are compelled to stand with their heads down and legs upwards. Thus, they are nailed to two pillars and are compelled to inhale smoke continuously in this posture. They stay thus for the period of year of god Brahma.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 2.67 ”The sacrament of marriage is to a female, what initiation with the thread is to a male. The service of the husband is to the wife, what his residence in the preceptor’s house, as a religious student, is to the husband; the household duty is to a woman, what the making of burnt offerings is to man.” Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Below is Buhler’s translation,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 2.67 The nuptial ceremony is stated to be the Vedic sacrament for women (and to be equal to the initiation), serving the husband (equivalent to) the residence in (the house of the) teacher, and the household duties (the same) as the (daily) worship of the sacred fire.</p>
<p>Maharishi Manu clearly writes,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 9.18 For women no (sacramental) rite (is performed) with sacred texts [Vedic Mantras], thus the law is settled; women (who are) destitute of strength and destitute of (the knowledge of) Vedic texts, (are as impure as) falsehood (itself), that is a fixed rule.<br />

<p>Mahabharata 3.204 [Markandeya Rishi said] As regards women again, neither sacrifice nor sraddhas, nor fasts are of any efficacy. By serving their husbands only they can win heaven.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is mentioned in Linga Purana that women are not authorized to perform worship [i.e. to lead prayers/sacrifices],</p>
<p>Linga Purana Section II 20.1-3 ”Rudra, Mahadeva, the grandfather stationed in the mystic diagram is worthy of being worshipped by the Brahmins, Ksatriyas and Vaisyas as well. For the Sudras the service rendered to a worshipper is enough. Undoubtedly women are not authorised to perform worship. If the worship is conducted through leading Brahmins, women and Sudras shall derive the same benefit.” Tr. Board of Scholars, Edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Padma Purana V.20.23-27 “A woman should never worship a salagrama. If a woman who is a widow or whose husband is alive, who desires her well-being in heaven, touches through ignorance a salagrama, she would, even though she is endowed with good character and virtues, be deprived of her collection of religious merit and would quickly go to hell…” Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti 25.15 No sacrifice, no penance, and no fasting is allowed to women apart from their husbands; to pay obedience to her lord is the only means for a woman to obtain bliss in heaven.</p>
<p>Some apologists put forth their arguments that many verses of Vedas were revealed to Rishika (female Rishi) so there is no prohibition for women from studying the Vedas.</p>
<p>What apologists do is they quote some particular incidents out of context and try to interpret it in their own way. Vedas even have verses spoken by a prostitute, the Rishika of some verses is a prostitute, it doesn’t mean that common women should also be engaged in prostitution. As you may know the Rishika of Rig Veda Mandal 10 Sukt 95 is Urvashi. Urvashi was a Apsara (Nirukta 5.13) and Swami Prabhupada writes that ”Urvaśī, a prostitute of the heavenly kingdom”,</p>
<p>”Mitra and Varuṇa chanced to meet Urvaśī, the most beautiful prostitute of the heavenly kingdom, and they became lusty…” A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada on Srimad Bhagavatam 9.13.6 <a href="http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_9.13.6" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_9.13.6<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>It is mentioned in Devi Bhagavatam,</p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 9.1.96-143 “…those that are sprung from Tamo Guna are recognised as worst and belonging to the unknown families. They are very scurrilous, cheats, ruining their families, fond of their own free ways, quarrelsome and no seconds are found equal to them. Such women become prostitutes in this world and Apsaras in the Heavens…” Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is one of the old trick of Hindu apologists. They quote verses praising goddesses and present it as Vedas praising common women. Hindu apologists should provide reference showing that common women can also study the Vedas. Some people may argue that Urvashi was not a prostitute but they can never deny the fact that Urvashi was an adulteress. When trying to show equality among castes in Hinduism, Apologists often say that ‘Vasistha was born of a prostitute but became a Rishi‘, He was born out of the mind of Urvashi the prostitute but not born from her womb. So apologists changes their stand to suit their vested interest. Renowned Hindu scholar Madhvacharya writes,</p>
<p>“…Those of the first three castes who are sincerely devoted to the Lord Hari (the purifier) are fit to acquire knowledge as given in the Vedic texts. And the women (of the celestial order) are also eligible for the study of Scripture; and they are Urvasi, Yami (the wife of Yama), Sachi and other goddesses, (as also the wives of Rishis)…” <strong>Madhvacharya on Brahma Sutra Pada 1, Adhyaya 1.1, Tr. S. Subba Rau</strong></p>
<p>Madhvacharya affirmed my statement that study of Veda for women is limited to special women like Urvashi, Yami, Sachi etc. which means that common women cannot study Vedas. Krishna says in Gita,</p>
<p>Gita 9.32 ”For those who take refuge in Me. O Partha, though they be of sinful birth- women, Vaisyas, and Sudras even they attain the Supreme Goal.” Tr. Swami Nikhilananda</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hindu scholar named Swami Swarupananda writes,</p>
<p>”Of inferior birth…Shudras because by birth, the Vaishyas are engaged only in agriculture, etc., and the women and Shudras are debarred from the study of the Vedas.”</p>
[Swami Swarupananda on Bhagwad Gita 9.32, page 216, Advaita Ashrama, Published by Swami Chidatmananda, President, Advaita Ashrama, Mayavati, Almora, Himalayas] also available online at <a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/sbg/sbg14.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/sbg/sbg14.htm<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Swami Nikhilananda writes,</p>
<p>”The Vaisyas are engaged in agriculture and trade; women and Sudras are debarred from the study of the Vedas. Therefore all these classes of people remain outside the Vedic scheme of salvation…” [Swami Nikhilananda on The Bhagwad Gita 9.32, page 233, Ramakrishna-Vivekananda Center, 1944, Printed in USA by The Haddon Craftsmen, Inc.]

<p>Another scholar named Swami Sivananda writes,</p>
<p>“…Women and Sudras are debarred by social rules from the study of the Vedas…”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Women are like Shudras</h1>
<p>Women belonging to upper three castes are not Shudras but are treated like Shudras. They are considered to be on the same level as the Shudra. Hindu text often mention Shudra on par with Women,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 5.139. Let him who desires bodily purity first sip water three times, and then twice wipe his mouth; but a woman and a Sudra (shall perform each act) once (only).</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 11.153. But he who has eaten the food of men, whose food must not be eaten, or the leavings of women and Sudras, or forbidden flesh, shall drink barley (-gruel) during seven (days and) nights.</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana 2.3.15.56 ”The leavings of food from a Sraddha should not be given to women or Sudras.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mahabharata 13.128 That man who thinks it all right when a Sudra ignites the fire upon which he is to pour libations or who does not see any fault when women who are incompetent to assist at Sraddhas and other rites are allowed to assist at them, really becomes stained with sin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Manu also states that during the period of a vow it is not proper on any account to talk to a woman, a Sudra and an outcaste,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 11.224. Let him bathe three times each day and thrice each night, dressed in his clothes; let him on no account talk to women, Sudras, and outcasts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Duty of a Wife</h1>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 6.18.7-24 ”…The eternal Dharma of women is to serve their husbands; whether the husband be a saint or a sinner, the woman, desirous of her welfare, should serve her husband in every way…”</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 5.155-6 No sacrifice, no vow, no fast must be performed by women apart (from their husbands); if a wife obeys her husband, she will for that (reason alone) be exalted in heaven. Afaithful wife, who desires to dwell (after death) with her husband, must never do anything that might displease him who took her hand, whether he be alive or dead.<br />

<p>Baudhayana Dharma Shastra 2.2.3.47 Those (women) who strive (to do what is) agreeable to their husbands will gain heaven.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Garuda Purana 1.95.24-26 ‘‘The highest duty of a woman is to carry out the behests of her husband. Sixteen nights subsequent to the month menstrual flow are the nights of rut for women. The husband shall restrain himself during the parvan (full moon and new moon days), when the stars Magha and Mula are ascendant and on the first four nights. Thereafter, on even nights, he will be able to beget a healthy son of auspicious traits. If the woman is in a mood to receive him on any night he should satisfy her remembering that lust in women is terrible.” Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 3.19.11 ”The women are able to attain heaven and emancipation, if they serve their husbands…” Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mahabharata 13.59 As women have one eternal duty, in this world, viz., dependence upon and obedient service to their husbands, and as such duty constitutes their only end, even so is the service to Brahmanas Our eternal duty and end.</p>
<p>Narada Purana I.14.17 “If, out of wickedness, a woman does not render physical service to her husband, she must be punished by abandoning her for twelve years, without giving her financial assistance.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Hinduism also says that a wife should stick to husband even if the husband is foolish, devoid of qualities, beats her, is impotent etc.,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 5.154 Though destitute of virtue, or seeking pleasure (elsewhere), or devoid of good qualities, (yet) a husband must be constantly worshipped as a god by a faithful wife</p>
<p>Skanda Purana II.iv.4.74 “Even if the husband is poor, fallen, foolish or wretched, he is the refuge unto his wife. By abandoning him a woman falls into hell.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Skanda Purana III.ii.7.15-44 “…The duties of chaste women have been enumerated by Sage Vyasa. She takes food after the husband has taken food; when he stands, she stands up together. She goes to bed after he has gone to sleep, and gets up before him…She does not speak out the name of her husband in order to give him long life. She never mentions the name of another man too. Even when dragged by him, she does not cry aloud. Even if she is beaten by him, she continues to be gracious. When he says, ‘Do this’, she reples, ‘My lord, be assured that it is done.’ When she is called, she leaves off the work on hand and goes to him quickly (and says) ‘Wherefore, O lord have I been called? Be pleased to tell me that…She partakes of the leavings of her husband’s food, fruit etc. liked by him. She completely avoids watching community festivals etc. (if he is not accompanying her). She should not exhibit bold wilfulness in anything except during sexual dalliance. She should always express her interest and delight whenever her husband shows his interest. She should never transgress the words of her husband… She should never stray from her husband even if he is impotent, miserably placed, sickly, senile, infirm or unsteady…If a woman transgresses the injunction of her husband and performs holy rites, fasts and other observances, she takes away the longetivity of her husband. After her death, she falls into a hell. A hot-tempered woman who, when addressed, gives rude reply, is reborn as a bitch in a village or as a vixen in a desolate forest. This is said to be the greatest and only sacred observance of women that they should resolve to take their food only after worshipping the feet of their husbands. (A chaste woman) should not occupy a seat higher (than that of her husband)…On being struck, if she were to strike him back, she is reborn as a tigress or a cat…She who sets aside her husband and partakes of sweet dishes alone, is reborn in a village as a female pig or a bat feeding on faeces.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>This is how women are punished if they don’t obey their husbands and uses harsh words against them,</p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 9.35.1-44 “If any woman, being very furious with anger, chastises and uses harsh words to her husband, she goes to Ulkâmukha Kunda for as many years as there are hairs on his body. My servants put fiery meteors or torches in her mouth and beat on her head. At the end of the term, she becomes a human being but she has to bear the torments of widowhood for seven births. Then she is again born as diseased; when at last she gets herself freed. The Brâhmana woman, enjoyed by a S’ûdra, goes to the terrible dark Andhakûpa hell, where she remains, day and night, immersed in the impure water and eats that for fourteen Indra’s life periods. Her pains are unbounded and My messengers beat her severely and incessantly.” Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Women are sex maniac</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Skanda Purana VII.I.101.28 “On seeing an excellent man, the excellent organ of generation of women becomes moistened and dump even if they are observing celibacy or are Yoginis.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Skanda Purana V.iii.121.7-9 ”Ordinarily sexual appetite is very strong in women. Especially during menses, they are afflicted all the more by the arrows of Kama. Shunned or neglected by their husbands, women naturally think about paramours.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mahabharata 13.19 Verily, women are exceedingly fond of sexual congress. Among a thousand women, or, perhaps, among hundreds of thousands, sometimes only one may be found that is devoted to her husband. When under the influence of desire, they care not for family or father or mother or brother or husband or sons or husband’s brother (but pursue the way that desire points out). Verily, in pursuit of what they consider happiness, they destroy the family (to which they belong by birth or marriage) even as many queenly rivers eat away the banks that contain them. The Creator himself had said this, quickly marking the faults of women.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chanakya Neeti Shastra 16.2 The heart of a woman is not united; it is divided. While she is taking with one man, she looks lustfully at another and thinks fondly of a third in her heart.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Padma Purana II.53.11b-20 …O lord of gods, the vulva, and also the tips of the breasts of women, throb. They do not have patience…</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, UmaSamhita 5.24.16-36 ”There is none more sinning and more sinful than women. Women are at the root of all sins…Women usually do not observe the limitations of conventional decency. If at all they stand by them with their husbands it is because no man makes advances to them or because they are afraid of their husbands…They carry on their dalliances with any man ugly or beautiful…Even women of noble families aspire for the life of lascivious women who in their prime of youth adorned with lovable ornaments and beautiful wearing garments move about frivolously…Women become desperate when they do not get men…women are not satiated with the number of men they cohabit with. O excellent sage, there is another secret of all women that immediately on seeing a man their vaginal passage begins to exude slimy secretions. On seeing a man fresh and clean from his bath with his body perfumed with sweet scents, the vaginal passage of women begins to exude like water dripping from a leather bag…on hearing her words Narada was satisfied in his mind. Considering it to be the truth. Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Garuda Purana 1.109.35-40 ”A delicious fatty meat diet, pleasing dress, glowing wine, fragrant scented pastes, and sweet smelling flowers kindle passion in women. It can be said with certainty that even during the period of celibacy the god of love is busily active. On seeing a man pleasing to her heart the vagina of a woman becomes wet with profuse secretion. O Saunaka, it is true, definitely true that the vaginal passage of a woman begins to secrete profusely on seeing a well dressed man whether a brother or a son. Rivers and women are of similar nature in their love of freedom to choose their own course. The rivers erode the banks and the women undermine their own families. The river undermines the banks and the woman causes the fall of the family. The course of rivers and women is wayward and cannot be checked. A blazing fire cannot be satiated with sufficient supply of fuel; the ocean can never be filled to satiety by rivers flowing into it; the god of death is never satiated by the living beings (whom he smites) and a passionate woman is never satiated with man.” Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Can’t choose husband</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 6.22.31-36 “…The girl must accept him to whom the father betrothes. The girl is under every circumstances dependent. Never do they get any independence…” Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 5.151 Him to whom her father may give her, or her brother with the father’s permission, she shall obey as long as he lives, and when he is dead, she must not insult (his memory)<br />

<p>Hinduism gives a list of girls that must be avoided for marriage but there is no mention of how a girl should choose her husband,</p>
<p>Narada Purana I.26.3-14 “A twice-born should marry a virgin who is endowed with good features and beauty, who is born of a good family, who possesses good qualities, whose conduct and habits are good and who practises righteous activities. The intelligent Brahmana should marry a girl beyond the seventh remove his father and fifth remove from his mother; otherwise he is on a par with the defiler of the preceptor’s bed. A sensible man should not marry a girl who is sickly, whose eyes are round, who is born in a family of ailing persons (i.e. with unhealthy heredity), who has too much of hair or who has no hair at all or who is garrulous. A wise person should not marry a girl who is hot-tempered, too short, too tall (in stature), who is wanting in any limb, who has an extra limb (i.e. physically handicapped or abnormal), who is mad, or slanderous. One should not marry a girl with heavy, big ankles or long shanks or has masculine features with traces of moustache and beard and is hunchbacked. A prudent person should not marry a girl who laughs without reason, who stays in others’ houses always, is habitually contentious, wayward and ruthless. A sensible man should not marry a voracious girl whose teeth and lips are too large and thick, who snorts and grumbles, who is very dark or red in complexion, or who is cunning and mischievous. One should not marry a girl who is always given to weeping, is of pallid complexion, who is despicable, a chronic patient of cough and Asthma or of somnolent nature. A sagacious man should not marry a girl who habitually speaks worthless and meaningless words who is interested in antagonizing the world, who is in the habit of scandalising others or is a thief. A worldly-wise man should by no means marry a girl whose nose is too long, who is a liar, and a cheat, whose body is covered with hair, who is arrogant or a religious hypocrite. If the marriage had taken place during childhood when the real nature had not been realised and if her defect is realized after maturity, he should by all means forsake her. If any woman is always harsh and ruthless to the husband and children but is favourably disposed towards others, he (the husband) should by all means forsake her.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Manu and Swami Dayanand Saraswati had similar views,</p>
<p>“Let a man never marry one who is pale and anaemic, nor one who is altogether a bigger and stronger person than himself or has a redundant member,* nor one who is an invalid, nor one either with no hair or too much hair or too much hair,** nor one immoderately talkative, nor one with red*** eyes.” MANU 3: 8.<br />
“Nor one with the name of star,* of a tree,** or of a river,*** or of a mountain,**** nor one bearing a name denoting low origin,^ or servility,^^ nor one named after a bird,+ , a snake, ++ nor one whose name inspires terror.” MANU 3: 9. These names are despicable and belong to other things as well.+++<br />
“Let him choose for his wife, a girl who has a graceful figure without any deformity, who has a pretty name, who walks gracefully like a swan or an elephant, who has fine hair and lovely teeth, and whose body is exquisitely soft.” MANU 3: 10.” <strong>Satyarth Prakash, Ch 4, p.89-90, by Swami Dayanand Saraswati, Tr. Dr. Chiranjiva Bhardwaja</strong></p>

<h1>Derogatory remarks against women</h1>
<p>Krishna said,</p>
<p>Varaha Purana 177.17-22 “Looking at Narada, Krsna bent down his face in shame. He then told Narada in detail about the nature of women and their conduct leading to sin. ‘They have no consideration of time, of secrecy of what they do. Still they pass to be virtous. Women irrespective of their age, whether they be girls, teenagers, middle-aged or advanced in age, get their passion excited at the sight of a handsome man. O great sage, this is natural to them.” Tr. Venkitasubramonia Iyer, J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 1.5.83 ”Falsehood, vain boldness, craftiness, stupidity, impatience, over-greediness, impurity, and harshness are the natural qualities of women.” Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Garuda Purana 1.109.33-34 ”The diet of a woman is twice as much as that of a man; shrewdness four times, energy is six times and amorousness is eight times as much as that of a man. It is impossible to overcome sleep by sleeping it off; to overpower a woman by loving her; to smother a flame by adding fuel and to quench thirst by drinking wine.” Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Chanakya Neeti Shastra 1.17 Women have hunger two fold, shyness four fold, daring six fold, and lust eight fold as compared to men.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Brahma Khanda 23.14-39 ”…The heart of women is keen like the edge of a razor…Immodesty and daring characterise their conduct, and their deeds are tainted with defect and hypocrisy. O Lord of the universe the lust of a woman is eight times as great; hunger twice as great and cruelty, four times as great as the lust, hunger and cruelty of a man…” Tr. Rajendra Nath Sen</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Manu 7.150 (Such) despicable (persons), likewise animals, and particularly women betray secret council; for that reason he must be careful with respect to them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana 3:2:4:6 “…Wherefore even to this day women are given to vain things: for it was on this wise that Vâk turned thereto, and other women do as she did. And hence it is to him who dances and sings that they most readily take a fancy.” Tr. Julius Eggeling</p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.95.15 Nay, do not die, Pururavas, nor vanish: let not the hideous wolves devour thee. Female friendships do not exist. With women there can be no lasting friendship: hearts of hyenas are the hearts of women.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bhagawad Purana 9.14.36-38 “Urvasi said: My dear King, you are a man, a hero. Don’t be impatient and give up your life. Be sober and don’t allow the senses to overcome you like foxes. Don’t let the foxes eat you. In other words, you should not be controlled by your senses. Rather, you should know that the heart of a woman is like that of a fox. There is no use making friendship with women. <strong>Women as a class</strong><br />
<strong>are merciless and cunning.</strong> They cannot tolerate even a slight offense. For their own pleasure they can do anything irreligious, and therefore they do not fear killing even a faithful husband or brother. Women are very easily seduced by men. Therefore, polluted women give up the friendship of a man who is their well-wisher and establish false friendship among fools. Indeed, they seek newer and newer friends, one after another.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Garuda Purana 1.115.59 ”The prosperity of a kingdom comes to an end with the curse of a brahmana; the spiritual power of a brahmana comes to an end with his sin; all decency in conduct of life comes to an end if residence is taken near cowsheds; the family is ruined if women rule.” Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chanakya Neeti Shastra 12.18 Courtesy should be learned from princes, the art of conversation from pandits, lying should be learned from gamblers and deceitful ways should be learned from women.</p>
<p>Chanakya Niti Shastra 2.1 Untruthfulness, rashness, guile, stupidity, avarice, uncleanliness and cruelty are women’s seven natural flaws.</p>
<p>Hinduism also views barren women and widows as degraded women,</p>
<p>Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Prakriti Khanda 29.42-53 “…Whoever eats food offered by a childless widow or a woman in her menses dwells in the pit of red hot iron for a century. Afterwards born by turns</p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 9.33.20-50 “…He who takes the food of a childless widow and the same of any woman that has just bathed after menstruation goes for one hundred years to the hot Lauha Kunda (where iron is in a molten condition). For seven births he becomes then a crow and for seven births he becomes born of a washerwoman, full of sores and boils, and poor. Then he gets purified.” Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Vishnu Samhita 65.33-35 “Having seen an insane, intoxicated or deformed person he shall turn back in his journey…Similarly, having seen persons clad in Kashaya (yellow-tinged) or dirty clothes as well as Kapilas, barren women, eunuchs, haunch-backed persons one shall refrain from starting on a journey.” Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Apastamba Samhita 9.24 “Boiled rice should not be partaken of in the house of a barren woman. He, who unknowingly eats at such a house, is consigned to the hell of Puyasam, after death.” Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Agni Purana chapter 230 “…A pregnant woman, a widow, drugs such as the Pinyaka, etc., a Chandala, a member of the Shvapacha or any other vile caste, a butcher, or a killer of birds, should be removed from the presence of a man, about to start a journey…” Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Hinduism says that whores becomes widows and barren in next life,<br />
Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Krishna Janma Khanda 85.105-116 “…A whore after having suffered the torments of hell called Raurava for a long time attains the form of a useless worm for a century and by turns for seven birth she attain the condition of a widow, a barren woman, an untouchable woman of low class and a woman with her nose cut…” Tr. Rajendra Nath Sen</p>
<p>Hinduism even says that one should avoid the sight of a widow, a barren woman and equates them to bastard, theives etc,<br />
Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Krishna Janma Khanda 78.33-41 “O father, now I am going to describe to you things whose sight is sinful. Bad dream is the root of sin and sole cause of calamity. The sight of the following…the cook of a S’udra, one who burns the corpse of a S’udra, a Brahmin who eats food prepared in connexion with the funerals of a S’udra…a S’udra, a widow, a Candal…a bastard, a thief, a liar…a Brahmin who is the husband of a barren woman, a S’udra who commits adultery with a Brahmin woman…” Tr. Rajendra Nath Sen</p>
<p>Hinduism also equates whores to childless widows and prohibits eating their food,<br />
Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Krishna Janma Khanda 85.53-61 “…O lord of the Vraja, a Brahmin who accidently uses food offered by a woman in her menses, a whore, or a childless widow undoubtedly consumes odour. He always leads an impure life as long as he lives…” Tr. Rajendra Nath Sen</p>
<p>Skanda Purana III.ii.7.50-52 “A widow is more inauspicious than all inauspicious things. Never can there be accomplishment of anything when a widow is sighted. All widows except one’s mother are devoid of auspiciousness. A wise man must avoid their blessings, like serpents. At the time of the marriage of a girl, the Brahmanas shall recite thus: ‘She shall be the constant companion of her husband whether he is alive or not.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Following verses from Padma Purana states that a person must avoid the food of women having no children and especially the food of a widow who is remarried</p>
<p>Padma Purana III.56.4-15 “…(He should avoid) the food of women having no children…(He should) especially (avoid) the food of a widow who is remarried, so also of the husband of a woman who is married twice…” Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p>Following verses shows how a widow should lead her life, it also talks about tonsuring widows,</p>
<p>Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Krishna Janma Khanda 83.92-124 “A Brahmin widow should daily take boiled rice with ghee at sunset and never cherish lust in her heart as the S’astras hold. Such a widow must not put on fine clothes; she should avoid the use of spices, incense, oil, wreath, sandal, conch-shell, vermillion and ornaments. She should put on dirty clothes and remember Narayana alone. She should not use sweet-meat and must avoid riches (or splendour)….A widow sleeping on a bedstead causes the downfall of her husband; and if she mounts a car, she goes to hell. A widow ought not to polish her hair or cleanse her body. And if the clusters of her hair be knotted, she may shave them off even in places not meant for pilgrimage. A widow should not anoint her body with oil. She should not see her face in the looking-glass or behold the face of any other man. She should not witness an opera, dance, a grand festival or see the face of a dancer, a singer or a well-dressed man. She should always listen to pious narratives as recited in the Sama Veda…” Tr. Rajendra Nath Sen</p>
<p>Skanda Purana II.v.11.36 “A kingdom without Vaisnavas is like a widow with tresses of hair not removed or like Vrata (without taking) holy bath or like Dvadasi with Dasami overlapping it.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Skanda Purana III.ii.7. 67-68 “A widow who habitually lies on a couch causes the downfall of her husband. Hence she should resort to the habit of lying on the ground, if she desires for the ultimate happiness of her husband. Cleansing of the body with fragrant unguents should never be indulged in by a widow. She would never make use of sweet scents.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Baudhyana Dharma Sutra 2.2.4.7-9 A widow shall avoid during a year (the use of) honey, meat spirituous liquor, and salt, and sleep on the ground. Maudgalya (declares that she shall do so) during six months.</p>

<h1>How to determine the nature of a woman</h1>
<p>Wondering how to find if a woman is a whore, adulteress or murderer of her husband? Need not worry, Garuda Purana has a list that can describe her nature. I am using translation of Board of Scholars edited by J.L. Shastri,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Garuda Purana 1.65.112 If the palm is placed on the ground and the little finger and the ring finger do not touch the ground, she is surely a whore.</p>
<p>Garuda Purana1.65.115 stout neck: she becomes very fierce. Squint in the eyes, dark blue or tawny in the eyes, roving eyes: absence of chastity</p>
<p>Garuda Purana 1.65.116 If when she smiles two dimples are seen in the cheeks, she is surely one adulteress.</p>
<p>Garuda Purana 1.65.117 …if the buttocks hang down, she kills her husband. A mustache-like growth of hair above the upper lip is inauspicious for the husband.</p>
<p>Garuda Purana 1.65.118 Hairy breasts are inauspicious and uneven ears too are inauspicious.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Proud wife should be punished</h1>
<p>Matsya Purana 225.132 ”The woman who is disobedient to her husband on account of being proud of her brothers, etc., should be driven out of the house by the king.” Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, Edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Manu 8.371 If a wife, proud of the greatness of her relatives or (her own) excellence, violates the duty which she owes to her lord, the king shall cause her to be devoured by dogs in a place frequented by many.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Widow burning</h1>
<p>Garuda Purana 10.42 “When a woman burns her body with her husband’s, the fire burns her limbs only, but does not afflict her soul” Tr. Ernest Wood and S.V Subrahmanyam, Edited by B.D. Basu.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brahma Purana 10.75 “Dying Immediately after the husband is the greatest duty of women. This is the path laid down in the Vedas. [77] The woman who follows her husband shall stay in heaven for as many years as there are hairs in a man’s body, viz. three and a half crores of years.” Tr. Board of Scholars, Edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parasara Smriti 4.28 “A widow, who immolates herself on the same funeral pile with her deceased husband, resides in heaven for ten millions of years, which is the number of hairs on the human body.” Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>

<p>Even a animal like cow is given more importance and respect in Hinduism than women. Women are treated like a commodity. Hinduism has deprived women of their basic rights. It confines them to four walls of the house. Women in Hinduism is nothing but a child production factory and sex object. I have not added many verses in this article because other articles already deals with it.</p>

<p>Sati Pratha is a Hindu practice where the wife ascends the funeral pyre of her husband and gives up her life. The word Sati may have been derived from the name of Shiva&#8217;s wife. Sati, also called Dakshayani, was one of the daughters of Prasuti and Daksha. She loved Shiva, but her father Daksha forbade her marriage to Shiva. She married Shiva anyway, and Daksha got revenge by not inviting Shiva to a festival during his absence. Sati killed herself by self-immolation on a fire. After Shiva returned and found Sati’s body, he killed and decapitated Daksha, later replacing his head with a goat’s. Sati Pratha was widespread during the Early Brahmanic Dark Ages (1500 BC &#8211; 500 BC). It was later enforced by the Brahmins on their usurpation of power during the Later Brahmanic Dark Ages (500 BC &#8211; 1000 AD). Sati Pratha can be found in almost every Hindu scripture.<br />

<p>An unusual occurence in Bihar<br />
&#8220;In 1987, 18-year-old Roop Kanwar was immolated in Rajasthan in front of the whole village. Hers was the fortieth case in independent India, and the 28th in Rajasthan. In this case too it was glorified as the ultimate religious act of a married woman. Public pressure forced the government to enact the Rajasthan Sati Prevention Ordinance on October 1, 1987. Rajasthan Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje Scindia had maintained a stony silence on whether her government will appeal against the judgment. And it had to be filed before March 31. This would have meant going against her mother’s professed views supporting sati. It would also have meant going against the Hindu revivalists in the BJP. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;">Incidentally, VHP Vice-President Acharya Dharmendra was the master of ceremonies at the first death anniversary of Roop Kanwar</span></span>.&#8221;<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Widow burning was also celebrated as evident from archaeological evidence and structures built to honor women who gave up their lives after the death of their husbands,</p>
<p>“<a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/chikkamagaluru-500-year-old-sculpture-found-inside-3000-year-old-stone-age-structure/articleshow/91629828.cms" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Mastigallu<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> or maha sati kallu, similar to veeragallu (hero stone) sculptures, were erected for women who gave up their lives after their spouses. Karnataka&#8217;s mastigallus are from the period between 5th century CE and the 18th century.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>IN MAHABHARATA</strong></span></p>
<p>Mahabharata 1.125.33 &#8220;Vaisampayana continued, &#8216;Having said this, the daughter of the king of Madras, the wedded <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;">wife of Pandu, ascended the funeral pyre of her lord</span></span>, that bull among men.&#8221; Tr.

<p>Mahabharata 1.95.63-64 &#8220;And (one day) Pandu, beholding Madri decked with ornaments, had his desire kindled. And, as soon as he touched her, he died. <span style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;">Madri ascended the funeral pyre with her lord</span>.&#8221; Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Mahabharata 16.7.24-26 &#8220;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;">The four wives of that heroic son of Sura ascended the funeral pyre and were consumed with the body of their lord</span></span>. All of them attained to those regions of felicity which were his.<span style="color: red;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The son of Pandu burnt the body of his uncle together with those four wives of his</span>, using diverse kinds of scents and perfumed wood.

<p>Devi Bhagavatam 2.6.53-71 &#8230;Then those Munis, practising great vows, knew that Pandu was dead and performed duly, on the banks of the Ganges, the ceremony of burning the dead. At that time Madri gave over to Kunti the charge of her two sons and <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">followed the Sati practice along with her husband to go to Satyaloka</span>&#8230;</p>

<p>Vishnu Purana 5.38.1-11 &#8220;The 8 queens of Krishna, who have been named, with Rukmini at their head, embraced the body of Hari, and entered the funeral fire. <span style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;">Revati also embracing the corpse of Rama</span>, entered the blazing pile, which was cool to her, happy in contact with her lord.

Bhagwad Purana (Srimad Bhagvatam) 4.28.50 She then prepared a blazing fire with firewood and placed the dead body of her husband upon it. When this was finished, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;">she lamented severely and prepared herself to perish in the fire with her husband</span></span>.<span style="font-size: 12pt;">&#8216;</span></p>
<p>Swami Prabhupada writes on this verse,<br />
&#8221;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;">It is the long-standing tradition of the Vedic system that a faithful wife dies along with her husband</span></span>. This is called saha-maraṇa. In India this system was prevalent even to the date of British occupation. At that time, however, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;">a wife who did not wish to die with her husband was sometimes forced to do so by her relatives</span></span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;">Formerly that was not the case — the wife used to enter the fire voluntarily</span></span>. The British government stopped this practice, considering it inhuman. However, from the early history of India we find that when Mahārāja Pāṇḍu died, he was survived by two wives — Mādrī and Kuntī. The question was whether both should die or one should die. After the death of Mahārāja Pāṇḍu, his wives settled that one should remain and the other should go. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;">Mādrī would perish with her husband in the fire</span></span>, and Kuntī would remain to take charge of the five Pāṇḍava children. Even as late as 1936 we saw a devoted wife voluntarily enter the fire of her husband.’’ A.C Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada on Bhagwad Purana 4.28.50 [Source: <a href="http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_4.28.50" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_4.28.50 <span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>]
<p>He also wrote,<br />
‘’<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;">I</span><span style="color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;">n the Vedic culture there is a system known as satī or saha-maraṇa, in which a woman dies with her husband. According to this system, if the husband dies, the wife will voluntarily die by falling in the blazing funeral pyre of her husband</span></span>. Here, in this verse, the feelings inherent in this culture are expressed by the wife of the brāhmaṇa. A woman without a husband is like a dead body. Therefore according to Vedic culture a girl must be married. This is the responsibility of her father. A girl may be given in charity, and a husband may have more than one wife, but a girl must be married. This is Vedic culture. A woman is supposed to be always dependent—in her childhood she is dependent on her father, in youth on her husband, and in old age on her elderly sons. According to Manu-saṁhitā, she is never independent. Independence for a woman means miserable life. In this age, so many girls are unmarried and falsely imagining themselves free, but their life is miserable. Here is an instance in which a woman felt that without her husband she was nothing but a dead body.’’<strong>Swami Prabhupada on Bhagwad Purana 9.9.32</strong> [Source: <a href="http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_9.9.32" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_9.9.32<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> ]
<p>Bhagwad Purana 9.9.36 After this way cursing Mitrasaha [&#8216;indulgent toward friends&#8217; or Saudâsa] she, being devoted to be with her husband, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;">found her destination by stepping into the fire that burned the bones of her husband</span></span>.</p>

<p>Garuda Purana 1.107.29 &#8221;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;">A Wife who dies in the company of her husband</span></span> shall remain in heaven as many years as there are hairs on his person&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Garuda Purana II.4.88-97 &#8220;&#8230;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;">A woman who has been chaste and faithful to her husband should mount on the pyre after bowing to her (deceased) husband before the funeral rites start</span></span>. One who gets away from the pyre due to fainting should observe the vow named prajapatya. One who ascends the pyre and follows up her husband stays in heaven for a period equal to the number of hair on the body, three and a half crore. Just as the snake-charmer takes out the snake from the hole so also she takes out her husband from hell and enjoys with him in paradise. She who ascends the pyre goes to heaven. She is praised by the celestial nymphs and enjoys with her husband so long as the fourteen Indras rule in heaven successively. Even if the man has killed a brahmana or a friend or any other person of noble conduct he is purified of sins by his wife who ascends his pyre. A woman who enters fire after the death of her husband prospers in the heaven like Arundhati. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;">Until and unless the woman burns herself after her husband&#8217;s death she is never released from the bond of her sex</span></span>. A woman who follows her husband purifies the three families on her mother&#8217;s side, the three families on her father&#8217;s side and the three families on her husband&#8217;s side.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Another verse mentioned in Garuda Purana translated by Ernest and Subrahmanyam shows how a widow repented,<br />
Garuda Purana 2.40 &#8221;Not knowing my duty I did not serve my husband, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;">nor after his death enter the fire</span></span>. Having become widowed I performed no austerities;&#8211;O Dweller in the Body, make reparation for whatever you have done!&#8221; Tr. Ernest Wood and S.V Subrahmanyam, Edited by B.D. Basu.</p>
<p>Garuda Purana 10.42 &#8221;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;">When a woman burns her body with her husband&#8217;s</span></span>, the fire burns her limbs only, but does not afflict her soul&#8221; Tr. Ernest Wood and S.V Subrahmanyam, Edited by B.D. Basu.</p>
<p>Garuda Purana 10.45-46 &#8221;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;">Likewise she who has joined her husband is never burnt. her inner soul becomes unified with that of her husband</span></span>, by death. The woman who does not burn herself in the fire, on her husband&#8217;s death, is certainly never released from feminine bodies.&#8221; Tr. Ernest Wood and S.V. Subrahmanyam, Edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>Garuda Purana 10.48 &#8221;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;">The Woman who ascends the funeral pyre, when her husband is dead, becomes equal to Arundhati, and attains the heaven</span></span>. [50] She who goes with her husband purifies three families her mother&#8217;s, her father&#8217;s, and that into which she was given.&#8221; Tr. Ernest Wood and S.V. Subrahmanyam, Edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>Brahma Purana Gautami Mahatmya 10.75 &#8221;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;">Dying Immediately after the husband is the greatest duty of women</span></span>. This is the path laid down in the Vedas. [77] The woman who follows her husband shall stay in heaven for as many years as there are hairs in a man&#8217;s body, viz. three and a half crores of years.&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, Edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana 2.3.30.39 &#8221;By entering this burning pyre, I will be slightly after a long time, the dear guest of my husband in the world of the Pitrs (Manes)[41] After saying these words with firm decision, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;">Renuka decided to follow her husband by entering the fire</span></span>.&#8221; Tr. Ganesh Vasudeo Tagare</p>
<p>Vamana Purana 46.4-22 A king died childless, and his wife wept bitterly and embraced his corpse until a bird told her that she would have seven sons if <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;">she mounted her husband&#8217;s funeral pyre</span></span>. She obeyed, and as she entered the fire the king arose and flew into the sky with her, by his power of yoga. When the queen entered her fertile period the king felt it his duty not to neglect her. He made love to her in the air, and his seed fell down from the sky. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;">Then he went with her to the world of Brahma to dwell eternally</span></span>. But the wives of the Seven Sages saw the cloud like seed falling from the sky into a flower, and they thought it was Soma. Wishing to be young forever, they bathed ritually, honoured their own husbands, and drank the king&#8217;s seed. The moment that they drank it [having thus unconsciously violated their chastity] they lost their holy lustre, and all their husbands abandoned them immediately as sinners. They gave birth to the seven Maruts (Storm Gods).</p>
<p>Padma Purana V.106.60 &#8221;Having raised her, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Narada said to the pure one about her dead (husband)</span>: &#8221;O innocent one of large eyes, please go to your husband. O you of large eyes, your husband, abandoned by his kinsmen, is dead. O auspicious one, you should not weep. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;">Enter fire (i.e. funeral pyre of your husband)</span></span>.&#8221;[65-68] If you will go to (i.e. desire to enter) fire there, then do not weep . O daughter, if you have committed a sin like enjoying another man (than your husband) then make an expiation to purify that. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;">On entering into the fire your minor sins will perish</span></span>.&#8221; Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p>Padma Purana VI.252.89-90 &#8221;Rukmaputri with Pradyumna, Usa with Aniruddha and all Yadava ladies <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;">honoured the bodies of their husbands and entered fire</span></span>.&#8221; Tr. N.A. Deshpande<br />
Skanda Purana III.i.12.115-116 &#8221;Ere long thereafter, King Manojava abandoned his body and went to the world of Siva, due to the power of that Tirtha. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;">O Brahmanas, his wife Sumitra embraced his body then and ascended his funeral pyre</span></span>. She too attained the same world.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Skanda Purana V.i.53.38-41 &#8221;&#8230;The beautiful woman gathered fuel and twigs together and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;">kindled the funeral pyre which she ascended along with her husband</span></span>. She was mentally pleased in doing so&#8230;&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Skanda Purana III.ii.7.53-56 &#8220;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;">A chaste woman who follows her husband from the house to the cremation ground for self-immolation undoubtedly attains the merit of a horse-sacrifice at every step</span></span>. Just as a snake-catcher forcibly retrieves a snake from its hole, so also a chaste woman retrieves her husband from the messengers of Yama and goes to heave. On seeing a chaste woman the messengers of Yama flee. On seeing the splendour of a chaste woman even the sun feels burning sensation, even the fire gets burnt and all other luminaries begin to tremble. A chaste woman sportingly enjoys heavenly pleasures along with her husband for as many crores and ten thousand years as there are hairs on her body.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare<br />
Narada Purana, Uttarabhaga 16.85-89 &#8220;She sold off her bangle and brought a great deal of fuel. She prepared the funeral pyre. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;">After placing her dead husband on it, she poured ghee over the pyre (fuel). She too climbed on the funeral pyre</span></span> joining her face to his face, her heart near his heart and O gentle lady, her buttocks near his buttocks. With her foot she dragged the fire. The auspicious lady of charming limbs set fire to the ailing body of the husband along with her body. As the fire blazed brightly, she cast off her body and went to the world of the Devas taking her husband with her after annihilating many of his sins by means of her holy rites very difficult to be performed.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Narada Purana, Uttarabhaga 30.87 &#8220;With a great deal of merits the woman goes to the region of Visnu alongwith her husband if her body is cremated alongwith him. But a woman greedy of wealth and of her body (?) attains Yama&#8217;s torture and the affliction of being born in base wombs of lower species.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Vamana Purana 46.51-53 &#8220;&#8230;Then after a long time that beloved slender-bodied queen of the king had pregnancy from that best of kings. During the pregnancy of the wife the king died. She, loyal to her husband, while desiring to get upon (the funeral pyre of) her husband, was prevented by the ministers, but could not be stopped.&#8221; Tr. Anand Swarup Gupta</p>
<p>There is another fake story circulated on internet that, Wives of kings used to immolate themselves only if the Kings went into battle with Muslims, Jauhar wasn&#8217;t practiced when rival king was Hindu. Let&#8217;s not indulge in history and check what scripture says,<br />
Vishnu Purana 3.18.51-55 &#8220;It is related that there was formerly a king named Śatadhanu, whose wife Śaivyá was a woman of great virtue. She was devoted to her husband, benevolent, sincere, pure, adorned with every female excellence, with humility, and discretion&#8230;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;">After a time the Rájá, triumphant over his enemies, died; and the princess ascended the funeral pile of her husband</span></span>.&#8221; Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>There is no reference that King Satadhanu lived in the period of Muslims and here we read that the wife of the king ascended funeral pyre of her husband after he died in (or after) the battle. So this refutes the claim of people who tries to blame others for all evil practices of their religion. If self-immolation with husband is such a great virtue then why don&#8217;t Hindu scripture says the same about men? But not all women are suppose to practice Sati Pratha, Brahmin women are barred from practicing it as it will be Brahmin slaughter, other than Brahmin women, following women are also exempted from ascending the funeral pyre of their husbands,</p>
<p>Narada Purana I.7.52 &#8220;O blessed princess! The following (ladies) do not ascend funeral pyre, viz. those with infant children (depending on them), pregnant women, those whose monthly course has not yet started and women in the menses.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Shiva Purana narrates story of Shiva who in the form of a merchant went to his devotee who was a prostitute to test her, he had sexual relation with her and asked her to be his wife for 3 days and a night, this can also be considered as temporary marriage or fornication since the story doesn’t narrate rituals pertaining to marriage. So after having sex with her, Shiva decided to give up his life and asked the prostitute Mahananda to lit funeral pyre, the prostitute too decided to ascend the funeral pyre as she had vowed to be the merchant’s wife for three days.</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Satarudra Samhita 3, Chapter 26, verses 38-51 “O my beloved, when the phallic image is smashed and burnt I do not desire to live. I am telling you the truth. There is no doubt in this. O gentle lady, prepare a pyre for me immediately through your servants. With my mind fixed in Śiva, I shall enter the fire… Then the merchant who was only Śiva himself went round the blazing fire. Desirous of knowing her intentions he entered the fire firmly… Taking the gemset bangle I had taken the pledge that I shall be the avowed wife of this merchant for three days… As she was going to jump in the fire with her mind fixed in his feet, Śiva, the soul of the universe, appeared in front and stopped her.” Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>IN SMRITIS</strong><br />
</span><br />
Parasara Smriti 4.28 &#8221;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;">A widow, who immolates herself on the same funeral pile with her deceased husband, resides in heaven</span></span> for ten millions of years, which is the number of hairs on the human body.&#8221; Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Brihaspati Smriti 24.11 A wife is considered half the body (of her husband), equally sharing the result of his good or wicked deeds; whether she ascends the pile after him, or chooses to survive him leading a virtuous life, she promotes the welfare of her husband.<br />
Vishnu Smriti 25.14 &#8221;After the death of her husband, to preserve her chastity, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;">or to ascend the pile after him</span></span><span style="color: #000000;">.&#8221; Tr. Various Oriental Scholars</span></p>
<p>Atri Samhita 1.209 &#8220;The woman, who falls down from the funeral pyre, [of her husband], or who gets no menses on account of a disease, becomes purified by a Prajapatya and feeding ten Brahmanas.&#8221; Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Daksha Samhita 4.19 &#8220;A woman, who, after the demise of her husband, ascends the funeral pyre, becomes of good conduct and lives gloriously in the celestial region.&#8221; Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Vijnanesvara writes in Mitakshara on Yajnavalkya Smriti verse 88</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p>‘’Moreover, though &#8221;deprived of her husband,&#8221; or bereft of her husband, she should not be without her father, &amp;c, Because, being without their protection, she &#8221;becomes infamous,&#8221; becomes blameworthy. This is (the rule, in case the widow wishes to pass her life) as a Brahmachari or celebate. Because it is ordained in the Vishnu Smriti (Ch. XXXV. 14):- &#8221;After the death of her husband (the widow should adopt one of these two courses) either to preserve her chastity (Brahmacharya) or to ascend the pile after him.&#8221; <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;">There is great virtue in Anvarohana (or self-immolation along with the deceased husband.)</span></span><br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;">Vyasa has shown the same thing, in the form of the parable of the she-pigeon:- &#8221;Devoted to her husband, she entered the raging fire</span></span>, and thereafter she obtained her (dead) lord who was adorned with a variegated bracelet. Then afterwards the bird went in company with his wife to heaven, and enjoyed it with her being honored with all acts (of service.)&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Written by Sulaiman Razvi</p>
<p>Having more than one spouse (especially wife) is known as Polygamy. The Hindu Marriage Act 1955 prohibits Polygamy for Hindus but Hindu scriptures allows polygamy and it’s still in practice among some Hindus. Not a single verse of any Hindu text says that ‘You should marry only one’ and yet Hindus claim that Hinduism permits only monogamy. Many Hindus think that Polygamy is prohibited in Hinduism, Hence Hindus are not allowed to have more than one wife. This is not true. Hinduism permits a man to have more than one wife at a time. When you tell a Hindu that Hinduism permits polygamy he won’t talk about scriptures rather he will tell you that Indian law prohibits polygamy for Hindus and Hindus have accepted the law unlike Muslims. They claim that Hindus are very adaptive. Hindus didn’t stop practices like Sati, Polygamy etc., but it was enforced by the Indian court. Recently some women and children were beaten up for entering a temple and the court had to intervene and it allowed entrance of women into some temples. So Hindus had to adapt because they had no choice but to accept court’s decisions. As far as my knowledge on polygamy is concerned I haven’t read a single verse from any Hindu scripture prohibiting polygamy.</p>
<p><span id="more-2522"></span></p>
<p>This article deals with the following subjects</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a id="post-7068-practice"></a>Practice of Polygamy in modern India</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="453" height="336" class="wp-image-7070" src="http://vedkabhed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/https-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2016-05-prac.jpeg" alt="https://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/practise-of-polygamy.jpg?w=453&amp;h=337" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/https-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2016-05-prac.jpeg 453w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/07/https-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2016-05-prac-300x223.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 453px) 100vw, 453px" /></p>
<p>While Hindus makes mockery of Muslims for having four wives each (which isn’t true) they are unaware of the fact that Hindu men are more polygamous than Muslims in India. Let’s have a look at the survey,<br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="477" height="366" class="wp-image-7071" src="http://vedkabhed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/https-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2016-05-wome.png" alt="https://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/women-polygamy-010517_0630_conditionof2.png?w=481&amp;h=368" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/https-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2016-05-wome.png 477w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/07/https-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2016-05-wome-300x230.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 477px) 100vw, 477px" /></p>
<p>As per Government’s 1961 census, 5.8% of Hindus were polygamous compared to Muslim’s 5.7%. Polygamy among Buddhist men was 7.9%, Jains 6.7% and incidence of polygamy was highest among Adivasis with 15.25% of Adivasi practicing polygamy.</p>
<p>It is illegal for non-Muslims in India to have more than one wife. In spite of this, many Hindus have multiple wives. Official reports brought out in 1974, almost two decades after the prohibition of Hindu bigamy, highlighted the shocking fact that polygamy among Hindus was higher than among Muslims (Adivasis: 15 per cent, Hindus: 5.8 per cent, Jains: 6.7 per cent, Buddhists: 7.9 per cent, Muslims: 5.6 per cent). Figures for subsequent decades are not available. The difference may appear insignificant but in real terms, it is huge — as many as one crore Hindu men had more than one wife, as opposed to just 12 lakh Muslims. In fact, according to the 2011 Census, 66 lakh women are still in bigamous marriages.</p>
<p>The National Family Health Survey carried out in 2006 showed that 2.5% of Muslim men were polygamous compared to 1.7% of Hindu men and 2.1% of Christian men. The number of polygamous marriages has dropped significantly in both Hindus and Muslims. But this time the percentage of polygamy is higher among Muslims with a 0.8% gap between Hindus and Muslims. But this 0.8% gap is not a huge number. There is something worth noticing that Indian law permits Polygamy for Muslims while Hindu Marriage Act 1955 prohibits Hindu men to have more than one wife at a time, despite this prohibition 1.7% Hindus still practices polygamy. Imagine the rate of polygamy in Hindus if Indian law permits them to have more than one wife. Indian law permits polygamy for Muslims based on Sharia law and yet only 2.5% of men practices polygamy. 1961 and 1974 census are more important because they are the only two official census to look marriages on religious lines. Apart from this, in Goa a Hindu man can practice polygamy if his wife did not bore him a child.</p>

<p>There are some tactics used by Hindus to practice polygamy in India as Hindu Marriage Act prohibits them to have more than one wife at a time. Some converts to Islam to have more than one wife but at the same time practices polygamy, some Hindus after marrying the second says that their first marriage was not solemnized as some ceremonies pertaining to Hindu law were not duly performed.</p>
<p>When a Hindu marries a second wife, the first wife lodges a criminal case against her husband pointing out his polygamy. In many cases the court rejects the case based on meager legal points and eludes the culprit out of punishment.</p>
<p>In Maharastra Mr. Balrao Sankar Lokande married a second wife. His first wife lodged a criminal case against him. Session court and High court convicted him. Mr. Balrao appealed to the Supreme court, the Supreme court released him. As he left some ceremonies pertaining to the Laws of Hindus Marriage, it can’t be considered as marriage. Since it is not a marriage, he did not commit any mistake to punish is the judgment.<br />

<p>In Kashmir Mr. Bangari married a second wife. His first wife lodged a criminal case against him. The court released him. As he left some ceremonies pertaining to the Laws of Hindus Marriage, it can’t be considered as marriage. His second wife is a concubine only. Since There is no law to punish for keeping a concubine.</p>

<p>Thus our High Courts and Supreme Court passed judgments in many cases.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Another tactic</strong> used by Hindus is the practice of Live-in relationship. A married man can have another partner through live-in relationship. And this practice has got legal backing in Gujarat where it is known as Maitri Karar. Though both men and women can practice Maitri Karar but its mostly upper caste rich Hindu men who are opting for Maitri Karar. In this practice they can have a wife and a live in partner at a time. In Madhya Pradesh too such case was reported where court ordered a man to spend equal time with wife and live-in partner. Here are the links,<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a id="post-7068-scriptures"></a>Hindu scriptures permitting Polygamy</h2>
<p>Renowned Hindu scholar Vijnanesvara writes,</p>
<p>“According to the order of the classes, for the Brahmana three, for the Ksatriya two wives, and for the Vaisya one wife are ordained. A Sudra can have only one wife born in the same class.” <strong>Vijnanesvara in his commentary Mitakshara on Yajnavalkya Smriti 3.57</strong></p>
<p>Swami Vivekananda finds no problem with Polygamy,</p>
<p>“For women, they hold chastity as the most important virtue, no doubt. One man marrying more than one wife is not so injurious to society as a woman having more than one husband at the same time, for the latter leads to the gradual decay of the race.” <strong>The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda/Volume 5/Writings: Prose and Poems/The East and The West/France-Paris</strong><br />
<a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Complete_Works_of_Swami_Vivekananda/Volume_5/Writings:_Prose_and_Poems/The_East_and_The_West/France-Paris" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Complete_Works_of_Swami_Vivekananda/Volume_5/Writings:_Prose_and_Poems/The_East_and_The_West/France-Paris<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>Swami Prabhupada the founder of ISKCON on Polygamy,</p>
<p>“…According to our Vedic process, polygamy is allowed. For example, Krsna married 16,000 wives, Arjuna married 3 or 4 wives, Krsna’s father Vasudeva, married 16 or 18 wives, like that. So according to the Vedic system polygamy is not prohibited…” <strong>By Swami Prabhupada, Letter to Karandhara written from Bombay</strong><br />
<a href="http://vanisource.org/wiki/730109_-_Letter_to_Karandhara_written_from_Bombay" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">http://vanisource.org/wiki/730109_-_Letter_to_Karandhara_written_from_Bombay<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>“People have become so degraded in this age that on the one hand they restrict polygamy and on the other hand they hunt for women in so many ways. Many business concerns publicly advertise that topless girls are available in this club or in that shop. Thus women have become instruments of sense enjoyment in modern society. The Vedas enjoin, however, that if a man has the propensity to enjoy more than one wife—as is sometimes the propensity for men in the higher social order, such as the brāhmaṇas, kṣatriyas and vaiśyas, and even sometimes the śūdras—he is allowed to marry more than one wife. Marriage means taking complete charge of a woman and living peacefully without debauchery. At the present moment, however, debauchery is unrestricted. Nonetheless, society makes a law that one should not marry more than one wife. This is typical of a demoniac society.” <strong>Swami Prabhupada on Srimad Bhagavatam 4.26.6</strong><br />
<a href="http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_4.26.6" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_4.26.6<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>He also writes,</p>
<p>“A man is allowed to keep more than one wife because he cannot enjoy sex when the wife is pregnant. If he wants to enjoy sex at such a time, he may go to another wife who is not pregnant. These are laws mentioned in the Manu-samhita and other scriptures.” <strong>Swami Prabhupada on Srimad Bhagavatam 4.27.5</strong><br />

<p>Vedas the oldest scriptures of Hinduism neither permits nor prohibits Polygamy. But traces of polygamy can be found in Vedas which implies that it was practiced in the Vedic period, I am using Shri Ram Sharma’s Hindi translation.</p>
<p>Indra is said to have three wives as per the following verse,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 5.42.12 May the House-friends, the cunning-handed Artists, may the Steer&#8217;s Wives, the streams carved out by Vibhvan, And may the fair Ones honour and befriend us, Sarasvatī, Brhaddiva, and Rākā.</p>

<p>Maitrayani Samhita 3.11.1 [140, 10-11] &#8220;The three goddesses growing by means of oblation, enjoying Indra like wives, Sarasvati, heavenly Ida, and all-conquering Bharati with their swelling milk [enjoying] the unbroken thread&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Catherine Ludvik</p>
<p>Vishnu is said to have had two wives, Sarasvati and Aditi. This is truly a case of polygamy unless it is a contradiction,</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 29.60 “…a mess of boiled rice is to be made for Prajâpati; the same for Vishnu&#8217;s Consort Aditi…” Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 7.46.3 “O Consort of Vishnu Goddess, urge thy Lord to bounty…” Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>Veda seems to sanction Polyandry as well, Rig Veda 6.49.7 considers Sarasvati as wife of Indra which is contrary to what above verses say unless it is contradiction. Sarasvati is also called wife of Ashwin brothers in Yajur Veda 19.94 which is clearly a case of polyandry.</p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.43.1. IN perfect unison all yearning hymns of mine that find the light of heaven have sung forth Indra’s praise. As wives embrace their lord, the comely bridegroom, so they compass Maghavan about that he may help.<br />

<p>Rig Veda 4.58.8 “As youthful ladies of love and virtue, inspired with passion and smiling in bliss, proceed to meet agni, enlightened husband, so do streams of ghrta move and flow into the vedi to meet the lighted fire, and the rising fire, loving and gracious, cherishes to receive the flow of the holy yajaka’s offer.” Tr. Tulsi Ram<br />

<p>Another clear English translation</p>
<p>Rig Veda 4.58.8 “The streams of Ghi incline to Agni as devoted wives, auspicious and smiling, to a husband: they feed (the flame) like fuel, and Jatavedas, propitiated, accepts them.” Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Krishna Yajur Veda 6.5.1.4 …therefore as one goes many follow; therefore one becomes superior among many; therefore one wins many wives…</p>
<p>A verse in Rig Veda clearly shows that an old Rishi Chyavana was married to many girls after he was rejuvenated,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.116.10 Ye from the old Cyavana, O Nasatyas, stripped, as ’twere mail, the skin upon his body, Lengthened his life when all had left him helpless, Dasras! and made him lord of youthful maidens.<br />

<p>Chyavana being rejuvenated is also mentioned in Nirukta 4.19, Mahabharata Adi Parva 1.177 and Pancavimsa Brahmana 14.6.10 but it doesn’t state anything about his marriages. Maidens here may refer to several maidens or just two maidens. As Hindu texts only mentions his two wives. Scriptures doesn’t give much detail about Chyavana’s wives and stresses more on Sukanya the daughter of King Saryati. Sukanya became the wife of Chyavana as mentioned in Srimad Bhagavatam 9.3, other texts talks about another wife named Arushi the daughter of Manu who bore him a son named Aurva and this is mentioned in Mahabharata Adi Parva 1.66.47.</p>
<p>Other Hindu scriptures are clear on Polygamy. They permit polygamy without a doubt.</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 3.12-13 For the first marriage of twice-born men (wives) of equal caste are recommended; but for those who through desire proceed (to marry again) the following females, (chosen) according to the (direct) order (of the castes), are most approved. It is declared that a Sudra woman alone (can be) the wife of a Sudra, she and one of his own caste (the wives) of a Vaisya, those two and one of his own caste (the wives) of a Kshatriya, those three and one of his own caste (the wives) of a Brahmana.</p>
<p>Agni Purana 285.63-67 “…A husband of many wives, should lick with his tongue, every day, a syrup composed of Triphala, Pippali, honey, clarified butter, and pulverised Amalaki treated with the expressed juice of the same fruit, and then drink water…” Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 9.85. If twice-born men wed women of their own and of other (lower castes), the seniority, honour, and habitation of those (wives) must be (settled) according to the order of the castes (varna).</p>
<p>Mahabharata 1.160.36 “There is no sin in this. For a man polygamy is an act of merit, but for a woman it is very sinful to betake herself to a second husband after the first.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Mahabharata 14.80.12-18 “Oh, let Vijaya, let him that is called Gudakesa, let this hero with reddish eyes, come back O life. O blessed lady, polygamy is not fault with men. Women only incur fault by taking more than one husband.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Mahabharata 1.197.27-28 “Drupada answered, ‘O scion of Kuru’s race, it hath been directed that one man may have many wives. But it hath never been heard that one woman may have many husbands!” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Hindu scriptures also gives instructions on which wife should do religious duties with the husband if he has several wives.</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti 26.1-4 If a man has several wives of his own caste, he shall perform his religious duties together with the eldest (or first married) wife. (If he has several) wives of diverse castes (he shall perform them) even with the youngest wife if she is of the same caste as himself. On failure of a wife of his own caste (he shall perform them) with one belonging to the caste next below to his own; so also in cases of distress (i.e, when the wife who is equal in caste to him happens to be absent, or when she has met with a calamity); But no twice born man ever with a S’udra wife.</p>
<p>Katyayana Samhita 8.6 “Many wives of the same caste and of other castes existing, the rite of churning, for producing the Fire, should be done by the chaste wives of the same caste, on account of the superiority of birth.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>FOUR WIVES</strong>:</p>
<p>The only confusion regarding Polygamy in Hindu scriptures is that some Hindu scriptures permits a Brahmin to marry four women and some permit only three. Following verses permits four wives for a Brahmin, three (as well as numerous) to a Kshatriya, two to a Vaishya and only one to a Shudra,</p>
<p>Mahabharata 13.47.4 “It has been laid down, O grandsire, that a Brahmana can take four wives, viz., one that belongs to his own order, one that is a Kshatriya, one that is a Vaisya, and one that is a Sudra, if the Brahmana wishes to indulge in the desire of sexual intercourse.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Mahabharata 13.48.4 “The Brahmana may take four wives, one from each of the four orders. In two of them (viz.,the wife taken from his own order and that taken from the one next below), he takes birth himself (the children begotten upon them being regarded as invested with the same status as his own)…A Kshatriya may take three wives…The Vaisya may take two spouses…The Sudra can take only one wife, viz., she that is taken from his own order. The son begotten by him upon her becomes a Sudra….” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Agni Purana 153.1 ”Pushkara said:- A Brahman may take four wives, a Kshatriya three, a Vaishya two, while a member of the Shudra caste is not allowed to have more than a single wife.” Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 9.149. If there be four wives of a Brahmana in the direct order of the castes, the rule for the division (of the estate) among the sons born of them is as follows:</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti 24.1-5 Now a Brahmana may take four wives in the direct order of the (four) castes; A Kshatriya, three; A Vaisya, two; A Sudra, only one.</p>
<p>Baudhyana Dharma Shastra, Prasna I, Adhyaya 8, Kandika 16, verses 1-5 There are four castes (varna, viz.) Brâhmanas, Kshatriyas, Vaisyas, and Sûdras. (Males) belonging to them (may take) wives according to the order of the castes, (viz.) a Brâhmana four, A Kshatriya three, A Vaisya two, A Sudra one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>THREE WIVES:</strong></p>
<p>Paraskara Grihya Sutra I Kanda, 4 Kandika, 8-11 Three (wives are allowed) to a Brahmana, in accordance with the order of the castes, Two to a Raganya, One to a Vaisya, One Sudra wife besides to all, according to some (teachers), without using Mantras (at the ceremonies of wedding, &amp;c.).</p>
<p>Yajnavalkya Smriti 3.57 “Three, according to the order of the caste, so also two, and one for a Brahmana, a Ksatriya and a Vaisya respectively (may be the wives). To a person born as a Sudra, a girl of her own caste is his wife.” Srisa Chandra Vasu</p>
<p>See commentary by Vijnanesvara on this verse for explanation which I have mentioned in this article.</p>
<p>Sankha Samhita 4.7 “Brahmana can marry three wives, a Kshatriya can take a couple of wives, while a Vais’ya or S’udra can marry a single wife. A Brahmana can marry a Brahmana, Kshartriya, or a Vais’ya girl.” Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Vasistha Samhita 1.24. Three wives (are permitted) to a Brâhmana according to the order of the castes, two to a Kshatriya, one to a Vaisya and to a Sûdra.</p>
<p>Mahabharata 13.44.11-12 “A Brahmana can take three wives. A Kshatriya can take two wives. As regards the Vaisya, he should take a wife from only his own order. The children born of these wives should all be regarded as equal. Of the three wives of a Brahmana, she taken from his own order should be regarded as the foremost. Similarly, of the two wives permitted to the Kshatriya, she taken from his own order should be regarded as superior. Some say that persons belonging to the three higher orders may take, only for purposes of enjoyment (and not for those of virtue), wives from the lowest or the Sudra order. Others, however, forbid the practice.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Some allows a Brahmin to have four wives while others allow three. As I said in my article <a href="/index.php/2016/06/05/caste-system-in-hinduism/" data-wpel-link="internal">Caste System in Hinduism</a>, There is unanimity among scholars that a Brahmin should first marry a woman from his own caste and then of succeeding castes. This applies for Kshatriya and Vaisya also. They can marry several women from their own castes also but laws concerning marriage with other castes is mentioned in those verses. As for those who allow a Brahmin to marry only three, they say it on the following basis,</p>
<p>Yajnavalkya Smriti 3.56 “Though it has been said that a twice born may take a wife from a Sudra family, yet that is not my opinion, because out of her, he is born himself.” Tr. Srisa Chandra Vasu</p>
<p>Similar thing is also said in Manu Smriti 3.14. A man belonging to low caste cannot marry girl belonging to preceding caste. But a Brahmin can marry a girl of any caste. Following two verses will clear the confusion,</p>
<p>Narada Smriti 12.4-6 When a Brahman, Kshatriya, Vaisya, or Sudra takes a wife, it is best for him to take her out of his own caste; and so is a member of her own caste (the most eligible) husband for a woman (of any caste). A Brahman may marry three wives of different caste, in the direct order of the castes; and so may a Sudra woman take a husband of any of the three castes above her own. For a Kshatriya, two wives differing (from him) in caste are permitted; for a Vaisya, a single wife differing (from him) in caste…</p>
<p>Munis to King</p>
<p>Markandeya Purana 113.31-34 “O king, A brahman who marries wives among all the castes, provided that he marries first a brahman woman, incurs no injury in his brahman-hood. Likewise a kshatriya who marries first a kshatriya’s daughter, incurs no harm if he marries wives from lower castes; and therefore, O king, these other wives fall not from their own righteousness. Thus a vaisya, who marries first a vaisya woman and afterwards a girl born from a sudra family, is not excluded from the vaisya family. The law is thus declared in order…”</p>

By Sulaiman Razvi<br />
Women have been suppressed in the patriarchal Indian society. Hinduism played a key role in oppressing women, most of the practices against women in India were introduced by Hindusim. According to a survey by Thomson Reuters <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2018/06/25/health/india-dangerous-country-women-survey-intl/index.html" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">India is the most dangerous country in the world to be a woman<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. Instant desertion of wives is higher among Hindus that&#8217;s the reason why divorce rate is less among Hindus, the wife is abandoned in the case of separation. Marital rape is not a crime in India and Hindu women are not equal guardian as per Hindu minority &amp; Guardianship Act. Hindu women faced several oppressive practices like Sati Pratha, low caste women paying taxes to cover their breasts, Devdasi etc. Although these are the things of the past and outlawed by the government but it&#8217;s still in practice defying the government&#8217;s prohibition. Apologists of Indian culture mostly prefers to ignore those malpractices against women, if you tell any apologist about Sati then he will rubbish your claim and the first thing he will tell you is that &#8220;It was an ancient practice banned long ago by the government, why discuss about that?&#8221; But the apologist won&#8217;t be willing to discuss some practices prevailing in current age like Devdasi, Maitri Karar, Nata Pratha, ban of women into temples etc.<br />

<h2><a name="female-foeticide"></a>Female foeticide</h2>
<p>To begin with, let&#8217;s have a look at the rates of female infanticide. Female infanticide is highest among Hindus in India but it&#8217;s not viewed as a Hindu problem but as a social problem or problem in Indian society,<br />
Result of India’s Son Preference: 21 Million ‘Unwanted’ Girls, 63 Million ‘Missing’ Women, Says Economic Survey<br />

&#8220;Among Hindus, who make up nearly 80% of India&#8217;s population, the child sex ratio declined from 925 in 2001 to 913 in the latest Census data. This is the biggest decline — of 12 points — among all religious communities and a chilling reminder for the continuing need for much more robust action to save the girl child.&#8221;<br />
<a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Sex-ratio-dips-Jains-Sikhs-buck-trend/articleshow/50387641.cms?utm_source=facebook.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=TOI&amp;from=mdr" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Sex-ratio-dips-Jains-Sikhs-buck-trend/articleshow/50387641.cms?<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a><br />
&#8220;Among other communities, there were 958 Christian girls against 1,000 boys, 913 Hindu girls against 1,000 boys, 943 Muslim girls against 1,000 boys and 933 Buddhist girls against 1,000 boys.<br />
As per 2001 census, the child sex ratio among Hindu was 925 girls against 1,000 boys, Muslims 950 girls, Christians 964 girls, Sikhs 786 girls, Buddhists 942 girls and Jains 870 girls against 1,000 boys.&#8221;<br />

&#8220;Decades of sex determination tests followed by female foeticide have finally caught up with Punjab and Haryana,&#8221; said a sociologist in the shared state capital Chandigarh.<br />
The situation will worsen as sex ratios dip further over the next decade, she added. In Fatehgarh Sahib district, 200 miles north of Delhi, for instance, the present male-female ratio is among India&#8217;s lowest &#8211; 754 girls for 1,000 boys. Some villages in the region dominated by Jat Sikh farmers have only 550-600 girls per 1000 males and the disparity is growing.<br />

<p>&#8220;In 1991 and 2001, Muslims and Hindus had virtually similar female-male ratios, with the former consistently at a slight advantage. Sikhs trailed far behind. But in 2011 Muslims have shown a marked improvement.<br />
In a decade, their female-male ratio has leaped from 936 to 951 women for every 1000 Muslim men. But in the same period, the Hindu ratio only rose from 931 to 939. The gender gap between the two communities has widened.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;The government has yet to release the latest religion-specific child sex ratios. In 2001, it was 950 for Muslims, which is considered to be more or less ‘normal’. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;">But it was significantly lower for Hindus due to entrenched gender discrimination, especially blatant sex selective abortion</span></span>.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;So, in all likelihood in this round too, Muslim child sex ratios are expected to be better than Hindus. Perhaps significantly better, despite setbacks in <a title="Jammu and Kashmir" href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-south-asia-13385727" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Jammu and Kashmir<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. But the number of “missing women” among Hindus is likely to be alarming.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Rich states like Haryana and Punjab fare the worst in child sex ratios, especially due to sex-selective abortions. But, across the border in Pakistan’s Punjab province despite lower female literacy, more girls are born and survive childhood. Religion is an important difference across the two sides of the Punjab border.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Across the majority of Indian states, too, Muslims have overall higher female-male ratios despite lower socio-economic development and literacy. One argument is that in larger Muslim families perhaps there is lesser pressure for sex selection.&#8221;</p>
<p>Around 7 million girls in India go missing every decade due to skewed sex-ratio<br />

<h2><a name="Maitri-karar"></a>Maitri Karar</h2>
<p><span style="color: #3e3e3e;">Maitri karar allows married men in Gujarat to enter &#8216;friendship deeds&#8217;, allowing them to live with women other than their spouse. Women is treated as a mistress/concubine here, what&#8217;s more shocking is that it has legal backing.</span><br />
&#8220;In Gujarat, there is a social tradition that is used to circumvent the provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act by men so they can &#8220;have another woman&#8221; in their lives. Hindu Marriage Act only allows one wife. Polygamy is a punishable offense.<br />
<span style="color: black; background-color: whitesmoke;">In Gujarat a system prevailed in which a man and a woman entered into a friendship agreement, a legitimate contract before a magistrate. It had a social and legal sanction and was popularly known as &#8220;maitri karar&#8221;. Later this practice was converted into a &#8220;service agreement&#8221;, according to which the man would keep the woman of his choice in his house as a helper or a maid servant. Not surprisingly, this contract, too, had a legal and social legitimacy. It is well known that this practice was followed by many Ministers and senior bureaucrats.<br />
</span><br />
As per some figures 29,951 cases of &#8216;<strong>Maitri Karar</strong>&#8216; (Friendship Contract) are registered in the District Collectors office in Ahmedabad.&#8221;<br />

<strong>Features:</strong> Examples of similar liaisons abound throughout Ahmedabad. Rather than initiate or wait for cumbersome divorce proceedings to be decided, people of Ahmedabad are opting for a contract known as<em> maitri karar</em> (friendship contract). The document is in fact little more than a promise of friendship and companionship between a man and a woman at least one of whom is already married. In addition, a <em>maitri karar</em> invariably includes an undertaking by the man that he will look after and financially support his partner.<br />

<strong>College girl gets court nod for &#8216;live-in&#8217; with married man<br />
</strong><br />
Ahmedabad, Thu Jun 28 2012<br />
A metropolitan court recently allowed a 20-year-old woman to unite with her live-in mate from the same tribe, releasing her from a women&#8217;s protection home where she was kept against her wishes.<br />
Neha Patani, a resident of Saraspur and in her first year of college, had eloped with Sanjay Kumar Patani, an auto-rickshaw driver, three months ago. Sanjay was already married and has four children.<br />
Sanjay and Neha had signed a &#8220;live-in contract&#8221; (maitri karar) before they started living together.<br />

<strong>Women in the uniform civil code debate<br />
</strong><br />
The upper-caste Gujarati version of bigamy is called maitri karar, meaning friendship document. Saying that people in Ahmedabad were &#8220;opting for it&#8221;, a 2013 report in India Today described it thus: &#8220;The document is in fact little more than a promise of friendship and companionship between a man and a woman at least one of whom is already married. In addition, a maitri karar invariably includes an undertaking by the man that he will look after and financially support his partner.<br />
&#8220;Each agreement is tailor-made to suit the particular needs of the individuals who make it, but there are a number of common features. Every agreement puts down in detail the backgrounds and marital status of the lovers, and both parties state that they know the other&#8217;s antecedents and have opted for the relationship out of free will. Some karars are even specific about the amount the man will pay for the upkeep of his partner. Some agreements even succeed in reflecting the nature of the relationship between the signatories.&#8221;<br />

Devadas Kalasua, son of Deetaram, though already married, had eloped with Magdu Bai from a neighbouring village and brought her to his home where he lived with his first wife Champa Bai and children. Later, Champa Bai shifted to Phalasiya to live with her sons, while Devadas continued to live with Magdu Bai at his ancestral home. However, both the wives were tolerant and were on talking terms.<br />

<h2><a name="Polygamy"></a>Polygamy</h2>
<p>While Polygamy for Hindu is prohibited by the Hindu marriage act and viewed as heinous among Hindus only to taunt Muslims but the incidence of polygamy is higher among Hindus in India than Muslims even after its illegality. And as a result some Hindu men opt for other things like converting to Islam to marry more women, practicing Maitri Karar, Nata Pratha so as to have another women in their lives and many practices bigamy without practicing the above mentioned things. Such relationships in India include contemporary polyandry in Punjab and Haryana, the Nata Pratha in Rajasthan and Maitri Karar in Gujarat. Many of these practices, whether traditional or not, involve male bigamy. Following graphs shows incidence of polygamy among various religions in India, first graph is taken from Scroll.in and second one is made by me,</p>

<p><strong>Indian Men Marry &#8216;Water Wives&#8217; In Drought-Stricken Villages To Survive Heat Wave, Water Shortages</strong><br />
Indian men in a drought-stricken village are marrying multiple women in order to fetch drinking water for their household. Villagers in Denganmal in western India rely on two wells for drinking water, but the sweltering walk and wait at the crowded spot can take hours. The answer? A &#8220;water wife,” villagers told <a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/2015/06/04/india-waterwives-widerimage-idINL3N0YQ1ZL20150604" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Reuters<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>.<br />
Polygamy is outlawed in India, but “water wives” have become the norm in Denganmal as India faces the threat of another drought this year. Sakharam Bhagat, 66, now has three wives, two of whom he married just to ensure his family had enough water to drink and cook with.<br />
“I had to have someone to bring us water, and marrying again was the only option,” Bhagat, who works as a day laborer on a nearby farm, told Reuters on Thursday. “My first wife was busy with the kids. When my second wife fell sick and was unable to fetch water, I married a third.”<br />

Another trick used by Hindus to have more than one spouse is that,<br />
tactics used by Hindus to practice polygamy in India as Hindu Marriage Act prohibits them to have more than one wife at a time. Some converts to Islam to have more than one wife but at the same time practices, some Hindus after marrying the second says that their first marriage was not solemnized as some ceremonies pertaining to Hindu law were not duly performed.<br />
When a Hindu marries a second wife, the first wife lodges a criminal case against her husband pointing out his polygamy. In many cases the court rejects the case based on meager legal points and eludes the culprit out of punishment.<br />
In Maharastra Mr. Balrao Sankar Lokande married a second wife. His first wife lodged a criminal case against him. Session court and High court convicted him. Mr. Balrao appealed to the Supreme court, the Supreme court released him. As<span class="text_exposed_show"> he left some ceremonies pertaining to the Laws of Hindus Marriage, it can’t be considered as marriage. Since it is not a marriage, he did not commit any mistake to punish is the judgment.<br />

<h2><a name="Polyandry"></a>Polyandry</h2>
<p>Polyandry is not prevalent in large scale but many Hindu tribes still practices Polyandry.<br />
<strong>The wife married to FIVE brothers: Rajo, 21, follows a tradition in Indian villages which allows families to hold on to their farmland<br />
</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Rajo Verma, 21, lives in one room with the siblings, in Northern India</li>
<li>The young wife spends each night with a different brother in turn</li>
<li>She does not know which of siblings is the father of her young son</li>
<li>Fraternal polyandry is tradition in the small village near Dehradun</li>

<strong>Share wife save land<br />
</strong><br />
It may be incongruous in the 21st century, but polyandry, an ancient tribal custom in the remote Kinnaur district of Himachal Pradesh, still thrives. The reasons are largely to do with ancestral land holdings.<br />
With four common offspring, they eke out their living mainly from the four bighas of land they had inherited. &#8220;Had we married separately, our family would have spread but the land would have shrunk. Having a common wife has saved us from penury,&#8221; says Namgayal.<br />
The extreme form of fraternal polyandry in which four to five siblings have a common wife is now mainly confined to the remote interiors of Pooh and Yangthang areas of upper Kinnaur, but elsewhere the practice has evolved into a more practical equation of two brothers sharing a spouse.<br />

<strong>One Bride for 2 Brothers: A Custom Fades in India<span style="font-family: Segoe Print;"><br />
</span></strong><br />
Buddhi Devi was 14 when she was betrothed. In India, that is not unusual: many marry young. Her intended was a boy from her village who was two years younger- that, too, was not strange. But shee was also supposed to marry her future husband&#8217;s younger brother, once he was old enough.<br />
Ms. Devi is a ghost of another times, one of a shrinking handful of people who still live in families here that follow the ancient practice of polyandy.<br />

<strong>The tradition of &#8216;Draupadi&#8217; in the land of Shiva: Many husbands, one wife<br />
</strong><br />
The layman identifies it with Draupadi, the heroine of Ved Vyas&#8217;  Mahabharata who was married to the five Pandava brothers.<br />
In Kinnaur it is said that songs of bereavement and separation are sung by women only with the permission of the gods. That&#8217;s because women here are not even given the time to mourn the death of a spouse.<br />
The times have changed and with it many traditions, but polyandry continues to be practiced.<br />
Many families here have a single wife for four or five brothers.<br />

<p>&#8216;Nata Pratha&#8217; is a traditional system in Rajasthan by which a married woman can go away with another man in lieu of money paid to the her husband or his family by the second man. <span style="color: #3e3e3e;">Nata Pratha, practiced in states such as Rajasthan, allows a man to sell his wife.</span><br />

<p><strong>Kids most vulnerable to abuse due to &#8216;Nata pratha&#8217;<br />
</strong><br />
A report prepared by NGO Vaghdhara in association with Unicef states that 2% of the 35 lakh tribal children in the age group of 4-14 have been impacted due to &#8216;Nata&#8217; practice. Historical accounts state that the practice of living with another person if a spouse is unhappy or one of them dies is prevalent from the last couple of centuries.<br />
The person who undergoes Nata can live with another person of his/her choice without being married as many times as they want.<br />
The main findings are that majority of mothers who went for &#8216;nata&#8217; marriage have either never tried or they were not allowed to maintain contact with their children. &#8220;Thirty-eight percent abandoned children covered under the study are subjected to exploitation in terms of household chores or have been beaten. Around 13% of the children have to face humiliation in schools and the society at large,&#8221; said a report. It didn&#8217;t stop here, 6% of them reportedly faced abuse (verbal and physical).<br />

<strong>Tribal children bear brunt of Nata Pratha in Rajasthan: Study<br />
</strong><br />
Children face humiliation at schools if their mother has gone to another man under an ancient practice called Nata Pratha, and most of them do not have friends to share their feelings with, a study by an NGO in south Rajasthan, has found.<br />
The study – which was released at a state-level consultation on &#8220;ensuring protecting rights of tribal children in Rajasthan&#8221; – said 13% of children face humiliation at schools because of Nata in their family, 6% of them face verbal and physical abuse.<br />
Twenty-two percentage of children reported that they see violence in families in daily life after Nata relation, the study found.<br />

<strong>To move in with married woman, ward panch marries 6-yr-old<br />
</strong><br />
Nata Pratha, a custom prevalent in parts of Rajasthan, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh, allows a man to have a live-in relationship with a married woman.<br />

An ancient local custom, Nata Pratha dictates that any married man can have an affair with a married woman if he provides financial compensation, the two lovers must both be wed.<br />
Because Ratan Lal Jat was single, he married the six-year-old girl in order to comply with the age-old tradition.<br />

प्रथा का दुरूपयोग आज के दौर में महिलाओं की तस्करी, दलाली अथवा महिलाओं की अदला-बदली में भी किया जा रहा है और इस कार्य में समुदाय स्तर के समाज के मुख्य प्रतिनिधियों द्वारा भी बढ़-चढ़ कर भाग लिया जाता है, जिनमें जाति पंच, वृद्धजन एवं आस-पास के गांव के व्यक्ति भी इसमें सम्मिलित होते है।<br />

<strong>Towards oblivion<br />
</strong><br />
The local marriage broker or agent who keeps track of men interested in cajoling women into Nata approaches him. He tells Madanlal about Sita Bai who has been forced out by her husband along with her five-year-old child. Sita Bai and her son now stay with her parents who, being poor, cannot keep her for long.<br />
One day the marriage agent takes Madanlal to Sita Bai&#8217;s place where he discreetly sees her and demands Rs. 80,000 to fix the Nata. When Madanlal complains of the steep price demanded for Sita Bai, the broker dismisses Madanlal saying he can get others who would be happy to pay the price. Hearing this, Madanlal grudgingly agrees to pay. A third of this will go to the broker and the rest of it to Sita Bai&#8217;s parents who will take care of her son.<br />
Cases of Nata Pratha are rampant, not only in Rajasthan but also in Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat, but unfortunately most go unnoticed. One reason may be the fact that they do not capture media attention as much as cases of &#8220;Sati&#8221; or dowry deaths do.<br />
Broadly speaking, Nata Pratha is a traditional practice whereby a man can refuse to stay in his present marriage and can seek another woman by paying a specified monetary price for her; in fact, literally speaking, &#8220;buying&#8221; her. The sum may range from a few thousands to even a few lakhs.<br />
One such case is Shanta Bai who refused to be sent on Nata. Her husband was forcing her out as he wanted to get another woman on Nata. She failed to comply with his demands and so he spread a rumour in the village calling her a witch. This rumour spread like wildfire and led to her death. Her body was found in the village well and the case was reported as suicide.<br />

Cases of Nata Pratha are rampant, not only in Rajasthan but also in Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat, but unfortunately most go unnoticed. One reason may be the fact that they do not capture media attention as much as cases of &#8220;Sati&#8221; or dowry deaths do. To a reader, any news of Nata Pratha may not sound very sensational; however its repercussions on the rural women are horrific. Broadly speaking, Nata Pratha is a traditional practice whereby a man can refuse to stay in his present marriage and can seek another woman by paying a specified monetary price for her; in fact, literally speaking, &#8220;buying&#8221; her. The sum may range from a few thousands to even a few lakhs. The reasons for divorcing a woman may range from her character being suspect to calling her a witch and subsequently abandoning her. As Nata is traditional practice which is socially sanctioned and acknowledged, most men have the freedom to leave one woman and get another without actually giving any reasons for it.<br />
The future for a single abandoned woman may be even bleaker, bereft of all her property rights. As is evident in our history, a woman has never had any property rights; hence she is always at the mercy of her husband, her grown-up son, or her own parents. She may further be labelled as a characterless woman if she decides to stay without a man for the rest of her life. Hence she may have no choice but to succumb to Nata.<br />
One such case is Shanta Bai who refused to be sent on Nata. Her husband was forcing her out as he wanted to get another woman on Nata. She failed to comply with his demands and so he spread a rumour in the village calling her a witch. This rumour spread like wildfire and led to her death. Her body was found in the village well and the case was reported as suicide.<br />
The fact that the Jati Panch sanctions Nata aggravates it further. The Jati Panch is one of the most recognized forms of village institution. It consists of people of higher castes, elderly men from close-by villages, and the police. The Jati Panch is a body which settles disputes, decides on marriages, and is also an authority on Nata relations. An exclusive domain of men, the Jati Panch completely excludes women from all forms of decision-making<br />
Nata has always been practiced in rural Rajasthan. However, in recent times, Nata Pratha has also become a lucrative business which involves the local brokers, the &#8220;Jati Panch,&#8221; as well as the police. Sometimes, when people are not able to pay a high commission to the brokers, they bribe the police and subsequently abduct the woman. After receiving their dues, the police turn a blind eye to the abduction.<br />

<strong>Scarred by ancient Rajasthan custom, abandoned kids find hope in govt scheme<br />
</strong><br />
Nata Pratha, a centuries-old custom in Rajasthan, allows men to live with women they are not married to. Women who follow the regressive practice leave their children behind with their marital families when they go off to another man.<br />
When Jyoti&#8217;s mother left, she and her two siblings, 10 and 8, became Bhanwari&#8217;s responsibility. The elderly woman was already raising four children of her daughter, Sanjana, whose husband hacked her to death over a domestic dispute in 2012. The man is in jail.<br />
Pale-skinned Bhanwari wasn&#8217;t aware of government aid for raising children left by women who follow Nata Pratha which is a social scourge for children left behind by their mothers.<br />

<p><strong>Nata Pratha, a Tradition That Allows Men and Women to Live With Person of Their Choice</strong><br />
A centuries-old custom “Nata Pratha” is still alive in several Indian states like Rajasthan, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh. The custom allows men to live with as many women resulting in children being abandoned by their parents.<br />
Nata Pratha is practiced by the Bhil tribe, the one of the largest tribes in South Asia.<br />

<p><strong>Agony of alliances</strong><br />
A socially accepted custom forces women in rural Rajasthan into a string of marriages approved by their families or even husbands for the &#8220;bride price&#8221; they get from the new groom.<br />
<strong>Testimonies of Nata Pratha victims </strong><a href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/custom-in-rajasthan-forces-women-into-string-of-marriages-for-bride-price/1/181530.html" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/custom-in-rajasthan-forces-women-into-string-of-marriages-for-bride-price/1/181530.html<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p><strong>SUCH CUSTOM EXISTS IN MADHYA PRADESH ALSO</strong><br />
Madhya Pradesh’s Village has a Custom of Renting a Wife For Rs 10<br />
Here women are given on lease to wealthy businessmen who don’t have a wife, by their own husbands. All they have to do is sign on stamp papers of Rs 10 and the deal is made. After the contract ends, another deal is signed with some other man or the real husband of the woman on Rs 10 stamp paper and the woman has a new husband again.<br />
Madhya Pradesh is not the only state where this is happening. In 2006, a man in Gujarat sold his wife to a rich businessman for a monthly rental of Rs 8000.<br />
In some places, tribals enter into an agreement with brokers and marry off their daughters to rich men for a price. The brokers charge around Rs 65000-Rs 70000 from the rich men and give Rs 15000-Rs 20000 to the tribals.<br />

<h2><a name="unique-identifier"></a>Atta Satta (Bride Exchange)</h2>
<p><strong>A child and divorced</strong><br />
Meera Mali, age 13, studying in Class V in the village Dabla Kachra is one of the 3.7 lakh children in her state and 20 lakh across the country who got married before the age of 14—too young to even remember the ceremony, if there was one.<br />
Meera’s life was inextricably linked with that of her elder sister Leela. When Leela got married to Narain Lal Mali, Meera was given in marriage to his younger brother Bansi Lal Mali. But a few years later, when Leela refused to go back to her in-laws and settled down with another man Laduji, it was Meera who had to bear the brunt of her sister’s actions.<br />
Laduji paid Rs 70,000 as compensation to Narain and “bought” over Leela. But in the process Meera became a “leftover” girl even before she knew what marriage was as her in-laws refused to accept her in retaliation for her sister’s actions.<br />
<strong>Aptly enough, this traditional system is called atta-satta</strong>, meaning exchange. As a result if one marriage breaks, the other alliance automatically stands cancelled.<br />
Maitra of village Khera in Bhilwara was married off in a similar fashion and for a similar purpose when she was all of seven to 15-year old Ram Pal.<br />
{mosimage}She was given in exchange for a bride for her aging uncle Ram Saroop. For Saroop this marriage was just a ploy to get rid of his unmarried status. He divorced his wife soon after the wedding but in the process Maitra too was divorced by Ram Pal.<br />
According to Prayas, there are hundreds of instances of people like Gopal Mali who, after getting fed up of his wife—bought for Rs 11,000 and one-and-half kg of silver—left her to buy a divorcee he fancied for Rs 1 lakh. With rural societies blatantly accepting such norms, it’s little wonder that children are being married while barely out of the cradle, and getting divorced not much later.<br />

<h2><a name="Dowry"></a>Dowry</h2>
<p>Dowry (known as Dahej in Hindi) has been traditionally practiced in the Hindu society since centuries. Dowry is given by the parents of the girl and it consists of various household things like dresses, ornaments, electrical goods, bedroom furniture, etc. at the time of the marriage. But ironically, this practice also like other is not viewed a Hindu problem but as a problem in Indian society, though it maybe prevalent in other religions in India due to influence of Hinduism but it&#8217;s mostly practiced by Hindus. Let&#8217;s have a look at the survey,<br />
&#8220;In an informal study of dowry deaths which reached the Supreme Court and the Bombay High Court, conducted by Majlis, Mumbai, over 95 per cent of these cases of dowry death were among Hindus.&#8221;<br />
<a href="http://www.boomlive.in/what-has-hindu-law-ever-done-for-women/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">http://www.boomlive.in/what-has-hindu-law-ever-done-for-women/<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a><br />
&#8220;the problem of dowry-related violence and dowry deaths. There is no research conducted as to how many women who are murdered for dowry are Hindus. A research done by our organisation about cases which have reached the Supreme Court and the Bombay High Court revealed that more than 90 percent were Hindus. Less than 10 percent were Muslims and others.&#8221;<br />

&#8220;All over India, where Hindu wives traditionally burned on their husbands&#8217; funeral pyres, brides in recent years have been dying in their husband&#8217;s homes in fires that were called &#8221;accidents&#8221; until women&#8217;s organizations began to demand an official accounting.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Women&#8217;s organizations point to the seriousness of the situation. One, the Ahmedabad Women&#8217;s Action Group, in Gujarat state, says that research shows that 1,000 women may be burned alive annually in that state alone. Gujarat is the birthplace of Mohandas K. Gandhi.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Asked recently in Parliament to quantify this phenomenon, which began to draw attention about a decade ago when the number of deaths in fires reported as &#8221;kitchen accidents&#8221; started rising in northern India, India&#8217;s Home Affairs Minister, Palaniappan Chidambaram, said that registered cases of dowry deaths nationwide numbered 999 in 1985, 1,319 in 1986 and 1,786 in 1987. Women&#8217;s groups say that total will be surpassed easily this year -and that in a country of 800 million people, most of whom do not report domestic violence, the real numbers are far higher. Some Deaths Suicides&#8221;<br />

Hayathnagar police said that Ramesh Kumar Sharma, working as priest in a temple at Vemulawada, had agreed to give his daughter&#8217;s hand in marriage to the son of Anjaneya Sharma, priest in a temple at Banjara Hills, a few weeks ago.<br />
The girl and boy were in ninth and tenth standards respectively.<br />

<h2><a name="suicide"></a>Suicide highest among Indian women</h2>
<p>&#8220;Last year a <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22726517" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><em>Lancet</em> study<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> estimated there were 187,000 suicides in India among over 15s in 2010, or three percent of all deaths recorded that year. It represented a more than 50,000 increase on official <a href="http://ncrb.nic.in/ADSI2010/ADSI2010-full-report.pdf" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">National Crime Records Bureau figures<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, attributed to under-reporting of cause of death possibly due to social concerns over what remains a taboo subject. Compare this with the 5,608 suicides that occurred in over 15s in the UK in 2010. India&#8217;s population is nearly 20 times that of the UK&#8217;s, meaning equivalent figures would set Indian suicides at about 112,000 &#8212; 75,000 less than the <em>Lancet</em> article&#8217;s estimates.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;According to the study, 40 percent of those suicides among men and 56 percent among women occurred between the ages of 15 and 29, and rates were higher among well-educated young people in wealthier areas, suggesting economic strife is not the overriding cause behind the increase. This may instead correlate to social pressures surrounding issues of marriage at that time in life.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;The escalating issue of sexual discrimination and the consequent violence towards women may also be a contributory factor. In response, the country&#8217;s parliament has just passed <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/mar/21/indian-parliament-law-sexual-violence" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">a new law<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> to offer more protection for women and harsher penalties for their attackers. A sign of the kind of social taboo surrounding the issue was made clear with an inclusion in the law to make it a crime for police to refuse to open a case based on complaints by women about sexual attacks. &#8220;The main social determinants for suicide in women are interpersonal violence (for example, marital violence) and economic difficulties,&#8221; Vikram Patel, Wellcome Trust Senior Research Fellow in Clinical Science and coauthor on the Lancet study, told Wired.co.uk.&#8221;<br />

<h2><a name="Honour-killing"></a>Honour killing</h2>
<p>Honour killing in India is highest among Hindus. The main reason behind it inter-caste marriage and unfortunately it is sanctioned by Hindu scriptures.<br />
<strong>Caste pride, purity of women and honour killings<br />
</strong><br />
&#8220;While up north, khap panchayats (kangaroo courts) held by dominant communities brazenly rule against inter-caste love marriages, in Tamil Nadu many cases of honour killings go unreported as the deaths are often passed off as suicides. The recent death of a 17-year-old caste Hindu girl, whose parents opposed her love affair with a Scheduled Caste youth in Ramanathapuram district indicates the serious proportions assumed by this under-reported social reality.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Mr. Sampath claimed that in the last three years the State had witnessed 98 honour killings, but most of these cases were &#8220;covered up&#8221; as suicides.<br />
&#8220;Even if inter-caste marriages had the blessings of parents of the bride and groom, humiliations, social boycott and ostracisation force them either to break the marriage or encourage them to eliminate the newly married in the name of honour killing,&#8221; he contends.&#8221;<br />

An unusual occurence in Bihar<br />
&#8220;In 1987, 18-year-old Roop Kanwar was immolated in Rajasthan in front of the whole village. Hers was the fortieth case in independent India, and the 28th in Rajasthan. In this case too it was glorified as the ultimate religious act of a married woman. Public pressure forced the government to enact the Rajasthan Sati Prevention Ordinance on October 1, 1987. Rajasthan Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje Scindia had maintained a stony silence on whether her government will appeal against the judgment. And it had to be filed before March 31. This would have meant going against her mother&#8217;s professed views supporting sati. It would also have meant going against the Hindu revivalists in the BJP. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Incidentally, VHP Vice-President Acharya Dharmendra was the master of ceremonies at the first death anniversary of Roop Kanwar</span>.&#8221;<br />

<p>The caste system is in Hindu religion has many manifestations. It has not only divided the society in to various layers of graded hierarchy but has also created inhuman practices in the name of God. One of it is the Devadasi system prevalent in different forms all over India.</p>
<div class="fb-quote fb_iframe_widget"></div>
<p>This cult is prevalent even today throughout India with some regional variances. Young girls are dedicated or married to, not a mortal-man, but an idol, deity or object of worship or to a temple. The barbarism of the tradition reflects in the very rituals it involves. The initiation ritual is said to include a ‘deflowering ceremony’, known as <em>Uditambuvadu</em> in some parts, where the priest would have intercourse with every girl enrolled at his temple as part of his religious ‘duty’. So much so that a Marathi saying states <em>“Devadasi devachi bayako, sarya gavachi”</em>, meaning ‘Servant of god, but wife of the whole town’. The Devadasi is from the lowest caste, whose parents have given them to local goddesses or temples as human ‘offerings’. She has to remain unmarried, and maintain herself by ceremonial begging to make ends meet.<br />
Married to God before puberty, Devadasis or Joginis, many of whom live in the temples, become sexual servants to the villages’ upper-caste men after their first menstrual period. In some villages, men who buy them keep them as concubines. In others, they are public chattels, who are used by men free of charge. Socially, they are outcasts and they do suffer from severe venereal and sexually transmitted diseases. A majority of Devadasis, after reaching a certain age, migrate to towns where they join brothels and become commercial sex workers.</p>
<div class="fb-quote fb_iframe_widget"></div>
<p>Some of the states where the Devadasi practice are still prevalent have tried to eradicate it through state laws like the Bombay Devadasis Protection <a href="http://bombayhighcourt.nic.in/libweb/acts/1934.10.pdf" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Act<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, 1934, the Prohibition of Dedication <a href="http://dpal.kar.nic.in/pdf_files/1%20of%201984%20%28E%29.pdf" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Act<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, 1982 of Karnataka and the Andhra Pradesh Prohibition of Dedication<a href="http://www.popline.org/node/342240" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"> Act<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, 1988.<br />
However, the practice lives on in the states in South India mainly in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. Districts bordering Maharashtra and Karnataka are known as the ‘Devadasi belt’ of the country<span style="color: #000000;">. According to the National Commission on Women of India, it is estimated that <a style="color: #000000; text-decoration: underline;" href="http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/project-combat-launched-to-eradicate-devadasi-system/article3246913.ece" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">around <span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>2,50,000 Dalit girls are dedicated as Devadasis to Yellamma and Khondaba temples in the Maharashtra-Karnataka border</span>.<br />

<p><strong>How The Caste System Forces Dalit Women Into Prostitution</strong></p>
<div class="fb-quote fb_iframe_widget"></div>
<p>When priests and other upper caste men sleep with a devadasi, they claim it is the goddess’ desires that they are appeasing.<br />
In Karnataka alone, there are an <a href="http://www.hart-uk.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/A-Light-in-the-Darkness.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" data-wpel-link="external">estimated 100,000 devadasis<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. Today, most wind up in the brothels of India’s cities, getting higher rates the younger they are.<br />
Older devadasi women are often seen sitting around temples begging, their health in a horrible condition. With no way to earn money at their age, mothers themselves need their daughters to sell their bodies to feed the family. This leaves no scope of going to school for the little girl and makes it a generational cycle.<br />

<p>Unlike in the case of Triple Talaq within the Muslim community, where the wife might struggle for few months but eventually moves on with life by re-marrying, abandoned wives go through life-long suffering. Majority of the abandoned wives in India are from Hindu community with the numbers reaching as many as 2 million as per 2011 Census.<br />
The Hindu community in India is notorious for abandoning the wives, as it’s extremely difficult for a Hindu man to obtain divorce in Indian <span class="text_exposed_show">Courts. Instead it is always easier to simply abandon the wife. </span></p>
<div class="text_exposed_show">Modi had the option of going through a formal divorce within Indian Legal system but he choose to abandon his wife. Even today, his wife Jashodaben Modi continues to live alone and deserted. In an interview to NDTV, Mrs. Modi said “if he calls once, I will go with him”. Such is the desperation of abandoned wives, who even after being deserted for 43 years, hope that one day their husband will take them back and they will have a dignified life.<br />
In recent times, Narendra Modi has projected himself to be the Messiah of Indian Muslim women who have gone through Triple Talaq, a Sunni Hanafi practice where husband can divorce his wife by uttering “Talaq” three times instantly. All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) has called for the social boycott of the men who divorce their wives via Triple Talaq. BJP on the other hand has repeatedly called for banning triple talaq.<br />

<p>We have analysed data from the ‘Marital Status by Religious Community and Sex – 2011’ <a title="C3 table of the census" href="http://www.censusindia.gov.in/2011census/C-series/c-3.html" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">C3 table of the census<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> in order to try and establish what the empirical position is.<br />
Our principal finding is that the situation of Indian Muslim women seems <em>far better</em> than women from other religious groups.</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, the percentage of women <em>staying in marriage</em> is highest amongst Muslims (87.8%) compared to Hindus (86.2%), Christians (83.7%) and other religious minorities (85.8%).</li>
<li>The percentage of <em>widowed women</em> is least amongst Muslims (11.1%) compared to Hindus (12.9%), Christians (14.6%) and other religious Minorities (13.3%). It is likely that the culture of widow remarriages provides a higher level of family protection to Muslim women compared to women from other religious communities.</li>
<li>The percentage of <em>separated and abandoned</em> women is also least amongst the Muslims (0.67%) compared to Hindus (0.69%), Christians (1.19%) and other religious Minorities (0.68%).</li>
<li>The same census data suggests that the <em>divorced women</em> percentage is higher amongst the Muslims ay 0.49% and Christians at 0.47% compared to other religious minorities (0.33%) and the Hindus, at 0.22%. The practice of getting a divorce amongst the Hindus is traditionally non-existent. Out of 340 million ever-married women 9.1 lakhs are divorced and amongst them 2.1 lakhs are Muslims.</li>
</ul>
<p>Against this backdrop, the eagerness of the RSS, the BJP and even Prime Minister Modi to project triple talaq as the major issue to be confronted so as to empower the Muslim community is questionable. Instead, they need to focus their concern on the 43 million widowed women belonging to all parts of society, provide them incentives for remarriage and/or programmatic financial support for sustaining a living. There are also close to a million divorced women in India who require social as well as government initiated support. Further, the issues relating to separated and abandoned women is much more serious than that of  triple talaq. As per the last census, they are 2.3 million separated and abandoned women in India; in absolute terms, that is more than two times the number of divorced women. There are close to two million Hindu women who are abandoned and separated; this number is 2.8 lakh for Muslims, 0.9 lakh for Christians and 0.8 lakh for other religions.<br />

&#8220;It had said an estimated 5,000-10,000 widows were living like beggars in ashrams dotting the two holy cities of Mathura and Vrindavan.&#8221;<br />

&#8220;There are as many as 6,000 of them in this place alone and more in the surrounding countryside.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Some come as genuine pilgrims to devote their remaining years to the service of Radha/Krishna, but many others come here to escape from brutal family homes or have been flung out by their sons and daughters-in-law as unwanted baggage.<br />

<strong>TESTIMONIALS OF WIDOWS</strong><br />
http://www.maitriindia.org/looking-inwards/case-studies-testimonial/<br />
India has around 40 million widows, many of whom go to or are forced to go to homes or streets in holy cities to live out their lives in penance and prayer for the sin of outliving their husbands. Those who do not have to do this fare better but still live with many forms of social exclusion and needless judgment.<br />
I have not heard of any other civilised country where widows are banished to certain areas to live lives of extreme deprivation and grief, with no possibility of a normal life again. Can they not be productive members of society with or without remarriage? Even in the more `elevated’ echelons of society, a widow is viewed with some disdain or pity, rarely as a human being who has suffered a great loss and deserving of getting on with her life in whatever way she sees fit.<br />
The RSS, that repository of Indian culture, has actually had chiefs who have refused to allow widows the great honour of touching their feet as this was thought to be inauspicious. I would love to see the RSS take the lead in a campaign to give widows their lives back.<br />

<p><strong>Banchhada, a community that celebrates birth of girls, but for flesh-trade</strong><br />
Citing a census report, Chouhan said, &#8220;The total population of Banchhada community, which is spread over 75 villages in the three districts, is about 23,000, of which at least 65 per cent are women.&#8221;<br />
A survey conducted by the Madhya Pradesh Women Empowerment Department in 2015 in 38 villages in Mandsaur, showed that their population in the district was 3,435, with 2,243 women and 1,192 men. &#8220;It means as compared to men, the population of women is almost the double,&#8221; Chouhan said.<br />

<p><strong>Nat Purwa: Where prostitution is a tradition</strong><br />
Women from the Nat community often become sex workers from a young age<br />
<a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2013/01/20131161032441697.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2013/01/20131161032441697.html<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a><br />
A Rajasthan village where prostitution is tradition<br />
Traditionally, Bedias and Nats were dancers in Rajasthan and MP. Being entertainers, it was customary for the women and girls to perform for feudal lords.<br />
When the zamindari system was abolished, they lost their patrons. Over time, a number of Bedia women were compelled to take up prostitution for economic reasons and the men lived off their earnings.<br />
Classified as a Scheduled Caste, Bedias may be deemed poor. But in Khakranagla, there are signs of a consumerist lifestyle coming up multi-storied houses, linoleum floors, young girls in capris and mobile phones.<br />
<a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/A-Rajasthan-village-where-prostitution-is-tradition/articleshow/1717444.cms" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/A-Rajasthan-village-where-prostitution-is-tradition/articleshow/1717444.cms<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p><strong>Sex as trade and tradition: For <em>Bedia families</em>, sex is a family business where young girls engage in prostitution with the consent of the community</strong><br />
Present day Malaha (also known locally as Pachhi ka Nagla or &#8216;bird village&#8217;), has more than a hundred Bedia women engaged in sex work. Often revealingly attired, with heavily made-up faces, accentuated by bright crimson or purple lipstick, they stand about beckoning potential clients. The imposing concrete flyover that bifurcated the Bedia basti in 2005 hasn&#8217;t affected the trade. This is perhaps the only place in Rajasthan where more motorists forsake the convenience of the flyover, taking the potholed side-roads instead to stop by or simply get a closer look at the daily spectacle.<br />

<p><strong>Saraniya Community: Prostitution is the norm here; so birth of girls is celebrated</strong><br />
However not everybody and indeed every community has been able to share in the fruits of prosperity. One such group of people is the nomadic Saraniyas of the Wadia village, who are so harassed by poverty that they have found no other option but to sell their bodies in prostitution for sustenance.<br />
Indeed, as girls grow up, their own family members find it hardly amiss to initiate them into flesh trade and it has well and truly become a tradition among them.<br />

<p><strong>Bonded brides</strong><br />
Import of women to Haryana as brides from far-off regions outside the State is by now a known trend, but a recent study on the social status and rights of these women, usually referred as paro or molki (meaning purchased)<br />
The study conducted in Haryana’s Jind and Kurukshetra districts, which are most notorious for female foeticide, reveals that 66 per cent of the families practising bride trafficking are Jats, followed by 15 per cent Sainis, though the custom is prevalent among almost all other castes.<br />
<a href="http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/bonded-brides/article4307384.ece" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/bonded-brides/article4307384.ece<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a><br />
<strong>Brides purchased, then exploited in Haryana, Punjab</strong><br />
Decades of unchecked sex-selective abortions have made the once fertile States of Punjab and Haryana suffer a drought of brides, making human-trafficking a lucrative and expanding trade. Often projected as a voluntary marriage, every year, thousands of young women and girls are lured into the idea of a happy married life with a rich man in Punjab or Haryana. Sadly most ‘purchased brides&#8217; are exploited, denied basic rights, duplicated as maids, and eventually abandoned.<br />
“Marriage to an imported bride makes caste, language and culture immaterial as long as the price is paid to the girl&#8217;s family and a male child is born. Depending on the age, looks and virginity of a girl, grooms pay anywhere from Rs. 50,000 and Rs. 300,000,” said Rishi Kant of Shakti Vahini, a non-governmental organisation working on the issue.<br />
The study which covered 92 villages of Mahendragarh, Sirsa, Karnal, Sonepat, and Mewat districts said that most of the people accepted it as a common practice, but denied having bought a bride in their family.<br />
“In every village there are over 50 girls that have been bought; some of them as young as 13 and a very small percentage of the ‘sold for marriage&#8217; women are found to be living a married life. Most are untraceable or exploited or duplicated as domestic servants by the agents or men who marry/buy them. There are also instances of girls being resold to other persons after living a married life for a few years,” the study added.<br />

<strong>Human trafficking caters to demand for brides</strong><br />
According to the 2013 National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) report, 24,749 children and women between the ages of 15 and 30 were kidnapped and sold into marriage across the country.<br />
A field study on the impact of the sex ratio on marriage by NGO Drishti Stree Adhyayan Prabodhan Kendra that covered over 10,000 households in Haryana found that over 9,000 married women were bought from other states. The study, which covered 92 villages of Mahendragarh, Sirsa, Karnal, Sonepat and Mewat districts, said that most people accepted this as a common practice, even though they personally denied having purchased a bride in their family.<br />

<strong>Youth buys bride for Rs 22,000 at auction, hangs himself later</strong><br />
The man, who bought the bride, was unable to repay the remaining amount of the deal following which he hanged himself from a tree in his village in Uttar Pradesh.<br />
The man who bought the bride paid Rs 17,000 in advance. However, it was only later that the men who had arranged the deal realized that the groom, identified as Mukesh, did not have enough funds to pay in full, Deccan Chronicle reported.<br />
According to a 2016 survey by National Crime Records Bureau, the number of girls who were abducted for the purpose of marriage in India was a staggering 33,855, and half of them were under the age of 18.<br />

<p><strong>Haryana’s crisis: Bridegrooms all decked up, but no one to marry</strong><br />
Vices of the past are catching up with the Haryanvi society. Years of rampant sex selective abortions and rigid marriage laws in the Jat community have led to a `drought’ of brides. The state with the dubious distinction of the worst sex ratio in the country is now facing a crisis finding matches for its `gabru jawans’ (boys of marriageable age), who have no choice but to look for brides outside the state.<br />
But `importing a bride’ is not an easy task. It has resulted in human trafficking becoming a common practice in Haryana. Studies on the issue reveal that thousands of women from rural areas of other states including Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Odisha, Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Kerala, Assam, Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh etc. have been either brought or `bought’ for marriage purposes. These women are called `molkis’ in Haryana, because the buyers pay money to the girls’ parents.<br />
It was in this context that OP Dhankar, senior BJP leader and president of the Bhartiya Kisan Morcha suggested recently that the party could get girls from Bihar for the eligible bachelors of the state if the BJP came to power in the state. What he really meant was that instead of trafficking marriageable girls from other states, marriages could be solemnised in a legal manner with a little help from his party.<br />
According to Dr Anita Yadav, Director, Women Studies Centre (WSC), Maharishi Dayanand University, Rohtak, there are at least 6-7 brides from outside the state in almost all of the 6,000 villages of Haryana. Many of such brides are sexually and mentally harassed, many live in inhospitable conditions. In some cases the bride becomes common `property’ of male members in the family. This is exploitation of the worst kind. Sources say the `fee’ charged by the dalals for procuring women as brides from other states ranges between Rs 25,000 and Rs 30,000. Since these women are poor and illiterate in most cases, they allow themselves to be subjugated and exploited.<br />
Families of boys who procure wives from other states never accept that they have actually paid money, but it is a fact that they are ready to pay anything between Rs 30,000 to Rs 60,000 for them. An independent study conducted in Haryana showed that there is hardly any village out of 6000 villages if the state where there are no such cases found. Jats of the state face the most shortage of brides, according to the study.<br />

<p>India Is Calling Women &#8216;Witches&#8217; To Settle Scores And Get Away With Murder<strong><br />

Jharkhand, with 363 reported deaths leads the chart, with the data from 2000 missing since it was a part of Bihar, while 11 other states join the list. Haryana, Chhattisgarh, Orissa, West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Assam and Bihar have reported cases of witch-hunting with unofficial figures said to be even higher. In 2013 alone, 160 murders were committed with a witch-hunting motive out of which 54 were committed in Jharkhand alone, while more than 77 have been killed in Assam in witch-hunting related incidents between February 2010 and 2015, with 35 of them being women. But even the startling numbers fail to point out the brutality of the practice.<br />

</strong><br />
According to National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data, of the 160 murders committed in 2013 with witch-hunting as motive, 54 were from Jharkhand alone, the highest in the country. Over 400 have been killed in Jharkhand on suspicions that they were &#8220;daayans&#8221; or witches since 2001 when the state was carved out of Bihar.<br />

There is a bizarre ritual in India where a person born under the influence of Mars is called a Manglik. Marriage with such a person is believed to cause marital discord and divorce, even sometimes death. Hence the girl is made to marry a Peepal tree or dog.<br />

<h3>The humiliating ‘virginity tests’ for brides, a reality in India’s Kanjarbhat community</h3>
<p>If the girl bleeds, she passes the test. They declare, “Maal Khara hai”. If she does not, it is assumed she has had premarital sex, and they say “Maal khota hai”, meaning she is “spoiled goods”, and the marriage can be annulled.<br />
“Virginity test is a character certificate of the woman. Even the bride keeps the cloth with her bloodstains as a memento of pride,” says a member of the Kanjarbhat community<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>A Short Analysis on Women&#8217;s Inheritance in Vedas</h3>
<p>Written by Sulaiman Razvi<br />
<span id="more-627"></span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">It was due to the influence of other religions like Islam that some Hindu revivalist found the need to reform Hindu society. Hindu scholars fail to furnish any Hindu text which entitles a woman to inherit her father&#8217;s property, this is because there isn&#8217;t a single authoritative text which allows a woman to inherit paternal property. It is mentioned in Vedas,<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Krishna Yajur Veda 6.5.8.1 </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;">Women are powerless, have no inheritance, </span>and speak more humbly than even a bad man.<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">It is mentioned in Baudhayana in the inheritance section,</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Baudhayana Dharma Shastra 2.2.3.46 The Veda declares, &#8216;Therefore women are considered to be <span style="color: #ff0000;">destitute of strength </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;">and of a portion</span></span>.&#8217;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">In the Rig Veda,<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Rig Veda 3.31.2 </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&#8216;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">&#8216;<span style="color: red;">The son does not transfer paternal wealth to his sister</span></span>. He makes her receptacle of the embryo of her husband. When parents procreate children of either sex, <span style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;">one (the male) becomes the performer of holy rites (he is the legal inheriter)</span>, the other (the female) is to be enriched with gifts.&#8221; Tr. Svami Satyaprakash Saraswati</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Below is the Hindi translation by Shri Ram Sharma,<br />
</span></p>
<p id="oPSjcNZ"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="548" height="121" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7639 " src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/img_5f25742e208e6.png" alt="" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/img_5f25742e208e6.png 548w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/img_5f25742e208e6-300x66.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 548px) 100vw, 548px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">This verse is further elaborated by Yaska,<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Nirukta 3.6 &#8216;<span style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;">Na Jamaye&#8217; means not for the sister</span>. Jamih (sister) is (so called because) others beget &#8216;Ja&#8217;, i.e. offspring, on her, or the word may be derived from (the root) jam, meaning to go : she has mostly to go (to the husband&#8217;s family). The legitimate, i.e. one&#8217;s own son, left, i.e. gave, wealth. He made her the place of depositing the seed of her husband, i.e. the man who accepts her hand. <span style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;">If the mothers have engendered Vahni, i. e. a son, and Avahni, i.e. a daughter, one of them, i.e. the son and the heir, becomes the procreator of children</span>, and the other, i.e. the daughter, is brought up and given away (in marriage) to another person.<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">The verse speaks for itself. This is enough to prove whether women could inherit her paternal wealth or not. Svami Satya Prakash Saraswati wrote in the brackets of the verse that the son is the legal inheritor &#8221;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> (he is the legal inheriter)</span>&#8221; Below is the snapshot from his book<br />

</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">The Hindu law is governed by Mitakshara and Dayabhaga schools of law. In the Hindu Undivided Family (HUF) the head of the family is known as Karta. Usually Karta is a male member and only male members enjoy coparcener&#8217;s interest. After the death of the Karta the eldest son takes the property (as per Manu Smriti), although property can be divided in the presence of Karta as Maharishi Manu himself divided his property among his sons while he was alive.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Krishna Yajur Veda 3.1.9 Manu divided his property among his sons.<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">A daughter can inherit property only if she has no brother that too only if her father makes her the Appointed Daughter. If the daughter begets a Son then the son becomes the legal heir and is adopted by his maternal grandfather. Yaska states,<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Nirukta 3.5 <span style="text-decoration: underline;">One should not marry a brotherless maiden</span>, <span style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;">for his (the husband&#8217;s) son belongs to him (to the father of the girl)</span>. From this, the prohibition of marrying a brotherless maiden and the father&#8217;s right to appoint his daughter as a son are evident. When a father selects a husband for his unmarried daughter, he unites himself with a tranquil mind.<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Pandit Jaydev Sharma (Arya Samaj) writes on Rig Veda 3.31.1<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;"> &#8221;The grandson shall be the legal heir of his grandfather&#8217;s property&#8221;<br />

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">It is mentioned in Purana,<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Bhagwad Puran 10.57.37 &#8220;<span style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;">Since Satrajit had no sons, his daughter&#8217;s sons should receive his inheritance</span>. They should pay for memorial offerings of waler and pinda, clear their grandfather&#8217;s outstanding debts and keep the remainder of the inheritance for themselves.<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">It&#8217;s clear that Vedas does not give rights of inheritance to women, Vedas nor the Brahmanas enables the daughter to inherit property. Even an appointed daughter can&#8217;t hold her father&#8217;s property after she begets a son. Inheritance in Hinduism is the exclusive right of Sons only.</span></p>

‘सत्यार्थ प्रकाश’ के चतुर्थ समुल्लास के क्रम सं0 120 से 149 तक की सामग्री पुनर्विवाह और नियोग विषय से संबंधित है। लिखा है कि<br />
<span id="more-2030"></span><br />
द्विजों यानी ब्राह्मण, क्षत्रिय और वैश्य वर्णों में पुनर्विवाह कभी नहीं होने चाहिए। (4-121)<br />
स्वामी जी ने पुनर्विवाह के कुछ दोष भी गिनाए हैं जैसे &#8211;<br />
(1) पुनर्विवाह की अनुमति से जब चाहे पुरुष को स्त्री और स्त्री को पुरुष छोड़कर दूसरा विवाह कर सकते हैं।<br />
(2) पत्नी की मृत्यु की स्थिति में अगर पुरुष दूसरा विवाह करता है तो पूर्व पत्नी के सामान आदि को लेकर और यदि पति की मृत्यु की स्थिति में स्त्री दूसरा विवाह करती है तो पूर्व पति के सामान आदि को लेकर कुटुम्ब वालों में झगड़ा होगा।<br />
(3) यदि स्त्री और पुरुष दूसरा विवाह करते हैं तो उनका पतिव्रत और स्त्रीव्रत धर्म नष्ट हो जाएगा।<br />
(4) विधवा स्त्री के साथ कोई कुंवारा पुरुष और विधुर पुरुष के साथ कोई कुंवारी कन्या विवाह न करेगी। अगर कोई ऐसा करता है तो यह अन्याय और अधर्म होगा। ऐसी स्थिति में पुरुष और स्त्री को नियोग की आवश्यकता होगी और यही धर्म है। (4-134)<br />
किसी ने स्वामी जी से सवाल किया कि अगर स्त्री अथवा पुरुष में से किसी एक की मृत्यु हो जाती है और उनके कोई संतान भी नहीं है तब अगर पुनर्विवाह न हो तो उनका कुल नष्ट हो जाएगा। पुनर्विवाह न होने की स्थिति में व्यभिचार और गर्भपात आदि बहुत से दुष्ट कर्म होंगे। इसलिए पुनर्विवाह होना अच्छा है। (4-122)<br />
जवाब दिया गया कि ऐसी स्थिति में स्त्री और पुरुष ब्रह्मचर्य में स्थित रहे और वंश परंपरा के लिए स्वजाति का लड़का गोद ले लें। इससे कुल भी चलेगा और व्यभिचार भी न होगा और अगर ब्रह्मचारी न रह सके तो नियोग से संतानोत्पत्ति कर ले। पुनर्विवाह कभी न करें। आइए अब देखते हैं कि ‘नियोग’ क्या है ?<br />
अगर किसी पुरुष की स्त्री मर गई है और उसके कोई संतान नहीं है तो वह पुरुष किसी नियुक्त विधवा स्त्री से यौन संबंध स्थापित कर संतान उत्पन्न कर सकता है। गर्भ स्थिति के निश्चय हो जाने पर नियुक्त स्त्री और पुरुष के संबंध खत्म हो जाएंगे और नियुक्ता स्त्री दो-तीन वर्ष तक लड़के का पालन करके नियुक्त पुरुष को दे देगी। ऐसे एक विधवा स्त्री दो अपने लिए और दो-दो चार अन्य पुरुषों के लिए अर्थात कुल 10 पुत्र उत्पन्न कर सकती है। (यहाँ यह स्पष्ट नहीं किया गया है कि यदि कन्या उत्पन्न होती है तो नियोग की क्या ‘शर्ते रहेगी ?) इसी प्रकार एक विधुर दो अपने लिए और दो-दो चार अन्य विधवाओं के लिए पुत्र उत्पन्न कर सकता है। ऐसे मिलकर 10-10 संतानोत्पत्ति की आज्ञा वेद में है।<br />
इमां त्वमिन्द्र मीढ्वः सुपुत्रां सुभगां कृणु।<br />
दशास्यां पुत्राना धेहि पतिमेकादशं कृधि।<br />
(ऋग्वेद 10-85-45)<br />
भावार्थ ः ‘‘हे वीर्य सेचन हार ‘शक्तिशाली वर! तू इस विवाहित स्त्री या विधवा स्त्रियों को श्रेष्ठ पुत्र और सौभाग्य युक्त कर। इस विवाहित स्त्री से दस पुत्र उत्पन्न कर और ग्यारहवीं स्त्री को मान। हे स्त्री! तू भी विवाहित पुरुष या नियुक्त पुरुषों से दस संतान उत्पन्न कर और ग्यारहवें पति को समझ।’’ (4-125)<br />
वेद की आज्ञा है कि ब्राह्मण, क्षत्रिय और वैश्य वर्णस्थ स्त्री और पुरुष दस से अधिक संतान उत्पन्न न करें, क्योंकि अधिक करने से संतान निर्बल, निर्बुद्धि और अल्पायु होती है। जैसा कि उक्त मंत्र से स्पष्ट है कि नियोग की व्यवस्था केवल विधवा और विधुर स्त्री और पुरुषों के लिए नहीं है बल्कि पति के जीते जी पत्नी और पत्नी के जीते जी पुरुष इसका भरपूर लाभ उठा सकते हैं। (4-143)<br />
आ घा ता गच्छानुत्तरा युगानि यत्र जामयः कृराावन्नजामि।<br />
उप बर्बृहि वृषभाय बाहुमन्यमिच्छस्व सुभगे पति मत्।<br />
(ऋग्वेद 10-10-10)<br />
भावार्थ ः ‘‘नपुंसक पति कहता है कि हे देवि! तू मुझ से संतानोत्पत्ति की आशा मत कर। हे सौभाग्यशालिनी! तू किसी वीर्यवान पुरुष के बाहु का सहारा ले। तू मुझ को छोड़कर अन्य पति की इच्छा कर।’’<br />
इसी प्रकार संतानोत्पत्ति में असमर्थ स्त्री भी अपने पति महाशय को आज्ञा दे कि हे स्वामी! आप संतानोत्पत्ति की इच्छा मुझ से छोड़कर किसी दूसरी विधवा स्त्री से नियोग करके संतानोत्पत्ति कीजिए।<br />
अगर किसी स्त्री का पति व्यापार आदि के लिए परदेश गया हो तो तीन वर्ष, विद्या के लिए गया हो तो छह वर्ष और अगर धर्म के लिए गया हो तो आठ वर्ष इंतजार कर वह स्त्री भी नियोग द्वारा संतान उत्पन्न कर सकती है। ऐसे ही कुछ नियम पुरुषों के लिए हैं कि अगर संतान न हो तो आठवें, संतान होकर मर जाए तो दसवें और कन्या ही हो तो ग्यारहवें वर्ष अन्य स्त्री से नियोग द्वारा संतान उत्पन्न कर सकता है। पुरुष अप्रिय बोलने वाली पत्नी को छोड़कर दूसरी स्त्री से नियोग का लाभ ले सकता है। ऐसा ही नियम स्त्री के लिए है। (4-145)<br />
प्रश्न सं0 149 में लिखा है कि अगर स्त्री गर्भवती हो और पुरुष से न रहा जाए और पुरुष दीर्घरोगी हो और स्त्री से न रहा जाए तो ऐसी स्थिति में दोनों किसी से नियोग कर पुत्रोत्पत्ति कर ले, परन्तु वेश्यागमन अथवा व्यभिचार कभी न करें। (4-149)<br />
लिखा है कि नियोग अपने वर्ण में अथवा उत्तम वर्ण और जाति में होना चाहिए। एक स्त्री 10 पुरुषों तक और एक पुरुष 10 स्त्रियों तक से नियोग कर सकता है। अगर कोई स्त्री अथवा पुरुष 10वें गर्भ से अधिक समागम करे तो कामी और निंदित होते हैं। (4-142) विवाहित पुरुष कुंवारी कन्या से और विवाहित स्त्री कुंवारे पुरुष से नियोग नहीं कर सकती।<br />
पुनर्विवाह और नियोग से संबंधित कुछ नियम, कानून, ‘शर्ते और सिद्धांत आपने पढ़े जिनका प्रतिपादन स्वामी दयानंद ने किया है और जिनको कथित लेखक ने वेद, मनुस्मृति आदि ग्रंथों से सत्य, प्रमाणित और न्यायोचित भी साबित किया है। व्यावहारिक पुष्टि हेतु कुछ ऐतिहासिक प्रमाण भी कथित लेखक ने प्रस्तुत किए हैं और साथ-साथ नियोग की खूबियां भी बयान की हैं। इस कुप्रथा को धर्मानुकूल और न्यायोचित साबित करने के लिए लेखक ने बौद्धिकता और तार्किकता का भी सहारा लिया है। कथित सुधारक ने आज के वातावरण में भी पुनर्विवाह को दोषपूर्ण और नियोग को तर्कसंगत और उचित ठहराया है। आइए उक्त धारणा का तथ्यपरक विश्लेषण करते हैं।<br />
ऊपर (4-134) में पुनर्विवाह के जो दोष स्वामी दयानंद ने गिनवाए हैं वे सभी हास्यास्पद, बचकाने और मूर्खतापूर्ण हैं। विद्वान लेखक ने जैसा लिखा है कि दूसरा विवाह करने से स्त्री का पतिव्रत धर्म और पुरुष का स्त्रीव्रत धर्म नष्ट हो जाता है परन्तु नियोग करने से दोनों का उक्त धर्म ‘ाुद्ध और सुरक्षित रहता है। क्या यह तर्क मूर्खतापूर्ण नहीं है ? आख़िर वह कैसा पतिव्रत धर्म है जो पुनर्विवाह करने से तो नष्ट और भ्रष्ट हो जाएगा और 10 गैर पुरुषों से यौन संबंध बनाने से सुरक्षित और निर्दोष रहेगा ?<br />
अगर किसी पुरुष की पत्नी जीवित है और किसी कारण पुरुष संतान उत्पन्न करने में असमर्थ है तो इसका मतलब यह तो हरगिज़ नहीं है कि उस पुरुष में काम इच्छा ;ैमगनंस कमेपतम) नहीं है। अगर पुरुष के अन्दर काम इच्छा तो है मगर संतान उत्पन्न नहीं हो रही है और उसकी पत्नी संतान के लिए किसी अन्य पुरुष से नियोग करती है तो ऐसी स्थिति में पुरुष अपनी काम तृप्ति कहाँ और कैसे करेगा ? यहाँ यह भी विचारणीय है कि नियोग प्रथा में हर जगह पुत्रोत्पत्ति की बात कही गई है, जबकि जीव विज्ञान के अनुसार 50 प्रतिशत संभावना कन्या जन्म की होती है। कन्या उत्पन्न होने की स्थिति में नियोग के क्या नियम, कानून और ‘शर्ते होंगी, यह स्पष्ट नहीं किया गया है ?<br />
जैसा कि स्वामी जी ने कहा है कि अगर किसी स्त्री के बार-बार कन्या ही उत्पन्न हो तो भी पुरुष नियोग द्वारा पुत्र उत्पन्न कर सकता है। यहाँ यह तथ्य विचारणीय है कि अगर किसी स्त्री के बार-बार कन्या ही उत्पन्न हो तो इसके लिए स्त्री नहीं, पुरुष जिम्मेदार है। यह एक वैज्ञानिक तथ्य है कि मानव जाति में लिंग का निर्धारण नर द्वारा होता है न कि मादा द्वारा।<br />
यह भी एक तथ्य है कि पुनर्विवाह के दोष और हानियाँ तथा नियोग के गुण और लाभ का उल्लेख केवल द्विज वर्णों, ब्राह्मण, क्षत्रिय और वैश्य के लिए किया गया है। चैथे वर्ण ‘शूद्र को छोड़ दिया गया है। क्या ‘शुद्रों के लिए नियोग की अनुमति नहीं है ? क्या ‘शूद्रों के लिए नियोग की व्यवस्था दोषपूर्ण और पाप है ?<br />
जैसा कि लिखा है कि अगर पत्नी अथवा पति अप्रिय बोले तो भी वे नियोग कर सकते हैं। अगर किसी पुरुष की पत्नी गर्भवती हो और पुरुष से न रहा जाए अथवा पति दीर्घरोगी हो और स्त्री से न रहा जाए तो दोनों कहीं उचित साथी देखकर नियोग कर सकते हैं। क्या यहाँ सारे नियमों और नैतिक मान्यताओं को लॉकअप में बन्द नहीं कर दिया गया है ? क्या नियोग का मतलब स्वच्छंद यौन संबंधों ;ैमग थ्तमम) से नहीं है ? क्या इससे निम्न और घटिया किसी समाज की कल्पना की जा सकती है?<br />
कथित विद्वान लेखक ने नियोग प्रथा की सत्यता, प्रमाणिकता और व्यावहारिकता की पुष्टि के लिए महाभारत कालीन सभ्यता के दो उदाहरण प्रस्तुत किए हैं। लिखा है कि व्यास जी ने चित्रांगद और विचित्र वीर्य के मर जाने के बाद उनकी स्त्रियों से नियोग द्वारा संतान उत्पन्न की। अम्बिका से धृतराष्ट्र, अम्बालिका से पाण्डु और एक दासी से विदुर की उत्पत्ति नियोग प्रक्रिया द्वारा हुई। दूसरा उदाहरण पाण्डु राजा की स्त्री कुंती और माद्री का है। पाण्डु के असमर्थ होने के कारण दोनों स्त्रियों ने नियोग विधि से संतान उत्पन्न की। इतिहास भी इस बात का प्रमाण है।<br />
जहाँ तक उक्त ऐतिहासिक तथ्यों की बात है महाभारत कालीन सभ्यता में नियोग की तो क्या बात कुंवारी कन्या से संतान उत्पन्न करना भी मान्य और सम्मानीय था। वेद व्यास और भीष्म पितामह दोनों विद्वान महापुरुषों की उत्पत्ति इस बात का ठोस सबूत है। दूसरी बात महाभारत कालीन समाज में एक स्त्री पांच सगे भाईयों की धर्मपत्नी हो सकती थी। पांडव पत्नी द्रौपदी इस बात का ठोस सबूत है। तीसरी बात महाभारत कालीन समाज में तो बिना स्त्री संसर्ग के केवल पुरुष ही बच्चें पैदा करने में समर्थ होता था।<br />
महाभारत का मुख्य पात्र गुरु द्रोणाचार्य की उत्पत्ति उक्त बात का सबूत है। चैथी बात महाभारतकाल में तो चमत्कारिक तरीके से भी बच्चें पैदा होते थे। पांचाली द्रौपदी की उत्पत्ति इस बात का जीता-जागता सबूत है। अतः उक्त समाज में नियोग की क्या आवश्यकता थी ? यहाँ यह भी विचारणीय है कि व्यास जी ने किस नियमों के अंतर्गत नियोग किया ? दूसरी बात नियोग किया तो एक ही समय में तीन स्त्रियों से क्यों किया? तीसरी बात यह कि एक मुनि ने निम्न वर्ण की दासी के साथ क्यों समागम किया ? चैथी बात यह कि कुंती ने नियम के विपरीत नियोग विधि से चार पुत्रों को जन्म क्यों दिया ? विदित रहे कि कुंती ने कर्ण, युधिष्ठिर, भीम और अर्जुन चार पुत्रों को जन्म दिया और ये सभी पाण्डु कहलाए। पांचवी बात यह कि जब उस समाज में नियोग प्रथा निर्दोष और मान्य थी तो फिर कुंती ने लोक लाज के डर से कर्ण को नदी में क्यों बहा दिया ? छठी बात यह है कि वे पुरुष कौन थे जिन्होंने कुंती से नियोग द्वारा संतान उत्पन्न की ? स्वामी जी ने बहुविवाह का निषेध किया है जबकि उक्त सभ्यता में बहुविवाह होते थे। अब क्या जिस समाज से स्वामी जी ने नियोग के प्रमाण दिए हैं, उस समाज को एक उच्च और आदर्श वैदिक समाज माना जाए ?<br />
‘सत्यार्थ प्रकाश’ के ‘शंका-समाधान परिशिष्ट में पं0 ज्वालाप्रसाद ‘ार्मा द्वारा नियोग प्रथा के समर्थन में अनेक प्रमाण प्रस्तुत किए हैं। लिखा है कि प्राचीन वैदिक काल में कुलनाश के भय से ऋषि-मुनि, विद्वान, महापुरुषों से नियोग द्वारा वीर्य ग्रहण कर उच्च कुल की स्त्रियां संतान उत्पन्न करती थी। जो प्रमाण पंडित जी ने प्रस्तुत किए हैं वे सभी महाभारत काल के हैं। क्या महाभारत काल ही प्राचीन वैदिक काल था ? क्या नियोग ही ऋषियों का एक मात्र प्रयोजन था?<br />
यहाँ यह तथ्य भी विचारणीय है कि अगर स्वामी दयानंद सरस्वती नियोग को एक वेद प्रतिपादित और स्थापित व्यवस्था मानते थे तो उन्होंने इस परंपरा का खुद पालन करके अपने अनुयायियों के लिए आदर्श प्रस्तुत क्यों नहीं किया ? इससे स्वामी जी के चरित्र को भी बल मिलता और एक मृत प्रायः हो चुकी वैदिक परंपरा पुनः जीवित हो जाती। यह भी एक अजीब विडंबना है कि जिस वैदिक मंत्र से स्वामी जी ने नियोग परंपरा को प्रतिपादित किया है उसी मंत्र से अन्य वेद विद्वानों और भाष्यकारों ने विधवा पुनर्विवाह का प्रतिपादन किया है। निम्न मंत्र देखिए &#8211;<br />
‘‘कुह स्विद्दोषा कुह वस्तोरश्विना कुहाभिपित्वं करतः कुहोषतुः।<br />
को वां ‘ात्रुया विधवेव देवरं मंर्य न योषा कृणुते सधस्य आ।।<br />
(ऋग्वेद, 10-40-2)<br />
‘‘उदीष्र्व नार्यभिजीवलोकं गतासुमेतमुप ‘ोष एहि।<br />
हस्तग्राभस्य दिधिशोस्तवेदं पत्युर्जनित्वमभि सं बभूथ।।’’<br />
(ऋग्वेद, 10-18-8)<br />
उक्त दोनों मंत्रों से जहाँ स्वामी दयानंद सरस्वती ने नियोग प्रथा का भावार्थ निकाला है वहीं ओमप्रकाश पाण्डेय ने इन्हीं मंत्रों का उल्लेख विधवा पुनर्विवाह के समर्थन में किया है। अपनी पुस्तक ‘‘वैदिक साहित्य और संस्कृति का स्वरूप’’ में उन्होंने लिखा है कि वेदकालीन समाज में विधवा स्त्रियों को पुनर्विवाह की अनुमति प्राप्त थी। उक्त मंत्र (10-18-8) का भावार्थ उन्होंने निम्न प्रकार किया है &#8211;<br />
‘‘हे नारी ! इस मृत पति को छोड़कर पुनः जीवितों के समूह में पदार्पण करो। तुमसे विवाह के लिए इच्छुक जो तुम्हारा दूसरा भावी पति है, उसे स्वीकार करो।’’<br />
इसी मंत्र का भावार्थ वैद्यनाथ ‘शास्त्री द्वारा निम्न प्रकार किया गया है &#8211;<br />
‘‘जब कोई स्त्री जो संतान आदि करने में समर्थ है, विधवा हो जाती है तब वह नियुक्त पति के साथ संतान उत्पत्ति के लिए नियोग कर सकती है।’’<br />
उक्त मंत्रों में स्वामी दयानंद ने देवर ‘शब्द का अर्थ जहाँ ‘द्वितीय नियुक्त पति’ लिया है वहीं पाण्डेय जी ने देवर ‘शब्द का अर्थ ‘द्वितीय विवाहित पति’ लिया है। निरुक्त के संदर्भ में पाण्डेय जी ने लिखा है कि यास्क ने अपने निरूक्त में देवर ‘शब्द का निर्वचन ‘द्वितीय वर’ के रूप में ही किया है। उक्त मंत्रों के साथ पाण्डेय जी ने अथर्ववेद का भी एक मंत्र विधवा पुनर्विवाह के समर्थन में प्रस्तुत किया है। जो निम्न है &#8211;<br />
‘‘या पूर्वं पतिं वित्त्वाथान्यं विन्दते परम्।<br />
पत्र्चैदनं च तावजं ददातो न वि योषतः।।<br />
समानलोको भवति पुनर्भुवापरः पतिः।<br />
योऽजं पत्र्चैदनं दक्षिणाज्योतिषं ददाति।।’’<br />
(अथर्वसंहिता 9-5-27,28)<br />
उक्त से स्पष्ट है कि वेद भाष्यों में इतना अधिक अर्थ भेद और मतभेद पाया जाता है कि सत्य और विश्वसनीय धारणाओं का निर्णय करना अत्यंत मुश्किल काम है? यहाँ यह भी विचारणीय है कि विवाह का उद्देश्य केवल संतानोत्पत्ति करना ही नहीं होता बल्कि स्वच्छंद यौन संबंध को रोकना और भावों को संयमित करना भी है। यहाँ यह भी विचारणीय है कि जो विषय (नारी और सेक्स) एक बाल ब्रह्मचारी के लिए कतई निषिद्ध था, स्वामी जी ने उसे भी अपनी चर्चा और लेखनी का विषय बनाया है।<br />
बेहद अफसोस और दुःख का विषय है कि जहाँ एक विद्वान और समाज सुधारक को पुनर्विवाह और विधवा विवाह का समर्थन करना चाहिए था, वहाँ कथित समाज सुधारक द्वारा नियोग प्रथा की वकालत की गई है और इसे वर्तमान काल के लिए भी उपयुक्त बताया है। क्या यह एक विद्वान की घटिया मनोवृत्ति का प्रतीक नहीं है ? आज की फिल्में जो कतई निम्न स्तर का प्रदर्शन करती हैं, उनमें भी कहीं इस प्रथा का प्रदर्शन और समर्थन देखने को नहीं मिलता। स्वामी दयानंद को छोड़कर नवजागरण के सभी विद्वानों और सुधारकों द्वारा विधवा पुनर्विवाह का समर्थन किया गया है।<br />
जब किसी कौम या समाज के धार्मिक लोग जघन्य नैतिक बुराइयों और बिगाड़ में गर्क हो जाते हैं, तो वह कौम नैतिक पतन की पराकाष्ठा को पहुंच जाती है। नैतिक बुराइयों में निमग्न होने के बावजूद कथित धार्मिक लोग अपने बचाव और समाज में अपना स्तर और आदर-सम्मान बनाए रखने के लिए और साथ-साथ अपने को सही और सदाचारी साबित करने के लिए उपाय तलाशते हैं। अपने बचाव के लिए कथित मक्कार लोग अपनी धार्मिक पुस्तकों से छेड़छाड़ करते हैं और उनमें फेरबदल कर उस नैतिक बुराई को जो उनमें है, अपने देवताओं, अवतारों, ऋषियों, मुनियों और आदर्शों से जोड़ देते हैं और जनसाधारण को यह समझाकर अपने बचाव का रास्ता निकाल लेते हैं कि यह बुराई नहीं है बल्कि धर्मानुकूल है। ऐसा तो हमारे ऋषि-मुनियों और महापुरुषों ने भी किया है। नियोग के विषय में भी मुझे ऐसा ही प्रतीत होता है। जब कौम में स्वच्छंद यौन संबंधों की अधिकता हो गई और जो बुराई थी, वह सामाजिक रस्म और रिवाज बन गई तो मक्कार लोगों ने उस बुराई को अच्छाई बनाकर अपने धार्मिक ग्रंथों में प्रक्षेपित कर दिया। प्राचीन काल में धार्मिक ग्रंथों में परिवर्तन करना आसान था, क्योंकि धार्मिक ग्रंथों पर चन्द लोगों का अधिकार होता था। नियोग एक गर्हित और गंदी परंपरा है, इसे किसी भी काल के लिए उचित नहीं कहा जा सकता।<br />
भारतीय चिंतन में नारी की स्थिति अत्यंत दयनीय प्रतीत होती है। ऐसा प्रतीत होता है कि ऋषि, मुनियों और महापुरुषों द्वारा कुछ ऐसे नियम-कानून बनाए गए, जिन्होंने नारी को भोग की वस्तु और नाश्ते की प्लेट बना दिया। नियोग प्रथा ने विधवा स्त्री को कतई वेश्या ही बना दिया। जैसा कि आप ऊपर पढ़ चुके हैं कि एक विधवा 10 पुरुषों से नियोग कर सकती है। यहाँ विधवा और वेश्या ‘शब्दों को एक अर्थ में ले लिया जाए तो ‘शायद अनुचित न होगा। विधवाओं की दुर्दशा को चित्रित करने वाली एक फिल्म ‘वाटर’ सन् 2000 में विवादों के कारण प्रतिबंधित कर दी गई थी, जिसमें ऐतिहासिक तथ्यों के आधार पर विधवाओं को वेश्याओं के रूप में दिखाया गया था। प्रायः विधवा स्त्रियाँ काशी, वृन्दावन आदि तीर्थस्थानों में आकर मंदिरों में भजन-कीर्तन करके और भीख मांगकर अपनी गुजर बसर करती थी, क्योंकि समाज में उनको अशुभ और अनिष्ट सूचक समझा जाता था।<br />
‘सत्यार्थ प्रकाश’ में स्वामी जी ने भी इस दशा का वर्णन करते हुए लिखा है- ‘‘वृंदावन जब था तब था अब तो वेश्यावनवत्, लल्ला-लल्ली और गुरु-चेली आदि की लीला फैल रही है। (11-159), आज भी काशी में लगभग 16000 विधवाएं रहती हैं।<br />
‘मनुस्मृति’ में विवाह के आठ प्रकार बताए गए हैं। (3-21) इनमें आर्ष, आसुर और गान्धर्व विवाह को निकृष्ट बताया गया है मगर ऋषियों, मुनियों, तपस्वियों और मर्मज्ञों ने इनका भरपूर फायदा उठाया। ब्रह्मर्षि विश्वामित्र, मुनि पराशर, कौरवों-पांडवों के पूर्वज ‘ाान्तनु, पाण्डु पुत्र अर्जुन और भीम आदि ने उक्त प्रकार के विवाहों की आड़ में नारी के साथ क्या किया ? इसका वर्णन भारतीय ग्रंथों में मिलता है।<br />
भारतीय ग्रंथों में नारी को किस रूप में दर्शाया गया है आइए अति संक्षेप में इस पर भी एक दृष्टि डाल लेते हैं।<br />
1. ‘‘ढिठाई, अति ढिठाई और कटुवचन कहना, ये स्त्री के रूप हैं। जो जानकार हैं वह इन्हें ‘ाुद्ध करता है।’’ (ऋग्वेद, 10-85-36)<br />
2. ‘‘सर्वगुण सम्पन्न नारी अधम पुरुष से हीन है।’’<br />
(तैत्तिरीय संहिता, 6-5-8-2)<br />
3. नारी जन्म से अपवित्र, पापी और मूर्ख है।’’ (रामचरितमानस)<br />
उक्त तथ्यों के आधार पर भारतीय चिंतन में नारी की स्थिति और दशा का आकलन हम भली-भांति कर सकते हैं। भारतीय ग्रंथों में नारी की स्थिति दमन, दासता और भोग की वस्तु से अधिक दिखाई नहीं पड़ती। यहाँ यह भी विचारणीय है कि क्या आधुनिक भारतीय नारी चिंतकों की सोच अपने ग्रंथों से हटकर हो सकती है ? आइए भारतीय संस्कृति में नारी की दशा का आकलन करने के लिए छांदोग्य उपनिषद् के एक मुख्य प्रसंग पर भी दृष्टि डाल लेते हैं।<br />
नाहमेतद्वेद तात यद्गोत्रस्त्वमसि, बह्वहं चरन्ती<br />
परिचारिणी यौवने त्वामलमे साहमेतन्न वेद यद्<br />
गोत्रत्वमसि, जाबाला तु नामाहमस्मि सत्यकामो नाम<br />
त्वमसि स सत्यकाम एव जाबालो ब्रुवीथा इति।<br />
(छांदोग्य उपनिषद् 4-4-2)<br />
यह प्रसंग सत्यकाम का है। जिसकी माता का नाम जबाला था। सत्यकाम गौतम ऋषि के यहाँ विद्या सीखना चाहता था। जब वह घर से जाने लगा, तब उसने अपनी माँ से पूछा ‘‘माता मैं किस गोत्र का हूँ ?’’ उसकी माँ ने उससे कहा, ‘‘बेटा मैं नहीं जानती तू किस गोत्र का है। अपनी युवावस्था में, जब मैं अपने पिता के घर आए हुए बहुत से अतिथियों की सेवा में रहती थी, उस समय तू मेरे गर्भ में आया था। मैं नहीं जानती तेरा गोत्र क्या है ? मेरा नाम जबाला है, तू सत्यकाम है, अपने को सत्यकाम जबाला बताना।’’<br />
क्या उपरोक्त उद्धरणों से तथ्यात्मक रूप से यह बात साबित नहीं होती कि भारतीय चिंतन में नारी को न केवल निम्न और भोग की वस्तु बल्कि नाश्ते की प्लेट समझा गया है ?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">Written by Kancha Ilaiah<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">Rape has, of late, become an acute disease in the Indian society. Prima facie, this is a problem arising out of a mental disorder, but there is also a larger cultural context that, to an extent, explains how the Indian male became so brutal.<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">Our cultural upbringing conditions male minds to behave in a cruel fashion with women. Family upbringing, societal conditioning, religious sagas and political animus, all construct our men and women into being what they are — men as aggressive and women as submissive. Which is why men here, in India, are different from men in other countries.<br />
</span><br />
<span id="more-961"></span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">Their cultural milieu is different. Their spiritual systems train them differently. It&#8217;s not that only Indian men rape and kill children aged three or five. This happens in other countries too, but they are the rarest of rare cases. Daily reports of infants being raped across the length and breadth of a country is a phenomenon unique to India, a society that&#8217;s otherwise highly conservative. Clearly, the institutional upbringing, including that in family, needs to undergo change.<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">Every time a gruesome rape gets reported, we all are ashamed and angry. That&#8217;s one thing; but working out ways and means to eradicate such evil is another thing. We cannot leave it entirely to the police or the judiciary to tackle such heinous acts. For, rape is also a cultural problem; and it is a more serious problem because of the extermination of the victim. We need to treat the malaise from its very roots.<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">We are a society that derives its sense of good and bad from our mythologies and spiritual ethics. Our gods and goddesses are not only worshipped but also adored. And it is our lifelong endeavour to emulate them. This is the cultural environment that shapes the lives of most people in India. So it&#8217;s natural that what gods do influences us much more than the moral lesson at the end. Now consider this: we have gods who, for instance, have cut the nose and ear lobes of a woman who approached them professing her love (Lakshman is depicted as having done this to Shurpanakha), and yet we adore him and see him as a symbol of loyalty, sacrifice and righteous indignation.<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">Lord Krishna stole the clothes of women while they were bathing in the Yamuna river. He did so to tease them and for the pleasure of watching the beauty of their naked bodies. We hang miniature paintings of the same act in our homes proudly. The young men who grow up seeing this, or listening to the story told in an amused tone are bound to not find such an act abhorrent.<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">We also have a god, Shiva, who insisted on entering the bathing arena of Goddess Parvati and did so by eliminating a child who was keeping guard at the open door. Lord Ganesha is said to have emerged out of such a union. Is this right or wrong? Our mythology tells us that what a husband does is right, that his will is greater than the woman&#8217;s. If a mythological hero is praised for his acts of killing, drinking and fornicating with multiple women (like Indra did with Rambha, Urvashi, Menaka, Tilottama and so on), it is glorification of such behaviour.<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">When such stories are a part of the mythological texts, they should, at least, be critically evaluated and given a more contemporary, political reading which is rooted in the concept of equality. Instead, the tendency is to not question what our gods did, but simply admire such acts.<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">Barring a few exceptions, there is no appreciation, per se, of a healthy man-woman relationship which is rooted in the concept of equality. Indian women are shown as lathangi (a person of delicate body), never strong enough to resist her dehumanisation. Though Durga and Kali are shown as strong, in real life such militancy is not seen as feminine.<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">Now let us turn to the political spectrum. We have had many great men — Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan etc — who got married at a young age with girls of much younger age, went abroad for higher studies, leaving their wives at home totally illiterate or semi-literate. We do not know how these men, or Gokhale and Tilak, treated their wives.<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">But we know that they were all devotees of the deities mentioned above. The only man who treated his wife as a friend and educated her right from the first day of his marriage, Mahatma Jyotirao Phule, is not taught as an example to be emulated in our texts.  Somehow, in our patriarchal cultural milieu, unkind and inhuman treatment of women has never been a matter of concern. It&#8217;s considered sacrilegious, for example, to question Lord Ram for leaving his dutiful wife on the random outburst of a dhobi.<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">And Sita&#8217;s action, in turn, to not question, but to commit suicide, is considered the epitome of all that is pious. Even Gautam Buddha left his young wife, with an infant child. Questioning such acts has never been part of our public discourse.<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">Or, look at our cinemas. Ever since the industry came into being, silent or talkie, it has used woman&#8217;s body as a money-making object. The song and dance sequence that it has adopted as an art form falls into a common pattern — every hero is licensed to misuse the body of the heroine. The romance in our film industry is not romance; it is vulgarity bordering on the criminal.<br />
So is it a surprise that men of this country see it as their right to violate women in all spheres of life?<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>by Sulaiman Razvi<br />
Does Hinduism allow widow remarriage? To be simple and short the answer is No, Hinduism doesn&#8217;t allow widow remarriage. But it would be improper to come to the conclusion without discussing the sources. Though the Indian constitution allows widow remarriage but it is nowhere to be found in the Hindu scripture. The status of widows in India has been miserable. Woman&#8217;s head was shaved off after the demise of her husband, she would be forced to live a degraded life. But all these things are much better than the evil Vedic practise called Sati Pratha. The widow had to immolate herself after her husband&#8217;s death. This inhumane Vedic practise is a disgrace to humanity. Fortunately this practise was banned by the Mughals, later by the Britishers and presently by the Government of India. The condition of a widow in ancient India was disgusting it is mentioned in Baudhyana Sutra,<br />
<span id="more-2108"></span><br />
Baudhyana Dharma Sutra 2.2.4.7-9 A widow shall avoid during a year (the use of) honey, meat spirituous liquor, and salt, and sleep on the ground. Maudgalya (declares that she shall do so) during six months.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s have a look at what Hindu scriptures has to say about widow remarriage.</p>
<p>Rishi Dirghatama said,<br />
Mahabharata 1.104.31-32 Dirghatamas [Rishi] said, &#8216;I lay down from this day as a rule that every woman shall have to <span style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;">adhere to one husband for her life. Be the husband dead or alive</span>, it shall not be lawful for a woman to have connection with another. And she who may have such connection shall certainly be regarded as fallen. A woman without husband shall always be liable to be sinful.</p>
<p>Mahabharata 1.160 There is no sin in this. For a man polygamy is an act of merit, but for a woman it is very sinful to betake herself to a second husband after the first.</p>
<p>Garuda Purana ch 95 &#8221;A girl should be given only once in marriage&#8230;&#8221;Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Vamana Purana 12.85 &#8220;Those who remarry widows and those that defiles unmarried girls, and the ancestors of the offsprings of such unions are made to eat worms and ants.&#8221; Tr. Anand Swarup Gupta</p>
<p>Skanda Purana III.ii.21.15-17 &#8220;It is mentioned by Kasyapa that these burn the family like fire: The daughter of a widow who marries again should be always avoided. She is the lowliest born&#8230;one who has gone round the fire and one who is a child of a widow remarried &#8211; all these burn the family like fires (says Kasyapa).&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Kurma Purana II.17.14 &#8220;One should particularly avoid the food served by a widowed woman who has remarried&#8230;&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Kurma Purana II.21.30 &#8220;Those who sell their sons, those who are born as sons of remarried widow, those who perform the Yajnas of even ordinary persons &#8211; all these are spoken of as fallen ones.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Sri Markandeya says in Skanda Purana<br />
Skanda Purana V.iii.85.64-70a &#8220;&#8230;If a remarried widow, Vrsali and Sudri frequent anyone&#8217;s abode, he (such a Brahmana) should be abandoned even from a distance by one who wishes for one&#8217;s welfare&#8230;&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Skanda Purana VII.I.167.35-36 &#8220;I shall narrate other means of sustenance of which the Bhutas are always fond. These are your permanent residences: the places where there are thorny trees, the creeper of Nispava (?), where someone&#8217;s wife (widowed?) marries again and where there is Valmika (an ant-hill).&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 9.47. Once is the partition (of the inheritance) made, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;">(once is) a maiden given in marriage</span></span>, (and) once does (a man) say,&#8217; I will give;&#8217; each of those three (acts is done) once only.</p>
<p>Chanakya Neeti Shastra 4.11 King speak for once, men of learning once, and t<span style="text-decoration: underline;">he daughter is given in marriage once</span>. All these things happen once and only once.</p>
<p>Brahan Naradiya Purana &#8221;The gift in remarriage to another of a girl once given away in marriage is prohibited in the Kaliyuga&#8221;</p>
<p>Yajnavalkya Smriti chapter 3, verse 52 &#8220;Without breaking (the rules) of studentship, let him marry a woman with auspicious characteristics who has not belonged to another man, who is lovely, who is not a Sapinda and who is younger (than himself).&#8221; Tr. Srisa Chandra Vasu</p>
<p>Vijnanesvara writes on this verse,<br />
&#8220;&#8230;Ananyapurvika (Not Anyapurvika), one who has not been accepted by any other man either by way of gift, or enjoyment.&#8221; Tr. Srisa Chanda Vasu</p>
<p>Balambhatta writes on this,<br />
&#8220;One should not marry a woman who has already been enjoyed by another person. Or, says Baudhayana that seven kinds of women are called Punarbhus:- &#8216;1. A bride already promised to another; 2. a bride who has already elected another mentally, 3. who has gone round the fire ceremony, 4. who has performed the seven steps ceremony, 5. who has enjoyed by another, 6. who is pregnant, and 7. who has given birth to a child before marriage. By marrying these seven kinds of girls, the debt one owes to his ancestors is not discharged, nor is the offspring legal.&#8217; <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;">The first two sorts of bride may be re-married, if there is some defect in the bridegroom</span></span>.&#8221; Tr. Srisa Chandra Vasu</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some apologists use Yajnavalkya 1.67 about remarried woman being called Punarbhu as a proof for remarriage. Yajnavalkya is not permitting remarriage of woman it is merely stating types of wives hence it cannot be taken as a proof for remarriage of women in Yajnavalkya.</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 9.65 In the sacred texts which refer to marriage the appointment (of widows) is nowhere mentioned, <span style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;">nor is the re-marriage of widows prescribed in the rules concerning marriage</span>.</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 5.157 At her pleasure let her emaciate her body by (living on) pure flowers, roots, and fruit; but she must never even mention the name of another man after her husband has died.</p>
<p>Hinduism prohibits widow remarriage but encourages the remarriage of a widower,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 5.168 Having thus, at the funeral, given the sacred fires to his wife who dies before him, he may marry again, and again kindle (the fires).</p>
<p>Padma Purana states that one must avoid the food of a widow who is remarried,<br />
Padma Purana III.56.4-15 &#8220;&#8230;(He should avoid) the food of women having no children&#8230;(He should) especially (avoid) the food of a widow who is remarried, so also of the husband of a woman who is married twice&#8230;&#8221; Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p>Usana Smriti censures those who marry widows,<br />
Usana Samhita 4.23-30 &#8220;The following are disqualified to be present at the Sraddha ceremony:- Those, who sell the Sruti; those who marry widows; those, who enter in to a locked room without the permission of the owner; and those, who officiate as priests for inferior castes; are described as out-castes.&#8221; Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt<br />
It is mentioned in Agni Purana that the wife who practices self-restraint and also the one who immolates herself after her husband&#8217;s death goes to the heaven,</p>
<p>Agni Purana 222.19-23 &#8220;…The widow who practices self-control and austerities after the death of her husband, goes to heaven…the widow who burns herself on the same funeral pire with her husband also goes to heaven.&#8221; Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Same is said in Vishnu Smriti also,<br />
Vishnu Smriti 25.14 After the death of her husband, to preserve her chastity, <span style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;">or to ascend the pile after him</span>.<br />
The widow either has to lead a chaste life after the death of her husband or mount his pyre. But why should only women has this option? Why doesn&#8217;t Hindu text say the same about a Widower, why shouldn&#8217;t a man enter the funeral pyre of his wife? Hindu apologists try their level best to present Hinduism in the best light. But their explanations can fool only the gullible Hindus who believe in everything they hear from their scholars without verifying it. The explanation cited by apologists is that,</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light">
<p style="text-align: center;">Hinduism permits widow remarriage when the husband is dead, when the husband has gone abroad and tidings of him have been obtained, when the husband has become a Sanyasi, when the husband is impotent, when the husband is excommunicated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is taken out of context. Apologist should honestly quote the circumstances when widow remarriage is permissible. As per Hindu texts remarriage of widows is allowed only if the marriage was not consummated.</p>
<p>Mahabharata 13.44.52 <span style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;">Some say that the virgin wife or widow,&#8211;one, that is, whose marriage has not been consummated with her husband by actual sexual congress in consequence of his absence or death</span>,&#8211;may be allowed to unite herself with her husband&#8217;s younger brother or such other relation. The husband dying before such consummation, the virgin-widow may either surrender herself to her husband&#8217;s younger brother or betake herself to the practice of penances.</p>
<p>It is mentioned in Sutras,<br />
Baudhyana Dharma Sutra 4.1.16 If, after (a damsel) has been given away, or even after (the nuptial sacrifice) have been offered, the husband dies, she who (thus) has left (her father&#8217;s house) and has returned, may be again wedded according to the rule applicable to second weddings, <span style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;">provided the marriage had not been consummated</span>.</p>
<p>Vasistha Dharma Shastra 17.74 &#8216;If a damsel at the death of her husband had been merely wedded by (the recitation of) sacred texts, and <span style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;">if the marriage had not been consummated, she may be married again</span>.&#8217;</p>
<p>It is mentioned in Manu Smriti that the virgin wife is worthy of being married again,<br />
Manu Smriti 9.176 If she be (still) a virgin, or one who returned (to her first husband) after leaving him, she is worthy to again perform with her second (or first deserted) husband the (nuptial) ceremony.</p>
<p>A impotent man cannot consummate the marriage, hence Sutras also allow remarriage of widows whose husband is impotent,<br />
Baudhayana Dharma Sutra, Prasna 2, Adhyaya 2, Kandika 3.27 He (is called the son) of a twice married woman (paunarbhava) who is born of a <span style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;">remarried female, (i,e.) of one who, having left an impotent man</span>, has taken a second husband.<br />
Swami Dayanand Saraswati was also of the same view but unlike Maharishi Manu, Dayanand prohibited remarriage of both man and woman,</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p>&#8221;Q ~Can one party re-marry when the other is dead? A. ~ Yes. Says the sage Manu on this subject &#8221; A man or a woman, who has simply gone through the ceremony of joining hands* but whose marriage has not been consummated, is entitled to re-marry.&#8221; MANU 9:179 But re-marriage is absolutely prohibited in the case of a twice born man or woman (i.e., one belonging to a Brahman, Kshatriya or Vaishya Class who has had sexual intercourse with his or her consort.&#8221;- Satyarth Prakash, Swami Dayanand Saraswati, Ch 4, p.129, Tr. Chiranjiva Bhardwaja.</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Markandeya Purana seems to prohibit marrying a virgin widow too,<br />
Markandeya Purana 14.82 Those men who have married virgin widows and have grown old to the full extent of life, these turned into worms are consumed by ants.</p>
<p>As we see, Dayanand a Vedic scholar was also against remarriage. Because Hindu text forbids widow remarriage and most important of all many Puranas prohibit widow remarriage in the Kali-Yuga.</p>

<p>Pedophilia in Hinduism (<strong>Updated</strong>)</p>
<p>Written by Sulaiman Razvi</p>
<p>Hinduism considers it a sin if the girl is not married before her puberty, it even says that forefathers of the girl shall drink blood of her monthly courses if she isn’t married before puberty. Hinduism also says that marriage of a girl before puberty sanctifies 21 generations. Marriage of a Brahmin man with a Shudra girl is censured and Brahmin man marrying a Shudra is considered Vrisalapati and it is considered on par with marrying a girl whose menses has started, a man marrying a girl whose menstruation has started is also considered Vrisalapati. A girl who lives in her father’s house even after her menses begins to appear is considered a degraded girl. Smritis and Puranas says that a 30 years old man shall marry a girl of 12. Swami Prabhupada <a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/conversations/1977/feb/mayapura/february/27/1977-1?d=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">said<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, “Even an eighty-years-old man can marry a sixteen-years-old girl.” This is how Hinduism encourages paedophilia. There is also evidence from Puranas to show that it was practised at the time it was composed. Child marriage and paedophilia was more prevalent in India before the Hindu law were codified. Despite making it illegal, child marriage is still practised,</p>

<p>Sexual assault on children is on the rise in India, According to the National Crime Records Bureau a total of 12,363 cases of child rape were reported in the country during 2013 as compared to 8,541 in 2012 accounting for an increase of 44.7%. The maximum child rape cases were reported in Madhya Pradesh (2,112 cases) followed by Maharashtra (1,546 cases) and Uttar Pradesh (1,381 cases). These three states together accounted for 40.8% of the total child rape cases reported in the country.<br />

<p>But as usual Hindus won’t admit evils which exists in their society or religion and rather puts the blame on Muslims. Hindus says that child marriage were introduced in India by the Muslim invaders. But this claim is refuted by their own scholar Swami Vivekananda who acknowledged that Hinduism permits paedophilia,</p>
<p>“…A girl of eight is married to a man of thirty, and the parents are jubilant over it…. And if anyone protests against it, the plea is put forward, “Our religion is being overturned.” What sort of religion have they who want to see their girls becoming mothers before they attain puberty even and offer scientific explanations for it? Many, again, lay the blame at the door of the Mohammedans. They are to blame, indeed! Just read the Grihya-Sutras through and see what is given as the marriageable age of a girl. … There it is expressly stated that a girl must be married before attaining puberty. The entire Grihya-Sutras enjoin this…” The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda, Volume 6/Epistles – Second Series/LXXI Rakhal [ <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Complete_Works_of_Swami_Vivekananda/Volume_6/Epistles_-_Second_Series/LXXI_Rakhal" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Complete_Works_of_Swami_Vivekananda/Volume_6/Epistles_-_Second_Series/LXXI_Rakhal<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> ]
<p>So now Hindus can’t deny that paedophilia is sanctioned by Hinduism and started because of Hinduism. Swami Prabhupada the founder of ISKCON wrote,</p>
<p>Swami Prabhupada writes,</p>
<p>”…As soon as a woman attains the age of puberty, she immediately becomes very much agitated by sexual desire. It is therefore the duty of the father to get his daughter married before she attains puberty…” A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada on Srimad Bhagavatam 4.25.42 [ <a href="http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_4.25.42" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_4.25.42<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> ]
<p>Another Hindu scholar Sadhguru hints at child marriage,</p>
<p>“It’s a tragic situation. We should realise that we are a society in transition. There was a time when girls would be married at 15. Now they are not married till 25 and 30. So this is the peak of their hormones. In our mindset we are in the past, but in our physical situation, we are in the present. What is causing these rapes? Humans have their needs. If you keep them suppressed, they will do something violent. We need to address this on a much larger scale – hanging rapists or putting them behind bars, that is not the solution. Yes, it needs to be done when it happens. But more importantly as a society, we need to understand why.” <a href="http://www.newindianexpress.com/education/edex/Seven-minutes-with-the-Sadhguru/2016/06/13/article3475994.ece" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">http://www.newindianexpress.com/education/edex/Seven-minutes-with-the-Sadhguru/2016/06/13/article3475994.ece <span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>Brahma Purana states that a girl should be given in marriage when she is only four years old,</p>
<p>Brahma Purana: Gautami Mahatmya 95.7 ”After the fourth year and before the completion of the tenth year the marriage of his daughter must be performed scrupulously by the father.” Tr. Board of Scholars, Edited by J.L. Shastri</p>

<h2><strong>Rama married six years old Sita</strong></h2>
<p>As per Valmiki Ramayana, Rama is said to have married Sita when she was 6 years old,</p>
<p>Valmiki Ramayana, Aranya Kanda 3, Sarga 47, Verses 3-5 “I am the daughter of noble-souled Janaka, the king of Mithila, by name I am Seetha, and the dear wife and queen of Rama, let safety betide you. On residing in the residence of Ikshvaku-s in Ayodhya for twelve years, I was in sumptuosity of all cherishes while relishing all humanly prosperities. In the thirteenth year the lordly king Dasharatha deliberated together with his imperial ministers to anoint Rama as Crown Prince of Ayodhya. When Raghava’s anointment was being organised my venerable mother-in-law known as Kaikeyi begged her husband Dasharatha for a boon. Restraining my veracious father-in-law by a good deed once done by her in his respect, Kaikeyi besought two boons from him, namely expatriation of my husband, and anointment of her son Bharata. ‘If Rama is anointed now, come what may I will not eat, sleep, or drink, and my life ends this way,’ thus Kaikeyi was adamantine, and the king and my father-in-law entreated her who is nagging with meaningful riches, but she did not make good on that entreaty. My great-resplendent husband was of twenty-five years of age at that time, and to me eighteen years are reckoned up from my birth.” Tr. Sri Desiraju Hanumantha Rao</p>
<p>If we do little maths here we understand that Sita was 18 years old when she went into exile with her husband and before the exile she had spent 12 years with her husband in the house of King Dashratha, so if we deduct the age of Sita at the time of exile (18 years of age) and number years she spent in the house of King Dasharath (i.e., 12 years) we get,<br />
18-12= 6 years old<br />
Sita after marrying at 6, lived in the palace of King Dashrath for 12 years. When she was sent to exile with her husband, she was 18 years old. The age difference between Rama and Sita was 7 years. Skanda Purana clearly states that Sita was married when she was only six years old,</p>
<p>Skanda Purana Book, III, Section 2, Chapter 30, Verses 8-9 “The bow of Isvara that was kept in the abode of Janaka, was broken. In his fifteenth year, O king, Rama married the six year old beautiful daughter of the king of Mithila, Sita who was not born of a womb. On getting Sita, Raghava became contented and happy.” Tr. Ganesh Vasudeo Tagare</p>
<p>Hindu scholars Ramswaroop Acharya Maharaj and Pandit Mahendra Pal Arya says Sita was married to Ram when she was 6 years old.</p>

<h2><strong>Krishna married eight years old Rukmini and many prepubescent girls</strong></h2>
<p>As per Puranas, Krishna is said to have married prepubescent Rukmini when she was only eight years old. Although Hindu text doesn’t mention the age of Krishna at the time of his marriage with Rukmini but the way Hindu text describes him shows that he was an adult at the time of his marriage with prepubescent Rukmini. And other Puranas also shows his sexual intercourse after marriage which is enough to prove that he was a fully grown man.</p>
<p>As per Skanda Purana when Rukmini was born an ethereal voice told her father Bhishmaka that she should be given in marriage to four-armed one born on earth. When Rukmini reached the age of eight her father became worried about her marriage and about the ethereal voice that commanded him to give his daughter in marriage to four-armed one. Then in the meantime Damaghosa visited him and told him that his son Shishupala is considered four-armed one, then the marriage was fixed but Krishna carried away Rukmini and Rukmini had also fell in love with Krishna on first sight, But while Krishna was carrying Rukmini in chariot, Rukmini’s brother Rukmi stopped Krishna and they both fought each other resulting in Rukmi’s defeat. Krishna was about to kill Rukmi but Rukmini begged to forgive her brother and Krishna forgave him, Krishna tonsured Rukmi as per Bhagvad Purana. Then Krishna called all Brahmins born to sages and marriage ceremony took place. This is the summary of the Skanda Purana story, it’s little bit different than the story mentioned in Srimad Bhagavatam where Swayamvar was arranged and it was attended by many kings, But Srimad Bhagavatm doesn’t mention the age of either Rukmini or Krishna but it does say that Rukmini had not attained puberty at the time of her marriage with Krishna. It’s mentioned in Skanda Purana,</p>
<p>Skanda Purana Book V, Section iii, Chapter 142, Verses 8-79 “…The second child born was a daughter named Rukmini. At that time an unembodied ethereal voice told him, ‘O Bhismaka, this girl should be given to a Four-armed One (born) on this earth.’… As time passed on she became a girl of eight years. The king recollected the words of the embodied being and became worried. ‘To whom shall I give this daughter? Who will be the four-armed one?’… In the meantime Damaghosa, the chieftain of Cedi came there from the excellent mountain Raivata. He entered the royal palace where King Bhismaka was present. On seeing him arrived in the abode, the king duly adored him. He was taken to the Royal Court and given a proper seat. ‘This day has dawned meritoriously. I was eager to see you. O great king, my daughter has come to the age of eight years. The ethereal voice of an unembodied being has told that she should be given to a Four-armed one.’ On hearing the words of Bhismaka, Damaghosa said thus: ‘My son is well known in all the three worlds as Four-armed One (Caturbhuja). O Bhismaka, let this girl be given to Sisupala.’ On hearing the words of Damaghosa, O king, Rumini was betrothed to Sisupala by Bhismaka. The auspicious ceremonial beginning was made by Bhismaka, O Yudhisthira. All the kinsmen and members of the family who were staying far-off countries in every direction, were invited and they duly arrived…At the time of dusk, Rukmini, the bride of seductive charms, went out of the city accomplished by her female companions for the worship of Ambika. There she saw Hari, the Lord of Devas, in the guise of a cowherd. On seeing him, she was excited by the god of Love and became completely fascinated. On seeing her, Kesava said to Sankarsana, ‘On dear brother in my view the excellent jewel of a girl should be taken away.’ On hearing the words of Kesava, Sankarsana said: ‘Go ahead, O Krsna, O mighty one. Let the jewel of a girl be seized quickly. I shall follow you closely behind causing much havoc unto all these demons. On getting the consent of Sankarsana, Kesava, the slayer of Kesin, seized the girl, immediately put her on the chariot and went off…Rukma said: O Lord Kesava, unlucky and sinful that I am, I had hit your chest with arrows. It behoves you to forgive me. Formerly Janaki was given over to you by Janaka himself. Now, O lord of Devas, Rukmini is offered unto you by me. Marry her duly in accordance with the injunctions…When Rukma went back Krsna invited excellent Brahmanas. They were the seven mental sons of Brahma…In this manner the Slayer of Madhu honoured them duly and perfectly and then grasped the hand of Rukmini in marriage.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>So this proves that Krishna married Rukmini when she was only eight years old. Srimad Bhagavatam the most authentic Purana of Krishna devotees explicitly states that she had not attained puberty,<br />
Srimad Bhagavatam Canto 10, Chapter 53, Verse 51 “Beholding that charming princess Rukmini gifted with a beautiful waist, a countenance adorned with Kundalas, not attaining the age of puberty, with a golden mekhala beautifying her waist, with rising signs of womanhood, with moving eyes as if in fear…” Tr. J.M. Sanyal</p>
<p>Another translation,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 10.53.51 “Smitten with love kindled (in their breast) by her, the illustrious warriors assembled (there) felt bewildered to behold the princess, who was possessed of a shapely (slender) waist and had not yet attained puberty, and who had a girdle of jewels thrown about her hips and in whom signs of womanhood were (just) manifesting themselves…” Tr. Gita press Publications</p>
<p>A Hindu scholar named Swami Venkatesananda wrote,</p>
<p>“After the wordhip Rukmini took part of the offerings she had made to the goddess, as a token of the goddess’s blessings. She then left the temple and was talking towards the waiting chariot. Rukmini, who was of exquisite beauty though she had not yet attained puberty, looked for Krsna among the assembled princes. These princes, who had been robbed of their senses by her great charm, had for the moment been paralysed, and stood gaping. As she was about to mount her chariot, Krsna sprang forward, grasped her hand and helped her to his own vehicle, while the princes still stood looking on helplessly. However, as Krsna’s vehicle moved towards Dvaraka, the princes, headed by Jarasandha, began to say to one another: ‘What a disgrace: while we great warriors were watching, the cowherds snatched away a princess!” <strong>The Concise Srimad Bhagavatam, By Swami Venkatesananda, page 292, Publisher SUNY Press, 1989</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other Puranic verses shows that she was engaged in child like sports,</p>
<p>Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Krishna Janma Khanda 105.1-10 “…The monarch Bhismaka observed his beautiful daughter engaged in child-like sports and increasing in splendour day by day like a digit of the moon in the midst of clouds. Considering it advisable to marry his youthful and lovely daughter…” Rajendra Nath Sen</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So all these references proves that Rukmini was a prepubescent girl of eight years old. If anyone wants to refute this claim of mine then they should furnish reference clearly showing the age of Rukmini, other tricks of twisting facts will not be accepted.</p>
<p>Another thing is that, Krishna is said to have married 16100 princesses after liberating them from a demon named Narakasur. Hindu scriptures says that Krishna died in old age.</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 5.37.15-20 states that Krishna lived over a hundred years, some Hindu scholars says that he lived up to 120 or 125. Now please read it carefully, Devi Bhagavatam 2.28.1-23; Padma Purana 1.23.91-121 and Padma Purana 1.23.74b-87a states that Krishna’s 16100 wives were abducted by bandits or fishermen and they were made prostitutes after the death of Krishna, refer my article <a href="/index.php/2018/06/20/how-krishna-died-and-what-happened-to-his-wives/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link="internal">How Krishna Died &amp; What Happened To His Wives?</a></p>
<p>Now the question is, why would anyone abduct old women for carnal purpose? There must have been many really young and beautiful girls in the city Dvaraka so why they were not abducted and instead Krishna’s wives were abducted? Obviously only young women would be abducted by perverts so Krishna’s 16100 must have been quite young when they were abducted or let’s assume that they were 30 years old when 100+ years old Krishna died. So let’s assume that Krishna had married them some 10 or 20 years before his death then that means those girls were 10 or 20 years old or perhaps less than 10 when 90+ year old Krishna married them, now such coincidence is impossible that all of 16100 princesses were of the same age there must have been a huge age gap between those princesses, some may have been under 10 when Krishna in his old age married them. So does that mean Krishna in old age married extremely youthful girls?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Shiva’s marriage with Parvati</strong></h2>
<p>Unlike the case of Ram and Krishna where age of brides is clearly mentioned, the case of Shiva’s is little complicated. Hindu texts does say that gods and sages fixed the marriage of Parvati with Shiva when Parvati was only eight years old. But doesn’t state her age at the time of her marriage. As per Puranas, When Sati the first wife of Shiva immolated herself, Shiva promised that he would not wed any other lady. But Sati reincarnated on earth as Parvati the daughter of king Himavat. The story has different versions in Skanda Purana, Shiva Purana and Vamana Purana. I shall mention them all. Stories in Shiva and Skanda Puranas are quite same. First I shall discuss the story mentioned in Shiva and Skanda Purana, I will try to make it as short as possible. Himavat along with Parvati went to Shiva and paid obeisance, while Shiva was meditating. Himavat asked Shiva that his daughter along with maids would serve him but Shiva refused. Sages had told Himavat that Parvati’s husband would be Shiva so Parvati started performing penance to gain Shiva as her husband. The duration of her penance is not mentioned, it could last for few months, a year or say for four years. But that doesn’t make any difference to a eight years old girl. Following verses are about when Parvati had not yet started her penance,</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Rudra Samhita, ParvatiKhanda, section III.8.51- “On hearing the story from Narada, Parvati bent down her head in bashfulness but her smile heightened the beauty of her face. On hearing the story, the lord of mountains stroked her fondly, kissed her on the head and placed her on his seat.” Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Placing a girl on seat is possible only if she is a child although previous verses clearly says that she was eight years old, it’s not possible to place on seat a full grown girl. Verses of Skanda and Shiva Purana shows that Parvati was only eight before she went to Shiva abode and later started performing her penance,</p>
<p>Skanda Purana I.i.20.1 “Lomasa said: The chaste girl grew up day by day and shone very much. Living in the house of Himalaya, she reached the age of eight years.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Rudrasamhita, Parvatikhanda, section III.11.1-2 “Brahma said:- O Narada, the daughter of the mountain, honoured in the three worlds, was brought up in the palace of Himacala. When she was eight years old, Siva distressed by Sati’s separation came to know of her birth. Keeping her wonderful memory within his heart He rejoiced much.” Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Rudrasamhita, Parvatikhanda, section III.8.4-13 “Himavat said:- O sage Narada…Please read the horoscope of my daughter and tell me about her good and bad fortune. Whose beloved wife will my fortunate daughter be? Narada said: ‘O Mena, O king of mountains, this daughter of yours has all auspicious signs…There is an abnormal line also. Listen to the indication thereof. Her husband will be a naked Yogin, without any qualities. He will be free from lust. He will have neither mother nor father. He will be indifferent to honours. His dress and manners will be inauspicious…O sage, on hearing your words, and inferring that indications reffered to Siva, Parvati’s joy knew no bounds.” Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>When Shiva was pleased with Parvati’s penance he sent seven sages to Himavat to ask Parvati’s hand in marriage,</p>
<p>Skanda Purana I.i.23.3-9 “Why have all of you come? Tell me the reason for your visit. Then the Seven Sages said: ‘We have been sent by Mahesa. We have come to you in order to see the girl. O Mountain, understand us. Show us your daughter immediately.’ Saying ‘So be it’ to the group of Sages, Parvati was brought there. Himavan, the lord of Mountains, who loved his children, placed Parvati in his lap and said laughingly. ‘This is my daughter indeed. But listen to my words again. Siva is the most excellent one among ascetics. The destroyer of Madana is devoid of attachment. How does he by whom Smara (Madana) has been made Ananga (bodiless), seek a marriage alliance? Offering the daughter in marriage to the following persons is not recommended: one who is very near (i.e. closely related), one who is very far off, one who is extremely rich one, one who is devoid of wealth, one who is unemployed and a foolish fellow. One shall not offer one’s daughter in marriage to a stupid person, to a person who is devoid of attachment, to a self-esteeming person, to a sick man and to a madcap. Hence, O excellent…” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p><strong>Ganesh Vasudeo Tagare writes on verse 5:</strong> “Evidence of child-marriage at the time of our text. Parvati who performed penance for a long time, must have been too old to sit in the lap of her father.”</p>
<p>This is a very important point. Parvati along with her father went to Shiva’s abode when she was eight years old, the duration of her penance is not mentioned so let’s assume that she performed penance for a year or let’s say for four years. Considering that her father placed her in his lap even after the penance so she must be very young girl at the time. Another point is that, When Narada and gods approached him and told him that his daughter would marry Shiva he was somehow convinced to give his eight years old daughter to Shiva without thinking about the age difference.</p>
<p>Now let’s have a look at Vamana Purana version about the marriage of Shiva and Parvati.</p>
<p>Vamana Purana 25.1 “Pulastya said Three daughters endowed with beauty and merit were born to Mena and a son named Sunabha was born as the fourth. [5-7] O sage, six years after their birth, the three daughters born to her, went out to perform penance, Gods saw those handsome girls. The austere Kutila who was as beautiful as the rays of the Moon was then taken to the heaven of Brahman by the Adityas and the Vasus. Then the gods said, ‘O Brahman, please tell us whether she will give birth to a son who will slay Mahisa.” Tr. Anand Swarup Gupta</p>
<p>Vamana Purana 25.8-27 “The great god Brahman said, ‘This austere girl is not capable of holding the semen of Sankara. Leave this poor girl.’ But then O Narada, the enraged Kutila said to Brahmana, ‘O Lord, I shall so endeavour that I hold the semen of Sankara which is very difficult to be born…She too who was called Ragavati, was brought to heaven by the gods. Offering her to Brahman, Prajapati spoke to her in the same manner. Losing her temper, she too said, ‘Truly I shall undergo penance in such a manner that the slayer of Mahisa will become associated with my name. ‘Then the austere Mena knowing, as she did, that the two daughters had already left her, prevented her third daughter from taking to penance. And she exclaimed ‘Uma (O do not practice penance).’ Her mother the brillaint daughter of the Pitrs gave her daughter the name Uma. She then went to the forest…Then Brahman said, ‘She is undoubtedly the consort of Sankara, by whose lustre indeed you have been distracted and have become lustreless…” Tr. Anand Swarup Gupta</p>
<p>So the gods tried to marry 6 years old girl to Shiva. Swami Parmeshwaranand explains it as,</p>
<p>“Three daughters named Kutila, Ragini and Parvati and a son named Sunabha were born to Himavan by his wife Mena. The three daughters went to the Himalayas for penance, to get Siva as husband. They were not even six years old then. The Devas saw them. The Adityas and the Vasus took Kutila who was doing penance, to the world of the gods. All the gods gathered together and asked Brahma. “Oh Lord, be pleased to tell us if this girl will be able to hear a son who could kill Mahisasura”. Brahma replied. “This poor girl will not be capable of bearing the radiance of Siva. So let her go away.” Kutila got angry at Brahma and said “Lord, I will try to become fit to bear the unbearable radiance of Siva. Harken, I will do penance properly and please Visnu and make Siva bow his head. I take a vow to that effect.” Brahma became angry and told Kutila, “You, wicked Kutila, you did not succumb to my words. So by my curse you will be turned to water.” Kutila having been cursed by Brahma became water and began to flood the world of Brahma. Seeing the flow of water, Brahma made cause-ways on four sides with the Vedas of Rg, Yajus, Sama and Atharva. Thus being tied up she stays in the world of Brahma. The Devas took Ragini also before Brahma and put the same question. The reply of Brahma was the same as before. She also got angry and said to Brahma. “I will do great penance so as to enable to give birth to one in my family to be the killer of Mahisasura.” Brahma cursed her also. “You are deliberately disobeying my words which even Devas won’t gainsay. So you will become the colours of the twilight.” Thus, she became the fast colours of the twilight, and her body was divided among the Pleiades. (Vamana Purana, Chapter 51).” <strong>Encyclopaedic Dictionary of Puranas, Volume 1, p.237, by Swami Parmeshwaranand, Published by Sarup &amp; Sons, 01-Jan-2001</strong></p>

<h1><strong>Hindu scriptures promoting paedophilia</strong></h1>
<p>Manu Smriti 9.94 A man, aged thirty years, shall marry a maiden of twelve who pleases him, or a man of twenty-four a girl eight years of age; if (the performance of) his duties would (otherwise) be impeded, (he must marry) sooner.</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 9.88 To a distinguished, handsome suitor (of) equal (caste) should (a father) give his daughter in accordance with the prescribed rule, though she have not attained (the proper age).</p>
<p>Parasara Smriti 7.5-6 When the twelfth year is reached by the female child, if the guardian does not give her away in marriage, her fore-fathers drink, without interruption, during each succeeding month, whatever blood is passed in her courses. The mother, and the father, and likewise the eldest brother, all these three relatives will go to hell, if before menstruation they neglect to marry the girl.</p>
<p>Swami Prabhupada <a href="http://www.prabhupada.org.uk/articles1/48_53/48.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">said<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, “All my sisters were married within twelve years. My second sister, she became twelve years, and I heard my mother become so disturbed: &#8220;Oh, this girl is not being married. I shall commit suicide…And she was given to a boy, my brother-in-law, for the second marriage. Means that my brother-in-law lost his first wife, and still, he was twenty-one years old. My sister was twelve years old and brother-in-law was twenty-one. In the sastra&#8230; I do not know exactly what is that sastra, but they say that if the girl before marriage has menstruation, then the father has to eat that menstrual liquid. Means it is, mean, very strict. And if the father is not living, then the elder brother has to eat. (break) &#8230;ty of getting the girl married rests on the father. In the absence of the father, the eldest brother. The girl must be married. That is it. It is called daya, kanya-daya.”</p>
<p>Yama Samhita verse 22 “The father, who does give away [in marriage] his maiden-daughter after she has attained the twelfth year, drinks her menstrual blood, month after month.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Padma Prana VI.118.2-15 &#8220;&#8230;A man should marry his daughter as long as she has not attained puberty. Wise men recommend a girl&#8217;s marriage when she is eight years old&#8230;&#8221; Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p>Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Krishna Janma Khanda 76.43-52 &#8220;&#8230;Whoever having decorated his virgin daughter aged eight years with apparel reverentially makes a gift of her to a good Brahmin, reaps the benefits of the gift of Durga.&#8221; Tr. Rajendra Nath Sen</p>
<p>Samvarta Samhita verses 66-68 “[A maiden] eight years [old] becomes Gouri; one of nine years a Rohini; and of ten years, a Kanya (maiden); and after that, a Rajasvala (a woman in menses). By seeing a maiden in menses, her mother, father and eldest brother these three go to hell. Therefore one should espouse a maiden before she has menstruated; the marriage of an eight years old maiden is most preferrable.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti 24.41. A damsel whose menses begin to appear (while she is living) at her father’s house, before she has been betrothed to a man, has to be considered as a degraded woman: by taking her (without the consent of her kinsmen) a man commits no wrong.</p>
<p>Gautama Dharmashastra 18.21 A girl should be given in marriage before (she attains the age of) puberty.</p>
<p>Baudhayana Dharmashastra, Prasna 4, Adhyaya 1.11 Let him give his daughter, while she still goes naked, to a man who has not broken the vow of chastity and who possesses good qualities, or even to one destitute of good qualities; let him not keep (the maiden) in (his house) after she has reached the age of puberty”</p>
<p>Vasishtha Dharmashastra 17.70 ‘Out of fear of the appearance of the menses let the father marry his daughter while she still runs about naked. For if she stays (in the house) after the age of puberty, sin falls on the father”</p>
<p>Mahabharata13.44.13 “A person of thirty years of age should wed a girl of ten years of age called a Nagnika. Or, a person of one and twenty years of age should wed a girl of seven years of age.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 3.10.16 “If he marry, he must select a maiden who is of a third of his age.” Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Padma Purana II.85.62-66a ”…Wise men get married their unmarried daughter(s). As long as she does not menstruate (i.e. does not attain puberty)…” Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p>Padma Purana II.47.47-65 “…The father should keep his daughter in his house till she becomes eight years old. He should not keep a strong (i.e. grown up) one. Both the parents get the (fruit of the) sin which a daughter, living in her father’s house, commits…” Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p>Garuda Purana chapter 95 “…”The relations of a girl incur the sin of wilfully creating a miscarriage, or of killing a foetus in the even of their failing to give her away in marriage before she has commenced to menstruate. A girl is liberty to make her own choice, and to be united with a husband, in the absence of any such relation to give her away in marriage…” Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana 2.3.19.11 “Many sons should be sought so that at least one would go to Gaya, one shall marry a girl of the Gauri type (i.e. of eight years or one who is a virgin) or one shall discharge a Nala (? lean like a red) bull.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Vayu Purana 21.12 “…It is better to wish for many sons. At least one of them will go to Gaya or marry a girl eight years old or discharge a blue ox (free to wander).’ [15] Brhaspati said: A son begot after marrying after marrying a girl of eight years sanctifies twentyone generations. Moreover, he sanctifies six generations in the family of his maternal uncle. This is remembered as the benefit (of such marriage).” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Kisari Mohan Ganguli writes,</p>
<p>“Vrishalipati literally means the husband of a Sudra woman. By actually marrying a woman of the lowest order, by marrying before the elder brother, by marrying a girl that has attained to puberty, and by certain other acts, a Brahmana comes to be regarded as a Vrishalipati.” On Mahabharata 13.126 <a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m13/m13b091.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m13/m13b091.htm<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>Vyasa Samhita 2.2-4 “…of auspicious signs, clad in silken garments, and not above eight years of age, and whose paternal ancestors to the tenth degree in the ascending line were all men of renown, should be solemnly wedded by a (twice-born) according to religious rites, if preferred in marriage. [7] The sin incidental to (an act of) procuring abortion (lie: destruction of the foetus) is committed, if through the negligence of her giver a girl menstruates before her marriage. He, who does not give away a daughter in marriage before she attains puberty, becomes degraded.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Skanda Purana VII.I.205.80-86 “If a girl, before being consecrated by marriage rites, has her menses in the house of her father, her Pitrs become fallen and that girl is called Vrsali. If a Brahmana knowingly marries that girl, they say, he is not fit for a Sraddha. He cannot be in the same row as others. He is a Vrsalipati. Gauri virgin is the best and most important. Rohini is considered as Madhyama (middling). Rajasvala should be known as the bases though equal to her (Rohini) image. When there is no menstrual flow, she is Gauri. When there is the flow she is Rohini. If the girlhood has not fully developed she is Kanya. One without breasts is Nagnika. A seven year old girl is Gauri; nine year old is Nagnika. Ten year old shall be Kanya; above that she is Rajasvala. Through breasts she spoils the family of her father and through menstrual flow, she spoils the desirable goal (salvation) and pleasures of the other worlds of her father. He who marries one with menstrual flow should be known as Vrsalipati.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 9.41.26-47 “The World-Mother never stays even for a moment in his house who eats at the house of one who marries an unmarried girl twelve years old in whom menstruation has commenced…” Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Above two verses considers the man sinful who marries a girl who started her menstruation in her father’s house which means a person should marry a girl who has not yet started her menstrual period.</p>
<p><strong>Proof that girls as young as 10 were married off</strong></p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 3.27.40 “My daughter has come to a marriageable age; I have no money. Her age has exceeded ten years; the marriageable age limit has been exceeded. Alas! What am I to do?” Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Radha the concubine and aunt of Krishna was married to Rayana at the age of 12,</p>
<p>Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Prakriti Khanda, Chapter 49, Verses 36-40 &#8220;In the Varaha-kalpa, Radhika was born in the village of Gokula in the family of a Vaisya cowherd. She was born without any human contact&#8230;After the <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">expiry of twelve years</span>, finding her becoming youthful, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">she was married to a trader named Rayana</span>&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Shanti Lal Nagar, edited by Acharya Ramesh Chaturvedi</p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 5.17.3-26 “The King Chandrasena, the father, was very pleased to have this beautiful daughter and gladly called her by the name of Mandodarî. This daughter began to grow daily like the phases of the Moon. When she grew ten years old, she became very handsome. The King now became anxious to have a suitable bridegroom and used to think of it everyday. The Brâhmins then told the king that there was a prince named Kambugrîva, the intelligent son of the powerful king Sudhanvâ of Madra” Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Skanda Purana III.iii.18.4-6 “When she was aged twelve years, the girl had beauty of form and all good features. A Brahmana named Padmanabha whose wife had passed away, requested for the haand of the girl. The Brahmana had plenty of wealth. He was calm and qui. He was a permanent companion of the king. So the father of the girl did not dare to refuse. He gave the daughter to him. The marriage was celebrated at midday…” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Skanda Purana VII.I.166.17-20 “…You are to behave in a manner that will give no cause to the Devas to despise me. My dear daughter, I have heard this cited in sacred scriptures. ‘If without being consecrated (in marriage) a girl discharges her menses in her father’s house the father earns the sin of Brahmana-slaying and the girl is known as a Vrsali (Sudra). Therefore, I am sending you off in the company of aged ministers. Hurry up. Choose your own husband and decide.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE</strong></p>
<p>Some Hindus have attempted to refute the above points with futile arguments, so here’s a response to those apologists. I have quoted dozens of verses, several apologists have attempted to refute only 20-30% of the article which means a large part of the article is irrefutable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Apologists’ explanation</strong>: According to Rig Veda 10.85.40-41 and Padma Purana V.118.2-15 a girl should be given in marriage only after she attains puberty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Response</strong>: The verse actually states the stages of development of a girl, it doesn’t talk about marrying off daughter only after she attains puberty, in the Atharved it’s a prayer made by a man thanking gods for bestowing riches and sons. A girl can conceive a child only after she attains puberty and that’s what it’s stating here. The apologist has quoted Padma Purana verse out of context (to buttress his RigVed claim) otherwise the verse itself would have refuted the explanation of the apologist, here are the next lines of the verse,</p>
<p>Padma Purana V.118.2-15 &#8220;When small hair appears (on the private parts), Soma enjoys a daughter. When she attains puberty, gandharvas (enjoy her); and when breasts appear (prominent), Fire (enjoys her). <u>A man should marry his daughter as long as she has not attained puberty</u>. <u>Wise men recommend a girl&#8217;s marriage when she is eight years old</u>. She should be duly given to a brahmana who is well-versed in sacred learning, possesses moral virtue, has actually studied Vedas, and has observed celibacy. This is said to be the rule regarding a daughter to be given (in marriage).” Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p>What is alluded here is that a girl should be given in marriage before she is enjoyed by gods i.e. before she attains puberty, these are Hindu god Shiva’s words. Rigved verses 36-38 indicates that the bride was already married and then she started becoming mature.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Apologists’ explanation</strong>: The translation of Valmiki Ramayana about the age of Sita is wrong, here’s the correct translation, “<em>She had been in Ikshwaku dynasty of King Dashratha for <strong><u>two years</u></strong> and got all the materialistic pleasure available for human kind.</em><em> Thereafter, in the <strong>third year</strong>, the king and lord Dasaratha consulted other kings and ministers to consecrate Rama.” </em>The word Dash here doesn’t mean 10 but mentions Dasharath, so Sita’s age at the time of her marriage was 18-2=16 not 6.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Response</strong>: The Sanskrit words mentioned in these verses are so simple that even those fluent in Hindi language can define those words. I am quoting the Sanskrit verses,</p>
<p>उषित्वा <u>द्वा दश</u> समाः इक्ष्वाकूणाम् निवेशने |<br />
भुंजाना मानुषान् भोगान् सर्व काम समृद्धिनी ||</p>
<p>तत्र <u>त्रयो दशे वर्षे</u> राज अमंत्र्यत प्रभुः |<br />
अभिषेचयितुम् रामम् समेतो राज मन्त्रिभिः || ३.४७.४-५</p>
<p>The apologist instead of explaining the verses has mischievously mistranslated his scripture. If the word Dasha here doesn’t mean Ten but rather mentions the name of Dasharath then I am eager to know how would the apologist write twelve and thirteen in Sanskrit language? The word Dva means two, Dasha means ten, Varsha means years, which is quite same for the next verse wherein the word Trayo means three. These words are so simple that I don’t find the necessity to quote any lexicon here. In Shiva Purana, Section 1 Vidyesvara Samhita, Chapter 15, verses 42-45 the same word Dva-Dash is mentioned which is translated by all scholars as Twelve. Apologists are conveniently ignoring Skanda Purana Book III, Section 2, Chapter 30, Verses 8-9 which leaves no doubt regarding the age of Sita at the time of her marriage, it explicitly mentions that Sita was 6 years old at the time of her marriage. To convince the apologist, let me quote another verse from Valmiki Ramayana about the age of Sita at the time she was wedded to Rama,</p>
<p>Valmiki Ramayana, Sundara Kanda 5, Chapter 33, Verses 13-14 “I stayed in Rama&#8217;s house there for twelve years, enjoying the worldly pleasures belonging to human kind and fulfilling all my desires. Thereafter, in the thirteenth year, King Dasaratha along with his preceptors started to perform anointment of the kingdom to Rama, a celebrity of Ikshvaku dynasty.” Tr. Desiraju Hanumantha Rao</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After calculating the years mentioned here we get the same number that Sita was 6 years old.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p><strong>Apologists’ Claim</strong>: Srimad Bhagavatam 10.53.51 is a mistranslation, the verse nowhere states that Rukmini had not attained puberty at the time of her marriage with Krishna. There’s no word for puberty here.</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Response</strong>: The Sanskrit words mentioned in this verse are Stanim (breasts) and Vyanjat (budding) which means her breasts had started budding, these words are used as idioms to state that Rukmini had not yet attained puberty, because the breasts of a girl doesn’t start budding when she is a sixteen years old girl (as apologists claim), by the time a girl reaches the age of 16 she becomes an adult. Almost all translators have translated the same.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p><strong>Apologists’ Claim</strong>: Skanda Purana Book V, Section iii, Chapter 142, Verses 8-79 cannot be used to show that Rukmini was 8 years old because the Sanskrit words mentioned here are Adashta Varsha in which the word Ada is ambiguous so it may mean anything like she has become twice the age.</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Response</strong>: Even the apologist himself is confused, or maybe he is deliberately twisting words in order to cause confusion in the minds of readers. The apologist instead of buttressing his claim with lexicons or texts is rather making assumptions. The Sanskrit words mentioned here are quite clear, words Ashta Varsha means 8 years. This claim of mine about 8 years old Rukmini been wedded to Krishna as per Skanda Purana remains uncontested. Here too I don’t find the necessity to quote lexicons to refute the pathetic claim of the apologist.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p><strong>Apologists’ explanation</strong>: As per Harivamsa Purana Visnuparva 2.59.37 Rukmini was sixteen years old when she was married to Krishna.</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Response</strong>: To my knowledge, there are no Sanskrit words in this verse that can be translated as ‘sixteen years old’, though the text describes Rukmini as an adult. Apologist can quote the Sanskrit words which translates as 16 years old.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apologists also quotes a verse from Brahmavaivarta Purana where Rukmini is described as of having attained puberty. But does that negate Skanda Purana and Bhagavad Purana verses? Does that nullify or refute verses from Skanda and Bhagavad Purana? No, rather they are to be taken as different versions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p><strong>Apologists’ explanation</strong>: The gods and sages didn’t attempt to marry off 6 years old Parvati to Shiva, the reference of Vamana Purana given is wrong.</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Response</strong>: This story is mentioned in Vamana Purana, Saromahatmya chapter 25, verses 1-27, following is the screenshot from the scripture,</p>
<p>My emphasis was not on when Parvati was married to Shiva as Hindu scriptures don’t mention the age of Parvati at the time of her marriage. The Hindu gods had already made up that 6 year old Parvati would be able to hold Shiva’s semen i.e., she would be able to conceive the child of Shiva.<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p><strong>Apologists’ explanation</strong>: Manu Smriti 9.94; Mahabharata 13.44.13 A man, aged thirty years, shall marry a maiden of ten or twelve. These verses merely tells the man to simply marry a girl younger than him, these shouldn&#8217;t be taken literally.</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Response</strong>: Apologists are playing with words to distort their Hindu texts. It’s not a commandment that a man should marry only when he is 30 years old or that a girl should be given in marriage only when she is 10 or 12 years old, and this is what Acharya Medhatithi is also alluding to. A man can marry at the age of 25 given that the girl is very much younger than him, this is already mentioned in Vishnu Purana,</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 3.10.16 “If he marry, he must select a maiden who is of a third of his age.” Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>So a 40 year old man should wed a girl who is around 13 years old, if a man is 20 years old then he must marry a girl who is one third of his age that is he must marry a 6 or 7 years old girl and this is exactly what Mahabharata and Manu Smriti states. The apologists are deliberately ignoring the age gap mentioned in Mahabharata and Manu Smriti that a 30 years old adult man should wed a prepubescent girl of 10-12 years who is one third of his age.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p><strong>Apologists’ explanation</strong>: Vishnu Smriti 24.41 makes it clear that only those girls are considered degraded who haven’t given in marriage before they started menstruating, it doesn’t say keeping a married daughter who started menstruating in father’s home is degraded. It is because a girl has to stay in father’s home after her marriage till she completes her third year after she started menstruating, as we seen earlier.</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Response</strong>: The author himself seems to be confused, he has acknowledged that “only those girls are considered degraded who haven’t given in marriage before they started menstruating”. As the apologist has admitted it, I don’t find the reason to explain it.</p>

The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manusm%E1%B9%9Bti" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Manusmriti<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> also known as <em>Manav Dharam Shastra</em>, is the earliest metrical work on Brahminical Dharma in Hinduism. According to Hindu mythology, the Manusmriti is the word of Brahma, and it is classified as the most authoritative statement on Dharma .The scripture consists of 2690 verses, divided into 12 chapters.  It is presumed that the actual human author of this compilation used the eponym ‘Manu’, which has led the text to be associated by Hindus with the first human being and the first king in the Indian tradition.<span id="more-4827"></span><br />

Although no details of this eponymous author’s life are known, it is likely that he belonged to a conservative Brahman class somewhere in Northern India. Hindu apologists consider the Manusmriti as the divine code of conduct and, accordingly, the status of women as depicted in the text has been interpreted as Hindu divine law.  While defending Manusmriti as divine code of conduct for all including women, apologists often quote the verse: <em>“yatr naryasto pojyantay, ramantay tatr devta <strong>[3/56]</strong></em> <em>(where women are provided place of honor, gods are pleased and reside there in that household)</em>, but they deliberately forget all those verses that are full of prejudice, hatred  and discrimination against women.<br />
Here are some of the ‘celebrated’ derogatory comments about women in the Manusmriti :<br />
1. “Swabhav ev narinam …..” – 2/213. It is the nature of women to seduce men in this world; for that reason the wise are never unguarded in the company of females.<br />
