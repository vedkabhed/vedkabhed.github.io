<p>This article deals with contradictions in Vedas more particularly the Rig Veda. Contradictions in religious scriptures prove that either it is not a word of God because a god cannot make mistakes, or it is that the scripture underwent interpolations over time resulting in conflicting views within the scripture. Books like The Oriental Studies by John Muir and Vedic Mythology by Arthur Anthony Macdonell were very helpful on this topic, I have taken some points from my previous articles as well. Due to time constraints, I couldn&#8217;t write more, if God wills then I will add more contradictions in this article. And I request you to please mention the blog link when you copy this article, appreciate the hard work of writers by crediting the writer.</p>

<li><span style="color: #0070c0; text-decoration: underline;"><strong>WHAT DID THE ASHWINS DRAW FROM HOOF OF THE HORSE?</strong><br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>100 Jars of Sura (wine)<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.116.7 &#8220;O Heroes, ye gave wisdom to Kakṣīvān who sprang from Pajra&#8217;s line, who sang your praises. Ye poured forth from the hoof of your strong charger a hundred jars of wine as from a strainer.&#8221; Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p><strong>100 Jars of Madhu (honey)</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.117.6 &#8220;Kakṣīvān, Pajra&#8217;s son, must laud that exploit of yours, Nāsatyas, Heroes, ye who wander! When from the hoof of your strong horse ye showered a hundred jars of honey for the people.&#8221; Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>Madhu sometime also denotes wine but that&#8217;s probably not applicable here. If it meant sweet wine then the word Sura should have also been used here which is not the case. It clearly says that Ashwins (Nasatyas) drew 100 jars of Madhu (Honey).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #0070c0;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">WHO RAISED UP THE CLOUD AND SHOWERED IT FOR RISHI GAUTAMA?</span><br />
</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><br />
Maruts<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.85.10-11 &#8220;They with their vigorous strength pushed the well up on high, and clove the cloud in twain though it was passing strong. The Maruts, bounteous Givers, sending forth their voice, in the wild joy of Soma wrought their glorious deeds. They drave the cloud transverse directed hitherward, and poured the fountain forth for thirsting Gotama…&#8221; Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p><strong>Nasatyas/Ashwins</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.116.9 &#8220;Ye lifted up the well, O ye Nasatyas, and set the base on high to open downward. Streams flowed for folk of Gotama who thirsted, like rain to bring forth thousandfold abundance.&#8221; Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #0070c0; text-decoration: underline;"><strong>WHO HEALED BLIND &amp; CRIPPLED RISHI PARAVRIK/PARAVRIJ?<br />
</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><br />
Ashwins</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.112.8 &#8220;Mighty Ones, with what powers ye gave Parāvṛj aid what time ye made the blind and lame to see and walk…&#8221; Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p><strong>Indra<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 2.15.7 &#8220;Conscious of the disappearance of the damsels, the (Rishi) Parivrij, becoming manifest, stood up; the lame man overtook (them), the blind man beheld (them): in the exhilaration of the Soma, Indra has done these (deeds).&#8221; Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Griffith&#8217;s translation is not clear hence I quoted Wilson&#8217;s translation here but Ralph T.H. Griffith writes in the footnotes of this verse, &#8220;Paravrij, here rendered &#8216;the outcast,&#8217; is taken by Sayana as the name of a Rishi who was lame and blind. When some girls made sport of him he prayed to Indra and was made sound.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Soma</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.25.11 &#8220;This to the sage who offers gifts brings power that comes from wealth in kine.</p>
<p>This, better than the seven, hath-at your glad carouse-furthered the blind, the cripple. Thou art waxing great.&#8221; Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #0070c0;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">WHO BESTOWED IMMORTALITY ON GODS/HOW DID THE GODS ATTAIN IMMORTALITY?</span><br />
</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><br />
Rohita </strong></p>
<p>Atharva Veda 13.1.7 &#8220;Rohita made firm heaven and earth, by him the (heavenly) light was established, by him the firmament. By him the atmosphere and the spaces were measured out, through him the gods obtained immortality.&#8221; Tr. Maurice Bloomfield</p>
<p><strong>Savitar</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 4.54.2; Yajur Veda 33.54 &#8220;For thou at first producest for the holy Gods the noblest of all portions, immortality: Thereafter as a gift to men, O Savitar, thou openest existence, life succeeding life.&#8221; Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p><strong>Agni</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 6.7.4 &#8220;To thee, Immortal! when to life thou springest, all the Gods sing for joy as to their infant. They by thy mental powers were made immortal, Vaiśvānara, when thou shonest from thy Parents.&#8221; Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 4.23.6 &#8220;Through whom the Gods discovered life eternal…&#8221; Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 32.10 &#8220;He is our kin, our Father and Begetter: he knows all beings and all Ordinances, In whom the Gods obtaining life eternal have risen upward to the third high station.&#8221; Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p><strong>By drinking Soma</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 9.106.8 &#8220;Thy drops that swim in water have exalted Indra to delight: The Gods have drunk thee up for immortality.&#8221; Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p><strong>Kushtha plant regarded as immortal<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Atharva Veda 6.95.2 &#8220;There moved through heaven a golden ship, a ship with cordage wrought of gold. There Gods obtained the Kushtha plant, the flower of immortality.&#8221; Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #0070c0; text-decoration: underline;"><strong>SUN TRAVELS BY MARES OR HORSES?<br />
</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mares<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.50.9 &#8220;The Sun has yoked the seven mares that safely draw his chariot&#8230;&#8221; Tr. H.H. Wilson<span style="font-family: Segoe Print;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><strong>Horses</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 5.45.9 &#8220;Borne by his Coursers Seven may Sūrya visit the field that spreadeth wide for his long journey…&#8221; Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #0070c0;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">WHO FIRST GAVE SOMA TO INDRA?</span><br />
</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><br />
Aditi &amp; Kashyapa<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 3.48.2 &#8220;On the day on which thou wast born, thou didst drink at will the mountain-abiding nectar of this Soma plant, for thy youthful parent mother (Aditi), in the dwelling of thy great sire (Kasyapa), gave it to thee before she gave the breast.&#8221; Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Rig Veda 7.98.3 &#8220;As soon as born, Indra, thou hast drunk the Soma for thine invigoration: thy mother (Aditi) proclaimed thy greatness&#8230;&#8221; Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p><strong>Falcon Suparna<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 3.43.7 &#8220;Drink of the strong pressed out by strong ones, Indra, that which the Falcon brought thee when thou longedst…&#8221; Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>According to the story, Soma was not available to gods, the falcon Suparna was the first one to bring Soma to Vedic gods.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #0070c0; text-decoration: underline;"><strong>WHOM DID INDRA KILL AFTER DRINKING SOMA BROUGHT DOWN BY THE FALCON?<br />
</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><br />
Indra killed Vritra</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.80.2 &#8220;That exceedingly exhilarating Soma juice, which was brought by the hawk, (from heaven), when poured forth, has exhilarated thee, so that, in thy vigour, thunderer, thou hast struck Vritra from the sky, manifesting thine own sovereignty.&#8221; Tr. H.H. Willson</p>
<p><strong>Indra killed Namuchi</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 6.20.6 &#8220;And the hawk bore to Indra the exhilarating Soma, when, bruising the head of the oppressor Namuchi&#8230;&#8221; Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #0070c0;">SOMA WAS BROUGHT DOWN FOR WHOM?</span><br />
</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Verses suggesting that the Soma was brought for Indra</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 6.20.6 &#8220;And the hawk bore to Indra the exhilarating Soma, when, bruising the head of the oppressor Namuchi&#8230;&#8221; Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Rig Veda 3.43.7 &#8220;Drink of the strong pressed out by strong ones, Indra, that which the Falcon brought thee when thou longedst…&#8221; Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p><strong>Brought for Humans to perform sacrifices</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 4.26.4 &#8220;May this bird, Maruts, be pre-eminent over (other) hawks, since with a wheelless car the swift-winged bore the Soma, accepted by the gods, to Manu.&#8221; Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Humans are mentioned as Manu in above verse. Following verse states that Vedic god Agni commanded the eagle to bring down the Soma and suggests that it was brought for the Aryans for the sacrifice,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.11.4 &#8220;The hawk sent (by Agni) to the sacrifice has brought the dripping copious all-seeing (Soma) libation. When the Arya people chose the victorious Agni as the ministrant priest, then the sacred rite is celebrated.&#8221; Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #0070c0; text-decoration: underline;"><strong>HOW MANY CASTLES/FORTS OF SAMBARA DID INDRA DESTROY?<br />
</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>100 Castles/Cities<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 2.14.6 &#8220;Ye ministers, to him who as with thunder demolished Śambara&#8217;s hundred ancient castles…&#8221; Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>Though it is mentioned elsewhere that Indra gave the hundredth castle to Divodasa but Rig Veda 2.14.6 talks about demolishing all 100 castles.</p>
<p>Rig Veda 6.31.4 &#8220;Thou smotest to the ground the hundred castles, impregnable, of Sambara the Dasyu&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p><strong>90 Castles/Cities</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.130.7 &#8220;For Pūru thou hast shattered, Indra ninety forts, for Divodāsa thy boon servant with thy bolt, O Dancer, for thy worshipper. For Atithigva he, the Strong, brought Śambara from the mountain down…&#8221; Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p><strong>99 Castles/Cities<br />

</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Unsure about creator<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.129.6-7 Who verily knows and who can here declare it, whence it was born and whence comes this creation? The Gods are later than this world&#8217;s production. Who knows then whence it first came into being? He, the first origin of this creation, whether he formed it all or did not form it, Whose eye controls this world in highest heaven, he verily knows it, or perhaps he knows not.</p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.185.1 &#8220;Which of these two, (Heaven and Earth), is prior, which posterior; how were they engendered; (declare), sages, who knows this? verily, you uphold the universe of itself, and the days (and nights) revovle as if they had wheels.&#8221; Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p><strong>Unknown/Supreme God<br />

<p>Rig Veda 1.160.4 &#8220;Among the skilful Gods most skilled is he, who made the two world-halves which bring prosperity to all; Who with great wisdom measured both the regions out, and stablished them with pillars that shall ne&#8217;er decay.&#8221; Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>

<p><strong>Vishwakarma</strong></p>

</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.81.2 &#8220;…Whence Visvakarman, seeing all, producing the earth, with mighty power disclosed the heavens.&#8221; Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p><strong>Tvastar<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.110.9 &#8220;Hotar more skilled in sacrifice, bring hither with speed to-day God Tvaṣṭar, thou who knowest. Even him who formed these two, the Earth and Heaven the Parents, with their forms, and every creature.&#8221; Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p><strong>Ribhus<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 4.34.9 &#8220;Ṛbhus, who helped their Parents and the Aśvins, who formed the Milch-cow and the pair of horses, Made armour, set the heaven and earth asunder,—far- reaching Heroes, they have made good offspring.&#8221; Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p><strong>Hiranyagarba<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.121.9 &#8220;Neer may he harm us who is earth&#8217;s Begetter, nor he whose laws are sure, the heavens&#8217; Creator, He who brought forth the great and lucid waters. What God shall we adore with our oblation?&#8221; Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>

<p>Rig Veda 9.96.5 &#8220;Father of holy hymns, Soma flows onward the Father of the earth, Father of heaven: Father of Agni, Sūrya&#8217;s generator, the Father who begat Indra and Viṣṇu.&#8221; Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Nasadiya Sukta version</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.72.1-4 Let us proclaim with a clear voice the generations of the gods (the divine company), who, when their praises are recited, look (favourably on the worshipper) in this latter age. Brahmanaspati filled these (generations of the gods) with breath as a blacksmith (his bellows) in the first age of the gods the existent was born of the non-existent. In the first age of the gods the existent was born of the non-existent; after that the quarters (of the horizon) were born, and after them the upward-growing (trees). The earth was born from the upward-growing (tree), the quarters were born from the earth; Daksha was born from Aditi, and afterwards Aditi from Daksha. – Tr. H.H Wilson</p>
<p><strong>Purusha Sukta version</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.90.8-14 &#8220;From that great general sacrifice the dripping fat was gathered up&#8230;</p>
<p>He formed the creatures of-the air, and animals both wild and tame. From it were horses born, from it all cattle with two rows of teeth: From it were generated kine, from it the goats and sheep were born&#8230;The Moon was gendered from his mind, and from his eye the Sun had birth; Indra and Agni from his mouth were born, and Vāyu from his breath. Forth from his navel came mid-air the sky was fashioned from his head Earth from his feet, and from his car the regions. Thus they formed the worlds.&#8221; Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>

<p><strong>Earth and Heaven were created by God(s)<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 4.34.9 &#8220;Ṛbhus, who helped their Parents and the Aśvins, who formed the Milch-cow and the pair of horses, Made armour, set the heaven and earth asunder,—far- reaching Heroes, they have made good offspring.&#8221; Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>This is the biggest blunder here, Veda states that Ribhus were mortals and attained godhood through their deeds (Rig Veda 4.35.8) then how come it were them who created earth and heaven? Another blunder mentioned below is that Veda are confused about who created earth and heaven, what was created first, the earth or the heaven?<strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.185.1 &#8220;Which of these two, (Heaven and Earth), is prior, which posterior; how were they engendered; (declare), sages, who knows this? verily, you uphold the universe of itself, and the days (and nights) revovle as if they had wheels.&#8221; Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Creation of earth and heaven is ascribed to various deities such as to Soma and Pushan (Rig Veda 2.40.1); Dhatr (Rig Veda 5.190.3); Hiranyagarbha (Rig Veda 10.121.9); Purusha (Rig Veda 10.90.14)</p>
<p><strong>Earth and Heaven are creator of Gods<br />

<p>Rig Veda 1.159.1 &#8220;I PRAISE with sacrifices mighty Heaven and Earth at festivals, the wise, the Strengtheners of Law. Who, having Gods for progeny, conjoined with Gods, through wonder-working wisdom bring forth choicest boons.&#8221; Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>

<p>Rig Veda 3.43.14 states that Kikatas brings no Soma mixed with milk to the Vedic deities which suggests that even non-Aryan Kikatas inhabiting in present day Bihar possessed Soma and tasted Soma. Moreover there are also verses stating that Soma was with the Gandharvas and there are many such verses which states Soma was drunk on earth which contradicts above verse which says that no one has ever tasted Soma on earth.</p>

<p><strong>Six<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 2.27.1 &#8220;THESE hymns that drop down fatness, with the ladle I ever offer to the Kings Ādityas. May Mitra, Aryaman, and Bhaga hear us, the mighty Varuṇa Dakṣa, and Aṁśa.&#8221; Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>In later texts the number of Adityas given are twelve. But we are dealing only with the Vedas which gives varying numbers. Rig Veda 10.72.8 is much clear about number of Adityas, it states that there were total number of eight Adityas of whom Martanda died and was later brought back to life. Rig Veda 2.27.1 mentions six Adityas by their names, they are Mitra, Aryaman, Bhaga, Varuṇa, Dakṣa and Aṁśa. Atharva Veda 11.6.2 mentions all these with Vivasvan also, Rig Veda verse quoted earlier mentions Martanda as an Aditya, so now we know eight Adityas by name.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s assume that number of Adityas given in Vedas are eight but it makes the situation more complex because apart from those eight Adityas, Veda mentions various other deities as Adityas. In Atharva Veda 13.2.29, 37 Surya is called Aditya and son of Aditi. In Atharva Veda 8.2.15 Sun &amp; Moon are called two sons of Aditi, Rig Veda 8.90.11 calls Surya (sun) as Aditya. Rig Veda 8.18.3 also mentions Savitar as Aditya but for the sake of argument lets count Savitar as sun here. Indra is considered Aditya along with Varuna in Rig Veda 7.85.4, however in Rig Veda 5.51.10 Indra is mentioned separately from Adityas.</p>

<p>Black Yajur Veda 3.4.9.7 &#8220;…the Rudras are eleven…&#8221; Tr. Arthur Berriedale Keith</p>
<p>There is no clear mention of 11 Rudras in the Veda. However Yajur Veda verse quoted above seems to explain number of Rudras, Adityas and other group of deities. Later text like Taittriya Samhita (Black Yajur Veda) is clear on number of Rudras.</p>

<li><span style="color: #0070c0; text-decoration: underline;"><strong>WHO WAS THE FIRST ONE TO DRINK SOMA?<br />
</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Brahman (Supreme God)<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Atharva Veda 4.6.1. The Brâhmana was the first to be born, with ten heads and ten mouths. He was the first to drink the soma; that did render poison powerless.</p>
<p><strong>Vayu<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 4.46.1 &#8220;DRINK the best draught of Soma-juice, O Vāyu, at our holy rites: For thou art he who drinketh first.&#8221; Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.134.1 Vayu, let fleet-foot coursers bring thee speedily to this our feast, to drink first of the juice we pour, to the first draught of Soma juice.</p>
<p>Rig Veda 2.11.14 …the Vayus, who drink the first libation of the Soma.</p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.135.4 … Vāyu, to taste the offerings! Drink of the pleasant-flavoured juice: the first draught is assigned to you.</p>
<p><strong>Indra<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Atharva Veda 20.99.1; Rig Veda 3.36.8 says that Indra was invited to drink Soma first. These two verses may be in a sense of Indra being invited at sacrifices to drink Soma first but contradiction can&#8217;t be ignored. Some verses states that Vayu was the first drinker and some later texts like Aitareya Brahmana elaborating this story says that there was a race between gods on who should partake Soma first, Vayu won the competition and Indra came second. But this story is in contradiction with story of falcon Suparna bringing Soma to Indra. Rig Veda states that the falcon had brought the Soma, Krishna Yajur Veda is more clear in this case wherein it states that the gods didn&#8217;t had Soma and Soma was brought by the falcon.</p>

<p><strong>Enemies</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.53.10 &#8220;Thou hast protected Suśravas with succour, and Tūrvayāṇa with thine aid, O Indra. Thou madest Kutsa, Atithigva, Āyu, subject unto this King, the young, the mighty.&#8221; Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>Rig Veda 2.14.7 &#8220;Ye ministers, to him who slew a hundred thousand, and cast them down upon earth&#8217;s bosom; Who quelled the valiant men of Atithigva, Kutsa, and Āyu,—bring to him the Soma.&#8221; Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>There are also verses wherein Indra aided Kutsa in battle against Kutsa&#8217;s enemies suggesting their friendly relationship. Later texts like Brahmanas gives different story that Kutsa was the son of Indra born from his thighs. Though Veda calls Kutsa as son of Arjuna (Rig Veda 8.1.11). If that is applied here then there will be another contradiction because Veda calls Indra and Kutsa as friends so there would be contradiction in their relationship.</p>

<p>Written by Sulaiman Razvi</p>
<p>Internet has given us the opportunity to express our views, many times internet is misused. Many people especially Hindu fanatics misuse internet by abusing other religions especially Islam even if the post is not even remotely related to Muslims. While the whole world was mourning for the victims of Christchurch Mosque attack, Hindus in India were celebrating the attack. While only this reaction on NZ attack by Hindus caught the attention of Muslims but the fact is that Hindus have been rejoicing over the death of Muslims much before the Christchurch attack happened. Indian Muslims usually blames politicians for dividing Hindus and Muslims on religious line but in reality majority of Hindus harbours hatred against Muslims. Hindus have always celebrated attack on Muslims and justified it, what does that mean? It means that Hindus are happy that someone else is doing the job they wanted to do. Majority of Hindus has genocidal intention, if they get a chance to slaughter Muslims they would happily do it. Hindus have so much hatred against Muslims that if destruction of their family leads to the extinction of Muslims then they would happily butcher their own family. While it’s true that Islamophobia can be seen in many parts of the world but no one stoops down so low as the Hindus who uses slang words against non-Hindus and Dalits. I have seen several non-Indian anti-Muslims but I have never come across any Anti-Muslim using abusive language like Hindus does or having the mentality like Hindus, but those terms have become common usage on Indian social media and websites. Journalist <a href="http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-worse-than-trump-supporters-when-mehdi-hasan-discovered-online-hindutva-trolls-2160082" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Mehdi Hasan<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> was shocked to see the mindset of Hindu trolls after he interviewed Hindu leader Ram Madhav.</p>
<p><span id="more-5274"></span></p>
<p>The celebration by Hindus over Christchurch attack is a wake-up alarm for Indian Muslims. <a href="http://vedkabhed.com/index.php/2013/10/06/how-peaceful-are-hindus/" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Hindu leaders calling for the persecution of Muslims<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> has been normalized now, no one bats an eye when any Hindu leader does that. But what’s worth noticing is that the common Hindus too has such a mentality. It’s not that Hindus were not upset after the NZ attack, they were but not because 50 Muslims were killed but because of the love and support poured down on Muslims after the NZ attack. Hindus are no different than the pagans of Arabia, both Hindus and pagans practice female foeticide, used to sacrifice children for their gods and goddesses. The Quran perfectly describes the hatred of Hindus against Muslims,</p>
<p>Quran 9:50-51 “If good befalls thee, it grieves them; but if a misfortune befalls thee, they say, “We took indeed our precautions beforehand,” and they turn away rejoicing. Say: “Nothing will happen to us except what God has decreed for us: He is our protector”: and on God let the Believers put their trust.”</p>
<p>Hindus were very hurt to see the world standing in solidarity with the Muslims since they thought that the whole world is as inhuman and as barbaric as them and expecting the world to celebrate attack on fellow humans and justify the NZ massacre. After all for them only lives of cows and Hindus matter, you can’t expect humanity from followers of a Dharm which sanctions Human sacrifice, Widow burning and encourages female foeticide. Almost every major Hindu festival is nothing but celebration of someone’s death, they celebrate Dushera which celebrates the killing of Ravana, story of Holi is about burning of Holika, Durga Puja is about killing of Mahishasura, every Hindu god &amp; goddess is depicted wielding weapons, now you can guess why Hindus has habit of celebrating deaths of non Hindus. New Zealand’s response to Christchurch attack is exemplary, it has set an example for the whole world especially for the “5000 years old way of life” in India. Another thing worth mentioning is the absence of Nationalism/Patriotism and love for fellow Indians after the attack. Some seven Indian Muslims were killed in NZ attack but Hindus felt no pain for fellow Indians, it debunks their claim that Nation is above Religion, had it been so then they would’ve mourned the death of 7 Indian Muslims killed in NZ attack.</p>
<p>Don’t ignore Hindu’s views on the internet as work of trolls because internet is a place where people usually express their opinion which cannot be aired publicly as internet guarantees more “Freedom of speech”. And this mentality is not confined to internet alone, there are several instances where Hindus came out on the streets to support killers of Muslims such as those hundreds and thousands of Hindus holding Indian flag the tricolor in their hands and <a href="https://thewire.in/225080/hindu-ekta-manch-bjp-protest-support-spo-arrested-rape-jammu" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">marching in support of rapists &amp;

Hindus are so hateful towards Muslims that they inspire mass murderers like <a href="https://countercurrents.org/2019/04/04/from-christchurch-to-india-how-indias-rss-inspires-white-nationalist-violence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Anders Breivik<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. Adolf Hitler was also inspired by Hindu extremism. He adopted the Swastika symbol and was proud of his Arya race.</p>
<p>Hindus hailing killers of Muslims is nothing new. Narendra Modi was elected Chief Minister of Gujarat thrice and Prime Minister twice by Hindus only because of <a href="http://www.catchnews.com/india-news/ehsan-jafri-called-modi-for-help-i-heard-modi-abuse-him-gulberg-survivor-1464888144.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">his role in 2002 Gujarat riots<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/12/world/asia/india-yogi-adityanath-bjp-modi.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">The New York Times interviewed one Sonu Yadav<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> from Gorakhpur who was honest with his views, he said, “<em>We voted for Modi because Yogi endorsed him, but we are disillusioned,” he said. He went on to refer to the 2002 riots in the state Mr. Modi led, which his critics say he allowed to rage for several days, leading to more than 1,000 deaths. All of us in our colony felt that Modi would allow us to kill Muslims,” he said. “Muslims were scared. But nothing happened. When Yogi became chief minister, they were scared again</em>.”</p>
<p>Whenever there’s a riot, Hindus would abuse Muslims and denigrate Islam but Muslims won’t do that, Muslims’ usual response would be ‘<em>preparation for upcoming election by politicians has begun</em>‘, innocent Muslims parrots their religious scholars who are blind in Hindu-Muslim Bhaichara aka the Ganga Jamuna Tehzeeb. But what Indian Muslims didn’t notice is that how come politicians use riots to garner votes? Has Indian Muslims ever asked themselves this question? They need to ponder over it. Politicians orchestrate riots because it really works, Hindus are entertained by the sufferings of Muslims and they would vote anyone who harms Muslims. If Hindus had not given any importance to Hindu politicians starting riots against Muslims then Hindu politicians would’ve given up the idea and tried other tactics to win elections, Hindu politicians just echoes their Hindu followers. I want to ask Muslims, would you vote for any Muslim candidate if he starts a riot against Hindus or spews venom against them? But your Hindu brothers does that every time, their basis for casting vote is not based on any development agenda, they vote for such candidate who either spews venom against Muslims or has butchered Muslims in riots. BJP rose to prominence only after it demolished Babri mosque, it came to power soon after demolishing Babri mosque and the riots that followed it. <a href="https://www.newsclick.in/unresolved-2007-gorakhpur-riots" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Yogi Adityanath has alleged involvement in 2007 riot<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> and has also given several hate speeches against Muslims <a href="http://www.sify.com/news/adityanath-asks-supporters-to-convert-100-muslims-for-1-hindu-girl-news-national-oi0xDpiebfeea.html" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">calling for persecution of Muslims<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, <a href="http://zeenews.india.com/news/india/will-install-gauri-ganesh-in-every-mosque-says-yogi-adityanath_1543681.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">vandalism of mosques<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> and his followers telling to <a href="http://www.indiatimes.com/news/india/yogi-adityanaths-men-telling-hindus-to-rape-dead-muslim-women-is-beyond-shocking-230679.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">rape dead Muslim women<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> and distributing <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/bjp-mp-yogi-adityanaths-outfit-offers-guns-to-hindus-in-dadri/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">weapons to Hindus in Dadri to kill Muslims<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> and such a person was elected by Hindus as Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh state. Please bear in mind that such mass murderers and hate mongers are elected by the common Hindu masses. India is probably the only place where murderers and hate mongers are elected as head of the state. States like Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, West Bengal fares better than Gujarat in every aspect then what’s the reason for Hindus’ overwhelming love for Modi? Hindus vote murderers on the pretext of development hoping that Modi would repeat 2002 all over India on a larger scale.</p>
<p>Hinduism is not a peaceful and tolerant religion, in fact, it is very violent and intolerant. Hindus using communal slurs has origin in the Hindu scripture where low caste and non-Hindus are called with objectionable words like Acchoot (Untouchable), Anarya (ill-mannered), non-Hindus are called Asur (demons), Rakashasa, Yavana, Maleccha (Barbarian/foreigner). Hindus have always had enmity and hostility towards non-Hindus. Patanjali a 4<sup>th</sup> century Hindu scholar considered the relationship between Buddhists and Brahmins to that of snake and mongoose, Adi Shankaracharya had spent his life denigrating Buddhism and persecuting Buddhists, another Hindu scholar Kumarila Bhatta was a critic of Jainism, Madhavacharya considered Adi Shankaracharya as reincarnation of Shiva for putting an end to Buddhism, 19<sup>th</sup> century Hindu scholar Swami Dayanand Saraswati was critical of almost every religion whose main target was Islam and considered <a href="/index.php/2014/05/14/mulshankar-on-jainism-and-buddhism/" data-wpel-link="internal">Jainism to be a stupid religion</a>, 20<sup>th</sup> century scholar Swami Vivekananda too had given hate speeches against Islam, Hindu poet Rabindranath Tagore had also denigrated Islam, Founder of RSS <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=dfSHAwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">K.B. Hedgewar<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> described Muslims as ‘hissing Yavana snakes’, had to be put in place or they were to face extinction become ‘dead as a dodo’. Said that the struggle for India’s freedom became a ‘religious war’ against Muslims, and so on, also said that Buddhism is a religion of cowardice. Hindu political leader <a href="https://scroll.in/article/808788/reading-savarkar-how-a-hindutva-icon-justified-the-idea-of-rape-as-a-political-tool" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Savarkar had justified rape of Muslim women<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> as a political tool &amp; wanted to <a href="https://www.dailyo.in/politics/tom-treanor-vd-savarkar-mahatma-gandhi-hitler-nationalist-hindu-mahasabha/story/1/20207.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">treat Muslims the way Negroes<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> were treated, RSS stalwart <a href="https://countercurrents.org/2017/01/17/anti-national-rss-documentary-evidences-from-rss-archives/" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Golkwalkar considered Muslims<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, Christians and Communists as internal enemies and wanted to transfer Delhi Muslims to Pakistan. These were not some Tom, Dick &amp; Harry, these were all prominent Hindu personalities and they had such hateful views of other religions, you could imagine what small-time Hindu scholars and politicians used to say against other religions. And this consistent brainwashing &amp; hate against other religions have turned the Hindu masses into monsters longing for blood of Muslims, Dalits and other minorities. They teach their children to hate Muslims &amp; Dalits <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-42650106" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">1<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJEfaHr2tmY" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">2<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, <a href="https://www.news18.com/news/india/up-students-refuse-mid-day-meal-prepared-by-lower-caste-cook-school-throws-out-food-after-protest-1871653.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">3<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/bangalore/watch-at-an-rss-inspired-school-in-karnataka-students-reenact-demolition-of-babri-masjid-6169961/" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">4<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. Can you show me few such hate speeches against Hindus by prominent Muslim leaders of the 20<sup>th</sup> century? Even to this day hundreds of Hindu leaders spew venom against Muslims and Muslim leaders don’t make such provocative speeches against Hindus except for 1-2 leaders who were jailed for their speeches. This softness against Hindu extremists is what encourages them to insult us not just in India, we have seen Hindus abusing Muslims even while <a href="/index.php/2013/10/16/hindus-in-arab-countries/" data-wpel-link="internal">working in Muslim countries</a>. It has become common for Hindu masses to use communal slurs against other religions especially against Muslims. Don’t forget that the weakest kid in the class gets bullied the most. Muslims must develop the same mentality against Hindus which Hindus have for us, Muslims must develop the same sentiments against Hindus which Hindus have for us, Muslims must reply in the same tone and language which they use against us. I am not instigating you against Hindus, I am not provoking you to take up arms against Hindus. Violence is not a solution. Indian Muslims consider Hindus as their brothers while Hindus are ready to stab in the back. I just want you to recognize the real face of the Hindu community, a known enemy is always better than an enemy hiding as a friend. This article is intended only as an eye-opener to serve as a wake-up alarm for Muslims, to show them what their Hindu brothers think of them and their religion. Once you start replying to Hindus in their language then they will think twice before insulting Islam and Muslims. No matter how good you treat them, in the end, they will malign you and <a href="/index.php/2014/10/30/ungrateful-hindus/" data-wpel-link="internal">history proves it</a>. Their hatred has gone to the extent of calling for our persecution and justifying the persecution of Muslims. In ancient India Hindu scholars like Adi Shankaracharya, Kumarila Bhatta… used to denigrate other religions and after annihilating Buddhists and Jains they have come for Muslims, Christians and other minorities and the responsibility of insulting non-Hindus is carried on the shoulders of modern Hindu scholars, refer the article <a href="/index.php/2016/06/20/violence-in-hinduism/" data-wpel-link="internal">Killing Infidels in Hinduism</a> in the category Intolerance Towards Other Religion to see modern Hindu scholars’ views on non-Hindus. Whereas gullible Muslims are busy building a positive image of Hinduism by saying that Hindutva is different from Hinduism and quoting a handful of Acharya Pramod Krishnan, Laxmi Narayan’s views on Islam. One of the first steps Muslims must take is to start referring to Hindu terrorists as Hindu Terrorists and not Sanghis, Bhakts, activists, nationalists or at least you could use the term ‘Hindutva’. Because the majority of them has anti-Muslim sentiments so we should instead differentiate Secular Hindus from Hindus instead of differentiating radical Hindus who form majority of the Hindu community. Hindus always link Islam with terrorism while openly support Hindu Terrorism in India which is the real threat. I am not generalizing, it is very wrong to do that, India’s religious minorities owe a lot to the secular Hindus, had secular Hindus not been there, India would’ve witnessed annihilation of minorities long ago but I can’t ignore the fact that secular Hindus are minority among Hindus and radical Hindus forms the majority.</p>

Considering these facts it is safe to conclude that the Hindu majority of India is the most hateful, bigoted community in the whole world, you cannot find such lot anywhere in the whole planet. Yet they shamelessly claim to be most tolerant and inclusive of other religions and also claims that minorities are safe in Hindu majority India despite every community being targeted by Hindu Terrorists may it be Sikhs in 1984, 1989, Christians in Kandhamal riots, persecution of Muslims and Dalits have become routine. Hindus, whether they are politicians, religious scholars, celebrities, common people, teen or old, man or woman all of them, are dehumanizing Muslims while they live comfortably in Muslim &amp; Christian majority countries like Malaysia, Indonesia, Bangladesh, UAE, US, UK… Imagine what if these countries treat their Hindu minority the way Hindus treat Muslims, Christians and Dalits in India? Hindus are concerned about minority rights when in minority but supports Hindu extremism when in majority, <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/india/liberal-in-us-conservative-in-india-survey-finding-on-indian-americans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">The online survey<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, conducted in September 2020 by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Johns Hopkins University, and the University of Pennsylvania says, “Hindus and non-Hindus agree (the latter more so) that white supremacy is a threat in the United States, but significantly diverge on the threat posed by Hindu majoritarianism in India.” There&#8217;s demonization of Muslim countries, even some secular Hindus doesn’t criticize Hindu fascism without involving Muslims into it. They compare Hindutva extremism with Muslim countries and asks whether we want to become like so and so Muslim country? Considering the above points I say India has its own uniqueness when it comes to extremism so Hindu extremism can’t be compared to any Muslim nation. According to Hindus, Muslims in India are not discriminated because India had 4 Muslim Presidents which is proof of inclusiveness but this logic is not to be applied to Mughals and other Muslim rulers who had numerous Hindu ministers and commanders. Can racial discrimination in the west be ignored just because the USA had Barack Obama a black as its President? Indian Muslims were given fair treatment only by Secular Hindus and the majority radical Hindus have no right to take credit for that, this is why intellectuals are showing concern for growing intolerance in the country. Another answer put forth is that the Indian Muslim population is increasing hence they are not discriminated, even <a href="https://www.indiatvnews.com/news/india/hinduism-fastest-growing-religion-in-pakistan-saudi-arabia-51516.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Hindu population is fastest growing in Pakistan<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. Would Hindutvadis apply the same logic to Pakistan as well? India is <a href="https://qz.com/india/959802/india-is-the-fourth-worst-country-in-the-world-for-religious-violence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">ranked<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> 4th worst country for religious violence. A survey by <a href="https://factchecker.in/our-new-hate-crime-database-76-of-victims-over-10-years-minorities-90-attacks-reported-since-2014/" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Factchecker.in<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> provides great insight into the oppression and persecution of Indian Muslims though the survey seems to be of some selected incidents, the survey shows that Muslims, who comprise 14% of India’s population, were the victims in 62% of cases, whereas Hindus are victims only in 10% of hate crimes, Of the 172 cases in which the religion of the alleged perpetrator is known, 86% cases involved Hindus (148 cases), Hate Crime Watch shows. In 13% or 22 cases, the attackers were Muslim, hate crimes–66% or 167 cases–have been reported from states run by the BJP.</p>

<p>Hindus usually says the opposite, Hindus claim that Muslims kill girl for marrying a Hindu whereas Hate Crime Watch recorded at least 36 crimes committed over a bias against interfaith relationships. In 64% or 23 such cases, the victims involved were Muslim. Ironically Hindus who kills couples for inter-caste marriages accuses Muslims of being intolerant of inter-faith marriages. As per the survey by <a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/86-killed-in-cow-related-violence-since-2010-are-muslims-97-attacks-after-modi-govt-came-to-power/story-w9CYOksvgk9joGSSaXgpLO.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Indiaspend<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> 86% of people killed in cow-related violence were Muslims.

Instead, largely, they’re shown as terrorists without delving into the reasons why. In my book, Kurbaan (2009) has been the worst B-Town offender of the clutch, because of its sweeping generalisations and dismaying divisive tenor. Or Muslims are caricatured as bomb-chucking lumpens and dons seated on throne-like chairs in dimly lit ghettos” [end quote].

As if demonizing Muslim rulers through Saffronization of history wasn’t enough. Hindus uses numerous tactics to provoke Hindus against Muslims, when they spread fake data of declining Hindu population in <a href="https://www.indiatvnews.com/news/india/hinduism-fastest-growing-religion-in-pakistan-saudi-arabia-51516.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Pakistan<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> and <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/india/hindu-population-in-bangladesh-increasing-sushma-swaraj-in-rajya-sabha-5266275/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Bangladesh<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> then they don’t really mean that, they actually tell fellow Hindus to reduce Muslim population in India <a href="https://scroll.in/latest/809537/its-time-to-rid-india-of-muslims-sadhvi-prachi-says-in-communal-strife-torn-roorkee" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">1<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, <a href="http://www.hindustantimes.com/assembly-elections/need-to-reduce-population-bjp-gujarat-candidate-in-apparent-reference-to-muslims/story-9PDNp03Z2t33xBFerCIhoM.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">2<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>.

There have been numerous calls by <a href="/index.php/2013/10/06/how-peaceful-are-hindus/" data-wpel-link="internal">Hindus to socially and economically boycott</a> Muslims. Shops owned by Muslims are often targeted by Hindu extremists during riots to further weaken the Muslim community economically. Hindus have been consistently calling for an economic boycott of Muslims. They bear so much hatred for no valid reason. They have been taught to hate Muslims since their childhood. If they really want to boycott Muslims then they must destroy nuclear missiles given by a Muslim. That would be a very good start. Saudi Arabia is going to invest 100 billion dollars in India, Hindus must refuse that investment. Modi must not go to Muslim countries begging for investments. 3.1 million Hindus are living in Gulf countries earning their bread and butter in Muslim countries, they must be called back to serve Bharata Mata. Apart from that, there are approx. 30 million Hindus living in Bangladesh, Indonesia, Malaysia. Hindus living in these countries must stop purchasing from Muslims.</p>
<p>Muslims are a strange lot, Muslims don’t tolerate other sects and considers them to be Kafirs, Bidati, Qabarparast but when it comes to countering Islam hating Hindus verbally they cite Quranic verses about tolerating other religions as an excuse for their cowardice &amp; incapability to give a befitting response. Hindus started writing against Islam from the 19<sup>th</sup> century onwards and Ulemas of that time didn’t have time to read Hindu scriptures and expose them as they were busy in declaring fellow Muslims as Kafirs for difference in Aqeedah because for them someone insulting Islam and holy prophet ﷺ was a lesser sin compared to other Muslims have difference in Aqeedah. And it is for this reason that Hindus will for writing against Muslims grew stronger day by day. Have a look at Muslim countries, Muslim countries have hatred for one Muslim country because that country adheres to different sect, they are boycotting another Muslim country due to geopolitical reasons whereas they are busy conferring awards to Modi the killer of Muslims. Sect A hates B sect because B sect doesn’t respect three Khalifas and Ummul Momineen, another Sect C hates sect A because sect A is Gustakhe Rasool. All these three sects read the same Quran, worships the same god, believes in the same final prophet yet they have so much hate against each other but doesn’t say a word against Islam bashing Hindus who use abhorrent words for holy prophet ﷺ Islam and Quran. Indian Muslims blames only BJP for communal violence because that&#8217;s what they are told. I would like to ask Indian Muslims a question, was Pushyamitra Shunga a BJP leader who persecuted Buddhists? Did BJP exist when Raja Ganesha destroyed numerous mosques? Did BJP exist when Jaswant Singh of Marwar destroyed mosques? Riots against Muslims started from the 18th century onwards as soon as powerful Muslim rulers passed away, were there any BJP, RSS or Bajrang Dal at the time? Hindus were always radicalized, their politicians used to spew venom against Muslims in the 19th century, their religious scholars wrote books against Islam from the 19th century. This helped them create more hatred among Hindus against Muslims, Hatred doesn&#8217;t develop overnight, BJP just cashed that hatred of Hindus to come to power.</p>

<p>Its only after the NZ attack that Muslims noticed how Hindus rejoices over death of Muslims, since Hindus likes to do all mischief and not get caught so when they were caught with their pants down they tried their usual trick of whataboutery, they cited Pakistani and Kashmiri’s response on Pulwama as an excuse for their reaction on NZ attack. I don’t know how Pulwama and Christchurch attacks are related to each other. Didn’t Hindus rejoice when Pakistani soldiers were killed? There’s a difference between Pulwama and Christchurch, one was related to nation and the other was related to religion, among the Pulwama victims, there was one Muslim soldier also. Ironically Hindus who were upset over Pakistani and Kashmiri’s reaction on Pulwama were the ones who cheered when an innocent Kashmiri Muslim Farooq Ahmed Dar was tied to jeep and taken through the streets, he had gone out to cast his vote, the scene was reenacted in a movie where the protagonist ties a Kashmiri to Jeep and Hindus were printing T-Shirts of the act to cheer it. Hindus usually justify violence against Muslims by calling it retaliation. Wondering if it were Muslims who started the 1984, 1989 riots against Sikhs? Were it Muslims who started the 2008 Kandhamal riots against Christian and burned Christian missionary Staines along with his family in 1999? Was Ranvir Sena a Muslim organization that killed hundreds and thousands of Dalits? It’s actually Hindus who start riots and then calls it retaliation to justify the violence, ironically Hindus claims to be the most tolerant community in the world, then why such a “Tolerant” community is ready to “Retaliate”? Why is it that such a tolerant community is ready to take up arms against non-Hindus on trivial issues? <a href="http://www.hindustantimes.com/india/riot-breaks-out-after-muslim-barber-refuses-to-shut-shop-on-tuesday/story-TdTFCBmvWPDpOaM1ZczHsO.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Hindus started a riot<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> in Nelliyada village in Karnataka just because a Muslim barber refused to shut his shop on Tuesday because Hindus doesn’t cut their hairs on that day, <a href="https://www.jansatta.com/rajya/karnataka/communal-tension-sirsi-uttar-kannada-karnatka-rss-worker-murder/515620/lite/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Shops belonging to Muslims were burnt down by Hindus<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> in Sirsi Uttara Kannada after a rumour had spread that a Hindu boy was killed by Muslims whereas Muslims didn’t react this way when Hindus killed nearly a hundred Muslims on cow related violence in last five years, in <a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/man-arrested-in-assam-for-posting-pro-pakistan-comments-from-neighbour-s-facebook-account/story-UZUfQROT33p009KHg1BzsI.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">lower Assam<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> Hindus tried to burn down shop of a Muslim man Ahedul Ali after a Hindu man Jyotish Nath created Facebook account in Ali’s name and posted some objectionable contents against India and Hindus but when Hindus came to know about the real culprit they did nothing to the Hindu man’s house, seems the Facebook post was just an excuse to burn down shop of a Muslim, <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/india/right-wing-groups-uttarakhand-town-vandalise-shops-muslims-fake-social-media-post-5126693/" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">in Rudraprayag district of Uttarakhand<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> state Hindus burned down shops belonging to Muslims over a fake Facebook post of minor Hindu girl being killed by Muslims whereas Muslims didn’t burn anything when innocent Asifa was gang raped and murdered by Hindu priest and accomplices in communal hate crime in Kathua. So who are tolerant? There are numerous such cases where “Muslims started the riot (Satire)”. Considering these incidents it seems like Hindus are ready on their toes to attack Muslims and just an excuse is needed.</p>
<p>Muslims must give it a thought, why Hindus elect murderers of Muslims, why Hindu celebrities spew venom against Muslims, why Hindu celebrities get thousands of followers overnight after they spew venom against Muslims? why Hindus on such large scale insults Islam and Muslims? An analysis of hate speech and disinformation on the social networking site Facebook India by a South Asian American human rights and technology research organization shows that the highest proportion of hate speech — 37 percent — is linked to Islamophobia as reported by <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/islamophobia-in-37-of-hate-speech-disinformation-on-facebook-5774337/" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Indian Express<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>.

Wayanad, where Rahul Gandhi was contesting, was vilified right before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections as a place where “decrees are given to kill non-Muslims every Friday.” Muslim doctors were accused of “medical jihad,” a conspiracy theory that they kill Hindus with the fake treatment they offer, with a reference to Gorakhpur’s Dr Kafeel Khan. And “love jihad”, the messages said, was actually meant to feed a black-market organ trade — “Middle class Bharatiya girls do not smoke or drink and maintain their bodies … Ek ladki ki kimat Rs 5 crore hai (one girl costs Rs 5 crore).” Emojis, they found, were used a lot. At least one emoji was present in 52% of the fear speech messages (compared to 44% for the whole dataset). And these emojis have taken on deeply entrenched meanings. Those of the saffron flag, trident, bow and arrow, conch shells and the om symbol were used to represent Hindutva, while dehumanising emojis of demon, devil smileys, pig face and pig were used to represent Muslims.&#8221; According to <a href="https://www.thequint.com/news/politics/narendra-modi-hindutva-lok-sabha-election-results-2019-csds-survey-muslims-sikhs" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Lokniti-CSDS post poll survey<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, “Compared to other communities, a slightly larger number of Hindus said that people should have the right to promote violence against other communities, while Muslims were most likely to say that people shouldn’t have such a right. A similar pattern can be seen on the question whether people should have the right to ridicule other communities. Muslims and Sikhs were the most likely to oppose such a right while Hindus and others were more likely to support it, compared to other communities [End quote]”. why crimes against Muslims in India <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/18/world/asia/india-cow-religious-attacks.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">go unpunished<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>? Dr. Zakir Naik was forced to flee on the pretext of flimsy reasons just because he preached his religion whereas Hindus have given shelter to critics of Islam from Bangladesh, Pakistan, Canada, France, Belgium, Australia and so forth and are made to run programs and to write books against Muslims as if Hindu extremists and namesake Muslims bashing Indian Muslims wasn’t enough, I am not naming anyone but you know very well who I am talking about. Muslim bashing is a booming business in India that’s the reason critics of Islam have a great interest in India. You will never see Hindus standing in support of Muslims but you will definitely find Hindus supporting those who are in conflict with Muslims in any part of the world, when French government allowed blasphemy under the garb of freedom, Hindus in India were <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/10/27/istandwithfrance-trends-in-india-amid-outrage-in-muslim-world" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">trending hashtags<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> in support of the blasphemy, when Israel was bombarding Palestine killing hundreds of Muslims, Hindus in India were <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/5/18/bjp-expresses-solidarity-with-israel-as-gaza-bombing-continues" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">trending hashtags<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> in support of Israel, many Hindu politicians also showed their support to Israel because the those who were being killed were Muslims. China is in conflict with India and has usurped Indian territory yet Hindus praise China &#8220;re-education&#8221; camps in which Uyghurs are tortured, Hindus wish that India emulate Chinese camps. Why Islamophobics are given shelter in India? Why Hindus doesn’t want to shelter Rohingya but are giving citizenship to Hindus from Pakistan and Bangladesh, where’s the nationalism now? Why Hindus in India are worrying about Pakistani and Bangladeshi Hindus when nation is first and last for them? Ram Janmabhoomi trust chief <a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/anyone-from-pak-who-has-faith-in-lord-ram-can-come-to-ayodhya-says-ram-janmabhoomi-trust-chief/story-8JYboUV7ihtpBkEegTveNK.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Nritya Gopal Das<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> said, “Pakistan is a part of Akhand Bharat and Hindus living there are our brothers. If he (Kaneria) wants to visit Ram Mandir and offer prayers, then he is most welcome,” VHP leader Sharad Sharma said, “Pakistani Hindus have a blood relation with us and Kaneria’s statement proves this,” Indian Muslims are called Pakistani and are told to go to Pakistani whereas they welcome Pakistani Hindus with open arms, doesn&#8217;t this prove that for them religion is above nation? Go to any non Indian pages and you will definitely see Hindus commenting against Muslims. If you happen to see any Islamophobic comment then check who has liked it, most of them would be Hindus. Check Twitter handles of non-Indian, Non-Hindu Islamophobics most of their followers would be Hindus only, Hindus have so much hatred against us that they would follow anyone who spews venom against us as they believe in enemy of enemy is my friend proverb. If Hindus are secular then why right-wing party is winning every election, According to the CSDS survey 52 percent of all Hindus voted for the NDA, up nine percentage points from 43 percent in 2014? Why Hindu terrorists RSS, VHP, Bajrang Dal has 5 million members each? Why there are hundreds and thousands of riots against non-Hindus every year? According to NCRB, there were 723 communal riots in 2017 alone, there were 1092 victims of these communal riots. This is the official figure, the unofficial figure is always much higher than the official figure. The incidents registered under the Scheduled Caste Prevention of Atrocities Act saw an increase from 5,082 incidents reported in 2016 to 5,775 in 2017. Incidents of crime related to Scheduled Tribes dipped from 844 in 2016 to 720 in 2017.</p>
<p>Why Muslims are marginalized? Why is it that Muslims are attacked during Hindu festivals? Hindu festivals have become more of a show of might rather than celebration where Hindus takes out procession through Muslim dominated areas armed with swords and guns vandalizing mosques, raising objectionable slogans outside mosques and killing Muslims <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/surat/communal-tension-in-surat-for-third-day/articleshow/63571762.cms" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">1<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/delhi-bike-rally-stopped-at-four-mosques-with-swords-and-saffron-flags-5133727/" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">2<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/man-killed-after-trouble-erupted-over-ram-navami-procession-in-kolkata/articleshow/63454273.cms" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">3<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/ludhiana/faridkot-man-assaulted-for-objecting-to-holi-hooliganism-dies-5085099/" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">4<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, <a href="https://www.news18.com/news/india/dont-want-more-houses-to-burn-will-leave-if-theres-retaliation-asansol-imam-on-sons-death-1703863.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">5<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. And in case if Muslims reacts then Muslims are accused of pelting stones at “peaceful procession”, like in the case of <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/agra/video-shows-kasganj-mohalla-preparing-for-r-day-surrounded-by-tiranga-yatra-youths/articleshow/62729675.cms" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Kasganj violence<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> where Hindu mob attacked Muslims who were busy preparing for Republic Day celebration and then it was claimed by Hindus that Muslims killed a Hindu for chanting Bharat Mata Ki Jay, later <a href="http://www.jantakareporter.com/india/kasganj-communal-riots-new-cctv-footage-shows-muslims-preparing-republic-day-attacked/171505/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">CCTV footage<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> showed that Chandan Gupta was a rioter who was attacking Muslims. Why crimes are given religious color? If a Muslim is involved in any crime like murder, theft or rape then his religion is highlighted by Hindus though majority of crimes are committed by Hindus in India, it is a way to demonize Muslims and portray the Muslim community as a community of criminals, they can’t even differentiate a stray crime and a hate crime. Why Indian Muslims living in Indian states bordering Bangladesh are called Bangladeshi while the rest of the Indian Muslims (baring Kashmiris) are called Pakistanis? A party that doesn’t spew venom against Muslims or hasn’t persecuted Muslims is accused of doing “Muslim Appeasement”. The Sachar Committee report shows how much Muslims have been appeased. Reports by <a href="https://thewire.in/rights/christophe-jaffrelot-majoritarian-state-muslims-parliament" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">TheWire.in<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> &amp; <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/muslims-politicians-in-india-bjp-narendra-modi-government-5282128/" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Indian Express<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> showed that Muslims are greatly underrepresented in the Parliament because it’s the people who choose MP and Hindus doesn’t like Muslim candidates, the survey also shows that even the Congress Party is reluctant to field Muslim candidates in Hindu majority constituencies because they know that Hindus won’t vote for Muslims, approx. 20 Muslims had won the 2014 Lok Sabha election out of 543+2 Lok Sabha seats and they won only from constituencies which are Muslim majority or has sizeable Muslim population, obviously, this is an indication of Hindus’ unlikeness for Muslims. During the recent Gujarat assembly elections Hindus were spreading rumor that Congress’ CM candidate is Ahmed Patel, it was a clear expression that “hey look if you vote for Congress then they will make a Muslim man as Chief Minister”, during elections right-wing Hindus spreads pictures of secular Hindu leaders wearing Muslim skull caps and asks their fellow Hindus whether they want a Hindu Hriday Samrat leader or a skull cap-wearing leader. Check news of attack on Indian Muslims in Muslim FB pages or twitter handles, you won’t find a single comment of Muslims bashing Hindus or insulting Hinduism, then go to pro Hindu pages and check their fake news intended to peddle their imaginary victimhood of Hindu Khatre Mein Hain (Hindus are in danger) and you will see most comments are against Muslims and Islam. That’s the difference between them and us which shouldn’t exist because we can’t wait until Hindus start building gas chambers or to turn the condition of Indian Muslims like that of Rohingya Muslims. There are so many FB pages and Twitter handles created by Hindus solely dedicated for maligning Islam, and most of those pages has lakhs and millions of followers, you can’t even name one such page having at least 10K followers dedicated to exposing Hinduism. Muslims must think why Hindus takes video of them attacking Muslims? Because they know very well that they won’t be punished in the undeclared Hindu Rashtra (Hindu State), there won’t be imprisonment in the first place as they would be out on bail just as murderers of Akhlaq, Pehlu, Qasim, Junaid, Gulberg society massacre, Muzaffarnagar riots… are out on bail and if in case they get convicted by mistake then still they would be granted bail like in the case of Ajmer Dargah blast convict Bhavesh Patel, Dhananjay Desai and Gujarat riot convicts Babu Bajrangi and Maya Kodnani. Why such a free hand on murderers of Muslims? According to Hindus, the destruction of Bamiyan Buddha by Taliban terrorists is Islamic barbarism but the demolition of the Babri Mosque by Hindu Terrorists is Shaurya Divas worthy to be celebrated. If Rohingyas are persecuted then Hindus reaction would be <em>Hahaha, dekho mulle har jagah pith rahe hain</em> (hahaha, look Mullas are getting beaten up everywhere) and if IS terrorists kills in Syria then their response would be, ‘Look at these barbaric Mullahs, the religion of peace at work’.</p>
<p>Hindus are so obsessed with Muslims that anything happens and they would definitely drag Muslims which shows that Muslims always revolves around their mind. If a movie is made on fictional Hindu queen Padmavati then Hindus including their leaders like Subramanian Swamy, Togadia &amp; Giriraj dares producers to make a film on Prophet <a href="https://www.outlookindia.com/website/story/can-anyone-dare-to-make-film-on-prophet-mohammed-union-minister-giriraj-singh-as/307481" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">1<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, <a href="https://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/current-affairs/271117/padmavati-comes-in-for-stick-at-dharma-sansad.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">2<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, if someone says to use fewer firecrackers during Diwali in wake of rising pollution then Hindus will question What about Bakrid? Say the same to Mullas <a href="https://theprint.in/opinion/bloodless-bakrid-or-crackerless-diwali-religious-whataboutery-has-marred-festivals/102932/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">1<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, <a href="https://www.indiatimes.com/news/india/as-pollution-yet-again-grips-delhi-after-diwali-angry-people-debate-the-firecrackers-ban-332022.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">2<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. When train mowed down 61 Hindus in Amritsar who were celebrating Dushera on railway tracks, Hindus were not saddened with the loss of lives but they were more concerned whether the driver of the train was Muslim or not and had even started <a href="https://www.firstpost.com/india/amritsar-train-mishap-fake-news-on-muslim-driver-circulated-on-social-media-news-agency-shares-misleading-eyewitness-account-5423751.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">spreading rumour that the driver was Imtiaz Ali or Imtiaz Khan<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. These are a few of the hundreds and thousands of cases.</p>
<p>Hundreds of comments were made by Hindus celebrating NZ attack but I didn’t find a single article or coverage on those comments by any mainstream Indian media. You may have seen numerous Hindus insulting Muslims or Islam but you will rarely find Muslims doing the same against Hindus or Hinduism. Hindus even creates parody accounts in the name Muslims to spread hate and insult Islam <a href="https://www.altnews.in/rajiya-bano-or-sharma-ji-a-fake-hate-spewing-profile-exposed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">1<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> which is then shared by Hindus to show “<a href="https://www.altnews.in/fake-account-anti-hindu-tweets-tripping-right-wing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">How much Muslims hate Hindus<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>” <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.in/entry/election-2019-a-bjp-voters-whatsapp-is-the-stuff-of-nightmares_in_5cb06b64e4b098b9a2d22bf0" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">1<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, they have to create such parody accounts and spread fake news since Muslims are not interested in saying anything against Hindus, it also serves as a lesson for Muslim community who keeps silence over Hindus hatred for Muslims on the internet, Muslims are not concerned about exposing ugly face of Hindus. Muslims do not troll others like Hindus does and does not use abusive language, Muslims trolling is a rarest of the rare case. Some Muslims “trolling” Mohammed Shami, Suhana Sayeed made news headlines, these news were repeatedly reposted on Facebook and broadcasted on television, such posts attracted Hindu trolls who abused Muslims but it didn’t make any headline. I guess Muslims “trolling” Suhana Sayeed was a matter of national security that’s why it was given a lot of coverage but a Hindu BJP leader <a href="https://www.jagran.com/west-bengal/malda-15645956.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Phani Mondal<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> caught (on same week when Suhana was trolled) with 500 bombs in Malda, West Bengal didn’t find place even in newspaper let alone getting attention of mainstream media as media did with Suhana Sayeed, this reminds me of a famous Urdu poetry,</p>
<p>Ham aah bhi karte hai to ho jaate hai badnam<br />
wo qatl bhi karte hai to charcha nahi hota<br />
(I do suffer a slander, when I merely sigh she gets away with murder, no mention of it nigh)</p>
<p>Media is supposed to be unbiased, I was very shocked at the prejudice of Indian media, they randomly picked comments of some Muslims and made it news but Hindus abusing Muslims/Islam has never made headline.</p>
<p>Check news of Hindu terrorists attacking Muslims and go to the comment section, you won’t find Hindu condemning the incident rather they usually justify the attack calling it retaliation and considering it to be Karma and starts their whataboutery to divert the topic. Their whataboutery is nothing but condoning violence against Muslims, you observe that after every attack on Muslims, Hindus would come up with some invented fake news to justify the attack. I am not telling you to follow Pro Hindu Facebook pages and Twitter handles where Muslim bashing is a common scenario, go to general pages like The Times of India, Hindustan Times, The Hindu, News18, Zee News… and check comments of Hindus on posts about Muslims. Hindus leave no stone unturned in bashing Islam and Muslims. Hindus doesn’t have a heart, they justify violence on Muslim children and women as well. I took numerous screenshots of Hindus showing their hatred for Muslims and Islam, making mockery of Islam even on posts completely unrelated to the post but I will post some specific screenshots, more specifically those where Hindus have called for persecution of Muslims and celebrated massacre of Muslims because there is nothing more heinous than celebrating massacre of humans. After a while I stopped taking screenshots because of the extreme hate because it was just unbearable, I wanted to avoid negativity. <strong>I request you to not just read comments but also look at the number of likes such comments get</strong> because a comment is a view of just one person but the number of likes reflects how many Hindus endorses such hateful views. I will also post screenshots of Hindu celebrities showing their hatred against Islam and Muslims. Seems that worshipping animals has deprived them of humanity.</p>

<p>Hindus community is the only community in the world which looks at crimes from religious angle (only if the perpetrator is a Muslim), but they keep their mouth shut on numerous crimes where culprit is from their religion. An example in the above pic where they tried to communalize a crime but later it turned out that the three year old girl beheaded and raped was a Muslim and culprits were from Hindu community. Another example given below, Look at the number of likes, no one cared to check if it is a fake news or genuine one.</p>

<h1><a id="post-6295-7"></a><strong>Hindus calling for Rape of Muslim women and celebrating attack on Muslim women</strong></h1>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Hindus projected themselves as champions of women’s rights when it came to triple talaq but usually they call for rape and murder of Muslim women. When there’s news about attack on Muslim women in the west then Hindus won’t condemn the incident rather they will rejoice and start whataboutery.</p>

<p>As it is rightly said that when something bad happens to Muslims then it becomes a moment of celebration for Hindus and when something good happens then it pains them. Look at how much Hindus are happy after a Muslim woman failed to become Prime Minister of Romania.</p>

<h1><a id="post-6295-8"></a><strong>Reaction of Hindus on suffering of Muslims</strong></h1>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>When there’s news that a mosque was attacked or some country imposed some restrictions on Muslims then Hindus will never ever condemn that rather they will rejoice and start their whataboutery. When a crime against Muslims is reported then never ever expect Hindus to condemn the incident they will come up with all sort of tricks and whataboutery like What about Pandits? Where were you when… why don’t you post about Mullas? Why bring religion?</p>

<h1><a id="post-6295-10"></a><strong>Hindus Insulting Holy Prophet even when the post is irrelevent to Prophet or Islam</strong></h1>
<p>Hindus have no respect for others, they have made it their habit of mocking other faiths and religious personalities. Insulting prophet of Islam is a pass time for them, they insult holy prophet ﷺ even when the post is completely unrelated to Muslims or when a Muslim comments on politics. Reproducing slurs against holy prophet ﷺ is a sin, may Allah forgive me for that, I have erased abusive words against prophet by Hindus. It was very necessary to show you how Hindus makes mockery of other religions. Also check <a href="/index.php/2019/04/15/hindus-calling-for-massacre-of-muslims-celebrating-persecution-of-muslims/#Hindu_Celebrities_Journalists_spewing_venom_against_Muslims" data-wpel-link="internal">Hindu Celebrities and Journalists spewing venom against Muslims</a> category to see some Hindu celebrities, media persons and officers’s blasphemous remark against holy Prophet ﷺ</p>
<p>But before I begin, I would like to show you the difference between Muslims and Hindus. When an Australian ad featured Hindu god Ganesha eating meat, every Muslim was condemning it because Muslims doesn’t find it appropriate to portray other deities or that which could hurt other people but on the other hand Hindus were daring the producer of the ad to make a similar ad featuring Holy Prophet ﷺ ,</p>

<p>Hindus again trended blasphemous hashtag on 29/11/2019. They trended this hashtag on pretext of protesting murder of a lady named Priyanka Reddy in Hyderabad whose one of the culprit happened to be Mohammed Pasha. The other accused in the case were Naveen, Keshavulu and Shiva.<br />

<p>Written by Sulaiman Razvi</p>
<p>Hinduism is perhaps the only religion in the world which has a deity of liquor called Varuni and a god like Shiva associated with Bhang (cannabis). Intoxicant consumption is not unknown in Hindu society. In fact, intoxicants like Bhang and liquor have become ceremonial beverages during Hindu festivals like Holi and Diwali. Bhang (hemp/cannabis) in the form of drink is widely consumed by Hindus during the festival Holi. Even Sadhus spend their lives smoking weed to please their lord Shiva though it is in violation of NDPS act. Dr. B.R. Ambedkar wrote in his book Riddles in Hinduism, &#8220;The ancient Aryans were also a race of drunkards. Wine formed a most essential part of their religion. The Vedic Gods drank wine. The divine wine was called Soma. Since the Gods of the Aryans drank wine the Aryans had no scruples in the matter of drinking. Indeed to drink it was a part of an Aryan&#8217;s religious duty&#8230;Who were denied Soma drank Sura which was ordinary, unconsecrated wine sold in the market. Not only the male Aryans were addicted to drinking but the females also indulged in drinking. The Kaushitaki Grihya Sutra I.11-12 advises that four or eight women who are not widowed after having been regaled with wine and food should be called to dance for four times on the night previous to the wedding ceremony.&#8221;<br />
<span id="more-4848"></span></p>
<p>Consumption of liquor is clearly prohibited in Hindu scriptures and it is considered a great sin (Mahapataka) but some texts allow it under certain conditions, moreover, there are plenty of examples of Gods, Rishis and even Goddesses enjoying liquor. Some text even suggests the use of liquor for offering a libation to Hindu deities. There are approximately 11 types of liquors mentioned in Hindu scriptures such as Sura which is made from grains and was perhaps the most popular drink back then, Maireya which is Rum and made from treacle or molasses, Paista which is made from rice, Madhvika made from flowers, Madhuka made from honey, Panasa taken from jack fruit, Draksa made from grapes, Khajura sambhava made from date fruits, Nalikeraja prepared from coconut palm, Gaudi prepared from molasses, Arista which is a fermented liquor made from soapberry. Wine is praised in various ways in Hinduism, As per Agni Purana 84.1-2 dreaming about ‘wine in the night preceding the day of the ceremony, should be held as the most auspicious ones’, As per Srimad Bhagavatam 5.1.32-33 there are seven islands on Earth which are separated by seven oceans and the oceans are of salt water, sugarcane juice, wine, clarified butter, milk, curds and pure water.</p>
<p>Kumraila Bhatta a 8<sup>th</sup> century Hindu reformer observes, &#8220;Among the people of modern days we find the Brahmana women of the countries of Ahicchatra and Mathura to be addicted to drinking.&#8221; (Tantra-vartika, I.III.4). He condemned this practice in the case of Brahmins only, but not of Ksatriya and Vaisya men and women, if the liquor was distilled from fruits or flowers (Madhvi) and molasses (Gaudi) and not from grains (Sura). Madhavacharya in his Sankara Dig Vijaya Canto 15, verses 1-23 wrote that Adi Shankaracharya along with King Sudhanva traveled to Karnataka where they happened to confront Kapalikas a Shaivite sect who were engaged in drinking liquor in their worship like the Saktas. Then they had a debate on the issue. Which shows that Sadhus consumed liquor in 8<sup>th</sup> century also. Consumption of liquor by Kapalin (Shaivite sect of Hinduism) is much older than this, It is mentioned in Skanda Purana I.i.1.33-34 that Kapalins were engaged in drinking liquor. Liquor or cannabis consumption is not a taboo in the Shaivite sect because of that they are censured by Vaishnavite Hindus. Srimad Bhagavatam a Vaishnavite Purana censures Kapalins in the following way,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 4.2.28-29 “One who takes a vow to satisfy Lord Śiva or who follows such principles will certainly become an atheist and be diverted from transcendental scriptural injunctions. Those who vow to worship Lord Śiva are so foolish that they imitate him by keeping long hair on their heads. When initiated into worship of Lord Śiva, they prefer to live on wine, flesh and other such things.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p><strong>Swami Prabhupada wrote</strong>: “It is sometimes seen that devotees of Lord Śiva imitate the characteristics of Lord Śiva. For example, Lord Śiva drank an ocean of poison, so some of the <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">followers of Lord Śiva imitate him and try to take intoxicants like gāñjā (marijuana)</span>. Here the curse is that if someone follows such principles he must become an infidel and turn against the principles of Vedic regulation. It is said that such devotees of Lord Śiva will be sac-chāstra-paripanthinaḥ, which means “opposed to the conclusion of śāstra, or scripture.’…” <strong>Swami Prabhupada on Srimad Bhagavatam 4.2.28</strong> <a href="http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_4.2.28" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_4.2.28<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>

<h1>Definition of Sura &amp; Asura</h1>
<p>Devas in Hinduism are also called Sura and their enemies i.e. Demons are called Asuras, In later texts like Itihaas and Purana the definition of Sura and Asura given is that the Devas were imbibers of wine hence they were called Sura (literal meaning is liquor) and the demons did not accept liquor hence they were called A-Sura. As per stories mentioned in Hindu texts, Varuni (liquor) was born during the second churning of the ocean (Samundra Manthan) by Devas and Danavas. The Devas accepted her while the Danavas rejected her.</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana, Lalita-Mahatmya 9.66-69 &#8220;When the ocean of Milk was once again churned by the Devas and Danavas, goddess Varuni with tremulous eyes on account of inebriety, rose up even as the Siddhas in the firmament began to think &#8216;What is this&#8217;? She smilingly stood in front of the Asuras. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Daityas did not accept her. </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Therefore</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> they become Asuras</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">They were given the appellation Asura in the sense &#8216;Those who do not have Sura (liquor)</span>&#8216;. Thereupon, she stood in front of Devas. On the direction given by paramesthin (Brahma) Deva joyously accepted her. In view of the fact that they accepted Sura, they became glorified by the appellation Sura.&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Ramayana of Valmiki, Bala Kanda 1, Sarga 45, verses 36-37 &#8220;Oh, Rama, the sons of Diti, namely asuraa-s, have not espoused that daughter of Rain-god, but oh, brave Rama, the sons of Aditi on their part, namely sura-s, have espoused that impeccable Vaaruni. Thereby the sons of Diti are called a suraa-s, and the sons of Aditi are called suraa-s, and gods are delighted and rejoiced on espousing Vaaruni.&#8221; Tr. Desiraju Hanumanta Rao</p>
<p>Mahabharata mentions the vow of Asura which was to abstain from drinking alcohol,</p>
<p>Mahabharata Vana Parva 3, Section 255&#8243;&#8230;And I shall observe the Asura vow&#8230;&#8221; Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Kisari Mohan Ganguli writes, &#8220;The vow of the Asuras was (according to the Burdwan Pundits) never to drink wine&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m03/m03255.htm#fn_83" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m03/m03255.htm#fn_83<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>Varuni is the liquor deity of Hinduism, some texts calls her the wife of Varuna and some considers her the daughter of Varuna. Wine was born after churning of the ocean as per Hindu texts,</p>
<p>Mahabharata Udyoga Parva 5, Section 102 “…<span style="color: #000000;">The gods, uniting with the Asuras, and making the Mandara mountain their pole, churned the waters of the ocean and obtained the wine called Varuni…” Tr. K.M. Ganguli </span></p>
<p>Mahabharata Udyoga Parva 5, Section 98 “…<span style="color: #000000;">Behold now, O companion of the Lord of the celestials, that abode, made entirely of gold, and full of the wine called </span><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Varuni</em></span><span style="color: #000000;">. Indeed, having obtained that wine, the gods acquired their god-heads…” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Consumption of Alcohol by Gods and Goddesses</h1>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Rama &amp; Sita</span></strong></p>
<p>Rama the Maryada Purshottom (ideal man) is said to have made his wife Sita drink wine and then enjoyed the dance of women,</p>
<p>Ramayana of Valmiki, Uttarakhanda 7, Sarga 42, Verses 18-23 &#8220;Like unto Purandara with Sachi <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">he took Sita by the hand, made her sit and drink the wine</span> distilled in the province of Mira. And in no time the servants brought for him <span style="color: #ff0000;">well-cooked meat</span> and various fruits. Being inebriate the beautiful <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Apsaras, well-skilled in the art of singing and dancing, began to dance before Rama</span> in the company of Kinnaris. The virtuous souled Rama, the foremost of those who know how to please, satisfied those beautiful damsels adorned with various ornaments.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">This verse appears in the 52nd Sarga of M.N. Dutt&#8217;s translation but actually, it is supposed to be in the 42nd Sarga. Following is another English translation by Hindu scholar Hari Prasad Shastri,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Valmiki Ramayana, Uttarakhanda 7, Sarga 42, Verses 18-23 &#8220;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Taking Sita by the hand, Kakutstha gave her delicious wine made of distilled honey to drink</span>, as formerly Puandara had offered to Sachi. Thereafter pure viands and fruits of every kind were brought by servants, whilst lovely Apsaras, skilled in the arts of singing and dancing, began to perform in the Prince&#8217;s presence and troops of Nymphs and Uragas, surrounded by the Kinneris intoxicated with wine, danced before Kakutstha, and the virtuous Rama, the most captivating of warriors, delighted those ravishing and charming women.&#8221; Tr. Hari Prasad Shastri</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Following is the Hindi translation with Sanskrit text by Chaturvedi Dwaraka Prasad Sharma,</span></p>

<p>The Sanskrit word mentioned here is Madhu Maireya which is a type of liquor made from honey, Panini defines the word Madhu Maireya as,</p>
<p>Ashtadhyaya Panini, Book VI, Ch 11, verse 70 &#8220;&#8230;Thus ग्रुंडमेरेय: &#8216;the wine maireya prepared from treacle or molasses&#8217;. <span style="color: #ff0000;">मधुमैरेय:</span> &#8216;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">maireya prepared from honey</span>&#8216;. Why do we say when denoting &#8216;an ingredient?&#8217; Observe परममैरेय: Why do we say &#8216;before मेरेय?&#8217; Observe पुष्पासव: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Every sort of spirituous liquor except</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> सुरा</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">is called </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">मेरेय</span>.” Tr. Srisa Chandra Vasu</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="989" height="257" class="wp-image-8880 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Ashtadhyayi-Panini-6.jpeg" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Ashtadhyayi-Panini-6.jpeg 989w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Ashtadhyayi-Panini-6-300x78.jpeg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Ashtadhyayi-Panini-6-768x200.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 989px) 100vw, 989px" /></p>
<p>The above passage also makes the definition of the word Sura (सुरा) clear. Swami Vivekananda wrote,</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p>“…Instances are found in the Râmâyana and the Mahâbhârata of the drinking of wine and the taking of meat by Rama and Krishna, whom they worship as God. Sita Devi vows meat, rice, and a thousand jars of wine to the river-goddess, Gangâ!”<br />
<a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Complete_Works_of_Swami_Vivekananda/Volume_5/Writings:_Prose_and_Poems/The_East_and_The_West/Food_and_Cooking" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Complete_Works_of_Swami_Vivekananda/Volume_5/Writings:_Prose_and_Poems/The_East_and_The_West/Food_and_Cooking<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p></blockquote>
<p>When Hanuman met Sita in the Ashok Vatika, he informed Sita about the condition of Rama, he told Sita that Rama has given up consumption of liquor and meat due to the grief of being separated from her,</p>
<p>Ramayana of Valmiki, Sundara Khanda 5, Sarga 36, verse 41 &#8220;Rama is not eating meat, nor indulging even in spirituous liquor. Everyday, in the evening, he is eating the food existing in the forest, well arranged for him.&#8221; Tr. K.M.K. Murthy</p>
<p>We know that Rama was a meat-eater, when he was about to go to Vanvaas (exile into the forest) he lamented that he would have to live in the forest without meat. So this verse indicates that Rama also consumed liquor. A verse from Ayodhya Kanda of Valmiki Ramayana states that Sita vowed to offer hundred cups of wine to the goddess if her wish is fulfilled,</p>
<p>Ramayana of Valmiki, Ayodhya Kanda 2, Sarga 55, verses 19-20 &#8220;Having come near the middle of the Kalindi, Sita prayed unto her, saying, &#8216;Hail to thee, O goddess! I cross thee. If my husband can successfully perform his vow. I will worship thee with a thousand cows and a hundred vessels of wine.&#8221; Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Hanuman</span></strong></p>
<p>The ardent Bhakt of Rama is also said to have taken intoxicants,</p>
<p>Mahabharata Vana Parva 3, Section 145, Verse 86 “…The powerful Hanuman, however, opening his eyes partially looked at him (Bhima) with disregard, with eyes reddened with intoxication&#8230;” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Krishna</span> </strong></p>
<p>In the Mahabharata, Sanjay describes Krishna and Arjuna in the company of Draupadi and Satyabhama (wife of Krishna and an incarnation of Bhudevi), exhilarated by Bassia wine,</p>
<p>Mahabharata, Udyog Parva 5, Section 59, verses 2-5 &#8220;Sanjaya said, &#8216;Listen, O king, as I tell thee the state in which I found Krishna and Dhananjaya. I will also, O Bharata, tell thee what those heroes said; O king, with looks bent down and hands joined together, and with senses well restrained, I entered the inner apartments for conferring with those gods among men. Neither Abhimanyu nor the Twins can repair to that place where <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">are the two Krishnas and Draupadi and lady Satyabhama. There I beheld those chastisers of foes, exhilarated with Bassia wine</span>, their bodies adorned with garlands of flowers.” Tr. Kisari Mohan Ganguli</p>
<p>Renowned Hindu scholar Kumarila Bhatta explained this verse of Mahabharata and justified it by saying that by drinking wine Krishna and Arjuna didn’t transgress the law. Kumarila Bhatta wrote that Sura (prepared from grain) is prohibited whereas Krishna and Arjuna drank Madhu which is not prohibited and that Kshatriyas and Vaishyas can have Madhu and Sidhi (types of liquors made from honey and molasses),</p>
<p>Tantra Vartika, Adhyaya 1, Pada III, Adhi 4(a) “Then remains the case of Krshna and Arjuna being drunk with wine, and having married the daughters of their respective maternal uncles, both being instances of direct transgressions of the law. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">But it is only the wine distilled from grains, which is called &#8216;Sura&#8217;, that is prohibited for the three higher castes;</span> says the Smrti: &#8216;Sura is the impure essence of the grains and it is evil that is spoken of as impure; hence the Brahmana, the Kshatriya and the Vaicya should never drink Sura.&#8217; <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">As for the particular wines &#8216;Madhu&#8217; (wine distilled from certain fruits, as grapes and the like), and the &#8216;Sidhu&#8217; (that distilled from molasses), these are not prohi</span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">bited for the Kshatriya and the </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Vaicya</span>, as &#8216;all intoxicating drinks&#8217; have been prohibited for the Brahmana alone. Though there is a passage that declares &#8216;all the three kinds of wine, the Gaudi (that distilled from molasses) Paishthi (that distilled from grains) and Madhu (distilled from fruits), being the same, they should not be drunk by the Brahmavadis,&#8217; yet here the word &#8216;Brahmavadi&#8217; should be taken as denoted the Brahmanas only, as the word literally means &#8216;one who is capable of teaching Brahma,&#8217; or &#8216;whose duty it is to teach Brahma&#8217;, or &#8216;whose excellence lies in such teaching&#8217;, and as the root &#8216;Vada&#8217; is synonymous with &#8216;Bru&#8217; such duties are distinctly restricted to the Brahmana alone, by such texts as &#8216;from among the three higher castes, the Brahmana alone should teach&#8217;&#8230;Hence we take the passage &#8216;All the three kinds of wine, etc,&#8217; to mean that just as the one, Sura distilled from grains, is not drinkable by the three higher castes, so are all the three undrinkable by the Brahmana otherwise, if the simple prohibition of wine in general were meant, then the words &#8216;Yathava, etc.,&#8217; and &#8216;Brahmavadibhih&#8217; would be totally redundant. The mention of &#8216;the three castes&#8217; we shall supply from out of another verse. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">For this reason, the fact of Krshna and Arjuna both Kshatriyas being intoxicated with &#8216;Madhu&#8217; (grape wine) is in no way a transgression of the law</span>. And, as a matter of fact, we have Vedic texts that distinctly show (1) that the prohibition of wine is for others (i.e, Brahmanas), and also (2) that is distinctly permissible (in the case of others)&#8230;hence the Brahmana should not drink the wine; lest he be attached to evil&#8217;, and (2) &#8216;The Kshatriya should say to the Brahmana &#8216;the drinking of wine does no harm to him who knows this&#8217;, and this latter is with the reference to the &#8216;Madhu&#8217; and the &#8216;Sidhu&#8217; (and not the &#8216;Sura&#8217; which is in no case allowed to anyone else but the Cudra)&#8230;” Tr. Ganganath Jha</p>
<p>As far as my opinion is concerned, Even Sura is not prohibited for Brahmins as Vedas the eternal law for Hindus gives instructions on the consumption of Sura for Brahmins and Kshatriyas. Padma Purana states that Krishna used to drink wine in the company of his wives who also enjoyed wine,</p>
<p>Padma Purana V.89.53-59a &#8220;Then the two, O brahmana, being tired due to many pastimes proper for the times in the groves endowed with vernal breezes on all sides, resort, with their attendants, to the root of a tree, and sitting on a divine seat, drink liquor, O best sage. Then the two, intoxicated due to the liquor, with their eyes closed due to sleep, holding each other&#8217;s hands, being under the influence of Cupid&#8217;s arrows, and desiring to sport, enter, with their words and mind stumbling on the path. There they sport like a female elephant and (the male elephant) the lord of the herd. All the friends also, intoxicated by wine, and with their eyes troubled by sleep (i.e. drowsy) sleep all around in the charming bowers. Again and again incited by his beloved, Krsna, the lord, would go near all, with a separate body (for each) and simultaneously. Having satisfied all of them as a lord of elephants satisfies the female elephants, he would, along with his beloved and with them, go to the lake to sport.&#8221; Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p>A story mentioned in Skanda and Samba Purana goes like this, Narada Muni visited Krishna, and all the Yadu boys received him with their heads bowed down in respect but Samba the son of Krishna didn’t greet him properly, So Narada thought of teaching him a lesson. So he told Krishna that his 16100 wives were sexually attracted to Samba. Krishna doesn’t believe him. Then Narada visits him again after a gap of a few days, there he sees that Krishna along with his wives were engaged in drinking liquor. Narada takes this as an opportunity to teach Samba a lesson so he tells Samba that his father i.e. Krishna is calling him. Samba goes there and sits next to his father Krishna. Intoxicated wives of Krishna becomes sexually aroused seeing the handsome boy and their private parts becomes moistened so much that even their underwear becomes drenched due to arousal. Then suddenly Narada Muni enters the place and all the wives of Krishna gets up to pay respect to Narada Muni and then all their dresses slip from their bodies including their wet underwear. Krishna then curses his wives. So it shows that Krishna used to quaff liquor along with his wives, story mentioned in Skanda Purana is too long, I have tried my best to shorten it while the Samba Purana is a summarized version by Wendy Doniger. The Skanda Purana verse also states that Samba used to enjoy liquor and had illicit relationships with women,</p>
<p>Samba Purana 3.6-55 &#8220;One day Narada came to Dvaraka to see Krsna. All the Yadu boys received him with respect, but Samba, proud of his young beauty and deluded by the fated, inevitable force of the curse, disregarded Narada. To teach Samba a lesson, Narada told Krsna that all of Krsna&#8217;s sixteen thousand wives were in love with Samba. Samba was summoned, and the women, whose minds were blurred by wine, showed inmistakable signs of passion when Samba appeared&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Skanda Purana Book VII, Section I, Chapter 101, verses 1-38 &#8220;At this very juncture (came) venerable sage Narada&#8230;In the court of his wandering at will, he always used to come to Dvaravati to pay a visit to Vasudeva. As he came on quickly all the Yadava youths beginning with Pradyumna remained with their heads (politely) bent down&#8230;but Samba due to the inevitability of the curse, slighted the noble souled Narada as usual. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Being very proud of his youth and handsome features he was forever indulgent in sexual dalliance and liquor</span>. On seeing him impolite and rude, Narada thought thus: Today I shall try to curb this impolite one&#8230;After thinking thus, he spoke to Vasudeva: O most excellent one among Devas, here there are sixteen thousand women. O my Lord, their emotional fondness for Samba is much&#8230;On hearing these words from Narada, Kesava began to think. What has thus been mentioned by Narada may have some truth in it&#8230;Narada went away as he came. A few days thereafter, he returned to Dvaraka. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">On that day the Lord was engaged in drinking liquor after enjoying aquatic sports along with all the members of his Antahpura (inner </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">apartment)&#8230;</span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Staying </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">there the Lord drank the liquor of great auspicious flavour</span>. In the meantime, fully aware that the <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">women were inebriated due to liquor</span>, Narada spoke to Samba: &#8216;O princely youth, do come and stand here. The Lord calls you. It is not proper on my part to stay on there.&#8217; Urged by Narada&#8230;Samba entered quickly and bowed down to his father. He took the seat pointed out by Visnu with natural feeling. In the meantime those women there who were deficient in self control became highly agitated as soon as they saw Samba. As they were staying within the Antahpura so long, they had not seen him before. The liquor had its own effect in making them forget everything. Further they were naturally devoid of self control. Hence their loins became moistened. On seeing an excellent man, the excellent organ of generation of women becomes moistened and dump even if they are observing celibacy or are Yoginis&#8230;After sending Samba in, Narada also came hurriedly closely on the heels of Samba. On seeing the sage coming with pleasant manners, all those women suddenly got up; they were tipsy. Even as Vasudeva was watching, when they got up suddenly their valuable garments got torn and fell down into the pots (of liquor). The clothes clinging to their loins (underwear) also fell separately. On seeing it Hari became angry, he cursed those women: O women, since your minds strayed elsewhere unmindful of me, you will not get into the regions occupied by your husband at the close of your life. Slipping down from the world of your husband as well as from the path of heaven, you will have no refuge and will fall into the clutches of robbers. As a result of this defect and curse, those women, at the time of Krsna&#8217;s heavenward departure, were abducted by robbers belonging to Pancanada even as Arjuna was looking on.&#8221; Tr. Ganesh Vasudeo Tagare</p>
<p>Mahabharata Virata Parva 4, Section 72, Verses 19-28 &#8220;And Krishna gave unto each of the illustrious sons of Pandu numerous female slaves, and gems and robes. And then the nuptial festival set in between the families of the Matsya king and the Pandavas. And then conchs and cymbals and horns and drums and other musical instruments appointed by the Pandavas, began to play in the palace of Virata. And deer of various kinds and clean animals by hundreds were slain. And wines of various kinds and intoxicating juices of trees were profusely collected.&#8221; Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Krishna in the following verse is mentioned as Rama,</p>
<p>Skanda Purana VII.I.202.10-11 &#8220;Rama with the plough as his weapon, went to the city of Dvaravati teeming with delighted and contented people. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">There he indulged in a drunken bout with the persons (ladies) </span>of his Antahpura. After imbibing wine, he seized a mace with his hand and went to the splendid garden of Raivatodyana accompanied by Revati and others. Moving in the midst of groups of women, he went along with faltering steps like an inebriated person&#8230;&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Skanda Purana VII.I.202.31-32 &#8220;The Brahmanas assembled there, were well-versed in the Puranas and were glad to listen to the stories and conducts of the primordial celestial sages. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">On seeing Rama with eyes reddened due to drinking wine</span> they thought, &#8216;He is thoroughly drunk&#8217;, and hurriedly got up and began to honour and adore Halayudha excepting Suta who continued to sit.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Suta kills the Brahmins so Krishna feels the guilt of drinking wine, vows to abstain from wine drinking and also orders corporal punishment to those guilty of drinking wine therefrom. But was the law ever implemented? Because his beloved brother Balrama was addicted to wine and Krishna’s son Samba and grandson Pradumnya is also said to have relished wine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Balarama</strong></p>
<p>Krishna’s brother Balarama was addicted to drinking liquor, several texts mentions this habit of Balarama,</p>
<p>Brahma Purana 90.5-7 &#8220;Roaming about that spot Balarama inhaled the intensive odour of wine. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">After smelling it he experienced the delight that he previously used to have in wine</span>. O sages, thereafter, Balarama saw a current of liquor suddenly falling form Kadamba. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">He derived great joy therefrom. He drank it joyously</span> in the company of cowherds and cowherdesses&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Harivamsa Purana, Visnu Parva 2.41.5-13 &#8220;Then the valiant, auspicious Sankarsana (Balarama), appearing like an elephant roamed on the peak of the mountain, without Krishna. He went under the shade of the kadamba (Nauclea Cadamba) tree, fully blossomed, enjoying the breeze with a faint smell, comfortably. While he was enjoying the breeze there, the smell of (vinous) spirituous liquor entered his nose. Immediately he was affected by the desire to have Varuni, (spirituous liquor). His face appeared dim like the face of an intoxicated person in the afternoon. Then the lord immediately remembered the ancient incident of partaking Amrita (nectar). Then, searching for spirituous liquor, he saw that tree. The water from the rain clouds, showered on the fully blossomed, beautiful tree became the spirituous liquor in the hollows of the tree. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">After drinking that liquor again and again with desire, his body was swaying with intoxication</span>. The eyes on the face of the intoxicated Balarama, with the colour of the moon in winter, started moving and rolling. Born in the hollows of kadamba, that liquor named KdambarI (kadamba liquor) is Varuni in the body form, the nectar liquor of the deva-s.&#8221; Tr. A. Purushothaman and A. Harindranath</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 5.251-11 “Varuńa, in order to provide for his recreation, said to his wife Váruńí (the goddess of wine), &#8220;Thou, Madirá, art ever acceptable to the powerful Ananta; go therefore, auspicious and kind goddess, and promote his enjoyments.&#8221; Obeying these commands, Váruní went and established herself in the hollow of a Kadamba tree in the woods of Vrindávana. Baladeva, roaming about, came there, and smelling the pleasant fragrance of liquor, resumed his ancient passion for strong drink. The holder of the ploughshare observing the vinous drops distilling from the Kadamba tree, was much delighted, and gathered and quaffed them along with the herdsmen and the Gopís, whilst those who were skilful with voice and lute celebrated him in their songs. Being inebriated with the wine…Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>

<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 10.67.9-15 “There he saw Śrī Balarāma, the Lord of the Yadus, adorned with a garland of lotuses and appearing most attractive in every limb. He was singing amidst a crowd of young women, and since <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">He had drunk vāruṇī liquor</span>, His eyes rolled as if He were intoxicated. His body shone brilliantly as He behaved like an elephant in rut…Angered, Lord Balarāma, the best of fighters, hurled a rock at him, but the cunning ape dodged the rock and grabbed the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Lord’s pot of liquor</span>. Further infuriating Lord Balarāma by laughing and by ridiculing Him, wicked Dvivida then broke the pot and offended the Lord even more by pulling at the girls’ clothing. Thus the powerful ape, puffed up with false pride, continued to insult Śrī Balarāma.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Harivamsa Purana 2.46.21-23 &#8220;Meanshile, Gopas, knowledgeable about the place and time, presented the liquor, Varuni to Balarama, the learned soul. At that time, Balarama drank (the liquor) surrounded by the acquaintances. Balarama, who had gone to the interior of the forest drank the stimulating liquor.&#8221; Tr. A. Purushothaman and A. Harindranath</p>
<p>Brahma Purana 84.34-45 &#8220;There in the waters of Yamuna he saw Balarama with a thousand hoods&#8230;His ear-rings were fine.

After having enjoyed her, he became attracted to her; his mind being wholly drawn to her, he remained there in that forest, his mind becoming very passionate.” Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>

All the deities will drink you after you have been sanctified by means of Mantras in the course of sacrifice. After drinking you, purified by the Mantras, let the people attain Siddhi (spiritual achievement), Rddhi (prosperity), strength, heavenly bliss and salvation.

Intoxicated due to the fresh wine and with the eyes rendered red, Saktis fell upon the troops of Daityas in a body and sportively.&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana, Lalita-Mahatmya 35.28 &#8220;By frequently drinking the water therein viz.: wine, the Saktis stationed on its banks become mad with inebriation and play about. They become excessively red (in their faces) due to intoxication.&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana, Lalita-Mahatmya 19.49b-52 &#8220;Then, three deities were stationed on the second step of the leading chariot Cakraratha. They were seated on three (different) seats. They were endowed with eight arms in which they held bows, arrows, a drinking bowl. a citron (fruit) and dagger as well as shields, serpentine noose and a bell of loud sound, They were intoxicated due to liquor&#8230;&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana, Lalita-Mahatmya 20.6-8 &#8220;Three deities viz.: Jrmbhinl, Mohini and Stambhini had occupied the second step at the same centre of that chariot. It resembled a full blown pomegranate flower. The deities who were competent to suppress Danavas, held the pestle, plough and liquor pot studdent with many precious stones and jewels&#8230;&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana, Lalita-Mahatmya 20.25-26 &#8220;On the other side of the same step in a divine temple were stationed two deities well-known as Krodhini and Stambhini. They fanned with two Camaras (Chowries) as the bangles round their tender creeper like hands moved to and fro. They were excessively proud after drinking liquor and the blood of soldiers in the army of demons&#8230;&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Asava (liquor) was given to Devahuti daughter of Swayambhuva Manu and wife of Kardama Muni,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 3.23.28 “The girls, being very respectful to Devahūti, brought her forth, and after bathing her with valuable oils and ointments, they gave her fine, new, spotless cloth to cover her body. They then decorated her with very excellent and valuable jewels, which shone brightly. Next they offered her food containing all good qualities, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">and a sweet inebriating drink called āsavam</span>.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Swami Prabhupada insists that Asava is not liquor but an Ayurvedic drink made from herbs, but then he translates the same word Asava as beer in Srimad Bhagavatam 4.18.16.</p>
<p>Matangi is one of the Mahavidyas, ten Tantric goddesses and a ferocious aspect of Devi, the Hindu Divine Mother. She is considered to be the Tantric form of Sarasvati,</p>
<p>Skanda Purana III.ii.18.146-7 &#8220;They should perform four circumambulations. The couple should cover themselves with a silken cloth and go ahead. After sprinkling water over Matangi the excellent Madhvika (honey that intoxicates) should be taken. The intelligent devotee should worship Matangi with vacal and instrumental music.&#8221; Tr. G.V.

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-size: 16pt;">RISHIS</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Dattatreya</span></strong></p>
<p>The Markandeya Purana tells us that once when the gods were defeated by the demons in a battle, they approached Brihaspati for help. Brihaspati sent them to Muni Dattatreya the son of Rishi Atri. When the gods approached Dattatreya, they found him drinking wine in the company of Lakshmi with whom he also had sex. The gods prayed to him for help, but he pointed out his own faults, drinking, attachment, affection and sexual enjoyment of women. But then the gods told him that he is sinless and he is not stained by these acts,</p>
<p>Markandeya Purana 18.23-32 &#8220;Thus exhorted the gods then went to <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Dattatreya&#8217;s hermitage, and they beheld the high-souled Muni, attended by Lakshmi</span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">hymned by Gandharvas and engrossed in </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">quaffing spirituous liquor</span>&#8230;Daddatreya addressed the prostrate gods, &#8216;What desire ye of me, that ye do me this obeisance&#8230;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">I am drinking strong drink</span>, I have remnants of food in my mouth, nor I subdued my senses. How is it, O gods, ye seek for victory over your enemies even from me?&#8217; <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The gods spoke. Thou art sinless</span>, O lord of the world; no stain hast thou, into whose heart, purified by the ablution of learning, has entered the light of knowledge. True is this, o gods! all learning have I, who am impartial in view: <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">but by reason of association with this woman</span> I am now impure after eating. For commerce with women when continually pursued tends to depravity. Thus addressed, the gods then spoke again. This woman, O sinless brahman! is the mother of the world; she is not depraved&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Lakshmi was present there and then he tells the gods that he had copulation with this woman (i.e. Lakshmi), Padma Purana tells us that Dattatreya had sex with Lakshmi though it doesn’t mention Lakshmi but the above verse attests to this statement,</p>
<p>Padma Purana II.103.110-113 &#8220;Atri&#8217;s son Dattatreya, the high-souled brahmana, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">the great sage, with his eyes red due to (having drunk) spirituous liquor, was sporting with a woman</span>. The virtuous one, intoxicated by wine, having seated a young, auspicious woman, best of all women, on his lap, sang, danced and heavily drank liquor&#8230;&#8221; Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p>Another verse shows that Dattatreya asked a king to bring him some meat and wine and the king presented the same,</p>
<p>Padma Purana II.103.124-8 &#8220;When a long time of many days passed, Dattatreya, in an intoxicated condition, said to the best king: &#8216;Do as I tell you. Give me wine in a cup; and the meal of flesh that is got cooked.&#8217; Hearing those words of him, that Ayu, the lord of the earth, being eager, speedily got wine in a cup, and quickly cut off well-cooked flesh with his hand, and, O best one, the best king, gave these to Dattatreya. That best sage became happy in mind&#8230;&#8221; Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Kashyapa</span></strong></p>
<p>According to Puranas, Kashyapa was a drunkard, he was addicted to wine and thus he was given the name Kashya (wine) + Hasya (laughter),</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana 2.3.1.120-1 &#8220;When Daksa was over-bearing in his speech in regard to his daughters, the holy lord became angry. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Then he drank Kasya. Liquor is called by the name Kasya</span>. The word Kasi should be understood to have the sense of Hasya (Humour, wit). The speech and mind are mentioned by the word Kasya. Liquor is remembered by Brahmanas by means of the word Kasya. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The sage is called Kasyapa due to his drinking liquor</span>.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Vayu Purana, Section II, Ch 4, verse 114-5 &#8220;Kasyapa was the knower of the sun (?) Hence he was on a par with Brahma. In every Manvantara, he is born through a part of Brahma. The subjects were angered by Daksa, it is said (?) for the sake of (his) daughters. Then he drank wine. The word &#8216;Kasya&#8217; means wine. Hascekasa should be known as Brahma&#8217;s Kasya. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Kasya is remembered by Brahmanas as wine. Because he drank Kasya (wiine) he is called Kasyapa</span>.&#8221; Tr. G.P. Bhatt, edited by G.V. Tagare</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Consumption by Kings</span></strong></p>
<p>Liquor drinking seems to have been part of the life of nobles in the Vedic and Puranik period, there are some references to the consumption of liquor by kings,</p>

When thou, with might <span style="text-decoration: underline;">hadst drunk the draught that gladdens</span>, Sarasvatī, O Maghavan, refreshed thee.” Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>Griffith has translated the word Sura as draught here. These verses are also repeated in Yajur Veda 20.76-78 where Griffith has mentioned the word Sura in his translation and I have further explained it in this article in the Sautramani sacrifice category. These verses are elaborated in Baudhayana Srauta Sutra,</p>
<p>Baudhayana Srauta Sutra XVII.35 &#8220;…The Maitravruna recites as the puronuvakya the verse, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">&#8216;O Asvins the guardians of the auspicious, do you two partaking of the Sura-soma in association with the demon Namuci help Indra in his deeds</span>.&#8217; Having crossed the alter and having caused to announce, he says (to the Maitravaruna), &#8216;Do you impel (the Hotr to recite the yajya for the Sura-soma set forth for the Asvins, Sarasvati and Sutraman Indra.&#8217; The Maitravaruna pronounces the call, &#8216;Let the Hotr recite the yajya for the Asvins, Sarasvati and Sutraman Indra.

O Hotr, do you recite the yajya. The Hotr recites the yajya, &#8216;O Asvins, do you favour us with your deed like the parents their son. O Indra, when thou didst consume the Sura-soma in order to achieve good deeds and to possess powers, Sarasvati healed thee&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Chintaman Ganesh Kashikar</p>

<h2><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sautramani and Rajasuya Sacrifices</span></strong></h2>
<p>Wine and Soma are used in the Sautramani sacrifice. Yajur Veda chapters 19 and 21 deal with offering and consumption of Sura (liquor) and Soma mixture in sacrifices like Sautramani, Rajasuya and offerings to departed manes. Satapatha Brahmana, Kanda 12, Adhayaya 7, Brahmana 3, Verses 1-22 describes the Sautramani ritual. It is stated in the same chapter in verse 4 that Sautramani is to be performed to get rid of enemies. Yajur Veda describes the Sautramani sacrifice which is further elaborated in the Srauta Sutra and Brahmana. Indra, Ashwins, Saraswati, and Agni were the first to perform this sacrifice, Veda states that they quaffed Sura-Soma mixture. And that’s how this sacrifice started, Sura-Soma mixture is offered to deities as well as to one&#8217;s ancestors and it is to be consumed by the Brahmin priests as well.</p>
<p><strong>Preparation of Sura (liquor) in the Sautramani sacrifice</strong></p>
<p>Baudhayana Srauta Sutra XXVI.22 &#8220;The Sura to be prepared for the Sautramani contains the grains as one fourth part or one fifth part, sprouting grass and young blades: The sprouting grass is of barley and young blades are of paddy. Beans are intended for fermentation. Now this filtering basket is wooden or of split bamboo or earthen; it has however a leather spread over it. This (sacrificer) is one who has pressed Soma and who has also filtered wine. The pressing leads him to the yonder world; the filtering of wine grants him welfare here.&#8221; Tr. C.G. Kashikar</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana, Kanda 12, Adhayaya 8, Brahmana 2, verses 8-11 &#8220;The malted rice, indeed, is of the form of the morning-pressing, for the morning-pressing is this (terrestrial) world, and the latter relates to the Asvins, and Âsvina milk he pours (into the Surâ-liquor) the first night: he thus provides him (the Sacrificer 1) with the morning-pressing&#8211;with its own world, with its own deity, with its own form. And the malted barley is of the form of the midday-pressing, for the midday-pressing is the air, and the latter relates to Sarasvatî and the Sârasvata milk he pours (into the Surâ) the second night: he thus provides him with the midday-pressing&#8211;with its own world, with its own deity, with its own form. And the fried rice is of the form of the evening-pressing, for the evening-pressing is the sky, and the latter relates to Indra, and Aindra milk he pours (into the Surâ) the third night: he thus provides him with the evening-pressing&#8211;with its own world, with its own deity, with its own form. The milk of one (cow) he pours (into the Surâ) the first night, the milk of two the second night, and the milk of three the third night: he thus provides him with the pressings, in accordance with their forms, and in accordance with their deities.&#8221; Tr. Julius Eggeling</p>

<p><strong>Details on the offering of Sautramani Sacrifice</strong></p>
<p>I will be mentioning some verses from Yajur Veda chapter 19 and I will also add elaborations of those verses from Satapatha Brahmana, Baudhayana Srauta Sutra and Sankhayana Srauta Sutra. I will underline those sentences of Brahmana and Srauta Sutra which are taken from the Vedas.</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 19.1 &#8220;Sweet with the sweet, I sprinkle thee with Soma, strong with the strong, the nectar with the nectar, the honey-sweet with what is sweet as honey, Soma art thou. Get dressed for the Asvins. Get dressed for Sarasvati. Get dressed for Indra and the Good Deliverer.&#8221; Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith<br />

<p>Above Hindi translation is by Swami Karpatri Maharaj. This verse elaborated in Satapatha Brahmana as,</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana, Kanda 12, Adhyaya 7, Brahmana 3, Verses 5-6 “With (Vâg. S. XIX, 1), <span style="text-decoration: underline;">&#8216;Thee, the sweet (liquor I mix) with the sweet (Soma)</span>,&#8217; <span style="color: #ff0000;">he compounds (the ingredients for the preparation of) the Surâ-liquor, and makes it </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">palatable</span>;&#8211;&#8216;the strong with the strong,&#8217; he thereby bestows energy on him (the Sacrificer);&#8211;&#8216;the immortal with the immortal,&#8217; he thereby bestows life on him &#8216;the honeyed with the honeyed,&#8217; he thereby bestows flavour to it (the liquor);&#8211;&#8216;I mix with the Soma,&#8217; he thereby makes it (the Surâ-liquor) a form of Soma. &#8216;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Thou art Soma: get thee matured for the Asvins! get thee matured for Sarasvatî! get thee matured for Indra Sutrâman!</span>&#8216; for these were the deities who first prepared that sacrifice, and with their help he now prepares it; and, moreover, he thereby provides these deities with their share. He distils it with a view to (its being like) the Soma-pressing. For three nights it remains standing, for the Soma remains standing for three nights after it has been bought: he thus makes it a form of Soma.” Tr. Julius Eggeling</p>
<p>Mahidhara a commentator on Veda writes on Yajur Veda 19.1 about the preparation of the Sura,</p>
<p>“Having purchased (a) malted rice (sashpa), malted barley (tokma), and fried rice (lâgâh), and (b) various vegetable substances (called with the generic name of nagnahu) serving as spices and ferments, such as the bark of Vatica robusta, three myrobalans (nutmeg, areca-nut, and cloves), ginger, hog-weed, &amp;c., he takes them into the fire-house, and pounds the two lots separately. He then prepares two gruels or mashes of rice and millet respectively, adding more water than is ordinarily used, puts them on the fire till they boil over, and catches the overflowing water in two separate vessels. He then acids thereto one-third part of the (still separate) pounded malted rice and barley and fried rice (or one-sixth part into each vessel), and likewise one-half of the spice (or one-fourth part into each vessel): this mixture, called mâsara (serving both as malt and as flavouring matter), is allowed to dry and is then pounded. One-half of the remaining pounded malted rice and barley and fried rice, as well as the whole of the remaining spices, is then, in equal parts, added to the two mashes, which are thereupon poured into a large vessel, after which the pounded &#8216;mâsara&#8217; is mixed with the compound whilst the above formula is pronounced; and the pot is deposited in a hole dug in the south-western corner of the fire-shed (sâlâ), where it remains standing for three days (and nights), during which the milk of one, two, and three cows respectively, and the remaining quantities of malted and fried grain are gradually added to it.” Tr. Julius Eggeling</p>
<p>Asking the Soma to get dressed is probably talking about fermentation as stated in the Baudhaya Srauta Sutra which is an elaboration of Yajur Veda 19.1,</p>
<p>Baudhayana Srauta Sutra XVII.32 &#8220;&#8230;He piles the cooked rice around the wooden filter. Having covered it, he touches it with the formula, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">&#8216;Thou art Soma; do thou be fermented for the Asvins, fermented for Sarasvati, fermented for Sutraman Indra</span>.&#8217; The Sura mixed up together is retained for three consecutive (nights). &#8216;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Soma, after having been purchased, stays on for three nights</span>.&#8217; So says the Brahmana. When it dawns after three nights, an animal-sacrifice of three or four animals is performed. The alter prescribed for the Sautramani is measured for the sacrificer on the preceeding day. Having strewn it around, he carries the Stambayajus.&#8221; Tr. Chintaman Ganesh Kashikar</p>
<p>The Black Yajur Veda 6.1.6.5 gives mythical reason behind keeping Soma for three days/nights which shall be discussed later in this article.</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 19.4-5 &#8220;By means of this eternal sieve may Sûrya&#8217;s Daughter purify The Soma that flows forth from thee. Soma with Wine, pressed; filtered for the banquet, cleanses priest, noble, brilliancy and vigour.&#8221; Tr. Ralph. T.H. Griffith</p>

<p>Satapatha Brahmana elaborates these verses as,</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana, Kanda 12, Adhyaya 7, Brahmana 3, Verse 12 “With (Vag. S.

With (Vâg. S. XIX, 5), <span style="text-decoration: underline;">&#8216;The Brahman and Kshatra he purifieth</span>,&#8217; he purifies the milk: he thus produces the Kshatra from out of the Brahman, for from out of the priesthood the nobility is produced;&#8211;&#8216;the fiery spirit and energy;&#8217; fiery spirit and energy, vital power, he thus bestows on him;&#8211;&#8216;with the Surâ the Soma,&#8217; for with the Surâ-liquor is Soma;&#8211;&#8216;the juice, is distilled,&#8217; for from the distilled the juice is obtained;&#8211;&#8216;for joy,&#8217; to joy (intoxication), indeed, the Soma juice contributes, and to joy also does the Surâ-liquor: he thus secures both the joy of the Soma, and the joy of the Surâ;&#8211;&#8216;with the pure juice, O god, satiate the deities!&#8217; that is, &#8216;with the pure juice satisfy thou the deities;&#8217;&#8211;&#8216;with sap bestow thou food on the Sacrificer,&#8217; sap and food he thereby bestows on the Sacrificer. The cups of milk are taken first, then the cups of Surâ-liquor: he thereby makes the peasantry obedient to the nobility.” Tr. Julius Eggeling</p>
<p>Baudhayana Saruta Sutra elaborates it as,</p>
<p>Baudhayana Srauta Sutra XVII.34 &#8221; While the Adhvaryu is engaged in his duties, the Pratiprashatr filers the wine by means of the woollen filter with its fringe towards the north, with the verse, &#8216;May the daughter of Surya filter O Indra for thee the mixture of wine regarded as Soma with the evernew woollen filter.&#8217; If the sacrificer is purged of Soma (he shall filter it) with the verse, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">&#8216;The swift wine, cleansed by the filter, the associate friend of Indra has passed downwards</span>&#8230;&#8221; Tr. C.G. Kashikar</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 19.7 “For each of you is made a God-appointed place: so grant to me a portion in the highest sphere. Surâ the strong art thou. This here is Soma. Entering thine own place do me no mischief.” Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>

<p>This is elaborated in the Satapatha Brahman,</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana, Kanda 12, Adhyaya 7, Brahmana 3, Verse 14-15 “With (Vâg. S. XIX, 7), &#8216;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Separately, indeed, a seat, acceptable to the gods, hath been prepared for you two</span>,&#8217; he fills the (three) cups of Surâ-liquor; for separate, indeed, are the Soma-juice and the Surâ-liquor; and &#8216;acceptable to the gods&#8217; he says, because these two are indeed acceptable to the gods; and &#8216;separately a seat hath been prepared&#8217; he says, because there are two altar-grounds;&#8211;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">&#8216;do not ye mingle in the highest heaven</span>!&#8217; he thereby keeps him (the Sacrificer) from evil;&#8211;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">&#8216;the potent Surâ-liquor thou art</span>,&#8217; he thereby makes Surâ to be Surâ;&#8211;&#8216;and this is Soma,&#8217; he thereby makes Soma to be Soma;&#8211;&#8216;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">entering thine own seat, injure me not</span>!&#8217; he thereby turns it (the Surâ-liquor) away to its own seat for his own safety. With a single (verse) he fills them: singly and solely on the Sacrificer he thus bestows fame, for the Surâ-liquor is fame. Verily, the cups of milk are the nobility (chieftaincy), and the cups of Surâ-liquor are the peasantry (clan): thus, were he to draw (the cups) without interlinking them, he would detach the peasantry from the nobility, and the nobility from the peasantry, and would cause confusion between the higher and lower, and a failure of the sacrifice. He draws them so as to be interlinked and thereby combines the peasantry with the nobility, and the nobility with the peasantry, for the prevention of confusion between the higher and lower, and for the success of the sacrifice.&#8221; Tr. Julius Eggeling</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana 12:7:3:8 “There are both milk and Surâ-liquor; for milk is Soma, and the Surâ-liquor food: through the milk he secures the Soma-drink, and through the Surâ-liquor food. And milk is the nobility (chieftaincy), and Surâ-liquor the peasantry (clan); the milk he purifies after purifying the Surâ-liquor: he thus produces the nobility from out of the peasantry, for the nobility is produced from out of the peasantry.” Tr. Julius Eggeling</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Yajur Veda 19.7 is also elaborated in Aitareya Brahmana which explains the Rajasuya sacrifice. In the consecration ceremony (Rajasuya?) of king mentioned in Aitareya Brahmana, the king is required to drink Sura (liquor) along with Soma which is given by the Brahmin priest,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Aitareya Brahmana, Book 8, Chapter 2, Para 8 “…The spirituous liquor represents the Kshattra, and further, the juice in the food; thus both the Kshattra and the juice in the food, are placed in him…Now he gives into his hand a goblet of spirituous liquor, under the recital of the verse, svadishthaya madishthaya, (9.1.1) i.e. ‘Purify, O Soma! with thy sweetest most exhilarating drops (the sacrificer), thou who art squeezed for Indra, to be drunk by him.’ After having put the spirituous liquor into his hand, the priest repeats a propitiatory mantra (which runs thus): <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">‘To either of you (spirituous liquor and Soma!) a separate residence has been prepared, and allotted by the gods. Do not mix with one another in the highest heaven; liquor! thou art powerful; Soma! thou art a king. Do not harm him (the king)! may either go to his own place</span><span style="color: #444444;">.’ </span>(Here is said), that the drinking of the<span style="color: #444444;"> </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Soma and that of liquor, exclude one another (they are not to be mixed). After having drunk it</span><span style="color: #444444;">…</span>Thus he finally places the liquor in his friend (gives him a share in it).” Tr. Martin Haug</span></p>
<p>Chapter 20 of Aitareya Brahmana deals with the pouring of various liquids over the king’s head by the priest and also deals with the drinking of liquor. By means of Mantra the liquor was transformed into real Soma which is then drunk by the king,</p>
<p>Aitareya Brahmana, Book 8, chapter 4, Para 20 “…Then the priest gives into his hands a goblet filled with spirituous liquor, repeating the mantra, svadishthaya. He then should drink the remainder (after previous libations to the gods)…<span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Soma beverage which is (in a mystical way) contained in the spirituous liquor, is thus drunk by the king</span>, who is inaugurated by means of Indra’s inauguration ceremony (the ceremony just described)…The drinking of spirituous liquor, or Soma, or the enjoyment of some other exquisite food, affects the body of the Kshattriya who is inaugurated by means of Indra’s great inauguration ceremony…” Tr. Martin Haug</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 19.7 is also elaborated in Baudhayana Srauta Sutra,</p>
<p>Baudhayana Srauta Sutra XVII.36 “(He recites) the verse) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">&#8216;Do you offer heartfelt sweet praise to Agni the drinker of wine, receiving Soma on the surface, the creator of all and whom horses, oxen, bulls, barren cows, sheeps released (by the sacrificer) are offered</span>,&#8217; and makes the offering at the second Vasat-uttering. He pours down the remnants of the cup for the Asvins into that for Sarasvati; the remnants of the cup for Sarasvati into that for Indra. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">A brahmana consumes it with the two verses</span>: &#8216;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">(O Sura and Soma) god has erected separate resorts for you; do not be mixed up in the high above. Thou art powerful Sura; this is Soma. Entering into thy own abode, do not injure me</span>. Whatever has remained here out of the juicy pressed drink, which Indra rank for his powers&#8230;He fills in the cups with the sediment of the Sura; he fixes the feath of the eagle into the cup of Butea frondosa&#8230;.He takes the sura with the excessive substance and pours it inot the sieve of a hundred pores with the formula, &#8216;O Pitrs with Soma as the first, be gratified.&#8217; When the liquid passes through the sieve, all offer prayers with eight verses&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Chintaman Ganesh Kashikar</p>
<p>Above passage from Baudhayana is also an elaboration of following Yajur Veda verses,</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 20.76-78 &#8220;Ye Asvins and Sarasvati, joint drinkers of the Sura draught, In Namuchi of Asura birth, gave aid to Indra in his deeds. As parents aid a son, both Asvins aided thee, Indra, with their wondrous powers and wisdom. When thou with might hadst drunk the draught that gladdens, Sarasvati, O Bounteous Lord, refereshed thee. He in whom horses, bulls, oxen, and barren cows, and rams, when duly set apart, are offered up, To Agni, Soma-sprinkled, drinker of sweet juice, Disposer, with thy heart bring forth a pleasant hymn.&#8221; Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>Griffith has translated the word “Sura” as “Draught” and “Sweet juice” here. Part of the above passage where Ashwins are said to have helped Indra to kill Namuchi is also mentioned in Baudhayana Srauta Sutra XVII.35 and Yajur Veda 20.59 which I have quoted in this article and let me again quote a few sentences of Baudhayana for your ease,</p>
<p>Baudhayana Srauta Sutra XVII.35 “…Getting up taking the two cups, the Adhvaryu says &#8216;Do you recite the puronuvakya for the Sura-soma taken for the Asvins, Sarasvati and Sutraman Indra. &#8216;The Maitravruna recites as the puronuvakya the verse, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">&#8216;O Asvins the guardians of the auspicious, do you two partaking of the Sura-soma in association with the demon Namuci help Indra in his deeds</span>.&#8217; Having crossed the alter and having caused to announce, he says (to the Maitravaruna), &#8216;Do you impel (the Hotr to recite the yajya for the Sura-soma set forth for the Asvins, Sarasvati and Sutraman Indra.&#8217; The Maitravaruna pronounces the call, &#8216;Let the Hotr recite the yajya for the Asvins, Sarasvati and Sutraman Indra. These Sura-soma (o gods) set forth for you-powerful, exhilerating, prepared out of the mixture&#8230;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">May the Avins, Sarasvati and Sutraman Indra the Vrtra-killed enjoy them; may they drink the sweet wine</span>, become exhilarated and enjoy. O Hotr, do you recite the yajya. The Hotr recites the yajya, &#8216;O Asvins, do you favour us with your deed like the parents their son. O Indra, when thou didst consume the Sura-soma in order to achieve good deeds and to possess powers, Satasvati healed thee&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Chintaman Ganesh Kashikar</p>
<p>Sankhayana elaborates it as,</p>
<p>Sankhayana Srauta Sutra XV.15.1-14 &#8220;Now the sautramani. (The victims at this occasion are) a red he goat for the Asvins, a ewe for Sarasvati, a bull for Indra the protecting (sutraman) After encircling with the firebrand has been performed on these, they proceed with the surasoma. Over the flowing (sura) they mutter&#8230;Or the verses addressed to the Fathers. The inviting (verse for the libation of the sura is) &#8216;Ye both, O Asvins, the cheering)&#8217; The formula of prompting is Let the hotr worship the Asvins, Sarasvati, Indra the protecting&#8230;The mantra to accompany the partaking of the sura is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">&#8216;The (Soma), which the Asvins took from the asura Namuci which Sarasvati pressed out to obtain</span> strength, this king Soma the bright, sweet drop, I here partake of.&#8217; If he starts from the moaning that <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">a brahmana must be engaged for a reward to drink the (remainings of the) sura</span>, the beverage (the rest of the sura) is poured out for him.&#8221; Tr. W. Caland</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 19.32 &#8220;The rite with sacred grass, wine, store of heroes, the mighty ones speed on with adorations. May we, sweet-singing sacrificers, setting Soma mid Gods in heaven, give joy to Indra.&#8221; Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith<br />

<p>Satapatha Brahmana elaborates on this verse as,</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana, Kanda 12, Adhayaya 8, Brahmana 1, verse 2 &#8220;He (the Adhvaryu) offers (of the three cups of milk) with (Vâg. S. XIX, 32), &#8216;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">By their devotions the buffalos quicken the sacrifice</span>,&#8217;&#8211;the buffalos, doubtless, are the officiating priests, and devotion is sacrifice: through the priests he causes the sacrifice to prosper, and through the sacrifice the sacrificer;&#8211;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">&#8216;the barhis-seated one, supplied with Surâ and goodly heroes</span>,&#8217; supplied with Surâ, indeed, is this barhis-seated sacrifice, to wit, the Sautrâmanî: by means of the barhis (the sacred grass on the Vedi), and the sacrifice, he causes him to prosper;&#8211;&#8216;they who bestow Soma,&#8217;&#8211;they thus bestow the Soma-drink upon him;&#8211;&#8216;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">with the deities in heaven</span>,&#8217;&#8211;they thus place him with the deities in heaven;&#8211;&#8216;may we enjoy ourselves,&#8217;&#8211;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">the Soma-juice, indeed, conduces to joy, and so does the Surâ-liquor</span>: both the joy of Soma and the joy of Surâ he thus secures;&#8211;&#8216;worshipping Indra with good hymns of praise!&#8217;&#8211;for the hymn of praise is food for the gods, and the sacrifice also is food: by sacrifice, by food, he thus makes him successful. Having sacrificed, they drink (of the milk), and thereby increase what is prosperous with him.&#8221; Tr. Julius Eggeling</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 19.33 “All essence of thine own in plants collected, all strength of Soma when poured out with Surâ—Therewith impel with joy the sacrifice, Sarasvatî, the Asvins, Indra, Agni.” Tr. Ralph T.H Griffith<br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="508" height="108" class="wp-image-8888 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Picture-10-508w108h.jpeg" alt="yv 19.33 Swami Karpatri" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Picture-10-508w108h.jpeg 508w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Picture-10-508w108h-300x64.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 508px) 100vw, 508px" /></p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana elaborates it as,</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana, Kanda 12, Adhayaya 8, Brahmana 1, Verse 12 &#8220;He (the Pratiprasthâtri) offers (libations from the cups of Surâ-liquor), with (Vâg. S. XIX, 33), <span style="text-decoration: underline;">&#8216;What essence there is of thine, gathered from the plants</span>,&#8217; for this Surâ-liquor, indeed, is the essence of both the waters and the plants: by the essence of both the waters and the plants he thus causes him to prosper;&#8211;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">&#8216;the strength of the Soma-juice together with the Surâ-liquor</span>,&#8217;&#8211;he thereby secures what strength there is in the Soma-juice and in the Surâ-liquor;&#8211;&#8216;by that exhilarating drink quicken thou the Sacrificer,&#8217;&#8211;that is, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">&#8216;by that exhilarating drink gladden thou the Sacrificer;&#8217;&#8211;&#8216;Sarasvatî, the Asvins, Indra, and Agni</span>,&#8217;&#8211;by deities he (the priest) thus causes the sacrifice to prosper, and by deities and sacrifice the Sacrificer. Having made the offering, they drink (the liquor), and thereby cause to prosper what is unprosperous with him.&#8221; Tr. Julius Eggeling</p>
<p>Veda also mentions offering liquor to departed manes. The sacrificer is not supposed to drink liquor as it is meant only for offering in this case,</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 19.36 &#8220;To Fathers who claim Svadha be Svadha and homage! To Grandfathers who claim Svadha be Svadha and homage! To Great-grandfathers who claim Svadha be Svadha and homage! The Fathers have eaten. The Fathers have rejoiced. The Fathers have been satisfied. Fathers, be ye purified.&#8221; Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>It is elaborated in the Satapatha Brahmana,</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana, Kanda 12, Adhayaya 8, Brahmana 1, verses 6-8 “…this Soma-drink falls to the share of the fathers and grandfathers of whoever drinks (the liquor) on this occasion. Having shifted three coals of the southern fire to outside the enclosing-stones 1, he may there offer (of the liquor) with these (three) utterances (Vâg. S. XIX, 36):&#8211; &#8216;To the Svadhâ-loving Fathers be Svadhâ, adoration!&#8217; he thereby places the Fathers with the Svadhâ in the world of the Fathers.&#8211;&#8216;To the Svadhâ-loving grandfathers he Svadhâ, adoration!&#8217; he thereby places the grandfathers with the Svadhâ in the world of the grandfathers.&#8211;&#8216;To the Svadhâ-loving great-grandfathers be Svadhâ, adoration!&#8217; he thereby places the great-grandfathers with the Svadhâ in the world of the great-grandfathers. Having fetched water, he pours it (into the cups) with, &#8216;The Fathers have drunk:&#8217; he thereby bestows food on them;&#8211;&#8216;the Fathers have enjoyed themselves:&#8217; he thereby causes them to enjoy themselves;&#8211;&#8216;the Fathers have become satisfied:&#8217; he thereby satisfies them;&#8211;&#8216;may the Fathers cleanse themselves!&#8217; he thereby purifies all of them from the first downwards, for the Sautrâmanî is a means of purification.&#8221; Tr. Julius Eggeling</p>
<p>The following verse is about offering various animals to Vedic deities, it is also about offering liquor and asking them to drink it,</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 21.29-31 &#8220;Let the Hotar sacrifice with fuel to Agni in the place of libation, to the Asvins, Indra, Sarasvatî. A grey-coloured he-goat with wheat, jujube-fruit and sprouts of rice becomes a sweet salutary remedy, splendour, might, milk, Soma. Let them enjoy sweet butter with foaming liquor. Hotar, present offerings of butter. Let the Hotar, Tanunapat, worship Sarasvati. A sheep, a ram, a salutary remedy on the honey-sweet path, bearing to the Asvins and Indra heroic strength, with jujebe-fruit, Indra-grains, sprouts of rice, becomes a salutary remedy, milk, Soma. Let them enjoy Sweet butter with foaming liquor. Hotar, present offerings of butter&#8230;Let the Hotar, magnified with oblations, offering sacrifice, worship Sarasvati and Indra, increasing them with strength, with a bull and a cow. Strength and medicine to the Asvins and Indra are meath with jujube-fruit, Masara with parched grain, milk, Soma. Let them enjoy sweet butter with foaming liquor&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>It is elaborated in Sankhayana as,</p>
<p>Sankhayana Srauta Sutra XIV.13.1-9 &#8220;At this rite two animals a grey he goat to the Asvins a ewe to Sarasvati, are immolated in addition to the savana victim. To Indra Sutraman a barren cow of the same kind is immolated in addition to the usual one. The reason why these victims are thus tied (and slaughtered) is the wish not to depart from the sautramani. After the Savana cakes of the morning (service) they put the fuel to the fire outside and go on with the (i.e. pour out the libation of) surasoma&#8230;Now, in that for Indra Sutraman a barren cow is immolated in addition to the usual one, (the reason thereof is) along with Indra Sutraman the sautramani is completed.&#8221; Tr. W. Caland</p>
<p>Baudhayana Srauta Sutra elaborates these verses as,</p>
<p>Baudhayana Srauta Sutra XVII.35 &#8220;He carried those (cups) towards the east or north along the rear of the handles of the ladles. He takes the wine together with excessive substance and moves towards the southern fire&#8230;he formally dedicates the animals a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">gray coloured (goat) to the Asvins, a male sheep to Sarasvati and a bull to Indra</span>. He dedicates a goat to Brhaspati as the fourth animal if the sacrificer has purged Soma. After having offered their omenta as prescribed, the Adhvaryu takes up the cups for the Asvins and Sarasvati; the Pratiprasthatr takes the one for Indra. Getting up taking the two cups, the Adhvaryu says &#8216;Do you recite the puronuvakya for the Sura-soma taken for the Asvins, Sarasvati and Sutraman Indra. &#8216;The Maitravruna recites as the puronuvakya the verse, &#8216;O Asvins the guardians of the auspicious, do you two partaking of the Sura-soma in association with the demon Namuci help Indra in his deeds.&#8217; Having crossed the alter and having caused to announce, he says (to the Maitravaruna), &#8216;Do you impel (the Hotr to recite the yajya for the Sura-soma set forth for the Asvins, Sarasvati and Sutraman Indra.&#8217; The Maitravaruna pronounces the call, &#8216;Let the Hotr recite the yajya for the Asvins, Sarasvati and Sutraman Indra. These Sura-soma (o gods) set forth for you-powerful, exhilerating, prepared out of the mixture&#8230;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">May the Avins, Sarasvati and Sutraman Indra the Vrtra-killer enjoy them; may they drink the sweet wine</span>, become exhilarated and enjoy. O Hotr, do you recite the yajya. The Hotr recites the yajya, &#8216;O Asvins, do you favour us with your deed like the parents their son. O Indra, when thou didst consume the Sura-soma in order to achieve good deeds and to possess powers, Sarasvati healed thee&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Chintaman Ganesh Kashikar</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana, Kanda 12, Adhayaya 8, Brahmana 2, verse 15 &#8220;All (the praishas) contain (the word) &#8216;payas&#8217; (milk), for in the form of milk Soma is (here) pressed; they all contain (the word) &#8216;Soma,&#8217; for the sake of (conformity with) the Soma-pressing; they all contain (the word) &#8216;parisrut&#8217; (spirituous liquor), for in the form of spirituous liquor Soma is (here) pressed; they all contain (the word) &#8216;ghrita&#8217; (ghee), for this&#8211;to wit, ghee&#8211;doubtless is manifestly a form of the sacrifice: he thus makes it to be manifestly a form of the sacrifice; they all contain (the word) &#8216;madhu&#8217; (honey), for this&#8211;to wit, honey&#8211;is manifestly a form of Soma: he thus makes it to be manifestly a form of Soma.&#8221; Tr. Julius Eggeling</p>
<p>Yajur Veda verse mentions the word Parisrut which is a semi-fermented liquor according to the translator Julius Eggeling while Griffith translates it as foaming liquor. Both the sacrificer and priests have to drink Parisrut liquor offered to gods,</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana, Kanda 12, Adhayaya 8, Brahmana 2, verse 21 &#8220;This Sautrâmanî, then, is manifestly a Soma-sacrifice; and were the Sacrificer alone to drink (the liquor), it would be either an ishti-offering, or an animal sacrifice; but, for the sake of conformity of the liquor) to the Soma, all the priests drink thereof, for all the priests drink of the Soma-juice.&#8221; Tr. Julius Eggeling</p>
<p>Following Yajur Veda verses states that Agni, Sarasvati and Indra had drunk the Sura-Soma mixture,</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 21.59-60 “To-day this Sacrificer cooking viands, cooking sacrificial rice-cakes, binding a goat for the Asvins, a ram for Sarasvatî, a hull for Indra, pressing Surâ and Soma juices for the Asvins, Sarasvatî, and Indra the Good Deliverer, has chosen Agni as Hotar. To-day the divine Vanaspatî has done good service to the Asvins with a goat, to Sarasvatî with a ram, to Indra with a bull. They have eaten these from the marrow onwards, they have accepted the cooked viands, they have waxed strong with the rice-cakes. The Agnis, Sarasvatî, and Indra have drunk the Surâ and Soma draughts.” Tr. Ralph. T.H. Griffith</p>

<h2>Parisrut</h2>
<p>Julius Eggeling writes in the footnotes of Satapatha Brahmana, &#8220;According to Sayana, the difference between sura and parisrut would seem to be that the former beverage is prepared from mature shoots (of rice, &amp;c.), and the latter from such as are not quite ripe.&#8221; It is stated that Parisrut is neither Soma nor Sura. Parisrut seems to have been a semi-fermented liquor. Also see Yajur Veda 21.29 which is mentioned in the category Sautramani sacrifice and is further elaborated in Brahmana and Srauta Sutra. Satapatha Brahmana, Kanda 12, Adhayaya 8, Brahmana 2, verse 15 also mentions drinking Soma and Parisrut in Sautramani ritual.</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 20.59-65 The Asvins brought from Namuchi pressed Soma bright with <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">foaming juice</span>. Sarasvatî with sacred grass brought that to Indra for his drink. The Asvins, and the Three, apart, Sarasvatî, Idâ, Bhâratî, As drink to gladden Indra, poured strong Soma with the foaming juice. Praising with <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">foaming liquor</span> at due times, Indra, Vanaspatî, Sarasvatî as cow gave forth sweet beverage with the Asvins Twain.&#8221; Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>Read Baudhayana Srauta Sutra XVII.35 and Sankhayana Srauta Sutra XV.15.1-14 mentioned above which elaborates Yajur Veda 20.59-65. Griffith has translated the word Parisrut as foaming juice as well as foaming liquor.</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 19.95 &#8220;Splendour of victims, powerful oblation, honey and meath with milk and foaming liquor, Healing Sarasvatî effused, and Asvins; from pressed and unpressed Soma, deathless Indu.&#8221; Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 2.34 &#8220;Bearers of vigour and immortal fatness, milk and sweet beverage and foaming liquor, ye are a freshening draught. Delight my Fathers.&#8221; Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>Julius Eggeling in his translation of Satapatha Brahmana mentions Katyayana Samhita in the footnotes which elaborates the above Yajur Veda verse as,</p>
<p>Kâtyâyana Samhita IV, I, 15 “Having made (them) wash themselves as before, and having loosened (visramsya) the tuck, he makes obeisance with &#8216;adoration to your vigour, O fathers!&#8217; &amp;c. (Vâg. S. II, 32 a-f)&#8230; He pours [the water, left in the pitcher, on the cakes] with &#8216;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ye (O waters) are a refreshing draught, ye, that bring sap, immortal ghee and milk and foaming mead: gladden my fathers!&#8217; (Vâg. S. II, 34.)</span> 20, [The Adhvaryu] having laid (the cakes on the dish) the sacrificer smells at them. 21, The firebrand and the once-cut stalks of grass (he throws) into the fire. 22, The wife, if desirous of a son, eats the middle cake with, &#8216;Bestow offspring on me, O fathers, a boy crowned with lotuses; that there may he a man here!&#8217; (Vâg. S. II, 33.)…” Tr. Julius Eggeling</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 19.79 &#8220;Seeing the foaming liquor&#8217;s sap, Prajapati with the bright drank out the bright, the milk, the Soma juice, the Soma juice, BY Law, etc.&#8221; Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 3.12.7 &#8220;Hither to this (house) hath come the tender child, hither the calf along with (the other) domestic animals; hither the vessel (full) of liquor, together with bowls of sour milk!&#8221; Tr. Maurice Bloomfield</p>
<p>Griffith has translated the word Parisrut as foaming drink in this verse and in the footnotes, he provides an explanation,</p>
<p>&#8220;Foaming drink: parisutas; a beverage prepared from herbs, a sort of beer.&#8221;</p>

<h1>Hindu Scriptures on Liquor Drinking</h1>
<p>Narada Purana not only allows one to drink liquor after offering it to gods but it also gives details on the preparation of three types of liquors,</p>
<p>Narada Purana III.90.11-22 &#8220;This Vidya is exhilarating as the intoxicating liquor. It is the means of crossing over distress. I shall now tell you the precise preparation of it. The liquor they classify into three types: Gaudi, Paisti and Madhvi. Put jaggery in hot water and stir it well. The pollen powder of the flower dhataki (grislea tomentosa) shall be put into it and the whole solution is kept in a glass jar. It is stored under ground but at dawn and at dusk the solution is stirred well with the hands. After a month is over when the sediments go to the bottom, it is filtered. This can be used for worship. This is called Gaudi because it is prepared from Guda. Similarly, that which is got by adding honey is called Madhvi. O dear one, listen to the Paisti variety. Rice should be boiled slowly and cooked in two and a half times more water (than the rice). It should be left over for three days. Then the powdered sprout of the embylic Myrobalan is put into it. Keep this in an airy place for a day where there is not much of wind. Water is then poured into it and stirred well. This is then filtered. It is then called Paistika Madhu. Artificial liquor is prepared in two ways extracting from trees or squeezing from fruits. Listen to the mode of its preparation. By its taste the mind gets repose. Bunches of grapes, or date fruits or the flowers of Bassia latifolia are put into water and boiled to half the original quantity. To this add a small quantity of distilled spirit and keep it undisturbed for two days. After filtering the same it becomes tasty and auspicious, worthy of being offered for worship. I causes full repose of the mind. As to the second variety it is prepared from the coconut, Hintala or palm trees. The milk that exudes from the stalk of the fruit must be taken fresh from the tree. It is tasty. Take the water out of the coconut fruit. Put a little camphor therein. The juice of Arecanut half the quantity of the former. Mix both and keep it in the sunlight. This immediately becomes liquor which the gods are very fond of.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Another verse from Narada Purana permits one to drink a certain amount of liquor after offering it to deities,</p>
<p>Narada Purana III.90.23-28 &#8220;Or the devotee shall offer for the arghya to the goddess the liquor which has been mentioned here. It must be offered immediately which will be fruitful. The aspirant while remaining in trance should drink it always restricting his diet. Never should a siddha drink it unless it has been first offered to the goddess. It should be drunk until the mind is wholly absorbed in the Goddess. If he drinks more than that he shall become a sinner immediately. He who drinks wine with wilful desire without serving it to the god becomes a sinner. He should be punished by the king for he is the worshipper of avidya &#8230;The devotee with the previously-mentioned form should worship the deities of the above-mentioned forms. He should worship them in the proper sequence with the offering if wine, fish and meat duly consecrated.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Baudhayana Dharma Shastra permits the drinking of Rum only for South Indian Hindus,</p>
<p>Baudhayana Dharma Shastra, Prasna 1, Adhyaya 1, Kandika 1, verses 1-4 “There is a dispute regarding five (practices) both in the south and in the north…Now (the customs peculiar) to the north are, to deal in wool, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">to drink rum</span>, to sell animals that have teeth in the upper and in the lower jaws, to follow the trade of arms, to go to sea. He who follows (these practices) in any other country than where they prevail, commits sin.”</p>
<p>Indra questions Brihaspati about Asava (a type of liquor) and Brihaspati explains to him in detail and also about which type of liquor is permissible for Kshatriya, Vaishya after offering it to deities,</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana, Lalita-Mahatmya 7.63-76 &#8220;Indra said: &#8216;What is the nature of Asava? (Liquor). What is its defect? What is its merit? What type of cooked food is defective? Mention this in detail to me.&#8217; Brihaspati said: The different types of intoxicating beverages are as follows: Paiffika (made from flour or rice), Talaja (from the date palm), Kaira (cocounut palm-juice), Madhuka (made from honey or Madhuka flowers), Gudasambhava (prepared from molasses). In regard to sinful nature the later ones mentioned above are half as dreadful as the earlier ones. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Asava can be used as a beverage by the three castes beginning with the Ksatriyas</span>. Excepting a Brahmana lady, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">all women can drink liquors beginning with the third one i.e. Kaira (coconut palm juice, and prepared from honey and molasses)</span>. A widow, a virgin and a woman in her monthly period shall avoid drinking liquor. If a woman drinks liquor out of covetousness and not in the company of her husband, she is called Unmadini (a mad woman). One should avoid her like a Candala woman. The ratio of drinking liquors in the case of four castes beginning with the Brahmanas shall be ten to eight or six to four. In the case of women it shall be half of the above. If they drink in the company of their husbands it shall be one-fourth of the above. After drinking liquor out of delusion, a Brahmana should perform Krcchracandrayana expiation. Or he shall repeat Gayatri Mantra or Jatavedasa Mantra ten thousand times. If a man repeats Ambikahrdaya Mantra he shall become pure. A Ksatriya among the three castes shall be purified by repeating those Mantras half the number of times. In the case of women the number of repetitions shall be one-fourth or they can get the same done through Brahmanas. One should repeat the Mantras a thousand times under water and become purified thereby. Laksmi, Sarasvati, Gauri, Candika, Tripura, Ambika, Vaisnavi, Bhairavi, Kali and Mahendri are the mothers. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">There are other Sakti goddesses. In worshipping them the liquor prepared from honey is approved of</span>. A Brahmana who has mastered the Vedangas shall perform worship without wine &#8230;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The base fellow who drinks liquor without worshipping Para Sakti </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">shall stay in hell called Raurava for a period calculated at the rate of a year for every d</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">r</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">op so consumed</span>.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Brahmins were not always barred from quaffing wine, in the Vedic period Kshatriyas and even Brahmins enjoyed wine especially after mixing it with Soma,</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 19.5 <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Soma with Wine, pressed</span>; filtered for the banquet, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">cleanses priest, noble</span>, brilliancy and vigour. God, with the Bright give Deities enjoyment: give food with flavour to the Sacrificer.</p>
<p>Following is the Sanskrit text with Hindi translation by Swami Karpatri Maharaj,</p>

<p>In the consecration ceremony (Rajasuya?) of the king mentioned in Aitareya Brahmana, the king is required to drink Sura (liquor) along with Soma which is given by the Brahmin priest,</p>
<p>Aitareya Brahmana, Book 8 , Chapter 2, Para 8 &#8220;&#8230;The spirituous liquor represents the Kshattra, and further, the juice in the food; thus both the Kshattra and the juice in the food, are placed in him&#8230;Now he gives into his hand a goblet of spirituous liquor, under the recital of the verse, svadishthaya madishthaya, (9.1.1) i.e. &#8216;Purify, O Soma! with thy sweetest most exhilarating drops (the sacrificer), thou who art squeezed for Indra, to be drunk by him.&#8217; After having put the spirituous liquor into his hand, the priest repeats a propitiatory mantra (which runs thus): <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">&#8216;To either of you (spirituous liquor and Soma!) a separate residence has been prepared, and allotted by the gods. Do not mix with one another in the highest heaven; liquor! thou art powerful; Soma! thou art a king. Do not harm him (the king)! may either go to his own place</span>.&#8217; (Here is said), that the drinking of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Soma and that of liquor, exclude one another (they are not to be mixed). After having drunk it</span>&#8230;Thus he finally places the liquor in his friend (gives him a share in it).” Tr. Martin Haug</p>
<p>Underlined sentences of the above passage are an elaboration of the following Yajur Veda verse,</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 19.7 For each of you is made a God-appointed place: so grant to me a portion in the highest sphere. Surâ the strong art thou. This here is Soma. Entering thine own place do me no mischief.</p>
<p>Following is the Sanskrit text along with the Hindi translation of Swami Karpatri Maharaj</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1239" height="345" class="wp-image-8892 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Picture-7-1.jpeg" alt="C:\Users\Hassan Razvi\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\INetCache\Content.Word\yv 19.7.jpg" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Picture-7-1.jpeg 1239w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Picture-7-1-300x84.jpeg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Picture-7-1-768x214.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1239px) 100vw, 1239px" /></p>
<p>Now, those who cry “fake translation” has no way to escape, Aitareya Brahmana attests Yajur Veda verse. Chapter 20 of Aitareya Brahmana deals with the pouring of various liquids over the king&#8217;s head by the priest and also deals with drinking liquor. By means of Mantra the liquor was transformed into real Soma which is then drunk by the king,</p>
<p>Aitareya Brahmana, Book 8, chapter 4, Para 20 &#8220;&#8230;Then the priest gives into his hands a goblet filled with spirituous liquor, repeating the mantra, svadishthaya. He then should drink the remainder (after previous libations to the gods)&#8230;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Soma beverage which is (in a mystical way) contained in the spirituous liquor, is thus drunk by the king</span>, who is inaugurated by means of Indra&#8217;s inauguration ceremony (the ceremony just described)&#8230;The drinking of spirituous liquor, or Soma, or the enjoyment of some other exquisite food, affects the body of the Kshattriya who is inaugurated by means of Indra&#8217;s great inauguration ceremony&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Martin Haug</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti prohibits all forms of wine for a Brahmin but permits certain types of liquor for Kshatriya and Vaishya,</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti 22.82-84 Distilled from sugar, or from the blossoms of the Madhûka. (Mâdhvi wine], or from flour: these three kinds of spirituous liquor have to be discerned; as one, so are all: none of them must be tasted by the twice-born. Again, distilled from the blossoms of the Madhûka tree (Madhûka wine), from molasses, from the fruits of the Tanka (or Kapittha tree), of the jujube tree, of the Khargûra tree, or of the breadfruit tree, from wine-grapes, from Madhûka blossoms (Mâdhvîka wine), Maireya, and the sap of the cocoanut tree: <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">These ten intoxicating drinks are unclean for a Brâhmana; but a Kshatriya and a Vaisya commit no wrong in touching (or drinking) them</span>.</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 5.56 There is no sin in eating meat, in (drinking) spirituous liquor, and in <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">carnal intercourse, for that is the natural way of created beings</span>, but abstention brings great rewards</p>
<p>Acharya Medhatithi writes on this verse that drinking wine is permissible for Kshatriyas. Arthashastra of Kautilya (Chanakya) allows the sale, purchase and drinking of liquor, it brings liquor manufacturers and shops under state regulation, an entire chapter is dedicated to it,</p>
<p>Kautilya’s Arthashastra, Book 2, chapter 25 “BY employing such men as are acquainted with the manufacture of liquor and ferments (kinva), the Superintendent of Liquor shall carry on liquor-traffic not only in forts and country parts, but also in camps. In accordance with the requirements of demand and supply (krayavikrayavasena) he may either centralize or decentralize the sale of liquor. A fine of 600 panas shall be imposed on all offenders other than those who are manufacturers, purchasers, or sellers in liquor-traffic. Liquor shall not be taken out of villages, nor shall liquor shops be close to each other. Lest workmen spoil the work in hand, and Aryas violate their decency and virtuous character, and lest firebrands commit indiscreet acts, liquor shall be sold to persons of well known character in such small quantities as one-fourth or half-a-kudumba, one kudumba, half-a-prastha, or one prastha. Those who are well known and of pure character may take liquor out of shop. Or all may be compelled to drink liquor within the shops and not allowed to stir out at once in view of detecting articles such as sealed deposits, unsealed deposits, commodities given for repair, stolen articles, and the like which the customer&#8217;s may have acquired by foul means. When they are found to possess gold and other articles not their own, the superintendent shall contrive to cause them to be arrested outside the shop. Likewise those who are too extravagant or spend beyond their income shall be arrested. No fresh liquor other than bad liquor shall be sold below its price. Bad liquor may be sold elsewhere or given to slaves or workmen in lieu of wages; or it may form the drink of beasts for draught or the subsistence of hogs. Liquor shops shall contain many rooms provided with beds and seats kept apart. The drinking room shall contain scents, garlands of flowers, water, and other comfortable things suitable to the varying seasons. Spies stationed in the shops shall ascertain whether the expenditure incurred by customers in the shop is ordinary or extraordinary and also whether there are any strangers. They shall also ascertain the value of the dress, ornaments, and gold of the customers lying there under intoxication. When customers under intoxication lose any of their things, the merchants of the shop shall not only make good the loss, but also pay an equivalent fine. Merchants seated in half-closed rooms shall observe the appearance of local and foreign customers who, in real or false guise of Aryas lie down in intoxication along with their beautiful mistresses. Of various kinds of liquor such as medaka, prasanna, ásava, arista, maireya, and madhu:&#8211; Medaka is manufactured with one drona of water, half, an ádaka of rice, and three prastha of kinva (ferment). Twelve ádhakas of flour (pishta), five prasthas of kinva (ferment), with the addition of spices (játisambhára) together with the bark and fruits of putraká (a species of tree) constitute prasanná. One-hundred palas of kapittha (Feronia Elephantum) 500 palas of phánita (sugar), and one prastha of honey (madhu) form ásava. With an increase of one-quarter of the above ingredients, a superior kind of ásava is manufactured; and when the same ingredients are lessened to the extent of one-quarter each, it becomes of an inferior quality. The preparation of various kinds of arishta for various diseases are to be learnt from physicians. A sour gruel or decoction of the bark of meshasringi (a kind of poison) mixed with jaggery (guda) and with the powder of long pepper and black pepper or with the powder of triphala (1 Terminalia Chebula, 2 Terminalia Bellerica, and 3 Phyllanthus Emblica) forms Maireya. To all kinds of liquor mixed with jaggery, the powder of triphala is always added. The juice of grapes is termed madhu. Its own native place (svadesa) is the commentary on such of its various forms as kápisáyana and hárahúraka. One drona of either boiled or unboiled paste of másha (Phraseolus Radiatus), three parts more of rice, and one karsha of morata (Alangium Hexapetalum) and the like form kinva (ferment). In the manufacture of medaka and prasanna, five karshas of the powder of (each of páthá (Clypea Hermandifolio), lodhra (Symplocos Racemosa), tejovati (Piper Chaba), eláváluka (Solanum Melongena) honey, the juice of grapes (madhurasa), priyangu (panic seeds), dáruharidra (a species of turmeric) black pepper and long pepper are added as sambhára, requisite spices. The decoction of madhúka (Bassia Latifolia) mixed with granulated sugar (katasarkará), when added to prasanna, gives it a pleasing colour. The requisite quantity of spices to be added to ásava is one karshá of the powder of each of chocha (bark of cinnamon), chitraka (Plumbago Zeylanica), vilanga, and gajapippalí (Scindapsus Officinalis), and two karshas of the powder of each of kramuka (betel nut), madhúka (Bassia Latifolia), mustá (Cyprus Rotundus), and lodhra (Symlocos Racemosa). The addition of one-tenth of the above ingredients (i.e., chocha, kramuka, etc.), is (termed) bíjabandha. The same ingredients as are added to prasanná are also added to white liquor (svetasurá). The liquor that is manufactured from mango fruits (sahakárasurá) may contain a greater proportion of mango essence (rasottara), or of spices (bíjottara). It is called mahásura when it contains sambhára (spices as described above). When a handful (antarnakho mushtih, i.e., so much as can be held in the hand, the fingers being so bent that the nails cannot be seen) of the powder of granulated sugar dissolved in the decoction of moratá (Alangium Hexapetalum), palása (Butea Frondosa), dattúra (Dattura Fastuosa), karanja (Robinia Mitis), meshasringa (a kind of poison) and the bark of milky trees (kshiravriksha) mixed with one-half of the paste formed by combining the powders of lodhra (Symplocos Racemosa), chitraka (Plumbago Zeylanica), vilanga, páthá (clypea Hermandifolia), mustá (cyprus Rotundus), kaláya (leguminous seeds), dáruharidra (Amonum Xanthorrhizon), indívara (blue lotus), satapushpa (Anethum Sowa), apámárga (Achyranthes Aspera) saptaparna (Echites Scholaris), and nimba (Nimba Melia) is added to (even) a kumbha of liquor payable by the king, it renders it very pleasant. Five palas of phánita (sugar) are added to the above in order to increase its flavour. On special occasions (krityeshu), people (kutumbinah, i.e., families) shall be allowed to manufacture white liquor (svetasura), arishta for use in diseases, and other kinds of liquor. On the occasions of festivals, fairs (samája), and pilgrimage, right of manufacture of liquor for four days (chaturahassaurikah) shall be allowed. The Superintendent shall collect the daily fines (daivasikamatyayam, i.e., license fees) from those who on these occasions are permitted to manufacture liquor. Women and children shall collect ‘sura,’ and ‘kinva,’ ‘ferment.’ Those who deal with liquor other than that of the king shall pay five percent as toll. With regard to sura, medaka, arishta, wine, phalámla (acid drinks prepared from fruits), and ámlasídhu (spirit distilled from molasses):&#8211; Having ascertained the day&#8217;s sale of the above kinds of liquor, the difference of royal and public measures (mánavyáji), and the excessive amount of sale proceeds realised thereby, the Superintendent shall fix the amount of compensation (vaidharana) due to the king (from local or foreign merchants for entailing loss on the king&#8217;s liquor traffic) and shall always adopt the best course.” Tr. R. Shamasastry</p>

<p>Satapatha Brahmana 12:7:3:88. There are both milk and Surâ-liquor; for milk is Soma, and the Surâ-liquor food: through the milk he secures the Soma-drink, and through the Surâ-liquor food. And milk is the nobility (chieftaincy), and Surâ-liquor the peasantry (clan); the milk he purifies after purifying the Surâ-liquor: he thus produces the nobility from out of the peasantry, for the nobility is produced from out of the peasantry.</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana also mentions Parishrut (spelt Parisrut) a type of liquor different from Sura,</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana 12:9:1:11. Verily, from this sacrifice the man is born and whatever food a man consumes in this world, that (food), in return, consumes him in yonder world. Now this sacrifice is performed by means of spirituous liquor, and spirituous liquor (parisrut is not to be consumed by a Brâhmana: he thus is born from that which is not (to be) consumed, and the food does not, in return, consume him in yonder world. Therefore this (sacrifice), the Sautrâmanî, is a Brâhmana&#8217;s sacrifice.</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana 5:1:2:14 …and the Parisrut-liquor is neither Soma nor Sura: this is why he buys the Parisrut for a piece of lead from a long haired man.</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana 5.5.4.19 &#8220;&#8230;Let him therefore rather throw them into the fermented liquor (Parisrut)&#8230;let him therefore throw it rather into the spirituous liquor.</p>

<h1>Soma</h1>
<p>Soma plant finds frequent mention in the Vedas. It was of great importance in the Vedic religion. Soma plant is said to have stems and leaves and used to grow in the mountains, Soma plant as a whole, as well as Soma Ras (juice), are also called Andhas. Soma the mythical plant is extinct. Let’s not discuss its botanical features since this article deals with only intoxication in Hinduism. Soma drink was prepared from the leaves of Soma plant by pressing them between stones. It was mixed with water, milk, curd and a few other edible things probably to lessen its intoxicating effect. As per Nirukta 11.2 the word Soma is derived from the root &#8220;Su&#8221; which means &#8220;To Press.&#8221; As per Nirukta 1.11 the word Sura (liquor prepared from grains) is also derived from the root &#8220;Su&#8221; which means &#8220;To press.&#8221; Both the words Sura and Soma are derived from the same root. Before we begin let’s have a look at what prominent Hindu scholars said about Soma,</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">VIEWS OF SCHOLARS</span></strong></p>
<p>Swami Vikvekananda the founder of Ramakrishna Mission wrote,</p>
<p>“And they had a popular plant called Soma. What plant it was nobody knows now; it has entirely disappeared, but from the books we gather that, when crushed, it produced a sort of milky juice, and that was fermented; and it can also be gathered that this <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">fermented Soma juice was intoxicating</span>. This also they offered to Indra and the other gods, and they also drank it themselves. Sometimes they drank a little too much, and so did the gods. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Indra on occasions got drunk</span>. There are passages to show that Indra at one time drank so much of this Soma juice that he talked irrelevant words.” <strong>The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda/Volume 1/Lectures And Discourses/Vedic Religious Ideals</strong><br />

<p>Sri Aurobindo the founder of Sir Aurobindo Ashram wrote,</p>
<p>&#8220;Soma is the Lord of the wine of delight, the wine of immortality. Like Agni he is found in the plants, the growths of earth, and in the waters. The Soma-wine used in the external sacrifice is the symbol of this wine of delight. It is pressed out by the pressing-stone (adri, gravan) which has a close symbolic connection with the thunderbolt, the formed electric force of Indra also called adri&#8230;&#8221; <strong>The Secret of the Veda, p.354, by Sri Aurobindo, Published by SriAurobindoAshram Publication Dept, 2003</strong></p>
<p>Swami Prabhupada the founder of ISKCON is of the same view that Soma was an intoxicating drink, however, he is also of the view that SomRas was not an ordinary intoxicating liquor, it was a special intoxicating liquor made for the gods. He wrote,</p>
<p>“…The demigods are accustomed to drinking the soma-rasa beverage, and therefore the drinking of wine and intoxication are not unknown to them…” <strong>Swami Prabhupada on Srimad Bhagavatam 1.15.34</strong><br />

<p>Dr. B.R Ambedkar the first Law Minister of India wrote,</p>
<p>“Drinking was another evil which was rampant among the Aryans. Liquors were of two sorts Soma and Sura. Soma was a sacrificial wine. The drinking of the Soma was in the beginning permitted only to Brahmins, Kshatriyas and Vaishyas. Subsequently it was permitted only to Brahmins and Kshatriyas. The Vaishyas were excluded from it and the Shudras were never permitted to taste it. Its manufacture was a secret known only to the Brahmins. Sura was open to all and was drunk by all. The Brahmins also drank Sura. Shukracharya the priest to the Asuras drank so heavily that in his drunken state he gave the life giving Mantra known to him only and with which he used to revive the Asuras killed by the Devas—to Katch the son of Brahaspati who was the priest of the Devas. The Mahabharat mentions an occasion when both Krishna and Arjuna were dead drunk. That shows that the best among the Aryan Society were not only not free from the drink habit but that they drank heavily. The most shameful part of it was that even the Aryan women were addicted to drink. For instance Sudeshna the wife of King Virat tells her maid Sairandhri to go to Kichaka’s palace and bring Sura as she was dying to have a drink. It is not to be supposed that only queens indulged in drinking. The habit of drinking was common among women of all classes and even Brahmin women were not free from it. That liquor and dancing was indulged in by the Aryan women is clear from the Kausitaki Grihya Sutra I. 11-12, which says; “Four or eight women who are not widowed, after having been regaled with wine and food are to dance for four times on the night previous to the wedding ceremony.” men, not to speak of women of the lower Varnas, as late as the seventh and eighth centuries- A.D. in the Central region of Aryavarta, is clear from Kumarila Bhatta’s Tantra- Vartika I (iii). 4, which states, “Among the people of modern days we find the Brahmin women of the countries of Ahicchatra and Mathura to be addicted to drinking”. Kumarila condemned the practice in the case of Brahmins only, but not of Kshatriyas and Vaishyas men and women, if the liquor was distilled from fruits or flowers (Madhavi), and Molasses (Gaudi) and not from grains (Sura).” <strong>Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Writings and Speeches, Vol 3, page 154-5 </strong><a href="https://mea.gov.in/images/attach/amb/volume_03.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">https://mea.gov.in/images/attach/amb/volume_03.pdf<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SOMA RAS</span></strong></p>
<p>As you may know, Aryan’s Vedic religion shares many similarities with the Zoroastrians. One of them is Soma plant. Soma in Zoroastrianism is known as Haoma. In the Zoroastrian text Yasna, Haoma (Soma) is considered a mildly intoxicant drink with no harm.</p>
<p>Yasna 10.8 “All other toxicants go hand in hand with Rapine of the bloody spear, but H(a)oma&#8217;s stirring power goes hand in hand with friendship. [Light is the drunkenness of H(a)oma (Pâzand).] Who as a tender son caresses H(a)oma, forth to the bodies of such persons H(a)oma comes to heal.” Tr. L.H. Mills</p>
<p>In the Puranas and Mahabharat, there’s a story of King of Gaya performing a sacrifice in which Indra drank Soma Ras so much that he became intoxicated, I am mentioning all those verses here,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 5.15.12 “In Mahārāja Gaya’s sacrifices, there was a great supply of the intoxicant known as soma. King Indra used to come and become intoxicated by drinking large quantities of soma-rasa. Also, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Viṣṇu [the yajña-puruṣa] also came and personally accepted all the sacrifices offered unto Him with pure and firm devotion in the sacrificial arena.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 4.1.14-18 &#8220;There was never beheld on earth a sacrifice equal to the sacrifice of Marutta: all the implements and utensils were made of gold. Indra was intoxicated with the libations of Soma juice, and the Brahmans were enraptured with the magnificent donations they received.&#8221; Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Mahabharata 12.29.35 “While the king of Anga performed his sacrifice by the hill called Vishnupada, Indra became intoxicated with the Soma he drank, and the Brahmanas with the presents they received.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Mahabharata 1.121.9 &#8220;&#8230;while he was performing a sacrifice the gods with Indra and the great Rishis came to him, and Indra was so intoxicated with the Soma juice he drank and the Brahmanas with the large presents they received&#8230;&#8221; Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Mahabharata 3.88.6-7 &#8220;&#8230;We have heard respecting the sacrificing king Nriga that which really took place while he was performing a sacrifice in the excellent tirtha called Varaha on the Payoshni. In that sacrifice Indra became intoxicated with quaffing the Soma, and the Brahmanas, with the gifts they received&#8230;&#8221; Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Markandeya Purana 129.15-16 &#8220;Equal to Marutta never lived a sacrificer on the face of the earth at whose sacrifice his dwelling house was cast and also golden palaces as largesse, Indra was made intoxicated with Soma and twice-born brahmanas with gifts&#8230;&#8221; Tr. F. Eden Pargiter</p>
<p>Following verses from Veda calls Soma as Mada (intoxicating), I am using Hindi translation by Pandit Ram Govind Trivedi,</p>

<p>Rig Veda 6.69.6-7 &#8220;Indra and Vishnu, feeders upon clarified butter, drinkers of the fermented Soma, thriving upon oblations, accepting them offered with reverence&#8230;Indra and Vishnu, agreeable of aspect, drink of this sweet Soma; fill with it your bellies: may the inebriating beverage reach you: hear my prayers, my invocation.&#8221; Tr.

<p>As you can see, words like Madira (मदिरा) and Mada (मद) have been used in these verses, Madira and Mada both denotes intoxication. Even those fluent in Hindi language can define these words. The word Mada (intoxication) is mentioned in connection with Soma stating that Soma is Mada (intoxicating) in numerous verses such as Rig Veda 1.85.10; 9.107.14; 1.104.9; 2.19.1; 9.12.3; 6.43.1-4; 2.14.1; 9.6.6; Rig Veda 1.84.4 which is also mentioned in Sankhayana Srauta Sutra 12.26.7; Rig Veda Mandala 2, Hymn 15 boasts deeds of Indra done in Intoxication (Mada) of Soma which is translated as rapture by Griffith; Rig Veda 8.14.7 which is elaborated in Aitareya Brahmana 6.7.</p>
<p>V.S Apte defines the word Mada as,</p>

[<strong>The Practical Sanskrit-English Dictionary, by Vaman Shivram Apte, page 836, Published by Shiralkar &amp; Co., 1890</strong>]
<p>Arya Samaji scholar Svami Satya Prakash Sarasvati in his translation of Rig Veda defines it as,</p>
<p>Madah, intoxication; pleasure.<br />
[<strong>Rgveda Samhita, Volume III, page 881, by Svami Satya Prakash Sarasvati &amp; Satyakam Vidyalankar, Published by Veda Pratishthana</strong>]
<p>Ralph T.H. Griffith has translated it as rapture, gladdening, wild joy, etc., and the reason he gave for this is as follows. Ralph T.H Griffith commenting on Rig Veda 1.51.2 quotes Max Mueller on the word Mada (pronounced Mad),</p>
<p>&#8220;Rushing in rapture: when exhilarated by draughts of Soma. &#8216;Here again,&#8217; says Professor Max Muller, ‘The difficulty of rending Vedic though in English, or any other modern language, becomes apparent, for we have no poetical word to express a high state of mental excitement produced by drinking the intoxicating juice of the Soma or other plants, which has not something opprobrious mixed up with it, while in ancient times that state of excitement was celebrated as a blessing of the gods, as not unworthy of the gods themselves, nay, as a state in which both the warrior and the poet would perform their highest achievements. The German Rausch is the nearest approach to the Sanskrit mada.’</p>
<p>In this version, mada has generally been rendered by rapture, delight, transport, or wild joy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Griffith has mentioned Soma as liquor in the following verses like</p>
<p>Rig Veda 2.14.1 “MINISTERS, bring the Soma juice for Indra, pour forth the gladdening liquor with the beakers. To drink of this the Hero longeth ever; offer it to the Bull, for this he willeth.” Tr. Ralph T.H Griffith</p>
<p>Rig Veda 3.48.1 “SOON as the young Bull sprang into existence he longed to taste the pressed-out Soma&#8217;s liquor. Drink thou thy fill, according to thy longing, first, of the goodly mixture blent with Soma.”</p>
<p>Rig Veda 4.34.5 “Out of what substance was that chalice fashioned which ye made fourfold by your art and wisdom? Now for the gladdening draught press out the liquor, and drink, O Ṛbhus, of die meath of Soma.”</p>
<p>Rig Veda 4.44.4 “Borne on your golden car, ye omnipresent! come to this sacrifice of ours, Nāsatyas.</p>
<p>Drink of the pleasant liquor of the Soma give riches to the people who adore you.”</p>
<p>Griffith translated Rig Veda 9.32.1 as,</p>
<p>पर सोमासो मदच्युतः शरवसे नो मघोनः |<br />
सुता विदथे अक्रमुः ||</p>
<p>pra somāso madacyutaḥ śravase no maghonaḥ |<br />
sutā vidathe akramuḥ ||</p>
<p>Rig Veda 9.32.1 &#8220;The rapture-shedding Soma-drops, effused in our assembly, have Flowed forth to glorify our prince.&#8221; Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>This is elaborated in Panchavimsha Brahmana as,</p>
<p>Pancavimsa Brahmana XI.5.1 &#8220;(The verse beginning:) &#8216;Forth (has) the intoxicating madacyut) Soma&#8217; is the gayatri; intoxicating (having mada) (and) rich in sap is the afternoon service; he, thereby, puts intoxication (and) sap (in it)&#8230;&#8221; Tr. W. Caland</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">FERMENTED SOMA</span></strong></p>
<p>As far as my knowledge is concerned, Soma by itself was mildly intoxicating and was made fully intoxicating through the fermentation process. Veda and Brahmana indicate that Soma was fermented and Swami Vivekananda also mentions that Soma was fermented and that fermented juice was intoxicating. Veda, Brahmana and Srauta Sutra state that Soma was mixed with barley [Rig Veda 9.68.4; Atharva Veda 20.24.7], it was kept for three days probably for the fermentation to complete.</p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.187.9 &#8220;What Soma, we enjoy from thee in milky food or barley-brew, Vātāpi, grow thou fat thereby.” Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>Rig Veda 9.17.3 &#8220;Soma, with swelling waves, exhilarating, inebriating, flows to the straining-cloth, destroying the Rakshasas, and devoted to the gods.&#8221; Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Following verses mentions about a day or 3 days old Soma,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.45.10 &#8220;Bring with joint invocations thou, O Agni, the celestial host: Here stands the Soma, bounteous gods: drink this expressed ere yesterday.&#8221; Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>Rig Veda 3.58.7 &#8220;O Asvins, very mighty ones, with Vayu and with his steeds, one-minded, ever-youthful, Nasatyas, joying in the third day&#8217;s Soma, drink it, not hostile, very bounteous givers.&#8221; Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>There’s one more verse from Yajur Veda which talks about the fermentation of Soma, I have mentioned this in the Sautramani sacrifice, you can read Yajur Veda 19.1, Baudhayana Srauta Sutra XVII.32 and Satapatha Brahmana, Kanda 12, Adhyaya 7, Brahmana 3, Verses 5-6 mentioned above. William Scott Shelley has explained fermentation of Soma in the following way,</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p>“In the preparation of the Soma beverage, the Soma stalks were boiled [Satapatha Brahmana XII.7.3.6], and remained standing for three nights [Baudhayana Srauta Sutra XVII.32]. The Taiitriya Samhita contains the mythological justification for keeping Soma for three nights: &#8220;When the Soma was being borne away, the Gandharva Vicvavasu stole it. It was for three nights stolen; therefore after purchase the Soma is kept for three nights [Taittriya Samhita VI.1.6.4]. Referring to Sura, an alcoholic beverage produced from fermented grain, the Satapatha Brahmana states: &#8220;He distils (i.e., boils) it with a view to )its being alike) the Soma-pressing. For three nights it remains standing, for the Soma remains standing for three nights after it has been brought [Satapatha Brahmana XII.7.3.6].&#8221; The Atharva Veda also makes reference to &#8220;him that takes pains, and cooks and presses the soma [Atharva Veda XI.1.30].&#8221; According to the Vedic literature, the Soma liquor was fermented. The directions in the Soma rite include the word Parisrut, &#8220;spirituous liquor [Satapatha Brahmana XII.8.2.15],&#8221; and this is also indicated in the Rgveda by the term Vatapi, &#8220;fermenting&#8221; of the Soma liquor [Rgveda I.187.10]: &#8220;What, Soma, we enjoy from thee in milky food or barley-brew, Vatapi, grow thou fat thereby [Rgveda I.187.10].&#8221;</p>
<p>Following the fermenting of the liquor, the Soma stalks were removed from the vessel and crushed between two stones on a cowhide [Rgveda IX.65.25, IX.79.4, X.94.9], or with a mortar and pestle [Rgveda I.28.1-6, IX.46.3]. The Rgveda tells of Soma libations &#8220;fifteenfold strong [Rgveda X.27.2], and with the addition of water [Rgveda IX.75.9, IX.107.2], which diluted the mixture and caused crushed Soma stalks to swell [Rgveda VIII.9.19, IX.64.8, IX.107.12], the Soma juice was poured over the stalks upon the cowhide, and filtered through a strainer made of cloth or wool [Rgveda VIII.2.2, IX.12.4, IX.13.1]. The Soma stalks were brown (babhru), ruddy (aruna), or tawny (hari) color [Rg Veda VIII.9.19], and Soma juice was also brown [Rgveda IX.33.2, IX.63.4, 6], ruddy [Rgveda IX.45.3], or tawny [Rgveda IX.3.9, IX.98.7]. This beverage is described in the Rgveda as &#8220;good to taste and full of sweetness, verily it is strong and rich in flavour.&#8221; Indicating that the fermenting of the liquor preceeded the pressing, Soma was often drunk unmmixed [Rgveda I.135.3, V.2.3, VII.90.2, IX.72.4], or it was mixed with milk [Rgveda I.23.1, VIII.2.3, VIII.90.10, IX.11.2, 5, IX.64.28, IX.72.1, IX.101.12, IX.107.2], butter [Rgveda X.29.6], curd [I.5.5, V.51.7, VII.32.4, IX.11.6, IX.101.12], or barley [Rgveda I.187.9, III.35.3, 7, III.52.1, IX.68.4].&#8221;<br />

<p>In folk tradition, Shiva is often associated with cannabis, Sadhus imitates him by smoking weed.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>by Sulaiman Razvi</p>
<p>Right wing groups in India keep mum about government’s subsidy to Hindu pilgrims but makes Hajj subsidy a controversial word. Right wing groups rants about subsidy given to Muslim pilgrims. Hajj subsidy is withdrawn by BJP government and I hope that it would do the same with subsidies to Hindu pilgrims and funding to Hindu festivals<br />
<span id="more-734"></span></p>
<p>Many Muslim leaders called for scrapping off Hajj subsidy and also said that it&#8217;s the airlines which are benefited from Hajj Subsidy, refer the article <a href="https://www.outlookindia.com/website/story/is-haj-subsidy-a-sleight-of-hand-to-keep-air-india-afloat/297678" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Is Haj Subsidy A Sleight Of Hand To Keep Air India Afloat?<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>Subsidy for Hindu pilgrims is state-sponsored given by states like Chhattisgarh, Delhi, Gujarat, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh and Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu. Here are some links which give details about subsidies given to Hindu pilgrims for Amarnath Yatra, Kailash Mansarovar, Muktinath Yatra and spending thousands of crore rupees for organizing events like Kumbh Mela, Gita festival, Diwali, cleaning of holy rivers, ponds after Ganesh Chaturthi etc. My question to those fanatics is, you keep moaning about Hajj subsidy even when Muslims were against it but your lips are sealed about the government subsidizing Hindu pilgrimage and government funds allotted for Hindu festivals? Court ordered the elimination of Hajj subsidy, will court also orders elimination of subsidies for Hindu pilgrims and those thousands of crore rupees spent on Hindu festivals? Will right wing fanatics accept that?</p>

<h2><strong>Several states subsidies</strong></h2>
<p>Every few years, the question is raised of the Haj subsidy given by the government to Muslim pilgrims flying to Mecca on state-owned Air India – whether it should continue, whether it is financially viable, whether it compromises India’s secular credentials. The Haj is a journey Muslims are enjoined to make at least once in their lifetimes to the Saudi Arabian city of Mecca, which is considered sacred in Islam.</p>
<p>Now, just after Saudi Arabia increased its quota of the number of Indians who will be permitted to make the pilgrimage for the first time in three decades, the minority affairs ministry has formed a committee to reconsider the subsidy. The government said it was following up on the Supreme Court order of 2012, which dictated that the subsidy should be phased out in 10 years.</p>
<p>There have been questions about the way in which the subsidy is administered. It has been claimed that funds routed through the Haj Committee to various community leaders were distributed as political largesse. Some say that there have been various irregularities in the flow of cash. Others contend that the subsidy is no subsidy at all but merely a transfer of funds from one part of the state machinery to the other: people availing of the subsidy travel to Saudi Arabia on the national carrier, Air India. The pilgrims fly out from Mumbai and in 2016 were given a concession of Rs 45,000 for their airfare.</p>
<p>Over the last decade, the Haj subsidy it was seen as part of the United Progressive Alliance government’s policy of outreach to Muslims, thought there have been voices of criticism from within the community. This week, the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen president Asaduddin Owaisi said the money for the subsidy – believed to total Rs 450 crore at present – would be better spent on the education of Muslim girls.<br />
Not just the haj</p>
<p>While these objections to the Haj need to be considered, what has passed without scrutiny is the fact that India also spends money on a raft of pilgrimages, directly or indirectly.</p>
<p>Chief among these are the four Kumbh Melas, held in Haridwar, Allahabad, Nashik and Ujjain. Millions of people attend each fair. To ensure that they go off smoothly, Central funds are routed through state governments to pay for constructions on the mela grounds, facilities for pilgrims and security. In 2014, for instance, the Centre spent about Rs 1,150 crore and the Uttar Pradesh government Rs 11 crore on the Allahabad Kumbh. Of this, Opposition parties alleged that Rs 800 crore had been misused.</p>
<p>Last year, the Union culture ministry also set aside Rs 100 crore to be granted to the Madhya Pradesh for the Simhastha Mahakumbh, which is held in once in 12 years in Ujjain. The state government had already spent Rs 3,400 crore on the event.</p>
<p>Other pilgrimages attracting Central funds include the Kailash Manasarovar Yatra, which involves an arduous trek from North India into the mountains of Tibet. The yatra is organised by the government, which spends money on security and health facilities for the pilgrims.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, several states have explicit subsidies earmarked for various pilgrimages or religious events. Chhattisgarh, Delhi, Gujarat, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh and Uttarakhand provide money to residents going on the Manasarovar yatra to cover a part of the expenses, which amount to about Rs 1.5 lakh each. The Madhya Pradesh government subsidises a range of pilgrimages for senior citizens and their attendants under the Mukhyamantri Tirtha Darshan Yojana, including visits to Ayodhya, Mathura, the birthplace of Sant Kabir and St Thomas Church in Kerala.</p>
<p>In Jammu and Kashmir, the Amarnath Shrine Board was set up by an act passed by the state assembly in 2000. Headed by the governor, who is aided by senior civil servants from the national and state administrative services, the board is responsible for “developmental activities” on the shrine and its environs, the “payment of suitable emoluments to the salaried staff”, constructing accommodation for pilgrims and other allied activities.<br />

<h2>How state govts sponsor pilgrims to Haridwar, Ajmer or Jerusalem</h2>
<p>Madhya Pradesh: Early scheme<br />
In 2012, MP introduced the Mukhya Mantri Teertha Darshan Yojana&#8230;The first lot travelled to Rameshwaram that September. Meant for senior MP citizens who don’t pay income tax, the scheme targets 1 lakh persons every year. In the first nine months of current fiscal, 89,000 have been sent, chosen by lots from all 51 districts; one can travel only once. They are taken by train to sites such as Badrinath, Kedarnath, Jagannath Puri, Dwarka, Vaisnho Devi, Gaya, Haridwar, Shirdi Tirupati, Ajmer Sharif, Kashi, Sammed Shikar, Shravan Belagola and Velankanni Church. Much earlier, the BJP government started subsidising pilgrimages abroad for Rs 30,000 or 50% of the expenses, whichever is less. The sites covered are in Pakistan (Nankana Saheb, Hinglaj Mata Mandir), China (Mansarovar), Cambodia (Angkor Vat) and Sri Lanka (Sita Mandir, Ashok Vatika).</p>
<p>Delhi: Newest launch<br />
The Delhi cabinet approved this week the Mukhyamantri Tirth Yatra Yojana, a free scheme for 1,100 senior citizens from each assembly seat. The 77,000 pilgrims, selected by lots, can take an AC bus on any of a number of package routes to sites including Mathura, Vrindavan, Agra, Haridwar, Hrishikesh, Neelkanth, Ajmer, Pushkar, Wagah, Anandpur Sahib, Vaishno Devi and Jammu. An official said the beneficiaries must not be earning more than Rs 3 lakh per year or be a government employee. The scheme includes insurance of over Rs 2 lakh. Board and lodging, food and travel will be paid for.</p>
<p>Uttar Pradesh: Doubled subsidy<br />
UP gives subsidies for the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra and Sindhu Darshan Yatra. The first 100 applicants for the Sindhu Darshan subsidy have been getting Rs 10,000 since 2015, when the SP was in power.</p>
<p>Uttarakhand: Hindu, Muslim sites<br />
In 2014, the Congress government started the Mere Buzurg Mere Teerth scheme sponsoring senior state citizens’ pilgrimage to sites in the state including Gangotri and Badrinath and Reetha Meetha Sahib. Delhi’s Nizamuddin Dargah was initially part of it but later removed. In 2017, the BJP government changed the name to Pandit Deendayal Matra-Pitra Tirthatan Yojana and added new sites: Haridwar’s Piran Kaliyar dargah and several Hindu sites in the state.</p>
<p>Himachal: Coming soon<br />
In its vision document for the polls recently won, the BJP promised a subsidy scheme for elders on Char Dham Yatra. Manisha Nanda, additional chief secretary and principal secretary to the CM, said the vision document has been adopted as government policy and a decision will soon be taken. “We have to work out the modalities of the scheme,” she said. The vision document also promised free travel for senior citizens to religious sites in Dev Bhumi.</p>
<p>Haryana: 2 yatras, 100 pilgrims<br />
Schemes started by the current government provide subsidies to 50 elderly citizens (Rs 10,000 each) on Sindhu Darshan Yatra in Ladakh, and another 50 pilgrims (Rs 50,000 each) on Kailash Mansarovar Yatra. A government spokesperson said Rs 5 lakh and Rs 25 lakh for the respective pilgrimages have been allocated in the annual plan of 2016-17.</p>
<p>Rajasthan: Now air too<br />
In 2013, the Congress government introduced an all-expenses paid railway trip for senior-citizen pilgrims. The scheme, which benefited 41,390 pilgrims in 2013-14, 6,914 in 2014-15, and 8,710 in 2015-16, was renamed Deendayal Upadhyay Varisht Nagrik Teerth Yojana by the BJP government last year, with added air services added (for citizens over age 65). The current year’s scheme covers 13 sites including Tirupati, Rameswaram, Sammed Sikhar, Jagannath Temple and Vaishno Devi. Since 2013, 80,221 people have availed the scheme via train and 5,762 by air; the state hasspent Rs 125.50 crore.</p>
<p>Karnataka: Rs 5 crore a year<br />
The previous BJP government had introduced a Rs 30,000 subsidy for Manasa Sarovara pilgrimage. The state budget sets aside Rs 5 crore every year for these subsidies.</p>
<p>Odisha: For needy elders<br />
The government began the Baristha Nagarika Tirtha Yatra Yojana in 2016 and sanctioned Rs 5 crore for 2016-17. It provides for 100% concession for senior citizens below the poverty line, 50% for non-BPL pilgrims (except income-tax payees) of age 60-70 and 70% for those aged 70-75.</p>
<p>Assam: Free, plus allowance<br />
Assam’s Dharmajyoti scheme, introduced for senior citizens (in groups of 20) by the then Congress government in 2004-05, provides for a 50% travel subsidy (by bus) on pilgrimages to various sites.<br />
The current BJP government introduced the Punyadham Yatra scheme in 2017. It is for 3,000 pilgrims travelling in groups — men aged 60-75, women 55-70 — to Jagannath Temple, Vrindavan, Ajmer Sharif, Mathura and Vaishno Devi. The government sponsors free train (AC-3) and road transportation from Guwahati and three-day lodging, and provides allowance of Rs 150 per pilgrim plus Rs 500/day for guards (three in a group).</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Written by </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Sulaiman</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> Razvi</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">As you may know</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">,</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> Krishna was an avatar of Vishnu who took birth on earth in human form. So a human would have a limited life and would die someday. Krishna grew old and died too, But in an unnatural way. A hunter named </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Jara</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> shot </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">an </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">arrow </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">at</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> Krishna&#8217;s leg. And the story later may have been twisted to show that it was Krishna himself who wanted </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">it. Krishna was actually cursed. Krishna killed the hunter </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Jara</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> but gave him entrance to heaven. </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">As per </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Skanda</span> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Purana</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> II.ii.12.118 the hunter shot the arrow whi</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">ch pierced the heart of Krishna, but as per Vishnu </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Purana</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> the arrow was shot at Krishna’s leg, </span></p>
<p><span id="more-2700"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Vishnu </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Purana</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> 5.37.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">61-6</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">9</span> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">“</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Respecting the words of the Brahman, the imprecation of </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Durvásas</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">, the illustrious </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Krishńa</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> sat engaged in thought, resting his foot upon his knee. Then came there a hunter, named </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Jará</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">, whose arrow was tipped with a blade made of the piece of iron of the club, which had not been reduced to powder; and beholding from a distance the foot of </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Krishńa</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">, he mistook it for part of a deer, and shooting his arrow, lodged it in the sole. Approaching his mark, he saw the four-armed king, and, falling at his feet, repeatedly besought his forgiveness, exclaiming, &#8220;I have done this deed unwittingly, thinking I was aiming at a deer!

Go, hunter, through my favour, to heaven, the abode of the gods.&#8221; As soon as he had thus spoken, a celestial car appeared, and the hunter, ascending it, forthwith proceeded to heaven. Then the illustrious </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Krishńa</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">, having united himself with his own pure, spiritual, inexhaustible, inconceivable, unborn, </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">undecaying</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">, imperishable, and universal spirit, which is one with </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Vásudeva</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">, </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000; font-size: 12pt;">abandoned his mortal body and the condition of the threefold qualities</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">” Tr.

<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The following verse from </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Srimad</span> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Bhagavatam</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> states that though Krishna was capable of reversing the curse but he chose to accept his destiny, </span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">These verses state</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> that due to the curse Krishna was shot dead by the hunter and his wives were abducted by robbers. It would&#8217;ve been acceptable if Krishna took the curse on himself and freed his wives from the curse. His inabil</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">ity to remove the curse is presented</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> in these verses as Krishna respected the curse of th</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">e Brahmin and accepted it. A</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">s per Padma </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Purana</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> version, it was Krishna who cursed his wives after they were </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">enamored</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> of their stepson Samba,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Padma </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Purana</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> 1.23.74b-87a &#8220;The Lord said: O Brahman, born from the lotus, in the same city there will be sixteen thousand wives of Vasudeva. </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Krsna</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">, the universal soul, having eyes like those of a deer, the dignified scion of </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Yadu</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> family, who had put the garland of </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Malati</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> flowers on his head, and being adorned with his praiseworthy wives, will enjoy with them in a garden rich with flowers, and situated on the bank of a lake, in the spring season abounding in cuckoos and swarms of bees. Samba, </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Jambavatl&#8217;s</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> son, adorned with all (kinds of ornaments), going along with the path nearby, really of the form of Cupid, will be longingly seen by the ladies and passion will be aroused in the hearts of them who will be tormented by the arrows of Cupid. He, the lord of the world, the omniscient master, having perceived it with his eye of contemplation, will say to them: &#8220;The evil being will kidnap you, since you have thus entertained the passion of love (for Samba) in my presence.&#8221; Then the revered lord, the cause of beings, the holder of the bow made of horn, being propitiated (by the ladies) tormented with the curse, will say this: &#8220;(You will observe) the vow, beneficial in the future, which sage </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Dalbhya</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">, emancipator of the fishermen living in the north and of an unlimited (generosity of) mind will tell you.&#8221; Saying so and leaving them, the lord vanished. Then after a (long) time when the burden (on the earth as a result of the great </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Bharatawar</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">) will be lightened and when the fight with clubs (among the </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Yadavas</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">) will be over, when </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Kesava</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> will have come back to the heaven, when the entire </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Yadu</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">-family will be no more, when even </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Arjuna</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> will be defeated by the thieves, when </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Krsna&#8217;s</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> wives will be kidnapped and will be enjoyed by the fishermen for a hundred million years and when they will be (thus) tormented, a devout soul, </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Dalbhya</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> by name, with great penance (to his credit) will come there.”</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> Tr. N.A. Deshpande</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Padma </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Purana</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> 1.23.91-121 “O revered sir, all of us have been perforce enjoyed by the evil beings; we have slipped from (i.e. erred in) our duty. You are our refuge. O </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">brahmana</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">, you have been formerly instructed by the intelligent </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Kesava</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">. Why have we become prostitutes after having come in contact with the lord? O you, whose wealth is penance, explain to us the duties of the prostitutes.” I shall tell you what </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Dalbhya</span> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Caikitayana</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> said to them. </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Dalbhya</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> said: Formerly </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Narada</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> approached you, who were proud, while (you were) sporting in the water of the </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Manasa</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> lake. All of you were daughters of Agni and were the nymphs in olden days. Not saluting </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Narada</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> through haughtiness you asked the sage conversant with deep and abstract meditation: “Advise us as to how Narayana will be our husband.” From him, this boon and this curse came forth (i.e. </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Narada</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> gave this boon to and pronounced this </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">curse on the ladies) in ancient days: “By giving a couple of beds with articles of gold (to a </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">brahmana</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">) on the twelfth day of the bright fortnight of </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Caitra</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> and Vaisakha, Narayana will certainly be your husband (i.e. you will obtain Narayana as your husband); (and) since, you asked me (a question) without saluting me, due to your selfish addiction to your beauty and good fortune, you will be kidnapped by thieves and will become prostitutes.” Thus, due to the curse of </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Narada</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> and also that of </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Kesava</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">, all of you, deluded by passion, have become prostitutes. O you excellent ladies, listen, even now, to what I shall say. The lord of lords, the best speaker, formerly said to the hundreds and thousands of thousands of the wives of the demons, the </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Asuras</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> (the evil spirits—enemies of gods), the sons of </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Diti</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> and the goblins, when these (ladies) were married and enjoyed by force (by the gods), after hundreds of the </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Asuras</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> and demons were killed by the gods in the war between gods and </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Asuras</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> (that took place) in ancient days: “O you devout and beautiful ladies, now live as prostitutes in king’s residences and in temples of gods; you will obtain your livelihood from the king and the master; and all of you will have good fortune as per your capacity. He, who enters your house with the fee should be served by you with attitude of love void of deceit… At that time, he, having the five arrows as his soul (i.e. Cupid), will go (i.e. remain) near Hari. She should worship the lotus-eyed (god i.e. </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Visnu</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">), followed by eulogies of Cupid. She should worship the feet (of the image of the deity saying:) ‘My salutation to Kama’; (she should worship) the shanks (saying:) ‘My salutation to </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Vaimohakarin</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">’; (she should worship) the generative organ (of the image of the deity saying:) ‘My salutation to </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Kandarpanidhi</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">…Having thus worshipped </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Govinda</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">, the lord of the form of </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Ananga</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">, the lady having made an offering with sandal, flowers and incense, and then having invited a Brahmana knowing customary observances, who has mastered the Vedas and who is without any deformity, and then having honoured him with adoration of sandal, flowers etc. she should give the </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">brahmana</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> rice of the measure of a </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">prastha</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> along with a pot of ghee, (saying:) ‘May </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Madhava</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> be pleased’. She should bear in mind that the best Brahmana, who has eaten well according to his sweet will, is Kamadeva meant for Rati. The lady should do whatever the best Brahmana desires.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Padma </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Purana</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> 1.23.130b-142 “Then having </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">circumambulated</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> and allowed the best Brahmana to go, she should take all (the articles) like the bed, the seat, to the Brahmana’s house. Since then whosoever comes to her house for sexual enjoyment should be similarly honoured on a Sunday and should always be adored. Thus till the thirteenth month arrives, she should gratify a Brahmana and then send him to his house; with his permission (she may entertain) a handsome (person) till he arrives (to her residence). When she has a difficulty as a result of impurity due to child-birth or abortion or from the king or a difficulty due to divine or human (forces) or due to an eclipse, then she should offer herself according to her capacity, for fifty-eight times. This (vow) I have especially narrated to you, since this is the duty that should be always performed by the prostitutes in this world…”</span></p>

Written by Sulaiman Razvi<br />
This is not actually a brief summary on the life of Rama. As I didn&#8217;t put much effort in writing this article, as many verses were already available with me. Rama has become like a main god of Hinduism due to the much conflict of his birthplace. And the chant &#8216;Jai Shri Ram&#8217; has become the favourite chants of Hindu extremists who use it only during riots or during other violent attacks. First let&#8217;s take a look at why he was born on earth. As per some Hindu scriptures Vishnu was cursed to take incarnations and the abduction of Sita and Rama seeking help of monkeys was also a curse. In one version Bhrigu curses Vishnu that in his next incarnation he will be separated from his wife because Vishnu beheaded his wife,<br />
<span id="more-2697"></span><br />
Valmiki Ramayana, Uttara Kanda, chapter 51. &#8220;Learn, O king, what happened formerly during the conflict between the Devas and Asuras. The Daityas, whom the Suras threatened, took refuge with the consort of Bhrigu and she, having given them a haven, they dwelt there in safety. Seeing them thus succoured, the Chief of the gods, enraged with his sharp-edged discus severed the head of Bhrigu&#8217;s wife. Beholding the murder of his consort, Bhrigu, in his wrath, instantly cursed Vishnu, the destroyer of enemy hosts, saying:- <span style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;">&#8216;Since in thine insensate fury, thou has slain my spouse, who should never have died thus, thou shalt take birth in the world of men, O Janardana, and there thou shall live separated from thy consort for many years</span>.&#8221; Tr. Hari Prasad Shastri</p>
<p>In another version, Vrinda curses Vishnu after Vishnu rapes her.<br />
Shiva Purana, Rudra Samhita 2, Yudha Khanda 5, Ch 23.38-45 &#8220;On seeing her husband, Vrnda too was delighted. She forgot her sorrow. She considered everything a dream. Delighted in the heart and with all the dormant passions kindled up, she sported with him for many days in the middle of that forest. Once at the end of the sexual intercourse she realised that it was Visnu. Vrnda rebuked him angrily and spoke thus. Vrnda said:—Fie on this misdeed of Visnu in outraging the modesty of another man&#8217;s wife. I have now realised you as the wielder of illusion, appearing in the guise of an ascetic. Sanatkumara said:—O Vyasa, saying thus in great anger she showed her brilliant powers as a staunch chaste lady by cursing Visnu. &#8220;O base foe of the Daityas, defiler of other people&#8217;s virtue, O wicked one, take this curse from me, greater in force than all persons. <span style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;">The two persons whom you made to appear in front of me shall become Raksasas and abduct your wife</span>. You will be distressed on account of separation from your wife roaming about with Sesa &#8216;lord of snakes&#8217; who posed as your disciple here. <span style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;">You will seek the help of monkeys in the forest</span>.&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, Edited by Jagdish Lal Shastri</p>
<p>Every year Hindus celebrate Dassehra where effigy of Ravana is burnt. But have you ever wondered why Hindus burns the effigy of Ravana? Ravana was an ardent devotee of Shiva, there was no bigger lover of Shiva than Ravana. Ravana was a just king who treated his subjects well. Ravana is now associated with evils and depicted as villain because he fought Rama. But why so much hatred against Ravana? Because he abducted Sita? Then what about those Hindu gods who raped and abducted women? Why aren&#8217;t they considered villains? Is that because they are Vedic gods? You can read above verses once again. It says Vishnu raped Vrinda for which she cursed Vishnu that in his incarnation his wife will be abducted by a Demon, he will have to seek help of monkeys. So that means it was already destined to happen then why so much hue and cry over that? Because as per Hindu religion we reap what we sowed in our past lives, that&#8217;s part of Karma. Why don&#8217;t Hindus burn effigy of almost all Hindu gods for raping and abducting women? Vishnu raped Vrinda, Soma raped Tara, Brihaspati raped Mamata (his sister in law), Surya raped Kunti, Ashvinkumara raped and impregnated a Brahmin lady, Varuna raped Bhadra, Indra raped Ahalya and lusted after many women, and even Shiva attempted to rape Vishnu (Mohini) and also raped Agni by discharging semen in his mouth . Refer the article <a href="/index.php/2014/12/27/hinduism-lust/" data-wpel-link="internal">Hinduism and Lust</a> for sources. If Ravana is demonized for abducting Sita (but not raping her) then all these gods should also be considered on the same level, perhaps much above Ravana because they raped women.</p>
<h1>Birth of Sita</h1>
<p>Sita was born from the earth, later she was adopted by King Janaka,<br />
Valmiki Ramayana, Bala Kanda 1, Sarga 66, verses 13b-14a &#8220;Later, when I was ploughing the ritual field then raised by the plough [from the furrow is a baby girl&#8230; since she is] gained while consecrating the ritual-field, she is named as Seetha, and thus she is renowned.&#8221; Tr. Desiraju Hanumanta Rao</p>
<h1><strong>Birth of Rama</strong></h1>
<p>Ram&#8217;s father Dasharath had three wives and he had no children from any of his wives probably because he was either infertile or impotent. So he performed Ashvamedha Yajna the horse sacrifice which is for fertility and to gain power and in this sacrifice the queen has to place the penis of the dead horse in her vagina and has to recite some obscene verses,<br />
Valmiki Ramayan, Bala Kanda 1.14.33-35 ”With great delight coming on her Queen Kausalya reverently made circumambulations to the horse, and symbolically killed the horse with three knives. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Queen Kausalya desiring the results of ritual disconcertedly resided one night with that horse that flew away like a bird</span>. Thus, the officiating priests of the ritual, namely <em>hota,</em> adhwaryu and <em>udgaata</em> have received in their hand the Crowned Queen, the neglected wife, and a concubine of the king, next as a symbolic donation in the ritual by the performer, the king.” Tr. Shri Desiraju Hanumanth Rao<br />

<h1><strong>Age of Sita at the time of her marriage with Rama</strong></h1>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-7044" src="http://vedkabhed.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Sita-6-years-old-Daily-Bhaskar-289x300.jpg" alt="" width="289" height="300" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Sita-6-years-old-Daily-Bhaskar-289x300.jpg 289w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Sita-6-years-old-Daily-Bhaskar-987x1024.jpg 987w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Sita-6-years-old-Daily-Bhaskar-768x796.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Sita-6-years-old-Daily-Bhaskar.jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 289px) 100vw, 289px" /><br />
As per Valmiki Ramayana, Rama is said to have married Sita when she was 6 years old,<br />
Valmiki Ramayana, Aranya Kanda 3.47.3-5 &#8220;I am the daughter of noble-souled Janaka, the king of Mithila, by name I am Seetha, and the dear wife and queen of Rama, let safety betide you. On residing in the residence of Ikshvaku-s in Ayodhya for twelve years, I was in sumptuosity of all cherishes while relishing all humanly prosperities. In the thirteenth year the lordly king Dasharatha deliberated together with his imperial ministers to anoint Rama as Crown Prince of Ayodhya. When Raghava&#8217;s anointment was being organised my venerable mother-in-law known as Kaikeyi begged her husband Dasharatha for a boon. Restraining my veracious father-in-law by a good deed once done by her in his respect, Kaikeyi besought two boons from him, namely expatriation of my husband, and anointment of her son Bharata. &#8216;If Rama is anointed now, come what may I will not eat, sleep, or drink, and my life ends this way,&#8217; thus Kaikeyi was adamantine, and the king and my father-in-law entreated her who is nagging with meaningful riches, but she did not make good on that entreaty. My great-resplendent husband was of twenty-five years of age at that time, and to me eighteen years are reckoned up from my birth.&#8221; Tr. Sri Desiraju Hanumantha Rao<br />
If we do little maths here we understand that Sita was 18 years old when she went into exile with her husband and before the exile she had spent 12 years with her husband in the hosue of King Dashratha, so if we deduct the age of Sita at the time of exile and number years she spent in the house of King Dasharath i.e., 12 years old,<br />
18-12= 6 years old<br />
Sita after marrying at 6, lived in the palace of King Dashrath until she was 12. When she was sent to exile with her husband, she was 18 years old. The age difference between Rama and Sita was 7 years. Skanda Purana clearly states that Sita was married when she was only six years old,<br />
Skanda Purana III.ii.30.8-9 &#8220;The bow of Isvara that was kept in the abode of Janaka, was broken. In his fifteenth  year, O king, Rama married the six year old beautiful daughter of the king of Mithila, Sita who was not born of a womb. On getting Sita, Raghava became contented and happy.&#8221; Tr. Ganesh Vasudeo Tagare</p>
<h1><strong>Rama&#8217;s love for meat, liquor and watching dancing girls<br />
</strong></h1>
<p>Valmiki Ramayana, Ayodhya Kanda 2.20.29 &#8220;I shall live in a solitary forest like a sage for fourteen years, <span style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;">leaving off meat</span> and living with roots, fruits and honey.&#8221; Tr. Shri K.M. K. Murthy</p>
<p>But he relished meat even in the forest, and not just chicken or mutton but even pork.<br />
Valmiki Ramayana, Ayodhya Kanda 2.52.102 &#8220;Thereafter, the two brothers hunted the deer and wild boar, and other beasts and growing hungry, fed on roots and berries as ordained, resting at eventide beneath a tree.&#8221; Tr. Hari Prasad Shastri</p>
<p>Sita addressed Ravana (who was in the guise of an ascetic) in the following way,<br />
Valmiki Ramayana 3.47.22b-23 &#8220;Be comfortable for a moment, here it is possible for you to make a sojourn, and soon my husband will be coming on taking plentiful forest produce, and on killing stags, mongooses, wild boars he fetches meat, aplenty.&#8221; Tr. Desiraju Hanumanth Rao</p>

<p>Rama beheads a Shudra,</p>
<p>Ramayana of Valmiki, Uttara Kanda 7, Chapter 75-76 &#8221;On this that Prince born of Raghu approached the one who had given himself up to rigorous practices and said:- &#8221;Blessed art thou, O Ascetic, who art faithful to thy vows! <span style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;">From what caste art thou sprung</span>, O Thou who hast grown old in mortification and who art established in heroism. I am interested in this matter, I Rama, the son of Dasaratha. What purpose hast thou in view? Is it heaven or some other object? What boon dost thou seek by means of this hard penance? I wish to know what thou desirest in performing these austerities, O Ascetic. May prosperity attend thee! <span style="color: red;">Art thou a brahmin? Art thou an invincible Kshatriya? Art thou a Vaishya, one of the third caste or art thou a Shudra</span>? Answer me truthfully!&#8221;&#8230;Hearing the words of Rama of imperishable exploits, that ascetic, his head still hanging downwards, answered:- <span style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;">&#8221;O Rama, I was born of a Shudra alliance and I am performing this rigorous penance in order to acquire the status of a God in this body</span>. I am not telling a lie, O Rama, I wish to attain the Celestial Region. <span style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;">Know that I am a Shudra and my name is Shambuka</span>.&#8221; <span style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;">As he was yet speaking, Raghava, drawing his brilliant and stainless sword from its scabbard, cut off his head</span>. <span style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;">The Shudra being slain</span>, all the Gods and their leaders with Agni&#8217;s followers, cried out, &#8221;Well done! Well done!&#8221; overwhelming Rama with praise, and a rain of celestial flowers of divine fragrance fell on all sides, scattered by Vayu.&#8221; Tr. Hari Prasad Shastri</p>
<p>Ramayana of Valmiki, Uttara Kanda 7, Chapter 75-76 &#8220;O Kakutstha be happy! This very day that child has received new life and has been restored to his parents. The child was resuscited at the instant that the head of the Shudra fell.&#8221; Tr. Hari Prasad Shastri<br />
A Brahmin boy died in Ram&#8217;s kingdom so Rama went out to find the cause of this death signifying that there must be some unrighteous thing going on that lead to the death of this boy. So Rama found Shambuka who was hanging upside down from a tree performing vigorous penance. Ram asked his caste and reason for his penance and beheaded him. Some apologists say that Rama beheaded Shambuka because Shambuka was performing penance to acquire boon for an evil purpose. If Shambuka was slain for that then why wasn&#8217;t Ravana beheaded too? Is that because Ravana was a Brahmin and Shambuka was a Shuda? Shambuka in this passage clearly said that he is performing penance to acquire the status of God in body. He wasn&#8217;t performing it with some evil intention. If Rama already knew his intention then why did he first enquired and then beheaded him? Why didn&#8217;t he just go there and behead him? Rama asked Shambuka&#8217;s caste, Shambuka reiterated that he is a Shudra. Shudra caste is emphasised here which means that Rama beheaded him because a Shudra should not perform such penance.<br />
Rama ordered Lakshman to cut off the nose and ear of Shurpanakha who was expressing her love for Rama, but he cuts off her nose and ears of Ravana&#8217;s sister,<br />
Valmiki Ramayana, Aranya Kanda 3.18.20-21 &#8220;She is freakish, knavish and overtly ruttish, oh, tigerly man, it will be apt of you to deface this paunchy demoness&#8221; Thus Rama said to Lakshmana. Thus said to that mighty Lakshmana he infuriately drew sword and chopped off her ears and nose before the very eyes of Rama.&#8221; Tr. Desi Raju Hanumanth Rao<br />
Lakshamana mutilated another lady named Ayomukhi, read the article Violence in Hinduism for more information. This is what provoked Ravana to abduct Sita. If Krishna lusts after several women then it&#8217;s just love but if Shurpanakha expresses her love then she is lustful. I am not saying this but some scholars like Desi Raju Hanumanth Rao wrote this. Khara the younger brother of Ravana spoke thus,<br />
Valmiki Ramayana, Aranya Kanda 3.18.26 &#8220;Then that sister of Khara who is convulsed in the fluster of fear and her body wetted with blood reported to her brother Khara, all about Rama&#8217;s arrival in forest with his wife and Lakshmana, and even about his misshaping her.&#8221; Tr. Desi Raju Hanumanth Rao</p>
<p>Valmiki Ramayana, Aranya Kanda 3.19.1 &#8220;On seeing her who fell before him in a misshapen and blood-soaked condition, demon Khara is all stewed up and asked her. [8] Now, I will take away the lives of that miscreant with my arrows that are terminators of lives, as a swan would drink milk to dregs even if it is mingled in water, duly separating milk from water.&#8221; Tr. Desi Raju Hanumanth Rao</p>
<p>So Shurpanakha was infuriated and she wanted Rama, Lakshmana and Sita to be dead. So her brother Khara sent 14 demons to kill them. Rama kills these fourteen demons. So Khara himself fights with Rama and is killed. Valmiki Ramayana 3.30.20 says that Rama shot over a thousand arrows at Khara. Question is where did he get over a thousand arrows in the forest? Did he take those arrows while he was going for Vanvas? As per Valmiki Ramayana 3.30.30-31 it took one and a half hour for Rama to kill fourteen thousand demons along with Khara and Duushana. Rama shot over a thousand arrows at Khara alone so how is it possible for a human to shoot so many arrows in just one and half hour? Those arrows didn&#8217;t kill Khara but the one arrow called Brahma missile killed Khara which he got from sage Agastya.<br />
Mahabharata, Vana Parva 3.275 &#8220;And after these Rakshasas had been slain, Surpanakha with mutilated nose and lips, repaired to Lanka&#8211;the abode of her brother (Ravana). And when that Rakshasa woman, <span style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;">senseless with grief and with dry blood-stains on her face, appeared before Ravana, she fell down at his feet. And beholding her so horribly mutilated, Ravana became senseless with wrath and grinding his teeth sprung up from his seat</span>. And dismissing his ministers, he enquired of her in private, saying, &#8216;Blessed sister, who hath made thee so, forgetting and disregarding me? Who is he that having got a sharp-pointed spear hath rubbed his body with it? Who is he that sleepeth in happiness and security, after placing a fire close to his head? Who is he that hath trodden upon a revengeful snake of virulent poison? Who indeed, is that person who standeth with his hand thrust into the mouth of the maned lion!&#8217; Then flames of wrath burst forth from his body, like those that are emitted at night from the hollows of a tree on fire. His sister then related unto him the prowess of Rama and the defeat of the Rakshasas with Khara and Dushana at their head. Informed of the slaughter of his relatives, <span style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;">Ravana, impelled by Fate, remembered Maricha for slaying Rama</span>. And resolving upon the course he was to follow and having made arrangements for the government of his capital, he consoled his sister, and set out on an aerial voyage. And crossing the Trikuta and the Kala mountains, he beheld the vast receptacle of deep waters&#8211;the abode of the Makaras. Then crossing the Ocean, the Ten headed Ravana reached Gokarna&#8211;the favourite resort of the illustrious god armed with the trident. And there Ravana met with his old friend Maricha who, from fear of Rama himself, had adopted an ascetic mode of life.&#8221; Tr. K.M. Ganguli<br />
Mahabharata, Vana Parva 3.276 &#8220;…Then he replied to the lord of the Rakshasas saying, &#8216;I shall surely render thee whatever help I can!&#8217; Then the Ten-headed Ravana said unto him, &#8216;Go and tempt Sita, assuming the shape of a deer with golden horns and a golden skin! When Sita will observe thee thus, she will surely send away Rama to hunt thee. And then Sita will surely come within my power, and I shall forcibly carry her away. And then that wicked Rama will surely die of grief at the loss of his wife. Do thou help me in this way…&#8221; Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<h1><strong>How Hanuman confirmed Sita?</strong></h1>
<p>Valmiki Ramayana, Sundar Khanda 5, Sarga 15, verses 28b-29 &#8220;Hanuma saw Seetha with a face like full moon, with beautiful eyebrows, <strong>with graceful rounded breasts</strong>, by the radiance making all directions without darkness, goddess like with black hair, with lips like bimba fruit, with a good waist, very firm, with eyes like lotus petals, like Rati the consort of god of love.&#8221; Tr. Vasudeva Kishore</p>
<h1><strong>Heated argument between Sita and Lakshmana</strong></h1>
<p>Hanumanth Rao summarizes it as: &#8220;Seetha rebukes Lakshmana for he is still here, loitering away even after listening Rama&#8217;s cry for help. She goes to the extent of slandering him as having intents to woo her, at the cost of Rama&#8217;s life. Lakshmana tries to pacify her but in vain, as she persists in her rash talk. Lakshmana leaves her alone and starts to reach Rama, broken-heartedly…&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sita addressed Lakshmana,<br />
Valmiki Ramayana, Aranya Kanda 3.45.5b-7a &#8220;You are like a foe of your brother in friend&#8217;s mien, Soumitri, as you are not making a move towards a brother even if he is in an emergency. Because of me you wish Rama to be completely destroyed, and only because of your cupidity for me you are not following up on Raghava. It is definite.&#8221; Tr. Desi Raju Hanumanth Rao</p>
<p>Valmiki Ramayana, Aranya Kanda 3.45.21b-22 &#8220;You are a debased one devoid of mercy, thus a dreadful one, and a degrader of your dynasty, and I deem that you derive pleasure from fatal hardship to Rama.&#8221; Tr. Desi Raju Hanumanth Rao</p>
<p>Valmiki Ramayana, Aranya Kanda, 3.45.29-30 &#8220;Thou art a very Goddess unto me, I therefore dare not answer thee. What thou hast spoken, O Maithili, is nothing surprising for females. Such is the nature of womankind on this earth. <span style="color: red;">Women by nature are crooked, fickle, devoid of religious knowledge, and bring about difference between father and sons</span>.&#8221; Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<h1><strong>Sita accuses Laxman of eyeing her and calls him a Jackal</strong></h1>
<p>Mahabharata, Vana Parva 3, Section 276 &#8220;Then Lakshmana said to her, &#8220;Timid lady, thou hast no cause of fear! Who is so powerful as to be able to smite Rama? O thou of sweet smiles, in a moment thou wilt behold thy husband Rama!&#8217; Thus addressed, the chaste Sita, from that timidity which is natural to women, became suspicious of even the pure Lakshmana, and began to weep aloud. And that chaste lady, devoted to her husband, harshly reproved Lakshmana, saying, &#8216;The object which thou, O fool, cherishest in thy heart, shall never be fulfilled! I would rather kill myself with a weapon or throw myself from the top of a hill or enter into a blazing fire than live with a sorry wretch like thee, forsaking my husband Rama, like a tigress under the protection of a jackal!&#8221; Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<h1><strong>Sita proves her chastity and is abandoned by Rama<br />
</strong></h1>
<p>Sita is forced to prove her chastity by means of fire ordeal after a washerman accuses her of committing adultery,<br />
Valmiki Ramayana, Bala Kanda 1.1.82-84 &#8220;<span style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;">Then Rama spoke harsh words to Seetha among the assemblages of monkeys, demons, and others, but she that Seetha being husband-devout has entered the burning fire intolerant of those unkindly words of Rama</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Then, upon the word Fire-god, and Rama realised that Seetha is rid of sins and he is very highly gladdened</span>. And when all the gods reverenced him for his great accomplishment in eliminating Ravana, Rama shone forth with his self-resplendence. Thus all the three worlds inclusive of their mobile and sessile beings, all gods with the observances of hermits have become exultant for this great accomplishment of the great souled Raghava&#8221; Tr. Desiraju Hanumanth Rao<br />
Valmiki Ramayana, Yuddha Khanda 6.116.1-2 &#8220;Hearing the harsh words with indignation, spoken by Rama, which caused her hair to stand on end, Seetha became very much perturbed. Hearing the terrific words of her husband, which were never actually heard by her before, amidst a large gathering of people, Seetha stood bent low with shame. [18-19] &#8220;O Lakshmana! Create a pile of fire, for me, which is a remedy for this disaster. I no longer wish to survive, smitten as am with false blames. I will enter a fire, to obtain the only course appropriate for me, who has been abandoned amidst an assembly of men, by my husband who was not satisfied with my traits.&#8221; [29-30] Thus speaking, Seetha walking around the fire-god, with her mind free from hesitation, entered the blazing fire. A large gathering of men including children and elders, saw the shining Seetha having entered the fire there.&#8221; Tr. Shri K.M.K. Murthy</p>
<p>Valmiki Ramayana, Yuddha Khanda 6.118.2-5 &#8220;Shaking off that funeral pile and taking that Seetha, the daughter of Janaka in his arms, the fire-god forthwith sprang up at once in a personified form. Bearing in his arms the youthful Seetha, who was shining brightly as the rising sun, was decked in ornaments of refined gold, attired in a red robe and wore dark curly hair, who was further adorned with ornaments of flowers, which had not abraded (on her entering the fire and coming out of it), who was absolutely beyond reproach and looked just the same (as she did while entering the fire and coming out of it), who was absolutely beyond reproach and looked just the same (as she did while entering the flames), the fire-god restored her to Rama. Then, the fire-god, the witness of the whole world, spoke to Rama as follows &#8220;Here is your Seetha. No sin exists in her.&#8221; [14] &#8220;<span style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;">The world would chatter against me, saying that Rama, the son of Dasaratha, was really foolish and that his mind was dominated by lust, if I accept Seetha without examining her with regard to her chastity</span>.&#8221; Tr. Shri K.M.K. Murthy</p>
<p>Even after proving her chastity via fire ordeal, Pregnant Sita is abandoned in the forest.<br />
Padma Purana V.56.53-64 &#8220;Then Rama told the words that came out of the washerman&#8217;s mouth (i.e. that were uttered by the washerman) and thaat were heard by the spy, to the magnanimous Bharata. Hearing them, Bharata said to his brother who was afflicted with grief: &#8216;Brahma said: &#8216;She is pure&#8217; Your father Dasaratha also (said the same thing). (Then) how should she respected by the world, be abandoned merely on (the strength of) the washerman&#8217;s worlds. How will it be turbid today due to the worlds of the washerman? Therefore, give up the great grief due to the censure of Sita. <span style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;">Look after the kingdom along with her the very fortunate one who is pregnant</span>. How do you wish to abandon your charming body&#8230;Hearing these words of Bharata, the righteous (king), the best among the eloquent, again spoke these words to him: &#8216;O brother, whatever you say is all just. But by my order, carry out the words which I utter. I know that she is purified in fire, is chaste and is honoured by the world. <span style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;">(But) I am afraid of public scandal. (Therefore) I (shall) abandon my (wife) Janaki</span>. So, taking in your hand a sharp and very fierce sword, (either) cut off (my) head, or abandon (my) wife Janaki in the forest.&#8217; Hearing these words of Rama, Bharata, with tremor in his body and tears (in his eyes), fell unconscious on the ground.&#8221; Tr. N.A. Deshpande<br />
So Rama was afraid of public&#8217;s censure. For fame he abandoned his loving pregnant wife.</p>
<p><strong>Proof of existence of Ram<br />
</strong><br />
There is no proof that Rama existed. Hindu stories are mythology. No one knows whether it really happened or not. One of the evidence cited by Hindus is Adam&#8217;s bridge or Ram Sethu, a bridge connecting India with Srilanka. Hindus believes that this was constructed by the Vanar Sena (monkey army) to attack Ravana the king of Lanka and get Sita back. It took 12 years for them to construct this bridge. But as per Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), Ram Sethu is not a man-made bridge but it&#8217;s a natural formation which refutes the &#8216;strong evidence&#8217; of Ram&#8217;s existence. Nasa also rubbished the claims that astronauts taking pictures of Ram Sethu do not prove the existence or otherwise of a manmade Ram Setu bridge as mentioned in the Hindu epic <em>Ramayana</em>.</p>
<p><strong>What ASI has to say about Ram Sethu</strong><br />
Another interesting point to note is the reason why the ASI came to the conclusion that Ram Sethu was not a man-made structure. The ASI says that Ram Sethu is a natural formation made up of shoals/sand bars, which are possessed of their particular shape or form due to several millennia of sand action and sedimentation.<br />
Further, the ASI justified its stand of the bridge not being man-made by stating that no human remains have been discovered at the site of the formation known as the Adam&#8217;s bridge.<br />
After having carried out reconnaissance surveys, bathymetric and sonar studies, sampling and drilling at several locations on the Adam&#8217;s Bridge, the ASI came to the following conclusions:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>The Rameshwaram island evolved approximately 1,25,000 years Before Present.</li>
<li>The Dhanushkodi sand pit appears to be a feature of coastal processes and shoreline emergence and its orientation appears to be along the dissipation of wave energy patters of Palk Bay and Gulf of Manor.</li>
<li>The marine domain between Rameshwaram and Sri Lanka was exposed between 18,000 and 7,000 years BP during which time it would have been possible for human beings and animals to travel on foot between India and Lanka.</li>
<li>Rock and Soil samples show that the same being from the Upper Miocene period.</li>
<li>The coastal areas around Mandapam, Rameshwaram and Adams Bridge indicate their revolution by a combination of various coastal processes such as palaeo sea level positions which led to the formation of beach rocks, coral growth, a series of islands known as Adams Bridge and the subsidence of the erstwhile Dhanushkodi township.</li>
<li>The field geographical observations and drilling data confirmed that there were no indications or evidences of man made structures on the present day seabed or on the subsurface level between Dhanushkodi tip and the Adam&#8217;s bridge islands within the exclusive economic zone limits of India.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Photos no proof of Ram Setu: NASA</strong><br />
&#8220;The mysterious bridge was nothing more than a 30 km long, naturally-occurring chain of sandbanks called Adam&#8217;s bridge,&#8221; Hess had added.<br />
The same day, the government submitted an affidavit in the Supreme Court in which the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) said there were no historical records to prove the existence of a manmade Ram Setu. The Ramayana says Lord Ram&#8217;s army had built a bridge across the sea to Lanka (now Sri Lanka) on their way to battle the demon king Ravana.<br />
The affidavit prepared by ASI had gone on to say there were no historical records to prove the existence of Lord Ram either<br />

<h4><strong>Myth vs Science</strong></h4>
<p>Two independent scientific agencies, namely the Geological Survey of India (GSI) and the Space Applications Centre (SAC) of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), and individual geologists have conducted detailed studies on the geological formations associated with Ram Sethu and all have established conclusively that Ram Sethu is not a man-made structure.<br />
The GSI carried out a special programme called “Project Rameswaram” between December 2002 and March 2003, which, according to the GSI’s newsletter of September 2003 annexed in the government counter-affidavit, included: (i) reconnaissance survey; (ii) drilling the Dhanushkodi Foreland (the eastern projection of the Rameswaram island); (iii) offshore surveys involving depth measurements; (iv) seabed samples and side scan sonar images of the seabed; (v) drilling in one of the islands within the Exclusive Economic Zone, or EEZ (which is about 10 km from the Dhanushkodi tip); and (vi) radiocarbon or C-14 dating and thermoluminescence (TL) dating of samples.<br />
Four boreholes, roughly 4 km apart, were drilled to collect subsurface sediment/rock samples to generate geological data towards determining the geological history of Dhanushkodi Foreland and Adam’s Bridge/Ram Sethu. Samples from different locations off Mandapam (located on the mainland coast across the Rameswaram island) were taken for TL dating.<br />
Important among the GSI’s conclusions, based on the geological investigations of its marine wing, are the following:<br />
There are no indications or evidence of man-made structures in the present-day seabed or in the sub-surface level between Dhanushkodi tip and Adam’s Bridge islands within India’s EEZ limits. Age data of corals indicate that the Rameswaram island has evolved since 125,000 years ago.<br />
A combination of various natural coastal processes such as sea level positions in the historical past, wind-borne activity, new tectonic movements, wave action, etc., have led to the evolution of the coastal areas around Mandapam, Rameswaram and Adam’s Bridge/Ram Sethu, which has led to the formation of beach rocks, coral growth, vast stretches of coastal dunes, series of islands (of Ram Sethu) and subsidence of the erstwhile Dhanushkodi township.<br />

<h3><strong>Why new ‘Ram Setu’ video is no more than an interest-rouser, a talking point</strong></h3>
<p>So, what exactly does the video show?<br />
It shows images that it says were captured by a NASA satellite over the “shallow waters” of the Indian Ocean, revealing something like a “chain of submerged objects running largely between Sri Lanka and India”. It says that on closer analysis, “investigators” had calculated that the “line of rocks” was “over 30 miles long”.<br />
The video essentially makes two claims. One, that the rocks at the site “predate” the surrounding sand. “Scientific analysis reveals the rocks are 7,000 years old but are sitting over the top of sand that is only 4,000 years old,” it says. And two, that these rocks do not belong there and have been brought from somewhere else, possibly by a human agency.<br />
These claims are not, however, made by any of the three “experts”. They are part of the commentary in the video. An unidentified individual says these are “stones that have been brought from afar and set on top of the sandbar island chain”.<br />
And how credible are these two claims?<br />
The promotional video cites no sources or studies. The basis for the claims will perhaps be known once the full episode is broadcast. It is best to wait until then.<br />
However, none of the several Indian oceanographers and geologists that The Indian Express spoke to over Wednesday and Thursday were aware of any new published material in any peer-reviewed journal that would support these assertions. Several of them had seen the video, and they said it raised more questions than answers. “The claims in this video do not merit a discussion until the evidence or source is revealed,” Dr Rajiv Nigam, an acclaimed marine geologist who retired from the Goa-based National Institute of Oceanography, said.<br />
While no scientific attempt has been made to date the rocks or the sand at the site, the claim that the rocks could be 7,000 years old is not entirely implausible, said C P Rajendran, a geologist with the Bengaluru-based Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research.<br />
However, like Dr Nigam, Prof Rajendran, too, said it was difficult to believe any claim in the absence of dating methodology and other information. “The claim about rocks having been transported from somewhere else… It need not necessarily be due to human intervention,” Prof Rajendran said. “It is possible that the rocks were transported by cyclones, which are pretty frequent in that area. But we need to have more information, and it is not there in this video,” he said.<br />
How then should this video be seen?<br />
Solely as an effort to “stimulate interest and conversation” in topics such as these, according to Argyilan, one of the experts quoted in the video. The Indian Express had contacted Argyilan and Rose to know more about the claims. Till the time of going to press, only Argyilan had responded. In an email, she said that she had “not performed primary scientific research related to Ram Setu”, and that she had been asked to comment “only on the satellite photograph” presented in the programme. “My specific comments in the piece address only the visual clues related to presence of a carbonate shoal — bright, light blue waters in a carbonate environment indicative of shallow waters between India and Sri Lanka,” Argyilan said<br />

Rama was nothing but a fictional character.</p>
<h1><strong>Babri mosque/Ram Janmabhoomi</strong></h1>
<p>As I said there is no evidence that Ram even existed let alone proving his birth place. There is no record of when he was born. Hindus claim Babri mosque to be birthplace of Ram because there stands a mosque, had the mosque stood 25 kilometre from current spot then Hindus would&#8217;ve claimed that to be the birthplace of Rama. There is not a single historical document showing that Babri mosque was built over the ruins of a temple, nor does Baburnama says that. There is proof that people in the 16th century visited banks of Sarayu river for pilgrimage but there is no proof that people visited the spot (on which Babri mosque was built) for pilgrimage. Babur&#8217;s commander Mir Baqi constructed Babri mosque 500 years ago so there must have been some historical record of people visiting it prior to the construction of Babri mosque. After all its not so old, its just 500 years old history so there must have been some historical evidence to prove that Babri mosque was built after destruction of Ramjanmabhoomi. There were two renowned Hindu scholars in the 16th century namely Chaitanya Mahaprabhu who was the founder of Gaudiya Vaishnavism and another one was Tulsidas Goswami the ardent devotee of Ram who wrote Tulsi Ramayana, these two do not mention demolition of Ram temple. Hindu scriptures instead locates birthplace of Rama far away from the spot of Babri mosque,</p>
<p>Skanda Purana, Vaisnava Khanda 2, Ayodhya-Mahatmya 8, chapter 10, verses 16b-19 &#8220;To the west of it, the devotees should worship Vighnesvara by seeing whom not even the least obstacle remains (in the affairs) of men. Hence Vignesvara, the bestower of all desired benefits, should be worshipped. To the north-east of that spot is the place of the birth of Rama. This holy spot of the birth is, it is said, the means of achieving salvation etc. It is said that the place of birth is situated to the east of Vighnesvara, to the north of Vasistha and to the west of Laumasa.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>I have used Skanda Purana translated by Ganesh Vasudeo Tagare and published by Motilal Banarsidass. Historians in the following passage have used other version of Skanda Purana namely the Vrindavan manuscripts and Bodleian Library, Oxford,</p>
<p>“…We have used the printed version of the Skanda Purana (Kashemarian edn, Bombay, 1910) and two other versions found in Manuscripts in Vrindavan Reswarch Institute, Vrindaban, and the Bodleian Library, Oxford…The internal contents of the Skanda Purana including the mention of Vidyapati, who passed away in the first half of the 16<sup>th</sup> century, show that the core of this Purana itself was not compiled until earlier than the 16<sup>th</sup> century. Ayodhya-Mahatmya given in the printed version has not been compiled by one hand. For example, the course of the description of the tirathas [pilgrimage] in general is interrupted and all of a sudden the glorification of Ayodhya starts…The description of Janamsthan occurs in the last chapter of the Ayodhya-mahatmya (verses 18-25), and is clearly a latter addition. It is easier to make insertions at the end of texts. In spite of these various inconsistencies, even if we accept the location of the birthplace of Rama as given in Ayodhya-mahatmya, it does not tally with the site of the Baburi Masjid. Two terms are used for the birthplace of Rama, Janamsthan and Janambhumi. Even if we take the two to be identical, the Ayodhya-mahatmya information about the location of the birthplace does not take us to the Baburi Masjid site. Both the Vrindaban and Bodleian version of the Mahatmya mention the compass directions and distance from a few states. According to verses 21.24 the birthplace is located 500 dhanus (910 meters) westward of Laumash and 1009 (1835 meters) eastward of Vighneshvara. According to local Hindu belief Laumash or the place of Lomash is identical with the present Rinamochana Ghat. On this basis the Rama Janmabhumi should be located somewhere west, in the vicinity of the Brahmakunda close to the bed of Sarayu. Further according to the Mahatmya Rinamochana Ghat, or the place of Lomash, lies 700 dhanu (1274 meters) northeast of Brahmakunda. Both the direction and the distance have been found to be approximately correct by us. It is further stated that the Janmasthan lies northeast of Vighnesh. According to local tradition the place of Vighnesh is marked by a pillar, which lies southwest of Rinamochana Ghat. This again excludes the Baburi Masjid site and places the birthplace somewhere between Rinamochana and Brahmakunda on the bank of Saraya. Thus, according to Hindu belief as given in the Ayodhya Mahatmya of the Skanda Purana, the birth place of Rama cannot be located on the site where the Baburi Masjid stands. It is argued by experts of the VHP that the location of Rama Janambhumi is given on the basis of solar directions and cannot be determined through the use of campus. But even if we take solar directions into account the Janambhumi of the Skanda Purana cannot be located on the site of the Baburi Masjid…”<br />

<p>The whole basis of Ayodhya case was that a temple had been demolished and then a mosque was built over it, but Supreme Court said in its judgement that &#8220;<a href="https://www.livemint.com/news/india/ayodhya-verdict-here-are-key-highlights-from-supreme-court-s-judgement-11573286449525.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">ASI had not established whether temple was demolished to build the mosque<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>.&#8221; The verdict was given on the basis of faith of Hindus and not on facts, it was already known that verdict was going to be delivered in favor of Hindus in Hindu majority India since Hindu party was favored in the court. <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/ayodhya-case-questions-put-only-to-us-not-to-hindu-side-muslim-parties-allege-in-sc-1609393-2019-10-15" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Questions<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> were put only to Muslims and not to Hindus in the Supreme Court. <a href="http://www.jantakareporter.com/india/saryu-river-stream-found-underneath-ram-temple-site-trust-seeks-desperate-help-from-iit-for-better-models-netizens-take-dig-at-ayodhya-verdict/327191/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">River stream<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> was found underneath Ram temple site, now we need to know if Ram was born in middle of a river or on a boat?

<p>Renowned historian Sarvepalli Gopal writes,<br />
&#8220;It is quite evident that no temple-mosque controversy was known in Ayodhya till the nineteenth century. Local stories were put into circulation and claims were raised over the places of worship in Ayodhya. The British played a significant role in strengthening the claim by providing the local stories with a historical basis. The British in Faizabad and Ayodhya had come to stay after AD 1816. The devepments in Ayodhya were an extension of whatever was happening in the adjoining district of Banaras, where a great riot had occurred in 1809. By then the British had been in the area for over twenty five years. It is therefore certain that the attempt of the British writers to provide a historical basis to the circulating local myths, fostered the Babri Masjid-Ramjanmabhumi issue in Ayodhya.&#8221; <strong>Anatomy of a confrontation: the rise of communal politics in India, p.48, by Sarvepalli Gopal, Palgrave Macmillan, 15-Oct-1993</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;It seems probable that in the nineteenth century the idea started developing in Avadh that Babur had destroyed the Ramjanmabhumi temple and erected a mosque in its place. In 1838, Montgomery Martin wrote that the people of Ayodhya maintained that a mosque had been raised by Babur. Martin added that as in other parts of North India, in Ayodhya too, Aurgangzeb was blamed for the destruction of several Hindu temples. However, it was Babur&#8217;s mosque that attracted Martin&#8217;s attention most. He wrote that in the construction of the mosque, carved black stone pillars had been used and as they were un-Islamic they confirm the destruction of temples by Muslim zealots. However, Martin felt that the Babri Masjid had not been built from the debris of the temple said to have been erected by Vikrama of Ujjain. The story of Babur and his mosque started gaining significance in the nineteenth century. In 1819, John Leyden translated the memoirs of Babur and he wrote that Babur had encamped near Ayodhya on 28 march 1528. In 1826 Erksine remarked that he had found a document that confirmed that Babur remained in Ayodhya for a fortnight and was involved in building activites. The remarks by these two confirmed the local myth that Babur had destroyed the Ramjanmabhumi temple during his stay in Ayodhya. In 1866, H.M. Elliot asserted that Babur came to Ayodhya and destroyed the famous temple. He added that the mosque was constructed about the time of his expedition to Bihar. It was on the basis of these writings that the idea gained popularity. Most of the British officials and scholars who tried to put together a history of Ayodhya highlighted the desecration of the temple commemorating the birthplace of Rama. This idea became so strongly entrenched in the psyche of the British officials and the local people that it was difficult to dislodge it.&#8221; <strong>Anatomy of a Confrontation: Ayodhya and the Rise of Communal Politics in India, p.47, By Sarvepalli Gopal, Palgrave Macmillan, 15-Oct-1993</strong></p>

<h1><strong>Birth of Rama and Sita<br />
</strong></h1>
<p>King Dashratha didn&#8217;t have any son so he performed <a href="/index.php/2014/05/14/ashvamedha-yajna-the-obscene-ritual/" data-wpel-link="internal">Ashvamedha Yajna</a> and then Kaushalya gave birth to Rama and other wives also gave birth to Bharata, Lakshmana and Shatrugana.<br />
As per Hindu scriptures Sita didn&#8217;t have any mother, she was born from earth or arosed from the earth.</p>
<p>Sita is described as born of no woman (or womb), this is mentioned in Agni Purana 5.11-12; Valmiki Ramayana 1.66.26. Sita addresses Rama,<br />
Valmiki Ramayana Yudha Khanda 6.116.15 &#8220;O knower of virtuous conduct! My birth was from Janaka in disguise; <span style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;">but was actually from the earth</span>. My sacred birth of such a high degree, was not honoured by you.&#8221; Tr. Shri K.M.K. Murthy</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Rama disowns Sita</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The entire chapter 115 of Yuddha Kanda speaks of this. Ram says that he liberated Sita from Ravana not because of his affection to Sita but only to get back his lost honor. Ram clearly tells Sita that he has not affection towards Sita. And then goes on to say that Sita is free to take shelter elsewhere, the Maryada Purshottom (ideal man) even tells his wife to go to any person namely Lakshaman, Bharat, Shatrughna, Sugreeva or even to demon Vibhishan the brother of Ravana. Hearing these words of Rama, Sita started to cry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Valmiki Ramayana, Yuddha Kanda 6, Sarga 115, verses 1-25 “Seeing that Seetha, who stood at his vicinity bowing low, Rama began to tell his feeling hidden in his heart. You are won back by me, after conquering the enemy in the battle-field, my dear lady! That which is to be done through human effort, has been accomplished by me. I have come to the end of my indignation and my outrage has been completely requited as also the contempt against the enemy have been wiped out, all at once, by me. Now, my manly strength has been seen by all. Today, my toil has borne fruit. Now, I have fulfilled my promise. Today, I am the master of myself. The wrong done to you, when you were deserted from me, in that you were taken away by a fickle-minded demon, which was ordained by the destiny, has been corrected by me as a human being. What is the use of a prowess, however great, of that weak-minded man who does not wipe out, by his energy, the insult fallen to his lot? The praise-worthy act of Hanuma in the form of crossing of the ocean and the destroying of Lanka, has borne fruit today. The endeavour of Sugreeva, who exhibited his prowess on the battle-field with his army and tendered a good advice, is fruitful today. Furthermore, the exertion of Vibhishana, who after deserting his brother who was void of good qualities, sought my presence, is fruitful today. Hearing those words spoken thus by Rama, Seetha with her eyes wide open like those of a female-deer, was bathed in tears. The heart of King Rama, as he saw Seetha, (the beloved of his heart) near him, was torn for fear of public scandal. In the midst of monkeys and demons, Rama spoke (as follows) to Seetha, whose eyes resembled the petals of a lotus, who wore dark curly hair and was endowed with fine hips. I, wanting for an honour, have done this particular act, which ought to be done by a man, in killing Ravana and thus wiping away the insult meted out to me. You have been won by me, whose mind stands purified by asceticism as the southern quarter, which was difficult to be approached by the world of mortals, was conquered by the Sage Agastya. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;">Let it be known to you that this endeavor in the shape of war, which has been successful carried through, due to the strength of my friends was not undertaken for your sake</span></span>. Let there be prosperity to you! This was done by me in order to keep up my good conduct and to wipe off the evil-speaking from all sides as well as the insinuation on my own illustrious dynasty. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><u>You, with a suspicion arisen on your character, standing in front of me, are extremely disagreeable to me, even as a light to one, who is suffering from a poor eye-sight. O Seetha! That is why, I am permitting you now. Go wherever you like. All these ten directions are open to you</u></span>, my dear lady! There is no work to be done to me, by you. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><u>Which noble man, born in an illustrious race, will take back a woman who lived in another&#8217;s abode, with an eager mind? While mentioning greatly about my lineage, how can I accept again, you who were harassed in Ravana&#8217;s lap</u></span> (while being borne away by him) and who were seen (by him) with evil looks? You were won by me with that end in view (viz. the retrieval of my lost honour). The honour has been restored by me. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><u>For me, there is no intense attachment in you</u></span>. You may go wherever you like from here. O gracious lady! Therefore, this has been spoken by me today, with a resolved mind. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><u>Set your mind on Lakshmana or Bharata, as per your ease. O Seetha! Otherwise, set your mind either on Shatrughna or on Sugreeva or on Vibhishana the demon</u></span>; or according to your own comfort. Seeing you, who are endowed with a beautiful form and attractive to the sense, detained for long in his abode, Ravana could not have endured your separation. Hearing that unpalatable speech of her beloved husband, Seeta who used to hear pleasing words alone, was very much trembled for long, like a creeper attacked by the proboscis of an elephant and thereupon shed tears.” Tr. K. M. K. Murthy</p>

<h1><strong>Rama and Sita commits suicide</strong></h1>
<p>Ram commits suicide by drowning himself into the Sarayu River. Now Hindu fanatics attacking minorities by chanting Jai Shree Ram should also follow what Ram did who came on earth in flesh and bone to teach the way of living.</p>
<p>Valmiki Ramayana, Uttara Khanda, chapter 110 &#8220;When he had proceeded about six miles, <span style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;">the Pride of the Raghus beheld the sacred waters of the Sarayu flowing westwards, eddying and rippling in their course, and he went on further to the Goprataraka Ghata</span>, his subjects thronging round him on all sides. At that momemnt, as Kakutsth was preparing to ascent to heaven. Brahma, the Grandsire of the World, surrounded by the Gods and the illustrious Rishis adorned with jewels, appeared seated in their aerial chariots, and the whole firmament glowed with a transcendent splendour&#8230;Thereafter to the sound of a myriad instruments and the singing of the Gandharvas and Apsaras, <span style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;">Rama stepped into the waters</span>, whereupon the Grandsire, from on high, uttered these words: &#8216;Hail O Vishnu! Hail O Raghava! With thy God-like brothers, now enter thine eternal abode! Return to thien body if thou so desirest, O Long-armed warrior! Occupy the realm of Vishnu or the shining ether&#8230;Hearing these words of the Grandsire, <span style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;">the supremely virtuous Rama formed his resolution and entered Vishnu&#8217;s abode in his body with his younger brothers</span>&#8230;&#8221; Tr.

The Goddess Dharani, bidding her welcome, took Maithili in her arms, causing her to be seated on that celestial seat and, while she occupied the throne, a shower of blossoms fell without ceasing from the sky. Then the Gods bursts into loud acclamations, crying &#8216;Excellent! Excellent! O Sita thy virtue is supreme!&#8217;&#8230; The entire assembly witnessed Sita&#8217;s descent into the earth and, at that moment, a great tremor passed through the whole world.&#8221; Tr.

<p>Written by Sulaiman Razvi<br />
Some doctors say head transplant is impossible and some say it could be possible in future. But Hindu gods used to do head transplant in the Vedic period after beheading. Instead of calling this as a miracle Hindus try to prove it scientifically. The most famous head transplant everyone knows is that of Ganesha after he was beheaded by Shiva and elephant&#8217;s head was fixed on his body. But there are few more such stories present in Hindu scriptures.<br />
<span id="more-2704"></span><br />
<strong>GANESH</strong></p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Rudrasamhita 2, Kumara Khanda 4.16.34-35 &#8220;Securing this opportunity, the Trident-bearing deity came there and cut off his head with his trident. O Narada, when the head of Ganesa was cut off, the armies of the gods and the Ganas stood still.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri<br />
Shiva Purana, Rudrasamhita 2, Kumara Khanda 4.14.46-56 &#8220;On hearing what the gods said, Siva spoke thus &#8216;It shall be done accordingly so that there may be peace over all the worlds.&#8217; <span style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;">&#8216;You shall go to the northern direction and whatever person you meet at first you cut off his head and fit it to this body</span>.&#8217; Brahma said: Then they carried out Siva&#8217;s behests and acted accordingly. They brought the headless body of Ganesa and washed it well. They paid homage to it and started towards the north. It was a single-tusked elephant that they met. They took the head and fitted it to the body. After joining it, the gods bowed to Siva, Visnu and Brahma&#8230;They said: &#8216;Since we all are born out of your brilliant Energy let that Energy come into it by the recitation of the Vedic mantras. Saying so, they jointly sprinkled the holy water, invoked by the mantras on that body after remembering Siva. Immediately after the contact of the holy water the boy was resuscitated to life and joined with consciousness. As Siva willed, the boy woke up as from a sleep.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>They would&#8217;ve beheaded even an infant if they saw an infant first in northern direction.</p>
<p><strong>DAKSHA</strong></p>
<p>Daksha was the father in law of Shiva. As per some versions he was beheaded by Virabhadra a form created by Shiva. To punish Daksha as Daksha started Yajna after censuring Shiva, he invited all gods and sages except Shiva. Shiva beheaded Ganesha and fixed elephant&#8217;s head and he beheaded Daksha and fixed a goat&#8217;s head, seems like he was fond of fixing animal head on human body,</p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 7.30.39-50. &#8220;…Though Mahâdeva lost everything on Satî&#8217;s departure, He, the Ocean of Mercy, destroyed the sacrifice of Daksa, cut off his head and instead placed the head of a goat, brought him back to life and thus made the Gods free from all fears.&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 4.7.3 &#8220;Lord Śiva continued: Since the head of Dakṣa has already been burned to ashes, he will have the head of a goat. The demigod known as Bhaga will be able to see his share of sacrifice through the eyes of Mitra.&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada<br />
Shiva says that since the head of Daksha is burned so he cannot restore it as if he restored Ganesh&#8217;s head on his body.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>VISHNU/HAYAGRIVA</strong></p>
<p>Devi Bhagavtam 1.4.55-61 &#8220;O Svayambhu! In ancient days you saw before your eyes that my head was cut off when the bowstring suddenly gave way; and then you, brought a horse&#8217;s head and by that help, the divine artist Visvakarma, stuck that on to my headless body. O Brahmâ! Since then I am known amongst men by the name of &#8220;Hayagrîva&#8221;. Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 1.5.106-112 &#8220;Visvakarmâ quickly cut off with his axe, the head of a horse, brought it before the Devas and fixed it on the headless body of Visnu. By the grace of Mahâmâyâ, Bhagavân became horse-faced or Hayagrîva.&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Also mentioned in,<br />
Skanda Purana III.ii.15 and Harivamsa Purana 2.70.30-31. Swami Nikhilananda writes,<br />
&#8220;&#8230;The story as narrated in the Vedas is as follows: Vishnu, proud of his well earned superiority over the other gods, once stood resting his chin on the end of a bow. The jealous gods got some white ants to gnaw off the bow-string, and as a result Vishnu&#8217;s head was severed. His head became the sun. Now, Vishnu means the sacrifice, because He is identified with it. As the sacrifice cannot remain without a head, the gods asked their physician, the Asvins, to restore the head. This rite, described in the Satapatha Brahmana, includes the honey, or the madhu-doctrine, connected with the sun&#8230;&#8221; <strong>Swami Nikhilananda on Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 2.5.17</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>JAMADAGNI</strong></p>
<p>Jamadagni was the father of Parashurama the sixth incarnation of Vishnu. He was beheaded by Kartivirya Arjuna&#8217;s sons. To avenge the murder of his father Parashurama exterminates entire Kshatriya race from the earth. And later restores the head of his father and resurrects him,<br />
Srimad Bhagavatam 9.16.20 &#8220;Thereafter, Paraśurāma joined his father&#8217;s head to the dead body and placed the whole body and head upon kuśa grass. By offering sacrifices, he began to worship Lord Vāsudeva, who is the all-pervading Supersoul of all the demigods and of every living entity.&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 9.16.24 &#8220;Thus Jamadagni, being worshiped by Lord Paraśurāma, was brought back to life with full remembrance, and he became one of the seven sages in the group of seven stars.&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>BHRIGU&#8217;S WIFE</strong></p>
<p>Vishnu with his Sudarshana Chakra beheads the wife of Sage Bhrigu. Bhrigu curses Vishnu and restores the head of his wife,<br />
Matsya Purana 1.47.108-111 &#8220;Afterwards, the seer Bhrigu at once picked up the severed head of his wife and joined it to the trunk, saying:- &#8216;Devi! You have been killed by Lord Visnu, and now I recall you to life again.&#8217; Saying that, he joined the head and the trunk together and said &#8216;Abhijiva;&#8217; (&#8216;be revived&#8217;)&#8217; if I have fulfilled all the rules of law and acted righteously, and if I have always spoken the truth, then through that truth you come back to life. I say so truthfully. After that, he sprinkled cold water and again pronounced the spell, &#8216;Abhijiva,&#8217; and the lady at once came back to life.&#8221; Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 4.11.11-14 &#8220;Vyâsa said :&#8211; O king! The sacrificer Bhrigu angrily cursed Hari and next took that severed head and quickly placed it over the body as before and said:&#8211; O Devî! Visnu has slain you today; I will make you regain your life just now. If I am acquainted with all the Dharmas and if I have practised these in my life and if I have spoken truth always, then dost thou regain your life by my religious merit.&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>MUNI DHADHYAM</strong></p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 7.36.28. &#8220;O Best of Mountains! It is very difficult to acquire Brahma Jñâna. Hear a story. A Muni named Dadhyam of Atharvana family went to Indra and prayed to him to give Brahma Jñâna. Indra said: &#8220;I would give you Brahma-Jñâna, but if you impart it to any other body, I would sever your head.&#8221; Dadhyarna agreed to this and Indra gave him the Brahma-Jñâna. After a few days, the two As&#8217;vins came to the Muni and prayed for Brahma Vidyâ, The Muni said:&#8211; &#8220;If I give you the Brahma-Vidyi, Indra, will cut off my head.&#8221; Hearing this the two As&#8217;vins said:&#8211; &#8220;We will cut your head and keep it elsewhere and we will attach the head of a horse to your body. Instruct us with the mouth of this horse and when Indra will cut off your this mouth, we will replace your former head.&#8221; When they said so, the Muni gave them the Brahma-Vidyâ. Indra cut off his head by his thunderbolt. When the horse-head of the Muni was cut off, the two physicians of the Devas replaced his original head. This is widely known in all the Vedas.&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>This is also mentioned in Rig Veda 1.116.12, Satapatha Brahmana 14.1.1.20-25 and Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 2.5.16-17 which is explained by Adi Shankaracharya,<br />
&#8220;&#8230;Dadhyac, versed in the Atharva-Veda, taught these Asvins the section dealing with the meditation on things mutually helpfull; it was a favourite subject with them; therefore he came to them (wishing to teach them) thus (S. XIV.I.iv.13): &#8216;He said, &#8216;Indra has told me that he will behead me the moment I teach it to anybody; therefore I am afraid of him. If he does not behead me, then I will accept you as my disciples.&#8217; They said, &#8216;We will protect you from him.&#8217; &#8216;Who will you protect me?&#8217; &#8216;When you will accept us your disciples, we shall cut off your head, remove it elsewhere and preserve it. Then bringing a horse&#8217;s head we shall fix it on you: you will teach us through that. As you do so, Indra will cut off that head of yours, then we shall bring your own head and replace it on you.&#8217; &#8216;All right,&#8217; said the Brahmana, and accepted the Asvins as his disciples. When he did so, they cut off his head and kept it elsewhere; then bringing a horse&#8217;s head they fixed it on him; through that he taught them. As he was teaching them, Indra cut off that head. Then the Asvins brought his own head and replaced it on him&#8230;&#8221; <strong>Adi Shankaracharya on Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 2.5.16, Tr. Swami Madhavananda</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>SAGE DADHICHA</strong><br />
Linga Purana Section I, 35.3-4 &#8220;Nandin said: There was a king of great splendour known as Ksupa. He was the son of Brahma. He, the lord of the people, was the friend of Dadhica, a leading sage. In course of time, incidentally a dispute arose between Ksuppa and Dadhica as to who was the better a Kshatriya or a Brahmin. [7-12] On hearing that opinion of Kuspa the great sage Dadhica, son of Cyavana, struck Ksupa on the head with his left fist, believing in his own supremacy as a brahmin. But the powerful Ksupa hit Dadhica with his thunderbolt. Formerly he was born in the world of Brahma when Brahma sneezed. He was urged by the thunderbolt-wielding Indra to perform a task. He obtained the thunderbolt as a reward for his task. Out of his own will, he became a human, being and afterwards a king. The powerful king then conquered the leading brahmin like the powerful Indra himself, full of tamas qualities. When struck by the thunderbolt the leading brahmin fell on the ground.&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Linga Purana Section I, 35.13-15 &#8220;Out of sorrow he remembered sage Bhargava. Bhargava, the best among the embodied beings, came there and by his yogic power he stitched the body of Dadhica who had been struck by the thunderbolt. After stitching the severed body Bhargava said: O highly blessed Dadhica, worship Siva, the unsullied lord of Devas, worthy of worship by Brahma and others. O brahmin sage! by the grace of the three-eyed lord, you become immortal. O brahmin, this power of resuscitating one to life has been obtained from him by me.&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>

Scientific Researches Proving Aryan Migration/Invasion</strong><br />
articles compiled by Sulaiman Razvi<br />
Aryan migration can be proved from literary work as well as scientific evidence. Scientific genetic studies have proved that Aryans came to India some 4000 years ago and genes of upper caste Hindu Brahmins can be traced to Eurasia.<br />
<span id="more-4769"></span></p>
<h1><span style="color: #ff0000;">Aryan migration: Everything you need to know about the new study on Indian genetics</span></h1>
<p><strong>Who authored the study? </strong>There are 92 named authors on the study including scholars from Harvard, MIT, the Russian Academy of Science, the Birbal Sahni Institute of Paleosciences in Lucknow, the Deccan College, the Max Planck Institute, the Institute for Archaeological Research in Uzbekistan and the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology, Hyderabad. Among the co-directors of the study is geneticist David Reich, whose new book has inspired <a href="https://samharris.org/ezra-klein-editor-chief/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">much recent discussion<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/23/opinion/sunday/genetics-race.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">ancient human history and racial theory.<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p><strong>How was the study conducted? </strong>The researchers looked at genome-wide data from 612 ancient individuals, meaning DNA samples of people that lived millennia ago. These included samples from eastern Iran, an area called Turan that now covers Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Tajikistan, Kazakhstan and South Asia. Of the 612, the DNA of 362 ancient individuals was being examined for the first time. They then compared this data with that taken from present-day individuals, including 246 distinct groups in South Asia.</p>
<p><strong>SOME POINTS FROM THE RESEARCH</strong>: DNA and other human science based research has thrown up confusing signals in the past, with mitochondrial DNA, which is only transferred by females being mostly unique to the subcontinent. This suggested that the inhabitants of India have been indigenous for thousands of years. However, Y chromosomes, which are passed from male to male, showed much more connection to West Eurasians, whether Europeans, people of the Irani plateau or Central Asians.<br />
And finally, there are the Steppe pastoralists, the inhabitants of the vast Central Asian grasslands to the north of Afghanistan, who were previously known as ‘Aryans.’<br />
Some form of “Aryan” migration did take place, even if that term is not used. The introduction of Steppe pastoralists into the subcontinent might have been the way what we know as Indo-European language and culture spread, since it was the same lot of Steppe peoples that also moved West into Europe.<br />
Moreover, there may be connection between the Steppe migration and priestly caste and culture. The researchers say they found 10 out of 140 Indian groups with a higher amount of Steppe ancestry compared to Indus Valley ancestry. These two were titled “Brahmin_Tiwari” and “Brahmin_UP”. More generally groups of priestly status seem to have higher Steppe ancestry, suggesting those with this mixture may have had a central role in spreading Vedic culture.</p>

<h1><span style="color: #ff0000;">How genetics is settling the Aryan migration debate</span></h1>
<p><strong>Article based on research by:</strong> 16 scientists led by Prof. Martin P. Richards of the University of Huddersfield, U.K<br />
<strong>Excerpts from the article</strong>: The paper that put all of the recent discoveries together into a tight and coherent history of migrations into India was published just three months ago in a peer-reviewed journal called ‘BMC Evolutionary Biology’. In that paper, titled “A Genetic Chronology for the Indian Subcontinent Points to Heavily Sex-biased Dispersals”, 16 scientists led by Prof. Martin P. Richards of the University of Huddersfield, U.K., concluded: “Genetic influx from Central Asia in the Bronze Age was strongly male-driven, consistent with the patriarchal, patrilocal and patrilineal social structure attributed to the inferred pastoralist early Indo-European society. This was part of a much wider process of Indo-European expansion, with an ultimate source in the Pontic-Caspian region, which carried closely related Y-chromosome lineages… across a vast swathe of Eurasia between 5,000 and 3,500 years ago”.<br />
Now that we know that there WAS indeed a significant inflow of genes from Central Asia into India in the Bronze Age, can we get a better fix on the timing, especially the splintering of Z93 into its own sub-lineages? Yes, we can; the research paper that answers this question was published just last year, in April 2016, titled: “Punctuated bursts in human male demography inferred from 1,244 worldwide Y-chromosome sequences.” This paper, which looked at major expansions of Y-DNA haplogroups within five continental populations, was lead-authored by David Poznik of the Stanford University, with Dr. Underhill as one of the 42 co-authors. The study found “the most striking expansions within Z93 occurring approximately 4,000 to 4,500 years ago”. This is remarkable, because roughly 4,000 years ago is when the Indus Valley civilization began falling apart. (There is no evidence so far, archaeologically or otherwise, to suggest that one caused the other; it is quite possible that the two events happened to coincide.)<br />
The avalanche of new data has been so overwhelming that many scientists who were either sceptical or neutral about significant Bronze Age migrations into India have changed their opinions. Dr. Underhill himself is one of them. In a 2010 paper, for example, he had written that there was evidence “against substantial patrilineal gene flow from East Europe to Asia, including to India” in the last five or six millennia. Today, Dr. Underhill says there is no comparison between the kind of data available in 2010 and now. “Then, it was like looking into a darkened room from the outside through a keyhole with a little torch in hand; you could see some corners but not all, and not the whole picture. With whole genome sequencing, we can now see nearly the entire room, in clearer light.”<br />
Dr. Underhill is not the only one whose older work has been used to argue against Bronze Age migrations by Indo-European language speakers into India. David Reich, geneticist and professor in the Department of Genetics at the Harvard Medical School, is another one, even though he was very cautious in his older papers. The best example is a study lead-authored by Reich in 2009, titled “Reconstructing Indian Population History” and published in Nature. This study used the theoretical construct of “Ancestral North Indians” (ANI) and “Ancestral South Indians” (ASI) to discover the genetic substructure of the Indian population. The study proved that ANI are “genetically close to Middle Easterners, Central Asians, and Europeans”, while the ASI were unique to India. The study also proved that most groups in India today can be approximated as a mixture of these two populations, with the ANI ancestry higher in traditionally upper caste and Indo-European speakers. By itself, the study didn’t disprove the arrival of Indo-European language speakers; if anything, it suggested the opposite, by pointing to the genetic linkage of ANI to Central Asians.<br />
The first argument was that there were no major gene flows from outside to India in the last 12,500 years or so because mtDNA data showed no signs of it. This argument was found faulty when it was shown that Y-DNA did indeed show major gene flows from outside into India within the last 4000 to 4,500 years or so, especially R1a which now forms 17.5% of the Indian male lineage. The reason why mtDNA data behaved differently was that Bronze Age migrations were severely sex-biased.</p>

&#8220;This looks like a sign of the arrival of the first Indo- European speakers, who arose amongst the Bronze Age peoples of the grasslands north of the Caucasus, between the Black and Caspian Seas,&#8221; Silva said.<br />
They were male-dominated, mobile pastoralists who had domesticated the horse &#8211; and spoke what ultimately became Sanskrit, the language of classical Hinduism &#8211; which more than 200 years ago linguists showed is ultimately related to classical Greek and Latin, the study found.<br />

<h1><span style="color: #ff0000;">The genetics of caste</span></h1>
<p><strong>Who authored the study?</strong> Michale J. Bamshad of the Eccles Institute of Human Genetics of the University of Utah</p>
<p><strong>Excerpts from the article: </strong>“An international study led by Michale J. Bamshad of the Eccles Institute of Human Genetics of the University of Utah of caste origins has found (the findings have been reported in a recent issue of the journal Genome Research) that members of the upper castes are genetically more similar to Europeans, Western Eurasians to be specific, whereas the lower castes are more similar to Asians.”<br />
“The three different genomic regions the study has looked at include two gender-specific genes and one biparentally inherited gene. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), the DNA contained in mitochondria which are tiny organelles in each cell that generates the energy required by the cell, is exclusively derived from the mother. Similarly, the Y-chromosome, which defines the male gender in mammals, is passed on exclusively by the father.<br />
Interestingly, an analysis of the genetic variations in the markers associated with the maternally inherited mtDNA and paternally inherited Y-chromosome show strikingly different trends. Maternally inherited DNA was overall found to be more similar to Asians than to Europeans, though the similarity to Europeans increases as we go up the caste ladder. Paternally inherited DNA, on the other hand, was overall more similar to Europeans than to Asians but, unlike in the case of maternal inheritance, with no significant variation in affinity across the castes. This is intriguing, but there is a plausible explanation. Migrating Eurasian populations are likely to have been mostly males who integrated into the upper castes and took native women. Inter-caste marriage practices, while generally taboo, are occasionally allowed, in which women can marry into an upper caste and move up in the social hierarchy. However, such upward mobility is not permissible for men. The caste labels of men are thus permanent, while women, by means of their limited mobility, cause a gene flow across caste barriers. This is the reason, according to the researchers, for the differing affinities of gender-specific genes among castes to continental populations.”<br />
“Bamshad and associates examined 40 additional bi-parentally inherited genes as well, which also confirmed the results obtained from mtDNA and Y-chromosome markers that Hindu upper castes are genetically closer to Europeans. They thus conclude that Indian caste Hindus &#8220;are more likely to be of proto-Asian origin with West Eurasian admixture resulting in rank related and sex-specific differences in their genetic affinities to Asians and Europeans.&#8221;<br />

<h1><span style="color: #ff0000;">The Aryan chromosome</span></h1>
<p><strong>Article written by:</strong> Rajesh Kochhar, an honorary professor at Panjab University and a a former Fulbright Scholar.<br />
<strong>Excerpts from the article:</strong> Genetics is now in a position to act as an umpire between competing theories on the Aryan question. Earlier genetic studies dealt with mtDNA, which is transmitted by the mother; these studies pertain to much earlier periods. Since societies were male-driven and migrants would have been accompanied by very few women, studies of Y-chromosome variations which track the male line are far more important for establishing correlations with historical periods. These studies show that about 4,000 years ago, there were migrations from Central Asia into Iran and north western India. The conclusion will come as no surprise to scholars who have been examining the relevant linguistic, literary and archaeological evidence in an open-ended manner. There is, however, a very strong non-scholarly ideological dimension to ancient Indian history.<br />
Lexical and grammatical similarities between people in India and those to the country’s west have been explained by postulating the existence of Proto-Indo-Europeans (PIE) who at one time lived together and subsequently dispersed in stages. Indo-Iranians were part of this family; they are the only peoples who have left behind literature, with the Rig Veda being closer to the Zoroastrian text Avesta than to the later Vedas.<br />
As for the Indo-Iranian speakers, south central Asia became their first destination. Rivers fed by the snows of Hindu Kush and the Pamirs would have been less severely affected by the drought. Accordingly, the delta of river Murghab (Greek Margiana) and the middle plain of the river Amu (Bactria) became the home of the Indo-Iranian people.<br />
Remarkably, the post-urban Namazga VI in south Turkmenistan shows a pedestal decorated with a swastika, an absolutely new motif. The Bishkent culture in Tajikistan shows graves where the cremated remains were buried. These graves match the description given in the famous Rig Vedic death hymn (10.18).<br />
The Avesta is familiar with central Asian geography but not with the river Indus. It mentions in equivalent terms, the rivers Sarayu and Saraswati as well as the land of seven rivers, sapta-sindhvah; all these are known to the Rig Veda as well. Presumably, the same geographical feature is meant in both the texts. In sapta-sindhvah, Sindhu is used in the generic sense of a river. Later, the name was given to a specific river, the Indus. All attributes assigned to river Saraswati are transferred to the Indus in a later hymn. This suggests eastward movement of the Rig Vedic people.<br />
There were a number of Indic groups which spoke related dialects. The Rig Veda, however, was the creation of just one of them. The Indo-Iranians display interesting linguistic divides. There is an s-h divide between the Rig Vedic and the Avestan peoples: S in Rig veda becomes H in the Avesta (soma/haoma). But both use r instead of l. Later Vedic texts abound in l (rohia/lohita). Here, we have examples of an expanded catchment area for the post-Rig Vedic literature.<br />
An examination of the new material and cultural features in the post-Urban Harappan sites suggests the arrival of Indic speakers in three prominent waves. The first Indic speakers to arrive in India made their presence felt in Swat (Rig Vedic, Suvastu), and Gomal river (Rig Vedic Gomati) in Balochistan during 2,000-1,800 BCE . They do not seem to be connected with the Rig Veda. The Rig Vedic people are estimated to have arrived in India in Swat and Punjab about 1,400 BCE after a 3,00-year sojourn in south Afghanistan.<br />
After the pioneering extensive male-line related Y-chromosome studies covering vast areas, the time has now come for India-specific work. Such investigations would take ancient Indian history beyond the realm of speculation and place it on a firm footing. Kochhar is author of ‘The Vedic People’</p>

<strong>Excerpts from the article:</strong> The Aryans came from outside India. We actually have genetic evidence for that. Very clear genetic evidence from a marker that arose on the southern steppes of Russia and the Ukraine around 5,000 to 10,000 years ago. And it subsequently spread to the east and south through Central Asia reaching India. It is on the higher frequency in the Indo-European speakers, the people who claim they are descendants of the Aryans, the Hindi speakers, the Bengalis, the other groups. Then it is at a lower frequency in the Dravidians. But there is clear evidence that there was a heavy migration from the steppes down towards India.<br />

<h1><span style="color: #ff0000;">Mother of Sanskrit and related languages was spoken by Turkish farmers, says new study</span></h1>
<p><strong>Who authored the study?</strong> Quentin D.Atkinson of the University of Auckland in New Zealand</p>
<p><strong>Excerpts from the article:</strong> Ma (Hindi), mater (Latin), mutter (German), mere (French), madre (Spanish), madar (Persian), matka (Polish) &#8211; these are words from different languages but they all mean &#8216;mother&#8217;. There are many words like that common to languages from Iceland to Sri Lanka, including many (but not all) Indian languages. All these languages &#8211; about 494 in all &#8211; are clubbed together to make the Indo-European family of languages. Scientists believe that they must have had a common origin.<br />
But where? A study published in today&#8217;s Science magazine puts forward evidence that they originated in a language spoken in Anatolia, part of modern Turkey, 8000 to 9500 years ago. The language spread and changed over the millennia and exists today in these different forms.</p>
<h1><span style="color: #ff0000;">Fact check: India wasn&#8217;t the first place Sanskrit was recorded – it was Syria</span></h1>
<p><strong>Excerpts from the article:</strong> From this Central Asian homeland diverged a group of people who had now stopped speaking Proto-Indo-Iranian and were now conversing in the earliest forms of Sanskrit. Some of these people moved west towards what is now Syria and some east towards the region of the Punjab in India.<br />
These Rigvedic Sanskrit speakers usurped the throne of their employers and founded the Mitanni kingdom. While they gained a kingdom, the Mitanni soon lost their culture, adopting the local Hurrian language and religion. However, royal names, some technical words related to chariotry and of course the gods Indra, Varuna, Mitra and the Nasatyas stayed on.</p>
<p>The group that went east and later on composed the Rig Veda, we know, had better luck in preserving their culture. The language and religion they bought to the subcontinent took root. So much so that 3,500 years later, modern Indians would celebrate the language of these ancient pastoral nomads all the way out in Bangkok city.</p>

<h1><span style="color: #ff0000;">4500-year-old DNA from Rakhigarhi reveals evidence that will unsettle Hindutva nationalists</span></h1>
<p><strong>Article based on:</strong> Interview of researchers on the Rakhigarhi DNA project<br />
As the dust of the petrous bones of a 4,500-year-old skeleton from Rakhigarhi, Haryana, settles, we may have the answer to a few questions that have vexed some of the best minds in history and science &#8212; and a lot of politicians along the way:<br />
Q: Were the people of the Harappan civilisation the original source of the Sanskritic language and culture of Vedic Hinduism? A: No.<br />
Q: Do their genes survive as a significant component in India&#8217;s current population? A: Most definitely.<br />
Q: Were they closer to popular perceptions of &#8216;Aryans&#8217; or of &#8216;Dravidians&#8217;? A: Dravidians.<br />
Q: Were they more akin to the South Indians or North Indians of today? A: South Indians.<br />
This is significant because R1a1, often loosely called &#8216;the &#8216;Aryan gene&#8217;, is now understood to have originated in a population of Bronze Age pastoralists who dispersed from a homeland in the Central Asian &#8216;Pontic steppe&#8217; (the grasslands sprawling between the Black Sea and the Caspian) some 4,000 years ago. The genetic impact of their migrations has left a particularly strong and &#8216;sex-biased&#8217;, (i.e. male-driven) imprint on the populations of two geographically distant but linguistically related parts of the world: Northern India and Northern Europe.<br />
&#8220;We are not discussing R1a,&#8221; says Niraj Rai, the lead genetic researcher on the Rakhigarhi DNA project. &#8220;R1a is not there.&#8221; The admission came wrapped in some prevarication but was all the more telling given that the Rakhigarhi data presented in this paper are derived primarily from the genetic material of &#8216;I4411&#8217;, a male individual &#8212; R1a is a mutation seen only in samples of the male Y chromosome.<br />
The absence of this genetic imprint in the first genome sample of an individual from the Indus Valley culture will bolster what is already a consensus among genetic scientists, historians and philologists: that the Indus Valley culture preceded and was distinct from this population of cattle-herding, horse-rearing, chariot-driving, battle-axe-wielding, proto-Sanskrit-speaking migrants whose ancestry is most evident in high-caste North Indian communities today.<br />

<p>In the Vedas, homage is paid to Rudra in following epithets,</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 16.20-22 &#8220;&#8230;homage to the towering sword-bearer, to the Lord of thieves homage! Homage to the gliding robber&#8230;Homage to the cheat, to the arch-deceiver, to the Lord of stealers homage&#8230;to the Lord of robbers homage&#8230;to the Lord of plunderers homage&#8230;Lord of land-grabbers homage&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 7.33.1-19 “I am the &#8220;Sutrâtman, Hiranyagarbha that resides in subtle bodies and it is I that am the Virât, residing in the gross bodies. I am Brahmâ, Visnu, and Mahes&#8217;vara; I am the Brâhmâ, Vaisnavi and Raudrî S&#8217;aktis. I am the Sun, I am the Moon, I am the Stars; I am beast, birds, Chandâlas and I am the Thief, I am the cruel hunter; I am the virtuous highsouled persons and I am the female, male, and hermaphrodite. There is no doubt in this. O Mountain! Wherever there is anything, seen or heard, I always exist there, within and without, There is nothing moving or unmoving, that can exist without Me…” Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>In the Rig Veda, Varuna is described as an Asura,</p>
<p>अस्तभ्नाद दयामसुरो विश्ववेदा अमिमीत वरिमाणं पर्थिव्याः |<br />
आसीदद विश्वा भुवनानि सम्राड विश्वेत तानि वरुणस्य वरतानि ||</p>
<p>Rig Veda 8.42.1. LORD of all wealth, the Asura propped the heavens, and measured out the broad earth&#8217;s wide expanses. He, King supreme, approached all living creatures. All these are Varuṇa&#8217;s holy operations.</p>
<p>Varuna here is considered an Asura. Rig Veda 1.174.1 calls Indra as Asura, in many verses of Rig Veda, Vedic gods like Mitra, Varuna, Savitr, Agni, Pushan etc. are considered Asuras. It will require a lengthy explanation to understand this better, But it&#8217;s not possible to explain it in this article as the explanation will divert the readers to other topic, hence I will not indulge in deep analysis, It is better to have a separate article on this topic. But I will analyse this verse from Arya Samaj point of view. The belief of Arya Samaj is that Varuna, Indra, Agni etc., are all names of one and only god, where the attribute Varuna denotes &#8216;holiest of all&#8217;. But Varuna in the above verse is considered an Asura, Arya Samaji scholars has wrongfully translated the word Asura here as omnipotent. Below is Pundit Javdev Sharma&#8217;s Hindi translation,</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-7124" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/https-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2015-06-rig-.png" alt="https://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/rig-veda-8-42-1-jaydev.png?w=300" width="468" height="248" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Below Hindi translation is taken from Arya Samaj website,<br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-7125" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/https-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2015-06-rig-1-1.png" alt="https://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/rig-veda-8-42-1-aryasamaj-website.png?w=300" width="462" height="259" /></p>
<p>The meaning given by Arya Samaji scholars is contrary to the meaning given by Arya Samaj founder Swami Dayanand Saraswati who translated the word Asura as,</p>
<p>&#8220;The good and learned were also called Devaas, while the ignorant and wicked, such as dacoits (robbers), were called Asura.&#8221; Satyarth Prakash, by Swami Dayanand Saraswati, ch 8, page 264, Tr. Chiranjiva Bhardwaja</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So the Veda calls their god a dacoit, robber. Dayanand contradicted his own meanings in several places as it is normal for Arya Samajis to give their own meanings to suit their interests.</p>
<p>Vedic god Indra is referred in one verse as Mayabhir Indra which means deceitful Indra. He used to trick people by changing his forms, such as changing himself into woman among women and man among men when he sneaked into the house of Asuri Vilistenga which is discussed in another <a href="/index.php/2018/05/15/there-is-indeed-obscenity-in-vedas/" data-wpel-link="internal">article</a>. It is also stated that he used to take up the shape of a ram to steal <a href="/index.php/2014/11/20/the-theft-of-the-soma/" data-wpel-link="internal">Soma</a>. Vedic god Indra deceived his enemies to kill them. It is mentioned in Rig Veda that Indra sought the help of Vishnu to kill Vritra,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 6.20.2 Even as the power of Dyaus, to thee, O Indra, all Asura sway was by the Gods entrusted, When thou, Impetuous! leagued with Viṣṇu, slewest Vṛtra the Dragon who enclosed the waters.</p>
<p>It was Indra who started the feud with Vritra by killing his brother Trisira for no fault of his, Trisira was an ascetic who was engaged in study of Vedas so Indra was afraid that Trisira may replace him from the status of king of gods so he killed him. Vishvakarma was the father of Trisira and he was enraged over murder of his son so he performed penance and Vritra was born with a sole motive of killing Indra. Indra was scared of him and sought help of Vishnu who then hatched a plan to kill Vritra. He advised Indra to befriend Vritra and then kill him deceitfully as mentioned in Mahabharata Udyog Parva 5, Section 10. Indra used similar tactic to kill Namuchi. He befriended Namuchi and entered into a covenant with him and cunningly beheaded Namuchi.</p>
<p>Rig Veda 8.14.13 13 With waters’ foam thou torest off, Indra, the head of Namuci, Subduing all contending hosts.</p>
<p>Mahabharata 9.49 gives a brief account of how Indra deceived Namuchi and killed him. I have explained these two stories of Indra killing Vritra and Namuchi briefly in my article <a href="/index.php/2019/03/20/violence-in-hinduism/" data-wpel-link="internal">Killing Infidels in Hinduism</a>, I have only given summary here so please go to the article and read for more information.</p>
<p>In another verse the Vedic god is commanded to steal wealth of infidels like a thief,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.103.6 &#8220;To him, who is the performer of all deeds, the possessor and giver of strength, the truly powerful Lord, we offer devotional prayers. He a highwayman, snatches wealth from the godless exploiters and gives it to honest devotees.&#8221; Tr. SatyaPrakash Saraswati</p>
<p>Griffith&#8217;s translation,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.103.6 &#8220;…The Hero, watching like a thief in ambush, goes parting the possessions of the godless.&#8221; Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hindu god Vishnu is said to practice deception.</p>
<p>Gita 10.36 “I am also the gambling of cheats, and of the splendid I am the splendor. I am victory, I am adventure, and I am the strength of the strong.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Swami Prabhupada comments on this verse,</p>
<p>“There are many kinds of cheaters all over the universe. Of all cheating processes, gambling stands supreme and therefore represents Kṛṣṇa. As the Supreme, Kṛṣṇa can be more deceitful than any mere man. If Kṛṣṇa chooses to deceive a person, no one can surpass Him in His deceit. His greatness is not simply one-sided – it is all-sided…” <strong>Swami Prabhupada on Gita 10.36</strong> <a href="http://www.vedabase.com/en/bg/10/36" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">http://www.vedabase.com/en/bg/10/36<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>It is mentioned in Brahmanda Purana,</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana 2.3.24.6 Lord Vishnu the most excellent among all persons is reputed to be a Mayavi.</p>
<p>Maya, Mayinam, Mayavi means fraud, deception, illusion.</p>
<p>Narada Purana II.52.55 &#8220;&#8230;Mayavin one who has Maya (deception).&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>

[Rig Veda Samhita, page 439, Vol II, by Svami Satya Prakash Saraswati and Satyakam Vidyalankar, Published by Veda Pratishthana 1977, New Delhi]
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So Hindu god Vishnu is &#8216;reputed&#8217; of being a Mayavi (fraud).</p>
<p>This kind of deception was practised by Asuras also,</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana 1.2.36.209b-212a &#8220;It is heard that the Earth was once again milked by the Asuras with an iron vessel and the all round yield was the power of Maya (deception, illusion). Virocana, the extremely famous son of Prahlada, was the calf unto them. Rtvikdvimurdha (?) the son of Diti was their milkman. With the (different types of) Maya for their milky yield all the Asuras became Mayavins (experts in making use of Maya). Those persons of great virility sustain themselves by means of Maya. That is their great source of strength.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is mentioned in Shiva Purana that Shiva used deception to behead his innocent son Ganesh who was only obeying his mother Parvati&#8217;s command. Shiva was helped by Mayavi Vishnu,</p>
<p>Shiva Purana Rudra Samhita 4, Kumarakhanda IV, 16.7-8 O sage, after fighting for a long time along with the army and seeing him terrific, even Siva was greatly surprised. Thinking within himself &#8221;He has to be killed only by deception and not otherwise&#8221; he stayed in the midst of the army. [11-12] Then Ganesa the heroic son of Sakti following the course of heroes, at first worshipped (i.e., struck) Visnu with his staff, Visnu who confers happiness to all. &#8221;I shall cause him delusion. Then let him be killed by you, O lord. Without deception he cannot be killed. He is of Tamasika nature and inaccessible.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the Rig Veda, Vedic gods are said to use deceit (Maya). Ashvina is said to use deceit in Rig Veda 5.78.5. In Rig Veda 5.63.4 Mitr-Varun used Maya. In many verses Indra is also said to use deceit (Maya), it is mentioned in Rig Veda,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.11.7 &#8220;Indra, thou didst kill by stratagem, the wily Sushna; the intelligent know thy (greatness); multiply their food.&#8221; Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Shri Ram Sharma&#8217;s Hindi translation</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-7131" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/https-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2015-06-rig-1-3.png" alt="https://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/rig-veda-1-11-7.png?w=300" width="525" height="70" /></p>

<p>Indra calls himself the master of Maya (fraud) in Bhagavad Purana,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 8.11.3-4 &#8220;&#8230;Indra the wielder of Vajra, spoke to him as follows: Just as a roguish conjuror makes gullible persons as if blind folded by his conjuring tricks (and incantations) and robs them of their money, you desire to conquer us, the masters of such Mayas (black magic and illusory tricks) with your Maya, Oh fool.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is mentioned in Devi Bhagavatam,</p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 6.7.18-40 …O King! Everywhere then there was this gossip in the assemblages of the gods, in their gardens, at the meetings of the Gandharbas that Indra had deceived Vritra who had relied on him, on the words of the Munis and then killed him by pretext, and so had done, indeed, a horrible crime…</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the Devi Bhagavatam, god calls himself as thief,</p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 7.33.1-19 “I am the &#8220;Sutrâtman, Hiranyagarbha that resides in subtle bodies and it is I that am the Virât, residing in the gross bodies. I am Brahmâ, Visnu, and Mahes&#8217;vara; I am  the Brâhmâ, Vaisnavi and Raudrî S&#8217;aktis. I am the Sun, I am the Moon, I am the Stars; I am  beast, birds, Chandâlas and I am the Thief, I am the cruel hunter; I am the virtuous highsouled persons and I am the female, male, and hermaphrodite. There is no doubt in this. O  Mountain! Wherever there is anything, seen or heard, I always exist there, within and without, There is nothing moving or unmoving, that can exist without Me…” Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>It is mentioned in Bhagavad Purana,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 1.9.18 &#8220;This venerable Lord is veritable Narayana the Primeval Man who deluding the world with his power called Maya (illusion) moves incognito among the Vrsnis.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Varaha Purana says that god will create a scripture to delude people in Kali Yuga,</p>
<p>Varaha Purana 71.54-55 This Samhita was named Nissvasa, and Babhravya and Sandila were absorbed in it. Deluded by me, people out of selfish motives, will promulgate their own sastras in Kaliyuga.</p>
<p>Many verses of Bhagvad Purana praises Krishna of using Maya (deception, fraud, illusion). Not just that Hinduism also says that gods reincarnated themselves as Buddha to deceive people into following the wrong way called Buddhism, If time permits me I will give you more detail but let me show you a glimpse,</p>
<p>Padma Purana 6.236.7 O goddess, in the age of Kali, I will appear in the form of a brahmana to preach the false doctrine of Mayavada which is simply covered Buddhism.<br />
Agni Puran chapter 16 shows Buddha’s followers as Daityas (Demons) who will make people leave Vedic religion. Also read <a href="/index.php/2014/05/14/lying-in-hinduism/" data-wpel-link="internal">Lying in Hinduism</a>.</p>

<p>By by K. E. Eduljee</p>

<p><span id="more-4742"></span></p>
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Aryans of the Avesta and Rig Veda</p>
<p>The Indo-Iranian group whose members composed the Zoroastrian scriptures, the <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/overview/index.htm#texts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Avesta<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, and the Hindu scriptures such as the <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/aryans/religion.htm#vedas" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Vedas<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, called themselves <strong>Aryans</strong> (Airya/Airyan in the Avesta and Arya/Aryan in the Vedas).</p>
<p>The Zoroastrian and Hindu scriptures are the only known ancient texts that contain references to Aryans. Of these two sources, the Avesta contains the preponderance of references to being Aryan, a concept central to the Avesta and Zoroastrian heritage.</p>
<p>The next contemporaneous references are in the inscriptions of the Achaemenian Persians (see <a href="http://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/achaemenian/page2.htm#lineage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Achaemenian History<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> as well as our page on <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/naqsherustam/page2.htm#inscription" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Naqsh-e Rustam<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>), and classical Greek texts such as those of <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/achaemenian/index.htm#aryans" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Herodotus and Strabo<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> [Aria, Arioi, Ariane etc.], where the the references are exclusively regarding the <a href="http://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/medians/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Medes&#8217;<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> and <a href="http://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/achaemenian/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Persians&#8217;<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>ancestry and their Central Asian connections.</p>
<p>Similarity in Avestan &amp; Rig Vedic Languages</p>
<p>The languages of the two scriptures, the Zoroastrian Avesta and Hindu Rig Veda, are similar but not identical, indicating that at the time of their composition, the people of the Avesta and the Rig Veda were related and close neighbours &#8211; in a fashion similar to two provinces within one country &#8211; provinces where the people spoke two dialects of the same language.</p>
<p>The following is an example of the closeness of the Avestan Old Iranian and Rig-Vedic (Sanskrit) languages:<br />
<strong>Old Iranian/Avestan</strong>: aevo pantao yo ashahe, vispe anyaesham apantam (Yasna 72.11)<br />
<strong>Old Indian/Rig Vedic</strong>: abade pantha he ashae, visha anyaesham apantham<br />
<strong>Translation</strong>: the one path is that of Asha, all others are not-paths.<br />
[The Rig-Vedic translation of the Avestan was provided to this writer by Dr. Satyan Banerjee.]
<p>For further information, please see the <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/languages/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Avestan Languages page<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>.</p>
<p>Aryan Homeland</p>
<p>At the time the earliest sections of the Avesta and Rig Veda were composed, the Aryans were residents of the Aryan lands or Aryan nation, called <strong>Airyana Vaeja</strong> or <strong>Airyanam Dakhyunam</strong> in the Avesta and <strong>Arya Varta</strong>in the Hindu scriptures. In the Avestan and Hindu texts, <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/aryans/airyanavaeja.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Airyana Vaeja<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> or Arya Varta was a beautiful but mysterious mountainous land (see <a href="http://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/aryans/location.htm#shambhala" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Airyana Vaeja as Paradise<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>). While the precise location of the original Aryan homeland is lost to us, we have been left with ample clues which allow us to draw reasonable conclusions about its likely location, the mountain regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>We further discuss the possible location of Airyana Vaeja in our <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/aryans/location.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Aryan Homeland Location page<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. Airyana Vaeja and the other nations of the Avesta are further referenced and listed in the <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/aryans/airyanavaeja.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Aryan Homeland in Scripture page<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>.</p>
<p>The name Airyana Vaeja was contracted over the years to Airan Vej, Iran Vej (in Middle Persian texts) and finally to Iran.</p>
<p>The two Indo-Iranian Aryan groups eventually ceased to be close neighbours. They separated and migrated to present day India and Iran, becoming Indians and Iranians in the process.</p>
<p>Therefore, as an added definition, the Aryans were those members of the Indo-Iranian family who originated in Airyana Vaeja or Arya Varta, the Aryan homeland.</p>
<p>Reasons for Aryan Migration</p>
<p>The reasons for the migration of the Aryans are discussed in the <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/aryans/airyanavaeja.htm#migration" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Aryan Homeland in Scripture page<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. The reasons for the separation of the two Aryan groups could have been a widening difference in their religious beliefs &#8211; beliefs that were antithetical to one another, but beliefs that nevertheless shared common roots. The separation is discussed further in the page on <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/aryans/religion.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Aryan Religions<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. Climate change and a degradation of the food production capability of the original homeland could also have been a reason or an added reason.</p>
<p>Aryan History</p>
<p>The history of the Aryans is found in the scriptures of the original Aryans, the Avesta, the Vedas, supporting religious texts, and the legends as well &#8211; legends such as the <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/shahnameh/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Shahnameh of Ferdowsi<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>.

<p>The early history of Zoroastrianism is closely intertwined with the history of the Aryans &#8211; a history we examine in some detail starting with our page on the <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/aryans/prehistory.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Prehistory of the Aryans<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>.</p>

<p>Prehistory of the Aryans</p>
<p>We find the prehistory of the <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/aryans/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Aryans<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> recorded in the Zoroastrian scriptures, the <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/overview/index.htm#texts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Avesta<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> (in particular the <a href="http://www.avesta.org/ka/yt19sbe.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Zamyad Yasht 19<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>), in Middle Persian texts, in the poet Ferdowsi&#8217;s epic, the <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/shahnameh/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right"><em>Shahnameh</em><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> or <em>Book of Kings</em>, and in the Hindu Scriptures, the <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/aryans/religion.htm#vedas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Vedas<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>.</p>
<p>The significance of the prehistory contained in these texts, is not necessarily a sense of recorded time, but rather a record of sequential human development that is unique amongst existing ancient literature. Unlike other ancient myths and legends, the individual reign of a legendary Aryan king, at times thousands of years in length, includes developments that correspond to archaeological / historical ages such as the Stone and Metal Ages. For instance, the developments during the reign of the first Aryan king, Gaya Maretan (see below) parallels what archaeologists and historians now call the Stone Ages. Therefore we can refer to the legendary reign of Gaya Maretan as the Stone Age of Aryan history.</p>
<p>It would be unreasonable to expect the prehistory to contain a detailed record of individual kings from the dawn of history. The names of the kings that were preserved by legend, were in all likelihood those whose reigns were noteworthy in some fashion, and the length of their reigns would have been expanded to include that of their less noteworthy predecessors and successors. As a consequence, the length of a legendary reign often spans the length of several human lifetimes.</p>
<p>In addition to a being a sequential record of human development, Zoroastrian texts also provide us with a sequential listing of early nations associated with the Aryans. Together with archaeological records, this information can be combined to construct a history of the Aryans.</p>
<p>Aryan Stone Age</p>
<p><a id="post-6917-gayamaretan"></a> Age of Gaya Maretan</p>
[Gaya means life and maretan means mortal. In some sources, Gaya Maretan is the first mortal or human being. The name Gaya Maretan evolved to Gayomard (Pahlavi), and then Kayomars or Kaiumars (Persian).]
<p>Ferdowsi&#8217;s <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/shahnameh/page03.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right"><em>Shahnameh</em><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, complemented by the <a href="http://www.avesta.org/ka/yt13sbe.htm#v85" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Farvardin Yasht 13.87<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, recounts that Aryan prehistory started with <strong>Gaya Maretan</strong>, founder of the Aryan nation. The Shahnameh states that he was the first Aryan King and that during his reign, people lived in the mountains (also see Aryan homeland location: <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/aryans/location.htm#mountains" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Mountains &#8211; Hara Berezaiti<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>) and wore animal skins and leaves. They gathered fruits and other plant foods. Animals were first domesticated, and the herding of cattle began.</p>
<p>During the age of Gaya Maretan, religion and religious rites were developed. According to the <em>Avesta </em>and the <em>Shahnameh</em>, Gaya Maretan was a Mazdayasni, a worshipper of Mazda or God. In the oldest Hindu scriptures, the <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/aryans/religion.htm#vedas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Rig Veda<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, worship in a supreme God, Asura Varuna, preceded deva or polytheistic worship amongst the Aryans. (For further information on Pre-Zoroastrian Aryan religious practices, see our page on <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/aryans/religion.htm#prezoroastrianreligions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Aryan Religions<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>.)</p>
<p>The <em>Shahnameh </em>tells us that Ahriman, the leader of the deva worshippers was envious of Gaya Maretan and wanted to seize Gaya Maretan&#8217;s throne, the throne of the Aryans. As a result, the first religious wars between the <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/aryans/religion.htm#mazdaworship" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Mazda <span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>and <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/aryans/religion.htm#daevaworship" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">deva worshippers<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> took place during this period. At first the deva worshippers were victorious in a battle in which Gaya Maretan&#8217;s son Siyamak was killed. Gaya Maretan regrouped, assembled an army under the command of his grandson <strong>Haoshyangha</strong> (<strong>Hushang</strong> &#8211; <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/aryans/prehistory.htm#hushang" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">see below<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>), and defeated the deva worshippers. While this second battle established the Mazdayasni as the dominant religious group between the Mazda and deva worshippers, the two groups continued to live together in close proximity. (Later, at the end of the <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/aryans/prehistory.htm#jamshid" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Jamshidi<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> / Yima era, dominance would shift to the deva worshippers (<a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/aryans/prehistory.htm#vedas" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">see below<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>), after which it would move back and forth between the two groups.)</p>
<p>Implicit in the references to ancient Aryans in the literature, is the development and establishment of national governance through the establishment of a hereditary kingship and a royal line. In this system of governance, Aryan kings had a sacred responsibility to protect the people, establish and uphold the law, encourage human development and lead the progress of society to a better life. When Aryan kings maintained this sacred trust and ethical compact (what in modern days we call a social contract), they were said to rule in grace in keeping with their <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/overview/index.htm#khvarenah" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">khvarenah<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>.</p>
<p>Aryan Metal Age</p>
<p>Pishdadian Era</p>
<p><a id="post-6917-hushang"></a> Age of Hushang</p>
<p>Civilization came to the Aryan world during the age of <a id="post-6917-haoshyangha"></a><strong>Haoshyangha</strong> (<strong>Hushang</strong>), Gaya Maretan&#8217;s grandson.</p>
<p>Some texts state that Hushang was the first Aryan king. In any event, Hushang developed governance according to the rule of law and as a result he was called <strong>paradhata</strong> (first law giver). The title paradhata evolved to <strong>peshdat</strong> and then <strong>pishdad</strong>, a title that became the name given to the dynasty started by Hushang. Allied to the rule of law was the concept of common justice.</p>
<p>During the Age of Hushang, the Aryans developed agriculture and furthered the domestication of animals and &#8211; two elements essential for the development of settled, civilized societies.</p>
<p>The domestication of animals that had started with the herding of cattle during the Age of Gaya Maretan, now developed to include animal husbandry and the domestication of horses, ass and sheep. The domesticated animals were used for ploughing, as beasts of burden, for transportation, and for the making of dairy products. The animal and dairy products were used to pay taxes &#8211; and taxation was born.</p>
<p>To support agriculture, the Aryans during the age of Hushang dug irrigation canals and ducts. They learnt to bake bread as well.</p>
<p>Discovery of Fire-Making</p>
<p>Jashne Sadeh / Festival of the Hundredth Day</p>
<p>The Hushang Age also saw the discovery of how to make fire. This discovery is celebrated annually by people of Iranian (Persian) descent at the <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/worship/fire.htm#sadeh" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Jashne Sadeh<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, meaning the festival of the hundredth day. <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/calendar/page2.htm#g5" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Yazdi Zoroastrians<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> celebrate Sadeh 100 days before the New Year&#8217;s day (<a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/nowruz/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Nowruz<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>), while <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/calendar/page2.htm#sk" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Kermani Zoroastrians<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>celebrate the festival 100 days after the Ayathrem <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/gahambar/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">gahambar<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. (For further details, please see our page on <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/worship/fire.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Fire<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>.)</p>
<p>The discovery of fire also led to the extraction metal from ore. According to legend, during this era, people acquired the skills of blacksmithing, crafting axes, saws and mattocks (a tool like a pickaxe with one end of its blade flattened at right angles to its handle and used for loosening soil and cutting through roots.)</p>
<p>The Age of Hushang was therefore the start of the Metal Age in Aryan history. However, unlike other metal ages which started with the processing of copper, <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/aryans/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Aryan<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> and <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/saka/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Saka<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> legends place the use of gold before the use of copper in Central Asia &#8211; possibly even a few thousand years earlier. In Central Asia, gold was the more readily available and accessible metal. The Shahnameh of Ferdowsi states that gold was used in ancient times to make surgical knives used to perform Caesarean operations.</p>
<p>The Age of Hushang was also the start of the agricultural age and the age during which the Aryans began to establish an international <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/aryans/trade.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">trade<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> network. In general, it was the start of the age of civilization.</p>
<p>Age of Tahmuras</p>
<p>Haoshyangha was succeeded by his son <strong>Tahmuras</strong> during whose reign, the art of shearing sheep, weaving and the making of clothes and draperies were developed. The reared animals were fed barley, grass, and hay, indicating that rather than leaving reared animals to graze in pasture, the animals were fed a diet that increased their strength and productivity. As a result, the horses became strong and swift. Fowl and other birds were added to the list of reared animal. Falconry and the taming of hawks were also developed during this age. The law of the land developed to include laws that required the animals be reared with kindness. These are probably the first records of animal humane laws in history.</p>
<p>Art too developed under the patronage of the king.</p>
<p>During the age of Tahmuras, the deva worshippers rose in rebellion, a rebellion that was put down. As part of the agreement to spare their lives, the deva-worshippers taught Tahmuras thirty different alphabets from different nations to east, west and south, thus teaching him the science of delineating sounds. From this account, it would appear that the deva-worshippers were the original travellers who had knowledge of the lands of China, Asia Minor, Arabia, Sogdiana and other neighbouring states. <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/aryans/trade.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Aryan international trade<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>would have been firmly established during the age of Tahmuras.</p>
<p>To the structure of Aryan governance, Tahmuras added a prime minister charged with the administration of justice.</p>
<p>Age of Jamshid</p>
<p><a id="post-6917-yimayama"></a> The Name Yima and Yama in the Avesta and Vedas</p>
<p>In the Avesta, Jamshid is called Yima-Srira or <strong>Yima Khshaeta</strong>, meaning Yima the radiant, son of Vivanghat. In an Old Persian tablet found at Persepolis, he is called Yama-kshedda, and eventually in Middle Persian Pahlavi, his name is transformed to Jam-sheed (to this day, the Parsees of India continue this penchant for converting the Y sound to a J sound). In the Vedas, he is called Yama, son of Vivasvant.</p>
<p>The Avestan references to Yima are found in Vendidad Fargard 2, Gatha 32.8, Yasna 9.4-5, Avan Yasht 5.25-6, Ram Yasht 15.15-6, Ashishvangh Yasht 17.28-31 and Jamyad Yasht 19.30-44.</p>
<p>While in the Avesta, Gaya Maretan is the first mortal, in the Rig Veda, Yama is the first mortal. This might indicate that for the Avestan people history started with Gaya Maretan, while for the people of the Rig Veda, their history as a people &#8211; as an identifiable or sovereign group &#8211; started with Yama. The Avesta and Vedas start to share prehistory with Yima / Yama.</p>
<p>Start of the Tragic Aryan Epic Cycles</p>
<p>In the legends, the legendary king who follows Tahmuras is Yima Khshaeta (later called Jamshid). As we have done previously, in an effort to extract historical developments from the myths and legends, we will say that the Jamshedi age followed the age of Tahmuras.</p>
<p>During the Jamshidi age (the age of Yima), the rule of law &#8211; a law grounded in grace and justice &#8211; developed and heralded a golden age during which time Airyana Vaeja, the Aryan homeland, became a paradise on earth. In legend, Jamshid is considered one of the wisest and greatest kings ever, but one who would nevertheless fell from grace, thus heralding the start of tragic epic cycles in Aryan history, cycles that rotated between good and evil times. (For a further discussion on this golden era, please see our section on <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/aryans/location.htm#shambhala" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Airyana Vaeja as paradise<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> in our page on the possible <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/aryans/location.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">location<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> of Airyana Vaeja.) Regrettably, subsequent monarchs did not learn from past errors and declines, dooming themselves and the Aryan nation to repeat the tragic epic cycle.</p>
<p>Since the Jamshedi age in legend lasted for over one thousand two hundred years, it would be unrealistic to expect this to be an accurate time period. Rather, it could indicate a long period of history that may have spanned several dynasties. Within this age, an early king, perhaps an eponymous Yima, would have ushered in a golden era &#8211; one that was sustained by subsequent Jamshedi age kings who may have continued presiding over significant societal change for the better. However, later kings might have become arrogant and complacent.</p>
<p>We have examples of this scenario is later times where is have more historical information. For instance, in the last of the tragic epic cycles &#8211; the age of the Persian kings &#8211; we have historical records of an age that lasted about a thousand years from the <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/history/timelines.htm#achaemenian" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Achaemenians<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> to the <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/history/timelines.htm#sassanian" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Sassanians<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> (about the same span of time as the Jamshidi age). During the Persian age, there was a golden era brought on by the rule of Cyrus the Great. Later, there came a time when the kings became arrogant. The dissention from within weakened the Persian Empire making it vulnerable to foreign aggression. Ultimately, what followed was the destruction of a historic civilization.</p>
<p>Zoroastrians need to pay heed to the lessons of history, least those who have sacrificed so much to preserve these legends have done so in vain. History has been kind to Zoroastrians when they gained grace, but cruel and unforgiving when Zoroastrian leaders lost their grace. Arrogance, internal bickering, dissension and a loss of fundamental ethical principles are some of the symptoms of a fall from grace.</p>
<p>Metal Age Developments</p>
<p>During the Jamshidi age, iron was used to manufacture helmets, chain-mail tunics, breastplates, and coats of armour both for man and horse. Weaving was developed to a high art and included silk, cotton, and animal hair to produced finely woven and brocaded fabrics.</p>
<p>Calendar, Nowruz and Weather</p>
<p>The age saw the establishment of a calendar with the spring equinox being set as New Year&#8217;s day &#8211; <a href="http://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/nowruz/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Nowruz<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. Holidays were promulgated and music began to be composed.</p>
<p>At the outset of the Jamshedi era, the weather in the Aryan homeland, <a href="http://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/aryans/page2.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Airyana Vaeja<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> was fair and equitable, with the spring equinox heralding the start of spring and a renewal after the winter.</p>
<p>However, a thousand two hundred years after the start of the Jamshedi era, there was a sudden climate chill (<a href="http://www.avesta.org/vendidad/vd2sbe.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Vendidad 2.22-25<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>) and a drastic cooling (<a href="http://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/aryans/location.htm#jamshid" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">also see Aryans, page 3<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>) &#8211; a mini Ice Age of sorts.</p>
<p>Knowledge of Central Asia&#8217;s climate and climate changes during the past 12,000 years can assist in an understanding of the historical periods in Central Asia. For instance, in an event called the <a href="http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/res/pi/arch/examples.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" data-wpel-link="external">Younger Dryas<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, the earth is known to have experienced a sudden cooling starting 12,800 years from the present, with the cooling lasting about 1,200 years. In addition, there is evidence of more recent and shorter cooling spells of, say, 100 years. Different regions could have experienced different degrees of change and a severe cooling event could also have been regional rather than global. If the location of Airyana Vaeja was an area like the Pamirs, a 5<sup>0</sup> to 10<sup>0</sup>C drop in average temperatures would have been sufficient to make winter life very harsh (Vendidad, a book of the Zoroastrian scriptures, chapter <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/outsidepages/avestaorg/vendidad_trans.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">1.2 and 2.22<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>). We are informed by the Avesta, that after the change in climate, the warm months (the <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/calendar/page2.htm#r" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">rapithwan<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> months) in Airyana Vaeja were shortened from the normal seven months to two months in duration (Vendidad 1.3, notes in Vendidad Sada and Bundahishn 25 &#8211; the warm months being those when the ground waters are cooler than the surface).</p>
<p>The Vara Settlement</p>
<p>The sudden cooling and the onset of severe winters required the construction of a new kind of settlement and dwellings called a <strong>vara</strong> (Avestan Vendidad, a book of the Zoroastrian scriptures, <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/outsidepages/avestaorg/vendidad_trans.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">chapter 2.25<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> &#8211; part of Zoroastrian scriptures). Vara is both the name of a settlement and the dwellings that made up the settlement (from vara, enclosure).</p>
<p>The concept of the vara enabled sustainable living for a people and their live-stock in a mountainous region beset with harsh winters. Surviving severe winters without migrating to warmer regions must have been an incredible challenge and a profound development for the people of those days.</p>
<p>If we put the mythological aspects of the legend aside, the description of the vara in the Vendidad indicates the start of settlement / urban planning in Aryan history. The Jamshidi concept was for the vara to be a self-contained, self-sustaining communal dwelling area built according to a set of uniform principles. There were to be separate areas for humans and animals, as well as for seed and hay storage. Fruit trees and crops were to be planted within the vara area. Water for the inhabitants and crops was to be brought to the vara via a channel and stored in a reservoir. Designated festivals also included a sharing of food resources. In addition, during the Jamshidi era, clay began to be used as a building and construction material for the first time. The houses of the vara were to be constructed using clay and wooden pillars.</p>
<p>The vara settlement was to be of three sizes: a settlement of a thousand inhabitants with nine streets, six hundred inhabitants with six streets, and three hundred inhabitants with three streets.</p>
<p>Also see the page on the <a href="http://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/tajikistan/page4.htm#jamshid" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Pamirs<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>.</p>
<p>Territorial Expansion</p>
<p>The Avesta tells us that during in the first thousand two hundred years of the Yima / Jamshedi era, the territory of <a href="http://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/aryans/airyanavaeja.htm#growth" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Airyana Vaeja expanded<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> up to four and a half times &#8220;southwards, on the way of the sun&#8221; (prior to the climate change), presumably into Afghanistan and possibly even the upper Indus valley. The people who remained in the original mountainous Aryan homeland appear to have dealt with the severe winters by staying in the varas for the entire winter, snowed in and cut off from the rest of the world, in the same manner as the <a href="http://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/tajikistan/page2.htm#yagnob" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Yagnobi<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> in Tajikistan (close to the <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/tajikistan/page3.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Pamir region<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>) live through the winter to this day (also see <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/aryans/location.htm#jamshid" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Weather Change in Airyana Vaeja During Jamshid&#8217;s Reign<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> in our pages on the Aryans).</p>
<p>Professional Guilds &amp; Initiation</p>
<p>King Jamshid developed the concept of specialized professions. He instituted the four main professional guilds of priests and learned (athravan), nobles and warriors (rathestaran), farmers (vasteryosan), and artisans (hutokhshan), with members of each profession working in freedom and dignity. Farmers had their own land free from dispute. King Jamshid also instituted the tradition of the wearing the sacred thread or belt as an mark that the wearer had been initiated into the guilds (see (<a href="http://www.avesta.org/pahlavi/saddar0.html#chap10" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Sad-dar<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> &#8211; &#8216;Hundred Doors&#8217; chapter 10, and <a href="http://www.avesta.org/mp/dd.htm#chap39" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">chapter 39.18-19, Dadestan-i Denig<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> &#8211; &#8216;Religious Decisions&#8217;).</p>
<p>The Hindu Vedas list four similar professions called <strong>varnas</strong> (from var, to enclose, cf. Av. vara meaning enclosure): the priests and learned (brahman), nobles and warriors (khshtriya), merchants and farmers (vaishyas), labourers and artisans (sudra). Each varna has its own <strong>dharma</strong> or system and rules (also called laws) which included an <a id="post-6917-initiation"></a>initiation ceremony called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upanayanam" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">upanayana<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> (meaning bringing within).</p>
<p>The Vedic name for the systems of professions, varnas, and the Avestan name for the Jamshedi settlements, varas &#8211; both from the root vara meaning enclosure is significant and bears further examination.</p>
<p>The Hindu initiation ceremony like the Zoroastrian initiation ceremony is also called a thread ceremony. Hinduism calls the initiate a<strong> dvijas</strong> meaning twice born signifying that the initiate is &#8220;born again&#8221; into spiritual life. Zoroastrianism uses the term <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/navjote/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">navjote<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> meaning new life. The Hindu initiation is conducted during a person&#8217;s teen or early adult years. The Zoroastrian age for initiation was the age or reason, deemed by tradition to be fifteen years of age.</p>
<p>Hinduism developed the professional guilds into a caste system, a development that violated principles that Zarathushtra would promote. The initiation ceremony in Hinduism is now limited to men of the first three castes, while the initiation ceremony in Zoroastrianism is available to all women and men. In Zoroastrianism, the initiation ceremony is an initiation into the faith and a coming-of-age ceremony for all Zoroastrians &#8211; rather than an initiation into a guild or caste.</p>
<p>Start of Human History in the Hindu Vedas</p>
<p>In the Vedas, human history starts with Yama and Hindu reverence for Yama, King Jamshid, grew while he lost favour with the <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/aryans/religion.htm#mazdaworship" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Mazdayasni<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> Aryan predecessors of the Zoroastrians. The Avesta tells us that the once wise, noble and honoured King Yima grew too proud, thought himself a god, and lost his place and grace &#8211; his <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/overview/index.htm#khvarenah" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">khvarenah<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. In his hymns (<a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/scriptures/index.htm#gatha" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Gatha<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> 32.8), <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/zarathushtra/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Zarathushtra<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> laments that King Jamshid lost his way and became a sinner.</p>
<p>It is within the realm of possibilities that the Jamshidi king at that time abandoned the Mazdayasni faith in favour of becoming a deva worshipper, thereby becoming the first deva-worshipping Aryan king. (For an explanation of the different Aryans religions and the schism between them, please see our page on <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/aryans/religion.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Aryan religions<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>.)</p>
<p>End of the First Tragic Aryan Epic Cycle</p>
<p>Following Jamshid&#8217;s loss of grace, the vassal kings and lords of Airyana Vaeja withdrew from the court of Jamshid and Airyana Vaeja. A hundred years later, weakened by internal dissention, Airyana Vaeja was invaded by an evil foreign king, <strong>Zahak</strong> (also spelt Zahhak and called <strong>Azi Dahaka</strong> in the Avesta). That event marked the end of the first tragic epic cycle in Aryan history and also the end of the first part of Pishdadian royal rule. The foreign domination supported by the <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/aryans/religion.htm#daevaworship" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">deva worshippers<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> lasted for a thousand years.</p>
<p>The Jamshidi loss of grace and arrogance had resulted in a nation that became weak from within and one that fell prey to conquest and domination by a foreign king for a thousand years until their liberation by <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/legendary/index.htm#faridoon" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Feridoon<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>.</p>
<p>Regrettably, the Aryans would not learn from this painful lesson in history. In eras yet to come, the Aryan nation would rise and fall with epochs of golden ages followed by despair brought about by an abdication of the ruler&#8217;s sacred trust and ethical compact to rule for the benefit of the people.</p>

<h1>Aryan Homeland In Scriptures: Aryan Homeland &amp; Neighbouring Lands in the Avesta</h1>
<p>The homeland of the Aryans was called <strong>Airyana Vaeja</strong> in the Zoroastrian scriptures, the <em>Avesta</em> and <strong>Arya Varta</strong>in the Hindu scriptures. The collection of first Aryan nations was called <strong>Airyanam Dakhyunam</strong>. Aryan lands are called <strong>Airyo Shayanem</strong>.</p>
<p>The books of the Avesta as well as the Middle Persian Pahlavi texts such as the Lesser Bundahishn, tell us that Airyana Vaeja, the Aryan homeland, was where Zarathushtra&#8217;s father lived (<a href="http://www.avesta.org/pahlavi/bund18.html#chapter20" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">20.32<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>) and where Zarathushtra first expounded his beliefs (<a href="http://www.avesta.org/pahlavi/bund29.html#chap32" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">32.3<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>).</p>
<p>In addition to mentioning Airyana Vaeja, the Zoroastrian scriptures, the books of the Avesta, also mention neighbouring nations or lands.</p>
<p>These references, along with references to the terrain and weather in Airyana Vaeja, give us clues about the location of the original Aryan homeland, as well as information about the Aryan people, their neighbours, and their relationships.</p>
<p>Earliest Mention of the Lands &#8211; Farvardin Yasht</p>
<p>Lands of Zarathushtra&#8217;s Ministry</p>
<p>A chapter of the Avesta that has the most intimate knowledge of Zarathushtra and his first followers, is the Avesta&#8217;s Farvardin Yasht &#8211; chapter 10 of the book of Yashts.</p>
<p>The Yasht (<a href="http://www.avesta.org/ka/yt13sbe.htm#section30" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">13.143 &amp; 144<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>) lists the names of individuals who were the first &#8220;hearers and teachers&#8221; of Zarathushtra&#8217;s teachings. The Yasht memorializes and reveres the fravashis (spiritual souls) of these first &#8220;hearers and teachers&#8221; of Zarathushtra&#8217;s teachings. In addition to specific names, it also memorializes all the righteous people in the five nations as well as those &#8220;all countries&#8221;. The five nations mentioned are Airyana Vaeja (called Airyanam Dakhyunam in the Yasht) as well as four neighbouring lands. These four lands neighbouring Airyana Vaeja are <strong>Tuirya</strong>, <strong>Sairima</strong>, <strong>Saini</strong> and <strong>Dahi</strong>. Since -nam is a usual ending for many Avestan nouns, the nations are also named as Airyanam, Tuiryanam, Dahinam, Sairimanam and Saininam.</p>
<p>Since the surviving texts of Zarathushtra&#8217;s teachings, the hymns of the Gathas, are in one language, we can say it is reasonable to assume that the nations in which Zarathushtra spread his message were neighbours and spoke the same language and dialect as well. For his message (which reference pre-Zoroastrian beliefs) to have relevance, these peoples also likely shared the same, or variations of the same, pre-Zoroastrian religion. We may conclude this assumption by saying the five founding Zoroastrian nations likely shared the same culture and ethnicity. In terms of size, we are left with the impression that they can be compared to districts with a province today. The Gathas of Zarathushtra are placed in the Avestan book of Yasna. While their language is the same, the dialect of the other verses is different from that of the Gathas. They were either written by followers at a different point in time or in a neighbouring region that spoke a different dialect.</p>
<p>Other than Airyana Vaeja, none of the Farvardin Yasht&#8217;s nations are mentioned in the <a href="http://heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/aryans/airyanavaeja.htm#vendidad" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Vendidad&#8217;s list of Zoroastrian nations<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. The Vendidad is a book of the Zoroastrian scriptures. Even though the Vendidad list preceded the formation of Media and Persian making it over two thousand eight hundred years old, the nations are for the most part recognizable today and we may conclude that the Vendidad list is far more modern than the list of five nations of the Farvardin Yasht cited in the paragraph above. Those nations either changed their names or became parts of other nations.</p>
<p>Dahi, for instance find mention only once in King Xerxes&#8217; list of countries that were part of the Persian empire. But in other lists and by the accounts of Greek writers such as Strabo, it was a part of the Saka nations, two of which find regular mention as part of the Persian Empire.</p>
<p>Tuirya is identified with Turan which later became known as Sugd. Dahi as a name continued to exist, Dahi being one of the Saka nations. We do not as yet known the present identity of the other lands.</p>
<p>Bakhdhi / Balkh (Bactria), which is noted in <a href="http://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/shahnameh/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Ferdowsi&#8217;s <em>Shahnameh</em><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> (see <a href="http://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/shahnameh/page30.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Shahnameh page 30<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>) and other later tradition as a land where Zarathushtra spread his message, is not mentioned in the Farvardin Yasht. However, Kava Vishtasp, Kava being a title of the Kayanian kings of Bakhdhi / Balkh, is mentioned in the Farvardin Yasht.</p>
<p>King Vishtasp of Bakhdi / Balkh</p>
<p>Among the Farvardin Yasht&#8217;s list of Zarathushtra&#8217;s first &#8220;hearers and teachers&#8221; is Kavoish Vishtaspahe (Kava Vishtasp) (<a href="http://www.avesta.org/ka/yt13sbe.htm#section25" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">13.99<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>). In the Yasht, Kava Vishtasp has a special place having a verse devoted to him. The common extrapolation is that Kava Vishtasp is the Kai Gushtasp (Gushtasp is a later form of Vishtasp) mentioned in later texts which also state that King Vishtasp&#8217;s / Gushtasp&#8217;s capital was Bakhdhi or Bakhdi, i.e. present day Balkh in Northern Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Bakhdi is listed as a nation in the Vendidad but not in the Farvardin Yasht. These later texts also tell us that Zarathushtra died in Bakhdi/Balkh, killed by a Turanian.</p>
<p>Balkh is directly south of Samarkand over an eastern spur of the Pamir mountains. The predecessors of present day Samarkand and Balkh are among the first nations listed in another (and later) book of the Avesta &#8211; the Vendidad.</p>
<p>Nations listed in the Avesta</p>
<p>In addition to the Farvardin Yasht, two other sections of the Avesta provide us with names of nations associated with the Aryans, the Vendidad and the Meher Yasht.</p>
<p>The Avestan book of <strong>Vendidad</strong> starts with a list of sixteen nations (<a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/outsidepages/avestaorg/vendidad_trans.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Chapter 1, 1-16<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>), the first being Airyanem Vaejo or Airyana Vaeja.</p>
<p>Other than the Aryan homeland Airyanem Vaeja (Airyanam Dakhyunam in the Farvardin Yasht), the Vendidad does not mention the four other lands mentioned in the Farvardin Yasht (<a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/aryans/airyanavaeja.htm#favardin" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">see above<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>). Nor does the Farvardin Yasht mention any of the fifteen other lands mentioned in the Vendidad. Three of the five Farvardin Yasht nations are not known to us. The nations of the Vendidad can be more readily identified. The only land common to both lists is the Aryan homeland. This, the other information contained, and the language used in the texts indicate to us that the Farvardin Yasht and the Vendidad were written at very different times, the Farvardin Yasht being the older. The Vendidad itself was probably composed well before 800 BCE since it does not list Persia or Media (also <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/aryans/airyanavaeja.htm#persia" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">see below<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>), making the Farvardin Yasht an ancient composition.</p>
<p>The <strong>Meher Yasht</strong> also provides names of nations in 10.13-14. Aryan lands are called Airyo Shayanem. Three of the nations mentioned in the Meher Yasht, Mourum, Haroyum and Sughdhem i.e. Margush, Aria and Suguda, are also part of the Vendidad list. Sughdhem is associated with the word Gava in the Meher Yasht.</p>
<p>Depending on whether some of the words in the Meher Yasht are names of countries, one or three additional lands are mentioned in the Meher Yasht which are not part of the Vendidad list: Khairizem (associated with Kharazem i.e. Khvarizem). Khairizem has been touted by a few authors as being the original home of Zoroastrianism. This is unlikely and Kharazem likely gained this reputation because at one time before the rise of Persia, Kharazem / Khvarizem / Khairizem was the dominant nation amongst the Aryan nations &#8211; and its lands could have expanded to include ancient Airyana Vaeja. The other two possible nations in the Meher Yasht are Aishkatem and Pourutem (some authors believe these are names of nations while others believe they are words that are part of the text).</p>
<p>The list of nations in the Vendidad is the most complete and one that provides us with information we can use in narrowing down the location of Airyana Vaeja.</p>
<p>Persia not Part of the Original Listing of Vendidad Lands</p>
<p>The Vendidad, and indeed the entire Avesta, does not mention Persia or Media. This was because Persia and Media became nations after the Avestan canon was closed. However, The Achaemenian Persian Kings (c. 700 &#8211; 330 BCE) repeatedly proclaimed their Aryan heritage.</p>

<p>*Chakhrem is used in Yasht 13.89 and means wheel (or revolving; cf. Persian charkh meaning wheel) and is used there as <em>chakhrem urvaesayata</em> in the context of Zarathushtra being the first member of every professional guild opposed to the daevas. Avestan <em>Chakhrem urvaesayata</em> is similar to the Sanskrit <em>chakhram vartay</em> and <em>chakhravartin</em> meaning &#8216;chariot over the land&#8217; or &#8216;ruler&#8217;. The western Mitanni were known for their expertise in chariot-building and this may or may not have relevance.</p>
<p>** The seven Indus Rivers, <a id="post-6917-haptahindu"></a><strong>Hapta Hindu</strong> (nation #15 above), are: 1. the Indus (Veda-Sindhu), the 2. Kabul and 3. Kurram rivers joining on the west and north banks of the Indus, and the 4. Jhelum (Veda-Vitasta), 5. Chenab (Veda-Asikni), 6. Ravi (Veda-Airovati), and 7. Sutlej/Beas (Veda-Vipasa) rivers joining the Indus&#8217; east and south banks. (There is some discussion that the Saraswati River mentioned in Hindu Vedic texts was also an Indus tributary &#8211; though this is not clear.) The Hindu texts are mainly concerned with the eastern &amp; southern tributaries while the Zoroastrian texts are concerned with the upper reaches of the Indus and all its tributaries whose valleys would have provided access to the plains &#8211; areas north and west of the Punjab (Panj-ab meaning five waters in Persian) &#8211; i.e. present-day North-West Frontier Province in Northern Pakistan, Northern Punjab and Kashmir in India and Pakistan.</p>
<p>*** Gandhara/Waihind. The land of the upper Indus basin was known as Gandhara or Waihind. Today, the region has Peshawar, Mardan, Mingora and Chitral as its main cities. It would have extended into all the habitable valleys of the south-eastern Hindu Kush. The Gandhara/Waihind region includes the Indus, Swat, Chitral and Kabul River valleys. It may have extended south to Takshashila (Taxila) (near present-day Islamabad) and present-day Jalalabad, Afghanistan, in the west, thus bordering Vaekerata (Kabul) to the east.</p>

<p><a id="post-6917-pattern"></a> Pattern in the Listing of Nations</p>
<p>There is a pattern in the listing:</p>
<p>1. The first three nations listed after Airyana Vaeja are in the southern Uzbekistan, southern Turkmenistan, northern Afghanistan area. The balance of the list of nations fan out, moving west and south in steps. The last two nations are the most southeast and west of the initial group.</p>
<p>2. The nations border one another. The nation listed next to Airyana Vaeja is Sukhdho/Sughdha &#8211; modern day Sugd in northern Tajikistan and southern Uzbekistan.</p>
<p>3. The nations are all along the Aryan Trading routes &#8211; what are now called the <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/aryans/airyanavaeja.htm#trade" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Silk Roads<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> (also see <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/tajikistan/index.htm#silk" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Tajikistan pages<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>) &#8211; an ancient set of trading roads between the Orient, the Occident and the Indian sub-continent.</p>
<p>Relationship Between Airyana Vaeja and the Other Nations of the Avesta</p>
<p>The sixteen nations listed in the Vendidad were selected by the author or authors of the Vendidad from among the nations of the known world. The list is therefore not a list of the world&#8217;s nations, but a list of nations connected with Airyana Vaeja. The Vendidad nations listed after Airyana Vaeja, are those to which Aryans migrated from Airyana Vaeja, intermingling as they did, with the peoples of those lands. While Zoroastrian-Aryans inhabited these lands, they were not necessarily the majority people in these lands.</p>
<p>All of the Vendidad nations would at some point come together as part of the larger Aryan, Iranian, or Persian empires.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Migration of the Aryans and Expansion of Aryan Lands</p>
<p>Before the era of legendary King Jamshid, see (<a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/history/prehistory.htm#jamshid" target="_parent" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Aryan Prehistory<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> and <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/aryans/location.htm#jamshid" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Location of Aryan Homeland<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>), the original Aryan homeland in the Avesta, Airyana Vaeja, could not have been very large. However, starting in the Jamshidi era and continuing up to the establishment of the <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/achaemenian/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Achaemenian<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> Persian empire under Darius the Great, the Aryan lands did grow considerably in size.</p>
<p>The Zoroastrian Avesta, the Hindu <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/aryans/index.htm#appendix" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Vedas<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> and other texts tell us that the Aryans migrated out of Airyana Vaeja and that the lands associated with the Aryans increased in size for the following reasons:</p>
<p>1. An increase in population during the Jamshidi era.<br />
2. Climate change to severe winters and short summers.<br />
3. Trading with neighbouring lands and settlement of significant populations in these lands.<br />
4. Establishment of kingdoms through settlement or conquest. A federation of these kingdoms during the Feridoon Era / Pishdadian dynasty.<br />
5. Inter-Aryan wars. The schism between the deva and Mazda worshippers cf. reign of King Vishtasp and life of Zarathushtra<br />
6. Establishment of the Persian empire that included the original federation of kingdoms as well as additional lands.</p>
<p>These points are discussed further below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the Aryans migrated to the lands of their neighbours, they did not displace the original inhabitants. When the Persian Aryans eventually settled the southern Iran plateau, the area was populated by the Elamites with whom the Persians integrated. An examination of the <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/maps/iran_linguistic.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">present linguistic composition of Iran<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> reveals that other, non Indo-Iranian linguistic groups are interspersed among Persian linguistic groups.</p>
<p>1. Jamshidi Era Expansion. Growth of Airyana Vaeja</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/scriptures/index.htm#vendidad" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Vendidad<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> tells us that in the first part of his reign, legendary King Jamshid had doubled the extent of his lands to accommodate a population increase. (The ancient Avestan name for King Jamshid was Yima-Srira or Yima-Khshaeta, meaning Yima the radiant. He was similarly called Yama in the Hindu scriptures, the <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/aryans/index.htm#appendix" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Vedas<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>.) Depending on how one interprets the texts, the expansion could have been much larger &#8211; up to four and a half times in extent. The expansion of lands was &#8220;southwards, on the way of the sun,&#8221; which could mean southward from the east to the west of Airyana Vaeja.</p>
<p>The Hindu Vedas state that the land procured by Yama (King Jamshid) became the homeland of the Hindus.</p>
<p>Gateway to the Aryan Hindu Lands</p>
<p>The Hindu Rig and Atharva Vedas state:<br />
1. Worship with oblation Yama the King, son of Vivasvat,<br />
the assembler of people,<br />
who departed from the deep to the heights,<br />
and explored the road for many.</p>
<p>2. Yama was the first who found for us the route.<br />
This home is not to be taken from us.<br />
Those who are now born,<br />
(go) by their own routes<br />
to the place whereunto our ancient forefathers emigrated.<br />
(Atharva Veda xviii.1.49 &amp; Rig Veda x.14.1)</p>
<p>&#8230;they cross by fords the mighty streams<br />
which the virtuous offerers of sacrifice pass<br />
(Atharva Veda xviii.4.7)</p>
<p>The Hindu reverence for Yama, King Jamshid, grew at the same time when he lost favour with the Mazdayasni predecessors of the Zoroastrians, who record that King Yima lost his grace, grew too proud and thought himself a god. The Vedic verses appear to state that the lands Yima acquired became part of the permanent home of the Hindus &#8211; a land that would grow to include the entire Indian subcontinent, and would become separate from the original Aryan homeland. The comment above regarding a home that &#8220;cannot be taken from us,&#8221; indicates a previous vulnerability of the predecessors of the Hindus in the original Aryan Homeland at the time the Vedas were written &#8211; a vulnerability either from foreign or internal foes.</p>
<p>It is unlikely that the expansion during the Jamshidi era included the river plains such as the lands that make up the Punjab today. Expansion into the Indus plains would take place later in history. Hapta-Hindu, the seven Indus lands that would include the plains, is the fifteenth, and last but one, nation in the Vendidad&#8217;s list of nations. The part of upper Indus occupied during the Jamshidi era would include what are today&#8217;s Eastern Afghanistan, the north of Pakistan and India &#8211; the areas on both sides i.e. just north and south of the <strong>Hindu Kush and Karakoram mountains</strong>. The limited size of the expansion is further indication that the original Aryan homeland was not very large.</p>
<p>During the Jamshidi era, the lands just north and south of the Hindu Kush and Karakoram were united. They would later separate politically and the two mountain ranges, especially the Hindu Kush formed the primary border between the two kingdoms.</p>
<p>There is yet another factor that links the upper Indus, the Hapta-Hindu with the area immediately to the north and north-west i.e. the Badakshan-Pamir region: the Rig Veda is commonly thought to have been written in the Upper Indus region, and the language of the Rig Veda and the Old Avesta are so close that they are commonly thought to be dialects such as that spoken in two neighbouring provinces and that further, they emerged from a common language philologists call Proto Indo-Iranian, another name for the language of united ancient Aryans.

<p>2. Jamshidi Era Climate Change</p>
<p>The Vendidad and other texts also inform us that at the outset of the Jamshedi era, the weather in the Aryan homeland, Airyana Vaeja was fair and equitable, with the spring equinox heralding the start of spring and a renewal after the winter. However, a thousand two hundred years after the start of the Jamshedi era, there was a sudden climate chill (<a href="http://www.avesta.org/vendidad/vd2sbe.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Vendidad 2.22-25<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>) and a drastic cooling (<a href="http://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/aryans/location.htm#jamshid" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">also see Location of the Aryan homeland<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>) and our page <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/history/prehistory.htm#jamshid" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Aryan Prehistory<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> &#8211; a mini Ice Age of sorts.</p>
<p>This sudden cooling could have encouraged further Aryan migration to the warmer portions of the expanded Jamshidi lands</p>

<p>The Aryans started trading between themselves in the expanded Jamshedi lands as well as with their neighbours very early in their history &#8211; during the Stone Ages. Aryan trade is closely linked to Aryan migration and the sixteen Vendidad nations. A more detailed discussion can be found on our page on <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/aryans/trade.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Aryan Trade<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>.</p>
<p>Aryan Trade Routes &#8211; the Silk Roads</p>
<p>The Aryan trade routes would come to be known as the Silk Roads. Aryan trade extended from China in the east, to Asia Minor and Mesopotamia in the west, to the Iranian plateau and the Indus valley in the south.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/sugd/sugd.htm#trade" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Sogdian Aryan trading settlements<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> have been found in China. Indeed, the earliest known manuscript of the Zoroastrian scriptures, the Avesta, written in Sogdian, has been found in <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/tajikistan/page2.htm#manuscript" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">China<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. (Also see our page on <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/tajikistan/index.htm#silk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Tajikistan<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>.)</p>
<p>The pattern of the Vendidad&#8217;s list of nations we noted above, moves from the Central Asian core, progressively west and south along the Aryan Trading (Silk) Roads into present-day Turkey and Pakistan.</p>
[After the Zoroastrians migrated to India following the Arab invasion of Iran, they revived their tradition of trading between the east and west, becoming wealthy in the process.]
<p>Trading allowed the Aryans to become familiar with, and later settle in, the lands along the Silk Road. As the Aryans established permanent trading posts in neighbouring lands, they also established settlements that became communities.</p>
<p>4. Feridoon Era Federation of Kingdoms. First Aryan Empire. Transformation to Airan</p>
<p>According to the Poet Ferdowsi&#8217;s epic, the <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/shahnameh/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Shahnameh<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, during the reign of legendary King Feridoon, the lands he ruled came to include what we know as the sixteen lands mentioned in the Vendidad. Feridoon decided to divide his sprawling empire the amongst his three sons. To his eldest son Tur, he gave the eastern lands with its capital in Turan &#8211; a nation that got its name from Tur. To his son Iraj, Feridoon gave <strong>Airan</strong> (the country that Airyana Vaeja had evolved into) and Hind (Hapta Hindu, the upper Indus lands). To his son Salm, Feridoon gave the western kingdoms. Tur, however, felt that as the eldest son he had been slighted, for the lands of Airan and Hind were the gems of the empire and the seat of its power. No sooner had Feridoon divided his kingdom between his sons, that the jealous and ambitious Tur persuaded Salm to join him in a plot to murder Iraj.</p>
<p>Within this legend is history. If we replace the Airan empire with the Airan people, this myth tells us that the Aryans had spread to present day Turkey in the west, the upper Indus valley in the south, to the borders of China in the east and the deserts of the north. Further, the wars between the different Aryan lands were internecine conflicts that punctuate Aryan history. By the time of Feridoon, the centre of the Aryan nation had move to Bakhdhi (Balkh or Bactria). (Also see our page on <a href="http://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/sugd/index.htm#relationshipairan" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Turan<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>.)</p>

<p>5. Inter Aryan Wars</p>
<p>The internecine wars mentioned above included wars between the Aryan religious groups, the Mazda-Asura worshippers and the deva worshippers. The religious groups, their beliefs and the wars are discussed in our page on <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/aryans/religion.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Aryan Religions<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>.</p>
<p>6. Persian empire</p>
<p>The Achaemenian king, Cyrus II, the Great (c. 600 to 576 &#8211; August 530 BCE), established the Persian empire and the expansion continued under the reign of Darius I, the Great (522- 486 BCE). The sixteen nations of the Vendidad made up the core of the nations that became part of the Persian empire. Indeed, it may be said that the Persians by creating the third Aryan empire, sought to unify all the Aryan lands (<a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/aryans/airyanavaeja.htm#aryana" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">see Aryana below<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>) by continuing the tradition of legendary <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/legendary/index.htm#faridoon" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">King Feridoon<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> who established the first Aryan empire, and the <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/medians/index.htm#empire" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Medes<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> who established the second Aryan empire.</p>
<p>The nations listed by Darius the Great, King of Persia on an inscription at Naqsh-e-Rustam as part of his Persian empire are: Pârsa (Persia), Mâda (Media), Ûvja (Elam), Parthava (Parthia), Haraiva (Aria), Bâxtrish (Bactria), Suguda (Sogdiana), Uvârazmish (Chorasmia), Zraka (Drangiana), Harauvatish (Arachosia), Thatagush (Sattagydia), Gadâra (Gandara), Hidush (Sind), Sakâ haumavargâ (Amyrgian Scythians), Sakâ tigraxaudâ (Scythians with pointed caps), Bâbirush (Babylonia), Athurâ (Assyria), Arabâya (Arabia), Mudrâya (Egypt), Armina (Armenia), Katpatuka (Cappadocia), Sparda (Sardis), Yauna (Ionia / Greece), Sakâ tyaiy paradraya (Scythians who are across the sea), Skudra (Skudra), Yaunâ takabarâ (petasos-wearing Ionians), Putâyâ (Libyans), Kûshiyâ (Ethiopians), Maciyâ (people of Maka), Karkâ (Carians).

<p>Greater Aryana &#8211; Classical References</p>
<p>Classical Hellenic authors such as Strabo mention the lands of <strong>Ariana</strong> or <strong>Aryana</strong> and make a distinction between the collection of kingdoms that formed Aryana and the country or kingdom of <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/aryans/location.htm#aria" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Aria<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>.</p>
<p>Strabo (2.1.31) implies that Ariana was a single national group whose members formed the different Aryan kingdoms: &#8220;Ariana is not so accurately described (as India being in the shape of a quadrilateral or rhomboid by Eratosthenes), on account of its western side being interwoven with the adjacent lands (of Persia and Media). Still it is pretty well distinguished by its three other sides, which are formed by three nearly straight lines (see following paragraph), and also by its name (Aryana, meaning land of the Aryans), which shows it to be only one nation.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the estimation of the Hellenic authors, Aryana included the larger group of Aryan kingdoms including Aria, and was bordered by the Indus river in the east (Pomponius Mela 1.12 states that &#8220;nearest to India is Ariana, then Aria&#8221;. Strabo 15.2.1 also states &#8220;Next to India is Ariana&#8221;), the sea in the south, a line from Carmania (Kerman) to the Caspian Gates in the west, and the Taurus Mountains (the chains for mountains that run west-east from Anatolia and which include the Himalayas) in the north.</p>
<p>The land of Aryana included Media, Persia, the deserts of Gedrosia and Carmania, that is, the provinces of Carmania, Gedrosia, Drangiana, Arachosia (Strabo 11.10.1 ), Aria, the Paropamisadae, Bactria (called the ornament of Ariana), Apollodorus of Artemita (Strabo 11.11.1) and Sogdiana where Zarathushtra is said to have preached Ahura Mazda&#8217;s laws &#8220;among the Arianoi&#8221; (cf. <a href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/1D*.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Diodorus 1.94.2<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>). These observations reconfirm the sixteen nations of the Vendidad as being part of the Greater Aryan nation and add to that list of nations the later more modern nations of Persia, Media, Carmania (Kerman) and Chorasmia. This Greater Ariana formed the core of the Persian Empire. Aelianus in <em>De natura animalium</em> 16.16, also mentions that there were &#8220;Indian Arianians&#8221; and there is some suggestion that control of Ariana fluctuated between Indian and Arian Arianians.</p>

<p>Strabo&#8217;s Description of Greater Aryana</p>
<p>Strabo describes the extent of Greater Aryana, a land that stretched about 2,600 km in length from present-day Ray (near Tehran, Iran) in the west to Khotan (presently in Western China), and from the Persian Gulf to the mouth of the Indus River in the south, in his <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/reference/strabo.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right"><em>Geography</em><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> as follows:</p>
<p>(Strabo 15.2.1. Translation by H. C. Hamilton &amp; W. Falconer): Next to India (the Avestan Hapta-Hindu, the upper Indus and its tributaries) is Ariana, the first portion of the country subject to the Persians, lying beyond the Indus, and the first of the higher satrapies without the Taurus (Classical Hellenic writers appear to have believed that a single mountain chain, the Taurus, ran east-west through Asia). On the north it (Ariana) is bounded by the same mountains as India (extensions of the Himalayas and mountains radiating from the Pamir knot, i.e. the Taurus), on the south by the same sea, and by the same river Indus, which separates it from India. It stretches thence towards the west as far as the line drawn from the Caspian Gates (Caspiæ Pylæ ) to Carmania, whence its figure is quadrilateral. The southern side begins from the mouths of the Indus, and from Patalene, and terminates at Carmania and the mouth of the Persian Gulf, by a promontory projecting a considerable distance to the south. It then makes a bend towards the gulf in the direction of Persia.</p>
<p>(Strabo 15.2.1. Translation by Horace Leonard Jones): After India one comes to Ariana, the first portion of the country subject to the Persians after the Indus River and of the upper satrapies situated outside the Taurus. Ariana is bounded on the south and on the north by the same sea and the same mountains as India, as also by the same river, the Indus, which flows between itself and India; and from this river it extends towards the west as far as the line drawn from the Caspian Gates to Carmania, so that its shape is quadrilateral. Now the southern side begins at the outlets of the Indus and at Patalenê, and ends at Carmania and the mouth of the Persian Gulf, where it has a promontory that projects considerably towards the south; and then it takes a bend into the gulf in the direction of Persis.</p>

[Our note: the River Indus in the upper section rises to the north-northeast, then turns to the east and eventually rises to the southeast with its headwaters in present day Tibet.</p>
[Note continued: <strong>Primary Boundary Between Aryana and Hapta Hindu</strong>. It is either the river itself or the mountains, the <strong>Hindu Kush</strong> and <strong>Karakoram</strong> on the Indus&#8217; left bank, that formed the primary boundary between ancient northern India and Aryana. The name Hindi-Kush which is the Persian word for Hindu-Killer, is significant as it implies a natural barrier to the invading Hindu during any wars between the two groups. Today these mountains form the border between present day Pakistan &amp; India on the right bank and Afghanistan, Tajikistan and Tibet on the left bank.</p>
[Note continued: Just north of the Karakoram mountains (also called Kara Kunlun with the Baltoro Muztagh and Gujerab as sub-ranges) that like the Hindu Kush, stems from the Pamirs mountains (today mainly in Tajikistan). The region south of the Karakoram, that is between the heights of the range and the Indus River is called <strong>Gilgit-Baltistan</strong>, a part of Kashmir. A narrow region north of the Karakoram and presently a part of China, is called <strong>Tash-Korgan/Tashkurgan</strong>, an autonomous Tajik populated region. The Pamiri region includes the Kunlun mountain range that forms the eastern Tajikistan border (with China), and cities east of the range and presently in China: Tashkurgan, Khotan/Hotan, and Kashgar/Kashi. The Tajik and Pamiri inhabited areas line the region north of the Karakoram and Hindu Kush and these areas were all part of Greater Aryana.</p>
[Note continued: The <strong>Takla Makan (Taklamakan) desert</strong>, nearly 1,000 km in width, would have formed the eastern border of Aryana. The Aryan Trade Roads (Silk Roads) shirted the desert to its north and south. The residents of Kashgar were known to have practiced Zoroastrianism and the ruins of a Zoroastrian temple can be found beside the ruins of an ancient fortress. Indeed, it is possible that residents of areas in western China that practice Islam today could have practiced Zoroastrianism in the past and that medieval Islamic control replaced areas of traditional Persian-Zoroastrian control. The original Indo-Iranian inhabitants of this area have to a large extent been displaced by Turkic peoples. The Shahnameh of Ferdowsi placed Chin (China) to the east of Airan and Turan (Sugd) beyond the desert.</p>

[Note continued: Strabo&#8217;s western boundary for Aryana runs north-south from the Caspian Gates (just east of present-day Tehran-Rey) to Carmania (Kerman-Hormuz). Strabo therefore considers the territory of Aryana to included all of present-day Eastern Iran, Afghanistan, Western Pakistan and Tajikistan. This is a Greater Aryana as neither the lesser Aria (present-day Herat Province, Afghanistan) nor a single satrapy of this enormous size continued to exist during Strabo&#8217;s or Achaemenian times. The territory described by Strabo includes most of the core <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/aryans/airyanavaeja.htm#vendidad" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Aryan Vendidad nations<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>.]
<p>(Strabo 15.2.1. Translation by H. C. Hamilton &amp; W. Falconer): The <strong>Arbies</strong>, who have the same name as the river Arbis (today&#8217;s Porali River, Balochistan, Pakistan), are the first inhabitants we meet with in this country (about 100 km. northwest of Karachi and 200 km west of the Indus River). They are separated by the Arbis from the next tribe, the <strong>Oritæ</strong>, and according to Nearchus, occupy a tract of sea-coast of about 1000 (200 km) stadia in length; this country also is a part of India. Next are the Oritæ, a people governed by their own laws. The voyage along the coast belonging to this people extends 1800 stadia (360 km), that along the country of the <strong>Ichthyophagi</strong> (fish-eaters &#8211; a generic name but here a Greek rendering of the ancient Persian mahi-khoran, which evolved into the modern word Makran cf. <a href="http://books.google.ca/books?id=yvNWAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA199&amp;lpg=PA199&amp;dq=Ichthyophagi+%22makran+OR&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WQxCA2pI2B&amp;sig=u4ZBsGtzxeOptC2VNvFuRVz_nOI&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=VpD1Tde1CcfWiALMs_iIBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=I" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Edward Balfour, Cyclopaedia of India<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>), who follow next, extends 7400 stadia (1500 km); that along the country of the Carmani as far as Persia, 3700 stadia. The whole number of stadia is 13,900.</p>
<p>(Strabo 15.2.1. Translation by Horace Leonard Jones): Ariana is inhabited first by the Arbies, whose name is like that of the River Arbis, which forms the boundary between them and the next tribe, the Oreitae; and the Arbies have a seaboard about one thousand stadia in length, as Nearchus says; but this too is a portion of India. Then one comes to the Oreitae, an autonomous tribe. The coasting voyage along the country of this tribe is one thousand eight hundred stadia in length, and the next, along that of the Ichthyophagi, seven thousand four hundred, and that along the country of the Carmanians as far as Persis, three thousand seven hundred, so that the total voyage is twelve thousand nine hundred stadia.</p>
<p>(Strabo 15.2.3. Translation by H. C. Hamilton &amp; W. Falconer): Above the Ichthyophagi is situated Gedrosia (Makran), a country less exposed to the heat of the sun than India, but more so than the rest of Asia.</p>
<p>(Strabo 15.2.3. Translation by Horace Leonard Jones): Above the country of the Ichthyophagi is situated Gedrosia, a country less torrid than India, but more torrid than the rest of Asia.</p>
<p>(Strabo 15.2.8. Translation by H. C. Hamilton &amp; W. Falconer): The position of the southern side of Ariana is thus situated, with reference to the sea-coast, the country of the Gedrosii (today&#8217;s Baluchistan) and the Oritæ lying near and below it (eastern Makran coast).</p>
<p>(Strabo 15.2.8. Translation by Horace Leonard Jones): Such, then, on the southern side of Ariana, is about the geographical position of the seaboard and of the lands of the Gedrosii and Oreitae, which lands are situated next above the seaboard.</p>
[Our note: While saying that the Arbis and Oreitae were the first people encountered in Ariana while leaving India, Strabo also seems to say that they are part of India and then again the Oreitae were autonomous. What we may derive is that at one point in time, Arbis and Oreitae were part of ancient Aryana. The distances: 200 km from the Indus (the Arbie, 360 km from the Oreitae coast. A further 1500 km takes us to the head of the Persian Gulf. At this point we cannot reconcile the figure of 12,900 or 13,900 stadia (2,600 km), unless the conversion to km is incorrect or the sailing between the several points undertakes various curved circuitous routes. We can think of the Arbis, Oreitae and Ichthyophagi as coastal peoples living in coastal districts pr principalities that were part of the Makran coastal region, in the provincial kingdom of Gedrosia/Balochistan, in the ancient federated kingdom or empire of Aryana.]
<p>(Strabo 15.2.8. Translation by H. C. Hamilton &amp; W. Falconer): Eratosthenes (276 &#8211; c. 195 BCE) speaks in the following manner and we cannot give a better description: &#8220;Ariana,&#8221; he says, &#8220;is bounded on the east by the Indus, on the south by the Great Sea (i.e. Arabian Sea, then considered part of the Indian Ocean), on the north by the Paropamisus and the succeeding chain of mountains (today&#8217;s Elburz in north-eastern Iran) as far as the Caspian Gates (approaching today&#8217;s Tehran i.e. north-central Iran and then a part of Media), on the west by the same limits by which the territory of the Parthians is separated from Media, and Carmania (today&#8217;s Kerman) from Parætacene (modern Isfahan?) and Persia.</p>
<p>(Strabo 15.2.8. Translation by Horace Leonard Jones): It is a large country, and even large country, and even Gedrosia reaches up into the interior as far as the Drangae, the Arachoti, and the Paropamisadae, concerning whom Eratosthenes has spoken as follows (for I am unable to give any better description). He says that Ariana is bounded on the east by the Indus River, on the south by the great sea, on the north by the Paropamisus mountain and the mountains that follow it as far as the Caspian Gates, and that its parts on the west are marked by the same boundaries by which Parthia is separated from Media and Carmania from Paraetacenê and Persis.</p>
<p>(Strabo 15.2.8 continued. Translation by H.C. Hamilton &amp; W. Falconer): The breadth of the country is the length of the Indus, reckoned from the Paropamisus as far as the mouths of that river, and amounts to 12,000, or according to others to 13,000, stadia (2,400-2,600 km. This is a fairly correct estimate of the length of the Indus and indicates the length of greater Aryana). The length, beginning from the Caspian Gates, as it is laid down in <a href="http://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/aryans/trade.htm#caravanserai" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Asiatic Stathmi<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> (a listing of the caravan stations), is estimated in two different ways: from the Caspian Gates to Alexandreia (some say Herat, but there are various cities given that name) among the Arii through Parthia is one and the same road. Then a road leads in a straight line through Bactriana, and over the pass of the mountain to Ortospana (some identify as Kabul, others as Kandahar), to the meeting of the three roads from Bactria, which is among the Paropamisadæ (today&#8217;s northern Afghanistan). The other branch (of the trade/caravan roads) turns off a little from Aria towards the south to Prophthasia (today&#8217;s Farah in east-central Afghanistan?) in Drangiana (Sistan); then the remainder leads as far as the confines of India and of the Indus (the Indus, i.e. Hapta-Hindu in the Avesta, later India, refers to the northern reaches of the seven Indus tributaries and the area accessed via today&#8217;s Khyber pass and the passes further north through the Hindu Kush and Pamirs); so that the (southern) road through the Drangæ (Drangiana &#8211; the watershed of the Helmand river, today&#8217;s west-central Afghanistan and in many old maps a part of south Aria) and the Arachoti (Arachosia, just east of Drangiana, central-eastern Afghanistan today) is longer, the whole amounting to 15,300 stadia (3,000 km). But if we deduct 1300 stadia (260 km), we shall have the remainder as the length of the country in a straight line, namely, 14,000 stadia (2,800 km.*); for the length of the coast is not much less, although some persons increase this sum by adding to the 10,000 stadia Carmania (Kerman), which is reckoned at 6000 stadia (1,200 km. in length). For they seem to reckon it either together with the gulfs, or together with the Carmanian coast within the Persian Gulf. (This appears to mean that Aryana had a long coastline, the length of which was &#8220;not much less&#8221; than the length of the greater nation, and that some include Carmania (Kerman) as part of greater Aryana.</p>
<p>(Strabo 15.2.8 continued. Translation by Horace Leonard Jones): He says that the breadth of the country is the length of the Indus from the Paropamisus mountain to the outlets, a distance of twelve thousand stadia (though some say thirteen thousand); and that its length from the Caspian Gates, as recorded in the work entitled Asiatic Stathmi, is stated in two ways: that is, as far as Alexandreia in the country of the Arii, from the Caspian Gates through the country of the Parthians, there is one and the same road; and then, from there, one road leads in a straight line through Bactriana and over the mountain pass into Ortospana to the meeting of the three roads from Bactra, which city is in the country of the Paropamisadae; whereas the other turns off slightly from Aria towards the south to Prophthasia in Drangiana, and the remainder of it leads back to the boundaries of India and to the p143Indus; so that this road which leads through the country of the Drangae and Arachoti is longer, its entire length being fifteen thousand three hundred stadia. But if one should subtract one thousand three hundred, one would have as the remainder the length of the country in a straight line, fourteen thousand stadia; for the length of the seacoast is not much less,125 although some writers increase the total, putting down, in addition to the ten thousand stadia, Carmania with six thousand more; for they obviously reckon the length either along with the gulfs or along the part of the Carmanian seacoast that is inside the Persian Gulf.</p>
[Our note: *2,800 km. This is a tremendous length. Even if we curve the road, the length exceeds the distance between today&#8217;s Tehran, Iran and Hotan/Khotan that is part of Eastern China today. Significantly, this includes Tajikistan.]
<p>(Strabo 15.2.8 continued. Translation by H.C. Hamilton &amp; W. Falconer): The name also of Ariana is extended so as to include some part of Persia, Media, and the north of Bactria and Sogdiana; for these nations speak nearly the same language.</p>
<p>(Strabo 15.2.8 continued. Translation by Horace Leonard Jones): The name of Ariana is further extended to a part of Persia and of Media, as also to the Bactrians and Sogdians on the north; for these speak approximately the same language, with but slight variations.</p>
[Our note: Ancient Ariana included parts of the more modern Persia and Media.]

<p>Airyana Vaeja&#8217;s Features</p>

<p>Sugd / Sogdiana</p>
<p>The second nation listed after Airyana Vaeja in the Vendidad, is <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/sugd/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Sukhdho / Sughdha<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> &#8211; modern day Sugd in north-western <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/tajikistan/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Tajikistan<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> and southern <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/uzbekistan/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Uzbekistan<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>.</p>
<p>Mouru / Margiana</p>
<p>The third nation listed after Airyana Vaeja in the Vendidad, is <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/merv/merv.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Mouru<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. Mouru is commonly identified with the area around modern Merv and the Murghab / Murgab river and its delta in present-day <a href="http://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/turkmenistan/merv.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Turkmenistan<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> &#8211; though this identification is by no means certain.</p>
<p>Balkh / Bactria &amp; King Vishtasp</p>
<p>The fourth Vendidad nation is <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/balkh/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Bakhdhim / Bakhdhi / Bakhdi / Balkh<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> located in Northern Afghanistan. Among the first &#8220;hearers and teachers&#8221; of Zarathushtra&#8217;s message listed in the Farvardin Yasht (<a href="http://www.avesta.org/ka/yt13sbe.htm#section25" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">13.99<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>) was King Vishtasp. Later texts state that King Vishtasp, a king of the Kayanian dynasty, was king of Bakhdhi/Balkh, and that Zarathushtra died in Bakhdhi/Balkh, killed by a Turanian. In these texts, the Amu Darya (Oxus) river formed the north-eastern border between ancient Bakhdhi and <a href="http://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/sugd/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" data-wpel-link="external">Turan (Sugd)<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. Further upstream, a portion of the Amu Darya river ran through Bakhdhi.</p>
<p>Balkh became the capital city of the Kayanian kings and ancient Airan, the successor state to Airyana Vaeja and the predecessor state to modern Iran.</p>
<p>Today, all three regions noted above claim Zarathushtra as their native son and make some claim to his legacy. The claims include the region being his birthplace, where he received his revelations, where he first propounded his religion, where he composed his message and the scriptures, and where he died. No other region makes these claims to this extent.</p>
<p>What this indicates is, that regardless of the veracity of the claims, there is a strong possibility that Zarathushtra travelled to these regions and that they were within travelling distance of Airyana Vaeja, Zarathushtra&#8217;s birthplace. By listing these nations separately from Airyana Vaeja, the Avesta&#8217;s Vendidad is probably also stating that the three lands were separate from Airyana Vaeja. Since Zoroastrian texts also tell us that Airyana Vaeja was Zarathushtra&#8217;s native home, we can surmise that while Zarathushtra could have travelled to these lands spreading his message, none of them was his native home.</p>
<p>Airyana Vaeja&#8217;s Terrain</p>
<p><a id="post-6917-landscape"></a> Landscape</p>
<p>The Meher Yasht gives us a most useful understanding of Airyana Vaeja&#8217;s location. It not only helps us to rule in certain possibilities, it helps to rule out certain lands.</p>
<p>Verses <a href="http://www.avesta.org/ka/yt10sbe.htm#v13" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">10.13-14<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> of the Meher Yasht state that the Aryan land had many mountains, valleys, and pastures (pouru vastraongho) that supported cattle (gave). It was rich in waters (afento), deep lakes (jafra varayo) and wide rivers. The land, while mountainous had alpine meadows and fertile, well-watered vales.</p>
<p>Rivers of Airyana Vaeja: Daraja and Daitya</p>
<p>Mention is made that a significant river <strong>Daraja</strong> (Darejya), on whose upper banks stood Zarathushtra&#8217;s father&#8217;s house, ran through Airyana Vaeja. Another river in Airyana Vaeja is the Ditya, also called <strong>Vanguhi Daitya</strong> in Vendidad and Daitik in Middle Persian. The Vendidad at 1.2 (see) below and at 2.20 mentions the river Vanguhi Daitya in Airyana Vaeja first as the river of Airyana Vaeja and then as the river where King Jamsheed gained communion with Ahura Mazda, God. The Aban Yasht at 5.17 also speaks of the Vanguhi Daitya in Airyana Vaeja.</p>
<p>Both rivers are mentioned as separate rivers in the Lesser Bundahishn (<a href="http://www.avesta.org/mp/bundahis.html#chap24" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">24.14 &#8211; 16<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, E. W. West in <em>Sacred Books of the East</em> Vol. 5, 1897): &#8220;14. The Daitya River is the chief of streams. 15. The Daraja river is the chief of exalted rivers, for the dwelling of the father of Zartosht was on its banks, and Zartosht was born there.&#8221; We read here that Zarathushtra (Zartosht in Middle Persian) was born on the banks of the Daraja River in Airyana Vaeja (Iran Vej in Middle Persian) upon whose banks stood his father&#8217;s house. The Lesser Bundahishn at 20.32 states, &#8220;The Daraja river is in Eranvej, on the bank (bar) of which was the dwelling of Pourushasp, the father of Zartosht (Zarathushtra).&#8221;</p>
<p>Veh Rivers</p>
<p>The Avestan word &#8216;vanghuhi&#8217; stems from &#8216;vanghu&#8217; meaning good. It is contracted to &#8216;veh&#8217; in Middle Persian. Daitya is said to relate to &#8216;law&#8217; i.e. Zarathushtra receiving revealed law from Ahura Mazda, God. In Hindu scriptures, the Daitya are a clan of Asuras.</p>
<p>The river called Vanguhi Daitya in Avestan is sometimes identified as the Veh in Middle Persian Pahlavi texts. In the Middle Persian Bundahishns, the Veh River is in turn is identified both as the Amu Darya / Oxus River as well as the Indus River. However, in the Bundahishn, the Daitya river itself that in Avestan passages is accompanied by the word Vanguhi is in the Bundahishn mentioned without the word Vanguhi or Veh. While the Bundahishns state that other rivers that otherwise have their own name are sometimes called Veh, the Bundahishns&#8217; Veh River which seems identical to today&#8217;s Amu Darya / Oxus is the only river in the Bundahishns that is not directly associated with another name. In other words in the Bundahishns, the river is only named the Veh and we are not told if it had another accompanying of associated name.</p>
<p>Regarding identification of the Veh with the Oxus / Amu Darya River, the Lesser Bundahishn at 20.22 states that &#8220;the Balkh river comes out from the <strong>Aparsen</strong> likely Gk. <strong>Paropamisus</strong>(interestingly also called the <strong>Alburz</strong> in some <a href="http://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0305440312002385-gr1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">modern maps<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. ) at the eastern end of the Hindu Kush mountain of Bamikan (likely Bamian/Bamiyan), and flows on to the Veh river.&#8221; Today, the Balkh river rises in the eastern Hindu Kush in Bamiyan province and flows north into Balkh province. Before irrigation reduced its flow, it was a tributary of the Amu Darya]. The Lesser Bundahishn at 20.22 also states that &#8220;The Teremet river flows away to the Veh river.&#8221; Teremet is identified by West as Tajikistan&#8217;s Termez today across the Amu Darya / Oxus from Balkh province. Termez would have been the gateway to the northern valley of Bakhdhi/Balkh, a valley that leads to Dushanbe, Tajikistan&#8217;s present capital.</p>
<p>*[<strong>Alburz/Elburz/Alborz mountains</strong>: (Also see <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/aryans/location.htm#mountains" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Mountains<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> below) Today, the mountains of northern Iran are called the Elburz. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alborz" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Wikipedia <span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>also reports, &#8220;As recently as the 19th century, a peak in the northernmost range in the Hindu Kush system, just south of Balkh, was recorded as Mount Elburz in British army maps.&#8221; The name Alborz is said to derive from the Avestan Hara Berezaiti or Hara-Berez, the Hara mountains. Hara-Barez became Har-borz and eventually Al-borz. As did the legendary rivers of Airyana have their source in the Hara-Bareza (meher Yasht 10.14), the Bundahishn continues the tradition of ascribing the source of the principal Veh rivers in the Alborz.]
<p>Middle Persian texts and the <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/shahnameh/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right"><em>Shahnameh</em><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> tell us that the Amu Darya or Oxus river (see map below) formed a border of ancient Bakhdi, and that the border between Airan (the later name form of Airyana Vaeja) and Turan was also the Amu Darya. The Amu Darya river runs from the Pamirs (where it is called the Panj) to the Aral Sea and today, to some extent, forms the border between four nations, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan. A portion of the Amu Darya river runs north of present day Balkh in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Regarding identification of the Veh with the Indus River, the Greater Bundahishn at 11.A.2 as translated by B. T. Anklesaria states, &#8220;The river Veh passes on in the east, goes to the land of Sind and pours into the sea in India. There they call it the river Mitran [and also call it the river Indus].&#8221; The Lesser Bundahishn translated by E. W. West, at 20.7 states, &#8220;The Mehrva River they call the Hendva River&#8230;&#8221;. Hendva would be connected to Hindu. 20.9 also states, &#8220;The Veh River passes on in the east, goes through the land of Sind, and flows to the sea in Hindustan, and they call it there the Mehra River.&#8221; We note that this river is called Hendva, Mehrava, Mehra, Mitran (Mithra/Mitra and Mehr are related words, the former being the older form which seems to be the trend in the Greater Bundahishn. The Lesser Bundahishn starts with the declaration at 20.1 that two rivers flow from the north &#8211; from the Alburz (Mountains) &#8211; and that the one towards the East is the Veh River.</p>
<p>We are therefore left with two Veh rivers, one identified with the Amu Darya (Oxus) and the other with the Mitran or Mehra (the Indus). Masudi in his Historical Encyclopaedia writes that the &#8220;Guebers (sic) i.e. Zoroastrians, felt that the Jaihun (Oxus) was connected with the Indus to form one river, the Veh.&#8221; The ancients may have perceived the Veh as a mythical circumventing river, one that circumvented Airyana in the east and the west &#8211; perhaps even all the way around.</p>
<p>Rivers Flowing into Neighbouring Countries</p>
<p>Verse 10.14 of the Avesta&#8217;s Mehr Yasht, states that the rivers which originate in Airyo shayanem*, the Aryan abode, flow swiftly into the countries of <a href="http://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/merv/gonur.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Mourum<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> [later Margu(sh) (English-Greek Margiana) and eventually Marv located in today&#8217;s Turkmenistan], <a href="http://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/aria/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Haroyum<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> (Aria in modern Afghanistan), <a href="http://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/sugd/sugd.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Sughdhem<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> (Sugd in Tajikistan and Uzbekistan) and <a href="http://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/khvarizem/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Khairizem<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> [Khvarizem beside the Amu Darya (Oxus) River in Uzbekistan].

As &#8220;abode&#8221; or &#8220;dwelling place&#8221;, the word may denote a region rather than a country, a region over which the Airya had spread by that time.]
<p>There are very few sets of rivers that meet this description and they all originate in the mountains of Afghanistan and Tajikistan radiating westward from the Pamirs. Since 1. Bakhdhi (Balkh) is a significant omission from this list, 2. Khairizem is a nation not mentioned directly in the Vendidad&#8217;s list of nations and appears to be a &#8220;younger&#8221; nation than the Vendidad nations [together with Parsa (Persia) and Mada (Media) also not mentioned], and 3. the Aryan lands are called by a slightly different name than in the Vendidad, one possibility is that this Meher Yasht description was part of the younger Avesta, by time of whose writing, the original Aryan lands, Airyana Vaeja, had begun to move westward along the northern Hindu Kush slopes, towards the Kuh-e Baba, Kuh-e Hissar and Safid Kuh &#8211; the northern Afghanistan mountain region south of Balkh. To us it is not without significance that there is a Murgab River in the Pamir highlands of Tajikistan, then in the northern Afghanistan and eventually in Pars.</p>
<p>The larger river flowing into Mourum (Eng-Gk Margiana) is the <strong>Murgab River</strong>; the main river flowing through Haroyum (Eng-Gk Aria) is the <strong>Hari-Rud River</strong>; the main river flowing through Sughdhem/Sugd (Eng-Gk Sogdiana) is the <strong>Zerafshan River</strong>. The <strong>Kashka Darya</strong> also flows through Sughdhem. Sughdhem was likely bordered by the <strong>Amu Darya (Oxus)</strong> in the west/south-west and <strong>Syr Darya (Jaxartes) Rivers</strong> in the east/north-east. There are of course, other smaller rivers. The Pamirs together with the Hindu Kush and its western extensions including the Safeed Kuh and Siah Kuh mountains that border today&#8217;s Northern Afghanistan are where these rivers originate.</p>
<p>The Lesser &amp; Greater Bundahishns at <a href="http://www.avesta.org/pahlavi/bund18.html#chapter20" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">LB Chapter 20<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> and <a href="http://www.avesta.org/mp/grb1.htm#chap11" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">GB Chapter 11.A<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> respectively provide additional information. We reproduce here portions of the Bundahishn related to the rivers of Central Asia identified above via the Meher Yasht. However, the Bundahishns only assign the rivers Daraja and Daitya to ancient Iran-Vej (Airyana Vaeja). Regardless, we still see these lands the rivers flow through as part of greater Aryan nation, Iran-Shahr:</p>
<p>LB 13. The Daitya river is the river which comes out from Eranvej, and goes out through the hill-country; of all rivers the noxious creatures in it are most, as it says, that the Daitya river is full of noxious creatures. [Our note: it is significant that the Daitya is noted as &#8220;going through hill country&#8221;.] GB 11.A.7 states &#8220;The river Daitya comes out of Eranvej and proceeds to Dutistan.&#8221; We have yet to identify Dutistan.</p>
<p>The other rivers implied by the Meher Yasht are described by the Bundahishns as follows:</p>
<p>Harirud</p>
<p>The Bundahishns make no reference to the Harirud originating in Airyana Vaeja as implied by the Meher Yasht. GB 11.A.11 &#8220;The Hari-rud flows from the Hapursen range.&#8221; LB 20.16: &#8220;The Haro river flows out from the Aparsen range (Gk. Paropamisus). The source of the Harirud is just across the Hissar range from the source of the Balkh River.&#8221; The Zend River &#8220;passing through the mountains of Panjistan&#8221; is a tributary of the Harirud.</p>
<p>Rivers of Sughdhem/Sugd</p>
<p>GB 11.A.15: &#8220;The river Khvajand goes through the middle of Samarkand and Ferghana. They call it the river Khshart/Ashart/Ashard (Jaxartes/Syr Darya).&#8221; LB 20.20: &#8220;The Khvejand river goes on through the midst of Samarkand and Pargana, and they call it also the river Ashard.&#8221; Khujand (cf. Khvajand) is currently a Tajik city beside the upper reaches of the Syr Darya (Jaxartes).</p>
<p>GB 11.A.14:&#8221;The river Zeshmund, on the side of Soghd (Sugd, Sogdiana), pours back into the river Khvajand.&#8221; LB 20.19: &#8220;The Zishmand river, in the direction of Soghd, flows away towards (from?) the Khvejand river.&#8221; These two statements are somewhat contradictory and a more critical translations of the originals is required. The river sounds like the Zerafshan. If this is so, the statement should read that the river flows away from the Khvajand (Jaxartes/Syr Darya) and into the Veh, the Amu Darya or Oxus. If not, it denotes another river, perhaps a tributary of the Khvajand.</p>
<p>Curiously, the LB at 20.30 states, &#8220;The Kasak river comes out through a ravine (kaf) in the province of Tus (the birthplace of Ferdowsi in Khorasan?), and they call it there the Kasp river; more- over, the river, which is there the Veh, they call the Kasak; even in Sind they call it the Kasak.&#8221; Translator E. W. West feels &#8220;Sind&#8221; here is a corruption or misprint of the intended name &#8220;Seni&#8221; leading the the line reading, &#8220;even in Seni they call it the Kasak.&#8221; Seni is a name mention in the Lesser Bundahishn at 15.29: &#8220;the country of Seni, that which is Kinistan/Chinistan&#8221;. E. W. West further postulates that in this context &#8220;Kinistan&#8221; may refer to Samarkand the principal city of Sugd. He goes on the identify Seni as the Saini of the <a href="http://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/aryans/airyanavaeja.htm#favardin" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Farvardin Yasht at 13.143,144<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, one of the five lands praised in the Yasht having holy followers. There is today the River Kashka that flows from Sugd today.</p>
<p>Murgab. River of Marv</p>
<p>LB 20.21. &#8220;The Marv river, a glorious river in the east, flows out from the Aparsen range (Gk. Paropamisus).&#8221; &#8220;GB 11.A.16: &#8220;The Marv-rud, the river &#8216;Full of glory,&#8217; in Khvarasan (Khorasan?), flows from the Hapursen range.&#8221; The source of the Murgab is in the vicinity of the sources of the Balkh and Harirud rivers &#8211; the eastern extremity of the Hindu Kush Mountains. The mention of the Marv-rud i.e. the Murgab being a river of Khvarasan (Khorasan?) is noteworthy.</p>
<p>Amu Darya (Oxus), Balkh and Termez Rivers</p>
<p>As we have stated earlier, the Lesser Bundahishn at 20.22 states that &#8220;the Balkh river comes out from the Aparsen (Gk. Paropamisus; interestingly also called the Alborz on some maps today) at the eastern end of the Hindu Kush] mountain of Bamikan (likely Bamian/Bamiyan), and flows on to the Veh river.&#8221; Today, the Balkh river rises in the eastern Hindu Kush in Bamiyan province and flows north into Balkh province. Before irrigation reduced its flow, it was a tributary of the Amu Darya]. GB 11.A.17 states: &#8220;The river Balkh enters the mountain Bamian [from] the Hapursen and pours into the river Veh.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Lesser Bundahishn at 20.22 also states that &#8220;The Teremet river flows away to the Veh river.&#8221; Teremet is identified by West as Tajikistan&#8217;s Termez today across the Amu Darya/Oxus from Balkh province. Termez would have been the gateway to the northern valley of Bakhdhi/Balkh, a valley that leads to Dushanbe, Tajikistan&#8217;s present capital.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.avesta.org/vendidad/vd1sbe.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right"><em>Vendidad</em> at 1.2<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> (translation by James Darmesteter, SBE, 1898) states: &#8220;The first of the good lands and countries which I, Ahura Mazda, created, was the Airyana Vaeja, by the Vanguhi Daitya. Thereupon came Angra Mainyu, who is all death, and he counter-created the serpent in the river and winter, a work of the Daevas.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Greater Bundahishn translated by B. T. Anklesaria at Chapter <a href="http://www.avesta.org/mp/grb1.htm#chap11" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">11.A.7 &amp; 8<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> states &#8220;The river Daitya comes out of Eranvej and proceeds to Dutistan. Of all the rivers, the noxious creatures abound the most in it. As one says, &#8216;The river Daitya is full of noxious creatures&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Indus on its part was known to have alligators which could perhaps have been identified as a form of snake. Captain John Wood in his <em>A Journey to the Source of the River Oxus</em>, (London) 1872, p. 10-11 describes his encounter with a herd of alligators while travelling up the lower Insus.</p>
<p>Mountains &#8211; Hara Berezaiti, the Hara Mountains</p>
<p><a id="post-6917-haraberezaiti"></a> The Mehr Yasht at 10.13 and 14 states that the Aryan abode (airyo-shayanem) was &#8220;where the high mountains (garayo berezanto), rich in pastures and waters, yield plenty to the cattle&#8221;, and that when the Sun rises above the taro (peaks &#8211; see <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/aryans/location.htm#tera" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">further discussion below<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>) of the Hara, it casts its golden rays down on the abode of the Aryans.</p>
<p>Reading the Zamyad Yasht at (<a href="http://www.avesta.org/ka/yt19sbe.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">19.1<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>) we are given the impression that the Hara was one of two concentric rings of mountains, or at least ones that &#8220;lie all around&#8221;. Many authors add &#8220;encircling the earth&#8221; or words to that effect to their translations, but there are no such words in the verse. The Yasht also states two thousand, two hundred and forty four peaks rose from these mountains and names several.</p>
<p>The Aban Yasht at 5.21 states that (King) Hushang paid homage at the &#8220;upa upabde&#8221; (sometime translated as &#8220;base&#8221; or &#8220;enclosure&#8221;. Upa means &#8220;near&#8221;. We read &#8220;near the environs&#8221;) of the Hara.</p>
<p>In Mehr Yasht 10.118, we are introduced to the term &#8220;Hara Berezaiti&#8221;. The modern word Alburz is said to be derived from Hara Berezaiti. Hara Berezaiti it is said in the literature became Hara-Barez (in Yashts 5.21 and 17.24) then Har-borz and eventually Al-borz. The word &#8220;hara&#8221; is said to mean &#8220;watch, guard, defence&#8221; and is derived from from the Old Iranian prefix har- meaning &#8220;to pay attention, watch over, protect&#8221;. The implication is that the Hara Mountains got their name since they served as a defensive wall against invaders or plunderers. Indeed, the Greater Bundahishn at 24.24 notes that every three years, people of non-Arian nations would gather on the Alburz (Hara) mountains in order to cause harm &#8211; perhaps sweeping down into the Aryan lands from ridges and passes. The word &#8220;berezaiti&#8221; is said to stem from &#8220;berez&#8221; meaning &#8220;height&#8221;, &#8220;exalted&#8221; or even &#8220;towering&#8221;. It is also said to have evolved into the New Persian words &#8220;boland&#8221; meaning &#8220;tall&#8221; or &#8220;high&#8221; and &#8220;bozorg&#8221; meaning &#8220;big&#8221; or &#8220;great&#8221;. With &#8220;berezaiti&#8221; as an adjective we are left with the impression that the Hara was a high protective barrier. The one mountain range that fits this description very well is the Hindu Kush. Hindu means resident of the (upper) Indus region and Kush is said to be the same as &#8220;kusht&#8221; meaning &#8220;kill&#8221;. The Hindu Kush is a natural barrier between the Indus and Kabul valleys (to the south) and Wakhan valley (to the north), and by extension the Badakshan/Pamir region.</p>
<p>Nowadays, Alburz/Alborz/Elburz is the name of the mountains in northern Iran. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alborz" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Wikipedia<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> also reports, &#8220;As recently as the 19th century, a peak in the northernmost range in the Hindu Kush system, just south of Balkh, was recorded as Mount Elburz in British army maps (i.e. the western arm of the Hindu Kush).&#8221; The same mountains are also called the Aparsen (likely Gk. Paropamisus) in the Bundahishn. We are also given to understand that the highest peak of the Caucasus is also called &#8220;Elbrus&#8221;. The poet Ferdowsi&#8217;s references to the Alburz in his epic, the <em>Shahnameh</em>, lead us to the environs of Hind, perhaps meaning the mountains of the Upper Indus, the Hindu Kush, Pamirs, Karakorum and Himalayas &#8211; the Alburz or Hara Berezaiti of old. Strabo would call the Hara Berezaiti the <strong>Taurus Mountains</strong>, a string of mountains that ran from Turkey to the boundaries of China.</p>
<p>The two Bundahishns, the Middle Persian or Pahlavi Zoroastrian texts, see the Alburz (Hara Berezaiti) in two ways (see Lesser Bundahishn 20.1): one the mythical mountains that encircled the earth &#8211; the primal mountain range from which all other mountain ranges arose &#8211; and two, a specific group of mountain ranges in which two rivers at east and west of the Aryan lands had their source (and according to Zadsparam at 6.21, the source of an additional &#8220;great&#8221; eighteen rivers). We see these two aspects reflected elsewhere. The Zamyad Yasht reads in a factual manner while some other passages tend to add more fantastic elements. From the Zamyad Yasht we do get the sense that other mountain ranges rise from (perhaps radiate?) from the Hara and that it could conceivably lend its name to connected mountain chains. By the time the Middle Persian Bundahishns and other texts were written, the description is almost entirely mythological as are parallel descriptions in Hindu and Buddhist texts we describe below. In mythology, the Alburz encircled the earth &#8211; a band like the Milky Way of the heavens.</p>
<p>As the mythical mountains that surrounded the earth, the Alburz mountains are similar to the <strong>Lokaloka</strong> of the Hindu scriptures. [Lokaloka means &#8220;world-no world&#8221; and is in Vedic Hindu mythology, a magnificent belt of mountains girdling the outermost of the seven lands (Phl. keshvar / Vedic dvipa) and seas and one which separates the visible world from the region of darkness beyond. The Lokaloka is said to be ten thousand yojanas in breadth and height. The modern equivalent of a yojana is disputed and is thought to be 6 to 15 kilometres making the mythical Lokaloka some 60,000 to 150,000 km. in circumference.]
<p>Tera</p>
<p>The Mehr Yasht at 10.118 talks about the Sun riding rising above the peaks (tara) of the Hara Berezaiti. Tara (also spelt Tera, Terak or Taera) is sometime taken to mean a specific mountain in the Hara. E. W. West translates the Lesser Bundahishn (LB) at 12.2 as &#8220;Terak of Alburz&#8221; i.e. Tera of the Hara Berezaiti. When West translates 12.4 as &#8220;The Terak of Alburz is that through which the stars, moon and sun pass in, and through it they come back&#8221;, but when B. T. Anklesaria translates 9.6 of the Greater Bundahishn (GB) as &#8220;The Tera of Alburz is that through which the Stars, Moon and Sun revolve and through which they come back&#8221;, it makes more sense to read Tera(k) as the peaks or the space between peaks through which the stars, moon and sun rise and set. Indeed, at LB 5.4. we have &#8220;As it is said that it is the Terak of Alburz from behind which my sun and moon and stars return again&#8221; and at LB 5.5, &#8220;For there are a hundred and eighty apertures (rojin) in the east, and a hundred and eighty in the west, through Alburz; and the sun, every day, comes in through an aperture, and goes out through an aperture&#8230;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ichaporia and Humbach as well as Sethna do not translate &#8220;taera&#8221; as the name of a mountain but rather as &#8220;peak&#8221;. However, it does make more sense in the contexts above to read it as several or a set of peaks rather than a single peak. But that sense of a single peak rising into the heavens is now embedded in Hindu and Buddhist mythology as well. In the Zamyad Yasht, there is no mythology in the description of the mountains. They are listed quite matter-of-factly and the word &#8220;taera&#8221; appears buried in the middle of verse 19.6 in a rather obscure manner.</p>
<p>Mary Boyce informs us that when the Khotanese Saka became Buddhists, they referred to Mt. Sumeru of Buddhist legends as <em>Ttaira Haraysa</em>, the peak of Hara. Mt. Sumeru in Buddhist mythology lies at the centre of the earth and according to Anklesaria&#8217;s translation of GB 5B.1, &#8220;Mount Tera is in the middle of the earth.&#8221;</p>
<p>Principal Hara Peaks &#8211; Mount Hukaria and Daitik</p>
<p>The Greater Bundahishn translated by B. T. Anklesaria (at 17.18) describes the Hukar (Huk-airya in the Avesta) as being the &#8216;chief&#8217; of the summits. Huk-airya means the &#8216;good Arya&#8217; or the &#8216;good and beneficent Arya&#8217; &#8211; the environs of which, Airyana Vaeja, was a paradise with ideal conditions: no inclement weather, natural beauty and where the people enjoyed good health. The GB at 9.3 also states that, &#8220;As the other mountains have grown out of Alburz, in number, two thousand two hundred and forty-four mountains, that are the lofty Hugar/Hukar (Huk-airya), the Tera of Alburz, the Daitih peak&#8230;.&#8221; We note that the Hugar/Hukar (Huk-airya) is described at both the chief of the mountains as well as lofty (tall &#8211; towering above others. At GB 9.7, &#8220;The lofty Hugar/Hukar (Huk-airya) is that from which the water of Aredvisur descends from the height of a thousand men.&#8221; At 9.9, &#8220;The Daitih (Chakad-i-Daitik in the Lesser Bundahishn) peak is that which is in the middle of the world, of the height of a hundred men, whereon is the Chinvad bridge; they judge the soul at that place.&#8221; Much attention is given to &#8220;Tera&#8221; being the name of a pivotal mountain at the centre of the earth, but in the Daitih we have another contender for this description. The height of a hundred men does not make it a very tall mountain and one suitable perhaps for a significant temple or sanctury (see the thangka painting below). We could have two versions of the myth, one with a very tall central mountain and the other with a shorter mountain crowned by a temple or sanctuary as depicted by the thangka painting below. Both versions appear to exist currently either explicitly or implicitly, and the shorter version appears to make more sense with reality.</p>
<p>The combined manner in which the Hukar, Tera and Daitik are described in the Bundahishn has resonance with the manner in which Mount Meru, Sumeru, is described in Hindu and Buddhist texts.</p>
<p>Mount Meru / Sumeru</p>
<p>The Hindu scriptures, the Vedas, refer to the Mount Hara as <a id="post-6917-mountmeru"></a><strong>Mount Meru</strong> or <strong>Sumeru</strong> (the Great Meru), and describe the Himalayas as stemming from Mount Meru which itself stands at the centre of the known world. The Vedas also refer to Arya Varta as Paradesha, the original country. In the Vedas, Bharatavarsha, Ancient India, lay to the south of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Meru" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Wikipedia article<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> on Jambudvipa, the environs in which Mount Meru stands, identifies Jambudvipa with the Pamir region. In the Vedas, each of the four sides of Meru are made of four different precious substances: the south of lapis-lazuli, the west of ruby, the north of gold and the east of silver (or crystal). The Pamir-Badakhshan region was noted for precisely these precious substances and home to the only known lapis mines in antiquity. Further, the <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/aryans/trade.htm#badakshanlapis" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">lapis mines<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> were in the south of the Pamir region.</p>

<p>As we have noted above, Zoroastrian texts describe Airyana Vaeja as being mountainous with fertile meadows and valleys. In addition, the opening words of the Avestan Vendidad&#8217;s chapter listing the sixteen nations, states that if God had not made other countries beautiful in some manner, all the world would have swarmed into Airyana Vaeja on account of its great beauty and &#8211; as mentioned elsewhere in the Avesta (see next paragraph) &#8211; because of its wise king and good government, law and order, noble people and serenity. Airyana Vaeja was a paradise on earth &#8211; a land of peace and serenity, the best place to live and raise a family.</p>
<p>The heavenly nature of Airyana Vaeja during the Jamshidi era (see <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/aryans/location.htm#jamshid" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Weather Change<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> below) reached mythic proportions in <a href="http://www.avesta.org/ka/yt19sbe.htm#section7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Yasht 19.33<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, the Zamyad Yasht. Then, the weather was neither cold nor hot, there was no untruth and envy, people were undying, water and plants never drying. All because King Jamshid ruled wisely and the people lived honestly. However, when the king lost his grace and the people lost their noble ways, Airyana Vaeja became a paradise lost.</p>
<p>Tibetan Buddhism&#8217;s book of Kala-Chakra, the Time-Cycle, and Tibetan Buddhism&#8217;s predecessor religion, <strong>Bon</strong>, built on and popularized this concept of a lost and hidden paradise on earth, now known to the world as Shangri-La.</p>
[The founding of the Bon religion is ascribed to Tonpa Shenrab Miwoche who was born &#8211; by some estimates 18,000 years ago &#8211; in the land of Tagzig Olmo Lung Ring. <strong>Tagzig</strong>, is believed to be a form of the name Tajik. (The name Shenrab sounds Iranian as well.) The doctrine taught by Tonpa Shenrab was spread by his disciples and their student-translators to adjacent countries such as Zhang-Zhung (also Zhangzhung, Shang Shung or Xang Xung &#8211; a land north of the Himalayas, which contained Mount Kailash in today&#8217;s Western Tibet), India (northern Indus valley), Kashmir, China and eventually Greater Tibet. Tonpa Shenrab is reputed to have visited present-day western Tibet once. On that visit he found the people unprepared to receive the entire body of his teachings, but he prophesied that his teachings would flourish in Tibet in the coming ages. The students of his disciples continued his mission and Tibetan Bon scriptures were translated from texts in the language of Zhang-Zhung.</p>
[Bon claims to have spread south to the Indian subcontinent and to have influenced the development of Vedic Hinduism. Perhaps pre-Tibetan Bon was a form of the primordial Aryan religion before Zoroastrianism and Vedic Hinduism. Buddhism in turn evolved out of Vedic Hinduism (c. 400 BCE). Completing a full circle, today&#8217;s Bon is so heavily influenced by Buddhism that it sounds like a Buddhist sect. Perhaps some scholars may take it upon themselves to try and isolate the precepts of the pre-Buddhism Bon.</p>
[It may be of interest to those studying the weather change in Airyana Vaeja, that pollen and tree ring analysis indicates the Chang Tang plateau in Northern Tibet had a far more liveable environment than it has today &#8211; one that supported a primordial civilization &#8211; until the climate become colder and drier starting around 1500 BCE, a climate change that caused the population to migrate out of the northern plateau. This authors also feels that the ancient Aryan and Zoroastrian link to western Tibet is further exemplified by the common tradition of exposing the dead to birds. Also see our blog, <a href="http://zoroastrianheritage.blogspot.com/2011/07/iranian-aryan-connections-with-western.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right"><em>Iranian-Aryan Connections with Western Tibet</em><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>.]
<p>At the centre of the land of Tagzig (called Shambhala in the Kalachakra) was Olmo Lungring which had at its centre, Yungdrung Gutsek, a four-sided mountain similar to Mount Meru / Sumeru (<a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/aryans/location.htm#meru" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">see above<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>). The mountain is surrounded by temples, cities and parks. To the mountain&#8217;s south is the Barpo Sogye palace, where Tonpa Shenrab was born. The complex of palaces, rivers and parks with Mount Yungdrung Gutseg in the centre constitutes the inner region (Nang-gling) of Olmo Lungring. The intermediate region (Bar-gling) consists of twelve cities, four of which lie in the four cardinal directions. The third region includes the outer land (mTha&#8217;-gling). These three regions are encircled by snow-capped mountains and an ocean.</p>
<p>The mountain Yungdrung Gutsek has nine Yungdrungs (swastikas) ascending like a staircase. It is not without significance that the swastika plays an important symbolic role in both the Bon and Vedic Hindu religions. In Bon, The nine swastikas represent the Nine Ways. The swastika (Yungdrung) itself is a symbol of permanence and indestructibility of the mind-stream, the wisdom of Bon. The full name of Bon is Yungdrung Bon meaning Everlasting Truth.</p>
<p>The four sides of the mountain faced the four cardinal directions. From the four corners, each of which represent four archetypal thought forms, flow four rivers:</p>
<p>&#8211; From the thought form of a snow lion flows the river Narazara to the east,<br />
&#8211; From the thought form of a horse flows the river Pakshi to the north,<br />
&#8211; From the thought form of a peacock flows the river Gyim Shang to the west, and<br />
&#8211; From the thought form of an elephant flows the river Sindhu (In Persian: Hindu which later became Indus) to the south.</p>
<p>A few concepts emerge from the description of Tagzig&#8217;s terrain within which lies the four-sided mountain, Yungdrung Gutsek. First, while our translation states the singular, a four-sided mountain, a mountain in all the related ancient Avestan, Vedic, and Bon texts frequently refers to a group or range of mountains with several peaks. For instance Hara Berezaiti contained two thousand, two hundred and forty four mountains peaks (see above). Next, from the four-sided Yungdrung Gutsek mountain(s) arose several rivers flowing in all the cardinal directions. In addition, this region was north of the northern Indus region. (Also see our section on the four-sided <a href="http://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/tajikistan/page3.htm#boundaries" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">topography of the Pamirs<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. It is unreasonable to expect the geographic descriptions in the ancient texts to align perfectly on a modern map. The ancients used approximations formulated from the accounts of travellers over several generations and good examples of this contention are the maps drawn by classical Western authors such as <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/reference/ptolemy/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Ptolemy<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>.)</p>
<p>Tibetan Buddhism&#8217;s Kalachakra uses the Hindu Vedic legend of Mount Meru (Avestan <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/aryans/location.htm#haraberezaiti" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Hara Berezaiti<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>) and surrounds Mount Meru with the mythic kingdom of <strong>Shambhala</strong>, a Sanskrit word meaning the land of peace. Shambhala, also spelt Shambala or Shamballa, is said to be the land of the Living Fire and <strong>Gyanganj</strong>, the home of immortal wisdom and the omniscient wise god of time (descriptions some use for Ahura Mazda, God, in Zoroastrianism). The concept, description and qualities of Shambala coincide with those for Arya Varta / Airyana Vaeja, the Aryan homeland, and help provide us with added information on its possible location.</p>
<p><a id="post-6917-frashokereti"></a> According to the Buddhist Kalachakra, Shambhala, presently hidden to the rest of the world, is a paradise of peace, tranquility, honesty and wisdom. It is home of the primordial and highest spiritual teachings, a tantra of the cycle of time now hidden from us but one that will eventually save the world from evil. Before it adopted Buddhism, the people were followers of the Mlechha, a Yavana or western, religion, some of whom worshiped the sun. Emulating the time periods in Zoroastrian eschatology which uses a cycle of time, as well as emulating the Zoroastrian concept of a final struggle between good against evil, the Buddhist legend states that as time progresses, the world around Shambala will succumb to evil. However, three millennia after ancient Shambhala king first travelled to India and adopted Buddhism, the Shambhalians will emerge to save the world. There will be a epic battle between the righteous Shambhalians and the surrounding evil forces &#8211; a battle in which the righteous Shambhalians will prevail and defeat evil forever. As we have noted, this legend closely parallels Zoroastrian legends that presage a final struggle between the forces of good and evil in which the good, the ashavan, will prevail, transforming the world to a paradise, a heaven, on earth &#8211; the <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/scriptures/selections.htm#vahishtem" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">vahishtem anghuim<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> &#8211; the transformative event being <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/overview/index.htm#frasho-kereti" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">frasho-kereti<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>.</p>
<p>Shambhala has both an outer temporal and an inner spiritual meaning. In the outer meaning, Shambhala is a land that is only accessible to the pure in heart. Those with impure motives will lose their way in the intervening deserts and mountains, blinded by storms. Representing the inner meaning, some thangka paintings of Shambhala depict the kingdom surrounding Mount Meru as an eight-petal lotus &#8211; a symbol for the heart chakra and an indication that Shambhala is to be found in a person&#8217;s heart.</p>
<p>This author therefore proposes that since Shambhala, the land surrounding Mount Meru, is identified as the Vedic Arya Varta, and since the Vedic Arya Varta in turn corresponds to the Avestan Airyana Vaeja (which contains Mount Hara), that the land surrounding Shambhala, Mount Meru and Airyana Vaeja are intimately linked if not the same land. If this author&#8217;s association is correct, what all four traditions, Zoroastrian, Hindu, Bon and Buddhist, have preserved, is the topography of ancient Airyana Vaeja &#8211; a land of fertile valleys and alpine meadows ringed by high snow-capped high mountains.</p>

<p>Weather Change in Airyana Vaeja During Jamshid&#8217;s Reign</p>
<p>(Note: The name <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/aryans/prehistory.htm#jamshid" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Jamshid<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> is a later version of the name Yima-Srira or Yima-Khshaeta, meaning Yima the radiant, in the Vendidad. In the Avesta, Jamshid is called Yima son of Vivanghat, while in the Vedas, he is called Yama son of Vivasvant.)</p>
<p>According to Zoroastrian texts as well as Ferdowsi&#8217;s <em>Shahnameh</em>, legendary king of Airyana Vaeja, King Jamshid, initiated the observance of Nowruz, New Year&#8217;s day on the first day of spring. For King Jamshid to take this step, Airyana Vaeja must have experienced the beginning of spring and the end of winter around the spring equinox or March 21.</p>
<p>Further, Yasna 9.5 (similarly, Vendidad II.I.6) also states that &#8220;in the reign of Yima, there was neither cold nor heat&#8221; &#8211; a temperate climate by definition. Additional references (see * below), state that the weather in Airyana Vaeja at the outset of the Jamshedi era was equitable. However, the Vendidad and other texts also inform us that a thousand two hundred years into the Jamshedi era, Airyana Vaeja experienced severe and long winters (for a further discussion on the Jamshedi era and the weather change, see our page <a href="http://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/aryans/prehistory.htm#weather" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Aryan Prehistory<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>)</p>
[*References to King Jamshid/Yima: Vendidad II.I.1-20(41) and II.I.21(42)-43(140); Yasna 9.4-5; Farvardin Yasht 23.130; Aban Yasht 5.25-26; Ferdowsi&#8217;s <em>Shahnameh</em>.]
<p>Funerary Practices</p>
<p>Zoroastrians and Tibetans share the practice of exposing the bodies of their deceased to birds or prey, and to our knowledge they are they only two cultural groups in the world to have employed these practices with any consistency and as an intrinsic part of their traditional / religious rites of passage. They actual methods employed were quite different and the are no records of the Tibetans using towers of silence, <a href="http://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/death/page3.htm#towersofsilence" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">dakhmas<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. This might indicate that while the conditions under which the ancient Tibetans and Zoroastrians lived were similar, they could have been neighbours but not compatriots.</p>
<p>Location of Airyana Vaeja, the Aryan Homeland</p>
<p>These observations, together with observations throughout this web site, point to a location for Airyana Vaeja, the ancient Aryan homeland, in the general vicinity of <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/tajikistan/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Tajikistan<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, southern <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/uzbekistan/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Uzbekistan<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, northern Afghanistan, and south-western <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/turkmenistan/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Turkmenistan<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> &#8211; the approximate area in the map below.</p>

<p><a id="post-6917-language"></a> Language Proximity of Central Asia with the Upper Indus Supported by Archaeology</p>
<p>Given that the Rig Veda is commonly thought to have been written in the Upper Indus region, we have yet one more reason to look at the area immediately to the north and north-west of the upper Indus Valley i.e. the <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/tajikistan/page3.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Pamir-Badakhshan<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> region as being a strong candidate for the homeland of the ancient Aryans, the so-called Proto Indo-Iranians.</p>
<p>The language of the Rig Veda and the Old Avesta are so close that they are commonly thought to be dialects such as that spoken in two neighbouring provinces and that further, they emerged from a common language philologists call Proto Indo-Iranian, another name for the language of united ancient Aryans. [<a href="http://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/languages/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Also see our page on Languages<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>.]
<p>Panini, the author of a grammar on Classical Sanskrit which was derived from the Vedic language was a resident of Pushkalavati, <strong>Gandhara</strong>, which is now part of modern-day Charsadda District in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, formerly known as the North-West Frontier Province of Pakistan and which included the Swat Valley now in northern Pakistan as well.</p>
<p>In the Swat-Chitral region, numerous archaeological sites have yielded graveyards dating between the second quarter of the second millennium BCE and the late centuries BCE, and with associated features leading the sites to be categorized as the Gandhara Grave Culture. The artefacts excavated from the sites show similarities and links with Central Asian as well as lower Indus Valley sites. The use of shell, coral and ivory were likely brought in via trade routes from the lower Indus plains and foothills.</p>
<p>A significant rock shelter site was excavated in the spring of 1967 near the township of <strong>Ghaligai / Ghalegay</strong> located on the east bank of the Swat River, some 12-15 km south of Mingora towards Barikot. At Ghaligai, the Swat Valley is a kilometres wide, flat, flood plain. Here, the river has many branches and frequently changes course. The valley itself is well cultivated and the crop fields slope gently down towards the river. Watercress and pumpkins are popular crops. Hills rise sharply for the valley. The eastern hills separate the Swat Valley from the Indus and Buner valleys while on the other side the western hills lie the Dir and Chitral valleys. The site has provided evidence of uninterrupted occupation for 3500 years starting from the second half of the 3rd millennium BCE. Three Carbon 14 dates of the earliest/lowest level give date from 2970 to 2930 BCE. artefacts from this level include pottery some with their inner surfaces burnished (presumably to make them water-proof from the inside). Some pottery shapes are similar to those found in Turkmenistan sites (Murgab Delta and the Kopet Dag hill base). Other artefacts found at Ghaligai as levell as Kili, Gul Hohammad, Sarai Kala, Jalilpur and Gumla show striking similarities and eveidence of trade of non-native materials primarily within the Aryan nations but also as far as the Arabian peninsula and China.</p>
<p>In a valley to the west of Ghaligai, archaeological finds at the <strong>Balambat site near Timergara</strong> (also spelt Timurgarh/Timargarha) and dated to 1500-600 BCE, show links with artefacts found in the lower Indus Valley site Mehrgarh as well as in Central Asian sites. [Balambat lies on the west bank of River Panjkora while Timergara lies across the river on the east bank. The name mean Timurgarh place of Timur (the Mohgul king). The Wikipedia page states that fire altars have also been found at Balambat indicating the resident to be &#8220;fire-worshippers&#8221; (sic). We are not concerned with the insulting language used in the Wikipedia page &#8211; rather, indications of the close links to an early Aryan settlement.</p>
<p>Aria</p>
<p>Haroyu &#8211; Sixth Vendidad Nation</p>
<p>There is a country that the classical Greeks and western authors called Aria (also spelt Arian, Arii) and which they located around present-day Harirud River (Old Ir. Harayu, Gk. Arios) in north-western Afghanistan&#8217;s Herat Province. (Note that the classical authors made a distinction between <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/aryans/airyanavaeja.htm#aryana" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Aryana<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, all the Aryan lands, and the state of Aria which was part of Greater Aryana.) Ptolemy (90-168 CE) 6.17 and Strabo (63/64 BCE &#8211; c. 24 CE) 11.10.1 describe Aria and its location in some detail &#8211; a <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/aryans/location.htm#location" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">location<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> close to the lands we have identified above for Airyana Vaeja. In addition, the Harirud region or present-day Herat province, are commonly identified with the sixth <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/aryans/airyanavaeja.htm#vendidad" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Vendidad nation<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> Haroyu as well as the Achaemenian nation of <strong>Haraiva</strong> (a name that could have been derived from Arai-va). It is significant that the majority of inhabitants in Herat city, Herat Province&#8217;s capital, are ethnic Tajiks, since the Tajikistan region is a strong candidate for the location of Airyana Vaeja, the Aryan homeland. (Also see or page on <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/aria/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Haroyu / Aria<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>.)</p>
<p>Aria is a candidate for the middle Aryan nation of <strong>Airan</strong>, the kingdom that features in the poet Ferdowsi&#8217;s epic, the <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/shahnameh/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Shahnameh<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, and one that was formed after the Aryan nation had migrated westward. Were it not for Aria&#8217;s identification with Haroyu the sixth Vendidad nation, we would be compelled to consider it as the possible location of the original Airyana Vaeja. The border between Airan and its eastern neighbour, Turan / Sugd, was the middle to lower reaches of the Amu Darya (Oxus) river. The Airan of the Shahnameh had Balkh as its capital and therefore would have included the kingdom of Bactria / Balkh / Bakhdhi as a principle kingdom. Airan was bordered by Sistan to the south.</p>
<p>Arrian (c.87-145 CE) in <em>Anabasis</em> 4.6.6 states that in antiquity, Aria was considered as particularly fertile and rich in wine. This reference by Arrian to Aria having been particularly fertile in antiquity may refer to the memory of Aria&#8217;s predecessor nation, Airyana Vaeja (<a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/aryans/location.htm#shambhala" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">see above<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>), being very fertile and a paradise on earth (rather than the present location).</p>
<p>Under the Sassanian dynasty (c.224 &#8211; 649 CE), the territory of Airan / Haraiva was transformed to the eastern quarter of the empire called Khurasan, Khur-a (from Khursheed meaning sun) and san (cf. stan meaning the land or place). Together, the name meant land of the (rising) sun. Greater Khorasan extended east to the Amu Darya (Oxus) River.</p>
<p>The maps below show the nations of the region from a Greek / European perspective. The borders and location are approximate at best, and often in error, as they are drawn from the descriptions in the classical texts. They nevertheless provide us with invaluable information. Note the mention of Aria, its location and prominence which is even more sticking in the map of the world according to <a href="http://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/maps/ptolemyAsia.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Ptolemy<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>.</p>

<p>Westward Migration of the Aryan Nation</p>
<p>If we are correct in surmising that the centre of the Aryan homeland moved westward accompanied by a contraction in its name, then the seat of the Aryan nation would have moved westward as follows:<br />
&#8211; The original ancient Aryan homeland Airyana Vaeja in the eastern Central Asian regions identified above, and more specifically the Pamir-Badakhshan region<br />
&#8211; The early middle Aryan nation Airan, the seat of the Kayanian dynasty, in Balkh (northern Afghanistan)<br />
&#8211; The late middle Aryan nation known to the Greeks as Aria, located in Harirud-Khorasan area (north-western Afghanistan / north-eastern Iran), and<br />
&#8211; The modern (2,500 year-old) Aryan nation Parsa, known to the West as Persia, which together with Khorasan became the Iran of today.</p>

<p>Pre-Zoroastrian Aryan Religions</p>
<p>Our sources for information about the pre-Zoroastrian Aryan religions are the Zoroastrian and Hindu scriptures: the <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/overview/index.htm#texts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Avesta<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> and <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/aryans/religion.htm#vedas" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Vedas<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> respectively, the <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/overview/index.htm#Dinkard" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Middle Persian<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> Zoroastrian texts and the poet Ferdowsi&#8217;s epic, the <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/shahnameh/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right"><em>Shahnameh</em><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>.</p>
<p>The description of the old Aryan religions, the names of their deities, and the groups that worshipped them, are not uniformly described in our reference texts. However, in reading the texts, some common themes do emerge, themes that allow us to attempt an understanding of the early Aryan religious beliefs, customs, and groupings &#8211; as well as the relationship between the different Aryan groups.</p>

<p>We will examine three primary pre-Zoroastrian Aryan religions mentioned in our source texts: Mazda worship, Daeva or Deva worship and Asura worship.</p>
<p>1. Mazda Worship</p>
<p><strong>Mazdayasni</strong><br />
In the <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/overview/index.htm#texts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Avesta&#8217;s<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> book of Yashts, verse <a href="http://www.avesta.org/ka/yt13sbe.htm#v85" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">13.87 of the Farvardin Yasht<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> as well as the Middle Persian <a href="http://www.avesta.org/denkard/dk3s1.htm#chap35" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Denkard at 3.35<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> mention that Mazda, God, was worshipped by the Aryans from the time of the first Aryan king <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/aryans/prehistory.htm#gayamaretan" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Gaya Maretan<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> &#8211; in other words from the outset of Aryan history. This statement is corroborated by the poet Ferdowsi&#8217;s epic, the <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/shahnameh/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Shahnameh<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, and by <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/overview/index.htm#Dinkard" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Middle Persian<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> Zoroastrian texts. In these texts, Gaya Maretan and his people were the first Mazdayasni meaning Mazda worshippers, the worshippers of God.</p>
<p>The word &#8216;mazda&#8217; is thought by some to be related to the Sanskrit &#8216;medha&#8217; meaning intelligent or wise. In usage, the word Mazda was used to mean God, that is, a creator who caused creation through wisdom, indeed, through a divine thought. Mazda therefore can be translated as God.</p>
<p><strong>Paoiryo-Tkaesha</strong><br />
The opening paragraphs of the Avesta&#8217;s <a href="http://www.avesta.org/ka/yt13sbe.htm#p180" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Farvardin Yasht<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> and the Yasht&#8217;s <a href="http://www.avesta.org/ka/yt13sbe.htm#section30" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">verse 13.150<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> also tell us that Gaya Maretan and the other Pre-Zoroastrian Mazdayasni were called paoiryo-tkaesha meaning keepers of the original ancient law. In order to differentiate early Mazda worship from the later Zoroastrian Mazda worship, we will call this original Aryan religion, Mazdayasni Paoiryo-Tkaesha.</p>
<p><strong>Ahura-Tkaesha</strong><br />
The Farvardin Yasht&#8217;s <a href="http://www.avesta.org/ka/yt13sbe.htm#v89" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">verses 89 &amp; 90<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> mention that later in Aryan history, Zarathushtra proclaimed the Ahura-tkaesha, the laws of the Lord (Ahura). If the word &#8216;mazda&#8217; related to the creative aspect of the divinity grounded in an ultimate concept of wisdom, the word &#8216;ahura&#8217; related to the aspect of having dominion over creation through order and laws that are innate in every part and particle of creation (cf. <a href="http://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/overview/index.htm#fravashi" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">fravashi<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>). Zarathushtra used these two concepts to propound a belief described as <strong>Mazdayasno Zarathushtrish Vidaevo Ahura-Tkaesho</strong>, that is, Zarathushtrian Mazda-Worship opposed to the daeva through the laws of the Lord (Ahura). For the sake of brevity, we can call Zarathushtrian Mazda-Worship (i.e. post Zarathushtra) as Mazdayasni Ahura-Tkaesha.</p>
<p>1a. Did the Mazdayasna Religion Precede Zarathushtra?</p>
<p>Since, as we have just observed, both the pre- and post- Zoroastrian religions are called Mazdayasni, many authors have assumed that Zarathushtra was a reformer of a Mazdayasni religion that predated him, rather than the founder of a new religion. While Zarathushtra may have used previous concepts and while his followers may have incorporated elements of a previous religion, or religions, back into Zoroastrianism, Zarathushtra&#8217;s teachings were different enough for him to have initially experienced great difficulty in getting others to listen to him. Our section on the <a href="http://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/aryans/religion2.htm#warreligion" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">war of religion<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> further illustrates the radical nature of his teachings &#8211; regardless of the words used for divinity. There are other reasons not to assume that Zarathushtra was a reformer. His concept of being a Mazdayasni was quite different from previous concepts labelled as &#8216;Mazdayasni&#8217;. There is an explanation for these assertions:</p>
<p>First, Mazda-yasni translated directly simply means God-worship rather than being the name of a religion. The form and doctrine of worship before Zarathushtra was very different from that preached by Zarathushtra, just as religions today who profess a worship of God i.e. God-worshippers, are radically different. Next, it is commonly assumed that Mazda is an Avestan name for God rather than a word for God &#8211; an assumption that may lead to incorrect conclusions. The difference is that if Mazda is the Avestan word for God, saying that the Aryans worshipped Mazda since the time of Gayo Maretan is the same as saying that the Aryans worshipped God (a supreme God) from ancient times. Mazda, or God, could have had different names through the ages, or the word for God could have changed with a change in language. For instance, if <a id="post-6917-varuna"></a><strong>Varuna</strong> (also see <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/aryans/religion.htm#varuna2" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">below<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>), a principle <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/aryans/religion.htm#asuraworship" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">asura<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> in the Vedas, was the name for God (Mazda) at one stage in Aryan history, then Varuna worship could also be called Mazda worship or the worship of God.</p>
<p>A parallel to this concept is found in the Christian Old and New Testaments as well as the Jewish Torah. There, the worship of Yahweh and Jehovah, or for that matter all the Judeo-Christian words or names for God, are synonymous with the worship of God. Despite the use of different words or names for God in the different languages of the Bible, Christians do not conclude that the Bible chronicles the worship of multiple gods throughout history. Christians say that Abraham worshipped God even though the attributes assigned to the Abrahamic God might be quite different from the more modern Christian assignment of divine attributes &#8211; thereby making Judaism and Christianity related but very different religions. Similarly, if we say that Gaya Maretan was a Mazda worshipper, the word or name for God in Pre-Zoroastrian Aryan history could have been Varuna or some other word / name, and the beliefs of the corresponding religions could also have been different, but nevertheless related, as would have been Varuna and Mitra worship, two <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/aryans/religion.htm#asuraworship" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">asuras<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> mentioned in the Rig Veda. In any event, Mazda worship before Zarathushtra might have been related but was quite different from Zarathushtra&#8217;s Mazda worship.</p>
<p>The Avesta&#8217;s book of Yashts, as well as portions of other Avestan books, may give us clues about the pre-Zoroastrian Mazdayasni beliefs, thereby serving a function in the Avesta similar to the Christian Bible&#8217;s Old Testament.</p>
<p>2. Daeva or Deva Worship</p>
[Note: The words deva (Vedic Sanskrit), daeva (Avestan Old Iranian) and div (Middle and Modern Persian) are commonly considered to be variations of the same word, div being the more modern (Middle Persian) word. While the different words may at times be applied in a similar fashion, there are times when they have different connotations.]
<p>Deva</p>
<p>The <strong>devas</strong> are the gods of the <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/aryans/religion.htm#appendix" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Hindu scriptures<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>.</p>
<p>The earliest of the Hindu scriptures, the <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/aryans/religion.htm#vedas" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Rig Veda<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> provides us with information about pre-Zoroastrian Vedic-Aryan deva worship.</p>
<p>Daeva and Div</p>
<p>The <strong>daeva</strong> and <strong>div</strong> in the Avesta and other Persian texts, are evil qualities, personification of evil qualities and demons. The terms &#8216;demon&#8217;, evil person and &#8216;negative value&#8217; (or &#8216;base quality&#8217;) are freely interchangeable in the Zoroastrian concept of the daeva or div (as mentioned earlier, div is the later version of the Avestan word daeva).</p>
<p>The demonization of the Rig Vedic deva, primarily Indra, in the Avesta, the naming of a book of the Zoroastrian scriptures, the Avesta as the Vi-daevo-data (modern name: Vendidad) meaning the law against the daeva, as well as the name of the religion preached by Zarathushtra: Mazdayasno Zarathushtrish Vidaevo Ahura-Tkaesho, that is, Zarathushtrian Mazda-Worship opposed to the daeva through the laws of the Lord (Ahura), together signify the strong opposition of the Mazda worshippers to the daeva and the defining of Zoroastrian Mazda worship through it opposition to the daeva.</p>
<p>Not all the daeva in Zoroastrian and Persian texts are the devas mentioned in the Vedas. The Mazda worshippers began to use the word daeva generically to mean all demonic forces of evil. The word daeva and div came to include the personification of vices, other Aryan gods who were not part of the Vedic pantheon, as well as the gods of non-Aryan peoples.</p>
<p>In the chapter 32 of the Gathas, Zarathushtra speaks about the daeva, evil and the lie, a concept he introduces in Y.30.6. In Yasna 32.3 Zarathushtra states:<br />
&#8220;At yush deava vispaongha<br />
akat manangho sta chithrem.&#8221;<br />
translated as:<br />
But all you daeva<br />
Are the progeny of wicked thoughts (thinking).</p>
<p>The manner in which Zarathushtra refers to the daeva is ambiguous. Zarathushtra refers to the daeva as a group who collectively chose evil. He does not name the daeva in his hymns. However, some of the negative qualities he speaks about &#8211; such as aeshma, wrath, and achistem mano, evil mind,(Y.30.6) became named as daeva elsewhere in the Avesta.</p>
<p>In the Avesta&#8217;s Aban (Avan) Yasht (5.94), we read of the <strong>Daevayasni</strong>, the daeva worshippers. In the Vendidad&#8217;s chapter 19, the Daevayasni are juxtaposed against the <strong>Mazdayasni</strong>.</p>
<p>Further, a book of the Avesta, is Vi-daevo-data (the <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/scriptures/index.htm#vendidad" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Vendidad<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>), meaning the law against the daeva, mentions (in verses 10.9 and 19.43) Indra, a Rig Vedic deva (<a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/aryans/religion.htm#indra" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">see below<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>), by name. Verses 10.9 to 10.16 mention additional daeva: Sauru, Naunghaithya, Tauru, Zairi, Aeshma, Akatasha, Zaurva, Buiti, Driwi, Daiwi, Kasvi, Paitisha, the daeva of Varenya (Varena) and the daeva of Mazana, presumed to be a nation (not mentioned in Vendidad&#8217;s list of sixteen nations) &#8211; modern Mazandaran. Daeva mentioned elsewhere in the Vendidad are Akem-Mano / Aka-Manah (evil mind) (19.4),</p>
<p>Of the daeva listed in the Vendidad, only Indra has a direct Vedic equivalent. Sauru is thought to be the Vedic Sarva (sometimes used in the Vedas as a name of Shiva). Similarly, Naunghaithya is thought to be the Vedic Nasatya. In the Vendidad, Indra operates under the auspices of <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/overview/index.htm#ahriman" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">angra mainyu<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, the evil spirit (in later texts, the embodiment of angra mainyu is Ahriman, the devil incarnate).</p>

<p>Indra is a principle deva in the Rig Veda where he has more verses addressed to him than any other deva. In the image to the right, Indra is seen riding his elephant Airavata. Unlike the invisible, non-anthropomorphic, genderless, non-iconic Mazda, the devas are represented and worshipped as idols or graven images.</p>
<p>Indra&#8217;s arch foe was the asura Vrita who was &#8220;manifested by the father of a youth killed by Indra. The young man had three heads, one for studying, one for eating, and one for watching. Indra was extremely jealous of the peaceful, studious youth. Finally, Indra was so enraged that he hurled a thunderbolt at him and cut of his heads.&#8221; (p. 502, <em>Dictionary of Ancient Deities</em> by Patricia Turner, Charles Russell Coulter). Vrita emerged from the slain youth&#8217;s body and was granted invincibility during night and day, to materials wet or dry, on land and on water.</p>
<p>Thereafter, in encounters between Indra and Vrita, Vrita was either victorious or succeeded in frustrating Indra&#8217;s exploits, until that is, Indra was aided by Vishnu as the trickster (also <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/aryans/religion.htm#vishnu" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">see below<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>). On Vishnu&#8217;s advice Indra feigned a friendship and made a truce with Vrita. Then, after many years, Vishnu and Indra discovered the means to penetrate Vrita&#8217;s invisibility. One day, while they were walking on a seashore at twilight &#8211; a time that was neither day nor night &#8211; the wily Vishnu gathered the froth of the ocean &#8211; which was neither wet nor dry &#8211; and threw it at Vrita standing at water&#8217;s edge &#8211; a spot that was neither land nor water &#8211; engulfing and choking the asura.</p>
<p>We read into the myth, core values of the deva and asura worshippers, as well as the methods the deva-worshippers employed in order to co-exist for generations with the dominant asura-worshippers: bidding their time while plotting to gain power through subterfuge.</p>
<p>Div as Evil People</p>
<p>In Ferdowsi&#8217;s epic, the kingdom of King Gaya Maretan was attacked by divs led by Ahriman&#8217;s son &#8211; a battle that is discussed further <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/aryans/religion.htm#battles" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">below<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>.</p>
<p>Div as Vices</p>
<p>The <em>Shahnameh</em> goes on to list in its pages nine principle vices called divs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Az &#8211; greed</li>
<li>Niaz &#8211; desire</li>
<li>Khashm &#8211; wrath</li>
<li>Rashk &#8211; envy</li>
<li>Nang &#8211; dishonour</li>
<li>Kin &#8211; vengeance</li>
<li>Nammaam &#8211; tell-tale</li>
<li>Do-ruy &#8211; two-faced</li>
<li>Napak-din &#8211; heretic</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These divs and vices closely parallel the daeva characteristics &#8211; the demonic personification of vices &#8211; mentioned in the Avesta. The vices are considered evil by Zoroastrians and the antithesis of the virtues of an <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/overview/index.htm#ashavan" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">ashavan<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>.</p>
<p>Nature of the Div (Evil)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.avesta.org/denkard/dk3s.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Book 3 of the Denkard<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> (a Middle Persian non-scriptural text) gives us interesting observations into the perceived nature of the div: Evil has no creative powers. If we extrapolate the statement we are led to the concept that Mazda, God, is creative [Dk 3.40: &#8220;The Self-existent is One, and God alone has created&#8221;], constructive and pure (cf. Pak Yazdan, a Pure Divinity) while the div is the dualistic antithesis &#8211; it is destructive and polluting. Therefore demonic forces cannot create. They can only pollute and contaminate, and thereby cause evil or transform something good to evil &#8211; like a drop of poison contaminating pure water and thereby transforming it from something life-giving to something deathly. When entities through an act of choice, choose evil and set about their acts of deception or destruction, they become that element of evil [Dk. 3.144 &#8220;Because of wisdom (i.e. choice) that a person is a doer of good or evil deeds&#8221;. Also see <a href="http://www.avesta.org/denkard/dk3s1.htm#chap35" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Dk 3.33<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>.]. The consequence is that since divs can only destroy, they will ultimately destroy themselves &#8211; that is the promise of Zoroastrian eschatology. However, the good must participate to bring about and facilitate that eventuality.</p>
<p>Other Denkard passages and Middle Persian texts question whether Ahriman and the divs exist at all. Perhaps referring to <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/scriptures/selections.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Chapter 30<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> of the Gathas, they postulate that existence or being is a result of the creative process from which life and goodness emerged. The evil mind (akem-mano / aka-manah), other aspects of evil, and the personification of evil, are progressions of being or existence&#8217;s dual aspect &#8211; the aspect of not-being or anti-existence. The symbolic analogy here is that darkness is not an independent entity. It is the absence of light &#8211; it is not-light. Darkness is banished instantly when light emerges [Dk 3.142: Where there is much shining of light, there is permanence of light and disappearance of darkness]. The banishment of darkness is enduring if the light is enduring as with an ever-burning flame. Yet a flame is fragile. It is extinguished not by darkness, but by the lack of attention by those who must nurture it and fed it pure foods as a mind is fed the food of good thoughts and the body, good deeds. It follows that Ahriman and the divs cannot exist independently, but manifest themselves in the absence of goodness. Therefore evil would cease to be manifest if goodness were all pervasive &#8211; an ultimate goal towards which Zoroastrians dedicate themselves. Once again, the good must play an active part for without the spread of light, without the maintenance of an ever-burning flame, the darkness of evil cannot be banished. [cf. Dk 3.27, 33, 34, 40, 50, 130, 132, 142.]
<p>3. Asura Worship</p>
<p>The Rig Veda or other Hindu religious texts do not directly mention Mazda worship or Mazda worshippers. Rather, they mention a set of deities who carry the title asura.</p>
<p>The word asura is the Vedic equivalent of the Avestan <strong>ahura</strong>. Avestan words can frequently be changed to their Sanskrit equivalent by replacing h with s. Ahura is in turn said to be derived from the word ahu, meaning lord. As with the English word &#8216;lord&#8217;, ahu is a descriptive title for both a human lord (e.g. a feudal lord or landlord) and a divine lord. In the Avesta, God or Mazda, is sometimes addressed as Ahura (Lord) and sometimes as Ahura Mazda (Lord God). The use of the words in this manner can also be found in the Judeo-Christian Bible.</p>
<p>It is pertinent to note that in the older Veda, the Rig Veda, the term asura or lord is used (as in the Avesta) for individual gods and for people &#8211; but never for a group of gods. In other words, asura does not define a class of gods. Rather it is a title. In these older Vedic texts, the term deva, however, is used for both individual gods and the group of devas (visve devah). In other words, deva is used both as a title &#8211; a superior god &#8211; and as the name for the group of gods. Some gods with the title asura are also referred to as devas. This nomenclature changes in the later Vedic texts, where the word asura is used as a title and as the name of a group of gods, gods who had evolved into demons.</p>
<p>There is a considerable difference in the way asuras are treated in the older and younger Vedic texts and the difference may help us understand the manner in which the Aryan religions, and the relationship between them, evolved.</p>
<p>In the earlier Vedas, the devas and asuras are said to have been born of a common parent, but the asuras were the older (purva-deva) and stronger siblings &#8211; powerful and beneficent gods who merited equal if not greater respect than the devas.</p>
<p>In the later Vedic texts starting with the <strong>Atharva Veda</strong>, the asuras are referred to in the plural, that is as a group of deities. It is also in these later texts that the asuras are depicted as being opposed to the devas. In conflicts between the two, the asuras were invariably victorious. The devas were victorious when they used a ruse or received the help of a benefactor trickster such as <a id="post-6917-vishnu"></a>Vishnu.</p>
<p>In the post Vedic texts such as the <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/aryans/religion.htm#bhagavadgita" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Bhagavad-Gita<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/aryans/religion.htm#puranas" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Puranas<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> and <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/aryans/religion.htm#postvedic" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Itihasas<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, the asuras are transformed and treated as a group of demons who possess the vices of pride, arrogance, conceit, anger, harshness, and ignorance (Gita 16.4). In the <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/aryans/religion.htm#vedas" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Brahmana<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> texts, the asuras are hostile and opposed to the devas with whom they are in constant conflict.</p>
<p>However, no individual god who carries the title asura in the Rig Veda ever appears as an inimical adversary of the deva gods in the later Hindu religious texts, and none of the gods who bore the title asura in the older Rig Veda are mentioned in these later texts. In other words, the asuras of the earlier texts are not to be considered as demons. In one later text, the <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/aryans/religion.htm#upanishads" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Upanishad<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, the new character of the asuras are accompanied with a new word, sura, meaning god, thereby implying that asura meant a-sura or a not-god.</p>
<p>It stands to reason that the change in the way the asuras were perceived by the deva worshippers closely parallels the changes in the relations between the asura and deva worshippers. There is an acknowledgement that the asura worship preceded deva worship and that in the early years, the asura worshippers were the dominant group.</p>
<p><a id="post-6917-mithra"></a> A name that appears to be common to both the Avesta and Vedas is the Vedic asura <strong>Mitra</strong> (also see <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/aryans/religion.htm#mithra2" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">below<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>) and the Avestan <strong>Mithra</strong>. In the Vedas, Mitra is often addressed together with the asura <a id="post-6917-varuna2"></a><strong>Varuna</strong>.</p>
<p>While the Vedas tend to anthropomorphize all its deities, it is probable that the asuras, Varuna, Mithra and Agni were originally invisible, non-anthropomorphic, genderless, non-iconic deities (cf. the attributes of Mazda) who may have been worshipped together as Asura worship or exclusively as Mazda worship.</p>

<p>Differences Between Deva &amp; Asura Worship</p>
<p>In his book, <em>The Hymns of Atharvan Zarathushtra</em>, Jatindra Mohan Chatterji calls the Rig Vedic devas the seen gods, and asuras the unseen gods. In other words the devas like <strong>Indra</strong> were anthropomorphic and capable of representation as idols, while the asuras like <strong>Mitra</strong> were, for the main part, non-anthropomorphic and formless.</p>
<p>In the Rig Veda, the devas preside over natural phenomena and the exercise of power and might while the asuras preside over the establishment of a moral and social order. For instance, the deva <strong>Indra</strong> is guardian of the weather and victory in battle earning the title sahasra-mushka, &#8216;the one with a thousand testicles&#8217; (Rig Veda 6.45.3), while the asuras <strong>Varuna</strong> and <strong>Mitra</strong> are the guardians of the cosmic and moral laws of <strong>rita</strong> (cf. <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/overview/index.htm#asha" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">asha<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>).</p>
<p>In the Rig Veda (4.42.1-6), when Varuna declares, &#8220;I, Varuna, am the king; first for me were appointed the dignities of asura, the Lord. I let the dripping waters rise up, and through rta I uphold the sky.&#8221; Indra replies, &#8220;Men who ride swiftly, having good horses, call on me when surrounded in battle. I, the bountiful Indra, provoke strife. I whirl up the dust, my strength is overwhelming&#8230; . No godlike power can check me &#8211; I who am unassailable. When draughts of Soma, when songs have made me frenzied, then both the unbounded regions are filled with fear.&#8221; The hymns addressed to Varuna are more ethical and devout in tone than the others, and form the most noble or high-minded portion of the Rig Veda.</p>
<p>If the qualities of the gods reflect the values of the worshippers, then for asura worshippers building and maintaining a peaceful society based on law and order was a priority. For the deva worshippers, the priority would have been the exercise of power through might and fear. The asuras are ethical where the devas are materialistic. While in the Rig Veda both deities and their respective allies are worshipped, Indra and deva worship clearly take precedence. The largest number of Rig Vedic hymns are dedicated to Indra &#8211; nearly 250 out of a total of 1028. Agni, an asura, is invoked in about 200 hymns, a greater number than the number of hymns dedicated to Varuna.</p>
<p>In Buddhism, the asuras are seen as lesser deities who are never satisfied and who continuously strive to better themselves. Zoroastrianism sees continuously striving for improvement towards excellence as a fundamental purpose of life.</p>
<p>The characteristics assigned to the devas and asuras reflected what beliefs the rulers and their supporting priests wished to promote in society. The ideal of continuously striving to improve oneself could have promoted ambition amongst the common people, while some rulers and priests may have thought it more desirable to promote satisfaction or resignation to one&#8217;s lot in life &#8211; a life that had been divinely ordained. Rulers and priests so inclined would have promoted deva worship that included the caste system rather than asura worship that saw working to better oneself as a virtue and not a sin.</p>
<p>As in our example above, the differences between what the devas and asuras represented became differences in core beliefs, values, the nature of human beings, and the organization of society. These differences appear to have become strong enough to produce a deep societal divide &#8211; a schism &#8211; with the deva worshippers on one side, and the asura and Mazda worshippers on the other side. The Mazda worshippers were the Iranian-Aryans, The deva worshippers are generally thought of as being Indian-Aryans though they could have been any of the non-Iranian groups.</p>
<p>Incorporation of Pre-Zoroastrian Asuras into Mazda Worship &amp; Zoroastrianism</p>
<p><a id="post-6917-mithra2"></a> Some of the asuras such as <strong>Mitra</strong>, are included in the Zoroastrian scriptures, the Avesta, as angels (<strong>fereshtes</strong> or <strong>yazatas</strong>) and guardians or lords (ahuras/asuras) of core Zoroastrian values and ideals.</p>
<p>In the Avesta, the names of the yazatas are also names for core values and ideals. For instance, as an angel in the Avesta, Mithra is the guardian of the values and qualities associated with friendship. In day-to-day language, Mithra means a friend, the ideals of loyal, trustworthy, caring and kind friendship and the qualities of kindness, helpfulness and benevolence. As a core value Mithra is the value of keeping of promises.</p>
<p>We do not know if the incorporation of asura worship into Mazda worship took place before, during or after Zarathushtra&#8217;s time. In the hymns of Zarathushtra, the Gathas, Zarathushtra does not accommodate or incorporate the asuras in the manner that we see elsewhere in the Avesta. Indeed, depending on the interpretation of the Gathas being read, Zarathushtra can be seen as preaching an uncompromising monotheism. Regardless of the interpretations that abound, the Avesta taken as a whole together with Middle Persian literature and Ferdowsi&#8217;s Shahnameh provide the full spectrum of belief and a consistent ethic. The texts are a repository of a rich heritage consisting of some of the earliest literature and history known to humankind &#8211; a history interwoven with the references to the asuras and daevas.</p>

<p>Appendix: Hindu Religious Texts</p>
<p>Vedas</p>
<p>1. The <strong>Rig Veda</strong> contains hymns (mantras) about the mythology and ancient Vedic practice<br />
(At Wikipedia: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigveda" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" data-wpel-link="external">Description<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, <a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Rigveda_(Griffith)/1#1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" data-wpel-link="external">Translations<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, also <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandala_1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Mandalas<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>.

2. The <strong>Sama Veda</strong> consists mainly of Rig Vedic mantras, arranged in the order required to perform the Soma ritual. (At <a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/sv.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Sacred Texts<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>);<br />
3. The <strong>Yajur Veda</strong> contains instructions for the soma rituals in prose (at <a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/wyv/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Sacred Texts<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>); and<br />
4. The <strong>Atharva Veda</strong> consists of spells against enemies, sorcerers, diseases and mistakes made during the sacrificial ritual. It also outlines royal duties and expounds on spiritual matters. (At <a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/av/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" data-wpel-link="external">Sacred Texts<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>)</p>
<p>Each of the four Vedas are divided into two sections:<br />
1. The <strong>Samhita </strong>or <strong>mantras</strong>, hymns, and<br />
2. The <strong>Brahmanas</strong> &#8211; commentaries, interpretation and instructions for the the rituals.</p>
<p>The Brahmanas are further sub-divided into two sections;<br />
1. The <strong>Aranyakas</strong>, description of especially dangerous rituals such as the Mahavrata and Pravargya, and<br />
2. The <strong>Upanishads</strong> (see below)</p>
<p>Upanishads</p>
<p>The Upanishad , meaning sitting near (the teacher), are philosophical and metaphysical writings about the relationship between the soul and Brahman. Collectively, the Upanishads are called the <strong>Vedanta</strong>, the end of the Veda, because they appear at the end of each Veda, and because they are considered the culmination of Vedic knowledge.</p>
<p>Notes on the Vedas</p>
<p>The predominant deities of the Vedas, headed by Indra, are different from those in later, post-Vedic Hinduism. The central story of the Vedas is Indra&#8217;s battle and eventual killing of the asura Vrita. The ritual focus is that of the <strong>yajna</strong> (cf. Avestan yasna) &#8211; the act of worship. The spiritual focus is in joining ancestral souls in the Vedic equivalent of heaven. The concept of reincarnation would enter Hinduism in the post-Vedic period. Reincarnation is not an native Aryan concept. The doctrinal focus is the <strong>purva</strong> or original <strong>mimamsa</strong> &#8211; inquiry or investigation.</p>
<p>Post Vedic Scriptures</p>
<p>1. <strong>Itihasas </strong>(epics like the <strong>Ramayana</strong>, <strong>Mahabharata</strong>). The heroes of the epics are avatars, incarnation of God, Vishnu, as human being: Rama, in the Ramayana, and Krishna, in the Mahabharata. Unlike the gods of the Vedas and the mystic all-pervading and formless Brahman in the Brahmanas, the avatars are developed loving and righteous personalities (Sacred Texts: <a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/rama/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Ramayana<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>) ;<br />
2. <strong>Puranas </strong>(mythology),<br />
3. <strong>Agamas </strong>(theological treatises)<br />
3. <strong>Darshanas </strong>(philosophical texts), and<br />
5. <strong>Dharmashastras </strong>(law books)</p>
<p>Bhagavad-Gita</p>
<p>Also known as the Gita, the Bhagavad Gita (meaning the song of God) is a section of the Mahabharata where Krishna exhorts the devotee to abandon the mortal self and give oneself to the infinite love of God. By loving God a person loves the immortal self, and thereby finds harmony and peace with the universe.</p>
<p>Puranas</p>
<p>The Puranas consist of narratives ranging from the history of the universe from creation to destruction, cosmology, philosophy, geography, genealogies and myths of kings, heroes, sages, and demigods. Some individual Puranas feature a particular deity and their exploits such as Durga-Devi and her killing of Mahish-Asura. The Puranas are usually written in the form of stories told by one person to another.</p>
<p>Notes on the Post-Vedic Scriptures</p>
<p>In the post-Vedic scriptures, the focus of veneration of Indra in the Rig Veda, is replaced by the worship of Vishnu, Shiva and (Durga) Devi. Although Vishnu was a Vedic deity, he rises to pre-eminence in the post-Vedic scriptures. The Vedic yajna is replaced by a different religious ritual called the puja. The ritualistic purva mimamsa is replaced by the speculative philosophies of Vedanta also called the uttar, or later, mimamsa.</p>

<p>Evolution of Aryan Worship</p>
<p>In reading the different Zoroastrian and Hindu texts, we are left with the impression that the three different Aryan religions as well as the relationship between them, evolved significantly over time. They could have looked very different at different points in history and also in different locations. The relationship between them also changed from one of coexistence to irrevocable separation.</p>
<p>The communities in which the religions were practiced could have been exclusivist or pluralistic communities. Rulers of exclusivist communities could be expected to acknowledge a single religion or even a single deity within the deva or asura pantheon. Rulers of pluralistic communities could be expected to be more ecumenical.</p>
<p>At times the three religious groups coexisted while at other times they competed violently.</p>
<p>Coexistence</p>
<p>An example of a pluralistic, ecumenical accommodation of the asuras and devas by specific communities is a c. 1400 BCE peace treaty with the Hittites, the rulers of the Hurrian kingdom of Mitanni invoked the asuras Varuna and Mitra, as well as the devas Indra and the Nasatyas. Mitanni was located southwest of Lake Van, in an area that is part of Southern Turkey and Northern Syria today.</p>
<p>In the Rig Veda, we read that the initial relationship between the asuras and deva was one of coexistence. This relationship would gradually change to one of competition. Nevertheless, some asuras such as <strong>Agni</strong>(fire) are invited by the deva chief <strong>Indra</strong> to becomes devas (Rig Veda 10.124) and Agni is sometimes referred to as a deva. In verse 5, <strong>Varuna</strong>, a principle asura, is also invited by Indra to become a deva.</p>
<p>Cooperation between the asuras and devas is not relegated to the earlier Hindu scriptures, the Rig Veda. Stories of their cooperation can be found in the later Puranas, such as the story of Mount Mandara. However, their cooperation is short-lived. In the story, a catastrophic flood befalls the earth submerging the treasured possessions of the devas and asuras including the elixir of immortality, Amrita (cf. Avestan Amertat, immortality). The peak of the lofty Mount Meru rose above the flood and this is where the gods gathered and caucused on how to retrieve the Amrita. They agreed to a plan proposed by the deva Vishnu. Together, they uprooted the mountain Mandara and placed it on the back of Kurma, the tortoise. The gods then coiled the world serpent Vasuki around the mountain like a rope with the asuras holding one end of the snake and the devas the other end. By coordinating their actions, they used the snake coiled around the mountain to rotate the mountain and thereby churn the cosmic ocean formed by the flood. As the waters churned, the ocean turned to milk and then to butter, revealing the lost elixir of immortality and other treasures. The cooperation soon ended. According to the Bhagavata-Purana, as soon as the Amrita was produced, the devas took possession of it, and broke their promise to the asuras to give them half. As a consequence, the asuras then tried to steal it from the devas. A struggle ensued which the asuras lost and the devas consumed the nectar of immortality all by themselves.</p>

<p>The story marks the end of cooperation between the devas and asuras and the start of a deep and irreconcilable schism between them. Their relationship had deteriorated to the point that they were henceforth bent on mutual destruction.</p>
<p>Schism Between Mazda-Asura and Deva Worshippers</p>
<p>The story of the differences between the asuras and devas were of course a reflection of the differences and the violent conflict between the deva and asura worshippers. While, as we have mentioned, the Hindu scriptures do not directly refer to Mazda worshippers, the Zoroastrian and Persian texts talk about the conflict as one between the deva and Mazda worshippers. We will therefore refer to the conflict as between the deva and asura-Mazda worshippers.</p>
<p>Primordial Battles Between Mazda &amp; Deva Worshippers</p>
<p>According to the poet Ferdowsi&#8217;s epic, the <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/shahnameh/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Shahnameh<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, at the dawn of history the Mazda worshippers and the deva worshippers fought two primordial battles. The battles took place during the reign of the first Aryan king, <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/shahnameh/page03.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Gaya Maretan<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> (a name later shortened first to Gayo-Mard and then Kayomars in the Shahnameh). The first battle started when the deva worshippers led by Ahriman, attacked Gaya Maretan&#8217;s Mazda worshippers. During the battle, Ahriman&#8217;s son killed Gaya Maretan&#8217;s son Siyamak, and the first battle resulted in the defeat of Gaya Maretan&#8217;s army by Ahriman&#8217;s hordes. However, retribution was to follow. After a bitter period of mourning, Gaya Maretan assembled a large army led by his grandson Hushang. The Mazda worshippers then attacked and defeated the deva worshippers in a second battle, a defeat that resulted in a subjugation of the deva worshippers by the Mazda worshippers.</p>

<p>These initial battles were to characterize the relationship between the deva and Mazda worshippers in subsequent millennia. Periodically, one group would win dominance over the other. Nevertheless, until, their separation into the nations of Iran and India, they did coexist, possibly within a community or in adjacent communities.</p>
<p>The War of Religion</p>
<p>If Gaya Maretan and his successors had asserted the dominance of Mazda worshippers over the deva worshippers, that state of affairs would change over time, and the deva worshippers would turn the table and gradually assert their dominance.</p>
<p>This change in dominance is recorded in Ferdowsi&#8217;s Shahnameh. The Shahnameh&#8217;s chapter on King Vishtasp and Zarathushtra opens with the following lines which we have adapted from James Atkinson&#8217;s translation of the Shahnameh:</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve said preceding sovereigns worshipped God (Mazda)<br />
By whom their crowns were given<br />
To protect the people from oppressors.<br />
God they served, acknowledging God&#8217;s goodness &#8211;<br />
For to God, the pure, unchangeable, the Holy One!<br />
They owed their greatness and their earthly power.<br />
But after times,<br />
Worship of God gave way to idolatry and pagan faith,<br />
And then Mazda&#8217;s name was lost<br />
In adoration of created things.</p>
<p>At the time of Zarathushtra&#8217;s birth, Mazda worship had lost ground to deva worship, as had the virtues of honesty and not causing harm to others. A young <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/zarathushtra/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Zarathushtra<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, disgusted with the dishonesty, violence, greed and lawlessness that surrounded him, resolved to dedicate his life to changing this state of affairs. He preached establishing an ethical order based on the old Mazdayasni faith &#8211; one that would come to be known as the Mazdayasni Ahura-Tkaesha.</p>
<p>The first royal patron of Zarathushtra&#8217;s religion was King Vishtasp. <a href="http://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/shahnameh/page30.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Ferdowsi&#8217;s Shahnameh<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> tells us that King Vishtasp was king of <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/balkh/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Balkh<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, which at that time had become a tributary state of <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/sugd/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Turan (Sugd)<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>.

<p>When King Vishtasp adopted the Zoroastrian Mazdayasni faith, he also decided to stop paying tribute to King Arjasp of Turan, whereupon Arjasp gave Vishtasp an ultimatum to resume paying tribute and forsake his adopted faith, or face a devastating invasion (cf. Warner &amp; Atkinson translations of the Shahnameh):</p>
<p>&#8220;Abandon your ill course,<br />
Be awed before the God of Paradise,<br />
Put far from you that aging miscreant,<br />
And hold a feast according to our customs&#8230; .</p>
<p>&#8220;If not, in a month or two,<br />
I will enter your kingdom with fire and sword,<br />
And destroy your authority and you.<br />
I give you good advice:<br />
Do not be influenced by a wicked counsellor,<br />
But return to your former religious practices.<br />
Weigh well, therefore, what I say.&#8221;</p>
<p>Vishtasp rejected the ultimatum and what followed was the War of Religion (cf. <a href="http://www.avesta.org/mp/grb1.htm#chap9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Greater Bundahishn 9.36<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>and <a href="http://www.avesta.org/mp/bundahis.html#chapter12" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Lesser Bundahishn 12.36<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>) in which Vishtasp was apparantly victorious (also see the last para of this section).</p>
<p>The conflict and Vishtasp&#8217;s victory could have resulted in the deva worshippers living in his Central Asian kingdom, leaving or being pushed south through the Hindu Kush mountain passes into the upper Indus valley (today&#8217;s Pakistan). It is possible that the Indus valley had previously been populated by deva worshippers, and that those from Central Asia migrated to join their co-religionists. The Hindu Kush (meaning Hindu Killer) would from that point, have formed a border between the Zoroastrian Mazda worshippers and the deva worshippers.</p>
<p>The Indus Valley was called Hindu (later Hind or Ind) in the Avesta. The locals called the region Sindhu and then Sind. Replacing &#8216;h&#8217; with &#8216;s&#8217; is a common way of transforming many Avestan words to Sanskrit. The Persians eventually called the people of the region Hindi, a name that would in western parlance become Indie (India). Indians, however, refer to their country as <strong>Bharat</strong>. In addition, the name for the religion of the deva worshippers, Hindu, is also derived from the Avestan / Iranian / Persian names for the Indus region. Hindu is not a name for their religion used by the ancient Hindus. Hindus refer to their religion by various names such as <strong>Sanatana Dharma</strong>, meaning eternal law in Sanskrit, or the <strong>Vaideeha Dharma</strong>.</p>
<p>However, the Greater Bundahishn also records in 9.36, &#8220;In the War of Religion, when defeat was with the Iranians,&#8230; .&#8221; Such a defeat could have pushed the Iranian out of their Central Asian homeland westward. The Lesser Bundahishn in 12.32-33 states, &#8220;32. From the same Padashkh-Vargar mountain unto Mount Kumish, which they call Mount Madofryad (&#8216;Come-to-help&#8217;) &#8212; that in which Vishtasp routed Arjasp &#8212; is Mount Miyan-i-Dast (&#8216;mid-plain&#8217;), and was broken off from that mountain there. 33. They say, in the War of the Religion, when there was confusion among the Iranians it broke off from that mountain, and slid down into the middle of the plain; the Iranians were saved by it, and it was called &#8216;Come-to-help&#8217; by them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Asura Deva Conflict in the Hindu Scriptures</p>
<p>The perpetual war between the asuras and devas form some of the central themes in the later Hindu texts. This might signify that at the time when these texts were written, the relationship between the Aryan asura and deva worshippers had deteriorated to such an extent that they engaged in continuous internecine conflict.</p>
<p>The perpetual conflict between the devas and asura described in the Hindu texts found its way into Buddhist literature as well. In Pali Theravada Buddhist literature, the most frequent references to asuras are in connection with the continual war between asuras and devas. Similarly, in Mahayana Buddhist literature the asuras, motivated by envy of the devas, are constantly at war with them. [111: 21-6].</p>

<p>An example of the transformation in relations between the deva and asura worshippers in Hindu scriptures from a grudging acknowledgement of the onetime supremacy of the Mazda / asura worshippers to violent conflict, is the Hindu myth of the battle between female deva, Durga-devi and the asura, Mahish-asura (see image to the right) in chapters 81 to 93 in the Markandeya Purana.</p>
[The Vedic name Mahish-asura may have an Avestan equivalence in mazishta-ahura i.e. the greatest ahura/asura. Mahish-asura could transform himself into a buffalo and the scenes of Durga killing Mahish-asura sometimes depicts Durga killing a buffalo, a scene reminiscent of <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c7/Fresque_Mithra_Doura_Europos.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" data-wpel-link="external">Mitra killing the bull in Roman mithraeums<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. (Curiously, Mithra in Iranian tradition is the name of a woman.) Durga carries the title Mahish-asura-mardini, mardini meaning a killer of the feminine gender.]
<p>According to the myth, Mahish-asura was pious and worshipped Brahma, the supreme deity among the devas and asuras. As a reward, Brahma granted Mahish-asura supremacy and omnipotence over all deities and humans &#8211; no man or male deity would be able to defeat him or kill him. Mahish-asura used his omnipotence over males to defeat Indra, the king of the devas, and take control of Swarga Loka, Indra&#8217;s realm in the upper mountainous regions, and Prithvi Loka, the lower regions. In doing so, Mahish-asura drove Indra and all the other devas (in other words, the deva worshippers and temples housing the devas) out of Swarga Loka.</p>
<p>This description of Mahish-asura as an omnipotent god, a god who was supreme over both devas and asuras, is a description shared only by the Rig Vedic asura Varuna who is designated in the Rig Veda as the asura who is king of everyone, both gods and mortals (RV II.27.10). &#8220;This asura rules over the gods,&#8221; is a further statement of omnipotence in Atharva Veda I.10.1. No other Vedic god is described in this manner. Asura Varuna is often thought to be the Vedic equivalent of the Avestan Ahura Mazda.</p>
<p>Swarga Loka, is the mountainous kingdom where <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/aryans/location.htm#meru" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Mount Meru<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> stands. Mount Meru and its companion mountains are the hub from which the Himalayas stem (a possible description of the Pamirs). Bharatavarsha, Ancient India, lay to the south of the Himalayas. The Vedic description of Mount Meru is similar to the Zoroastrian description of Airyana Vaeja&#8217;s <strong>Mount Hara</strong> (also see <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/aryans/location.htm#mountains" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Aryan Homeland Location page<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>).</p>
<p>After an eon-long lament by the expelled devas, Brahma created Durga, a female deity who avenged the devas by killing Mahish-asura whose omnipotence did not extend to females. The killing of Mahish-asura and the defeat of his armies enabled the devas to return to Swarga and Prithvi Loka.</p>

<p>There are indications in the myth, that while Mahish-asura was in the beginning allied to other asuras, Mahish-asura eventually drove these asuras out of Swarga Loka as well. (This could mean that Mahish-asura was worshipped not just as a supreme God, but as an only God as well.) When the devas prepared to invade and retake Swarga and Prithvi Loka, the other asuras assisted Durga by providing her with weapons.</p>
<p>The myth has embedded in it, the common roots and the schism between the Aryan religious groups: the deva, asura and Mazda worshippers. It may also contain history. For instance, at the outset there are the common roots, shared history and co-existence among the groups. Next, there is the rise to dominance of the Mazda worshippers who drove the deva worshippers out of the upper and lower regions of the Aryan homeland. Later, the Mazda worshippers drove out the asura worshippers as well. Eventually, however, the deva worshippers, assisted by the asura worshippers, assembled a strong army and drove the Mazda worshippers out of Airyana Vaeja. The <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/aryans/religion2.htm#warreligion" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">war of religion<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> between the two groups may have therefore taken place in two stages, the second stage ending in the Mazda worshippers being driven out of their traditional lands. The <a href="http://www.avesta.org/mp/bundahis.html#chapter12" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Bundahishn 12.33<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> states that &#8220;They say, in the war of the religion, there was confusion among the Iranians&#8230; .&#8221;</p>
<p>There is a inexplicable gap in Zoroastrian history this myth might help to fill. The gap occurs after the closing of the Avestan canon and the start of <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/achaemenian/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Median and Persian history<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> (c. 800 BCE). Some reason or event caused the Zoroastrians to migrate westward out of the upper Aryan lands.</p>
<p>The story is an example of how the schism between the two groups became part of Hindu scripture. Similarly, an entire book of the Avesta, the Vendidad, derives its name from Vi-dev-data, the law against the devas, that is, the law against evil.</p>
<p>Post Separation Relations</p>
<p>Once the two groups of Aryans had separated, the deva worshippers migrating south across the Hindu Kush mountains into the upper Indus valley, the relationship between the deva and Mazda worshippers appears to have oscillated between peaceful neighbourliness and conflict. However, when conflict did arise, it was more in the nature of kings and ruling groups seeking power (sometimes perhaps at the behest of religious advisors) than animosity between between two peoples.</p>
<p>To this day, the two peoples, the Zoroastrians and Hindus, intuitively feel a certain historic kinship. When the Zoroastrians were driven out of their Iranian homeland by the Arabs, it is the Hindus of India who gave the Zoroastrians a home, and the two groups have coexisted peacefully in India for over a thousand years, each honouring the other&#8217;s freedom to maintain their religious beliefs.</p>
<p>Zoroastrians owe a debt of gratitude to their Hindu cousins for having opened the doors of their land for Zoroastrians to enter not just as guests but as members of a family. Even the Zoroastrians who remained behind in Iran benefited from Indian hospitality since the Zoroastrians (the Parsees) who prospered in India were able to provide support and advocate on behalf of their Iranian brethren who were discriminated against and persecuted in the land of their ancestors.</p>
<p>It is on this note: the completion of a full cycle of relations between the Aryan religious groups, that we end this chapter on Aryan heritage &#8211; a heritage that started and ended in coexistence and cooperation.</p>
<h1>Western views on Aryans</h1>
<p>Philology and Linguistics</p>
<p><strong>Philology</strong> is the systematic study of the development and history of languages. <strong>Linguistics</strong> is the the study of the structure and development of a language and its relationship to other languages. Both philology and linguistics have been used to date works, construct the history of peoples, and to determine the so-called &#8216;racial&#8217; connections between peoples.</p>
<p>Attempts to Unlock the Mysteries of the Zoroastrian Texts</p>
<p>The Zoroastrian scriptures and commentaries, the <a href="http://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/overview/index.htm#texts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Avesta<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a><strong> </strong>and <strong>Zand </strong>respectively, had faithfully been preserved by priests and the laity memorizing the passages in the original languages. Nevertheless, by the 1700s, knowledge of the older languages of the Avesta, had largely been lost. What remained were the memorized texts and rough translations of previous translations. These translations were influenced by the opinions of their day.</p>
<p>Around the time when western travellers and authors such as <a href="http://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/westernauthors/index.htm#perron" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right"><strong>Anquetil du Perron</strong><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> (1731-1805) came across handwritten manuscripts of the Avesta, philology and linguistics had begun to emerge as disciplines. Western scholars enthusiastically began to reconstruct and retranslate the texts &#8211; a process that produced much debate and dissention. While considerable progress was made in uncovering the meaning of the Avestan texts, there is still considerable disagreement about the meaning of many Avestan words and passages. We may never recover the true meaning and wisdom of the older and more obscure passages.</p>
<p>On the one hand the technique of using knowledge of Sanskrit to understand the Avestan languages is clearly valid and has proved very valuable. On the other hand, however, the racial constructs employed by some philologists are full of bias and conjecture, and have resulted in great harm. These individuals, hungry to find some historical proof that European Christians were not Semites, but a separate and superior race, and that Christianity was not based on Semitic roots &#8211; appropriated the culture and history of the people of the Avesta, the <a href="http://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/aryans/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Aryans<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, for their own ends. They have used the power of the written word and the credibility of scholarship to create the illusion of fact out of fiction.</p>
<p>Are the Aryans a Racial or National Group?</p>
<p>When western philologists published their conclusions about the <a href="http://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/aryans/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Aryans<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> of the Avesta and <a href="http://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/aryans/religion2.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Rig Veda<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> (the earliest Hindu scriptures), together with their racial constructs, they fed a speculative frenzy about the Aryan peoples &#8211; much of it based on the desire of some Europeans to claim superiority over non-Europeans who were thus worthy of colonization and subjugation, or by Christians to claim racial separation from the Jews and other Semites.</p>
<p>Racialization</p>
<p>The racialization of the term Aryans, that is defining the word to mean a &#8220;race&#8221; of people and more specifically the &#8220;race&#8221; of so-called white-skinned people, otherwise erroneously known as Caucasians, has its roots in a construct by German anthropologist <strong>Christoph Meiners</strong> as outlined in his <em>The Outline of History of Mankind</em> (1785). The concept of &#8220;race&#8221; in his context does not just mean ethnicity or physical characteristics, but defines mental abilities, moral characteristics and superiority over other human beings. Meiners racialized human beings and then assigned them into races: Caucasians of whom the most racially pure were the &#8220;venerated&#8230; ancient Germans&#8221; and &#8220;Mongolians&#8221; who consisted of everyone else. He considered some Europeans to be impure &#8220;dirty whites&#8221;. Meiners excluded Jews from the Caucasian race and ascribed to them instead a &#8220;permanently degenerate nature&#8221;. Meiners claimed that Blacks (Negroes) felt less pain and lacked emotions since they had thick nerves; they had &#8220;no human (and) barely any animal feeling. In his book, he relates a story where a Black man, half way through the burning alive asked to smoke a pipe and smoked it like nothing was happening while he continued to burn. Blacks also had perverted sex drives according to Meiners while Whites had it just right.</p>
<p>In his 1853 <em>Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races</em>, French aristocrat <strong>Arthur de Gobineau</strong> (1816-82) further postulated that the &#8220;White&#8221; race represented a superior branch of humanity and that &#8220;Black&#8221;, &#8220;White&#8221;, and &#8220;Yellow&#8221; skins were natural barriers between the &#8220;races&#8221;, a position he claimed was supported by the Bible. He believed that &#8220;race-mixing&#8221; violates those natural barriers and leads to chaos.</p>
<p>The racialization of people is the bedrock of racism.</p>
<p>Racialization, Philology &amp; Max Müller</p>
<p>The racist speculations of Meiners and Gobineau were further justified by the so-called &#8220;science&#8221; some saw in the theories of philologists and linguists such as <strong>Max Müller</strong> (see note below*) &#8211; a theory that if languages were remotely connected by the presence of some words that are similar, then the people must have been connected &#8220;racially&#8221; in the distant past. A tool that had some credibility in establishing a connection between the peoples of the Avesta and Rig Veda was stretched to the limits of incredulity. The Aryans of the <a href="http://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/aryans/religion.htm#vedas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Vedas<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> and the Avesta provided these individuals with a convenient group with whom to claim a racial connection leading to the racialization of the term &#8220;Aryans&#8221;. Meiners&#8217; so-called Caucasians now had an additional racialized label, Aryans.</p>
<p>Caucasians &amp; Aryans</p>
<p>Caucasians by definition have their origins in the Caucasus mountain region just west of the Southern Caspian Sea, a handy launching point for a mythical migration of Aryans to Europe. Essential to the maintenance of this construct was the elaborate justification that the Aryans of the Avesta and Vedas also originated in the Caucasus Mountains. Central Asia did not appear to suit their purpose. Some who fancied this notion but who were not satisfied that the Aryans had migrated to Europe from Asia, claimed that the Aryans were native to Germany and that one branch had migrated the other way, that is, from Europe to Asia.</p>
<p>It is quite amazing how an entirely bogus concept based on a fallacy &#8211; that blue-eyed, blond haired Europeans have their origin in the Caucasus mountain region &#8211; is still currently used as a demographic and racial term, Caucasians (as is the use of the term &#8220;Indians&#8221; for aboriginal North Americans).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Language &amp; Race</p>
<p>The weakness of Max Müller&#8217;s hypothesis of an automatic connection between language and so-called &#8220;race&#8221; can be seen today in observing that most of the people who speak English have no racial connection &#8211; they have linguistic hegemony but anthropological (racial) diversity. Language connections can be spread by conquest, the imposition of a language (and religion) by conquerors, and through commerce &#8211; as well as other possibilities.</p>
<p>There are additional considerations. People who migrate do not necessarily maintain their language over successive generations especially when they are in the minority. The Zoroastrians of Iran who migrated to India, soon adopted the language of the province in which they lived and over generations forgot their native tongue. Nevertheless, they maintained a measure of ethnic/racial (sic) separation from the host population even though they spoke the same language.</p>
<p>A significant number of Arabic words found their way into Zoroastrian religious lexicon and there is no claim anywhere that this points to a racial connection. The reason uniformly given is that this incursion of Arabic words into the Zoroastrian lexicon resulted in the years after the Arab conquest of Iran.</p>
<p>Appropriation of a Heritage &amp; Indignity</p>
<p>One artificial construct regarding the Aryans has led to another and the facts have been skewed to fit this bias. At one extreme, Aryans had to have specific physical characteristics such as blonde hair and blue eyes &#8211; characteristics that would have excluded most, if not all, the original Aryans &#8211; a final indignity of the expropriation of their heritage.</p>
<p>There is no evidence whatsoever that the term Aryan is a racial term.</p>
<p>In the same manner that people from Iran are called Iranian, the Aryan people were the people of the Aryan nation, <a href="http://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/aryans/airyanavaeja.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Airyana Vaeja<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> &#8211; a relatively small country at its inception, and one that became the kingdom of Airan Vej, Airan and eventually Iran. The use of the word Aryan can be compared to the use of the word Iranian. The word Aryan is simply an older form of the word Iranian, and Iran is a multi-ethnic country.</p>
<p><a id="post-6917-legacy"></a> Max Müller&#8217;s Legacy</p>
<p>*Note: German born philologist and orientalist, <strong>Max Müller</strong> (1823-1900) is commonly identified as the first writer &#8211; European or otherwise &#8211; to speak of an Aryan &#8220;race&#8221;. In 1848, he settled in Oxford England and never visited India. In 1853 and again in his 1861 lecture titled <em>Science of Language</em>, Müller referred to the Aryans as a &#8220;race of people&#8221;. Even though Müller belatedly professed to backtrack from his racial assertions, unconvincingly saying that he had confined the use of &#8220;race&#8221; to mean &#8220;a group of tribes or peoples, an ethnic group&#8221; &#8211; it wasn&#8217;t long before Müller&#8217;s &#8220;Aryan race&#8221; was made synonymous with Meiners&#8217; and Gobineau&#8217;s &#8220;white race&#8221; together with all of Meiners&#8217; and Gobineau&#8217;s racist implications.</p>
<p>Müller wrote a laudatory preface to a book by French missionary <strong>Abbe Dubois</strong> (1765-1848), who wrote, &#8220;&#8230;to make a new race of the Hindus, one would have to undermine the very foundations of their civilization, religion and polity, and by turning them into atheists and barbarians. Having accomplished this terrible upheaval, we might then perhaps offer ourselves to them as lawgivers and religious teachers.&#8221; In his preface to Dubois&#8217; book, Müller extols the author as being &#8220;remarkably free from theological prejudice&#8221;.</p>
<p>In <em>History of Ancient Sanskrit Literature</em> (1860), Müller wrote, &#8220;History seems to teach that the whole human race required a gradual education before, in the fullness of time, it could be admitted to the truths of Christianity. All the fallacies of human reason had to be exhausted, before the light of a high truth could meet with ready acceptance.&#8221; In a letter to his wife Georgina, published in <em>The Life and Letters of Right Honourable Friedrich Max Müller</em> (1902) edited by Georgina Müller, Müller wrote, &#8220;The translation of the Veda will hereafter tell to a great extent on the fate of India and on the growth of millions of souls in that country. It is the root of their religion, and to show them what the root is, I feel sure, is the only way of uprooting all that has sprung from it during the last 3,000 years.&#8221; Müller wrote to the Duke of Argyll, then British Secretary of Education, &#8220;India has been conquered once, but India must be conquered again, and that second conquest should be a conquest by education.&#8221; It is within this context that Müller published his series, <em>The Sacred Books of the East</em> that included the Hindu Vedas and the Zoroastrian Avesta. Müller had scant respect for these texts. In another letter published by his wife he lists the superiority of one religious text over another, starting with the New Testament and Koran as the top two and several texts later ending with the Vedas and Avesta as the most inferior. (Source: <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Max_M%C3%BCller" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Wikiquote<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>)</p>
<p>French socialist and professor of anthropology at the University of Montpellier,<strong> Vacher de Lapouge</strong>(1854-1936) in his 1899 book <em>L&#8217;Aryen et son rôle social</em> (The Aryan and his Social Role), theorized that the superior Aryan race could be identified anthropologically by using the cephalic index (a measure of head shape), stating that the long-headed &#8220;dolichocephalic-blond&#8221; Europeans, characteristically found in northern Europe, were natural leaders, destined to rule over more &#8220;brachiocephalic&#8221; (short headed) peoples. The German origin of the Aryans was especially promoted by the archaeologist <strong>Gustaf Kossinna</strong> (1858-1931) deeply influencing Nazi ideology, who held <strong>Carl Schuchhardt</strong> (1859-1943) to be their official Nazi pre-historian.</p>
<p>The appropriation, theft and debasement of true Aryan identity did not stop with philologists, Nazis and other racists. <strong>Helena Blavatsky</strong>, a co-founder of the Theosophical movement expounded the fantastic notion that &#8220;The Aryan races, now varying from dark brown, almost black, red-brown-yellow, down to the whitest creamy colour,&#8221; are all part of &#8220;the Fifth Root-Race&#8221;, and (dear reader, the best is yet to come) &#8220;spring from one single progenitor,&#8221; who &#8220;lived over 18,000,000 years ago, and also 850,000 years ago &#8211; at the time of the sinking of the last remnants of the great continent of Atlantis!&#8221;</p>
<p>Regrettably, the legacy of Max Müller is that racialization (and by consequence racism) is latent in philology today.</p>
<p>Problems &amp; Bias in Reconstructing Aryan Prehistory</p>
<p>Paradoxically, there is a problem with western reconstruction of Aryan prehistory that emerges from the bias of an another camp and establishment in western scholarship.</p>
<p>Archaeological findings are often used to make categorical statements about the prehistory of a region and this is particularly true in the reconstruction of the prehistory of Central Asia and the Pamir region &#8211; the heartland of Aryan prehistory.</p>
<p>On the one hand, extremely poor and destructive archaeological techniques have been used by Russian and other western archaeologists, and on the other hand there is a strong bias amongst western archaeologists and historians in maintaining the Biblical lands as the cradle of civilization.</p>
<p>When <a href="http://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/nisa/anau.htm#pumpelly" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Raphael Pumpelly<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> (1837-1923). a geologist from New York, proposed that Central Asia might be a cradle of civilization rather than Sumer and Mesopotamia, he and his theories were largely ignored by the western archaeological establishment &#8211; even after Pumpelly conducted archaeological excavations in what is today Turkmenistan and produced evidence of an early civilization. Pumpelly was trying to tell the world that under the mounds &#8211; the tepes or depes that dotted the landscapes in the lower reaches of the Kopet Dag mountains &#8211; was evidence of a forgotten civilization and history waiting to be discovered. It was a history that would not be found in western history books, but in Zoroastrian and Hindu religious texts: the <a href="http://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/overview/index.htm#texts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Avesta<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> and Rig Veda.</p>
<p>When archaeologists categorically assign a historical time period or era based on incomplete archaeological findings from a particular area, they give the false impression that their assignment of time periods form the history of that region. They do not.</p>
<p>Time periods assigned to archaeological findings at best indicate the earliest findings uncovered so far. New discoveries, discoveries yet to be made, and evidence that has been destroyed completely, make the use of words such as &#8216;the earliest&#8217; hazardous. Further, civilizations do not appear out of thin air on a particular date in history. They take time to develop &#8211; perhaps thousands of years.</p>
<p>The focus on written history by Greek and western writers has diminished the role of oral history from other parts of the world. These writers consider eastern oral history to be more myth than history. The history in the Avesta for instance is primarily an oral history that was later put down into writing. There is a predisposed bias to discounting the accounts in the Avesta as myth even though the Avesta contains some of the earliest literature known to humankind.</p>
<h1>Pamir Region</h1>
<p>Pamir / Badakhshan Region</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>In the east of Tajikistan, are mountains and highlands known as the Pamirs. The Tajik province in which the mountains are located is called the <strong>Kuhistani-Badakhshan</strong> (previously called Gorno-Badakhshan, a name given during the Soviet occupation of Tajikistan). Kuhistani means the land of the mountains.</p>

<p>The full extent of the Badakhshan (also spelt Badakshan or Badakshon) region extends beyond the borders of Tajikistan to the east, south and south-west. To the east, Badakhshan extends into land that is today part of China. To the south and south-west, Badakhshan extends into modern-day Afghanistan (see map to the right).</p>
<p>China&#8217;s acquisition of eastern Badakhshan came about through centuries of westward expansion beyond ancient Chin and the borders of Chin marked by the Great Wall of China. The division of Badakhshan between Tajikistan and Afghanistan, was a result of the Anglo-Russian agreement of 1873 that created a buffer strip between the Russian and British empires.</p>
<p>In these pages, unless otherwise specified, we will be dealing with the full extent of Badakhshan which we will call Greater Badakhshan / Badakshan, Pamir-Badakhshan or the Pamir region.</p>
<p>Pamirs &amp; Zoroastrianism</p>
<p>The Pamir-Badakhshan region is home to very old Zoroastrian historical sites and most of the <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/tajikistan/page5.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Zoroastrian historical sites<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> we have identified so far in Tajikistan, are in the Badakhshan-Pamir region. There are also enigmatic hand and feet symbols carved into the rock of the Pamir mountains. The Pamiri consider the rocks holy, saying that holy men have stepped on these rocks in the remote past.</p>

<p>Badakhshan (Badakshan or Badakshon) is a relatively modern (1,500 year-old) name coined by the Persian <a href="http://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/history/timelines.htm#sassanian" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Sassanids<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> (c.200-650 CE). Since shan / shon means place (the forerunner of stan, cf. Khorasan), Badakhshan means the place of Badak or Badakh. It is not clear who or what Badakh means. Badakh might refer to the area&#8217;s precious stones.</p>
<p>As we have noted above, we find historic Greater Badakhshan divided between Tajikistan, Afghanistan, and China. The border between Tajikistan and Afghanistan is the Panj river where it forms the Wakhan valley. The border between Tajikistan and China is the Sarykol Range, one of the Kunlun mountain ranges.</p>
<p>Rather than their division by the relatively modern borders that were drawn up for political reasons, the extent of Greater Badakhshan is more accurately defined by the historic kinship of the Pamiri people and the Pamiri dialects they speak.</p>
<p>The Pamiri-Badakhshani people claim to be an Iranian group related to, but distinct from, the Tajiks and other Afghans. They speak dialects of the Pamiri language, an eastern Iranian language indigenous to the region. Tajiki, and the Afghan languages of Dari and Pashtu, are sister Iranian, i.e. Aryan, languages.</p>
<p>The extent of the Pamir-Badakhshan region as defined by the ethno-linguistic distribution of the Pamiri-Badakhshan dialects and people, is as follows (from <em>Atlas of Languages of Intercultural Communication in the Pacific, Asia, and the Americas</em> By Stephen Adolphe Wurm, Peter Mühlhäusler, Darrell T. Tyron, Darrell T. Tryon. International Council for Philosophy and Humanistic Studies. Pub. Walter de Gruyter, 1996):</p>
<p><strong>&#8211; In the east</strong> of the region, the Pamiri dialects of Sarikoli and Wakhi are spoken across the present Tajik-China border in the Xinjang (Xinjiang) / Kunlun Mountains. The Pamirs includes <strong>Tashkurgan</strong> and <strong>Kashgar</strong> / <strong>Kashi</strong> (presently in China) in the northeast corner (Photographs of <a href="http://www.uncorneredmarket.com/photos/set/72157603488808109/page1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" data-wpel-link="external">Kashgar<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>). The residents of Kashgar were known to have practiced Zoroastrianism and the ruins of a Zoroastrian temple can be found beside the ruins of an ancient fortress. Indeed, it is possible that some of the residents of areas in China that practice Islam today could have practiced Zoroastrianism in the past. The original Indo-Iranian inhabitants of this area have to a large extent been displaced by Turkic peoples. The Shahnameh of Ferdowsi placed Chin (China) to the east of Airan and also east of Turan (Sugd).</p>
<p><strong>&#8211; In the south</strong>, the Wakhi dialect is spoken in the <strong>Wakhan / Panj valley</strong> bordered by the Hindu Kush in the south [Ivan M. Steblin-Kamenskij at Iranica, Central Asia xiii. Iranian Languages, suggests that the name Wakhan i.e. Vah-kan, is derived from Old Iranian Wahwi/Wahkshu &#8211; &#8220;good, beneficent,&#8221; an ancient river name (cf. Av. Vanguhi Daitiia, the name of a river in Airiianem Vaejah]. The Wakhi dialect is also spoken in northern Pakistan. The Vendidad nation that would have bordered the Pamiri-Badakhshan region to the south would be the seventh nation of Vaekerata (Kabul).</p>
<p><strong>&#8211; In the west</strong>, the region continues to include the Panj valley as it turns north and includes lands further west, that is, the present Badakhshan province in Afghanistan. That province has its capital at Feyzabab (Faizabad) that sits of the Kokcha River. In ancient times, the Pamiri-Badakhshan lands would have extended west to the fourth Vendidad nation of Bakhdhi (Balkh).</p>

<p><strong>&#8211; In the north</strong>, the Pamir region is bounded by a tributary of the Amu Darya (Oxus) the Surkhab / Surkhob River and Kyrgyzstan&#8217;s Alai mountains. The Surkhab is renamed downstream as the Vakhsh and upstream as the Kyzylsu / Kysyl-suu River in Kyrgyzstan. Surkh-ab and Kyzyl-suu mean Red River. Reading the Vendidad&#8217;s list of nations, at the northern and north-western boundary of the Pamirs, we find Sughdha (Sugd) &#8211; the land and nation that extended from the Fergana valley in the east to Samarkand in the west and beyond.</p>
<p>Nowadays, while all Tajiks are mainly Muslim, the Pamiri continue to display their distinctiveness by following the Ismaili sect of the Shia religion while the rest of the Tajiks are for the most part, Sunni Muslims.</p>
<p>During Taliban rule of Afghanistan in the 1990s and early 2000s, Badakhshan was the only Afghan province not controlled by the Pashtu dominant Taliban. Badakhshan was also the base of the group opposed to the Taliban, the Northern Alliance, the group that ultimately defeated the Taliban. Today, while the rest of Afghanistan is still in turmoil, Afghani Badakhshan is relatively peaceful.</p>

<p>Tajiks call the Pamirs, Po-mir or Po-i-mihr, the <strong>Feet of Mitra</strong>, and also Bom-i-Dunyo, the Roof of the World. Mitra is an angel in Zoroastrianism and a pre-Zoroastrian Indo-Iranian deity, an <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/aryans/religion.htm#incorporation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">asura<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>.</p>
<p>The Pamirs are home to the tallest mountain in Tajikistan. The Somoni Peak in the northwest of the Pamirs has an elevation of 7,495 m (24,590 ft), and the average elevation of the Pamir peaks is about 3,965 m (about 13,000 ft).</p>
<p>The Pamirs are also called the Pamir knot since several mountain ranges radiate from the knot.</p>
<p>The Pamirs form a connecting link between the Tian Shan, Kunlun, Karakoram, Himalaya and Hindu Kush mountain ranges.</p>

<p><a id="post-6917-boundaries"></a> Topography of the Boundaries</p>
<p>The area defined by the Pamir-Badakhshan region is roughly a square, with each side of the square bounded by a major river and a mountain range. The shape and topography is unique. It is unlike any other region in the area.</p>
<p>The rivers were called daryas &#8211; rivers large enough to be considered a sea or perhaps rivers that were, in the past thought to be connected to seas. The rivers flow beyond in different directions. Mountains ranges also radiate in different directions.</p>
<p>The Pamirs, the Himalayas and the other mountain ranges at the north of the Indian subcontinent were formed by the subduction of the Indian subcontinent plate under the Eurasian plate. The result is that earthquakes in the Pamirs are frequent and violent. Pamiri houses are constructed to cope with earthquakes. Hot springs are numerous and the tectonic forces have created gemstones and precious metals that are buried in the mountains.</p>
<p>The Pamir&#8217;s deposits of precious stones and metals that correspond to those described as being contained in Mount Meru, the mountain that stood at the centre of the world, in the Hindu scripture, the Vedas. Mount Meru is the equivalent of the Mount Hara Berezaiti, Airyana Vaeja&#8217;s central mountain mentioned Zoroastrian scriptures, the Avesta. In the Vedas, Mount Meru is described as a four sided mountain where the four sides are made from four different precious substances: the south of lapis-lazuli, the west of ruby, the north of gold and the east of silver (or crystal).</p>
<p>The mountains in the south of the Pamir region do indeed contain the only lapis lazuli mines known in antiquity. The other Mount Meru precious metals and stones are also found in the region (see <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/tajikistan/page3.htm#trade" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">trade<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> and <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/tajikistan/page3.htm#bazardara" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">mines<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> below).</p>

<p>From the southeast corner to the southwest corners of the Pamir-Badakhshan region, lie the Silk Road passes that provide access to the Upper Indus region and from there &#8211; the Indus plains &#8211; <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/aryans/airyanavaeja.htm#hindu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Hapta Hindu<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>(seven Indus tributaries). In the southeast corner are three passes within 100 km of each other that connect the Tamrim Basin Kashgar and Tashkurgan (today, in Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region in China) to the Gojal / Hunza River valley, Gilgit and the Upper Indus valley: from east to west, the <strong>Kunjarab Pass</strong> (4,693 m./15,397 ft.) and two ancient passes, the <strong>Mintaka</strong> (4,709 m./15,450 ft.) and <strong>Kilik</strong> (4,827 m./15,837 ft.) passes. Kunjarab come from the Wakhi Pamiri word for blood valley. Ancient traders travelled 70 km south from Tashkurgan to the Mintaka River, and from there headed some 80 km west up the Mintaka valley and pass. In the central south of the Pamirs lies the <strong>Baroghil / Broghol Pass</strong> (3,798 m./12,460 ft.) through the Hindu Kush. In the southwest corner lies the <strong>Dorah Pass</strong> (4,300 m./14,000 ft.) that today connects Badakhshan in Afghanistan with Chitral in Pakistan.</p>

Ancient Mesopotamian Materials and Industries by Peter Roger Stuart Moorey, p. 86). Marco Polo visited the Sar-i Sang mines during his travels along the Silk Road. The area is rich in other gemstones such as rubies and emeralds and precious metals such as silver and gold that were actively traded throughout the ages (see <a href="http://www.thegemhunter.net/cgi-bin/slidindx.pl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" data-wpel-link="external">Gem Hunter<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> site). One of the Pamiri settlements that centred around silver mining, <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/tajikistan/page3.htm#bazardara" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Bazar-Dara<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, is described below.</p>
<p>Many of the trade roads to the upper Indus and Kashmir valleys in the adjacent Indian sub-continent, including branches of the Silk Roads to the east and west, passed through the Wakhan corridor. This gave the Badakhshanis access to the Indian sub-continent. It also gave them a controlling position of the trade roads and one of the Zoroastrian era forts called the <a href="https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/tajikistan/page5.htm#yamchun" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Zamr-i-Atish-Parast<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, or Fortress of the Fire Worshippers, at Yamchun served this function. It also formed a second line of defence for the Pamir / Badakhshan region to the north, the first line of defence being the Hindu Kush mountains.</p>

<p>In the central Pamirs, above the banks of the river Ak-Dzhilga / Ak-Jilga, in the valley of Murghab, are the remains of remote settlements and a mining complex called Bazar-Dara and Ak-Jilga. The Badakhshan region has historically been famous from Egypt to China, the steppes to India for its gems and precious metals. Silver was mined in Bazar-Dara and traders who plied the Silk Roads came to Bazar-Dara and stayed in its caravanserai while conducting their business. The settlements and mining complex are located at a height of 4,000 m. The six sites, accessible only by foot or helicopter, are dated 10th to 11th century ACE in the middle valley, and 5th century BCE in the upper valley.</p>
<p>About 1,200 &#8211; 1,500 people lived in the settlement which included an administrative complex, a fire-temple, and a bath with sub-floor (kan) heating. The size fits the first level of a Jamshidi Vara (see above).</p>
<p>Water was obtained from small wells and skilfully designed water basins. In this region, the soil is frozen most of the year and trees cannot grow. The large building that is believed to have functioned as a medieval caravanserai, also has Vara-like features.</p>
