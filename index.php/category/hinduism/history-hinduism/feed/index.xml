										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The antics of Adi Shankara in the 8th century assuming he was born in 788 and died in 820 CE are well known and part of history. Sankara postulated the Vedas as authority; and hence was ranked as a Sanatani. Later on, the priestly class appropriated this and Max Muller called it Hinduism. Thus Hinduism dates back to to the 8th century.<br />
<span id="more-2660"></span><br />
He was the arch foe of Buddhism and the principal architect of its downfall in India (Pande 1994: p. 255). Adi Shankara, along with Madhva and Ramanuja, was instrumental in the revival of Hinduism through aggressive and violent means.<br />
The historians like Vincent Smith suggested that it was due to <a title="Adi Shankara" href="http://pakistanpatriot.com/Bao" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right"><span style="color:black;text-decoration:underline;">Adi Sankaracharya</span><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> there was<a title="Decline of Buddhism in India" href="http://pakistanpatriot.com/raB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right"><span style="color:black;text-decoration:underline;">decline of Buddhism in India</span><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. Others argue that it was due to the Muslim invasion (of Bakhtyar) that Nalanda was routed and the library there was burned and thousands of Buddha viharas were destroyed subsequently. Much of this is described in The Book of Thoth(Leaves of Wisdom).<br />
<a title="Shashanka" href="http://pakistanpatriot.com/sb" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right"><span style="color:black;text-decoration:underline;">Shashanka</span><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> was the Shaivite Brahmin king of Bengal. He was manipulated by the Brahmins to become a ferocious oppressor of the Buddhists. He had destroyed the Bodhi tree of Bodh Gaya and ordered the mass destruction of all Buddhist images and monasteries in his kingdom.<br />

Prof. P. Sankaranarayanan in his article The life and work of Sri Sankara published in the web page of Kanchi Mutt writes: &#8220;Buddhism, the rebel child of the Vedic religion and philosophy, denied God and the soul, laid the axe at the very roots of Vedic thought and posed a great danger to its very survival. This onslaught was stemmed occasionally, compelling Buddhism to seek refuge in other lands. While the credit for this should go primarily to the Mimamsaka, Kumarila Bhatta, it was because of Sri Sankara&#8217;s dialectical skill and irrefutable arguments that it ceased to have sway over the minds of the inheritors of Vedic religion.&#8221;<br />
The hold of Buddhism on the masses of India could be seen from the writing of celebrated Chinese pilgrim Faxian (334-420 AD). He made a journey that marked the high point of the first wave of Chinese pilgrims in India. He left China in 399 AD and returned in 414 AD. We see that even two centuries later the religion was hardly weakened as may be gleaned from the detailed historic accounts of the reign of Harshavardhana (606-647AD). The sources for such accounts are: coins and inscriptions, the reports of pilgrims, official Chinese documents and writings by well-known personalities like the Chinese traveler<a title="Xuanzang" href="http://pakistanpatriot.com/IB" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right"><span style="color:black;text-decoration:underline;">Huien Tsang</span><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>.<br />
Though a Hindu, King Harshavardhana maintained an impartial tolerance towards the other religions, especially Buddhism that at that time was the religion of the common masses. To honor Huien Tsang, a devout student Buddhist theology and admirer of the holy land of Buddha, Harshavardhana organized the Kanauj Assembly in 643 AD. This was a grand assembly of many rajas including King Bhaskaravarman of Kamrupa (Assam) and the Vallabhi king, Dhuvabhatti. The Assembly at Kanauj included a large congregation of Brahmans, Buddhist monks ands Jains, who were involved in religious discourses. We should not forget to mention that Huien Tsang, along with thousands of students from many countries, studied in the well-known Buddhist university of Nalanda. If so, how could the religion that Sankara opposed and helped drive out of India flourish<br />
T1) The Divyavadana (ed. Vaidya, 282). The most important of the murderous Hindu bigots who carried out their systematic campaign of violence against the peaceful followers of <a title="Gautama Buddha" href="http://pakistanpatriot.com/Xe" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right"><span style="color:black;text-decoration:underline;">Lord Buddha</span><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>was <a title="Pusyamitra Sunga" href="http://pakistanpatriot.com/Ykv" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right"><span style="color:black;text-decoration:underline;">Pushyamitra</span><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> (184-48 B.C.), the founder of the Shunga dynasty. For details and refrences do see below<br />
2) Goyal [430] &#8220;The culprit in this case was Toramana, a member of the same dynasty as the Shaivite Mihirakula who did &#8220;immense damage to the Buddhist shrines in Gandhara, Punjab and Kashmir.&#8221; For details and refrences do see BELOW<br />
3) Mihirakula is said to have razed 1600 viharas, stupas and monasteries, and &#8220;put to death 900 Kotis, or lay adherents of Buddhism&#8221; [Joshi, 404].<br />
4) The Aryamanjushrimulakalpa tells us that Pushyamitra &#8220;destroyed monasteries with relics and killed monks of good conduct.&#8221; [Jayaswal, 18-19]
5) As Goyal [394] notes, &#8220;According to many scholars hostility of the Brahmanas was one of the major causes of the decline of Buddhism in India.&#8221;<br />
6) The celebrated Tibetan historian Lama Taranatha mentions the march of Pushyamitra from Madhyadesha to Jalandhara. In the course of his campaigns, the book states, Pushyamitra burned down numerous Buddhist monasteries and killed a number of learned monks The archaeological evidence for the ravages wrought by Pushyamitra and other Hindu fanatic rulers on famous Buddhist shrines is abundant.<br />
7) The Brhannaradiya-purana lays it down as a principal sin for a Brahmana to enter the house of a Buddhist even in times of great peril.<br />
8) The drama Mrchchhakatika shows that in Ujjain the Buddhist monks were despised and their sight was considered inauspicious.<br />
9) The Vishnupurana (XVIII 13-18) also regards the Buddha as Mayamoha who appeared in the world to delude the demons. Kumarila is said to have instigated King Sudhanvan of Ujjain to exterminate the Buddhists.<br />
10) The Kerala-utpatti describes how he exterminated the Buddhists from Kerala.&#8221;<br />
11) The Chinese traveller Yuan Chwang (Huen Tsang), who visited India in the seventh century records the oppressions of Shashanka, the king of Gauda, who was a devotee of Shiva.<br />
12) Yuan Chwang&#8217;s account reads, &#8220;In recent times Shashanka, the enemy and oppressor of Buddhism, cut down the Bodhi tree, destroyed its roots down to the water and burned what remained.&#8221; [Watters II p.115] He also says that Shashanka tried &#8220;to have the image (of Lord Buddha at Bodhgaya) removed and replaced by one of Shiva&#8221;.<br />
13) Another independent account of Shashanka&#8217;s oppressions is found in the Aryamanjushrimulakalpa, which refers to Shashanka destroying &#8220;the beautiful image of Buddha&#8221; [Jayaswal, 49-50].<br />
14) Another prominent seventh century murderer of Buddhists was Sudhanvan of Ujjain, already mentioned in the quotation from Goyal above as having been supposedly instigated by <a title="Kum?rila Bha??a" href="http://pakistanpatriot.com/kzb" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right"><span style="color:black;text-decoration:underline;">Kumarila Bhatt</span><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>.<br />
15) Madhava Acharya, in his &#8220;Sankara-digvijayam&#8221; of the fourteenth century A.D., records that Suddhanvan &#8220;issued orders to put to death all the Buddhists from Ramesvaram to the Himalayas&#8221;.<br />
16) Even after the <a title="Muslim conquest in the Indian subcontinent" href="http://pakistanpatriot.com/ISn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right"><span style="color:black;text-decoration:underline;">Islamic invasions of India</span><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, Hindu bigotry and hatred for Buddhists was not subdued. According to Sharmasvamin, a Tibetan pilgrim who visited Bihar three decades after the invasion of Bakhtiaruddin Khilji in the 12th century, the biggest library at Nalanda was destroyed by Hindu mendicants who took advantage of the chaos produced by the invasion.<br />
He says that &#8220;they (Hindus) performed a Yajna, a fire sacrifice, and threw living embers and ashes from the sacrifice into the Buddhist temples. This produced a great conflagration which consumed Ratnabodhi, the nine-storeyed library of the Nalanda University&#8221;. [Prakash, 213]. Numerous destroyed Buddhist shrines were converted into Hindu temples after their destruction.<br />
17) Ahir [58] notes that &#8220;The Seat of Buddha&#8217;s Enlightenment was in the possession of a Hindu Mahant till 1952.<br />
18) Similarly, at Kushinara, where the Buddha had entered into Mahaparinirvana, the cremation stupa had been converted into a Hindu temple, and on top of it stood the temple of Rambhar Bhavani when Cunningham discovered the site in 1860-61.<br />
19) Among the shrines which still continue to be dedicated to Hindu gods mention may be made of the Caityas of Chezrala and Ter in Andhra Pradesh which are now Shiva and Vishnu temples respectively.<br />
20) The temple of Madhava at Sal Kusa, opposite Gauhati in Asam, was once a sacred shrine of the Buddhists. …<br />
21) And the famous Jagannatha temple at Puri in Orissa was also originally a Buddhist shrine.<br />
22) Similarly, the Vishnupada temple at Gaya was also once a Buddhist shrine.&#8221; As Rajendralal Mitra notes in his famous work of 1878 [quoted in Ahir, 59] the feet of Buddha at Gaya were rechristened the feet of Vishnu and held as the most sacred object of worship in the new Vishnupada temple.<br />
23) According to the records of Hieun Tsang and Kalhana&#8217;s Rajaatarangini, Asoka the great repented, converted to Buddhism (273-232 BC) and did a lot for Buddhism. Asoka renounced violence, and renounced his religion after the Kalinga war, and he became a Buddhist. During Asoka, Buddhism had become the state religion. The Brahmans did not like him, and many historians think the Brahaman opposition to Asoka led to the destruction of the Muyarian dynasty says the following about the Kushans (emphasis is mine and not Nehru&#8217;s): &#8221; This Kushan Empire is interesting in many ways. IT WAS A BUDDHIST EMPIRE, and one of its famous rulers-the Emperor Kanishka-was ardently devoted to the dharma…the Kushans were Mongolians or closely allied to them. From the Kushan capital there must have been a continuous coming and going to the Mongolian homelands, and Buddhist learning and Buddhist culture must have gone to China and Mongolia…the Kushan Empire sat like a colossus astride the back of Asia, in between the Greaco-Roman world in the south. It was a halfway house both between India, and Rome, and India and China. The Kushan period corresponded with the last days of the Roman Republic when Julius Ceaser was alive, and first 200 years of the Roman Empire<br />
25) THE HINDU KASHATRIYA HINDU AND BUDDHIST WARS<br />
Jawarhalal Nehru in his book Glimpses of World History says (Page 103 and 104) &#8220;Chandragupta proclaimed his holy war &#8220;against all foreign rulers in India. The Kashatriyas and the Aryan aristocracy, deprived of their power and positions by the aliens (Kushans), were at the back of this war. After a dozen or so years of fighting, Chandragupta managed to gain control over Northern India including what is now called UP. He then crowned himself king of kings. Thus began the Gupta dynasty. It was a period of somewhat aggressive Hinduism and nationalism. The foreign rulers-the Turkis and Parathions and other Non-Aryans were rooted our and forcibly removed. We thus find racial antagonism at work. The Indo-Aryan aristocrat was proud of his race and looked down upon these barbarians and malachas. Indo-Aryan States and rulers were conquered by the Guptas were dealt with leniently, But there was not leniency for non-Aryans.<br />
26) Jawarhalal Nehru in his book Glimpses of World History says &#8220;Chandragupta&#8217;s son Samadugupta was an even more aggressive fighter than his father….the Kushans were pushed back across the Indus…Samadugupta&#8217;s son, Chandragupta II was also a warrior king, and he conquered Kathiwad and Gujrat, which had been under the rule of a Saka or Turki dynasty for a long time. He took the name Vikramaditya…..The Gupta period was a period of Hindu imperialism in India. There was a great revival of old Aryan culture and Sanskrit learning. The Hellenistic, or Greek and Mongolian elements in Indian life and culture which had been brought by the Greeks, Kushans and others were not encouraged, and were in fact deliberately superseded by laying stress on the Indo-Aryan traditions. Sanskrit was the official court language. But EVEN IN THOSE DAYS SANSKRIT WAS NOT THE COMMON LANGUAGE OF THE PEOPLE.<br />
The spoken language was a form of Prakrit….Kalidasa belonged to this period ……………. Samadragupta changed the capital of his empire from Pataliputra (Peshawar) to Ayodhia. Perhaps he felt that Ayodhiya<br />
offered a more suitable outlook–with its story of Ramachandra immortalized in Valmikis epic.<br />
27) HINDU BUDDHIST CONFLICT<br />
Jawarhalal Nehru in his book Glimpses of World History says &#8220;The Gupta revival of Aryanism and Hinduism was naturally not very favorably inclined towards Buddhism. This was partly because this movement was aristocratic, with the Kashatriya chiefs backing it, and Buddhism had more democracy in it; partly because the Mahayana form of Buddhism was closely associated with the Kushans and other alien rulers of northern India….but Buddhism declined in India…Chandragupta the first was a contemporary of Constantine the great, the Roman Emperor who founded Constantinople. &#8221;<br />
The Buddha was a true revolutionary—and his crusade against Brahminical supremacy won him his most ardent followers from among the oppressed castes. The Buddha challenged the divinity of the Vedas, the bedrock of Brahminism. He held that all men are equal and that the caste system or varnashramadharma, to which the Vedas and Other Brah&#8217;minical&#8217; books had given religious sanction, was completely false. Thus, in the Anguttara Nikaya, the Buddha is said to have exhorted the Bhikkus, saying,<br />
&#8220;Just, O brethren, as the great rivers, when they have emptied themselves into the Great Ocean, lose their different names and are known as the Great Ocean Just so, O brethren, do the four varnas—Kshatriya, Brahmin, Vaishya and Sudra—when they begin to follow the doctrine and discipline propounded by the Tathagata [i.e. the Buddha], renounce the different names of caste and rank and become the members of one and the same society.&#8221;<br />
The Buddha&#8217;s fight against Brahminism won him many enemies from among the Brahmins. They were not as greatly opposed to his philosophical teachings as they were to his message of universal brotherhood and equality for it directly challenged their hegemony and the scriptures that they had invented to legitimize this. To combat Buddhism and revive the tottering Brahminical hegemony, Brahminical revivalists resorted to a three-pronged strategy.<br />
Firstly, they launched a campaign of hatred and persecution against the Buddhists. Then, they appropriated many of the finer aspects of Buddhism into their own system so as to win over the &#8220;lower&#8221; caste Buddhist masses, but made sure that this selective appropriation did not in any way undermine Brahminical hegemony. The final stage in this project to wipeout Buddhism was to propound and propagate the myth that the Buddha was merely another &#8216;incarnation&#8217; (avatar) of the Hindu god Vishnu. Buddha was turned into just another of the countless deities of the Brahminical pantheon. The Buddhists were finally absorbed into the caste system, mainly as Shudras and &#8216;Untouchables&#8217;, and with that the Buddhist presence was completely obliterated from the land of its birth. Dr. Bhimrao Ambedkar writes in his book, The Untouchables, that the ancestors of today&#8217;s Dalits were Buddhists who were reduced to the lowly status of &#8216;untouchables&#8217; for not having accepted the supremacy of the Brahmins. They were kept apart from other people and were forced to live in ghettos of their own. Being treated worse that beasts of burden and forbidden to receive any education, these people gradually lost touch with Buddhism, but yet never fully reconciled themselves to the Brahminical order. Many of them later converted to Islam, Sikhism and Christianity in a quest for liberation from the Brahminical religion.<br />
To lend legitimacy to their campaign against Buddhism, Brahminical texts included fierce strictures against Buddhists. Manu, in his Manusmriti, laid down that, &#8220;If a person touches a Buddhist […] he shall purify himself by having a bath.&#8221; Aparaka ordained the same in his Smriti. Vradha Harit declared entry into a Buddhist temple a sin, which could only be expiated for by taking a ritual bath. Even dramas and other books for lay people written by Brahmins contained venomous propaganda against the Buddhists. In the classic work, Mricchakatika, (Act VII), the hero Charudatta, on seeing a Buddhist monk pass by, exclaims to his friend Maitriya— &#8220;Ah! Here is an inauspicious sight, a Buddhist monk coming towards us.&#8221;<br />
The Brahmin Chanakya, author of Arthashastra, declared that, &#8220;When a person entertains in a dinner dedicated to gods and ancestors those who are Sakyas (Buddhists), Ajivikas, Shudras and exiled persons, a fine of one hundred panas shall be imposed on him.&#8221; Shankaracharaya, the leader of the Brahminical revival, struck terror into the hearts of the Buddhists with his diatribes against their religion.<br />
The simplicity of the Buddha&#8217;s message, its stress on equality and its crusade against the bloody and costly sacrifices and ritualism of Brahminism had attracted the oppressed casts in large numbers. The Brahminical revivalists understood the need to appropriate some of these finer aspects of Buddhism and discarded some of the worst of their own practices so as to be able to win over the masses back to the Brahminical fold. Hence began the process of the assimilation of Buddhism by Brahminism.<br />
The Brahimns, who were once voracious beef-eaters, turned vegetarian, imitating the Buddhists in this regard. Popular devotion to the Buddha was sought to be replaced by devotion to Hindu gods such as Rama and Krishna. The existing version of the Mahabharata was written in the period in which the decline of Buddhism had already begun, and it was specially meant for the Shudras, most of whom were Buddhists, to attract them away from Buddhism. Brahminism, however, still prevented the Shudras from having access to the Vedas, and the Mahabharata was possibly written to placate the Buddhist Shudras and to compensate them for this discrimination.<br />
The Mahabharata incorporated some of the humanistic elements of Buddhism to win over the Shudras, but, overall, played its role of bolstering the Brahminical hegemony rather well. Thus, Krishna, in the Gita, is made to say that a person ought not to violate the &#8220;divinely ordained&#8221; law of caste. Eklavya is made to slice off his thumb by Drona, who is finds it a gross violation of dharma that a mere tribal boy should excel the Kshatriya Arjun in archery.<br />
The various writer of the puranas, too, carried on this systematic campaign of hatred, slander and calumny against the Buddhists. The Brahannardiya Purana made it a principal sin for Brahmins to enter the house of a Buddhist even in times of great peril. The Vishnu Purana dubs the Buddha as Maha Moha or &#8216;the great seducer&#8217;. It further cautions against the &#8220;sin of conversing with Buddhists&#8221; and lays down that &#8220;those who merely talk to Buddhist ascetics shall be sent to hell.&#8221;<br />
In the Gaya Mahatmaya, the concluding section of the Vayu Purana, the town of Gaya is identified as Gaya Asura, a demon who had attained such holiness that all those who saw him or touched him went straight to heaven. Clearly, this &#8216;demon&#8217; was none other the Buddha who preached a simple way for all, including the oppressed castes, to attain salvation. The Vayu Purana story goes on to add that Yama, the king of hell, grew jealous at this, possibly because less people were now entering his domains. He appealed to the gods to limit the powers of Asura Gaya. This the gods, led by Vishnu, were able to do by placing a massive stone on the &#8220;demon&#8217;s&#8221; head. This monstrous legend signified the ultimate capture of Budhdhism&#8217;s most holy centre by its most inveterate foes.<br />
Kushinagar, also known as Harramba, was one of the most important Buddhist centres as the Buddha breathed his last there. The Brahmins, envious of the prosperity of this pilgrim town and in order to discourage people from going there, invented the absurd theory that one who dies in Harramba goes to hell, or is reborn as an ass, while he who dies in Kashi, the citadel of Brahminism, goes straight to heaven. So pervasive was the belief in this bizarre theory that when the Sufi saint Kabir died in 1518 AD at Maghar, not far from Kushinagar, some of his Hindu followers refused to erect any memorial in his honor there and instead set up one at Kashi. Kabir&#8217;s Muslim followers were less superstitious. They set up a tomb for him at Maghar itself.<br />
In addition to vilifying the fair name of the Buddha, the Brahminical revivalists goaded Hindu kings to persecute and even slaughter innocent Buddhists. Sasanka, the Shaivite Brahmin king of Bengal, murdered the last Buddhist emperor Rajyavardhana, elder brother of Harshavardhana, in 605 AD and then marched on to Bodh Gaya where he destroyed the Bodhi tree under which the Buddha had attained enlightenment. He forcibly removed the Buddha&#8217;s image from the Bodh Vihara near the tree and installed one of Shiva in its place.<br />
Finally, Sasanka is said to have slaughtered all the Buddhist monks in the area around Kushinagar. Another such Hindu king was, Mihirakula, a Shaivite, who is said to have completely destroyed over 1500 Buddhist shrines. The Shaivite Toramana is said to have destroyed the Ghositarama Buddhist monastery at Kausambi.<br />
The extermination of Buddhism in India was hastened by the large-scale destruction and appropriation of Buddhist shrines by the Brahmins. The Mahabodhi Vihara at Bodh Gaya was forcibly converted into a Shaivite temple, and the controversy lingers on till this day. The cremation stupa of the Buddha at Kushinagar was changed into a Hindu temple dedicated to the obscure deity with the name of Ramhar Bhavani. Adi Shankara is said to have established his Sringeri Mutth on the site of a Buddhist monastery which he took over. Many Hindu shrines in Ayodhya are said to have once been Buddhist temples, as is the case with other famous Brahminical temples such as those at Sabarimala, Tirupati, Badrinath and Puri.<br />

<span style="color:#0070c0;">Which is more deplorable: destruction of Buddhism in its own birth place in ancient India by Hindus, or of Buddha statues by present day Islamic Talibans in Afghanistan?<br />
</span><br />
<span id="more-5643"></span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Two well known academicians of Kerala &#8211; Prof KM Bahauddin, former pro-vice chancellor of Aligarh Muslim and Osmania universities, and Dr MS Jayaprakash, professor of history at Kollam &#8211; throw some deep insights into the dark history of India when Buddhism was systematically eliminated by Brahminical forces who control Hinduism, then and now.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Says Jayaprakash: &#8216;The ruthless demolition of Buddha statues by Taliban has courted severe criticism from different quarters of the world. Surprisingly, the BJP-led Indian Government, supported by all Hindutva forces, also condemned the Taliban action. It is a paradox that the forerunners of the present Hindutva forces in India had wantonly destroyed not only Buddhist statues but also killed Buddhists in India. Therefore, any impartial student of history would unequivocally say that these Hindutva forces have no moral right to criticize Taliban now.&#8217;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
He elaborates: &#8216;Hundreds of Buddhist statues, stupas and viharas have been destroyed in India between 830 and 966 AD in the name of Hindu revivalism. Both literary and archaeological sources within and outside India speak volumes about the havoc done to Buddhism by Hindu fanatics. Spiritual leaders like Sankaracharya and many Hindu kings and rulers took pride in demolishing Buddhist images aiming at the total eradication of Buddhist culture. Today, their descendants destroyed the Babri Masjid and also published the list of mosques to be targeted in future. It is with this sin of pride that they presently condemn Taliban.&#8217;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Prof. Bahauddin elaborates the selfish compulsions of Brahminism to wipe-out Buddhism: &#8216;Buddhism tried to create a dynamic society in ancient India. Jainism also contributed its share. As Buddhism spread, iron ploughs and implement were used for development of agriculture. As a result, new areas were cultivated and agricultural productivity increased, apart from developing trade centres and road links. Subsistence-level economy changed to a surplus economy with grain storage facilities, exchange of goods, trade and development of bureaucratic administration. This also created social change &#8211; from elans consisting several families to tribes consisting several elans of similar socio-economic conditions. The emphasis of Brahmins, on the other hand, was for receiving and giving alms and not on production of goods. Those who give and receive alms were close to Gods and those who produce were considered as inferior. According to Manusmriti, a Sudra should not have wealth of his own. In case he has any, a Brahmin as his master can take it over without any hesitation. &#8216;Rigveda&#8217; goes a step further to kill those who do not give &#8216;danam&#8217; to the Brahmins. In other words, someone has to produce goods so that others can give &#8216;danam&#8217; to the recipient Brahmins. It was against this system of &#8216;downgrading those who produce&#8217; that Buddhism came into being.&#8217;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Recalls Dr. Jayaprakash: &#8216;The Hindu ruler Pushyamitra Sunga had destroyed 84,000 Buddhist stupas which were built by Emperor Ashoka. This was followed by the demolition of Buddhist centres in Magadha. Thousands of Buddhist saints were killed mercilessly. King Jalaluka destroyed the Buddha viharas within his jurisdiction on the ground that chanting of hymns by Buddhists disturbed his sleep! In Kashmir, King Kinnara demolished thousands of viharas and captured the Buddhist villages to please Brahmins. A large number of Buddha viharas were usurped by Brahmins and converted into Hindu temples where entry of &#8216;untouchables&#8217; was prohibited. Notably, Buddhist places were regularized as Hindu temples by writing Puranas, which were invented myths or pseudo history. The important temples at Tirupathi, Aihole, Undavalli, Ellora, Bengal, Puri, Badarinath, Mathura, Ayodhya, Sringeri, Bodhigaya, Saranath, Delhi, Nalanda, Gudimallam, Nagarjunakonda, Srisailam and Sabarimala are some of the striking examples of Brahminical usurpation of Buddhist centres.&#8217;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Detailing the divergence in both orientation and essence between Buddhism and Hinduism, Prof. Bahauddin says: &#8216;Equality, compassion, non-violence, utilization of human abilities for general welfare, etc. were the cardinal principles of Buddhism. According to &#8216;Sathpatha Brahmanam (22-6, 3-4-14), on the other hand, the whole universe is controlled by God, God is controlled by Mantram and Mantram is with Brahmins and, therefore, Brahmins are God (on earth). They used Mantram and Sapam to instil fear in the people to obey them, while Buddhism encouraged people to observe visible facts, to apply reason to get out of fear. Buddhism also encouraged people to do good things, besides guiding Kings to look after the people&#8217;s welfare. Buddhism considers the general welfare of the people, while Brahminism considers that the whole world was created for them all along. And, there is bound to be conflict between these two opposite ways of thinking.&#8217;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
According to Dr Jayaprakash, Sakaracharya had played &#8216;a demon&#8217;s role&#8217; in destruction of Buddhist statues and monuments at Nagarjunakonda (in present-day Andhra Pradesh). &#8216;A. N. Longhurst, who conducted excavations at Nagarjunakonda, had recorded this in his invaluable book, Memoirs of the Archaeological Survey of India No. 54, The Buddhist Antiquities of Nagarjunakonda (Delhi, 1938, p. 6). The ruthless manner in which all the buildings at Nagarjunakonda have been destroyed is simply appalling and cannot represent the work of treasure-seekers alone since so many pillars, statues, and sculptures have been wantonly smashed to pieces. Local tradition relates that the great Hindu philosopher and teacher, Sankaracharya, came to Nagarjunakonda with a host of followers and destroyed the Buddhist monuments. The cultivated lands on which ruined buildings stand represent a religious grant made to Sankaracharya.&#8217;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Quoting Dr. B. R. Ambedkar, Prof. Bahauddin says that the conflict against Brahmin supremacy had, in fact, started before Buddhist period, between Vasishta Muni, a Brahmin, and Viswamitra, a non-Brahmin. &#8216;The dispute was about the learning of &#8216;Vedas&#8217;, the right to conduct religious ceremony, to receive gifts, and to perform coronation of King. Vasishta Muni insisted that these were the exclusive privileges of Brahmins, while Viswamitra was opposed to such exclusive rights. This dispute lasted for long period, and even Kings joined in it (Writings and Speeches of Dr. Ambedkar, vol. 7, p. 148-155. It was won by Brahmins.&#8217;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Prof. Bahauddin lists the different stages of Brahmin hostility against Buddhism: &#8216;1) 483-273 BC: The period after Buddha&#8217;s death upto Ashoka&#8217;s rule when attempts were made to include Brahminical ideas in Buddhist ideology. 2) 273-200 BC: When Buddhism spread all over India and became a world religion. 3) 200 BC-500 AD: The period when all possible efforts were made to disintegrate Buddhism from within by adulterating Buddhist teachings with Brahminical ideas and also through physical annihilation from outside. As a result, Buddhism divided itself into 18 sects, of which Hinayana and Mahayana were prominent ones. 4) 500-700 AD: Brahminism gained supremacy in North India and efforts began to drive out Buddhism and Jainism from South India. 5) 700-1100 AD: Brahminism gained supremacy in South India and, with added vigour, it moved again to North India to obtain complete supremacy over Buddhism and Jainism. 6) 1100-1400 AD: Buddhism and Jainism were destroyed from the remaining Southern States of Karnataka and Kerala and, thus, total supremacy of Brahminism all over India was achieved.&#8217;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Adds Dr. Jayaprakash: &#8216;Within Kerala, Sankaracharya and his close associate Kumarila Bhatta, an avowed foe of Buddhism, organized a religious crusade against Buddhists. A vivid description of Sankaracharya&#8217;s pleasure of seeing people of non-Brahminic faith being burnt to death is available in &#8216;Sankara Digvijaya&#8217;. Kumarila instigated King Suddhanvan of Ujjain to exterminate Buddhists. The &#8216;Mricchakatika&#8217; of Sudraka describes how the King&#8217;s brother-in-law in Ujjain inhumanly tortured the Buddhist monks, by using them as bullocks by inserting a string through their nose and yoking them to the cart! The &#8216;Keralolpathi&#8217; documents the extermination of Buddhism from Kerala by Kumarila. About the activities of Sankaracharya, even Vivekananda had observed: &#8216;And, such was the heart of Sankara that he burnt to death lots of Buddhist monks by defeating them in argument. What can you call such action on Sankara&#8217;s part except fanaticism&#8217; (Complete works of Swami Vivekananda, Vol. III, p. 118, Calcutta, 1997).&#8217;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
According to Dr. Jayaprakash, there are hundreds of places in Kerala having names &#8216;palli&#8217; either affixed or suffixed with them. &#8216;Karunagapalli, Karthikapalli, Pallickal, Pallippuram, Edappally, etc. are some examples of these places. The term &#8216;palli&#8217; means a Buddha vihara. Notably, Kerala had 1200 years of Buddhist tradition. Earlier, the schools in Malayalam were called as &#8216;Ezhuthupalli&#8217; or &#8216;Pallikoodam&#8217;. It is also worth noticing that the Christians and Muslims in Kerala use the term &#8216;palli&#8217; to denote their church and mosque alike. These &#8216;pallies&#8217; or viharas had been ruthlessly demolished by the Hindu forces under the leadership of Sankaracharya and Kumarila. They could exterminate 1200 years of Buddhist tradition and converted Kerala into a Brahminical state based on the &#8216;Chaturvarna&#8217; system. Original inhabitants of Kerala, like the Ezhavas, Pulayas, etc., were crushed under the weight of casteism. Many a viharas was transformed into temples and majority of people were prevented from entering temples under the pretext of caste pollution. It can also be noted that the name &#8216;Kerala&#8217; is the Sanskritised Aryan version of the Dravidian and Buddhist term &#8216;Cherala&#8217;. The Parasurama legend is nothing but an invented myth for regularizing the Brahminical &#8216;Kerala&#8217; hiding its glorious Buddhist traditions.&#8217;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Jainism, too, met with the same fate in South India. Prof. Bahauddin elaborates: &#8216;Very little information is available about growth of Jainism in South India during 300-400 AD. The Jain book, &#8216;Digambara Darsana&#8217;, recounts the starting of a Sangham at Madurai in 470 AD and Jainism became widespread and strong during 500-600 AD (Kumaraswamy Iyengar, &#8216;Studies in South Indian Jainism&#8217;, p. 51-58)….. The Jains used to instal the images of their saints in their religious places, a practice which was followed by Brahmins. Hindu temples appeared all over Tamilnadu probably after converting the Jain religious places. The idols of 63 Brahmin Sanyasis, who led destruction of Jainism, still adorn the walls of some Hindu temples in Tamilnadu. The remains of destroyed Jain idols, their abandoned religious and living places are scattered all over Tamilnadu to narrate their story. Frescos depicting the kings of Jains could be seen on the walls near the Golden Tank at Madurai Meenakshi Temple where, of the total 12 annual festivals, five depict the killing of Jains according to Kumaraswamy Iyengar (p. 78-79).&#8217;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
According to Dr. Jayaprakash, a number of Buddha statues have been discovered at places like Ambalapuzha, Karunagapalli, Pallickal, Bharanikkavu, Mavelikara and Neelamperur in Kerala. &#8216;They are either in the form of smashed pieces or thrown away from viharas. Lord Ayyappa of Sabarimala and Lord Padmanabha at Thiruvananthapuram are the proxy images of Buddha being worshipped as Vishnu. Hundreds of Buddhists were killed on the banks of Aluva river. The term &#8216;Aluva&#8217; was derived from &#8216;Alawai&#8217; which means &#8216;Trisul&#8217;, a weapon used by Hindu fanatics to stab Buddhists. Similarly, on the banks of the Vaigai river in Tamilnadu, thousands of Buddhists were killed by the Vaishnava Saint, Sambanthar. Thevaram, a Tamil book, documents this brutal extermination of Buddhism.&#8217;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Prof. Bahauddin recalls the strong reasons to believe that a large section of Jains had embraced Islam: &#8216;The spread of Islam in Tamilnadu can be considered in three or four stages. Islam spread in Kerala and Tamilnadu when Jainism was under pressure (650-750 AD). The new religion was received without resistance…. Since Islam considers every human being with equality Jainism and Buddhism had no conflict with it. When Muhammad ibn Al-Qasim attacked Sindh, the Buddhists supported him because they were facing annihilation at that time. A similar situation was prevailing in South India during 650-750 AD…. Muslims in Tamilnadu are called Anchuvanthar, Labba (teacher), Rauthar, Marakar (sailor) or Jonakan (Yavankan). The Anchuvanam is the guild of traders and groups of artisans. The Muslim mohallas of &#8216;Anchuvan Vamsagar&#8217;, &#8216;Anchuvanathar&#8217;, etc. are scattered all over Tamilnadu and seem to be the en bloc conversion of Jain guilds engaged in different activities, especially weaving. Those who ran away from Tamilnadu settled down in Sravanabalagola and Gomatheswaram in Karnataka. And, those who could not leave due to their economic interests converted to Islam. If we analyze the body structure, food, language, dress, ornaments, customs and habits of Anchuvanthar, it could be see that those are a continuation of Jain way of living and customs.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Till recently, the weavers in such Muslim mohallas will not eat at noon or night, and take only one meal before dusk. This was a continuation of Jain habits. There is a separate place in such villages called &#8216;Odukkam&#8217; where Jain Munist used to sit in prayer. On the last Wednesday of the month called &#8216;Odukkathae&#8217; Wednesday, the Muslims gather together to sing religious songs, which is also a Jain tradition. When religious functions like Maulood, Rathif, etc. are organized in the house, a white cloth with lotus symbol on it called &#8216;Mekett&#8217; is tied, which resembles the &#8216;Asmanagiri&#8217; of the Jains…. The architecture of Muslim stone mosques are completely of Jain architecture. The pillars of earlier mosques have practically no difference with the Jain temple pillars. The close relationship between traders and weavers had probably cemented by conversion to Islam. During 950-1200 AD, there were large number of Sufis, Fakirs, wandering poets, singing minstrels, etc. among Muslims all over Tamilnadu. Nadirshah with 500 disciples settled down in &#8216;Trichinopoly&#8217; during 1000 AD. Aliyar Shah and his disciples made Madurai as their centre. Baba Fakhruddin travelled all over Tamilnadu. Nagur became another Sufi centre. The Muslim religious literature of Tamilnadu of that period was least different from those created by Jains and Hindus during the &#8216;Bhakti&#8217; movement.&#8217;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Prof. Bahauddin recounts the spread of Jainism and Buddhism in Kerala, thus: &#8216;Jainism spread in North Kerala around 200 BC. The Jain architectural remains in Canara and Malabar are not available anywhere else in South of Nepal. While Jainism entered North Kerala via Mangalore, Salem, Coimbatore and Wayanad, it entered Southern Kerala from Tirunelveli, Kanyakumari, Nagercoil, Chitharal, etc. The hill near Anamala, which was an important Jain centre, is still called &#8216;Jain Durgam&#8217;. The close-by Kurumala was also a Jain centre. From Anamala through Munnar, Devikulam, Kothamangalam, Perumbavoor, etc. they reached Neryamangalam, Kothamangalam, Perumbavoor and other places. The &#8216;Kallil Kshetram&#8217; in Perumbavoor is an important Jain monument as also the &#8216;Jainmedu&#8217; in Vadakethara village of Palakkad district. Kerala&#8217;s cave temples at Chitharal, Kallil, Trikur, Erunilamkode (Thrissur district) and Thiruveghapuram (Palakkad district) were constructed during the period of Jain King Mahendra Verman-I (610-640 AD). Temple records of Rameswaram, Sucheendram, Poothadi (Wayanad), Keenalur (Kozhicode) , etc. show that they were part of &#8216;Kunavai Koottam&#8217; during 10-11th centuries. &#8216;Koottam&#8217; is the place of living for Jain Sanyasis. Temple records show that all these present-day Hindu temples were Jain religious places till 11th century. Place names with Kallu, Poothan, Aathan, Kotha, Palli, Ambalam, etc. were all Jain centres. Spread all over Kerala, names of these places show that Buddhism and Jainism were widespread. The famous Kalpathi in Palakkad district was a Buddhist-Jain centre. The &#8216;Ratholsavam&#8217; there is akin to the &#8216;Kettukazhcha&#8217; of Buddhists. The present Bhagavati temples were also Jain temples. The group, &#8216;Adikal&#8217;, had a prominent position among Jains who became &#8216;Pisharadi&#8217; after absorption of Jainism in Hinduism.&#8217;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&#8216;Similarly, the Buddhist stoopa at Kodungallore, located in Methala village South-East of Thrikanamathilakam, is an important Buddhist ruin in Kerala…. Mahismathi was the capital of Chera King Satyaputran, which shows the relationship of Chera country (Kerala) with Buddhism. There is a reference in &#8216;Manimekhala&#8217; about a Buddhist Chaityam in Kerala. While Vadakkumnatha Temple at Thrissur and Kurumba Temple at Kodungallore were Buddhist temples, Buddha statues were discovered from Kollam, Alappuzha, Mavelikara, Pallikkal, Karumadi and other places…. Treating mental patients in Thiruvadi temple and leprosy patients in Thakazhi temple shows that they were Buddhist temples since these kind of humanitarian services were not rendered out from Hindu temples…. By 900 AD Buddhism and Jainism were almost wiped out from Tamilnadu. The second settlement wave of Brahmins in Kerala during 900 AD was with Pandyan Kings&#8217; support. Karnataka and Kerala were the only two states where Buddhism and Jainism were still surviving and the second immigration of Brahmins might have been for driving out these two religions from the remaining places.&#8217;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Prof. Bahauddin recalls: &#8216;Very few people know that Buddhism and Jainism were the prominent religions of Kerala till 1200 AD. I was also under the impression that Hinduism was in Kerala from the very beginning. When facts were pieced together, a different picture emerged. Only from the end of 1800 AD the evidence became available about Buddha, Buddhism, Ashoka, etc. That fact itself is a pathetic story….&#8217;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Adds Dr. Jayaprakash in conclusion: &#8216;This is what really happened in India, the land of Buddha. But our so-called eminent historians, except a few, are bent upon eclipsing the cruelty done to Buddhists in India. These pseudo historians have succeeded in creating an impression that India is a land of righteousness and toleration. The entire world has been duped by them. The deed on the part of Taliban can be justified on the ground that Islam does not permit idols. But one has to note that Islam does not allow the demolition of other people&#8217;s religious centres and images. Whatever may be the argument for and against Taliban action, the Hindu atrocities on Buddhism in India has no parallel in the entire world history of religious struggle. Let the world know the cruel and crooked face of the &#8216;Indian vulture without culture&#8217;!</p>

<h3>Intolerance towards Buddhists</h3>
<p>The Brahmanical hostility towards Buddhism was a major reason of the decline of Buddhism in India, the place of its birth. It is quite true that at a later date the Brahmins accepted Buddha as one of the avataras but it was just another srewd Brahmin way of showing contempt towards the Buddha. The Hindus never really showed any friendly attitude towards the followers of the religion of the Buddha, as it shown from various historical records. The Bramins first sowed the seeds of hatred towards the Buddhists in their scriptures to gain the sympatheis of the common people in slaughtering Buddhists.<br />
<span id="more-854"></span><br />
In the Ayodhya Kaanda of Valmiki Ramayana, a Buddhist was compared to a thief and the Tathagatas to atheists (Naastiks). It said:<br />
<b>यथा </b><b>हि </b><b>चोर </b><b>स्स </b><b>तथा </b><b>हि </b><b>बुद्ध-<br />
</b><b>स्तथागतं </b><b>नास्तिकमत्र </b><b>विद्धि।</b></p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p>As a thief, so is Buddha. Know that Tathagatas are atheists. [Sarga 109; shloka 34]</blockquote>
<p>The Yajnavalkya Smriti says that the very sight of a monk with red robes and shaven head (referring to Buddhists), even in a dream, is a bad sign. [Yajnavalkya SmritiI/272-273]
The Agni Purana[16/1-3] and Vishnu Purana[18/13-18] refer to Buddha as an embodiment of Grand Deception (māyamohasvarup) and that he deluded the people from the Vedic Religion.  His path is a sure ticket to hell.<br />
The great philosopher of Hinduism, Shankaracharya, said that the Buddha was suffering from what we know as schizophrenia. Shankaracharya said that</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p>“<strong>he (Buddha) was a man given to make incoherent assertions or else that hatred of all beings</strong> induced him to propound absurd doctrines by accepting which they would become thoroughly confused.–So that–and this the Sûtra means to indicate–Buddha’s doctrine has to be entirely disregarded by all those who have a regard for their own happiness.”<br />
[Shankar Bhashya on Brahmasutra 2/2/32]</blockquote>
<p>The writer of <em>Saankhyakaarika</em>, Vachaspati Mishra, uses the words <strong>‘Mleccha (filthy)’, Purushaapsad (low people) and PashuPraay (Animal like) </strong>for Buddhists, Jains, etc. He writes:<br />
<b>आप्तग्रहणेनाs</b><b>युक्ताः  </b><b>शाक्यभिक्षुर्नि </b><b>ग्रन्थकसंसारमो </b><b>चकादीनामागमाभासाः </b><b>परिहृता </b><b>भवन्ति . </b><b>अयुक्तत्वं </b><b>चैतेषां </b><b>विगानात्, </b><b>विच्छन्न </b><b>मूलत्वात्, </b><b>प्रमाणविरुद्धार्थाभिधानात् </b><b>कैशिचदेव </b><b>मलेच्छादिभिः </b><b>पुरुषापसदैः </b><b>पशुप्रायैः </b><b>परिग्रहाद् </b><b>बोद्धव्यम् .</b></p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p>“By saying ‘true revelation’, all pretended revelations such as those of Shaakya, Bhikshu (Buddha),etc have been set aside. The invalidity of these systems is due to their making unreasonable assertions, to want of sufficient basis, to their making statements contradictory to proofs, and lastly to their being accepted only by <strong>Mlecchas, or by mean men or by animal like people</strong>. “</p></blockquote>
<h3>Were Buddhists persecuted by Hindus? Yes, they were</h3>
<p>Buddhism suffered a great decline owing to the hostile activities of some philosphers of Brahminical thought and preachers of South India. Kumarila Bhatta was regarded as the fiercest critic of Buddhism. He was the strongest protagonist of Vedic ritualism. Kumarila is said to have been a Brahmin of Bihar who raged with the ardour to preach against Buddhism. The <em><strong>Shankar Digvijaya</strong></em>of Madhava (earliest authentic biography of Shankaracharya) refers to Malayali King Sudhanva’s brutal extermination of Buddhists at the instigation of Kumarila Bhatta.</p>
<h3>Intolerance towards Buddhists</h3>
<p>The Brahmanical hostility towards Buddhism was a major reason of the decline of Buddhism in India, the place of its birth. It is quite true that at a later date the Brahmins accepted Buddha as one of the avataras but it was just another srewd Brahmin way of showing contempt towards the Buddha.

<blockquote class="quote-light"><p>“<strong>he (Buddha) was a man given to make incoherent assertions or else that hatred of all beings</strong> induced him to propound absurd doctrines by accepting which they would become thoroughly confused.–So that–and this the Sûtra means to indicate–Buddha’s doctrine has to be entirely disregarded by all those who have a regard for their own happiness.”<br />
[Shankar Bhashya on Brahmasutra 2/2/32]</blockquote>
<p>The writer of <em>Saankhyakaarika</em>, Vachaspati Mishra, uses the words <strong>‘Mleccha (filthy)’, Purushaapsad (low people) and PashuPraay (Animal like) </strong>for Buddhists, Jains, etc. He writes:<br />

<p>Kumarila is said to have been a Brahmin of Bihar who raged with the ardour to preach against Buddhism. The <em><strong>Shankar Digvijaya</strong></em>of Madhava (earliest authentic biography of Shankaracharya) refers to Malayali King Sudhanva’s brutal extermination of Buddhists at the instigation of Kumarila Bhatta.</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p>The king (Sudhanva) commanded his servants “kill all Buddhists from Himalaya to Rameshvaram, <strong>even children and elderly</strong>. Whosoever will not kill them, will be killed at my hands.” [93]
At the instigation of Kumarila Bhatta, the king killed the Buddhists, the opponents (of the Hindu religion) just like a Yogi destroys the disturbances. [95]
<strong>[Madhava-Vidyaranya, Sankara Digvijaya Sarg 1; shlokas 93-95]

<p>This was about Kumarila’s brutal persecution of Buddhists. Now let us turn to Adi Shankaracharya, the Brahmin of South India, who did  a great job of glorifying the <em>Vedas </em>and the <em>Advaita Vedanta</em> philosophy. He was vigorously anti-Buddhism. I have already quoted his remarks on Buddha, which show his ‘regard’ for the Buddhist religion (Refer Shankar Bhasya on Brahmasutra 2/2/32). With regards to the Sringeri matha built by Shankaracharya, Sir Charles Eliot in his book <em>Hinduism and Buddhism</em> (1921 Ed. Page 211) says,</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p>“There is some reason to suppose that the Matha of Sringeri was founded on the site of a Buddhist Monestary”</p></blockquote>
<p>The 15th Sarga of his biography <em>Madhava-Vidyaranya Sankara Digvijay </em>refers to his campaigns against the Buddhists, being escorted by King Sudhanvan’s army wherever he went from the Himalayas to the India Ocean. Owing to his anti Buddhist activities, Buddhism fell on its evil days.<br />
This royal persecution of Buddhists by some Brahminic rulers was the most potent factor which contributed to bring the decline of Buddhism in India. The <strong><em>Budaun Stone Inscription</em> </strong>of Lakhanapaala refers to one <strong>Varamasiva, a Saiva ascetic, </strong>who destroyed an idol of Buddha in the South (Dakshinapatha) before his arrival in Vodamayuta (<a style="color: #9f9f9f;" href="http://www.dli.ernet.in/cgi-bin/metainfo.cgi?&amp;title1=epigraphia%20indica%20vol.1&amp;author1=burgess,%20jas.&amp;subject1=tribes,%20india&amp;year=1892%20&amp;language1=english&amp;pages=540&amp;barcode=99999990010481&amp;author2=NULL&amp;identifier1=NULL&amp;publisher1=luzac&amp;contributor1=NULL&amp;vendor1=NONE&amp;scanningcentre1=ignca&amp;slocation1=NONE&amp;sourcelib1=central%20archaeological%20library,%20%20asi&amp;scannerno1=0&amp;digitalrepublisher1=NULL&amp;digitalpublicationdate1=0000-00-00&amp;numberedpages1=0&amp;unnumberedpages1=0&amp;rights1=OUT_OF_COPYRIGHT&amp;copyrightowner1=NULL&amp;copyrightexpirydate1=0000-00-00&amp;format1=tagged%20image%20file%20format%20&amp;url=/data6/upload/0144/640" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" data-wpel-link="external">Epigraphia Indica vol.1<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, Page 63)<br />

Another fierce Hindu king who showed his great hostility towards Buddhism was <strong>Shashanka, the King of Gauda</strong>. He was a notable example of anti-Buddhist Brahminical fanaticism. He is said to have uprooted the sacred Bodhi-Tree at Bodh-Gaya but in order to destroy it totally, he burnt its remains. A Buddha image from a temple east of the Bodhi tree was removed by him and in its place, he installed an image of Siva.

This is corroborated by <em>The Life of Hiuen Tsiang by the Shaman Hwui Li</em> who mentions that a certain <strong>Kumaara-Raja</strong> threatened the monks of Nalanda with a behaviour similar to Shashanka, and with the destruction of the whole monastery unless Hiuen Tsang was sent to his court.

<p>Mihirakula oppressed the Buddhists and behaved with them cruelly. At his instigation not only were many Buddhists murdered but many Stupas, Caityas, Vihaaras, and other Buddhist establishments were destroyed in Punjab and Kashmir. The description of his cruelties as described in the <em>Rajatarangini </em>is corroborated by the description given by Hiuen Tsang in his book <strong><em>Si-Yu-Ki</em></strong>. He writes,</p>

<p>This shows that the Brahmins were hand in glove with his slaughter of Buddhists and the destruction of the Buddhist establishments. So, the fake polemics of some Hindu writers that Mihirakula was not a Hindu or that his destruction of Buddhists establishments cannot be tied to Hindus are unfounded.<br />
Another hateful persecutor of Buddhists was Pushyamitra Sunga, founder of the Sunga Dynasty. Several Chinese and Japanese historians mention Pushyamitra’s name at the head of the list of persecutors. Buddhist writers portray Pushyanitra as a cruel persecutor of the religion of Sakyamuni (Buddha). Pushyamitra, a militant follower of Brahminism, assassinated the last Mauryan Emperor Brhadratha, capturing the throne of Magadha and founded the Sunga Dynasty. It ruled for a period of one hundred and twelve years.  Pushyamitra had to justify his position as head of the Brahmanic reaction by persecuting the Buddhists and destroying Buddhist monasteries on the one hand and restoring the sacrificial ceremonies of the Brahmanic faith on the other, for which his principal helpers were Patanjali and also perhaps Manu, the author of the <i>Manusmriti. </i>who was also his contemporary according to some scholars. The persecution of the Buddhists by Pushyamitra, was a logical sequence of the Brahmanic reaction and the political <em>coup d’etat</em>. The Buddhist text <em>Divyavadana </em>mentions the persecutions of Pushyamitra and his destruction of Buddhist stupas and monasteries. Hindutva apologists such as Dr. Koenraad Elst have tried to refute these charges on Pushyamitra, saying that they are “rendered improbable by external evidence”. Elst then claims that “he (Pushyamitra) allowed and patronized the construction of monasteries and Buddhist universities in his domains, as well as the still-extant stupa of Sanchi.” Although he gives no reference for this claim, it is possible that he was referring to the epigraph on the <strong>gateway of Barhut,</strong> which mentions its erection “during the supremacy of the Sungas“. The inscription uses the words <strong>सुगनं रजे</strong> (During the reign of Sungas). It does not necessarily include the reign of Pushyamitra. It only means ‘during the reign of Sungas’. The gateway was constructed during the reign of his successors who were more tolerant to Buddhism than the founder of the dynasty and leader of the Brahmanic reaction. That the gateways were erected long after the time of Pushyamitra is also the opinion of eminent archaeologists like Mr. N. G. Mazumdar, who writes,</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p>“The Sungas referred to in this inscription formed a dynasty which was founded by the general (Senapati) Pushyamitra, succeeding the Mauryas about 180 B.C. <strong>The gateways, however, appear to have been set up about a century later, towards the close o the Sunga period</strong>.”<br />

<p>Dr. Elst also quotes the historian of Buddhism, Etienne Lamotte, who wrote, “To judge from the documents, Pushyamitra must be acquitted through lack of proof”. [History of Indian Buddhism, Institut Orientaliste, Louvain-la-Neuve 1988/1958, p.109] Firstly, this reference is incorrect as the page number is 392. Even then, let me provide the complete quote of Etienne Lamotte. He writes,</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p>“To judge from the documents, Pushyamitra must be acquitted through lack of proof. Nevertheless, as was remarked by H. Kern, in view of the varied opinions, <strong>it is possible that, in some localities, there may have been pillages of monasteries, perhaps with the tacit permission of the governors</strong>. “</p></blockquote>
<p>Prominent Indian historian, professor Romila Thapar writes,</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p>“Buddhist sources claim that they (Sungas) persecuted the Buddhists and destroyed their monasteries and places of worship. This could have been an exaggeration, but archaeological evidence reveals that Buddhist monuments in the Sunga domain were at this time in disrepair and being renovated. However, if the chronology of these monuments shifts forward as is now being suggested, then this would make them post-Sunga renovations. Nevertheless, even if some renovations were of a later date, the damage to the stupa at Sanchi, and to the monastery at Kaushambi dates to Shunga times. Added emphasis is given to this from Pushyamitra having performed <em>ashvamedhas</em>, or horse sacrifices. This is sometimes viewed as indicating support of Vedic Brahmanism and a disapproval of heterodox sects.”<br />

Further Reading<br />
Buddhist scholars have also laid claim to many Hindu temples being original Buddhist Shrines. A book written by Dr. K. Jamnadas was titled <em>‘Tirupati Balaji was a Buddhist Shrine’</em>. In this book, the author has given huge stock of evidence to prove that the temple which is today sacred to Hindus was once a Buddhist Shrine. Readers are advised to make up their own mind after reading the book themselves and verifying the proofs.The book can be downloaded from the link <a style="color: #9f9f9f;" href="http://www.ambedkar.org/Tirupati/Tirupati.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener external" target="_blank" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">http://www.ambedkar.org/Tirupati/Tirupati.pdf<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Written by Ibn Muhammad</p>
<p>Among the most widely propagated myths in the world today is that Hinduism is the most tolerant religion and that it has had no history of persecuting the followers of other faiths. The advocates of Hinduism leave no stone unturned to make the masses believe this myth. The most favourite tactic of the modern advocates of Hinduism to divert attention from the actual history of Hinduism has been to demonize Islam and link it to oppression, terror, plunder, and what not. We often hear Hindutvavadi zealots using phrases like ‘Muslim genocide of Hindus’, ‘Muslims destroyed Hindu temples’, ‘Forcible conversion of Hindus to Islam’, and on and on.So far they have been able to hypnotize the naïve Hindu masses by this tactic and control their minds.</p>
<p><span id="more-3384"></span></p>
<p>In this article we will dig deeper into the Hindu sources to expose the intolerant and hateful picture they portray of Hindu history. The objective of this article is not to demonize Hindus but to challenge the misinformation that Hinduism has had no history of religious persecutions and intolerance. This article is not written from the perspective of the Aryan Invasion Theory but it will focus on the religious conflicts mentioned in the Hindu sources. Regardless of whether Aryans and non-Aryans were different races or not, it is certain that they had religious conflicts. Anyone who will not agree with the contents of this article must take the pen and disprove the claims made herein.</p>
<p>Let us first take a look at the <em>Vedas</em>, which are the most ancient books of Hindus, and how tolerant (?) they are towards the non-Aryans (Anaryas).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The religious intolerance of Aryans towards the non-Aryans</strong></p>
<p><strong>किं ते कर्ण्वन्ति कीकटेषु गावो नाशिरं दुह्रे न तपन्तिघर्मम |</strong><br />
<strong>आ नो भर परमगन्दस्य वेदो नैचाशाखं मघवन्रन्धयानः ||</strong></p>
<p>“O Indra, what do the cows make for you among the <strong>Kikatas</strong>? They neither yield milk for your offerings, nor do they warm the vessel of libation. Bring to us these cows; bring to us also the wealth of Parmagand (their King). O Brave one, grant us the possessions of the people of low status.” [<em>Rigveda</em> 3:53:14]
<p>‘Kikatas’ were a non-Aryan people living around modern Bihar, who reared cattle. The Aryans were eyeing their property and the way they expressed this desire to their God (Indra), reflects their mind-set. The reason given in these verses to snatch the cattle of the Kikatas is that they do not offer milk oblation to the Aryan god Indra. Explaining the word ‘Kikata’, <em>Nirukt, </em>the oldest treatise on etymology of Vedic words, says,</p>
<p><strong>कीकटा नाम देशो अनार्यनिवासः</strong></p>
<p>“<strong>Kikata</strong> is the name of a country where the non-Aryans dwell.”</p>
<p>Most scholars place this country around modern Bihar. This shows that Vedic Hinduism was not practiced in that region at least. The Kikatas were considered infidels (Naastikas) by the Aryans and thus were legitimate targets. It is worth mentioning how this verse has been translated by two erudite Hindu scholars Swami Satya Prakash Saraswati and Satyakam Vidyalankar in their English Translation of the Rigveda. They write,</p>
<p>“O bounteous Lord, of what avail <strong>are the cattle of the infidels</strong> to you. Neither they yield milk nor do <strong>these faithless persons</strong> kindle sacred fire. May you <strong>bring wealth of these unbelievers to us</strong> and give us possessions of people of low mortality and crush them.”</p>
[<em>Rigveda Samhita</em>, Tr. Satya Prakash Saraswati and Satyakam Vidyalankar; 1977, Vol IV, Page 1235]
<p>On the basis of this clear pronouncement, non-Aryans had no right to keep cows. Aryans, whenever they wished could kill them and appropriate their possessions. Hindu culture thus became the culture of the progress, civilization and welfare of the Aryan people alone.</p>
<p>These non-Aryans have been described at several places in the Vedas as anyavratam <strong>अन्यव्रतम<br />
</strong> (followers of another religion or creed), amaanusham <strong>अमानुषम<br />
</strong> (not human), ayajvaanam <strong>अयज्वानम<br />
</strong> (not performing Yajna) [Refer to <em>Rigveda</em> 8/70/11]
<p><strong>इन्द्रः समत्सु यजमानमार्यं परावद विश्वेषु शतमूतिराजिषु सवर्मीळ्हेष्वाजिषु |मनवे शासदव्रतान तवचं कर्ष्णामरन्धयत | </strong></p>
<p>Indra is said to help the Aryan worshippers in battles and punishes the neglecter of religious rites, who are said to be having ‘black skin ‘tvacham krishnaam’ (<strong>तवचं कर्ष्णाम</strong>). [<em>Rigveda</em> 1/130/8]
<p>The maidens of the ‘dark race’ are the said to be free sexual dishes of Aryans. Nirukt 12/13 mentions that ‘<strong>Raamaa</strong>‘, the lovely maidens belonging to the dark race are only for sexual enjoyment and not for any sacred purpose. <strong>रामा रमणाय उपेयते न धर्माय कृष्णजातिया</strong></p>
<p>Whether this description of ‘black race’ is literal or figurative is beyond the scope of this article. What is certain is that non-Aryans were hated by the Aryans for following a different religious creed. That this conflict was religious is evidenced by the <em>Rig Veda</em> itself.</p>
<p>Following mantras from the Rig-Veda illustrate the hatred of other religious groups:</p>
<p><strong>अकर्मा दस्युरभि नो अमन्तुरन्यव्रतो अमानुषः |<br />
तवन्तस्यामित्रहन वधर्दासस्य दम्भय ||</strong></p>
<p>“Around us is the Dasyu, practicing no religious rites, not knowing us thoroughly, inhuman, following other laws. Baffle, you Slayer of the foe, the strength of this Daasa.” [Rigveda 10/22/8]
<p>How many Dasyus were slaughtered? Let us turn to Atharvaveda 8/8/7 which says</p>
<p><strong>बृहत् ते जालं बृहत इन्द्र शूर सहस्रार्धस्य शत्वीर्यस्य |<br />
तेन शतं सहस्रमयुतं नयर्बुदं जधान शको दस्युनाममिधाय सेनया ||</strong></p>
<p>Great is your net, brave Indra, the mighty match for a thousand, Lord of Hundred Powers! Holding them, with his host, therewith has Indra slaughtered  Dasyus a hundred, thousand, myriad, hundred millions.</p>
<p><strong>असुन्वन्तं समं जहि दूणाशं यो न ते मयः |<br />
अस्मभ्यमस्य वेदनं दद्धि सूरिश्चिदोहते ||</strong></p>
<p>“Slay everyone who pours no gift, who, hard to reach, delights you not. Bestow on us what wealth he has: this even the worshipper awaits.” [Rigveda 1:176:4]
<p><strong>अनुव्रताय रन्धयन्नपव्रतानाभूभिरिन्द्रः शनथयन्ननाभुवः | </strong></p>
<p>“Indra abides, humbling the neglecters of holy rites, in favour of those who observe them, and punishing those who turn away from his worship, in favour of those who are present with their praise).” [Rigveda 1/51/9]
<p>It would thus appear that the non-Aryans lived in secluded spots far from the settlement of the Aryans, and performed their own peculiar rites which were regarded as wicked by the Aryan; and as they did not believe in the existence of Aryan gods, they incurred the hatred of their Vedic neighbours. The very existence of Indra was doubted by even some Aryans, which appears from the following mantra:</p>
<p><strong>यं समा पर्छन्ति कुह सेति घोरमुतेमाहुर्नैषो अस्तीत्येनम |</strong></p>
<p>“He, whom, terrible, they ask for, (saying), where is he? And assert that he is not.” [Rigveda 2/12/5]
<p>A certain Rishi called Nema is quoted as saying,</p>
<p><strong>पर सु सतोमं भरत वाजयन्त इन्द्राय सत्यं यदि सत्यमस्ति |<br />
नेन्द्रो अस्तीति नेम उ तव आह क ईं ददर्श कमभिष्टवाम ||</strong></p>
<p>Offer fervently, my war-loving companions, true praise to Indra, if he truly exists; Nema says, “verily there is no Indra,” who has ever seen him? Whom shall we praise? [Rigveda 8/100/3]
<p>It is thus clear that there were dissenters/apostates from the orthodox faith even in the Aryan society; and we can easily imagine the extent of ill feeling that existed between such dissenters and the orthodox Aryans, which afterwards led to a protracted sanguinary warfare resulting in the ultimate expulsion of the dissenters. These dissenters were called Aryan enemies and were different from the Daasas and Dasyus. Following mantras show the attitude of the orthodox Aryans towards the dissenters:</p>
<p><strong>न ते त इन्द्राभ्य अस्मद रष्वायुक्तासो अब्रह्मता यद असन | </strong></p>
<p>Since, mighty Indra, those who, differing from us, and are not united with you through their lack of devotion, are not yours; [Rigveda 5/33/3]
<p><strong>उत तया सद्य आर्या सरयोर इन्द्र पारतः |<br />
अर्णाचित्ररथावधीः ||</strong></p>
<p>“O Indra, you instantly killed Aryas, Arna and Chitraratha, on the other side of the Sarayu.” [Rigveda 4/30/18]
<p><strong>यस्ते मन्यो.अविधद वज्र सायक सह ओजः पुष्यति विश्वमानुषक |<br />
साह्याम दासमार्यं तवया युजा सहस्क्र्तेनसहसा सहस्वता ||</strong></p>
<p>“O Manyu (anger), help us so that we may successfully fight our enemies, whether belonging to the Arya clans or those of the Daasas.” [Rigveda 10/83/1]
<p><strong>एना मन्दानो जहि शूर शत्रूञ जामिमजामिं मघवन्नमित्रान |<br />
अभिषेणानभ्यादेदिशानान पराच इन्द्र पर मर्णाजही च || </strong></p>
<p>“O you valiant Maghavan, be exhilarated by this Soma drink, and destroy all our opposing enemies, whether they be our own kith and kin, or not.” [Rigveda 6/44/17]
<p>From these extracts, it would appear that the ancient Aryan society, as depicted in the Rigveda, was not an ideal peaceful society to live in. It was divided into numerous factions. The dissenters of the Vedic Aryans were driven out of the land, and some of them took refuge in the hills and forests of the western frontiers; while others passed out of the country through the north-western passess into Western Asia, and a wider world beyond. Here it is sufficient to state that these Aryan dissenters, who seceded from the orthodox faith, were subsequently known in history as the Iranians or Parsis or Zoroastrians. They were compelled to leave this country after a protracted war, which came to be known in the later Vedic literature and the Puranas as the Deva-Asura War (Devaasur-Sangraama).</p>
<p>Vedic Hinduism, most certainly, did not spread by peaceful means. A study of the Vedas reveals the enormous scale of religious conflicts that were going on in those times and how the Vedic Aryans were conquering city after city and fort after fort. The Vedas have never been brought in the public domain for precisely this reason. The people were not allowed to read, least they come to know of the brutal battles that were waged.</p>
<p><strong>Vedic Aastiks versus the non-Vedic Naastiks</strong></p>
<p>According to the Hinds, the people opposed to the Vedic religion are called Naastikas (disbelievers). Buddhism, Jainism and Chaarvaaka are called Naastik philosophies, as they do not accept the authority of the Vedas. Hindu Dharmashastras (religious texts) call for severing relations with the Naastiks and socially boycotting them. For example Manu Smriti says,</p>
<p>10. But by Sruti (revelation) is meant the Veda, and by Smriti (tradition) the Institutes of the sacred law: <strong>those two must not be called into question in any matter</strong>, since from those two the sacred law shone forth. 11. Every twice-born man, <strong>who, relying on the Institutes of dialectics, treats with contempt those two sources (of the law), must be cast out by the virtuous, as an atheist (Naastik) and a scorner of the Veda (Veda Nindak).</strong> [Manu Smriti 2/10-11]
<p>What should be the behaviour of Aryans towards these ‘Naastiks’ and ‘Veda Nindaks’? Let us turn to Atharvaveda Kaand 12, Sukt 5, Mantra 62. This mantra has been translated by Arya Samaj scholar Pandit Khem Karan Das Trivedi as follows</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="576" height="168" class="wp-image-7354" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201.png" alt="https://truthabouthinduism.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/083014_1719_hinduismand3.png?w=699&amp;h=204" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201.png 576w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201-300x88.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px" /></p>
<p>“Rend, rend to bits, rend through and through, scorch and consume and burn to dust, the one who rejects the Vedas.”</p>
<p>I do not think the above verse leaves any ambiguity as to who the enemies mentioned in the Vedas are. The mantra speaks for itself. It also prescribes the most gruesome forms of slaughter of those who disbelieve in the Vedas.</p>
<p>The same Sookt (hymn) also commands the following in mantras 65-71,</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="443" height="433" class="wp-image-7355" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201-1.png" alt="https://truthabouthinduism.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/083014_1719_hinduismand4.png?w=625" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201-1.png 443w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201-1-300x293.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 443px) 100vw, 443px" /></p>
<p>65) So, O Goddess, do thou from him, the Brāhmans’ tyrant,  criminal, niggard, blasphemer of the Gods,  66) With hundred-knotted thunderbolt, sharpened and edged with razor-blades, 67) <strong>Strike off the shoulders and the head. 68) Snatch thou the hair from off his head, and from his body strip the skin: 69) Tear out his sinews, cause his flesh to fall in pieces from his frame. 70) Crush thou his bones together, strike and beat the marrow out of him. 71) Dislocate all his limbs and joints.</strong></p>
<p>I wonder what type of mindset would have written this horrendous stuff? This extreme sadist mentality which relishes in instructing such horrible torture deserves to be banned forever before it is put to practice.  One can imagine what would have happened at the time when such teachings would have been enforced thousands of years back. These teachings were recently put into effect when innocent Muslims were burnt alive and tortured in the Indian State of Gujrat, Christians were burnt alive in many places of India especially in Orrisa. Jains and Buddhists in ancient times and Muslims, Christians and Sikhs in recent times have been made the experimental mice of these teachings.</p>
<p>Based on instructions such as these, followeres of non-Vedic religions like Buddhism and Jainsm were brutally persecuted by the Brahmins. Let us deal with these persecutions in detail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Intolerance towards Buddhists</strong></p>
<p>The Brahmanical hostility towards Buddhism was a major reason of the decline of Buddhism in India, the place of its birth. It is quite true that at a later date the Brahmins accepted Buddha as one of the avataras but it was just another srewd Brahmin way of showing contempt towards the Buddha. The Hindus never really showed any friendly attitude towards the followers of the religion of the Buddha, as it shown from various historical records. The Bramins first sowed the seeds of hatred towards the Buddhists in their scriptures to gain the sympatheis of the common people in slaughtering Buddhists.</p>
<p>In the Ayodhya Kaanda of Valmiki Ramayana, a Buddhist was compared to a thief and the Tathagatas to atheists (Naastiks). It said:</p>
<p><strong>यथा हि चोर स्स तथा हि बुद्ध-<br />
स्तथागतं नास्तिकमत्र विद्धि। </strong></p>
<p>As a thief, so is Buddha. Know that Tathagatas are atheists. [Sarga 109; shloka 34]
<p>The Yajnavalkya Smriti says that the very sight of a monk with red robes and shaven head (referring to Buddhists), even in a dream, is a bad sign. [Yajnavalkya SmritiI/272-273]
<p>The Agni Purana[16/1-3] and Vishnu Purana[18/13-18] refer to Buddha as an embodiment of Grand Deception (māyamohasvarup) and that he deluded the people from the Vedic Religion.  His path is a sure ticket to hell.</p>
<p>The great philosopher of Hinduism, Shankaracharya, said that the Buddha was suffering from what we know as schizophrenia. Shankaracharya said that</p>
<p>“<strong>he (Buddha) was a man given to make incoherent assertions or else that hatred of all beings</strong> induced him to propound absurd doctrines by accepting which they would become thoroughly confused.–So that–and this the Sûtra means to indicate–Buddha’s doctrine has to be entirely disregarded by all those who have a regard for their own happiness.” [Shankar Bhashya on Brahmasutra 2/2/32]
<p>The commentator of <em>Saankhyakaarika</em>, Vachaspati Mishra, uses the words <strong>‘Mleccha (filthy)’, Purushaapsad (low people) and PashuPraay (Animal like) </strong>for Buddhists, Jains, etc. He writes in <em>Saankhyatatva Kaumudi</em>:</p>
<p><strong>आप्तग्रहणेनाsयुक्ताः  शाक्यभिक्षुर्नि ग्रन्थकसंसारमो चकादीनामागमाभासाः परिहृता भवन्ति . अयुक्तत्वं चैतेषां विगानात्, विच्छन्न मूलत्वात्,  प्रमाणविरुद्धार्थाभिधानात् कैशिचदेव मलेच्छादिभिः पुरुषापसदैः पशुप्रायैः परिग्रहाद् बोद्धव्यम् .</strong></p>
<p>“By saying ‘true revelation’, all pretended revelations such as those of Shaakya, Bhikshu (Buddha),etc have been set aside. The invalidity of these systems is due to their making unreasonable assertions, to want of sufficient basis, to their making statements contradictory to proofs, and lastly<br />
to their being accepted only by <strong>Mlecchas, or by mean men or by animal like people</strong>. ”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Were Buddhists persecuted by Hindus? Yes, they were</strong></p>
<p>Buddhism suffered a great decline owing to the hostile activities of some philosphers of Brahminical thought and preachers of South India. Kumarila Bhatta was regarded as the fiercest critic of Buddhism. He was the strongest protagonist of Vedic ritualism. Kumarila is said to have been a Brahmin of Bihar who raged with the ardour to preach against Buddhism. The <strong><em>Shankar Digvijaya</em></strong> of Madhava (earliest authentic biography of Shankaracharya) refers to Malayali King Sudhanva’s brutal extermination of Buddhists at the instigation of Kumarila Bhatta.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="489" height="575" class="wp-image-7356" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201.gif" alt="https://truthabouthinduism.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/083014_1719_hinduismand5.gif?w=625" /></p>
<p>The king (Sudhanva) commanded his servants “kill all Buddhists from Himalaya to Rameshvaram, <strong>even children and elderly</strong>. Whosoever will not kill them, will be killed at my hands.” [93] At the instigation of Kumarila Bhatta, the king killed the Buddhists, the opponents (of the Hindu religion) just like a Yogi destroys the disturbances. [95] <strong>[Madhava-Vidyaranya, Sankara Digvijaya Sarg 1; shlokas 93-95]</strong></p>
<p>This was about Kumarila’s brutal persecution of Buddhists. Now let us turn to Adi Shankaracharya, the Brahmin of South India, who did  a great job of glorifying the <em>Vedas </em>and the <em>Advaita Vedanta</em> philosophy. He was vigorously anti-Buddhism. I have already quoted his remarks on Buddha, which show his ‘regard’ for the Buddhist religion (Refer Shankar Bhasya on Brahmasutra 2/2/32). With regards to the Sringeri matha built by Shankaracharya, Sir Charles Eliot in his book <em>Hinduism and Buddhism</em> (1921 Ed. Page 211) says,</p>
<p>“There is some reason to suppose that the Matha of Sringeri was founded on the site of a Buddhist Monestary”</p>
<p>The 15th Sarga of his biography <em>Madhava-Vidyaranya Sankara Digvijay </em>refers to his campaigns against the Buddhists, being escorted by King Sudhanvan’s army wherever he went from the Himalayas to the India Ocean. Owing to his anti Buddhist activities, Buddhism fell on its evil days.</p>
<p>This royal persecution of Buddhists by some Brahminic rulers was the most potent factor which contributed to bring the decline of Buddhism in India. The <strong><em>Budaun Stone Inscription</em><br />
</strong> of Lakhanapaala refers to one <strong>Varamasiva, a Saiva ascetic, </strong>who destroyed an idol of Buddha in the South (Dakshinapatha) before his arrival in Vodamayuta (Epigraphia Indica vol.1, Page 63)</p>
<p>A <strong>Chalukya Inscription</strong> of 1184 A.D. refers to a feudatory chief,<strong> Mahaamandaleshvara Viruparasadeva</strong>, who is described as a ‘forest-fire to the Jain religion’, a ‘destroyer of the Buddha religion’, a ‘demolisher of Jain basadis’ and ‘establisher of the Sivalinga-Simhaasana (Shiva Linga Throne).He destroyed several <em>samayas </em>at Pariyalige, Anilevada (Anhilwad), Unukallu (Unkal), Sampagadi (Sampagaon), Ibbaluru (Ablur?), Marudige (Maradigi), Anampur (Alampur), KaTahada (Karad), Kembhavi, Bammakuru and other places. [Annual report of the archaeological survey of India 1929-30 Page 171]
<p>We know from the record of the Nalanda Inscription of Vipulasrimitra, that a <strong>Vangala </strong>army killed a Buddhist monk named <strong>Karunasrimitra</strong> of <strong>Somapura </strong>and burnt down his house, which was actually a monastery. [Epigraphia Indica vol.21 Page 97]
<p>Another fierce Hindu king who showed his great hostility towards Buddhism was <strong>Shashanka, the King of Gauda</strong>. He was a notable example of anti-Buddhist Brahminical fanaticism. He is said to have uprooted the sacred Bodhi-Tree at Bodh-Gaya but in order to destroy it totally, he burnt its remains. A Buddha image from a temple east of the Bodhi tree was removed by him and in its place, he installed an image of Siva. [On Yuan Chwang’s Travels in India vol. 2 by Thomas Watters, 1905, Pages 115,116]
<p>This is corroborated by <em>The Life of Hiuen Tsiang by the Shaman Hwui Li</em> who mentions that a certain <strong>Kumaara-Raja</strong> threatened the monks of Nalanda with a behaviour similar to Shashanka, and with the destruction of the whole monastery unless Hiuen Tsang was sent to his court. Kumara-Raja wrote in his letter,</p>
<p>“I have again sent a messenger with a written request: If he (Hiuen Tsang) does not  come, your disciple will then let the evil portion of himself prevail. In recent times Shanshanka-Raja was equal still to the destruction of the law and uprooted the Bodhi tree. Do you, my Master, suppose that your disciple has no such power as this?

<p>Another cruel persecutor of Buddhism was <strong>Mihirakula</strong>, who had occupied the throne of Kashmir. <strong>Kalhana Pandit</strong>, the famous chronicler of Kashmir and the author of <strong><em>Rajatarangini</em></strong>, says that for his atrocities he was like Yama, the god of death. Kalhana describes further: “One’s tongue would become polluted if one attempted to record his cruelties and evil deeds in detail” [<strong><em><a href="http://www.dli.ernet.in/cgi-bin/metainfo.cgi?&amp;title1=kalhana%27s%20rajtarangini%20a%20chronicle%20of%20the%20kings%20of%20kashmir&amp;author1=stein,%20m.a.&amp;subject1=kashmir%20history&amp;year=1900%20&amp;language1=english&amp;pages=580&amp;barcode=99999990253849&amp;author2=NULL&amp;identifier1=NULL&amp;publisher1=archibald%20constable%20and%20co.%20ltd.&amp;contributor1=NULL&amp;vendor1=NONE&amp;scanningcentre1=uod,delhi&amp;slocation1=NONE&amp;sourcelib1=central%20library,%20delhi%20university&amp;scannerno1=0&amp;digitalrepublisher1=NULL&amp;digitalpublicationdate1=0000-00-00&amp;numberedpages1=0&amp;unnumberedpages1=0&amp;rights1=not%20available&amp;copyrightowner1=NULL&amp;copyrightexpirydate1=0000-00-00&amp;format1=book%20&amp;url=/data4/upload/0106/653" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Rajatarangini <span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></em></strong>I, 289,290 and 304; Translated by M. A. Stein]. From his account it is known that Mihirakula played an important role in the development of Brahmanism. He was a worshipper of Shiva and built a Shiva temple in Srinagara [<em><a href="http://www.dli.ernet.in/cgi-bin/metainfo.cgi?&amp;title1=kalhana%27s%20rajtarangini%20a%20chronicle%20of%20the%20kings%20of%20kashmir&amp;author1=stein,%20m.a.&amp;subject1=kashmir%20history&amp;year=1900%20&amp;language1=english&amp;pages=580&amp;barcode=99999990253849&amp;author2=NULL&amp;identifier1=NULL&amp;publisher1=archibald%20constable%20and%20co.%20ltd.&amp;contributor1=NULL&amp;vendor1=NONE&amp;scanningcentre1=uod,delhi&amp;slocation1=NONE&amp;sourcelib1=central%20library,%20delhi%20university&amp;scannerno1=0&amp;digitalrepublisher1=NULL&amp;digitalpublicationdate1=0000-00-00&amp;numberedpages1=0&amp;unnumberedpages1=0&amp;rights1=not%20available&amp;copyrightowner1=NULL&amp;copyrightexpirydate1=0000-00-00&amp;format1=book%20&amp;url=/data4/upload/0106/653" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Rajatarangini<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></em> I, 306; M. A. Stein]. The view that he was a Shaivite is upheld by M. A. Stein as he writes,</p>
<p>“The impression which this tradition retained of Mihirakula’s religious propensities, is in full accord with the evidence of his coins which, in the emblems of bull and trident and in the legends of jayatu vrsa, jayatu vrsadhvaja, display a distinct leaning towards Shaivism.” [<strong><em>Rajatarangini</em></strong>; M. A. Stein; Footnote to I, 289]
<p>Mihirakula oppressed the Buddhists and behaved with them cruelly. At his instigation not only were many Buddhists murdered but many Stupas, Caityas, Vihaaras, and other Buddhist establishments were destroyed in Punjab and Kashmir. The description of his cruelties as described in the <em>Rajatarangini </em>is corroborated by the description given by Hiuen Tsang in his book <strong><em>Si-Yu-Ki</em></strong>. He writes,</p>
<p>“He exterminated the royal family and the chief minister, overthrew stupas, destroyed the sangharamas, altogether one thousand six hundred foundations.” [Si-Yu-Ki. Buddhist Records of the Western World Tr. Samuel Beal, 1969; Book iv, Page 171]
<p>Mihirakula’s hostility towards the Buddhist was shared by the Shaivite Brahmins. Kalhana comments in the <em>Rajatarangini </em>on the greed of the Brahmins who eagerly accepted grants of land from Mihirakula.</p>
<p>“Brahmins from Gandhara, resembling himself in their habits and verily themselves the lowest of the twice-born, accepted Agraharas from him.” [<em><a href="http://www.dli.ernet.in/cgi-bin/metainfo.cgi?&amp;title1=kalhana%27s%20rajtarangini%20a%20chronicle%20of%20the%20kings%20of%20kashmir&amp;author1=stein,%20m.a.&amp;subject1=kashmir%20history&amp;year=1900%20&amp;language1=english&amp;pages=580&amp;barcode=99999990253849&amp;author2=NULL&amp;identifier1=NULL&amp;publisher1=archibald%20constable%20and%20co.%20ltd.&amp;contributor1=NULL&amp;vendor1=NONE&amp;scanningcentre1=uod,delhi&amp;slocation1=NONE&amp;sourcelib1=central%20library,%20delhi%20university&amp;scannerno1=0&amp;digitalrepublisher1=NULL&amp;digitalpublicationdate1=0000-00-00&amp;numberedpages1=0&amp;unnumberedpages1=0&amp;rights1=not%20available&amp;copyrightowner1=NULL&amp;copyrightexpirydate1=0000-00-00&amp;format1=book%20&amp;url=/data4/upload/0106/653" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Rajatarangini<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></em> I, 307; M. A. Stein]
<p>This shows that the Brahmins were hand in glove with his slaughter of Buddhists and the destruction of the Buddhist establishments. So, the fake polemics of some Hindu writers that Mihirakula was not a Hindu or that his destruction of Buddhists establishments cannot be tied to Hindus are unfounded.</p>
<p>Another hateful persecutor of Buddhists was Pushyamitra Sunga, founder of the Sunga Dynasty. Several Chinese and Japanese historians mention Pushyamitra’s name at the head of the list of persecutors. Buddhist writers portray Pushyanitra as a cruel persecutor of the religion of Sakyamuni (Buddha). Pushyamitra, a militant follower of Brahminism, assassinated the last Mauryan Emperor Brhadratha, capturing the throne of Magadha and founded the Sunga Dynasty. It ruled for a period of one hundred and twelve years.  Pushyamitra had to justify his position as head of the Brahmanic reaction by persecuting the Buddhists and destroying Buddhist monasteries on the one hand and restoring the sacrificial ceremonies of the Brahmanic faith on the other, for which his principal helpers were Patanjali and also perhaps Manu, the author of the <em>Manusmriti. </em>who was also his contemporary according to some scholars. The persecution of the Buddhists by Pushyamitra, was a logical sequence of the Brahmanic reaction and the political <em>coup d’etat</em>. The Buddhist text <em>Divyavadana </em>mentions the persecutions of Pushyamitra and his destruction of Buddhist stupas and monasteries. Hindutva apologists such as Dr. Koenraad Elst have tried to refute these charges on Pushyamitra, saying that they are “rendered improbable by external evidence”. Elst then claims that “he (Pushyamitra) allowed and patronized the construction of monasteries and Buddhist universities in his domains, as well as the still-extant stupa of Sanchi.” Although he gives no reference for this claim, it is possible that he was referring to the epigraph on the <strong>gateway of Barhut,</strong> which mentions its erection “during the supremacy of the Sungas“. The inscription uses the words <strong>सुगनं रजे</strong> (During the reign of Sungas). It does not necessarily include the reign of Pushyamitra. It only means ‘during the reign of Sungas’. The gateway was constructed during the reign of his successors who were more tolerant to Buddhism than the founder of the dynasty and leader of the Brahmanic reaction. That the gateways were erected long after the time of Pushyamitra is also the opinion of eminent archaeologists like Mr. N. G. Mazumdar, who writes,</p>
<p>“The Sungas referred to in this inscription formed a dynasty which was founded by the general (Senapati) Pushyamitra, succeeding the Mauryas about 180 B.C. <strong>The gateways, however, appear to have been set up about a century later, towards the close o the Sunga period</strong>.” [A Guide To The Sculptures In The Indian Museum, Pt.I N. G. Mazumdar, 1937 Ed., Page 13]
<p>Dr. Elst also quotes the historian of Buddhism, Etienne Lamotte, who wrote, “To judge from the documents, Pushyamitra must be acquitted through lack of proof”. [History of Indian Buddhism, Institut Orientaliste, Louvain-la-Neuve 1988/1958, p.109] Firstly, this reference is incorrect as the page number is 392. Even then, let me provide the complete quote of Etienne Lamotte. He writes,</p>
<p>“To judge from the documents, Pushyamitra must be acquitted through lack of proof. Nevertheless, as was remarked by H. Kern, in view of the varied opinions, <strong>it is possible that, in some localities, there may have been pillages of monasteries, perhaps with the tacit permission of the governors</strong>. ”</p>
<p>Prominent Indian historian, professor Romila Thapar writes,</p>
<p>“Buddhist sources claim that they (Sungas) persecuted the Buddhists and destroyed their monasteries and places of worship. This could have been an exaggeration, but archaeological evidence reveals that Buddhist monuments in the Sunga domain were at this time in disrepair and being renovated. However, if the chronology of these monuments shifts forward as is now being suggested, then this would make them post-Sunga renovations. Nevertheless, even if some renovations were of a later date, the damage to the stupa at Sanchi, and to the monastery at Kaushambi dates to Shunga times. Added emphasis is given to this from Pushyamitra having performed <em>ashvamedhas</em>, or horse sacrifices. This is sometimes viewed as indicating support of Vedic Brahmanism and a disapproval of heterodox sects.”  <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="367" height="253" class="wp-image-7357 alignright" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201.jpeg" alt="https://truthabouthinduism.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/083014_1719_hinduismand6.jpg?w=551&amp;h=380" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201.jpeg 367w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201-300x207.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 367px) 100vw, 367px" /><strong> [The Penguin History of Early India from the origins to AD 1300, Romila Thapar, 2002 Edition, Pg. 210</strong>]
<p>This view of Professor Thapar was confirmed when <strong>Deorkothar Stupas</strong> were excavated by P. K. Mishra (Archaeological Survey of India) in 1999 till 2000. The story about this Stupa was published by P. K. Mishra on the official website of the <em>Archaeology</em> magazine, a publication of the Archaeological Institute of America. P. K. Mishra wrote,</p>
<p>“The ancient Buddhist text <em>Divyavadanam </em>speaks of the death and destruction brought about by Pushyamitra Sunga, who ruled in the first quarter of the second century B.C., in a bid to glorify Hinduism. During his reign, Buddhist monuments were wantonly destroyed. Although archaeological evidence is meager in this regard, <strong>it seems likely that the Deorkothar stupa was destroyed as a result of Pushyamitra Sunga’s fanaticism. The exposed remains at Deorkothar bear evidence of deliberate destruction datable to his reign</strong>. The three-tiered railing is damaged; railing pillars lie, broken to smithereens, on stone flooring. Twenty pieces of pillar have been recovered, each fragment itself fractured. The site offers no indication of natural destruction.”</p>

<p>Further Reading</p>
<p>Buddhist scholars have also laid claim to many Hindu temples being original Buddhist Shrines. A book written by Dr. K. Jamnadas was titled <em>‘Tirupati Balaji was a Buddhist Shrine’</em>. In this book, the author has given huge stock of evidence to prove that the temple which is today sacred to Hindus was once a Buddhist Shrine. Readers are advised to make up their own mind after reading the book themselves and verifying the proofs.The book can be downloaded from the link <a href="http://www.ambedkar.org/Tirupati/Tirupati.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">http://www.ambedkar.org/Tirupati/Tirupati.pdf<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>

<p><strong>Intolerance towards Jains</strong></p>
<p>The jains also were not immune to the Brahmanic persecution. Like Buddhism, the Jain religion is also reviled in the Hindu scriptures. Padma Puran Bhumi Khand 2/38/25-27 says</p>
<p>जैनधर्मं समाश्रित्य सर्वे पापप्रमोहिताः</p>
<p>वेदाचारं परित्यज्य पापं यास्यन्ति मानवाः</p>
<p>पापस्य मूलमेवं वै जैनधर्मो न संशयः ,</p>
<p>अनेन मुग्धा राजेंद्र महामोहेन पातिताः</p>
<p>“Men deluded by sins, resort to the Jaina religion. They abandon the Vedic practices and will committ sins. There is no doubt that the Jaina faith is the root of sin. O best King, the fall of those men, who are sinners, is brought about by this great delusion (i.e Jainism).”</p>
<p>Bhavishya Puran, prati sarg parv 3,/3/28/53 says,</p>
<p>न वदेद् यावनीं भाषां प्राणैः कण्ठगतैरापि ,</p>
<p>गजैरापीड्यमानोsपि  न गच्छेद् जैनमन्दिरम्</p>
<p>“What ever may be the amount of pain inflicted, and even though the life be in jeopardy, let not the language of the Yavanas (Muslims) be employed in speech. Let no one save his life by seeking refuge in a Jain temple, even though he be pursued by a mad elephant, (for it is better to be killed by him than to set foot in a Jain temple).”</p>
<p><strong>Persecution of Jains</strong></p>

<p>Jains were brutally persecuted by Hindu Shaivites and Vaishnavites. The Shaivite were aided in their persecutions by the kings of the Chola Dynasty. The marriage of the Chola king Sundara Pandya with the sister of Rajendra, lead to the his conversion to Shaivism. Sundara became a fanatic Saivite and he persecuted the compatriots of his earlier faith, with ruthless cruelty. It is said that he sentenced to death by impalement <strong>not less than 8000 of his subjects who did not want to be converted to Shaivism</strong>. The impalement of these unfortunate people is said to have been graphically depicted on many sculptures on the walls of the temple of Tivatur in North Arcot (<a href="http://www.dli.ernet.in/cgi-bin/metainfo.cgi?&amp;title1=Coins%20Of%20Southern%20India&amp;author1=Elliot,%20W.&amp;subject1=GEOGRAPHY.%20BIOGRAPHY.%20HISTORY&amp;year=1886%20&amp;language1=english&amp;pages=195&amp;barcode=4990010112828&amp;author2=&amp;identifier1=&amp;publisher1=Cosmo%20Publications,%20New%20Delhi&amp;contributor1=&amp;vendor1=NONE&amp;scanningcentre1=cdack&amp;slocation1=NONE&amp;sourcelib1=THE%20ASIATIC%20SOCIETY,%20KOLKATA&amp;scannerno1=0&amp;digitalrepublisher1=Digital%20Library%20Of%20India&amp;digitalpublicationdate1=2007-02-02&amp;numberedpages1=&amp;unnumberedpages1=&amp;rights1=In%20Public%20Domain&amp;copyrightowner1=&amp;copyrightexpirydate1=&amp;format1=Tagged%20Image%20File%20Format%20&amp;url=/rawdataupload/upload/0112/830" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Coins of Southern India; Sir.

<p>Another scholar, T. A. Gopinath Rao, writing about the dating of Puranas and Agamas, in his book Elements of Hindu Iconolgraphy, reveals that the event of the impalement of Jains is mentioned in Uttara-Kaaranaagama. He writes,</p>

<p>Swami Dayananda Saraswati, founder of Arya Samaj, also speaks about the destruction of Jain idols at the hands of Hindus or former Jains. In his book, Satyarth Prakash, under the topic of Shankaracharya, he writes,</p>
<p>“For ten years he (Shankaracharya) toured all over the country, refuted Jainism and advocated the Vedic religion. All the broken images that are now-a-days dug out of the earth were broken in the time of Shankar, whilst those that are found whole here and there under the ground had been buried by the Jainis for fear of their being broken” [Satyarth Prakash, Agniveer Edition, Chapter 11, Page 224]
<p><strong>Sectarian Intolerance within Hinduism</strong></p>
<p>Shaivites and Vaishnavites are the two major sects under the umbrella name ‘Hinduism’, takinng Shiva and Vishnu respectively as the chief objects of their worship. Srimad Bhagvata Purana is a Vaishnava scripture. Concerning Shiva Bhaktas (devotees) it says,</p>
<p>भवव्रतधरा ये च ये च तान् समनुव्रताः</p>
<p>पाखंडिनस्ते भवन्तु सच्छास्त्रपरिपन्थि</p>
<p>मुमुक्षवो घोररूपान् हित्वा भूतपतीनथ ,</p>
<p>नारायणकलाः शान्ताः भजन्तीत्यनसूयवः</p>
<p>“One who takes a vow to satisfy Shiva or who follows such principles will certainly become an atheist and be diverted from transcendental scriptural injunctions. Those who vow to worship Shiva are so foolish that they imitate him by keeping long hair on their heads. When initiated into worship of Lord Śiva, they prefer to live on wine, flesh and other such things.” [Bhagvatapuran 4/2/28-29]
<p>On the other hand the Shaivite scripture Saur purana has this response to give to the Vaishnavites</p>
<p>चतुर्दशविद्यासु गीयते चन्द्रशेखरः</p>
<p>तेन तुल्यो यदा विष्णुः ब्रह्मा वा यदि गद्यते</p>
<p>षष्टिवर्षसहस्राणि विष्ठायां जायते कृमिः</p>
<p>“Fourteen sciences sing the praises of Shiva. A person who puts Brahma or Vishnu on an equal level to Shiva, it incurs him a grievous sin on account of which <strong>he will suffer for 60,000 years as an insect</strong>.” [Saur Puran 40/15,17]
<p>Continuing the tirade, Padma Puran says,</p>
<p>तस्माद् विष्णोः प्रसादो वै सेवितव्यो द्विजन्मना,</p>
<p>इतरेषां देवानां निमल्यिं गर्हितं भवेत् .</p>
<p>सकृदेव हि योsश्नाति ब्राह्मणो ज्ञानदुर्बलः</p>
<p>निर्मल्यिं शंकरा दीनां स चांडालो भवेद ध्रुवं</p>
<p>“Dwijas (Brahmin, Khatriya, Vaishya) should only eat the Prasad offered to Vishnu, not of any other deity. If any foolish Brahmin, even once, will consume the prasad of Shiva, it is certain that he will be born as a Chandal (outcaste).”</p>
<p>विष्णुदर्शनमात्रेण शिवद्रोहः प्रजायते ,</p>
<p>शिवद्रोहान्न संदेहो नरकं याति दांरूणम्</p>
<p>Even having a glimpse of Vishnu, is tantamount to being a traitor to Shiva and such a person will be cast into hell.</p>
<p><strong>Modern Examples</strong></p>
<p>Swami Dayanand Saraswati (real name Moolshanker), was the founder of Arya Samaj cult. In his book Satyarth Prakash, he criticized various sects in Hinduism in a very rude manner. Few days back, a facebook fan page of preacher Dr. Zakir Naik, uploaded some images with quotes from Naik about the Hindu god Ganesha. Hindus took offence and the notorious anti-Muslim organization, Agniveer, spread this news like wildfire on the social media. Below is a snapshot from Agniveer’s official page on facebook.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="602" height="466" class="wp-image-7359" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201-2.png" alt="https://truthabouthinduism.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/083014_1719_hinduismand8.png?w=625" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201-2.png 602w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201-2-300x232.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></p>

<p>But the question here is, if Naik is condemned as a terrorist for asking a logical question, what would the Hindutva zealots say about the quotations I have provided from their own books about other religions and sects? Moreover, why not call their own Guru, Dayanand Saraswati as a terrorist also, because has expresses the same ‘offensive’ views about Hindu sects, scriptures and deities. Following quotes from his hateful book Satyarth Prakash, will suffice.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks about Srimad Bhagavat Puran</strong></p>
<p>“Fie on you! O you senseless, <strong>idiotic author of the Bhagvat Puranana. What a shameless creature you were!</strong> You did not feel a bit of shame or hesitation in writing such falsehood! You became so utterly blind.” [Satyarth Prakash, Agniveer Edition, Page 264]
<p><strong>Remarks about Idol Worship</strong></p>
<p><strong>Idol worship is a fraud</strong>. The Jaiinees were the authors of this mode of worship. [ibid Page 240]
<p>It is<strong> evil practices like idol worship</strong> that are responsible for the existence of millions of idle, lazy, indolent, and beggarly priests in India, who are mainly answerable for this wide-spread ignorance, fraud and mendacity in the country. [ibid 384] What an insult to the priests of India! Again, if you take to idol-worship, instead of keeping company with learned men, <strong>you will become greater dunces than you were before</strong>. [ibid Page 369]
<p><strong>Remarks about Guru Nanak</strong></p>
<p>“He could never have done unless <strong>he was anxious to gain public applause, fame and glory. He must have sought after fame</strong> or he would have preached in the language he know and told the people that he had not read Sanskrit. Since he was a little vain, he may possibly have even resorted to some sort of make-believe to gain reputation and acquire fame,..” [ibid page 289]
<p>These are only few samples of modern intolerance amongst Hindus. This article has exposed the double standards of Hindutva zealots who are so militant vis a vis Islam and always grab the opportunity to demonize Muslims and Islam. They should first do a good thorough study of their own books and history before pointing their fingers at us. The issue of Caste persecution also comes under the theme of religious intolerance, however, I have already written on that topic. You can read it here ( <a href="/index.php/2014/01/01/caste-and-racial-discrimination/" data-wpel-link="internal">/index.php/2014/01/01/caste-and-racial-discrimination/</a> ). Time and time again Hindutva brigade bring up the issue of banning the Qurán. Before doing so, let them establish an example by banning their own Vedas, Puranas, etc and books like Satyarth Prakash, for now we all know the intolerant messages they preach.</p>

<p>We studied about Bal Gangadhar Tilak in school, we were presented with the wrong picture of Tilak that he was a great freedom fighter and a great human being. But we were never told about his real side. This article intends to uncover real side of this Brahmin leader who was communal, misogynist, casteist, xenophobic. This article is based on the book &#8220;Bal Gangadhar Tilak: Popular Readings&#8221; by Biswamoy Pati. Biswamoy Pati was an Associate Professor in Department of History, Faculty of Social Sciences at the University of Delhi. His book also includes the work of J.V. Naik, Parimala V. Rao, Bhupendra Yadav, and Shri Krishan. The primary sources cited in the book are the columns in newspapers like the Marathi &#8220;Kesari&#8221; and English &#8220;The Mahratta&#8217; by Bal Gangadhar Tilak. The book provides great insight into some of the facts which are brushed under the carpet by Saffronized textbooks in India. It is not possible to quote every detail from the book, so I request you to purchase the book &#8220;Bal Gangadhar Tilak: Popular Readings&#8221; by Biswamoy Pati.</p>

<h1><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Misogynist Views<br />
</strong></span></h1>
<p>Tilak quoting the Manu Smriti said that women must not be independent,<br />
&#8220;Referring to the Dharmashastra of Manu, Tilak asserted, &#8216;There is a verse the beginning of which is that women should always remain under guardianship: when children under their parents, when young under their husbands, when widows under their children but our Government has even surpassed Manu. They have liberated the women and placed the men under the surveillance of an everlasting nature&#8217;&#8230;Speaking to the Hindu Mahila Samaj he insisted that the supreme duty of women was to produce great patriots. They were also advised to perform as teachers of the nation, their mission as teachers was not to offer textual knowledge, but good etiquette and conduct, civility, and self-sacrifice.&#8221;<br />
<strong>Bal Gangadhar Tilak: Popular Readings, p.78, by Biswamoy Pati, Published by Primus Books, 2011<br />
</strong><br />
Since Tilak venerated the Dharmashastras, he supported child marriage and paedophilia and also opposed Age of Consent Bill,<br />
&#8220;Tilak&#8217;s opposition to reform was not new but it assumed new proportions during the controversy over the &#8216;Age of Consent Bill&#8217; in 1891, in a context when Behramji Merwanji Malabari campaigned intensively in its favour. This was occasioned by the death of the child-bride Phulmoni in Calcutta, when her husband had sexual intercourse with her. Under the plea of upholding the idea of non-intervention in indigenous customs and traditions, and in the name of voluntary prescription, Tilak attacked the Bill as &#8216;damaging&#8217; to the traditions and shastras of India.&#8221;<br />
<strong>Bal Gangadhar Tilak: Popular Readings, p.77, by Biswamoy Pati, Published by Primus Books, 2011</strong></p>
<p>Now some of you may be wondering that the Age of Consent Bill may have increased the age of marriageable girls to 18 years, but you would be shocked to read that the Bill aimed to increase marriageable age of Hindu girls from ten to twelve and this was opposed by Tilak,<br />
&#8220;In the case of Phulmoni, this child bride who was ten years old died when her husband twenty-nine years older than her had forcible intercourse with her, towards the end of 1890 in Calcutta. This incident created a stir. On the basis of the &#8216;shastras&#8217; Tilak argued that Hindu girls had to be married before attaining puberty, although consummation had to wait until puberty. A host of historians have discussed the issues involved, connecting it to the Age of Consent Bill that aimed to increase the marriageable age of Hindu girls from ten to twelve years.&#8221;<br />

<h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Against Girl&#8217;s Education<br />
</strong></span></h2>
<p>Bal Gangadhar Tilak who is hailed as a great Hindu scholar and freedom fighter opposed education for girls, it was not just him but even his associates opposed girl&#8217;s education. Tilak&#8217;s associates in the Shivaji festival were Shivram Mahadec Paranjpe and Shridhar Ganesh Jinsivale who were staunchly against women&#8217;s education. Birds of same feather flocks together.<br />
&#8220;The third campaign led by the Nationalists was against education for girls. In 1884, Ranade and other Reformers established the first girls&#8217; high school in Poona. The school admitted girls belonging to all castes. For Tilak this amounted to double treachery. He attacked the school for teaching English, mathematics, and science to girls and insisted that &#8216;the curriculum of the girls&#8217; school should consist of vernacular, needle work and sanitation&#8217;. Tilak repeatedly insisted that teaching English to women &#8216;amounted to loss of nationality&#8217;. He argued that &#8216;English education had [a] dewomanising impact on women, by denying them a happy worldly life&#8217;. He also argued that it &#8216;hurt the sentiments of the orthodox Hindus&#8217; as it &#8216;destroyed the Hindu household&#8217;. Tilak articulated that &#8216;teaching Hindu women to read English would ruin their precious traditional virtues and would make them immoral and insubordinate&#8217;.&#8221;<br />
<strong>Bal Gangadhar Tilak: Popular Readings, p.16, by Biswamoy Pati, Published by Primus Books, 2011<br />
</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;In 1884, William Wedderburn (one of the founder members of the Indian National Congress and twice its president) proposed a municipality-sponsored high school for girls. Tilak fervently opposed this, since for him women must only &#8216;to look after the house&#8217;, and he argued that society would suffer if girls were provided equal educational opportunities, since the duties of men and women were different. As Tilak saw it, this distinction between duties and rights was of a fundamental nature that set the traditional Dharmashastras apart from from Western legal thoughts. The former assigned specific spheres of duty in accordance with age, gender and caste. He went on to add: &#8216;[If you] start with founding a high school for girls&#8230;it would soon lead to women running away from their homes&#8217;.&#8221;<br />

</strong></p>
<h1><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Upheld Caste System &amp; had high regard for Manu Smriti &amp; other Dharmashastras<br />
</strong></span></h1>
<p>Because he adhered to Chitpavan sub-sect of the Brahmin caste so he was a staunch supporter of casteism.<br />
&#8220;They defined their identity in political terms and as rashtravadi or &#8216;nationalists&#8217; and asserted that &#8216;they alone could show the right way to the nation&#8217;. Tilak argued that to be a Nationalist one had to defend the varnashrama dharma (caste system) and oppose reform. Summing up the Nationalist defense of the caste system, he wrote, &#8216;had it not been for the influence of caste, the Hindu nation would have long ceased to exist&#8217;…&#8217;Caste alone is the basis of a Hindu nation&#8217;.&#8221;<br />

</strong></p>
<h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Forbade Education to Lower Castes and to Non-Brahmins<br />
</strong></span></h2>
<p>&#8220;The Nationalists mounted their second campaign against the Reforms regarding the introduction of compulsory education and university reforms. Tilak argued that teaching reading, writing, and the rudiments of history, geography, and mathematics to non-brahmin children would actually harm them. He also opposed the admission of children form &#8216;untouchable&#8217; Mahar and Mang communities in schools. The Nationalists effectively controlled nine out of eleven municipalities in the Marathi-speaking areas of Bombay Presidency, and all of them turned down the introduction of compulsory primary education. They prevented the entry of untouchable children into schools with considerable success.&#8221;<br />

</strong></p>
<h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Opposed Inter-Caste Marriage Bill<br />
</strong></span></h2>
<p>Bal Gangadhar Tilak vehemently opposed Hindu Marriages (Validity) Bill 1918 which aimed to allow inter-caste marriage. Tilak argued against the Bill citing Hindu scriptures,<br />
&#8220;When Vithalbhai Ptel introduced the &#8216;Hindu Marriages (Validity) Bill&#8217; in the Imperial Council (1918) to legalize inter-caste marriage, it was supported by Sriniwas Shastri, Tej Bahadur Sapru, and Lala Lajpat Rai. However, Tilak opposed it. In a letter to the editor of the Mahratta he said it would interfere with the law of succession. Tilak described marriage as a sacrosanct ritual, which should be treated neither an entry in a register nor a mutual agreement. He warned against borrowing &#8216;other people&#8217;s customs&#8217; and legal patterns. Reiterating that India had a multiplicity of castes, the absence of common dining practices and matrimonial relations among castes, and that even marriages within sub-castes were not tolerable to people, he investigated scriptural positions on such marriages. On the basis of this he confirmed that anuloma marriage (i.e. marriage of a male of high caste to a low caste women) was in principle acceptable to Manu. Neverthless, he argued that since the aims of marriage were twofold to produce offspring and the continuation of the family (with its traditions and inheritance) and, as Manu had specifically and purposely deprived the varna-sankara (hybrid progeny of such mixed marriages) of inheritance and the right to pind-dan (offerings to ancestors), such legislation was neither sensible nor suitable. Even as he reiterated that the individual had the freedom of choice, he questioned whether a person could be a Hindu and not marry according to the Dharmashastras.<br />

</strong></p>
<h1><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Hindu Rashtra (Hindu Nation)<br />
</strong></span></h1>
<p>It were Hindu leaders like Tilak, Savarkar, Gowalkar, Lala Lajpat Rai and many others who dreamt of establishing a Hindu Rashtra, they had proposed division of India into a Hindu Rashtra even before the Muslim League adopted two-nation theory. Tilak not only advocated for Hindu Rashtra but even opposed secularism,<br />
&#8220;Tilak called upon his supporters &#8216;to capture the institutions like the Poona Sarvajanik Sabha and the Congress&#8217; to facilitate &#8216;the regeneration of the Hindu nation&#8217;. Ranade opposed the aggressive emphasis on the Hindu nation by pointing out that &#8216;it is not a mere accident that has turned the vast country of ours into a temple where all religions meet in adoration to the common God of all in a way that can be said of no other country&#8217;. Tilak called Ranade&#8217;s secularism an &#8216;unnational tendency that strike[s] a deathblow at the very fabric which has interwoven us into the Hindu nation&#8217;.<br />
<strong>Bal Gangadhar Tilak: Popular Readings, p.20, by Biswamoy Pati, Published by Primus Books, 2011<br />
</strong><br />
&#8220;He asked if these common allegiances to the Vedas, Gita and Ramayana were not our common heritage. He exhorted the Hindus of different sects to forget minor differences between themselves so that &#8216;by the grace of providence, we shall&#8230;be able to consolidate all different sects into a mighty Hindu nation. This ought to be the ambition of every Hindu&#8217; (emphasis mine).&#8221;<br />

</strong></p>
<h1><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Communal<br />
</strong></span></h1>
<p>Bal Gangadhar Tilak during his initial career was so communal that he couldn&#8217;t even tolerate some educated Muslims establishing English school for Muslim students so as to employ them in government services,<br />
In 1885, Badruddin Tayabji and a few other educated Muslims in Bombay established the Anjuman-i-Islam to encourage Muslims to enrol for English education. They addressed a memorial to the government to employ educated Muslims in government services. It received wholehearted support from the Hindus, and Lala Uma Shankar was made the Vice President of the Bombay Presidency Mahomedan Educational Conference. Tilak called the memorial &#8216;a good deal of exaggeration&#8217; and commented that, &#8216;better say immediate orders should be issued that the Hindu being a conquered nation should be deported bag and baggage and the Mohammedans again restored to the throne of Delhi&#8217;. Tilak constructed a fearful image of Muslims as &#8216;the descendants of the Pathans and Moguls who were once a terror&#8217;, and had began to assert that they were receiving the support of the British. He argued that the government preferred educated Muslims to Hindu candidates in government service.&#8221;<br />
<strong>Bal Gangadhar Tilak: Popular Readings, p.18, by Biswamoy Pati, Published by Primus Books, 2011</strong></p>
<p>Tilak blamed Muslims as the first aggressors whenever a Hindu-Muslim riot broke out, a leader is supposed to calm down the situation but Tilak used violence to further his political mileage and used it as an opportunity to instigate Hindus.<br />
&#8220;In September 1890, two anonymous letters in the Mahratta reported riots between the two communities in Belgaum. Six months earlier in the month of March, during the Holi festival, disturbances had taken place in which three persons were killed and thirty-six were injured. After providing a graphic description of the incident, the letters stressed the aggressive physical attack by the Muslims and the partiality shown by the district administration to Muslims. In his editorial Tilak supported the statements made in these anonymous letters. He argued that first, the Mohamedans &#8216;in their fanatical zeal&#8230;were aggressors&#8230;the attack was deliberate as they were jealous of the Hindus&#8217;. He said that &#8216;the government under the guise of religious neutrality is actually supporting Muslims&#8217;.&#8221;<br />
<strong>Bal Gangadhar Tilak: Popular Readings, p.19, by Biswamoy Pati, Published by Primus Books, 2011<br />
</strong><br />
We shall also discuss whether Muslims were really the &#8220;first aggressors&#8221; as alleged by Tilak.</p>
<h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Justified attacks on Muslims as &#8220;Retaliation&#8221;<br />
</strong></span></h2>
<p>&#8220;Tilak declared that Hindus had resorted to a counter-attack not just in self-defence but &#8216;to give an opportunity to Mohamedans to experience vindictive power of those whom they had so seriously offended. The Hindus&#8217; counter-attack contributed in no small degree to the minimizing of the contingency of similar outbreaks in future&#8217;.<br />
The Commisioner of Police of Bombay R.H. Vincent was injured in the clashes, which had left 80 persons dead and 700 injured. He brought the riots under control within two days. He attributed the violence to the leaders of the cow protection societies.&#8221;<br />
<strong>Bal Gangadhar Tilak: Popular Readings, p.21, by Biswamoy Pati, Published by Primus Books, 2011<br />
</strong><br />
Despite Commissioner Vincent holding Cow Protection Movement&#8217;s Hindu extremists responsible for the violence Tilak blamed Muslims as first perpetrators, Tilak criticized the British government and warned of &#8220;Retaliation&#8221; against Muslims,<br />
&#8220;It must be distinctly borne in mind that the people of Maharashtra if left to themselves, have sufficient capacity and intelligence to make the Mahomedan respect the rights of the Hindus&#8230;we in the Deccan, never lived by the sufferance of the Mahomedans&#8230;It is true that the Marathas are not as rash and inconsiderate as the Mahomedan roughs so as to be aggressive but recent riots have made it plain that they will not be slow, if assaulted to take revenge upon the Mahomedans&#8230;[T]he history of Marathas bears testimony to the fact that had it not been for the appearance of the British on the stage, the Hindus of these parts would have wrested the power out of the hands of the Moguls.&#8221;<br />
<strong>Bal Gangadhar Tilak: Popular Readings, p.21, by Biswamoy Pati, Published by Primus Books, 2011<br />
</strong><br />
<strong>Tilak and Christians<br />
</strong><br />
Tilak was excommunicated by the Shankaracharya,<br />
&#8220;Tilak performed prayascita (penance) for drinking tea with missionaries in 1892 and for undertaking a trip to England in 1919. But Tilak also criticized the orthodox section among the Hindus who compelled him to do this penance.&#8221;<br />
<strong>Bal Gangadhar Tilak: Popular Readings, p.43, by Biswamoy Pati, Published by Primus Books, 2011<br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Called for the boycott of Muslims<br />
</strong><br />
&#8220;He emphasized that &#8216;the Hindu nation will, as one-man resolve to have nothing to do&#8230;with the Mahomedans&#8217;. This suggesion for a boycott received little response, and the Reformers criticized Tilak for &#8216;deliberately creating animosity between the two communities&#8217;.&#8221;<br />
Bal Gangadhar Tilak: Popular Readings, p.25-26, by Biswamoy Pati, Published by Primus Books, 2011<br />
Tilak&#8217;s associate had also called for boycott of Muslims,<br />
&#8220;The government for its part held Barve responsible for encouraging the Hindus to boycott the Muslims in order to maintain the feeling of animosity after the compromise was reached.&#8221;<br />

<h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Ganapati Festival<br />
</strong></span></h2>
<p>Bal Gangadhar Tilak was one of the first to make public celebrations of Ganesh Chaturthi and he was the first one to politicize it. Tilak&#8217;s celebration of Ganesh Chaturthi is an perfect example of hating other religions more than loving one&#8217;s own, the reason he started public celebration of Ganesh Chaturthi is to deter Hindus from participating in Muslims&#8217; Muharram because he didn&#8217;t like Hindus <a href="http://donboscoindia.com/english/resourcedownload.php?pno=1&amp;secid=246" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">carrying the corpses<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> of Hasan and Hussain (Grandsons of Prophet Muhammad <span style="font-size: 10pt;">ﷺ</span>). Misinformation is also spread even by some secular Hindus that Tilak began grand celebrations of Ganesh Chaturthi and Shivaji festival to mobilize Hindus against the Britishers.<br />
<strong>Ganesh Chaturthi celebrated publicly by Tilak to deter Hindus from participating in Muharram<br />
</strong><br />
&#8220;Nevertheles, these political manoeuvres actually accentuated fissures and divisions within Indian society. With the revitalization of the Ganpati festival, the issue of &#8216;music at the mosque&#8217; became a prominent concern in the public domain, increasingly communalized. In an article, Moharram va Hinduchi Vritti, Tilak advised Hindus not to participate in Moharram: it was a demonstration of stupidity and lack of pride.<br />
<strong>Bal Gangadhar Tilak: Popular Readings, p.74, by Biswamoy Pati, Published by Primus Books, 2011<br />
</strong><br />
During these celebrations there were also songs urging Hindus to stop participating in Muharram,<br />
&#8220;The tradition of joining Hindu-Muslim festivities was giving way, initially to strategic emulation of Muslims by Hindus, and later on, to strident condemnation of Muslims. Hindus had participated in Muslim processions earlier, but this give-and-take began to disappear in the 1890s. It seems that even while public festivities associated with the Ganapati festival grew, Hindu artisans, musicians and dancers continued to participate in Muharram processions. The 1894 Ganpati festival was promoted on the lines of Muharram in Poona. The organizers were successful: 25,000 persons participated in the Ganpati procession in 1894 and another 50,000 showered the procession with sweets, parched rice, and gulal from the roadside. In the Ganpati festival of 1894, a song urged Hindus to stop worshipping Muslim tabuts (floats) of Muharram and to return to Ganpati and the holy cow:<br />
<em>Oh! Why have you abandoned today the Hindu religion?<br />
</em><br />
<em>Have you forgotten Ganpati, Shiva and Marti?<br />
</em><br />
<em>What have you gained by worshipping tabuts?<br />
</em><br />
<em>What boon has Allah conferred upon you<br />
</em><br />
<em>That you have become Mussalmans today?<br />
</em><br />
<em>Do not be friendly to a religion which is alien condemnation<br />
</em><br />
<em>Do not give up your religion and be fallen.<br />
</em><br />
<em>Do not at all venerate the tabuts,<br />
</em><br />
<em>The cow is our mother, do not forget her.<br />

</strong></p>
<p><strong>Violence during Ganpati festival<br />
</strong><br />
District Police Act of 1890 prohibited playing music near all worship places. But Tilak didn&#8217;t care about this and insisted on playing music near mosques as a show of might. Bal Gangadhar Tilak didn&#8217;t care either about Muslim sentiments or about the law, he brazenly defied the law which lead to a riot, it is possible that the riot was orchestrated by none other than Tilak through his associate Barve, as violence used to erupt only when the celebration was by Brahmins, more particularly by Nationalists (Tilak and his associates). During Ganpati Celebration, Hindus vandalized Patel mosque in Yeola and also vandalized a temple, police and authorities present there blamed the Hindu mob but still that didn&#8217;t seem to convince Tilak and as usual he blamed Muslims as first aggressors. Hindus were not brainwashed in a day, they were brainwashed by their politicians and religious scholars over a span of centuries, now you know why present day <a href="http://www.jantakareporter.com/india/viral-video-shows-hindutva-goons-threatening-outside-delhi-mosque/180213/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Hindus halt procession<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> near mosques and raise objectionable slogans and if Muslims react to these provocations then Muslims are accused of pelting stones at peacefull procession. And I quote from the book,<br />
&#8220;Ramachandra Ganesh Barve, a close associate of Tilak, at Yeola in the Nasik district was prompt to utilize the Bombay riots politically. Barve had stood by Tilak over the past twelve years to oppose the Deccan Agriculturists Relief Act and the reduced power of Mamlatdars. Now he extended complete support to the ideas of Tilak. Within a month (on 18 September) Yeola witnessed riots during the Ganapati festival. The Patel Mosque and the Muralidhar Temple were desecrated. The Mamlatdar, the chief and the head constable (all of the Hindus) who were present when the attack took place, reported to the government that &#8216;certain Hindus had attacked both these places of worship&#8217;. Tilak called it &#8216;aggression by the Muslim of Yeola&#8217; and criticized the district administration for &#8216;encouraging the Muslims to demand unjust interference, with the exercise by the Hindu community of their customary right of carrying their idols in a chariot procession accompanied by music according to established customs&#8217;.&#8221;<br />

<p><strong>Tilak made Hindus play anti-Muslim songs during Ganpati celebrations and despite prohibition, Bal Gangadhar Tilak insisted on playing music near mosques<br />
</strong><br />
&#8220;In August 1894, Tilak began a rigorous campaign supporting the playing of music in front of mosques. He discussed at length the District Police Act of 1890 which prohibited the playing of music &#8216;within forty paces of all places of worship during hours of services and at all times while passing a mosque, when Puran, or Kuran is being read near a street, while passing public offices and when carriages or horses are passing&#8217;. Tilak argued that the clauses of the act &#8216;speak of music in or near a street and not specifically of music on the occasion of festivals and ceremonies&#8217;. He went on to proclaim that the police and the Act were &#8216;ridiculous&#8217; and that &#8216;the police very often create or attempt to create a breach of the public peace by hasty and injudicious interference with the rights of the people&#8217;. He also stressed that the police had no power to regulate music during a procession. Ranade warned Tilak that his argument was inflammatory and Gokhale cautioned him not to stir up further communal conflict.<br />
However, Tilak intensified his campaign against the prohibition of music near mosques. In September 1894 he began a mass celebration of Ganapati festival at Poona. This involved public celebration, with singing parties and large-scale processions. The songs sung in the festivals were anti-Muslim and against the Reformers. Songs were also sung to encourage Hindus to stay away from the festival of Moharram. Tilak&#8217;s close associate Hari Ramachandra Natu, also known as Tatia Saheb Natu, led one of the processions near the mosque, deliberately playing music. The procession was attacked by Muslims. The government arrested the concerned persons before extensive damage could take place. Tilak blamed &#8216;the anti-Hindu Europeans reporters in The Times of India and Bombay Gazette&#8217; for misrepresenting the facts and gave his account of the violence&#8230;He stressed that the &#8216;mild Hindu, as a rule, never resists authority&#8217;, while Muslims were &#8216;always the first violators of law, hence always the aggressors&#8217;<br />
&#8230;In his endeavour Tilak received support from not only affluent Chitpavans, but also from several anti-reformist Marathas like Bhau Rangari and Vinayak Ramachandra who were closely involved in the violence following the Ganapati festival. The Mahratta widely reported various stone throwing incidents against the Ganapati procession as well as the court proceedings against the Hindus arrested. In the midst of riots, violence, and sarcastic songs against Reformers and Muslims, The Mahratta continued to report the success of the melas as a festival of &#8216;gay dresses and sweet songs&#8217;, orderly and good tempered, and stressed repeatedly that Hindus did not desire to insult or offend the religious feelings of any other community by this festival&#8230;&#8221;<br />

<h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Shivaji Festival<br />
</strong></span></h2>
<p>The success of grand Ganpati celebration was short-lived. Ganesh Chaturthi had mostly attracted the Brahmins, Tilak wanted to garner more support to show his might to the Muslims so he decided to celebrate Shivaji festival publicly as Shivaji was not an icon of any particular caste. Tilak communalized Shivaji festival with an aim to radicalize Hindus. Biswamoy Pati explains it in detail,<br />
&#8220;The uneducated non-brahmins who had participated in the Ganapati festival refused to be part of a larger political agenda. The communal riots took place mostly during brahmin Ganapati processions led by Nationalists. In order to gain support from non-brahmins, Tilak began the Shivaji festival. The valour of Shivaji, the seventeenth-century Maratha king, was celebrated in ballads or pavadas in rural Maharashtra. This was an aspect of popular culture. The pavadas were sung by a sub-caste of professional musicians called Gondhalis in village festivals and entertainment forums. Shivaji was one of the most popular icons of the non-brahmins in the nineteenth century. He was perceived as a popular and just king.<br />
Shivaji was now projected by Tilak, not as a good king but as a protector of cows and brahmins gobrahmana praipalak. He was a defender of Hinduism from the onslaught of Islam. This was historically inaccurate. When Afzal Khan marched against Shivaji in 1659, Sambhaji of Supa, and Moray of Javli, Khondaji Khopde, the Deshmukh of Utroli, and a number of Mavali Deshmukhs joined hands with Afzal Khan. Even Baji Nimbalkar, the Deshmukh of Phaltan and the Savant of Wadi Bhaskar, Krishanji Kulkarni supported Afzal Khan. Hence, Shivaji&#8217;s struggle against the Mughals and the Bahmani kingdom can hardly be considered a struggle between two contending religions. The popular (non-brahmin) journal Din Bandhu began to oppose Tilak&#8217;s attempts to co-opt the figure of Shivaji. Countering such opposition Tilak declared that &#8216;it is the duty of every Hindu to celebrate the Shivaji festival&#8217; and elevate it to the level of a national festival.<br />
Tilak called for a public meeting in May 1895, in order to raise funds to repair the tomb of Shivaji, to erect a suitable canopy, and to arrange a permanent endowment that would provide the necessary funds for an annual festival at Raigadh. He had limited success. The Maharaja of Kolhapur who was a descendant of Shivaji provided no financial assistance and the Gaikwad of Baroda gave 1,000 rupees, a tiny sum in comparison with his contribution of 33,000 rupees to the Deccan Association around the same time. During the debate, Shivaji as a just king was completely sidelined and the killing of Afzal Khan was a focus that emphasized the Hindu-Muslim aspect. Tilak defended Shivaji&#8217;s actions by declaring that &#8216;great men were above common principles of morality&#8217;. Ranade opposed such a defence and the eulogizing of Afzal Khan&#8217;s murder. Tilak declared that Ranade was ignorant of the philosophy of the Gita and insisted that &#8216;in reclaiming independence from the Mahomedan rulers Shivaji committed no sin, either according to the Penal Code or the laws of Manu or Yagnavalkya&#8217;. The Kesari wrote that the murder of Afzal Khan at the hands of Shivaji was an occasion in which &#8216;every Hindu, every Maratha must rejoice&#8217;.<br />
The representation of Shivaji as &#8216;a Hindu king with a deep yearning for religious freedom fighting against the galling oppression of Mohamedans rulers&#8217; was opposed by educated people. Tilak argued that at the time of Shivaji the Hindus were threatened by the &#8216;merciless foreigners&#8217; and criticized educated people &#8216;for joining hands with traitors and a large crowd of hostile foreign critics of&#8230;Maratha rule&#8217;.&#8221;<br />

</strong></p>
<h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Why Tilak&#8217;s attitude towards Muslims changed in his later career?<br />
</strong></span></h2>
<p>&#8220;One reason advanced to explain this is that Tilak was forced to initiate an entente with Muslims due to the increasing pressure of non-brahmin protest in the Deccan. Rao feels that<br />
<em>Tilak&#8217;s insistence on allegiance to the ancient laws like caste rigidity, selective education to women and non-Brahmins and denying Indian Nationality to the Muslims and an intense hatred of foreigners, were the cornerstones on which the later day Hindutva ideology stood. In the first and the second decade of the twentieth century Hindutva and Hindu Nationality was not very articulately propagated, as the socio-political scenario kept on changing due to the non-Brahmin movement and opposition by liberal Brahmins which necessitated Tilak to extend the hand of friendship to the Muslims.<br />
</em><br />
This explanation seems to have a logical basis, and, even the newspapers run by Tilak seems to have recognized these pressures.<br />

</strong></p>
<h1><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Tilak&#8217;s Pro-British stand<br />
</strong></span></h1>
<p>Tilak actually didn&#8217;t oppose the Britishers, in fact after his release from Mandalay jail, he extended support to Britishers and urged Indians to fight for England in the first world war, Tilak&#8217;s opposition to Britishers had to do more with the social reforms brought by the Britishers which liberated the low caste Hindus which Tilak as a Brahmin couldn&#8217;t digest. He also opposed recruitment of Mahars and other low castes into the British Indian army.<br />
&#8220;His political engagements made him look back into the past, but he was far too modern, given his association with the anti-imperialist struggle and his methods of intervention in the public sphere that were influenced by European history and political methods. Consequently, Tilak was influenced by colonial modernity. At the same time, the man who was an &#8216;extremist&#8217; shared with the &#8216;moderates&#8217; the anxieties of the masses and the &#8216;revolutionary terrorists&#8217;. Thus, after his release in 1914, Tilak condemned terrorism and praised the benefits of British rule, besides calling upon Indian to support England during the First World War.&#8221;<br />
<strong>Bal Gangadhar Tilak: Popular Readings, p.95-96, by Biswamoy Pati, Published by Primus Books, 2011<br />
</strong></p>
<h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Why did he oppose Britishers then?<br />
</strong></span></h2>
<p>&#8220;Tilak opposed colonial rule because it gave rights to the peasants and lower castes to complain against the &#8216;natural&#8217; leaders of &#8216;Hindu&#8217; society. For him the Gita could serve as the focal point of these ideals, as it was a call to temporal action from God.&#8221;<br />
<strong>Bal Gangadhar Tilak: Popular Readings, p.68, by Biswamoy Pati, Published by Primus Books, 2011</strong><br />
&#8220;Richard Cashman has argued that the Chitpavan Brahmin community was threatened by a range of colonial reforms during the late nineteenth century that created openings and opportunities for non-brahmins castes. This led to political agitations among several brahmin groups to regain their lost status in the 1880s. Tilak worked precisely on these fears and insecurities. In fact, Cashman is also of the view that Tilak sought to work primarily on Ranade&#8217;s more moderate conception of Shivaji, with the intention of raising funds from the landed classes.&#8221;<br />
<strong>Bal Gangadhar Tilak: Popular Readings, p.72-73, by Biswamoy Pati, Published by Primus Books, 2011<br />
</strong><br />
&#8220;Tilak&#8217;s perception on the low/outcastes is quite revealing when it comes to the recruitment for the colonial army. Explaining the success of Shivaji&#8217;s army which was able to defeat the well-equipped Mughal forces, he said it was composed of patriots, not mercenaries. Simultaneously, he linked the downfall of the Peshwas to the employment of foreigners, such as Arabs in their army. He questioned the colonial policy of recruiting people of the lower castes into army. As he asserted, the vocation of the Mahars and Berads was &#8216;thieving&#8217;, and by employing them the government was alienating brahmins and Marathas, the very soul of the &#8216;nation&#8217;.&#8221;<br />

<p><strong>KARACHI The undeciphered script of the Indus Valley civilisation holds the key to a question with sharp political overtones were the people of the subcontinent&#8217;s earliest recorded civilisation Aryans or Dravidians? Or neither?</strong><br />
In 1946, an Indias archaeological survey team was at one of its favourite digs when it stumbled upon 37 skeletons. Two lay on the steps of a well with visible marks of head injury. Five were on the steps of another well room. A few others were hastily buried as if times were so bad that the dead could not be taken to the cemetery.<br />
&#8216;Men, women, children seemed to have been massacred in streets and left dying or, at best, crudely covered without any last rite,&#8217; wrote Mortimer Wheeler, who led the expedition.<br />
Archaeologists were at a site on the west bank of River Indus that is now Pakistans Sindh province. For veterans of this dig, the areas local name seemed appropriate. The Sindhis called it Moenjo Daro, meaning mound of the dead, but for the University of London-educated Wheeler, it was time to revisit history textbooks.<br />
As an undergraduate, he had learnt by rote a sentence in the Cambridge History of India The history of India is, in large measure, a struggle between newcomers and earlier inhabitants.<br />
More than 1,500 sites of the Indus Valley civilisation have been discovered since 1924 when Moenjo Daro and Harappa were first excavated. Archaeologists believe the area is roughly a quarter of Europe. Dholavira in Gujarat is the last major site discovered. It was excavated in the 1990s.<br />
Wheeler recollected what his mentor at the archaeological survey, John Marshall, often said that ancient people on the banks of Indus were Dravidians. In 1924, Marshall led an expedition to Moenjo Daro and Harappa, 500km away and announced a civilisation as ancient as Mesopotamia and as grand as Egypt. Excavation doubled the recorded age of the civilisation in the Indo-Pak subcontinent, shifting it to about 2500 BC from inscriptions of Ashoka in 250 BC.<br />
Marshall could never forcefully claim the Dravidian affiliation of the Indus Valley civilisation. For Wheeler, 37 skeletons vindicated his mentor. &#8216;It may be no conjecture&#8230; Aryans slaughtered aborigine men, women and children,&#8217; he said in a 1947 article in the <em>Bulletin of Archaeological Survey</em>.<br />
Those were the tumultuous times. The Indo-Pak subcontinent was split into two nations and buffeted by partition. Initial reactions to Wheeler&#8217;s announcement were muted. But the English archaeologist had stirred up a hornets&#8217; nest. The Aryan invasion theory was more than 70 years old then.<br />
But several Hindu nationalists were never at ease with Aryan Invasion theory. It struck at root of their belief that the earliest Indians were Aryans. Indologist P V Kane fired the first salvo.<br />
In 1950, he denounced Wheeler and Marshall as typical Englishmen who find invaders everywhere. Kane argued that Moenjo Daro was a large city and had there been an invasion, Wheeler should have found more than 37 skeletons.<br />
&#8216;If Dr Marshall and Dr Wheeler had not been so blinkered they would have seen the people of Indus for what they were,&#8217; he said.<br />
He was referring to a seal dug out by Marshall. On it was inscribed a horned person seated on a stool, its arms covered with bangles and was flanked by small figures of tigers, elephants. For Kane, this was the Vedic deity Pasupati, precursor to Shiva. It was proof that the people of Indus Valley were Aryans. But in a later article he counselled caution resolution to the Indus Valley mystery lay in its seals. -PPI</p>

Thus ended the most brilliant civilization of the ancient world. Subsequent to this invasion, India was plunged into 2000 years of the Vedic Dark Ages.

<p><strong><br />
Ash layers </strong>indicate widespread burning down of Indus cities by the Aryans.<br />
<strong>Fractured skulls </strong>and mutilated skeletons display axe and sword marks due to widespread massacre of the Indus inhabitants by Aryan invaders.<br />
<strong>Caste System of Apartheid </strong>similar to US South arose when white Caucasoid Aryans crushed the Semitic (`Pani’ or Phoenician) &amp; black Dravidian inhabitants. Shivaism is still the Dravidian religion (Tamil<em>“civa”</em>, red, angry), while Vaishnavism is the Indo-Aryan religion.<br />
<strong>Discontinuity </strong>marks the Aryan invasion in all respects. Pottery, architecture, Aryan weapons (incl. the horse &amp; chariot) &amp; Aryan settlements occur towards the end of the civilization atop the destroyed cities with primitive fire altars and the new painted grey ware (PGW)<br />
<strong>Flooding </strong>is indicated by the silt deposits and was caused by the deliberate destruction of the indus dam and irrigation system by the Aryans.<br />
<strong>Northern Dravidians </strong>(eg. the Brahui, Bhil and Gonds occupy isolated tracts of North and Central India showing that the Dravidians were once spread over all of India.<br />
<strong>Sanskrit Literature </strong>clearly records the Aryan invasion. Indra, chief of the Aryan gods, is repeatedly referred to as “destroyer of cities” and exterminator of dasyus. In Tamil literature 1500 BC is the date of the mythical destruction of Tamil civilisation; this coincides with the Aryan invasion. In addition Sanskrit contains many loanwords of Dravidian origin. Shiva is one example (Tamil<em>“civa”</em>). Some sounds are also of Dravidian<br />
<strong>Astronomical Science </strong>used by the Vedic ritualists was taken from the Semito-Dravidian Indus valley people as these were compiled during the Indus Valley and are not referred to in the Avesta or Rig Veda.<!--more--><!--more--></p>

<p>Around 1500 BC, the Indus civilization came, after 2000 years of prosperity, to a comparatively abrupt end. Conclusive evidence shows that the reason for this decline, in fact the sole reason for it, was an invasion by highly barbaric Aryans. They invaded, destroying the Indus cities and exterminating the native peoples.<br />
<strong><br />
1. Archaeological Evidence </strong><br />
<strong>1.1 Thick Ash Layers </strong><br />
Thick ash layers occur in the upper strata of many Indus cities. At Nal the last phase of the Zhob-ware was burnt down so much so that the mound is known as the Sohr Damb, or the Red Mound, from the reddening due to fire. At Dabar Kot the upper 6 feet of the tell show 4 thick ash layers that indicate repeated destruction by conflagration and the RG V encrusted ware is associated with the last settlements of Harappa [ Piggott 215 ].<br />
At the Rana Ghundai mound everywhere overlying the foundation level of the RG III c phase there are pockets of ash. Above the RG III c phase the pottery is markedly different from the preceding type, the RG IV phase pottery being painted with coarse bands. RG IV was again destroyed by fire, and the RG V phase is marked by another change in pottery. The RG V pottery is unpainted and contains patterns in relief [ Piggott p. 214 ].<br />
<strong><br />
1.2 Fractured Skulls </strong><br />
At Mohenjo-daro, Harappa and Chanhu-daro, skeletons/fragments of skeletons indicate violent massacres in the final stages of the cities’ history. Huddled skeletons of persons murdered in the streets indicate that the mass dyings were not due to poisonings etc. but were violent.<br />
– [ Piggott p. 145 ]
<strong><br />
1.3 Aryan Weaponry </strong><br />
Copper axe-adzes are intrusive ar Harappan sites ( Harappa, Shahi-tump and Chanhu-daro ) but are similar to those found at North Persian sites ( Hissar III, Shah Tepe, Turang Tepe ) and Akkadian sites ( Assur, Sialk B cemetary : here the specimens are probably as late as the 9th century BC ).<br />
– [ Piggott p.228 ]
Swords 1.5 foot long and strengthened at the mid-rib are non-Harappan and are found only in the later strata of the cities. These swords at Mohenjo-daro have a tang and rivet to hold the handle exactly as found in Palestine, where such implements are associated with the Hyksos 1800-1500 BC<br />
– [ Piggott p. 229 ]
Copper harpoons found in the indus Valley are similar to those found in Europe and elsewhere in Asia.<br />
– [ Piggott p. 237 ]
<strong><br />
1.4 Flooding by Aryan Destruction of Indus Dams </strong><br />
Signs of flooding were discovered in the Indus cities, mainly in the form of silt deposits. It was thus considered that this flooding explantaion could explain the fall of the Indus cities and was considered as the most viable alternative to the idea of an Aryan invasio. It was subsequently discovered, however, that flooding had been pointed out as a consequence several decades before the actual discovery of flooding. It is now accepted that flooding was caused by the Aryans’ destruciton of the Indus dam and irrigation system, and was merely another aspect of the genocide.<br />
+ He smote Vrtra who encompassed the waters [ RgV VI.20.2 ]
+ He smote Vrtra who enclosed the waters, like a tree with the bolt [ RgV II.14.2 ]
+ He is referred to as `conquering the waters’ ( apsujit ), which is his prime attribute.<br />
+ Indra let loose the streams after slaying Vrtra [ RgV IV.19.8 ]
+ He cleaves the mountian, making the streams flow [ RgV I.57.6; X.89.7 ], even with the sound of his bolt [ RgV VI.27.1]
– [ RgV I.57.6; II.14.2; IV.19.8; VI.20.2; VI.27.1; X.89.7 ] [ ST 368 ]
In Sanskrit, `vrtra’ is an `obstacle’, and denotes a barrage or blockage [ ISISH 70-71]. It is thus a word for `dam’. Dams now called Gebr-band are found on many water-courses of the western parts of the Indus region. Aryans shattered the dam system of the Indus, leading to silt deposits in Mohenjo-daro [ S &amp; T 369].<br />
+ When he [Indra] laid open the great mountain, he let loose the torrents and slew the Danava, he set free the pent up springs, the udder of the mountain. [ RgV V.32.1-2 ]
+ He slew the Danava, shattered the great mountian, broke open the well, set free the pent up waters. [ RgV I.57.6; V.33.1 ]
+ He releases the streams which are like impisoned cows [ RgV I.61.10 ]
+ He won the cows and soma and made the 7 rivers flow. [ RgV I.32.12; II.12.12 ]
+ He releases the imprisoned waters [ RgV I.57.6; I.103.2 ]
+ He dug out channels for the streams with his bolt [ RgV II.15.3 ], let the flood of waterrs flow into the sea. [ RgV II.19.3 ]
+ He caused the waters pent up by Vrtra to flow [ RgV III.26.6; IV.17.1 ]
– [ MacDonnell ] [S &amp; T 368-9 quotg Macdonell ]
Another verse explicitly metnions him as a destroyer of dams:<br />
rinag rodhamsi krtrimani<br />
= ” he removed artificial barriers”<br />
– [ RgV 2.15.8 ]
Now, <em>rodhas </em>= “dam” elsewhere in the Rig Veda and in later Sanskrit [ S &amp; T 369 ]. The above evidence, taken directly from the Rig Veda and not from any secondary source, is sufficient to implacate the Aryans as the destroyers of the dam systems of the ancient Indus.<br />
<strong><br />
1.5 Aryan Settlements </strong><br />
Aryan settlements occur atop the destroyed cities towards the end of the civlization. THey are primitive brick structures made of material taken from the ruins of the preceding towns.<br />
<strong><br />
1.3 Aryan Weaponry </strong><br />
Aryan weaponry, including the horse and chariot occur towards the end of the Indus cities’ history.<br />
<strong><br />
2. Anthropological </strong><br />
<strong><br />
2.1 Northern Dravidians </strong><br />
Several Dravidian tribes still inhabit isolated parts of northern India. The Brahui inhabit parts of Baluchistan and stil speak a Dravidian language. The Bhils inhabit parts of southern Rajastan. The black Gonds inhabit parts of central India about the Vindhyans.<br />
<strong><br />
2.2 The Black Sudroids ; Dravidians and African Race </strong><br />
The Aryans and Dravidians today still retain by and large, the original features. The Aryans have fair-pale skin, leptorrhine (thin) noses and straight hair. The Dravidians have broad noses, curly-wavy hair and dark-black skin. They are related to the Africans [ Winters* ]. [ Risley ].<br />
<strong><br />
2.3 White Indo-Aryan Caucasoids </strong><br />
The Indo-Aryans belong to the Caucasoid or white race and are very similar to Latins. The Indo-Aryan languages belong to the Indo-European family of languages. Racially the Indo-Aryans posess white to fair skin, thin noses and lips and straight hair.<br />
<strong><br />
3. Literary </strong><br />
<strong>3.1 Sanskrit Literature </strong><br />
References abound to an Aryan invasion in Sanskrit literature.<br />
The ancient singer praises the god who “destroyed the Dasyans and protected the Aryan colour.” [ Rg.V. III.34.9 ] [ Ann. 114 ] and “the thunderer who bestowed on his white friends the fields, bestowed the sun, bestowed the waters.” [ Rg.V. I.100.18 ] [ Ann. 114 ] Numerous are the references to “the black skin” `Krishnam Vacham’ [ Rg.V. IX.41.1, Sama Veda I.491, II.242 ] [ Ann. 114 ] which is mentioned with abhorrence. Again ” stromy gods who rush on like furious bulls and scatter the black skin.” [ Rg.V. IX.73.5 ] The singers mention “the black skin, the hated of Indra”, being swept ourtof heaven [ RgV. IX.73.5 ] “Indra protected in battle the Aryan worshipper, he subdued the lawless for Manu, he conqured the black skin.” [ Rg.V. I.130.8 ] [ Ann.114 ] The sacrificer poured out thanks to his god for “scattering the slave bands of black descent”, and for stamping out ” the vile Dasyan colour.” [ Rg.V. II.20.7, II.12.4 ] [ ANn. 115 ] “Dasam varnam adharam” [ Rg.V. II.12.4 ] [ Muir part I, p.43, II, p.284, 323 etc. ] [ Ann. 114 ff ] Rakshas are aboriginals<br />
&#8211; Ravana = Rakshasendra [ Ann. 111 ]
&#8211; Rakshas = Ceylon aborigines since Chinese tracvellers and CInghales chronilces , Rakko or Yakko in the ernalculr [ An. 111 ]
Destruction of Cities &#8211;<br />
The Aryan gods are proudly presented by the Vedic “sages” as the destroyeres of cities. Of these Indra, later considered an incarnation of the God Vishnu, is the prime culprit. Indra is called Puroha or Purandhara, `sacker of cities’ – [ S &amp; T 366 ] Indra overthrew 100 Puras made of stone ( asmanmayi ) for his worshipper Divodasa [ RgV 4.30.20 ], evidently belonging to Sambara who is a Dasa ( non-Aryan/demon ) of the mountain [ RgV 6.26.5 ] — [ Chanda ] [ S &amp; T p.364 ]
No regard was shown to the life of non-Aryans. An Aryan poet says,<br />
” Ye mighty ones [ Asvins ] what do you do there;<br />
why do you stay there among the people wh are held in high esteem through not offering sacrifices;<br />
ignore them, destroy the life of the Panis ”<br />
– [ RgV I.83.3 ] [ S &amp; T 365 ]
<strong><br />
Indra’s Destruction of Harappa : The Vedic Harappa Hymn </strong><br />
The famous Harappa hymn of the Rig Veda describes with praise Indra’s destruction of Harappa :<br />
” In aid of Abhyavartin Cayamana, Indra destroyed the seed of Virasakha.<br />
“At Hariyupiyah he smote the vanguard of the Vrcivans, and the rear fled frighted.”<br />
– [ Rg.V. XXVII.5 ]
This Hariyupiyah is likely to be the Harappa of tte Indus valley.<br />
<strong><br />
3.2 Dravidian Literature </strong><br />
The date of 1500 BC corresponds to the end of a sangam period when invasions by barbarians occurred.<br />
<strong><br />
4. Sociological </strong><br />
<strong>4.1 Caste System </strong><br />
The caste system is another `fossil’ of the Aryan conquest, with the lower and exterior castes representing the aboriginal inhabitants that managed to survivie the Aryan slaughter. Exactly the same occurred in other parts of the world where one race has subjugated others, eg. Latin America ( Iberians conquered Aboriginals ), USA ( Anglo-Saxons ruling over Hispanics and Afro-Americans ) etc. These include the Adivasis ( aboriginal tribals ), the Dalits ( semi-settled aborigianls ) and the Sudras ( the lowest caste ). However, some of the Sudras were imported under Muslim rule from Southern India.<br />
The caste system consists of several different <em>“varnas” </em>( Sans. “colors”), three of which are Aryan. The lowest caste, the Shudra, consists of aboriginals, as well as the exterior untouchable castes.<br />
<strong><br />
4.2 Sati and Child Marriage </strong><br />
The Aryans introduced tremendous restrictions on the life of women, including sati and child mariage. According to Aryan “Hindu” (ie. Vaishnavite) scriptures, a man must marry a maiden one-third his age.<br />
<strong><br />
4.3 Cow-Worship </strong><br />
Cow-worship is another feature introduced by the Aryans. This probably arose because the Aryans were nomads and hence required the cow.<br />
<strong><br />
5. Theological </strong><br />
<strong>5.1 Shiva and Shakti </strong><br />
Siva is the god of the Dravidians. Vishnu is the god of the Aryans<br />
The star-calendar used by the Aryan-Vaishnavites today was adopted from the Semito-Dravidian Indus Valley civilization, since:<br />
It is not referred to in the Rig Veda or Avesta<br />
It was compiled when the Indus Valley was at its peak, before the Aryans came to India. [ Parpola ]
The Indus people practiced astronomy because the streets are oriented towards the cardinal directions, presupposing the use of the sun-stick. A seal from Mohenjo-daro depicts an Indus deity with a star on either side of his haed in the fashion of the Near East. Inanna-Ishtar, the goddess of love and war, for example, was associated with the planet Venus [ Parpola ]. This may have led to the cult of worshipping the planets, the astral religion of India.<br />
<strong><br />
5.2 Fire Altars </strong><br />
Fire altars occur late towards the Indus cities history. They are primitve in nature, constructed from material from the destroyed Indus cities.<br />
<strong><br />
6. Global Aryan Invasions </strong><br />
Aryans invaded several parts of the world, putting an end to various brilliant civilizations. Babylonia was destroyed by Kassites, Hittites and Mittani, Egypt was devastated by the Hyksos, and Minoan culture by the Dorians.<br />
<strong><br />
7. Rival Theories </strong><br />
Several other explanations have been put forth to explain the demise of the Indus civilisation besides the Aryan invasion. These are:<br />
Environmental catastrophes – These include:<br />
Cometary impact<br />
Flooding<br />
Internal Decline – These explanations claim that slavery, or some other revolt destroyed the Indus civilisation.<br />
These have severe problems, however.<br />
<strong>Cometary Impact </strong>. The problems with this theory are:<br />
<em>No crater/craters </em>have been found with an age matching 1500 BC, nor of the requisite size. The size is narrowly constrained, for if the impact was too large, catastrophe would have been global, while if it were too small, the effect would have been negligible.<br />
<em>No iridium anomaly </em>, the characteristic of all impacts from the mammoth K/T Chiczulub crater [ ALvarez ] to the Sudbury intrusive, has been found in the Indus valley of the required age.<br />
<em>No shocked glasses </em>, or tektites with the requisite shock deformation features, have been found anywhere near the Indus valley.<br />
Thus, although a cometary candidate for the extinction has been found in Comet Enke [ ], this is a far-fetched theory, to say the least. The destruciton of several civilizations simultaneously requires a global catastrophe. But some civilizations, eg. in Central and South AMerica, and China, survived the 1500 BC discontinuity. Asteroidal impacts tend to leave larger craters and more iridium, so the arguments against this variant of impact apply more forcefully.<br />
<strong>Flooding </strong>. Undisputed evidence of flooding has been found in the form of silt deposits and barrage system erected as a defensive measure. Flooding thyus remained a serious candidate until it was pointed out that several Vedic scholars had realized that the Aryans had destroyed the irrigation and dam system of the Indus. Thus flooding is a natural consequence of Aryan invasion and not an independant mechanism.<br />
<strong>Internal Decline </strong><br />
1. To suppose that, after two millenia of stability some internal revolt was the cause behind the downfall is stretching the imagination.<br />
2. No evidence has been found for this, and when indisputable evidence of violence perpetrated with new weapons exists, it is disregarding evidence.<br />
<strong>Other Opponents </strong><br />
Although the following may seem rather harsh, yet it is necessary to expose the real designs of some of the opponents of one of the most well-established theories of all time.<br />
The opponents of the concept of Aryan invasion fall into 3 categories:<br />
Aryan Hindu Fanatics<br />
Neo-Nazis<br />
These mostly have ulterior motives. The former oppose any vilification of their “gods” who are implicated in the worst massacres and atrocities recorded in history. They wish to see the Vedas, in acutality the songs of promitive cow-herds, as the repository of all science. The latter do not want to accept that their ancestors perpetrated such crimes. One religious fanatic who opposed the notion of Aryan invasion during its infancy was Narendra Nath Datta, later known as Vivekananda. All he could do was to vilify honest schloars:<br />
” And what your European pandits say about the Aryan’s sweeping fron some foreign land, snatching away the alnds of the aboriginals and settling India by exterminating them, is all pure nonsense, foolish talk. Strange, that our Indian scholars too say amen to them, and all these monstrous lies are taught to our boys. This is very bad indeed.<br />
In what Veda, in what Sukta, so you find that the Aryans came to India from a foreign country? Where do you get the idea that they slaughtered the wild aborigines? What do you gain by talking such nonsense?”<br />
– [ ` Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda &#8216;, 1963, p.534-535 ] [ Panda 70 ]
Another fundamentalist who opposed the notion of Aryan invasions is Srviastava, who apparently only conducted his research to prove the innocence of the Aryan gods :<br />
“Indra, therefore stands completely exonerated”<br />
– [ Srivastava 441 ]
Later, lacking any scientific evidence whatsoever, he degenerates into vilifying Wheeler himself :<br />
” .. we see him as a brgiadier in the British army during WW II, we feel he could not interpret the dubious evidence of Mohenjo-daro and Harappa in any other manner ”<br />
– [ Srivas 442 ]
A.K.Pateria writes,<br />
” Both Dayananda and Aurobindo refuted in clear terms the historical doctrines of Aryan invasion and struggle of Aryans with Dravidian, which was originated by the Westerners and has even been popularised among a large section of the Indian Historians.”<br />
– [ A.K.Pateria, `Modern Commentators of the Veda&#8217;, p.63 ] [ Panda 70 ]
Who this Dayananda was must be fully exposed.<br />
The Aryans were so barbaric that they did not even have a word for brick in Sanskrit [ S &amp; T 372 ]

<p>The battle between Indian Hindu kings and Muslim rulers is depicted as a religious war by Hindus. And even small-time Hindu rulers whose names should&#8217;ve been unknown in history books are made popular just because they fought Muslims. This includes rulers like Rana Pratap, Prithviraj Chauhan, Shivaji etc. who all lost to Muslim rulers. Rana Pratap and Prithviraj Chauhan were not Marathas hence I shall not discuss them.</p>
<p><span id="more-2685"></span></p>
<p>In Hindu society, anyone can be made a hero overnight, the same is the case with Shivaji. Today, grand celebrations of Shivaji’s birth anniversary are made. Shivaji Jayanti was not at all celebrated in the past just a little over 100 years ago, Shivaji Jayanti celebration was started by a radical Brahmin leader Bal Gangadhar Tilak who upon failing to mobilize non-Brahmins with Ganesh Chaturthi started Shivaji Jayanti. He started the public celebration of Ganesh Chaturthi only to deter Hindus from attending Muharram, on failing to attract non-Brahmins, he started Shivaji Jayanti celebration. Shivaji was so unpopular that his Samadhi was in despair, according to some the Samadhi of Shivaji was discovered by Jyotiba Phule. Historian Biswamoy Pati wrote in his book, Bal Gangadhar Tilak: Popular readings whose excerpts are available in my article that Tilak collected funds to repair the tomb of Shivaji, “The popular (non-brahmin) journal Din Bandhu began to oppose Tilak’s attempts to co-opt the figure of Shivaji. Countering such opposition Tilak declared that ‘it is the duty of every Hindu to celebrate the Shivaji festival’ and elevate it to the level of a national festival. Tilak called for a public meeting in May 1895, in order to raise funds to repair the tomb of Shivaji, to erect a suitable canopy, and to arrange a permanent endowment that would provide the necessary funds for an annual festival at Raigadh. He had limited success. The Maharaja of Kolhapur who was a descendant of Shivaji provided no financial assistance and the Gaikwad of Baroda gave 1,000 rupees, a tiny sum in comparison with his contribution of 33,000 rupees to the Deccan Association around the same time. During the debate, Shivaji as a just king was completely sidelined and the killing of Afzal Khan was a focus that emphasized the Hindu-Muslim aspect.”</p>
<p>History is a very lengthy subject, it&#8217;s not possible to mention each and every action of the Marathas hence I shall quote a few passages. Shivaji was the founder of the Maratha Empire. His rebellion against Aurangzeb is communalized and it is also claimed that he revolted due to the &#8220;oppression&#8221; by the Mughals. That’s quite ironic since Shivaji the bandit used to pillage villages and carried out arson attacks on the houses of common civilians. So it is not true that he revolted against the so-called oppression as he had higher political ambitions to become a king.</p>
<p>Shivaji had sent several apology letters to Aurangzeb, I shall mention some of them here.</p>
<p>Shivaji wrote a letter to Nasiri Khan offering submission after being defeated in Ahmednagar by the latter when Shivaji tried to plunder the city, on not getting any response Shivaji later sent a diplomat to Aurangzeb who outwardly pardoned Shivaji as he was busy in the war of succession for the next two years.</p>
<p>&#8220;When in September his liege-lord, the king of Bijapur, made peace, Shivaji found it useless and even ruinous to himself to continue the war with the Mughal empire single-handed. He must try to save his patrimony. So, he wrote to Nasiri Khan offering Submission, and the Khan replied in a conciliatory tone. Then Shiva, as requested, sent a trusty agent (probably Raghunath Ballal Korde) to the Khan to state his demands. These were reported to Aurangzeb (Adab. 165b, 157a); but no definite agreement followed. Shivaji now sent Raghunath Pant to Aurangzeb directly. The Prince was just started on his march to Northen India (25 Jan., 1658) and wrote to Shiva in reply, &#8220;Though your offences do not deserve pardon, I forgive you as you have repented&#8230;&#8221; <strong>Shivaji and His Times, p.61, by Sir Jadunath Sarkar, second edition, published by Longmans, Green and Co</strong></p>
<p>Shivaji to Aurangzeb, June 1665</p>
<p>&#8220;Although this offender and sinner was deserving of all kinds of punishment, yet, through the mercy and grace of the gracious and favour-showering (imperial Court), which is the shadow of the mercy of the Creator and the reflection of the pity of the Nourisher, he has, by means of submission and humility, turned the face of deliverance towards the hope of life and the safety of his life and property, in the shelter of the promise and agreement of the officers of the lofty Court which resembles Heaven in splendour; he has reached the abode of safety of his desire, obtained a new life, and made his forehead of servitude auspicious with the brand of a slave (of the Emperor). He begs to represent that hereafter he will remain firmly engaged in performing the Emperor&#8217;s work, as a reparation for his past life and an amendment of his uselessly spent days; he will never deviate from the position of rendering service, risking his life and carrying out the imperial mandates, which is a means of glorification to the rulers of the seven climes of the globe, not to speak of this most abject particle and hunblest of drops (i.e., Shiva himself), the (worth of) whose life is well known. Hereafter he will not consent to ruining his own house and destroying the foundation of his own life (by rising in rebellion). A detailed account of this slave will reach the imperial presence from the despatch of the chief of the Rajahs of the age, Mirza Rajah Jai Singh. He hopes that ouf of the store-house of (your majesty&#8217;s) grace, pardon of offences and cherishing of offenders, life to this slave may be granted, and an imperial farman may be issued pardoning his offences, granting security to his house and family, and bestowing life on him.&#8221; <strong>House of Shivaji, p.148-9, by Sir Jadunath Sarkar, Second edition, Published by S.C. Sarkar &amp; Sons</strong></p>
<p>Shivaji had begged Jaswant Singh to be his intermediary in making peace with the Mughal empire in 1668. The fear of Mughal army is apparent in the words of Shivaji.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;As early as April 1667 he had sent a letter to the Emperor professing terror of the imperial army which was reported to have been despatched against him, and offering to make his submission again and send a contingent of 400 men under his son to fight under the Mughal banners. (Akhbarat, 10-9.) Aurangzib had taken no notice of this letter. Some months later Shivaji made another attempt. He entreated Jaswant Singh to be his intermediary in making peace with the empire. He wrote to the Maharaja, &#8220;The Emperor has cast me off. Otherwise I intended to have begged the task of recovering Qandahar with my unaided resources. I fled (from Agra) in fear of my life. Mirza Rajah, my patron, is dead. If through your intercession I am pardoned, I shall send Shambhu to wait on the Prince and serve as a mansabdar at the head of my followers wherever ordered.&#8221; (Dil. 69-70) Jaswant Singh and Prince Muazzam jumped at the offer and recommended Shiva to the Emperor (9th March 1668), who accepted the proposal, and thus a peace was made which lasted two years&#8230;&#8221; <strong>Shivaji and His Times, p.183*4, by Sir Jadunath Sarkar, second edition, published by Longmans, Green and Co</strong></p>
<p>Following is another letter sent by Shivaji,</p>
<p>&#8220;3rd October, 1667, Persian Akhbar<br />
The Emperor received a letter from Prince Muhammad Muazzam (the new viceroy of the Deccan) to this effect:- Shivaji has written a letter to me saying &#8220;I am a hereditary slave of the imperial Court and my son Shambhuji has been created a Commander of Five thousand (with 5,000 troopers tank), but has received no jagir as tankha (or subsistence allowance.) I now beg that His Majesty would pardon the offences of this servant, restore the mansab of my son and assign a jagir to him. I am ready to render service in person wherever I am ordered.&#8221; As Shivaji is at present manifesting great misery of heart, I beg Your Majesty to forgive his past misdeeds and to restore the mansab formerly [i.e., in 1665] granted to Shambhuji. His Majesty after reading the despatch, handed it back to the prime minister and remarked, &#8220;I order the restoration of the mansab of Shambhuji. Do you assign him jagirs in the territory of the forts surrenderd to me [by Shiva] He should come [with a contingent of troops] and render service under the Prince [Muazzam].&#8221; <strong>House of Shivaji, p.179-180, Second edition, Published by S.C. Sarkar &amp; Sons</strong></p>
<p>This shows that Shivaji was an egoistic, shameless, power and money-hungry guy. Did Mughal&#8217;s &#8216;oppression&#8217; against Hindus suddenly come to an end while asking for jagirs from Aurangzeb? This letter is dated 1667 which is 3 years after Shiva looted the city of Surat. If the purpose of revolt was to end Mughal’s &#8216;oppression&#8217; then he shouldn&#8217;t have begged for jagirs (grants). Aurangzeb made a huge mistake by showing benevolence to the bandit Shivaji by repeatedly forgiving him though he was capable of punishing him as his commanders had many times defeated Shivaji. In the battle of Raigarh, Aurangzeb ordered his general Zulfiqar Khan to capture Maratha king Rajaram a son of Shivaji, Shivaji&#8217;s son Rajaram fled leaving women of his household, they were captured by Mughals and treated graciously. Aurangzeb ordered a tent to be set-up for them in Gulbarga and they were accorded all respect, privacy and an annual pensions were fixed on all of them.</p>
<p>Shivaji is portrayed as an undefeated brave warrior but he mainly resorted to guerrilla tactics, there are numerous instances where so-called “Veer (Brave)” Shivaji fled the battlefield. The following para is taken from Maharashtra government’s website,</p>
<p>&#8211; &#8220;In Feb 1670, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj&#8217;s tried to conquer Mahuli, but failed. Thousand of Marathas were killed by Moghals. It was a bad blow to Marathas.&#8221;<br />

<p>&#8211; Battle of Pavan Khind: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panhala_Fort#Under_Shivaji_Maharaj" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">In 1659<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, after the death of the Bijapur general Afzal Khan, in the ensuing confusion Shivaji took Panhala from Bijapur. In May 1660, to win back the fort from Shivaji, Adil Shah II (1656–1672) of Bijapur sent his army under the command of Siddi Johar to lay siege to Panhala. Shivaji Maharaj fought back and they could not take the fort. The siege continued for months, at the end of which all provisions in the fort were exhausted and Shivaji Maharaj was on the verge of being captured.<br />
Under these circumstances, Shivaji decided that escape was the only option. He gathered a small number of soldiers along with his trusted commander Baji Prabhu Deshpande and, on 13 July 1660, they escaped in the dead of night to flee to Vishalgad. Baji Prabhu and a barber, Shiva Kashid, who looked like Shivaji Maharaj, kept the enemy engaged, giving them an impression that Shiva Kashid was actually Shivaji Maharaj. In the ensuing battle (Battle of Pavan Khind), almost three quarters of the one thousand strong force died, including Baji Prabhu himself. The fort went to Adil Shah.</p>
<p>– Battle of Purandar: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Purandar_(1665)" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">The Treaty of Purandar<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> was signed on June 11, 1665, between the Rajput ruler Jai Singh I, who was commander of the Mughal Empire, and Maratha Shivaji. Shivaji was forced to sign the agreement after Mughal commander Diler Khan besieged Purandar fort. When Shivaji realised that war with the Mughal Empire would only cause damage to the empire and that his men would suffer heavy losses, he chose to make a treaty instead of leaving his men under the Mughals.</p>
<p>– Battle of Bhupalgarh: The Battle of Bhupalgarh occurred between the Mughal Empire and Maratha Empire in 1679. After a fierce bloody resistance to the siege lasting over 55 days, the battle resulted in the razing of the fort of Bhupalgarh and a decisive victory for the Mughals over the Maratha Shivaji, under general Diler Khan. The Maratha king Shivaji was defeated by the Mughals in this battle. Also the fort of Bhupalgarh was razed by the Mughals.</p>
<p>– Battle of Sangamner: It was fought between the Mughal Empire and Maratha Empire in 1679. This was the last battle in which the Maratha King Shivaji fought. The Mughals had ambushed Shivaji with a large force when he was returning from the sack of Jalna. The Marathas engaged in battle with the Mughals for three days but lost to the Mughals. Shivaji successfully escaped with 500 soldiers while the combat continued until Maratha general, Sidhoji Nimbalkar was killed along with 2000 soldiers whereas Santaji Ghorpade finally took to flight after being routed, with Hambir Rao injured and many Maratha soldiers arrested. Shivaji returned to Raigad safely early in December that year.</p>
<p><strong>Shivaji&#8217;s loot of Surat</strong></p>
<p>Shivaji plundered the city of Surat and its residents and later burnt down the houses. Sir Jadunath Sarkar writes,</p>
<p>&#8220;At 11 o&#8217;clock in the morning of Wednesday, 6th January, 1664, Shivaji arrived at Surat and pitched his tent in a garden a quarter of a mile outside the Burhanpur or eastern gate. The night before he had sent two messengers with a letter requiring the governor and the three most eminent merchants and richest men in the city, viz., Haji Said Beg, Baharji Borah, and Haji Qasim, to come to him in person immediately and make terms, otherwise he threatened the whole town with fire and sword. No answer had been given to the demand, and the Maratha horsemen, immediately after their arrival on the 6th, entered the defenceless and almost deserted city, and after sacking the houses began to set fire to them. A body of Shivaji&#8217;s musketeers was set &#8216;to play upon the castle, with no expectation to take it, but to keep in and frighten the governor and the rest that had got in, as also [to prevent] the soldiers of the castle form sallying out upon them whilst the others plundered and fired [the houses.]&#8217; The garrison kept up a constant fire, but the fort-guns inflicted more damage on the town than on the assailants. Throughout Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday, this work of devastation was continued, every day new fires being raided, so that thousands of houses were consumed to ashes and two-thirds of the town destroyed. As the English chaplain wrote, &#8220;Thursday and Friday nights were the most terrible nights for fire. The fire turned the night into day, as before the smoke in the day-time had turned day into night, rising so thick that it darkened the sun like a great cloud.&#8221; Near the Dutch factory stood the grand mansion of Baharji Borah, then &#8216;reputed the richest merchant in the world,&#8217; his property having been estimated at 80 lakhs of Rupees. The Marathas plundered it at leisure day and night till Friday evening, when having ransacked it and dug up its floor, they set fire to it. From this house they took away 28 seers of large perals, with many other jewels, rubies, emeralds and &#8216;an incredible amount of money.&#8221; <strong>Shivaji and His Times, p.74, By Jadunath Sarkar, Orient Blackswan, 01-Jan-1992</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;The looting of Surat went on till the sun ascended atop the sky. The houses looted were burnt down by pouring on them oil procured from the oilmen. The smoke-clouds floating over Surat screened the sky. The Maratha soldiers made a beeline for the camp along with the hostages as also the booty.&#8221; <strong>Shivaji the Great, p.387, Ranjit Desai&#8217;s Marathi Novel Shriman Yogi, translated into English by Dr. V.D. Katamble, Balwant Printers Pvt. Ltd., 2003</strong></p>
<p>Shivaji ransacked the city of Surat twice, looted entire city burned the houses just like a bandit. Shivaji first looted Surat in 1664 and the second time in 1670.</p>
<p>&#8220;Six years later in October 1670 Shivaji once again sacked Surat. He arrived at Surat on October 3 and the city was open for him as the defenders fled to the Fort after a slight resistance. The Marathas pillaged homes and the sarais, burnt down nearly half of the town and retreated on the 5th carrying with them enormous booty.&#8221; <strong>Surat In The Seventeenth Century, p.25, By Gokhale, Popular Prakashan</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;On 5th October, about noon Shivaji suddenly retreated from the town, though no Mughal army was near or even reported to be coming. &#8216;But he had got plunder enough and thought it prudent to secure himself. When he marched away he sent a letter to the officers and chief merchants, saying that if they did not pay him twelve lakhs of Rupees as yearly tribute, he would return the next year and burn down the remaining part of the town. No sooner Shivaji was gone than the poor people of Surat fell to plundering what was left&#8230;Here the shah-i-bandar (harbour and custom-master), the qazi, and the most eminent merchants (Hindu, Muslim and Armenian) of Surat had taken refuge with the English. Many rich people of the town, too, had fled to the villages north of Surat, across the river and close to Swally. On the 3rd it was reported that Shivaji wanted to send 500 horsemen north of the river to plunder the villages and seize these rich men; and it was feared that he might even come to Swally to deman the surrender of the Surat refugees and blackmail from the European merchants.&#8221; <strong>Shivaji and His Times, Ch VII, p.200-1, by Jadunath Sarkar, Second Edition, Longmans, Geen and Co, 1920</strong></p>
<h3><strong>Plundering Hubli and Vingurla</strong></h3>
<p>&#8220;Early in December 1664 Shivaji looted Hubli and many other rich towns of that region, holding several eminent merchants prisoners for ransom. He had sent only three hundred horsemen to Hubli, but these did their work so thoroughly that the town &#8216;was little better than spoiled.&#8217; The merchants who had fled at the attack were too frightened to return there soon, even after the departure of the Marathas. The raiders were said to have been assisted by some of Rustam&#8217;s soldiers&#8230;Soon afterwards, Shivaji plundered Vingurla, an important sea-port and trade centre, form which he carried away vast riches. &#8216;Shiva and his scouts range all over the country, making havoc wherever he comes, with fire and sword.&#8221; <strong>Shivaji and His Times, Ch X, p.274, by Jadunath Sarkar,</strong> <strong>Second Edition, Longmans, Geen and Co, 1920</strong></p>
<p>Hubli was plundered by Shivaji&#8217;s general in 1673,</p>
<p>&#8220;In 1674 Hubli is mentioned as a place of much wealth and of great trade. It was plundered by Annaji Datto one of Shivaji&#8217;s generals and the booty is said to have exceeded any previous Maratha plunder. Merchants of all nations were plundered and the Bijapur troops, which had been stationed for the defence of the town, destroyed any property which the Maratha left.&#8221; <strong>Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency &#8230;, Volume 22, Chapter XIV, p.758, Printed at the Government Central Press, 1884 &#8211; Bombay (India : State)</strong></p>
<h3><strong>Plundering Golconda, Bijapur and Yadagiri and taking many people for ransom</strong></h3>
<p>&#8220;During this period Shivaji plundered Bijapur and Golconda territories; at the same time his men pillaged two towns in Portuguese territory; Shivaji also captured Kolhapur. In November, Bahadur Khan marched to Kalyan and pressed hard the Marathas. About this time, Hambirrao, the Commander-in-Chief, plundered Gujrat.&#8221; <strong>Shivaji, the Great Maratha, Volume 3, p.789, By H. S. Sardesai, Genesis Publishing Pvt Ltd, 2002</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Meantime, while the Mughal viceroy was being lulled into inactivity by these peace overtures, and Shiva was hastening to the siege of Ponda, he captured Kolhapur (March) but failed at Raibagh. A little later another division of his army ranged far eastwards, plundering Bijapur and Golkonda territories, especially Yadagiri and two towns near Haidarabad, &#8216;bringing away a great deal of riches besides many rich persons&#8217; held to ransom. At the same time his men robbed Cuculle and Veruda in the Portuguese territory (middle of April.)&#8221; <strong>Shivaji and His Times, Ch IX, p.257, by Jadunath Sarkar,</strong> <strong>Second Edition, Longmans, Geen and Co, 1920</strong></p>
<h3><strong>Plundering Rajapur and its merchant, sacking its factory and taking captives for ransom</strong></h3>
<p>&#8220;Shivaji punished this act of hostility about 3rd March 1661, when he surprised Rajapur, plundered the English factory, and carried off four of the factors, Henry Revington, Richard Taylor, Randolph Taylor, and Philip Gyffard, as prisoners. A graphic account of this second sack of Rajapur is given by the Dutch Chief at Vingurla: &#8216;Shivaji sent 1,000 horse and about 3,000 foot soldiers to take possession of Rajapur. This force, on reaching the town, invited the principal inhabits to come out and escort it in, according to custom, promising to do no harm. These simple men, suspecting no evil, went to the place of meeting, accompanied by the English President Revington, with two or three other Englishment, who thought it well to play this mark of respect. They were are all immediately seized and their property confiscated, after tortures had been inflicted. Revington and those who accompanied him were placed in one of Shivaji&#8217;s fortresses&#8230;The factory was entirely stripped, even the floor being dug up in search of hidden treasure. The robbers also plundered many foreign merchants, who yearly brings goods to Rajapur from Persia and Musqat&#8217;&#8230;Then Shivaji laid a ransom on the captives, and sent them to Waisati fort. Many other persons Hindu merchants (banians), Indian Muslims, Persians and Arabas were kept there in his prison in a miserable plight and beaten to extort ransom.&#8221; <strong>Shivaji and His Times, p.263, By Jadunath Sarkar, Orient Blackswan, 01-Jan-1992</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;In 1660 and 1670, Shivaji plundered the town of Rajapur, sacking the English factory. In the terms of a treaty with Shivaji, the factory was again established but it was never profitable. Though several other factories were abandoned by the English, they had retained the one, at Rajapur. Though Shivaji had punished the factors for furnishing the Bijapur king with war stores, and the factors were imprisoned, until a ransom was paid, Shivaji and Sambhaji after him always professed to be very anxious to have a factory at Rajapur.&#8221; <a href="http://ratnagiri.nic.in/gazetter/gom/his_english.html" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">http://ratnagiri.nic.in/gazetter/gom/his_english.html<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>&#8220;In 1660 and 1670 Shivaji plundered the town sacking the English factory.&#8221; <strong>Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency &#8230;, Volume 10, Chapter XIV, p.360, Printed at the Government Central Press, 1880 &#8211; Bombay (India : State)</strong></p>
<h3><strong>Plunder of Baglana, Burhanpur (Khandesh) and Karanja (Berar) and carrying off its inhabitants for ransom</strong></h3>
<p>&#8220;Meantime, Shivaji had left Surat, entered Baglana, and plundered the villages nestling at the foot of the fort of Mulhir.&#8221; <strong>Shivaji and His Times, Ch VII, p.205, by Jadunath Sarkar,</strong><br />
<strong>Second Edition, Longmans, Geen and Co, 1920</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;In October, Shivaji himself led an expedition through the Deccan plateau and plundered several towns near Aurangabad. Thereafter, he burst into Baglana and Khandesh and plundered them in November and December.&#8221; <strong>Shivaji, the Great Maratha, Volume 3, p.787, By H. S. Sardesai, Genesis Publishing Pvt Ltd, 2002</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;From Fardapur, Daud Khan swerved to the west and entered Baglana on the heels of the Marathas. While Pratap Rao had been sacking Karinja in Berar, another Maratha band under Moro Trimbak Pingle had been looting West Khandesh and Baglana, and now these two divisions had united in the neighbourhood of Salhir. They had plundered the village under the hill-fort of Mulhir and laid siege to Salhir. Daud Khan arrived near Mulhir at about 8 P.M., but could advance no further as most of his camp and army were lagging behind.&#8221; <strong>Shivaji and His Times, Ch VII, p.210, by Jadunath Sarkar,</strong><br />

<p>&#8220;In 1672 Mulher and Salher were plundered by Shivaji.&#8221; <a href="https://cultural.maharashtra.gov.in/english/gazetteer/Nasik/022%20Places/001%20Place.htm" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">https://cultural.maharashtra.gov.in/english/gazetteer/Nasik/022%20Places/001%20Place.htm<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>&#8220;Early in December a Maratha force under Pratap Rao made a raid into Khandesh. Advancing by rapid marches, he plundered Bahadurupura, a village two miles from Burhanpur (the capital of Khandesh), but did not com did not come closer to that city, because of the warning of Jaswant Singh, who had been posted there since September last.&#8221; <strong>Shivaji and His Times, Ch VII, p.208, by Jadunath Sarkar,</strong> <strong>Second Edition, Longmans, Geen and Co, 1920</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Early in December he himself traversed Khandes capturing some forts of the Baglan district on the way. His general Prataprav Gujar plundered Bahadarpura, a suburb of Burhanpur and quickly passing into Berar plundered the rich city of Karanja. [In 1660 Khandesh was regarded as one of the few rich parts of the Moghal empire. Its revenue amounted to more than Rs. 2,70,00,000. The ways were safely guarded and it was full of villages and well peopled towns. Probably no part of India was richer in cotton, rice and indigo and in many places  were sugarcane plantations with mills and furnaces to make sugar.&#8221; <a href="https://cultural.maharashtra.gov.in/english/gazetteer/dhulia/his_mediaeval%20period.html" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">https://cultural.maharashtra.gov.in/english/gazetteer/dhulia/his_mediaeval%20period.html<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>&#8220;Shivaji looted Karanja as it was known for its wealth. How rich and prosperous the town was is evident from the following story.&#8221; <a href="http://akola.nic.in/gazetteers/maharashtra/places_Karanja.html" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">http://akola.nic.in/gazetteers/maharashtra/places_Karanja.html<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>&#8220;But that city was not Shivaji&#8217;s objective now. He made a lightning raid into a different corner of the Mughal Empire. He sent his light cavalry to plunder Berar and Telingana. The viceroy Bahadur Khan, on hearing of it, set out from Ahmadnagar due eastwards, left his heavy baggage at Bir (70 miles to the easst) and Qandahar, and arrived as fast as he could near the fort of Ramgir (1835 N. 7935 E.) in pursuit of the raiders. But they had been two days beforehand with him, looted the village at the foot of the fort, and carried off the families of most of the inhabitants for ransom. So the baffled Mughal general returned by way of Indur (Modern Nizamabad), 95 miles due west. Entering the Qutb-Shahi territory, he ravaged the land at the instigation of Dilir Khan. The Marathas in their retreat divided into two bodies; one escaping south into the Golkonda State and the other turning northwards to Chanda, and thence westwards into Berar proper. Dilir Khan was sent off to pursue the first division, while Bahadur Khan tried to cut off the retreat of the second.&#8221; <strong>Shivaji and His Times, Ch VIII, p.223, by Jadunath Sarkar,</strong> <strong>Second Edition, Longmans, Geen and Co, 1920</strong></p>
<h3><strong>Plundering Dharangaon</strong></h3>
<p>&#8220;During the seventeenth century, under the forms Dongaong, Dorongon, and Drongom, it is several times mentioned as a trade centre of considerable importance. Here, in 1674, the English established a factory. The following year (March 1675)&#8217;the town was plundered by Sivaji. [ Bruce, Annals, II. 36, 37.] Four years later (1679), Sivaji, joining his forces with those of the Raja of Berar, again plundered Dharangaon&#8221; <a href="https://cultural.maharashtra.gov.in/english/gazetteer/JALGAON/places_Dharangaon.html" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">https://cultural.maharashtra.gov.in/english/gazetteer/JALGAON/places_Dharangaon.html<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>&#8220;Shivaji had been greatly relieved by the return of his prodigal son Shambhuji to Panhala (2nd December.) At the head of 20,000 horse he set out and overtook his army. The Maratha flood swept into West Khandesh, plundering Dharamgaon, Chopra, (4th-6th Dec,). and other rich trade centres, and then turning sharply to the south entered Balaghat, and reached Jalna&#8230;&#8221; <strong>Shivaji and His Times, Ch XIII, p.377, by Jadunath Sarkar,</strong> <strong>Second Edition, Longmans, Geen and Co, 1920</strong></p>
<h3><strong>Plundering Bahadurgad</strong></h3>
<p>Pedgaon is known as Bahadurgad. Shiva plunder the city as well as Bahadur Khan&#8217;s camps,</p>
<p>&#8220;Bahadurkhan reached the fort. He saw the horsemen of the advance party enter the gate; but minutes after, they came back. He saw the residents of Bahadurgad come running towards him, beating their chests. There was an immoderate crying! &#8216;We have been looted! O master, Shivaji has looted us!&#8217; &#8216;O Allah! Where is that son of Satan- Shivaji? Where did he go? What did he do?&#8217; Bahadur alighted his horse and walked frantically. The whole atmosphere was full of fury, cries and shrieks. The tents were burnt to ashes. Now he understood the true import of the fleeing of the Marathas. He was watching under heavy showers the way the Marathas looted them. And the very moment, Raje was riding fast towards Raigad, Hambirrao being the vanguard. They were riding at a full gallop towards Raigad with two hundred handsome horses captured during the attack and a cash worth a crore rupees.&#8221; <strong>Shivaji the Great, p.747, Ranjit Desai&#8217;s Marathi Novel Shriman Yogi, translated into English by Dr. V.D. Katamble, Balwant Printers Pvt. Ltd., 2003</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Towards the middle of July, a body of 2,000 Maratha light cavalry, made a false demonstration and lured Bahadur Khan some 50 miles away from his cantonments at Pedgaon, when Shivaji himself with another division, 7,000 strong, swooped down by another route on his defenceless camp, carried away a krore of Rupees in booty and 200 fine horses collected for presentation to the Emperor, and burnt all his tents. (F.R. Surat 88, Oxinden to Surat, 21 May; Vol, 87, Surat to Bombay, 1 Aug., 1674.)&#8221; <strong>Shivaji and His Times, Ch IX, p.253, by Jadunath Sarkar, Second Edition, Longmans, Geen and Co, 1920</strong></p>
<h3><strong>Plunder of Bankapur, Kanara and Sampgaon</strong></h3>
<p>Shivaji looted Bankapur and also attempted to loot Karwar but was resisted,</p>
<p>&#8220;In June Bahlol Khan with a large Bijapuri army held Kolhapur and defeated the Marathas in several encounters, forcing all their roving bands to leave the Karwar country. He also talked of invading South Konkan and recovering Rajapur and other towns next autumn. In August he is still spoken of as &#8216;pressing hard upon Shivaji, who supplicates for peace, being fearful of his own condition.&#8217; But soon afterwards Bahlol Khan, his irreconcilable enemy, fell ill at Miraj&#8230;At the end of September we find Shivaji at the head of a great army raised for &#8216;some notable attempt against the Mughal.&#8217; He also sewed 20,000 sacks of cotton for conveying the plunder he expected to seize! But on the dashahara day (10 October), an auspicious time with the Hindus for setting out on campaigns, he sallied forth on a long expedition into Bijapuri territory, with 25,000 men, robbed many rich towns including Bankapur, and then penetrated into Kanara, &#8216;to get more plunder in those rich towns to bear the expenses of his army.&#8217; Early in December he reached Kadra (20 miles north-east of Karwar) with a division of 4,000 foot and 2,000 horse, and stayed there for four days. The bulk of his forces occupied a hill near Hubli. But two severe defeats at the hands of Bahlol and Sharza Khan at Bankapur and Chandagarg (a fort midway between the Belgaum and Savant-vadi towns) respectively forced him to evacuate Kanara quickly.&#8221; <strong>Shivaji and His Times, p.187, By Jadunath Sarkar,</strong> <strong>Orient Blackswan, 01-Jan-1992</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Ali Adil Sah II died on 24th November 1672 and soon afterwards the government of Bijapur fell into weakness and disorder, which Sivaji fully utilised. He took Panhala (6th March 1673) and Satara (27th July), while Pratap Rav Gujar raided the inland parts of Bijapur Kanara, looting Hubli and many other rich cities. Sivaji himself, at the head of a vast army, plundered and occupied Kanara, (October—December 1673).&#8221; HISTORY PART III—MARATHA PERIOD, Chapter 1, p.16 <a href="https://gazetteers.maharashtra.gov.in/cultural.maharashtra.gov.in/english/gazetteer/History%20Part/History_III/chapter_1.pdf" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">https://gazetteers.maharashtra.gov.in/cultural.maharashtra.gov.in/english/gazetteer/History%20Part/History_III/chapter_1.pdf<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>&#8220;Anand Rao, penetrating further into Kanara robbed the bazar (peth) of Sampgaon, about 20 miles from Bankapur, in Bahlol&#8217;s jagir, capturing 150,000 hun worth of booty (23 March). Thence he set out on return with 3,000 ox-loads of plunder.&#8221; <strong>Shivaji and His Times, p.154, By Jadunath Sarkar, Orient Blackswan, 01-Jan-1992</strong></p>
<h3><strong>Plunder of Junnar</strong></h3>
<p>&#8220;In May 1657 Shivaji surprised and plundered Junnar in a night attack and carried off about 110,000£ (3 lakhs of pagodas) in cash, 200 horses, valuable cloth, and other articles.&#8221; <strong>Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency: Poona, Ch XIV, p.226, Printed at the Government Central Press, 1885 &#8211; Bombay (India : State)</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;While Minaji was raiding the Ahmadnagar district in the east, Shivaji was busy looting the Junnar subdivision in the north. One night he silently scaled the walls of Junnar city with rope-ladders and after slaughtering the guards, carried off 300,000 hun in cash, 200 horses, and much costly clothing and jewellery. (Sabh. 8; Adab. 153b.)&#8221; <strong>Shivaji and His Times, Ch III, p.57, by Jadunath Sarkar</strong>, <strong>Second Edition, Longmans, Geen and Co, 1920</strong></p>
<h3><strong>Plunder of Ahmadnagar, Barcelor (Basrur) and seizure of Muslim pilgrims</strong></h3>
<p>&#8220;In 1664, after his return from sacking Surat, Shivaji heard of the death of his father Shahaji. He came to Sinhgad and spent some days in performing his father&#8217;s funeral rites. He then took the title of Raja, struck coins in his name, and spent some months at Raygad hill in Kolaba arranging his government. His fleet scoured the coast and enraged the Musalmans by seizing some holy Mecca pilgrims. In August Shivaji surprised and plundered the town of Ahmadnagar and swept across the country east to Aurangabad. In October the Bijapur troops broke the truce and made a vigorous effort to regain the Konkan. Shivaji seemed to be everywhere and ready at all points. He met the Bijapur army and defeated them with great loss. He burnt Vengurla in Ratnagiri, and hastened to Sinhgad to watch the Moghals who had sent a strong reinforcement to a camp at Junnar. Finding the Moghals did not intend to act on the offensive, he returned to the coast, embarked from Malvan with 4000 men, plundered the rich town of Barcelor about 130 miles south from Goa, sailed back to Gokaru in North Kanara, scoured the country, re-embarked, and returned to his capital.&#8221; <strong>Gazetteer, Volume 18, Part 2, Ch VIII, p.231, Musalmans, Shivaji&#8217;s Rise 1663-1665, Government Central Press, 1885 &#8211; Bombay (India : State)</strong></p>
<p>Plunder of Ahmadnagar also mentioned in <a href="http://ahmednagar.gov.in/gazetteer/his_moghal.html" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">http://ahmednagar.gov.in/gazetteer/his_moghal.html<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>&#8220;Shivaji had stayed in the Junnar subdivision for some time, robbing the villages, as the Mughal reinforcements were late in arriving there and he found the field clear. But, at the approach of Rao Kam and Shaista Khan, he fled from the neighbourhood of Junnar city and wandered over the district for some time, as he could not be caught and crushed. (Adab. 110b, 111b, 112a.) But when the pressure became great, he slipped away to the Ahmadnagar district and began to plunder it. By this time (end of May), however, Nasiri Khan had reached the scene. By a forced march he surprised Shiva&#8217;s army and nearly encircled it. Many of the Marathas were slain, many wounded, and the rest put to flight. But there was no pursuit, as the Mughal horses were too tired. (Kambu, 4b, Adab. 154a, 156a.)&#8221; <strong>Shivaji and His Times, Ch III, p.58, by Jadunath Sarkar, Second Edition, Longmans, Geen and Co, 1920</strong></p>
<h3></h3>
<h3><strong>Plunder of Daulatpura, Khusraupura, Zuhrapura and kidnapping banias</strong></h3>
<p>&#8220;The Marathas were detected in trying to smuggle arms and men into the fort, by concealing the arms in sacks of grain and disguising themselves as drivers of the pack-oxen! Then Shiva threw off the mask. He began to plunder and devastate Adil-Shahi territory again. His men looted the suburbs of Bijapur, Daulatpura (=Khawaspura), Khusraupura and Zuhrapura, and carried off the rich banias for ransom.&#8221; <strong>Shivaji and His Times, Ch XIII, p.363, by Jadunath Sarkar,</strong> <strong>Second Edition, Longmans, Geen and Co, 1920</strong></p>
<h3><strong>Plunder of Jalna and the curse by saint that lead to the death of Shivaji</strong></h3>
<p>Shivaji died of disease, some ascribe the death of Shivaji to the curse of Sayyid Jan Muhammad of Jalna a Muslim saint whose hermitage was plundered by Shivaji.</p>
<p>Sir Jadunath Sarkar mentions Shivaji&#8217;s plunder of Muslim saint&#8217;s hermitage which according to Jadunath Sarkar was Shivaji&#8217;s last campaign. He wrote,</p>
<p>&#8220;We shall now trace the history of Shivaji&#8217;s movements fom 4th November, 1679, when he marched out of Selgur (55 m.w. of Bijapur.) The Maratha cavalry, 18,000 strong, rapidly moved northwards in two parallel through the districts of Mughal Deccan, plundering and burning all the places in their track and taking an immense booty in cash and kind. In the middle of the month, Jalna, a populous trading town, 40 miles east of Aurangabad, was captured and plundered. Here the godly saint, Sayyid Jan Muhammad, had his hermitage in a garden in the suburbs. As Shivaji in this raids always spared the holy men and holy places of all religions, most of the wealthy men of Jalna had taken refuge in this hermitage with their money and jewels. The raiders, finding very little booty in the town and learning of the concealment of the wealth in the saint&#8217;s abode, entered it and robbed the refugees, wounding many of them. The holy man appealed to them to desist, but they only abused and threatened him for his pains. Then the man of God, &#8216;who had marvellous efficacy of prayer,&#8217; cursed Shivaji, and popular belief ascribed the Rajah&#8217;s death five months afterwards to those curses. (K.K. ii. 271; Dil, 165;91 Q.B. 88.)&#8221; Shivaji and His Times, p.256, By Jadunath Sarkar, Orient Blackswan, 01-Jan-1992</p>
<p>&#8220;In the meantime a quarrel arose with Bijapur, and a Moghal army advanced from Aurangabad against the Adil Shahi capital. The campaign was unsuccessful and Khan Jahan was recalled in 1677. The emperor also disapproved of the compact that had been entered into with Sivaji. Sultan Mu&#8217;azzam was again appointed viceroy, but Diler Khan retained the command in the field, and in 1679 a fresh expedition was sent against Bijapur. Sivaji ravaged the country up to Jalna, and ransacked this city for four days. A Moghal force under Ranmast Khan was hastily despatched from Aurangabad. Sivaji was attacked near Sangamner, and only escaped by the help of his guides.&#8221; <a href="https://cultural.maharashtra.gov.in/english/gazetteer/Beed/his_mediaeval_period.html" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">https://cultural.maharashtra.gov.in/english/gazetteer/Beed/his_mediaeval_period.html<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<h3><strong>Killing of two Bishops</strong></h3>
<p>&#8220;The Viceroy in 1667 issued an order that all except the Roman Catholics were to be deported from Goa. The threat of a large-scale massacre of the Hindus was feared as a consequence. Shivaji the Maratha king, in retaliation detained four missionaries from Bardez and asked them to embrace Hinduism, but when they refused to do so, they were killed. The Portuguese Viceroy withdrew his order of deportation as a result.&#8221; <strong>Discoveries, Missionary Expansion, and Asian Cultures, p.93, By Teotonio R. De Souza, Concept Publishing Company, 01-Jan-1994</strong></p>
<p>So the life of Shivaji was nothing but like a bandit. Who plundered cities and its residents, burned houses. From begging for jagirs to plundering cities, it proves that Shivaji was a money hungry man. And such bandit is hailed as a national hero just because of his battle against Mughals. Even when he had Muslims and some of the high rank officers in Mughals were Hindus.</p>
<p>Other Maratha kings followed the footsteps of Shivaji in plundering cities. Balaji Baji Rao plundered many cities. Moropant plundered Nasik. Shivaji&#8217;s son Sambhaji and grandson Shahji also plundered cities and villages,</p>
<p>&#8220;Shivaji plundered Khandesh, sacking and burning the great marts of Chopda and Dharangaon, two of the most flourishing places in the district. His death in 1680 did little to restore peace. Four years later (1684), the Emperor Aurangzeb, entering Khandesh with a great army, after a fierce resistance gained the forts of Chandor, Galna, and Salher, and passed to the south. No sooner were the Moghalss gone, than (1685) Sambhaji overran and plundered the whole district, took Burhanpur, and retired ravaging the country along the base of the Satmala hills towards Nasik&#8230;After Aurangzeb&#8217;s death (1707), disorder still further increased. In 1708, Shahu, Shivaji;s grandson, gaining his liberty, raised a body of troops in the west of Khandesh and plundered the country from Surat to Burhanpur.&#8221; <strong>Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency: Khandesh, Chapter VII, p.251, Printed at the Government Central Press, 1880 &#8211; Bombay (India : State)</strong></p>
<h3><strong>Plunder of Nasik by Marathas</strong></h3>
<p>&#8220;In 1682, Prince Akbar, the rebel son of Aurangzeb, took refuge in Nasik, hut being closely pursued passed on to the Konkan. In 1684 the Marathas plundered round Nasik, but fled on the approach of the Moghal general Khan Jahan.&#8221; <a href="https://cultural.maharashtra.gov.in/english/gazetteer/Nasik/022%20Places/001%20Place.htm" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">https://cultural.maharashtra.gov.in/english/gazetteer/Nasik/022%20Places/001%20Place.htm<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>The 1741 Maratha invasion of Bengal is also important.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the 10 years that they plundered Bengal, their effect was devastating, causing great human hardship as well as economic privation. Contemporary Dutch sources believed that the Bargis killed 4 lakh Bengalis and a great many merchants in western Bengal, <a href="https://books.google.co.in/books?id=lIZrfokYSY8C&amp;pg=PA72&amp;lpg=PA72&amp;dq=maharashtra+purana+bargi&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=PDas0o2YJJ&amp;sig=ekOnp-K_eQud4dHddsMssVmzTXk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjM0cW5yuzJAhWHjo4KHdQGDD0Q6AEIQTAG" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" data-wpel-link="external">writes<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> historian PJ Marshal, &#8220;were permanently crippled by losses and extractions&#8221;.<br />
In the Maharashtra Purana, a poem in Bengali written by Gangaram, the poet describes the destruction caused by the raiders in great detail:</p>
<p>This time none escaped,<br />
Brahmanas, and Vaisnavas, Sannyasis, and householders,<br />
all had the same fate, and cows were massacred along with men.</p>
<p>Not only did the Bargis [Marathas] loot the countryside, but in a sign of their effectiveness, managed to raid the capital of Bengal, Murshidabad and even sack the house of one of the richest Indians at the time, the Marwari banker, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jagat_Seth" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Jagat Seth<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>.&#8221; <a href="http://scroll.in/article/776978/forgotten-indian-history-the-brutal-maratha-invasions-of-bengal" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">http://scroll.in/article/776978/forgotten-indian-history-the-brutal-maratha-invasions-of-bengal<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>&#8220;The Marathas first invaded Bengal in 1742. Of their behaviour, the New Cambridge History of India tells us that &#8220;all authorities, both Indian and European are agreed&#8221;. A contemporary writer calls them &#8220;slayers of pregnant women and infants&#8221; and Sarkar has recorded their gang-rape of Hindu women, inexplicably stuffing the mouths of their victims with dust and breaking their arms and tying them behind their backs. The only Indian to try and protect his subjects against the Marathas incidentally, was the Mughal governor Ali Vardi Khan. So much for Akhand Bharat. But I must say that the Marathas did not behave differently from any other ruler or warrior community, and the idea of a unified Hindu sentiment exists only in the imagination of those who get their history from the movies.&#8221; <a href="http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/aakarvani/bajirao-the-great-hindu-nationalist-thats-only-in-the-movies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/aakarvani/bajirao-the-great-hindu-nationalist-thats-only-in-the-movies/<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>Marathas even looted temples. When a part of the Maratha contingent returning form defeat in the third Mysore war (1791) against Tipu Sultan plundered Sringeri and looted its temples, Tipu Sultan, commiserating with the matha, sponsored the restoration of the temples.</p>
<p>Maratha kings were also casteist. Maratha Empire was later controlled by Brahmins who oppressed the low caste and this lead to a battle between Peshwas and Mahars. 500 Mahars in 1818 under the flag of British defeated strong army of 25,000 Peshwas.</p>
<p>&#8220;Although the first Maratha ruler, Shivaji, freely recruited Mahars in his army, two centuries later, by the time of the Peshwas, the status of Mahars was lower than ever. The Peshwas were Brahmins of a particularly orthodox bent. Stories told even today recall how when Mahars entered towns, they were made to tie brooms behind their backs to sweep up the dust of their footprints and to tie pots in front on their necks to collect their spittle. It was also a criminal offence to hide one&#8217;s caste.<br />
Dalit recountings of the battle emphasise that when the English were approaching, Mahars offered their services to Peshwa Bajirao II. It was only when he rejected them yet again that they switched their loyalty to the British instead.</p>
<p>As the story goes, on New Year&#8217;s Day in 1818, about 500 soldiers of the East India Company&#8217;s Bombay Native Infantry regiment led by Colonel FF Staunton waded across the Bhima river and, at Bhima Koregaon, routed a superior force of 25,000 well-equipped soldiers of the Peshwa.<br />
There is some room for exaggeration. Contemporary English accounts, for instance, mention 900 Mahar soldiers instead of 500, and 20,000 Peshwa soldiers not 25,000. Besides, the Peshwas were already on the back foot by the time of this battle – the East India Company had taken Pune, the Peshwa&#8217;s capital, some months before and had raised its flag at the palace at Shanivarwada.&#8221; <a href="http://scroll.in/article/801298/why-lakhs-of-people-celebrate-the-british-victory-over-the-maratha-peshwas-every-new-year" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">http://scroll.in/article/801298/why-lakhs-of-people-celebrate-the-british-victory-over-the-maratha-peshwas-every-new-year<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>“Pre-colonial Maharashtra was ruled by the Peshwas who were Chitpavan Brahmins. A major part of their state policy included the enforcement of varnashrama dharma, or caste privileges. The Peshwa state decided and fixed caste hierarchies and sought to regulate both the public and private behaviour of individuals. Caste norms that were customs in other parts of India were legally enforceable in Maharashtra. Lands belonging to Saraswat Brahmins were confiscated as the state decided that they were not high status (trikarmi) brahmins. The Prabhus were directed to visit only temples frequented by shudras. The sonars, the goldsmith community, was ordered to wear dhotis, like shudras, and to give up the salutation namaskar, and use Ram Ram instead. The Peshwa state fined or arrested, and confiscated the property of non-Brahmins if they performed Vedic rituals. The state controlled the tiniest of social space, viz., dressing habits and the social and public behaviour of people in the remotest villages through its efficient bureaucracy. Brahmin and non-brahmin men were punished for not marrying off their daughters before the age of twelve. Ramakrishna Gopal Bhandarkar, the famous Sanskrit scholar of the nineteenth century, has called Peshwa rule a triple trianny &#8216;political tryanny, social tryanny and priestly tryanny or the tryanny of caste&#8217;.&#8221;<br />

He was a small-time ruler. Sir Jadunath Sarkar called him a &#8220;chieftain&#8221;. Mughal, Portuguese and East India Company&#8217;s several records indicate that Shivaji was a plunderer. Eliot, Dawson, Ishwari Prasad, Akhilesh Mishra and Sacchidanand Sinha went to the extent of calling Shivaji a &#8220;self-styled king&#8221; who manipulated his way to the throne. Shivaji&#8217;s entire life was a saga of plunders. He was indeed brave but never so great as people in Maharashtra think he was, thanks to the emergence of Hindu political outfits like Shiv Sena, Sambhaji Brigade and MNS. Their distorted versions of history and Shivaji&#8217;s exaggerated &#8220;exploits&#8221; have been further exploited by a rabid Hindu leader like Modi, who has a political agenda and is blissfully unaware of his country&#8217;s history.</p>
<p>One wonders who made Shivaji so great? He was never a real threat to the Mughal empire and it&#8217;s a fact that had Aurangzeb wanted, he could have had Shivaji eliminated in Agra itself. Shivaji&#8217;s much tom-tommed escape from Agra in a fruit-basket is apocryphal. This never happened. Mirza Raja Jai Singh&#8217;s son Ram Singh helped Shivaji escape from Agra. Alas, we&#8217;re too gullible and believe without ever questioning.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color:red;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><strong>Note: This thread is dedicated to Dr B R Ambedkar &amp; Peryar.</strong></span><br />
This article has been written in the background of Saffronization of Education &amp; educational instutions by Hardcore Hindutvawadis and the boot lickers of Brahmins.<br />
There are Futile attempts going on all over the Country, on net to Disprove Aryan Invasion theory. But yet there are many Questions or rather facts that these Hindutva wadis are unable to answer.<br />
Numerious National &amp; International Secular Archiologists, Historians, Genesists, Archiozoologists have proved Aryan Invasion to be an Established Truth &amp; Reality rather than just a theory.<br />
<span id="more-3098"></span><br />
Even if we consider all the above mentioned fellows WRONG, yet the Scriptures of Hinduism, does give a clear cut picture of Invasion &amp; Genocide of the Inhabitants of this original land.<br />
This article will present all the evidances + links to Zorastraism &amp; the Origin of so called Hinduism from the land of ancient Persia.<br />
Some psyco self claimed historians such as P N Oak &amp; Knapp have started claiming the world belongs to the Hinduism drama. Which will be Exposed in a seperate thread.<br />
One question that a Hindu who does not believe in the Aryan Invasion has to ask himself is, The whole world accepted Aryan Invasion of India till a few years ago, now suddenly why this hypocracy regarding Disproving it ?<br />
<span style="color:#008400;">Satyamewa Jayathe</span><br />
Truth Alone Trumphs!<br />
Let the sword of Truth Un-Veil numerious aspects of Aryan Invasion &amp; Genocide of Dasyus.<br />
Thank u.<br />

<span style="color:blue;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><strong>The Word ARYA has got 4 meanings:</strong></span><br />
1. The variant *rya- is found unchanged in Sanskrit, where it referred to the upper crust of ancient Indian society. (Brahmins=Aryans)[From Sanskrit rya-, noble, Aryan.]
2. The term &#8220;Aryan&#8221; as a synonym for &#8220;Indo-European&#8221; or to a lesser extent for &#8220;Indo-Iranian&#8221; peoples.<br />
3. The first of these is the form found in Iranian, as ultimately in the name of Iran itself (from Middle Persian rn (ahr), &#8220;(Land) of the Iranians,&#8221; from the genitive plural of r, &#8220;Iranian&#8221;).<br />
4. In Nazism and neo-Nazism, a non-Jewish Caucasian, especially one of Nordic type, supposed to be part of a master race.<br />
<span style="color:#008400;">So Here we will be using the second meaning, which is a group of Indo-europian/ Indo-Iranian people who came to India through Khyber passes of Himalayas.<br />
Though it has a signifance with third point.</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="color:red;">Dasyus/ Dasa</span><br />
<span style="color:blue;">Dasa (Sanskrit: </span><span style="font-family:Kokila;">दस</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:blue;"><strong>, IAST: dāsa) is a Sanskrit term. Under the primary meaning &#8216;enemy&#8217; sometimes relates to tribes identified as the enemies of the Vedic tribes in the Rigveda. </strong></span></span><br />
The identity of the Dasa has caused much debate, closely tied to arguments over Indo-Aryan migration, the claim that the Indo-Aryan authors of the Rigveda entered India from outside, displacing its earlier inhabitants.<br />
Recent scholars, notably Asko Parpola, have claimed that they were fellow Indo-Iranians of the BMAC, who initially rejected Aryan religious practices but were later merged with them.<br />
In the Rig Veda, Dasa, Dasyu and similar terms (e.g. Pani) occur sometimes in conjunction with the terms krsna (&#8220;black&#8221;) or asikni (&#8220;black&#8221;). This was often the basis for a &#8220;racial&#8221; interpretation of the Vedic texts.<br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:blue;"><strong>There are three instances in the Rig Veda where the phrase krsna (or ashikni) tvac occurs, literally translating to &#8220;black (or swarthy) skin&#8221;:</strong></span></span><br />
1.130.8de mánave śâsad avratân tvácaṃ kṛṣṇâm arandhayat<br />
— &#8220;Plaguing the lawless he [Indra] gave up to Manu&#8217;s seed the dusky skin&#8221; (trans. Griffith)<br />
9.41.1 prá yé gâvo ná bhûrṇayas / tveṣâ ayâso ákramuḥ / ghnántaḥ kṛṣṇâm ápa tvácam[16]
— &#8220;(Praising the Soma-juices) which descend like streams of water, swift, brilliant, rapid driving off the black covered (Rakshasa who are darkness)&#8221;[17]
9.73.5cd índradviṣṭām ápa dhamanti māyáyā tvácam ásiknīm bhûmano divás pári[18]
— &#8220;Blowing away with supernatural might from earth and from the heavens the swarthy skin which Indra hates.&#8221; (trans. Griffith)<br />
Tvac &#8220;skin&#8221; does, however, also take a secondary, more general meaning of &#8220;surface, cover&#8221; in the Rigveda, in particular referring to the Earth&#8217;s surface.<br />
For this reason, there can be debate on whether instances of krsna tvac should be taken to refer literally to a &#8220;black skinned people&#8221;.<br />
A Dasyu is a member of an aboriginal people in India encountered and embattled by the invading Aryans (c. 1500 bc).<br />
They were described by the Aryans as a dark-skinned, harsh-spoken people who worshiped the phallus.<br />
This allusion has persuaded many scholars that worship of the linga, the Hindu religious symbol, originated with them; it may, however, have referred to their sexual practices.<br />
They lived in fortified places from which they sent out armies.<br />
They may be considered the original Sudras, or labourers, who served the three higher classes of Brahman, Kshatriya (warrior), and Vaishya (mercantile), from whose ritual communion they were excluded.<br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:blue;"><strong>The main difference between the Aryas and the Dasas in the Rig Veda is a difference of religion.</strong></span></span><br />
Already A. A. Macdonell and A. B. Keith (1912) remarked that: &#8220;The great difference between the Dasyus and the Aryans was their religion&#8230; It is significant that constant reference is made to difference in religion between Aryans and Dasa and Dasyu.&#8221;<br />
The Dasas and Dasyus are also described as brahma-dvisah in the Rig Veda RV 5.42.9; 8.45.23; 10.36.9; 10.160.4; 10.182.3, which Ralph T.H. Griffith translates as &#8220;those who hate devotion&#8221; or &#8220;prayer haters&#8221;.<br />
Thus Dasa has also been interpreted as meaning the people that don&#8217;t follow the same religion as the Aryans. Rig Veda 10.22.8 describes the Dasa-Dasyus as a-karman (non-performers of Aryan sacrifices), anya-vrata (observers of other rites) and in Rig Veda 10.105.8 they are described as anrc (non-singer of laudatory hymns). In RV 8.70.11 they are described as a-deva-yu (not regarding Deva ).<br />
<span style="color:#008400;">While the terms Dasa and Dasyu have a negative meaning in Sanskrit, their Iranian counterparts Daha and Dahyu have preserved their positive (or neutral) meaning. This is similar to the Sanskrit terms Deva (a &#8220;positive&#8221; term) and Asura (a &#8220;negative&#8221; term). The Iranian counterparts of these terms (Daeva and Ahura) have opposite meanings.</span><br />
Dasyus is in Iranian &#8220;dahyu&#8221; and means tribe, province and district. &#8220;Dah-&#8221; means &#8220;male, man&#8221; in Iranian. The &#8220;dahyu-pati&#8221; (also dahyunam) was the head of the tribe. The Greek &#8220;des-potes and the English &#8220;despot&#8221; correspond to this term (Windfuhr 1999). A &#8220;dahyu-sasti&#8221; (command of dahyus) is a confederation of two or more dahyus.<br />
Other hostile tribes, besides the Dasas and Dasyus, that are mentioned in the Vedic texts are the Panis (Afghan Pannis?), Pakthas (Pakthun or Pashtuns?), Parshus (Persian tribes?), Prthus (Parthians?) and Bhalanas (Baluchis?). The Irish term Déisi may be cognate; it originally described &#8220;vassals&#8221; or &#8220;subjects&#8221; and was later the proper name of certain population groups.<br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:blue;"><strong>Thus Dasa has also been interpreted as meaning the people that don&#8217;t follow the same religion as the Aryans. </strong></span></span><br />
Rig Veda 10.22.8 describes the Dasa-Dasyus as a-karman (non-performers of Aryan sacrifices), anya-vrata (observers of other rites) and in Rig Veda 10.105.8 they are described as anrc (non-singer of laudatory hymns).<br />
In RV 8.70.11 they are described as a-deva-yu (not regarding Deva ).<br />
Sri Aurobindo commented that in the RV III.34 hymn, where the word Arya varna occurs, Indra is described as the increaser of the thoughts of his followers:<br />
&#8220;the shining hue of these thoughts, sukram varnam asam, is evidently the same as that sukra or sveta Aryan hue which is mentioned in verse 9.<br />
Indra carries forward or increases the &#8220;colour&#8221; of these thoughts beyond the opposition of the Panis, pra varnam atiracchukram; in doing so he slays the Dasyus and protects or fosters and increases the Aryan &#8220;colour&#8221;, hatvi dasyun pra aryam varnam avat.&#8221;<br />
The term krsnavonih in RV 2.20.7 has been interpreted by Asko Parpola as meaning &#8220;which in their wombs hid the black people&#8221;.<br />
Sethna (1992) writes, referring to a comment by Richard Hartz, that &#8220;there is no need to follow Parpola in assuming a further unexpressed word meaning &#8220;people&#8221; in the middle of the compound krsnayonih&#8221;, and the better known translation by Griffith, i.e. &#8220;who dwelt in darkness&#8221; can be considered as essentially correct.<br />
Another scholar, Hans Hock (1999), finds Karl Friedrich Geldner&#8217;s translation of krsnayonih (RV 2.20.7) as &#8220;Blacks in their wombs&#8221; and of krsnagarbha (RV 1.101.1) as &#8220;pregnant with the Blacks&#8221; &#8220;quite recherché&#8221; and thinks that it could refer to the &#8220;dark world&#8221; of the Dasas.<br />

The coming of the Aryans into India raised new problems &#8211; racial and political. The conquered race, the Dravidians had a long background of civilization behind them, but there is a little doubt that the Aryans considered themselves vastly superior to them and a wide gulf seperated the two.<br />

&#8221; After all there is throughout this world so far as man is concerned but a single race &#8211; the human race, kept alive by one common blood, the human blood. All other talk is at best provisional, a makeshift and only relatively true. (&#8230;) Even as it is, not even the aborigines of the Andamans are without some sprinkling of the so-called Aryan blood in their veins and vice-versa. Truly speaking all that one can claim is that one has the blood of all mankind in one&#8217;s veins. The fundamental unity of man from pole to pole is true, all else only relatively so&#8221;.<br />

Heinrich Himmler (the Reichsfuhrer of the SS), the person ordered by Adolf Hitler to implement the final solution (Holocaust), told his personal masseur Felix Kersten that he always carried with him a copy of the ancient Aryan scripture, the Bhagavad Gita because it relieved him of guilt about what he was doing — he felt that like the warrior Arjuna, he was simply doing his duty without attachment to his actions.<br />

.&#8221; Geneticist and anthropologist Spencer Wells states that &#8220;The Aryans came from outside India. We actually have genetic evidence for that. Very clear genetic evidence from a marker that arose on the southern steppes of Russia and the Ukraine around 5,000 to 10,000 years ago. And it subsequently spread to the east and south through Central Asia reaching India.&#8221; M17 &#8220;shows that there was a massive genetic influx into India from the steppes within the past 10,000 years.Taken with the archaeological data, we can say that the old hypothesis of an invasion of people – not merely their language – from the steppe appears to be true.&#8221;</strong></span><br />

Kazanas argues that this indicates that the Harappan civilization must have been dominated by Indo-Aryan speakers, supposing that the arrival of Indo-Aryan migrants in Late Harappan times to the remnants of a Indus Valley Civilization formerly stretching over vast area could not have resulted in the suppression of the entire native hydronymy. </strong></span><br />

<span style="color:red;">&#8221; And what your European pandits say about the Aryan&#8217;s sweeping from some foreign land, snatching away the lands of the aboriginals and settling India by exterminating them, is all pure nonsense, foolish talk. Strange, that our Indian scholars too say amen to them, and all these monstrous lies are taught to our boys. This is very bad indeed. </span><br />
In what Veda, in what Sukta, so you find that the Aryans came to India from a foreign country? Where do you get the idea that they slaughtered the wild aborigines? What do you gain by talking such nonsense?&#8221;<br />
&#8212; [ ` Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda &#8216;, 1963, p.534-535 ]
<span style="color:blue;"><br />
In Rig Veda III:34:9 Indra killed the Dasyus (dark skinned natives) and &#8220;gave protection to the Aryan color.&#8221; </span><br />
They arrogantly proclaim, &#8220;Let those who have no weapons suffer sorrow&#8221; (Rig Veda IV:5:14.)]
Indra is praised for killing thousands of the abject tribes of Dasas with his arrow and taking great vengeance with &#8220;murdering weapons.&#8221; (Rig Veda IV:28:3−4)<br />
One hymn mentions sending thirty thousand Dasas &#8220;to slumber&#8221; and another hymn sixty thousand slain. A hymn dedicated to the weapons of war (Rig Veda VI:75) refers to a warrior &#8220;armed with mail,&#8221; using a bow to win cattle and subdue all regions, &#8220;upstanding in the car the skillful charioteer guides his strong horses on whithersoe&#8217;er he will.&#8221; The arrows had iron mouths and shafts &#8220;with venom smeared&#8221; that &#8220;not one be left alive.&#8221;<br />
Hymn VII:83 begins, &#8220;Looking to you and your alliance, O ye men, armed with broad axes they went forward, fain for spoil. Ye smote and slew his Dasa and his Aryan enemies.&#8221;<br />
The basic belief of the prayers and sacrifices is that they will help them to gain their desires and overcome their enemies, as in Rig Veda VIII:31:15: &#8220;The man who, sacrificing, strives to win the heart of deities will conquer those who worship not.&#8221;<br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:blue;"><strong>&#8220;He, much invoked, hath slain Dasyus and Simyus, after his wont, and laid them low with arrows. The mighty thunderer with his fair−complexioned friends won the land, the sunlight, and the waters.&#8221; −−Rig Veda I:100:18.</strong></span></span><br />
The ancient singer praises the god who &#8220;destroyed the Dasyans and protected the Aryan colour.&#8221; [ Rg.V. III.34.9 ]

The singers mention &#8220;the black skin, the hated of Indra&#8221;, being swept ourtof heaven [ RgV. IX.73.5 ] &#8220;Indra protected in battle the Aryan worshipper, he subdued the lawless for Manu, he conqured the black skin.&#8221;<br />
[ Rg.V. I.130.8 ] The sacrificer poured out thanks to his god for &#8220;scattering the slave bands of black descent&#8221;, and for stamping out &#8221; the vile Dasyan colour.&#8221; [ Rg.V. II.20.7, II.12.4 ] [ ANn. 115 ]
&#8220;Dasam varnam adharam&#8221; [ Rg.V. II.12.4 ]
Indra is called Puroha or Purandhara, `sacker of cities&#8217; Indra overthrew 100 Puras made of stone ( asmanmayi ) for his worshipper Divodasa [ RgV 4.30.20 ], evidently belonging to Sambara who is a Dasa ( non-Aryan/demon ) of the mountain [ RgV 6.26.5 ]
The famous Harappa hymn of the Rig Veda describes with praise Indra&#8217;s destruction of Harappa<br />
&#8221; In aid of Abhyavartin Cayamana, Indra destroyed the seed of Virasakha.<br />

<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:red;"><strong>Some more Proof&#8217;s from Rig Veda Proving it to be composed OUTSIDE India</strong></span></span><br />
<span style="color:blue;">1.The Indus Valley Civilization was quite advanced and urbanized for its era. Based on the IAM, he migrating Aryans, who wrote the Rig Veda, would have had some contact with the Harappans before settling in their lands. The Aryans would also have begun to use some of the resources the Harappans possessed; however, the Rig Veda possesses some gaps which indicate it was composed prior to the first use of these resources in India.</span><br />

2. The Rig-Veda knows no silver. It knows ayas (metal or copper/bronze) and candra or hiran-ya (gold) but not silver. Silver is denoted by rajatám híran-yam literally &#8216;white gold&#8217; and appears in post-Rigvedic texts. There is a generally accepted demarcation line for the use of silver at around 4000 BC and this metal is archaeologically attested in the Harappan Civilization.<br />

3. The Harappan culture is also unknown to the RV. The characteristic features of the Harappan culture are urban life, large buildings, permanently erected fire altars and bricks. There is no word for brick in the Rig Veda and iswttakaa (brick) appears only in post-Rigvedic texts.<br />
(Kazanas 2000:13) &amp; G C Pande &amp; D Krishna, special issue of Journal of Indian Council of Philosophical Research (June, 2001)<br />
The Rigvedic altar is a shallow bed dug in the ground and covered with grass (e.g. RV 5.11.2, 7.43.2-3; Parpola 1988: 225). Fixed brick-altars are very common in post-Rigvedic texts.<br />

<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:blue;"><strong>4. The RV mentions no rice or cotton. A compound term is used which later referred to rice cakes used for sacrificial purposes, but the word vrīhí, meaning &#8216;rice&#8217;, does not occur. Rice was found in at least three Harappan sites: Rangpur (2000 BCE &#8211; 1500 BCE), Lothal (c 2000 BCE) and Mohenjodaro (c 2500 BCE) as Piggott, Grist and others testify. Yet, despite the importance of the rice in ritual in later times, the Rig Veda knows nothing of it. The cultivation of cotton is well attested in the Harappan civilization and is found at many sites thereafter.</strong></span></span><br />

5. Nakshatra were developed in 2400 BCE, they are important in a religious context yet the Rig Veda does not mention this, which suggests the Rig Veda is before 2400 BCE. The youngest book only mentions constellations,a concept known to all cultures, without specifying them as lunar mansions.<br />

6. On the other hand, it has been claimed that the Rigveda has no term for &#8220;sword&#8221;, while Bronze swords were used aplenty in the Bactrian culture and in Pirak. Ralph Griffith uses &#8220;sword&#8221; twelve times in his translation, including in the old books 5 and 7, but in most cases a literal translation would be more generic &#8220;sharp implement&#8221; (e.g. vāśī), the transition from &#8220;dagger&#8221; to &#8220;sword&#8221; in the Bronze Age being a gradual process.<br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:blue;"><strong>7. The fore-mentioned features are found in post Rigvedic texts – the Samhitas, the Brahmanas and fully in the Sutra literature. For instance, brick altars are mentioned in Satapatha Brahmanaṇa 7.1.1.37, or 10.2.3.1 etc. Rice ( vrihi ) is found in AV 6.140.2; 7.1.20; etc. Cotton karpasa appears first in Gautama&#8217;s (1.18) and in Bandhāyana&#8217;s (14.13.10) Dharmasūtra. The fact of the convergence of the post-Rigvedic texts and the Harappan culture was noted long ago by archaeologists. Bridget and F. Raymond Allchin stated unequivocally that these features are of the kind &#8220;described in detail in the later Vedic literature&#8221; (1982: 203).</strong></span></span><br />

Based on these set of statements, OIT proponents argue that the whole of the RV, except for some few passages which may be of later date, must have been composed prior to Indus Valley Civilization.<br />

Update on the Aryan Invasion Debate by Koenraad Elst.<br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:red;"><strong>What will happen if Aryan Invasion Theory is accepted?</strong></span></span><br />
<span style="color:blue;"><br />
1. The Aryan invasion theory denies the Indian origin of<br />
India&#8217;s predominant culture, but gives the credit for<br />
Indian culture to invaders from elsewhere.</span><br />
2. It even teaches that some of the most revered books of<br />
Hindu scripture are not actually Indian, and it<br />
devalues India&#8217;s culture by portraying it as less<br />
ancient than it actually is.<br />
3. The theory included unacceptably racist ideas:<br />
4. It suggested that Indian culture was not a culture in<br />
its own right, but a synthesis of elements from other<br />
cultures.<br />
5. It implied that Hinduism was not an authentically<br />
Indian religion but the result of cultural imperialism.<br />
6. It suggested that Indian culture was static, and only<br />
changed under outside influences.<br />
7. It suggested that the dark-skinned Dravidian people of<br />
the South of India had got their faith from<br />
light-skinned Aryan invaders.<br />
8. It implied that indigenous people were incapable of<br />
creatively developing their faith.<br />
9. It suggested that indigenous peoples could only<br />
acquire new religious and cultural ideas from other<br />
races, by invasion or other processes.<br />
10. It accepted that race was a biologically based concept<br />
(rather than, at least in part, a social construct)<br />
that provided a sensible way of ranking people in a<br />
hierarchy, which provided a partial basis for the<br />
caste system.<br />
11. It provided a basis for racism in the Imperial context<br />
by suggesting that the peoples of Northern India were<br />
descended from invaders from Europe and so racially<br />
closer to the British Raj.<br />
12. It gave a historical precedent to justify the role and<br />
status of the British Raj, who could argue that they<br />
were transforming India for the better in the same way<br />
that the Aryans had done thousands of years earlier.<br />
13. It downgraded the intellectual status of India and its<br />
people by giving a falsely late date to elements of<br />
Indian science and culture.<br />

<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:red;"><strong>Ancient Persian influence on Hinduism.</strong></span><br />
</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="color:blue;">The Aryan invadors who lived in Persia and later, in India, had a lot in common by way of phonetics, language, spirituality and reverence for nature… </span><br />
Hinduism pertains to Hindus but the word Hindu itself is actually a Persian word coined by Cyrus the great in the 6th century B.C. to describe people who lived beyond the river Indus which was the eastern boundary of the ancient Persian empire. The Persians had a phonetic problem with the letter &#8216;S&#8217; hence, Sindhu became Hindu just as Rigveda&#8217;s Soma came from Zend Avesta&#8217;s Hoama. Such fascinating phonetic affinities!<br />
Even the word Shudra in Hinduism&#8217;s caste-system came from the Persian word Hatoksha. Originally, there were only three castes but the camp followers collected by Persians on their travels were called Hatokshas. The Romans, who separated from the original Aryanstock at a much earlier date than the Brahmins called fire Athar. In old Sanskrit, lightning is called Atharvan. In ancient Persia Arthvan meant a priest and this word evolved to become Brahmin.<br />
Persian herders of cattle were called Vastrayosh and after they settled down from their nomadic existence to become cultivators and later, traders, the word evolved into Hinduism&#8217;s Vaishya caste. In the Vedas, waters are called Apo-Devi and in the Avesta, Apo-Vanghuish. Also, the prominent deities of the Rig Veda like Surya, Varun and Aryaman have come from the Avesta.<br />
In fact, originally, the Rig Veda was written in the Kharoshti script which like Persian is written backwards i.e. from right to left. The Brahmi script came much later and our Devnagri script even later than Brahmi. In Lemuria, Atlantis and Babylon, there was the Akhadian script, found on Babylonian tablets during excavations, from which the Pali script evolved. This is why, since ancient Persia was the melting-pot of civilisations, Sanskrit sounds like old Persian e.g. Veeg the seed became the Sanskritised Beej.<br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:blue;"><strong>The Aryan invadors who lived in Persia and later, in India, had a lot in common by way of phonetics, language, spirituality and reverence for nature. The five elements of nature called Panchamahabhoot were worshipped, with fire and it&#8217;s apex in ancient India. This idea came from Persia and the oldest religion in the world viz. Zorastrianism which as and still is, the most eco-friendly religion in the world. It is a cardinal sin for a Parsi to defile any of nature&#8217;s elements which is why, a corpse, a filthy shell after it&#8217;s pranic energy has left it, is never to be burnt on fire. That would be a grave sin to the element of agni. </strong></span></span><br />
Rather, a Parsi feeds the fire within a fire-temple with sweet-smelling sandalwood and frankincense.<br />
Persian warriors were called ratheshwars, and this word evolved into kshatriyas. Even wars were fought in a noble fashion through there&#8217;s nothing noble about a war to my way of thinking. In the ancient world, man lived with nature. He depended on nature for his food, shelter and livelihood. To him, the forces of nature and her five elements appeared to be pulsating with life. The sun, moon, stars, clouds, earth, springs, rivers, oceans, trees, grass, flowers were, he believed, presided over by invisible intelligences which is a cosmic fact. Geofrey Hodsun has proved this through his clairvoyant theosophical books.<br />
In return for nature&#8217;s bounties and blessings, man gave homage which took the form of the various hymns and prayers in the Avesta as well as the Rig Veda. Hence, there are so many similarities and spiritual parallels between Ancient Persian theology and that of the pre-vedic and vedic times. The Persian Goddess of water was Ahurani, similar to the vedic Asurani. Feeding the sacred fire was common to the Persians as well as the pre-vedic society. So many similarities, so much in common, because, in the final analysis, it&#8217;s the same supreme energy we all worship!<br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:red;"><strong>Hinduism vs Zoroastrianism</strong></span></span><br />
<span style="color:blue;">The history of Indian thought commences only when the Aryans of Central Asia separated themselves into two groups, the one making through Afghanistan to India and the other spreading over the territory called Iran. </span><br />
Gilbert Murray<br />
The Avesta is nearer the Veda than the Veda to its own epic Sanskrit.<br />
Dr. Mills<br />
Varuna is the god of sky&#8230;He is identical with the Greek Ouranos and the Ahuramazda of the Avesta.<br />
S.Radhakrishnan<br />
Like the Rigvedic Aryans, the ancient Iranians worshipped gods like Mitra, Vayu, Verutraghna. They also wore the sacred thread and worshipped fire. They had a social organization that was in some ways similar to the Vedic occupation based social system.<br />
Zoroastrian religion was practiced mostly in Iran, or the ancient Persia. Its founder Zarathushtra was born in ancient Iran. The ancient Iranians were Aryans and the world Iran is actually a corrupt form of the word Aryan. The Iranian Aryans were cousins of the Indian Aryans and the language spoken by them was similar to Sanskrit in many ways. They came from the same stock and probably might have even lived together for sometime before parting ways.<br />
However apart from these similarities, there was little else common between Zoroastrianism founded by Zarathushtra and the Vedic Religion that took shape in India. Some differences also seemed to have cropped between Zoroastrians and the Vedic people during the later period as is evident from the use of certain epithets which denote some degree of animosity. The Iranian Ahura (God) became the Indian asura (demon) and the Indian devas (gods) became the Iranian equivalent of evil spirits.<br />
<span style="color:#008400;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><strong>This is the completion, further updates will be added very soon.</strong></span><br />
<span style="color:blue;">CONCLUSION!</span><br />
<span style="color:red;">Further, this desire by Hindutva supporters to &#8220;prove&#8221; by any means that Aryans are &#8220;indigenous&#8221; people directly relate to their contemporary political agenda back in India of distinguishing the &#8220;indigenous Aryan Hindus&#8221; from &#8220;foreign Muslim and Christian invaders&#8221; and thereby characterizing India&#8217;s Muslim and Christian minorities as &#8220;traitors&#8221; that need to be marginalized and persecuted. </span><br />
Inspite of Innumerable Evidences &amp; Proofs of Aryan Invasion, yet some Hindus are Trying to Disprove it in Vain.<br />
&#8220;Satya meva Jayate&#8221; Truth alone Trumphs!<br />
