<p>Written by Sulaiman Razvi</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Do mention the link of this blog when you copy any verse</span></strong></p>
<p>You may have heard a lot of Hindus saying that Hinduism is a very peaceful and tolerant religion (or the way of life as they say). Hindus say that unlike other religions (hinting at Islam and Christianity) you will not be punished or put into hell for rejecting the Hindu faith or blaspheming the religion. I was reading the book The Land of the Lingam by Arthur Miles, I read only the first few pages but I found one very interesting observation by Arthur Miles, he wrote,</p>
<p>&#8220;Ask any Hindu to explain his religion, and he will wander off into a labyrinth of words from which nothing will extricate him but the end of your endurance. If you comment on his belief, he will tell you that you do not understand. &#8216;You do not understand&#8217; is always the last word of the Hindu.&#8221;</p>
<p><span id="more-2672"></span></p>
<p>Hindus will first claim that Hinduism is a very tolerant religion and when you show any violent verse from any Hindu scripture he would be startled to read the verse and try to escape the argument, on failing to explain any verse he will claim that Hindus don&#8217;t behead people for the difference in faith. Hindus would very comfortably call Muslims terrorists or being terrorist sympathizers but they turn a blind eye when it comes to Hindu terrorists. Leave aside condemning Hindu terrorism, Hindus don&#8217;t even consider Hindu terror organizations to be terrorists, they call them patriots and social workers and they outrightly deny the existence of Hindu terrorism. No community on the earth glorifies terrorism except the Hindu community. I recommend them to go through <a href="https://vedkabhed.wordpress.com/2013/10/06/how-peaceful-are-hindus/" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">How peaceful are Hindus<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> to know about the violence perpetrated by Hindus. According to the <a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/around-3-400-communal-riots-took-place-from-2016-2020-centre-101648611989880.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Central Government<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, MoS home affairs Nityanand Rai, India witnessed 3,399 cases of communal or religious rioting during the period 2016-2020. India is probably the only country in the world that faces such a large number of communal clashes probably because Hindus are majority in India. There is no communal violence in Mayalsia, Indonesia where Hindus are minority with a Muslim majority population. These two countries are perfect examples because those states have religious diversity like India. Hindus boast about India being a secular state which is the home of over 90% of all Hindus in the world. It&#8217;s quite funny that on the one hand, they boast about India&#8217;s secularism only to portray themselves as champions of secularism which is only for image building, and on the other hand, they dream of establishing Hindu Rashtra (State) via ethnic cleansing or subjugation of minorities. India is secular not because Hindus are majority but because of people like Mahatma Gandhi, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, and Dr. B.R. Ambedkar and all these persons are hated by Hindu extremists, they even want to build Nathuram Godse temple the assassin of Mahatma Gandhi. If majority of Hindus had really been secular, then the right wing would not have thrived in India. Hindu leaders giving hate speech against minorities gets full support from Hindus and no case will be lodged against them. Some Hindu leaders talk about killing Muslims and Christian, some vandalize Mosques and Churches, some talks about raping minority women, some leaders who killed Muslims in riots gets Z+ security, people are lynched for eating beef, some are shot dead for expressing their views on Hinduism, a Hindu leader talks about demolishing Mosques, another one talks about finishing off Islam and Christianity from India by 2022. All these are happening in a secular India, imagine what would&#8217;ve happened to minorities if India had been a Hindu state. Dr. B.R Ambedkar had rightly said,</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p>&#8220;The Hindus claim to be a very tolerant people. In my opinion this is a mistake. On many occasions they can be intolerant and if on some occasions they are tolerant that is because they are too weak to oppose or too indifferent to oppose.&#8221; <a href="http://ccnmtl.columbia.edu/projects/mmt/ambedkar/web/section_11.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #0000ff;">Source</span></strong><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p></blockquote>
<p>When a Muslim man was lynched on rumors that he ate beef, a magazine belonging to a Hindu terror outfit justified the killing by saying that <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Vedas-say-kill-those-who-slaughter-cows-Panchjanya/articleshow/49445823.cms" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Vedas say kill those who slaughter cows<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. The way Hinduism treats its own Shudras reveals whether it is peaceful or violent, not to speak of what it says about other religions, <a href="http://www.thecitizen.in/index.php/OldNewsPage/?Id=1465" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">every 18 minutes a crime is committed against a Dalit<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> and all these have scriptural sanctions. Some Hindus also say that they don&#8217;t use verses from their scripture to justify the killing of non-Hindus. That&#8217;s true because they would&#8217;ve cited verses only if they were familiar with their scriptures. Common Hindus don&#8217;t cite verses from Hindu scriptures because they have never read them. Surely they don&#8217;t cite their scriptures but violence perpetrated on minorities by Hindus is surely inspired by their religion. You will find hundreds of Hindu scholars spewing venom against non Hindus but you will hardly find any who try to foster the relationship between Hindus and non-Hindus. Hindu scholars spewing venom in their Dharm Sansads only proved that Hinduism is violent because Hindu scholars are well acquainted with their texts. Why were people lynched for eating beef and transporting cows if Hindus don&#8217;t believe in their scriptures? Why atrocities against Dalits is rampant if Hindus don&#8217;t get inspiration from their scriptures? When you show something from Hindu scriptures, the Hindu would quickly reply that &#8216;Our religion is not like Islam and Christianity dependent on one book, We believe in whatever we want to and reject whatever we want to, we don&#8217;t need scriptures.&#8217; If Hindus don&#8217;t require Hindu scriptures, then on what basis Babri mosque was demolished? Because it was believed to be the birthplace of a mythological figure called Rama mentioned in Ramayana for which there is no archaeological evidence to prove that he ever existed. Do Hindus directly get revelation from God on how to perform Puja and all, that they don&#8217;t need Hindu scriptures? Well, this is one of the tricks used by Hindus in argument as Hindu scriptures are fallible, they can&#8217;t be defended, Hindus would resort to many such tricks to find an easy route to escape.</p>
<p>When you talk about violence in India, Hindu fanatics will never talk about that rather he will start his whataboutery. And then shamelessly accuse others of being violent. <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/amnesty-annual-report-condemns-growing-intolerance-in-india/" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Amnesty International annual report condemns growing intolerance in India<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, <a href="http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/intolerance-in-india-rose-in-2015-says-uscirf/articleshow/52084719.cms" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">USCIRF report shows religious intolerance rose in India in the year 2015<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. Instead of correcting themselves and stop supporting Hindu hate mongers, Hindus will rather say that &#8216;You first see what&#8217;s happening in so and so country, go and condemn that first&#8217; or else will tell you that &#8216;if you are so uncomfortable in India then leave and go to some other country&#8217;. Such is their hypocrisy. They suddenly develop love for the world when communal violence in India is discussed. If violence is perpetrated by some non-Hindu even in a country far away from India then Hindus will view it as an act of barbarism, religious bigotry and will blame the culprit&#8217;s religion but if the same kind of incident is perpetrated by Hindus then Hindus view it as an act of bravery and would applaud the act, and they would start whataboutery to divert the topic. They would be overwhelmed to hear that a particular number of Muslims have been killed in a particular country but will find no problem going to Christian and Muslim countries to earn their bread and butter. Hindus will insult other religions even if any crime like theft and murder is committed by a non-Hindu, they would drag religion even in such stray crimes (which has nothing to do with religion) but they would never ever say a word against Hinduism when Hindu priests are caught in rape and murder cases, when Dalit is killed, when there is honour killing due to inter-caste marriage, when there is an attack on minority, etc.</p>
<p>Hindus leave no stone unturned in calling other religions violent but are unaware of their own religion. All such violence is inspired by their religious text. Without reading any scripture Hindus would conclude that Hinduism is peaceful, promotes the idea of universal brotherhood and that other religions like Buddhism and Jainism are also accepted. Hindus claim that you can even be an atheist and attain salvation, you will not be put in hell for rejecting Hinduism, etc. All these claims of Hindus shall be refuted in this article. Read the entire article for better understanding as some verses dealing with the same subject are posted in different categories.<a id="top"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a id="intolerance-within-Hinduism"></a>Intolerance within Hindu caste and sect</h2>
<p>Hinduism is perhaps the only religion that divides its believers into castes and sects. There is birth-based discrimination. Hinduism says that people responsible for a mixture of caste will be put into hell fire, Shudra kings in the Kali Yuga will be slain by Kalki avatar, Shudra who takes up the duty of Brahmin will be punished, etc.,</p>
<p>Brahma Purana 106.121 &#8220;There is a hell named Gudapaka. It is full of boiling eddies of treacle and molasses. A man responsible for the mixture in castes is thrown into it. He is burnt therein.&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Some scriptures also say that Kalki will kill Shudra kings and all those people born of mixed castes,</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana 1.2.31.77-84 &#8220;In the previous Svayambhuva Manvantara, he had been born of a part of Madhava (Visnu). For a full period of twenty years, he wandered over the Earth taking with him an army along with horses, chariots and elephants. Surrounded by hundreds and thousands of Brahmanas wielding weapons, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">he killed all the Mlecchas all round along with those kings, the heretics born of Sudra women</span>. The lord exterminates those heretics. Everywhere he kills all those who are not scrupulously religious. The lord who was strong and who annihilated all the Mlecchas <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">slew these also People who were born of parents of different castes, those who depended on them</span>, the Udicyas (Notherners), Madhya Desyas (Persons of middle lands), Parvatiyas (Mountain-dweller), Pracyas (Easterners), Praticyas (Westerners), those who talk about on the ridges of the Vindya mountains, Daksinatyas (Southerners), Dravidas along with Simhalas (Ceylonese), Gandhara, Paradas, Pahlavas, Yavanas, Sakas, Tusaras. Barbaras, Cinas (Chinese), Sulikas, Daradas, Khasas, Lampa-karas, Katakas and different tribes of Kiratas. The powerful lord wielding the discuss slew all these barbarous people.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 11.4.22 &#8220;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">In his incarnation as Buddha, He shall bewilder</span> by his arguments of ahimsa (non-injury) the Daityas performing sacrifices, though not entitled to the performance thereof. Then in the Kali Yuga, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">incarnating himself as Kalki He shall slay the Sudra kings</span>.&#8221; Tr. J.M. Sanyal</p>
<p>Shudras cannot even drink the milk of tawny cow,</p>
<p>Varaha Purana 112.19-21 &#8220;Those (Sudras) who drink (the milk of) Kapila make their forefathers eat the filth in the earth for long. Note what happens to the Sudras who feed on the milk, ghee and butter of the Kapila cows. They go to the terrible hell called Raurava.&#8221; Tr. Venkitasubramonia Iyer</p>
<p>Inter-mingling of Shudras and Brahmanas is evil of Kali Yuga,</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana 1.2.31.41 &#8220;Alliances and associations of the Sudras and Antyayonis (lowest born) with Brahmanas take place in the Kali Yuga, in regard to bed, seats and food stuffs.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Kurma Purana I.30.6 &#8220;In Kaliyuga, the Sudras will have close association with the Brahmanas by the use of spells and incantations as well as through the sharing of beds, seats and food.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Intolerance towards Shudras is briefly explained in articles <a href="https://vedkabhed.wordpress.com/2015/06/05/caste-system-in-hinduism/" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Caste system in Hinduism<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> and <a href="https://vedkabhed.wordpress.com/2015/05/01/manu-smriti-and-untouchables/" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Manu Smriti and Untouchables<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>.</p>
<p><a href="#top" class="broken_link">top</a></p>
<h3><a id="intolerance-sects"></a>Intolerance towards sects</h3>
<p>Hinduism also has sects. Other than dividing people into castes Hinduism also sanctions sects. At present time there are many sects of Hinduism like Lingayat, Arya Samaj, ISKCON, etc. There are mainly two sects in Hinduism Shaivism and Vaishnavism. Shaivites are followers of Shiva and Vaishnavites are followers of Vishnu and his avatars. Shaivite Puranas do recognize Vishnu and his avatars as Gods and Vaishnavite Puranas also recognize Shiva as God. But Shaivite scriptures hail Shiva as the Supreme God and depict Vishnu as a weak god while Vaishnavite scriptures call Vishnu as the Supreme God and humiliate Shiva. There have also been some clashes between these two groups,</p>
<p><a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/on-the-eve-of-kumbh-a-conflict-between-priests-and-sadhus/" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/on-the-eve-of-kumbh-a-conflict-between-priests-and-sadhus/<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>A similar clash happened in the 19<sup>th</sup> century also,</p>
<p>&#8220;At the Kumbh Mela at Ujjain in 1826, a combined army of Vaishnavite warrior-sadhus and Maratha soldiers inflicted a harsh military defeat on the Shaivite sadhus, and ended up plundering their temples and monasteries. Later, while the British put an end to the regular bouts of violence between the warrior-sadhus Shaivites and Vaishnavites, they made separate arrangements for both orders at the Kumbh Melas at Allahabad and Hardwar to prevent bloodshed over which sadhu order should have precedence in bathing in the Ganga.&#8221; The Radical Humanist, Volume 67, by Manabendra Nath Roy, p.13 also mentioned by Yoginder Sikand <a href="http://www.islamicvoice.com/january.98/FEAT1.HTM" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">http://www.islamicvoice.com/january.98/FEAT1.HTM<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>Visit by naga sadhus at Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams leads to ‘suddhi’<br />
<a href="http://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/current-affairs/160717/visit-by-naga-sadhus-leads-to-suddhi.html" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">http://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/current-affairs/160717/visit-by-naga-sadhus-leads-to-suddhi.html<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>In Tamil Nadu two groups of Vaishnavite Hindus namely Vadakalai and Thenkalai fought each after a dispute over whether to hold prayer in Sanskrit or Tamil <a href="https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/vadakalai-and-thenkalai-iyengars-come-blows-again-over-sanskrit-vs-tamil-prayer-102453" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/vadakalai-and-thenkalai-iyengars-come-blows-again-over-sanskrit-vs-tamil-prayer-102453<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>Although both these sects co-exist today but there seems to have a tiff between them in the scriptures. There is a battle of supremacy in both Shaivite and Vaishnavite scriptures. Shaivite scriptures show that Vishnu and his avatars worshiped Shiva,</p>
<p>Linga Purana Section I, 98.159-162 &#8220;Suta said: Thus he eulogised the bull-bannered lord with his thousand names. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The lord (i.e. Visnu) bathed Siva and worshipped him with lotus flowers. In order to test Visnu</span>, Mahesvara the lord of the worlds hid one of the lotus flowers intended for the worship. Visnu from whom the flowers was taken away thought thus, &#8216;What is this?&#8217; <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">After realising thee loss of the flower Visnu plucked out his eye and devoutly worshipped the preceptor of the universe</span>, the support of all beings. He worshipped him repeating the last name of the lord.&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a Linga Purana story to show Shiva&#8217;s superiority over Vishnu. Another story shows that the Sudarshana Chakra (Discus) which Vishnu wielded was actually given by Shiva as a boon to Vishnu after Vishnu rigorously worshiped Shiva,</p>
<p>Linga Purana Section I.98.1-3 &#8220;The sages said: O Suta, how was the discus Sudarsana acquired from Mahesvara, the lord of Devas, by lord Visnu? It behoves you to recount it. Suta said: A terrible fight ensued between Devas and the leading Asuras causing destruction to all living beings. On being pierced and hit by lances, iron clubs, javelins and arrows of bent knots Devas became extremely terrified and fled. [18-26] <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Lord Visnu said: O Devas, I shall approach lord Siva now along with all the eternal Devas and shall carry out your task in full</span>. O Devas, after acquiring the discus, formerly made by the slayer of the Tripuras in order to kill Jalandhara, I shall kill all the six thousand eight hundred great Asuras and Daityas beginning with Dhundhu&#8230;Suta said: After saying this to the excellent Devas, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Visnu, the excellent one among Devas, remembered lord Siva worshipped him</span>. On the splendid summit of the Himavan he duly installed the Linga that resembled the mountain Meru. It had been made by Visvakarman. Repeating the hymn called Tvarita-Rudra and the Rudrasukta he bathed the Linga and worshipped it with scents. It was charming in its flame-like form. He eulogised Rudra; worshipped him in the fire and bowed down to him. Repeating the thousand names in order he worshipped lord Siva&#8230; [169-170] <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Glancing lovingly at Visnu who stood aside with palms joined in reverence, Sankara, Mahadeva said </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">smilingly. O Visnu, the task of Devas has been well understood by me. I shall give you the splendid discuss Sudarsana</span>.&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>This is how Shaivite Purana shows Shiva as the supreme god. Another Shaivite scripture says that,</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Kotirudrasamhita 4.27.35-42 &#8220;Gautama said:- You are evil-minded desiring to put me in distress as I am a devotee of Siva. Hence you shall be averse to the Vedas always. Henceforth your faith in the rites of the Vedas, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">particularly with reference to the path of Siva yielding salvation shall cease to exist&#8230;fall, ye all, deep into the hell</span>&#8230;You will not have Siva as your sole deity. You will be considering the matchless Siva on a par with other gods&#8230;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">All your descendants-sons, grandsons and other, O brahmins, shall be non-Saivites. You shall stay certainly in hell along with your sons.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</span></p>
<p>These verses are implying that being a Shaivite alone can bring you salvation and being non-Shaivite will lead you to hell. A story also shows that Vaishnavite were averse to Shiva,</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Rudrasamhita 2, Parvatikhanda III.33.5-6 &#8220;Now, a certain brahmin professing Vaisnava cult came here and spoke very critically about Siva. Ever since, the mother of Parvati has gone out of sense. Hence she does not wish her daughter&#8217;s marriage with Siva.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Another verse from Shiva Purana says that only those sons who are Shaivite shall receive the inheritance,</p>
<p>Shiva Purana Vayaviyasamhita 6, section II.39.58-60 &#8220;&#8230;The descendant shall propitiate devotees. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Only a devotee of Siva shall inherit his wealth</span>. If his children are not initiated in Saivite cult the wealth shall be handed over the Siva. No child shall take it.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Contrary to those Shaivite verses other Puranas (mostly Vaishnavite) praise Vaishnavism and hail Vishnu as the supreme god, Sage Narada said,</p>
<p>Garuda Purana I.99.6-7 &#8220;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The following should not be entertained</span>. A sickly person, a person deficient in limbs or having additional appendages, a one-eyed man, son of a widow after remarriage, a fallen sinner like Avakirna and those who do not conform to conventions, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">and a a-Vaisnava (non-believer in Visnu). These are not worthy of being invited for Sraddha</span>. They (the deserving brahmins) shall be invited the day before when they shall observe celibacy.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Skanda Purana II.ii.10.120-1 &#8220;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">(As opposed to these) Avaisnavas (&#8216;non-devotees of Visnu&#8217;) hate auspicious conduct of (other) men</span>. They themselves indulge in evil conduct and evil thoughts in the minds. They are undisturbed even if great misfortune befalls them. They take delight in sexual enjoyment. Those Avaisnavas are inebriated. They do not resort to the Lord even for a moment, although he is the cause of supreme happiness and is present in the lotus of the heart. They always cover up the names of Hari by means of aimless, worthless and futile network of words&#8230;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Indeed those devoid of devotion to Visnu are human brutes</span>.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">One who blasphemes a Vaisnava cannot be protected by anyone. Even if a person is as strong as Lord Siva</span>, if he blasphemes a Vaisnava, he is sure to be destroyed. This is the verdict of all sastras. If one does not care for the verdict of the sastras and dares blaspheme a Vaisnava, he suffers life after life because of this.&#8221; <strong>Chaitanya Bhagavata Madhya 22 by Vrindavana Dasa Thakura, Tr. Swami Prabhupada</strong></p>
<p>A Purana even says that one should not reside in a kingdom where the king is not a Vaishnavite,</p>
<p>Skanda Purana II.v.11.23-24 &#8220;Bharadvaja said: Well asked, O highly fortunate one, since you are a devotee of Visnu. The earth that you protect, O king, is blessed. The subjects (governed by you) are good (blessed). One shall not stay in that kingdom where the king is not a Vaisnava. Better to stay in a forest or in a Tirtha but not in a realm where there are no Vaisnavas.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Vaishnavite scripture suggests that sage Bhrigu was a Vaishnavite, sage Bhrigu curses followers of Shiva in the following way at a particular incident,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 4.2.28-29 &#8220;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">One who takes a vow to satisfy Lord Śiva or who follows such principles will certainly become an atheist and be diverted from transcendental scriptural injunctions</span>. Those who vow to worship Lord Śiva are so foolish that they imitate him by keeping long hair on their heads. When initiated into worship of Lord Śiva, they prefer to live on wine, flesh and other such things. Bhṛgu Muni continued: Since you blaspheme the Vedas and the brāhmaṇas, who are followers of the Vedic principles, it is understood that you have already taken shelter of the doctrine of atheism.&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p><strong>Swami Prabhupada writes:</strong> &#8220;It is sometimes seen that devotees of Lord Śiva imitate the characteristics of Lord Śiva. For example, Lord Śiva drank an ocean of poison, so some of the followers of Lord Śiva imitate him and try to take intoxicants like gāñjā (marijuana). Here the curse is that if someone follows such principles he must become an infidel and turn against the principles of Vedic regulation. It is said that such devotees of Lord Śiva will be sac-chāstra-paripanthinaḥ, which means &#8220;opposed to the conclusion of śāstra, or scripture.&#8217;…&#8221; <strong>Swami Prabhupada on Srimad Bhagavatam 4.2.28 </strong><a href="http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_4.2.28" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right"><span style="color: #000000;">http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_4.2.28</span><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>Swami Prabhupada also writes,</p>
<p>&#8220;Lord Śiva&#8217;s symptoms of austerity are not exactly those of a Vaiṣṇava. Lord Śiva is certainly the number one Vaiṣṇava, but he exhibits a feature for a particular class of men who cannot follow the Vaiṣṇava principles. The Śaivites, the devotees of Lord Śiva, generally dress like Lord Śiva, and sometimes they indulge in smoking and taking intoxicants. Such practices are never accepted by the followers of Vaiṣṇava rituals.&#8221; <strong>Swami Prabhupada on Srimad Bhagavatam 4.6.36. </strong><a href="http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_4.6.36" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_4.6.36<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>Many Hindus were offended when a guy impersonated Shiva in the movie P.K and ran fearing his life, Hindus who were offended by this attacked theatres and called for a boycott of the film and upcoming films of the lead actor. I am wondering if they will tear and burn up this scripture in which Shiva is depicted in such a humiliating way. The story says that a fight between Shiva and Krishna erupted and Krishna defeated Shiva. Shiva was so scared of Krishna&#8217;s fiery that he ran away in fear and hid in a mountain.</p>
<p>Skanda Purana II.ii.12.14-18 &#8220;&#8230;Nila mountain is in the third Yojana (i.e. 3X12 Kms.). This is the holy spot of the Lord of Gauri named Ekamrakavana. Not far off, O king, is the place where, being afraid, he sought refuge. Indradyumna said: Why was the Lord of Gauri (Siva) frightened? With whom did he seek refuge?&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a Shaivite Purana but according to the translator, this is invented by Vaishnavites to show Krishna&#8217;s superiority. The translator Ganesh Vasudeo Tagare wrote,</p>
<p>&#8220;A Vaisnavite twist to show the inferiority of Siva to Visnu. The fight between Siva and Visnu for one king of Kasi (Kasiraja) and the subsequent defeat of Siva and his praise of Visnu and Siva&#8217;s departure from Varanis to Ekamra Vana (vv50-79)-all this is invented to show Visnu&#8217;s superiority.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although Skanda Purana is a Shaivite Purana but it may have also been composed by Vaishnavites that&#8217;s why there are many verses praising Vishnu and ridiculing Shiva as G.V. Tagare rightly points out. The war between Shiva and Krishna/Vishnu is explained briefly in <a href="#fighting-eachother" class="broken_link">God fighting each other</a> category. Shiva helps his devotee to fight Krishna/Vishnu and he is humiliated in the following way,</p>
<p>Skanda Purana II.ii.12.81-85a &#8220;Mahadeva said: O lord of Devas&#8230;carrying out your behest will be the cause of my welfare, O lord of the worlds. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">On account of my stupidity, I Lord, I had been arrogant. There, O Lord, your own blessing is the cause of my fickleness</span>. Since you command me, O Lord of Devas, to proceed to Purusottama, I shall carry out your behest reverently and proceed to the auspicious holy place that bestows salvation. Do a favour to me and promise that you alone will protect and sustain my sacred region Purusottama&#8230;&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>This is also explained in<a href="#fighting-eachother" class="broken_link"> Gods fighting each other</a> category. Just like this verse, Vishnu is also ridiculed in a Shaivite Purana,</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Satarudra Samhita 3.23.13-16 &#8220;When his pride fell off, Visnu was dejected, and dispirited. He then realised that Siva was sporting about in the form of a bull. Then on realising that Siva himself had come in the form of a Bull, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Visnu spoke in a shrill voice with drooping shoulders and palms joined in reverence</span>. Visnu said: O lord of the gods, O ocean of mercy, O lord Siva, I had been deluded by your Maya and my mind had been confused. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">O lord, I fought with you, Siva. Taking pity on me, O lord, let this offence be excused</span>.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>

<h3><a id="kapalika"></a>Kapalika</h3>
<p>Kapalika was Shaivite sect. The Aghori Sadhus are an offshoot of this sect. Followers of Kapalika sect used human skull as a begging bowl and also used to eat food from it, they applied ashes from crematorium and had many such weird practices. Kapalika sect has gone extinct but we can get a sense of their belief from Aghoris which is an offshoot of Kapalika. You can understand it better by looking at the following graph taken from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kapalika" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Wikipedia<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shiva is said to be a Kapalin himself,</p>
<p>Skanda Purana V.iii.214.2-3 &#8220;The lord wandered over the earth as a Kapalin (holder of a skull) wearing patched garments. He was surrounded by Pisacas, Raksasas, Dakinis, and Yoginis. He assumed the form of Bhairava and resorted to a cremation ground where he performed an elaborate penance causing freedom from fear to all the three worlds&#8230;&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Shiva Purana Ruda-Samhita 2, Satikhanda section II.27.22 &#8220;Daksa, the evil-minded, did not invite Siva for that sacrifice, deciding that He was not worthy of taking part in the sacrifice because he was a Kapalin.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>In Varaha Purana 97.1 Shiva is infuriated when Brahma calls him Kapalin. I have mentioned this verse in <a href="#fighting-eachother" class="broken_link"><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #0000ff;">Gods fighting each other</span></a> category.</p>
<p>Kapalikas are praised,</p>
<p>Skanda Purana I.iii.(P).8.76-80 &#8220;May the eminent sages staying in them protect the system of the worship of Siva. The devotees of Siva and the Pasupatas shall beg for alms (for their sustenance). Let these and the others of Yogic power and practice, as well as the Kapalikas always protect this holy spot. All the kings of past, present and future shall protect this spot without any disobedience to their commands&#8230;&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Rishi Upamanyu praises Kapalins,</p>
<p>Shiva Purana Vayaviyasamhita 6, Section II, 31.173-4 &#8220;[Upamanya said] The followers of Siva who adhere to the philosophical path, those who perform <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">the Pasupata rites those who observe holy rites and the Saivite holy men such as Kapalikas</span>-all these are adherents and executors of Siva&#8217;s behests. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">They shall be worshipped by me at the behest of Siva. May these bless me</span>. Let them praise the successful holy rite.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Kapalika Vrata prescribed by Shiva in general,</p>
<p>Skanda Purana V.i.6.84-94 &#8220;&#8230;[Shiva said] O sinless Devas, since I came over here it is called Mahakalavana. To you also who wished to perform austerities, it is Mahakalavana (forest of great opportunity). This secret holy shrine will become renowned in the world with this twin name. It is a secret forest. It is the cremation ground. It is the greatest and most majestic of all holy spots. This Kalavrtacarya (performace of Kapala Vrata) has been proclaimed by me. The devotee embellished with Kapala Vrata should take food in the Kapala (skull). The Kapala should always be held in the hand. He should be contented with the alms thus received in the course of his Vrata. He should (outwardly) adopt terrific features and reside in the cremation ground&#8230;He should adorn all limbs with holy ash&#8230; Formerly I too had adopted the Kapala Vrata and practised it. Kapala is the greatest of all secrets, holy and destructive of sins…[96] If out of delusion any man hates this Mahavrata, he will be overpowered by sins. Even after hundreds and crores of births, he is not rid of that sin. Hence no one should hate or violate it&#8230;&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Kapalika sect and other Shaivite sects are condemned in Vaishnavite Purana and Shaktism and even say that Shiva created these sects to delude people,</p>
<p>Srimad Devi Bhagavatam 7.39.21-30 &#8220;…The S&#8217;âstras that are extant, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">as contrary to the S&#8217;rutis and Smritis, are all Tâmasa S&#8217;âstras</span>, Mahâdeva has framed these Vâma, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Kâpâlak, Kaulaks, Bhairava</span> and such like S&#8217;astras for fascinating the people; else he has no object in framing them…&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Varaha Purana 174.42-42 &#8220;The Brahmana said: He who dies with the food given by a Sudra within him, becomes ghost. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">By mere contact of, not to say sitting together or eating with, Nagas (a naked sect), Kapalikas or Pasandas, one becomes a ghost</span>.&#8221; Tr. Venkitasubramonia Iyer, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Kurma Purana II.39.56-62 &#8220;Indeed the holy Pasupata vow has been formerly designed by me for the achievement of liberation. It is the greatest of all secrets. It is the subtlest essence of the Vedas. One who performs Pasupataa vow, shall be quiescent; he must have perfect self-control; he should dust his body with sacred ashes; he should observe celibacy and remain naked. Or he should wear a loin-cloth or a single garment; he should be silent and engaged in the study of Vedas. The scholar shall meditate on Siva as Pasupati. Sruti states that this Pasupata Yoga should be resorted by the seekers of liberation; that those who maintain Pasupata rite should be free from desire&#8230;There are other scriptures opposed to the Vedic view. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">They have been propounded by me alone and they are very fascinating in this world. Those cults are Vama, Pasupata</span>, the Soma cult, the Lakura (Lakula) and the Bhairava and such other cults which are opposed to Veda should not be resorted to.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Kurma Purana II.16.15 &#8220;One should not even verbally revere and honour the heretics, those who indulge in wrong actions, those who perform black magic, the Pancaratras and the Pasupatas.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>There is another Shaivite sect called Nakula which is also condemned in Vaishnavite Purana. A story in Kurma Purana says that Shiva urged Vishnu to create scriptures for deluding the sinners, on being urged by Shiva, Vishnu creates it and he then urges Shiva to also create some deluding cults. Urged by Vishnu, Shiva creates some sects which include Kapalika, Pasupata, and Nakula as mentioned in this Vaishnavite Purana in an effort to declare these Shaivite sects as deceitful and heretic sects,</p>
<p>Kurma Purana I.16.117-9 &#8220;Hence, O bull-bannered lord, we shall compose scriptures for deluding the sinners and for saving those who are out of the pale of the Vedas.&#8217; Thus addressed by Visnu, the slayer of Mura, Rudra composed deluding Scriptures and Kesava too did the same, on being urged by Siva. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">They were the treatises of the cults of Kapala, Nakula, Vama, Bhairava, both of Western and Eastern variety. Pancaratra, Pasupata and thousands of other cults as well</span>.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Ganesh Vasudeo Tagare writes &#8220;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The list shows what sects were regarded as being out of the pale of Vedic religion in KP. Out of these, Kapalas, or Kapalikas whether Brahminic or non-Brahminic</span>, ate and drank in human skulls, wore garlands of skulls and indulged in horrid practices of wine-drinking, in sexual orgies and living in unclean manner (S.N. Dasgupta Ind. Phil. V.P.2, 3). <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Nakulas are the followers of Nakula or Lakulisa, a semi-historical founder of a sect of Saivism. In the Vayu P.23.2.17-23 and the LO.I.24, he is said to be an incarnation of Siva</span> in a cemetry and Kayavarohana in Bhrgu ksetra, in Dabhoi Tehsil in Gujarat. Vama is a general term for the (Sakta?) observers of socially disapproved practices, the group being designated as Five Ma-karas. Bhairavas are also Saivites who worshipped Bhairava form of Siva. Bhairava-worship has been very popular among the masses in Maharashtra. Pancaratras, the Vasudeva worshippers who were later accommodated by the followers of Veda, held the famous Catur-vyuha (the four manifestations of Vasudeva) doctrine and had their own way of worship, are quite famous. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Pasupatas are the followers of system founded by Umapati Srikantha (or Siva) and they are mentioned in Mbh. Santi. 337.62</span>&#8230;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kurma Purana II.39.56-62 &#8220;Indeed the holy Pasupata vow has been formerly designed by me for the achievement of liberation. It is the greatest of all secrets. It is the subtlest essence of the Vedas. One who performs Pasupataa vow, shall be quiescent; he must have perfect self-control; he should dust his body with sacred ashes; he should observe celibacy and remain naked.

Those cults are Vama, Pasupata, the Soma cult, the Lakura (Lakula) and the Bhairava and such other cults which are opposed to Veda should not be resorted to</span>.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Just like Vaishvanite distortion of the Shaivite Skanda Purana II.ii.12.14-18, a Linga Purana verse may have also been twisted by Vaishnavite where Indra says,</p>
<p>Linga Purana Section I.40.38-39 &#8220;People overwhelmed by misery will never see the maximum span of life of hundred years. In Kali all the Vedas will not be available. Yajnas perish afflicted by people of no virtue. Ochre-robed and naked anchorites will be wandering and many Kapalikas (ascetics holding skulls as their begging bowls) will infest the territories.&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Vayu Purana a Vaishnavite Purana condemns Kapalikas and other religions also,</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.58.64-66 &#8220;Yajnas are forsaken when Dharma receives a setback. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">There will be many types of heretics like wearers of ochre-coloured robes (Buddhists), Jainas and Kapalikas (skull bearing mendicants)</span>. There will be sellers of the Vedas and the sacred places. Heretics antagonistic to the discipline and arrangement of different castes and stages of life will be born. When Kali Yuga sets in, the Vedas will not be studied. Sudras will be experts and authorities in the affairs of Dharma.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Shaivite Puranas says Shiva was a Kapalika, and he recommended the Kapalika Vrata, Kapalikas are praised in Shaivite Puranas but Vaishnavite Puranas says that Shiva created Kapalika and other Shaivite sects to delude the sinners. It&#8217;s clear proof that Vaishnavite text wants to demonize Shaivite sects. Shaivite sects are even called heretic sects in Vaishnavite Puranas. Read verses in <a href="#intolerance-buddhists">Intolerance towards Buddhism</a> and <a href="#intolerance-jainism" class="broken_link">Jainism</a> category in which Kapalika sect are condemned by Vaishnavite Puranas. The worship of Shivlingam is condemned in Vedas. Shiva was the local deity of India who was later assimilated in the Vedic religion by Aryans.

<h3><a id="others"></a>Others</h3>
<p>There is a conflict between Hindu sects, one sect accuses the other of not following Vedas properly,</p>
<p>Swami Prabhupada the founder of ISKCON and also a follower of Gaudiya Vaishnavism writes on Arya Samaj,</p>
<p>&#8220;Those who are Āryans strictly follow the Vedic principles, but in this age of Kali a community has sprung up known as the ārya-samāja, which is ignorant of the import of the Vedas in the paramparā system. Their leaders decry all bona fide ācāryas, and they pose themselves as the real followers of the Vedic principles. These ācāryas who do not follow the Vedic principles are presently known as the ārya-samājas…&#8221; <strong>Swami Prabhupada on Srimad Bhagavatam 5.15.1</strong> <a href="http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_5.15.1" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_5.15.1<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>Swami Prabhupada on Ramakrishna mission,</p>
<p>&#8220;So you take any means, the Ramakrishna Mission also says like that. Yata mata tata patha. &#8220;You can worship brahma-varcasa, you can worship Devī-māyā; you can worship Vasūn; you can worship Rudra; you can worship anyone; ultimately, you become one with the Supreme.&#8221; Most misguiding. Here it is&#8230; But if you want this particular thing, then you worship this. In the Bhagavad-gītā also, it is confirmed, yānti deva-vratā devān pitṟn yānti pitṛ-vratāḥ (BG 9.25).<br />
You will find, rascal gurus, they are preaching like that, that &#8220;Whatever you do, it is all right.&#8221; There is a big mission, they say also that yata mat tata patha. &#8220;Whatever you have manufactured, the way of salvation, that&#8217;s all right.&#8221;<br />

<p>Founder of Arya Samaj Swami Dayanand Saraswati writes on Puranik (orthodox) Hindus who worship idols. Puranik Hindus constitute the majority of the Hindu population,</p>
<p>&#8220;Fie on you! O you senseless, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">idiotic author of the Bhagvat Puranana. What a shameless creature you were!</span> You did not feel a bit of shame or hesitation in writing such falsehood! You became so utterly blind.&#8221; <strong>by Swami Dayanand Saraswati, Satyarth Prakash, Ch 11, page 407, Tr.

<p>He also wrote,</p>
<p>&#8220;A Shaiva is really one who worships Shiva &#8211; the All merciful Being; a Vaishnava is one who worships Vishnu &#8211; the All-pervading God. A Ganpata is one who worships Ganpati &#8211; The Lord of Hosts i.e., (of the Universe); Bhagvata is one who sits at the feet of the muses. A Saurka is one who is the devotee of the All-pervading God, the Soul of the Universe &#8211; animate and inanimate. Thus Rudra, shiva, Vishnu, Ganapati, Surya, connote God, and Bhagvati connotes truthful speech. These various Puranic texts were invented owing to the wrong interpretation of the Vedic texts (quoted above)… likewise the Shivites, Shaktas, Vaishnavites and the like revile one another, because they are ignorant of the true meanings of the words Shiva, Rudra, Vishnu, etc., which, as is set forth in the first chapter of this book, are the different names of the Immutable God Who is Self-existent, All-wise and Blissful. These men of little understanding do not use their brains and never give the least thought to the matter, otherwise they will soon find out that all such terms as Shiva, Rudra, and Vishnu connote One Supreme, Incomparable&lt; Omniscient God, the Controller of the universe, on account of His possessing multitudinous attributes. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Would not the wrath of God descend on such people</span>?&#8221; By Swami Dayanand Saraswati, Satyarth Prakash, Ch 11, page 366-7, Tr. Chiranjiva Bhardwaja</p>
<p>Clashes between Hindu sects still exist. A clash broke out between Arya Samajis and followers of Sant Rampal because Arya Samajis who abuse other religions were offended by the &#8216;Derogatory&#8217; remarks made on Dayanand Saraswati by Sant Rampal. Another clash had erupted between these two groups over the handling of Ashram.</p>

<h2><a id="intolerance-towards-religions"></a>Intolerance towards other religions</h2>
<p>Now this one is really an interesting topic that would expose those Hindus who claim that Hinduism tolerates other religions. Hindus claim that Buddhism and Jainism are sects of Hinduism. And that both share the same values and teachings. It&#8217;s quite funny to hear from Hindus that Hinduism tolerates other religions when it doesn&#8217;t even tolerate its own Shudra. Shudras are not even considered Aryas, they are called Anaryas (Non-Aryans), non-Hindus in Hindu scripture, and works of scholars are called with slang terms like Maleccha (Barbarian/foreigner), Yavana who are considered to be viler than Chandalas, etc. Can such religion really preach tolerance?</p>

We will be considered winners even if 20 lakh of their population is killed.” Anand Swaroop, head of a body named the Shankaracharya Parishad sought to threaten hotels in Haridwar against holding Christmas celebrations on 25 December, he also vowed not to allow Eid celebrations, “It’s a norm since 1915 that non-Hindu religious functions cannot be held in Haridwar, acknowledged as a pilgrimage city of Hindus. We have written to nearly 300 hotels that they should not entertain Christmas celebrations at their places on 25 December. If they do, they will have to face the consequences.” Seer Sindhu Sagar called on “rich Hindu villagers” to “buy all Muslim properties and keep the village free of the minority population”. “Harass them to the extent that they are forced to sell off their houses. I have arrested more than 10 Muslims on false charges under the SC/ST Act.” Swami Prabodhanand said, “Just like Myanmar, the police, the army and every Hindu must pick up arms and organise a cleansing [of Muslims…We have no other choice.” Another speaker, Sadhvi Annapurna or Pooja Shakun Pandey <a href="https://twitter.com/zoo_bear/status/1473581283242491904" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">repeated<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> the call for genocide: “If you want to finish off their population then we are ready to kill them.

<p>I have mentioned only those Hindu scholars who made it to the news, there are many more Hindu scholars who comment against Islam and Muslims on social media, and they pass Islamophobic remarks in their religious events. So much is the hatred for Muslims by Hindu scholars because this is what Hinduism teaches them. This is not something new, Hindus have been giving hate speeches and persecuting non-Hindus for centuries, this hatred was directed towards Buddhism and Jainism in ancient India when Buddhism and Jainism flourished in India and the responsibility of giving hate speeches against them was taken up by Hindu scholars like Adi Shankaracharya, Kumarila Bhatta, Basava, etc., and now they are targeting Muslims because Islam is the second-largest religion in India so Hindus want to wipe out the Muslim community in India.</p>

<h2><a id="intolerance-buddhists"></a>Intolerance towards Buddhists</h2>
<p>In the 2nd century BC, <a href="https://scroll.in/article/774518/a-brief-history-of-religious-intolerance-in-india" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Patanjali<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> tells us that the relationship between Brahmins and Buddhists is like that between the snake and the mongoose. <a href="https://vedkabhed.wordpress.com/2014/05/14/mulshankar-on-jainism-and-buddhism/" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Swami Dayanand Saraswati<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> criticized Buddhism in his book Satyarth Prakash, Adi Shankaracharya criticized Buddhist scriptures and used abhorrent words for Buddha,</p>
<p>Brahma Sutra 2.2.32 &#8220;To be brief, from every point of view that this Buddhist doctrine may be examined for finding out some justification, it breaks down like a well sunk in sand; and we do not find any least logic here. Hence also all behaviour based on the Buddhist scripture is unjustifiable. Moreover, Buddha exposed his own incoherence in talk when he instructed the three mutually contradictory theories of the existence of eternal objects, existence of consciousness, and absolute nihilism; or he showed his malevolence towards all creatures, acting under the delusion that these creatures would get confused by imbibing contradictory views. The idea is that the Buddhist view should be abjured in every way by all those who desire the highest good.&#8221; Tr. Swami Gambhirananda</p>
<p>Jaimini wrote about Buddhist scriptures,</p>
<p>Purva Mimansa Sutra of Jaimini, Pada 3, verse 14, Adhikarana VII (b) &#8220;With regard to the non-Vedic scriptures of the Bauddha, &amp;c., the Purvapaksa is that, &#8216;inasmuch as these are as much scriptures of actions as the Veda, their authoritative character cannot be denied. The eternal and authoritative character of these scriptures can be proved by the same arguments that have been put forward in support of the eternality of the Veda.&#8217;<br />
The Siddhanta is that, inasmuch as these other scriptures are acknowledged to have been the work of human authors, they cannot be accepted to be possessed of infallible authority. They they are not eternal is proved by their having been compiled by human authors; and also by the absence in those so called &#8216;scriptures&#8217; of all regularity; that is to say, they are found to be full of incorrect words and phrases&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Pandit Ganganath Jha</p>
<p>Kumarila Bhatta wrote about Buddhist scriptures,</p>
<p>Tantra Vartika, Adhyaya 1, Pada III, Adhi (7d) &#8220;&#8230;Thus, then, we conclude that on account of their being composed of incorrect words and expressions, the scriptures of the Bauddha, &amp;c., can never be held to be either a Veda, or an eternal scripture&#8230;Nor can these scriptures be held to be eternal, because there is a clean remembrance of their authors (Buddha, and others) And hence in matters relating to Dharma, which is amenable only to an eternal scriptures (as proved under Sutra I-1-2), we cannot admit of the independent authority of the Bauddha scriptures.&#8221; Tr. Pandit Ganganath Jha</p>
<p>Hindus claim that Buddhism is part of Hinduism. That Buddha was an avatar of Vishnu. An Indologist said that Buddha was considered an avatar of Vishnu only to convert the Buddhists to Hinduism. A Dalit scholar writes,</p>
<p>&#8220;Declaring the Buddha as ninth avatara of Vishnu, by the Brahmanic Puranas, was meant to cause confusion in the minds of people with the result that Buddhism came to be treated as a &#8220;heretical&#8221; and &#8220;aesthetic&#8221; branch of Brahmanism&#8221; <a href="http://www.ambedkar.org/books/dob15.htm" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">http://www.ambedkar.org/books/dob15.htm<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>As per Hindu texts and scholars. Buddha rejected Vedas and established anti-Vedic philosophy to stop the animal sacrifice. Some Hindu scholars say that people during Buddha&#8217;s time were engaged in animal sacrifice because they lived on the wrong interpretation of Vedas and that the Vedas do not sanction animal killing. My question is if people during Buddha&#8217;s time misinterpreted the Vedas then why the avatar of Vishnu establish anti-Vedic, atheistic philosophy? Why didn&#8217;t he just revive the Vedas? Why wasn&#8217;t he born as the revivalist of Hinduism?</p>
<p>Hindus would very happily tell you that Buddha was an avatar of Vishnu but they will never tell you the truth about this avatar. According to Hindu scriptures, Vishnu didn&#8217;t incarnate as Buddha to guide people to the right path or to teach them Vedas, Vishnu incarnated as Buddha to delude people by establishing a false religion called Buddhism. Hindu scripture says that to delude the sinners and demons and to defeat the demons Vishnu incarnated as Buddha and made all the demons accept Buddhism who would continue to spread this religion. Hindu text explicitly says that Buddhism is a false religion,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 2.7.37 &#8220;Asuras, the enemies of the celestials, became proficient in the knowledge of the Vedas, and having got made by Mayadanaba (an Asura of that name) and invisible city of velocity, engaged themselves in the destruction of the people. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Thereupon the glorious God incarnated Himself as Buddha, and with a view to bring about a confusion of their understanding and to create avarice in them taught them many false religions</span> in the guise of a Pashanda (one setting the true religious texts at naught).&#8221; Tr. J.M. Sanyal</p>
<p>Padma Purana VI.252.108-115 &#8220;&#8230;The glorious one, taking up the form of Buddha, deluded his enemies. Those who were deluded by that teaching gave up all religious practices&#8230;.&#8221; Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p>Garuda Purana 3.15.26 &#8220;Then in Kali age, the Lord was born in the Kikata [modern Bihar] as Buddha. He deluded the asuras and flouted the Vedas.&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Agni Purana 16.1-5 &#8220;Agni said:- I will now describe the Buddha incarnation&#8230;Formerly in the war between gods and demons the former were defeated by the latter. Saying &#8216;Save us, Save us!&#8217; they sought refuge with Iswara. Being incarnation of illusion and infatuation he was born as the son of Suddhodana. He infatuated the Daityas and made them relinquish the religion of the Veda. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">They then became followers of Buddha and induced others to forsake Vedic religion</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">He became Arhata and afterwards made others Arhatas</span>. Divorced from Vedic religion they became all Pashandinas [Irreligious people]. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">They committed (sinful) deeds capable of taking one to hell and received (gifts) from degraded persons</span>&#8230;&#8221; Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>It&#8217;s mentioned in Bhagavad Purana,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 1.3.24 &#8220;Then, in the beginning of Kali-yuga, the Lord will appear as Lord Buddha, the son of Añjanā, in the province of Gayā, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">just for the purpose of deluding those who are envious of the faithful theist</span>.&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 4.19.24-25 &#8220;In this way while carrying away the hose with the intention of interrupting Prthu&#8217;s sacrificce, Indra assumed and abandoned deceitful disguise of <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">nude ascetics (Digamabara Jainas), red-robed ascetics (Buddhists)</span> and others (such as Kapalakas). Minds of men, through their misapprehension (of the true teachings of the Vedas), <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">are </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">generally attracted to these pseudo-religious sects as the true religion</span>, as they are charmingly presented with excellent eloquence.&#8221; Tr.

<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 4.19.23-25 &#8220;All the forms that Indra assumed for the purpose of stealing the sacrificial horse in disguised form are therefore considered to be vile and generally adopted by persons known as Pashandas. The guises so assumed and cast off by Indra for the purpose of stealing the horse with a view to thwarting the performance of Prithu&#8217;s sacrifice have been the cause of unreligious creeds as professed by Jainas, Buddhas, and Kapalikas. Although such forms faith differ widely from the true religion or truth, they attracted the attention of the people. Such creeds in view of their intelligent arguments prove apparently charming to weak minds.&#8221; Tr. J.N. Sanyal</p>
<p>Ironically, verse 14 of this chapter states that Indra assumed the form of a Hindu saint, but that form is not listed here among Pashandas (Heretics), these verses also dub Jainism, Buddhism, and Kapalika sect as false religions. The Sanskrit word mentioned here for Buddhists is rakta pata which means red-robed, As Buddhist monks don red robes, it&#8217;s an expression used in Hindu scriptures to refer to Buddhists, Sanskrit word for Jain is Nagna which means naked referring to Digambara Jains. Upadharmesu is translated as towards false religions. The above verses are trying to say that Buddhism and Jainism are false religions and people are attracted to these sects as true religions. Gautama Rishi curses the Brahmins who oppressed him in the following way,</p>
<p>Srimad Devi Bhagavatam 12.9.63-81 &#8220;O vile Brâhma<span style="text-decoration: underline;">n</span>as! You will be always averse to see the festivals of S&#8217;iva, to worship S&#8217;iva, to Rudrâk<span style="text-decoration: underline;">s</span>a, to the Bel leaves, and to the holy Bha<span style="text-decoration: underline;">s</span>ma (ashes). You will be wholly indifferent to practise the right ways of living as presented in the Vedas and Smritis, to preserve your conduct good and to observe the path of knowledge to Advaita Jñânam, to practise restraint of senses and continence, to the daily practices of Sandhyâ Bandanam, to performing the Agnihotra ceremonies, to the study of the Vedas according to one&#8217;s own S&#8217;âkhâ or to the daily studies thereof as to teach those things or to give, as gifts, cows, etc., or to perform the S&#8217;râddhas of the fathers, etc., or to perform Krichchra Chândrâya<span style="text-decoration: underline;">n</span>a and other penances. O Vile Brâhma<span style="text-decoration: underline;">n</span>as! As you are ready to do these mean things, you will have to suffer for this that you will desist from worshipping the Most Adorable S&#8217;rî Bhagavatî Devî and that you will worship the other Devas with faith and devotion and hold on your bodies S&#8217;amkha, Chakra and other signs. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">You will follow the Kâpâlikas, Bauddha S&#8217;âstras and other heretics</span>. You will sell your father, mother, brothers, sisters, sons and daughters and even your wives too! You will sell the Vedas, Tîrthas, and your Dharma. You will not feel ashamed in any way to sell all these. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">You will certainly have faith in Kâpâlika and Bauddha opinions, Pâñcharâtras and Kâma S&#8217;âstras</span>…&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Why Gautam Rishi is cursing Brahmins is not the topic of this discussion but the way he is cursing them is very important, he curses them to follow Bauddha (Buddhist) scriptures, and he curses them to sell father, mother, sister, brother, daughters, and even wives. So following Buddhist, Jain and Kapalika scriptures are considered so worst in the sight of Gautama Rishi that he compares it to selling mother and daughter. The following verses show that they would enter hell because they embraced the heretic philosophy like Buddhism, Jainism and Kapalika,</p>
<p>Srimad Devi Bhagavatam 12.9.91-100 &#8220;…Some of them began to mark on their bodies various heretical signs, e.g., Taptamûdrâ, etc.; some became Kâpâlikas; some became Kaulas; <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">some Bauddhas and some Jainas</span>. Many of them, though learned, became lewd and addicted to other&#8217;s wives and engaged themselves in vain and bad disputations. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">For these, they will have to go again surely to the Kumbhîpâka hell</span>…&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Hindu scriptures even consider Buddhist worship places to be equivalent to cremation ground, place inhabited by wicked men, etc.,</p>
<p>Kurma Purana II.11.48-49 &#8220;The following places are also to be avoided for Yogic Practice: places where vermins abound, cremation ground, dilapidated cowpen, the quadrangle or place where four roads meet, a crowded noisy place or <span style="text-decoration: underline;">where there is an ant-hill or a Caitya (Buddhist place of worship)</span>, an unauspicious place full of wicked men, and places where mosquitoes are in plenty. Nor should one practice Yoga when the body is ailing or when the mind is dispirited.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana says that the Asuras (Demons) created Buddhism and Jainism,</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana 2.3.14.38b &#8220;Formerly, in the battle between the Devas and the Asuras, the Asuras were defeated. They created the heretics like Vrddhasravakis, Nirgranthas, (nude Jainas), Sakyas (Buddhists), Jivaskas and Karpatas.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Another verse calls them heretics who will flourish in the Kali Yuga,</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana 1.2.31.65 &#8220;After the advent of the Kali age, many types of heretics crop up. They may be Buddhists wearing ochre-coloured robes, Jainas, Kapalikas and others who sell the Vedas. Still others are those who sell holy centres of pilgrimage.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Rama in Valmiki Ramayana says that Buddhists are thieves and should be punished like a theif,</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">यथा</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;">हि</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;">चोरः</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;">स</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;">तथा</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;">हि</span> <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">बुद्ध</span></strong> |<br />
स्तथागतं नास्तिकमत्र विध्हि |<br />
तस्माद्धि यः शङ्क्यतमःप्रजानाम् |<br />
न नास्ति केनाभिमुखो बुधः स्यात्</p>
<p>Ramayana of Valmiki, Ayodhya Kanda II.109 &#8220;I blame this act of my father&#8217;s, viz.,-that he took (for his priest) one of perverse understanding, who rangeth by help of such an intellect-who is frightfully atheistic, and who hat swerved from the path of righteousness. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">As a thief is, so is a Buddha</span>, and know that in this matter, an atheist is in a like predicament. Therefore, such an one, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">when capable of being punished like a thief for the good of the people, should be punished like a thief</span>; and let no <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Brahmana ever speak with an atheist</span>.&#8221; Tr. Manmath Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Yatha hi chor = As a theif<br />
Sa tatha hi Buddhah = so is Buddha/Buddhist</p>
<p>Ralph T.H. Griffith has also translated it as Buddhist. The reason why I translated the Sanskrit version word by word is that Hindu scholars are deliberately distorting the translation. Hari Prasad Shastri translates it as Charvaka school, and another one translates it as atheistic way even when there is a clear mention of the word Buddha which is translated into English as Buddha or Buddhist. Buddha in Sanskrit means intellectual so here it is surely not condemning &#8216;Intellectual&#8217; and also it makes no sense at all. Jabali was persuading Rama to follow atheistic philosophy and Buddhism is also considered atheistic philosophy so by keeping all these in mind the word Buddhah here refers to Buddha/Buddhist, it’s true that Ramayana may not have been composed when Buddhism was founded, this seems to be a later interpolation added by Rishis. Other Hindu scriptures say that one should avoid seeing Buddhists and the very sight of a Buddhist monk even in a dream is a bad sign,</p>
<p>Narada Purana I.15.49-53 &#8220;There is no expiation anywhere to those persons who intimately associate themselves with Sudra women, whose bodies are nourished with the food of the Sudras and <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">who indulge themselves in denouncing the Vedas</span>. There is no expiation here or hereafter to those who find fault with stories of saintly people. Even through hundreds of expiations, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">it is impossible to see the redemption of that Brahmana who enters a Buddhistic shrine</span>, even in a great emergency. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The Buddhistic are heretics, as they are the revilers of the Vedas. Hence, a Brahmana shall not even look at them</span>, since they are excluded from righteous holy rites. A Brahmana may enter a Buddhist shrine knowingly or unknowingly. If he enters knowingly, there is no redemption at all. This is the decision of the scriptures.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>The Yajnavalkya Smriti says that the very sight of a monk with red robes and shaven head (referring to Buddhists), even in a dream, is a bad sign. [Yajnavalkya SmritiI/272-273]
<h2>Touching a Jain or Buddhist</h2>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">A s</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">imilar thing is mentioned in Basava Purana</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> which narrates a story of a Basava devotee,</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> that a devotee of Basava in his dream touched a Buddhist so to expiate the sins of touching a Buddhist he burned himself in Srisailam,</span></p>

<h3><a id="shraddha"></a>Buddhists and Jains seeing Shraddha invalidates it</h3>
<p>Forget about participation of Buddhists and Jains in a Hindu ritual, the Hindu ritual becomes void if it is merely sighted by a Buddhist or a Jain, they must not be present at Hindu rituals as per Hindu texts.</p>
<p>Kurma Purana II.21.32-33 &#8220;That Sraddha wherein the wicked Tamasikas such as old Sravakas (Buddhists), Jainas, knowers of Pancaratra, followers of Kapalika and Pasupata sects, atheists, and others like them eat food offered to gods, does not bestow excellent benefit here and hereafter.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Ganesh Vasudeo Tagare explains the word Nagnas &#8220;The explanation in VV.35 ff below shows that the term Nagna includes Jainas, Buddhists, Jivakas (i.e. Ajivakas, the followers of Mankhali Gosala) and such other sects who do not follow Brahminism. It includes also apostate Brahmanas, atheists and the committers of gross sins (Mahapatakas)&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Usana Samita 4.23-30 &#8220;The following are disqualified to be present at a Sraddha ceremony…The <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Sramanas (Bouddha ascetics)</span>; Nirgoodas, (a class of naked mendicants); <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">those, who, know the doctrines of the</span> Pancharatra; <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Jinas</span>; the Kapalikas, the Pasupatas; if these and similar other heretics, wicked souls pervaded by the quality of Tammas, partake of the Havi, the Sraddha does not become successful, and it does not yield fruits in the next world.&#8221; Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana 2.3.14.34 &#8220;The Nagnas (naked) and other persons must not see the well-arranged Sraddha rite. The Sraddha viewed by these do not reach the Pitrs or the Pitamahas (grandfathers).&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare.</p>
<p>Vayu Purana Part 2, 16.24 &#8221;The naked and similar (apostates and non-Vedic sects) people should not see the Sraddha rite. This is the rule. Such Sraddhas as are seen by these, do not reach Pitrs or Pitamahas.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Ganesh Vasudeo Tagare writes: &#8221;As explain below (vv.26ff), those who do not have the protective covering of the Vedas. The text not only includes non-Vedic sects like Jains and Buddhists but includes apostate Brahmins, atheists, committer of gross sins (maha-patakas).</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana 2.3.15.59-62 &#8220;&#8230;One should avoid persons with tonsured head, persons, with matter hair and persons with ochre robes in the Sraddha rite.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare<br />
Kurma Purana II.22.34-35 &#8220;The following shall be shunned and kept at a great distance from Sraddhas viz. one who is deficient in any limb, a fallen one, a leper, one with running sores, an atheist, a cock, a pig, and a dog. One shall avoid a loathsome fellow, an unclean fellow, the naked one, the intoxicated one, the rogue, a women in her monthly course, the blue-garmented, the ochre-garmented and the heretic.&#8221; Tr.

<h3><a id="shiva-incarnates"></a>Shiva incarnates to stop Buddhism</h3>
<p>You may have heard the proverb &#8220;Diamond cuts diamond (Loha Lohe ko kat ta hai)&#8217;. Hindu scripture says the same about stopping Buddhism. According to Hindu scriptures and scholars, Shiva incarnated on earth and established a false philosophy (Advaita Vedanta) just to stop another false philosophy called Buddhism. Hindu scholars consider Adi Shankaracharya to be an incarnation of Shiva as Adi Shankaracharya had successfully stopped Buddhism and even persecuted Buddhists and Jains and established objectionable philosophy (Advaita Vedanta) for which he was sometimes considered crypto-Buddhist by some Hindu scholars. It&#8217;s mentioned in Padma Purana wherein Shiva says,</p>
<p>Padma Purana 6.236.5-7 &#8220;&#8230;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Visnu of the form of Buddha proclaimed the false Buddhist doctrine</span> and those of the naked and wearing dark blue garments for the destruction of the demons. The doctrine of Maya (illusion) is a wicked doctrine and said to be pseudo-Buddhist. I myself, of the form of a Brahmana, proclaimed it in Kali (age).&#8221; Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p>A verse in Kurma Purana may also be talking about this,</p>
<p>Kurma Purana I.30.31-32a &#8220;Persons practising vows not sanctioned by the Vedas, of wicked behaviour and of futile efforts, will be deluding all other people by exhibiting the fruits thereof. Their minds are enveloped and vitiated with ignorance and these base people follow feline tricks. [33b-36] Sankara, Nilalohita, will take up incarnations for the establishing the Srauta (Vedic) and Smarata (belonging to the Smrtis) rites, with a desire for the welfare of his devotees. He will teach his disciples the knowledge pertaining to the Brahman. Those who resort to the essence of Vedantas (Upanishads) and follow the holy rites indicated in the Vedas and such of those holy rites as are pointed out with special reference to the people of all castes, serve him in whatever manner they can. They overcome defects or sins of Kali Age and attain the greatest region.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Swami Prabhupada wrote,</p>
<p>&#8220;In this regard, it is stated in the Padma Purana that Lord Siva appeared as a brahmana in the age of Kali to preach the Mayavada philosophy, which is nothing but a type of Buddhist philosophy. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">It is stated in Padma Purana: Lord Siva, speaking to Parvati-devi, foretold that he would spread the Mayavada philosophy in the guise of a sannyasi brahmana just to eradicate Buddhist philosophy</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">This sannyasi was Sripada Sankaracarya. In order to overcome the effects of Buddhist philosophy and spread Vedanta philosophy, Sripada Sankaracarya had to make some compromise with the Buddhist philosophy, and as such he preached the philosophy of monism, for it was required at that time</span>. Otherwise there was no need for his preaching Mayavada philosophy. At the present moment there is no need for Mayavada philosophy or Buddhist philosophy, and Lord Caitanya rejected both of them. This Krishna consciousness movement is spreading the philosophy of Lord Caitanya and rejecting the philosophy of both classes of Mayavadi. Strictly speaking, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">both Buddhist philosophy and Sankara&#8217;s philosophy are but different types of Mayavada dealing on the platform of material existence</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Neither of these philosophies has spiritual significance</span>. There is spiritual significance only after one accepts the philosophy of Bhagavad-gita, which culminates in surrendering unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Generally people worship Lord Siva for some material benefit, and although they cannot see him personally, they derive great material profit by worshiping him.&#8221; <strong>Swami Prabhupada on Srimad Bhagavatam 4.24.17</strong><br />

<p>He also wrote,</p>
<p>&#8220;Lord Chaitanya admitted that Sankaracharya was an incarnation of Lord Shiva, and Lord Shiva is one of the greatest devotees, a Mahajan of the Bhagwat school. There are twelve great authorities on devotional service, and Lord Shiva is one of them. Then, why did he adopt the process of Mayavadi philosophy? The answer is given in the Padma Purana, where there is a statement by Lord Shiva as follows: &#8220;The Mayavadi philosophy is veiled Buddhist philosophy.&#8221; In other words, the void philosophy of Buddha is more or less repeated in the Mayavadi philosophy of impersonalism, althouth the Mayavadi philosophy claims to be directed by the Vedic conclusions. Lord Shiva thus admits that this philosophy was manufactured by him in the Age of Kali as a Brahmin boy to mislead the atheist class of men: &#8220;Actually, the Supreme Personality of Godhead has His transcendental Body, but I describe the Supreme as impersonal. Similarly, I have explained the Vedanta Sutra also on the same principles of Mayavadi philosophy.&#8221; <strong>Teachings of Lord Chaitanya (1968) </strong><a href="http://vanisource.org/wiki/TLC_19_%281968%29" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">http://vanisource.org/wiki/TLC_19_%281968%29<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>Madhavacharya wrote that Devas went to Shiva and complained about the prevalence of Buddhists and Kapalikas and requests him to re-establish the Vedic religion, Shiva accepts their requests and tells them that he will incarnate as Adi Shankaracharya, his son will incarnate as Kumarila Bhatta and Indra will incarnate as King Sudhanva. Kumarila Bhatta with the help of King Sudhanva had persecuted Jains and Buddhists,</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;The Devas once resorted to Siva, the Lord of the Silver Mountain, for seeking a favour, just as they appraoch the Icy Moon&#8230;They addressed Him thus with folded palms: &#8216;In days of yore, it was to favour us that <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Lord Vishnu incarnated Himself as the Buddha and diverted unrighteous men from contaminating the Vedic path, by preaching a new religion for them. But today, the country is filled with the heterodox followers of that religion</span>, as night is by darkness. They are indulging in carping criticism of the Veda, declaring it to be just a fraudulent means of livelihood for a few, and condemning its teachings on the duties of Varnas and Ashramas as mere superstitions. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">As people have given up the orthodox Vedic path and become heretics</span>, there is none to do the daily devotional acts like Sandhya, or to take to the life of rununciation&#8230;The followers of the cults of Siva and Vishnu bear on themselves the emblems of the Linga and the Chakra, but they too have given up Vedic rituaals, just as evil men abandon mercy&#8230;Therefore, for the protection of the world and for the happiness of the good and holy ones, Thou shouldst deign to eradicate the world of these vicious and perverse men and their practices, and re-establish the Vedic religion on firm ground.&#8217; When the Devas had completed their submission, the great God Siva said: &#8216;Taking a human body, I shall secure what is good for you. I shall establish the Dharma, conquering all the leaders of the perverse paths. I shall produce a commentary on the Brahma Sutras, setting forth the true teachings of the Vedas. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">I shall do this, taking the form of a great Sannyasin, Sankara by name</span>, accompanied by four disciples who would be like the luminous sun dispelling the darkness of ignorance conjured up the acceptance of duality&#8230;God Siva cast his lvoing glance, so rare for any one to get, on his son Shanmukha (also called Skanda and Subrahmanya)&#8230;Siva, the great God having matted locks, spoke thus to His son: &#8216;Dear one! Hear my words that are meant for the blessing of the world&#8230;And I have now promised to the Devas, as you know very well, that I shall undertake to rejuvenate the gnostic teachings which form the ultimate purport of the Veda. Now, you have to do your part of the work, and that iss the revival of the ritualistic section of Brahma (the Veda) condified by Jaimini, and thereby gain the reputed name of Subrahmanya (promoted of Brhamanya), <span style="text-decoration: underline;">besides the commonly known name of Kumarila Bhatta</span>, the preacher of the Vedic Karma-Kanda. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">In order to refute and confute the Buddhists who are attacking the the Vedic teachings and to establish the Vedic way of life</span>, you have to be born in the world. For your help, Brahma will be born as the scholar Mandana, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">while Indra will become the king Sudhanva</span> for the very same purpose.&#8221; <strong>Shankara Digvijaya 1.27-56, by Madhavacharya, Tr.

<h3><a id="kalki-buddhists"></a>Kalki avatar a murderer of Buddhists</h3>
<p>As per Kalki Purana, the final avatar of Vishnu takes birth on the earth, plunders nearby tribes to support his father&#8217;s horse sacrifice, kills many people and exterminates almost every tribe and also persecutes Buddhists. What is the crime of Buddhists that they deserve to die at the hands of Kalki avatar? Because they are Buddhists, they are heretics, because they don’t follow Vedic religion. I am using Kalki Purana which is translated and edited by ISKCON scholars Bhumipati Das and Purnaprajna Das and the translation is published as &#8216;Sri Kalki Purana&#8217;.</p>
<p>Sri Kalki Purana 13.39-44 &#8220;Lord Kalki appeared to flourish, being surrounded by all these family members. Once, Lord Kalki&#8217;s father, Visnuyasa, who was on the level of Lord Brahma, decided to perform a horse sacrifice. Understanding the intention of His father, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Lord Kalki said: My dear father, I will go out and defeat all other kings in battle and thus bring you sufficient wealth so that you can conduct the horse sacrifice properly</span>. Lord Kalki, who was certainly capable of conquering all other kings, offered His obeisances to his father and <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">then set out with his army to first conquer Kikatapura. Most of the inhabitants of this city were Buddhists, who never offered oblations to their forefathers, nor worshiped the demigods</span>&#8230;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">They did not deignate themselves or their families in terms of caste, and thus there was no conception of high or low birth</span>. As far as earning wealth, marriage, or eating were concerned, they had no sense of discrimination. The people of that city were interested only in eating, drinking, and making merry. When the ruler of that city, who was named Jina, head that Lord Kalki had come to fight, He quickly gathered an army consisting of one aksauhini.&#8221; Tr. Bhumipati Das edited by Purnaprajna Das</p>
<p>Sri Kalki Purana 16.1 &#8220;Suta Gosvami said. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">After killing the Buddhists and mlecchas of Kikatapura, Lord Kalki took their wealth</span> and returned to His capital, along with His vast army&#8221; Tr. Bhumipati Das edited by Purnaprajna Das</p>
<p>This proves that his sole purpose for killing Buddhists of Kitaka was to plunder them. Kalki born to Vishnuyasa is also mentioned in Agni Purana chapter 16.</p>
<p>Sri Kalki Purana 3.10 &#8220;Thereafter, You will set out to conquer the entire world and in the course of that conquest, You will defeat many sinful kings who are representatives of Kali. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">You will also annihilate many followers of Buddhism</span> and finally, You will entrust the responsibility of ruling the world to Devapi and Maru.&#8221; Tr. Bhumipati Das, edited by Purnaprajna Das</p>
<p>Sri Kalki Purana 10.30 &#8220;Recently, You appeared as Lord Kalki in order to eliminate the dynasty of Kali by destroying the Buddhists, atheists, and mlecchas, thereby protecting the true path of religion. What more can we say about your causeless mercy?&#8221; Tr. Bhumipati Das edited by Purnaprajna Das</p>
<p>Sri Kalki Purana 20.25 &#8220;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">You will be happy to learn that I have already defeated the Buddhists residing at Kikata-desa</span>. My mission is to destroy all the miscreants who are envious of you and other Vaisnavas. You can now wander fearlessly over the earth because I am just about to set out on a tour to conquer all the kings of the world.&#8221; Tr. Bhumipati Das, edited by Purnaprajna Das</p>
<p>Sri Kalki Purana 14.11 &#8220;Although Lord Kalki&#8217;s wonderful horse had been injured by Jina&#8217;s trident, he soon regained his composure and began roaming over the battlefield, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">jumping fiercely while angrily attacking hundreds and thousands of Buddhist soldiers</span>. In this way, Lord Kalki&#8217;s horse killed many sinful men. [13] <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Within a short period of time, Gargya and his associates killed six thousand Buddhist warriors</span>. Bhargya killed ten million enemy soldiers with the help of his army, and Visala killed twenty five thousand.&#8221; Tr. Bhumipati Das edited by Purnaprajna Das</p>
<p>The translator Bhumipati Das explains why verses in Kalki Purana are in the past tense when it predicts the advent of the Kalki avatar,</p>
<p>&#8220;Among the upa-puranas or sub Puranas, the Kalki Purana is most sacred and widely respected. At the end of Kali-yuga, the Supreme Lord, Hari, will incarnate as Lord Kalki and kill all the mlecchas, yavanas, atheists, and Buddhists of the world that defy the Vedic authority. The pastimes of Lord Kalki are subject matter of this literature, which is presented in story form. Exalted personalities can see everything, past, present, and future. For this reason, there is no fault in narrating these future events as if they had already occurred. The Kalki Purana consists of thirty-five chapters.&#8221; <strong>by Bhumipati Das in Introduction of book Sri Kalki Purana, Published by Jai Nitai Press</strong></p>

<h2><a id="intolerance-jainism"></a>Intolerance towards Jainism</h2>
<p>Just like Buddhism, the Jain religion is also declared a false and a heretic religion in Hindu scriptures. Swami Dayanand Saraswati wrote,</p>
<p>&#8220;When the people of Aryavarta gave up the study of the Vediclore which alone enables one to discriminate between right and wrong, ignorance spread over the land and many sects sprang up, the Jain religion, whose teachings are opposed to science, took root in the country…&#8221; <strong>By Swami Dayanand Saraswati, Satyarth Prakash, Ch 12, p.499, Tr.

<p>&#8216;<span style="color: #ff0000;">&#8216;What a nice trap have the Jainees set to attract fools</span> who would like nothing better than to be placed in the way of attaining salvation without having to do (righteous) deeds. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">We do not think that there exists a religion more idiotic than this</span>.&#8221; <strong>by Swami Dayanand Saraswati, Satyarth Prakash, Ch 12, page 559, Tr. Chiranjiva Bhardwaja </strong>http://satyarthprakash.in/english/category/satyarthprakash/page/5/</p>
<p>Both Jainism and Hinduism recognises Rishabhdeva or Rishabhnatha as Tirthankara (first teacher). But Hinduism doesn&#8217;t believe Tirthankara to be a Jain or as the founder of Jainism. Hindu scriptures say that Rishabhdeva was a Hindu god and avatar.</p>
<p>Linga Purana I.24.43-47 says that Shiva will incarnate as Rsabha</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 1.3.13 Says that Rishabhdeva was the eighth incarnation of Vishnu</p>
<p><strong>Swami Prabhupada wrote:</strong> &#8220;…Jains refer to Lord Ṛṣabhadeva as their original preceptor. If such people are serious followers of Ṛṣabhadeva, they must also take His instructions…&#8221; <strong>On Srimad Bhagvatam 5.6.12 </strong>http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_5.6.12</p>
<p>He means to say that Jains don&#8217;t follow what Rishabhdeva preached. There are different versions regarding the founder of Jainism in Hindu scriptures. Some Hindu scripture says that a King named Arhat was the founder, some say Jina was the founder, some say Brihaspati in Shukracharya&#8217;s guise founded Jainism, and some say Vishnu created an illusory form namely Arhat to delude people. Jains are referred to in Hindu scriptures as Arhat, Jina, Jaina and also Jain. A story from Padma Purana alone is enough to give the image of how Jainism is viewed in Hinduism. Let me present the verses first,</p>
<p>Padma Purana II.37.4-11 [Suta said] I shall tell (you) <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">all the sinful conduct of Vena</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">When he a noble king knowing righteousness was ruling</span>, a man, having put on a guise, naked, of a huge body, with his head clean-shaved, of a great lustre, holding under his armpit a broom of peacock&#8217;s feathers, and a drinking-pot made of cocoa-nut in his hand reciting (texts containing) wrong doctrines, vilifying the Vedic religion, came (there). He quickly came to (the place) where Vena was (seated). <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The sinner entered the court of that Vena</span>. Seeing him having arrived (there) Vena asked him a question: &#8216;Who are you, taking up such a form&#8230;What is your faith? Tell me (all this). What is your Veda (i.e. which Veda do you follow)? What are your practices&#8230;What are the real characteristics of your faith? Tell me all that and the truth before me.&#8221; Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p>Padma Purana II.37.12a-21 &#8220;Hearing those words of Vena <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">the sinful man</span> said these words. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The sinful man said</span>: In vain you are ruling. You are a great fool, there is no doubt about it. I am all-in-all of Dharma (i.e. religious practices). I am most adored by gods. I am knowledge&#8230;I am Dharma (i.e. religious practices)&#8230;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Know me to be the chief Jaina saint</span>, having body of true religion. The meditating sages, intent on (obtaining) knowledge, run to me only. Vena said: What kind of acts (do you do)? What is your doctrine? What are your practices? Tell (all this to me). <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The sinful man said: (That is my faith) where Arhats are the gods</span>, and Nirgrantha is looked upon as the preceptor&#8230;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The best worship is that of a Jaina mendicant, and the best meditation is that of an Arhat. This way of life is seen in the Jaina faith</span>. I have told you all this i.e. the characteristics of my faith&#8230;.&#8221; Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p>King Vena was surprised looking at this Jain saint so he asked him about his faith and practices. The Jain saint also criticizes the animal slaughter sanctioned by the Vedas. I have not added those verses here as it would&#8217;ve made the passage very long, I tried to make it as short as possible, we shall read it in Meat consumption in Hinduism article. So the Jain saint explains his beliefs and also criticizes the Vedic religion. Now read how the Jain religion is viewed by Hindu sages who addressed king Vena in the following way,</p>
<p>Padma Purana II.38.25-30 &#8220;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">When Kali (yuga) sets in, all men, deluded by sins, will act after having resorted to the Jaina faith</span>. Men will abandon Vedic practices, and will commit sins. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">There is no doubt that the Jaina faith is the root of sin</span>. O best king, the fall of those men, who are heaps of sins, brought about by this great delusion. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Govinda (i.e. Visnu), destroyer of all sins, will be (appearing) for their destruction and for nothing else</span>. Taking the form of his liking he will restrain (them) from sins. When sins will have thus accumulated, he, the god will be (appearing) as Kalki for the destruction of the Mlecchas; there is no doubt about it. Give up the behavior of (i.e. proper for) Kali (yuga) and resort to merit. Heave truthfully; become the guardian of your subjects.&#8221; Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p>On being advised by the Jain saint, King Vena embraces Jainism,</p>
<p>Padma Purana II.38.1-5a &#8220;Suta said: Vena, thus advised by <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">that very sinful Jina, and deluded by him, attained to a sinful attitude</span>. Abandoning the Vedic faith and rites of a truthful conduct, he saluted the feet of <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">that very wicked one</span>. There was cessation of good sacrifices, and also of that Vedas. Religious practices full of holy scriptures (i.e. as told in the holy scriptures) did not proceed at that time. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">As a result of (bad) rule</span>, the world became full of all sins. When that king ruled, there were no sacrifices, no (recitation of) the Vedas, no excellent purport of the holy texts, no charity and no study, O brahmanas.&#8221; Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p>So according to Hindu texts, King Vena was a righteous and noble king but as soon as he embraced Jainism he started ruling badly. This shows that whoever is against Hinduism (or is a non-Hindu) is demonized in Hindu scriptures. The verse also says that deluded by sins people will resort to Jainism. And have you noticed how the Jain saint is addressed here? He is addressed in these verses as &#8216;the wicked one&#8217; and &#8216;the sinful man&#8217;. It means whoever is not an Arya cannot be righteous, all non-Hindus are wicked and sinful. We find mention of King Vena in other scriptures also but they don&#8217;t mention that he had embraced Jainism. He has also been demonized in those scriptures as a bad ruler probably because he left the Vedic religion and embraced Jainism.</p>
<p>Also, read Srimad Bhagavatam 4.14.30-35 in the <a href="#blasphemy" class="broken_link"><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #0000ff;">Blasphemy </span></a>category where Brahmins killed King Vena for blaspheming Vishnu. Bhagavad Purana insults Jainism in the following way,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 5.6.9 &#8220;Śukadeva Gosvāmī continued speaking to Mahārāja Parīkṣit: My dear King, the King of Koṅka, Veṅka and Kuṭaka whose name was Arhat, heard of the activities of Ṛṣabhadeva and, imitating Ṛṣabhadeva&#8217;s principles, introduced a new system of religion. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Taking advantage of Kali-yuga, the age of sinful activity, King Arhat, being bewildered, gave up the Vedic principles</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">, which are free from risk, and </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">concocted a new system of religion opposed to the Vedas</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">. </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">That was the beginning of the Jain dharma</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">. Many other so-called religions followed this atheistic system</span>.&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Swami Prabhupada wrote &#8220;The followers of King Arhat went under the name Jains&#8221; <a href="http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_5.6.10" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_5.6.10<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>He also wrote,</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;the King of Koṅka and Veṅka acted like a paramahaṁsa and imitated Lord Ṛṣabhadeva. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">He introduced a system of religion and took advantage of the fallen condition of the people </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">in this age of Kali</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">It is said in Vedic literatures that people in this age will be more inclined to accept anyone as the Supreme Lord and accept any religious system opposed to Vedic principles</span>. The people in this age are described as mandāḥ sumanda-matayaḥ. Generally they have no spiritual culture, and therefore they are very fallen. Due to this, they will accept any religious system. Due to their misfortune. they forget the Vedic principles. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Following non-Vedic principles in this age, they think themselves the Supreme Lord and thus spread the cult of atheism all over the world</span>.&#8221; <strong>Swami Prabhupada on Srimad Bhagavatam 5.6.9</strong> <a href="http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_5.6.9" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_5.6.9<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>So the founder of Jainism was bewildered and taking advantage of Kali Yuga he established the false religion called Jainism. It also says that Jainism is opposed to the Vedas. Kurma Purana lists Jaina texts in ignorant scriptures,</p>
<p>Kurma Purana I.12.261 &#8220;<span style="color: #ff0000;">Those various scriptures which are contrary to Srutis and Smrtis seen in this world, are based on Tamo-guna or ignorance</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Belief in them or practising in accordance with them is a Tamasa activity</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">They i.e. those contrary to Vedas are the cults of Kapala, Bhairava, (v.1. Pancaratras), Yamala, Vama, and Arhata </span>and others similar to these also. In another incarnation of mine, these scriptures having been promulgated by me to delude the people who themselves try to <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">mislead other persons by propagating their false scriptures</span>.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Ganesh Vasudeo Tagare wrote,</p>
<p>Pasupatism: KP. records two forms of Pasupatism, one approved by Vedic tradition and the other condemned so much that sect is not only classed with non-Vedic heretic sects like Vama (&#8216;left hand&#8217; type of Tantrism) and <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Arhata (Jainas) created for the delusion of non-believers (KP.I.12.261-62)</span> but <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the believers are prohibited from even speaking with those heretics (KP.II.16.15)</span>&#8230;&#8221; Ganesha Vasudeo Tagare, Introduction (V) Religious Sects in the KP, p.xxxiv</p>
<p>A verse in Vishnu Purana says that the demons embraced Buddhism and Jainism which are false doctrines and it is prohibited to converse with them, eat in their house, meet them, etc., the entire chapter is important. If possible you can read the entire chapter available at sacred-texts.com. The passages are long though I have presented certain points only,</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 3.18.1-3 &#8220;PARÁŚARA.&#8211;After this, the great delusion, having proceeded to earth, beheld the Daityas engaged in ascetic penances upon the banks of the Narmadá river ; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">and approaching them in the semblance of a naked mendicant, with his head shaven, and carrying a bunch of peacock&#8217;s feathers</span>&#8230;[7-14] By such persuasions, and by many specious arguments, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">did this delusive being mislead the Daityas from the tenets of the Vedas</span>&#8230;might be the duty of those who go naked, or who go clothed in much raiment: and so the Daityas were seduced from their proper duties by the repeated lessons of their illusory preceptor, maintaining the equal truth of contradictory tenets; <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">and they were called Arhatas</span>, from the phrase he had employed of <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">&#8220;Ye are worthy (Arhatha) of this great doctrine;&#8221; that is, of the false doctrines which he persuaded them to embrace</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The foes of the gods being thus induced to apostatize from the religion of the Vedas</span>, by the delusive person sent by Vishńu, became in their turn teachers of the same heresies, and perverted others; and these, again, communicating their principles to others, by whom they were still further disseminated, the Vedas were in a short time deserted by most of the Daitya race&#8230;[18-26] In this manner, exclaiming to them, &#8220;Know!&#8221; (Budhyadwam), and they replying, &#8220;It is known&#8221; (Budhyate), <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">these Daityas were induced by the arch deceiver to deviate from their religious duties (and become Bauddhas)</span>&#8230;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The delusions of the false teacher paused not with the conversion of the Daityas to the Jaina and Bauddha heresies</span>, but with various erroneous tenets he prevailed upon others to apostatize, until the whole were led astray, and deserted the doctrines and observances inculcated by the three Vedas. Some then spake evil of the sacred books; some blasphemed the gods; some treated sacrifices and other devotional ceremonies with scorn; and others calumniated the Brahmans&#8230;&#8221;The precepts,&#8221; they cried, &#8220;that lead to the injury of animal life (as in sacrifices) are highly reprehensible&#8230;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">If an animal slaughtered in religious worship is thereby raised to heaven, would it not be expedient for a man who institutes a sacrifice to kill his own father for a victim?</span>&#8230;[42-45] <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Let not a man associate, in residence, sitting, or society, with him whose person or whose house has been blasted by the sighs of the gods, progenitors, and spirits. Conversation, interchange of civilities, or association with a man who for a twelvemonth has not discharged his religious duties, is productive of equality of guilt; and the person who eats in the house of such a man, or sits down with him, or sleeps on the same couch with him, becomes like him instantaneously</span>&#8230; [102-4] These, Maitreya, are the persons called naked, the meaning of which term you desired to have explained. Their very looks vitiate the performance of an ancestral oblation; speaking to then destroys religious merit for a whole day. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">These are the unrighteous heretics to whom a man must not give shelter, and speaking to whom effaces whatever merit he may that day have obtained</span>.&#8221; Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>This chapter of Vishnu Purana is explained briefly in Punishment for Apostasy under the sub-category <a href="#examples" class="broken_link"><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #0000ff;">Examples</span></a>. Skanda Purana also says that demons embraced Buddhism,</p>
<p>Skanda Purana VII.I.119.46-50 &#8220;&#8230;the Daitya warriors became furious. They rushed thereat roaring like rumbling clouds. When they were killed, they shouted &#8216;Ha! Ha!&#8217; some of the Asuras entered the sea. A few Danavas went over the mountains. Some of them had tonsured their heads and they stayed within forests as rogues. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Some of them adopted the Vrata of the Nirgranthas (nude sages or Digambara Jainas) and preached sermons on the pious activities of merciful nature</span>. Some of them became afraid of (the goddess) for their lives. They resorted to the life of heretics. They were fools engaged in arguments and disputations about basic or original causes. They had no cleanliness and they did not crave for anything. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">They are indeed seen even today in the world of Ksapanakas (Buddhist monks)</span>. Others are Bhindakas excluded from the scriptures of Saiva cult.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>A story in Devi Bhagavatam says that Brihaspati deceived the demons by assuming the form of Sukracharya and preached Jain religion to them and the demons rejected the real Sukracharya who later cursed the demons for not recognizing him, thus the motive of Brihaspati was accomplished as the demons were cursed and could be easily be defeated by Indra, so Brihaspati went to Indra and informed him about this. It shows that demons were the first to embrace Jainism.</p>
<p>Srimad Devi Bhagavatam 4.13.44-58 &#8220;Vyâsa said:&#8211; Please hear what the disguised Brihaspatî in the shape of S&#8217;ukrâchârya did afterwards. The demons were made to understand clearly by Brihaspatî; and then they took him for S&#8217;ukrâchârya and placed implicit faith on him and began to think of him and him alone. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The Daityas, enchanted and deceived by the magic of Brihaspatî, took now his refuge for acquiring the knowledge from him, since they mistook him for S&#8217;ukrâchârya</span>. Who is there that is not enchanted by the idea of gaining something? On the other hand, when the term of ten years was over, S&#8217;ukrâchârya, the real Guru of the Daityas, ceased enjoying Jayantî and began to remember his disciples, the Daityas. He now began to think that &#8220;My disciples, the Daityas, are expecting every instant my return; and I would now go and see them, bewildered with fear. They are my devotees and I ought to do such that they might not be afraid of the Devas.&#8221; And then he exclaimed to Jayantî, &#8220;O beautiful one! Let my sons take the shelter of the Gods; your term of ten years is today over; I now go therefore, to see my disciples; soon I will again come to you.&#8221; &#8220;Be it so&#8221;, replied Jayantî, the best of those who know religion, &#8220;you can go where you like; I am not to destroy your Dharma.&#8221; Hearing these words, S&#8217;ukrâchârya went hurriedly to the Demons and saw the Devaguru Brihaspatî sitting before them in the guise of S&#8217;ukrâchârya. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">He was explaining to them the Jaina doctrines, compiled by himself and finding fault with the act of envy, taking revenge and killing and cursing the sacrifices, etc</span>. He was telling them &#8220;O Enemies of Gods! Truly, I am telling you words that will, no doubt, prove good to you. Non-killing is the highest virtue; even the enemies ought never to be killed. It is the Brâhmanas, addicted to enjoyments and pleasures of the senses, who want to satisfy their tastes and pleasures that are found in the Veda&#8217;s injunctions to kill animals; but there is no virtue higher than non-killing animals.&#8221; O king! S&#8217;ukrâchârya was perfectly astonished to hear Brihaspatî, the Guru of the Devas, speaking against the Vedas and began to think that Brihaspatî is certainly my enemy. My disciples have been duped by this cheat; there is no doubt in this.&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Srimad Devi Bhagavatam 4.13.59-62 &#8220;Fie to Avarice! It is the seed of sin; very strong and the veritable gate to hell; Brihaspatî, even, the Guru of the Devas, is speaking lies, bound under the influence of this heinous avarice! Oh! What wonder is this that the Guru of the Devas, who is the promulgator of all the religious S&#8217;âstras and whose word is accepted as the final decision, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">is now expounding the doctrines of atheists</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">When Brihaspatî can become the expounder of atheistic doctrines</span>, impelled by covetousness what to speak of those whose minds are not pure and whose intelligence is not sharp? <span style="text-decoration: underline;">This Deva Guru, though a Brâhmin, is acting today like a rogue, wanting to take away all and is deceiving my disciples the Daityas</span>, who have been confounded by his magic.&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Srimad Devi Bhagavatam 4.14.16-19 &#8220;Vyâsa said:&#8211; Thus saying S&#8217;ukrâchârya hurriedly went away, infuriated with anger. Brihaspatî was glad and remained there with his mind calm. Brihaspatî then knowing the Daityas cursed by S&#8217;ukrâchârya, assumed his real appearance, left that place, and hurriedly returned to Indra. He began to say &#8220;I have undoubtedly succeeded in my undertaking; the Daityas have been cursed and left by me too. They are now helpless; so, O Good Suras! I have made them cursed, you would better now try to fight with them.&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>The founder of Virashaivism, Basava (initially a Shaiva Brahmin), was the chief minister of the Kalachuri king Bijjala, a staunch Jain with his capital at Kalyana in modern day Karnataka. The Basava Purana, a long hagiography dedicated to Basava narrates that not only did he successfully plot a regicide, but also sanctified violence against Jains, in rather gruesome ways such as putting “a sharp spear on the skulls of Jains&#8221;. Such an ideology fell in line with Virashaivism’s idea of opposing the caste system and ostentatious rituals, tenets that made the new religion popular with the masses in no time. Being the religion dominating Karnataka in the early medieval era, Jainism took the greatest hit and saw a sharp fall in its following.</p>
<p>Apart from vying for political patronage, the Lingayats (followers of Virashaivism) also started appropriating and converting Jaina basadis (shrines) into Virashaiva temples, an act that not only signified Virashaiva strength, but was also a practical necessity for a nascent religion with not enough resources to build a new temple from scratch.</p>
<p>Basava&#8217;s anniversary is celebrated across India mainly in Karnataka on the pretext that he was a social reformer let&#8217;s have a look at what Basava Purana the sacred text of Lingayat says about Jainism. Basava is regarded as the incarnation of Nandi, The Basava Purana II.32 says that Narada reported to Siva that, while other religions were flourishing, the Saiva faith was with few exceptions dying out among the Brahmins and so decaying among other castes also; Siva then asked Nandin to become incarnate as the Virasaiva saint Basavanna to preach Virasaivism in keeping with orthodox dharma.</p>
<p>Jains in Basava Purana are called two-legged beasts, animals, dogs, etc, so much is the love for Jains from one of the biggest reformers of Hinduism. The following verses show how Jains were persecuted and Vasadis (Jain Shrines) were destroyed by devotees of Basava while Basava didn&#8217;t stop it and instead Basava praised his devotee for carrying out the persection,</p>
<p>Basava Purana, chapter VI &#8220;O Jain, is it appropriate for me to cut off my head and get it right back? No, I will cut it off now and walk the streets of this town for seven days and then get it back. Can you even watch me do that? <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Not only that, I will tear down all the Jain vasadis in Kalyana so that there will not even be one left for a sample. Furthermore, I will smash all the idols of Jina</span>. This is my vow. Is there any reason why I should not subject you <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">two-legged beasts</span></strong> to this?&#8221; he said. The Jains agreed to his proposal. They all gathered together and sat on one side and watched. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">On the other side sat Basava with the devotees in attendance</span></strong>. Bijjala and his ministers were also there, along with all the people of the city young and old alike&#8230;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Basava praised him</span>; the devotees cheered him on..For seven days, Ekanta Ramayya strode though the city. Then he went and stood in front of the temple gate and cried out, &#8216;Come on now, you Jains, you have seen my vow!&#8221;&#8230;  The Jains gave him an acknowledgement of his victory, written by the king. And they all come and bowed down before the assembly of devotion. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">On each person&#8217;s face the devotees impressed the marks of Siva</span>. With cries and roars, the heroic assembly of mahesvara rose up. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">They quickly destroyed all the Jain vasadis and broke the heads of all the Jina idols. When they were finished, there was not a trace of a Jain vasadi or a Jina idol in all of Kalyana. In a fury, the devotees harassed and killed every known Jain and smashed them all into the ground</span>. The devotees of Black Throat responded by praising the peerless courage of Ekanta Ramayya. Meanwhile, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Basava worshipped Ekanta Ramayya</span> as if he were Sangamesa&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Velcheru Narayana Rao</p>
<p>Basava Purana Chapter VI &#8220;Therefore, it is not within your capacity to know our Lingadeva&#8217;s power. Ramanatha is everything, but yet the nondevotees are not capable of gaining him. Don&#8217;t say that this has never been proven! If you simply ask me to, I will give you visible evidence. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">It is well known there are seven hundred Jain vasadis in Potlaceruvu, and I am going to have them all destroyed. You are mere animals</span>. What more can I say to you?&#8221; Tr. Velcheru Narayana Rao</p>
<p>Some Jains tried to kill Tirunavakarisa in unsuccessful attempts and they were scared that he would kill them so they converted to Shaivism but this didn&#8217;t stop Tirunavakarisa, he destroyed many Jain shrines and broke the idols of Jains.</p>
<p>Basava Purana Chapter VI &#8220;&#8230;When the Jains were unable to kill him by any means whatsoever, they began to be afraid that he would kill them. So those who had been tormenting him asked him for refuge, and he protected them. He wiped out their old marks and gave them rudraksa, ashes, and the rest of the five marks. In a rage, he destroyed all the Jain images and wrecked all the Jain vasadis. &#8216;For doing so, Tirunavakarisa became known as the destroyer of the Jains&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Velcheru Narayana Rao</p>
<p>Nowadays many Hindus try to bring Jains and Buddhists within the Hindu fold so as to increase the numbers in population and also claims that Hinduism believes all religion to be true but a story from Basava Purana says how Pilla Narayana converted 2000 Buddhists and drove away the Buddhist saint,</p>
<p>Basava Purana Chapter VI &#8220;There was a Buddhist guru who was attended by two thousand disciples. Pilla Nayanaru drove the guru away and converted the two thousand Buddhists into devotees of Siva.&#8221; Tr. Velcheru Narayana Rao</p>

<h3><a id="Shudras-Buddhism"></a>Shudras will embrace Buddhism and Jainism</h3>
<p>Hindu scriptures predicted that some Shudras will embrace Buddhism and Jainism,</p>
<p>Kurma Purana I.30.13 &#8220;When the close of Yuga is imminent, Sudras calling themselves Jinas (subduers of sense organs) will perform holy rites by shaving off their heads, wearing ochre robes and black antelope skins and keeping their teeth white.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Vayu Purana Part I.58.59 &#8220;When the close of Yuga is imminent, Sudras exhibiting their white teeth, with clean shaven heads and wearing ohcrecoloured robes will perform sacred rites, proclaiming that they have conquered the sense organs.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare, edited by G.P. Bhatt</p>
<p>G.V. Tagare writes &#8220;Probably a reference to Buddhist monks, as Buddhism prevailed all over India at the time of these Puranas.&#8221;</p>
<p>G.V. Tagare explains the word Jina in the footnote as &#8220;This refers to Buddhist Bhiksus. The term &#8216;Jina&#8217; means &#8216;the subduer of sense organs&#8217; and is applied to the Buddha, Jainas (especially Digambaras) are mentioned in V.16 below.&#8221;</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 5.6.11 &#8220;Believing in the blind tradition the new way of life chosen by them but which is unsupporter by the Vedas, they of their own accord will fall into dark abymsalhell.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Harivamsa Purana 3.3.17 &#8220;Shudras with white teeth, anjan in eyes, shaven head and wearing ochre clothes will earn their livelihood, following the dharma of shakyabuddha.&#8221; Tr. A. Purushothaman and A. Harindranath</p>
<p>Narada Purana I.41.54-55 &#8220;The Sudras will not serve the twice-born. Assuming the airs of heretics, the base-born assume and practice holy rites of the Brahmanas. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The Sudras will clothe themselves in ochre-robes</span>; they will have matted hair; they will smear ashes all over their bodies. Thus equipped and employing deceptive arguments, they will begin to expatiate on Dharma. [58-] Occupying excellent seats, Sudras will expatiate on Dharma-religious duties-to Brahmans who habitually destroy Dharma. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">These and many other heretics such as nude ascetics (Digambaras), red-roled mendicants, will roam about; most of whom will be decrying the Vedas</span>. [71] After the advent of the Kali age, Sudras and outcastes will become kings and the Brahmans will be engaged in rendering service to them. They will be begging for alms&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>

<p>Manu Smriti 2.10-11 &#8220;The Veda is called the S&#8217;ruti, and the Dharma S&#8217;astra is called the Smriti.

Dutt</p>
<p>Hindu scholar Medhatithi the commentator of Manu Smriti wrote on this verse,</p>

<p>Vishnu Purana narrates the story of a Hindu king named Satadhanu who on account of his conversation with heretics was reborn as a dog, it explicitly considers conversing with non-Hindus as a grave sin leading to severe punishments,</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 3.18.48-50 &#8220;Men fall into hell who converse with one who takes his food without offering a portion to the gods, the sages, the manes, spirits, and guests. Let therefore a prudent person carefully avoid the conversation, or the contact, and the like, of those heretics who are rendered impure by their desertion of the three Vedas…[56-63] On one occasion, when they had fasted on the full moon of Kártika, and had bathed in the Bhagirathí, they beheld, as they came up from the water, a heretic approach them, who was the friend of the Rájá&#8217;s military preceptor. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The Rájá, out of respect to the latter, entered into conversation with the heretic</span>; but not so did the princess; reflecting that she was observing a fast, she turned from him, and cast her eyes up to the sun. On their arrival at home, the husband and wife, as usual, performed the worship of Vishńu, agreeably to the ritual. After a time the Rájá, triumphant over his enemies, died; and the princess ascended the funeral pile of her husband. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">In consequence of the fault committed by Śatadhanu, by speaking to an infidel when he was engaged in a solemn fast, he was born again as a dog</span>…[74-81] &#8220;Dost thou not remember, oh king, the circumstance of conversing with a heretic, which I called to thy recollection when thou wast a dog…she exclaimed, &#8220;recollect yourself: away with this uncouth form, to which the sin of conversing with a heretic has condemned you…<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Such, Maitreya, is the sin of conversing with a heretic, and such are the expiatory effects of bathing after the solemn sacrifice of a horse</span>, as I have narrated them to you. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Let therefore a man carefully avoid the discourse or contact of an unbeliever</span>, especially at seasons of devotion, and when engaged in the performance of religious rites preparatory to a sacrifice…[103-4] <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Men, indeed, fall into hell as the consequence of only conversing with those who unprofitably assume the twisted hair, and shaven crown; with those who feed without offering food to gods, spirits, and guests; and those who are excluded from the presentation of cakes, and libations of water, to the manes</span>.&#8221; Tr.

<p>Heretics here refer to Buddhists and Jains, reading the entire chapter of Vishnu Purana will help understand this better.</p>

<h2><a id="persecution"></a>Persecution of Buddhists and Jains</h2>
<p>Hindu scriptures spewing venom against Buddhists and Jains and calling their faith as false religions resulted in persecution of Buddhists and Jains by Hindus. There was no large-scale persecution at once but there was a systematic ethnic cleansing of Buddhists and Jains in India that annihilated them. Even Hindu scholars agree that Buddhism and Jainism were prevalent religions in India, but their population has been reduced to a miniscule population due to the persecution, Swami Vivekandanda wrote,</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">And such was his heart that he burnt to death lots of Buddhist monks &#8212; by defeating them in argument! And the Buddhists, too, were foolish enough to burn themselves to death</span>, simply because they were worsted in argument! <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">What can you call such an action on Shankara&#8217;s part except fanaticism?</span> But look at Buddha&#8217;s heart! Ever ready to give his own life to save the life of even a kid &#8212; what to speak of &#8220;[(Sanskrit)]&#8211; for the welfare of the many, for the happiness of the many&#8221;!

<p>Swami Prabhupada the founder of ISKCON wrote,</p>
<p>&#8220;The exact word used in Sanskrit is <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">nāstika, which refers to one who does not believe in the Vedas</span> but manufactures some concocted system of religion. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu has said that the followers of the Buddhist system of religion are nāstikas</span>. In order to establish his doctrine of nonviolence, Lord Buddha flatly refused to believe in the Vedas, and thus, later on, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Śaṅkarācārya stopped this system of religion in India and forced it to go outside India</span>.&#8221; <strong>Swami Prabhupada on Srimad Bhagavatam 4.2.30</strong><br />

<p>Swami Apurvanand, an author from Vivekananda&#8217;s tradition, describes, on the authority of an ancient text &#8220;Shankara Vijay&#8221; by Anandagiri, how Dharmapala, a Bouddha Aacharya of Nalanda Boudha Vidyapitha was defeated in &#8216;shastrartha&#8217; i.e. interpreting old existing texts, without trying to elucidate new principles, by Kumarila Bhatta. Kumarila, an uncle of Buddhist scholar Dharmakirti, being defeated and humiliated by Dharmakirti, decided to study Buddhist shastras as he thought &#8216;it is always necessary to study the enemy before attacking it&#8217; and joined Nalanda in the guise of a disciple of Dharmapala, in order to acquire enough knowledge of Buddhism so as to defeat Buddha&#8217;s doctrine. After studying Buddhism for some time, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">he challenged his guru Dharmapala, defeated him in &#8216;shastrartha&#8217;, and saw his guru embrace &#8216;tushanal&#8217; i.e. a funeral pyre made up of hay and dry wood. Dharmapala declared before being burnt alive</span>, &#8220;I am defeated by brilliance of Kumarila, but still I believe in supremacy of Buddha&#8217;s doctrine, I am not deviated at all from Buddha, His Dhamma or His Sangha, and <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">so I would renounce my life rather than renounce Buddhism</span>&#8220;. This is an account from a Brahmanic book and not from a Buddhist one. Shastrartha, Swamiji tells us, involved scholarship i.e.. an ability to quote from ancient texts, literary acumen, ability to debate and argue without cause, without logic, demonstration of so called yogic powers etc. [Swami Apurvananda, &#8220;Aacharya Shankara&#8221; 2nd edition. 1989, (Marathi translation of Bengali book), Ramakrishna Matha, Dhantoli, Nagpur, p. 94 ff.] <a href="http://www.ambedkar.org/research/Holi__A_Festival_To_Commomorate_Bahujan_Burning.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">http://www.ambedkar.org/research/Holi__A_Festival_To_Commomorate_Bahujan_Burning.htm<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>Swami Dayanand Saraswati the founder of Arya Samaj wrote,</p>
<p>&#8220;About 2,200 years ago Shankaracharya, a Braahmana of Dravid (Southern India), studied Grammar and all other Shaastras- books on Logic, Philosophy, Metaphysics, Theology, etc. &#8211; during student life, and seeing the religious degradation of his country began to soliloquies thus:- &#8220;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">What a pity! The true theistic Vedic religion has disappeared, whilst the atheistic Jain religion has prevailed to the great detriment of the people. This (i.e., the Jain religion) must be put down somehow</span>.&#8221; Shankarcharya had not only read the Shaastras but also the Jain scriptures. He was also a powerful debater&#8230;He began to think as to what was the best method of overthrowing Jainism. At last he came to the conclusion that preaching and holding discussions with the Jainis were the best methods to put down Jainism. With this object in view he went to Ujjain (in Central India). King Sudhanwa then ruled there&#8230;He went to the king and said &#8220;You have read the Jain books as well as Sanskrit, and also believe in the Jain Religion. I, therefore ask you to arrange a discussion between the exponents of the Jain religion and myself on the condition that the vanquished party should embrace the religion of the victor and that you should also accept his faith&#8230;For ten years he toured all over the country, refuted Jainism and advocated the Vedic religion. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">All the broken images that are now-a-days dug out of the earth were broken in the time of Shankar</span>, whilst those that are found whole here and there under the ground had been buried by the Jainis for fear of their being broken (by those who had renounced Jainism)&#8230;At that time this country was very rich, and its people were also patriotic. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Shankar, King Sudhanwa and other kings had not had the Jain temples pulled down as they intended to establish schools therein to teach the Vedas and other Shaastras</span>.&#8221; <strong>Satyarth Prakash, by Swami Dayanand Sasarwati, Ch 11, page 345-7, Tr.

<p>As per Dayanand, Shankaracharya and Sudhanva did not demolish Jain temples because they had intended to use them for the teaching of the Vedas. This means if they had infrastructure they would&#8217;ve demolished it. This is clear proof of how non-Hindu worship places were appropriated by Hindus. Swami Dayanand writes that Jainism had once prevailed in India,</p>
<p>&#8220;The Jainees differ from them. Mahavira and Gautama Gandharas (lords of hosts) are called Buddhas by the Buddhists, while they have been named Ganthara and Kinavara by the Jainees. Raja Shiva Prashad whose forefathers have been Jaiinees for generations together writes in their Chapter of his book called Itihas Timirnashak that Jina lived altogether about 1,000 years before Swami Shankarcharya. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The Buddhist or the Jain religion prevailed in the whole of Bharatavarsha (India)</span>. He then adds the following footnote. &#8220;By the term Bauddha (Buddhist religion) we mean that anti-Vedic religion which prevailed in all India from the time of Gandhar Mahavir, or Gautama Swami to that of Swami Shankar&#8221;<strong> Satyarth Prakash, by Swami Dayanand, Ch 12, p.524, Tr.

<p>Madhavacharya also wrote that Buddhism and Jainism dominated India,</p>
<p>&#8220;The land became full of Buddhists, and the adherents of the Vedas dwindled. So I planned to overcome these Buddhists and re-establish the dominance of the Vedic religion. Their leaders, along with the disciples, have been going about converting all kings to their faith and instigating them to reject the Vedas&#8230;[Kumarila said] I recognise you as an incarnation of Guha born for the eradication of Buddhists.&#8221; <strong>Sankara Dig Vijaya 7.77-106, by Madhavacharya, Tr. Swami Tapasyanand</strong></p>
<p>He also wrote about ending Buddhism and Jainism,</p>
<p>&#8220;Thus did the king, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">whom Skanda (Kumarila) converted, free the country from the menace of Buddhists and Jains</span>, just as the obstacles in the path of Yoga are eradicated by a wise sage. And simultaneously, just as the light of the rising sun obliterates the darkness of night, the preachings of the Vedic truth by that Brahmana sage reversed the pace of the ignorance produced by the heretical teachings. When the elephants of Jaina and Buddhist heretics disappeared because of the roaming lion of Kumarila, the tree of Vedic wisdom began to spread everywhere with luxuriant foliage. As the fire-born Kumarila was thus resuscitating the Vedic path of Karma, Lord Siva condescended to be born in order to save the world floundering in the ocean of transmigratory existence.&#8221; <strong>Sankara Dig Vijaya 1.95-98, by Madhavacharya, Tr. Swami Tapasyanand</strong></p>
<p>There is a story mentioned in Skanda Purana about a king who embraced Jainism. And was later forced to reconvert to Hinduism by the Brahmins. The text depicts Jainism negatively. Kumarapala (1143-1172 A.D) was a Shaivite king and he was converted to Jainism by the Jain saint named Acharya Hemachandra. King Kumarapala stopped appeasing the Brahmins, he forbade animal slaughter which was part of Vedic Yajna (sacrifices), and he took away their authority and possessions so they went away from the kingdom and resided elsewhere. Kumarapala stripping the Brahmins off their authority is what irked the Brahmins and was the main cause of all these things. Then another king who was the father-in-law of Kumarapala summoned them and inquired about everything and told them to go to Kumarpala and to ask him to return their possession. Kumarapala refused and criticized the Vedic sacrifices that includes slaughtering animals and all. This angered the Brahmins, so after praying to Hanuman they received a talisman that was hair (purportedly of Hanuman) and threw it in the palace which burnt everything, the Jain mendicants fled for their lives.</p>
<p>Skanda Purana III.ii.36.46-62 &#8220;&#8230;They came to the brave king Ama stationed in Kanyakubja, who was surrounded by heretics. After arriving at the city of Kanyakubja, O king, they stayed for a few days on the banks of Ganga. Those Modha Brahmanas became tired. The king was informed by spies and they were brought to his presence&#8230;Even as the Brahmanas were standing, he asked all of them,&#8217;O Brahmanas, tell (it now) why you have come. What is the matter?&#8217; The Brahmanas said: O king, we have come here from Dharmaranya to you. (It is) your son-in-law Kumarapala (Kumbhipala in v43) by whom the edict of authority of the Brahmanas, which was wonderful, has been destroyed. He has done so, because he follows the Jaina cult and has been instigated by Indrasuri&#8230;On hearing the words of the Brahmanas, the king, spoke to them: &#8216;You all may go quickly and at my behest say to King Kumarapala: Return the settlement of the Brahmanas to them.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Skanda Purana III.ii.36.34-38 &#8220;On hearing this straight from his preceptor, the powerful ruler of Kanyakubja named Ama continued to rule the kingdom. He became an emperor and was keen in protecting the subjects. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Due to the advent of Kali, the subjects became inclined to commit sins. Inciting by Ksapanas (Buddhist mendicants) and following their instructions</span>, the subjects gave up their Vaisnava cult and adopted the Buddhist way of life. [46] All the different castes were converted to Jaina cult. Brahmanas were not honoured. No religious rites like Santika and Paustika were performed. No one ever used to perform charity. Time passed like this.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>People committing sins embraced Buddhism and Jainism. So people embracing other religions like Buddhism and Jainism is seen negatively here, it says that people were inclined to commit sins and the very next line talks about those people converting to Buddhism and Jainism.</p>
<p>King Kumarapala replied to them,</p>
<p>Skanda Purana III.ii.36.62 &#8220;[Kumarapala said] O Brahmanas, I shall not abide and honour the Royal Charter issued by Rama. I disown the Brahmanas who indulge in violence and kill animals in Yajna. There is no question of my having any respect for and devotion to these killers.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Kumarapala had embraced the Jain religion. And then this happened,</p>
<p>Skanda Purana III.ii.38.14-24 &#8220;[The king said] May all of you go where Rama and Hanuman are staying. Rama will give everything. What for did you come here, O Brahmanas? I will never give. I will never give even a Varatika (a cowrie); no village and no means of livelihood. Go wherever it pleases you. On hearing the terrible words, the Brahmanas were excited with anger. They said, &#8216;Well, suffer the anger of Rama and Hanuman now.&#8217; After saying this, they threw down the packet of hair from the left armpit given by Hanuman in the abode of the kind. The excellent Brahmanas then retired. When the group of the Brahmanas departed, the whole place was ablaze with columns of flames. Everything became full of flames of fire. All the royal paraphernalia got enveloped in fire: the umbrellas, the chowries, the treasury rooms, the arsenals etc. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The queens, the princes, the elephants and many horses, the vehicles and conveyances of all sorts all were completely burning</span>&#8230;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Seeing everything burnt down, the naked Jaina mendicants, trembling again and again, took in their hands their pots, auspicious sticks, red blankets and without shoes or sandals fled away to ten directions</span>.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>For the fear of being killed by the Brahmins&#8217; talisman the King Kumarpala as well as his subjects who had resorted to Jainism reverted to Vaishnavite Hinduism and the authority of Brahmins was reinstated by the king,</p>
<p>Skanda Purana III.ii.38.30-48 &#8220;The king ran on foot here and there alone and lamenting enquired, &#8216;Where are the Brahmanas?&#8217; On hearing from the people, the king went to that place where the Brahmanas (were resting). O king after going there suddenly, he caught hold immediately of the feet of the Brahmanas. The king fell down unconscious. Repeating the name of the son of Dasaratha, &#8216;Rama, Rama&#8217;, the king with deep humility spoke these words to the Brahmanas: &#8216;I am the servant of the servant of that Rama and of Brahmanas. I had become blind through the darkness of ignorance&#8230;Whatever you desire, I shall grant it. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Devotion to Brahmanas as well as to Rama should (will) always be engaged in by me</span>. I shall never do anything other than these, O Brahmanas.&#8217; On that occasion, O king, the Brahmanas became merciful. In order to quell the curse, they threw the other packet. When the hairs were thrown, the army regained life. The quarters became clear and pure&#8230;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">As before, the common people became obedient to Brahmanas. Excepting the Visnu cult, they did not know (i.e. recognize) any other religious belief</span>. A new letter of authority legally binding as before was issued. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Heretics were banished, duly making the scripture hold good. Those outside the pale of the Vedas including the good, the middling and the lowly disappeared</span>&#8230;&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Now I shall ask all those Hindus who say that Buddhism and Jainism are accepted in Hinduism if so then why did people converting to Jainism irked the Brahmins? Why do Hindu scriptures talk so negatively about Jainism? Hemchandra also died after he lost a debate as Brahmins had made it a custom to burn Buddhists and Jain scholars after defeating them in debates. There is a different version that Kumarpala embraced Shaivism, eminent historian Romila Thapar wrote,</p>
<p>&#8220;A sixteenth century text narrates that Hemachandra was defeated in a debate and sentenced to death whereupon Kumarapala reconverted to Shaivism.&#8221; <strong>Somnath: The many voices of a history, by Romila Thapar, p.116, Published by Penguin books, 2008.</strong></p>
<p>Romila Thapar cited the reference of Gadadhara, Sampradaya Pradipa, quoted in A.K. Majumdar, Chalukyas of Gujarat, p.329 ff.</p>
<p>Kumarapala&#8217;s nephew and also his successor Ajayapala is said to have demolished many Jain temples, Romila Thapar wrote,</p>
<p>&#8220;It is strange that the brahmans did not ask Hanuman for a talisman against the Turks. Kumarapala&#8217;s successor, Ajayapla, is said to have desecrated Jaina temples and looted others and supported the Shaiva religion. His son, also a zealous Shaiva, worshipped at the Somanatha.&#8221;- <strong>Somnath: The many voices of a history, by Romila Thapar, p.116, Published by Penguin books, 2008</strong></p>
<p>Another historian wrote,</p>
<p>&#8220;However, Ajaypala, nephew and successor of Kumarpala was a Saivite. He subjucated Jains. Mihirakula ended the Gupta kingdom c. 480 CE. He was considered as an opponent by the Jains because he created policies to subjucate Jainism.&#8221; Glasenapp 1999, p. 52, as mentioned in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Jainism" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Jainism<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>&#8220;According to the Prabandhachintarnani Ajayapala destroyed the Jain temples built by his uncle. He showed no favour to Ambada and Kumzirapala&#8217;s other Jain ministers&#8221; <strong>Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency: pt. 1.

<p>Hindus have started a new trend of blaming Muslims, Hindus are blaming Muslims for the caste system, They say that Sati Pratha was also due to Muslims despite the fact that their scriptures encourage Sati Pratha, They also claim that child marriage in India is also because of Muslims even when Swami Vivekananda refuted this claim, they blame foreigners for almost every evil of their religion. And they also blame Muslims for the fall of Buddhism in India. It&#8217;s true that some Muslim conquerors may have been cruel towards Buddhists like the demolition of Nalanda but this cannot be taken as Muslims annihilated Buddhists, do Hindus mean to say that the demolition of Nalanda annihilated Buddhists from India? An important question is If Muslims wiped out Buddhism from India then why did they spare Hinduism? Hindus have their answer ready, they claim that Hindus defended the religion. But who really defended it? Even Hindu rulers who are considered &#8216;brave warriors&#8217; by Hindutvadis were defeated by Muslims. Prithviraj Chauhan couldn&#8217;t fight the army of Muhammad Ghori so he had to make an alliance with neighboring Rajpur kings and lost the second battle, Maharana Pratap lost the war against Mughal in which the commander was a Rajput, Shivaji was captured by Mughals and escaped and never had the courage to fight in a war and resorted to guerilla tactics. His son Sambhaji was executed by the Mughals, Marathas lost the third Panipat war, and Rana Sanga lost to Babur. Muslims reached Deccan India within the 13<sup>th</sup> century and ruled till Britishers invaded India. So Hindu rulers should have repelled the Muslim invasion if they were so powerful, but they failed to do so which proves that Muslim rulers overpowered them. Now, these same Hindus spread false information that the Hindu population in Pakistan and Bangladesh has declined in the last 70 years. Imagine if the Hindu population can decline without the government&#8217;s support in 70 years then what could&#8217;ve been done in 800 years by Muslim rulers.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">So why didn&#8217;t Muslim rulers annihilate Hindus like they annihilated Buddhists?</span></p>
<p>The answer is, that Muslims didn&#8217;t annihilate Buddhists and Jains but Hindus did! Buddhism was on its deathbed when Muslims arrived in India. This was because of the systematic persecution of Buddhists and Jains by Hindu rulers and scholars. Genocide of Buddhists and Jains started many centuries before Muslims arrived in India. Pushyamitra Sunga (185 BC-149 BC) had persecuted thousands of Buddhist monks and demolished many Stupas and Viharas. Hindus love to quote Dr. B.R. Ambedkar on this issue. Dr. Ambedkar wrote articles on the persecution of Buddhists by Hindus but Hindus prefer to quote the last line wherein he blames Muslim invaders for <span style="text-decoration: underline;">giving a death blow to Buddhism in India</span>. Vinay Lal a Professor of History and Asian American Studies at UCLA wrote,</p>
<p>&#8220;On this view, Buddhism found competition in Islam for converts among low-caste Hindus. Even Ambedkar, whose animosity towards Hinduism is palpable, was nonetheless firmly of the view that Islam dealt Buddhism a death blow. As he was to put it, &#8220;brahmanism beaten and battered by the Muslim invaders could look to the rulers for support and sustenance and get it. Buddhism beaten and battered by the Muslim invaders had no such hope. It was uncared for orphan and it withered in the cold blast of the native rulers and was consumed in the fire lit up by the conquerors.&#8221; Ambedkar was quite certain that this was &#8220;the greatest disaster that befell the religion of Buddha in India.&#8221; We thus find Ambekdar embracing the &#8220;sword of Islam thesis&#8221;: &#8220;The sword of Islam fell heavily upon the priestly class. It perished or it fled outside India. Nobody remained alive to keep the flame of Buddhism burning.&#8221; [3] There are, of course, many problems with this view. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The &#8220;sword of Islam&#8221; thesis remains controversial, at best, and many reputable historians are inclined to dismiss it outright</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Islam was, moreover, a late entrant into India, and Buddhism was showing unmistakable signs of its decline long before Islam became established in the Gangetic plains, central India, and the northern end of present-day Andhra and Karnataka</span>.&#8221; &#8211; Buddhism&#8217;s Disappearance from India, by Vinay Lal <a href="https://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/southasia/Religions/paths/BuddhismDisappear.doc" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">https://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/southasia/Religions/paths/BuddhismDisappear.doc<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>As Vinay Lal rightly pointed out, Buddhism had already declined long before the advent of Muslims in India hence Muslim rulers cannot be blamed for the disappearance of Buddhism in India. As Hindu fanatics are very fond of quoting one line of Dr. Ambedkar out of context, Let me quote some passages on the persecution of Buddhists and Jains written by Dr. Ambedkar&#8217;s followers,</p>
<p>&#8220;Formerly a feudatory of Chalukya, Dantidurga was the founder of Rastrakuta dynasty, a strong, aggresive and militant supporter of Brahmanism. Cave XV at Ellora called Dasavtara, which has a long undated inscription of Dantidurga carved on its entrance, was originally a Buddhist Vihara, which was converted to Brrahmanic Temple, by chiseling out Buddhist images. [Yazdani G., &#8216;Early History of Deccan&#8217;, Oxford Univ. Press, 1960, p.731]
<p>&#8220;Damodarvarman, who is regarded predecessor of Attivarman, was devotee of Samyak Sambuddha. The Kapoteswara temple at Chezarla of fourth century was a originally a chaitya hall later converted into a brahmanic temple. He is described as son of king who performed Hiranyagarbha mahadana. Attivarman, worshiper of Sambhu, performed this mahadana. [D. C. Sarkar, &#8216;Classical age&#8217; p.202 ff.]
<p>&#8220;For it was in the Dark Age that religious persecution began in India. Monasteries were demolished, monks were banished, and books were burnt: and wherever the Rajputs became rulers, Buddhist edifices went down and Hindu temples arose. By the end of the 10th century, Buddhism was practically stamped out from India, and the work of destruction was completed by the Muslims who succeeded the Rajputs as masters of India.&#8221; [Epochs of Indian History, by R. C. Dutt]

<p>&#8220;&#8230; Under his (Sankara&#8217;s) very supervision, the Buddhist, their statues and monument at Nagarjunakonda were destroyed. A.H. Longhurst, who conducted excavations at Nagarjunkonda, has recorded it in his invaluable book: &#8216;Memoir of the Archaeological Survey of India&#8217; No.54, The Buddhist Antiquities of Nagarjunkonda, by A.H.Longhurst, Delhi, 1938, p.6.</p>
<p>&#8220;The ruthless manner in which all the buildings at Nagarjunakonda have been destroyed is simply appalling and cannot represent the work of treasure seekers alone as so many of the pillars, statues, and sculptures have been wantonly smashed to pieces. Had there been a town close at hand a Amaravati, one can understand the site being used as a quarry by modern builders as was so often done in India. But this never occurred at Nagarjunakonda as there are no towns and no cart roads in or out of the valley. Local tradition relates that the great Hindu philosopher and teacher Shankaracharya of medieval times came to Nagarjunakonda with a host of followers and destroyed the Buddhist monument. Be this as it may, the fact remains that the cultivated lands in the valley on which ruined buildings stand represent a religious grant made to Shankaracharya and it was only with the sanction of the present religious Head of the followers of the great teacher that I was to conduct the excavations. This same Brahmin pontiff, who resides at Pushpagiri in the Guntur District, also owns the Srisailam temple in the Nallamalais, which no doubt was acquired in the same manner as it seems to have been a Buddhist site originally.&#8221; [Bhagwan K.S.: 1986: 14]

<p>Historians discover a Jain inscription at Quilashpur<br />
Speaking on this discovery, Mr Reddy said, “Stones one foot tall and two feet wide were used for the construction of this wall. During the Kakatiya rule, Jainism was opposed and Shaivism came to prominence. As result, all the Jain temples, basadis, inscriptions etc., were destroyed. Remnants of these temples can still be seen at several places within the perimeter of this village. These remnants were used for the construction of this fort. Along with this inscription, several stones with Jain symbols are also found on the wall.”<br />

<p>Buddhist religious scriptures such as the Asokavadana allege that the first Shunga king Pusyamitra (an orthodox Brahmin) was hostile towards Buddhists and persecuted the Buddhist faith. Buddhist wrote that he &#8221;destroyed monasteries and killed monks&#8221; 84000 Buddhists stupas which had been built by Asoka were destroyed (R. Thaper), and 100 gold coins were offered for the head of each Buddhist monk. In addition Buddhist dources allege that a large number of Buddhist monasteries (Viharas) were converted to Hindu temples, in such places as Nalanda, Bodhgaya, Sarnath, or Mathura. More overt forms of Hindu hostility to Buddhism also played a role&#8230;There were episodes of Hindu persecution of Buddhists starting in the 6th century. Furthermore, the Buddha was described as an incarnation of the god Vishnu, who came to earth to delude demons (or people depending on the text) into denying the authority of the Vedas, in order to lead them to Hell. Shankara, the great Hindu philosopher and reformer, described the Buddha as an enemy of the people{17}.- Light from the East: Eastern Wisdom for the Modern West pg 192, By Harry Oldmeadow</p>
<p>&#8220;84,000 Buddhist stupas which had been built by Ashoka were &#8220;destroyed&#8221; (R. Thaper), and 100 gold coins were offered for the head of each Buddhist monk (Indian Historical Quarterly Vol. XXII, p.81 ff cited in Hars.407, also Divyavadana, p.429-434)</p>
<p>There is also archaeological evidence to prove that Buddhist worship place were destroyed by Pushyamitra Sunga, the Deorkothar Stupa was destroyed by Pushyamitra Sunga which P.K. Mishra (Archaeological Survey of India) discovered Deorkothar in 1982 with Ajit Singh and returned to excavate the site in 1999. <a href="http://archive.archaeology.org/online/news/deorkothar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">http://archive.archaeology.org/online/news/deorkothar/<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>&#8220;The Buddhist accounts are unanimous in representing Pushyamitra Sunga as a persecutor of Buddhism. His persecution started in Magadha where it is said he tried unsuccessfully to destroy the famous Kukkutarama monastery in Ptaliaputra. He went up to Sakala to execute his policy of persecution. There he offered a reward of 100 dinaras for the head of every Buddhist monk. The Buddhist account further tell us that his policy involved him in a war with a Yaksha named Krimisa and ultimately brought about his death at a place called Sthulakostha. This evidence cannot be completely discarded.&#8221; A Comprehensive History of India, Volume 2, p.364, K.

<p>A 15<sup>th</sup> century Lama named Taranatha wrote that many of the Buddhist worship places were restored by another king after the reign of Pushyamitra,</p>
<p>&#8220;It is clear that when he was residing at Sri Parvata these damages were done by the Brahman king Pusyamitra. So this appears to be the begining of the decline (of the Doctorine).<br />
After that, king Phanicandra was ruling in Magadha. During this time, in Gauda of Bhangala in the east, there was the king Gauda Vardhana with great power and wealth. He rebuilt the monasteries previously damaged and thus helped the centres to increase.&#8221; Tāranātha&#8217;s History of Buddhism in India By Tāranātha, Ch 16, p.121, Motilal Banarsidass Publ., 1990</p>
<p>Some Hindus instead of condemning what Pushyamitra did, start defending him just because he was a Hindu. The only reference they furnish is Sanchi and Barhut stupas inscriptions which say &#8216;During the supremacy of Shungas&#8217;. They attribute these to Pushyamitra and cite them as an example of his secularism, but according to historians these were built by his successors,</p>
<p>&#8220;Buddhist stupa at Sanchi, India. (Mark Weiss) destroyed by Pushyamitra and then restored by his successor, Agnimitra. Similarly, N.N. Ghosh (1945) writes that the gateway of Bharhut was built not during the reign of Pushyamitra but by his successors, who followed a more tolerant policy toward Buddhism as compared to Pushyamitra, a leader of Brahmanic reaction. The destruction and burning of the great monastery of Ghositarama at Kaushambi in the second century BC is also attributed to the Sungas. For instance, J.S. Negi (1958) notes that G.R. Sharma, who was responsible for most of the excavation work at Kaushambi, was inclined to connect this phenomenon with the persecution of Buddhism by Pushuamitra.&#8221; Popular Controversies in World History: Investigating History&#8217;s Intriguing Questions [4 volumes]: Investigating History&#8217;s Intriguing Questions, p.97, by Steven L. Danver, ABC-CLIO, 22-Dec-2010</p>
<p>&#8220;Who was responsible for the wanton destruction of the original brick stupa of Ashoka and when precisely the great work of reconstruction was carried out is not known, but it seems probable that the author of the former was Pushyamitra, the first of the Shunga kings (184-148 BC), who was notorious for his hostility to Buddhism, and that the restoration was affected by Agnimitra or his immediate successor.&#8221; in John Marshall, A Guide to Sanchi, p. 38. Calcutta: Superintendent, Government Printing (1918).</p>
<p>No matter how much Hindutvadis defend Pushyamitr Sunga, Buddhist sources and archaeological evidence proves that he indeed persecuted Buddhists and destroyed their worship places. Another persecutor of Buddhists was Shaivite king Mihirakulu,</p>
<p>&#8220;The extensive landed property put at the disposal of the Buddhist institutions by emperor Kanisha, was confiscated by the new oppressive regimes to strengthen the Brahminic hegemony. The persecution of the Buddhists and destruction of their institutions began in the sixth century by the tyrant Mihirakulu were on a mass scale.&#8221; A social history of India By S. N. Sadasivan p.238, APH Publishing, 01-Jan-2000</p>
<p>&#8220;A patron of Shaivism (worship of the Hindu god Shiva), Mihirakula is recorded in Buddhist tradition as having been uncouth and extremely cruel.&#8221; <a href="http://www.britannica.com/biography/Mihirakula" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">http://www.britannica.com/biography/Mihirakula<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>&#8220;The greatest of royal persecutors of Buddhism in India was the Huna tryant Mihirakulu (Mahiragula). His sacrilegious acts against Buddhism are recorded by Kalhana and corroborated by Hsun-tsang and the Manjusrimulakalpa. The Kashmir historian compares Mihirakula with Yama, the god of death, for the former&#8217;s atrocities. At one place Kalhana remarks: &#8216;One&#8217;s tongue would become polluted if one attempted to record his cruelties and evil deeds in detail. From this authority we learn that Mihirakula patronized brahmanas, worshipped Siva, and erected a temple of Siva, called Mihiresvara in Srinagara.&#8221; Studies in the Buddhistic Culture of India During the 7th and 8th Centuries A.D, By Lal Mani Joshi, p.320, Motilal Banarsidass Publ., 1977</p>

<p>Some historians say that Hindus taking advantage of the chaos of invasion burned Nalanda. Read the article <a href="/index.php/2018/06/19/how-shankaracharya-destroyed-buddhism-and-founded-hinduism-in-the-8th-century/" data-wpel-link="internal">How Shankaracharya Destroyed Buddhism</a> for more information. Hindus blame Muslims for the destruction of Nalanda University but they remain mum on destruction of Nalanda by Hindu kings. During the war with Narasimha Gupta, the Hindu Hun king Mihirakula had destroyed Nalanda University. Narasimha Gupta after defeating Mihirakula had rebuilt the institution.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nalanda, no sooner it was founded by Sakraditya and extended by his son Buddhagupta-raja and his successor Tathagatagupta-raja, than was destroyed by Mihirakula&#8230;As to the second part, viz., &#8220;much blood will be split&#8221;, we have got archaeological evidence to show that Nalanda was destroyed more than once&#8230;&#8221; <strong>The University of Nalanda, p.43, by Hasmukh D.

<p>The author Hasmukh Dhirajlal Sankalia was an Indian Sanskrit scholar and archaeologist specialising in proto- and ancient Indian history. Mihirakula had not just demolished Buddhist Nalanda but had also uprooted Bodh Gaya tree under which Buddha used to meditate, but we rarely see Hindu radicals talking about these historical events as these don’t suit their vested interests. The destruction of Nalanda University by Hindu king Mihirakula is also mentioned in the book The Journal of the Bihar and Orissa Research Society, vol. 14, part 1, p.8-9, Published by the Bihar and Orissa Research Society, 1928, Printed by the Supreintendent, Government Printing, Bihar and Orissa. It is also worth noting that no modern books mention these atrocities by Hindu kings in the ancient period.</p>

<p><strong>Persecution of Jain at the hands of Basava Lingayat (Shaivite sub-sect) founder.</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;At the turn of the 12th century, followers of a revolutionary religious movement, Virashaivism (literally, heroic Shaivism), employed architectural reuse among other things to signal their triumph over Jainism, a rival religion.<br />
The founder of Virashaivism, Basava (initially a Shaiva Brahmin), was the chief minister of the Kalachuri king Bijjala, a staunch Jain with his capital at Kalyana in modern day Karnataka. The Basava Purana, a long hagiography dedicated to Basava narrates that not only did he successfully plot a regicide, but also sanctified violence against Jains, in rather gruesome ways such as putting “a sharp spear on the skulls of Jains&#8221;. Such an ideology fell in line with Virashaivism’s idea of opposing the caste system and ostentatious rituals, tenets that made the new religion popular with the masses in no time. Being the religion dominating Karnataka in the early medieval era, Jainism took the greatest hit and saw a sharp fall in its following.<br />
Apart from vying for political patronage, the Lingayats (followers of Virashaivism) also started appropriating and converting Jaina basadis (shrines) into Virashaiva temples, an act that not only signified Virashaiva strength, but was also a practical necessity for a nascent religion with not enough resources to build a new temple from scratch.<br />
Accordingly, as Julia Hegewald argues in her paper on temple conversions in Karnataka, the Lingayats appropriated and reused the Doddappa Temple at Adargunchi, Karnataka. Built sometime between 10th and 11th centuries, the temple today is fronted by a stone sculpture of the bull Nandi (Shiva’s vehicle) and houses a massive black stone statue of a Jina, placed alongside a Shiva linga (phallus, the form in which Lingayats worship Shiva).<br />
Save the image of the Jina, the entire temple was extensively rebuilt during the Virashaiva takeover of the basadi. Instead of destroying/mutilating the Jina statue, it was retained and painted with parallel white lines on the forehead, arms, shoulders and chest, an imitation in paint of the sacred white ash the Virashaivas often smear themselves with. The idea was to retain the statue as a “sign of domination and control” thereby sending a clear signal of Virashaiva’s triumph over Jainism.<br />
Another interesting example of such a reuse comes from the Megudi temple at Hallur, Karnataka. Here, as opposed to Aadargunchi, the temple was converted in situ, sans any extensive rebuilding.<br />
Constructed between the 7th and 9th centuries, the Megudi temple was reused as a Virashaiva shrine sometime in the 12th century. Here the Jina idol was uprooted from garbagriha, smeared with sacred Virashaiva ash, and placed in the central aisle that now leads to the sanctum sanctorum housing the Shiva linga. Such a placement of uprooted idol ensured that every devotee approaching the inner chamber would see the displaced Jina and be aware of the Virashaiva “annexation” of the temple.<br />
To further bolster the “conquered image” of the temple, two sculptures of the Jina adorning the main entrance have also been significantly disfigured even though all the other sculptures, inside and outside the temple, have been kept intact. Appropriations, as glaring as the above mentioned examples, must have inspired significant awe in the newly converted followers of Virashaivism and deep anxiety in the Jains.</p>

<p>&#8220;Scholars agreed that the inner first and second galleries, which contain narrative panels depicting Hindu scences, might have been carved at a later time possibly during the reign of Jayavarman VIII (r. 1243-1295) who was a bigoted Hindu king to have reputedly converted the Bayon into a Hindu temple and also damaged many other Buddhist buildings.&#8221; Roveda 1998: 131-150 as mentioned in Buddhist Architecture, By Le Huu Phuoc, p.263, Grafikol, 2010</p>

<p>&#8220;Not only theoretically did the Hindus attack Buddhism, but the hundreds of Buddhist monks were slaughtered, their temples destroyed and &#8221;the massacre of thousands of Bhuddist families was ordered by the sixth century c.e, Hindu king&#8221; Mihirakulu.[Heritage of Kashmir pg 58 by Muhammad Amin Pandit ]&#8221; Numerous Buddhist temples were taken over by the Brahmins, the most prominent being the shrine of Pas Pahar atop the Takht i Sulaiman overlooking the Dal Lake in Srinagar, Which was renamed the Shankaracharya temple and was dedicated to Jyesteswara or Shiva. The HIndu King Nara is said to have burnt down thousands of (Buddhist) Viharas [Islamic culture in Kashmir p.43, By G.M.D. Sofi]. Brahmanical hostility against the Buddhists persisted even in the period of Muslim rule. Thus, we learn that Udayagiri, the Brahmin Prime minister of Sultan Shahabuddin suggested to the king that to overcome his fiscal crisis he should loot the Buddhist temples and melt their idols to make coins. The King, however, responded with &#8221;indignation at this suggestion.&#8221;[Islamic culture in Kashmir p.139, By G.M.D. Sofi] But on the other hand, Muslim rulers allowed religious freedom and some of them even collected &#8221;books on the puranas, logic and Mimansa from different parts of India at considerable expense. These books were placed at the disposal of the scholars.

<p>&#8220;Shri K. R. Srinivasan has confirmed that what is now known as Anantasayangudi cave temple in Undavali was a temple of Vishnukundin times and originally a Buddhist temple which was converted to a Vishnu temple. [p. 33 and 81, &#8216;Temples of South India&#8217;] <a href="http://www.ambedkar.org/research/Rajput_Period_Was_Dark_Age_Of_India.htm" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">http://www.ambedkar.org/research/Rajput_Period_Was_Dark_Age_Of_India.htm<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>&#8220;Buddhist shrines were converted into Brahmincal ones, and Brahmincal legends called Kshetra Puranas, were engrafted on the Buddhist legends, and found a place in the Brahmanda and Skanda Puranas. Gayu, Bhuvaneswari, Sanchi, Puri, all come under the same category. Coming to Southern India, we have the well known places Tirupati and Conjeceram abaring in the same fate, the Buddhist phase of Tirupati having been an image of Padmapani, the Padma (lotus) being now covered by a Kavaeha (Sheath), while the image itself is passing by the name of Srinivasn. This fact was first known about 1850 to the employes in the inner part of the temple, when some parts of the Kaveha haing become too much loosened, had to undergo repairs. The real nature was at once discovered. But the matter was kept a profounf secret. Now are the Saiva temples of Conjeveram any way better; Conheveram, which had during the time of Hioun Thsand so many as 10000 Buddhist Bhikshus and about 100 Sangharanas, had its Sangharamas converted in the course of three following centuries into Saiva temples during the reign of Saiva kings. Even to day, a Jaina Buddhist temple is seen in a village two miles off, but which once formed part of it with a number of Jains living there and a large number of Buddhist statues are scattered about in the Saiva temples. The history of Indian temples architecture shows that most of these temples the exceptions are very few have undergone three stages: first, they were Buddhistic, then they became Saivite, ad lastly they were Vaishnava temples.&#8221; The Theosophist May 1891 to September 1891 By H.

<p>&#8220;According to Dr. Jayaprakash, a number of Buddha statues have been discovered at places like Ambalapuzha, Karunagapalli, Pallickal, Bharanikkavu, Mavelikara and Neelamperur in Kerala. &#8216;They are either in the form of smashed pieces or thrown away from viharas. Lord Ayyappa of Sabarimala and Lord Padmanabha at Thiruvananthapuram are the proxy images of Buddha being worshipped as Vishnu. Hundreds of Buddhists were killed on the banks of Aluva river. The term &#8216;Aluva&#8217; was derived from &#8216;Alawai&#8217; which means &#8216;Trisul&#8217;, a weapon used by Hindu fanatics to stab Buddhists. Similarly, on the banks of the Vaigai river in Tamilnadu, thousands of Buddhists were killed by the Vaishnava Saint, Sambanthar. Thevaram, a Tamil book, documents this brutal extermination of Buddhism.&#8217; <a href="http://www.milligazette.com/Archives/15042001/Art06.htm" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">http://www.milligazette.com/Archives/15042001/Art06.htm<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">HINDU KINGS PLUNDERING HINDU TEMPLES</span></strong></p>
<p>Muslim rulers like Mahmud Ghazni looting Somnath is seen as religious extremism but what will Hindutvadis call this?</p>
<p>&#8220;There are instances of Hindu rulers destroying temples in order to loot their wealth, such as Harshadeva of Kashmir, who defiled and looted temples and even had a special officer whose function was to seize the icons of tribal shine, and in Bodhgaya a Buddhist Vihara was destroyed by Sasanka in the 6th C to build a Hindu temple which still exists.&#8221; Sampradayikta Virodhi Andolan, Black Sunday. December 1992 p.2 as mentioned in Religion und Gewalt: Konflikte, Rituale, Deutungen (1500-1800), edited by Kaspar von Greyerz, Kim Siebenhüner, p.72, Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 2006</p>
<p>Harsha, a ruler of Kashmir (1089-1111AD), plundered all the temples in his own kingdom, barring four, in order to replenish his treasury, and not a word of protest was uttered. He destroyed both Hindu and Buddhist temples, and is credited with creating an office of &#8220;devotpaatana-nayaka&#8221;, destroyer of gods. Reference &#8221; Rajatarangini&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;The plunder of temples was carried out by kings irrespective of their religion. Temples were repositories of wealth. An ideological fig leaf was taken from religion to justify the desecration. Temples were plundered by the Marathas in Tipu&#8217;s Sultante. The Shirangapatanam temple was destroyed by the Maratha armies and was repaired by Tipu Sultan. Attacking the temple was also a way of Humiliting the other kings&#8230; Temples were also looted by ing Harsha of kashmir in the 11th century. A mention of this is found in Kalhan&#8217;s book Rajtarangini, which syas that he appointed a special officer to uproot the golden idols from the temples. This offiver was designated as devotpatan naya&#8217;s (officer who uproots the Gods). Parmar Kings (Shubharvarnman a.d 1193-1210) destroyed Jain temples in Cambay and Dabhoi in addition to plundering temples in his own kingdom.&#8221; Communal Politics: Fact versus Myth, p.52, By Ram Puniyani</p>
<p>&#8220;642 AD: Pallava king Narasimhavarman I looted the image of Ganesha from the Chalukyan capital of Vatapi (present day Badami in Belgaum dist.)</p>
<p>692 AD: Chalukyas invaded North India and brought back to the Deccan what would appear to be images of Ganga and Yamuna looted from defeated powers.</p>
<p>8th century AD: Bengali troops sought revenge on King Lalithaditya&#8217;s kingdom in Kashmir by destroying what they thought was an image of Vaikunta the state deity of Kashmir kingdom.</p>
<p>9th century AD: Rashtrakuta king Govinda III invaded and occupied Kanchipuram which so intimidated the King of Sri Lanka that he sent Govinda (probably Buddhist) images representing the Sinhala state.</p>
<p>Rashtrakuta king Indira III not only destroyed the temple of Kalapriya at Kalpa near the Jamuna river, patronized by their deadly enemies, the Pratiharas, but they took special delight in recording the fact.</p>
<p>9th century AD: Pandyan King Srimara Srivallabha also invaded Sri Lanka and took back to his capital golden Buddha image.</p>
<p>Early 10th century, Pratihara King, Hermabapala, seized solid gold image of Vishnu Vaikunta when he defeated the Sahi kings of Kangra (Himachal Pradesh)</p>
<p>Early 11th century: Chola King, Rajendra I furnished his capital with images he seized from several prominent neighbouring kings: Durga and Ganesha images from the Chalukyas, Bhairava, Bhairavi and Kali images from the Kalingas or Orissa as Nandi image from the Eastern Chalukyans.&#8221;<br />

<h2><a id="zoroastrianism"></a>Intolerance towards Zoroastrianism</h2>
<p>There is no direct reference made to Zoroastrianism in Hindu scriptures. But in the Vedas, the Asuras are depicted as villains, in Zoroastrian text Ahura is god and in the Vedas Asuras are demons. In Vedas, Devas are gods while in Zoroastrian text Daevas are demons. Zoroastrian text also speaks about the Aryan country. This suggests that Vedic religion and Zoroastrianism are approximate of the same age and there was a war between Aryans and Zoroastrians. Vedas speaks about killing the Asuras, and Zoroastrian texts also speak about killing Daevas by thousands. Zoroastrian text speaks of several Daevas but not all those Daevas are mentioned in Vedas. Daeva in Zoroastrianism may mean all evils and not just the Aryans. Only a few Devas (Vedic gods) like Mitra, Yama, Indra, etc., can be found in both Vedas and Zoroastrian texts, but these gods are viewed as heroes in the Zoroastrian text who sided with the Zoroastrians against Aryans. I won&#8217;t indulge further on this topic as it is related to the Aryan invasion/migration and a separate article would be appropriate to discus this.</p>
<p>As the proverb goes &#8216;History is written by the victors&#8217;. Learning about Asuras and Devas in Vedas would be one-sided we have to look at the other side also to get a better understanding of what really may have happened. Asuras are demonized and depicted like villains in the Vedas, but are the Devas depicted as heroes in Zoroastrian texts? Let&#8217;s have a look at some Zoroastrian verses,</p>
<p>Ushtavad Gatha, Yasna 44 verse 20 &#8220;I ask Thee, O Mazda, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">How it is possible for the Daevas to become kind severance, the persons who fight for their selfish ends and for satisfying their wishes. The have flung all earth to hatred and anger</span> with the help of Kavis, Karapans and Usikhsh (2). Would they ever strive to cause the advance and security of the world through Asha and bring about peace and love for all.&#8221; Tr. Mobed Firouz Azargoshasb</p>
<p>Ahunuvaita Gatha Yasna 30 Verse 6 &#8220;The followers of Daeva (or Devil worshippers) did not choose the right path, because they were in doubt and were deceived. Hence, they did not choose the right path but followed the worst thought, the devil or anger, which is the cause of all evil deeds, so as to destroy the mental life of the people.&#8221; Tr. Mobed Firouz Azargoshasb</p>
<p>Yasna 12.4 &#8220;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">I reject the authority of the Daevas, the wicked, no-good, lawless, evil-knowing, the most druj-like of beings, the foulest of beings, the most damaging of beings</span>. I reject the Daevas and their comrades, I reject the yatu and their comrades; <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">I reject any who harm beings</span>. I reject them with my thoughts, words, and deeds. I reject them publicly. Even as I reject the [evil authorities], so too do I reject the hostile followers of the druj.&#8221; Tr. J.H. Peterson</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Daevas were oppressors</span></strong></p>
<p>Frawardin Yasht 13.57 &#8220;We worship the good, strong, beneficent Fravashis of the faithful, who showed their paths to the stars, the moon, the sun, and the endless lights, that had stood before for a long time in the same place, without moving forwards, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">through the oppression of the Daevas and the assaults of the Daevas</span>.&#8221; Tr. James Darmesteter</p>
<p>Frawardin Yasht 13.130 &#8220;We worship the Fravashi of the holy Yima, the son of Vivanghant; the valiant Yima, who had flocks at his wish; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">to stand against the oppression caused by the Daevas</span>, against the drought that destroys pastures, and against death that creeps unseen.&#8221; Tr. James Darmesteter</p>
<p>Aban Yasht 5.58 &#8220;They begged of her a boon, saying: &#8220;Grant us this, O good, most beneficent Ardvi Sura Anahita! that we may overcome the valiant warrior Tusa, and that we may smite of the Aryan people their fifties and their hundreds, their hundreds and their thousands, their thousands and their tens of thousands, their tens of thousands and their myriads of myriads.&#8221; Tr. James Darmesteter</p>
<p>Warharan Yasht 14.60 &#8220;That I may be as constantly victorious as any one of all the Aryans; that I may smite this army, that I may smite down this army, that I may cut in pieces this army that is coming behind me.&#8221; Tr. James Darmesteter</p>

<h2><a id="dasyus"></a>Intolerance towards Dasyus</h2>
<p>When you read the Vedas you will find that there were other tribes also in the Vedic period who followed different religions and customs. And many times Aryans used to attack them mainly for the purpose of plundering them which is evident from the plunder and massacre of Kikata and Panis tribes which I have mentioned in <a href="https://vedkabhed.wordpress.com/2014/05/15/killing-infidels-in-vedas/" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Killing infidels in Vedas<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> article. Yaska Acharya defines Dasyu as,</p>
<p>Nirukta 7.23 Dasyu (demon) is derived from (the root) das, meaning to lay waste.</p>
<p>Swami Dayanand Saraswati defines Dasyu as wicked one. Veda says that the Dasyus followed a different religion, they did not sacrifice, and they are also called godless. Maybe they had atheistic philosophies like Buddhists. Veda explicitly commands the Aryans to kill and plunder Dasyus because of the difference in faith. I have used Hindi translations by Pandit Ram Govind Trivedi and Shri Ram Sharma Acharya,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.105.8 Grind off our sins: with song <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">will we conquer the men who sing no hymns</span>: Not easily art thou pleased with prayerless sacrifice.<br />

<p>Dasyus not offering oblation to Vedic gods, not sacrificing, being riteless, without worship and rituals are emphasized, the difference in faith is emphasized in the Vedas which means that one of the main reasons for killing Dasyus was their religion.</p>

<h2><a id="gods-murderers"></a>Hindu gods are murderers</h2>
<p>Hindu gods killed many innocent people. Hindu gods are said to have taken birth on earth in flesh and bone to guide people, a god was engaged in a lecherous activity, and another one was engaged in getting back his wife for over a decade. I really don&#8217;t know what message they left for humanity. Hindu gods are depicted wielding weapons with fierce facial expressions. Many times innocent blood was shed with those weapons. Here are some stories about Hindu gods killing innocent people, I will start with Vishnu and his avatars. Let&#8217;s have a look at the words of the demon,</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">VISHNU</span></strong></p>
<p>Matsya Purana 178.6-22 &#8221;He is my enemy. He is the destroyer of my elders, He lived in the oceans, destroyed the demons Madhu and Kaitabha. It can be said that as long as he lives, the war between us will not end. There will be a most fearful fight between Him and me. He has killed many demons in this battle. He is very cruel. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">He has not shown His clemency even to the children and the woman of the demons killed</span>. He is shameless. He is Visnu. He is the heaven of the Devas. He sleeps on the Sesa serpent&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, Edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>Demons in Hindu scriptures don&#8217;t necessarily mean beings with monstrous looks. Some non-Vedic tribes were considered demons in Hindu scriptures. We read here that Vishnu killed women and children of the enemy demons. Vishnu on being urged by Indra is said to have beheaded the wife of sage Bhrigu and Bhrigu cursed Vishnu to take incarnations on earth.</p>
<p>Valmiki Ramayana, Uttara Kanda, chapter 51. &#8220;Learn, O king, what happened formerly during the conflict between the Devas and Asuras. The Daityas, whom the Suras threatened, took refuge with the consort of Bhrigu and she, having given them a haven, they dwelt there in safety. Seeing them thus succoured, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">the Chief of the gods, enraged with his sharp-edged discus severed the head of Bhrigu&#8217;s wife</span>. Beholding the murder of his consort, Bhrigu, in his wrath, instantly cursed Vishnu, the destroyer of enemy hosts, saying:- &#8216;Since in thine insensate fury, thou has slain my spouse, who should never have died thus, thou shalt take birth in the world of men, O Janardana, and there thou shall live separated from thy consort for many years.&#8221; Tr. Hari Prasad Shastri</p>
<p>Matsya Purana Part I, 47.101-105 &#8220;At that, both Indra and Visnu were overcome with fear and began to contrive some means of escape. Visnu said to Indra:- &#8216;How shall we escape from her?&#8217; Indra replied:- &#8216;Lord! kill her before she consumed me. I am solely protected by you, destroy her soon without delay.&#8217; Visnu thought over the great sin of killing a woman, in spite of that, he took up his Sudarsana Chakra to free Himself from that impending calamity. Trembling with fear, on thinking over the consequences of her anger and being afraid of the consequences of His own wrath, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">He severed her head with His Chakra</span>. The sage Bhrigu then cursed Visnu for killing his wife.&#8221; Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>As per Brahmanda Purana 2.3.72.139-140 Vishnu pierced her head with his weapon and cut it into three parts. The context of this story is that. There was a battle between demons and Devas. Demons suffered a huge loss at the hands of the Devas and only a few demons survived so they wanted to take shelter and Shukra asked the Daityas to take refuge in his father&#8217;s house till he gets a boon from Shiva to defeat the Devas. So Daityas took shelter with the wife of sage Bhrigu who assured them safety. But Indra and Vishnu arrived there to kill Daityas but Shukra&#8217;s mother resisted the attack as she possessed powers and was going to burn up Indra and Vishnu so Indra asked Vishnu to kill her and Vishnu beheads her with his Sudarshan Chakra, Bhrigu arrived at the house and finds his wife killed by Vishnu and he curses Vishnu. As per Devi Bhagavatam Vishnu resurrects Bhrigu&#8217;s wife but as per Matsya Purana 1.47.108-111 Bhrigu resurrects his own wife. Vishnu and Indra could&#8217;ve fled from the spot or paralyzed her but they killed her. There&#8217;s a verse in Bhagavad Purana which says that Vishnu&#8217;s Sudarshan Chakra causes miscarriages of demons&#8217; wives,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 5.24.15 When the Sudarśana disc enters those provinces, the pregnant wives of the demons all have miscarriages due to fear of its effulgence.&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">VAMANA</span></strong></p>
<p>There was an Asura king named Mahabali who was a just and noble king. But to secure the kingship of Devas, Vamana avatar of Vishnu killed him and sent him to the lower world. This is mentioned in Srimad Bhagavatam Canto  8 chapters 18-20</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PARASHURAMA</span></strong></p>
<p>Parashurama was the sixth avatar of Vishnu. He is said to have beheaded his own mother Renuka as well as his brothers on the command of his father Jamadagni. Parashurama&#8217;s name in Mahabharata also appears as Rama, so do not confuse this Rama with Rama the killer of Ravana,</p>
<p>Mahabharata Vana Parva 3.116.13-14 &#8220;And then Rama, the slayer of hostile heroes, came to the hermitage, last of all. Him the mighty-armed Jamadagni, of great austerities, addressed, saying, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">&#8216;Kill this wicked mother of thine, without compunction, O my son.&#8217; Thereupon Rama immediately took up an axe and therewith severed his mother&#8217;s head</span>.&#8221; Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>The context of the story is that Renuka went to bathe and on her return, she happened to see King Chitraratha of Martikavata copulating with his wives, she was inspired with desire, and when she returned to the hermitage her husband Jamdagni came to know about it so he ordered his sons to kill her, they refused but Parshurama on the command of his father beheaded his mother. Jamadagni also told Parashurama to kill his brothers as they refused his command and Parashurama obeying his father&#8217;s command killed his brothers as well. But on Parashurama&#8217;s request to Jamadagni, his mother Renuka and brothers were brought back to life and Parashurama also requested that his mother and brothers shall not remember anything.</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 9.16.6 &#8220;Jamadagni then ordered his youngest son, Paraśurāma, to kill his brothers, who had disobeyed this order, and his mother, who had mentally committed adultery. Lord Paraśurāma, knowing the power of his father, who was practiced in meditation and austerity, killed his mother and brothers immediately.&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana 2.3.23.65 has an indirect reference to Parashurama&#8217;s killing of his own mother.</p>
<p>What was the sin of Renuka? That she was sexually aroused seeing the sexual intercourse of a king! Surely what she did was sinful but not so much that she deserved to be beheaded by her son the sixth incarnation of Vishnu. And Hindu god Parashurama also beheaded his mother without any hesitation.</p>
<p>Parashurama annihilated the entire Kshatriya race because his father was killed by Kartavirya Arjuna who belonged to the Kshatriya caste. He is said to have killed Kshatriyas twenty-one times,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 9.16.10 &#8220;Once when Paraśurāma left the āśrama for the forest with Vasumān and his other brothers, the sons of Kārtavīryārjuna took the opportunity to approach Jamadagni&#8217;s residence to seek vengeance for their grudge. The sons of Kārtavīryārjuna were determined to commit sinful deeds. Therefore when they saw Jamadagni sitting by the side of the fire to perform yajña and meditating upon the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is praised by the best of selected prayers, they took the opportunity to kill him. With pitiable prayers, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Reṇukā, the mother of Paraśurāma and wife of Jamadagni, begged for the life of her husband. But the sons of Kārtavīryārjuna, being devoid of the qualities of kṣatriyas, were so cruel that despite her prayers they forcibly cut off his head and took it away</span>.&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 9.16.16 Thus lamenting, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Lord Paraśurāma entrusted his father&#8217;s dead body to his brothers and personally took up his axe, having decided to put an end to all the kṣatriyas on the surface of the world</span>. [18-19] With the blood of the bodies of these sons, Lord Paraśurāma created a ghastly river, which brought great fear to the kings who had no respect for brahminical culture. Because the kṣatriyas, the men of power in government, were performing sinful activities, Lord Paraśurāma, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">on the plea of retaliating for the murder of his father, rid all the kṣatriyas from the face of the earth twenty-one times</span>. Indeed, in the place known as Samanta-pañcaka he created nine lakes filled with their blood.&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Brahma Purana 104.110-111 &#8220;The Earth where crores of Ksatriyas remained scattered about, the Earth that is adorned by the mountains Meru and Mandara was rid of Ksatriyas twentyone times by the lord. After making the Earth devoid of Ksatriyas, Parasurama of great fame performed a horse sacrifice in order to dispel his sins.&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Mahabharata Adi Parva 1.2.1-7 &#8220;The Rishis said, &#8216;O son of Suta, we wish to hear a full and circumstantial account of the place mentioned by you as Samanta-panchaya.'&#8221;Sauti said, &#8216;Listen, O ye Brahmanas, to the sacred descriptions I utter O ye best of men, ye deserve to hear of the place known as Samanta-panchaka. In the interval between the Treta and Dwapara Yugas, Rama (the son of Jamadagni) great among all who have borne arms, urged by impatience of wrongs, repeatedly smote the noble race of Kshatriyas. And when that fiery meteor, by his own valour, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">annihilated the entire tribe of the Kshatriyas, he formed at Samanta-panchaka five lakes of blood</span>. We are told that his reason being overpowered by anger he offered oblations of blood to the manes of his ancestors, standing in the midst of the sanguine waters of those lakes. It was then that his forefathers of whom Richika was the first having arrived there addressed him thus, &#8216;O Rama, O blessed Rama, O offspring of Bhrigu, we have been gratified with the reverence thou hast shown for thy ancestors and with thy valour …&#8221; Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Parashurama burned up the entire city along with the inhabitants</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana 2.3.46.20-26 &#8220;A battle took place once again between Rama and the kings, wherein the infuriated sage of high intellect, killed a hundred kings. After killing Surasena and others along with their armies and vehicles, he made the entire group of Ksatriyas fall on the ground in a moment. The kings who survived, whose wishes had been frustrated and whose vehicles and armies has been killed fled in all directions. After routing the armies, killing the enemies and winning the battle, Rama killed hundreds of kings and heroes by means of the fire from his excellent arrows. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Overwhelmed with fury and desirous of burning the entire city</span>, Bhargava discharged a missile that had a lustre similar to that of Kalagni (the fire of world-destruction). <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The fire from that missile burned the city along with elephants, horses and men</span>. The flames enveloped the clusters of the entire rampart-wall of the city.  On seeing the city being burned and desirous of saving his own life, Prince Virihotra became frightened and fled quickly for the sake of life.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>How is it possible that all the Kshatriyas in the world were engaged in sinful activities? As I said earlier, everything Hindu gods didn&#8217;t like is demonized in Hindu scriptures. Parashurama killed all Kshatriyas to avenge his father&#8217;s murder by a few Kshatriya.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">KRISHNA</span></strong></p>
<p>Krishna beheaded a washerman just because he refused to give him clothes and spoke rudely,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 10.41.36-37 &#8220;Fools, get out of here quickly! Don&#8217;t beg like this if You want to stay alive. When someone is too bold, the King&#8217;s men arrest him and kill him and take all his property. As the washerman thus spoke brazenly, the son of Devaki became angry, and <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">then merely with His fingertips He separated the man&#8217;s head from his body</span>.&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The slaughter of </span><span style="color: #000000;">the </span><span style="color: #000000;">washerman is summarized in Bravaivarta Purana, Krishna Janma Khanda 132.62-75 and also mentioned in Agni Purana 12.23. Krishna and Balrama visited the city Mathura. And a washerman was passing by so they asked him</span><span style="color: #000000;"> to give them</span><span style="color: #000000;"> some clothes that belonged to the King. From the words of the washerman</span><span style="color: #000000;">,</span><span style="color: #000000;"> it appears that he thought Krishna and Balram</span><span style="color: #000000;">a to be wanderers. So he plainly</span><span style="color: #000000;"> refused </span><span style="color: #000000;">to give clothes. This story sounds</span><span style="color: #000000;"> same </span><span style="color: #000000;">as</span><span style="color: #000000;"> the crimes we read where thieves kill people to take their possessions. After beheading the washerman Krishna and Balrama took the clothes.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Krishna couldn&#8217;t bear criticism. He beheaded King Shishupala just because he abused him. Pandavas were performing sacrifice at Indraprastha where Shishupala was also present and he was beheaded there.</span></p>
<p>Padma Purana VI.252.13-20 &#8220;All those, protected by Krsna, having saluted and praised Krsna, went to their respective countries. Then, going to Indraprastha with the two (i.e. Bhima and Arjuna), Krsna made Yudhisthira perform the Rajasuya sacrifice. There, after the sacrifice was over, the chief honour was given to Krsna with the consent of Bhisma. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">There </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Sisupala spoke many abusive words to Krsna. Krsna too cut off his head with the Sudarsana (disc)</span>&#8230;&#8221; Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 10.74.39-44 &#8220;Upon hearing such intolerable blasphemy of the Lord, several members of the assembly covered their ears and walked out, angrily cursing the King of Cedi. Anyone who fails to immediately leave the place where he hears criticism of the Supreme Lord or His faithful devotee will certainly fall down, bereft of his pious credit. Then the sons of Pāṇḍu became furious, and together with the warriors of the Matsya, Kaikaya and Sṛñjaya clans, they rose up from their seats with weapons poised, ready to kill Śiśupāla. Undaunted, Śiśupāla then took up his sword and shield in the midst of all the assembled kings, O Bhārata, and hurled insults at those who sided with Lord Kṛṣṇa. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">At that point the Supreme Lord stood up and checked His devotees. He then angrily sent forth His razor-sharp disc and severed the head of His enemy</span> as he was attacking. When Śiśupāla was thus killed, a great roar and howl went up from the crowd. Taking advantage of that disturbance, the few kings who were supporters of Śiśupāla quickly left the assembly out of fear for their lives.&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>As you may know that Krishna was killed accidentally by a hunter named Jara. Although Jara murdered Krishna and can&#8217;t be called innocent but this contradicts modern Hindus&#8217; statement that Krishna was very merciful. Even after begging for mercy Krishna took revenge and killed Jara but awarded him entry to heaven,</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 5.37.60-69 “Respecting the words of the Brahman, the imprecation of Durvásas, the illustrious Krishńa sat engaged in thought, resting his foot upon his knee. Then came there a hunter, named Jará, whose arrow was tipped with a blade made of the piece of iron of the club, which had not been reduced to powder; and beholding from a distance the foot of Krishńa, he mistook it for part of a deer, and shooting his arrow, lodged it in the sole. Approaching his mark, he saw the four-armed king, and, falling at his feet, repeatedly besought his forgiveness, exclaiming, “I have done this deed unwittingly, thinking I was aiming at a deer! Have pity upon me, who am consumed by my crime; for thou art able to consume me!” Bhagavat replied, “Fear not thou in the least. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Go, hunter, through my favour, to heaven, the abode of the gods.” As soon as he had thus spoken, a celestial car appeared, and the hunter, ascending it, forthwith proceeded to heaven</span>.” Tr.

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-size: 12pt;">Balrama</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Balarama is sometime</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">s</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> conside</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">red an avatar of Vishnu. As per </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Hindu text</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">s</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">, Balarama was addicted to gambling. Balarama is said to have played dice with Rukmi the brother</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">-in-</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">law of Krishna. It is said that Rukmi wanted to avenge the elopement of his sister Rukmini by Krishna so he challenged Balarama the brother of Krishna in the game of dice who accepted it without hesitation though he wasn’t an expert at it. Balarama lost many bets to Rukmi but won the final bet which was very big. Then an argument ensued between Rukmi and </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Balarama that Balarama had cheated him (Rukmi) and that Rukmi is the real winner. Balarama couldn’t tolerate this so he killed Rukmi for such </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">a </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">petty argument,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Vishnu Purana 5.23</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">.10-28</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> “After the wedding had been solemnized, several of the kings, headed by him of Kalinga, said to Rukmin, “This wielder of the ploughshare is ignorant of the dice, which may be converted into his misfortune: why may we not contend with him, and beat him, in play?” The potent Rukmin replied to them, and said, “So let it be:” and he engaged Balaráma at a game of dice in the palace. Balaráma soon lost to Rukmin a thousand Nishkas: he then staked and lost another thousand; and then pledged ten thousand, which Rukmin, who was well skilled in gambling, also won. At this the king of Kalinga laughed aloud, and the weak and exulting Rukmin grinned, and said, “Baladeva is losing, for he knows nothing of the game; although, blinded by a vain passion for play, he thinks he understands the dice.” Halayudha, galled by the broad laughter of the Kalinga prince, and the contemptuous speech of Rukmin, was exceedingly angry, and, overcome with passion, increased his stake to ten millions of Nishkas. Rukmin accepted the challenge, and therefore threw the dice. Baladeva won, and cried aloud, “The stake is mine.” But Rukmin called out as loudly, that he was the winner. “Tell no lies, Bala,” said he: “the stake is yours; that is true; but I did not agree to it: although this be won by you, yet still I am the winner.” A deep voice was then heard in the sky, inflaming still more the anger of the high-spirited Baladeva, saying, “Bala has rightly won the whole sum, and Rukmin speaks falsely: although he did not accept the pledge in words, he did so by his acts (having cast the dice).” </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000; font-size: 12pt;">Balaráma thus excited, his eyes red with rage, started up, and struck Rukmin with the board on which the game was played, and killed him</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">… When Krishńa heard that Rukmin had been killed by his brother, he made no remark, being afraid of Rukminí on the one hand, and of Bala on the other…”</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> Tr.

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">RAMA</span></strong></p>
<p>Rama beheaded a Shudra named Shambuka because that Shudra was practicing penance that may have included chanting some Vedic Mantras.</p>
<p>Ramayana of Valmiki, Uttara Kanda 7, Chapters 75-76 &#8221;On this that Prince born of Raghu approached the one who had given himself up to rigorous practices and said:- &#8221;Blessed art thou, O Ascetic, who art faithful to thy vows! <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">From what caste art thou sprung</span>, O Thou who hast grown old in mortification and who art established in heroism. I am interested in this matter, I Rama, the son of Dasaratha. What purpose hast thou in view? Is it heaven or some other object? What boon dost thou seek by means of this hard penance? I wish to know what thou desirest in performing these austerities, O Ascetic. May prosperity attend thee! <span style="color: #ff0000;">Art thou a brahmin? Art thou an invincible Kshatriya? Art thou a Vaishya, one of the third caste or art thou a Shudra</span>? Answer me truthfully!&#8221;&#8230;Hearing the words of Rama of imperishable exploits, that ascetic, his head still hanging downwards, answered:- <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">&#8221;O Rama, I was born of a Shudra alliance and I am performing this rigorous penance in order to acquire the status of a God in this body</span>. I am not telling a lie, O Rama, I wish to attain the Celestial Region. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Know that I am a Shudra and my name is Shambuka</span>.&#8221; <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">As he was yet speaking, Raghava, drawing his brilliant and stainless sword from its scabbard, cut off his head</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Shudra being slain</span>, all the Gods and their leaders with Agni&#8217;s followers, cried out, &#8221;Well done! Well done!&#8221; overwhelming Rama with praise, and a rain of celestial flowers of divine fragrance fell on all sides, scattered by Vayu.&#8221; Tr. Hari Prasad Shastri</p>
<p>Ramayana of Valmiki, Uttara Kanda 7, Chapters 75-76 &#8220;O Kakutstha be happy! This very day that child has received new life and has been restored to his parents. The child was resuscited at the instant that the head of the Shudra fell.&#8221; Tr. Hari Prasad Shastri</p>
<p>A Brahmin boy died in Ram&#8217;s kingdom so Rama went out to find the cause of this death signifying that there must be some unrighteous thing going on that led to the death of this boy. So Rama found Shambuka who was hanging upside down from a tree performing vigorous penance. Ram asked his caste and reason for his penance and beheaded him. Some apologists say that Rama beheaded Shambuka because Shambuka was performing penance to acquire a boon for an evil purpose. If Shambuka was slain for that then why wasn&#8217;t Ravana beheaded too? Is that because Ravana was a Brahmin and Shambuka was a Shuda? Shambuka in this passage clearly said that he is performing penance to acquire the status of God in his body. He wasn&#8217;t performing it with some evil intention. If he was lying and Rama already knew his intention then why did he first enquired and then beheaded him? Why didn&#8217;t he just go there and behead him? Rama asked Shambuka&#8217;s caste, Shambuka reiterated that he is a Shudra. Shudra caste is emphasized here which means that Rama beheaded him because a Shudra should not perform such penance.</p>
<p>Lakshmana on the command of Rama is said to have cut off the nose and ears of Ravana&#8217;s sister Shurpanakha who had approached Rama expressing her love for him.</p>
<p>Valmiki Ramayana, Aranya Kanda 3.18.20-21 &#8220;She is freakish, knavish and overtly ruttish, oh, tigerly man, it will be apt of you to deface this paunchy demoness&#8221; Thus Rama said to Lakshmana. Thus said to that mighty Lakshmana he infuriately drew sword and chopped off her ears and nose before the very eyes of Rama.&#8221; Tr. Desi Raju Hanumanth Rao</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 10.47.17 &#8221;He is so very wily that in his incarnation as Rama, he had killed the king of monkeys, (Vali) like a hunter. Also, being brought under the control of his wife he cut off the nose of a woman Shurpanakha by name, who had come to him being stricken with amorous desire.&#8221; Tr. J.M. Sanyal</p>
<p>Also mentioned in Agni Purana 7.5</p>
<p>In the next life, Shurpanakha is incarnated as Kubja the hunchback woman and Rama as Krishna and these two had an illicit relationship which I have mentioned in <a href="https://vedkabhed.wordpress.com/2014/12/27/hinduism-and-lust/" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Hinduism and Lust<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> article.</p>
<p>Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Krishna Janma Khanda 115.93-102 &#8220;Kubja, in her previous birth, was the sister of the wicked Ravana. Her name was Surpanakha. Actuated by lust, she desired the society of Rama. Lakshamana, the chief of the pious men, cut off her nose&#8230;.&#8221; Tr. Various Sanskrit Scholars, Edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>It is said that Shurpanakha was going to kill Sita. There is another version that says that when Shurpanakha approached Rama, he asked her to go to Lakshman and then Lakshman cut off her nose and ears. But the story in Ramayana seems more authentic. Lakshman cutting off the nose and ears of Ravan&#8217;s sister is what provoked Ravana to revenge. It&#8217;s quite funny that Ravana is demonized despite being a Brahmin and Shiva&#8217;s ardent devotee just because he abducted Ram&#8217;s wife Sita. But Hindu gods raping and abducting women doesn&#8217;t make them villains. I say Shurpanakha was lucky enough to have only her ears and nose cut off. There is a story of another woman being deformed by Lakshmana who approached Lakshamana to express her love,</p>
<p>Valmiki Ramayana Aranya Kanda 3.69.15-17 &#8220;Closeting Soumitri in her embrace she told him this sentence, &#8220;I am Ayomukhi, by my name&#8230; you won me by your heroic personality, by that way, none can win me over&#8230; thus, you alone are my lover&#8230; oh, hero, oh, my husband&#8230; you will romance with me on mountaintops, in rivers, and on sandy isles, till the end of this life&#8230;&#8221; So is the love prattle of that demoness Ayomukhi. When said that way that enemy-suppressor <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Lakshmana became furious, and upraising his sword he sheared off her nose, one ear, and one of her breasts</span>.&#8221; Tr. Desi Raju Hanumanth Rao</p>
<p>Now some people may say that this is the same story with variations in names. The name of the woman here is Ayomukhi whereas in the same Valmiki Ramayana Surpanakha appears to be the name of Ravana&#8217;s sister. So the same variation cannot occur in the same text. Shurpanakha expressed her love for Rama while Ayomukhi expressed her love for Lakshmana, also there is no mention of cutting up Shurpanakha&#8217;s breast but this story does. Most important of all, the mutilation of Ayomukhi occurred after Sita was abducted while Shurpanakha&#8217;s mutilation happened before Ravana abducted Sita. Poor lady Ayomukhi&#8217;s ears, nose and breast were cut off by the cruel Lakshman just because she expressed her love.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">HANUMAN</span></strong></p>
<p>In the Valmiki Ramayana Hanuman is said to have burnt up Lanka along with its inhabitants. The word demon is used to describe the people of Lanka. As you may know, Non-Hindus were considered demons, just go to Sri Lanka and let’s see whether you find humans or demons there. The verses also show that the Lankans amassed great wealth,</p>
<p>Valmiki Ramayana Sundara Khanda 5, Sarga 54, Verses 24- “The demons, who were running hither and thither to protect their houses and who lost their spirits and abundant wealth, created a tumultuous nose, saying &#8220;Alas! The fire-god has come really in a form of this monkey! <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Some women crying and carrying their suckling&#8217;s</span> with their hair dishevelled, fell down from their houses, which were enveloped with fire, and shone like flashes of lightning falling from clouds in the sky. As the fire does not get satisfied with any amount of firewood and straw fed to it, Hanuma was not wearied in killing any number of demons. The earth was not then wearied in receiving the number of demons killed by Hanuma (in her lap).” Tr. K.M.K. Murthy</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">KALKI</span></strong></p>
<p>According to Hindu texts, Kalki avatar kills Shudra kings, Buddhists and heretics, he also plunders them,</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.58.76-83 &#8220;He will be called Pramiti. He was born of a part of Visnu formerly in the Svayambhuva Manvantara. He wandered over the earth for full twenty years. He led an army consisting of cavalry, chariots and elephants. He was surrounded by hundreds and thousands of Brahmanas armed with weapons. He killed Mlecchas in thousands. He went everywhere. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">After killing the kings born of Sudra women, he exterminated the heretics</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">He killed thousands of persons who were not religious and righteous. He killed those born of mixed castes as well as those who depended on them</span>. He killed the Udicyas (northerners), Madya Desyas (people of the Middle Land), mountain-dwellers, easterners, westerners, dwellers in Vindhya and Aparanta. He killed the southerners, Dravidas, Simhalas, Gandharas, Paradas, Pahlavas, Yavanas, Tusaras, Barbaras, Cinas, Sulikas, Daradas, Khasas, Lampakas, Ketas, and the different tribes of Kratas.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare, edited by G.P. Bhatt</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana 1.2.31.88-90 &#8220;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Annihilating every thing by his ruthless activity, he made only seeds to remain on the earth</span>. He managed to subdue the Vrsala who were generally sinful, by making them angry with one another on sudden provocations. Thereafter, in the region between the Ganga and the Yamuna, he established his camp of rest along with his followers. Thereafter, when the Kalpa elapsed, he went back to his eternal abode along with his army after exterminating Mleccha kings by thousands.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 144.51-59 &#8220;King Pramati of the Bhrigu family and Chandramasa gotra was born at the end of Svayambhuva Manu in the Sandhyamsa period, to inflict proper punishment on the sinners. That king travelled all over the earth for 30 years and collected arms and ammunitions, elephants, horses and chariots and marched with a vast army consisting of horses and elephants and accompanied by 100,00 Brahmana soldiers armed with various kinds of weapons, against the Mlecchas and destroyed them. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">After killing all the Sudra kings he annihilated all the hypocrites</span>. After destroying all the sinners and subduing the people living in the North, central regions, the mountaineers, the inhabitants in the East and West, the residents on the Vindhyas, the Deccanis, the Dravidians, the Singhalese, the inhabitants of the Mleccha countries (Kabul and Kandhara), the Paradas, the Pahlavas, the Yavanas, the Sakas, the Tusaras, the Svetas, the Pulindas, the Barbaras, the Khasas, the Lampakas, the Andhrakas, the Daradas, the Ifalikas, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">he exterminated the Sudras</span>. King Pramati was born of Visnu&#8217;s part in Manu&#8217;s family and was famous as Chandramasa.&#8221; Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>This is also mentioned in Brahmanda Purana 1.2.31.77-80 and Vayu Purana I.58.76-83 which I have mentioned in <a href="#intolerance-within-Hinduism" class="broken_link">Intolerance within caste and sects</a> category and it is also mentioned in Linga Purana Section I.40.50-56. It would have been comprehensible if the verse said that Kalki (Pramati) killed the sinners and wrongdoers but killing people born of mixed castes, and kings born to Shudra mothers is casteist. And saying that all people living in the north, south, east and west are all wrong doesn&#8217;t make any sense either, some of the tribes mentioned are traceable.</p>
<p>Kalki avatar annihilating humans and subduing low castes,</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana 2.3.73.111-116 &#8220;The lord Visnu who had been born in the previous birth as a powerful one, Pramiti by name, will be born in the Gotra of Candramas when the Kaliyuga is complete. Thus these ten incarnations of the lord are remembered. he accepts different wombs in the three worlds partially, adopting at different periods of time, different physical bodies, and different purposes for the manifestations. He will be born in the twenty-fifth Kalpa. For twenty-five years he will be exterminating the living beings and all human beings (?). With this cruel act, he will render the Earth left with only the seeds. He will subdue Vrsalas (low caste people) and almost those evil-doers. Thereafter, Kalki will become contented along with his army. Those who are not killed in this action, those who achieve something, will become deluded suddenly and fight with one another.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Do read Kalki Purana 13.39-44 and Kalki Purana 16.1 which I have already mentioned in this article in <a href="#kalki-buddhists" class="broken_link">Kalki avatar a murderer of Buddhists</a> category. Let me once against quote them for you,</p>
<p>Sri Kalki Purana 16.1 &#8220;Suta Gosvami said. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">After killing the Buddhists and mlecchas of Kikatapura, Lord Kalki took their wealth</span> and returned to His capital, along with His vast army&#8221; Tr. Bhumipati Das edited by Purnaprajna Das</p>
<p>Sri Kalki Purana 13.39-44 &#8220;Lord Kalki appeared to flourish, being surrounded by all these family members. Once, Lord Kalki&#8217;s father, Visnuyasa, who was on the level of Lord Brahma, decided to perform a horse sacrifice. Understanding the intention of His father, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Lord Kalki said: My dear father, I will go out and defeat all other kings in battle and thus bring you sufficient wealth</span> so that you can conduct the horse sacrifice properly. Lord Kalki, who was certainly capable of conquering all other kings, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">offered His obeisances to his father and then set out with his army to first conquer Kikatapura</span>…&#8221; Tr. Bhumipati Das edited by Purnaprajna Das</p>
<p>It proves that his primary aim was to plunder people. If you are conversant with Indian history you might be knowing that Kikata is present-day Bihar. And Bihar was once dominated by Buddhists, some historians even say that Bihar is the corrupted word for Vihar which means a Buddhist temple or monastery. Buddhism might have been the prevalent religion in Kikata (Bihar) when Kalki Purana was written so the composer wrote all these fairy tales keeping that in mind or else they may have written it based on the prediction of Kali Yuga in Hindu scriptures which says that people will become heretics (Jains, Buddhists). Also, these verses of plundering Kikata may have been inspired by the Vedic verses in which Vedic gods plunders Kikata tribe just because they didn&#8217;t offer any oblation to them.

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: initial; font-size: 12pt;">SHIVA</span></strong></p>
<p>Shiva burned up Tripura (Three cities) along with women and children. Tripura was a city inhabited by Asuras. Shiva with the help of other gods like Agni, Vishnu, Ashvinkumar, Yama, Kala, Ghandarvas, Brahma burned the city as well as its inhabitants. It&#8217;s not objectionable if Devas had killed combatant Asuras but they killed non-combatant Asuras along with their children and women. Your heart may tremble reading the following verses,</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 188.1 &#8220;Marakandeya said:- Hear from me, Yudhisthira! what you have asked me to explain. The spot on the banks of the Narmada where the Lord is enshrined is renowned as Mahesvara in all the three worlds and at the very same place He devised His plans of annihilating Tripura. [6-15] &#8230;In that way, Siva waited for thousands of years after making such preparations. When the three Puras (cities) fell in one line the Lord let out His arrow on Tripura when the inmates of Tripura became helpless and many kind of destructive omens occurred there&#8230;Then the wind Sambartaka that blows at the close of a cycle commenced&#8230;It produced fire on account of which the trees of Tripura began to crumble down. There was chaos everywhere. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">All the gardens were burnt down in an instant</span>&#8230;[25-40] <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The pleasure gardens smiling with lotus beds were also burnt down along with the swans and cranes</span>&#8230;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The fire of the Lord&#8217;s fury burnt down quite unsparingly several children, cows, birds, horses, women, and many people sleeping as well as awake</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The nymph like beauties of Tripura fell down burnt with their young ones hugged to their breasts.</span> Some ladies wearing garlands of pearl and gold fell down on the ground consumed by flames and suffocated by smoke. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Some beauties seeing their Lord lying on the ground jumped down from the upper storey of their mansion and were instantly eaten up by the flames</span>&#8230;Some ladies of the cloudy hue wearing garlands and armlets, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">some fair-complexioned beauties giving milk to their dear little ones were also consumed by fire</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Some ladies seeing their children eaten up by the fire sent forth shrilling wails</span>. Some ladies wearing diamond and emerald necklaces and shining like the moon <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">with their children in their lap, fell down on the ground after being charred</span>. Some moon faced beauties waking up from their sleep found their mansion on fire and began to <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">lament on realizing their children being burnt</span>. Some ladies adorned with golden ornaments fell down on the ground holding their consumed children in their arms&#8230; [41-48] Some overcome by the fury of the fire with their hands folded and uplifted began to pray as follows:- <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">&#8216;Agni! if thou art angry with the male population hostile to thee; what is the fault of the women confined in the houses like so many domesticated Kokilas pent up in cages</span>&#8230;[51-53]&#8230;Hearing such speech of the ladies the Agni said &#8216;I am not consuming you of my own will. I have been born to cause destruction. I have no mercy. I make my way everywhere freely through the glory of Siva&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Rudrasamhita 2, Yuddha Khanda 5.10.35 &#8220;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Other Asuraas too, children and old men were completely burnt out</span>, O Vyasa, at the bidding of Siva and speedily reduced to ashes. Just as the universe is burnt at the end of a Kalpa so also every thing and everyone there, whether woman or man or vehicles, was reduced to ashes by that fire.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Only those who worshipped Shiva and Ganesh were not burnt and all those who opposed God and whose activities were destructive (read not worshipping Shiva) were burnt including children, women and old people.</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 140.59-69 &#8220;The women folk in the amorous embraces of their lords in their residences and pleasure groves, were also reduced to ashes. No women could go away elsewhere. They were also consumed by fire in the company of their lords. Some of them cried out with folded hands and with tears in their eyes &#8216;O Agni! I am the wife of another; O Thou, the holy witness of all the things in the three worlds! You ought not to touch me. O Deva! my husband and myself are asleep; <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">I have not done any thing vicious and sinful</span>; therefore, go away by another path leaving my home with my beloved. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">One woman holding her infant stood, facing the fire and said &#8216;Agni! I have obtained this infant after great privations and it does not behove thee to burn this darling of mine</span></strong>&#8216;. Some of the women folk threw themselves into the waters of the ocean after forsaking their husbands. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Many of the women shivered under the destructive influence of fire and exclaimed with bewildering excitement, &#8216;O, father! O, husband! O, mother! O, maternal uncle! etc</span>. &#8216;As the heat emanating from the houses withers the lotuses springing in the ponds thereof, so consumed the fire at Tripura the lotus-like faces of those women along with their bodies&#8230;There was a great uproar when the women flew with their jingling ornaments and cried out in great consternation, on account of the fire produced form the destructive arrow of Siva.&#8221; Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>Other verses show that Devas were engaged in annihilating all of the Asuras, verses from Matsya Purana prove that, non-combatant Asuras including children, women and old people were also burned to death,</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 148.1-7 &#8220;Tarakasura said:- &#8216;Hearken, O, valiant Asuras! every one should direct his intelligence to his well being. Danavas! <span style="text-decoration: underline;">all the Devas are the annihilators of our race</span>. They are our ancient enemies. Our family religion is, therefore to establish firmly our eternal enmity with them. Today we shall certainly make a move to check the advance of the Devas and conquer them by the strength of our arms. But I do not consider it proper to fight with the Devas without practising austerities, I shall, therefore, first practise severe austerities; then we will conquer the Devas and enjoy the three worlds&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>The following verses describe the Tripura city,</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 140.53-57 &#8220;The arrow burnt the three cities as fire burns heaps of straw&#8230;The Tripura fort looked then like a good family brought to ruin by a wicked son. Afterwards, the houses of Tripura looking like the peaks of Sumera, Mandarachala and Kailasa, the beautiful places with gateways and perforated works and balconies, the pleasure rendezvous full of lovely ponds, the abodes of demons decorated with banners, buntings and wreaths of gold were eaten up by the thousand tongue fire.&#8221; Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>From the above verses as well as verses from Matsya Purana 188.1 we get to know that the Asuras were much more civilized than the Devas, the city of the enemies is described in such a beautiful manner. It shows the civilization of the Asuras who had lofty buildings, lovely palaces beautifully decorated with wreaths of gold, gardens with beautiful ponds, Asura women wearing necklaces of diamonds and gold, etc. After reading these things do you really think they were demons? A woman in this verse clearly says, &#8220;&#8216;Agni! if thou art angry with the male population hostile to thee; what is the fault of the women confined in the houses like so many domesticated Kokilas pent up in cages&#8221; But this didn&#8217;t stop cruel Agni from consuming them.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">INDRA</span></strong></p>
<p>Indra doesn&#8217;t deserve to be called a God. Even the most lecherous person&#8217;s actions on earth cannot be compared to the evils done by Indra. Indra lusted after other&#8217;s wives, raped women, committed adultery, consumed alcoholic drinks and even killed innocent people. Indra entered the womb of Diti and cut off the fetus into nine parts to kill the baby,</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Shiva Purana, Rudra Samhita 2, Parvati K</span><span style="color: #000000;">handa 3, Ch 14, verses </span><span style="color: #000000;">8-14 &#8221;My son Marici begot Kasyapa who married thirteen daughters of Daksa. The eldest of them Diti bore two sons: Hiranyakasipu the elder and Hiranyaksa the younger. When these two began to harass the gods, Visnu assumed the forms of Man lion and Boar and killed them. Then gods became fearless and happy. The distressed Diti sought refuge in Kasyapa and serving him with devotion and observing the sacred rites she conceived. On coming to know of it, </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Indra entered her womb forcibly and cut it off many a time with his thunderbolt</span><span style="color: #000000;">. By the power of her sacred rites, the child in the womb did not die as she was sleeping at that time, by a stroke of good luck. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">They were cut into seven pieces and so she had seven sons. These sons became gods by the name of Maruts</span><span style="color: #000000;">.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">This is also mentioned in Vayu Purana 6.102-3; Agni Purana 19.19-20; Valmiki Ramayana Bala Kandam 1.46 and as per Brahmanda Purana 2.3.5.68 Indra entered the belly through the vaginal passage. I am posting the summary of this story by Desi Raju Hanumanth Rao so you can understand the context,</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Diti seeks for a son to kill Indra because Indra and other gods have killed her sons in the battle after churning Milk Ocean. But Indra, being her stepson arrives at her place of asceticism, with view to destroy that Indra-killer. On a fateful day when Diti failed to maintain the procedure of vow, Indra enters her womb and dissects the foetus into seven fragments, which later become sapta marut gaNa-s, The Seven Wind-gods.&#8221;</p>
<p>Indra killed a Muni Trisira/Vishwarupa who was meditating,</p>
<p>Srimad Devi Bhagavatam 6.2.1-11. &#8220;Vyâsa said:- The extremely covetous Indra, then, mounted on his Airâvata elephant and determined to kill the Muni. He went to him and saw him immersed in deep Samâdhi, firmly seated in his posture and with his speech controlled. At that time, a halo of light emanated from his body and he looked like a second Sun and a blazing fire. Indra became very sad and dejected when he saw that. Indra then thought within himself thus :&#8211; &#8220;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Oh! Can I slay this Muni, free from any vicious inclinations, and endowed with the power of Tapas, blazing like a fire</span>! This is quite against the Dharma. But, Alas! He wants to usurp my position; how can I, then, neglect such an enemy?&#8221; Thus cogitating, Indra hurled at the Muni his swift going, infallible thunderbolt, the Muni remaining engaged in his penance and shining like the Sun and Moon. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The ascetic, struck </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">thus, fell on the ground and died</span>, like a mountain peak struck by thunder falling on the ground and presenting a wondrous sight. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Indra became very glad when he killed the Muni</span>…&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Also mentioned in Mahabharata Udyog Parva 5, section 9; Satapatha Brahmana 1.6.3.1-2. Muni Trisira/Vishwarupa had three heads for which he was called Trisira. He dedicated one head to the recitation of Vedas, one head for eating and one for observing the surroundings. Indra was afraid that Muni Trisira/Vishwarupa may replace Indra from his Indraship due to the rigid penance. So at first, he sent several Apsaras like Urvashi, Menaka, Rambha, Ghritachi and Tilottama who tried to interrupt Muni Trisira&#8217;s penance by singing and dancing in front of him and even seducing him but in vain. So at last Indra decided to kill him. But even after killing Muni Trisira with a thunderbolt, Indra thought that Trisira was alive so he asked a woodcutter named Taksa to cut off the heads of the Muni with his axe,</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Srimad </span><span style="color: #000000;">Devi Bhagavatam 6.2.1-14. &#8220;…Indra, then, went back soon to his own abode; on the other hand, the high-souled Muni, though killed, looked as it were, living by the lustre of his own body. </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Indra, then, seeing him lying like a living man thought that the Muni might get alive and so became very sad</span><span style="color: #000000;">. While he was thus arguing in his mind, he saw before him a wood cutter named Taksa and began to speak to him for his own selfish ends thus &#8220;</span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">O Artisan! Cut all the heads of this Muni and keep my word; this highly lustrous Muni is looking as it were alive; therefore, if you sever his heads</span><span style="color: #000000;">, he cannot be alive.&#8221; Taksa then cursed him and spoke thus. &#8220;O King of the Devas! The neck of this Muni is very big and therefore cannot be severed; my axe is not at all fit for this work. Specially I cannot do such a blameable act. You have done a very heinous crime, quite against the law of the good persons; I fear sin; I will not be able to cut the heads of a dead man. This Muni is lying dead; what use is there in severing his head again? O Pâkas&#8217;âsana! The killer of the demon Pâka! Why do you fear in this?&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The woodcutter was first reluctant but Indra convinced him and lured him with a share in </span><span style="color: #000000;">the </span><span style="color: #000000;">sacrifice and then the woodcutter cut off three heads of Trisira,</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Srimad </span><span style="color: #000000;">Devi Bhagavatam 6.2.21 &#8220;</span>Vyâsa said:&#8211; O King! That Tak<span style="text-decoration: underline;">s</span>â became very glad when he heard thus from Indra and struck off the heads of the Muni with his very strong axe.&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">So Vishwakarma the father of Trisira created a son Vritra to avenge the death of his son,</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Srimad </span><span style="color: #000000;">Devi Bhagavatam 6.2.21-53 &#8220;When Vis&#8217;vakarmâ heard that his virtuous son had been killed, he became very angry (in his mind) and </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">said that as Indra had killed his qualified son engaged in asceticism without any offence, he would create another son to kill Indra.</span> <span style="color: #000000;">Let the Devas see his strength and power of Tapasyâ and let Indra, too, reap the far-reaching effects of his own Karma. Thus saying, Vis&#8217;vakarmâ distressed with anger, offered oblations in the sacrificial Fire, reciting Mantram from the Atharvan Vedas, with the object of producing a son. When Homa was performed for eight nights consecutively, a man quickly came out of that burning fire, as if he was the Incarnate of Fire itself…Father! Of what avail is that to his father when he is not able to remove his sorrows!&#8221; O Father! Shall I drink the ocean or crumble the mountains to dust or shall I obstruct the passage of the rising Sun or shall I kill </span><span style="color: #000000;">Indra, Yama, or the other host of Devas or shall I root out the earth and throw it with all beings into the ocean?&#8221; </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">O King! Hearing thus the sweet words of his son, Vis&#8217;vakarmâ gladly told his mountain-like son &#8220;</span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">O my Son! You are capable to save me from troubles (Vrijina) hence you are named Vritra</span><span style="color: #000000;">. O highly Fortunate One! Your brother, named Tris&#8217;irâ, was a gre</span>at ascetic; his three faces were all very strong. He was thoroughly conversant with the Vedas and the Vedangâs and well versed in all the other knowledges. He remained always engaged in practising asceticism, surprising to the three worlds. Indra killed my qualified son with his thunderbolt; that wicked soul severed the three heads without any offence. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Therefore, O Best of beings! Kill that vicious, shameless, deceitful, wicked Indra</span> guilty of the sin of Brahmahattyâ…&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Indra slaying Vritra is praised in Vedas and many Puranas also. But in the Vedas, it is in metaphor. Wherein Indra means Sun and Vritra means cloud. It could be possible that Vedic verses were composed praising the killing of Vritra by Indra. Vritra was born to avenge the murder of his brother and still, Indra is praised in Vedas. But Vritra seems to be a kind-hearted man who entered into a truce with Indra. But the vicious Indra decided to kill him in a deceitful way. Indra sent Rambha to seduce Vritra so that he may be distracted and that will help Indra to kill Vritra. Indra&#8217;s plan was successful, Vritra fell into this trap and was killed with Indra&#8217;s thunderbolt. The following verse shows that they had entered into a truce,</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Srimad </span><span style="color: #000000;">Devi Bhagavatam 6.1.1-12 &#8220;…</span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The powerful Vritra entered into a treaty and kept himself</span><span style="color: #000000;"> peaceful when Indra and Visnu violated truth and treacherously killed him by Jalaphena (the watery foams)&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Rig Veda and Mahabharata show that Indra sought the help of Vishnu who advised him to befriend Vritra and thus making it easier for Indra to kill Vritra,</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Rig Veda 6.20.2 Even as the power of Dyaus, to thee, O Indra, all Asura sway was by the Gods entrusted, When thou, Impetuous! </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">leagued with Viṣṇu, slewest Vṛtra</span><span style="color: #000000;"> the Dragon who enclosed the waters. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Mahabharata 5.10</span><span style="color: #000000;">.1-43</span><span style="color: #000000;"> &#8220;Indra said, This whole indestructible universe, O gods, hath been pervaded by Vritra. There is nothing that can be equal to the task of opposing him. I was capable of yore, but now I am incapable. What good betide you, can I do? I believe him to be unapproachable. Powerful and magnanimous, possessing immeasurable strength in fight, he would be able to swallow up all the three worlds with the gods, the Asuras, and the men. Therefore, hear ye dwellers of heaven, this is my resolution. Proceeding to the abode of Vishnu, in company with that high-souled Being must we consult, and ascertain the means of slaying this ruthless wretch.&#8217; &#8220;Salya continued, &#8216;Indra having thus spoken, the gods with that host of Rishis repaired to the mighty god Vishnu to place themselves under the-protection of that protector of all. And afflicted with the dread of Vritra, they said unto the Supreme Lord of the deities. Thou hadst in former times covered the three worlds with three steps. Thou hadst procured the ambrosial food, O Vishnu, and destroyed the Asuras in battle. Thou didst bind the great Asura Vali and hadst raised Indra to the throne of heaven. Thou art the lord of the gods, and this entire universe is pervaded by thee. Thou art the God, the mighty Deity, saluted by all persons. Be thou the refuge of all the celestials </span><span style="color: #000000;">together with Indra, O best of gods. The whole universe, O slayer of Asuras, hath been pervaded by Vritra. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">And Vishnu said, &#8216;I am no doubt bound to do what is for your good</span><span style="color: #000000;">. I shall, therefore, tell you of a contrivance whereby he may be annihilated. </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Do ye with the Rishis and the Gandharvas repair to the place where Vritra that bearer of a universal form is and adopt towards him a conciliatory policy</span><span style="color: #000000;">.</span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;"> You will thus succeed in overthrowing him</span><span style="color: #000000;">. By virtue of my power, victory, ye gods, will be won by Indra, for, remaining invisible, I shall enter into his thunderbolt, that best of weapons. O foremost of gods, depart ye with the Rishis and the Gandharvas. Let there be no delay in effecting a peace between Indra and Vritra.&#8217;&#8230;If I do not kill Vritra, this great and mighty Asura of gigantic frame, </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">even by deceit</span><span style="color: #000000;">, it will not go well with me.&#8217; And as Indra thought of all this, bearing Vishnu in mind he beheld at that instant in the sea a mass of froth as large as a hill. And he said, &#8216;This is neither dry, nor wet, nor is it a weapon; let me hurl it at Vritra. Without doubt, he will die immediately.&#8217; And he threw at Vritra that mass of froth blended with the thunderbolt. </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">And Vishnu, having entered within that froth, put an end to the life of Vritra</span><span style="color: #000000;">. And when Vritra was killed, the cardinal points were free from gloom; and there also blew a pleasant breeze; and all beings were much pleased&#8230;&#8221; Tr. K.M. Ganguli</span></p>
<p>The following verses from Padma Purana have a slightly different version that exhibits how Indra killed him,</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Padma Purana II.24.34-43 &#8220;</span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">He thought of a stratagem to kill him. He sent Rambha (after telling her:) &#8221;With this or that trick, delude the great demon</span><span style="color: #000000;">. O auspicious one, do that to delude the great demon, so that by killing him I shall get happiness.&#8221;&#8230;[44b-51] very wise Vrtra, confiding (in Indra) in all matters, and knowing Indra to be a great friend, was not afraid of him. Moving (i.e. he moved) in the great auspicious forest&#8230;Vrtra, having come there, saw that Rambha, with charming, large eyes with his mind full of sexual desire.&#8221; Tr. N.A. Deshpande</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Padma Purana II.25.11-20 &#8220;[Vrtra said] O you beautiful lady, I have sought your shelter. Protect me form the (disturbance caused by) sexual desire. O you of large eyes, resort to me, who am, O dear one, distressed by sexual desire. Rambha said: There is no doubt that today I shall submit myself to you; O hero, you should do whatever I tell you to do&#8230;Having thus established a relation with her, the very powerful best demon enjoyed in that very meritorious forest. The great demon was very much stupefied by her singing, dancing, charming smile and sexual intercourse (with her). She said to that noble and best demon: &#8216;(Please) drink wine; (please) drink madhu-madhavi (a kind of intoxicating drink)&#8230; </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #000000;">But that respectable lady Rambha lovingly gave wine to him against his will</span><span style="color: #000000;">. Due to civility for her he drink wine at that time. </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">When he was extremely stupefied by the wine, and lost his senses, just then Indra struck him with his thunderbolt</span><span style="color: #000000;">. Then that killer of Vrtra (i.e. Indra) was tainted with such sins as killing a brahmana.&#8221; Tr. N.A. Deshpande</span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s mentioned in Shastra that Indra gave part of the Brahmin-slaughter sin to women,</p>
<p>Vasistha Dharma Shastra 5.7. For it has been declared in the Veda, &#8216;When Indra had slain (Vritra) the three-headed son of Tvashtri, he was seized by Sin, and he considered himself to be tainted with exceedingly great guilt. All beings cried out against him (saying to him), &#8216;O thou slayer of a learned Brâhmana! O thou slayer of a learned Brâhmana!&#8217; <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">He ran to the </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">women for protection (and said to them), &#8216;Take upon yourselves the third part of this my guilt (caused by) the murder of a learned Brâhmana</span>.&#8217; They answered, &#8221;What shall we have (for doing thy wish)?&#8217; He replied, &#8216;Choose a boon.&#8217; They said, &#8216;Let us obtain offspring (if our husbands approach us) during the proper season, at pleasure let us dwell (with our husbands until (our children) are born.&#8217; He answered, &#8216;So be it.&#8217; (Then) they took upon themselves (the third part of his guilt). <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">That guilt of Brâhmana-murder appears every month as the menstrual flow</span>. Therefore let him not eat the food of a woman in her courses; (for) such a one has put on the shape of the guilt of Brâhmana-murder.</p>
<p>Violating treaties was no big deal for Indra. A demon named Namuchi had entered into a peace treaty with Indra for fear of being killed. But Indra violated the treaty and killed him,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 8.14.13 13 With waters&#8217; foam thou torest off, Indra, the head of Namuci, Subduing all contending hosts.</p>
<p>Mahabharata 9.43.32-46 &#8220;Vaishampayana said, &#8220;Listen to that history, O ruler of men! Hear of those occurrences as they happened! Hear how Vasava, in days of yore, broke his treaty with Namuchi! The Asura Namuchi, from fear of Vasava, had entered a ray of the Sun. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Indra then made friends with Namuchi and entered into a covenant with him</span>, saying, &#8216;O foremost of Asuras, I shall not slay thee, O friend, with anything that is wet or with anything that is dry! I shall not slay thee in the night or in the day! I swear this to thee by truth. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Having made this covenant, the lord Indra one day beheld a fog. He then, O king, cut off Namuchi&#8217;s head, using the foam of water (as his weapon). </span>The severed head of Namuchi thereupon pursued Indra from behind, saying unto him from a near point these words, &#8216;O slayer of a friend, O wretch!&#8217; Urged on incessantly by that head, Indra repaired to the Grandsire and informed him, in grief, of what had occurred. The Supreme Lord of the universe said unto him, &#8216;Performing a sacrifice, bathe with due rites, O chief of the celestials, in Aruna, that tirtha which saveth from the fear of sin!&#8221; Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Indra and Namuchi having entered into a peace treaty and Indra violating it and killing Namuchi is also mentioned in Panchavimsha Brahmana 12.6.8-9. Mahabharata and Panchavimsha Brahmana has the same version of the story which makes it authentic but there is another version mentioned in Brahma Purana which says that Indra fled the battlefield and Namuchi chased him and he was killed there,</p>
<p>Brahma Purana: Gautami-Mahatmya 54.33-40 &#8220;Brahma said: Formerly, there was a very powerful leader of Daityas named Namuci. His enmity towards Indra was terrible. It caused hairs to stand on end. Once Namuci, the heroic leader of Daityas, saw Indra abandoning the battle and going off. Then he pursued him. On seeing him coming <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Indra became overwhelmed with fear</span>. Leaving off Airavata, Indra entered the foam of water. The thunderbolt-armed Indra instantly killed his enemy through the foam&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">A Brahmin couple was traveling during the night, due to the ailment of the husband, the wife named Sandili carried her husband, due to exhaustion and darkness, she faltered and fell on a pole or Trishul on which a Rishi named Mandavya was performing penance, he was hurt by that so he cursed Kaushik to die when the sun rises. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">Skanda Purana, Avantya Khanda 5, Reva Khanda 3, chapter 171, verses 40-54 &#8220;When those leading Brahmanas went out of sight, the female ascetic Sandili came there on the second day. She was carrying her husband on her head and wandering about at night. She did not see the sage (Mandavya). O Yudhisthira, she was staggering due to the excess of burden. The Brahmana on the stake was not noticed by her. The chaste lady faltered and slipped down against the knees of the Brahmana on the stake. Due to the fall of the faltering lady much pain was caused to the sage&#8230;The sages said: Moving about at will, you appear to be unaware of other people&#8217;s distress and pain. In the morning as soon as the sun rises your husband will die. O low-born woman, only your own misery you know and not that of any other person. Sandili became chagrined at those terrible words.

<h3><a id="war-tactics"></a>War tactics and courage of Hindu gods</h3>
<p>Hindu gods are depicted as brave warriors but these brave warriors were sometimes scared of their enemies and even fled the battlefield. Being gods they also used war tactics same as human beings do. The following verses show how Vishnu, Shiva and Brahma were defeated by a Danava and they fled in fear,</p>
<p>Srimad Devi Bhagavatam 5.7.4-11. &#8220;Seeing the Dânava, Vâsudeva Hari raised his discus in anger and attacked him with great force to kill him. Just when Hari struck the Dânava violently with his Chakra, the powerful Dânava quitted immediately his lion-form, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">assumed the buffalo form and struck Hari with his two horns. Vâsudeva, thus pierced in his breast with the horns, became confounded and fled away</span> as best as he could till he reached his own abode, Vaikuntha. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Seeing Hari thus fleeing away, S&#8217;ankara, too, thought him invulnerable and fled to his Kailâs&#8217;a mountain with fear. Brahmâ, too, fled to his own abode with terror</span>; but the powerful Vâsava took patience and remained steady in the battle. Varuna taking his S&#8217;akti waited patiently for battle. Yama, too, with his staff remained there ready to fight. Kuvera, the Lord of the Yaksas, remained very busy in close fighting with the Dânavas; Fire, taking S&#8217;akti, also waited. The Sun and Moon, the Lord of the stars, both remained in firm resolve to fight with Mahisa, the lord of the Dânavas&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Rama killing Bali.</p>
<p>Rama killed Bali while Bali was busy fighting Hanuman. That too Rama shot an arrow by hiding behind a tree. Rama killing Bali is mentioned in Valmiki Ramayana, Kishkindha Kanda, Ch 16.</p>
<p>Krishna and Balrama vs Yavana army,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 10.52.5-8 &#8220;The Lord again returned to the city of Mathura which was still besieged by the Yavana army. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">He annihilated the Yavana army and carried of their wealth as spoils to Dvaraka</span>. While the wealth was being transported on the backs of men and oxen under the direction of the Imperishable Lord, Jarasandha, commanding an army of twentythree aksauhinis arrived on the scence. Observing their violent onrush of inimical forced, Balarama and Krsna, the descendants of Madhu <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">adopted the human way of life and quickly began to run, Oh king. Though dauntless, they left the vast treasure (the spoils from the Yavana army) and similating terrified cowards, they ran for many yojanas on foot</span>, tender like lotuspetals.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 10.52.10-12 &#8220;Apparently exhausted after fleeing a long distance, the two Lords climbed a high mountain named Pravarṣaṇa, upon which Lord Indra showers incessant rain. Although he knew They were hiding on the mountain, Jarāsandha could find no trace of Them. Therefore, O King, he placed firewood on all sides and set the mountain ablaze. The two of Them then suddenly jumped from the burning mountain, which was eleven yojanas high, and fell to the ground.&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Vishnu beheads the demons by assuming the form of a woman,</p>
<p>Agni Purana 3.11-15 &#8220;Taking ambrosia from his hands the Daityas gave half of it to the gods and went away with the other half. Vishnu, the root of creation, then assumed the form of a (beautiful) damsel. Beholding her endued with beauty, the Daityas, overcome with fascination, said &#8216;Be our wife, take this ambrosia, O fair one and make us partake of it.&#8217; Saying &#8216;So be it&#8217; Hari took it from them and made the celestials drink of it. Assuming the form of the moon Rahu drank up the portion offered to the sun and moon and therefore his head was severed off his head by his enemy Hari. He then said to Hari, the giver of boon. &#8216;By thy mercy I have attained immortality.&#8221; Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>

<h3><a id="enemy"></a>Mercilessly killing the enemy</h3>
<p>Hindu gods mercilessly killed their enemies. They beheaded them, peeled out the skin, cut off all the limbs, cut them into pieces, burned them, etc.</p>
<p>Srimad Devi Bhagavatam 5.26.62-65 &#8220;Vyâsa said:&#8211; O King! Hearing thus the words of Ambikâ, Kâlikâ spoke to Her again:&#8211; &#8220;In this war-sacrifice there is this axe which is like a sacrificial post; I will offer these two as victims to Thy sacrifice. Thus no act of envy will be committed (i.e., killing in a sacrifice is not considered as envy).&#8221; Thus saying, the Kâlikâ Devî cut off their heads with great force and gladly drank their blood. Thus seeing the two Asuras killed, Ambikâ said gladly:&#8211; Thou hast done the service to the gods; so I will give Thee an excellent boon. O Kâlikâ! As Thou hast killed Chanda and Munda, henceforth Thou wilt be renowned in this world as Châmundâ.&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Agni Purana 234.8-16 &#8220;Now I shall describe the measures of illusion to be practised by a king in frightening away the hearts of a hostile army, to show that the God is on the side of his countrymen&#8230;Similarly the quarters of the enemy should be denuded with showers of simulated blood, and a similar severed head of the adversary should be exhibited at the terrace of the palace.&#8221; Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 8.10.57 &#8220;Thereafter, two very powerful demons named Mālī and Sumālī were killed by the Supreme Lord, who severed their heads with His disc. Then Mālyavān, another demon, attacked the Lord. With his sharp club, the demon, who was roaring like a lion, attacked Garuḍa, the lord of the birds, who are born from eggs. But the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the original person, used His disc to cut off the head of that enemy also.&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Srimad Devi Bhagavatam 5.14.40-56 &#8220;…Mahâ Mâyâ then, became very angry and began to hurl arrows after arrows so incessantly that all the armours of all the Dânavas became pierced and were cut down to pieces…&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Rudrasamhita 2, Yuddha Khanda section V, 55.30 &#8220;At the bidding of Siva, lord Krsna, the destroyer of heroic enemies, chopped off several arms of Bana by means of Sudarsana.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 10.59.14 &#8220;The Lord severed the heads, thighs, arms, legs and armor of these opponents led by Pīṭha and sent them all to the abode of Yamarāja. Narakāsura, the son of the earth, could not contain his fury when he saw the fate of his military leaders. Thus he went out of the citadel with elephants born from the Milk Ocean who were exuding mada from their foreheads out of excitement.&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Skanda Purana I.iii(P).11.27 &#8220;Then, the Goddess who tormented Mahisa, cut off his head with a sharp-edged sword and stood on his head and danced.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Valmiki Ramayana Aranya Kanda, 26.13-15 &#8220;Neverthless, as Dushana rushed upon him, Rama cut off both his arms with his arrows, and that mace, loosed from his grasp, fell forward on the field like unto the banner of Indra, Whilst Dushana, bereft of it, his arms severed, sank to the earth like a mighty elephant that, stripped of its tusks, succumbs.&#8221; Tr. Hari Prasad Shastri</p>
<p>Mahabharata Vana Parva 3.202.35 &#8220;Markandeya continued, &#8216;Then Govinda began to reflect but uncovered space found he none and when he could not discover any spot that was uncovered on earth or in the sky, that foremost Deity then beheld his thighs to be absolutely uncovered. And there, O king, the illustrious Deity cut off the heads of Madhu and Kaitabha with his keenedged discus!'&#8221; Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>

<p>Devi Bhagavatam 5.30.37-64. &#8220;Vyâsa said :&#8211; O King! Thus saying the Chandikâ Devî instantly cut off the head of Nis&#8217;umbha by Her axe with great caution. The head thus severed from the body by the blow of the Devî, the headless Demon began to roam there with great force with club in his hand.

<h2><a id="fighting-eachother"></a>Gods fighting each other</h2>
<p>Other than killing innocent people, Hindu gods were also engaged in fighting each other. Several questions arise when reading stories of gods fighting each other. Which god is right when two gods fight each other? Are Hindu gods so stupid not to understand right and wrong that they have to become physical with each other? What example are they leaving for human beings by fighting with each other? Can&#8217;t Hindu gods forgive the other to give an example to their creation? Or can&#8217;t they settle the matter through talks?</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SHIVA VS YAMA</span></strong></p>
<p>Brahma Purana 35.11 &#8220;Obeisance to one who annhilated the god of Death&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Jagdish Lal Shastri writes, &#8220;Annihilated the god of death. Siva gave Mrkandu a boon that a pious son would be born to him but he would live only for sixteen years. The child was born and named Markandeya. He was educated in Vedas and Sastras. When the hour of his death arrived, the boy embraced the linga idol of Siva. When Yama, the god of death came to fetch him, the angry Siva arose out of the idol and killed Yama. At the request of gods Yama was revived to life but Markandeya was granted youth for ever.&#8221;</p>
<p>Brahma Purana: Gautami-Mahatmya 24.9-21 &#8220;Brahma said: Then Mrtyu with the noose in his hand entered the place where that brahmin was worshipping Siva. The brahmin was not at all aware of either Yama&#8217;s servants or Mrtyu himself&#8230;Then Mrtyu thew up the noose against Sveta. O great sages, Nandin then became angry. Nandin hit Mrtyu with the baton given by Siva. Mrtyu fell on the ground. Then the messengers saw that Mrtyu was struck down. They intimated the incident to Yama. Then Dharma whose vehicle is buffalo and who controls all addressed his attendants and associates&#8230;&#8217;Hurry up, hurry up&#8217;, said Yama to them and himself proceeded ahead, surrounded by these and others, to the place where Sveta the excellent brahmin was worshipping Siva&#8230;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Karttikeya pierced the servants of Yama by means of his javelin. He killed Yama</span>, the powerful ruler of southern quarter.&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SHIVA&#8217;S VIRABHADRA VS GODS</span></strong></p>
<p>Daksha organized a Yajna and invited all gods and sages except for his son in law Shiva and spoke ill of Shiva. So Shiva&#8217;s wife asks him to destroy the sacrifice of Daksha. On being requested Shiva creates a form called Virabhadra. Virabhadra then goes to the place and destroys everything, kicks and beats up the sages, paralyses some Devas and kills some, cuts off Agni&#8217;s tongue, plucks out eyes of Bhaga and does many more violent things and finally beheads Daksha,</p>
<p>Kurma Purana I.15.35-42 &#8220;Sri Devi said: O Sankara, Daksa who had been my father in the previous birth is performing a Yajna after censuring your status and your own self&#8230;Please destroy that sacrifice immediately&#8230;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Thus implored by the goddess, the great Lord, the Lord of Devas, created Rudra immediately with a desire to destroy the Yajna of Daksa</span>. He was highly infuriated. He had a thousand heads, a thousand eyes and huge arms, a thousand in number. He was invincible. He resembled the fire at the close of the Yugas. He was terrible due to his curved fangs. He could not be seen (directly) due to his glaring brilliance. He held a conch and a discus. He had a staff in his hand. He roared loudly. He held a horn in his hand and was beautified with Bhasma (ashes). <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">He became famous as Virabhadra</span>&#8230;Siva spoke to him thus: &#8216;O Ganesvara (leader of the attendants). Blessings unto you. After censuring me, Daksa is performing a Yajna, at Gangadvara, (near the source of the river Ganga). Destroy that sacrifice of Daksa.&#8217; <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Then the sacrifice of Daksa was destroyed by Virabhadra playfully like a single lion released from bondage</span>&#8230; [59b-67a] The leaders of Ganas became infuriated. They uprooted the sacrificial posts and threw them here and there. The Ganesvaras, all of whom were terrible ones, took the sacrificial horse along with the Prastotr and Hotr (the priests) and hurled them into the currents of Ganga. Even <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Virabhadra whose mind was ablaze with wrath, paralysed the hand of Indra</span> as he raised it to strike and did the same to other gods. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Sportively he plucked out the eyes of Bhaga by the tip of his finger nails. Hitting with his fist he felled down the teeth of Pusan</span>. The mighty leader of Ganas sportively and smilingly kicked Lord Moon with the big toe of his leg. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">O excellent sages, he cut off the pair of hands of fire and playfully plucked out his tongue</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Then he kicked sages on their heads. The mighty one then pierced Visnu, who had been coming thither on his Garuda with sharp arrows after stunning Sudarsana</span>. The powerful Garuda stared at the Gana and suddenly hit him with his wings and roared like the ocean.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Also mentioned in Linga Purana Section I, 82.98-103; Varaha Purana chapter 21. After Daksha was beheaded a goat&#8217;s head was fixed and was resurrected as mentioned in Devi Bhagavatam 7.30.39-50, as per Linga Purana Section I.82.98-103 Saraswati&#8217;s lips and nose were also cut off. This story mentioned in Linga Purana is more violent,</p>
<p>Linga Purana Section I.100.15-19 &#8220;&#8230;Virabhadra of great splendour and undistressed soul made the hands of Indra and other Devas stunned as they raised them. He uprooted the eyes of Bhaga sportively with the tip of his finger. With his fist he hit the teeth of Pusan and made them fall. He kicked the moon with the toe of his foot. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">He cut off the head of lord Indra. After cutting off the hands of Agni and after uprooting his tongue</span> sportively he kicked him on his head with his leg. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">He cut off the staff of Yama</span>. He hit lord Isana a guardian of the quarters of great strength by means of his trident. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Without any difficulty he killed thirty three Devas thus</span>. Sportingly he killed three thousand three hundred and thirty three Devas along with the three leading Devas. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">He killed the leading sages too</span>. This lord killed those Devas who stood in readiness for fighting. Lord Rudra hit them with his fist, swords, arrows and other things. Then Visnu of great splendour and intensified strength lifted up his discus, and fought with Rudra. A terrible fight ensured between them. It made hairs to stand on end.&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Rudra Samhita 2, Satikhanda Section 2.1.32-34 &#8220;They worked a great havoc there. Virabhadra chastised everyone and spared none. After defeating Visnu and the Devas with strenuous effort, the chief of Ganas cut off the head of Daksa and consigned it to the sacrificial fire. Working great havoc he destroyed the sacrifice. Then he came back to the mountain and bowed to Lord Siva&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>There is another story that may talk about a different event but it looks like it&#8217;s about this same event,</p>
<p>Skanda Purana V.ii.64.19b-25 &#8220;The share of Sambhu was not appropriated by Brahma in his sacrifice. Mahadeva is the annihilator of the universe. (But,) O king, he (too) was deluded by his sense-organs and he became angry with Suras (Devas). The Suras are the Vibhutis (empowered parts) of Siva. All the three worlds are solely intended for his sport. Yet, by him the bow was strung well for the sake of a share! The teeth of Pusan were shattered. Divakara (the Sun) was made unconscious. The eyes of Bhaga were plucked and the god of Yajna in the form of an antelope was hit. The Devas turned into Pasus (animals). The sages were denied the Vedas. The Dharmasastras of the sages were taken away by the all powerful Lord&#8230;&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SHIVA VS GANESHA</span></strong></p>
<p>Shiva Purana Rudrasamhita 2, Kumara Khanda IV.13.15-20 &#8220;Once when Parvati was taking her bath, Sadasiva rebuked Nandin and came into the inner apartment. The mother of the universe, seeing the untimely arrival of Siva in the midst of her bath and toilet stood up. The beautiful lady was very shy then&#8230;At the time when the incident occurred, Parvati, the great Maya, the great goddess, thought as follows. &#8216;There must be a servant of my own who will be expert in his duties. He must not stray from my behest even a speck.&#8217; Thinking thus the goddess created a person with all the characteristics, out of the dirt from her body. [30-37] Thus placing her son at the doorway, Parvati began to take bath with her friends, unworried. O excellent sage, at this very moment Siva who is eagerly indulgent and an expert in various divine sports came near the door. Not knowing that he was lord Siva, the consort of Parvati, Ganesa said &#8216;O sir, without my mother&#8217;s permission you shall not go in now. My mother has entered the bath. Where are you going now? Go away&#8217; saying thus, he took up his staff to ward him off. On seeing him Siva said &#8216;O foolish fellow, whom are you forbidding? O wicked knave, don&#8217;t you know me? I am Siva, none else&#8217;. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Thereupon Ganesa beat Siva with the staff</span>. Siva expert in various sports became infuriated&#8230;When lord Siva tried to enter the house, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Ganesa became infuriated, O brahmin, and struck him with his staff once again</span>.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Shiva Purana Rudra Samhita 4, Kumarakhanda IV, 16.7-8 O sage, after fighting for a long time along with the army and seeing him terrific, even Siva was greatly surprised. Thinking withing himself &#8221;He has to be killed only by deception and not otherwise&#8221; he stayed in the midst of the army. [11-12] Then Ganesa the heoioc son of Sakti following the course of heroes, at first worshipped (i.e., struck) Visnu with his staff, Visnu who confers happiness to all. &#8221;I shall cause him delusion. Then let him be killed by you, O lord. Without deception he cannot be killed. He is of Tamasika nature and inaccessible.&#8221; [29-35] After remembering the lotus like feet of Siva, Visnu took up his discus and split the iron club by means of discus. Ganesa hurled the piece of iron club at Visnu which was caught by the bird Garuda and rendered futile. Thus for a long time the two heroes Visnu and Ganesa fought with each other. Again the foremost among heroes, the son of Parvati took up his staff of unrivalled power remembering Siva and struck Visnu with it. Struck with that unbearable blow he fell on the ground. But he got up, quickly and fought with Parvati&#8217;s son. Securing this opportunity, </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">the Trident-bearing deity came there and cut off his head with his trident</span><span style="color: #000000;">. O Narada, when the head of Ganesa was cut off, the armies of the gods and the Ganas stood still.&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">What kind of gods are these? One (Ganesha) doesn&#8217;t know his own father, the other (Shiva) who is considered The destroyer couldn&#8217;t kill Ganesha, so with the help of Vishnu he beheads a child that too by using deception.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #000000;">SHIVA VS BRAHMA</span></strong></p>
<p>Varaha Purana 97.1-7 &#8220;Varaha said: O Earth, now listen to the origin of Rudra Vrata, by knowing which one gets freed from all sins. The red-eyed and tawny coloured Rudra who was created by Brahma in his third birth, was borne by him in pleasure on his shoulder. When he was thus on the shoulder, the fifth head of Brahma told Rudra the Atharvan mantra by which release is obtained. &#8216;O Kapalin, Rudra, Babhru, Bhava, Kairata, Suvrata, my valiant and broad-eyed son, do protect this world&#8217;. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">When Rudra was thus addressed by the names which he would be getting in future he was angry at the word &#8216;Kapala&#8217; used and clipped off that (fifth) head</span>. The head was clipped off by the nail in the left thumb, but it got to the hand.&#8221; Tr. Venkitasubramonia Iyer, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>All Puranas are unanimous that Shiva beheaded Brahma but there is variation as to why he beheaded him, above verses say that Shiva was infuriated when Brahma called him Kapala but Kurma Purana II.31.1-32 says that Brahma and Shiva were quarreling over supremacy and Shiva found Brahma arrogant so he in anger cut off the head of Brahma. There are a few other versions. Shiva beheading Brahma is also mentioned in Skanda Purana V.iii.173.1-5; Brahma Purana: Gautami-Mahatmya 43.19-23; Shiva Purana, Vayaviyasamhita 6, Section I, 30.19</p>
<p>There is a story in Shiva Purana which says that Shiva was going to kill Brahma because Brahma watched his wife lustfully and even discharged semen,</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Rudrasamhita 2, Satikhanda 2.19.43- &#8220;Lord Siva said:- O patriarch Daksa what has just been requested by Visnu my great devotee and agreed to by me shall be done here. &#8216;O lord, whoever stares at Sati lustfully shall be killed by you.&#8217; I Shall make these words of Visnu true by killing Brahma. Why did Brahma stare at Sati lustfully? Moreover he has committed a sin by discharging his semen. Hence I shall kill him.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Brahma begs for mercy and at last, Vishnu acts as a mediator and pacifies Shiva and urges him not to kill Brahma and Shiva agrees. Another version of the story is mentioned in Vamana Purana,</p>
<p>Vamana Purana 2.35-37 &#8220;Discerning forthwith the faces resembling the Sun, the face of Brahman remarked thus, &#8216;Bubbles are formed when water is disturbed, Is there any valour in them&#8217;? The great Sankara who was enraged to hear this severed with the tip of his nail the head of Brahman which had spoken to him rudely. Thus chopped, the head fell on the left paml of Sankara himself and never dropped down from his hand.&#8221; Tr. Anand Swarup Gupta</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SHIVA VS AURVA</span></strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s not actually a fight. Shiva burns up the hermitage of sage Aurva for which Aurva curses him.</p>
<p>Varaha Purana 147.9-14 &#8220;Then in that famous tirtha known as Goniskramana, lord Siva came near him. Aurva was then going to the river Ganga to gather lotus flowers. Knowing him thus out of the hermitage, Siva entered it. It was auspicios, beautiful and full of fruits and flowers. But it was soon reduced to ashes by the heat of the halo of Siva. After burning that hermitage, Siva quickly returned to (his abdode in) the Himalayas. [19-] From that moment Siva, although he is the lord of the world, began to be tormented by great heat, and he told Parvati: &#8216;Seeing the penance of Aurva, the gods were afraid and they told me: &#8216;The heat of the penance of this Aurva affects the whole world. But he does not desire anything. How can we remedy thiss?&#8217; When told thus, I caste my eye on his hermitage. In a moment it was burnt down, and we returned. Being sorry and angry at this, Aurva cursed me, and that has resulted in this torment of mine.&#8221; Tr. Venkitasubramonia Iyer, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">KRISHNA VS SHIVA</span></strong></p>
<p>Aniruddh the grandson of Krishna fell in love with Uma the daughter of Banasura. So he followed her to her palace and was captured by Banasura&#8217;s men. Aniruddha didn&#8217;t return home for months and Sage Narada informed that Aniruddha has been captured by Banasura. So the battle between Krishna and Banasura ensued. Banasura was a devotee of Shiva and several other Shiva&#8217;s followers were harassed by Krishna so Shiva decided to help Banasura in the battle. Kartikeya son of Shiva also helped him. Banasura along with Shiva were overpowered by Krishna so Shiva requested Krishna not to kill Banasura so Krishna only cuts off the hands of Banasura.</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 10.63.12-14 &#8220;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Lord Śiva, wielder of the trident, shot various weapons at Lord Kṛṣṇa</span>, wielder of Śārṅga. But Lord Kṛṣṇa was not in the least perplexed: He neutralized all these weapons with appropriate counterweapons. Lord Kṛṣṇa counteracted a brahmāstra with another brahmāstra, a wind weapon with a mountain weapon, a fire weapon with a rain weapon, and Lord Śiva&#8217;s personal pāśupatāstra weapon with His own personal weapon, the nārāyaṇāstra. After bewildering Lord Śiva by making him yawn with a yawning weapon, Lord Kṛṣṇa proceeded to strike down Bāṇāsura&#8217;s army with His sword, club and arrows.&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 10.63.22 &#8220;After Lord Śiva&#8217;s followers had been driven away, the Śiva-jvara, who had three heads and three feet, pressed forward to attack Lord Kṛṣṇa. As the Śiva-jvara approached, he seemed to burn everything in the ten directions. Seeing this personified weapon approach, Lord Nārāyaṇa then released His own personified fever weapon, the Viṣṇu-jvara. The Śiva-jvara and Viṣṇu-jvara thus battled each other. The Śiva-jvara, overwhelmed by the strength of the Viṣṇu-jvara, cried out in pain. But finding no refuge, the frightened Śiva-jvara approached Lord Kṛṣṇa, the master of the senses, hoping to attain His shelter. Thus with joined palms he began to praise the Lord. The Śiva-jvara said: I bow down to You of unlimited potencies, the Supreme Lord, the Supersoul of all beings. You possess pure and complete consciousness and are the cause of cosmic creation, maintenance and dissolution. Perfectly peaceful, You are the Absolute Truth to whom the Vedas indirectly refer.&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SHIVA VS VISHNU</span></strong></p>
<p>There is another battle between Shiva and Krishna. And in this battle, Shiva helps Kasiraja and is defeated by Krishna. But in Skanda Purana it is a battle between Shiva and Vishnu. The discus of Krishna manifests itself as Vishnu. The story is that a King named Paundraka claims to be Vasudeva, this angers Krishna and he prepares for a battle against the imposter Vasudeva (Paundraka). King Paundraka is helped by his friend who is also a king of Kasi named Kasiraja. Since Kasiraja was a devotee of Shiva he propitiates Shiva for help in the battle against Krishna and Shiva agrees to help him,</p>
<p>Skanda Purana II.ii.12.14-18 &#8220;&#8230;Nila mountain is in the third Yojana (i.e. 3X12 Kms.). This is the holy spot of the Lord of Gauri named Ekamrakavana. Not far off, O king, is the place where, being afraid, he sought refuge. Indradyumna said: Why was the Lord of Gauri (Siva) frightened? With whom did he seek refuge?&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Skanda Purana II.ii.12.45-57 &#8220;O king, many king ruled over that city. Formerly in Dvapara Yuga, there was a king there (commonly) called Kasiraja. By means of severe penance he propitiated Lord Sambhu with this aim in his mind: &#8216;I will excel in war Acyuta (Krsna), the conquerer of kings, the chief of whom is Jaraasandha.&#8217; The Pinaka-bearing Lord (Siva) who was propitiated, granted him that boon: &#8216;O suppressor of enemies, you will conquer the Slayer of Kamsa in battle. For your sake I shall fight seated on my Bull, along with (my attendants) Pramathas&#8230;That Lord (Krsna) who is the immanent soul (of all), knew the incident of that sort, and sent his Discus for killing Kasiraja. The infuriated Discus that was very fierce in appearance, had the refulgence of a thousand suns. It knew the power of the mind of Visnu. It cut off the head of Kasiraja and burned to ash his army as well as that city. On seeing that extremely violent action Pasupati (Siva) became furious. Surrounded by his Ganas and seated on his Bull, the Pinaka-bearing Lord rushed at it. Then Sambhu looked at the Sudarsana Discus at the outset and discharged his Pasupata missile in front of it, like an ominous calamity. Formerly Sambhu had secured a boon from Visnu who had been pleased by his devotion: &#8216;On being remembered by you I shall invigorate your missile. But if you go against me, it will become lustreless (and ineffective.&#8217; When this Pasupata missile which was (usually) terrible, became futile and when Varanis was burned, the Bull-bannered Lord became afraid. Then he eulogized the Primordial Purusottama, the cause of all the worlds.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Skanda Purana II.ii.12.65-77 &#8220;When (the Lord) who burned the Tripuras eulogized thus, Adhoksaja (Visnu) manifested himself after casting off the form of the Discus. His face (indicated that he was) delighted. The glorious Lord held the conch, the discus and the iron club. He was seated on Garuda as if on a lotus seat&#8230;Though he was an ocean of mercy, he spoke the husband of Girija (who was) firghteneed, as if he waas angry with him. Sri Bhagavan said: How has such an evil-mindedness beset you at this time? O Sambhu, for the sake of an insect (i.e. an insignificant) king, you have come to fight with me! How many examples of my power have not been known to you, O Durjati (Siva). It is true that your Pasupati missile cannot be vanquished by Suras and Asuras. The Discus is a form of my anger. I t cannot spare even you&#8230;Now if you wish to sport about with Gauri here for a long time, if you wish that this city of Varanasi should stay for a long time (do as follows). On the shore of the Southern Sea there is a holy spot well known after my name, viz. Sripurusottama. It is adorned by Nila mountain&#8230;O annihilator of Tripuras, stay there fearlessly along with Parvati.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Skanda Purana II.ii.12.80-83 &#8220;Narada said: On being told thus by Vasudeva the Three-eyed Lord bent down his head. With palms joined in reverence he spoke to the slayer of Madhu: Mahadeva said: O Lord of Devas, O Lord of the universe, O Lord, O dispeller of the agony of those who bow down (to you) carrying out your behest will be the cause of my welfare, O Lord of the worlds. On account of my stupidity, O Lord, I had been arrogant. There, O Lord, your own blessing is the cause of my fickleness. Since you command me, O Lord of Devas, to proceed to Purusottama, I shall carry out your behest reverently and proceed to the auspicious holy place that bestows salvation&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Krishna beheads Kasiraja with his Sudarshan Chakra as mentioned in Srimad Bhagavatam 10.66.22.</p>
<p>There was another battle between Shiva and Vishnu. Where Shiva kills Vishnu&#8217;s three sons in the form of a bull for creating havoc and Vishnu fights Shiva and is defeated by that Bull, Vishnu wasn&#8217;t aware that the bull was actually Shiva,</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Satarudra Samhita 3, chapter 23, verses 3-12 &#8220;Then the bull attacked Visnu&#8217;s sons wielding their bows for fighting, deluded by Siva&#8217;s Maya and proud of their great strenght and exploit. O excellent sage, the sons of Visnu becamame furious. Those heroes roared loudly and rushed against Siva. Rudra in that form of a bull was furious at those sons of Visnu who rushed at him. He kicked them with his hoofs and tore them with his horns. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">When their limbs were split by Rudra, they swooned and lost their lives. They were immediately destroyed</span>. When they were killed Visnu the foremost of the strong came out shouting loudly and hastened towards Siva<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">. On Seeing Siva in the form of the bull going along after killing his sons, Visnu hit him with divine arrows and missiles</span>. Then the infuriated Siva, the highly powerful one in the form of a bull stood like a mountain and caught hold of all those milssiles of Visnu&#8230;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The lord leaped up suddenly and kicked the infuriated Visnu who was deluded and could not realise him. The lord then tore him with his horns</span>. Unable to bear the onslaught, Visnu deluded by Maya was exhausted and utterly shattered.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Satarudra Samhita 3, chapter 23, verses 13-16 &#8220;When his pride fell off, Visnu was dejected, and dispirited. He then realised that Siva was sporting about in the form of a bull. Then on realising that Siva himself had come in the form of a Bull, Visnu spoke in a shrill voice with drooping shoulders and palms joined in reverence. Visnu said: O lord of the gods, O ocean of mercy, O lord Siva, I had been deluded by your Maya and my mind had been confused. O lord, I fought with you, Siva. Taking pity on me, O lord, let this offence be excused.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SHIVA&#8217;S VIRABHADRA VS VISHNU&#8217;S NARASIMHA</span></strong></p>
<p>The story of Vishnu’s Narasimha avatar killing Hiranyakashipu with his claws by placing him on his lap is well known. This story ends with the killing of Hiranyakaship in Vaishnavite Puranas, however, it has an addition in Shaivite Puranas which says that this avatar of Vishnu was killed by Shiva’s Sharaba form and this story can be found only in Shaivite Puranas to show Shiva as superior to Vishnu. The summary of the story is that fiery Narasimha didn’t just stop after killing Hiranyakaship, Narasimha created havoc on the earth and was going to annihilate the universe. Gods propitiated “The Destroyer” Shiva to stop it and save the world. Hence, Shiva sent his Virabhadra form to pacify Narasimha avatar. Virabhadra praised Narasimha and requested him to stop the annihilation of the universe as “The Destroyer” is only Shiva but all in vain. Sweet words of Narasimha instead infuriated Narasimha and he held the Virabhadra form. Thence Virabhadra form disappeared with a change in environment marking the advent of the most fierce form of Shiva known as Sharaba. This form is explained in the following way,</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Satarudrasamhita 3, chapter 12, verses 2-11 &#8220;Nandisvara said: Thus admonished by Virabhadra, the Man-lion became furious. He roared and began to seize him with force. In the meantime, the splendour of Siva rose up unbearably enveloping the sky all around. It was terrible and cause for imminent fear. Then in a trice the form of Virabhhadra became invisible&#8230;Even as all the gods stood watching with the auspicious shouts of victory, Lord Siva became manifest in the form the Annihilator. He had a thousand hands and wore matted hair. His head was adorned with wings and beak. His body was fierce and fully developed. His fangs were very sharp. Adamantine claws were his weapons. His neck was black in colour. He had a huge arms and four legs. He was blazing like fire. His voice was resonant and terrible like the rumbling sound of the clouds that gather at the end of a Yuga. His three eyes were as wide and blazing as the fire of the evil spirit of great fury. His fangs and lips were clearly visible. He was producing a hissing sound of Humkara. Siva of such a form appeared in sight.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>The following verses show Virabhadra’s attempt to calm Narasimha which further infuriated Narasimha,</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Satarudrasamhita 3, chapter 11, verses 25-27 &#8220;[Virabhadra says] O lord Narasimha, O soul of the universe, subdue this extremely terrible body yourself in my presence. Nandisvara said; Urged thus with quiet peaceful words of Virabhadra, the arrogant man-lion assumed a more terrible anger&#8230;The Man-lion said: Go back the way you have come from. Do not speak offending words. I am now going to annihilate the universe of the mobile and immobile beings.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>The following verses show how he killed Narasimha and skinned him to wear it as a garment.</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Satarudrasamhita 3, chapter 12, verses 12-36 &#8220;At his very vision Visnu lost his strength and exploit. He assumed a lustre of the flickering glow-worm beneath the sun. Fluttering with his wings, and tearing the navel and legs he bound the legs of the Man-lion with his tail and his hands with his own hands. He struck his chest, caught hold of Visnu. It expanded in the sky along with the gods and sages. Like a vulture seizing a serpent he fearlessly caught hold of Visnu, lifted him up and fell him to the ground. At the time of flight he was excessively oppressed being hit with the wings. Then Lord Siva took Visnu and flew him. All the gods followed him eulogising him with the words of obeisance. Brahma and other sages bowed to him with reverence and love. Being led thus Visnu was helpless. His face was pallid and sorrowful. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">With palms joined in reverence he eulogised Lord Siva with prayers of simple words</span>. After eulogising Mrda with the hundred and eight names of the lord, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Nrsimha requested lord Sarabha again. &#8216;O great lord, whenever my ignorant mind becomes defiled by arrogance, it shall be removed by you alone&#8217;</span> Nandisvara said: Thus saying with love to Siva, the Man-lion turned submissive and bowed to him. Visnu was utterly defeated and came to the end of his life&#8230;Lord Virabhadra, the leader of the Ganas, of great strength, peeled off the hide of the Man-lion and went to the mountain taking it with him. From that time Siva began to wear the hide of the Man-lion. His head was the leading bead in his necklace of skulls.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Linga Purana says that only bones were left with a face but Shiva Purana says that Virabhadra/Sharabha used Narasimha’s head as bead in his necklace of skulls. Sharabha killing Narasimha is also mentioned in other verses. Brahma says in Skanda Purana,<br />
Skanda Purana I.iii(U).16.17 &#8220;If you had not killed Nrhari (Man-lion) by assuming the form of Sarabha (i.e. a fabulous eight footed animal) alone, he would have destroyed the universe like Hiranyakasipu.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">INDRA VS SHIVA</span></strong></p>
<p>Mahabharata, Drona Parva 7, Section 202, Verses 82-84 &#8220;When the triple city began to burn, the goddess Durga went to see the sight, with a child on her lap having only five clumps of hair on its head. Uma then asked the gods who that child was. The malevolent Indra then tried to strike him with the thunder-bolt. Thereupon the all-powerful Lord of all the worlds, possessed of the six excellent qualities the Bhagas, smilingly paralysed the arm of the enraged Indra wielding the thunder bolt.&#8221; Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>

<p>Rig Veda 1.170.2 The Maruts are thy brothers. Why, O Indra, wouldst thou take our lives? Agree with them in friendly wise, and do not slay us in the fight.</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">KRISHNA VS INDRA</span></strong></p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 5.30.51-68 &#8220;&#8230;and Indra accordingly, attended by the army of the celestials, marched to attack Hari, in defence of the Parijata tree. The gods were armed with clubs, swords, maces, and darts; and Indra wielded the thunderbolt. As soon as Govinda saw the king of the gods advancing against him on his elephant, attended by the immortals, he blew his shell so that the sound filled all the regions, and he showered smilingly myriads of arrows upon his assailants&#8230;The son of Devaki thew his mace at the club of Yama, and cast it broken upon the ground: he cut in bits the litter of the lord of the sun: he severed Agni into a hundred parts with his arrows, and scattered the Vasus through the realms of space: with his discus he cut off the points of tridents of Rudras, and cast themselves upon the earth: and with the shafts shot from his bow he dispersed the Sadhyas, Visvas, Maruts, and Gandharbas, like fleeces of cotton from the pods of the wings and nails, and bit and bruised and scratched the deities who opposed his lord&#8230;When all other weapons had been cut to pieces, Indra stood armed with his thunderbolt, and Krshna with the discus Sudarsana. Beholding them thus prepared to fight, all the people of the three spheres exclaimed, &#8216;Alas! alas!&#8217; Indra launched his bolt, but in vain, for Hari caught and arrested it&#8230;&#8221; Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>H.H. Wilson summarizes this as,</p>
<p>&#8220;Krishńa restores her earrings to Adití, and is praised by her: he visits the gardens of Indra, and at the desire of Satyabhámá carries off the Párijáta tree. Śachí excites Indra to its rescue. Conflict between the gods and Krishńa, who defeats them. Satyabhámá derides them. They praise Krishńa.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">VISHNU VS LAKSHMI</span></strong></p>
<p>Now, this is a good lesson to all married men, do not provoke your wife and do not talk about other women, she can even behead you. Lakshmi beheads Vishnu using a curse because Vishnu laughed at her unnecessarily,</p>
<p>Srimad Devi Bhagavatam 1.5.74-86 &#8220;Does anything take place in this world without any cause? <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Now hear why Hari&#8217;s head was cut off</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Once on a time, seeing the beautiful face of His dear wife Laksmî Devî, Hari laughed in presence of Her</span>. At this Laksmî Devî came to understand that &#8220;He has seen surely something ugly in my face and therefore He laughed; otherwise why my Husband would laugh at seeing me. But what reason can there be as to see ugliness in my face after so long a time. And why shall <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">He laugh without seeing something ugly, without any cause. Or it may be, He has made some other beautiful woman as my co-wife</span>&#8220;. Thus arguing variously in her mind, Mahâ Laksmî gradually got angry and Tamo guna slowly possessed Her. Then, by turn of Fate, in order that god&#8217;s work might be completed, very fierce Tamas Sakti entered into Her body. She got very angry and slowly said:&#8211; &#8220;Let Thy head fall off&#8221;. Thus, owing to feminine nature and the destiny of Bhagvan, Laksmî cursed without any thought of good or bad, causing Her own suffering. By the Tâmasî S&#8217;akti possessing Her, she thought that a co-wife would be more painful than Her widowhood and thus She cursed Him. Falsehood, vain boldness, craftiness, stupidity, impatience, over-greediness, impurity, and harshness are the natural qualities of women. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Owing to that curse, the head of Vasudeva has fallen into the salt ocean</span>. Now I will fix the head on His body as before…&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">VISHNU VS GODS</span></strong></p>
<p>Gods accidentally or deliberately cut off the head of Vishnu. Vishnu slept placing his head at the end of a bow. Gods created white ants and made a deal with them and made them gnaw the bowstring. When they did so it cut off the head of Vishnu,</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana 14.1.1.6-9 Now he who is this Vishnu is the sacrifice; and he who is this sacrifice is yonder Âditya (the sun). But, indeed, Vishnu was unable to control that (love of) glory of his; and so even now not every one can control that (love of) glory of his. Taking his bow, together with three arrows, he stepped forth. He stood, resting his head on the end of the bow. Not daring to attack him, the gods sat themselves down all around him. Then the ants said&#8211;these ants (vamrî), doubtless, were that (kind called) &#8216;upadîkâ &#8216;&#8211;&#8216;What would ye give to him who should gnaw the bowstring?&#8217;&#8211;&#8216;We would give him the (constant) enjoyment of food, and he would find water even in the desert: so we would give him every enjoyment of food.&#8217;&#8211;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">&#8216;So be it,&#8217; they said. Having gone nigh unto him, they gnawed his bowstring. When it was cut, the ends of the bow, springing asunder, cut off Vishnu&#8217;s head</span>.</p>
<p>Srimad Devi Bhagavatam 1.5.23-36 &#8220;Brahmâ said :&#8211; We will give you, too, share in this our Yajña (sacrifice); so hear me; do our work and rouse Visnu from His sleep. During the time of performing Homa whatever ghee will fall outside the Homa-Kund (the sacrificial pit) will fall to your share; so be quick and do this. Sûta said:&#8211; Thus ordered by Brahmâ, the Vamrî insect soon ate away the fore end of the bow that rested on the ground. Immediately the string gave way and the bow went up; the other end became free and a terrible sound took place. The Devas bcame afraid; the whole universe got agitated; the earth trembled. The sea became swollen; the aquatic animals became startled; violent wind blew; the mountains shook; ominous meteors fell. The quarters assumed a terrific aspect; the Sun went down the horizon. In that time of distress the Devas became anxious what evil might come down. O ascetics! while the Devas were thus cogitating, the head with crown on it of the Devadeva Visnu vanished away ; no body knew where it fell. When the awful darkness disappeared, Brahmâ and Mahâdeva saw the disfigured body of Visnu with its head off. Seeing that headless figure of Visnu they were greatly surprised; they were drowned in the ocean of cares and, overwhelmed with grief, began to weep aloud…&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">INDRA VS ARJUNA</span></strong></p>
<p>Although Arjuna wasn&#8217;t a god but his adviser was Krishna so the story can be mentioned here. Actually, it was not a battle between Arjun and Indra but between Arjuna and Ashwasena but Indra decided to fight noticing that his friend&#8217;s son Ashwasena was going to get killed by Arjuna,</p>
<p>Mahabharata Adi Parva 1.229 &#8220;But Aswasena, the mighty son of Takshaka, was there. He made great efforts to escape from that fire; but confined by Arjuna&#8217;s shafts he succeeded not in finding a way. It was then that his mother, the daughter of a snake, determined to save him by swallowing him first. His mother first swallowed his head and then was swallowing his tail. And desirous of saving her son, the sea-snake rose (up from the earth) while still employed in swallowing her son&#8217;s tail. But Arjuna as soon as he beheld her escaping, severed her head from her body by means of a sharp and keen-edged arrow. Indra saw all this, and desiring to save his friend&#8217;s son, the wielder of the thunderbolt, by raising a violent wind, deprived Arjuna of consciousness.&#8221; Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">INDRA VS SAGARA&#8217;S SONS</span></strong></p>
<p>Indra uses his tactics to kill the sons of king Sagara,</p>
<p>As per the story mentioned in Srimad Bhagavatam 9.8. There was a king named Sagara who was the ancestor of Hindu god Ram. He had 60,000 sons. Instructed by sage Aurva, King Sagara performed Ashvamedha sacrifice but Indra stole the horse and left it in sage Kapila&#8217;s Ashram. Indra made Sagara&#8217;s sons lose their intelligence and disrespected the sage. As the sage was meditating and as soon as he opened his eyes the sons of Sagara were burned with the fire emanating from their own bodies</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">INDRA VS VISHWARUPA</span></strong></p>
<p>This is another version of Indra killing Vishwarupa. Geeta Kasturi summarizes the story as,</p>
<p>&#8220;The story goes that rishi Vishvarupa was very fond of his mother. She was from the family of asuras. Prompted by the affection for her, he used to give a portion of the sacrificial oblations secretly to the asuras. Indra detected the treachery of the rishi and cut off the three heads of Vishvarupa.&#8221;</p>
<p>This story iss mentioned in Srimad Bhagavatam (Bhagavad Purana) and Devi Bhagavatam,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 6.9.4 &#8220;Indra, the king of gods, noticed his contempt and faithlessness to gods and his sham righteousness. Being afraid (lest Asuras should be powerful) he immediately cut down (Visvarupa&#8217;s) heads in wrath.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Srimad Devi Bhagavaram 3.12.25 verses says that Vishwarupa would utter Mantras beneficial to gods when they were present and in the absence of gods he would pray for the welfare of Daityas.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">INDRA VS MUNI DADHYAM</span></strong></p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 7.36.28. “O Best of Mountains! It is very difficult to acquire Brahma Jñâna. Hear a story. A Muni named Dadhyam of Atharvana family went to Indra and prayed to him to give Brahma Jñâna. Indra said: &#8220;I would give you Brahma-Jñâna, but if you impart it to any other body, I would sever your head.&#8221; Dadhyarna agreed to this and Indra gave him the Brahma-Jñâna. After a few days, the two As&#8217;vins came to the Muni and prayed for Brahma Vidyâ, The Muni said:&#8211; &#8220;If I give you the Brahma-Vidyi, Indra, will cut off my head.&#8221; Hearing this the two As&#8217;vins said:&#8211; &#8220;We will cut your head and keep it elsewhere and we will attach the head of a horse to your body. Instruct us with the mouth of this horse and when Indra will cut off your this mouth, we will replace your former head.&#8221; When they said so, the Muni gave them the Brahma-Vidyâ. Indra cut off his head by his thunderbolt. When the horse-head of the Muni was cut off, the two physicians of the Devas replaced his original head. This is widely known in all the Vedas.” Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">VASHISHTHA VS VISHWAMITRA</span></strong></p>
<p>Vishwamitra came to the hermitage of sage Vashishtha. Vashishtha had a genie of the lamp-like cow perhaps known as Kamdhenu who would grant all desires. Vishwamitra became very excited about the cow so he wanted to obtain it and he asked Vasishtha for it and said that in return he would give him many cows. But Vasishtha refused so Vishwamitra became angry and wanted to take it away by force. Vishwamitra&#8217;s sons were killed by Vashistha and to avenge it Vishwamitra started performing austerities in the forest in order to obtain a boon from Shiva. Vrishadwaja (appellation of Shiva) decided to bestow a boon. Vishwamitra asks him to confer the science of archery with all its mysteries and mantras as well as its virtues and also weapons. Then Vishvamitra goes to Vasishtha&#8217;s hermitage and attacks him</p>
<p>Ramayana of Valmiki, Bala Kanda 1.55.5-7 &#8220;And seeing the army annihilated by the high-souled Vasishtha, the hundred sons of Vicwamitra, equipped with various weapons, rushed in high ire against that best of mantra-reciting ones. Thereupon, uttering a roar, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">that might ascetic consumed them quite. And in a moment, Vicwamitra&#8217;s sons together with horse and car and foot were reduced to ashes by the high-souled Vasishtha</span>.&#8221; Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Vishwamitra instigated Rakshasas to kill Vashishtha&#8217;s son and Vashishtha&#8217;s sons were also killed. And in grief, Vashishtha&#8217;s tried to commit suicide by jumping from a mountain but he fell on a heap of cotton, then he torched the forest and entered it but it didn&#8217;t burn him and then he tied a weight to his neck and drowned himself in the waters but even that didn&#8217;t kill him. He came to know that his daughter in law is pregnant so he gave up the idea of committing suicide,</p>
<p>Mahabharata Adi Parva 1.178.41-49 &#8220;Beholding Saktri thus slain and devoured, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Viswamitra repeatedly urged that Rakshasa (who was within the monarch) against the other sons of Vasishtha. Like a wrathful lion devouring small animals, that Rakshasa soon devoured the other sons of the illustrious Vasishtha that were junior to Saktri in age</span>. But Vasishtha, learning that all his sons had been caused to be slain by Viswamitra, patiently bore his grief like the great mountain that bears the earth. That best of Munis, that foremost of intelligent men, was resolved rather to sacrifice his own life than exterminate (in anger) the race of Kusikas. The illustrious Rishi threw himself down from the summit of Meru, but he descended on the stony ground as though on a heap of cotton. And, O son of Pandu, when the illustrious one found that death did not result from that fall, he kindled a huge fire in the forest and entered it with alacrity. But that fire, though burning brightly, consumed him not. O slayer of foes, that blazing fire seemed to him cool. Then the great Muni under the influence of grief, beholding the sea, tied a stony weight to his neck and threw himself into its waters. But the waves soon cast him ashore. At last when that Brahmana of rigid vows succeeded not in killing himself by any means, he returned, in distress of heart, to his asylum.&#8221; Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>

<p>Rig Veda 4.30.8-11 talks about Indra killing Usha and Rig Veda 4.18.12 talks about Indra killing his father. Although these verses are considered to be allegorical but they are still worth reading.</p>

<h2><a id="sins-hell"></a>Sins leading to hell</h2>
<p>Hinduism too has the concept of heaven and hell but unlike Abrahamic religions, Hinduism has temporary heaven and hell. The reason I am mentioning it here is because it refutes the claim of deceitful Hindus on the internet who claims that &#8216;You are free to do anything, you will not be put into hell for doing this or that thing&#8217;. Hinduism lists several sins that could lead one to hell, I am mentioning some of them like not worshiping Shivling leads one to hell, who doesn’t observe Yajnas, those who don’t follow the path laid down by Vedas, etc.,</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Vidyeshvara Samhita 1, chapter 19, verse 26 &#8220;If a brahmin does not worship the earthen phallic image he shall fall in the terrible hell with a terrible trident pierced through his body.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Krishna Janma Khanda 75.43-52 &#8220;&#8230;A fool who slanders Siva, Durga, Ganes&#8217;a, the Sun, a Brahmin, a Vaisnava and Visnu goes to the hell called the great Raurava. A person who does not maintain his parents, chaste wife, spiritual guide, and widowed sister, and widowed daughter goes to hell. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">If a Ksatriya, Vais&#8217;ya or Sudra male has no faith in Hari or a Brahmin and if a youthful woman has no faith in her husband, then these wretches undoubtedly suffer the torments of hell</span>&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Rajendra Nath Sen</p>
<p>Skanda Purana III.ii.18.156-7 &#8220;She creates obstacles for a foolish one who does not worship. He will have to witness death of the couple, destruction of wealth, great fear, pain, sickness and incidents of arson. For this reason, O Brahmanas, an intelligent devotee should worship Matangi.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 9.35.1-44 &#8220;…<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">If any Brâhmana does not worship with devotion the phallic emblem of S&#8217;iva, he goes to the dreadful S&#8217;ûlaprota Kunda for that heinous sin</span>. He remains there for one hundred years; then he becomes a quadruped animal for seven births and again he becomes born a Devala Brâhmin for seven births when he becomes freed.&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Narada Purana I.15.130b-131a &#8220;Those who have ceased to perform the rites and the yajnas for Pitrs (manes) and Devas, those who stay outside the part of the Vedas, are notorious as heretics. They undergo all sorts of tortures.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Narada Purana I.15.89 &#8220;Those who have abandoned the five great sacrifices go to the hell Lalabhaksa. One who abandons worship goes to the hell Raurava. [96b-97] The person who abandons his religious duties is called a heretic by learned men. He and a person who associates with him are great sinners. They fall into hells in a serial order, in the course of thousand and millions of kalpas.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Skanda Purana II.iv.6.26 &#8220;Those foolish persons who revile noble-souled Vaisnavas, fall into hell named Maharaurava along with their manes.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana: Lalit-Mahatmya 33.84-86 &#8220;The glorious Maharudra who holds the trident is served by other Rudras, the chief among whom is Hiranyabahu. He is accompanied by those Rudranis too. With the tip of his trident, he pierces those persons who have neglected visiting Lalita, who are haughty, and who are repoached by elderly people. He burns them by means of fierce fires originating from his eyes. He destroys their wives, children and servants, He is the great hero who obediently carries out the behest of Lalitha.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Brahma Purana 106.33-38-41 &#8220;Yama&#8217;s servants said: You have not performed sacrifices at the proper time. You have not offered gifts to the brahmins. Moreover, when something was offered to brahmins you had actively prevented it. The time for the reaping of the fruits of that sin has arrived, O base men, your assets were not burnt by fire nor did they perish in water. They had not been seized by kings or robbers. Where are they now? Why were they not handed over to brahmins&#8230;On hearing the words of Yama&#8217;s servants they lose their taste therein. They are afflicted by hunger and thirst (all the more). Thereafter they are tortured by the servants of Yama with terrible weapons. The ruthless emissaries of Yama attack them from the rear with iron clubs, iron-rods, javelins, tomaras, pattisas, bhindipalas and parighas. They are bit and pierced by arrows, axes and maces. The sinners are attacked from the front by lions, tigers etc. and are eaten up by them.&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Varaha Purana 134.61-64 &#8220;Varaha said: O Earth, I shall tell you what happens to the man who offers forbidden flower for me&#8230;Fools alone dare to offer me like this and they fall into the hell called Raurava, and then, because of their ignorance, undergo a lot of suffering. They remain as monkeys for ten years, cats for thirteen years.&#8221; Tr. Venkitasubramonia Iyer</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Uma Samhita 5.10.19-20 &#8220;If men, out of greed, pluck and sniff at flowers of the temple parks, or wear them on their heads, their heads are covered with iron spikes and their noses are filled with plenty of acid and other things.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Linga Purana Section II.18.60-62 &#8220;&#8230;The lord said thus:-&#8216;O excellent-faced lady, a person who applies Bhasman is on a par with my son Ganesa. What is repugnant to them should be eschewed. A householder who is devoid of Brahman (Vedic knowledge) and who does not wear the caste mark Tripundra falls into the depths of hell. All his holy rites of worship, charitable gifts and holy ablutions are in vain like the Homa performed in the ashes.&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Vayu Purana Section II.21.59-61 &#8220;Brhaspati said: The man who after hearing this explanation of the procedure of Sraddhas, becomes malicious, is an atheist enveloped in darkness. He will drown himself in the terrible hell. He who has perfectly controlled his mind, finds all his great ailments terminated. He who is not mindful of the Asramas (stages of life) stated in the Vedas attains the Kumbhika hell. He attains the status of a thief and gets his tongue cut. Those who censure Yoga become lumps of clay in the ocean and decay as long as earth exists. Hence, this is the Dharma (virtue) intended in the Sraddha that it should be performed by a man with faith (in it.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare, edited by G.P. Bhatt</p>
<p>Padma Purana IV.1.8-13 &#8220;&#8230;For a man who would create an obstacle in the act of the narration of Visnu&#8217;s account, there is no escape from hell for a hundred period of Manu. For those who having hear the account (as narrated) in the Puranas, censure or scoff at it, always have the very afflicting hells on their hands (i.e. waiting for them)&#8230;&#8221; Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p>Shiva Purana Vayaviyasamhita 6, Section II, 41.38 &#8220;This excellent gem of Sivapurana, should not be mentioned to those who do not know the Vedas, nor should it be imparted to a disciple who is not a devotee of Siva nor to an atheist. If it is imparted to these out of delusion it yields hell.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana 2.3.19.57b-58a &#8220;After hearing these rules and regulations regarding Sraddha, if any man does not perform it, he is an atheist and he shall fall into the terrible hell enveloped in darkness.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Kurma Purana II.24.7 &#8220;Either due to atheistic feelings or due to lethargy, if anyone does not wish to maintain sacrificial fires, nor does he perform Yajnas, he falls into many hells.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Skanda Purana III.iii.22.39-41 &#8220;Men who censure a man conversant with the Puranas or the story that dispels sins, become dogs in a hundred births. The base men who talk and interrupt while the (Purana) story is progressing, will be born as donkeys first and then as chameleons.

<h3><a id="hinduism-salvation"></a>Hinduism is the only way to salvation</h3>
<p>Contrary to the much hype by Hindus. One should worship a Deva, believe in the Vedas, and sacrifice to the gods in order to attain salvation, if he doesn&#8217;t then he keeps taking rebirth and is also put in hell in between the cycles of birth as punishment. Attaining heaven is the main aim of Abrahamic religions but attaining salvation is the main aim of Hinduism. It&#8217;s mentioned in the Vedas,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 9.73.9 &#8220;The thread of the cosmic sacrifice, spread over the ultraphychic filter, extends as if, by its act up to the tip of venerable Lord&#8217;s tongue; the prudent devotees attain it; <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">but he who is incompetent and faithless shall sink into the pit of hell</span>, even whilst he is in this world.&#8221; Tr. Svami Satya Prakash Saraswati</p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.164.39 &#8220;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">They are atheists and of weak intellect, and continually remain sunk in the depths of misery and pain who do not believe in, know</span>, and commune with, Him who is Resplendent, All-glorious, All-Holy, All-knowledge, sustainer of the sun, the earth and other planets, Who pervades all like ether, is the Lord of all and is above all devatas. It is by the knowledge and contemplation of God alone that all men attain true happiness.&#8221; Tr. Dr. Chiranjiva Bhardwaja, as mentioned in the book Satyarth Prakash, By Swami Dayanand Saraswati, Ch 7, page 203.</p>
<p>Krishna said,</p>
<p>Gita 9.3 &#8220;Those who are not faithful in this devotional service cannot attain Me, O conqueror of enemies. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Therefore they return to the path of birth and death in this material world</span>.&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 11.21.1 &#8220;The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Those who give up these methods for achieving Me</span>, which consist of devotional service, analytic philosophy and regulated execution of prescribed duties, and instead, being moved by the material senses, cultivate insignificant sense gratification, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">certainly undergo the continual cycle of material existence</span>.&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>He also said,</p>
<p>Gita 8.11-13 &#8220;Persons who are learned in the Vedas, who utter oṁ-kāra, and who are great sages in the renounced order enter into Brahman. Desiring such perfection, one practices celibacy. I shall now brieﬂy explain to you this process by which one may attain salvation. The yogic situation is that of detachment from all sensual engagements. Closing all the doors of the senses and ﬁxing the mind on the heart and the life air at the top of the head, one establishes himself in yoga. After being situated in this yoga practice and vibrating the sacred syllable oṁ, the supreme combination of letters, if one thinks of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and quits his body, he will certainly reach the spiritual planets.&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Gita 4.40 &#8220;The ignorant fool, one without faith in Vedic scriptures, and one afflicted by inner doubt and uncertainty is ruined and for one afflicted by doubt and uncertainty there is no happiness in this world nor the next.&#8221;</p>
<p>Brahma Purana 65.71-73 &#8220;Thus O brahmins is the greatest abode of Visnu endowed with all enjoyable pleasures and attributes. It is conducive to the pleasures of everyone. It is holy and full of mysteries. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Atheists and profligates do not go there</span>. Nor do the following go there viz.-the ungrateful and those who are of uncontrollable sense-organs. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The devotees of Visnu who worship Vasudeva the preceptor of the universe with devotion, go to the world of Visnu</span>.&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Skanda Purana II.ii.26.28-33 &#8220;&#8230;One who installs the idol of Hari in accordance with the injunctions in the Mansion does not get involved in the bondage of physical bodies. He goes to the great region of Visnu.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Narada Purana I.41.106 &#8220;It is only through the repetition of the names of Hari that redemption is attained by the people who commit sins, who are beyond the pale of Vedic path and who are wanting in mental purity.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 7.1.32 &#8220;Somehow or other, one must consider the form of Kṛṣṇa very seriously. Then, by one of the five different processes mentioned above, one can return home, back to Godhead. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Atheists like King Vena, however, being unable to think of Kṛṣṇa&#8217;s form in any of these five ways, cannot attain salvation</span>. Therefore, one must somehow think of Kṛṣṇa, whether in a friendly way or inimically.&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 5.26.3 &#8220;…And for one who acts impiously and ignorantly because of atheism, the resultant hellish life is the worst. Because of ignorance, every living entity has been carried by various desires into thousands of different hellish planets since time immemorial. I shall try to describe them as far as possible.&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagvatam 6.1.40 &#8220;The Yamadūtas replied: That which is prescribed in the Vedas constitutes dharma, the religious principles, and the opposite of that is irreligion. The Vedas are directly the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Nārāyaṇa, and are self-born. This we have heard from Yamarāja.&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Srimad Devi Bhagavatam 6.6.29-32. &#8220;The Munis said:&#8211; &#8220;O King! All the creatures certainly enjoy the fruits of their Karmas, whether good or bad; how then, can persons, of perverted intellect, obtain peace when they do mischief to others. The treacherous persons certainly go to hell and suffer miseries always. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The slayers of Brâhmanas and the drunkards may get liberation; but never the faithless</span> and those who go against their friends get off free; <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">these will have to suffer undoubtedly in the hells</span>.&#8221; Tr.

<p>Srimad Devi Bhagavatam 6.11.57-65. &#8220;Vyâsa said:&#8211; O King! There is only one path and none other which can save a man from the sin of this Kâlî; and that is this:&#8211; The Jîvas must meditate on the lotus-feet of the Highest Devî for the purification of all their faults and sins. O King! There is so much strength in Her sin-destroying Name, that the amount of sin in this world falls much less in proportion to that. Where, then, is the cause of fear? Her Name, uttered at random, even in an unconscious state, bestows so much unspeakable results that even Hari, Hara and others have not the capacity to know that.&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>

<h2><a id="atheism"></a>Atheism</h2>
<p>This is a very important topic for discussion. Hindus claim that you can even be an atheist and attain salvation. I don&#8217;t really know what is the basis of this claim. They should furnish references showing that even an atheist who doesn&#8217;t believe in god and Veda, who never sacrificed for Devas or worshipped them can go to heaven temporarily and attain salvation. I am not challenging them but asking for educational purposes. Buddhism and Jainism are condemned in Hindu scriptures because of their atheistic doctrines then how can Hindus claim that you can be an atheist? Why do Hindu scriptures lay stress on the atheistic doctrines of Buddhism and Jainism while condemning them and rejecting them as false religions? Now they cite Mimamsa philosophy to support their argument, such atheistic doctrines are later entrants to Hinduism probably to counter Buddhism. Do they even know what Mimamsa is? Mimamsa has both theistic and atheistic doctrines, it rejects a personal god but believes in the authority of the Vedas. Now you tell me, is there any atheist on the face of this earth who claims the Vedas to be authoritative? Atheism is strongly condemned in Hindu scriptures, Vedas even call for the death of godless atheists. Buddha is criticized for rejecting the Vedas so how can Hindus claim this? If they want to prove that Atheists can attain salvation then they should furnish references showing that a man who doesn&#8217;t believe in god, in Vedas, in Brahmins, who doesn&#8217;t worship and who doesn&#8217;t sacrifice can attain salvation. That&#8217;s it. No need for further discussion. Hindu scholars have also translated the word Nastika as an infidel. Nastika in Sanskrit is literally translated as Atheist. But in Vedic (Hindu scriptures) terminology an atheist doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean the one who doesn&#8217;t believe in god, but it has several meanings like a non-Hindu is also considered to be an atheist, a censurer of Vedas is also considered an atheist, etc, let me present some sources,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 9.13.9 “O Pavamamas, driving off the godless, looking on the light, Sit in the place of sacrifice.” Tr. Ralph. T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>Rig Veda 7.6.3 “The foolish, faithless, rudely-speaking niggards, without belief or sacrifice or worship,— Far far sway hath Agni chased those Dasytis, and, in the cast, hath turned the godless westward.” Tr. Ralph. T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>Kurma Purana II.24.10 &#8220;He who is one who maintains sacrificial fires but does not wish to perform sacrifice to the lord by means of meditation, is a confused person. He should not be conversed with. What more (need be said) that man is an atheist.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Varaha Purana 58.5-6 &#8220;Visnu should be considered as Rudra and Laksmi as Gauri. He who speaks of difference between them is lowly (Adhama) and should be considered an atheist outside the field of dharma.&#8221; Tr. Venkitasubramonia Iyer, J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 4.2.30 &#8220;Bhṛgu Muni continued: Since you blaspheme the Vedas and the brāhmaṇas, who are followers of the Vedic principles, it is understood that you have already taken shelter of the doctrine of atheism.&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>&#8220;The &#8216;infidel&#8217; is one who has no religion, his son is &#8216;the son of an infidel&#8217;. <strong>Vijnanesvara in Mitakshara on Yajnavalkya Smriti verse 244</strong></p>
<p>Swami Prabhupada wrote, &#8220;…An atheist is called a demon, and it is a fact that even a person born of good parents can turn into a demon by bad association…&#8221; <strong>Swami Prabhupada on Srimad Bhagavatam 3.3.6</strong><br />

<p>Swami Prabhupada also wrote, &#8220;Bhṛgu Muni, in cursing Nandīśvara, said that not only would they be degraded as atheists because of this curse, but they had already fallen to the standard of atheism because they had blasphemed the Vedas, which are the source of human civilization. Human civilization is based on the qualitative divisions of social order, namely the intelligent class, the martial class, the productive class and the laborer class. The Vedas provide the right direction for advancing in spiritual cultivation and economic development and regulating the principle of sense gratification, so that ultimately one may be liberated from material contamination to his real state of spiritual identification (ahaṁ brahmāsmi). As long as one is in the contamination of material existence, one changes bodies from the aquatics up to the position of Brahmā, but the human form of life is the highest perfectional life in the material world. The Vedas give directions by which to elevate oneself in the next life. The Vedas are the mother for such instructions, and the brāhmaṇas, or persons who are in knowledge of the Vedas, are the father. Thus if one blasphemes the Vedas and brāhmaṇas, naturally one goes down to the status of atheism. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The exact word used in Sanskrit is nāstika, which refers to one who does not believe in the Vedas but manufactures some concocted system of religion</span>…&#8221; <strong>Swami Prabhupada on Srimad Bhagavatam 4.2.30 </strong>http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_4.2.30</p>
<p><strong>He also wrote</strong>, &#8220;The Buddhists are called atheists because they have no respect for the Vedas, but those who defy the Vedic conclusions, as above mentioned, under the pretense of being followers of the Vedas, are verily more dangerous than the Buddhists.&#8221; <a href="http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_Introduction" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_Introduction<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 4.2.30 &#8220;By blaspheming the principles of the Vedas, which are the pure and supreme path of the saintly persons, certainly you followers of Bhūtapati, Lord Śiva, will descend to the standard of atheism without a doubt.&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>

<h3><a id="punishment-atheists"></a>Punishment for Atheists</h3>
<p>Skanda Purana V.iii.227.1-10 &#8220;[Sri Markandeya said]&#8230;Persons who have no faith, those who are atheists fall into the terrible Naraka. So said Paramesvara&#8230;&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>People who commit these sins are considered criminals</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti 37.44. Reviling the Veda; [30-31] Studying irreligious books; Atheism;</p>
<p>Vamana Purana 40.35-36 &#8220;Therefore Dharma is not to be shunned, for Dharma is the supreme goal. Men devoid of Dharma go to the wide Raurava hell. Dharma, they say, enables a safe passage in heaven and here and Adharma leads to downfall in this world and the next.&#8221; Tr. Anand Swarup Gupta</p>
<p>Narada Purana I.15.79-80 &#8220;I shall tell you the sufferings of the atheists who turn their faces away from Hara and Hari. They will be compelled to eat salt for ten million years. Then, they are scorched and fried in red hot sand in Raurava hell. These men of sinful acts remain in that hell for the period of a Kalpa. O ruler of men, in other hells also (they are tortured) like this.&#8221;  Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 11.5.15 &#8220;These godless people hate Lord Hari-their very indwelling self who abides in the bodies of others as well (as their Soul); and fixing their attachment to their mortal body and its relatives (wives, sons, etc.), they fall down deep into hell.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Kurma Purana II.19.31-32 &#8220;If any Brahmana does not practise his duty either due to atheism or due to lethargy, he falls into the terrible hells and is reborn as a crow. There is no other way for liberation excepting performance of the duties of one&#8217;s own Asrama (stage of life). Hence one should perform the holy rites for the satisfaction of Paramesthin (god Brahma).&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 3.17.5-7 “PARÁŚARA.&#8211;The Rig, Yajur, and Sáma Vedas constitute the triple covering of the several castes, and the sinner who throws this off is said to be naked (or apostate). The three Vedas are the raiment of all the orders of men, and when that is discarded they are left bare. On this subject hear what I heard my grandfather, the pious Vaśisht́ha, relate to the magnanimous Bhíshma.” Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Skanda Purana V.ii.67.23-31 &#8220;&#8230;[Isvara said] a voice issued from the firmament as uttered by me in compassion: &#8216;Do not say anything out of the way. The immutable Srutis should not be censured. The Puranas spoken by Brahma, the creator of the worlds, cannot be otherwise. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The atheists who censure the Puranas and Dharmasastras fall into the terrible hell and remain there till all living beings are annihilated</span>.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Narasima Purana 53.15-16 &#8220;&#8230;I salute god Kesava the supreme intuitive, who protects the godly persons who are religion abiding by killing the wicked and atheists through his incarnation in varied forms and in every age&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Joshi K.L. Shastri and Bindiya Trivedi</p>
<p>Atheists are condemned in Hindu scriptures,</p>
<p>Brahma Purana 46.60-61 &#8220;This hymn is conducive to wealth. It dispels sins. It is auspicious. It bestows worldly pleasures and salvation. It is a rare esoteric secret. It is sacred. It should not be imparted to any one and everyone. It should not be imparted to an atheist, a fool, an ungrateful person, an arrogant or to one of wicked intellect. It should never be handed over to a knave.&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Brahma Purana 60.16 &#8220;O excellent Brahmins, the knowledge of the purana should not be imparted to an atheist&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Kurma Purana II.26.67 &#8220;A person who knows Dharma should not offer even water to an atheist or a heretic or to a sceptic or to a person who does not know the Vedas.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Brahmanda purana 2.3.14.43 &#8220;One shall discard the very sight of these viz-the Brahman slayer, the ungrateful one, the atheist, the defiled of the preceptor&#8217;s bed, the robber and the ruthless person.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Kurma Purana II.21.43-44 &#8220;The following are defilers of rows:- an ungrateful person, a back-biter, a ruthless person, an atheist, person who censures the Vedas, a person injuring friends and a cheat. All these should not be fed (in a Sraddha). They cannot be given any gift in holy rites&#8230;&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Brahma Purana 137.52-53 &#8220;Thus, O excellent sages, the great Liberation, the essences, has been recounted by me. On realising it one does not return. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">It should not be imparted to an atheist or to a person who is not a devotee</span>. O brahmins, it should not be imparted to an evil-minded person nor to a person who has no faith and who is averse to everything good.&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>

<p>Rig Veda 1.33.4 &#8220;&#8230;As atheistic un-righteous persons who revile God are ruined by His Powers or germs are destroyed by the rays of the sun, in the same manner, you should endeavour to put an end to the lives of those wicked persons who forcibly take away and enjoy other&#8217;s articles and who do not perform Yajnas and other noble deeds who are utterly selfish.&#8221; Tr. Acharya Dharma Deva Vidya Martanda</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t use some of these Vedic verses in the article Killing infidels in Vedas. Just look at what Muni Ved Vyasa says in Mahabharata,</p>
<p>Mahabharata Santi Parva 12.34-35 &#8220;[Vyasa said] I shall now mention other acts that men should not do, viz., acts that are interdicted by both the world and the Vedas. Listen to me with concentrated attention. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The rejection of one&#8217;s own creed, the practice of other people&#8217;s creed</span>, assisting at the sacrifice or the religious rites of one that is not worthy of such assistance…<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">these all have been pronounced by persons conversant with duty to be acts that no one should do</span>.&#8221; Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Other Mahabharata verses show how infidels are roasted in hell,</p>
<p>Mahabharata, Santi Parva 12.181.4-5 &#8220;Those that are virtuous in their acts, and possessed of faith, and that have their senses under control, become born as affluent men and repeatedly sport in festivities and heaven and happiness. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Unbelievers, with their arms manacled, are sent to regions rendered inaccessible by carnivorous beasts and elephants and full of terrors in consequence of snakes and robbers</span>. What more need be said of them?&#8221; Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Mahabharata, Santi Parva 12.323 &#8220;They that are unbelievers have to pass, with groping hands, through regions infested by beasts of prey and elephants and pathless tracts teeming with snakes and robbers and other causes of fear. What more need be said of these?&#8221; Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 3.9.4 &#8220;&#8230;we offer obeisance to you (a gracious) Lord who is spurned by the atheists (like Mimamsakas, Sankhyas etc.) and believers in false logic and who therefore deserve (stay in) Hell.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Buddhists beware you will go</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;">to hell</span></strong>,</p>
<p>Srimad Devi Bhagavatam 11.1.25-37 &#8220;…<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Whatever goes clearly against the Vedas can in no way be accepted as a proof. In matters concerning Dharma, the Vedas is the Sole Proof</span>. Therefore that which is not against the Vedas can be taken as proof; otherwise not. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Whoever acts Dharma according to other proofs than what is ordained in the Vedas, goes to the hell in the abode of Yama to get his lesson</span>. So the Dharma that is by all means to be accepted as such, is what is stated in the Vedas. The Smritis, the Purâ<span style="text-decoration: underline;">n</span>as, or the Tantra S&#8217;âstras can be taken also as authoritative when they are not conflicting to Vedas. Any other S&#8217;âstras can be taken as authoritative when it is fundamentally coincident with the Vedas. Else it can never be accepted. Those who do injury to others even by the blade of a Kus&#8217;a grass used as a weapon, go to hell with their heads downwards and their feet upwards. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Those that follow their own sweet free will, that take up any sort of dress (e. g. Bauddhas)</span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">those that follow the philosophical doctrines called Pâs&#8217;upatas, and the other hermits and saints and persons that take up other vows contrary to the religions of the Vedas, for example, the Vaikhânasa followers, those who brand their bodies by the hot Mudrâs, at the places of pilgrimages, e. g. Dvârkâ, etc., </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">they go to hell with their bodies scorched by red hot brands (Tapta Mudrâs)</span>. So persons should act according to the excellent religions commanded by the Vedas…&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Padma Purana VI.253.36-39 &#8220;That devotee of Visnu, who does not practise the acts prescribed in the Srutis and Smrtis, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">becomes a heretic, and would stay in the Raurava hell</span>. Therefore, a man should offer to the lord of the world a worship fit for his caste&#8230;&#8221; Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p>Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Krishna Janma Khanda 75.62-77 &#8220;&#8230;A Brahmin who does not worship Visnu is like a Chandal; and one who adopts the tenets of Bama (name of Gouri, Laksmi or Saraswati) goes to hell&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Rajendra Nath Sen</p>
<p>Narada Purana, Uttarabhaga 21.38 &#8220;These persons are to be punished and given capital punishment- he who eschews Visnu the foremost among the gods and worships any other deity&#8230;&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Skanda Purana VII.I.3.144 &#8220;Thus the foolish ones will say, others will laugh. The non-beleivers, the people destined to fall into hell, get their minds overwhelmed by sins. At the advent of Kali Age, they will never gain Siddhi.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Krisna Janma Khanda 75.73-82 &#8220;&#8230;Even the worship of Siva&#8217;s male organ for one time after having constructed it with clay or cow dung and sand secures dwelling in heaven for a hundred ages: and whoever worships a hundred such organs obtains the desired meed; and whoever worships a hundred thousand such organs attains the position of S&#8217;iva, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">but one who does not worship S&#8217;va goes to hell. Those who slander or calumniate the venerable, and most lovely S&#8217;iva dwell in hell as long as Brahma exists and suffer endless torments</span>.&#8221; Tr. Rajendra Nath Sen.</p>
<p>Linga Purana Section II.11.35-37 &#8220;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">If people forsake Linga and begin to worship other deities they will go to the Raurava hell along with the king</span>, their ruler. If a king ceases to be a devotee of Siva and becomes attached to other Devas, it is like the behaviour of a young woman who discarding her husband revels among her paramours.&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Kurma Purana I.12.259-61 &#8220;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The hells such as Tamisra and others were created beneath the earth by god Brahma for those people who do not practise the duties prescribed in my Dharma</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">There is no scripture other than the Vedas which lays down what is Dharma</span>. A person who takes delight in other things (not sanctioned by the Vedas), should not even talked to by twice-born persons viz. Brahmanas, Ksatriyas and Vaisyas. Those various scriptures which are contrary to Srutis and Smrtis seen in this world, are based on Tamo-guna or ignorance. Belief in them or practising in accordance with them is a Tamasa activity.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Padma Purana V.96.49b-76a &#8220;Yama said: Those men who are averse to religion through their deeds mind and words, and <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">who are without (i.e. who do not have) devotion to Visnu, go to hell</span>. Those men who look upon Brahma, Sankara and Visnu as different (from one another), and who are detached from knowledge about Visnu, go to hell&#8230;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">A man who worships what should not be worshipped, and does not worship what should be worshipped, and is disinterested in the knowledge about Visnu, suffers in many hells</span>&#8230;Those who, when proper time has come, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">do not devoutly offer sraddha through atheism or greed or delusion are roasted in hell&#8230;and who is inclined to atheism, would live in the abode of hell</span>&#8230;Those who, even after seeing the door of (the temple of) the lord or (even after hearing) his name or the sacred text (even after seeing) his attendants, do not salute etc. become the residents of hell&#8230;.&#8221; Tr.

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Who becomes an infidel?</span></strong></p>
<p>As you may know, whatever we are today is because of the deeds of our past lives as per Hinduism. A person is born as a Shudra or a Chandala because he committed theft in his previous life etc. So what makes one non-Hindu?</p>
<p>Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Krishna Janma Khanda 85.159-169 &#8220;&#8230;One the days of the five important festivals, a man must abstain from woman, oil, fish and flesh. The great fool who violates this rule must go to the hell called &#8216;the tooth of thunder or adamant.&#8217; <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">That sinner after having lived there in great pain turns into an infidel for seven births</span> and a chandal for seven births. <span style="color: #ff0000;">A wretch who does not bow to a Brahmin or an idol remains impure all his life and is afterwards born as an infidel</span>.&#8221; Tr.

<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 5.26.14-15 &#8220;He who bears malice towards his parents, Brahmanas and the Vedas is hurled into the hell called Kalasutra. It is a plain of a copper-sheet ten thousand Yojanas in area. The sheet of copper is heated by fire from below and the Sun from above&#8230;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">They (servants of Yama) throw in the hell called Arispatravana (a forest of trees with sword-like leaves) a person who, while in this world, abandons his Vedic way of life even when there was no calamity and embraces a heretic sect. They strike him with a whip. And while he runs hither and thither (to avoid whipping), all the limbs of his body are cut down by the two-edged sword-like leaves of the palm trees thereof</span>. Crying with exceuciating pain, &#8216;Alas! I am killed&#8217;, he falls in a swoon at every step.

<p><strong>Manmath Nath Dutt translates it as</strong> &#8220;&#8230;He that, when no danger threatens, forsakes the path of the Veda and follows that of a heretic, is thrown by the servants of Yama into the hell named Asipatravana, and is lashed by them. The sinner, sore afflicted, rusheth about hither and thither. The leaves of the palmyra palm growing in the wood have two sharp edges like that of swords, and these teat his body grievously. Then the wreth, suffering greatly, exclaims: &#8216;Ah! I am undone&#8217;; and stumbles at every step on account of the severe torment he undegoes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Srimad Devi Bhagavatam 8.22.2-52 &#8220;…The man who, getting even a trifling wealth and food-stuff, does not perform the five Mahâ Yajñâs and gives not a share of that to the Devas and feeds his own belly with that like a crow, is taken by the ferocious Yamadûtas to the worst Krimibhojana Naraka for his sinful deeds. This hell is one lakh Yoyanas wide and is the reservoir of worms. It causes terror to the inhabitants of the hell. That sinner assumes the form of an insect and is eaten up on return by the insects and thus passes his time there. When a man does not give any share to the Atithis or the guests and does not offer oblations to the Fire and eats his food, he, too, goes to the above hell…<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">He who transgresses the path of the Vedas in times other than those of calamity and danger and follows other paths even to a trifling distance, that sinner is taken by Yamadûtas to Asipatra Kânana and there whipped severely. Not being able to bear that, he runs wildly to and fro and is pierced by the sharp edged Asi leaves on both his sides. His whole body being cut asunder</span>, he cries &#8220;Oh!

<p>There are some examples where demons devoted to Devas were killed soon after they left the Vedic religion and embraced other religions like Buddhism and Jainism.

<p>Matysa Purana 24.47-49 &#8220;&#8230;<span style="color: #ff0000;">Brihaspati then went and deluded the other sons of Raji with </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">false philosophy and established the Jina religion</span> opposed to the Vedas, though himself a knower of the Vedas and <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Indra on finding the sons of Brihaspati propagating a religion different from the Vedas based on a show of reason only killed them with his mighty thunderbolt</span>.&#8221; Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>Rig Veda 8.85.15 might be related to this verse.</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 4.19.6-7 &#8220;…replied Vrihaspati, &#8220;I had been applied to by you before, I could have done anything for you that you wished; as it is, I will endeavour and restore you in a few days to your sovereignty.&#8221; So saying, he commenced a sacrifice for the purpose of increasing the might of Indra, and of leading the sons of Raji into error, and so effecting their downfall. Misled by their mental fascination, the princes became enemies of the Brahmans, regardless of their duties, and contemners of the precepts of the Vedas; and thus devoid of morality and religion, they were slain by Indra, who by the assistance of the priest of the gods resumed his place in heaven…&#8221; Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 9.17.15 &#8220;Brhaspati, then offered oblations to fire (with malevolent purpose against the sons of Raji and made them stray from the path of religion) and Indra slew them once and all as they swerved from the path (of righteousness) and not a single son (of Raji) survived.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Also mentioned in Vishnu Purana book 4 chapter 9 which H.H. Wilson summarizes as &#8220;Descendants of Raji, son of Áyus: Indra resigns his throne to him: claimed after his death by his sons, who apostatize from the religion of the Vedas, and are destroyed by Indra. Descendants of Pratíkshatra, son of Kshatravriddha.&#8221;</p>
<p>A story in Shiva Purana goes like this,</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Rudra Samhita 2, Yuddhakanda 5, chapter 4, verses 1 &#8220;[Sanathkumara said] For causing obstacles in their virtuous activities, Visnu of great brilliance, created a Purusa* born of himself. [9-12] <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Let your name be Arihat</span>. You will have other auspicious names too. I shall assign to you a place afterwards. Now hear with reverence what is relevant to the context. O you who wield Maya, create a deceptive sacred text of sixteen hundred thousand verses, contrary to Srutis and Smritis wherein Varnas and Asramas shall be eschewed. Let that holy text be in Apabramsa language&#8230;I shall bestow on you the ability to create it. Different kinds of magic arts shall be subsevient to you. [18-20] O ascetic, no doubt, Vedic and Smarta rites flourish and shine there. But these shall certainly be exploded through this Vidya. O you shaven head, you shall go there for destroying the residents of the three cities. Revealing the Tamasika rites, destroy the three cities. After that, O great one, you shall go to the desert region and stay there carrying on your own duties and activities till the advent of the Kali age. When the Kali age begins let your Dharma be revealed. You shall then continue to do so by means of disciples and disciple&#8217;s disciples.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Rudrasamhita 2, Yuddha Khanda 5, chapter 10, verse 29 &#8220;Since they had refrained from the worship of Siva, hundreds of Asuras were burnt by the fire generated by the arrow. They cried &#8216;Ha Ha&#8217; in distress.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>This story is about the burning of Tripura. This is about Jina (Jain) religion. As per this story, the residents of Tripura followed the Vedic religion and they couldn&#8217;t be killed so Vishnu created an illusory form and named him Arihat and when the residents abandoned the Vedic religion, they were burnt alive. The translator Jagdish Lal Shastri writes on the footnote of Shiva Purana, Rudra Samhita 2, Yuddhakanda 5.4.1,</p>
<p>&#8220;*According to the present context Visnu created a delusive teacher called Mayamoha who created a Mayasastra of sixteen lakhs of slokas in Apabhramsa, preaching Jina Dharma for misguiding the Asuras. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mayamoha created four sorts of preachers for the propagation of Jina Dharma</span>. He preached non-violence, forbade Srauta and Smarta rituals, discarded Varnasrama system, created an order for women that resulted in leaving their home and leading the life of nuns. In some versions, the role is assigned to Brhaspati, the preceptor of the Gods who in the guise of their preceptor Sukra deludes the Asuras&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana also has a similar story wherein demons were killed after they abandoned the Vedic religion and embraced Jainism and Buddhism. H.H. Wilson writes on chapter 4.17-18</p>
<p>&#8220;Of heretics, or those who reject the authority of the Vedas: their origin, as described by Vaśisht́ha to Bhíshma: the gods, defeated by the Daityas, praise Vishńu: an illusory being, or Buddha, produced from his body.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Buddha goes to the earth, and teaches the Daityas to contemn the Vedas: his sceptical doctrines: his prohibition of animal sacrifices. Meaning of the term Bauddha. Jainas and Bauddhas; their tenets. The Daityas lose their power, and are overcome by the gods. Meaning of the term Nagna. Consequences of neglect of duty. Story of Śatadhanu and his wife Śaivyá. Communion with heretics to be shunned.&#8221;</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 3.17.35-44 &#8220;…Upon the conclusion of their prayers, the gods beheld the sovereign deity Hari, armed with the shell, the discus, and the mace, riding on Garud́a. Prostrating themselves before him, they addressed him, and said, &#8220;Have compassion upon us, O lord, and protect us, who have come to thee for succour from the Daityas. They have seized upon the three worlds, and appropriated the offerings which are our portion, taking care not to transgress the precepts of the Veda. Although we, as well as they, are parts of thee, of whom all beings consist, yet we behold the world impressed by the ignorance of unity, with the belief of its separate existence. Engaged in the duties of their respective orders, and following the paths prescribed by holy writ, practising also religious penance, it is impossible for us to destroy them. Do thou, whose wisdom is immeasurable, instruct us in some device by which we may be able to exterminate the enemies of the gods.&#8221; <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #000000;">When the mighty Vishńu heard their request, he emitted from his body an illusory form</span>, which he gave to the gods, and thus spake <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">This deceptive vision shall wholly beguile the Daityas, so that, being led astray from the path of the Vedas, they may be put to death; for all gods, demons, or others, who shall be opposed to the authority of the Veda, shall perish by my might</span>, whilst exercised for the preservation of the world. Go then, and fear not: let this delusive vision precede you; it shall this day be of great service unto you, oh gods!&#8221; Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 3.18.1-11 &#8220;PARÁŚARA.&#8211;After this, the great delusion, having proceeded to earth, beheld the Daityas engaged in ascetic penances upon the banks of the Narmadá river; and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">approaching them in the semblance of a naked mendicant, with his head shaven, and carrying a bunch of peacock&#8217;s feathers</span>, he thus addressed them in gentle accents: &#8220;Ho, lords of the Daitya race! wherefor is it that you practise these acts of penance? is it with a view to recompense in this world, or in another?&#8221; &#8220;Sage,&#8221; replied the Daityas, &#8220;we pursue these devotions to obtain a reward hereafter; why should you make such an inquiry?&#8221; &#8220;If you are desirous of final emancipation,&#8221; answered the seeming ascetic, &#8220;attend to my words, for you are worthy of a revelation which is the door to ultimate felicity. The duties that I will teach you are the secret path to liberation; there are none beyond or superior to them: by following them you shall obtain either heaven or exemption from future existence. You, mighty beings, are deserving of such lofty doctrine.&#8221; By such persuasions, and by many specious arguments, did this delusive being mislead the Daityas from the tenets of the Vedas…&#8221; Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>This is a reference to Digambara Jains. Jain saints still carry peacock feathers with their heads shaven and roam naked.</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 3.18.7-14 &#8220;…might be the duty of those who go naked, or who go clothed in much raiment: and so the Daityas were seduced from their proper duties by the repeated lessons of their illusory preceptor, maintaining the equal truth of contradictory tenets; and they were called Arhatas, from the phrase he had employed of &#8220;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Ye are worthy (Arhatha) of this great doctrine;&#8221; that is, of the false doctrines which he persuaded them to embrace</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The foes of the gods being thus induced to apostatize from the religion of the Vedas</span>, by the delusive person sent by Vishńu, became in their turn teachers of the same heresies, and perverted others; and these, again, communicating their principles to others, by whom they were still further disseminated, the Vedas were in a short time deserted by most of the Daitya race…&#8221; Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>And then reference to Buddhist monks is made,</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 3.18.14-26 &#8220;…<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Then the same deluder, putting on garments of a red colour</span>, assuming a benevolent aspect, and speaking in soft and agreeable tones, addressed others of the same family, and said to them, &#8220;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">If; mighty demons, you cherish a desire either for heaven or for final repose, desist from the iniquitous massacre of animals (for sacrifice)</span>, and hear from me what you should do. Know that all that exists is composed of discriminative knowledge. Understand my words, for they have been uttered by the wise. This world subsists without support, and engaged in the pursuit of error, which it mistakes for knowledge, as well as vitiated by passion and the rest, revolves in the straits of existence.&#8221; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">In this manner, exclaiming to them, &#8220;Know!&#8221; (Budhyadwam), and they replying, &#8220;It is known&#8221; (Budhyate), these Daityas were induced by the arch deceiver to deviate from their religious duties (and become Bauddhas)</span>, by his repeated arguments and variously urged persuasions, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">When they had abandoned their own faith, they persuaded others to do the same</span>, and the heresy spread, and many deserted the practices enjoined by the Vedas and the laws. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The delusions of the false teacher paused not with the conversion of the Daityas to the Jaina and Bauddha heresies, but with various erroneous tenets he prevailed upon others to apostatize</span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">until the whole were led astray, and deserted the doctrines and observances inculcated by the three Vedas</span>. Some then spake evil of the sacred books; some blasphemed the gods; some treated sacrifices and other devotional ceremonies with scorn; and others calumniated the Brahmans. &#8220;The precepts,&#8221; they cried, &#8220;that lead to the injury of animal life (as in sacrifices) are highly reprehensible. To say that casting butter into flame is productive of reward, is mere childishness. If Indra, after having obtained godhead by multiplied rites, is fed upon the wood used as fuel in holy fire, he is lower than a brute, which feeds at least upon leaves. If an animal slaughtered in religious worship is thereby raised to heaven, would it not be expedient for a man who institutes a sacrifice to kill his own father for a victim…&#8221; Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 3.18.30-36 &#8220;…By such and similar lessons the Daityas were perverted, so that not one of them admitted the authority of the Vedas. When the Daityas had thus declined from the path of the holy writings, the deities took courage, and gathered together for battle. Hostilities accordingly were renewed, but the demons were now defeated and slain by the gods, who had adhered to the righteous path. The armour of religion, which had formerly protected the Daityas, had been discarded by them, and upon its abandonment followed their destruction. Thus, Maitreya, you are to understand that those who have seceded from their original belief are said to be naked, because they have thrown off the garment of the Vedas…&#8221; Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 3.18.49-50 &#8220;…Let therefore a prudent person carefully avoid the conversation, or the contact, and the like, of those heretics who are rendered impure by their desertion of the three Vedas. The ancestral rite, although performed with zeal and faith, pleases neither gods nor progenitors if it be looked upon by apostates…&#8221; Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Killing those who left Shaivite Hinduism and embraced Buddhism</span></p>
<p>Shiva Purana, RudraSamhita 2, Yuddha Khanda section 5, chapter 6, verses 28 &#8220;O lord, favourably disposed towards your devotees, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">those Asuras have resorted to Buddha&#8217;s religion</span> and philosophy, thanks to our good fortune and hence they have eschewed all Vedic sacred rites.[36-37] Shiva said:- But the great Asuras are my firm devotees. They shall be killed only by me, for they have been forced to abandon their excellent virtue under false persuasion. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Let Visnu or any one else slay them now that they have been made to abandon their Dharma</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The Asuras of the three cities have become devoid of devotion to me</span>.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>So demons couldn&#8217;t be killed because they followed the Vedic path. If demons committed sins then why weren&#8217;t they killed? Why was there a need to convert them to Buddhism and Jainism? Does being a Hindu makes one immune to all sins? If demons got power from the Vedic religion then why didn&#8217;t Hindu gods from whom the religion emanates stop it? Vishnu in Vishnu Purana 3.17.42-44 clearly says that those being led astray from the path of the Vedas shall be put to death. This one sentence of Vishnu is enough to prove the point that they were killed only because of their apostatizing from Vedic religion. Vishnu Purana book 3 chapter 18 even says that those Daityas who embraced Buddhism and Jainism and also persuaded others to do the same were led astray, meaning they followed the false religion.</p>

<h2><a id="blasphemy"></a>Blasphemy</h2>
<p>Seems like Hindu gods didn&#8217;t like to hear criticism. There are references to the punishment of blasphemers in this world and hereafter for censuring gods, Vedas, Puranas, and even for censuring Brahmins. Krishna said,</p>
<p>Gita 16.18-20 &#8220;Bewildered by false ego, strength, pride, lust and anger, the demons become envious of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is situated in their own bodies and in the bodies of others, and <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">blaspheme against the real religion</span>. Those who are envious and mischievous, who are the lowest among men, I perpetually cast into the ocean of material existence, into various demoniac species of life. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Attaining repeated birth amongst the species of demoniac life</span>.&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Gita 9.11-12 &#8220;Fools deride Me when I descend in the human form. They do not know My transcendental nature as the Supreme Lord of all that be. Those who are thus bewildered are attracted by demonic and atheistic views. In that deluded condition, their hopes for liberation, their fruitive activities, and their culture of knowledge are all defeated.&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Kurma Purana I.16.168b-170a &#8220;Those who consider Visnu as the unmanifest Atman and who are endowed with faith, but who worship Isana with a different vision (i.e. regard him as different from Visnu) are not my beloved ones. Those deluded persons who hate the creator of the world are roasted and cooked in Raurava and other hells and are not released there from even after hundreds and crores of kalpas.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Krishna Janma Khanda 40.116-141 &#8220;&#8230;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">A sinner who slanders Brahma, the creator of the world, the goddess Durga who is the best of female deities, Laksmi, Saraswati, Sita, Tulsi, Ganga, the Vedas, the mother of the Vedas, a vow, devotion, mystic formula pertaining to worship of the spiritual guide who gives formula will dwell in the hell called the &#8216;Blind well&#8217; for half the period of the longevity allotted to Brahma, where bitten by snakes he will scream dreadfully</span>. Whoever slanders Lord Harisikesa Visnu, literally, lord of senses) regarding him as an ordinary god or talks ill of the Puranas (which engender faith in Hair and are more praiseworthy than the S&#8217;rutis) or blames the cow herdess, Raddha, who sprang out of half of the body of Krisna or the ever-adorable Brahmins must dwell in the hell called Avatoda so long as Brahma exists. He dwells there with his feet upwards and face downwards surrounded by snakes. There, bitten by fearful snakes, he screams horribly and oppressed by hunger, he consumes saliva, ordure and urine. Then the fearful myrmidons of Yama in anger thrust torches into his mouth, chastise him in the morning, noon and evening, storm and thunder. He is then very much frightened and with the torments caused by beating he is rendered thirsty and drinks urine to quench his thrust.&#8221; Tr. Rajendra Nath Sen.</p>
<p>Padma Purana IV.17.14-18 &#8220;Formerly in Tretayuga there was a sinful brahmana by name Sudarsana.

He always censured the sacred texts and always condemned the vows&#8230;O brahmana, when once the time of death arrived, he died. The messengers of Yama came (to his place), and binding him they took him to Yama&#8217;s abode&#8230;[22-28] Suta said: O brahmana, then, by Yama&#8217;s order his terrible messengers threw him into faeces (where he remained) for more than a hundred ages of Manu. Freed from there he became (i.e. was born as) a village pig on the earth. For a long time he would remain in hell due to his having eaten food on the day of (i.e. sacred to) Visnu&#8230;&#8221; Tr.

<p>Vishnu Purana 1.6.29-31 &#8220;Those, however, in whose hearts the dross of sin derived from Time (Kála) was still more developed, assented not to sacrifices, but reviled both them and all that resulted from them, the gods, and the followers of the Vedas. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Those abusers of the Vedas, of evil disposition and conduct, and seceders from the path of enjoined duties, were plunged in wickedness</span>… [36-41] For those who neglect their duties, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">who revile the Vedas, and obstruct religious rites, the places assigned after death are the terrific regions of darkness, of deep gloom, of fear, and of great terror; the fearful hell of sharp swords, the hell of scourges and of a waveless sea</span>.” Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Garuda Purana 4.5-12 &#8220;…Those who despise places of pilgrimage, good men, good actions, teachers and Shining Ones; those who disparage the Purāṇas, the Vedas, the Mīmāṁsā, the Nyāya and the Vedānta…&#8221; Tr. Ernest Wood and S.V. Subrahmanyam</p>
<p>Sins that are equal to Brahmin-slaughter</p>
<p>Brahma Purana, Gautami-Mahatmya 94.35 &#8220;He who out of hatred censures Devas, Vedas, spiritual learning and the assemblage of virtuous brahmins shall be a brahmin-slayer.&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana 2.3.19.59b-60 &#8220;One who censures and reviles at yogins, meditators and those who desire Moksa, shall fall into a terrible hell. There is no doubt that even he who listens to the same falls into the hell of terrible appearance and is enveloped in darkness al round. By reviling at leading Yogins a man never goes to heaven.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Markandeya Purana 14.43-44 &#8220;&#8230;Those who have repeated the S&#8217;astra improperly; those who have given utterance to an evil word; those who have blasphemed the Veda, the gods, the dvijas and their guru; for so many year terrible bird with adamant beaks tear out those men&#8217;s very tongues as they are continually reproduced.&#8221;</p>
<p>Markandeya Purana 14.63-64 &#8220;And base men who have hearkened to blasphemy against gurus, the gods, and dvijas, and against the Vedas,-these servants of Yama continually drive iron wedges, red as fire, into the ears, of such wicked men who rejoice in such things though they bewail the while Whoever, led by anger and covetousness, have broken up and destroyed beautiful rest-houses, the abodes of gods and brahmanas, and assemblages in the temple of the gods,-Yama&#8217;s exceedingly cruel servants continually flay the skins of those men from their body by means of these sharp instruments.&#8221;</p>
<h3><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Examples</span></strong></h3>
<p>Parvati commands Hindus to kill the person who revils Shiva,</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Rudrasamhita 2, Parvatikhanda Section III.28.38-39 &#8220;[Parvati said] A person who disparages Siva is definitely worthy of being killed by Siva&#8217;s attendants. If it is a brahmin he must be dismissed or the hearer shall go away from that place immediately. This wicked man will again disparage Siva. Since he is a brahmin, he is not to be killed. He shall be abandoned. He shall not be seen at all.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 4.4.17-18 &#8220;Satī continued: If one hears an irresponsible person blaspheme the master and controller of religion, one should block his ears and go away if unable to punish him. But if one is able to kill, then one should by force cut out the blasphemer&#8217;s tongue and kill the offender, and after that one should give up his own life. Therefore I shall no longer bear this unworthy body, which has been received from you, who have blasphemed Lord Śiva. If someone has taken food which is poisonous, the best treatment is to vomit.&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Swami Prabhupada wrote &#8220;The answer to that argument is that Satī was not vilifying but defending. If possible she should have cut out Dakṣa&#8217;s tongue because he blasphemed Lord Śiva. In other words, since Lord Śiva is the protector of religion, a person who vilifies him should be killed at once, and after killing such a person, one should give up one&#8217;s life. That is the process, but because Dakṣa happened to be the father of Satī, she decided not to kill him but to give up her own life in order to compensate for the great sin she had committed by hearing blasphemy of Lord Śiva. The instruction set forth here in Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam is that one should not tolerate at any cost the activities of a person who vilifies or blasphemes an authority. If one is a brāhmaṇa he should not give up his body because by doing so he would be responsible for killing a brāhmaṇa…&#8221; <strong>Swami Prabhupada on Srimad Bhagavatam 4.4.17</strong> <a href="http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_4.4.17" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_4.4.17<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>Brahmins killed a King named Vena for blasphemeing Vishnu,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 4.14.30-35 &#8220;My dear Vidura, all good fortune unto you. The foolish King, who thought himself very learned, thus insulted the great sages, and the sages, being broken hearted by the King&#8217;s words, became very angry at him. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">All the great saintly sages immediately cried: Kill him! Kill him</span>! He is the most dreadful, sinful person. If he lives, he will certainly turn the whole world into ashes in no time. The saintly sages continued: This impious, impudent man does not deserve to sit on the throne at all. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">He is so shameless that he even dared insult the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Viṣṇu. But for King Vena, </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">who is simply inauspicious, who would blaspheme the Supreme Personality of Godhead</span>, by whose mercy one is awarded all kinds of fortune and opulence? The great sages, thus manifesting their covert anger, immediately decided to kill the King. King Vena was already as good as dead due to his blasphemy against the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus without using any weapons, the sages killed King Vena simply by high-sounding words. After all the sages returned to their respective hermitages, the mother of King Vena, Sunīthā, became very much aggrieved because of her son&#8217;s death. She decided to preserve the dead body of her son by the application of certain ingredients and by chanting mantras [mantra-yogena].&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>This is the same King Vena who embraced Jainism.</p>
<p>Some foolish minorities in India blame politicians for communal clashes, saying that they do it for elections. It&#8217;s somehow true, but Hindus don&#8217;t think like that. I haven&#8217;t seen any Hindu blaming politicians for communal clashes rather he will directly abuse the religion and blame the entire community. When dealing with the saffronized textbook, minorities say that Britishers deliberately distorted history as part of their Divide and Rule policy. But Hindus don&#8217;t say that. It were not politicians or Britishers who commanded Hindu rulers like Pushyamitra, Kinnara, Shashanka, Chola kings, etc to kill Jains and Buddhists, it were not politicians or the Britshers who ordered Hindu scholars like Adi Shankaracharya and Kumarila Bhatta to insult Jainism and Buddhism and persecute their followers, from the persecution of Buddhists and Jains, killing nearly a million Muslims in post-Independce riots, 1984 Anti-Sikh riots, pulling down the mosque, numerous riots where Muslims were targeted, anti-Christian Kandhamal riots, vandalization of Churches and Mosques, numerous hate speeches against minorities by Hindu leaders, there is something common. All these drew inspiration from the hate preached by their religion. I may sound like a Hindutvadi because I am speaking in their language that&#8217;s because I am responding to them in the language they understand the most.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="color:#333333;">Written by Abd al-Muhsin Al Hindy</p>
<p style="color:#333333;">In this part we will see some more heinous acts legislated by the barbaric Vedas. We’ve seen how Hindūs are ever zealous in maligning Islām, alleging it to be ‘violent’ , intolerant but have the people seen the true ‘teachings’ of this self-claimed ‘ahinsac’(non-violent) religion? Let’s read the ‘unholy’ verses of their so-called Holy book ‘vedas’.</p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span id="more-852"></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:#000080;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><strong style="font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">Intolerance and killing in vedas</span></span></strong><strong style="font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"> &#8211;</span></strong></span></span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:red;">“<strong style="font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">Food to him</span></strong> </span>who knows the science of air, and to him <strong style="font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:red;">who is the chief killer</span></span></strong><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:red;">. </span>Homage to the expert in the construction of houses, and to their protector. Food to the wealthy, and to him who makes the wicked weep. Homage to him who abhors sin and to him who practices Virtue”</span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">&#8211; [Yajurveda Ch 16, verse 39, pg.173, Tr. Devi Chand]</span></span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">“We learned persons accept as our ruler, thee, the introducer of new plans for our advancement, the master of loyal subjects, the embodiment of virtue, the most advanced in noble qualities and acts,<span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:red;"> <strong style="font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">the queller of the irreligious</span></strong>, </span>the pure, the specimen of endurance, the master of prowess, and the helper and educator of all.”</span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">– [Yajurveda Ch 7, verse 36, pg.77, Tr. Devi Chand]</span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">The verse quoted above speak for themselves, the second verse commands killing of irreligious and here this is one of the reasons why<strong style="font-style:inherit;"><em style="font-weight:inherit;">‘learned person’</em></strong> are accepting, a ruler, due to his intolerance towards who are irreligious! While the first verse praises ‘Chief-killer’ by stating food to him who’s the chief killer! We need no more statements from the vedas; these amply put our point in place. And these are the verses from the book of a religion which often labels itself as ‘ahimsac’ (non-violent). Such cults and religions often label themselves as non-violent in order to hide the true face of their creed.</span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:#000080;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><strong style="font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">Killing irreligious foes in Vedas-</span></strong></span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:red;">“O king, <strong style="font-style:inherit;">make progress</strong> in <strong style="font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">thy duty of administration</span></strong>, extend happiness to the virtuous. <strong style="font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">O terrible chastiser, burn down the irreligious foes.</span></strong> O splendid person, humiliate and consume utterly like dried up stubble, him, who encourages our foe.”</span></span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">– [Yajurveda, Ch 13, verse 12, pg.138, Tr. Devi Chand]</span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">Above verse <strong style="font-style:inherit;">commands</strong> protestant <strong style="font-style:inherit;">Hindū King</strong> to burn down irreligious foes like stubble, this is what protestant Hindūs call ‘tolerance’. And this is reagarded as progress in the administrative duty of a <strong style="font-style:inherit;">Hindū King! </strong>We’ve always found Hindūs criticizing Muslims and belittling them as barbarians, because few so-called Muslims rulers allegedly have been intolerant and have killed thousands of Hindūs, while conquering India. This is the <strong style="font-style:inherit;"><em style="font-weight:inherit;">‘Classical hypocrisy’</em></strong> of Hindūs; they’ve always criticized people for being barbaric, intolerant and violent against Hindūs, but what about these unholy verses from their so-called holy books? Islām never allowed such barbaric acts , but if some Muslim indulge into such acts then he’s to be blamed not Islām, but Islāmophobes like Agniveer have always blamed Islām – this shows their bias, irrationality and unreasonable state of mind. But now we question, what about Hindūism which quite evidently is commanding Hindūs to kill innocents because they are irreligious?</span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">Burning of irreligious people! , still we find protestant Hindūs adamantly criticizing Islām and other faiths with so-called intolerance, extremism, fundamentalism and violence, when their religion itself is the paragon of such barbaric thing</span></span>s.</span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:#000080;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><strong style="font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">Mass-carnage, killing of innocents – children, females, sick, old, commanded and encouraged in vedas:</span></strong></span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">Now let’s see what the barbaric Vedas have to say about this, we’ll</span></span></span><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"> show our readers what the so-called “Ahinsac” (non-violent) Vedas command.</span></span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:red;">“<strong style="font-style:inherit;">O friendly countrymen, encourage the commander of the army</strong></span>, and begin the battle with him, who with his physical, mental and militarystrength,<span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:red;"> <strong style="font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">cleaves the enemies’ families</span>, <span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">usurps their land</span></strong>, </span>is armed with weapons, <span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:red;">slay’s the foes</span></span>, subdues the enemy in the battle, and conquers him.” – [Yajurveda, Chapter 17, verse 38, pg-182, Tr. Devi Chand]</span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:red;">“<strong style="font-style:inherit;">May the commander of the army</strong></span>, who, with<span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:red;"> <strong style="font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">surpassing vigour pierces in the battles the families of the enemies</span></strong>, <strong style="font-style:inherit;">is pitiless</strong>,<strong style="font-style:inherit;"> wild with anger</strong>, </span>unconquerable by foes, conqueror of the enemy’s forces, unequalled in fight, and victor, protect our armies.”</span></span></p>

<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">Interestingly, Vedas teach protestant Hindūs to usurp the lands of those who’ve been invaded, annihilate, and tear apart the families of the enemy! Another Vedic verse commands the King <em style="font-weight:inherit;">(in Hindi translation and ‘Indra’ in English translation and Original Sanskrit )</em> to expel the enemies out of their homes and kill/demolish those who fight Hindūs</span></span></span></p>

<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">– [, Atharvaveda, 6.75.1]</span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">Look at these inhuman verses from the vedas! Now what does the hatemongers (agniveer et .el)say? We know they do not have any answers nor will they will dare to answer us. This is what is called ‘hypocrisy’ and Mūlshankar and his blind-followers are full with it. We wonder why these people cry about the alleged killing of innocents by Arab invaders, when their own ‘holy’ book orders to Hindu commander-in-chief to mercilessly kill the whole families including children, old, sick, women …etc Why these islamphobes complaining when their own ‘holy’ book, call for mass carnage of innocents! Why? Because they are Hypocrites, what more proof will an unbiased person need?<br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:#000080;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><strong style="font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">Looting is the way to prosperity according to vedas (‘battle is the source of thy (hindūs) prosperity’):</span></strong></span></span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">Now let’s go to looting, . Let’s see what the Hindū scriptures state about it. Looting is the way to prosperity this is the principle expounded by the Vedas, and other protestant Hindū texts.</span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">“<strong style="font-style:inherit;">Chariots and horses, elephants, parasols, money, grain, cattle, <span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:red;">women</span>, all sorts of (marketable) goods and valueless metals</strong><strong style="font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">belong to him who takes them (singly) conquering (the possessor).</span></strong>”</span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">– [Manu Smriti, Chapter 7, verse 96, pg 231]</span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">Now, when Manu Shāstra itself says that all the marketable goods and other materials belong to the conqueror, then why is it the followers of Manu Shāstra (protestant Hindūs) are found crying when Arab invaders took few things similar to it? Why? Answer is Hypocrisy! It’s not this simple, in fact according to Vedas battles are considered as source of prosperity as battles include looting. Read with your own eyes.</span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><strong style="font-style:inherit;">“<span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:red;">Thou, head of the state, the conqueror of enemies</span></strong>, the lord of five classes of subjects under thy sway, and armies, strong in body and soul, take with thy meals, invigorating herbs, for pleasure and conquest.

<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">Just compare these barbaric teachings of Vedas to the divine merciful teachings of Islām; we’ve stated the Islāmic stance of the issues relayed above.

Well, if no then let us explore these things right from the vedas.So does vedas ask Hindūs to dominate the world, by occupying it and conquering it with force? Does vedas ask Hindūs to spread Vedic dharma with sword? Nope we won’t answer! Let the vedas speak for themselves,</span></span></p>

We need not expound on it in detail, simply put the above verse asks Hindūs to subdue all the regions of the world, and win it with force and destructive military weapons. This verse asks Hindūs to dominate the world, and subdue it, still we find these Hindūs claiming to be Ahinsac?</span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">And, so does another verse in the vedas ask Hindūs to conquer and dominate the world with force,</span></span></p>

<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">Nope, Vedas have more to say, they ask the Hindū King to take everything under his control right from animals to every human on earth, everything.</span></span></p>

<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">So why do we find, Hindūs criticizing Muslims, for conquering and invade India? When their own vedas asks them to invade every nation, every part on earth, subdue it, conquer it and take everything under control! Coming to the duties of king as legislated by, and what do vedas legislate and sanctify the King for?</span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">“O king, just as the wise and aged persons, in this world, created by the Effulgent God, accept thee, with the force and strength of vital breaths, and attraction and retention of breath, the source of strength; <strong style="font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">so do I.

<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">What did our readers read? Yes, Vedas santify the Hindū king to ruler over the world, in short asking him to conquer the entire world, cut the throats of sinners, remove the foes of Hindūs! And these people call themselves Ahinsac! Is there any bigger lie than this? And here again we prove how vedas command Hindūs to subdue other civilizations and religions and rule the world with brute-force.And what more duties do the vedas, have legislated for the Hindū kings? Again let the Vedas speak for it,</span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">“<strong style="font-style:inherit;">O king, thou art our leader</strong>; thou putteth upon the path of rectitude, even the leaders of a high order.

<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">So we learn, that the <strong style="font-style:inherit;">foremost </strong>duty of a Hindū king is to maintain and strengthen Hindū <em style="font-weight:inherit;">(Vedic)</em> supremacy and rule over the earth, another very important duty is to propogate so-called religious truths <em style="font-weight:inherit;">(i.e. Vedic Dharma)</em> And still we find Hindūs <em style="font-weight:inherit;">(protestant and Orthodox)</em> criticizing Islām, for proselytisation and conquering the world with force <em style="font-weight:inherit;">(an allegation!)</em>, whereas the same things are taught, legalised and prescribed by vedas, so why criticize Islām?Let’s move further and see some how do the vedas ask its followers to preach the vedic dharma, we’ve seen how the vedas asks Hindū kings to uphold the Vedic Supremacy and spread the so-called vedic-truths.So do vedas allow using “sword” for the spread of vedic Dharma? Or is sword used by Hindūs to spread their religion? Or what do a Hindū King have to do to spread his Vedic truth and how? And how is a Hindū King need to spread Vedic dharma? Well, parts of these questions are pretty clear, from the earlier quoted Vedic verses, but let’s focus a bit more on preachng of Vedic dharma and the methods shown by vedas.</span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:#000080;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><strong style="font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">Vedic dharma and the sword – An unbreakable relationship:</span></strong></span></span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">So why do vedas sanctify Hindū Kings or command Hindū Kings to subdue all regions, conquer all parts of the earth and control every being?Why is this the foremost duty of a Hindū King? Well, so that the same sword used to subdue all the civilizations of earth could be used to spread the Vedic dharma! And this is quite explicit from the following verse.</span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><strong style="font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">“O learned person</span></strong>, just as the sun kindled in forefront of Mornings, with forward light, long-active, waxing mighty, with thirty three supernatural powers of nature, the Thunder-wielder, smites dead the cloud, and throws light on the portals, so do thou <strong style="font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:red;">with the help</span></span></strong><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:red;"><strong style="font-style:inherit;">of warriors kill the foes,</strong></span><strong style="font-style:inherit;"> and <span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:red;">open the doors of knowledge and religion</span></strong></span>.”</span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">– [Yajurveda Ch 20, verse 36, pg.221, Tr. Devi Chand]</span></span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">This is crystal clear! Above Vedic verse <span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">commands killing foes and opening the doors of knowledge and religions</span>, meaning that the Vedic dharma is to be spread with sword after conquering the lands, curtailing the army of enemies! And we find protestant Hindūs claiming Islām was spread with sword when their own religion commands to spread their Vedic dharma with sword so what should such a behaviour be labeled as? Hypocrisy! Look how Hindū Kings and soldiers are asked to spread their religion with sword! What more proof will an unbias person need to acknowledge the hypocrisy of Mūlshankar and his cult?</span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">Once a Hindū King is in power or is ruling any tribe/nation/island his <strong style="font-style:inherit;">foremost</strong> duty according to vedas is to “<strong style="font-style:inherit;">strengthen thy rule over the Earth</strong><em style="font-weight:inherit;">”, (foremost because this same sword and rule then can be used to force vedic dharma on the conquered people)</em><strong style="font-style:inherit;"> </strong>then<strong style="font-style:inherit;"> </strong>he is to look after the administration…etc of the earth and then he is <strong style="font-style:inherit;">“propagate the religious truth”.</strong>So we see that the reason behind subduing the entire earth and controlling it is the “<strong style="font-style:inherit;">foremost” </strong>duty of king so that vedic dharma can easily be forced upon the people!</span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">Now let’s see how vedas are to be preached? Well, again let vedas talk,</span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">“<strong style="font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">For them</span></strong>, who are the protectors of paths and pedestrians, the producers of corn on the earth, <strong style="font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:red;">who fight with full force, against their enemies</span>, <span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:red;">we transport our weapons to places a thousand leagues afar.</span></strong><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:red;"> <strong style="font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">For them, who with arrows in their hand, and armed with sword</span></strong></span><strong style="font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">, <span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:red;">preach the study of the vedas</span></span></strong> <strong style="font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">and the <span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:red;">use of ships</span>, we <span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:red;">send out weapons</span> to <span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:red;">places a thousand leagues afar</span></span></strong>.”</span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">– [Yajurveda, Ch. 16, verses 61-62, pg175-176, Tr. Devi Chand]</span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">This is the way how vedas are preached! Hindūs fight the enemy with full force and transport weapons to thousands of leagues far so as to spread their Vedic dharma.And Hindūs are also commanded, to preach the study of vedas armed with sword and arrows, and using the ships to send out weapons to the Hindū armies killing, looting, usurping lands and forcing Vedic dharma on other civilizations, preaching with swords and hands in arrow inorder to awe-inspire the people so that they may leave their religions and embrace the vedic dharma..The above verse clearly instructs the Hindūs to launch a dharma Yudh against other civilizations and nations; so as to annihilate their enemies and spread the vedas with sword, nothing can be clearer than this.Sword and deadly weapons used for preaching!</span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">No wonder the vedas, praise those who carry swords, quiver sharp weapons and bows!</span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">“Food to the bold, the prudent and the mild. <strong style="font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:red;">Homage to him who carries sword and quiver</span></span>. <span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:red;">Homage to him who hath sharp weapons</span>, and is equipped with brave warriors. <span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:red;">Food to him who possesses good weapons and good bows</span>.</strong>” – [Yajurveda, Ch. 16, Verse 36, pg. 172. Tr. Devi Chand]</span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">People carrying harmful and deadly weapons are praised by vedas! And now we know why! We think it is crystal clear that vedas instruct Hindū kings, and Hindūs to dominate the world, subdue other civilizations and religions on it and control everything on it, so as to open the door for Vedic dharma and spread it and preach it with sword.</span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">We’ve seen protestant Hindūs spewing venom against Islam alleging that it was spread through swords whereas their own “Holy” books instruct them to do so. So what is such behaviour called? Well this has been apparent throught out the article and we’ve asked this question again and again so that our readers may see the extent of, these Islāmopobes in unethicalness. Well, such behaviour is called “double standards” or “hypocrisy”.</span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;">Jesus Christ (peace be upon him) Aptly said</p>
<blockquote style="font-weight:bold;color:#000000;">
<p style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">“Judge not, that you be not judged. For with the judgment you pronounce you will be judged, and with the measure you use it will be measured to you. Why do you see the speck that is in your brother’s eye, but do not notice the log that is in your own eye? “</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Written by Ibn Muhammad</p>
<p>Islam is being severely attacked, bashed, mocked by a certain dedicated team in cyberspace. A large number of these ‘Islam Haters’ happen to be Hindu fanatics. Obviously, their sole agenda is to create aversion in the minds of common people against Islam. Their full time job is to prove that the Islam promotes violence and terrorism. Some of these people are zealous evangelists of Vedas and claim that Vedas are the only books promoting peace. They claim that once everyone accepts the Vedas, peace and prosperity would been seen everywhere. How true is this claim? For those of you who have been conditioned to believe that Vedas promote peace, this article might change your perception of the Vedic Dharma.</p>
<p>According to Hindus, in Satyug, people were pious and upright, who did not know fighting. The use of lethal weapons was unknown. It was like Heaven on Earth. Hindus also tell us that Vedas are from the beginning of the world. Combining these two beliefs, it follows that Vedas must have nothing corcerning warfare, killing, plunder, etc. However, if Vedas do speak about warfare and killing, there are two only two choices for Hindus; accept that Vedas are not from the beginning of the world, but were written much later or accept that Vedas introduced killing and warfare in the world.</p>
<p><span id="more-850"></span></p>
<p><strong>The Warrior Gods of Vedas</strong></p>
<p>The Vedic gods are always depicted as being busy in war and destroying the enemies. Let us see god Indra</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="651" height="290" class="wp-image-7337" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-i1-wp-com-www-islamhinduism-com-images-sto.gif" alt="https://i1.wp.com/www.islamhinduism.com/images/stories/rig_10_48_6to7.gif" /></p>
<p><strong>“These, breathing loud in fury, two and two, who caused Indra to bring his bolt of thunder to the fray, The challengers, I struck with deadly weapon down: firm stand what words the God speaks to his worshippers. This One by stronger might I conquered singly; yea, also two: shall three prevail against me? Like many sheaves upon the floor I thrash them. How can my foes, the Indraless, revile me?” [Rigveda 10:48:6-7]</strong></p>
<p>Indra Ji cannot tolerate anyone opposing him and whoever is guilty of opposing him will be crushed like sawdust.</p>
<p>Indra Ji was invoked by the Aryans to loot the cows of non Aryan tribes and Indra Ji did not disappoint the Aryans. In Vedic times, there lived an untouchable people in a village named Kikat, in todays Bihar. The used to rear cattle. Obviously to the Aryans this was a crime. So they invoked their god Indra to wage war against them and loot their cows.</p>
<p><strong>“O Indra, what do the cows make for you among the Kikatas. They neither yield milk for your offerings, nor do they warm the vessel of libation. Bring to us these cows, bring to us also the wealth of Pramagand (their King). O Brave one, grant us the possessions of the people of low status.” [Rigveda 3:53:14]</strong></p>
<p>On the basis of this clear pronouncement, non-Aryans and untouchables have no right to keep cows. Aryans and Brahmins whenever they wish can kill them and appropriate their possessions. Hindu culture thus becomes the culture of the progress, civilization and welfare of the Aryan people alone.</p>
<p>Indra Ji is very ruthless against his opponents. He can go to any extent to ruin them, even kidnapping women. Rigveda 5:30:7-9 mentions the following</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="671" height="405" class="wp-image-7338" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-i0-wp-com-www-islamhinduism-com-images-sto.gif" alt="https://i0.wp.com/www.islamhinduism.com/images/stories/rig_5_30_8.gif" /></p>
<p><strong>7 Thou, Maghavan, from the first didst scatter foemen, speeding, while joying in the milk, the Giver. There, seeking man’s prosperity, thou torest away the head of Namuci the Dasa.</strong></p>
<p><strong>8 Pounding the head of Namuci the Dasa, me, too thou madest thine associate, Indra! Yea, and the rolling stone that is in heaven both worlds, as on a car, brought to the Maruts.</strong></p>
<p><strong>9 Women for weapons hath the Dasa taken, What injury can his feeble armies To me? Well he distinguished his two different voices, and Indra then advanced to fight the Dasyu.</strong></p>
<p>Indra Ji is given many epithets like <em>Vajradhaari, vṛtrahan, Dasyuhan, </em>etc. How can peace prevail in the world when these kinds of prejudiced teachings are there in the Vedas?</p>
<p>Vedic wars were mainly fought to gain cattle and other booty, as is clearly mentioned in Rigveda 6:26:1-2</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="643" height="280" class="wp-image-7339" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-i0-wp-com-www-islamhinduism-com-images-sto-1.gif" alt="https://i0.wp.com/www.islamhinduism.com/images/stories/rig_6_26_1.gif" /></p>
<p><strong>1. O INDRA, hear us. Raining down the Soma, we call on thee to win us mighty valour. Give us strong succour on the day of trial, when the tribes gather on the field of battle.</strong></p>
<p><strong>2 The warrior, son of warrior sire, invokes thee, to gain great strength that may be won as booty: To thee, the brave man’s Lord, the fiends’ subduer, he looks when fighting hand to hand for cattle.</strong></p>
<p>Like Indra, other deities are also of a warrior mentality. Again and again prayers are made to them to obtain the wealth of the enemies and conquer their territories.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Inhumane Principles of Vedic Warfare with special reference to Arya Samaj</strong></p>
<p>Now see the extreme sadist mentality of Vedic followers, who fought wars to gain cows and wealth. Their are specific prayers in the Vedas about conquering the foes and gaining their wealth. The conquered people were later humiliated in the most abusive ways. For example, Rigveda 10:166 says,</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="649" height="629" class="wp-image-7340" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-i1-wp-com-www-islamhinduism-com-images-sto-1.gif" alt="https://i1.wp.com/www.islamhinduism.com/images/stories/rig_10_166.gif" /></p>
<p><strong>“1. MAKE me a bull among my peers, make me my rivals, conqueror: Make me the slayer of my foes, a sovran ruler, lord of kine</strong></p>
<p><strong>2 I am my rivals’ slayer, like Indra unwounded and unhurt, And all these enemies of mine are vanquished and beneath my feet.</strong></p>
<p><strong>3 Here, verily, I bind you fast, as the two bow-ends with the string. Press down these men, O Lord of Speech, that they may humbly speak to me.</strong></p>
<p><strong>4 Hither I came as conqueror with mighty all-effecting power, And I have mastered all your thought, your synod, and your holy work.</strong></p>
<p><strong>5 May I be highest, having gained your strength in war, your skill in peace my feet have trodden on your heads. Speak to me from beneath my feet, as frogs from out the water croak, as frogs from out the water croak.”</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>BURN THE ENEMIES ALIVE<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Yajurveda Chapter 13; Mantra 12 says</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="523" height="273" class="wp-image-7341" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-i2-wp-com-www-islamhinduism-com-images-sto.gif" alt="https://i2.wp.com/www.islamhinduism.com/images/stories/yajur_13_12.gif" /></p>
<p><strong>“O King, make progress in thy duty of administration, extend happiness to the religious. O terrible chastiser, burn down the irreligious foes. O splendid person, humiliate and consume utterly like dried up stubble, him, who encourages our foe.”</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>BURN THE KITCHENS/KITCHEN GARDENS OF THE ENEMIES<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Yajurveda Chapter 13; Mantra 13 says</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="516" height="325" class="wp-image-7342" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-i1-wp-com-www-islamhinduism-com-images-sto-2.gif" alt="https://i1.wp.com/www.islamhinduism.com/images/stories/yajur_13_13.gif" /></p>
<p><strong>“O King, rise high, punish the wicked foes righteously, manifest the objects prepared by our steady scholars, enhance pleasures. Destroy the kitchens and other places of plundering of the vigorous enemies. Kill the foes. I settle you with fire’s ardour.”</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>PUT YOUR ENEMIES IN THE JAWS OF FEROCIOUS ANIMALS<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Yajurveda Chapter 15; Mantra 15 says</p>
<p><strong>“…Let injurious animals like Lions and others that eat fresh and grass be destroyed.  Let murderous crowds of men that destroy others like a powerful weapon, be killed.  Let virtuous rulers protect us from those animals, and make us comfortable.  In the jaws of these animals we place the ferocious man whom we hate and who hates us.“</strong></p>
<p>I am sure that our society will not allow Vedic followers to kill the Lions. A person who has common sense, will never accept this unscientific teaching.  Lions by nature, eat flesh.  This verse wants to make them herbivorous. If this teaching is implemented, Lions will become extinct.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>WHO ARE THE ENEMIES?<br />
</strong></p>
<p>But there is still one thing unclear. Who are the enemies whose inhumane killing is being encouraged in the above mantras? Well, let the Vedas answer for themselves.</p>
<p>Atharvaved 12:5:62 says,</p>
<p><strong>“Rend, rend to bits, rend through and through, scorch and consume and burn to dust, the one who rejects the Vedas.”</strong></p>
<p>I do not think the above verse leaves any ambiguity as to who the enemies mentioned in the Vedas are. The mantra speaks for itself. It also prescribes the most gruesome forms of slaughter of those who disbelieve in the Vedas.</p>
<p>The same Sookt (hymn) also commands the following in mantras 65-71,</p>
<p><strong>65) So, O Goddess, do thou from him, the Brāhmans’ tyrant,  criminal, niggard, blasphemer of the Gods,  66) With hundred-knotted thunderbolt, sharpened and edged with razor-blades, 67)Strike off the shoulders and the head. 68) Snatch thou the hair from off his head, and from his body strip the skin: 69) Tear out his sinews, cause his flesh to fall in pieces from his frame. 70) Crush thou his bones together, strike and beat the marrow out of him. 71) Dislocate all his limbs and joints.</strong></p>
<p>I wonder what type of mindset would have written this horrendous stuff? This extreme sadist mentality which relishes in instructing such horrible torture deserves to be banned forever before it is put to practice.  One can imagine what would have happened at the time when such teachings would have been enforced thousands of years back. These teachings were recently put into effect when innocent Muslims were burnt alive and tortured in the Indian State of Gujrat, Christians were burnt alive in many places of India especially in Orrisa. Jains and Buddhists in ancient times and Muslims, Christians and Sikhs in recent times have been made the experimental mice of these teachings.</p>
<p>Also supportig the idea that the enemies mentioned in the Vedas in fact refer to people of other religions, we have the following prayer made in Atharvaved 20:93:1.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="537" height="255" class="wp-image-7343" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-i1-wp-com-www-islamhinduism-com-images-sto-3.gif" alt="https://i1.wp.com/www.islamhinduism.com/images/stories/atharva_20_93_1.gif" /></p>
<p><strong>May our hymns give you great delight. Display your bounty, Thunderer. Drive off the enemies of the Vedas.”</strong></p>
<p>The next mantra mentions</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="477" height="216" class="wp-image-7344" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-i2-wp-com-www-islamhinduism-com-images-sto-1.gif" alt="https://i2.wp.com/www.islamhinduism.com/images/stories/atharva_20_93_2.gif" /></p>
<p><strong>“Crush with your foot the niggard churls who bring no gifts. Mighty are you: There is not one to equal you.”</strong></p>
<p>The above mantras also make the identity of the enemy clear. The enemies are those who do not pray to the Vedic gods and bring them no gifts. The same is mentioned in Rigveda 8:53:1-2.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>PLUNDER THE ENEMIES WEALTH<br />
</strong></p>
<p>As has been said before that Vedic wars were motivated to a great extent by capturing more wealth, I will now provide even more evidence for this.</p>
<p><strong>“Handless be these our enemies! We enervate their languid limbs. So let us part among ourselves, in hundreds, Indra! all their wealth.” [Atharvaved 6:66:3]</strong></p>
<p>Rigveda 1:7:4 mentions,</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="473" height="298" class="wp-image-7345" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-i2-wp-com-www-islamhinduism-com-images-sto-2.gif" alt="https://i2.wp.com/www.islamhinduism.com/images/stories/rig_1_7_4.gif" /></p>
<p><strong>“Help us, O Indra, in the frays, yea, frays, where thousand spoils are gained, With awful aids, O awful One.”</strong></p>
<p>In Rigveda 10:84:2 it is said,</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="475" height="315" class="wp-image-7346" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-i2-wp-com-www-islamhinduism-com-images-sto-3.gif" alt="https://i2.wp.com/www.islamhinduism.com/images/stories/rig_10_84_2.gif" /></p>
<p><strong>Flashing like fire, be thou, O conquering Manyu, invoked, O Victor, as our army’s leader. Slay thou our foes, distribute their possessions: show forth thy vigour, scatter those who hate us.</strong></p>
<p>At many places such prayers are made to destroy the enemies and gain their wealth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>BOOTY OF WAR<br />
</strong></p>
<p>What constitutes the booty of war in the Vedic religion? Maharishi Manu describes the war booty on the basis of the Vedas.</p>
<p><strong>“Chariots and horses, elephants, parasols, money, grain, cattle, women, all sorts of (marketable) goods and valueless metals belong to him who takes them (singly) conquering (the possessor).”</strong></p>
<p><strong>“A text of the Veda (declares) that (the soldiers) shall present a choice portion (of this booty) to the king; what has not been taken singly, must be distributed by the king among all the soldiers.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Manu Smriti 7:96-97]</strong></p>
<p>Women also are considered part of the war booty in the above passages and are to be divided like other objects.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>No Universal Brotherhood in the Vedas<br />
</strong></p>
<p>The texts of the Vedas and other Hindu scriptures clearly show that they do not regard non-Aryans races as brothers, nor did they wish any good to the non-worshippers of the Aryan gods. They only wished their extirpation and their annihilation. Out of a large number of passages bearing on this subject, I quote the following:</p>
<p><strong>“He who dwells fixed in the atmosphere, smiting the blasphemers of the god that do not sacrifice, to him be reverence with ten sakvarî-stanzas!” [Atharvaved 11:2:23]</strong></p>
<p>The texts of the Vedas seem to leave no doubt that they recognize a distinction between the tribe to which the authors of the hymns belonged and a hostile people who observed different rites, and were regarded with contempt and hatred by the superior race. Their is no doubt that in many passages of the Rigveda the words <em>Dasa </em>and <em>Dasyu</em> are applied to the aboriginal tribes of India. Let us see what Maharishi Manu says,</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="372" height="59" class="wp-image-7347" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-i2-wp-com-www-islamhinduism-com-images-sto-4.gif" alt="https://i2.wp.com/www.islamhinduism.com/images/stories/manu_10_45.gif" /></p>
<p><strong>“All those tribes in this world, which are excluded from (the community of) those born from the mouth, the arms, the thighs, and the feet (of Brahman), are called Dasyus, whether they speak the language of the Mlecchas or that of the Aryans. [Manu 10:45]</strong></p>
<p>The distinction between Aryas and Dasyus is not on the basis of character but on the basis nationality as is clearly demarcated by Manu Smriti 2:21-23.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="363" height="175" class="wp-image-7348" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-i1-wp-com-www-islamhinduism-com-images-sto-4.gif" alt="https://i1.wp.com/www.islamhinduism.com/images/stories/manu_2_21-23.gif" /></p>
<p><strong>“21. That (country) which (lies) between the Himavat and the Vindhya (mountains) to the east of Prayaga and to the west of Vinasana (the place where the river Sarasvati disappears) is called Madhyadesa (the central region).</strong></p>
<p><strong>22. But (the tract) between those two mountains (just mentioned), which (extends) as far as the eastern and the western oceans, the wise call Aryavarta (the country of the Aryans).</strong></p>
<p><strong>23. That land where the black antelope naturally roams, one must know to be fit for the performance of sacrifices; (the tract) different from that (is) the country of the Mlecchas (barbarians).”</strong></p>
<p>Only Aryavarta aka India is the place where noble people are found and the rest of the world is filled with evil people. Thus as per the Vedic worldview, Aryas as called Aryas (Noble) because they belong to the Aryavarta and Mlecchas and Dasyus are called so not because they are evil but because they are foreigners.</p>
<p>So, Vedas give the following solution to deal with the Dasyus who do not share the faith of the Aryas.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="619" height="113" class="wp-image-7349" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-i2-wp-com-www-islamhinduism-com-images-sto-5.gif" alt="https://i2.wp.com/www.islamhinduism.com/images/stories/rig_1_176_4.gif" /></p>
<p><strong>“Slay everyone who pours no gift, who, hard to reach, delights thee not. Bestow on us what wealth he hath: this even the worshipper awaits.” [Rigveda 1:176:4]</strong></p>
<p>What language could be stronger against one’s enemies than this?  This is sheer bigotry. The quotations already made sufficiently illustrate the hatred of the Aryans for the other religions. For more of this bigotry you can see Rigveda 8:2:18, 8:45:23, 8:51:12, 8:53:1,2.</p>
<p>As far as we have seen, there is no trace to be found in the hymns of the Vedas about the brotherhood of man.  On the other hand, there is abundant evidence of an intense hostility cherished towards the non Aryan tribes.</p>
<p>There was also not the very best of feelings even among the Rishis towards one another. There are unmistakable references in the hymns to a deadly feud between Rishi Vashishtha and Rishi Vishvamitra and of a curse laid on the former by the latter. The details of these feuds will be dealt with in another article.</p>
<p>This article is an attempt to refute the Vedic propagandists who are so eager to malign Islam and yet choose to turn a blind eye to their own scriptures. I can only remind them of this wise saying of Jesus Christ (peace be upon him),</p>

<span style="color:#0070c0;">Which is more deplorable: destruction of Buddhism in its own birth place in ancient India by Hindus, or of Buddha statues by present day Islamic Talibans in Afghanistan?<br />
</span><br />
<span id="more-5643"></span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Two well known academicians of Kerala &#8211; Prof KM Bahauddin, former pro-vice chancellor of Aligarh Muslim and Osmania universities, and Dr MS Jayaprakash, professor of history at Kollam &#8211; throw some deep insights into the dark history of India when Buddhism was systematically eliminated by Brahminical forces who control Hinduism, then and now.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Says Jayaprakash: &#8216;The ruthless demolition of Buddha statues by Taliban has courted severe criticism from different quarters of the world. Surprisingly, the BJP-led Indian Government, supported by all Hindutva forces, also condemned the Taliban action. It is a paradox that the forerunners of the present Hindutva forces in India had wantonly destroyed not only Buddhist statues but also killed Buddhists in India. Therefore, any impartial student of history would unequivocally say that these Hindutva forces have no moral right to criticize Taliban now.&#8217;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
He elaborates: &#8216;Hundreds of Buddhist statues, stupas and viharas have been destroyed in India between 830 and 966 AD in the name of Hindu revivalism. Both literary and archaeological sources within and outside India speak volumes about the havoc done to Buddhism by Hindu fanatics. Spiritual leaders like Sankaracharya and many Hindu kings and rulers took pride in demolishing Buddhist images aiming at the total eradication of Buddhist culture. Today, their descendants destroyed the Babri Masjid and also published the list of mosques to be targeted in future. It is with this sin of pride that they presently condemn Taliban.&#8217;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Prof. Bahauddin elaborates the selfish compulsions of Brahminism to wipe-out Buddhism: &#8216;Buddhism tried to create a dynamic society in ancient India. Jainism also contributed its share. As Buddhism spread, iron ploughs and implement were used for development of agriculture. As a result, new areas were cultivated and agricultural productivity increased, apart from developing trade centres and road links. Subsistence-level economy changed to a surplus economy with grain storage facilities, exchange of goods, trade and development of bureaucratic administration. This also created social change &#8211; from elans consisting several families to tribes consisting several elans of similar socio-economic conditions. The emphasis of Brahmins, on the other hand, was for receiving and giving alms and not on production of goods. Those who give and receive alms were close to Gods and those who produce were considered as inferior. According to Manusmriti, a Sudra should not have wealth of his own. In case he has any, a Brahmin as his master can take it over without any hesitation. &#8216;Rigveda&#8217; goes a step further to kill those who do not give &#8216;danam&#8217; to the Brahmins. In other words, someone has to produce goods so that others can give &#8216;danam&#8217; to the recipient Brahmins. It was against this system of &#8216;downgrading those who produce&#8217; that Buddhism came into being.&#8217;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Recalls Dr. Jayaprakash: &#8216;The Hindu ruler Pushyamitra Sunga had destroyed 84,000 Buddhist stupas which were built by Emperor Ashoka. This was followed by the demolition of Buddhist centres in Magadha. Thousands of Buddhist saints were killed mercilessly. King Jalaluka destroyed the Buddha viharas within his jurisdiction on the ground that chanting of hymns by Buddhists disturbed his sleep! In Kashmir, King Kinnara demolished thousands of viharas and captured the Buddhist villages to please Brahmins. A large number of Buddha viharas were usurped by Brahmins and converted into Hindu temples where entry of &#8216;untouchables&#8217; was prohibited. Notably, Buddhist places were regularized as Hindu temples by writing Puranas, which were invented myths or pseudo history. The important temples at Tirupathi, Aihole, Undavalli, Ellora, Bengal, Puri, Badarinath, Mathura, Ayodhya, Sringeri, Bodhigaya, Saranath, Delhi, Nalanda, Gudimallam, Nagarjunakonda, Srisailam and Sabarimala are some of the striking examples of Brahminical usurpation of Buddhist centres.&#8217;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Detailing the divergence in both orientation and essence between Buddhism and Hinduism, Prof. Bahauddin says: &#8216;Equality, compassion, non-violence, utilization of human abilities for general welfare, etc. were the cardinal principles of Buddhism. According to &#8216;Sathpatha Brahmanam (22-6, 3-4-14), on the other hand, the whole universe is controlled by God, God is controlled by Mantram and Mantram is with Brahmins and, therefore, Brahmins are God (on earth). They used Mantram and Sapam to instil fear in the people to obey them, while Buddhism encouraged people to observe visible facts, to apply reason to get out of fear. Buddhism also encouraged people to do good things, besides guiding Kings to look after the people&#8217;s welfare. Buddhism considers the general welfare of the people, while Brahminism considers that the whole world was created for them all along. And, there is bound to be conflict between these two opposite ways of thinking.&#8217;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
According to Dr Jayaprakash, Sakaracharya had played &#8216;a demon&#8217;s role&#8217; in destruction of Buddhist statues and monuments at Nagarjunakonda (in present-day Andhra Pradesh). &#8216;A. N. Longhurst, who conducted excavations at Nagarjunakonda, had recorded this in his invaluable book, Memoirs of the Archaeological Survey of India No. 54, The Buddhist Antiquities of Nagarjunakonda (Delhi, 1938, p. 6). The ruthless manner in which all the buildings at Nagarjunakonda have been destroyed is simply appalling and cannot represent the work of treasure-seekers alone since so many pillars, statues, and sculptures have been wantonly smashed to pieces. Local tradition relates that the great Hindu philosopher and teacher, Sankaracharya, came to Nagarjunakonda with a host of followers and destroyed the Buddhist monuments. The cultivated lands on which ruined buildings stand represent a religious grant made to Sankaracharya.&#8217;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Quoting Dr. B. R. Ambedkar, Prof. Bahauddin says that the conflict against Brahmin supremacy had, in fact, started before Buddhist period, between Vasishta Muni, a Brahmin, and Viswamitra, a non-Brahmin. &#8216;The dispute was about the learning of &#8216;Vedas&#8217;, the right to conduct religious ceremony, to receive gifts, and to perform coronation of King. Vasishta Muni insisted that these were the exclusive privileges of Brahmins, while Viswamitra was opposed to such exclusive rights. This dispute lasted for long period, and even Kings joined in it (Writings and Speeches of Dr. Ambedkar, vol. 7, p. 148-155. It was won by Brahmins.&#8217;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Prof. Bahauddin lists the different stages of Brahmin hostility against Buddhism: &#8216;1) 483-273 BC: The period after Buddha&#8217;s death upto Ashoka&#8217;s rule when attempts were made to include Brahminical ideas in Buddhist ideology. 2) 273-200 BC: When Buddhism spread all over India and became a world religion. 3) 200 BC-500 AD: The period when all possible efforts were made to disintegrate Buddhism from within by adulterating Buddhist teachings with Brahminical ideas and also through physical annihilation from outside. As a result, Buddhism divided itself into 18 sects, of which Hinayana and Mahayana were prominent ones. 4) 500-700 AD: Brahminism gained supremacy in North India and efforts began to drive out Buddhism and Jainism from South India. 5) 700-1100 AD: Brahminism gained supremacy in South India and, with added vigour, it moved again to North India to obtain complete supremacy over Buddhism and Jainism. 6) 1100-1400 AD: Buddhism and Jainism were destroyed from the remaining Southern States of Karnataka and Kerala and, thus, total supremacy of Brahminism all over India was achieved.&#8217;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Adds Dr. Jayaprakash: &#8216;Within Kerala, Sankaracharya and his close associate Kumarila Bhatta, an avowed foe of Buddhism, organized a religious crusade against Buddhists. A vivid description of Sankaracharya&#8217;s pleasure of seeing people of non-Brahminic faith being burnt to death is available in &#8216;Sankara Digvijaya&#8217;. Kumarila instigated King Suddhanvan of Ujjain to exterminate Buddhists. The &#8216;Mricchakatika&#8217; of Sudraka describes how the King&#8217;s brother-in-law in Ujjain inhumanly tortured the Buddhist monks, by using them as bullocks by inserting a string through their nose and yoking them to the cart! The &#8216;Keralolpathi&#8217; documents the extermination of Buddhism from Kerala by Kumarila. About the activities of Sankaracharya, even Vivekananda had observed: &#8216;And, such was the heart of Sankara that he burnt to death lots of Buddhist monks by defeating them in argument. What can you call such action on Sankara&#8217;s part except fanaticism&#8217; (Complete works of Swami Vivekananda, Vol. III, p. 118, Calcutta, 1997).&#8217;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
According to Dr. Jayaprakash, there are hundreds of places in Kerala having names &#8216;palli&#8217; either affixed or suffixed with them. &#8216;Karunagapalli, Karthikapalli, Pallickal, Pallippuram, Edappally, etc. are some examples of these places. The term &#8216;palli&#8217; means a Buddha vihara. Notably, Kerala had 1200 years of Buddhist tradition. Earlier, the schools in Malayalam were called as &#8216;Ezhuthupalli&#8217; or &#8216;Pallikoodam&#8217;. It is also worth noticing that the Christians and Muslims in Kerala use the term &#8216;palli&#8217; to denote their church and mosque alike. These &#8216;pallies&#8217; or viharas had been ruthlessly demolished by the Hindu forces under the leadership of Sankaracharya and Kumarila. They could exterminate 1200 years of Buddhist tradition and converted Kerala into a Brahminical state based on the &#8216;Chaturvarna&#8217; system. Original inhabitants of Kerala, like the Ezhavas, Pulayas, etc., were crushed under the weight of casteism. Many a viharas was transformed into temples and majority of people were prevented from entering temples under the pretext of caste pollution. It can also be noted that the name &#8216;Kerala&#8217; is the Sanskritised Aryan version of the Dravidian and Buddhist term &#8216;Cherala&#8217;. The Parasurama legend is nothing but an invented myth for regularizing the Brahminical &#8216;Kerala&#8217; hiding its glorious Buddhist traditions.&#8217;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Jainism, too, met with the same fate in South India. Prof. Bahauddin elaborates: &#8216;Very little information is available about growth of Jainism in South India during 300-400 AD. The Jain book, &#8216;Digambara Darsana&#8217;, recounts the starting of a Sangham at Madurai in 470 AD and Jainism became widespread and strong during 500-600 AD (Kumaraswamy Iyengar, &#8216;Studies in South Indian Jainism&#8217;, p. 51-58)….. The Jains used to instal the images of their saints in their religious places, a practice which was followed by Brahmins. Hindu temples appeared all over Tamilnadu probably after converting the Jain religious places. The idols of 63 Brahmin Sanyasis, who led destruction of Jainism, still adorn the walls of some Hindu temples in Tamilnadu. The remains of destroyed Jain idols, their abandoned religious and living places are scattered all over Tamilnadu to narrate their story. Frescos depicting the kings of Jains could be seen on the walls near the Golden Tank at Madurai Meenakshi Temple where, of the total 12 annual festivals, five depict the killing of Jains according to Kumaraswamy Iyengar (p. 78-79).&#8217;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
According to Dr. Jayaprakash, a number of Buddha statues have been discovered at places like Ambalapuzha, Karunagapalli, Pallickal, Bharanikkavu, Mavelikara and Neelamperur in Kerala. &#8216;They are either in the form of smashed pieces or thrown away from viharas. Lord Ayyappa of Sabarimala and Lord Padmanabha at Thiruvananthapuram are the proxy images of Buddha being worshipped as Vishnu. Hundreds of Buddhists were killed on the banks of Aluva river. The term &#8216;Aluva&#8217; was derived from &#8216;Alawai&#8217; which means &#8216;Trisul&#8217;, a weapon used by Hindu fanatics to stab Buddhists. Similarly, on the banks of the Vaigai river in Tamilnadu, thousands of Buddhists were killed by the Vaishnava Saint, Sambanthar. Thevaram, a Tamil book, documents this brutal extermination of Buddhism.&#8217;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Prof. Bahauddin recalls the strong reasons to believe that a large section of Jains had embraced Islam: &#8216;The spread of Islam in Tamilnadu can be considered in three or four stages. Islam spread in Kerala and Tamilnadu when Jainism was under pressure (650-750 AD). The new religion was received without resistance…. Since Islam considers every human being with equality Jainism and Buddhism had no conflict with it. When Muhammad ibn Al-Qasim attacked Sindh, the Buddhists supported him because they were facing annihilation at that time. A similar situation was prevailing in South India during 650-750 AD…. Muslims in Tamilnadu are called Anchuvanthar, Labba (teacher), Rauthar, Marakar (sailor) or Jonakan (Yavankan). The Anchuvanam is the guild of traders and groups of artisans. The Muslim mohallas of &#8216;Anchuvan Vamsagar&#8217;, &#8216;Anchuvanathar&#8217;, etc. are scattered all over Tamilnadu and seem to be the en bloc conversion of Jain guilds engaged in different activities, especially weaving. Those who ran away from Tamilnadu settled down in Sravanabalagola and Gomatheswaram in Karnataka. And, those who could not leave due to their economic interests converted to Islam. If we analyze the body structure, food, language, dress, ornaments, customs and habits of Anchuvanthar, it could be see that those are a continuation of Jain way of living and customs.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Till recently, the weavers in such Muslim mohallas will not eat at noon or night, and take only one meal before dusk. This was a continuation of Jain habits. There is a separate place in such villages called &#8216;Odukkam&#8217; where Jain Munist used to sit in prayer. On the last Wednesday of the month called &#8216;Odukkathae&#8217; Wednesday, the Muslims gather together to sing religious songs, which is also a Jain tradition. When religious functions like Maulood, Rathif, etc. are organized in the house, a white cloth with lotus symbol on it called &#8216;Mekett&#8217; is tied, which resembles the &#8216;Asmanagiri&#8217; of the Jains…. The architecture of Muslim stone mosques are completely of Jain architecture. The pillars of earlier mosques have practically no difference with the Jain temple pillars. The close relationship between traders and weavers had probably cemented by conversion to Islam. During 950-1200 AD, there were large number of Sufis, Fakirs, wandering poets, singing minstrels, etc. among Muslims all over Tamilnadu. Nadirshah with 500 disciples settled down in &#8216;Trichinopoly&#8217; during 1000 AD. Aliyar Shah and his disciples made Madurai as their centre. Baba Fakhruddin travelled all over Tamilnadu. Nagur became another Sufi centre. The Muslim religious literature of Tamilnadu of that period was least different from those created by Jains and Hindus during the &#8216;Bhakti&#8217; movement.&#8217;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Prof. Bahauddin recounts the spread of Jainism and Buddhism in Kerala, thus: &#8216;Jainism spread in North Kerala around 200 BC. The Jain architectural remains in Canara and Malabar are not available anywhere else in South of Nepal. While Jainism entered North Kerala via Mangalore, Salem, Coimbatore and Wayanad, it entered Southern Kerala from Tirunelveli, Kanyakumari, Nagercoil, Chitharal, etc. The hill near Anamala, which was an important Jain centre, is still called &#8216;Jain Durgam&#8217;. The close-by Kurumala was also a Jain centre. From Anamala through Munnar, Devikulam, Kothamangalam, Perumbavoor, etc. they reached Neryamangalam, Kothamangalam, Perumbavoor and other places. The &#8216;Kallil Kshetram&#8217; in Perumbavoor is an important Jain monument as also the &#8216;Jainmedu&#8217; in Vadakethara village of Palakkad district. Kerala&#8217;s cave temples at Chitharal, Kallil, Trikur, Erunilamkode (Thrissur district) and Thiruveghapuram (Palakkad district) were constructed during the period of Jain King Mahendra Verman-I (610-640 AD). Temple records of Rameswaram, Sucheendram, Poothadi (Wayanad), Keenalur (Kozhicode) , etc. show that they were part of &#8216;Kunavai Koottam&#8217; during 10-11th centuries. &#8216;Koottam&#8217; is the place of living for Jain Sanyasis. Temple records show that all these present-day Hindu temples were Jain religious places till 11th century. Place names with Kallu, Poothan, Aathan, Kotha, Palli, Ambalam, etc. were all Jain centres. Spread all over Kerala, names of these places show that Buddhism and Jainism were widespread. The famous Kalpathi in Palakkad district was a Buddhist-Jain centre. The &#8216;Ratholsavam&#8217; there is akin to the &#8216;Kettukazhcha&#8217; of Buddhists. The present Bhagavati temples were also Jain temples. The group, &#8216;Adikal&#8217;, had a prominent position among Jains who became &#8216;Pisharadi&#8217; after absorption of Jainism in Hinduism.&#8217;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&#8216;Similarly, the Buddhist stoopa at Kodungallore, located in Methala village South-East of Thrikanamathilakam, is an important Buddhist ruin in Kerala…. Mahismathi was the capital of Chera King Satyaputran, which shows the relationship of Chera country (Kerala) with Buddhism. There is a reference in &#8216;Manimekhala&#8217; about a Buddhist Chaityam in Kerala. While Vadakkumnatha Temple at Thrissur and Kurumba Temple at Kodungallore were Buddhist temples, Buddha statues were discovered from Kollam, Alappuzha, Mavelikara, Pallikkal, Karumadi and other places…. Treating mental patients in Thiruvadi temple and leprosy patients in Thakazhi temple shows that they were Buddhist temples since these kind of humanitarian services were not rendered out from Hindu temples…. By 900 AD Buddhism and Jainism were almost wiped out from Tamilnadu. The second settlement wave of Brahmins in Kerala during 900 AD was with Pandyan Kings&#8217; support. Karnataka and Kerala were the only two states where Buddhism and Jainism were still surviving and the second immigration of Brahmins might have been for driving out these two religions from the remaining places.&#8217;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Prof. Bahauddin recalls: &#8216;Very few people know that Buddhism and Jainism were the prominent religions of Kerala till 1200 AD. I was also under the impression that Hinduism was in Kerala from the very beginning. When facts were pieced together, a different picture emerged. Only from the end of 1800 AD the evidence became available about Buddha, Buddhism, Ashoka, etc. That fact itself is a pathetic story….&#8217;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Adds Dr. Jayaprakash in conclusion: &#8216;This is what really happened in India, the land of Buddha. But our so-called eminent historians, except a few, are bent upon eclipsing the cruelty done to Buddhists in India. These pseudo historians have succeeded in creating an impression that India is a land of righteousness and toleration. The entire world has been duped by them. The deed on the part of Taliban can be justified on the ground that Islam does not permit idols. But one has to note that Islam does not allow the demolition of other people&#8217;s religious centres and images. Whatever may be the argument for and against Taliban action, the Hindu atrocities on Buddhism in India has no parallel in the entire world history of religious struggle. Let the world know the cruel and crooked face of the &#8216;Indian vulture without culture&#8217;!</p>

<h3></h3>
<h3>Intolerance towards Buddhists</h3>
<p>The Brahmanical hostility towards Buddhism was a major reason of the decline of Buddhism in India, the place of its birth. It is quite true that at a later date the Brahmins accepted Buddha as one of the avataras but it was just another srewd Brahmin way of showing contempt towards the Buddha. The Hindus never really showed any friendly attitude towards the followers of the religion of the Buddha, as it shown from various historical records. The Bramins first sowed the seeds of hatred towards the Buddhists in their scriptures to gain the sympatheis of the common people in slaughtering Buddhists.<br />
<span id="more-854"></span><br />
In the Ayodhya Kaanda of Valmiki Ramayana, a Buddhist was compared to a thief and the Tathagatas to atheists (Naastiks). It said:<br />
<b>यथा </b><b>हि </b><b>चोर </b><b>स्स </b><b>तथा </b><b>हि </b><b>बुद्ध-<br />
</b><b>स्तथागतं </b><b>नास्तिकमत्र </b><b>विद्धि।</b></p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p>As a thief, so is Buddha. Know that Tathagatas are atheists. [Sarga 109; shloka 34]</blockquote>
<p>The Yajnavalkya Smriti says that the very sight of a monk with red robes and shaven head (referring to Buddhists), even in a dream, is a bad sign. [Yajnavalkya SmritiI/272-273]
The Agni Purana[16/1-3] and Vishnu Purana[18/13-18] refer to Buddha as an embodiment of Grand Deception (māyamohasvarup) and that he deluded the people from the Vedic Religion.  His path is a sure ticket to hell.<br />
The great philosopher of Hinduism, Shankaracharya, said that the Buddha was suffering from what we know as schizophrenia. Shankaracharya said that</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p>“<strong>he (Buddha) was a man given to make incoherent assertions or else that hatred of all beings</strong> induced him to propound absurd doctrines by accepting which they would become thoroughly confused.–So that–and this the Sûtra means to indicate–Buddha’s doctrine has to be entirely disregarded by all those who have a regard for their own happiness.”<br />
[Shankar Bhashya on Brahmasutra 2/2/32]</blockquote>
<p>The writer of <em>Saankhyakaarika</em>, Vachaspati Mishra, uses the words <strong>‘Mleccha (filthy)’, Purushaapsad (low people) and PashuPraay (Animal like) </strong>for Buddhists, Jains, etc. He writes:<br />
<b>आप्तग्रहणेनाs</b><b>युक्ताः  </b><b>शाक्यभिक्षुर्नि </b><b>ग्रन्थकसंसारमो </b><b>चकादीनामागमाभासाः </b><b>परिहृता </b><b>भवन्ति . </b><b>अयुक्तत्वं </b><b>चैतेषां </b><b>विगानात्, </b><b>विच्छन्न </b><b>मूलत्वात्, </b><b>प्रमाणविरुद्धार्थाभिधानात् </b><b>कैशिचदेव </b><b>मलेच्छादिभिः </b><b>पुरुषापसदैः </b><b>पशुप्रायैः </b><b>परिग्रहाद् </b><b>बोद्धव्यम् .</b></p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p>“By saying ‘true revelation’, all pretended revelations such as those of Shaakya, Bhikshu (Buddha),etc have been set aside. The invalidity of these systems is due to their making unreasonable assertions, to want of sufficient basis, to their making statements contradictory to proofs, and lastly to their being accepted only by <strong>Mlecchas, or by mean men or by animal like people</strong>. “</p></blockquote>
<h3>Were Buddhists persecuted by Hindus? Yes, they were</h3>
<p>Buddhism suffered a great decline owing to the hostile activities of some philosphers of Brahminical thought and preachers of South India. Kumarila Bhatta was regarded as the fiercest critic of Buddhism. He was the strongest protagonist of Vedic ritualism. Kumarila is said to have been a Brahmin of Bihar who raged with the ardour to preach against Buddhism. The <em><strong>Shankar Digvijaya</strong></em>of Madhava (earliest authentic biography of Shankaracharya) refers to Malayali King Sudhanva’s brutal extermination of Buddhists at the instigation of Kumarila Bhatta.</p>
<h3>Intolerance towards Buddhists</h3>
<p>The Brahmanical hostility towards Buddhism was a major reason of the decline of Buddhism in India, the place of its birth. It is quite true that at a later date the Brahmins accepted Buddha as one of the avataras but it was just another srewd Brahmin way of showing contempt towards the Buddha. The Hindus never really showed any friendly attitude towards the followers of the religion of the Buddha, as it shown from various historical records. The Bramins first sowed the seeds of hatred towards the Buddhists in their scriptures to gain the sympatheis of the common people in slaughtering Buddhists.<br />
In the Ayodhya Kaanda of Valmiki Ramayana, a Buddhist was compared to a thief and the Tathagatas to atheists (Naastiks). It said:<br />
<b>यथा </b><b>हि </b><b>चोर </b><b>स्स </b><b>तथा </b><b>हि </b><b>बुद्ध-<br />
</b><b>स्तथागतं </b><b>नास्तिकमत्र </b><b>विद्धि।</b></p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p>As a thief, so is Buddha. Know that Tathagatas are atheists. [Sarga 109; shloka 34]</blockquote>
<p>The Yajnavalkya Smriti says that the very sight of a monk with red robes and shaven head (referring to Buddhists), even in a dream, is a bad sign. [Yajnavalkya SmritiI/272-273]
The Agni Purana[16/1-3] and Vishnu Purana[18/13-18] refer to Buddha as an embodiment of Grand Deception (māyamohasvarup) and that he deluded the people from the Vedic Religion.  His path is a sure ticket to hell.<br />
The great philosopher of Hinduism, Shankaracharya, said that the Buddha was suffering from what we know as schizophrenia. Shankaracharya said that</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p>“<strong>he (Buddha) was a man given to make incoherent assertions or else that hatred of all beings</strong> induced him to propound absurd doctrines by accepting which they would become thoroughly confused.–So that–and this the Sûtra means to indicate–Buddha’s doctrine has to be entirely disregarded by all those who have a regard for their own happiness.”<br />
[Shankar Bhashya on Brahmasutra 2/2/32]</blockquote>
<p>The writer of <em>Saankhyakaarika</em>, Vachaspati Mishra, uses the words <strong>‘Mleccha (filthy)’, Purushaapsad (low people) and PashuPraay (Animal like) </strong>for Buddhists, Jains, etc. He writes:<br />
<b>आप्तग्रहणेनाs</b><b>युक्ताः  </b><b>शाक्यभिक्षुर्नि </b><b>ग्रन्थकसंसारमो </b><b>चकादीनामागमाभासाः </b><b>परिहृता </b><b>भवन्ति . </b><b>अयुक्तत्वं </b><b>चैतेषां </b><b>विगानात्, </b><b>विच्छन्न </b><b>मूलत्वात्, </b><b>प्रमाणविरुद्धार्थाभिधानात् </b><b>कैशिचदेव </b><b>मलेच्छादिभिः </b><b>पुरुषापसदैः </b><b>पशुप्रायैः </b><b>परिग्रहाद् </b><b>बोद्धव्यम् .</b></p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p>“By saying ‘true revelation’, all pretended revelations such as those of Shaakya, Bhikshu (Buddha),etc have been set aside. The invalidity of these systems is due to their making unreasonable assertions, to want of sufficient basis, to their making statements contradictory to proofs, and lastly to their being accepted only by <strong>Mlecchas, or by mean men or by animal like people</strong>. “</p></blockquote>
<p>Kumarila is said to have been a Brahmin of Bihar who raged with the ardour to preach against Buddhism. The <em><strong>Shankar Digvijaya</strong></em>of Madhava (earliest authentic biography of Shankaracharya) refers to Malayali King Sudhanva’s brutal extermination of Buddhists at the instigation of Kumarila Bhatta.</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p>The king (Sudhanva) commanded his servants “kill all Buddhists from Himalaya to Rameshvaram, <strong>even children and elderly</strong>. Whosoever will not kill them, will be killed at my hands.” [93]
At the instigation of Kumarila Bhatta, the king killed the Buddhists, the opponents (of the Hindu religion) just like a Yogi destroys the disturbances. [95]
<strong>[Madhava-Vidyaranya, Sankara Digvijaya Sarg 1; shlokas 93-95]
</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>This was about Kumarila’s brutal persecution of Buddhists. Now let us turn to Adi Shankaracharya, the Brahmin of South India, who did  a great job of glorifying the <em>Vedas </em>and the <em>Advaita Vedanta</em> philosophy. He was vigorously anti-Buddhism. I have already quoted his remarks on Buddha, which show his ‘regard’ for the Buddhist religion (Refer Shankar Bhasya on Brahmasutra 2/2/32). With regards to the Sringeri matha built by Shankaracharya, Sir Charles Eliot in his book <em>Hinduism and Buddhism</em> (1921 Ed. Page 211) says,</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p>“There is some reason to suppose that the Matha of Sringeri was founded on the site of a Buddhist Monestary”</p></blockquote>
<p>The 15th Sarga of his biography <em>Madhava-Vidyaranya Sankara Digvijay </em>refers to his campaigns against the Buddhists, being escorted by King Sudhanvan’s army wherever he went from the Himalayas to the India Ocean. Owing to his anti Buddhist activities, Buddhism fell on its evil days.<br />
This royal persecution of Buddhists by some Brahminic rulers was the most potent factor which contributed to bring the decline of Buddhism in India. The <strong><em>Budaun Stone Inscription</em> </strong>of Lakhanapaala refers to one <strong>Varamasiva, a Saiva ascetic, </strong>who destroyed an idol of Buddha in the South (Dakshinapatha) before his arrival in Vodamayuta (<a style="color: #9f9f9f;" href="http://www.dli.ernet.in/cgi-bin/metainfo.cgi?&amp;title1=epigraphia%20indica%20vol.1&amp;author1=burgess,%20jas.&amp;subject1=tribes,%20india&amp;year=1892%20&amp;language1=english&amp;pages=540&amp;barcode=99999990010481&amp;author2=NULL&amp;identifier1=NULL&amp;publisher1=luzac&amp;contributor1=NULL&amp;vendor1=NONE&amp;scanningcentre1=ignca&amp;slocation1=NONE&amp;sourcelib1=central%20archaeological%20library,%20%20asi&amp;scannerno1=0&amp;digitalrepublisher1=NULL&amp;digitalpublicationdate1=0000-00-00&amp;numberedpages1=0&amp;unnumberedpages1=0&amp;rights1=OUT_OF_COPYRIGHT&amp;copyrightowner1=NULL&amp;copyrightexpirydate1=0000-00-00&amp;format1=tagged%20image%20file%20format%20&amp;url=/data6/upload/0144/640" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" data-wpel-link="external">Epigraphia Indica vol.1<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, Page 63)<br />
A <strong>Chalukya Inscription</strong> of 1184 A.D. refers to a feudatory chief,<strong> Mahaamandaleshvara Viruparasadeva</strong>, who is described as a’forest-fire to the Jain religion’, a ‘destroyer of the Buddha religion’, a ‘demolisher of Jain basadis’ and ‘establisher of the Sivalinga-Simhaasana (Shiva Linga Throne).He destroyed several <i>samayas </i>at Pariyalige, Anilevada (Anhilwad), Unukallu (Unkal), Sampagadi (Sampagaon), Ibbaluru (Ablur?), Marudige (Maradigi), Anampur (Alampur), KaTahada (Karad), Kembhavi, Bammakuru and other places.

Another fierce Hindu king who showed his great hostility towards Buddhism was <strong>Shashanka, the King of Gauda</strong>. He was a notable example of anti-Buddhist Brahminical fanaticism. He is said to have uprooted the sacred Bodhi-Tree at Bodh-Gaya but in order to destroy it totally, he burnt its remains. A Buddha image from a temple east of the Bodhi tree was removed by him and in its place, he installed an image of Siva.

This is corroborated by <em>The Life of Hiuen Tsiang by the Shaman Hwui Li</em> who mentions that a certain <strong>Kumaara-Raja</strong> threatened the monks of Nalanda with a behaviour similar to Shashanka, and with the destruction of the whole monastery unless Hiuen Tsang was sent to his court. Kumara-Raja wrote in his letter,</p>

<p>Another cruel persecutor of Buddhism was <strong>Mihirakula</strong>, who had occupied the throne of Kashmir. <strong>Kalhana Pandit</strong>, the famous chronicler of Kashmir and the author of <strong><em>Rajatarangini</em></strong>, says that for his atrocities he was like Yama, the god of death.

<p>Mihirakula oppressed the Buddhists and behaved with them cruelly. At his instigation not only were many Buddhists murdered but many Stupas, Caityas, Vihaaras, and other Buddhist establishments were destroyed in Punjab and Kashmir.

<p>This shows that the Brahmins were hand in glove with his slaughter of Buddhists and the destruction of the Buddhist establishments. So, the fake polemics of some Hindu writers that Mihirakula was not a Hindu or that his destruction of Buddhists establishments cannot be tied to Hindus are unfounded.<br />
Another hateful persecutor of Buddhists was Pushyamitra Sunga, founder of the Sunga Dynasty. Several Chinese and Japanese historians mention Pushyamitra’s name at the head of the list of persecutors. Buddhist writers portray Pushyanitra as a cruel persecutor of the religion of Sakyamuni (Buddha). Pushyamitra, a militant follower of Brahminism, assassinated the last Mauryan Emperor Brhadratha, capturing the throne of Magadha and founded the Sunga Dynasty. It ruled for a period of one hundred and twelve years.  Pushyamitra had to justify his position as head of the Brahmanic reaction by persecuting the Buddhists and destroying Buddhist monasteries on the one hand and restoring the sacrificial ceremonies of the Brahmanic faith on the other, for which his principal helpers were Patanjali and also perhaps Manu, the author of the <i>Manusmriti. </i>who was also his contemporary according to some scholars. The persecution of the Buddhists by Pushyamitra, was a logical sequence of the Brahmanic reaction and the political <em>coup d’etat</em>. The Buddhist text <em>Divyavadana </em>mentions the persecutions of Pushyamitra and his destruction of Buddhist stupas and monasteries. Hindutva apologists such as Dr. Koenraad Elst have tried to refute these charges on Pushyamitra, saying that they are “rendered improbable by external evidence”. Elst then claims that “he (Pushyamitra) allowed and patronized the construction of monasteries and Buddhist universities in his domains, as well as the still-extant stupa of Sanchi.” Although he gives no reference for this claim, it is possible that he was referring to the epigraph on the <strong>gateway of Barhut,</strong> which mentions its erection “during the supremacy of the Sungas“. The inscription uses the words <strong>सुगनं रजे</strong> (During the reign of Sungas). It does not necessarily include the reign of Pushyamitra. It only means ‘during the reign of Sungas’. The gateway was constructed during the reign of his successors who were more tolerant to Buddhism than the founder of the dynasty and leader of the Brahmanic reaction. That the gateways were erected long after the time of Pushyamitra is also the opinion of eminent archaeologists like Mr. N. G. Mazumdar, who writes,</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p>“The Sungas referred to in this inscription formed a dynasty which was founded by the general (Senapati) Pushyamitra, succeeding the Mauryas about 180 B.C. <strong>The gateways, however, appear to have been set up about a century later, towards the close o the Sunga period</strong>.”<br />

<p>Dr. Elst also quotes the historian of Buddhism, Etienne Lamotte, who wrote, “To judge from the documents, Pushyamitra must be acquitted through lack of proof”.

<blockquote class="quote-light"><p>“Buddhist sources claim that they (Sungas) persecuted the Buddhists and destroyed their monasteries and places of worship. This could have been an exaggeration, but archaeological evidence reveals that Buddhist monuments in the Sunga domain were at this time in disrepair and being renovated. However, if the chronology of these monuments shifts forward as is now being suggested, then this would make them post-Sunga renovations. Nevertheless, even if some renovations were of a later date, the damage to the stupa at Sanchi, and to the monastery at Kaushambi dates to Shunga times. Added emphasis is given to this from Pushyamitra having performed <em>ashvamedhas</em>, or horse sacrifices. This is sometimes viewed as indicating support of Vedic Brahmanism and a disapproval of heterodox sects.”<br />

<p> This view of Professor Thapar was confirmed when <strong>Deorkothar Stupas</strong>were excavated by P. K. Mishra (Archaeological Survey of India) in 1999 till 2000. The story about this Stupa was published by P. K. Mishra on the official website of the <em>Archaeology</em> magazine, a publication of the Archaeological Institute of America. P. K. Mishra wrote,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p>“The ancient Buddhist text <em>Divyavadanam </em>speaks of the death and destruction brought about by Pushyamitra Sunga, who ruled in the first quarter of the second century B.C., in a bid to glorify Hinduism. During his reign, Buddhist monuments were wantonly destroyed. Although archaeological evidence is meager in this regard, it seems likely that the Deorkothar stupa was destroyed as a result of Pushyamitra Sunga’s fanaticism. The exposed remains at Deorkothar bear evidence of deliberate destruction datable to his reign. The three-tiered railing is damaged; railing pillars lie, broken to smithereens, on stone flooring. Twenty pieces of pillar have been recovered, each fragment itself fractured. The site offers no indication of natural destruction.”<br />

Further Reading<br />
Buddhist scholars have also laid claim to many Hindu temples being original Buddhist Shrines. A book written by Dr. K. Jamnadas was titled <em>‘Tirupati Balaji was a Buddhist Shrine’</em>. In this book, the author has given huge stock of evidence to prove that the temple which is today sacred to Hindus was once a Buddhist Shrine. Readers are advised to make up their own mind after reading the book themselves and verifying the proofs.The book can be downloaded from the link <a style="color: #9f9f9f;" href="http://www.ambedkar.org/Tirupati/Tirupati.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener external" target="_blank" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">http://www.ambedkar.org/Tirupati/Tirupati.pdf<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Written by Ibn Muhammad</p>
<p>Among the most widely propagated myths in the world today is that Hinduism is the most tolerant religion and that it has had no history of persecuting the followers of other faiths. The advocates of Hinduism leave no stone unturned to make the masses believe this myth. The most favourite tactic of the modern advocates of Hinduism to divert attention from the actual history of Hinduism has been to demonize Islam and link it to oppression, terror, plunder, and what not. We often hear Hindutvavadi zealots using phrases like ‘Muslim genocide of Hindus’, ‘Muslims destroyed Hindu temples’, ‘Forcible conversion of Hindus to Islam’, and on and on.So far they have been able to hypnotize the naïve Hindu masses by this tactic and control their minds.</p>
<p><span id="more-3384"></span></p>
<p>In this article we will dig deeper into the Hindu sources to expose the intolerant and hateful picture they portray of Hindu history. The objective of this article is not to demonize Hindus but to challenge the misinformation that Hinduism has had no history of religious persecutions and intolerance. This article is not written from the perspective of the Aryan Invasion Theory but it will focus on the religious conflicts mentioned in the Hindu sources. Regardless of whether Aryans and non-Aryans were different races or not, it is certain that they had religious conflicts. Anyone who will not agree with the contents of this article must take the pen and disprove the claims made herein.</p>
<p>Let us first take a look at the <em>Vedas</em>, which are the most ancient books of Hindus, and how tolerant (?) they are towards the non-Aryans (Anaryas).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The religious intolerance of Aryans towards the non-Aryans</strong></p>
<p><strong>किं ते कर्ण्वन्ति कीकटेषु गावो नाशिरं दुह्रे न तपन्तिघर्मम |</strong><br />
<strong>आ नो भर परमगन्दस्य वेदो नैचाशाखं मघवन्रन्धयानः ||</strong></p>
<p>“O Indra, what do the cows make for you among the <strong>Kikatas</strong>? They neither yield milk for your offerings, nor do they warm the vessel of libation. Bring to us these cows; bring to us also the wealth of Parmagand (their King). O Brave one, grant us the possessions of the people of low status.” [<em>Rigveda</em> 3:53:14]
<p>‘Kikatas’ were a non-Aryan people living around modern Bihar, who reared cattle. The Aryans were eyeing their property and the way they expressed this desire to their God (Indra), reflects their mind-set. The reason given in these verses to snatch the cattle of the Kikatas is that they do not offer milk oblation to the Aryan god Indra. Explaining the word ‘Kikata’, <em>Nirukt, </em>the oldest treatise on etymology of Vedic words, says,</p>
<p><strong>कीकटा नाम देशो अनार्यनिवासः</strong></p>
<p>“<strong>Kikata</strong> is the name of a country where the non-Aryans dwell.”</p>
<p>Most scholars place this country around modern Bihar. This shows that Vedic Hinduism was not practiced in that region at least. The Kikatas were considered infidels (Naastikas) by the Aryans and thus were legitimate targets. It is worth mentioning how this verse has been translated by two erudite Hindu scholars Swami Satya Prakash Saraswati and Satyakam Vidyalankar in their English Translation of the Rigveda. They write,</p>
<p>“O bounteous Lord, of what avail <strong>are the cattle of the infidels</strong> to you. Neither they yield milk nor do <strong>these faithless persons</strong> kindle sacred fire. May you <strong>bring wealth of these unbelievers to us</strong> and give us possessions of people of low mortality and crush them.”</p>
[<em>Rigveda Samhita</em>, Tr. Satya Prakash Saraswati and Satyakam Vidyalankar; 1977, Vol IV, Page 1235]
<p>On the basis of this clear pronouncement, non-Aryans had no right to keep cows. Aryans, whenever they wished could kill them and appropriate their possessions. Hindu culture thus became the culture of the progress, civilization and welfare of the Aryan people alone.</p>
<p>These non-Aryans have been described at several places in the Vedas as anyavratam <strong>अन्यव्रतम<br />
</strong> (followers of another religion or creed), amaanusham <strong>अमानुषम<br />
</strong> (not human), ayajvaanam <strong>अयज्वानम<br />
</strong> (not performing Yajna) [Refer to <em>Rigveda</em> 8/70/11]
<p><strong>इन्द्रः समत्सु यजमानमार्यं परावद विश्वेषु शतमूतिराजिषु सवर्मीळ्हेष्वाजिषु |मनवे शासदव्रतान तवचं कर्ष्णामरन्धयत | </strong></p>
<p>Indra is said to help the Aryan worshippers in battles and punishes the neglecter of religious rites, who are said to be having ‘black skin ‘tvacham krishnaam’ (<strong>तवचं कर्ष्णाम</strong>). [<em>Rigveda</em> 1/130/8]
<p>The maidens of the ‘dark race’ are the said to be free sexual dishes of Aryans. Nirukt 12/13 mentions that ‘<strong>Raamaa</strong>‘, the lovely maidens belonging to the dark race are only for sexual enjoyment and not for any sacred purpose. <strong>रामा रमणाय उपेयते न धर्माय कृष्णजातिया</strong></p>
<p>Whether this description of ‘black race’ is literal or figurative is beyond the scope of this article. What is certain is that non-Aryans were hated by the Aryans for following a different religious creed. That this conflict was religious is evidenced by the <em>Rig Veda</em> itself.</p>
<p>Following mantras from the Rig-Veda illustrate the hatred of other religious groups:</p>
<p><strong>अकर्मा दस्युरभि नो अमन्तुरन्यव्रतो अमानुषः |<br />
तवन्तस्यामित्रहन वधर्दासस्य दम्भय ||</strong></p>
<p>“Around us is the Dasyu, practicing no religious rites, not knowing us thoroughly, inhuman, following other laws. Baffle, you Slayer of the foe, the strength of this Daasa.” [Rigveda 10/22/8]
<p>How many Dasyus were slaughtered? Let us turn to Atharvaveda 8/8/7 which says</p>
<p><strong>बृहत् ते जालं बृहत इन्द्र शूर सहस्रार्धस्य शत्वीर्यस्य |<br />
तेन शतं सहस्रमयुतं नयर्बुदं जधान शको दस्युनाममिधाय सेनया ||</strong></p>
<p>Great is your net, brave Indra, the mighty match for a thousand, Lord of Hundred Powers! Holding them, with his host, therewith has Indra slaughtered  Dasyus a hundred, thousand, myriad, hundred millions.</p>
<p><strong>असुन्वन्तं समं जहि दूणाशं यो न ते मयः |<br />
अस्मभ्यमस्य वेदनं दद्धि सूरिश्चिदोहते ||</strong></p>
<p>“Slay everyone who pours no gift, who, hard to reach, delights you not. Bestow on us what wealth he has: this even the worshipper awaits.” [Rigveda 1:176:4]
<p><strong>अनुव्रताय रन्धयन्नपव्रतानाभूभिरिन्द्रः शनथयन्ननाभुवः | </strong></p>
<p>“Indra abides, humbling the neglecters of holy rites, in favour of those who observe them, and punishing those who turn away from his worship, in favour of those who are present with their praise).” [Rigveda 1/51/9]
<p>It would thus appear that the non-Aryans lived in secluded spots far from the settlement of the Aryans, and performed their own peculiar rites which were regarded as wicked by the Aryan; and as they did not believe in the existence of Aryan gods, they incurred the hatred of their Vedic neighbours. The very existence of Indra was doubted by even some Aryans, which appears from the following mantra:</p>
<p><strong>यं समा पर्छन्ति कुह सेति घोरमुतेमाहुर्नैषो अस्तीत्येनम |</strong></p>
<p>“He, whom, terrible, they ask for, (saying), where is he? And assert that he is not.” [Rigveda 2/12/5]
<p>A certain Rishi called Nema is quoted as saying,</p>
<p><strong>पर सु सतोमं भरत वाजयन्त इन्द्राय सत्यं यदि सत्यमस्ति |<br />
नेन्द्रो अस्तीति नेम उ तव आह क ईं ददर्श कमभिष्टवाम ||</strong></p>
<p>Offer fervently, my war-loving companions, true praise to Indra, if he truly exists; Nema says, “verily there is no Indra,” who has ever seen him? Whom shall we praise? [Rigveda 8/100/3]
<p>It is thus clear that there were dissenters/apostates from the orthodox faith even in the Aryan society; and we can easily imagine the extent of ill feeling that existed between such dissenters and the orthodox Aryans, which afterwards led to a protracted sanguinary warfare resulting in the ultimate expulsion of the dissenters. These dissenters were called Aryan enemies and were different from the Daasas and Dasyus. Following mantras show the attitude of the orthodox Aryans towards the dissenters:</p>
<p><strong>न ते त इन्द्राभ्य अस्मद रष्वायुक्तासो अब्रह्मता यद असन | </strong></p>
<p>Since, mighty Indra, those who, differing from us, and are not united with you through their lack of devotion, are not yours; [Rigveda 5/33/3]
<p><strong>उत तया सद्य आर्या सरयोर इन्द्र पारतः |<br />
अर्णाचित्ररथावधीः ||</strong></p>
<p>“O Indra, you instantly killed Aryas, Arna and Chitraratha, on the other side of the Sarayu.” [Rigveda 4/30/18]
<p><strong>यस्ते मन्यो.अविधद वज्र सायक सह ओजः पुष्यति विश्वमानुषक |<br />
साह्याम दासमार्यं तवया युजा सहस्क्र्तेनसहसा सहस्वता ||</strong></p>
<p>“O Manyu (anger), help us so that we may successfully fight our enemies, whether belonging to the Arya clans or those of the Daasas.” [Rigveda 10/83/1]
<p><strong>एना मन्दानो जहि शूर शत्रूञ जामिमजामिं मघवन्नमित्रान |<br />
अभिषेणानभ्यादेदिशानान पराच इन्द्र पर मर्णाजही च || </strong></p>
<p>“O you valiant Maghavan, be exhilarated by this Soma drink, and destroy all our opposing enemies, whether they be our own kith and kin, or not.” [Rigveda 6/44/17]
<p>From these extracts, it would appear that the ancient Aryan society, as depicted in the Rigveda, was not an ideal peaceful society to live in. It was divided into numerous factions. The dissenters of the Vedic Aryans were driven out of the land, and some of them took refuge in the hills and forests of the western frontiers; while others passed out of the country through the north-western passess into Western Asia, and a wider world beyond. Here it is sufficient to state that these Aryan dissenters, who seceded from the orthodox faith, were subsequently known in history as the Iranians or Parsis or Zoroastrians. They were compelled to leave this country after a protracted war, which came to be known in the later Vedic literature and the Puranas as the Deva-Asura War (Devaasur-Sangraama).</p>
<p>Vedic Hinduism, most certainly, did not spread by peaceful means. A study of the Vedas reveals the enormous scale of religious conflicts that were going on in those times and how the Vedic Aryans were conquering city after city and fort after fort. The Vedas have never been brought in the public domain for precisely this reason. The people were not allowed to read, least they come to know of the brutal battles that were waged.</p>
<p><strong>Vedic Aastiks versus the non-Vedic Naastiks</strong></p>
<p>According to the Hinds, the people opposed to the Vedic religion are called Naastikas (disbelievers). Buddhism, Jainism and Chaarvaaka are called Naastik philosophies, as they do not accept the authority of the Vedas. Hindu Dharmashastras (religious texts) call for severing relations with the Naastiks and socially boycotting them. For example Manu Smriti says,</p>
<p>10. But by Sruti (revelation) is meant the Veda, and by Smriti (tradition) the Institutes of the sacred law: <strong>those two must not be called into question in any matter</strong>, since from those two the sacred law shone forth. 11. Every twice-born man, <strong>who, relying on the Institutes of dialectics, treats with contempt those two sources (of the law), must be cast out by the virtuous, as an atheist (Naastik) and a scorner of the Veda (Veda Nindak).</strong> [Manu Smriti 2/10-11]
<p>What should be the behaviour of Aryans towards these ‘Naastiks’ and ‘Veda Nindaks’? Let us turn to Atharvaveda Kaand 12, Sukt 5, Mantra 62. This mantra has been translated by Arya Samaj scholar Pandit Khem Karan Das Trivedi as follows</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="576" height="168" class="wp-image-7354" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201.png" alt="https://truthabouthinduism.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/083014_1719_hinduismand3.png?w=699&amp;h=204" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201.png 576w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201-300x88.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px" /></p>
<p>“Rend, rend to bits, rend through and through, scorch and consume and burn to dust, the one who rejects the Vedas.”</p>
<p>I do not think the above verse leaves any ambiguity as to who the enemies mentioned in the Vedas are. The mantra speaks for itself. It also prescribes the most gruesome forms of slaughter of those who disbelieve in the Vedas.</p>
<p>The same Sookt (hymn) also commands the following in mantras 65-71,</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="443" height="433" class="wp-image-7355" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201-1.png" alt="https://truthabouthinduism.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/083014_1719_hinduismand4.png?w=625" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201-1.png 443w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201-1-300x293.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 443px) 100vw, 443px" /></p>
<p>65) So, O Goddess, do thou from him, the Brāhmans’ tyrant,  criminal, niggard, blasphemer of the Gods,  66) With hundred-knotted thunderbolt, sharpened and edged with razor-blades, 67) <strong>Strike off the shoulders and the head. 68) Snatch thou the hair from off his head, and from his body strip the skin: 69) Tear out his sinews, cause his flesh to fall in pieces from his frame. 70) Crush thou his bones together, strike and beat the marrow out of him. 71) Dislocate all his limbs and joints.</strong></p>
<p>I wonder what type of mindset would have written this horrendous stuff? This extreme sadist mentality which relishes in instructing such horrible torture deserves to be banned forever before it is put to practice.  One can imagine what would have happened at the time when such teachings would have been enforced thousands of years back. These teachings were recently put into effect when innocent Muslims were burnt alive and tortured in the Indian State of Gujrat, Christians were burnt alive in many places of India especially in Orrisa. Jains and Buddhists in ancient times and Muslims, Christians and Sikhs in recent times have been made the experimental mice of these teachings.</p>
<p>Based on instructions such as these, followeres of non-Vedic religions like Buddhism and Jainsm were brutally persecuted by the Brahmins. Let us deal with these persecutions in detail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Intolerance towards Buddhists</strong></p>
<p>The Brahmanical hostility towards Buddhism was a major reason of the decline of Buddhism in India, the place of its birth. It is quite true that at a later date the Brahmins accepted Buddha as one of the avataras but it was just another srewd Brahmin way of showing contempt towards the Buddha. The Hindus never really showed any friendly attitude towards the followers of the religion of the Buddha, as it shown from various historical records. The Bramins first sowed the seeds of hatred towards the Buddhists in their scriptures to gain the sympatheis of the common people in slaughtering Buddhists.</p>
<p>In the Ayodhya Kaanda of Valmiki Ramayana, a Buddhist was compared to a thief and the Tathagatas to atheists (Naastiks). It said:</p>
<p><strong>यथा हि चोर स्स तथा हि बुद्ध-<br />
स्तथागतं नास्तिकमत्र विद्धि। </strong></p>
<p>As a thief, so is Buddha. Know that Tathagatas are atheists. [Sarga 109; shloka 34]
<p>The Yajnavalkya Smriti says that the very sight of a monk with red robes and shaven head (referring to Buddhists), even in a dream, is a bad sign. [Yajnavalkya SmritiI/272-273]
<p>The Agni Purana[16/1-3] and Vishnu Purana[18/13-18] refer to Buddha as an embodiment of Grand Deception (māyamohasvarup) and that he deluded the people from the Vedic Religion.  His path is a sure ticket to hell.</p>
<p>The great philosopher of Hinduism, Shankaracharya, said that the Buddha was suffering from what we know as schizophrenia. Shankaracharya said that</p>
<p>“<strong>he (Buddha) was a man given to make incoherent assertions or else that hatred of all beings</strong> induced him to propound absurd doctrines by accepting which they would become thoroughly confused.–So that–and this the Sûtra means to indicate–Buddha’s doctrine has to be entirely disregarded by all those who have a regard for their own happiness.” [Shankar Bhashya on Brahmasutra 2/2/32]
<p>The commentator of <em>Saankhyakaarika</em>, Vachaspati Mishra, uses the words <strong>‘Mleccha (filthy)’, Purushaapsad (low people) and PashuPraay (Animal like) </strong>for Buddhists, Jains, etc. He writes in <em>Saankhyatatva Kaumudi</em>:</p>
<p><strong>आप्तग्रहणेनाsयुक्ताः  शाक्यभिक्षुर्नि ग्रन्थकसंसारमो चकादीनामागमाभासाः परिहृता भवन्ति . अयुक्तत्वं चैतेषां विगानात्, विच्छन्न मूलत्वात्,  प्रमाणविरुद्धार्थाभिधानात् कैशिचदेव मलेच्छादिभिः पुरुषापसदैः पशुप्रायैः परिग्रहाद् बोद्धव्यम् .</strong></p>
<p>“By saying ‘true revelation’, all pretended revelations such as those of Shaakya, Bhikshu (Buddha),etc have been set aside. The invalidity of these systems is due to their making unreasonable assertions, to want of sufficient basis, to their making statements contradictory to proofs, and lastly<br />
to their being accepted only by <strong>Mlecchas, or by mean men or by animal like people</strong>. ”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Were Buddhists persecuted by Hindus? Yes, they were</strong></p>
<p>Buddhism suffered a great decline owing to the hostile activities of some philosphers of Brahminical thought and preachers of South India. Kumarila Bhatta was regarded as the fiercest critic of Buddhism. He was the strongest protagonist of Vedic ritualism. Kumarila is said to have been a Brahmin of Bihar who raged with the ardour to preach against Buddhism. The <strong><em>Shankar Digvijaya</em></strong> of Madhava (earliest authentic biography of Shankaracharya) refers to Malayali King Sudhanva’s brutal extermination of Buddhists at the instigation of Kumarila Bhatta.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="489" height="575" class="wp-image-7356" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201.gif" alt="https://truthabouthinduism.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/083014_1719_hinduismand5.gif?w=625" /></p>
<p>The king (Sudhanva) commanded his servants “kill all Buddhists from Himalaya to Rameshvaram, <strong>even children and elderly</strong>. Whosoever will not kill them, will be killed at my hands.” [93] At the instigation of Kumarila Bhatta, the king killed the Buddhists, the opponents (of the Hindu religion) just like a Yogi destroys the disturbances. [95] <strong>[Madhava-Vidyaranya, Sankara Digvijaya Sarg 1; shlokas 93-95]</strong></p>
<p>This was about Kumarila’s brutal persecution of Buddhists. Now let us turn to Adi Shankaracharya, the Brahmin of South India, who did  a great job of glorifying the <em>Vedas </em>and the <em>Advaita Vedanta</em> philosophy. He was vigorously anti-Buddhism. I have already quoted his remarks on Buddha, which show his ‘regard’ for the Buddhist religion (Refer Shankar Bhasya on Brahmasutra 2/2/32). With regards to the Sringeri matha built by Shankaracharya, Sir Charles Eliot in his book <em>Hinduism and Buddhism</em> (1921 Ed. Page 211) says,</p>
<p>“There is some reason to suppose that the Matha of Sringeri was founded on the site of a Buddhist Monestary”</p>
<p>The 15th Sarga of his biography <em>Madhava-Vidyaranya Sankara Digvijay </em>refers to his campaigns against the Buddhists, being escorted by King Sudhanvan’s army wherever he went from the Himalayas to the India Ocean. Owing to his anti Buddhist activities, Buddhism fell on its evil days.</p>
<p>This royal persecution of Buddhists by some Brahminic rulers was the most potent factor which contributed to bring the decline of Buddhism in India. The <strong><em>Budaun Stone Inscription</em><br />
</strong> of Lakhanapaala refers to one <strong>Varamasiva, a Saiva ascetic, </strong>who destroyed an idol of Buddha in the South (Dakshinapatha) before his arrival in Vodamayuta (Epigraphia Indica vol.1, Page 63)</p>
<p>A <strong>Chalukya Inscription</strong> of 1184 A.D. refers to a feudatory chief,<strong> Mahaamandaleshvara Viruparasadeva</strong>, who is described as a ‘forest-fire to the Jain religion’, a ‘destroyer of the Buddha religion’, a ‘demolisher of Jain basadis’ and ‘establisher of the Sivalinga-Simhaasana (Shiva Linga Throne).He destroyed several <em>samayas </em>at Pariyalige, Anilevada (Anhilwad), Unukallu (Unkal), Sampagadi (Sampagaon), Ibbaluru (Ablur?), Marudige (Maradigi), Anampur (Alampur), KaTahada (Karad), Kembhavi, Bammakuru and other places. [Annual report of the archaeological survey of India 1929-30 Page 171]
<p>We know from the record of the Nalanda Inscription of Vipulasrimitra, that a <strong>Vangala </strong>army killed a Buddhist monk named <strong>Karunasrimitra</strong> of <strong>Somapura </strong>and burnt down his house, which was actually a monastery. [Epigraphia Indica vol.21 Page 97]
<p>Another fierce Hindu king who showed his great hostility towards Buddhism was <strong>Shashanka, the King of Gauda</strong>. He was a notable example of anti-Buddhist Brahminical fanaticism. He is said to have uprooted the sacred Bodhi-Tree at Bodh-Gaya but in order to destroy it totally, he burnt its remains. A Buddha image from a temple east of the Bodhi tree was removed by him and in its place, he installed an image of Siva. [On Yuan Chwang’s Travels in India vol. 2 by Thomas Watters, 1905, Pages 115,116]
<p>This is corroborated by <em>The Life of Hiuen Tsiang by the Shaman Hwui Li</em> who mentions that a certain <strong>Kumaara-Raja</strong> threatened the monks of Nalanda with a behaviour similar to Shashanka, and with the destruction of the whole monastery unless Hiuen Tsang was sent to his court. Kumara-Raja wrote in his letter,</p>
<p>“I have again sent a messenger with a written request: If he (Hiuen Tsang) does not  come, your disciple will then let the evil portion of himself prevail. In recent times Shanshanka-Raja was equal still to the destruction of the law and uprooted the Bodhi tree. Do you, my Master, suppose that your disciple has no such power as this?

<p>Another cruel persecutor of Buddhism was <strong>Mihirakula</strong>, who had occupied the throne of Kashmir. <strong>Kalhana Pandit</strong>, the famous chronicler of Kashmir and the author of <strong><em>Rajatarangini</em></strong>, says that for his atrocities he was like Yama, the god of death. Kalhana describes further: “One’s tongue would become polluted if one attempted to record his cruelties and evil deeds in detail” [<strong><em><a href="http://www.dli.ernet.in/cgi-bin/metainfo.cgi?&amp;title1=kalhana%27s%20rajtarangini%20a%20chronicle%20of%20the%20kings%20of%20kashmir&amp;author1=stein,%20m.a.&amp;subject1=kashmir%20history&amp;year=1900%20&amp;language1=english&amp;pages=580&amp;barcode=99999990253849&amp;author2=NULL&amp;identifier1=NULL&amp;publisher1=archibald%20constable%20and%20co.%20ltd.&amp;contributor1=NULL&amp;vendor1=NONE&amp;scanningcentre1=uod,delhi&amp;slocation1=NONE&amp;sourcelib1=central%20library,%20delhi%20university&amp;scannerno1=0&amp;digitalrepublisher1=NULL&amp;digitalpublicationdate1=0000-00-00&amp;numberedpages1=0&amp;unnumberedpages1=0&amp;rights1=not%20available&amp;copyrightowner1=NULL&amp;copyrightexpirydate1=0000-00-00&amp;format1=book%20&amp;url=/data4/upload/0106/653" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Rajatarangini <span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></em></strong>I, 289,290 and 304; Translated by M. A. Stein]. From his account it is known that Mihirakula played an important role in the development of Brahmanism. He was a worshipper of Shiva and built a Shiva temple in Srinagara [<em><a href="http://www.dli.ernet.in/cgi-bin/metainfo.cgi?&amp;title1=kalhana%27s%20rajtarangini%20a%20chronicle%20of%20the%20kings%20of%20kashmir&amp;author1=stein,%20m.a.&amp;subject1=kashmir%20history&amp;year=1900%20&amp;language1=english&amp;pages=580&amp;barcode=99999990253849&amp;author2=NULL&amp;identifier1=NULL&amp;publisher1=archibald%20constable%20and%20co.%20ltd.&amp;contributor1=NULL&amp;vendor1=NONE&amp;scanningcentre1=uod,delhi&amp;slocation1=NONE&amp;sourcelib1=central%20library,%20delhi%20university&amp;scannerno1=0&amp;digitalrepublisher1=NULL&amp;digitalpublicationdate1=0000-00-00&amp;numberedpages1=0&amp;unnumberedpages1=0&amp;rights1=not%20available&amp;copyrightowner1=NULL&amp;copyrightexpirydate1=0000-00-00&amp;format1=book%20&amp;url=/data4/upload/0106/653" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Rajatarangini<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></em> I, 306; M. A. Stein]. The view that he was a Shaivite is upheld by M. A. Stein as he writes,</p>
<p>“The impression which this tradition retained of Mihirakula’s religious propensities, is in full accord with the evidence of his coins which, in the emblems of bull and trident and in the legends of jayatu vrsa, jayatu vrsadhvaja, display a distinct leaning towards Shaivism.” [<strong><em>Rajatarangini</em></strong>; M. A. Stein; Footnote to I, 289]
<p>Mihirakula oppressed the Buddhists and behaved with them cruelly. At his instigation not only were many Buddhists murdered but many Stupas, Caityas, Vihaaras, and other Buddhist establishments were destroyed in Punjab and Kashmir. The description of his cruelties as described in the <em>Rajatarangini </em>is corroborated by the description given by Hiuen Tsang in his book <strong><em>Si-Yu-Ki</em></strong>. He writes,</p>
<p>“He exterminated the royal family and the chief minister, overthrew stupas, destroyed the sangharamas, altogether one thousand six hundred foundations.” [Si-Yu-Ki. Buddhist Records of the Western World Tr. Samuel Beal, 1969; Book iv, Page 171]
<p>Mihirakula’s hostility towards the Buddhist was shared by the Shaivite Brahmins. Kalhana comments in the <em>Rajatarangini </em>on the greed of the Brahmins who eagerly accepted grants of land from Mihirakula.</p>
<p>“Brahmins from Gandhara, resembling himself in their habits and verily themselves the lowest of the twice-born, accepted Agraharas from him.” [<em><a href="http://www.dli.ernet.in/cgi-bin/metainfo.cgi?&amp;title1=kalhana%27s%20rajtarangini%20a%20chronicle%20of%20the%20kings%20of%20kashmir&amp;author1=stein,%20m.a.&amp;subject1=kashmir%20history&amp;year=1900%20&amp;language1=english&amp;pages=580&amp;barcode=99999990253849&amp;author2=NULL&amp;identifier1=NULL&amp;publisher1=archibald%20constable%20and%20co.%20ltd.&amp;contributor1=NULL&amp;vendor1=NONE&amp;scanningcentre1=uod,delhi&amp;slocation1=NONE&amp;sourcelib1=central%20library,%20delhi%20university&amp;scannerno1=0&amp;digitalrepublisher1=NULL&amp;digitalpublicationdate1=0000-00-00&amp;numberedpages1=0&amp;unnumberedpages1=0&amp;rights1=not%20available&amp;copyrightowner1=NULL&amp;copyrightexpirydate1=0000-00-00&amp;format1=book%20&amp;url=/data4/upload/0106/653" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Rajatarangini<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></em> I, 307; M. A. Stein]
<p>This shows that the Brahmins were hand in glove with his slaughter of Buddhists and the destruction of the Buddhist establishments. So, the fake polemics of some Hindu writers that Mihirakula was not a Hindu or that his destruction of Buddhists establishments cannot be tied to Hindus are unfounded.</p>
<p>Another hateful persecutor of Buddhists was Pushyamitra Sunga, founder of the Sunga Dynasty. Several Chinese and Japanese historians mention Pushyamitra’s name at the head of the list of persecutors. Buddhist writers portray Pushyanitra as a cruel persecutor of the religion of Sakyamuni (Buddha). Pushyamitra, a militant follower of Brahminism, assassinated the last Mauryan Emperor Brhadratha, capturing the throne of Magadha and founded the Sunga Dynasty. It ruled for a period of one hundred and twelve years.  Pushyamitra had to justify his position as head of the Brahmanic reaction by persecuting the Buddhists and destroying Buddhist monasteries on the one hand and restoring the sacrificial ceremonies of the Brahmanic faith on the other, for which his principal helpers were Patanjali and also perhaps Manu, the author of the <em>Manusmriti. </em>who was also his contemporary according to some scholars. The persecution of the Buddhists by Pushyamitra, was a logical sequence of the Brahmanic reaction and the political <em>coup d’etat</em>. The Buddhist text <em>Divyavadana </em>mentions the persecutions of Pushyamitra and his destruction of Buddhist stupas and monasteries. Hindutva apologists such as Dr. Koenraad Elst have tried to refute these charges on Pushyamitra, saying that they are “rendered improbable by external evidence”. Elst then claims that “he (Pushyamitra) allowed and patronized the construction of monasteries and Buddhist universities in his domains, as well as the still-extant stupa of Sanchi.” Although he gives no reference for this claim, it is possible that he was referring to the epigraph on the <strong>gateway of Barhut,</strong> which mentions its erection “during the supremacy of the Sungas“. The inscription uses the words <strong>सुगनं रजे</strong> (During the reign of Sungas). It does not necessarily include the reign of Pushyamitra. It only means ‘during the reign of Sungas’. The gateway was constructed during the reign of his successors who were more tolerant to Buddhism than the founder of the dynasty and leader of the Brahmanic reaction. That the gateways were erected long after the time of Pushyamitra is also the opinion of eminent archaeologists like Mr. N. G. Mazumdar, who writes,</p>
<p>“The Sungas referred to in this inscription formed a dynasty which was founded by the general (Senapati) Pushyamitra, succeeding the Mauryas about 180 B.C. <strong>The gateways, however, appear to have been set up about a century later, towards the close o the Sunga period</strong>.” [A Guide To The Sculptures In The Indian Museum, Pt.I N. G. Mazumdar, 1937 Ed., Page 13]
<p>Dr. Elst also quotes the historian of Buddhism, Etienne Lamotte, who wrote, “To judge from the documents, Pushyamitra must be acquitted through lack of proof”. [History of Indian Buddhism, Institut Orientaliste, Louvain-la-Neuve 1988/1958, p.109] Firstly, this reference is incorrect as the page number is 392. Even then, let me provide the complete quote of Etienne Lamotte. He writes,</p>
<p>“To judge from the documents, Pushyamitra must be acquitted through lack of proof. Nevertheless, as was remarked by H. Kern, in view of the varied opinions, <strong>it is possible that, in some localities, there may have been pillages of monasteries, perhaps with the tacit permission of the governors</strong>. ”</p>
<p>Prominent Indian historian, professor Romila Thapar writes,</p>
<p>“Buddhist sources claim that they (Sungas) persecuted the Buddhists and destroyed their monasteries and places of worship. This could have been an exaggeration, but archaeological evidence reveals that Buddhist monuments in the Sunga domain were at this time in disrepair and being renovated. However, if the chronology of these monuments shifts forward as is now being suggested, then this would make them post-Sunga renovations. Nevertheless, even if some renovations were of a later date, the damage to the stupa at Sanchi, and to the monastery at Kaushambi dates to Shunga times. Added emphasis is given to this from Pushyamitra having performed <em>ashvamedhas</em>, or horse sacrifices. This is sometimes viewed as indicating support of Vedic Brahmanism and a disapproval of heterodox sects.”  <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="367" height="253" class="wp-image-7357 alignright" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201.jpeg" alt="https://truthabouthinduism.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/083014_1719_hinduismand6.jpg?w=551&amp;h=380" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201.jpeg 367w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201-300x207.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 367px) 100vw, 367px" /><strong> [The Penguin History of Early India from the origins to AD 1300, Romila Thapar, 2002 Edition, Pg. 210</strong>]
<p>This view of Professor Thapar was confirmed when <strong>Deorkothar Stupas</strong> were excavated by P. K. Mishra (Archaeological Survey of India) in 1999 till 2000. The story about this Stupa was published by P. K. Mishra on the official website of the <em>Archaeology</em> magazine, a publication of the Archaeological Institute of America. P. K. Mishra wrote,</p>
<p>“The ancient Buddhist text <em>Divyavadanam </em>speaks of the death and destruction brought about by Pushyamitra Sunga, who ruled in the first quarter of the second century B.C., in a bid to glorify Hinduism. During his reign, Buddhist monuments were wantonly destroyed. Although archaeological evidence is meager in this regard, <strong>it seems likely that the Deorkothar stupa was destroyed as a result of Pushyamitra Sunga’s fanaticism. The exposed remains at Deorkothar bear evidence of deliberate destruction datable to his reign</strong>. The three-tiered railing is damaged; railing pillars lie, broken to smithereens, on stone flooring. Twenty pieces of pillar have been recovered, each fragment itself fractured. The site offers no indication of natural destruction.”</p>

<p>Further Reading</p>
<p>Buddhist scholars have also laid claim to many Hindu temples being original Buddhist Shrines. A book written by Dr. K. Jamnadas was titled <em>‘Tirupati Balaji was a Buddhist Shrine’</em>. In this book, the author has given huge stock of evidence to prove that the temple which is today sacred to Hindus was once a Buddhist Shrine. Readers are advised to make up their own mind after reading the book themselves and verifying the proofs.The book can be downloaded from the link <a href="http://www.ambedkar.org/Tirupati/Tirupati.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">http://www.ambedkar.org/Tirupati/Tirupati.pdf<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>

<p><strong>Intolerance towards Jains</strong></p>
<p>The jains also were not immune to the Brahmanic persecution. Like Buddhism, the Jain religion is also reviled in the Hindu scriptures. Padma Puran Bhumi Khand 2/38/25-27 says</p>
<p>जैनधर्मं समाश्रित्य सर्वे पापप्रमोहिताः</p>
<p>वेदाचारं परित्यज्य पापं यास्यन्ति मानवाः</p>
<p>पापस्य मूलमेवं वै जैनधर्मो न संशयः ,</p>
<p>अनेन मुग्धा राजेंद्र महामोहेन पातिताः</p>
<p>“Men deluded by sins, resort to the Jaina religion. They abandon the Vedic practices and will committ sins. There is no doubt that the Jaina faith is the root of sin. O best King, the fall of those men, who are sinners, is brought about by this great delusion (i.e Jainism).”</p>
<p>Bhavishya Puran, prati sarg parv 3,/3/28/53 says,</p>
<p>न वदेद् यावनीं भाषां प्राणैः कण्ठगतैरापि ,</p>
<p>गजैरापीड्यमानोsपि  न गच्छेद् जैनमन्दिरम्</p>
<p>“What ever may be the amount of pain inflicted, and even though the life be in jeopardy, let not the language of the Yavanas (Muslims) be employed in speech. Let no one save his life by seeking refuge in a Jain temple, even though he be pursued by a mad elephant, (for it is better to be killed by him than to set foot in a Jain temple).”</p>
<p><strong>Persecution of Jains</strong></p>

<p>Jains were brutally persecuted by Hindu Shaivites and Vaishnavites. The Shaivite were aided in their persecutions by the kings of the Chola Dynasty. The marriage of the Chola king Sundara Pandya with the sister of Rajendra, lead to the his conversion to Shaivism. Sundara became a fanatic Saivite and he persecuted the compatriots of his earlier faith, with ruthless cruelty. It is said that he sentenced to death by impalement <strong>not less than 8000 of his subjects who did not want to be converted to Shaivism</strong>. The impalement of these unfortunate people is said to have been graphically depicted on many sculptures on the walls of the temple of Tivatur in North Arcot (<a href="http://www.dli.ernet.in/cgi-bin/metainfo.cgi?&amp;title1=Coins%20Of%20Southern%20India&amp;author1=Elliot,%20W.&amp;subject1=GEOGRAPHY.%20BIOGRAPHY.%20HISTORY&amp;year=1886%20&amp;language1=english&amp;pages=195&amp;barcode=4990010112828&amp;author2=&amp;identifier1=&amp;publisher1=Cosmo%20Publications,%20New%20Delhi&amp;contributor1=&amp;vendor1=NONE&amp;scanningcentre1=cdack&amp;slocation1=NONE&amp;sourcelib1=THE%20ASIATIC%20SOCIETY,%20KOLKATA&amp;scannerno1=0&amp;digitalrepublisher1=Digital%20Library%20Of%20India&amp;digitalpublicationdate1=2007-02-02&amp;numberedpages1=&amp;unnumberedpages1=&amp;rights1=In%20Public%20Domain&amp;copyrightowner1=&amp;copyrightexpirydate1=&amp;format1=Tagged%20Image%20File%20Format%20&amp;url=/rawdataupload/upload/0112/830" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Coins of Southern India; Sir.

<p>Another scholar, T. A. Gopinath Rao, writing about the dating of Puranas and Agamas, in his book Elements of Hindu Iconolgraphy, reveals that the event of the impalement of Jains is mentioned in Uttara-Kaaranaagama. He writes,</p>

<p>Swami Dayananda Saraswati, founder of Arya Samaj, also speaks about the destruction of Jain idols at the hands of Hindus or former Jains. In his book, Satyarth Prakash, under the topic of Shankaracharya, he writes,</p>
<p>“For ten years he (Shankaracharya) toured all over the country, refuted Jainism and advocated the Vedic religion. All the broken images that are now-a-days dug out of the earth were broken in the time of Shankar, whilst those that are found whole here and there under the ground had been buried by the Jainis for fear of their being broken” [Satyarth Prakash, Agniveer Edition, Chapter 11, Page 224]
<p><strong>Sectarian Intolerance within Hinduism</strong></p>
<p>Shaivites and Vaishnavites are the two major sects under the umbrella name ‘Hinduism’, takinng Shiva and Vishnu respectively as the chief objects of their worship. Srimad Bhagvata Purana is a Vaishnava scripture. Concerning Shiva Bhaktas (devotees) it says,</p>
<p>भवव्रतधरा ये च ये च तान् समनुव्रताः</p>
<p>पाखंडिनस्ते भवन्तु सच्छास्त्रपरिपन्थि</p>
<p>मुमुक्षवो घोररूपान् हित्वा भूतपतीनथ ,</p>
<p>नारायणकलाः शान्ताः भजन्तीत्यनसूयवः</p>
<p>“One who takes a vow to satisfy Shiva or who follows such principles will certainly become an atheist and be diverted from transcendental scriptural injunctions. Those who vow to worship Shiva are so foolish that they imitate him by keeping long hair on their heads. When initiated into worship of Lord Śiva, they prefer to live on wine, flesh and other such things.” [Bhagvatapuran 4/2/28-29]
<p>On the other hand the Shaivite scripture Saur purana has this response to give to the Vaishnavites</p>
<p>चतुर्दशविद्यासु गीयते चन्द्रशेखरः</p>
<p>तेन तुल्यो यदा विष्णुः ब्रह्मा वा यदि गद्यते</p>
<p>षष्टिवर्षसहस्राणि विष्ठायां जायते कृमिः</p>
<p>“Fourteen sciences sing the praises of Shiva. A person who puts Brahma or Vishnu on an equal level to Shiva, it incurs him a grievous sin on account of which <strong>he will suffer for 60,000 years as an insect</strong>.” [Saur Puran 40/15,17]
<p>Continuing the tirade, Padma Puran says,</p>
<p>तस्माद् विष्णोः प्रसादो वै सेवितव्यो द्विजन्मना,</p>
<p>इतरेषां देवानां निमल्यिं गर्हितं भवेत् .</p>
<p>सकृदेव हि योsश्नाति ब्राह्मणो ज्ञानदुर्बलः</p>
<p>निर्मल्यिं शंकरा दीनां स चांडालो भवेद ध्रुवं</p>
<p>“Dwijas (Brahmin, Khatriya, Vaishya) should only eat the Prasad offered to Vishnu, not of any other deity. If any foolish Brahmin, even once, will consume the prasad of Shiva, it is certain that he will be born as a Chandal (outcaste).”</p>
<p>विष्णुदर्शनमात्रेण शिवद्रोहः प्रजायते ,</p>
<p>शिवद्रोहान्न संदेहो नरकं याति दांरूणम्</p>
<p>Even having a glimpse of Vishnu, is tantamount to being a traitor to Shiva and such a person will be cast into hell.</p>
<p><strong>Modern Examples</strong></p>
<p>Swami Dayanand Saraswati (real name Moolshanker), was the founder of Arya Samaj cult. In his book Satyarth Prakash, he criticized various sects in Hinduism in a very rude manner. Few days back, a facebook fan page of preacher Dr. Zakir Naik, uploaded some images with quotes from Naik about the Hindu god Ganesha. Hindus took offence and the notorious anti-Muslim organization, Agniveer, spread this news like wildfire on the social media. Below is a snapshot from Agniveer’s official page on facebook.</p>

<p>But the question here is, if Naik is condemned as a terrorist for asking a logical question, what would the Hindutva zealots say about the quotations I have provided from their own books about other religions and sects? Moreover, why not call their own Guru, Dayanand Saraswati as a terrorist also, because has expresses the same ‘offensive’ views about Hindu sects, scriptures and deities. Following quotes from his hateful book Satyarth Prakash, will suffice.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks about Srimad Bhagavat Puran</strong></p>
<p>“Fie on you! O you senseless, <strong>idiotic author of the Bhagvat Puranana. What a shameless creature you were!</strong> You did not feel a bit of shame or hesitation in writing such falsehood! You became so utterly blind.” [Satyarth Prakash, Agniveer Edition, Page 264]
<p><strong>Remarks about Idol Worship</strong></p>
<p><strong>Idol worship is a fraud</strong>. The Jaiinees were the authors of this mode of worship. [ibid Page 240]
<p>It is<strong> evil practices like idol worship</strong> that are responsible for the existence of millions of idle, lazy, indolent, and beggarly priests in India, who are mainly answerable for this wide-spread ignorance, fraud and mendacity in the country. [ibid 384] What an insult to the priests of India! Again, if you take to idol-worship, instead of keeping company with learned men, <strong>you will become greater dunces than you were before</strong>. [ibid Page 369]
<p><strong>Remarks about Guru Nanak</strong></p>
<p>“He could never have done unless <strong>he was anxious to gain public applause, fame and glory. He must have sought after fame</strong> or he would have preached in the language he know and told the people that he had not read Sanskrit. Since he was a little vain, he may possibly have even resorted to some sort of make-believe to gain reputation and acquire fame,..” [ibid page 289]
<p>These are only few samples of modern intolerance amongst Hindus. This article has exposed the double standards of Hindutva zealots who are so militant vis a vis Islam and always grab the opportunity to demonize Muslims and Islam. They should first do a good thorough study of their own books and history before pointing their fingers at us. The issue of Caste persecution also comes under the theme of religious intolerance, however, I have already written on that topic. You can read it here ( <a href="/index.php/2014/01/01/caste-and-racial-discrimination/" data-wpel-link="internal">/index.php/2014/01/01/caste-and-racial-discrimination/</a> ). Time and time again Hindutva brigade bring up the issue of banning the Qurán. Before doing so, let them establish an example by banning their own Vedas, Puranas, etc and books like Satyarth Prakash, for now we all know the intolerant messages they preach.</p>

By Sulaiman Razvi</p>
<p>Some Hindus accuse non Hindus of being communal and violent. Claims that only they are peaceful and most tolerant community in the world. Ironically these lines are said by them after hurling couple of abuses at other religions. Let&#8217;s have a look at communal violence perpetrated by Hindus. I am not talking about history which tells tale about bloodshed of Jains, Buddhists and indigenous groups in India by Hindus, But this deals with their deeds since Independence of India. It is impossible to post all communal violence as there were total 644 communal incidents in India in <a href="http://www.ibnlive.com/news/india/communal-incidents-on-rise-in-2015-up-tops-the-list-syas-home-ministry-1029008.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">2014<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> alone, <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/327-rise-in-agrarian-riots-in-2015-NCRB-report-shows/article14598321.ece" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">789<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> communal riots in 2015, <a href="https://www.indiaspend.com/in-2016-ncrb-recorded-869-communal-riots-home-ministry-says-703-703/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">869<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> communal riots in 2016 and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/bihar-on-top-in-2017-communal-riot-cases/articleshow/71727290.cms" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">723<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> communal riots in 2017 as per NCRB, so I will highlight only few cases. There are 6.6% Hindus in UAE, 13.8% in Qatar, 1.6% in Indonesia and 6.3% in Malaysia but in none of these countries we hear that there was a communal clash between Hindus and Muslims. It happens in India alone because Hindus are in majority. Before talking about persecution of minorities by Hindu extremists let&#8217;s have a look at intolerance within the Hindu community.<br />

The National Human Rights Commission Report on the Prevention of Atrocities against Scheduled Castes says that, &#8220;every 18 minutes a crime is committed against a Dalit. Every day 3 Dalit women are raped, 2 Dalits are murdered and 2 Dalits Houses are burnt in India, 11 Dalits are beaten. Every week: 13 Dalits are murdered, 5 Dalits home or possessions are burnt, 6 Dalits are kidnapped or abducted.&#8221;<br />

<p>The term Bhagwa Love Trap doesn’t just mean that Hindus have trapped innocent Muslim girls but this term denotes all those cases of rape, harassment, and murder of Muslim women by Hindus. Hindus have been taught by their religion to sexually violate non-Hindu girls as mentioned in Matsya Purana about the story of Indra forcing non-Hindu women into prostitution. Muslim men are killed and even persecuted by the authorities and government for being in relationships with Hindu women, Hindus have passed so-called “Love Jihad” laws to prevent Muslim men from marrying Hindu girls, cases of kidnap and forceful conversion are lodged by parents of Hindu girls and Hindu organizations when the Muslim boy and Hindu girl elopes, a house and three shops of a Muslim man were demolished by district authorities for eloping with a Hindu girl in Madhya Pradesh’s Dindori district. Several Hindu leaders have openly threatened and instigated Hindus to rape and pick up Muslim women with impunity and none of them were arrested for passing such hate speeches, Yogi Adityanath’s men have even threatened to rape dead Muslim women by digging their graves. It’s not just Hindu leaders who have been instigating Hindu youths to rape Muslim women, Hindus promote Bhagwa Love Trap through movies and T.V serials also.</p>
<p>In several instances, rapists of Muslim girls were supported by the Hindu community as this is what their Dharm teaches them. They celebrate the rape of Vrinda by Vishnu as a festival called Tulsi Vivah. Five cops were injured after a clash with a Hindu terrorist organization VHP who were protesting the arrest of a Hindu boy who had raped a 17-year-old girl belonging to a minority community in Noida. 8 year old Muslim girl Asifa Bano was raped and murdered by a Hindu police officer, a temple priest, and other Hindus in Kathua, Jammu. Thousands of Hindus headed by two BJP leaders took out a rally in support of the Hindu rapists waving tricolor, one of those BJP leaders was later rewarded by BJP with a higher post in the party, and the family members of Asifa Bano had to bury her 8 kilometers away from the city due as local Hindus had stopped the funeral, several Hindu lawyers held a protest trying to protect Hindu rapists. In another instance, Abbasi, an advocate for the rape victim said police were trying to shield two rapists in Dholka city of Ahmedabad in which a former BJP councilor&#8217;s son was arrested. A Muslim girl was raped by her Hindu teacher in Himachal Pradesh’s Kushinagar, the furious relatives of the girl beat up the rapist which local Hindus didn’t like so they started a riot against Muslims and several shops were vandalized.</p>
<p>Even in cases of consensual marriage by a Hindu boy and a Muslim girl, the Muslim girl is converted to Hinduism. When the Hindu man has satiated his lust then he tortures his ex-Muslim wife, abandons her, and murders her. Mainstream English media in India doesn&#8217;t report cases of Bhagwa Love Trap, many cases in this list were taken from regional Hindi media, and many reports from non-Hindi regional media have not been collected.</p>

<h1><a name="Hate-Speech"></a>Hate Speeches</h1>
<ul>
<li>Atal Bihari Vajpayee gave several hate speeches against Muslims and justified Gujarat riot calling it retaliation,<br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>GUJARAT RIOT</strong></span><br />
“What happened in Gujarat? If a conspiracy had not been hatched to burn alive the innocent passengers of the Sabarmati Express, then the subsequent tragedy in Gujarat could have been averted. But this did not happen. People were torched alive. Who were those culprits? The government is investigating into this. Intelligence agencies are collecting all the information. But we should not forget how the tragedy of Gujarat started. The subsequent developments were no doubt condemnable, but who lit the fire? How did the fire spread?” <strong>He also said</strong>,<br />
“Wherever Muslims live, they don’t like to live in co-existence with others, they don’t like to mingle with others; and instead of propagating their ideas in a peaceful manner, they want to spread their faith by resorting to terror and threats. The world has become alert to this danger.”<br />

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>NELLIE MASSACRE</strong></span><br />
Nellie massacre took place in February 1983. Nellie is located in Morigaon district of Assam. More than 2,000 people were killed. Almost all were Bengali Muslims. Assam was preparing for polls and Vajpayee, as the BJP president, was campaigning in the state.<br />
In one of his speeches, Vajpayee was quoted as saying, &#8220;Foreigners have come here and the government does nothing. What if they had come into Punjab instead? People would have chopped them into pieces and thrown them away.&#8221; Atal Bihari Vajpayee was quoted by former CPI-M MP Indrajit Gupta during a debate on trust vote moved by Atal Bihari Vajpayee in May, 1996. The attributed portion of speech went uncontested in the Lok Sabha.<br />
Soon after his speech violence erupted in Nellie. Vajpayee had returned to New Delhi after his speech in Assam.<br />

“Now, efforts are being made for a Dalit-Muslim alliance. Babasaheb had himself termed these jihadis untrustworthy. We need to make aware people about this,” the RSS chief said.<br />

(At Etah UP in 2005)* On minorities: We want you (minorities) not to kill anybody and live peacefully and concentrate on progress&#8230;If the other side does not stay in peace, we will teach them how to stay in peace&#8230;in the language that they understand. (During a TV programme on August 31, 2014)* On riots : There have been 450 riots in west UP in two-and-a-half years of Samajwadi Party because the population of a particular community is rising manifold. In places where there are 10-20% minority population, stray communal incidents take place. Where there are 20-35% of them, serious communal riots take place and where they are more than 35%, there is no place for non-Muslims. (at a rally in Noida on September 7, 2014)<br />

<li>India&#8217;s New York General Consul Sandeep Chakravorty who is an Indian Foreign Service (IFS) officer of the 1996 batch makes pro-Hindu and anti-Muslim statements at a private gathering, calls for imposing the Israeli modi in Kashmir,<br />
&#8220;Anupamji said that in India we think about everyone else, about other&#8217;s religions, but unfortunately not everyone thinks that way. I think we made the strategic blunder that we thought that everybody is thinking like us, but everybody is not thinking like us.<br />
&#8220;We should start thinking like others, and then only we will be able to beat them at their game. I think we have to do that, and that thinking is now coming&#8230;&#8221;&#8221;We have to go beneath the reasoning and understand why it (revoking Article 370) was done. I think somebody spoke about the Jewish issue, they (Jews) kept their culture alive for 2,000 years, outside their land, and they went back. I think we all have to keep Kashmiri culture alive, Kashmiri culture is the Indian culture, it is Hindu culture. I feel as much Kashmiri as anybody else.&#8221;<br />

<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-6528" src="http://vedkabhed.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Court-Justice-FB_IMG_1502563047756-212x300.jpg" alt="" width="377" height="377" /></p>
<p>Courts are set up for giving justice to victims and punishing the culprits but what&#8217;s the use of such courts which grants bail to Hindu terrorists for killing non Hindus? Judiciary giving bail to Hindu terrorists is nothing but a mockery of the beautiful consitution of B.R. Ambedkar. Rajasthan&#8217;s High Court ex judge Justice M.C Sharma talked about so called benefits of cows, what justice can be expected from such Sanghi mindset people sitting on such prestigious positions of judiciary. Communal attacks are perpetrated by criminally minded people so its not shocking but Hindu government denying justice to non Hindu victims is surely disheartening. Hindu government is usually soft on Hindu terrorists. Hindu terrorists and hate mongers are usually felicitated, given high rank positions and if by chance they gets convicted then they are granted bail.<br />

<span id="more-3060"></span><br />
It&#8217;s really unfortunate that many Hindus label entire Muslim community as terrorists but at the same time denies the existence of Hindu terrorism. Many Hindus don&#8217;t even consider RSS, VHP, Bajrang Dal, Ram Sena, Sanatan Sanstha, Dharm Sena to be terrorists let alone condemning them, they consider all these terror groups to be social workers. In this article I shall mention some of the terror activities perpetrated by members of RSS, VHP, Bajrang Dal as many radical Hindus keep asking for proof of their terror activities. <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/india/cia-names-vhp-bajrang-dal-as-religious-militant-organisations-in-world-factbook-5218249/" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">CIA has named VHP, Bajrang Dal as ‘religious militant organisations’ in World Factbook<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. The first terrorist of independent India was Nathuram Gode an alleged RSS leader who killed Mahatma Gandhi, He had close ties with RSS and Hindu Mahasabha members. As a result RSS was banned by Sardar Vallabhai Patel but the ban was lifted after RSS promised Patel that they would be away from Politics and would not contest any elections. So far RSS has been banned thrice, another time when Babri mosque was demolished.<br />
Right wing Hindu terror groups are immune from all criminal laws due to their political backings in fact BJP leaders gets instructions from RSS, and also due to the support it gets from huge right wing Hindu army and because of these things Hindu terror organisations are not banned. RSS, VHP, Bajrang dal has 5 million members each.</p>

Sardar Vallabhai Patel&#8217;s letter to Jawaharlal Nehru<br />
The Sardar&#8217;s reply of September 11, 1948, was terse. While admitting that &#8216;RSS did service to the Hindu society&#8217;, he added, &#8220;The objectionable part arose when they (RSS), burning with revenge, began attacking Mussalmans. All their speeches were full of communal poison … As a final result of that poison, the country had to suffer the sacrifice of Gandhiji … RSS men expressed joy and distributed sweets after Gandhiji&#8217;s death. It became inevitable for the government to take action against the RSS.&#8221;<br />
