<p><strong>VERSE:</strong></p>
<p>There are several mantras in Vedas that called God a fraud (Mayavi). Swami Dayanand suggests that one should use fraud to defeat enemies. So Vedic God is a cheater.</p>
<p><span id="more-692"></span></p>
<p>ऋग्वेद में अनेक जगह इन्द्र को मायी (धोकेबाज़) कहा गया हे. उदाहरण के तोर पर देखिये ऋग्वेद १:११:७</p>
<p>मायाभिरिन्द्र मायिनं तवं शुष्णमवातिरः |<br />
विदुष टे तस्य मेधिरास्तेषां शरवांस्युत तिर ||</p>
<p>“हे इन्द्रदेव ! अपनी माया द्वारा आपने ‘शुषण’ को पराजित किया. जो बुद्धिमान आपकी इस माया को जानते हैं, उन्हें यश और बल देकर वृद्धि प्रदान करें.”</p>
<p>इस मंत्र का भावार्थ स्वामी दयानंद जी इस प्रकार करते हैं.</p>
<p>“बुद्धिमान मनुष्यों को ईश्वर आगया देता है कि- साम, दाम, दंड और भेद की युक्ति से दुष्ट और शत्रु जनों क़ी निवृत्ति करके चक्रवर्ति राज्य क़ी यथावत उन्नति करनी चाहिए’’<br />
पंडित जी, साम, दाम, दंड और भेद को तो आप जानते ही होंगे.<br />
साम : बहलाना फुसलाना<br />
दाम : धन देकर चुप कराना<br />
दंड : यदि बहलाने फुसलाने से न माने तो ताड़ना करना<br />
भेद : फूट डालना</p>
<p>इसके अतिरिक्त ऋग्वेद ४:१६:९ में दयानादं जी नें भी अपने भाष्य में ‘मायावान’ का अनुवाद मक्कार किया है. पंडित जयदेव शर्मा (आर्य समाजी) ने अपने ऋग्वेद भाष्य में ‘मायावान’ का अनुवाद कुटिल मायावी किया है. तो सिद्ध हो गया कि वैदिक ईश्वर मायी अर्थात धोकेबाज़ है.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>FANATITC&#8217;S ANALYSIS:</strong></p>
<p>We are not sure of the source of first translation quoted by the fanatic brigade. But let us review the complete essence provided by Swami Dayanand. It states:</p>
<p>&#8220;बुद्धिमानमनुष्योंकोईश्वरआगयादेताहैकि- साम, दाम, दंडऔरभेदकीयुक्तिसेदुष्टऔरशत्रुजनोंक़ीनिवृत्तिकरकेचक्रवर्तिराज्यक़ीयथावतउन्नतिकरनीचाहिएतथाजैसेइससंसारमेंकपटी, छलीऔरदुष्टपुरुषवृद्धिकोप्राप्तनहो, वैसाउपायनिरंतरकरनाचाहिए</p>
<p>So it is clear that the likes of Osama Bin Laden and perpetrators of genocide be destroyed through all means. To catch a criminal, police is allowed to use fake decoys. All civilized societies allow use of such means to destroy criminals and terrorists. Hitler was captured in his bunker. Osama was eliminated in a night operation. Many a criminals are caught by police through this method. If criminals be allowed to freely use fraud but we do not counter them with Bheda (tact), then soon whole world will be Somalia!</p>
<p>Thankfully such stupid concepts do not appeal to most civilized nations of the world, and hence world is still a sensible place to live!</p>
<p>But to ensure that one does not misinterpret such mantras to justify crookedness in general, <strong>Vedas also clearly specify that all innocent peaceful persons be protected at all costs. For example the 3rd mantra of same Sukta emphasizes that peaceful people be not only protected</strong> but one should also put special efforts to increase their prosperity under all circumstances.</p>
<p>In brief, Vedas recommend exactly what is the ideal benchmark for any civilized country of today.</p>
<p>The translation of Rigveda 4.16.9 as per Dayanand&#8217;s commentary is available on Arya Samaj Jamnagar site. There is not even remotest reference to Supreme Lord being fraud or Makkar or Mayavi as alleged by the fanatics. We also checked 5 other publications but failed to find such an interpretation anywhere.</p>
<p>On contrary, the Mantra asserts that the king should constantly increase prosperity of peaceful noble people and destroy the terrorists who commit fraud and hatred.</p>
<p>The controversial word here is Mayavanabrahma (मायावनब्रह्मा) = Mayavan + Abrahma (मायावान +अब्रह्मा). So instead of calling Brahma as Mayavan (fraud), the mantra calls <strong>Abrahma (or those devoid of intellect or opposite of Brahma) as fraud</strong>. The next word used for them is<strong> Dasyu (दस्यु) making the meaning very clear – Those who use fraud, hate</strong> intellect and perform terrorism should be destroyed.</p>
<p><strong>MY RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>Here is the translation of Rig Veda 1.11.7 by Shri Ram Sharma</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="580" height="82" class="wp-image-7704" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-63.png" alt="http://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/060218_0659_testingresp1.png" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-63.png 580w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-63-300x42.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" /></p>
<p>Pandit Jaydev Sharma translates Maya as crooked/devious wisdom. <img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="470" height="108" class="wp-image-7705" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-64.png" alt="http://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/060218_0659_testingresp2.png" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-64.png 470w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-64-300x69.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" /></p>
<p>Capellar&#8217;s Sanskrit dictionary gives the following meanings</p>
<p>Maya – supernatural or wonderful power, wile, trick, deceit, sorcery, illusion, phantom, unreality (ph.); — being only in appearance, a feigned or phantom –(cf. seq.).</p>
<p>S.V Apte, in his English-Sanskrit Dictionary 3rd edition[1920] in pages 94, 99 and 173 gives the following meanings for the word</p>
<p>Maya/Mayin- Fraud, Fraudelent, Deception, Deceptive, Delusion</p>
<p>Besides Dayanand also gave similar definition to the word Maya, So this suggests that Vedic God Indra is indeed a Fraud. The author writes,</p>
<p>&#8220;<strong> Had fanatic minds known even the basics of Sandhi (rules of joining of words) in Hindi or Sanskrit, they would not have committed such a blunder</strong>&#8221;</p>
<p>Is he acknowledging the fact that Arya Samaj scholars are fanatics? Because the word Mayavan in Rig Veda 4.16.9 is translated by Pandit Jaydev Sharma (Arya Samaj) as Kutil Mayavi. The writer is juggling so much, Mushafiq Sultan gave reference to Rig Veda 4.16.9 only to show that the word Mayavi or Maya is translated by Dayanand as crooked wisdom, here is what Dayanand translated,</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="172" height="30" class="wp-image-7706" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-65.png" alt="http://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/060218_0659_testingresp3.png" /></p>
<p>Finally the writer has accepted that the word Mayavi means Fraud, he should once again read Rig Veda 1.11.7 which calls Indra as Mayavi. He is not able to explain the main verse Rig Veda 1.11.7 which clearly calls Indra as Fraud, this is why he has skipped that verse and jumping to Rig Veda 4.16.9. Read the article <a href="/index.php/2015/06/25/hindu-god-is-a-cheat/" data-wpel-link="internal">Hindu god is a cheater</a> for more information. The writer is giving his personal definition to the words. As for the word Abraha, he is mistranslated it also. He also writes &#8220;<strong> For example the 3rd mantra of same Sukta emphasizes that peaceful people be not only protected</strong> but one should also put special efforts to increase their prosperity under all circumstances&#8221;</p>
<p>This verse is also mistranslated by the writer, the verse is</p>
<p>Rig Veda 4.16.3 When the Bull, quaffing, praises our Iibation, as a sage paying holy rites in secret, Seven singers here from heaven hath he begotten, who e&#8217;en by day have wrought their works while singing.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="601" height="133" class="wp-image-7707" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-66.png" alt="http://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/060218_0659_testingresp4.png" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-66.png 601w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-66-300x66.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 601px) 100vw, 601px" /></p>
<p>He is misinterpreting Mulshankar&#8217;s words also, he translated Bhed as Tact, correct definition would be Polarizing or Dividing. He is forging Dayanand&#8217;s commentary by mixing all his lines, let&#8217;s read once more what Dayanand wrote,</p>
<p>बुद्धिमान मनुष्यों को ईश्वर आगया देता है कि- साम, दाम, दंड और भेद की युक्ति से दुष्ट<br />
<strong>और </strong>शत्रु जनों क़ी निवृत्ति करके चक्रवर्ति राज्य क़ी यथावत उन्नति करनी चाहिए&#8221;</p>
<p>Dayanand has divided the words Dusht and Shatru (Enemy) by adding the word Aur (And), that means you have to use those tricks like corrupting, Polarizing, Luring and beating not just on Dusht but also on your Enemies. Here the word Dusht doesn&#8217;t mean wicked as usually spoken, but in Vedas the wicked is the one who rejects Vedas, Dayanand in Rig Veda 4.16.9 translated Dasyu as Dusht.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="246" height="38" class="wp-image-7708" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-67.png" alt="http://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/060218_0659_testingresp5.png" /></p>
<p>It is already established that all the people living outside Aryavrata or those who doesn&#8217;t follow Vedas are Dasyus. And Sam, Dam, Bhed are meaningless when dealing with terrorists because terrorists deserve only punishment, then why does it say to lure with money if its about dealing with terrorist? Can Vedas be word of god which tells to Polarize, Corrupt, Lure or beat your enemies? The word of God never teaches such evil things, Messengers gave an example by forgiving their staunch enemies, If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, you should turn to them your other cheek also.</p>
<p><strong>VERSE:</strong></p>
<p>Vedas provide no option of divorce for women and force them to tolerate the husband regardless of his deeds. Its the Hindu Law that allows divorce rights to women.</p>
<p>हिन्दू विवाह अधिनियम,१९५५ के अनुसार विशेष स्थितियों में, यथा दुष्ट स्वभाव, मूर्ख, व्यभिचारी, नामर्द होने पर स्त्री अपने पति को तलाक़ दे सकती है. लेकिन हिन्दू धर्म में तलाक़ का कोई प्रावधान नहीं है. पति चाहे दुष्ट स्वभाव वाला, मूर्ख, और रोगी हो तब भी स्त्री नहीं छोड़ सकती. उसे अपने ही पति के साथ जीना और मरना है.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>FANATIC&#8217;S ANALYSIS:</strong></p>
<p>If divorce is so much against Hinduism, what made Hindus themselves adopt such a law for themselves? As per Hindu law, a woman need not seek permission from husband for divorce. But as per Islamic Laws, a women can opt only for Khula – request for divorce. The husband may or may not accept it. His decision is final. Countries like Saudi Arab have stopped Khula since several years and hence women there have no options.</p>
<p>Kindly cite one single mantra from Vedas that asserts that woman cannot leave her husband under any circumstance</p>
<p><strong>MY RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>The writer is only showing his insecurity by mocking other religions without clarifying the question. Hindu law is created by the Government of India, as far as the Hindu scripture is concerned there is not a single verse which allows a woman to divorce. This is why the writer has not quoted any verse and behaving like a frustrated kid. Maharishi Manu clearly wrote,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 9.65 In the sacred texts which refer to marriage the appointment (of widows) is nowhere mentioned, nor is the remarriage of widows prescribed in the rules concerning marriage.</p>
<p>Dayanand Saraswati also did not prescribe widow remarriage, He preferred Niyoga as alternative, So it is clear that Hindu scripture do not support women remarriage.The most authentic Smriti of Arya Samaj states (which the writer hasn&#8217;t quoted),</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 5.154. Though destitute of virtue, or seeking pleasure (elsewhere), or devoid of good qualities, (yet) a husband must be constantly worshipped as a god by a faithful wife.</p>
<p>Read the article <a href="/index.php/2014/05/01/is-widow-remarriage-permitted-in-hinduism/" data-wpel-link="internal">Is widow remarriage permitted in Hinduism</a>? for more information. Can he provide any evidence to show that Saudi government has stopped Khula? The Hadith mentioned in <a href="http://hadithcollection.com/sahihbukhari/96-Sahih%20Bukhari%20Book%2063.%20Divorce/5897-sahih-bukhari-volume-007-book-063-hadith-number-197.html" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Sahih Bukhari, book Divorce 63, hadith no 197<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> states that wife of Thabit Bin Qais took Khula without any hassle. If the Husband is not willing to divorce then the Arbitrary committee or Judicial/Sharia court will enforce the divorce which is evident from the same chapter <a href="http://hadithcollection.com/sahihbukhari/96-Sahih%20Bukhari%20Book%2063.%20Divorce/5896-sahih-bukhari-volume-007-book-063-hadith-number-198.html" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Hadith no 198 of Sahih Bukhari<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. Also read Sunan Abu Dawud, book 11, Hadis 2091 which clearly enables a woman to exercise her choice.</p>
<p><strong>VERSE:</strong></p>
<p>“धर्म के द्वेषी शत्रुओं को निरंतर जलाइए. नीची दशा में करके सूखे काठ के समान जलाइए.” [यजुर्वेद १३/१२]
<p>स्वामी दयानंद सरस्वती ऋग्वेद १/७/४ के भावार्थ में लिखते हैं</p>
<p>“परमेश्वर का यह स्वभाव है कि युद्ध करने वाले धर्मात्मा पुरुषों पर अपनी कृपा करता है और आलसियों पर नहीं. जो मनुष्य जितेन्द्रिय विद्वान आलस्य को छोड़े हुए बड़े बड़े युद्धों को जीत के प्रजा को निरंतर पालन करते हैं, वो ही महाभाग्य को प्राप्त होके सुखी रहते हैं.”</p>
<p><strong>FANATIC&#8217;S ANALYSIS:</strong></p>
<p>Yet another foolish allegation. It has been made amply clear as what is Dharma and whom does Vedas extol to fight against. The Vedic message is that Ahimsa Paramo Dharmah – Non-violence is the greatest religion. Refer Chapter 2 of Upadesh Manjari by same Swami Dayanand Saraswati who is being quoted.</p>
<p>So those who are terrorists are enemies of Dharma and deserve to be destroyed with iron hand. And those who do not do so bring miseries to themselves and their nation. If what USA did against Osama Bin Laden or what India did against Pakistan in Indo-Pak wars or what Shivaji did against Afzal Khan and Aurangzeb or NSG heroes did against terrorists in Taj Mumbai is indeed wrong, then yes Vedas do urge us to not sit idle and indulge in such wrongs. The only condition (as mentioned before) is that no innocent/ peaceful person should be made a victim. But of course, fanatics like Al Qaeda would hate to accept that others shall also resist their terror attacks with iron hand!</p>
<p><strong>MY RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>Why is he talking about terrorists so much? Is he forcing the Oxford University Press to change the definition of Terrorist as &#8216;those who do not follow Vedas&#8217;?</p>
<p>However, here is another translation of Arya Samaj</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 13.12 &#8220;O king, make progress in thy duty of administration, extend happiness to the virtuous. O terrible chastiser, burn down the irreligious foes. O splendid person, humiliate and consume utterly like dried up stubble, him, who encourages our foe.&#8221; Tr. Devi Chand</p>
<p>Hinduism was not even a religion before the advent of other religions, it was the monopoly of high caste Brahmins who could introduce new verses to satisfy their whims. Just as slaughtering animal in Yajna is non violence similarly slaying disbelievers is also non violence and duty of the Vedic followers. Read the article <a href="/index.php/2014/05/15/killing-infidels-in-vedas/" data-wpel-link="internal">Killing Infidels in Vedas</a> to see the violent passages of Vedas. Yajur Veda 13.12 clearly states about killing disbelievers, but the writer won&#8217;t digest this truth due to his extreme hypocrisy. He considers Shivaji the plunderer as freedom fighter. Should I remind him of Shivaji&#8217;s Surat loot?</p>
<p><strong>VERSE:</strong></p>
<p>आर्य समाज का यह दावा कि वेद ईश्वर् की वाणी है, या एक इल्हामी ग्रन्थ है, पूरी तरह से गलत है. वेदों का अध्यन करने से पता चलता है कि वे ऋषियों द्वारा बनाये गए हैं. इस विषय का पूरा विवरण करना यहाँ संभव नहीं है, लेकिन में कुछ प्रमाण आपके सामने प्रस्तुत करता हूँ-<br />
तैतीरीय ब्रह्मण २/८/८/५ में लिखा है “बुद्धिमान ऋषि मन्त्रों के बनाने वाले हैं.”<br />
इसके अतिरिक्त इस बात के स्पष्ट प्रमाण मिलते हैं समयसमय पर वेदों के नए नए मंत्र बनते रहे रहे हैं और वे पहले बने संग्रहों (संहिताओं अथवा वेदों) में मिलाये जाते रहे हैं. खुद वेदों में ही इस बात के प्रमाण मिलते हैं-</p>
<p>१. ऋग्वेद १/१०९/२<br />
अथा सोमस्य परयती युवभ्यामिन्द्राग्नी सतोमं जनयामि नव्यम ||<br />
अर्थात “हे इन्द्र और अग्नि, तुम्हारे सोम्प्रदानकाल में पठनीय एक नया स्तोत्र रचता हूँ.”<br />
२. ऋग्वेद ४/१६/२१ अकारि ते हरिवो बरह्म नव्यं धिया अर्थात “हे हरि विशिष्ठ इन्द्र, हम तुम्हारे लिए नए स्तोत्र बनाते हैं.</p>
<p>३. ऋग्वेद ७/२२/९<br />
ये च पूर्व रषयो ये च नूत्ना इन्द्र बरह्माणि जनयन्त विप्राः |</p>
<p>अर्थात “हे इन्द्रदेव, प्राचीन एवं नवीन ऋषियों द्वारा रचे गए स्तोत्रों से स्तुत्य होकर आपने जिस प्रकार उनका कल्याण किया, वैसे ही हम स्तोताओं का मित्रवत कल्याण करें.”</p>
<p>स्पष्ट है कि इन नए स्तोत्रों व मन्त्रों के रचयित साधारण मानव थे, जिन्होंने पूर्वजों द्वारा रचे मन्त्रों के खो जाने पर या उनके अप्रभावकारी सिद्ध हों पर या उन्हें परिष्कृत करने या अपनी नयी रचना रचने के उद्देश से समयसमय पर नए मंत्र रचे.</p>
<p>इसलिए वेद सर्वज्ञ परमात्मा की रचना सिद्ध नहीं होते.</p>
<p><strong>FANATIC&#8217;S RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>It hardly matters if someone believes Vedas to be divine or not. Because Vedic God will not put him in Hell for blasphemy nor promise a paradise full of harlots for obedience. The Vedic Law of Karma is much more robust, comprehensive, just and rigorous.</p>
<p><strong>MY RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>Arya Samajis usually resort to mocking other religions when they fail to explain Vedas. Vedas are not the words of God, it&#8217;s a fact which may be extremely hard to digest, you can find more information in this article written by Mushafiq <a href="/index.php/2014/01/02/textual-corruption-of-the-vedas/" data-wpel-link="internal">Textual Corruption in Vedas</a>.</p>
<p>Even Hindu scholars believe that Vedas are corrupted so there is not use to follow it, read the article <a href="/index.php/2014/05/14/hindu-scriptures-battle-of-supremacy/" data-wpel-link="internal">Hindu scriptures battle of supremacy</a> written by Hindu scholar Swami B.V. Giri. By the way which version of Veda is the writer following? Vedas award death penalty for Blasphemy,</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 12.2.23 He who dwells fixed in the atmosphere, smiting the blasphemers of the god that do not sacrifice to him be reverence with ten Sakvari-stanzas.</p>

<p>The writer should thoroughly study his Vedas, he is unaware of the Apsara (nymph) concept, Illicit relation with widow besides women and prostitutes are created for lust and sex as per the Yajur Vedas. So instead of using such derogatory words against other religions he should check it first with his Vedas. I recommend him reading the article <a href="/index.php/2014/01/02/vedic-paradise-an-overview-3/" data-wpel-link="internal">Vedic Paradise: An Overview</a></p>
<p><strong>VERSE:</strong></p>
<p>विश्व के धर्मों में हिन्दू धर्म ही एक ऐसा धर्म है जिस में सामाजिक भेद-भाव के बीज शुरू से ही विद्यमान रहे हैं. हिन्दू धर्म सामाजिक भेद भाव को न केवल धर्म द्वारा अनुमोदित करता है, बल्कि इस धर्म का प्रारंभ ही भेद भाव के पाठ से होता है. हिन्दू धर्म ने शुरू से ही मानव मानव के बीच भेद किया. ऋग्वेद के पुरुषसूक्त ने स्पष्ट कहा कि “ब्राह्मण परमात्मा के मुख से, क्षत्रिय उस कि भुजाओं से, वैश्य उस के उरू से तथा शूद्र उस के पैरों से पैदा हुए.”<br />
बराह्मणो.अस्य मुखमासीद बाहू राजन्यः कर्तः |<br />
ऊरूतदस्य यद वैश्यः पद्भ्यां शूद्रो अजायत ||<br />
[ऋग्वेद १०/९०/१२]
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>FANATIC&#8217;S ANALYSIS:</strong></p>
<p>If there is one text in the world that talks of pure meritocracy, it is the Vedas. But those on gun-point have no option but to keep abusing Vedas regardless of facts.</p>
<p>The current Manu Smriti is an adulterated literature</p>
<p>On contrary, if we look at available translations of scriptures like Bible and Quran, they smell of racism and hatred against non-believers. They call for special tax on non-believers and condemn them to eternal Hell.</p>
<p>They call for special tax on non-believers and condemn them to eternal Hell. Many enlightened Christians and Muslims are thus attempting to reinterpret these texts but they are termed as apostates by the fanatics. Sir Syed Ahmad Khan, founder of Aligarh Muslim University, was decreed a fatwa of death for his liberal views on these issues. Galileo was imprisoned for proving that earth is round and sun does not move around earth!</p>
<p><strong>MY RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>There is no need to say which scripture preaches hatred, it is clearly seen from the behavior of Arya Samajis and their incapability in explaining the violent and barbaric Vedic verses, and it is Arya Samaji who is reinterpreting the scriptures. This writer who claims to be a Arya Samaji is defying his guru Dayanand Saraswati according to whom Manu Smriti was alone authentic Smriti (pg 148 Satyarth Prakash), Dayanand used more than 200 verses from Manu Smriti in his book Satyarth Prakash. Have a look at the words used by Dayayand Saraswati against other religions,</p>
<p>&#8221;What a nice trap have the Jainees set to attract fools who would like nothing better than to be placed in the way of attaining salvation without having to do (righteous) deeds. We do not think that there exists a religion more idiotic than this.&#8221;- Satyarth Prakash, by Dayanand Saraswati, page 559, Tr. Chiranjiva Bhardwaja.</p>
<p>These people [Buddhists] have come to believe in such stupid things by rejecting the Veda and God.&#8221;- Satyarth Prakash, by Dayanand Saraswati, page 517-18, Tr. Chiranjiva Bhardwaja.</p>
<p>God of other religions does not command to kill people just because they make no offerings to him. Moreover Arya Samaj is criticized by many Hindus for its fundamentalism which is evident from their bible of hate called Satyarth Prakash and the attitude of Arya Samajis which is much worse than savages.</p>
<p>&#8220;in this Age of Kali a community has sprung up known as the Arya Samaj, who members are ignorant of the import of the Vedas in the paramparā system. They decry all bona fide ācāryas and pose themselves as the real followers of the Vedic principles, but in fact such non-Āryans do not follow the Vedic principles.&#8221;- A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada (ISKON) [<a href="http://vedabase.com/en/sb/5/15/1" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Source<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>]
<p>The Arya Samajis can go to any extent of hypocrisy, They proudly promote their hatred but physically attack others when their beliefs and ideologies are exposed, here is an example <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/3-killed-100-injured-in-Rohtak-ashram-clash/articleshow/20020428.cms" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/3-killed-100-injured-in-Rohtak-ashram-clash/articleshow/20020428.cms<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p><strong>VERSE:</strong></p>
<p>सृष्टि के आरम्भ में मनुष्यों के जवान जवान टपक जाने के अतिरिक्त कई और चमतारिक घटनाओं का विवरण वेदों में मिलता है. उदाहरण के लिए देखिये-<br />
१. ऋग्वेद ३/३३/५ में विश्वामित्र जी ने मंत्र पढ़ कर सतलुज और ब्यास नदियों को खड़ा कर दिया था. सुनिए-<br />
रमध्वं मे वचसे सोम्याय रतावरीरुप मुहूर्तमेवैः |<br />
पर सिन्धुमछा बर्हती मनीषावस्युरह्वे कुशिकस्य सूनुः ||</p>
<p>अर्थात “हे जलवती नदियों, आप हमारे नम्र और मधुर वचनों को सुन कर अपनी गति को एक क्षण के लिए विराम दे दें. हम कुशक पुत्र अपनी रक्षा के लिए महती स्तुतियों द्वारा आप नदियों का भली प्रकार सम्मान करते हैं.”</p>
<p>निरुक्त २/२४ से २६ में इस मंत्र का स्पष्ट अर्थ बताया गया है. अब ऋग्वेद के इस मंत्र में आपके लिए दो प्रश्न हैं. यहाँ, ऋषि विश्वामित्र सीधे सीधे नदियों को संबोधित कर रहे हैं, नदियों से बातें कर रहे हैं. इस को आप क्या कहें गे? और केवल ऋषि विश्वामित्र के मंत्र जपने से ही वे नदियाँ कैसे ठहर गयीं.</p>
<p>२. ऋग्वेद ४/१९/९ के अनुसार दीमक द्वारा खाए गए कुँवारी के बेटे को इन्द्र ने फिर से जीवित किया और सारे अंगों को इकट्ठे करदिया.<br />
वम्रीभिः पुत्रम अग्रुवो अदानं निवेशनाद धरिव आ जभर्थ |<br />
वय अन्धो अख्यद अहिम आददानो निर भूद उखछित सम अरन्त पर्व ||</p>
<p>अर्थात “हे इन्द्रदेव, आपने दीमकों द्वारा भक्ष्यमान ‘अग्रु के पुत्र को उनके स्थान (बिल) से बाहर निकाला. बाहर निकाले जाते समय अंधे ‘अग्रु’-पुत्र ने आहि (सर्प) को भली प्रकार देखा. उसके बाद चींटियों द्वारा काटे गए अंगों को आपने (इन्द्रदेव ने) संयुक्त किया (जोड़ा).”</p>
<p>३. ऋग्वेद ४/१८/२ में वामदेव ऋषि ने मां के पेट में से इन्द्रदेव से बात की-<br />
नाहम अतो निर अया दुर्गहैतत तिरश्चता पार्श्वान निर गमाणि |<br />
बहूनि मे अक्र्ता कर्त्वानि युध्यै तवेन सं तवेन पर्छै ||</p>
<p>अर्थात वामदेव कहते हैं, “हम इस योनिमार्ग द्वारा नहीं निर्गत होंगे. यह मार्ग अत्यंत दुर्गम है. हम बगल के मार्ग से निकलेंगे. अन्यों के द्वारा करने योग्य अनेकों कार्य हमें करने हैं. हमें एक साथ युद्ध करना है, तथा एक के साथ वाद-विवाद करना है.”</p>
<p>४. अथर्ववेद ४/५/६-७ चोर के लिए ऐसे मंत्र हैं जिनको जपने से घर के सारे सदस्य सो जाते हैं और चोर बड़े आराम से चोरी कर सकता है.</p>
<p>स्वप्तु माता स्वप्तु पिता स्वप्तु क्ष्वा स्वप्तु विश्पतिः |<br />
स्वपन्त्वस्यै ज्ञातयः स्वपत्वयमभितो जनः ||<br />
स्वप्न स्वप्नाभिकरणेन सर्वं नि ष्वापया जनम |<br />
ओत्सूर्यमन्यान्त्स्वापयाव्युषं जागृतादहमिन्द्र इवारिष्टो अक्षितः ||</p>
<p>अर्थात “माँ सो जाए, पिता सो जाए, कुत्ता सो जाए, घर का स्वामी सो जाए, सभी बांधव एवं परिकर के सब लोग सो जाएं. हे स्वप्न के अधिष्ठाता देव, स्वप्न के साधनों द्वारा आप समस्त लोगों को सुला दें तथा अन्य लोगों को सूर्योदय तक निद्रित रखें. इस प्रकार सबके सो जाने पर हम इन्द्र के सामान, अहिंसित तथा क्षयरहित होकर प्रातःकाल तक जागते रहे.”</p>
<p><strong>FANATIC&#8217;S ANALYSIS:</strong></p>
<p>Readers are advised to refer to any relevant source for actual meanings as provided by Swami Dayanand. Of course there can be alternate meanings as well, but you would have to work really hard to lower your intellect in order to discover stupid miracles in a scientific text like Vedas.</p>
<p>Rigveda 3.33.5: Just as wide rivers full of water reach their goal by meeting with ocean, similarly intellectual pursuits bring peace and happiness to those willing to be followers of intelligence.</p>
<p>Rigveda 4.19.9: Just as rivers emerging from mountains acquire the lands of the plains, similarly the king should snatch away property rights of a son who does not believe in charity. In all situations, king should work for prosperity of the subject.</p>
<p>Rigveda 4.18.2 O Lord, may I not come through the way of womb which is very painful. May I do such actions that I need not take this path again and I get free from cycle of death and birth. I shall put my best efforts for this.</p>
<p>Atharvaveda 4.5.6-7 Which fool said that this contains a mantra to recite so that thieves sleep? It simply states that everyone should have a peaceful sleep in night. However the guard should keep vigil till others get awake.</p>
<p>This mantra says that guards should not sleep in night and soldiers at borders with fanatic country should also keep vigil.</p>
<p><strong>MY RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>The writer is behaving like a hypocrite now. He is begging to use authentic source, I wonder why didn&#8217;t he use Arya Samaj translation for Yajur 13.12, Atharva Veda 12.5.62, 20.93.1 etc.,? The translation of Rig Veda 3.33.5 is grossly incorrect, let me quote the translation from a Arya Samaji,</p>
<p>&#8220;[The sage speaks] I, the disciple of an enlightened teacher, having acquired necessary knowledge, now desirous of protection, solicit your favour and address with earnest prayer to you the rivers before me. O rivers, charged with water, rest a moment from your course at my request.&#8221;- Rig Veda 3.33.5, Tr. SatyaPrakash Saraswati, p.1175, Vol 4.</p>
<p>Yaska Acharya writes: &#8220;The seer Visvamitra was the domestic priest of Sudas, the son of Pijavana. Visva-mitra, friend of all…He, i.e. Visvamitra, implored the rivers to become fordable. (He addressed them) in the dual as well as in the plural number.&#8221;- Nirukta 2.24</p>
<p>It is further mentioned,</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop your courses for a moment, ye great floods, at my friendly bidding. I, the son of Kusika, and desirous of protection, invoke the river with a sublime hymn.[Rig Veda 3.33.5]…I call upon the river with a great…&#8221;- Nirukta 2.23</p>
<p>The question is that, in this verse Viswamitra is speaking to rivers moreover does rivers stop flowing just by his command? The writer has failed to answer this question and making vulgar remarks on other religions (which I have not mentioned here).</p>
<p>Rig Veda 4.19.9 Lord of Bay Steeds [Indra], thou broughtest from the ant-hill the unwedded damsel&#8217;s son whom ants were eating. The blind saw clearly, as he grasped the serpent, rose, brake the jar his joints again united.</p>

<p>Rig Veda 4.18.2 Not [from this womb] this way go I forth: hard is the passage. Forth from the side obliquely will I issue. Much that is yet undone must I accomplish; one must I combat and the other question.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="519" height="132" class="wp-image-7711" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-70.png" alt="http://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/060218_0659_testingresp8.png" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-70.png 519w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-70-300x76.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 519px) 100vw, 519px" /></p>
<p>It would be good if the writer gives the explanation of Atharva Veda 4.5.6-7 from Nirukta or other early commentaries.</p>
<p><strong>VERSE:</strong></p>
<p>यदि अग्नि ऋषि को, आप के अनुसार, ईश्वर ने ऋग्वेद दिया तो आदित्य ऋषि को सामवेद क्यूँ दिया? क्या ऋग्वेद में कोई कमी रह गयी थी जो सामवेद देना पड़ा? सामवेद तो ऋग्वेद मंडल ९ की पूरी नक़ल है. सिवाय ७५ मन्त्रों के जो नए हैं, सामवेद के १८०० मंत्र ऋग्वेद में पहले से हैं. ये ७५ मंत्र भी अग्नि को क्यों नहीं दिए? यदि ये कहा जाए कि सामवेद के मंत्र गाने के लिए अलग किये गए हैं तो ऋग्वेद में लिखा जा सकता था कि मंडल ९ को गा लिया करो. इसके अतिरिक्त यजुर्वेद और अथर्ववेद भी व्यर्थ हैं जिन में एक बड़ा हिस्सा ऋग्वेद से लिया गया है. क्या अग्नि ऋषि को ऋग्वेद देते समय आपके ईश्वर भूल गए थे कि उसे सामवेद, यजुर्वेद और अथर्ववेद भी देना है?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>FANATIC&#8217;S ANALYSIS:</strong></p>
<p>The 4 Vedas have 4 different themes. Rigveda is analytical and focuses on knowledge. Yajurveda is practical and focuses on actions. Samaveda is devotional and focuses on emotional intelligence. Atharvaveda is implementation-oriented. All 4 require different faculties and hence provided to different Rishis. Overlap of mantras does not mean anything. The same sentence indifferent contexts bring out different meanings. Further with different tones, meaning changes completely.</p>
<p>Only fools will claim that all duplicate sentences and equations from any text book be removed!</p>
<p><strong>MY RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>Most of the verses and hymns of Sama Veda are taken from Rig Veda, So why were Sama Veda&#8217;s (Emotional intelligence) passages taken from Rig Veda (focuses on knowledge )? Was Ishwar confused as where to add the emotional or knowledge verses so he mixed them in both books? Furthermore, several Rig Veda and Atharva Veda verses are also same. What was the necessity of adding it in Atharva Veda when it was already present in Rig Veda? Can the writer give some examples from the repetitive verses which has completely different meaning?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not possible to quote all the repetitive verses, so I will quote few, The entire hymn of Atharva Veda 20.5 which has total number of 7 verses are taken from Rig Veda 8.17.7-13. Atharva Veda 20.45 the entire hymn which has 3 verses is taken from Rig Veda 1.30.4-6.</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 20.95 has 4 verses out of which 3 verses are taken from Rig Veda 10.133.1-3, Did Ishwar forgot to add the first verse of Atharva Veda 20.95 in the  Rig Veda that he later rectified it?</p>
<p>Sama Veda book 1, chapter 1, 3 Soma Pavamana has total 3 verses which are taken from Rig Veda 9.66.10-12. There are numerous repetitive hymns and verses and all of them delivers the same meaning.</p>
<p><strong>VERSE:</strong></p>
<p>ऋग्वेद में आता है कि मित्र और वरुण देवता उर्वशी नामक अप्सरा को देख कर कामपीडित हुए. उन का वीर्य स्खलित हो गया, जिसे उन्होंने यज्ञ कलश में दाल दिया. उसी कलश से अगस्त्य और वसिष्ठ उत्पन्न हुए:</p>
<p>उतासि मैत्रावरुणो वसिष्ठोर्वश्या बरह्मन मनसो.अधि जातः |<br />
दरप्सं सकन्नं बरह्मणा दैव्येन विश्वे देवाः पुष्करे तवाददन्त ||<br />
स परकेत उभयस्य परविद्वान सहस्रदान उत वा सदानः |<br />
यमेन ततं परिधिं वयिष्यन्नप्सरसः परि जज्ञे वसिष्ठः ||<br />
सत्रे ह जाताविषिता नमोभिः कुम्भे रेतः सिषिचतुः समानम |<br />
ततो ह मान उदियाय मध्यात ततो जातं रषिमाहुर्वसिष्ठम ||</p>
<p>– ऋग्वेद ७/३३/११-१३</p>
<p>अर्थात “हे वसिष्ठ, तुम मित्र और वरुण के पुत्र हो. हे ब्रह्मण, तुम उर्वशी के मन से उत्पन्न हो. उस समय मित्र और वरुण का वीर्य स्खलन हुआ था. विश्वादेवगन ने दैव्य स्तोत्र द्वारा पुष्कर के बीच तुम्हें धारण किया था. यज्ञ में दीक्षित मित्र और वरुण ने स्तुति द्वारा प्रार्थित हो कर कुंभ के बीच एकसाथ ही रेत (वीर्य) स्खलन किया था. अनंतर मान (अगस्त्य)उत्पन्न हुए. लोग कहते हैं कि ऋषि वसिष्ठ उसी कुंभ से जन्मे थे.”</p>
<p><strong>FANATIC&#8217;S ANALYSIS:</strong></p>
<p>Another bogus claim. When Vedas contain no history, it is in vain to discover historical persons in Vedas. By that logic, Nayak in Vedas refer to Zakir Naik and Rahman in Quran refers to Dayanand! Further, what happened to love for translation by Swami Dayanand? One can refer his translation and see that</p>
<p>Vasishtha refers to scholar</p>
<p>Mitra-Varun to bipolar forces (in this case Prana and Udana or exhalation and inhalation)</p>
<p>Urvashi – special knowledge</p>
<p>The first mantra states that those who attempt to control their breathing through Pranayam and pursue knowledge with full enthusiasm obtain extreme bliss. Second mantra states that first birth happens through parents. But one who takes second birth through education achieves true bliss and glory. In reality, there is not one single evidence so far that Vedas have anything except rationality, justice, morality and inspiring lessons for entire humankind. Vedas belong to entire humanity and hence all rational minds should explore Vedas to seek amazing lessons for life instead of hating them due to a general hatred against non-believers. Hatred leads to miseries. May we all revive the spirit of Vedas in entire humanity and strengthen our foundations.</p>
<p><strong>MY RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>Yaska Acharya writes on this verse,</p>
<p>Nirukta 5.13-14 &#8220;Urvashi is (the name of) a naiad, (so called because) she pervades wide regions (uru + as- to pervade &#8216;), or she pervades by means of thighs [Sexual Intercourse] …On seeing her, the seminal fluid of Mitra and Varuna fell down…O Vasistha,thou art certainly the son of Mitra and Varuna. Brahman, O Brahman, thou wert born from the mind of Urvasi. (Thou art) the drop that fellin divine fervour.&#8221;</p>
<p>Does it need any additional explanation? This shows how Mayavi (Vedic fraud) the writer is. He misinterpreted Vedic verses, Dayanand&#8217;s translation and commentary, and even Nirukta. But our Hindu brothers doesn&#8217;t seem to care about it, they only deliver compliments without even understanding what this guy wrote. I pray that this writer should become capable of digesting the truth, May his hypocrisy vanish so that he may understand the right path.</p>

<p>Other religious books are seen as terror manual by some hate mongers. These hate mongers deliberately misinterpret other scriptures. They claim that only Vedas preach non Violence, religious tolerance and that it doesn&#8217;t command to kill those who reject Hinduism. This article is a response to those Hindus who have come up with weak rebuttal.  Now let&#8217;s start reading the pathetic rebuttal of the apologist on Rig Veda 3.53.14</p>
<p><span id="more-681"></span></p>
<p><strong>VERSE:</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Among the Kikatas what do thy cattle? They pour no milky draught, they heat no caldron. Bring thou to us the wealth of Pramaganda; give up to us, O Maghavan, the low-born.&#8221; Rig Veda 3.53.14</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="453" height="241" class="wp-image-7682" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-45.png" alt="http://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/060218_0658_testingresp1.png" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-45.png 453w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-45-300x160.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 453px) 100vw, 453px" /></p>
<p><strong>FANATIC&#8217;S ANALYSIS</strong>:</p>
<p>When it has been clearly established that Anarya means terrorist and the &#8216;allegators&#8217; have themselves given reference from Nirukta and Swami Dayanand (I am not sure of later source), where is the confusion?</p>
<p>The mantras prays that Cows that give milk and sources of prosperity have no utility in places where terrorists thrive. They be better put to use for prosperity of noble people.</p>
<p>In other words, if Al-Qaeda or Maoists have lots of weapons and wealth, these better come to peaceful people than stay with them. This means that the country should adopt policies that ensure that wealth goes to deserving people and not criminals and terrorists. It is on basis of such mantra that all civilized nations put strict control and security on distribution of currency and critical resources.</p>
<p>Vedas also have prayers that call for reformation of terrorists into civilized beings. Refer Rigveda 6.22.10 that states that &#8216;Daas should be made &#8216;Arya&#8217;. How could it be possible if these were to denote races or specific geographies?</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>Even a thief can justify his theft with this logic saying that &#8220;Since he wasn&#8217;t utilizing his stuff properly so I stole it to make optimum utilization&#8221;.</p>
<p>On what basis has the writer come to the conclusion that Anarya means terrorist? although as per their definition any person who does not follow the Veda is wicked, Demon, Barbarous, Violent terrorist. But he is suppose to quote the reference. Let&#8217;s have a look at the meaning of Anarya given by Dayanand Saraswati first,</p>
<p>&#8220;The Dwijaas( the twice-born) – Braahmanaas, Kshatriyas, Vaishyaas are called Aryas, while the Shudras are called Anaryas, or Non-Aryas.&#8221;ATHARVA VEDA 19:62…&#8221; Satyarth Prakash, by Dayanand Saraswati, page 266, Tr. Chiranjiva Bhardwaja.</p>
<p>Dayanand also writes that all people living outside Aryavarta are Demons and Barbarians. During the Vedic period the inhabitants of Aryavrata (present day India) were mostly Vedic followers, this is why Dayanand wrote that all people living outside Aryavrata are demons (Rakshasha, Dasyu). V.S Apte gives the following meaning for Dasyu</p>
<p>&#8220;Dasyu – name of a class of evil beings or demons; an outcast; a thief; a villain; a desperado&#8221; Sanskrit English Dictionary page 366</p>
<p>In short, anyone who doesn&#8217;t follow the Vedas including poor Shudras are Barbaric (Malechha), Demons (Dasyus, Rakshasha) and Anarya (Non-Aryans). Now let&#8217;s move on to some more authoritative texts. The writer quotes no reference that Anarya means terrorist, However let&#8217;s look at what Yaska Acharya writes on Rig Veda 3.53.14,</p>
<p>Nirukta 6.32 What are the cows doing in Kikata? Kikata is the name of a country where the non-Aryans dwell. Non-Aryan tribes are (so called because it is said),&#8217;What have they done? Or their assumption is that religious rites are useless. They neither get the milk to mix with the soma, nor kindle fire.</p>
<p>So those poor people of Kikata tribe were looted not because they were &#8220;terrorist&#8221; as the writer (who is a extremist himself) says but as the Vedas commands to kill the person who doesn&#8217;t bring offerings to Ishwar, It is mentioned in Vedas,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.176.4 Slay everyone who pours no gift, who, hard to reach, delights thee not. Bestow on us what wealth he hath: this even the worshipper awaits.</p>

<p>Atharva Veda 20.93.1 May our hymns give you great delight. Display your bounty, Thudered. Drive off [kill] the enemies of the Vedas.</p>
<p><strong>FANATIC&#8217;S ANALYSIS:</strong></p>
<p>The controversial phrase is ब्रह्मद्विष्: अवजहि</p>
<p>So it calls for destruction of hatred against Brahma and NOT any Vedic text hater. Brahma is a more subtle concept and refers to the source behind entire creation and hence the feeling that all human beings are equal. It also refers to pure intelligence. So the mantra calls for destruction of those forces that attempt to harm the scholars or sources of intelligence. In other words, those who want to bomb our schools, centers of excellence, intelligence departments or attempt to harm our intelligent masses should be destroyed just as we destroyed Osama Bin Laden and Talibanis. Also the mantra does not say that people should be destroyed specifically. It says that the very forces including systems and processes – that attempt to thwart free intellectual pursuits should be destroyed. Because only through freedom of introspection and enhancement of knowledge can one seek happiness for self and society.</p>

<p>&#8220;Brahmadivsh = Those who oppose Veda and Ishwar&#8221;</p>
[Rig Veda Hindi translation, Mandala 2, page 323]
<p>Many other Arya Samaji scholars have also translated it as &#8220;Those who reject Veda&#8221;, Swami Prabhupada translates it as &#8216;those envious of Vedas&#8217; so now it is established that whoever rejects or opposes the Vedas should be killed. The writer is giving his own meanings to the words. The writer is trying his level best to twist and distort the verses. Suppose if the Vedas says to protect a stone then the writer may explain it in this way</p>
<p>&#8220;Veda says to protect the stone, Since stone is part of Prakriti and all of us are created out of Prakriti so this actually says to protect the Humans, so the correct translation would be &#8216;O resplendent Lord, the giver of technology , bestower of Infosys, Wipro, Apple, Microsoft, IBM you are the source of knowledge of Bill Gates, Ratan Tata, revealer of Higgs and Boson&#8217;s theory, protect the noble humans from violent terrorists and drive them off&#8221;.</p>
<p>The writer should stop giving his own interpretations. For more information on Brahmadvish read my article <a href="/index.php/2014/05/15/killing-infidels-in-vedas/" data-wpel-link="internal">Killing Infidels in Vedas</a>.</p>
<p><strong>VERSE</strong></p>
<p>“हम लोग जिस से द्वेष करें और जो हम से द्वेष करे, उस को हम शेर आदि पशुओं के मुख में डाल दें।” [यजुर्वेद १५:१५ दयानंद भाष्य]
<p><strong>FANATIC&#8217;S ANALYSIS:</strong></p>
<p>As detailed in previous references, hatred is reserved ONLY for those who blatantly flout this guideline and cause damage to innocents. In other words, ONLY terrorists deserve our hatred. <strong>There is not one mantra in entire Vedas that call for hatred on basis of personal or theological beliefs</strong>. So terrorists should be dealt with iron hand and be firmly destroyed just as Osama Bin Laden was killed recently. Those who deal with terrorists softly bring havoc to society. Once again, definition of terrorist is clear – He is someone who kills innocents and harms public property. Very rightly, these are the most severe crimes in all civilized countries of the world – perfectly in lines of Vedas. That is why USA has to send a mission in Abbotabad to destroy terrorists like Osama. But in this, to ensure that no illogical meaning is derived, the original translation clearly specifies that this phrase refers ONLY to violent people. Refer Yajurveda Bhashyam Part 2 page 510 published by Ramlal Kapoor Trust which is based on original manuscripts. I reproduce the relevant portion:</p>
<p>वे रक्षक हम लोग जिस हिंसक से विरोध करें और जो हिंसक हमसे विरोध करें उसको इन व्याघ्र आदि पशुओं के मुख में स्थापन करें.</p>
<p>So this mantra refers only to violent people and ONLY official security personnel are allowed to carry such operations, not ordinary masses, as per Swami Dayanand. In other words, mantra says that Police and Military should protect people by destroying terrorists.</p>
<p><strong>MY RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>It is already established that as per the Vedic injunction, whoever rejects Vedas is a terrorist, Barbarian, Demon. The writer is mixing all the sentences here. Further there is no Sanskrit word for Hinsak (Violent person) in that verse. It says to &#8216;kill the person who hates us (Ishwar) and WHOM WE HATE&#8217;.</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 15.15 This one in front, golden-tressed, with sunbeams; the leader of his host and his chieftain are Rathagritsa and Rathaujas, and Puñjikasthalâ: and Kratusthalâ his Apsarases. Biting animals are his weapon, homicide his missile weapon; to them be homage: may they protect us, may they have mercy upon us. In their jaws we place the man whom we hate and who hates us.</p>

<p>Can the writer still say that it commands to kill only violent people since the above verse clearly states to be the first one to kill who just &#8216;Hates&#8217; him. These violent verses commands to kill the haters of god and the haters of the Aryas (So called noble people).</p>

<p><strong>FANATIC&#8217;S ANALYSIS:</strong></p>
<p>The current context of the mantra starts at least from 12.5.47 and continues till 73. In reality, the mantra is dedicated to Brahmagavi (ब्रह्मगवी). This refers to fundamental unchangeable laws of nature. The entire chapter details how those who refuse to act as per unchangeable laws of nature due to false ego get destroyed. There is no mention whatsoever of any person or group of person trying to kill anyone. The mantras assert that those who try to silence the voice of intellect or truth get destroyed themselves. These mantras have been the foundation of all revolutionary movements that have ever happened to oppose the voice of tyranny. The chapter is an inspiration for all truth seekers. It elaborates how ultimately laws of nature destroy the greatest of power achieved through tyranny. It elaborates how wealth obtained through tyranny is actually a curse. It elaborates why the mightiest of rulers should be scared of harming a truth-seeking scholar. Mantra 12.5.58 clearly calls this Brahmagavi &#8216;Aghnye&#8217;. So it is in feminine gender and means &#8216;non-violent&#8217;. So it is clear that the mantras talk of wider laws of nature and not inciting into killing innocents because of difference in viewpoints. On contrary, the mantras clearly assert that those who think of killing innocents get destroyed as per Laws of nature. So yes, the mantra does say that Brahmagavi – or Fundamental Truths of Nature destroy the perpetrators of terror and hatred in most merciless manner.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>FANATIC&#8217;S ANALYSIS:</strong></p>
<p>Ideally we should not be analyzing this because it does not refer to Vedas. Swami Dayanand was also a human and there may be typographical errors in his writings. So instead of following him as Prophet, wise people should look at the overall theme of his message and act accordingly. However, still we could not help analyze this because whatever has been presented is a blatant shameless lie. This alone exposes the intent and designs of those who wrote or promoted such hatred against Vedas. As per Quran, they are worst of the creatures. Hindus are very particular about food habits. This is not to do with religion but standards of hygiene. So while the western world adopted practices like washing hands with soap after loo or cleaning hands several times before eating only after advent of soap and wash basin technology, Hindus have been following hospital-standard hygiene practices since inception of civilization. So just as a doctor would not eat with a sweeper because of hygiene issues, same is true with Hindus. Even today, in west people do not even clean their parts after loo with water properly. They simply rub with dry paper. In very few places, people actually wash hands with soap after loo. 125 years ago, when Dettol was not there, people would simply rub off hands in dust or sprinkle some water. No conservative Hindu will take a bite without a bath. And before and after each meal, he would clean hands, face and feet properly. Even within a family, people would not touch each other or eat with them unless they are clean. The utensils used for loo, bathing and cooking are different. Anything that touches one&#8217;s saliva or even lips is never eaten by others even after washing. It is simply thrown away. So all that Dayanand implied was eating with foreigners (from same plate) who have not complied with hygiene practices like bath and cleaning hands properly after loo. Or blindly imitating their food when we have more relevant and tastier options available. As a matter of fact, the variety and quality of good food available in India is comparable to no other place in the world. Regardless of all, the reference provided is fake. Satyarth Prakash does not even have any reference to Chandals here.</p>
<p>Notice the most shameless fraud.To malign Swami Dayanand, Yavan has been replaced by Musalmaan, Antyaj by Chandal and Jaati-Bhed by &#8216;Jaat Paat ka Bhed Bhaav&#8217;.- Yavan does not mean Muslim but someone who hates Hindus. Or else, the same Swami would not have started his Lahore Arya Samaj from home of a Muslim while Swamiji was staying there (in a Muslim&#8217;s home)</p>
<p><strong>MY RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>The writer is cherry picking from a rebuttal and also distorting the passage like he does with his Veda. Here is what was written in the rebuttal by Mushafiq Sultan,</p>
<p>‘’स्वामी दयानंद सरस्वती सत्यार्थ प्रकाश में ब्रह्मोसमाज और प्रर्थ्नासमाज की आलोचना करते हुए लिखते हैं,<br />
“जिन्होंने अँगरेज़, यवन, अन्त्याजादी से भी खाने पीने का अंतर नहीं रखा। उन्होंने यही समझा कि खाने और जात पात का भेद भाव तोड़ने से हम और हमारा देश सुधर जाएगा लेकिन ऐसी बातों से सुधार कहाँ उल्टा बिगाड़ होता हे।” [सत्यार्थ प्रकाश, समुलास 11, पृष्ट 375 प्रकाशक: श्रीमद दयानन्द सत्यार्थ प्रकाश न्यास, उदयपुर, जुलाई 2010]
यवन का अर्थ मुसलमान और अन्त्यज का अर्थ चंडाल होता है।<br />
पंडित जी, मुसलमान और ईसाई कितने ही सदाचारी हों, स्वामी जी के अनुसार उनके साथ खाना उचित नहीं। यह पक्षपात नहीं तो और क्या है? क्या आप अब भी ऐसे ‘आर्य समाज’ में रहना पसंद करेंगे?’’</p>
<p>Mushafiq Sultan has clearly given the reference [सत्यार्थप्रकाश, समुलास 11, पृष्ट 375 प्रकाशक: श्रीमददयानन्दसत्यार्थप्रकाशन्यास, उदयपुर, जुलाई 2010] so how can there be any confusion.</p>
<p>Dayanand Saraswati wrote,</p>
<p>&#8220;They eat and drink most indiscriminately, ie., they even eat and drink with Europeans, Mohammedans and out cast people, etc. They must have thought that promiscuous eating and drinking and the breaking of caste alone will lead to their reformation as well as to that of their country but such thingscan bring about no reformation, on the contrary may cause great mischief.&#8221;- <strong>Satyarth Prakash, by Dayanand Saraswati, p.468, Ch 11 Tr. Chiranjiva Bhardwaja.</strong></p>
<p>This is the English version of the passage which is translated by a Arya Samaji named Dr. Chiranjiva Bhardwaja. Dr. Bhardwaj writes in the amendment of the word Yavana,</p>
<p>&#8220;* The term Yavanas is equally applied to the Greeks and the Mohammedans, etc.&#8221;-By Dr. Chiranjiva Bhardwaja, in the book Satyarth Prakash, page 361</p>
<p>Further a author named Rajmohan writes,</p>
<p>&#8220;Yavan = a pejorative term for foreigner or Muslim.&#8221;- Gandhi: The Man, His People, and the Empire, By Rajmohan Gandhi, page 275</p>
<p>So this &#8220;Shameless fraud&#8221; is not done by any Muslim but by Arya Samaj whose monopoly is being Mayavi (Vedic fraud).</p>
<p>Dayanand Saraswati mentioned only the restrictions of food and cooking. In page 326 of Satyarth Prakash Dayanand wrote that there is no harm (for Aryas) in eating with other Aryas but did not mention whether a Arya Samaji can interdine with a Shudra, Muslim or Christian. He even made discrimination on eating with low caste people or the food offered by them,</p>
<p>&#8220;Question) Should the Dwijaas (twice-born) cook their food with their own hands or is it permissible to eat food cooked by the Shoodraas (low-casted)?</p>
<p>Answer.~ They can eat what has been cooked by the Shoodraas; because it is the duty of Dwijas – Brahmans, Khatriyas and Vaishyasboth men and women) to devote themselves to the dissemination of knowledge, the service of the state, the breeding of cattle, and to agriculture, trade and arts ( and not to waste their time in cooking, etc.) But they should not eat or drink out of a Shudra utensils or what has been cooked in his own house except in case of emergency. Here is an authority for this statement:- &#8221; In the houses of the twice-born, Shudras – i.e., ignorant men and women<br />
incapable of following any higher pursuit – should do the cooking and other domestic service. &#8220;APASTAMBH II.ii, 2,4. But they should keep their bodies and clothes, etc., clean. While engaged in cooking in the houses of the Aryas- the twiceborn – they should have their mouths covered ( witha piece of cloth) so that their beath may not contaminate the food, and their saliva may not fall into it; they should wash before cooking. They should take their food after the Aryashave been served.&#8221;- <strong>Satyarth Prakash, By Dayanand Saraswati, page 319, Tr. Chiranjiva Bhardwaja</strong></p>
<p>Dayanand also wrote,</p>
<p>&#8220;would you eat food out of the hands of a scavenger or a Mohammedan who cooked it with his own hands in some place out of your sight.&#8221;- Satyarth Prakash, by Dayanand Saraswati, page 320, Tr. Chiranjiva Bhardwaja.</p>
<p>So what he meant to say is that all the Shudras and Muslims are filthy. I have seen some Brahmins who are very unhygienic, Can a Shudra (ignorant as per Mulshankar) eat with such Brahmins? Since Dayanand quotes from Apastambha, let me add a verse from Apastambha concerning this issue</p>
<p>Apastamba Sutra,  Prasna I, Patala 6, Kanda 18 According to some (food offered by people) of any caste, who follow the laws prescribed for them, except that of Sudras, may be eaten.</p>
<p>Dayanand said that a Shudra can cook food for a Brahmin since it the duty of Shudra to carry out labor work, but did he actually practice it? Dayanand is said to have refused to partake food in the house of a Brahmin when he learnt that the food was cooked by a Shudra, Pandit Lekh Ram who was a close disciple of Dayanand writes about the incident,</p>
<p>&#8220;In 1879, while on a trip to Dehra Dun, a Brahmo Samajist named Babu Kali Mohan Ghosh invited Dayanand to his house for a meal. Dayanand replied that he had no qualms in eating in his house but added that he had heard that Brahmo Samajists sometimes employed &#8216;low&#8217; caste cooks. This, he said, he did not approve of. The Babu admitted that Brahmo Samajists did not consider it wrong to eat food cooked by anyone, irrespective of caste, but said that he himself did not have a &#8216;low&#8217; caste cook. Thereupon, Dayanand agreed to eat at his house.<br />
The next day, Pandit Lekh Ram writes, his own brother, Har Gulal, informed him that Dayanand had accepted the Babu&#8217;s invitation. Hearing this, Pandit Lekh Ram took some food and went straight to Dayanand&#8217;s room. He gave the food to him to eat, and told him that he had committed a major blunder by accepting the Babu&#8217;s invitation because at one time a Bhangi woman used to cook food in his house. Dayanand replied that he had no knowledge of this and that the Babu had cheated him. He returned to the Babu the food he had sent for him and, instead, ate the food that Pandit Lekh Ram had brought.&#8221;- <strong>Pandit Lekh Ram, Quoted in Ghazi Mahmud Dharam Pal, Arya Samaj aur Swami Dayanand, Islamia Press, Lahore, p.430. [</strong><a href="http://www.newageislam.com/NewAgeIslamBooksAndDocuments_1.aspx?ArticleID=3665" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right"><strong>Source</strong><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a><strong>]</strong></p>
<p>So in reality Dayanand never practiced it, in fact he perceived Muslims, Shudras and Christians to be worst and uglier than cow dung. He writes,</p>
<p>&#8220;Question:- As you plaster the kitchen floor with cow-dung (and mud), why do you not then also use human excrement for the same purpose? Why is not the kitchen polluted when the dung is used in it?</p>
<p>Answer:- The dung is not so foul-smelling as the human excrement. The cow-dung being greasy does not so easily come off the floor, nor does it soil the dress, nor does it look dirty. Dirt does not come off the dry dung so easily as off the mud. The place that has been plastered with a thin coating of mud and dung properly mixed together looks nice. If the kitchen, wherein food is cooked and sometimes also eaten, the naturally therefore particles of food, such as breadcrumbs, sugar and butter, drop sown on the floor which being thus made dirty attracts flies, insects and other such creatures be not swept, plastered and properly cleaned every day, it would be as dirt as a privy. The kitchen, therefore, should be properly plastered with mud and dung, swept and kept thoroughly clean.&#8221;- <strong>Satyarth Prakash, by Dayanand Saraswati, Cp 10, page 325, Tr. Chiranjiva Bhardwaja.</strong></p>
<p>If not partaking food with Christians, Muslims and Shudras was all about &#8220;Being hygienic&#8221; then why did he tell his followers to plaster the kitchen with Cow Dung? We all know that Dung and Urine are wastes of the body which carries thousands of harmful bacteria. This shows that he considered non Aryans to be uglier than his Holy cow dung. Cow dung and urine are one of the Panchgavyas (5 Products of cow) which are to be consumed. So where is the hygiene here? Vedas even say that Urine (particularly Human&#8217;s urine) is a potent remedy.</p>
<p><strong>VERSE:</strong></p>
<p>Yajurveda 30.5 says that just as God created Brahmin for Vedas, He created lecherous for sex. So just as Brahmin&#8217;s dharma is Vedas, Kshatriya&#8217;s dharma is protection, Vaishya&#8217;s dharma is business, Shudra&#8217;s dharma is service, similarly dharma of a lecher is to promote vulgarity and adultery. So Vedas legitimize spread of vulgarity.</p>
<p>यजुर्वेद अध्याय ३०, मंत्र ५ में लिखा हे कि लोगों को विभिन्न धर्मों और व्यवसायों में ईश्वर ने पैदा किया. जहां ईश्वर ने अच्छे व्यवसाय पैदा किये वहीं बुरे व्यवसाय भी पैदा किये. उसने जहां ब्रह्म॑णे ब्राह्म॒णं (वेद के लिए ब्रह्मण को पैदा किया), वहीं कामा॑य पुँश्च॒लूम (समागम के लिए व्यभिचारी को पैदा किया). जिस प्रकार ब्रह्मण का धर्म वेद हे, क्षत्र्य का धर्म नीति की रक्षा, वैश्य का धर्म व्यापार, शूद्र का धर्म सेवा है, इसी प्रकार एक व्यभिचारी का धर्म व्यभिचार है. दुनिया में जिस प्रकार हर कोई व्यक्ति अपना अपना धर्म फेला रहा है, इसी प्रकार, वो भी अपना धर्म फेला रही है, और अन्य लोगों के गुमराह होने का कारण बन रही है.</p>
<p><strong>FANATIC&#8217;S ANALYSIS:</strong></p>
<p>The standard of allegation itself speaks volumes of the intellect of the creator of this argument.</p>
<p>I am not sure what is the source of this translation, but given that the modern fanatics have an obsession to condemn Swami Dayanand, let us review his translation.</p>
<p>To understand the context, let us review the previous mantra 30.5 as well. It says that may the just king give everyone due reward and punishment as per his or her deeds in same manner as Supreme Lord provides fruits of actions justly to all living beings.</p>
<p>So the mantra is a reemphasis on Law of Karma that motivates us all to conduct noble actions and desist us from foolish deeds.The next mantra states that:</p>
<p>May the Lord (of world as well as country) give due reward or punishment to various people – Brahmin for promotion of wisdom, Kshatriya for right leadership, Vaishya for conduct of business, Shudras for their selfless service, thief for thriving in darkness, murderers for killing noble people, impotents for sinful acts (one who conducts sinful acts is impotent as per Vedas as he or she is incapable of producing anything worthwhile), terrorists for attacking innocent people, lechers for adultery, criminals for lowly acts.</p>
<p><strong>MY RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s analyse Yajur Veda 30.5</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 30.5 &#8220;For Brahman (Priesthood) he binds a Brahman to the stake… for Kama [Sex] a harlot…&#8221;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="519" height="165" class="wp-image-7698" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-61.png" alt="http://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/060218_0658_testingresp17.png" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-61.png 519w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-61-300x95.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 519px) 100vw, 519px" /></p>
<p>Can the writer quote the Sanskrit words which he translated as &#8221; May the Lord (of world as well as country) give due reward or punishment to various people&#8221;, Now he may argue that the verse 3 of this chapter mentions this and that it is in continuity. Let&#8217;s read Yajur Veda 30.3</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 30. 3 Savitar, God, send far away all troubles and calamities [from us], And send us only what is good.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="601" height="80" class="wp-image-7699" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-62.png" alt="http://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/060218_0658_testingresp18.png" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-62.png 601w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-62-300x40.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 601px) 100vw, 601px" /></p>
<p>So this is the writer&#8217;s distortion of his Vedas, there are no Sanskrit words which he translated as &#8220;May the Lord (or the country) give due rewards or punishment&#8221;.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Written by Sulaiman Razvi</p>
<p>The writer has tried his level best to show Woman are highly revered in the Vedas. How can they claim that Vedas give equal status to women when Vedas are known for oppressing women, it says Women are devoid of intelligence, she shall not inherit, Women are like sly fox. Women in Vedas is nothing but a commodity, Yajur Veda 30.5 and 30.9 explicitly states that Ishwar has created women for sexual enjoyment. It doesn&#8217;t even pray for daughter let alone giving them equal rights, Veda only prays for the birth of Son, it says daughter should be born somewhere else, this asserts that women in Vedas is merely looked as a commodity. Some Hindu apologists instead of accepting  oppressive verses, has tried to show equal status of women in Vedas by misquoting them, through means of deceit.</p>
<p><span id="more-620"></span></p>
<p>When they couldn&#8217;t find verses that gives equal rights or praises women, they used the verses addressed to Vedic Goddesses to show women are highly revered in Vedas, they has also used verses which are to be recited during Marriage ceremony. Those verses can never be used to prove that women are given equal status in Vedas, if Vedas really praises women then Hindu apologists should furnish references from Vedas that gives equal inheritance, verses praying for birth of daughter etc. This is a response to a Hindu fanatic&#8217;s article. The reason behind making a response to his article is because he has misquoted the Vedic mantras and commentaries to suit is vested interest, to deceive the gullible people. The writer is being deceitful to propagate his religion as taught by his guru Mulshankar (Dayanand). He pretends to be quoting Arya Samaj Hindi translation but in fact he has mistranslated the Hindi translations also. This is why I will mostly be using Arya Samaj translation as well as orthodox translation of Shri Ram Sharma (Gayatri Parivar) for few verses.</p>
<p><strong>CLAIM:</strong></p>
<p>Yajur 16.44</p>
<p>There should me a women army. Let the women be encouraged to participate in war.</p>
<p>(Book: Vagambhraniya, Author: Dr Priyamvada Vedbharti)</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>Correct translation is</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 16.44 &#8220;Food to the expert in deeds, and to the manager of cow-pens. Food to the efficient couch maker, and to him who lives peacefully in his house. Homage to him who is skilled in mental deliberations, and to him who is proficient in diving deep into intricate topics. Food to him who explores the mysteries of nature, and to him who dwells in inaccessible mountain caves.&#8221; Tr. Devi Chand (Arya Samaj)</p>
<p><strong>CLAIM:</strong></p>
<p>Yajurveda 13.26: O woman, you do not deserve to be defeated by challenges. You can defeat the mightiest challenge. Defeat the enemies and their armies. You have valour of thousands. Please us all.</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>Yajur Veda 13.26 Thou art Ashadha, Conquering One. Conquer our foemen, conquer thou the men who fain would-fight with us. A thousand manly powers hast thou: so do thou aid and quicken me.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="497" height="300" class="wp-image-7716" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-71.png" alt="http://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/060218_0700_testingresp1.png" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-71.png 497w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-71-300x181.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 497px) 100vw, 497px" /></p>
<p>Here the word Ashadha or Ishtika is translated as Brick, and earth or speech by some. It is a brick which the queen forms first. The Satapatha Brahmana briefly mentions about Ashadha,</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana 7.4.2.32-33. He then lays down the Ashadha (invincible brick),–the &#8216;invincible one&#8217; being this earth, it is this earth he thus lays down. He puts it on the fore-part (of the altar-site), for this earth was created first. And as to its being called Ashadha. The gods and the Asuras, both of them sprung from Pragapati, strove together. The gods saw this invincible brick, even this earth; they put it on (the altar); and having put it on, they conquered (and drove) the Asuras, the enemies, the rivals, from this universe; and inasmuch as (thereby) they conquered (asahanta), it is called Ashadha. In like manner the Sacrificer, after putting on that (brick), conquers (and drives) his spiteful rival from this universe (or, from everything here).</p>
<p>And there is one more verse from Brahmanas which is a commentary of the Vedic verse,</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana 7.4.2.39. &#8216;Thou art Ashadha, the conquering,&#8217; for the gods thereby conquered the Asuras,–&#8217;conquer the enemies! conquer the hostile!&#8217; as the text, so the meaning;–&#8217;thou hast a thousand energies: do thou speed me!&#8217; a thousand means</p>
<p>So this verse is not addressed to a women but to a Brick.</p>
<p><strong>CLAIM:</strong></p>
<p>Yajurveda 20.85: Noble woman motivates us to be on path of truth, love and harmony.</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>Correct translation is</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 20.85 &#8220;Vedic text, the impeller of truthful speeches, the inspirer of perceptions, expatiates on God.&#8221; Tr. Devi Chand</p>
<p><strong>CLAIM:</strong></p>
<p>Rigveda 2.41.16: O woman, you are the motherly force that provides direction to our life.</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>This verse is not addressed to a common woman, it&#8217;s about people offering prayer to the Goddess, the correct translation is,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 2.14.16 Best Mother, best of Rivers, best of Goddesses, Sarasvati, We are, as &#8217;twere, of no repute and dear Mother, give thou us renown. <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="625" height="118" class="wp-image-7717" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-72.png" alt="http://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/060218_0700_testingresp2.png" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-72.png 625w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-72-300x57.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" /></p>
<p><strong>CLAIM:</strong></p>
<p>Rigveda 6.61.2: The way a powerful river breaks down even strongest rocks and hills, in same manner an intelligent woman destroys the fraud propagated by perverted ones. May we bow to such intelligent women.</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 6.61.2 She with her might, like one who digs for lotus-stems, hath burst with her strong waves the ridges of the hills. Let us invite with songs and holy hymns for help Sarasvati [Vedic Speech according to Arya Samaj] who slayeth the Paravatas.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="437" height="379" class="wp-image-7718" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-73.png" alt="http://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/060218_0700_testingresp3.png" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-73.png 437w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-73-300x260.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 437px) 100vw, 437px" /></p>
<p>This verse is addressed to goddess Saraswati but according to the Arya Samaj&#8217;s Hindi translation it refers to Vedic Speech.</p>
<p><strong>CLAIM:</strong></p>
<p>Atharvaveda 7.57.1: Whenever I am hurt emotionally or physically, woman – as a mother, wife, sister etc – provides healing touch and rejuvenates me. I bow in humble respect to her.</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>Atharva Veda 7.57.1 Whatever trouble hath disturbed and shaken me–I speak with hope, I move, imploring, &#8216;mid the folk What harm my body in myself hath suffered, now let Sarasvati relieve with fatness.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="625" height="147" class="wp-image-7719" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-74.png" alt="http://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/060218_0700_testingresp4.png" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-74.png 625w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-74-300x71.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" /></p>
<p>According to the Shripad Damodar (Arya Samaj) Hindi translation above, this verse is also addressed to Hindu Goddess Saraswati. This is a prayer made to Saraswati.</p>
<p>The writer has quoted some verses about discrimination of women in Vedas and then tried to explain it. He again repeated the same trick i.e., to twist the verses and has given his own interpretation. I will reply to his mistranslated Vedic verses one by one.</p>
<p><strong>CLAIM:</strong></p>
<p>Niyog Pratha was a social custom to beget a child that was prevalent in all societies and more so in Biblical and Quranic society. Bible, Quran an Hadiths are full of such references. But Vedas have no mention of Niyoga. People have interpreted Vedic verses to create social custom of Niyog to prevent prostitution in emergency situations. But neither is it a Vedic order nor a compulsory practice in Aryan society. On contrary, many a prophets of Christianity and Islam got children from slave-girls but never made them their wives! Prophet Abraham is supposed to have even attempted to abandon his slave-girl to death after having child from her. Prophet Muhammad is supposed to have the only son from his slave Maria. God only knows the veracity of these stories and support for sex slavery in Bible and Quran. But as far as Vedas are concerned, any relation apart from one single wife/husband is clearly considered to be cause of miseries.</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>Readers are requested to go through these articles for evidence of Niyoga from Vedas and Arya Samaj scholars,</p>
<p><a href="/index.php/2014/05/11/niyoga-aur-naari/" data-wpel-link="internal">नियोग और नारी (Niyoga aur Naari)</a></p>
<p><a href="/index.php/2014/01/01/women-in-hinduism-conflict-between-swami-dayanand-and-internet-aryas/" data-wpel-link="internal">Women in Hinduism: Conflict between Swami Dayanand and Internet Arya Samajis </a></p>
<p><a href="/index.php/2014/12/27/hinduism-lust/" data-wpel-link="internal">Hinduism and Lust </a></p>
<p><a href="/index.php/2018/05/15/there-is-indeed-obscenity-in-vedas/" data-wpel-link="internal">Obscenity in Vedas</a></p>
<p>Can the writer elaborate what are those &#8220;emergency&#8221; situations where prostitution would be required? Don&#8217;t such people have wives to relieve their desire? Seems like the Rishis created these Niyoga verses to satisfy their whims. The founder of Arya Samaj Dayanand Saraswati wrote</p>
<p>&#8220;Niyoga is clearly allowed by the Veda&#8221; Satyarth Prakash, Swami Dayanand Saraswati, Ch 4, p.142, Tr. Chiranjiva Bhardwaja</p>
<p>When Dayanand (who is considered the greatest revivalist) says Veda sanction Niyoga then how can the author defy his Guru?</p>
<p>The writer is acting like a small kid who when caught tries to accuse others of doing the same thing. You can&#8217;t even compare having a child on slave with Niyoga, because Niyoga is a Vedic practice where the wife cohabits with other men to beget children or the Brahmin cohabits with several women to relieve his desires. He claims Quran is full of such (Niyoga) references but doesn&#8217;t cite any. As far as Prophet&#8217;s relation with Hazrat Mariya is concerned there are ample evidence to show that Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W) married Marriya al Qibtiyya r.a,</p>
<p>&#8220;The muqawqis, or King of the Copts, gave the Prophet (S) two wives as a gift. The Prophet (S) married one[i.e., Mariya], who became the mother of the Prophet&#8217;s son Ibrahim, and he gave the other one to Hassan as a wife&#8221;.</p>
<p>(Haythami said in Majma al-zawaid, &#8220;Tabarani in al-Aswat and al-Bazzar related it, and the narrators in al-Bazzar&#8217;s chain are all scholars of sound Hadith as stated by Hisham Kabbani in Encyclopedia of Islamic Doctrine: Remembrance of Allah and Praising the Prophet, p. 76 Vol. II)</p>
<p><strong>CLAIM:</strong></p>
<p>The reason why birth of a daughter became a curse in last 1000 years was due to the butchers from West and Central Asia coming in name of Islamic Jihad to kill men and rape women. The entire history of last 1000 years is full of resistance against these terrorists. Thus people wanted sons who could fight these terrorists or at least not be raped by them the way they used to rape women. Birth of daughter thus became a curse because safeguarding the dignity of a daughter was a challenging task. This is why purdah system came in India. This is why dowry system became prevalent – ensuring safety of women became a risky thing. And soon these evil practices became part of the culture. However Vedas are complete against all this and it is time we get back to Vedas.</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>As usual the writer tries to blame Muslims for the evil Vedic practices. First of all I want to talk about the Dowry topic. He says all the evil practices became prevalent in India due to Muslims. Can he provide a single reference where Dowry is demanded from women in Islam? Dowry system exists only in Hinduism. Secondly If Muslim rulers were so powerful, cruel and religious bigots that Hindus killed their daughters due their fear then why didn&#8217;t the Muslim rulers establish a fully dominant Muslim empire? They could have easily converted all the Hindus by the force of Sword. But almost all the rulers treated Hindus and Muslims alike, never discriminated on the basis of religion and this is evident from the fact that Hindus still make 80% of the population in India, Even the bravest Hindu rulers were defeated by Muslim rulers, you can ascertain the strength of Muslims rulers by this fact.</p>
<p>In the entire article the writer couldn&#8217;t quote a single verse that prays for the birth of a daughter, on contrary Vedas say a daughter should be born somewhere else and only a son should be born. With such kind of verses Female infanticide became widely prevalent in Ancient India. A historian writes</p>
<p>&#8221;In ancient India approximately 1500 BC, there is evidence of nomadic Vedic Aryan tribes who invaded the land and introduced the custom of Female infanticide (Moor 1811). It was the customary that these tribes would pray for the birth of a male child and pray against the arrival of a female.&#8221; – Violence and Abuse in Society: Understanding a Global Crisis, p.121, Angela Brown Miller</p>
<p>He further writes</p>
<p>Edward Moor (1811), a British soldier reporting on female infanticide in ancient India, specified the reasons that made it a necessary practice. In his treatise advocating for female children, &#8220;Vedic Dark Ages&#8221;, he wrote &#8220;Obliterating female children was a convenient way to alleviate financial ruin; large dowries prescribed by the Vedas implied that female children were an economic burden; women were of little use to Aryan Warmachines.&#8221; In those cultures, the gruesome methods used to murder female infants included posioning, starvation, suffocation, smothering, drowning in a pit filled with milk, burying alive, throwing baby to the crocodiles in the Ganges River, cutting up the child and then feeding it to animals, and throwing the baby girl in the air and chopping her up with unsheathed swords as she fell.&#8221;-(ibid)</p>
<p>So these evil practices were introduced by none other than Hindu invaders themselves.</p>
<p><strong>CLAIM:</strong></p>
<p>The word &#8216;Putra&#8217; in Vedas is generic and does not necessarily mean a son but implies a child. This is same as &#8216;mankind&#8217; does not mean only men but all human beings. In most mantras of Vedas though, word &#8216;Praja&#8217; is used which again means children. As mentioned previously, there are mantras which desire specifically a daughter. For example, Rigveda 10.159.3, 8.31.8, 9.67.10, Yajurveda 22.22, Rigveda 4.32.23 and Atharvaveda 10.3.20. Thus all these claims of Vedas being male-centric is childish at the best.</p>
<p><strong>REPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>Manu Smriti 9.138 Because a son delivers (trayate) his father from the hell called Put, he was therefore called Putra (a deliverer from Put) by the Self-existent (Svayambhu) himself.</p>
<p>Garuda Purana 7.9 The son saves his father from the hell called Put; therefore he was named &#8220;Putra&#8221;<br />
by the Self-existent himself.</p>
<p>Above verses clears all doubts over the term Putra. If the word Putra denotes Children then what does the word Putri mean? Moreover the term &#8220;Veer&#8221; is also used in Vedas to mean Son. The word &#8220;Veer&#8221; is a masculine word generally used for Warrior but in Vedas it&#8217;s been used for Son also. Other verses which the author quoted have been refuted. Its surprising to see that as per Hindu scripture the Son saves the father from hell while the daughter is a burden who does bad. Read <a href="/index.php/2014/05/14/response-to-women-in-hinduismvedas-part-ii-2/" data-wpel-link="internal">Response to Women in Hinduism/Vedas Part II</a> for the refutation of the verses he quoted about Birth of daughters in Veda.</p>
<p><strong>CLAIM:</strong></p>
<p>Punsawan Sanskar is recommended for aspirants of <strong>both sons and daughters</strong>. So there is no male bias here.</p>
<p>The mantra meaning has been distorted to suit the agenda. The mantra has a deep meaning. But simply put it means that: &#8220;By Grace of Ishwar, woman is able to have a womb and nurture the child therein. May the woman have a son if she desires and planned so ELSE she may have a girl. [Atharva Veda 6.11.3]&#8221;</p>
<p>Thus the mantra simply implies that if couple has planned for a boy, may boy be born else girl be born</p>
<p>What translators have done is to translate &#8216;Anyatra&#8217; as &#8216;Elsewhere&#8217; <strong>instead of &#8216;In other condition</strong> or else&#8217;.</p>
<p>The Vedic methods of procreation suggest ways of deciding either a boy or a girl. But regardless of the</p>
<p>case, Punsawan Sanskar is practiced by all Veda followers. Hence there is no gender bias here.</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>It is mentioned in Grihya Sutras,</p>
<p>Sankhayana Grihya Surtra 1.19.6 …Pragapati has created him, Savitar has shaped him. Imparting birth of females to other (women) may he put here a man…</p>
<p>Now who will claim that the translation is incorrect as this verse from Grihya Sutra confirms the Vedic verse on Pumsavan Sanskar. The author himself is distorting the translation and blaming others. Shripad Damodar (Arya Samaj) writes in the commentary about Punsavan,</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="313" height="95" class="wp-image-7720" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-75.png" alt="http://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/060218_0700_testingresp5.png" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-75.png 313w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-75-300x91.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 313px) 100vw, 313px" /></p>
<p>&#8220;The birth of a son is called &#8216;Punsavan&#8217; and birth of a girl is called &#8220;Straishuya&#8221;.</p>
<p>Arya Samaji scholar named Vaidyanath Shastri translates Atharva Veda 6.11.1 as follows,</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 6.11.1 &#8220;Ashvatta rooted on the tree of Shami is medicine in conducting the ceremony of Pumsavan. It being used there to perform the Pumsavan, a male birth is certain. This is the means of finding a son. We the house-holders bring and use it in the woman.&#8221; Tr. Vaidyanath Shastri</p>
<p>It is also mentioned in Garuda Purana,</p>
<p>Garuda Purana 1.93.11-13 &#8220;Garbhadhana (conception) [is performed] after the menstruation, Pumsavana before throbbing of the child in the womb [with purpose to get a son]&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>It is mentioned in Vishnu Smriti,</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti 27.2 The Pumsavana (ceremony to cause the birth of a male) must be performed before the embryo begins to move.</p>
<p>Read the article <a href="/index.php/2014/01/01/female-foeticide-the-bitter-truth/" data-wpel-link="internal">Female Foeticide- The Bitter Truth</a> for more information on Punsavan and Female foeticide</p>
<p>The word &#8220;Anyatra&#8221; means somewhere, elsewhere, in another place. The author has derived the meaning &#8220;in other condition&#8221; from Jaydev&#8217;s translation, while giving the meaning from Jaydev&#8217;s translation it would have been better for him to quote complete translation of Jaydev Sharma (Arya Samaj),</p>
[Jaydev] Atharva Veda 6.11.3…In other conditions there is possibility to conceive a girl child but by this procedure the woman conceives a male child only. <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="463" height="222" class="wp-image-7721" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-76.png" alt="http://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/060218_0700_testingresp6.png" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-76.png 463w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-76-300x144.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 463px) 100vw, 463px" /></p>
<p>This is a clear discrimination against birth of daughters. Another verse from Atharva Veda has a prayer to beget several sons,</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 3.23.3 Bring forth a male, bring forth a son. Another male shall follow him. The mother shalt thou be of sons born and hereafter to be born.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="781" height="87" class="wp-image-7722" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-39.jpeg" alt="http://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/060218_0700_testingresp7.jpg" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-39.jpeg 781w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-39-300x33.jpeg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-39-768x86.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 781px) 100vw, 781px" /></p>
<p>If there is already a son then why does it pray for birth of sons again and again? It is somehow understandable if Vedas pray for one son as daughters don&#8217;t have the right to perform Vedic tasks which can be performed only by a son. But Vedas praying for sons again and again is a discrimination which has lead the Indian society to adopt the evil practice called female infanticide.</p>
<p><strong>CLAIM:</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 8.33.17 Do not try to rule over the thought process of woman. She can think very fast and in multiple dimensions.</p>
<p>This is also true. Women can think and connect at emotional levels that is impossible for men. That is why women can nurture children in ways men cannot even think of. What translators have done is to distort &#8216;Ashasyam&#8217; to mean &#8216;cannot be taught&#8217;while it means &#8216;cannot be ruled&#8217;. Then they translated &#8216;Raghum&#8217; to mean &#8216;little&#8217; while it actually means &#8216;agile&#8217;or &#8216;able to move rapidly in variety of locations&#8217;or &#8216;dynamic&#8217;. That is why Raghu of Raghukul to which Ram belonged was named so.</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>This writer is distorting his own Vedas, he is deliberately mistranslating the verse, the correct translation is,</p>

<p>Mahrishi Manu writes</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 9.18 For women no (sacramental) rite (is performed) with sacred texts, thus the law is settled; women (who are) destitute of strength and destitute of(the knowledge of) Vedic texts, (are as impure as) falsehood (itself), that is a fixed rule.</p>
<p><strong>CLAIM:</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.95.15 &#8220;Do not run away from your duties due to indulgence in a woman. Do not share confidential details of country with anyone. They may be wolves in garb who want to destroy you and your country. A woman befriended for sensual purposesis a wolf in disguise. Hence stay away from sensual vices to protect the country.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thus the particular mantra can be interpreted variously. The particular mantra is part of an allegorical conversation between Pururava and Urvashi. Pururava has several meanings like Cloud, Air and Person. Urvashi means electricity, speech or a woman. Thus the mantra, rather Sukta, provides deep insights. Let us try to understand the context by taking it as conversation. Interestingly this mantra is uttered by the woman herself!</p>
<p>The deep meanings of mantra also unravel that all those women indulged in luring people by glamor – read actresses, models etc – are basically wolves in disguise. So far the country keeps adoring the Aishwarya Rais and Kareenas and Katrinas and ignoring Rani Laxmis and Ahilya Bais and Rani Karnavatis, we simply cannot prosper. Glam-girls are wolves in disguise. And when political leadership starts getting close to them, nothing can be better recipe for national disaster. This mantra thus asserts that considering women as objects for sensual pleasure is not advisable.</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>This is the same author who is quoting verses out of context and now asking everyone to read it in context. Below is the correct translation along with Arya Samaj&#8217;s Hindi translation,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.95.15 Nay, do not die, Pururavas, nor vanish: let not the hideous wolves devour thee. Female friendships do not exist. With women there can be no lasting friendship: hearts of hyenas are the hearts of women.</p>

<p>So where in this verse does it say that it refers to women who lures? This verse refers to women in general, it&#8217;s not confined to particular type of women, people like the author should stop giving their own interpretation. Yaska Acharya in his book Nirukta 5.13 writes that Urvashi is the name of a Nymph. Further this verse is explained in Srimad Bhagawatam/Bhagwad Purana,</p>
<p>Bhagawad Purana 9.14.36-38: &#8220;Urvasi said: My dear King, you are a man, a hero. Don&#8217;t be impatient and give up your life. Be sober and don&#8217;t allow the senses to overcome you like foxes. Don&#8217;t let the foxes eat you. In other words, you should not be controlled by your senses. Rather, you should know that the heart of a woman is like that of a fox. There is no use making friendship with women. <strong>Women as a class</strong><br />
<strong>are merciless and cunning.</strong> They cannot tolerate even a slight offense. For their own pleasure they can do anything irreligious, and therefore they do not fear killing even a faithful husband or brother. Women are very easily seduced by men. Therefore, polluted women give up the friendship of a man who is their well-wisher and establish false friendship among fools. Indeed, they seek newer and newer friends, one after another&#8221;.</p>
<p>Swami Prabhupada the founder of ISKCON writes in the commentaries of these verses</p>
<p>&#8220;Canakya Pandita has advised, visvaso naiva kartavyah strishu raja-kuleshu ca: &#8220;Never place your faith in a woman or a politician.&#8221; Unless elevated to spiritual consciousness, everyone is conditioned and fallen, what to speak of women, who are less intelligent than men. Women have been compared to sudras and vaisyas (striyo vaisyas tatha sudrah). On the spiritual platform, however, when one is elevated to the platform of Krishna consciousness, whether one is a man, woman, sudra or whatever, everyone is equal. <strong>Otherwise, Urvasi, who was a woman herself and who knew the nature of women, said that a woman&#8217;s heart is like that of a sly fox</strong>. If a man cannot control his senses, he becomes a victim of such sly foxes. But if one can control the senses, there is no chance of his being victimized by sly, fox like women. Canakya Pandita has also advised that if one has a wife like a sly fox, he must immediately give up his life at home and go to the forest…<strong>Urvaśī frankly explained the nature of a woman</strong>. Because of her nature, a woman can respond to even a slight offense from her husband by not only leaving him but even killing him if required….Because women are easily seduced, the Manu-samhita enjoins that they should not be given freedom. A woman must always be protected, either by her father, by her husband, or by her elderly son. If women are given freedom to mingle with men like equals, which they now claim to be, they cannot keep their propriety. The nature of a woman, as personally described by Urvasi, is to establish false friendship with someone and then seek new male companions, one after another, even if this means giving up the company of a sincere well-wisher&#8221;.

<p>So according to Srimad Bhagawatam and the commentary by such great scholar of Hinduism, this Vedic verse refers to &#8220;Women as a Class&#8221; not to women like Kareenas, Katrinas, And that all women are like sly fox, cunning, polluted.</p>
<p>The Rishi and Rishika as well as the Deities of this hymn are Urvashi and Puruava, which means their conversation and all that they are saying is a divine inspiration/commandment. So how can some Hindus claim it is Urvashi&#8217;s personal views, thus they are not divine words? The deities of this hymn are Puruava and Urvashi which is enough to prove my point.</p>
<p><strong>CLAIM:</strong></p>
<p>Allegation:</p>
<p>&#8216;Yajur Ved (Taitriya Sanhita)- &#8220;Women code says that the women are without energy. They should not get a share in property. Even to the wicked they speak in feeble manner&#8221; [Yajur Ved 6/5/8/2]
<p>Shatpath Puran, preachings of the &#8216;Yajur Veda&#8217; clubs women, &#8216;shudras&#8217; (untouchables), dogs, crows together and says falsehood, sin and gloom remain integrated in them.

<p>1. The first reference is not clear. In any case Taitriya Samhita is not original Yajurveda. Kindly provide a reference from actual Yajurveda (Madhyandina Shukla Yajurveda Samhita to be specific, which is the actual Veda Samhita).</p>
<p>2. There is no text called Shatpath Puran and Aiterey Puran. They are Shatpath and Aitereya Brahmans. In any case, again these references are not from Vedas. Further we request the author of these allegations to provide the exact verse</p>
<p><strong>MY RESPONSE</strong></p>
<p>Well, it&#8217;s not our fault if there are so many corrupted Vedas available, even the Vedas which you claim to be original is not authentic at all nor can you prove it&#8217;s authenticity. But can you show a reference from your &#8220;Original&#8221; Vedas that talks about equal inheritance? That verse is from Krishna Yajur Veda and is believed by orthodox Hindus (Mainly south Indians) to be correct/Authentic Vedas along with Shukla Yajur Veda. But the most authentic Smriti of Arya Samaj the Manu Smriti also makes no mention of equal inheritance, it rather says</p>
<p>Manu 8:416. A wife, a son, and a slave, these three are declared to have no property; the wealth which they earn is (acquired) for him to whom they belong.</p>
<p>Further Rig Veda also says that a woman will not inherit the property. Refer to my article <a href="/index.php/2014/05/14/no-inheritance-for-woman-in-vedas/" data-wpel-link="internal">No Inheritance for Women in Vedas</a>,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 3.31.2 &#8221;The son does not transfer paternal wealth to his sister. He makes her receptacle of the embryo of her husband. When parents procreate children of either sex, one (the male) becomes the performer of holy rites (he is the legal inheriter), the other (the female) is to be enriched with gifts.&#8221; Tr.

<p>Rig Veda 3.53.14 What do the cattle for thee among the Kikatas, they yield no milk to mix with the Soma, they need not the vessel (for the libation) Bring thou to us the wealth of Pramaganda; give up to us, O Maghavan, the low caste. <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="509" height="270" class="wp-image-7729" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-83.png" alt="http://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/060218_0700_testingresp14.png" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-83.png 509w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-83-300x159.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 509px) 100vw, 509px" /></p>

<p><strong>CLAIM:</strong></p>
<p>Our challenge is open to all – Cite one single verse in all 4 Vedas that justify Sati Pratha, or support polygamy, or insult women, or justify sex-slavery and we shall quit Vedic Dharma.</p>
<p>Let us add one more allegation referring to Rigveda 10.18.7 which Hindu-haters translate to mean &#8220;widow woman should go into fire&#8221;. However what the shameless haters have done is to change the word &#8220;Agre&#8221; in the mantra (which means going ahead) to &#8220;Agne&#8221; which means fire. The mantra by the way has nothing about widow. It means that: In matters of household management, wife should be the leader.</p>
<p><strong>Allegation:</strong></p>
<p>Swami Vivekananda opines that even at that time women used to have sexual intercourse with a person other than her husband to beget a child. The hymn says:&#8221;O woman, get up and adopt the worldly life again. It is futile to lie with this dead man. Get up and become the wife of the man who is holding your hand and who loves you. [Rig Ved 10/18/8]. Apparently this shows that woman is considered to be a property. Whenever and whosoever desired, could become her master.</p>
<p><strong>FANATIC&#8217;S RESPONSE</strong></p>
<p>1. Opinion of Vivekananda or practice of &#8216;that&#8217; time is none of our concern. Many Hindus go to worship graves or even support Jihadi terrorists of Kashmir. That does not make this a practice sanctioned by Vedas or Hinduism.</p>
<p>2. The meaning of this mantra provided has been slightly distorted and misinterpreted to suit one&#8217;s mindset of hatred. Actual meaning is: &#8220;O woman, get up from here and come back to the world of living ones. Do not waste your life in grief of one who is dead. You have the children of the person who had held your hand and became your husband, to take care of.&#8221;</p>
<p>3. The next mantra (where this mantra comes in Atharva Veda 18th Chapter) refers to a childless widow. It says: &#8220;I have seen a young widow rising up from grief of dead to marry again and start her life again away from gloom and darkness.&#8221;</p>
<p>4. Thus the mantras give the noble lesson that a widow should not continue repenting on dead one but start life afresh and continue with her responsibilities. These mantras form the foundation in which widow remarriage is encouraged and Sati Pratha is discouraged. And fools quote these very mantras to showcase the entirely opposite stand!</p>
<p>I agree that condition of widows has been miserable for several centuries. This has been primarily because the first targets of all butchers who invaded from West Asia in name of Islam was to rape women – be it army of Qasim, Ghazni, Ghori, Khilji, Lodhi, Babur, Akbar or whosoever. Thus widows would have no one to even fight and lay their life for their dignity. Thus widowhood started being regarded as a curse. And soon it became a evil practice. Thanks to efforts of 19th century reformers especially Arya Samaj, this is no more the case with Hindu society that knows Vedic Dharma.</p>
<p>4. But the plight of women in Pakistan is extremely horrible. With no rights for divorce and the shameful Hudood ordinance, it has been a nightmare being a woman in a Muslim dominated country.</p>
<p><strong>MY RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>Those verses are mistranslated by the writer. The writer himself should quote the reference as a refutation and then explain it. The correct translation is,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.18.7 Let these unwidowed dames with noble husbands adorn themselves with fragrant balm and unguent. Decked with fair jewels, tearless, free from sorrow, first let the dames go up to where he lieth</p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.18 .8 Rise, woman, (and go) to the world of living beings : come, this man near whom thou sleepest is lifeless: beget children from this appointed husband [through Niyoga], the suitor who took thee by the hand.</p>

[This verse is translated into English from Hindi Bhasya]
<p>The verse Rig Veda 10.18.8 is much more worse than one can imagine, this verse is spoken by the dead husband&#8217;s brother, this is mentioned in Aswalayana Griha Sutra 4.2.</p>
<p>As per the Vedic rule, after the death of the husband, the dead husband&#8217;s bother or any other man is considered Devar i.e., he can have intercourse with the widow at anytime to fulfill his desire and to beget sons.</p>
<p>Arya Samaj commentary on the Rig Vedic verse 10.18.8, page 512 states: &#8220;When a woman capable of conceiving a child becomes widow then she may contract Niyoga with the Appointed Husband to beget childre&#8221;</p>

<p>The author says remarriage is strongly encouraged in Vedas but cites no reference for it. As per the Vedic law, a widow should either live a life of austerity i.e., not wearing colorful clothes, jewellery, not laughing etc., or else should enter the pyre of her Husband. She can&#8217;t desire to have sex with other men, but other men without any hesitation can have it with her. it is mentioned in</p>
<p>Parasara Smrti 4.32 If a woman follows her departed lord, by burning herself on the same funeral pile, she will dwell in heaven for as many years as there are hairs on the human frame, which reach the number of three crores and a half.</p>
<p>So a woman should either remain widow or ascend the pyre, but why should a woman have this option? Why not make this same rule applicable for men also? As per Hindu scripture a man can marry after the death of his wife but if a husband dies then the wife should either ascend her husband&#8217;s pyre or live a life of celibacy. Niyoga is clearly sanctioned by Maharishi Manu in Manu Smriti 9.81. Swami Dayanand Saraswati also discouraged widow remarriage and also said that it is prohibited. Then how can the author go against the teachings of his Guru.</p>
<p>Looks like the author has vowed to blame Islam and Muslims for all the evil practices sanctioned by the Vedas. Women are war booty in Vedic Dharm</p>
<p>As far as Divorce is concerned, a Woman can never ask for divorce</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 5. 154. Though destitute of virtue, or seeking pleasure (elsewhere), or devoid of good qualities, (yet) a husband must be constantly worshipped as a god by a faithful wife.</p>
<p>Hindu reformist organization like Arya Samaj did nothing for the betterment of women as the Vedas opposes it. Arya Samajis supports castiesm and Niyoga so how can the author claim such crap. The author writes</p>
<p>&#8221; Thus widows would have no one to even fight and lay their life for their dignity. Thus widowhood started being regarded as a curse.&#8221;</p>
<p>Didn&#8217;t the writer just say that remarriage is strongly encouraged in Vedas? if it is so then why these widows were not remarried so that their Husbands may protect them? Isn&#8217;t it the duty of Brother or Son as well to protect the widow? Maharishi Manu writes,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 9.65 In the sacred texts which refer to marriage the appointment (of widows) is nowhere mentioned, nor is the remarriage of widows prescribed in the rules concerning marriage.</p>
<p>But in case when there is a remarriage of women, the remarried woman, her husband and her son will be isolated, this is what Maharishi Manu says</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 9.160 …the son begotten on a re-married woman, the son self given, and the son of a Sudra female, (are) the six (who are) not heirs, (but) kinsmen.</p>
<p>Manu Smriti .166 …the husband of a remarried woman, and a carrier of dead bodies, (all these) must be carefully avoided.</p>
<p>Sati Pratha was existent in India before the advent of Muslims. Does the writer mean to say that Mudri the wife of Pandu and wives of Hindu god Krishna practiced Sati Pratha due to the fear of Muslim invaders? As there is evidence from Hindu scriptures to show that Sati Pratha was a Vedic custom practiced by some women,</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 5.38 &#8220;The 8 queens of Krishna, who have been named, with Rukmini at their head, embraced the body of Hari, and entered the funeral fire. Revati also embracing the corpse of Rama, entered the blazing pile, which was cool to her, happy in contact with her lord. Hearing these events, Ugrasena and Anakadundubhi, with Devaki and Rohini, committed themselves to the flames.&#8221;</p>
<p>For more information read the article <a href="/index.php/2018/10/01/sati-pratha-the-burning-of-widows/" data-wpel-link="internal">Sati Pratha: The Burning of Widows</a>. The evil practice of Sati Pratha came into existence not because of Muslims, instead the Muslim rulers tried to stop this evil Vedic practice</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Though Mughals tried to impose restrictions on Sati Pratha but could not stop this evil practice. The position of a widow was miserable in the Hindu society. They were not allowed to use ornaments.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Muslim women had property right of their Husband and father but Hindu women had no property right. The Hindu female had her right only on ornaments and precious articles.&#8221;- Pratiyogita Darpan, p.133, by Upkar Prakashan.</strong></p>
<p>It has become habit of Hindu fanatics to start talking about other countries just to cover the ugly part of Hinduism. Islam gives women the right to divorce unlike Hinduism which doesn&#8217;t allow women to divorce and even says that widow should either ascend pyre of her husband or live her entire life in simplicity and chastity and chastity here includes obscene practice called Niyoga. Practices like Sati, Niyoga, Dev Daasi, female infanticide shows which religion is oppressive to women. There has been 500% increase in rape of Dalit women. The Indian court had to ban many inhumane Vedic practices and the writer in his hypocrisy crediting Arya Samaj.</p>
<p><strong>CLAIM:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Allegation</strong>:</p>
<p>In Rig Veda there are references to slave girls being given in charity as gifts. After killing the men-folk of other tribes, particularly of the native inhabitants, their women were rounded up and used as slave girls. It was custom to present slave girls to one other as gifts. The kings used to present chariots full of slave girls to their kith and kin and priests (Rig Veda 6/27/8). King Trasdasyu had given 50 slave girls. It was custom to present slave girls to Saubhri Kandav (Rig Veda 8/38, 5/47/6).</p>
<p><strong>FANATIC&#8217;S RESPONSE</strong></p>
<p>1. Not again! The mantra in 6.27.8 has a &#8216;Vadhu&#8217; word which has been misquoted blatantly and foolishly. The sukta refers to national security. The actual mantra means: &#8220;May the wise king appoint a council of 20 able dynamic persons to create strategies to defend the nation from enemies.&#8221; The word &#8220;Vadhumatah&#8221; means one who is capable and dexterous in handling multiple situations smartly.</p>
<p>2. The reference to King Trasadasyu has been wrongly given again showcasing that no one even bothered to check the references. But whatever be the case, Tradasyu means one who defeats terrorists and criminals and hence ensures peace and progress. Saubhari means a noble person who takes care of students well. The actual mantra in Rigveda 8.19.36 means: &#8220;The king who is very philantrophic and protector of noble ones, who has defeated the terrorists has provided me 50 Vadhus.&#8221;</p>
<p>3. Now question is that what does Vadhu mean? Vadhu means anything that brings strength, vitality, protection or bliss. Since Vedic philosophy believes that women are source of all happiness that come in a society, Vadhu refers to a new bride who enters home of in-laws. Thus it can refer to a daughter-in-law or wife or a bride in general. It can also mean an armed force that protects the nation. Thus in no way the mantra refers to slave girls. If you take literal meaning of bride, then it means that King gave 50 already wed women to a teacher. Obviously it then means that he arranged for marriage of his graduating students. But a more sensible meaning would be that the king gave a battalion of 50 to a general to protect the country. But no way, can it refer to a slave girl.</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>How can someone give &#8220;already wedded women&#8221;? A bride is not presented to anyone, only a slave girl is presented. The author has mistranslated the verses, below are the verses with correct Hindi translation of Shri Ram Acharya,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 6.27.8 The opulent supreme sovereign Abhy Avartin, the son of Chayamana, presents, Agni, to me two damsels riding in cars, and twenty cows</p>

<p>If these verses are referring to Bride/Wife then can Hindu tell us How can wives be presented to someone? Is it Niyoga or some other obscene Vedic practice? A slave is a commodity which can be sold, purchased or gifted and that&#8217;s what we read in Vedas here, the Woman were gifted to others. The Arya Samaj translation says,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 3.52.3 Eat, Indra, our (offered) cakes and butter; derive enjoyment from our praises, as a lover from women.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="509" height="281" class="wp-image-7735" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-89.png" alt="http://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/060218_0700_testingresp20.png" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-89.png 509w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-89-300x166.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 509px) 100vw, 509px" /></p>
<p>The Arya Samaj translation has translated the word Vadhu as Stree (Woman) in this verse, further the commentary states,</p>
<p>&#8220;…Like the man longing for a woman is blissed by getting her…&#8221;</p>
<p>The sentence here in this verse &#8220;Vadhuyur yoshanaam&#8221; means one fond of women. The word Vadhu also means Woman, even the author writes</p>
<p>&#8221; Even the most modern Amarkosh 3.102 simply states &#8220;Vadhurjaya Snusha Stree Cha&#8221; or &#8220;Vadhu means Wife, Daughter-in-law or Woman&#8221;</p>
<p>Maharishi Manu writes about types of slaves in the most authentic Smriti of Arya Samaj the Manu Smriti,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 8.415 There are slaves of seven kinds, (viz.) he who is made a captive under a standard, he who serves for his daily food, he who is born in the house, he who is bought<br />
and he who is given, he who is inherited from ancestors, and he who is enslaved by way of punishment.</p>
<p>It is mentioned in Upanishad that,</p>
<p>Brihadayanaka Upanishad 6.2.7 He said: &#8216;You know well that I have plenty of gold, plenty of cows, horses, <strong>slaves</strong>, attendants, and apparel; do not heap on me what I have already in plenty, in abundance, and superabundance.&#8217;</p>
<p>So it is evident that Slavery was prevalent in Vedic period and sanctioned by the Vedic texts.</p>
<p><strong>CLAIM:</strong></p>
<p>As for intercourse without marriage, Vedas strictly recommend against it. They recommend a relationship between man and woman that is based on commitments and for a purpose. Hidden relationships or goalless relationships are both rejected</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>Mr Reference forgot to mention the reference, Can he cite a single reference that prohibits it? Vedas permits extra martial sex and adultery, read my article <a href="/index.php/2018/05/15/there-is-indeed-obscenity-in-vedas/" data-wpel-link="internal">Obscenity in Vedas</a>.</p>
<p><strong>CLAIM:</strong></p>
<p>As for incest (brother-sister or father-daughter relationship), Vedas recommend harshest punishment</p>
<p>that sets example for society. Further, wine drinking is considered a foolish act</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>Where is the reference for this? I don&#8217;t think it is very difficult to mention the source for what you say, you just have to type it. Or at least give the reference wherein Ishwar prohibits incest? If there isn&#8217;t any then why defend it?</p>
<p><strong>CLAIM:</strong></p>
<p>Let us first provide meaning of Atharva Veda 20.96.15. It says: &#8220;We shall destroy the person who molests/rapes a woman or kills her children posing as her brother or protector&#8221;. This mantra justifies why punishment for rape is death sentence as per Vedic Dharma.</p>
<p>Now let us provide meaning to actual mantra being alleged to have intercourse between father and daughter. This is Rig Veda 1.164.33. The mantra explains the process of food/herb generation through rainfall. It says: Sunlight is like my father because he provides me nourishment and the earth is like my mother because she supports and feeds me. Sun and Earth face each other as if two armies stand against each other. Clouds impregnate the earth with rainfall so that food and herbs are produced that provide us nourishment. Thus this mantra describes a natural phenomenon through allegory and nowhere states that incest is recommended.</p>
<p>Please also note that &#8216;Duhita&#8217; means one obtained from churning. Thus the mantra also implies that earth is formed from a part of sun that separated out in a process similar to churning. Astro-physicists can corroborate if this process of creation of earth from sun is indeed correct or not.</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>The correct translation for this verse is,</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 20.96.15 May we exterminate from hence, who in the form of brother, husband, or paramour, approaches thee, and seeks to destroy thy offspring.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="492" height="194" class="wp-image-7736" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-90.png" alt="http://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/060218_0700_testingresp21.png" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-90.png 492w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-90-300x118.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 492px) 100vw, 492px" /></p>
<p>I have provided Arya Samaj Hindi translation also, so where does it say Ishwar destroys the person who &#8220;Rapes/Molests Women&#8221;, This verse is talking about Ishwar protecting the embryo in womb. This is clearly mentioned in Rig Veda 10.96 the entire hymn speaks about this. I wonder didn&#8217;t the writer read previous verses of Atharva Veda 20.96.15 or he deliberately distorted the meaning of this mantra to present it for his interests. Those verses will clear the doubt,</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 20.96.12-13 …The malady of evil name that hath attacked thy babe and womb. That which destroys the sinking germ, the settled, moving embryo, That which would kill the babe at birth, even this will we drive far away.</p>

<p>As far as Rig Veda 1.164.33 is concerned, the writer has mistranslated that verse also, If Vedas really prohibit incest then why doesn&#8217;t he quote the verse? The fact is Vedas directly or indirectly promotes incest but doesn&#8217;t prohibit it. Read my article <a href="/index.php/2018/05/15/there-is-indeed-obscenity-in-vedas/" data-wpel-link="internal">Obscenity in Vedas</a>.</p>
<p>Yaska Acharya gives the following meaning for the word Duhita,</p>
<p>&#8220;Daughter is called Duhita because she is Durhita (one who does bad) and Durehita (it is better if she stays far away). She is Dogdha (one who sucks parent&#8217;s wealth)&#8221; -Nirukt 3.4</p>
<p><strong>CLAIM:</strong></p>
<p>Allegation:</p>
<p>In the name of &#8216;beejdan&#8217; (seed donation), they used to have sexual intercourse with issueless women. This was a cruel religious custom and the chastity of the women was not safe. The so called caretakers of the religion were allowed to have sexual intercourse with other man&#8217;s wife. From &#8216;Niyog pratha&#8217; it can be inferred without fear of contradiction that women were looked upon as mere child producing machines. In The Position of women in Hindu Civilization, Dr. B. R. Ambedkar writes: &#8220;Though women is not married to man, she was considered to be a property of the entire family. But she was not getting share out of the property of her husband, only son could be successor to the property.&#8221; Gajdhar Prasad Baudh says [Arya Niti Ka Bhadaphor, 5th ed., p. 14]: &#8220;No woman of the Vedic age can be treated as pure. Vedic man could not keep even the relations brother-sister and father-daughter sacred from the oven of rape and debauchery/adultery named &#8216;Niyog&#8217;. Under the influence of intoxication of wine, they used to recognize neither their sister nor their daughter and also did not keep the relations with them in mind. It is evident from their debauchery and adultery what a miserable plight of women was society in then.&#8221;</p>

<p>1. Once more vague allegations and no reference. Once more my request: Cite authentic references from Vedas to claim anything for Hinduism and not some historical allegations.</p>
<p>2. Ambedkar is not an authority on Hinduism. He admits in his writings that he has no knowledge of</p>
<p>Sanskrit and has referred only to western authors in translations of Vedas.</p>
<p>3. And who is this Gajdhar Prasad Baudh? Yet another Prophet or reincarnation of some old prophet that his words are taken so seriously?</p>
<p>4. As for incest (brother-sister or father-daughter relationship), Vedas recommend harshest punishment that sets example for society. Further, wine drinking is considered a foolish act. In fact anything that dumbs mind – wine, lust or anger – is considered foolishness in Vedic custom. But may be this new Prophet has come with some new revelations! We request your new Prophet to cite specific references instead of vague allegations. (I know this statement is getting repetitious but we have no other option)</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>Swami Dayanand Saraswati (Mulshankar) the founder of Arya Samaj wrote in his book</p>
<p>&#8220;Those, however, who cannot control their passions may beget children by having recourse to Niyoga.&#8221; By Swami Dayanand Saraswati, Satyarth Prakash, Ch 4, p.130, Tr. Chiranjiva Bhardwaja</p>
<p>He also wrote,</p>
<p>&#8220;If a man be not able to control his passions while his wife and she is pregnant, he may contract Niyoga with a (widow) and beget offspring on her…&#8221; – Satyarth Prakash, Dayanand Saraswati, Ch 4, pg140 Tr. Chiranjiva Bhardwaja</p>
<p>As we can see, it states that if a man (particularly Brahmin) is unable to control his lust then he can have sex with the widow in the name of Niyoga or Beejdan you can say. This guy is busy making his own sect, his beliefs contradict the teachings of his guru Mulshankar, and also he does not view scholars like Vivekananda as authoritative. Whenever such claims are made which the Veda sanctions Mr. Reference insists for references but Mr. Reference doesn&#8217;t provide the reference from Vedas where incest is prohibited. Can Mr. Reference furnish the evidence from Vedas wherein Ishwar recommends harsh punishments for incestuous acts? Vedas does not prohibit incest but it promotes incest in several verses.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Make sure you read the first part of this article, </strong><a href="/index.php/2014/05/14/response-to-women-in-hinduismvedas-part-i/" data-wpel-link="internal"><strong>Women in Hinduism/Vedas Part 1</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>CLAIM: VEDAS PRAY FOR BIRTH OF DAUGHTERS</strong></p>
<p>It is true that the birth of the son was celebrated from last 100 years. But this was not because of a Vedic injunction. This is because of the Jihadis who were killing men and raping the women, so Sons were wished to defend from these Jihadis and to prevent rape. <strong>On contrary, there are specific verses in Vedas that pray for begetting daughters! Refer Rigveda 10.159.3</strong>, Rigveda 8.31.8, Yajurveda 22.22, Rigveda 4.32.23 and Atharvaveda 10.3.20.</p>
<p><span id="more-596"></span></p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE:<br />
</strong></p>
<p>The interesting thing to note is some Hindus always blame Muslims for the Vedic verses oppressing women and treating them like third class citizens. Woman in Vedas is merely seen as a commodity. There are verses that prays only for the birth of a Son and doesn&#8217;t wish for Daughter, in fact the Vedas even says that a girl should be born somewhere else and 10 Sons should be born in this womb (this is the context of the hymn), this is the reason why the writer is talking about the so called Vedic verses wishing for Daughters.</p>
<p>In reality there isn&#8217;t a single verse which says so, Vedas pray for the birth of a Son in many passages like the entire hymn of Atharva Veda 6.11. and 7.48 are dedicated for the birth of a son and several verses like Atharva Veda 14.1.22, 12.3.47, 2.36.3, 14.2.72, Rig Veda 3.31.1, 10.85.42-45 and so on pray for the birth of a Son only but I don&#8217;t find a single verse that wishes for daughter.</p>
<p>All the verses the writer has quoted are mistranslated although he claims to be using &#8220;Authentic&#8221; translation. I will mostly be using Arya Samaj translations and also orthodox Hindi translations of renowned Hindu scholars like Shri Ram Acharya, Swami Karpatri and Pundit Ram Govind Trivedi.</p>
<p>The first verse he quoted about Daughter&#8217;s birth is Rig Veda 10.159.3, first let&#8217;s see what he wrote in another article</p>
<p><strong>CLAIM:</strong></p>
<p>Chapter 1: Women in Vedic Dharma, Page 21</p>
<p>Rig 10.159</p>
<p>A women speaks after waking up in morning, &#8220;My destiny is as glorious as the rising sun. I am the flag of my home and society. I am also their head. I can give impressive discourses. My sons conquer enemies. My daughter illuminates the whole world. I myself am winner of enemies. My husband has infinite glory. I have made those sacrifices which make a king successful. I have also been successful. I have destroyed my enemies.&#8221;</p>
<p>(Book: Mera Dharma, Author: Priyavrat Vedavachaspati, Gurukul Kangri University)</p>
<p><strong>MY RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>He claimed that Rig Veda 10.159.3 prays for birth of a daughter but according to his own translation we can&#8217;t find any sentence where the birth of a daughter is wished. Here is the correct translation,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.159.3-6My Sons are slayers of the foe, my Daughter is a ruling Queen… and rid me of each rival wife. Destroyer of the rival wife, Sole Spouse, victorious, conqueror. The others&#8217; glory have I seized as &#8217;twere the wealth of weaker Dames.…I have subdued as conqueror these rivals, these my fellow-wives, That I may rule this Hero and the folk.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="453" height="357" class="wp-image-7743" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-93.png" alt="http://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/060218_0701_testingresp2.png" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-93.png 453w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-93-300x236.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 453px) 100vw, 453px" /></p>
<p>These verses doesn&#8217;t pray for the birth of a daughter rather this is a prayer of a greedy Queen who wants to get rid of her co-wives so that she may rule the kingdom. His last sentence is correct to an extent</p>
<p>The context of this verse is that a Queen has many co wives, and she is praying for the destruction of her co-wives so she may have control over all the wealth and rule the kingdom. It even states that she destroyed her rival wives. Can this verse which depicts a woman as greedy, wealth monger, killer of innocent rival wives be used to show that Women are praised in Vedas?</p>
<p>The correct translation for the next verse the writer has quoted is,</p>
<p>Yajurveda 22.22 &#8220;warrior ; the cow giving abundant milk, the ox good at carrying burden ; the swift courser ; the woman skilled in domestic affairs, May this sacrificer be blessed with sons&#8221;. Tr. Devi Chand. <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="508" height="188" class="wp-image-7744" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-94.png" alt="http://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/060218_0701_testingresp3.png" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-94.png 508w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-94-300x111.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 508px) 100vw, 508px" /></p>
<p>This verse also prays for the birth of a son only, and says that Women (Stri not daughter) should be skilled in domestic work, it doesn&#8217;t say that daughter should be born. This verse rather projects a woman as a slave who is used only for domestic work.</p>
<p>Rigveda 4.32.23 Like two slight images (puppets) of girls, unrobed, upon a new-wrought post, So shine the Bay Steeds in their course.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="625" height="85" class="wp-image-7745" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-95.png" alt="http://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/060218_0701_testingresp4.png" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-95.png 625w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-95-300x41.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" /></p>
<p>This verse is used by some Orthodox Hindus to prove Idol worship in Vedas. This verse doesn&#8217;t talk anything about begetting a daughter.</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 10.3.20 As glory dwelleth in a maid, and in this well-constructed car, So may the Charm, etc.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="625" height="115" class="wp-image-7746" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-96.png" alt="http://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/060218_0701_testingresp5.png" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-96.png 625w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-96-300x55.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" /></p>
<p>Rig Veda 8.31.8</p>

<p>The above verse is translated as &#8220;The man and woman who obeys Ishwar and who does good deeds gets good Son…&#8221;</p>
<p>This verse do not speak of birth of a daughter, as we see here, other translations states that &#8220;They are blessed with sons&#8221;, the Arya Samaj Hindi translation also speaks of a Son born to parents who obeys Ishwar, So does that mean Ishwar will curse the people who do not follow him by giving them a Daughter? Griffith&#8217;s translation also doesn&#8217;t mention anything about begetting sons or daughters.</p>
<p>Rig Veda 9.67.10 May Pusan, drawn by goats, be our protector, and on all his paths Bestow on us our share of maids.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="492" height="93" class="wp-image-7748" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-98.png" alt="http://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/060218_0701_testingresp7.png" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-98.png 492w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-98-300x57.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 492px) 100vw, 492px" /></p>
<p>This verse does not pray for the birth of a daughter rather it is longing for WOMAN and praying to get women for carnal purpose. The Sanskrit word is Kanya which is translated as Maiden or Lady. Arya Samaj translations like Satyaprakash and Tulsi also does not mention anything about bestowing daughters.</p>
<p><strong>CLAIM:</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 5.47.6 mentions that: &#8220;<strong>Those educated women who happily choose their husbands and then give birth to noble children, plan and train their life and those of children in same manner as one weaves a cloth from threads slowly and steadily.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p><strong>MY RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>Correct translation is</p>
<p>Rig Veda 5.47.6 &#8220;For him worshippers lengthen praises and works of adoration, and for him mothers (cosmos) sew garments of rays. Rejoicing in the contact of their impregnation, the rays, the consorts, of the sun, come to our presence by the path of the sky, to meet him.&#8221; Tr. Saty Prakash Saraswati</p>
<p>It does not talk about the &#8220;Educated Women&#8221;, rather this verse talks about a Woman weaving garment for her Son (according to Shri Ram Acharya translation).</p>
<p><strong>CLAIM:</strong></p>
<p>Yajurveda 5.10: O woman, realize your potential. You are a lioness who can destroy criminals, ignorance and vices and protect the noble ones.</p>
<p><strong>MY RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>Correct translation is.</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 5.10 &#8220;O speech, thou pronouncest words and overawest foes, attain to the learned. O speech, thou art the dispeller of ignorance, and remover of evils, purify the religious-minded people. O speech, thou art the destroyer of ignoble character and the subduer of mean demeanour, aborn thyself for the well-behaved learned persons.&#8221;- Tr. Devi Chand (Arya Samaj)</p>

<p>This verse is not even addressed to a woman, secondly it talks about the Vedic speech. The verse is in femininity because the addressee is Ved<br />
Vani (Vedic Speech/words) which are feminine in Hindi and Sanskrit language.</p>

<p>According to Tulsi Ram&#8217;s and Griffith&#8217;s translation this verse is addressed to Sinivali (A Goddess), read the first verse of this hymn which is addressed to the Goddess moreover the husband here is the Hindu god Vishnu. This is also a payer made to Goddess requesting her husband to bestow riches. Your doubts will be cleared if you read all 3 verses of this hymn,</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 7.46.1-3 O broad-tressed Sinivāli, thou who art the sister of the Gods, Accept the offered sacrifice, and, Goddess, grant us progeny. Present the sacrifice to her, to Sinivāli, Queen of men, Beautiful-fingered, lovely-armed, prolific, bearing many a child. Thou who as Queen of men art Indra&#8217;s equal, a Goddess coming with a thousand tresses, To thee our sacrifices are performed, O Consort of Vishnu Goddess, urge thy Lord to bounty!</p>

<p>This verse does not state that girls should educate themselves. The word Brahmacharya here denotes self-restraint, not about getting education, if it is about getting education then can the writer please explain which school educates Bull and Horse? This is why Griffith whose translation is based on Hindu scholars also translates it as &#8220;by Self-restraint&#8221;.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="625" height="120" class="wp-image-7761" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-111.png" alt="http://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/060218_0701_testingresp20.png" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-111.png 625w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-111-300x58.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" /></p>
<p>The writer has translated the names of goddesses Raka and Kuhu as woman, but actually these are the names of the Hindu goddesses,</p>
<p>Bhagawad Purana 4.1.34: Angira&#8217;s wife, Sraddha, gave birth to four daughters, named Sinivali, Kuhu, Raka and Anumati.</p>
<p>Nirukta 11.28 &#8220;Anumati and Raka are two wives of gods&#8221;</p>
<p>Nirukta 11.33 &#8220;Simvali and Kuhu are two wives of gods&#8221;</p>
<p>Offerings were made to these goddesses</p>
<p>Krishna Yajur Veda 5.6.18 &#8220;To Aditi are (to be offered) three ruddy-spotted; to Indrani three black-spotted; to Kuhu three red-spotted; three calves to Raka; three heifers to Sinivali; the red-spotted hornless ones are for Agni and Visnu.&#8221;</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s clear that these verses refer to Hindu goddesses not to common women. Kuhu is the goddess of the new moon day. The Atharva Veda 7.47 is a hymn for gaining wealth and Son. The verses addressed to Goddesses can not be used to portray women are highly revered in Vedas, readers can go through this article to know why Goddesses are praised <a href="/index.php/2014/01/01/why-did-the-brahmins-dethrone-the-gods-and-enthrone-the-goddesses/" data-wpel-link="internal">Why did the Brahmins dethrone the Gods and enthrone the Goddesses?</a></p>
<p>for the sake of the argument even if I accept his translation to be correct, it doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean that the wife is a good luck charm that will bring wealth. A woman in Hinduism brings wealth with her as a Dowry, even after the marriage she has to keep bringing money from her parent&#8217;s house, so this is how she brings wealth, Dayanand Saraswati writes,</p>
<p><strong><em>&#8216;</em></strong>&#8216;If the bride&#8217;s people do not live very far from her husband&#8217;s home, there is a possibility of her parents becoming poor<strong><em>, as whenever she visits her parents, they will have to give her something or other by the way of a present.&#8221;-</em></strong>Satyarth Prakash ch 4, p84.</p>
<p>Further the Hymn of Atharva Veda 7.48 is also a prayer to get wealth and a SON. The author should have honestly quoted the previous verse also,</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 7.48.1 …may beget sons…</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="546" height="127" class="wp-image-7762" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-112.png" alt="http://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/060218_0701_testingresp21.png" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-112.png 546w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-112-300x70.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 546px) 100vw, 546px" /></p>
<p>Vedas doesn&#8217;t say woman brings prosperity, but prosperity here only means the birth of a son, Rig Veda and the hymn of Atharva Veda 7.48 is entirely dedicated for birth of a son and prosperity. Another verse states that</p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.63.15 Vouchsafe us blessing in our paths and desert tracts, blessing in waters and in battle, for the light; Blessing upon the wombs that bring male children forth</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 12.3.47 …A youthful world, a son hath been begotten. Begin a life that brings success and triumph.</p>
<p>Similarly the woman who has no son was looked down in the Vedic period, it is mentioned in the Brahmana,</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana 5.3.1.13 And on the following day he goes to the house of a discarded (wife), and prepares a pap for Nirriti;–a discarded wife is one who has no son…hail!&#8217; For a wife that is without a son, is possessed with Nirriti (destruction, calamity)…</p>
<p>So in the Vedic scripture the woman brings prosperity only by giving birth to a son, if she doesn&#8217;t she is discarded, looked down, rejected, cursed.</p>

<p>The speaker in this verse is not God, it&#8217;s the father. The Arya Samaj translation does not say that the &#8220;Woman/Bride shall be the protector of your family&#8221;.

<p>The writer is quoting half-baked verses, he correctly quoted that the Bride may become the queen of her husband&#8217;s house but didn&#8217;t say how she could become  queen. It&#8217;s simple, by Begetting a Son. If begetting a son makes a woman the queen of the house then begetting a daughter might make her the housemaid. It also does not state that she should enlighten all but it says she shines in lovliness.</p>

<p>These verses are to be recited during the marriage ceremony, This verse does not say that the Bride has conquered everyone&#8217;s heart, or the bride be prosperous.</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 14.2.74 Her who first guided by a rein came hither, giving the bride, here offspring and possessions, Let them convey along the future&#8217;s pathway. Splendid, with noble children, she hath conquered.</p>

<p>Atharva Veda 14.2.71-72 I am this man, that dame art thou I am the Samved and thou the Rigved. I am the heaven and thou the earth. So will we dwell together here, parents of children yet to be. Unmarried men desire to wed; bountiful givers wish for sons. Together may we dwell with strength unscathed for high prosperity.</p>

<p>First of all the speaker here is a man wishing for a Bride, secondly the Arya Samaj translation does not state that &#8220;I&#8217; am knowledgeable so are you&#8221;. Next verse of this hymn prays for begetting a Son, So again there is a discrimination against birth of Daughter. The Upanishad explains this verse,</p>
<p>Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 6.4.20 &#8220;Then he embraces her, repeating the following mantra:I am the vital breath and you are speech. You are speech and I am the vital breath. I am Saman and you are Rig; I am heaven and you are earth. Come, let us strive together so that we may have a male child.&#8221;</p>
<p>The next verses of this Brihadaranyaka Upanishad are too vulgar, it explicitly tells sex positions. So I won&#8217;t be quoting it here, readers can check those verses in the article <a href="/index.php/2014/12/27/hinduism-lust/" data-wpel-link="internal">Hinduism and Lust</a>. The writer is quoting verses which are to be recited at the time of marriage or when the Bride enters the house, she brings lot of wealth with her as dowry and is wished only for begetting sons so how can these verses be used to show women are revered in Vedas? Even a horse or bull which is slaughtered in the Yajna is mentioned in similar way in the Vedas. If the writer wants to show equal status of women in Vedas then he should quote verses giving them equal inheritance, praising common women (Not goddesses), permitting them to get education, allowing them to do trade and commerce etc.</p>

<p><strong>RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>The verse does not state that women can take part in the legislative chamber, this hymn is a Charm to Secure love, the speaker here is a woman who is praying to get back her Husband.</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 7.38.1-2 I dig this Healing Herb that makes my lover look on me and weep; That bids the parting friend return and kindly greets him as he comes.

<p>Atharva Veda 7.38.4-5 &#8220;Not only I desire in this august assembly O husband! but thou also admitted so. Thou then, be exclusively mine and should not and would not talk of other women.

<p>According to Sayana this hymn is a Vashikaran (Black magic) Hymn. According to the Atharva 12.3.52 which the author has quoted says that both the Man and the Woman had spoken falsehood in the assembly,</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 12.3.52 &#8220;O ye men and women! whatever lie you tell in plays, whatever in meeting, and whatever untruth you speak in desiring wealth let all this dirt be left out in the lie or untruth itself. You always dress your self with common dress.&#8221; Tr. Vaidyanath Shastri</p>

<p><strong>MY RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>These verses are not about the dowry of knowledge but the actual dowry which the bride brings to her in laws. The evil roots of Dowry system in India originated from Vedas. There is a detailed article on Dowry in Hinduism written by Mushafiq Sultan <a href="/index.php/2014/01/01/the-menace-of-dowry-and-its-origin/" data-wpel-link="internal">The Menace of Dowry and its Origin</a></p>

<p><strong>MY RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 3.31.1 WISE, teaching, following the thought of Order, the sonless gained a grandson from his daughter. Fain, as a sire, to see his child prolific, he sped to meet her with an eager spirit.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="492" height="350" class="wp-image-7769" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-118.png" alt="http://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/060218_0701_testingresp28.png" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-118.png 492w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-118-300x213.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 492px) 100vw, 492px" /></p>
<p>Rig Veda 3.31.1 &#8220;The disciplined and wise father, relying on the sanction of natural rights, honours his grandson, the son of his daughter, with valuable gifts. The father trusting to the impregnation of the daughter consoles himself with cheerful mind.&#8221; Tr. Satya Prakash Saraswati</p>
<p>This verse shows the eagerness to get a son, this verse is about a man who was sonless and gained a grandson from her daughter. Further this verse no where talks about equal share of property, Pandit jaydev writes in the commentary</p>
<p>&#8220;The grandson shall be the legal heir of his grandfather&#8217;s property&#8221;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="462" height="286" class="wp-image-7770" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-119.png" alt="http://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/060218_0701_testingresp29.png" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-119.png 462w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-119-300x186.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 462px) 100vw, 462px" /></p>
<p>So where is the equal inheritance here? It is more biased, Several question arises from this commentary, Why does a grandson become the heir when the sonless man already has a daughter? Isn&#8217;t there equal inheritance for woman? Why does the Man need to adopt his grandson when he already has a daughter? Swami Dayanand Saraswati says that a sonless Man can contract Niyoga to get sons even if he has a Daughter. Why this partiality against daughters?</p>
<p>And how can Arya Samajis claim that Vedas give inheritance right to women when none of their scripture says? Vedas does not entitle woman to inherit, only the sons enjoys the right of inheritance. The Hindu law is that the women shall not inherit her father&#8217;s property and if the Father is sonless only then his grandson (from his daughter) should inherit his property, as it is recorded in Bhagwad Puran</p>
<p>Bhagwad Puran 10.57.37 &#8220;Since Satrajit had no sons, his daughter&#8217;s sons should receive his inheritance. They should pay for memorial offerings of waler and pinda, clear their grandfather&#8217;s outstanding debts and keep the remainder of the inheritance for themselves.</p>
<p>So if one has a son, then there is no chance for the daughter&#8217;s son to inherit his Grandfather&#8217;s property. For more details read my article <a href="/index.php/2014/05/14/no-inheritance-for-woman-in-vedas/" data-wpel-link="internal">No Inheritance for Women in Vedas</a></p>

<p>Rig ved 10.85.46</p>
<p>Like wise in so many other mantras a woman has been presented to play an essential role in family and as wife. Similarly she has been given the lead stage in society works, in governmental organizations, and for ruling the nation is also mentioned in Vedas.</p>
<p>(Book: Vagambhraniya, Author: Dr Priyamvada Vedbharti)</p>
<p>Rigevda contains several Suktas containing description of Usha as a God. <strong>This Usha is representation of an ideal woman</strong>. Please refer &#8220;Usha Devata&#8221; by Pt Sri Pad Damodar Satvalekar as part of &#8220;Simple Translation of Rigveda (Rigved ka subodh bhashya)&#8221;. Page 121 to 147 for summary of all such verses spread across entire Rigveda. In summary:</p>
<p>Women should be brave (Page 122, 128)</p>
<p>Women should be expert (Page 122)</p>
<p>Women should earn fame (Page 123)</p>
<p>Women should ride on chariots (Page 123)</p>

<p>Women should be illuminating (Page 137)</p>
<p>Women should be provider of wealth, food and prosperity (Page 141- 146)</p>
<p><strong>MY RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>This is what the writer is trying to do in the whole article, when he can&#8217;t find any verse which praises women, he just twisted the verses attributed to Hindu Goddesses and said it speaks about common Women. All those verses are prayers to Vedic Godesses, they doesn&#8217;t praise common women. This translation is not fully correct. Usha was physically assaulted in Veda, I&#8217; am using Shri Ram Acharya&#8217;s Hindi translation for this verse below,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 4.30.8-11 And this heroic deed of might thou, Indra, also hast achieved, That thou didst smite to death the Dame, Heaven&#8217;s Daughter, meditating ill. Thou, Indra, Mighty One, didst crush Usas, though Daughter of the Sky. When lifting up herself in pride.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="576" height="156" class="wp-image-7772" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-121.png" alt="http://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/060218_0701_testingresp31.png" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-121.png 576w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-121-300x81.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px" /></p>
<p>According to some scholars Indra raped Usha, while according to others this is an allegorical verse and has a different meaning. However I&#8217; am not talking about the context of this verse, the purpose is only to show that Usha does not represent the &#8220;Ideal Woman&#8221; in Vedas as the author claims. Usha is a goddess representing the sky and is considered the daughter of the sky. So my question to the author is If Usha represents the Ideal Woman then why did Indra (sometime translated as Ideal Man by Arya Samaj) assault Usha? Who is the ideal person here? Moreover this verse also gives a wrong impression of physical abuse on women.</p>
<p>As far as the verse Rigved 12.85.46 is concerned, the term Usha is not mentioned there, it&#8217;s referring to bride. He did not show the reason as to why the woman is getting special treatment, whole context can be understood by reading previous verses,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.85.42-45 … With sons and grandsons sport and play, rejoicing in your own abode. …Not inauspicious enter thou thy husband&#8217;s house … Loving the Gods, delightful, bearing sons [Hero]… O Bounteous Indra, make this bride blest in her sons and fortunate. Vouchsafe to her ten sons, and make her husband the eleventh man.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="426" height="251" class="wp-image-7773" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-122.png" alt="http://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/060218_0701_testingresp32.png" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-122.png 426w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-122-300x177.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 426px) 100vw, 426px" /></p>
<p>This verse prays for begetting 10 sons but doesn&#8217;t state anything about birth of even one daughter. This verse is about the bride and is recited before the bride enters the house. And the evils of this hymn is that this hymn of Rig Veda Mandal 10 Sukt 85 is about Dowry, where the bride brings wealth with her. Status of Women in Hinduism is no better than a prisoner, Read the articles to know about the position of Women in Vedas/Hinduism</p>

<h1><a name="_Toc397162572"></a>A background to Swami Dayananda Saraswati (1824-1883)</h1>
<p>The aim of this article is to present the salient features of Swami Dayananda Saraswati’s (1824-1883) religious philosophy, which is characterised by religious <em>fundamentalism</em>, <em>anti-other</em> attitude and <em>militancy</em>. In Dayananda we have the first stirrings of Hindu fundamentalism in modern India. Unfortunately, this aspect often goes camouflaged under the aura of his greatness as a champion of Hinduism and a social reformer.<br />
Anyone familiar with the ‘Indian Renaissance’ of the 19th century will immediately be reminded of the ‘luminous’ figure of Swami Dayananda Saraswati the Hindu social reformer and the founder of the Arya Samaj (‘Noble Society’). He is considered as the ‘first Hindu’ in the nineteenth century to study and discuss Other religions (i.e. non-Vedic faiths). In fact, some twenty years prior to the World Parliament of Religions in Chicago in 1893, in which Swami Vivekananda participated, Dayananda organised a conference in Delhi and invited representatives from all religions. In this, he was well ahead of the other thinkers of the time<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" class="broken_link">[1]</a>.<br />
Dayananda (originally known as Mulasankar) was born in a Brahmin family at Tankara, in Gujarat in 1824, and was raised up as an orthodox Saivite. He spent fifteen years as a wandering monk in search of personal salvation. In 1860 he met Swami Vrijananda of Mathura, a great Vedic scholar and grammarian who became his teacher and mentor. It was Swami Vrijananda who drew the attention of his pupil to the degenerated state of Hinduism. In addition, he implanted in him a great veneration for the ancient Vedas as the true source of pure Hinduism. For the rest of his life Dayananda taught in almost all parts of India on the exclusive truth of the Vedas. He also founded the Arya Samaj in 1875, which loomed large on the intellectual and social scene of late nineteenth century Northern India<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" class="broken_link">[2]</a>.<br />
Dayananda authored numerous books, tracts and pamphlets<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" class="broken_link">[3]</a>. However, it is above all in his <em>Satyartha Prakash</em> (<em>The Light of Truth</em>, 1875, 1884)<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" class="broken_link">[4]</a> – considered as his <em>magnum opus</em> – that he expounds ‘systematically’ and with extraordinary clarity his fully developed philosophy of religion. Other important writings of Dayananda include, <em>Rigvedadi Bhasya Bhumika </em>(<em>Introduction to the Commentary on the Vedas</em>)<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a> and <em>Rishi Dayananda Saraswati ke Patra aur Vijnapan </em>(<em>A Collection of Letters and Notes Written by Dayananda</em>)<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>.</p>
<h1><a name="_Toc397162573"></a>1. The ideological foundations of Dayananda Saraswati</h1>
<p>In order to understand the attitude of Dayananda Saraswati towards other religions, it is necessary that we examine his ideological foundations. Dayananda emphatically affirmed that the Vedic religion is the only true faith revealed by God. This view is so central to his religious philosophy that one cannot understand his attitude towards other religions without it.<br />
<em>Satyartha Prakash</em> first appeared in 1875 in Hindi. It consisted of eleven chapters and in the first ten a complete statement of his ideas on various subjects are presented. The eleventh chapter which runs to a quarter of the book, is devoted to a critique of Hinduism, dealing with idol worship, miracles, pilgrimages, holy men, sects, <em>Puranas</em>, etc. Towards the end of his life he thoroughly revised this edition and added three more chapters dealing with Carvaka, Buddhism and Jainism which are religions of Indian origin, and Christianity and Islam which, according to him, are foreign faiths. This edition was published in 1884, though its proof reading was finished before Dayananda&#8217;s death in 1883. A comparative study of the two editions revels that Dayananda radically changed some of his earlier ideas during the last years of his life<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>. Thus the revised edition contains more ‘systematic’ and fully developed ideas than the previous one with a criticism of all the major religions of India. This is also the work accepted by the Arya Samaj as the authorised edition.<br />
Dayananda in his writings makes five outstanding claims that determine his attitude towards other religions: i) the Vedic Religion alone is true and infallible and it is revealed by God<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" class="broken_link">[8]</a>; ii) the Vedic Religion alone existed in the whole world and all believed in it till 5000 years ago<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" class="broken_link">[9]</a>; iii) all the extant religions of the world originated in India and are derived from the Vedas<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" class="broken_link">[10]</a>; iv) all knowledge including all sciences spread to other countries from India, first to Egypt, then to Greece from there to Europe and finally to America and other countries<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" class="broken_link">[11]</a>; v) the Aryans were the sovereign rulers of the whole earth till the <em>Mahabharata</em> war and they professed the Vedic Religion<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" class="broken_link">[12]</a>.</p>
<h1><a name="_Toc397162574"></a>1.1 The exclusive truth of the Vedic Religion</h1>
<p>Dayananda starts from the premise that God is the eternal source of all knowledge and He reveals it to man through the Vedas and had He not revealed, there would have been no knowledge<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" class="broken_link">[13]</a>. According to him, the Vedas give general teachings meant for <em>all</em> mankind<a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" class="broken_link">[14]</a>. This led him to maintain that, in the Vedas alone and not in any other work has God revealed the truth. Hence he claimed that what the Vedas expound are the truth and nothing but the truth<a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a>. Since the Vedas alone are the supreme authority in ascertaining true religion whatever is enjoined by the Vedas is to be considered to be right, while whatever is condemned by them is to be wrong. He says: “nothing should be accepted which is against the Vedas”<a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" class="broken_link">[16]</a>. He also argues that the Vedic revelation is synchronous with man’s first appearance on earth so that the Vedas becomes the first book of humanity<a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a>. The consequence was that he made <em>the Vedas the standard of reference for all truth,</em> both religious and otherwise. Thus for Dayananda, the Vedas contain religious truth as well as every form of truth, <em>even scientific truths</em><a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a>. Later, Aurobindo Ghose commenting on this, not only agreed with Dayananda but also argued that the latter had rather understated than overstated the depth and range of the Vedic wisdom<a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" class="broken_link">[19]</a>.<br />
Dayananda further argued that the Vedas are also infallible and that they are absolutely free from error<a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" class="broken_link">[20]</a>. Truth and knowledge, wherever they are found, are derived from the Vedas. He says: “It is to be borne in mind that wherever and whatever truth is to be found it has proceeded from the Vedas and all untruth has its origin outside them and has not proceeded from God”<a href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" class="broken_link">[21]</a>. He also stated that the Vedas are eternal just as God is eternal<a href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22">[22]</a>. This amounts to maintaining that there can be <em>only one true religion</em>, and that religion is the one that is based on and derived from the Vedas. In other words, Dayananda was affirming the <em>exclusive truth</em> of the Vedic religion.<br />
Dayananda then set out to provide proofs for the truth of the Vedic faith. <em>First</em>, the Vedas consistently proclaim pure <em>monotheism</em>, which alone can rationally be sustained. In the Vedas there are not many gods but one God. The multitude of names signify not different Divine beings, but different aspects of one Supreme Being<a href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23">[23]</a>. <em>Second</em>, the truth of the Vedic faith is that, it is the most <em>rational</em> religion because in it there is nothing that offends reason. In a letter to Colonel Olcott, Dayananda affirms that the true religion is expounded in that eternal Vedas practiced by the wise in conformity with reason<a href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24">[24]</a>. <em>Third</em>, the Vedic Religion is the true religion because <em>morality</em> lies at the very basis of it. According to Dayananda, there is nothing in the Vedas that offends morality. In reality, righteous conduct consists in rejecting all that is opposed to the Vedas, and in practicing whatever has been enjoined by them<a href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" class="broken_link">[25]</a>. <em>Fourth</em>, the Vedic Religion is the true religion because it is <em>universal</em>. It is meant for all time – past, present and future ― for all places, and for all people<a href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26">[26]</a>. H.Coward notes: “Dayananda made Hinduism a religion of the book by adopting the Protestant principle of <em>sola scriptura</em> [only scripture] and applying it to the Vedas<a href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" class="broken_link">[27]</a>. Dayananda also maintained that Sanskrit is the language in which the Vedas are revealed. Sanskrit belongs to no country but is the source of all languages and all peoples<a href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28">[28]</a>.</p>
<h1><a name="_Toc397162575"></a>1.2 Plurality of religions is unnecessary</h1>
<p>Dayananda was one of the Hindu thinkers of the 19<sup>th</sup> century who paid serious attention to the problem of the relationship between different religions. He maintained that in essence, there are only four main non-Vedic or ‘Other’ religions, namely, Pauranikas, Christians, Jains and Moslims. These cover all sects<a href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" class="broken_link">[29]</a>. According to J.T.F. Jordens, Dayananda began to think of Hinduism in relation to other religions only after his visit to Calcutta in 1873 where he met the leaders of the Brahma Samaj who were much influenced by the teachings of Christianity and Islam, and this led him to consider Hinduism in a wider context of these religions<a href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" class="broken_link">[30]</a>.<br />
Dayananda bewailed the plurality of religions because of their mutual hatred and strife. According to him, often, he who is prejudiced try to prove that his untruth is truth while the truth of his opponent is untruth<a href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31">[31]</a>. He believed that in the midst of conflicting truth-claims of religions, it is the duty of everyone to discover and to embrace what is true and reject what is false<a href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" class="broken_link">[32]</a>. Hence he dedicated much energy to the study of other religions both through discussion with their teachers and by studying them from the original sources.<br />
It has been argued by many that it is necessary to have a plurality of religions because people differ in their nature, temperament, character and level of spirituality. Therefore, there is need for a diversity of religions, because there can never be one religion that suits the needs of all mankind. But Dayananda was not convinced of this argument. He also rejected another popular view that all religions are good and therefore, it is not proper to criticise any one of them<a href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33">[33]</a>. According to him, they contain untruth and falsity<a href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34">[34]</a>. Hence, for Dayananda, there was no need for a plurality of religions because only one among the many religions can be true, and for him, the one true faith is the Vedic Religion<a href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" class="broken_link">[35]</a>. Therefore, diversity of religions is unnecessary as they are <em>products of ignorance and false beliefs</em><a href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36">[36]</a></p>
<h1><a name="_Toc397162576"></a>1.3 Religions other than the Vedic faith are false</h1>
<p>In maintaining that the Vedic Religion alone is true, Dayananda is emphatically asserting that all other religions are false. In his <em>Satyartha Prakash</em> he often refers to them as ‘false beliefs’<a href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" class="broken_link">[37]</a>. When the Aryans gave up the Vedic literature which alone could help people to distinguish between truth and untruth, ignorance prevailed and many anti-Vedic religions, cults and sects sprang up<a href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" class="broken_link">[38]</a>. He argued that, the founders and teachers of them, even if they knew the truth, did not teach it, because they feared that they would lose their followers and their means of livelihood. The religious teachers who do not advocate the Vedic faith are hypocrites, defrauders and tricksters. He says: “All these cults are an outcome of ignorance and antagonistic to learning. They mislead the foolish, low and uncivilised people into their net to serve their own ends”<a href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39">[39]</a>. Thus Dayananda considered all religions, except the Vedic faith, as false. He observes: “there ought to be only one right religion [.…] We have been all along emphasising this point”<a href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40">[40]</a>.<br />
Dayananda claims that there was a time in the ancient past since the beginning of the world when only one religion prevailed in the world, and that was the Vedic Religion. This religion was taught everywhere in the world and all firmly believed in it. As a result, peace and happiness reigned everywhere. But this state of perfect harmony was disrupted 5000 years ago when the Great War of the Mahabharata broke out in which most of the learned men, sages and seers were killed. As a consequence, the study of the Vedas and other true sciences disappeared, the light of knowledge grew dim, and with it the dissemination of Vedic Religion also came to an end<a href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41" class="broken_link">[41]</a>. Thus in the place of the true religion of the Vedas, many <em>false religions</em> came into being.</p>
<h1><a name="_Toc397162577"></a>1.4 Other religions <em>may</em> contain elements of truth</h1>
<p>If all non-Vedic religions are false and products of ignorance, there arises the question whether there is any truth at all in them. Dayananda admitted that some religions contain <em>elements of truth</em>. In fact on certain occasions he says that he accepts whatever is true in all religions<a href="#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42">[42]</a>. In the introduction to the <em>Satyartha Prakash</em> he admits that there are undoubtedly many learned men among the followers of every religion<a href="#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43">[43]</a>. There are also certain universal truths found in all religions. These truths are those in which they all agree with each other, and in whatever they differ with each other is false and therefore they are to be <em>rejected</em><a href="#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44" class="broken_link">[44]</a>.<br />
However, a reading of the <em>Satyartha Prakash</em> as a whole gives us a different picture. Even though there may be elements of truth in other religions, that does not make them worthy of acceptance, for two reasons: first, whatever truth is found in them is derived from the Vedas. Dayananda says: “Wherever and whatever truth is to be found has proceeded from the Vedas”<a href="#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45">[45]</a>. It follows then that, since there is the totality of truth in the Vedas there is no need to follow any other religion which may have only elements of truth. Therefore, whoever sincerely seeks the truth, must embrace the Vedic Religion<a href="#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46" class="broken_link">[46]</a>. Secondly, the truth that is found in other religions is mixed with untruths, like the best food mixed with poison. Hence they are to be <em>rejected</em><a href="#_ftn47" name="_ftnref47" class="broken_link">[47]</a>.</p>
<h1><a name="_Toc397162578"></a>1.5 Criticism of popular Hinduism</h1>
<p>One of the major concerns of Dayananda was to regenerate Hinduism by purifying it from such corrupted beliefs and practices as polytheism, idolatry, animal sacrifices, priestly privilege of the Brahmins, worship of popular deities, long pilgrimages, ritual ablutions, etc. He argued that the <em>Puranas</em> and the <em>Tantras</em> and other ‘new scriptures which supported and encouraged such beliefs are to be abandoned<a href="#_ftn48" name="_ftnref48">[48]</a>. So he rejected these texts as concocted by hypocritical and selfish priests to deceive the ignorant masses. Chapter XI of the <em>Satyartha Prakash</em> is particularly dedicated to a critical analysis of the sects and cults of Hinduism<a href="#_ftn49" name="_ftnref49">[49]</a>.<br />
Dayananda insisted that the study of the Vedas should be open to all, including <em>Shudras</em>, and not just to the Brahmins alone<a href="#_ftn50" name="_ftnref50">[50]</a>. He argued that nobody becomes a Brahmin simply because he is born of Brahmin parents<a href="#_ftn51" name="_ftnref51">[51]</a>. If God revealed the Vedas only for them, then He is to be regarded as partial and prejudiced and this would imperil God’s justice<a href="#_ftn52" name="_ftnref52" class="broken_link">[52]</a>. Therefore, he advocated that God has revealed the Vedas for all and that all men and women – i.e. the whole mankind – have a right to study them<a href="#_ftn53" name="_ftnref53" class="broken_link">[53]</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li>S Daniel opines that Dayananda’s harsh condemnation of Hinduism was aimed at its regeneration for which he urged the Hindus to ‘go back to the Vedas’<a href="#_ftn54" name="_ftnref54">[54]</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1><a name="_Toc397162579"></a>1.6 Jainism is the most dreadful religion</h1>
<p>In Chapter XII of <em>Satyartha Prakash</em> Dayananda treats Carvacas, Buddhists and Jains as typical anti-Vedic religions<a href="#_ftn55" name="_ftnref55" class="broken_link">[55]</a> and the atheistic cults of India<a href="#_ftn56" name="_ftnref56">[56]</a>. However, it is against Jainism that he directed much of his criticism. According to Dayananda, the Jains were prejudiced against and hostile towards the non-Jains. He argued that there is no religion which enjoins so much hostility towards people belonging to other faiths as Jainism<a href="#_ftn57" name="_ftnref57" class="broken_link">[57]</a>. He also called Jainism the most dreadful religion, the founders and followers of which are in dense ignorance. Even their <em>Tirthankaras</em> were ignorant and their teachers were devoid of knowledge. He says: “Your <em>Tirthankaras</em> had no conception of truth, otherwise they would not have written such nonsense. As are your teachers so are your disciples”<a href="#_ftn58" name="_ftnref58" class="broken_link">[58]</a>. Further, the Jaina scriptures are full of stories that delude people<a href="#_ftn59" name="_ftnref59">[59]</a>.<br />
In this way, Dayananda presented the Jains as biased, perverse, ignorant and enemies of truth and upright living. He says: “all Jaina saints, family men and <em>Tirthankaras</em> including [… are] given to prostitution, adultery, theft and other evils [….] He who will associate with them will get same sort of evils in his heart also”<a href="#_ftn60" name="_ftnref60">[60]</a>; “Therefore we say that the Jains are drowned in the hell of condemnative [sic] and religious bigotry”<a href="#_ftn61" name="_ftnref61" class="broken_link">[61]</a>.</p>
<h1><a name="_Toc397162580"></a>1.7 Islam is the religion of the uncivilised and the ignorant</h1>
<p>Dayananda conceived Islam as a real threat to the existence of Hinduism and dedicated much space in discussing it<a href="#_ftn62" name="_ftnref62" class="broken_link">[62]</a>. He considered Islam as the religion of the uncivilised and the ignorant and wondered how the ancient people of Arabia accepted a religion of the kind<a href="#_ftn63" name="_ftnref63">[63]</a>. According to Dayananda, the <em>Quoran</em> (<em>Koran</em>) is the product of a mind destitute of all knowledge of God. He says: “Quoran is not made by God. It might have been written by some deceitful and fraudulent person”<a href="#_ftn64" name="_ftnref64">[64]</a>. He further argued that the <em>Quoran</em> causes rebellion and destroys peace<a href="#_ftn65" name="_ftnref65" class="broken_link">[65]</a>. It is full of errors, distortions and contains all untruth, and even the little truth it contains is distorted<a href="#_ftn66" name="_ftnref66">[66]</a> and therefore it is to be considered as a great hoax<a href="#_ftn67" name="_ftnref67" class="broken_link">[67]</a>. He also held that Mohammed was not a pious man<a href="#_ftn68" name="_ftnref68" class="broken_link">[68]</a> but a quarrelsome<a href="#_ftn69" name="_ftnref69" class="broken_link">[69]</a>, immoral and self indulgent person<a href="#_ftn70" name="_ftnref70" class="broken_link">[70]</a>. Further, the God of Islam incites the prophet and the Muslims to fight against non-Muslims<a href="#_ftn71" name="_ftnref71" class="broken_link">[71]</a>.<br />
Therefore, Dayananda concluded that he who believes that the <em>Quoran</em> is revealed, that Mohammad is a prophet, and that Mohammadan God to be omniscient, just and merciful would be a perfect idiot. He says: “this book [<em>Quoran</em>] is neither God’s revelation nor the work of any learned man, nor a book of knowledge”<a href="#_ftn72" name="_ftnref72" class="broken_link">[72]</a>; “the Quoran, the Quoranic God and the Moselms are full of bigotry and ignorance”<a href="#_ftn73" name="_ftnref73" class="broken_link">[73]</a>; “the noble qualities of justice, mercy, etc. remain at a distance from the God of Moslems”<a href="#_ftn74" name="_ftnref74">[74]</a>. Therefore, it is not true that the believers of the <em>Quoran</em> are on the right path<a href="#_ftn75" name="_ftnref75" class="broken_link">[75]</a>. In addition, all through its history Islam has been intolerant of followers of other religions<a href="#_ftn76" name="_ftnref76" class="broken_link">[76]</a>. Thus, Dayananda maintained that, Islam is a <em>false religion</em> which does harm to mankind, and therefore, it is to be <em>rejected</em> and the Vedic faith is to be accepted by all<a href="#_ftn77" name="_ftnref77">[77]</a>.</p>
<h1><a name="_Toc397162581"></a>1.8 Christianity is a religion of the book</h1>
<p>Sumit Sarkar says that the polemics with the most far-reaching and long lasting consequences against non-Vedic religions was undoubtedly launched by Dayananda in Chapter XIII of <em>Satyartha</em> <em>Prakash</em> where he deals with Christianity<a href="#_ftn78" name="_ftnref78" class="broken_link">[78]</a>.<br />
Dayananda treated Christianity as a religion of the book – the ‘religion of the Bible’<a href="#_ftn79" name="_ftnref79">[79]</a>. Hence his study of the Christian religion was confined exclusively to the Bible. His conviction was that, the claims of Christianity stand or fall with the Bible because the Christians believe that it is the revealed Word of God. If it is proved that the Bible is not the Word of God, then the whole foundation of Christianity as a religion collapses. Therefore, the main concern of Dayananda was to show that the Bible is <em>not</em> the Word of God but a human composition and that it combines many things that need to be condemned.</p>
<h1><a name="_Toc397162582"></a>1.8.1 Christianity is a degraded religion</h1>
<p>Since 1880s Dayananda was seriously engaged in combating Christianity. He used methods like, street debates, re-conversion ceremony (<em>shuddhi</em>), publication of tracts and pamphlets. He sent members of his Arya Samaj (samajits) to organise fairs against the preaching of the Christian missionaries. Thus a battle of words went on between both sides especially through their publications in the form of tracts and pamphlets, the contents of which often sunk to the level of insults, calumny and maligning the other. For example, Dayananda writes: “It appears that Mary conceived through some man, and either he or somebody else gave it out that the conception was through God”<a href="#_ftn80" name="_ftnref80" class="broken_link">[80]</a>; “Hullo Jesus! What science told you that stars will fall.[…] Had Jesus a little education he would have known that the stars are worlds and cannot fall down”<a href="#_ftn81" name="_ftnref81" class="broken_link">[81]</a>; “Marriages are performed in the paradise of the Christians. It was there that God celebrated the marriage of Jesus Christ. Let us ask who were his father-in-law, mother-in-law, brother-in-law etc?”<a href="#_ftn82" name="_ftnref82">[82]</a>. Dayananda wrote that the appellation ‘Pope’ means those persons who are hypocrites and accomplish their selfish ends by cheating others<a href="#_ftn83" name="_ftnref83" class="broken_link">[83]</a> and that the Popes get themselves and their feet worshipped<a href="#_ftn84" name="_ftnref84" class="broken_link">[84]</a>.<br />
Dayananda also attacked Christianity by identifying it with the West, by attempting to refute its claims of religious, moral and cultural superiority, and by asserting the religious and the cultural degradation of Christianity and the superiority of the Vedas.</p>
<h1><a name="_Toc397162583"></a>1.8.2 The God of the Bible is wicked</h1>
<p>Dayananda argued that the God of the Bible is unjust<a href="#_ftn85" name="_ftnref85" class="broken_link">[85]</a>, cruel<a href="#_ftn86" name="_ftnref86" class="broken_link">[86]</a>, jealous<a href="#_ftn87" name="_ftnref87" class="broken_link">[87]</a>, a flesh-eater<a href="#_ftn88" name="_ftnref88" class="broken_link">[88]</a>, destitute of mercy<a href="#_ftn89" name="_ftnref89" class="broken_link">[89]</a>, malicious<a href="#_ftn90" name="_ftnref90" class="broken_link">[90]</a> and an ignorant savage<a href="#_ftn91" name="_ftnref91">[91]</a>. He is temperamental, emotional and subject to passions. He is jealous, immoral and limited by space and time. He is also responsible for innumerable evil deeds. He says: “The God of Christians behaves exactly like a man”<a href="#_ftn92" name="_ftnref92">[92]</a>. Therefore, Dayananda concludes that such a being can never be considered as God and he is not even equal to a learned yogin<a href="#_ftn93" name="_ftnref93" class="broken_link">[93]</a>. Commenting on Gen. 30, 22-23 which says that God ‘opened’ the womb of Rachel who was barren he says cynically: “Well done! O God of Christians! What a great surgeon you are! What instruments or medicines did you use in opening the wombs of women?”<a href="#_ftn94" name="_ftnref94" class="broken_link">[94]</a>.<br />
Dayananda further stated that the God of the Bible is not omniscient, for had he been so, he would not have created Satan because he would have known that Satan would tempt man to commit sin<a href="#_ftn95" name="_ftnref95">[95]</a>. Again, had he been an all-knowing being, he would have known Abel’s death without inquiring from Cain, ‘Where is thy brother?’<a href="#_ftn96" name="_ftnref96" class="broken_link">[96]</a>. Further, if he had been omniscient he would have been able to find out all about the firmness of Abraham’s faith without tempting him to sacrifice his son Isaac<a href="#_ftn97" name="_ftnref97" class="broken_link">[97]</a>.</p>
<h1><a name="_Toc397162584"></a>1.8.3 The Bible contains statements that offend reason</h1>
<p>Dayananda claimed that the Bible contains statements that offend reason, logic, science and laws of nature. He rejected such beliefs as the birth of Jesus from a virgin, his resurrection from the dead, etc., as impossible and opposed to the laws of nature<a href="#_ftn98" name="_ftnref98">[98]</a>. He also condemned all miracles of Jesus as superstitions, irrational, impossible and a hoax<a href="#_ftn99" name="_ftnref99">[99]</a>.<br />
According to Dayananda, the Bible displays a crude ignorance of scientific knowledge<a href="#_ftn100" name="_ftnref100" class="broken_link">[100]</a>. He argued that self-contradictory statements abound in the Bible. For example, while it is said in many places in the Bible that sins will be forgiven, it also says that each one will be rewarded or punished according to one’s deeds<a href="#_ftn101" name="_ftnref101">[101]</a>. He contested that sin can never be forgiven because it will imperil God’s justice, and His justice demands that each person should receive the reward or punishment according to his or her deeds. Again, the belief that a person will be punished or rewarded eternally cannot be logically sustained because the finite action of finite souls cannot produce infinite results<a href="#_ftn102" name="_ftnref102" class="broken_link">[102]</a>.</p>
<h1><a name="_Toc397162585"></a>1.8.4 The Bible contains immoral and cruel stories</h1>
<p>Dayananda argued that the Bible contains many stories and precepts that are immoral and cruel. Some of the stories that are morally repulsive and give licence to immorality and cruelty are, the visit of God to Sarah making her to conceive<a href="#_ftn103" name="_ftnref103" class="broken_link">[103]</a>, Mary’s conception by the Holy Spirit<a href="#_ftn104" name="_ftnref104" class="broken_link">[104]</a>, the killing of the first born in Egypt<a href="#_ftn105" name="_ftnref105" class="broken_link">[105]</a>, accounts of animal sacrifice and beef-eating<a href="#_ftn106" name="_ftnref106">[106]</a> and the like. The doctrine of the remission of sin through repentance, which besides being irrational, is also unjust as it encourages people to commit sin, because if repentance absolves one from sin, nobody would be afraid of committing sin and thus there would be an increase in sinfulness in the world<a href="#_ftn107" name="_ftnref107" class="broken_link">[107]</a>. Belief in immaculate conception could lead to loss of control over women, and any virgin who happened to conceive can claim that she conceived through God.<br />
Dayananda alleged that Christianity taught not only sacrifice in the Old Testament but also cannibalism in the New Testament. For example, the Christians eat and drink the body and blood of Christ imagining all the time that their bread and their drink are the flesh and the blood of Christ, respectively, and they call it the ‘Lord’s supper’<a href="#_ftn108" name="_ftnref108">[108]</a>.</p>
<h1><a name="_Toc397162586"></a>1.8.5 The Bible can never be the Word of God</h1>
<p>The conclusion that Dayananda arrived at after his so-called study of the Bible was that, it cannot be the Word of God because it is full of absurdities, and its authors are ignorant savages. He says: “Therefore, your Bible is not God-revealed”<a href="#_ftn109" name="_ftnref109" class="broken_link">[109]</a>; “the Bible is a human composition and not a revelation of God”<a href="#_ftn110" name="_ftnref110">[110]</a>; “Their Bible has many things which are condemnable. […] With the exception of a few things all else is untrue. As the contact of falsehood makes the truth also impure, similarly the Bible is also not acceptable”<a href="#_ftn111" name="_ftnref111">[111]</a>.<br />
It is evident that Dayananda misinterprets Christianity and the Christian teachings. He does not really enter into the spirit of the Bible. He makes a literal reading of it and is prejudiced by his <em>a priori</em> assumptions. He also resorts to the study of Christianity exclusively from the Bible since he judges Bible alone to be the source of the Christian faith<a href="#_ftn112" name="_ftnref112" class="broken_link">[112]</a>, and is convinced that Christianity stands or falls with the Bible<a href="#_ftn113" name="_ftnref113" class="broken_link">[113]</a>. Thus Dayananda carefully chose biblical passages in order to present a demonic Christianity.</p>
<h1><a name="_Toc397162587"></a>1.8.6 Jesus Christ was a savage and a hoax</h1>
<p>According to Dayananda, Jesus Christ was one who talked nonsense like a wild savage<a href="#_ftn114" name="_ftnref114">[114]</a>, destitute of knowledge and understanding. P.S. Daniel observes: “The term ‘barbarous’ or ‘savage’ is repeatedly used over twenty-five times applying them to Christians, their God and their scriptures (the Bible)”<a href="#_ftn115" name="_ftnref115">[115]</a>. Dayananda spoke of the ignorance and foolishness of Jesus Christ and argued that Jesus was not a seer, that he was not even an enlightened person. He says: “Had Jesus got even a little education, he should not have said such nonsense. […] The presence of Jesus was a great thing in a country of uneducated savages”<a href="#_ftn116" name="_ftnref116" class="broken_link">[116]</a>. He then claimed that Mary the mother of Jesus was not a chaste woman<a href="#_ftn117" name="_ftnref117">[117]</a> and that the Bible abounded in absurdities and therefore could be the work of an enlightened man. All Christian missionaries say that Jesus was a very calm and peace loving person. But in reality he was a hot-tempered persons destitute of knowledge and who behaved like a wild savage<a href="#_ftn118" name="_ftnref118" class="broken_link">[118]</a>. This shows that Jesus was neither the son of God, nor had he any miraculous powers<a href="#_ftn119" name="_ftnref119" class="broken_link">[119]</a>. He did not possess the power to forgive sins<a href="#_ftn120" name="_ftnref120">[120]</a>. The righteous people do not stand in need of any mediator like Jesus<a href="#_ftn121" name="_ftnref121" class="broken_link">[121]</a>. Jesus came to spread discord which is going on everywhere in the world<a href="#_ftn122" name="_ftnref122">[122]</a>. Therefore, it is evident that the hoax of Christ’s being the Son of God, the knower of the past and the future, the forgiver of sin, has been set up falsely by his disciples. In reality, he was a very ordinary ignorant man, neither learned nor a yogi<a href="#_ftn123" name="_ftnref123" class="broken_link">[123]</a>. He was a mere carpenter’s son, living in a wild and poor country.</p>
<h1><a name="_Toc397162588"></a>1.8.7 Christianity is a religion of fools and barbarians</h1>
<p>Dayananda’s so-called study of Christianity lead him to condemn Christianity as a shallow, barbarous, false and foreign religion, believed only by fools and barbarians. He presented all the prophets of the Christians from Moses onwards as uncivilised and devoid of culture<a href="#_ftn124" name="_ftnref124" class="broken_link">[124]</a>. He spoke of the ‘trap’ and ‘mesh’ of the Christian religion and the ‘net’ of the Christian missionaries, and asked everybody to escape it<a href="#_ftn125" name="_ftnref125" class="broken_link">[125]</a>. He then went on to claim that only wild savages believed in Jesus and his only achievements are dissentions and discords<a href="#_ftn126" name="_ftnref126" class="broken_link">[126]</a>.<br />
The Christians are educated to a great extent. But political considerations and obstinacy do not allow them to forsake their <em>hollow religion</em> and be open to the Vedic faith<a href="#_ftn127" name="_ftnref127" class="broken_link">[127]</a>. Dayananda states: “the Bible is not God-revealed, nor its God good, nor its followers religious”<a href="#_ftn128" name="_ftnref128" class="broken_link">[128]</a>. Therefore he exhorts the Christians: “Hear O Christians, it is high time that you should leave this <em>wild religion</em> and accept the Vedic faith”<a href="#_ftn129" name="_ftnref129">[129]</a>.<br />
Benjamin Walker remarks that, in spite of Dayananda’s vigorous denunciation of Christianity, he borrowed many ideas from it. The foundation of such organisations as the Arya Tract Society, Women’s Arya Samaj, Young Men’s Arya Samaj, the Vedic Salvation Army, and his schools, colleges, orphanages , widows’ homes and relief centres were due to direct Christian inspiration. Besides, the Arya Samaja rites include Sunday worship, the reading, preaching and teaching of the Vedas<a href="#_ftn130" name="_ftnref130">[130]</a>.</p>
<h1><a name="_Toc397162589"></a>2. Dayananda’s militant attitude towards other religions</h1>
<p>Dayananda was a militant Hindu who could not tolerate any religion other than the Vedic. With him tolerance gave way to militancy. In 1877-1878 he visited Punjab and there he discovered for himself the threat Hinduism was facing from the proselytising activities of the Christian missionaries and Muslim teachers, and this made him denounce these religions<a href="#_ftn131" name="_ftnref131" class="broken_link">[131]</a>. G.S.Saxena says: “The views of Swami Dayananda were radical and militant”<a href="#_ftn132" name="_ftnref132" class="broken_link">[132]</a>. P.S. Daniel observes that if Dayananda was militant, it was, to certain extent because he had two militant religions to counteract, namely, Christianity and Islam<a href="#_ftn133" name="_ftnref133" class="broken_link">[133]</a>.<br />
Lala Lajpat Rai acknowledged the militant nature of the Arya Samaj which Dayananda founded. He says: “The Arya Samaj is militant, not only externally ― i.e., in its attitude towards other religions ― but it is equally militant internally”<a href="#_ftn134" name="_ftnref134">[134]</a>. M.G.Chitkara, says: “Dayananda carried war into the opponents camp and was the first, after centuries of abject passivity, to take offensive against the Christian Missionaries and others”<a href="#_ftn135" name="_ftnref135">[135]</a>. The aggressive attitude of Dayananda gave a new self-confidence to the Hindus and acted as a bulwark against the proselytising activities of the Christian missionaries and the Muslims<a href="#_ftn136" name="_ftnref136">[136]</a>.<br />
Dayananda’s militant response to non-Vedic religions had already produced a most dangerous effect in India. It had increased the hostility between the Hindus (Arya Samajists) and other religious communities ever since its foundation. Dayananda’s method of attacking other religions through polemic literature, public lectures, educational institutions, proselytisation through re-conversion (<em>shuddhi</em>) became strong weapons in the hands of Arya Samajists. This was one of the important factors which led to the outbreak especially of Hindu-Muslim communal riots that continued to recur in many parts of India<a href="#_ftn137" name="_ftnref137" class="broken_link">[137]</a>.</p>
<h1><a name="_Toc397162590"></a>2.1 Polemical style of writing</h1>
<p>Dayananda wrote extensively in the form of books, pamphlets, tracts and letters but most of them were polemic in nature. In fact a part of his <em>Satyartha Prakash</em> was banned for a time in some parts of India because of its fundamentalist and militant nature. Romain Rolland says that Dayananda “thundered against all forms of thought other than his own, the only true one”<a href="#_ftn138" name="_ftnref138" class="broken_link">[138]</a>. A.L. Basham says that Hinduism took offensive for the first time for centuries in Dayananda. He was also a mighty fighter in the cause of the ‘Church’ he founded and made fierce polemic speeches against its opponents<a href="#_ftn139" name="_ftnref139">[139]</a>.<br />
Commenting on the writings of Dayananda, H.Coward notes that his reading of the texts of other religions was always more polemic than scholarly in style. Passages would be selected for criticism where points of logical inconstancy or moral weakness could be shown. Much of this was motivated towards the winning of public debates or private theological discussions, rather than the ideal of dispassionate search for truth<a href="#_ftn140" name="_ftnref140">[140]</a>. P.S. Daniel corroborates Coward’s view when he affirms that Dayananda’s sole aim seems to have been to vanquish the opponents in arguments, and the means he adopted to achieve this end, whether fair or foul, were of a matter of no concern to him<a href="#_ftn141" name="_ftnref141">[141]</a>.<br />
In spite of this, Dayananda had the audacity to state that the aim of his writings on religions was not to hurt the susceptibilities of others or to condemn falsely anyone, but to further the cause of truth and eradicate error and thus contribute to the elevation of human race and to enable all human beings to sift truth from falsehood. He also claimed that he accepted whatever is true and good in every religion<a href="#_ftn142" name="_ftnref142">[142]</a>. However, his attitude towards other religions betrayed the denial of these noble sentiments. In fact, as J.T.F. Jordens has rightly remarked, Dayananda’s views are strongly condemnatory, predominantly negative and positively intolerant and aggressive. He says that there is quite a lot of sarcastic bitterness in his criticism of other religions<a href="#_ftn143" name="_ftnref143" class="broken_link">[143]</a>.</p>
<h1><a name="_Toc397162591"></a>2.2 All non-Vedic religions should disappear</h1>
<p>Dayananda maintained that all non-Vedic religions that are found in the world are products of muddled intellects<a href="#_ftn144" name="_ftnref144" class="broken_link">[144]</a>. But the Vedic Religion is the only true religion and therefore all other religions are ‘false beliefs’ which should be <em>refuted</em> and <em>rejected</em><a href="#_ftn145" name="_ftnref145">[145]</a><em>.</em> Thus he speaks of the <em>snares</em> of the Jains, Christians and Moslems<a href="#_ftn146" name="_ftnref146">[146]</a>. Besides, the existence of diversity of religions only leads to hostilities and strife which greatly increases sufferings in the world<a href="#_ftn147" name="_ftnref147" class="broken_link">[147]</a>. Humanity can expect no progress unless everybody followed the same Vedic Religion because it is the religion of light, culture and righteousness, which will give true happiness to the entire humanity. Therefore, the salvation of the world consists in rejecting all the false religions and accepting the one true religion as revealed in the Vedas, and consequently all the false faiths must disappear. In a letter to Colonel Olcott he wrote: “We pray the Lord that by his grace and the effort of men one day all these religions may <em>disappear</em>, and that in the midst of all people may be established the one true religion which throughout the tradition has been preserved by the Aryans”<a href="#_ftn148" name="_ftnref148">[148]</a>.<br />
Therefore, Dayananda considered it his mission to replace all the religions, including certain forms of Hinduism, with the pure Vedic Religion. In fact, he looked forward to a future in which all the existing religions will vanish from the world and the Vedic Religion alone will reign supreme.</p>
<h1><a name="_Toc397162592"></a>2.3 Misrepresentation of other religious</h1>
<p>In the introduction to <em>Satyartha Prakash</em>, Dayananda presented four concrete principles that are to be taken into account in interpreting other religions. They are: a) <em>akanksa</em> which demands the interpreter to enter into the spirit of the speaker or author; b) <em>yogyata</em> which means fitness or compatibility of a word and the meaning it signifies so that it gives rationality to the text; c) <em>asatti</em> which demands that a text be taken in its total context; d) <em>tatparya</em> which insists in giving the same meaning to the words which was intended by the user or speaker<a href="#_ftn149" name="_ftnref149" class="broken_link">[149]</a>. P.S. Daniel notes that, when Dayananda interpreted other religions and their sacred texts he totally ignored these rules, which he himself had recommended. He took the scriptures in their most literal sense, ignoring the context and the spirit in which they are written<a href="#_ftn150" name="_ftnref150">[150]</a>. Benjamin Walker commenting on Dayananda’s Vedic religion notes that his interpretation of the Vedas was largely fanciful and often forcibly adapted to suit his preconceptions, and as he knew no English his inspiration was derived mainly from indigenous sources<a href="#_ftn151" name="_ftnref151">[151]</a>.<br />
It is an accepted fact that religious ideas are expressed in symbols and myths. Hence, in interpreting religious texts or ideas, one needs to go beyond the words, symbols and myths and seek their deeper meaning, through proper hermeneutics. But Dayananda took the mythical and symbolic expressions found in the scriptures of other religions in their literal sense, making no effort to grasp their hidden meanings. Jordens says: “Dayananda was hampered in his theological thinking by his complete inability to grasp the value and meaning of myth and symbols in the elucidation of the sacred. To him only pure rationality was acceptable in the realm of theology”<a href="#_ftn152" name="_ftnref152" class="broken_link">[152]</a>.<br />
P.S.Daniel says that, more often in Dayananda’s criticism of other religions and the interpretation of their scriptures, it was not rationality that guided him, but malice and spite<a href="#_ftn153" name="_ftnref153">[153]</a>. Coward observes that although Dayananda possessed a laudable desire to study other religions, and though he commendably went to great lengths to work on primary texts, his <em>a priori</em> assumptions frequently prevented him from understanding them<a href="#_ftn154" name="_ftnref154" class="broken_link">[154]</a>. F.K. Khan Durrani says that Dayananda&#8217;s arguments degenerated into wholesale abuse<a href="#_ftn155" name="_ftnref155">[155]</a>. He further notes that for Dayananda a thing is right if it is found in the Vedas. But if it is discovered in the <em>Quoran</em> or in the religious scriptures of some other religions, it is objectionable and false. Hence what Dayananda really seeks is victory and not truth<a href="#_ftn156" name="_ftnref156" class="broken_link">[156]</a>. J.N. Farquhar characterises much of Dayananda’s writings on other religions as ‘stinging taunts’<a href="#_ftn157" name="_ftnref157">[157]</a>.</p>
<h1><a name="_Toc397162593"></a>3 ‘<em>Satyartha Prakash</em> the most disappointing book’</h1>
<p>Perhaps the most virulent criticism against Dayananda’s fundamentalist ideology came from Mahatma Gandhi. The latter, after reading the Dayananda’s <em>Satyartha Prakash</em> in 1942 in Yerwada Prison, wrote in <em>Young India</em>: “I have read <em>Satyartha</em> <em>Prakash</em>, the Arya Samaj Bible. Friends sent me three copies of it whilst I was resting in the Yarwada Jail. I have not read a more <em>disappointing book</em> from a reformer so great. He has claimed to stand for truth and nothing else. But he has <em>unconsciously misrepresented Jainism, Islam, Christianity, and Hinduism itself</em>. One having even a cursory acquaintance with these faiths could easily discover the errors into which the great reformer was betrayed”<a href="#_ftn158" name="_ftnref158" class="broken_link">[158]</a>. Gandhi then pointed out that one’s respect for Dayananda would have been greater if he had not written such a book as <em>Satyartha Prakash</em>, especially the chapters on other religions. The comments of Gandhi invited strong protests from the Arya Samajists to which Gandhi responded saying that there was not a single word in his comments that was written without deep consideration and that his writings are therefore deliberate<a href="#_ftn159" name="_ftnref159">[159]</a>.<br />
It is also to be recalled that the Sindh government banned chapter XIV of <em>Satyartha Prakash</em> which deals with Islam because it promotes feelings of enmity and hatred between people. The government order particularly specified that the author of <em>Satyartha Prakash</em> ridiculed some of the religious beliefs of Muslims, misrepresented and reviled the teachings of the <em>Quoran</em>, attacked and belittled the authority of the Prophet Mohammad and that the book contained matters calculated to hurt the susceptibilities of Muslims<a href="#_ftn160" name="_ftnref160" class="broken_link">[160]</a>.</p>
<h1><a name="_Toc397162594"></a>4. Practice of <em>shuddhi</em> (re-conversion) as a weapon against Christianity and Islam</h1>
<p>Dayananda was greatly threatened by the activities of proselytisation by Christian missionaries and Muslim teachers. He said: “Do you not see that before your very eyes fraudulent cults are increasing and many men are embracing Christianity and Islam”<a href="#_ftn161" name="_ftnref161" class="broken_link">[161]</a>. In order to counteract it, besides employing the usual methods of public lectures and writings condemning these religions, he also introduced a new weapon called <em>shuddhi</em> or the re-conversion ceremony. K.W. Jones says: “<em>shuddhi</em>, [is] a ceremony of purification which was employed to return those who had been lost to Hinduism through Christian or Islamic conversion”<a href="#_ftn162" name="_ftnref162" class="broken_link">[162]</a>.<br />
<em>Shuddhi</em> was an ancient Hindu concept referring to the quality of purity necessary for the proper performance of religious rites and social duties. By extension, the term signified the rite by which pollution is removed and ritual purity is restored for performing religious rituals. Traditionally, it was also used for the re-admittance of Hindus who had fallen from caste fellowship, consciously or unconsciously. Initially orthodox Hindu rituals were used in <em>shuddhi</em> ceremony<a href="#_ftn163" name="_ftnref163" class="broken_link">[163]</a>.<br />
However, the credit goes to Dayananda for extending the ancient practice of <em>shuddhi</em> to reconvert to the Vedic faith those Hindus who embraced other religions, especially Islam and Christianity. Later, he also used it to <em>convert</em> non-Hindus to Vedic faith, thus making Hinduism both a <em>propagating religion</em> and a <em>converting religion</em><a href="#_ftn164" name="_ftnref164">[164]</a>. Dayananda found in <em>shuddhi</em> something appropriate for the specific Christian challenge to Hinduism which he started in Punjab and which in the course of time became a considerable movement in the entire Gangetic plains<a href="#_ftn165" name="_ftnref165" class="broken_link">[165]</a>.<br />
Thus <em>shuddhi</em> became a forceful response to the so-called converting activity of Christianity and Islam, for the recovery of lapsed Hindus, converting people to Hinduism, and raising the status of low-castes including the untouchables. He also used it as a powerful technique to reform Hinduism from within.</p>
<h1><a name="_Toc397162595"></a>5. Dayananda performs <em>shuddhi</em> (re-conversion) ceremony</h1>
<p>Dayananda himself took the lead to reconvert Christians and Muslims to Hinduism. In 1877, during his visit to Punjab, at Ludhiana he gave a lecture on <em>shuddhi</em> and prevented the conversion of a certain Brahmin called Ramsharan, a teacher at the Christian mission school. In Amritsar about forty students who were strongly attracted to Christianity were persuaded by Dayananda to abandon the idea. At Jullandhar he himself performed the re-conversion of a Christian. He was also actively involved in the re-conversion to Hinduism of several other Christians<a href="#_ftn166" name="_ftnref166">[166]</a>. Dayananda’s denunciation of Christianity and Islam was in full swing during and after his visit to Punjab (1877-1878), where Hindus felt the threat of Christianity and Islam most acutely<a href="#_ftn167" name="_ftnref167">[167]</a>.</p>
<h1><a name="_Toc397162596"></a>6. Arya Samaj as an organised proselytising religion</h1>
<p>The founding of the Arya Samaj in 1875 was the concrete response of Dayananda to the problem of religious pluralism. Jordens notes that, it was the most important and far-reaching decision taken by Dayananda because it planted his message and his reform firmly in the soil of North India<a href="#_ftn168" name="_ftnref168" class="broken_link">[168]</a>. It was to become a movement on the vanguard of the Hindu response to the challenges of other religions in the 20th century. Sir Herbert Risley observes that the Arya Samaj was bitterly opposed to Christianity and laid itself out not merely to counteract the efforts of missionaries but to reconvert to Hinduism persons of high castes who had become Christians<a href="#_ftn169" name="_ftnref169" class="broken_link">[169]</a>.<br />
Dayananda stated at the end of the <em>Satyartha Prakash </em>that the sole aim of his life is to help to put an end to this mutual wrangling of different religions and to bring all men into the fold of one religion, namely, the Vedic<a href="#_ftn170" name="_ftnref170" class="broken_link">[170]</a>. It was with this goal that he founded the Arya Samaj, the duty of which was to recall India to the forsaken Vedic path<a href="#_ftn171" name="_ftnref171" class="broken_link">[171]</a>. Dayananda, in his will, left his property to a society called <em>Paropakarani Sabha</em> to be used for the preaching and teaching of the Vedic Dharma by initiating a body of preachers to be sent across India and outside so that truth may be accepted and falsehood may be rejected<a href="#_ftn172" name="_ftnref172" class="broken_link">[172]</a>. In this way, he made the Vedic religion a <em>preaching religion</em> (<em>pracaraka dharma</em>) and a <em>propagating religion</em>. Dayananda says: “christianity (sic), Islam and Jainism are on the increase while Vedic people are deteriorating. But they do not open their eyes. […] You cannot protect your homes and <em>convert people</em> from other religions”<a href="#_ftn173" name="_ftnref173" class="broken_link">[173]</a>. Thus, as P.S.Daniel says, what he advocated was not co-existence of different religions on the basis of mutual respect but the acceptance of one religion by all<a href="#_ftn174" name="_ftnref174" class="broken_link">[174]</a>. In this way, the Arya Samaj became an organised proselytising religion, like Islam and Christianity, and it also aspired to convert the whole world to its faith through constructive propaganda. Jones notes: “Proselytisation then became a major activity of the Arya Samaj”<a href="#_ftn175" name="_ftnref175">[175]</a>.<br />
Fearing that the Christian missionaries would convert Hindus through their schools, Dayananda also established schools operated by the Arya Samaj. The raising of the status of the low castes through <em>shuddhi</em> ceremony was another method he employed against the challenges of Christianity. Dayananda also preached cow-protection and founded the famous Cow Protection Association.</p>
<h1><a name="_Toc397162597"></a>7. Dayananda as a Hindu nationalist</h1>
<p>Dayananda was not only a religious leader and social reformer, but also a political thinker. He derived his nationalist ideas from the originality of his own understanding of Indian culture and without any direct influence of Western thought. He noted that a nation is a people that is conscious of its historical identity, cultural uniqueness, common language, common territory and claim to self rule; Dayananda’s concepts of nationalism met all these requirements and he arrived at it about 1875, a decade before even the Indian National Congress was founded. Though the Arya Samaj is not a political organisation, in the strict sense, it has a political philosophy of its own. It is a national movement in the Indian context because it has a definite approach in all matters affecting the lives of the people and the country – religious, social, educational, cultural and political. Among the aims of Arya Samaj we read: “Its [Arya Samaj’s] prosperity and future depends upon the reconciliation of Hinduism with that greater <em>ism</em> – Indian Nationalism”<a href="#_ftn176" name="_ftnref176" class="broken_link">[176]</a>. C.Jaffrelot notes that although the Arya Samaj was not a proponent of Hindu nationalism, it was a militant organisation from which Hindu nationalism would emerge<a href="#_ftn177" name="_ftnref177">[177]</a>. He affirms: “its (Arya Samaj’s) ideological characteristics were such that it became one of the first crucibles of Hindu nationalism”<a href="#_ftn178" name="_ftnref178" class="broken_link">[178]</a>; “The Arya Samaj represents the militant strand from which, in particular, Hindu nationalism would spring forth”<a href="#_ftn179" name="_ftnref179">[179]</a>. Jordens observes that Dayananda developed an aggressive nationalism especially in his later years<a href="#_ftn180" name="_ftnref180">[180]</a>.</p>
<h1><a name="_Toc397162598"></a>8. Dayananda’s ideology and Hindutva</h1>
<p>An ideology can be considered to have succeeded when new generations of people begin to talk that language. Though more than a century has passed since Dayananda’s death, his religious philosophy continues to inspire a great portion of the Hindu intelligentsia in India. The unprecedented rise of militant Hindutva since the late 1980s is a proof of it.</p>
<h1><a name="_Toc397162599"></a>8.1. The link between Dayananda’s philosophy and Hindutva</h1>
<p>There is an ideological link between Dayananda’s religious fundamentalism and the present day Hindutva. Dayananda was perhaps the first in modern times to politicise Hindu religion. Through the interpretation of the Vedas he politicised Hinduism in a subtle way and to a degree no other Indian thinker had done before him. He attempted to justify that Hindu culture was to be the natural and the necessary basis of the nationalism. Dayananda considered the Vedic Dharma as the exclusively and absolutely true faith and therefore superior to all others. Hence he gave a clarion call to all the Hindus to ‘return to the Vedas’. He says: “The prosperity of a country depends upon the fulfillment (sic) of certain conditions, such as the study of the Vedas and the Vedic literature, due observance of the rules of the four <em>Ashramas</em>, <em>Brahmacharya</em> etc.”<a href="#_ftn181" name="_ftnref181" class="broken_link">[181]</a>. He also spoke of a Golden Age in which the Aryans of the Vedic era are presented as the chosen people to whom God revealed perfect knowledge of the Veda<a href="#_ftn182" name="_ftnref182">[182]</a>. Again, Dayananda also considered India as the land of Aryans and that Indians were Aryans. We read in <em>Satyartha Prakash</em>: “Now we shall examine the merits and demerits of the religion professed by the <em>Aryas</em> or people of the country of the <em>Aryavartta </em>[India]. In the whole world there is no country like India. […] For this reason did the Aryas come to this land and settle here in the beginning of the universe”<a href="#_ftn183" name="_ftnref183" class="broken_link">[183]</a>. He also used the term <em>Aryavartta</em> for India<a href="#_ftn184" name="_ftnref184" class="broken_link">[184]</a>, <em>Indraprashta</em> for Modern Delhi<a href="#_ftn185" name="_ftnref185" class="broken_link">[185]</a>, <em>Prayaga</em> for Allahabad<a href="#_ftn186" name="_ftnref186">[186]</a> and <em>Avantikak</em> for Ujjain<a href="#_ftn187" name="_ftnref187" class="broken_link">[187]</a>. Here it may be noted that one of the agendas of the Hindutva ideologues of today is to restore some of these ancient names.<br />
Dayananda proposed Sanskrit as the common language of India and made attempts to revive it, though later abandoned it for Hindi. He projected Christianity and Islam as ‘alien faiths’<a href="#_ftn188" name="_ftnref188" class="broken_link">[188]</a> or ‘faiths of other countries’<a href="#_ftn189" name="_ftnref189" class="broken_link">[189]</a>, and Carvacas, Buddhism and Jainism as ‘cults of India’<a href="#_ftn190" name="_ftnref190">[190]</a>.</p>
<h1><a name="_Toc397162600"></a>8.2. Attempts to impose Vedic culture</h1>
<p>Among the hardline Hindutva ideologues of India, we perceive a systematic attempt to resurrect the Vedic culture under the name of the ‘study of the Vedic Culture’ and Vedic sciences and assert the superiority of the Aryan race by imposing on the nation the ideology of Hindutva. For instance, there is a strong tendency among the Hindutva ideologues to present the Vedic civilisation as the foundation not only of Indian civilisation but also of the world civilisation, serious efforts are being made to impose Vedic studies in school and university education – we can recall here the systematic efforts in this direction by the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) and the University Grants Commission (UGC) when the former BJP-led NDA government was in power in New Delhi. In the name of bringing the so-called ‘real history’ to people, distortion of Indian history is being done by Hindutva historians. For example, they present the Aryans as the indigenous people of India, declare that the Aryan invasion is a myth, argue that the Vedic people and the Harappans were identical and that the authors of the <em>Vedas</em> were the builders of the Harappan civilization<a href="#_ftn191" name="_ftnref191" class="broken_link">[191]</a>.<br />
Symbolic gestures can have not only local but also global significance. Dayananda’s call of ‘back to the Vedas’ is heard overseas as well. The American-born David Frawley (who became Vamadeva Shastri) may be considered as a ‘personification’ itself of ‘return to the Vedas’. Frawley claims that he became a Hindu by studying the Vedas: He notes: “In my case I simply didn’t build bridge to the East, I crossed over them and left them far behind. I immersed my being in the soul of the East so completely that I almost ceased to be a Westerner, not only in my thoughts but also in my instincts. I moved from a Western intellectual rationality to a deeper cosmic rationality born of the <em>Vedic insight</em>”<a href="#_ftn192" name="_ftnref192" class="broken_link">[192]</a>. Frawley also has written many articles and books which can be considered as a continuation of the mission of Dayananda to bring people to the Vedic faith. Another example of a Westerner who responded to the call to ‘return to the Vedas’ is Ishwar Sharan ― originally a Canadian Christian ― who took his <em>Vedic initiation</em> at Prayaga in 1977. Today, through his writings he wages an ideological battle against Christianity, his former religion.</p>
<h1><a name="_Toc397162601"></a>8.3 Attempt to impose Vedic model of education</h1>
<p>In October 1998 in a conference of the Education Ministers and secretaries of States organised by the former Union Human Resource Minister, Murli Manohar Joshi, the ‘experts’ from the All India Conference of the Vidya Bharati recommended, among other things, that Vedas and Upanisads should be incorporated into the basic curricula of education and that Sanskrit learning should be made obligatory for students between Standard II to X<a href="#_ftn193" name="_ftnref193" class="broken_link">[193]</a>. In a seminar conducted in 2003 on ‘Indianisation of education-reforms and restructuring’, it was observed that the Vedic model of education was the <em>only solution</em> to elevate the level of standard of Indian education. The seminar also dealt at length with Vedic civilisation. Those who participated in the seminar include well-known personalities like the former Human Resource Development Minister Murli Manohar Joshi, the RSS leader K.S.Sudarshan and the former NCERT director J.S. Rajput<a href="#_ftn194" name="_ftnref194">[194]</a> – all of them acknowledged Hindutva hardliners of contemporary India. Thus, once again what we find is people responding to the ‘call’ of Dayananda to ‘return to the Vedas’.</p>
<h1><a name="_Toc397162602"></a>8.4. Intolerance towards religious minorities</h1>
<p>Again, the ‘war’ which Dayananda declared against the Muslims and Christians continues to be waged without any respite even today. Even after a century, the main targets of attack continue to be practically the same, and the reverberations of the ‘war drums’ are heard not only in the media and in the streets but also in the Indian parliament. The only difference is that the bulk of the ‘artillery’ and ‘ammunition’ for the war are carried to the battlefield, not by Arya Samajists but by the Hindutva brigade of the RSS, VHP, BJP, Bajrang Dal, Shiv Sena, and other affiliates of the Sangh Parivar, and the Hindutva stalwarts.</p>
<h1><a name="_Toc397162603"></a>8.5. Revival of the practice of re-conversion</h1>
<p>Dayananda engaged in polemics against all the religions extant in the India of his time, and his <em>Satyartha Prakash</em> continues to remain as a notorious monument to religious intolerance. Many practical methods employed by the Hindutva ideologues today to combat the religious minorities of India find their inspiration in Dayananda. For example, the practice of re-conversion (<em>shuddhi</em>) ceremonies, cow protection movement, proselytisation by Hindu volunteers, introduction of the so-called ‘Freedom of Religion Bill’ to prevent conversion, the view that India is the fountainhead of all culture, concept of India as a Hindu nation from time immemorial, publication of polemical and provocative writings in the form of tracts and pamphlets, gross misinterpretation of the dogmas and beliefs of other religions, superficial study of their scriptures and citing them out of context in order to spite and to malign, ridiculing their divinities and saints, the projection of Hindutva as the ‘one religion for all’ Indians, and so on, have their ideological as well as methodological inspiration in Dayananda and in the Arya Samaj he founded.</p>
<h1><a name="_Toc397162604"></a>8.6. The campaign of maligning by <em>Voice of India</em></h1>
<p>The <em>Voice of India</em> publications, New Delhi, which is one of the principal mouthpieces of the Hindutva today, seems to imitate the method adopted by Dayananda a century ago in his <em>Satyartha Prakash</em>. In fact, the <em>Voice of India</em> regularly publishes books, pamphlets and monographs of highly inflammatory nature against other religions, especially Islam, Christianity and the secular ideologies of India. Although the scholarship of many of these publications is questionable, they have a wide circulation both in India and abroad. Judging from the nature of their literature, the ultimate purpose of <em>Voice of India</em> seems to be ― just as it was in the case of Dayananda ― to impress, indoctrinate, misrepresent, malign, fabricate stories, politicise religion and play on the emotions of the masses against the minority religions and secularists of India, in order to win the battle against their opponents, using any means, fair or foul.<br />
Dayananda’s style of engaging in polemics and hurling insults against religious minorities is being imitated by several contemporary Hindutva ideologues. Authors like Arun Shourie (see his <em>Missionaries in India,</em>1994; <em>Worshiping False God’s</em>,1994; <em>Harvesting Our Souls</em>, 2000), Sita Ram Goel (see his <em>Jesus Christ: An Artifice for Aggression</em> 1994; <em>Catholic Ashrams: Sanyasins or Swindlers</em>,1994; <em>History of Hindu Christian Encounters</em>, 1996; <em>Genesis and Growth of Nehruism</em>, 1993; <em>The Story of Islamic Imperialism in India</em>,1994), Ram Swarup (see his <em>Hindu View of Christianity and Islam</em>, 1992; <em>On Hinduism Reviews and Reflections</em>, 2000), Ishwar Sharan (see his <em>The Myth of Saint Thomas and the Mylapore</em> <em>Shiva Temple</em>,1995), David Frawley (see his <em>Arise Arjuna. Hinduism in the Modern World</em>, 1995), Koenraad Elst (see his <em>Psychology of Prophetism</em>. <em>A Secular Look at the Bible</em>, 1993; <em>Negationism in India. Concealing the Record of Islam</em>, 1993) are among the outstanding disciples of Dayananda in this field. A critical reading of their writings reveals that, in essence, their discourses are hardly different from that of Dayananda in his <em>Satyartha Prakash</em>. In other words, all these are subtle ways of responding to the call of Dayananda to ‘return to the Vedas’, to assert the Vedic faith and the superiority of the Aryan race. Therefore, we may rightly maintain that much of the inspiration for the present-day Hindutva writers is derived from Dayananda, either directly or indirectly. In this way Dayananda continues to aliment Hindutva.<br />
However, it is paradoxical that the same Hindutva ideologues who are so strongly under the ideological spell of Dayananda, have conveniently avoided being influenced by the social reforms initiated by him, such as, repudiation of traditional caste system, untouchability, Brahmanic domination of Indian culture, discrimination against women and low castes and attempts to reform the Hindu religion from such evils as polytheism, idolatry, superstitious rituals, exploitation of the ignorant masses, etc.</p>
<h1><a name="_Toc397162605"></a>9. Dayananda as the ‘father’ of modern Hindu fundamentalism</h1>
<p>As we have already seen, Dayananda upholds the view that the Vedic Religion alone is the absolute truth and that it is superior to all other faiths. As the <em>Sanatana Dharma</em> (Eternal Religion), it is for all time and all peoples. He says: “The <em>Sanatan Dharma</em> or Eternal Religion is that set of universal doctrines which belong to all countries and all men, which were accepted in the past, are being accepted in the present, and shall be accepted in future by everybody and which it is impossible for anybody to go against”<a href="#_ftn195" name="_ftnref195" class="broken_link">[195]</a>. He affirms again: “All men, should, therefore, accept this firmly established doctrine [of the Vedic revelation]. They should accept none else”<a href="#_ftn196" name="_ftnref196">[196]</a>. What is implied is that all religions other than the Vedic are false and products of ignorance, worthy to be obliterated from the face of the earth. He says: “One who disrespects the Veda or the scriptures written by master-minds in agreement with the Vedas, is an anti-Vedic heretic and <em>should be turned out of the nation, society and country</em>”<a href="#_ftn197" name="_ftnref197" class="broken_link">[197]</a>. Dayananda’s religious intolerance of other faiths is evident in this statement. Here we may quote the words of Meera Nanda who says: “Hinduism refuses to grant other faiths their distinctiveness and difference, even as it proclaims its great ‘tolerance’. Hinduism’s tolerance is a mere disguise for its narcissistic obsession with its own greatness”<a href="#_ftn198" name="_ftnref198">[198]</a>.<br />
Arya Samaj began as a defensive organisation of the Hindus. But soon it became an offensive one against people of other faiths. The Samaj also launched programmes to convert followers of other religions to the Hindu faith<a href="#_ftn199" name="_ftnref199" class="broken_link">[199]</a>. To counter the proselytising activities of Christian missionaries it borrowed many organisational techniques from them. It sponsored missionary activities to convert Muslims and Christians and performed ceremonies to raise outcast Hindus to the twice-born status<a href="#_ftn200" name="_ftnref200">[200]</a>. The <em>shuddhi</em> (re-conversion) programme of the Arya Samaj is now being pursued as an aggressive agenda of the Sangh Parivar.<br />
D.D. Pattanaik says that history of modern Hindu nationalist thought begins with Swami Dayananda Saraswati. He advocated rejuvenation of Hinduism as India’s national religion on the doctrine of Vedic infallibility, as the foundation of Hindu society and Hindu nation. Thus Dayananda spoke of nationalism in religious terms, and laid down the foundations for neo-Hindu nationalism<a href="#_ftn201" name="_ftnref201" class="broken_link">[201]</a>. Pattanaik even places him next to Adi Sankara. He says: “Next to Adi Sankaracharya, Dayananda was the greatest and foremost to check onslaught on Hinduism and its genuine scriptures”<a href="#_ftn202" name="_ftnref202" class="broken_link">[202]</a>.<br />
In the saffronised NCERT school textbook of Social Sciences for Class IX, Dayananda is presented as a great patriot because his slogan was ‘back to the Vedas’ and he instilled in people a pride in the ideals of <em>swadeshi</em><a href="#_ftn203" name="_ftnref203" class="broken_link">[203]</a>. However, it may be more correct to call him a patriot of Hindu <em>rashtra</em> and a champion of Vedic religion than a true patriot. It has been said that many terrorists and extremists were inspired by the Arya Samaj he founded<a href="#_ftn204" name="_ftnref204">[204]</a>. His ideas have also influenced the militant Hindu Mahasabha<a href="#_ftn205" name="_ftnref205" class="broken_link">[205]</a> and the Jana Sangh<a href="#_ftn206" name="_ftnref206" class="broken_link">[206]</a>.<br />
Thus, ultimately, what Dayananda propounds is a <em>single culture</em>, <em>single religion</em> and a <em>single identity</em> ― namely the Vedic. The glorification of the Vedic culture amounts to the glorification of Hinduism and the ethnic pride of Aryans. For example, he says: “Just as there is one God there should be <em>one religion</em> of all people [the Vedic]”<a href="#_ftn207" name="_ftnref207" class="broken_link">[207]</a>; “From the dawn of creation up to a little before five thousand years ago, the <em>Aryas were the sole overlords</em> of the whole world”<a href="#_ftn208" name="_ftnref208">[208]</a>; “It is very difficult to make any progress without <em>common faith</em>, <em>common interests</em> [&#8230;] and <em>common feeling</em>”<a href="#_ftn209" name="_ftnref209">[209]</a>.<br />
From the above, it is not difficult to see that Dayananda advocated for India the theory of one religion, one race and one culture. Here, we are reminded of Adolf Hitler’s concept of <em>ein Reich, ein Volk, ein Führer</em> (One nation, one people, one leader!). Such an ideology demonstrates Dayananda’s callous insensitivity towards people of other faiths, his religious intolerance, and his intention to crusade against religious freedom. Because of his inability to accept religious pluralism, what he advocates in reality is a <em>clash of religions</em>, and consequently, religious <em>fundamentalism </em>and<em> militancy</em>. Subash Anand says: “Dayananda’s weakness was a fundamentalist reading of his religious tradition”<a href="#_ftn210" name="_ftnref210" class="broken_link">[210]</a>.<br />
Thus Dayananda’s religious philosophy hardly contributes anything to inter-religious dialogue or understanding of civilisations or peaceful co-existence of people of different faiths. His exclusive religion of the Vedas is a danger for the secularist and the pluralistic framework of India. Therefore, we may rightly claim that his ‘anti-other’ philosophy qualifies him to be the ‘father’ of the modern Hindu fundamentalism, not only because of the nature of his views but also due to the extent of their influence on contemporary India. In fact, after an analysis of Dayananda’s religious thought Ninian Smart affirms that Dayananda was in a stronger sense than Ram Mohan Roy a fundamentalist, and an early nationalist, and the Arya Samaj he founded had some influence on the militant Hindu Mahasabha movement<a href="#_ftn211" name="_ftnref211" class="broken_link">[211]</a>.</p>
<h1><a name="_Toc397162606"></a>Conclusion</h1>
<p>In order to understand the present, one needs to know the past. The seeds of religious fundamentalism which Dayananda sowed more than a century ago is bearing abundant fruit in contemporary India in the form of aggressive Hindutva against the religious minorities of India, especially the Muslims and Christians, as evidenced by the innumerable acts of atrocities committed against them in recent years. Thus, the true face of Dayananda, which has so far been hidden beneath the mask of his being a frontline Hindu social reformer, now emerges as that of a Hindu fundamentalist and nationalist.<br />
The ability of Dayananda’s philosophy of religion to aliment Hindu chauvinism even after a century, once again tells us most eloquently that, ideologies rule the world, and that an ideological aggression if not resisted in time, can lead to lasting tragic consequences. Therefore, the popular conception of Dayananda as a benign Hindu social reformer is only a half-truth. The other half is that the roots of contemporary Hindu fundamentalism and militancy against the minority religions, to a great extent, lie deep in the 19<sup>th</sup> century, especially in the religious philosophy of persons like Dayananda Saraswati. Therefore, the ideological link between Dayananda and the contemporary Hindutva, is too evident to go unnoticed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Written by Sulaiman Razvi</p>
<p>The Purusha Sukta of the Veda is the root of the caste system in Hinduism which says &#8216;The head of the Lord became the Brahmin, from his chest came the Vaisya, from his thighs the Kshatriyas and from his feet the Shudras were born&#8217;. Later texts like the Puranas, Smritis etc. further deteriorated the status of the Shudras. It&#8217;s ironic that Brahmins oppressed the lower caste but few of them (political and religious leaders) today are trying to give equal status to the lower caste. In reality they have no sympathy towards the lower castes, the motive behind this is to attract more followers. How come this generosity has suddenly aroused towards the poor Shudras? The Shudras were ill-treated for centuries, Caste system in Hinduism is not something that came later, it&#8217;s deeply rooted in the Hindu culture.</p>
<p><span id="more-2266"></span></p>
<p>As expected Hindus always try to blame other religions especially Muslims for the evil, barbaric practices rooted in Hinduism. Ashok Singhal of the militant outfit VHP said Islamic invasion in India is responsible for caste system in Hinduism. Such statements by a Hindu is normal as Hindus are not well versed in their scriptures or history. The Hindutva forces organises Ghar Wapsi for the conversion of Christians and Muslims to Hinduism but they seldom organises any event for the lower castes, to give them equal status. Coming to the point, Some Hindu apologists in order to cover the ugly side of Hinduism are writing articles to show that Shudras have equal status in Hinduism. Another allegation by Hindutva forces is that, it&#8217;s not just Hinduism but other religions like Islam and Chritianity that recognises caste system. This statement is quite interesting, No book of other religions say that Protestant was god&#8217;s head, Roman Catholic was his thigh or Sunni was God&#8217;s head and the Shia was his thighs. The irony is that those fanatics accuses others of using &#8216;Christian Missionary&#8217; translations or fake translation but it&#8217;s actually they who mistranslate their own scripture to fool gullible people. Hence I will be using translation by Hindu scholars.</p>

<blockquote class="quote-light"><p><strong>CLAIM:</strong></p></blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p>Manu Smriti hails from an era when even the concept of birth-based caste system did not exist. Thus Manu Smriti nowhere supports a social system based on birth. Maharshi Manu took inspiration from Vedas (refer Rigveda 10.10.11-12, Yajurveda 31.10-11, Atharvaveda 19.6.5-6) and proposed a social system based on qualities, actions and nature of the individual</p></blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>Ironically, the writer is quoting Purusha Sukta to show that caste system is not based on birth despite the fact that Purusha Sukta is said to be the root of caste system in Hinduism. The deceit of the writer has just started. Manu Smriti itself promotes birth based caste system, it is mentioned,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 10.6 &#8220;Sons begotten by members of twice born castes on wives belonging to their next inferior castes (in the order of enumeration) are said (by Manu) not obtain the castes of their fathers owing to the degraded castes of their mothers.&#8221; Tr. Dutt</p>
<p>The caste here is not determined by the qualities of new born child but it is determined by the caste of parents in which the child is born in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p><strong>CLAIM:</strong></p>
<p>2. This is called Varna System. Now the very word Varna derived from root word &#8220;Vrinja&#8221; means &#8220;Choice&#8221;. A similar usage happens in common used word &#8220;Varan&#8221; meaning &#8220;choosing&#8221; or &#8220;Var&#8221; meaning a husband chosen by the girl. This also shows that in Vedic system the girl had complete rights to choose her husband.</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>The word Varna is derived from the root word Vrta which means &#8216;to cover, to envelop&#8217;. The word Varna occurs in Veda as colour or complexion, see Rig Veda 3.34.9. In the Dharma Shastras the term Krishna Varna is considered to be black race where Krishna means Black and Varna means race, In the Gopatha Brahmana 1.1.23 Brahmin&#8217;s colour is white (Shukla). But the word Varna is translated as Caste by Hindu scholars as well as Indologist. In Ashtadhayi 1.1.34 ;5.2.134 Maharshi Panini has interpreted Varna as Caste. The word Varna has several meanings like caste, race, colour, tribe etc., but is used mostly to denote Caste. Acharya Medhatithi writes on Manu Smriti 1.2,</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;The term &#8216;Caste&#8217; is implied to the three castes, &#8216;Brahmana, Ksattriya and Vaishya; and the term &#8216;all&#8217; has been added for the purpose of including the Sudra&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>V.S Apte also translate Varna as caste,</p>

[The Student&#8217;s English-Sanskrit Dictionary, by Vaman Shivram Apte, 1893 edition, Published by Mrs. Radhabai Atmaram Sagoon, Bombay]
<p>Women in Hinduism do not have choice to choose her husband. I shall stick to the topic instead of refuting unrelated points. This is already refuted in <a href="/index.php/2019/02/05/women-in-hinduism-2/" data-wpel-link="internal">Women in Hinduism</a> article.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p><strong>CLAIM:</strong></p>
<p>The biggest proof of Manu Smriti proposing Varna System and NOT Caste System is that in the first Chapter of Manu Smriti, there is mention of origin of 4 Varnas and no mention of castes or gotras. Had caste or gotra been important, Manu would have mentioned which castes belong to Brahmins, which to Kshatriyas, which to Vaishyas and which to Shudras</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>Is it really important that the first chapter has to quote everything? The writes is ignorant of caste system, he writes, &#8216;Manu would have mentioned which castes belong to Brahmins&#8217; he doesn&#8217;t even know that Brahmin is a caste. The writer has adopted a unique way to fool people, just misinterpret the meaning of Varna and then interpret all the verses about castes as Varna. Manu Smriti&#8217;s second verse of first chapter promotes caste system,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 1.2 &#8220;May thou, O Blessed One, explain to us, in due form and in proper order, the duties of all castes and intermediate castes!&#8221; Tr. G. Jha</p>
<p>The writer has made a stupid point, &#8216;Manu would have mentioned which castes belong to Brahmins, which to Kshatriyas, which to Vaishyas and which to Shudras&#8217;</p>
<p>Acharya Medhatithi gives the following meaning of Caste,</p>
<p>&#8220;What are these &#8216;castes&#8217;? Is the word &#8216;caste&#8217; denotative of a species of human beings? No: these are four castes, beginning with the Brahmana and ending with the Shudra. The others the Barbara, the Kaivarta and so forth are only mixed races, as will be described later on.&#8221; Medhatithi on Manu Smriti 10.4</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p><strong>CLAIM:</strong></p>
<p>4. In fact Manu Smriti 3.109 clearly states that one who eats by glorifying his Gotra or Family is considered an eater of his own vomit. Thus, as per the Manu Smriti that the self-proclaimed birth-based Brahmins or upper-castes believe in, the very act of glorifying their lineage or gotra to demand special privileges makes them deserving of condemnation</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>This writer is being Mayavi (Vedic fraud), in the introduction of this article he was accusing others of using interpolated and misinterpreted verses from Manu Smriti to &#8216;defame Hinduism&#8217; but now he has started misinterpreting it himself. Manu Smriti 3.109 prohibits a Brahmin to obtain meal from others by advertising his family, i.e. he should not mention his family&#8217;s name for enjoying hospitality, it even prohibits to obtain meal by mentioning his own name,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 3.109 &#8220;Let not a Brahmana mention his own name and family for enjoying one&#8217;s hospitality; he, who eats by giving out the name of his own self and family, eats egesta.&#8221; Tr. Dutt</p>
<p>One can read previous and next verses to understand the context. I am using Buhler&#8217;s translation,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 3.108. But if another guest comes after the Vaisvadeva offering has been finished, (the householder) must give him food according to his ability, (but) not repeat the Bali offering.<br />
109. A Brahmana shall not name his family and (Vedic) gotra in order to obtain a meal; for he who boasts of them for the sake of a meal, is called by the wise a foul feeder (vantasin).<br />
110. But a Kshatriya (who comes) to the house of a Brahmana is not called a guest (atithi), nor a Vaisya, nor a Sudra, nor a personal friend, nor a relative, nor the teacher.<br />
111. But if a Kshatriya comes to the house of a Brahmana in the manner of a guest, (the house-holder) may feed him according to his desire, after the above-mentioned Brahmanas have eaten.<br />
112. Even a Vaisya and a Sudra who have approached his house in the manner of guests, he may allow to eat with his servants, showing (thereby) his compassionate disposition.</p>
<p>Scholars are of the same view as I explained this verse.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p><strong>CLAIM:</strong></p>
<p>5. Manu Smriti 2.136 states that one earns respect due to wealth, company, age, actions and knowledge in increasing order. There is no mention of family, gotra, caste, lineage and other non-factors to demand or earn respect.</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>Manu Smriti 2.136 &#8220;Wealth, relation, action and learning, as the fifth, These are the grounds of respect; (among them) that which follows is weightier (than that which goes before it).&#8221; Tr. G. Jha</p>
<p>This is talking about upper three castes only, that whoever possess these five qualities within the same caste should be respected. Acharya Medhatithi explains Manu Smriti 2.136 as,</p>
<p>&#8220;Caste has been described as a ground of superiority; so that one belonging to a higher caste should be respected by one of a lower caste. The text now proceeds to describe the relative strength of those factors that entitle persons of a caste to salutation and honour among themselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>The writer should have honestly mentioned previous verse also,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 2.135 &#8220;A Brahmana, ten years old, and a Kshatriya of a hundred years of age, shall considered as a father and a son; the Brahmana shall be treated as the father of the Kshatriya.&#8221; Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>It is explained by Acharya Medhatithi as,</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;All that this means is that even when the Ksatriya is very old and the Brahmana very young in years, the former should rise to meet and salute the latter.&#8221;</p>
<p>The next verse says the Shudra who is 100 years old should be respected, the term respect here denotes salutation. It doesn&#8217;t say that the Shudra possessing the five said qualities should be saluted but it only makes a mention of the age, Medhatithi has also said that the age of old Shudra is his only quality mentioned since action and learning is not possible for a Shudra and he is not entitled to these also. Dharma Shastra says,</p>
<p>Gautama Dharma Shastra 6.10-11 Salutation, eighty years old Shudra should salute a much younger Brahmin</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p><strong>CLAIM:</strong> Migration within Varnas</p>
<p>6. Manu Smriti 10.65 asserts that Brahmin can become Shudra and Shudra can become Brahmin. Similarly Kshtariyas and Vaishyas can also change their Varnas.</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>Manu 10.65 actually means that when a Sudra female marries a Brahmin male and their daughter marries a Brahmin and this goes on for seven generations then the seventh generation becomes Brahmin. As a Brahmin marrying a Sudra begets a child of another caste. It can be easily understood by reading previous verse,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 10.64 &#8220;If the daughter of a Brahmana by his Sudra wife is married to a Brahmana, and the daughter of that union is again married to a Brahman, and so on uninterruptedly up to the seventh generation in the female line, then at the seventh generation the issue of such union is divested of its Parasara caste and becomes a Brahmana.&#8221; Tr. Dutt</p>
<p>Hindu Apologists should be ashamed that they being Hindus are misinterpreting their own scriptures and I being a Rakshasa, Malechha is explaining it correctly in accordance with the interpretation of Hindu scholars. Renowned Hindu scholar Vijnanesvara explains it in Mitakshara on Yajnavalkya Smriti verse 96,</p>
<p>&#8221;&#8230;This is the adjustment: the daughter begot by a Brahmana on a Sudra woman is Nisadi; she (Nisadi) is married by a Brahmana and gives birth to a certain daughter. The latter is also married by a Brahmana and gives birth to a daughter, and so on, till the sixth daughter, who will give birth to a Brahman as seventh&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>This backfires the writer. This instead promotes birth based caste system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p><strong>CLAIM:</strong></p>
<p>7. Manu Smriti 9.335: If a Shudra (uneducated) serves the educated ones, is polite, devoid of ego and stays in respectful company of knowledgeable ones, he/ she is considered as having a noble birth and stature.</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>This is also misinterpreted. The writer has wrongfully translated Dvija as educated one. This verse says that a Shudra by serving the upper three castes attains higher caste in his next birth. This verse actually portrays Shudra as servants of twice born men.</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 9.335. (A Sudra who is) pure, the servant of his betters, gentle in his speech, and free from pride, and always seeks a refuge with Brahmanas, attains (in his next life) a higher caste.<br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-7671" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2014-05-manu.png" alt="https://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/manu-smriti-9-335.png?w=300" width="557" height="91" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p><strong>CLAIM:</strong></p>
<p>8. There are several shlokas in Manusmriti that state that a person belonging to high Varna falls down to level of a Shudra (uneducated) if he does not conduct noble deeds. For example,</p>
<p>2.104: A person who does not worship the Supreme Lord twice daily should be considered a Shudra.</p>
<p>2.172. He who has not been initiated with teaching of the Vedas is a Sudra.</p>
<p>4.245: A Brahmin acquires brilliance through company of noble persons and avoiding bad company. On contrary, if he indulges in bad company, he becomes a Shudra</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>This requires a bit lengthy explanation. The meaning of the word Dvija (twice born) will explain this. The word Dvija means twice born, it is said that the Brahmin has two (or more) lives, first when he takes his birth from the womb of his mother and second when tying the girdle. It is mentioned in Manu Smriti which will refute the author&#8217;s claim on Manu Smriti 2.172,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 2.39 &#8220;Henceforth (beyond these age limits) these three twice born ones, not duly initiated with the thread, become Vratyas (of broken vows), and are degraded from the society of the Aryans.&#8221; Tr. Dutt</p>
<p>The next verse recommends expiation for not studying Vedas,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 2.40 &#8220;A Brahmana, even in the time of distress, must not hold any connection with these Vratyas, not duly expiated according to the regulation, either by marriage, or by (Vedic) study.&#8221; Tr. Dutt</p>
<p>Another clear English translation,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 2.40 With such men, if they have not been purified according to the rule, let no Brahmana ever, even in times of distress, form a connexion either through the Veda or by marriage.</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 11.192-3 &#8220;Twice born ones, who have not been initiated with the Gayatri at their respectively proper ages (of initiation), shall first practice three Krichchhra penances; thereafter they should be initiated with the holy thread.&#8221; Tr. Dutt</p>
<p>Vijnaneshwara also writes,</p>
<p>&#8220;Vratyas or outcastes are devoid of all sacraments; so long as they do not perform the Vratyastoma; performing which they again become entitled to Upanayana.&#8221; Vijnanesvara in Mitaksara on Yajnavalkya Smriti verse 38</p>
<p>So this shows that a Brahmin still remains a Brahmin. As expiatory rites are prescribed for him. It is mentioned in Upanishad,</p>
<p>Chandogya Upanishad 6.1.1. Harih, Om. There lived once Svetaketu Aruneya (the grandson of Aruna). To him his father (Uddilaka, the son of Aruna) said: &#8216;Svetaketu, go to school; for there is none belonging to our race, darling, who, not having studied (the Veda), is, as it were, a Brahmana by birth only.&#8217;</p>
<p>This verse speaks for itself. It&#8217;s true that Hindu scripture says a Brahmin falls from his rank if he does so and so sins. But this doesn&#8217;t mean he becomes a Shudra, for Acharya Medhatithi explains it as,</p>
<p>&#8220;The mention of &#8216;outcaste&#8217; here is only meant to indicate degradation; it does not mean that the man is to be actually treated as an &#8216;Outcaste&#8217;, as described under 11.182.&#8221; Medhatithi on Manu Smriti 3.16</p>
<p>Medhatithi here is talking about Dvija degraded to outcast for marrying a sudra</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8217;By selling meat he at once becomes an outcaste&#8217;; where becoming an outcaste could not apply to any one else except the seller himself. From all this it is clear that all that is meant to be really related to the prohibition is that something undesirable happens; and the words of the text cannot be taken as literally true. Hence what is meant is that &#8216;the man who does anything else- in the shape of selling and the like- with sesamum than eating and the rest, becomes a worm,- i.e., becomes tainted with the evil effects described.&#8221; Medhatithi on Manu Smriti 10.92</p>
<p>&#8220;The term &#8216;outcast&#8217; connotes disqualification in regard to the rites of twice born men; the meaning is that he &#8216;falls&#8217;, recedes, becomes deprived of, his rights.&#8221; Medhatithi on Manu Smriti 11.180</p>
<p>Gautama Dharma Shastra 21.4. To be an outcast means to be deprived of the right to follow the lawful occupations of twice-born men.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So when Hindu text says that a Brahmin falls from his rank, it connotes degradation, it doesn&#8217;t literally mean that the Brahmin becomes a Shudra. As I showed above, where ever Hindu text says a Brahmin looses his rank for doing this specific deed, then the next or other verses has expiatory rites for such sins. Manu Smriti 4.245 is mistranslated by the writer,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 4.245. A Brahmana who always connects himself with the most excellent (ones), and shuns all inferior ones, (himself) becomes most distinguished; by an opposite conduct he becomes a Sudra.<br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-7672" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2014-05-manu-1.png" alt="https://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/manu-smriti-4-245.png?w=300" width="556" height="100" /></p>
<p>As the writer is an Arya Samaji, he interprets Dvijas as Humans, highly intellectual, and non Hindus as demons, terrorists, criminals etc. The &#8216;most excellent ones&#8217; or &#8216;noble people&#8217; here denotes Brahmins, Kshatriyas and Vaishyas. And it is prohibited for them to inter-dine, share same seat with the low caste people, Dvija incurs sin by doing this humane act which is regarded as &#8216;Sin&#8217; by Hinduism. Acharya Medhatithi explains it as,</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;By the contrary procedure,&#8217; by adopting the opposite process i.e., by forming connections with inferior people the man becomes a Shudra. Since it is not possible for the caste of a man to disappear, what is meant is that he becomes equal to the Shudra.&#8221;</p>
<p>He also writes on Manu 10.43</p>
<p>&#8221;It is not that the man&#8217;s caste becomes lost; all that happens is that he becomes liable to be called by such caste names as the Bhrijjakantaka&#8217; and the rest.&#8221;</p>
<p>There is an expiation for this sin also,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 11.181-2 &#8220;By sharing the same car, with, or by eating in the company of a degraded person for a year, a man becomes degraded; by teaching the Vedas to such a person, or by officiating as a priest at a sacrifice instituted by him, or by contracting any; marital relation with him, one becomes degraded on the same day. He, who associates with a degraded person, must practice the same penance for his purification, as is laid down for the expiation for the sin through which that person has become degraded.&#8221; Tr. Dutt</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p><strong>CLAIM:</strong></p>
<p>2.168: A Brahmin, Kshatriya or Vaishya who puts efforts in other areas except understanding and following the Vedic precepts becomes a Shudra and his future generations also suffer from ignorance of Vedas.</p>
<p>Thus, as per Manu Smriti, almost the entire population of India today, barring few exceptions, is Shudra because we do not abide by the Vedic concepts and are indulged in anti-Vedic activities – corruption, casteism, selfishness, superstitions, irrationality, gender-discrimination, sycophancy, immorality etc.</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>The correct translation is,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 2.168 &#8220;The twice born man, who, not having learnt, the Veda, labours over other things, soon falls, along with his descendants, even while living, to the state of the Shudra.&#8221; Tr. G. Jha<br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-7673" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2014-05-manu-2.png" alt="https://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/manu-smriti-2-168.png?w=300" width="529" height="120" /></p>
<p>The next verse is,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 2.169 &#8220;The first birth of a Brahmana is in the womb of his mother, his second birth is through his initiation with the holy thread, and his third birth lies through his initiation in the Vaiddic sacrifices (Jyatishtoma, etc.) as ordained by the Sruti.&#8221; Tr. Dutt</p>
<p>The question is, how can one be still be a Dvija (Brahmin, Kshatriya and Vaishya) if they have not learned the Vedas? Acharya Medhatithi explains it as,</p>
<p>&#8220;The mention of &#8216;falling to the state of the Shudra&#8217; is meant to express excessive deprecation.&#8221;</p>
<p>There is an expiation for this also,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 11.192-3 &#8220;Twice born ones, who have not been initiated with the Gayatri at their respectively proper ages (of initiation), shall first practice three Krichchhra penances; thereafter they should be initiated with the holy thread. Brahmanas, who do improper acts, and who, though initiated with the thread, are ignorant of the Vedas, if they wish to do the expiatory penance, should be likewise advised to practice the same penance (i.e. Krichchhra Vratam.)&#8221; Tr. Dutt</p>
<p>Such words like &#8221;Falls from the rank&#8221; are used to only for prohibition. As per scholars it doesn&#8217;t literally mean that a Brahmin becomes a Shudra. A Brahmin is born as a Brahmin from the womb of his mother as it is mentioned in Manu Smriti 2.169.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p><strong>CLAIM:</strong> Even Shudras can teach</p>
<p>9. Though Shudra means an uneducated person, a Shudra can also become a teacher for specific knowledge that he has. For example,</p>
<p>2.238: One should acquire knowledge even from a person born in a low family otherwise. Similarly, one should accept a noble woman as wife even if her family is otherwise not up to mark.</p>
<p>2.241. If needed, one may acquire knowledge from one who is not a Brahmin; and that he shall follow and serve such a teacher, as long as the instruction lasts</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>The writer is contradicting himself now. What &#8216;Knowledge&#8217; can be availed from an uneducated person? If he possess such great knowledge which the Brahmin doesn&#8217;t know then why the Shudra isn&#8217;t elevated to the status of a Brahmin? As Brahmins are &#8216;educated&#8217; people in the words of the apologist.</p>
<p>Manu 2.238 &#8220;One imbued with faith may acquire excellent learning even from a lowly person, special law even from the lowest, and the gem of a wife even from a base family.&#8221; Tr. G. Jha</p>
<p>The knowledge mentioned here only refers to worldly matters. This verse is addressed to Brahmins, the lowly here refers to Kshatriyas and Vaishyas. A Brahmin can get advice for worldly matters from Kshatriyas and Vaishyas or it is prohibited for a Brahmin student to education from Kshatriyas and Vaishyas (for sake of the argument) except in time of distress. And the &#8216;Lowest&#8217; refers to Chandalas and only some instructions can be taken from them, for example if a Brahmin visits a new city and he knows nothing about it and he wants to go to a hotel or to some other place in the city then he may ask Chandala for directions to the hotel, etc,. Acharya Medhatithi explains it as,</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Such learning one might &#8216;acquire&#8217; learn- even from the lowly person, i.e., from a person born of a lower caste. &#8216;excellent learning&#8217; here should not be taken as the &#8216;Vedic Science&#8217;; for even though in abnormal times of distress the learning of the Veda from lower castes may be permitted as we shall find later on, yet it cannot be permitted in normal times. That learning which is &#8216;not excellent&#8217;, such as the science of magic, etc. one should not learn at all. Lowest is the Chandala; from him even, one may learn the &#8216;special law&#8217;, i.e., law other than that expounded in Shrutis and Smritis; i.e., law relating to ordinary worldy matters. The term &#8216;Dharma&#8217;, law, is also used in the sense of rule. The sense thus is that if even a Chandala should say such is the rule here, &#8216;do not stay here for long,&#8217; do not bathe in this water,- such is the custom among the people of the village, such is the restriction imposed by the king, then one should not think that he should obey only the words of his Preceptor and he need not pay any heed to those of a Chandala who has dared to advise him. We should not take the term &#8216;special law&#8217; to mean &#8216;the knowledge of truth regarding Brahman&#8217;, because it is not possible to acquire this knowledge from the Chandala and such people, for the simple reason that they are ignorant of the Veda&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Acharya Medhatithi then goes on to mention that low caste people are not allowed to study the Vedas etc, which I have mentioned in the <a href="/index.php/2019/03/05/caste-system-in-hinduism/" data-wpel-link="internal">Caste system in Hinduism</a> article. I am reproducing the correct translation for the next verse which the author quoted,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 2.241 &#8220;In times of distress, a Brahmana student may take his lessons from a non Brahmana preceptor, and he shall serve his Guru (teacher) only so long as he shall actuallly study.&#8221; Tr. Dutt</p>
<p>Acharya Kulluka explains it as</p>
<p>&#8216;In the absence of a Brahmana, he may study under a Kshatriya; and in the absence of a Kshatriya, under a Vaisya preceptor.&#8221;</p>
<p>It actually says that a student IN TIME OF DISTRESS (but not otherwise) may acquire knowledge from Kshatriya or a Vaishya. Acharya Medhatithi is of the same view, he writes that only in times of distress but never in normal times. As per Hindu text, Dvijas are entitled for the study of the Vedas but the person born in the Brahmin caste alone is entitled to teach it,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 10.1 &#8220;The members of the three twice-born orders, attending to the specific duties of their castes, shall read (the Vedas), but the Brahmanas alone shall teach the Vedas, and none else, this is the conclusion.&#8221; Tr. Dutt</p>
<p>This is what it means when these verses are read together but Hindu apologists just want to misinterpret the text and present in whatever manner they like. Brahmins alone shall teach but in time of distress a student may learn from Kshatriyas and Vaishyas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p><strong>CLAIM:</strong> Status of Brahmin is acquired by deeds and not by name</p>
<p>10. As per Manu Smriti, one has to earn the qualification of Brahmin. During childhood, parents are supposed to send their children for specialized education of Brahmin, Kshatriya or Vaishya depending on observed nature of children. So many Brahmin parents may desire that their children also become Brahmins. However that is not sufficient. One becomes Brahmin only if he completes the education and not merely by taking birth in a Brahmin family or taking admission in Brahmin course of a gurukul.</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>Did the writer missed Shudra student in his statement? After reading this he may add it, but need not worry I have saved it already. Let me again quote the verse,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 10.1 &#8220;The members of the three twice-born orders, attending to the specific duties of their castes, shall read (the Vedas), but the Brahmanas alone shall teach the Vedas, and none else, this is the conclusion.&#8221; Tr. Dutt</p>
<p>It says that twice born men i.e., Brahmins, Kshatriyas and Vaishyas shall learn the Vedas but a Brahmin can alone teach it. The question is, if studying Vedas makes you a Brahmin, then why does it separates Kshatriya and Vaishya from Brahmins and why the Brahmin alone can teach it when Kshatriya and Vaishya also possesses Vedic knowledge? And the writer has also invented &#8216;Brahmin courses&#8217;, can he furnish any reference for this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p><strong>CLAIM:</strong></p>
<p>2.157: A Brahmin devoid of education is equivalent to an elephant made of wood or a deer made of leather. They are merely namesake and not real.</p>
<p>2.28: The body is made fit to be called Brahmin only through study of scriptures, discipline, noble selfless deeds, study of duties, science and meditation, charity and goal oriented actions</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>Manu Smriti 2.157-8 &#8220;As the elephant made of wood, as the deer made of leather, so the non-learning Brahmana, these three merely bear their names. As the eunuch is useless among women, as the cow is useless among cows, as a gift to the ignorant person is useless, even so is the Brahmana useless who is devoid of the Veda.&#8221; Tr. Dutt</p>
<p>The question is, why is a person still considered a Brahmin if he has not studied the Vedas at all? In the words of the apologists one who studies the Veda/takes Brahmin course is a Brahmin but this verse speaks contrary. The context is that, this verse only praises the learned Brahmin over a unlearned Brahmin, just as it is said in another verse,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 1.96-99 &#8220;Of the created things the animate creatures are the highest; of the animate creatures the intelligent ones are the highest, of the intelligent creatures men are the highest, and among men the Brahmanas are the highest. Among Brahmanas the erudite ones are the highest, among the erudite Brahmanas those, who think it their duty to perform the Sastric rites, are the highest among the latter those, who perform such rites, are the highest, and among the performers of rites the knowers of Brahma are the highest. The Brahmana has originated as the eternal emboidment of virtue. His origin is for the furtherance of virtue; he becomes the essence of Brahma. Born as a Brahmana, he wields the supremacy of the world, the ruler of all creatures, the custodian of the treasure of virtue.&#8221; Tr. Dutt</p>
<p>So what does these verses say? It says a Brahmin is BORN i.e., he is a Brahmin by birth and the best among the Brahmin is the one who is learned, and the best among the learned Brahmin is those who perform Sastric rites… Another verse says that a Brahmin whether learned or ignorant is a great divinity,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 9.317 &#8220;Learned or unlearned, the Brahmana is a great divinity; just as consecrated or unconsecrated, the fire is a great divinity.&#8221; Tr. G. Jha</p>
<p>So the writer&#8217;s notion that &#8216;Status of Brahmin is acquired by deeds and not by name&#8217; is absolutely wrong, because Brahmin is born as the great divinity whether learned or unlearned. The translation of Manu Smriti 2.28 is incorrect,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 2.28 &#8220;The study of the three Vedas, Vows, burnt offerings Ijas, sons, the great sacrifices, and sacrifices make the soul of a man competent to attain to Brahma.&#8221; Tr. Dutt</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p><strong>CLAIM:</strong> <strong>Education is true birth</strong></p>
<p>11. As per Manu, actual birth happens after completion of education. All human beings are Shudras or uneducated when born. Those who complete their education are supposed to have a new birth. Thus they are called Dwija or Twice Born. Those who were unable to complete the education remain Shudra. This has nothing to do with birth or heredity. This is pure meritocracy.</p>
<p>2.148: When a teacher who is well-versed in Vedas teaches a student the science of Gayatri (that summarizes all principles of Vedas and rational living), then the actual birth of the student takes place. This birth is free from risks of death or destruction and leads the student to immortality.</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>I agree with the writer on few points, but let me quote the verse,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 2.148 &#8220;The birth, which the Acharyaya, well conversant with the Vedas, procreates for him through the Savitri initiation, according to the Regulation, is his real, decaying, immortal birth (i.e., birth in immorality).&#8221; Tr. Dutt</p>
<p>The writer means to say that everyone is born a Shudra and only after completion they are considered Dvija or twice born men. Let&#8217;s have a look at what other verses say about it,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 2.169 &#8220;The first birth of a Brahmana is in the womb of his mother, his second birth is through his initiation with the holy thread, and his third birth lies through his initiation in the Vaidic sacrifices (Jyatishtoma, etc.) as ordained by the Sruti.&#8221; Tr. Dutt</p>
<p>Sankha Samhita 1.6 Brahmanas, Kshatriyas, and Vaisyas are the three twice born; their second birth takes place on the occasion of putting on the girdle of sacred rush.</p>
<p>It says a Brahmin is born and his second birth occurs when he is initiated (i.e., when he starts studying the Veda). The writer claims,</p>
<p>&#8216;All human beings are Shudras or uneducated when born. Those who complete their education are supposed to have a new birth. Thus they are called Dwija or Twice Born&#8217;</p>
<p>If everyone is born a Shudra then why Shrutis permit Upanayana ceremony only for the Aryans?</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 2.35-40 According to the teaching of the revealed texts, the Kudakarman (tonsure) must be performed, for the sake of spiritual merit, by all twice-born men in the first or third year. In the eighth year after conception, one should perform the initiation (upanayana) of a Brahmana, in the eleventh after conception (that) of a Kshatriya, but in the twelfth that of a Vaisya. (The initiation) of a Brahmana who desires proficiency in sacred learning should take place in the fifth (year after conception), (that) of a Kshatriya who wishes to become powerful in the sixth, (and that) of a Vaisya who longs for (success in his) business in the eighth. The (time for the) Savitri (initiation) of a Brahmana does not pass until the completion of the sixteenth year (after conception), of a Kshatriya until the completion of the twenty-second, and of a Vaisya until the completion of the twenty-fourth. After those (periods men of) these three (castes) who have not received the sacrament at the proper time, become Vratyas (outcasts), excluded from the Savitri (initiation) and despised by the Aryans. With such men, if they have not been purified according to the rule, let no Brahmana ever, even in times of distress, form a connexion either through the Veda or by marriage.<br />

<p>As you can see Manu only instructs Dvija students but not Shudra students, Yajnavalkya is of the same view,</p>
<p>Yajnavalkya Smriti verse 14 In the eighth year of conception or in the eighth (year of) birth, the Upanayana ceremony of the Brahmanas, of the Ksatriyas in the eleventh; of the Vaisyas in eleven plus one. Some say according to family custom. The writer goes on misinterpreting Manu Smriti 2.146-8 which only praises the preceptor. Which the writer has presented in such a way to show one who doesn&#8217;t study Vedas is not even considered a Human. All non Aryans are not considered humans as per Vedic concept.</p>
<p>If everyone is born as a Shudra then why people born in Shudra family are barred from studying the Vedas while those born in the family of twice born (Brahmin, Kshatriya and Vaishya) are permitted for the study of Vedas?

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>The writer is either being Mayavi (Vedic fraud) or he is writing under the influence of cannabis like his guru Dayanand Saraswati did. Quoting a verse and giving completely different meaning won&#8217;t help.</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 10.4 &#8220;The Brahmana, the Ksattriya and the Vaishya are the three twice born castes; the fourth is the one caste, Shudra; there is no fifth caste.&#8221; Tr. G. Jha</p>
<p>Acharya Medhatithi explains it as,</p>
<p>&#8220;…Of these four, three castes are &#8216;twice born&#8217;, the initiatory rite being prescribed for them. &#8216;One caste&#8217; is the Shudra; there is no Initiatory Rite for him; since the injunction of this rite contains the distinct mention of the three castes, Brahmanas and the rest; e.g., the Brahmana shall be initiated in the eight year, the Ksattriya in the eleventh and the Vaishya in the twelfth; and nowhere is the name of the Shudra mentioned…&#8221;</p>
<p>As you can see Acharya Medhatithi has explained it in exact same manner which I was explaining. This would clear all doubts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p><strong>CLAIM:</strong></p>
<p>This also means that merely because a person did not complete education does not make him a villain. He is still regarded as a noble person if his deeds are noble. And if he completes the education, he can become a Dwija as well. Thus Shudra is an adjective and NOT a nomenclature for any castes. And if he completes the education, he can become a Dwija as well. Thus Shudra is an adjective and NOT a nomenclature for any castes.</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>How can that be so when only Aryans (Brahmins, Kshatriya and Vaishya) are considered noble while the rest including Shudras are considered Anarya (Non Aryan), Malechha (Barbarian) and Rakshasa/Dasyu (Demon). The last sentence of the writer is already refuted in the above point.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p><strong>CLAIM:</strong> Never insult anyone born in lower family</p>
<p>12. To further ensure that one is not insulted or denied opportunities merely because he/she was born in a family where others did not excel in education, wealth or other parameters of success in society, Maharshi Manu laid the rule very clearly:</p>
<p>4.141: Never deny respect and/or rights to a person who is handicapped, uneducated, aged, not handsome, not wealthy or coming from a lower family. These are NOT the parameters to judge a person</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>True! But Hindu texts awards corporal punishment for a Shudra is he abuses a Brahmin while a Brahmin abusing a Shudra is not at all punished or either fined few bucks.</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 8.270-1 &#8220;If a Sudra uses any offensive language to a member of the twice born caste (Brahmana), his tongue shall be slipped [clippled] off, inasmuch as he (Sudra) has originated from a vile place (of the body of Supreme Brahma). If a Sudra abuses a member of the twice born order by mentioning his name and caste, a burning tong to the length of ten fingers shall be inserted into his mouth.&#8221; Tr. Dutt</p>
<p>Then the writer goes on misquoting verses to show that people in ancient era changed their castes.</p>

<p><strong>RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>If Hindu apologists wants to prove that caste migration is possible then they should furnish references showing that a Shudra by studying Vedas can become a Brahmin and by quoting few such examples. The references provided by the writer has been grossly misrepresented,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sage Valmiki was a Shudra who wrote Valmiki Ramayana</p>
<p>Valmiki&#8217;s real name was Agni Sharma and he was born to a Brahmin named Sumali who belonged to Bhargava (Bhrigu&#8217;s) lineage and his mother was Kaushiki belonged to Kaushik Gotra. Agni Sharma began to perform penance and chanted the word &#8220;Mara&#8221; which meant &#8220;kill&#8221;. As he performed his penance for several years, the word became &#8220;Rama&#8221;, the name of Vishnu. Huge anthills formed around Agni Sharma and this earned him the name of Valmiki. It is clearly mentioned in Skanda Purana that Agni Sharma/Valmiki was born to a Brahmin,</p>
<p>Skanda Purana V.i.24.3-4 &#8220;O Vyasa, formerly there was a Brahmana named Sumati, born in the family of Bhrigu. His wife Kausiki was richly endowed with beauty and youth. A son was born to him named Agnisarman&#8230;&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 3.3.18 mentions Riksha as the descendant of Bhrigu who is also known by the name Valmiki. Padma Purana 1.8.156 described Valmiki as the best of the Bhargavas. Padma Purana V.66.143 mentions Valmiki as a Brahmin.</p>
<p>In Valmiki Ramayana, Uttara Kanda 7.96.14 Valmiki describes himself as the tenth Pracheta. Pracheta is another name of Varuna. Srimad Bhagavatam 6.18.5 says Valmiki was born from Varuna. Valmiki belonged to Bhrigu&#8217;s race and Bhrigu is also considered son of Varuna. It will require lengthy explanation to clear this but since it is irrelevant to the topic so it will be inappropriate to discuss it here.</p>
<p>Vyasa was a Shudra</p>
<p>Vyasa&#8217;s father was Rishi Parasara a Brahmin and his mother was Satyavati whose father was a Kshatriya and mother was an Apsara. So how come he was a Shudra?</p>
<p>Mahabharata 1.63 &#8220;&#8230;the king, acquainted with the subtle truths of Dharma and Artha, went unto him and said, &#8216;Amiable one, carry thou this seed (semen) for my wife Girika and give it unto her. Her season hath arrived.&#8217; &#8220;The hawk, swift of speed, took it from the king and rapidly coursed through the air. While thus passing, the hawk was seen by another of his species. Thinking that the first one was carrying meat, the second one flew at him. The two fought with each other in the sky with their beaks. While they were fighting, the seed fell into the waters of the Yamuna. And in those waters dwelt an Apsara of the higher rank, known by the name of Adrika, transformed by a Brahmana&#8217;s curse into a fish. As soon as Vasu&#8217;s seed fell into the water from the claws of the hawk, Adrika rapidly approached and swallowed it at once. That fish was, some time after, caught by the fishermen. And it was the tenth month of the fish&#8217;s having swallowed the seed. From the stomach of that fish came out a male and a female child of human form. The fishermen wondered much, and wending unto king Uparichara (for they were his subjects) told him all. They said, &#8216;O king, these two beings of human shape have been found in the body of a fish!&#8217; The male child amongst the two was taken by Uparichara. That child afterwards became the virtuous and truthful monarch Matsya&#8230;&#8221;The fish-smelling daughter of the Apsara in her piscatorial form was then given by the king unto the fishermen, saying, &#8216;Let this one be thy daughter.&#8217; That girl was known by the name of Satyavati.&#8221; Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Rishi Parasari was sexually aroused seeing Satyavati and threatened her with a curse if she didn&#8217;t had sex with him and at last he lured her with a boon and had intercourse with her and impregnated her and from her Ved Vyasa was born,</p>
<p>Mahabharata 1.63 ”…While engaged in this vocation, Satyavati was seen one day by the great Rishi Parasara, in course of his wanderings. As she was gifted with great beauty, an object of desire even with an anchorite, and of graceful smiles, the wise sage, as soon as he beheld her, desired to have her. And that bull amongst Munis addressed the daughter of Vasu of celestial beauty and tapering thighs, saying, ‘Accept my embraces, O blessed one!’ Satyavati replied, ‘O holy one, behold the Rishis standing on either bank of the river. Seen by them, how can I grant thy wish?’ “Thus addressed by her, the ascetic thereupon created a fog (which existed not before and) which enveloped the whole region in darkness. And the maiden, beholding the fog that was created by the great Rishi wondered much. And the helpless one became suffused with the blushes of bashfulness…”And Satyavati gratified with having obtained the excellent boon in consequence of which she became sweet-scented and her virginity remained unsullied conceived through Parasara’s embraces. And she brought forth the very day, on an island in the Yamuna, the child begot upon her by Parasara…” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Narada Purana, Uttarabhaga 28.32 “O Brahmana, the activities of the Lord are beyond human scrutiny though he abides by the favourably Dharma. Vyasa the son of Parasara, is himself the classifier of the Vedas. He was a man of truthful vision. His very form is worthy of being worshipped. (But) he was born of the semen virile of one who destroyed the virginity (of a woman). Hence he is called a Kanina (son of an unmarried girl). Moreover, he had sexual intercourse with the wives of his younger brothers.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Rama ate berries which were tasted by Shabari</p>
<p>There is no reference in Valmiki Ramayana or any Purana about Rama eating tasted berries of Shabari. This story written by Balaram Das is understandable as he was part of the Pancha-sakha group in 15th century Puri, Odisha, who challenged Brahmanical customs and identified themselves as Shudra-munis (low caste sages). There are suggestions that he was probably inspired by a south Indian Sanskrit hagiography of saints known as Divya-Suri-Charitham, but the story did not gain popularity as the Brahmin orthodoxy found the story too radical. There is reference of Rama eating berries offered by Shabari but there&#8217;s no mention of her offering them tasted berries,</p>
<p>Padma Purana Book VI, Chapter 242, Verses 267-270 &#8220;He went to the pious, glorious Sabari. That best among Visnu&#8217;s devotees, seeing Rama and Lakshmana, went forth to greet them. Having saluted and seated them on a seat of darbhas, she washed their feet. With her mind full of joy she devoutly worshipped them with fragrant wild flowers. She, of a firm vow, then offered the two descendants of Raghu (viz. Rama and Lakshmana) fragrant fruits and sweet roots. (Rama,) the descendent of Kakutstha, gave her the highest liberation.&#8221; Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p>Some text allows Dvija (twice-born) to eat food cooked by a Shudra servant so there is nothing like breaking caste barriers here.</p>
<p>Aitareya Rishi was son of a Daasa or criminal but became a Brahmin of highest order and wrote Aitareya Brahman and Aitareyopanishad. Aitareya Brahman is considered critical to understand Rigveda.</p>
<p>The writer is doomed for destruction as he is calling Aitareya Mahidasa&#8217;s father a criminal. Aitareya Mahidasa was born to a sage named Mundaka, and as per another version he was born to a Brahmin named Visala.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vatsa became a Rishi though born to a Shudra (Aitareya Brahman 2.19)</p>
<p>Ailush Rishi was son of a Daasi, gambler and of low character. However he researched on Rigveda and made several discoveries. Not only was he invited by Rishis but also made an Acharya. (Aitareya Brahman 2.19)</p>
<p>Aitareya Brahmana doesn&#8217;t mention the name or caste of Vatsa&#8217;s father but as per Rig Veda  8.8.8 and Pancavimsa Brahmana 14.6.6 Vatsa was born to a Brahmin named Kanva. And Rig Veda 8.8.11 says that Vatsa was the son of sage which means that Kanva was also a sage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kavasa Ailusa was born to a Brahmin father named Ilusha and a slave girl (Daasi), later on he went to the Saraswati river. The Rishis expelled Ailusa from the sacrifice saying how can a son of a slave girl remain with us and be initiated. I am quoting this from Aitareya Brahmana 2.19.</p>
<p>Aitareya Brahmana 2.19 The Rishis, when once holding sacrificial session on (the banks of) the Saraswati, expelled Kavasha, the son of Ilusha, from (their Soma sacrifice (saying) How should the son of a slave girl, a gamester, who is no Brahman, remain among us and become initiated (into all sacrificial rites)? They turned him out (of the place) into a desert.</p>
<p>This shows that non Brahmins were not taught Vedas in the Vedic period. Later on the son of Brahmin Ailusa went to Saraswati, the waters surrounded him around giving him a favour. Then the Rishis said,</p>
<p>Aitareya Brahmana 2.19 As Sarasvati had surrounded him on all sides, the Rishis said, thee gods know him; let us call him back.</p>
<p>This shows that the Rishis were not aware of Ailusa lineage. Read the first line addressed by the Rishis they said, &#8216;How should the son of a slave girl&#8217; they didn&#8217;t call him son of Ilusha who was a Brahmin, probably because they were unaware of it and later came to know about it only when waters of Sarasvati surrounded him.</p>
<p>Satyakaam Jaabaal was son of a prostitute but became a Brahmin.</p>
<p>Satyakam Jabal was initiated by Gautama Rishi only after Gautama ascertained that he was a Brahmin by birth, Adi Shankara Acharya writes in his commentary,</p>
<p>&#8221; 37. And on account of (Gautama) proceeding (to initiate Gâbâla) on the ascertainment of (his) not being that (i.e. a Sûdra).<br />
The Sûdras are not qualified for that reason also that Gautama, having ascertained Gâbâla not to be a Sûdra from his speaking the truth, proceeded to initiate and instruct him. &#8216;None who is not a Brâhmana would thus speak out. Go and fetch fuel, friend, I shall initiate you. You have not swerved from the truth&#8217; (Kh. Up. IV, 4, 5); which scriptural passage furnishes an inferential sign (of the Sûdras not being capable of initiation).&#8221; <strong>Shankaracharya on Brahma Sutra 1.3.37</strong></p>

<p>Mahabharata 13.29. &#8216;Sakra said, &#8216;One born on a Chandala cannot, by any means acquire the status of a Brahmana. Do thou, therefore name some boon so that all this labour of thine may not prove fruitless&#8211;Thus addressed by the chief of the celestials, Matanga became filled with grief… Matanga also, casting off his life-breaths, attained to a high place. Thou mayst thus see, O Bharata, that the status of a Brahmana is very high. That status is incapable of being acquired here (except in the natural way of birth) as said by the great Indra himself.&#8221; Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Raavan was born from Pulatsya Rishi but became a Rakshas.</p>
<p>He was a half Brahmin and half Rakshas because his father was a Brahmin sage named Vishvasrawa and mother was a Rakshasi.</p>
<p>Sons of Vishwamitra became Shudra. Vishwamitra himself was a Kshatriya who later became a Brahmin.</p>
<p>Again no reference is provided. Vishwamitra was born as a Brahmin due to exchange of Charu given by Rishi Richika. As per Mahabharata 13.4 Viswamitra&#8217;s maternal grandmother requested for a boon from a Rishi who told her to hug a tree and a Kshatriya will be born to her, likewise he told Satyavati to hug another tree for a Brahmin Son, but those two ladies decided to switch the trees which were to be hugged, after they embraced the trees, they were impregnated and thus Viswamitra took birth as a Brahmin, not as the apologists claim that he was a Kshatriya by birth.</p>
<p>Mahabharata 13.4 &#8220;I had so ordered that thou wouldst give birth to a Brahmana whose virtues would be famous throughout the three worlds, and that she (thy mother) would give birth to an excellent Kshatriya. But now, O excellent lady, that thou hast reversed the order (of the charu) so, thy mother will give birth to an excellent Brahmana and thou too, O excellent lady, will give birth to a Kshatriya terrible in action.&#8221; Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Vidur was son of a servant but became a Brahmin and minister of Hastinapur empire.</p>
<p>Vidura was a Dvija named Dharma, but due to his action he was born as a Shudra in his next birth. But he didn&#8217;t loose his memory of previous life. It is in compliance with Hindu scriptures that it is only in next life that a person attains higher caste or is degraded to lower one. Vidura was cursed by a sage to become a Shudra because Vidura accidently shot the sage with an arrow and took birth as a Shudra.</p>
<p>Ramanuja Acharya refutes this claim,</p>
<p>&#8220;The case of Vidura and other Sudras having been &#8216;founded on Brahman,&#8217; explains itself as follows:- Owing to the effect of former actions, which had not yet worked themselves out, they were born in a low caste, while at the same time they possessed wisdom owing to the fact that the knowledge acquired by them in former births had not yet quite vanished. (On these general grounds we object to Sudras being viewed as qualified for meditation on Brahman.) The Sutra now refutes that argument, which the Purvapakshin derives from the use of the word &#8216;Sudra&#8217; in the Samvarga vidya.&#8221; <strong>Ramanuja Acharya on Brahma Sutra 1.3.32</strong></p>
<p>It is also mentioned in Mahabharata,</p>
<p>Mahabharata 1.63 &#8220;And because the killing of a Brahmana is more heinous than that of any other living thing, therefore, hast thou, O Dharma, been sinful. Thou shalt, therefore, be born on earth in the Sudra order.&#8217; And for that curse Dharma was born a Sudra in the form of the learned Vidura of pure body who was perfectly sinless…And from Dwaipayana also born, in the Sudra caste, the wise and intelligent Vidura, conversant with both religion and profit, and free from all sins…&#8221; Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>So where does it say that Vidura became a Brahmana? Moreover it says that he was born as a Shudra conversant with both religion and profit (due to his memory of previous life), but despite having this knowledge it didn&#8217;t make him a Brahmin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As per Bhagvat, Agniveshya became Brahmin though born to a king.</p>
<p>Rathotar born in Kshatriya family became a Brahmin as per Vishnu Puran and Bhagvat.</p>
<p>Pravriddha was son of Raghu King but became a Rakshas.</p>
<p>Haarit became Brahmin though born to Kshatriya (VP 4.3.5)</p>
<p>No reference is provided for these claims, and the reference provided for Harit doesn&#8217;t state that he became a Brahmin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pravriddha was son of Raghu King but became a Rakshas.<br />
Trishanku was a king but became a Chandal.</p>
<p>It is already proved that a Brahmin, Kshatriya or Vaishya doesn&#8217;t loose their caste (See Medhatithi&#8217;s explanation on Manu 4.245), it is used only to signify degradation and they must perform penance for expiation of their sins. This is not my explanation, these are the explanations given by Hindu scholars and Hindu texts. Trishanku&#8217;s story appears more like a fiction, Trishanku is said to have committed three sins for which Vasistha called him Trishanku (Three sins) and then he is said to have maintained Vasistha&#8217;s family for 12 years during a famine and then ascended to space becoming a star. So if a Brahmin incurs three sins and maintains the family of the one who cursed you then will you become a start in the constellation? As the explanation given by Acharya Medhatithi caste of a man cannot disappear, the term outcaste when referring to Dvija only means degradation, he is not actually to be treated as a Shudra or Chandala.</p>
<p>Shaunak became Brahmin though born in Kshatriya family. (VP 4.8.1). In fact, as per Vayu Puran, Vishnu</p>
<p>The reference provided by the writer doesn&#8217;t says that Shaunk became a Brahmin.</p>
<p>Prishadh was son of King Daksha but became a Shudra. Further he did Tapasya to achieve salvation after repenting. (Vishnu Puran 4.1.14) Had Tapasya been banned for Shudra as per the fake story from Uttar Ramayan, how could Prishadh do so?</p>
<p>Nabhag, son of King Nedishtha became Vaishya. Many of his sons again became Kshatriya. (Vishnu Puran 4.1.13)</p>
<p>Dhrist was son of Nabhag (Vaishya) but became Brahmin and his son became Kshatriya (VP 4.2.2)</p>
<p>Further in his generation, some became Brahmin again (VP 9.2.23)</p>
<p>As you can see, the apologist has heavily relied on one particular Purana. Which is actually about creation of human beings,</p>
<p>Mahabharata 1.75.14-16 And in Manu&#8217;s race have been born all human beings, who have, therefore, been called Manavas. And it is of Manu that all men including Brahmanas, Kshatriyas, and others have been descended, and are, therefore, all called Manavas. Subsequently, O monarch, the Brahmanas became united with the Kshatriyas. And those sons of Manu that were Brahmanas devoted themselves to the study of the Vedas. And Manu begat ten other children named Vena, Dhrishnu, Narishyan, Nabhaga, Ikshvaku, Karusha, Saryati, the eighth, a daughter named Ila, Prishadhru the ninth, and Nabhagarishta, the tenth. And Manu begat ten other children named Vena, Dhrishnu, Narishyan, Nabhaga, Ikshvaku, Karusha, Saryati, the eighth, a daughter named Ila, Prishadhru the ninth, and Nabhagarishta, the tenth. They all betook themselves to the practices of Kshatriyas.</p>
<p>As I proved in the article <a href="/index.php/2019/03/05/caste-system-in-hinduism/" data-wpel-link="internal">Caste system in Hindusim</a> and in this very response that one cannot loose the caste, it is only in next birth that one attains higher caste or sinks to lower one. The same is the case with Prishadhra,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 9.2.9 &#8220;Although Pṛṣadhra had committed the sin unknowingly, his family priest, Vasiṣṭha, cursed him, saying, &#8220;In your next life you shall not be able to become a kṣatriya. Instead, you shall take birth as a śūdra because of killing the cow.&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Then he performed penance as Hindu scriptures allows Dvijas to perform penance when they have committed even gross sin. So as per Srimad Bhagavatam 9.2.10-14 Prishadra performed penance and his sin was expiated. So the thing is that such stories should be explained clearly, whether they were born via Niyoga, whether their caste was changed in next birth, or their mothers had acquired a boon like the story of Vishwamitra&#8217;s mother and whether they performed expiatory rites or not, the incident happened in which Yuga and what were the rules of castes during that time etc., all these questions matter and must be answered, one cannot blindly quote some cherry picked verse and give their own meaning. Nabhaga is said to have become a Vaishya because he married a Vaishya woman, Hindu scriptures allows Kshatriya to marry woman of his own caste, a Vaishya and a Shudra. Although there is a slight prohibition to marry woman of other caste as his first wife but there are expiatory rites to be performed for this also. And the reference he provided doesn&#8217;t say Dhrista became a Vaisya, it was from his that the Kshatriya race sprang up, as per Srimad Bhagavatam 8.13.2-3 Nabhaga and Dhrista were both sons of Manu. This instead promotes casteism, why one should loose his caste on merely marrying a girl of another caste? As per Markandeya 114.114-6 Nabhag&#8217;s wife was originally a Kshatriya who was degraded to Vaisya due to a curse, later the curse was removed and hence their son was a Kshatriya. Manu had two sons named Nabhaga, the writer should clear which Nabhaga he is referring to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some Hindu also claim that Vasistha was born to a prostitute but became a sage. It is true that he was born due to a heavenly prostitute named Urvashi but wasn&#8217;t born from her womb, as per Rig Veda 7.33.11; Nirukta 5.13 he was actually the common son of Mitra-Varuna born in a pot. Then the writer continues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p><strong>CLAIM: </strong></p>
<p>Many verses of adulterated Manu Smriti (10.43-44) state that certain castes were earlier Kshtariya but became Shudra later. These verses are adulterated but prove that concept of Varna migration did exist. The castes mentioned are: Paundrak, Audru, Dravid, Kamboj, Yavan, Shak, Parad, Palhava, Cheen, Kirat, Darad, Khash.</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>Acharya Medhatithi has explained it as,</p>
<p>&#8221;&#8230;This is what is meant by &#8216;gradually&#8217;; which means that the continued neglect of the rites reduces successive generations to the position of the Shudra; and this does not refer to the new born child, who loses his title only by the omission of his initiation. It is not that the man&#8217;s caste becomes lost; all that happens is that he becomes liable to be called by such caste names as the Bhrijjakantaka&#8217; and the rest&#8230;The assertion that these people have become &#8216;low born&#8217; is based upon the fact that in these countries we do not meet with any clear division of the four castes&#8230;Some people might be led to think that all these races here named are found to be described as Ksattriyas, so that must be Ksattriyas still. And it is with a view to preclude this idea that it ias asserted that these are low born. All the people spoken of form the races inhabiting the borders of Aryavarta, such races for instance, as the Kirata, the Vena, the Darada and so forth; and it is with reference to this that we have declaration that one should not go to the borders.&#8221;</p>
<p>Reading next and previous verses will clear the doubts, as I don&#8217;t like to repeat the same explanation again and again. The writer is trying to imply that Kshatriyas became Shudras during their lifetime, this is not true because as we have read already it is only in successive births that one attains higher caste or is degraded to lower one as per Hindu text.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p><strong>CLAIM: Respect for Shudras</strong></p>
<p>3.112: If a Shudra or Vaishya comes as a guest, the family should feed him with due respect.</p>
<p>3.116: A householder should eat from remaining food only after he has fed the scholars and servants (Shudras) to their satisfaction.</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>Manu Smriti 3.112 &#8220;If Vaisyas and Sudra arrive at his (Brahmana&#8217;s) house as Atithis, he, out of compassion, shall feed them in the company of his own servants.&#8221; Tr. Dutt</p>
<p>Acharya Medhatithi writes,</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;This last clause has been added with a view to show that those here mentioned are not objects of respect&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>This verse rather says that Vaishyas and Shudra coming as a guest to a Brahmin should be fed in the company of servants, I guess the writer gets this kind of treatment where ever he goes and finds it respectful.</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 3.116 &#8220;Let the master and mistress of the house eat what remains after feeding the Brahmans (guests), relations and servants.&#8221; Tr. Dutt</p>
<p>These verses gives instructions to husband and wife on how they should treat their guests. As per scholars a separate portion should be assigned for guests and the remaining portion should be eaten by the householder. The Shudra servant instead is to be given the remnants of the food of his Brahmin master,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 10.125 &#8220;He shall give him the leavings of his food, his old and cast off clothes, and his old beddings and grainless paddy for his bed.&#8221; Tr. Dutt</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 2.137 has already been explained.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p><strong>CLAIM: </strong>Shudras have right to study Vedas and conduct Vedic rituals</p>
<p>18. Vedas very clearly provide right to Shudras (and women) – in fact entire humanity – to study Vedas and conduct Vedic rituals like Yajna. Refer Yajurveda 26.1, Rigveda 10.53.4, Nirukta 3.8 etc.</p>
<p>Thus Manu Smriti also supports the same Vedic truth. That is why nowhere in the context of Upanayan (education initiation) does Manu forbid Upanayan or sacred thread for Shudras. On contrary, one who refuses to accept Sacred Thread of education is called a Shudra!</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>Yajur Veda 26.1 &#8220;Fire and Earth are favourablee to me; may they be subsevient to me in the accomplishment of that aim of mine. Air and firmament are favourable to me; may they be subservient to me in the accomplishment of that aim of mine. Sun and his light are favourable to me; may they be subservient to me in the accomplishment of that aim of mine. Waters and clouds are favourable to me, may they be subservient to me in the accomplishment of that aim of mine. Out of these seven forces are the mainstay of all beings, the eight is Earth which keeps every one under its sway. O God make all out paths pleasant and comfortable.&#8221; Tr. Devi Chand</p>
<p>I have provided Arya Samaj translation of Yajur Veda which the writer has quoted, readers can check explanation of Yajur Veda 26.2 in the article <a href="/index.php/2014/01/01/caste-and-racial-discrimination/" data-wpel-link="internal">Caste and Racial discrimination</a>. Manu Smriti recommends Upanayana only for Brahmin, Kshatriya and Vaishya students, moreover it does forbid the Shudra from studying the Vedas, it is already refuted in the article <a href="/index.php/2019/03/05/caste-system-in-hinduism/" data-wpel-link="internal">Caste System in Hinduism</a>.</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 1.58 &#8220;Having framed this, (code) at the beginning of creation, he (Brahma) taught it to me in conformity with the rites laid down in the Sastras; and I, in my turn, communicated it to Marichi and other Munis.&#8221; Tr. Dutt</p>
<p>Acharya Kulluka writes,</p>
<p>&#8220;Brahma originally composed a Samhita containing a hundred thousand couplets and taught it to Manu, who, in tuen, summarized the work and wrote it out again in his own language.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Manu Smriti is actually the word of god, so when the writer claims that Manu has undergone corruption then what makes him think Vedas are secure from interpolations? Don&#8217;t believe me, but at least believe in what your own Hindu scholars and scriptures say. As per Hindu scholars only 6% of Veda is available today while rest 94% is lost, this has been proven on the basis of Hindu texts by Swami B.V. Giri, read the article <a href="/index.php/2014/05/14/hindu-scriptures-battle-of-supremacy/" data-wpel-link="internal">Hindu scriptures Battle of supremacy</a> and also the article <a href="/index.php/2014/01/02/textual-corruption-of-the-vedas/" data-wpel-link="internal">Textual corruption of Vedas</a>. Forget about Bible or Quran, do Hindus have a copy of the copy of the copy of the copy of the original Veda? Hindus can continue to assume that Vedas are intact but the fact is it underwent interpolations.</p>
<p>Caste system is an integral part of Hinduism, without caste system there can be no Hinduism and without Hinduism there can be no caste system. Hence instead of defending such texts by misinterpreting them Hindus should renounce Hinduism.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Written by Ibn Muhammad</p>
<p>The &#8216;once upon a time&#8217; stories do not appeal to me anymore. Pick up any such story and it is a pure fiction. No wonder kids love such stories. Agniveer&#8217;s latest response (should it be even called a response) is purely fictional, a castle of lies to deceive the ordinary people and a desperate attempt to repair his lost credibility. The so-called response deals more with teaching ways of mockery than a serious response to our research article. By addressing about half of the article to senseless insults, he hoped to distract his blind followers from the seriousness of our article. He invents some &#8216;Panchatantra&#8217; stories which have no space in a scholarly discussion. I do not have this time and energy to write similar stuff. I only concern myself to what is being said, instead of who is saying it.</p>
<p><span id="more-901"></span></p>
<p>The lies of Agniveer start outright when he says,</p>
<p>A recent attempt has been by writing articles based on extremely outdated claims to prove that Vedas are also textually corrupted. <strong>We initially chose to ignore this long-rejected stupid research.</strong> We thought that someone else would counter it along with flat-earth theory while we focus on other prominent tasks. But considering the widespread promotion that is being provided to this viewpoint by petro-dollar power holders, we thought to have at least a short analysis debunking the myth. Because in an era of misinformation, truth is often nothing but a lie shouted thousand times!</p>
<p>Did Agniveer really ignore my article? I published my article on March 16, 2011. There was a consternation in the Vedic camp. See the comments section of Agniveer. Then, I made a video on the main points of my article. The video can be seen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ueydb0yQN_g" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">here<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. Since Agniveer is no scholar of the Vedas, he must have tried first to somehow refute me. When he couldn&#8217;t he appealed more knowledgeable Arya Samajis for help. Agniveer started a new separate thread in the Arya Samaj community on orkut. Here is the link to the thread.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131015022445/http:/www.orkut.co.in/CommMsgs?cmm=146924&amp;tid=5600429116996922782" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">http://www.orkut.co.in/CommMsgs?cmm=146924&amp;tid=5600429116996922782<br />
<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>As you can see Agniveer desperately appealing for help from his associates. The associates, being more wise than Agniveer, felt the gravity of my arguments. One associate advised Agniveer not to be hasty and come to Bilaspur and learn the Vedas properly. But Alas, Agniveer, who is an IIT pass-out considered it below his dignity to go and learn the Vedas properly. The hasty rebuttal he has published on his website clearly exposes his shallow knowledge of the Vedas.</p>
<p>You can also notice in the link given above, that there is a lot of infighting among Hindus on the exact nature of shaakhaas (branches). They started to cut each others viewpoints and poke fun at each other. If the very brains to whom Agniveer went begging for help could not solve the problem, you can imagine of what quality the borrowed rebuttal of Agniveer would be.</p>
<p>Agniveer is so scared of our website that he dared not mention the <a href="/index.php/2014/01/02/textual-corruption-of-the-vedas/" data-wpel-link="internal"><strong>source article</strong></a> which he was refuting. He never mentioned my name. This speaks volumes of the spirit inculcated in him by the Vedas. At least he should have let his audience know what he is refuting. Instead he chose to paraphrase my arguments so that they look ordinary. Agniveer hopes to keep his blind followers in the dark. But for how long. The wind of truth will soon blow apart the structure of lies.</p>
<p>Ignoring the unnecessary rants of Agniveer, I would directly go into the subject and expose the asinine arguments of Agniveer.</p>
<p><strong>What is the total number of Vedas?</strong></p>
<p>Agniveer has resorted to mighty deception to somehow do away with this vital question which will shake the very foundations of the Arya Dharma/Hinduism call it what you like. It seems that this IIT pass-out has to be taught the fundamentals of counting. Let me give you an example, to rip apart his tapestry of deception.</p>
<p>Agniveer wrote,</p>
<p>If you consider only knowledge, Vedas is only 1. If you consider <strong>Para and Apara</strong> knowledge (liberating and mundane knowledge), then Vedas are 2. If you focus on <strong>Knowledge, Action and Contemplation</strong>, Vedas are 3. If you consider <strong>Rik, Yajuh, Sama, Atharva</strong>, Vedas are 4. If you consider each mandala of Rigveda as separate, then there are 10 Rigvedas. Similarly we have 40 Yajurvedas. If you take each mantra as a different Veda, you have more than 20,000 Vedas.</p>
<p>So number does not matter. They all point to same set of mantras.</p>
<p>What deception?</p>
<p>Consider the letters of the English alphabet. How many letters are there in the English alphabet? Every good student will answer 26. But one IIT pass-out says, &#8220;it depends&#8221;. If you consider only <strong>alphabet</strong> there is only 1. If you consider  <strong>vowels and consonants </strong>there are 2. If you consider <strong>&#8216;the English alphabet&#8217;</strong> there are 17. If you consider <strong>a, e, i, o, u</strong> there are 5. If you consider <strong>b, c, d, f, g, h, j, k, l, m, n, p, q, r, s, t, v, w, x, y, z</strong> there are 21.</p>
<p>So number does not matter. They all point to the same set of letters.</p>
<p>Does not this IIT pass-out need to be sacked from his job immediately if he is employed? Should not his degree be declared fraudulent? Is this man not a danger to society who can sell his integrity to defend some primitive texts? He cannot even differentiate between the words &#8216;number&#8217; and &#8216;type&#8217;. This  simpleton IIT pass-out has been so shocked by our research that he has lost all sense. I had  heard a joke on engineers, but did not know that engineer was the great Agniveer himself.</p>
<p><strong>Ques: Prove that 2/10=2.</strong></p>
<p>Art student : Out of syllabus<br />
Commerce student : Question hi galat hai<br />
Medical student : It&#8217;s strange yaar, ye kaise ho sakta hai?<br />
Agniveer : It is very easy</p>
<p>2=two<br />
10=ten,</p>
<p>Therefore,  2/10 = two/ten</p>
<p>cancelling (t) we get</p>
<p>wo/en—- (1)</p>
<p>W=23rd letter of the alphabet<br />
O=15th letter of the alphabet<br />
E=5th letter of the alphabet<br />
N=14th letter of the alphabet</p>
<p>therefore,</p>
<p>w+o=23+15=38<br />
&amp; e+n=5+14=19<br />
.<br />
Substituting these values in (1)</p>
<p>wo/en = 38/19 = 2<br />
<strong><br />
Hence proved!</strong></p>
<p>And the blind followers of Agniveer shout, &#8220;Hail Agniveer Ji&#8221;.</p>
<p>Let me remind Agniveer that when I asked the question, <strong>&#8216;What is the total number of Vedas?&#8217;</strong>, I meant <strong>&#8216;What is the total number of Veda Samhitas?&#8217;</strong> By the title <strong>&#8216;Textual corruption of the Vedas&#8217;</strong> is implied <strong>&#8216;Textual corruption of the Veda Samhitas&#8217;</strong>.</p>
<p>Having said that let us post mortem the dead refutation of Agniveer.</p>
<p>Agniveer has conveniently evaded the testimony of Mahabharata that Vedas were stolen from Brahma, demonstrating their insecurity. It also proved that Vedas were NOT memorized. Agniveer has ignored this. After all Mahabharata has also been written by his own ancestors. Is it not an insult to his ancestors, to accept their one work and reject the other?</p>
<p><strong>The Number of Veda Samhitas</strong></p>
<p>Traditionally the number of Veda Samhitas has been fixed as 4 viz. Rigveda, Yajurveda, Samaveda and Atharvaveda. But this reply does not tell the whole story. Why? Things will become more clear when you will read all of this article.</p>
<ol>
<li>The Rigveda, containing hymns to be recited by the hotr;</li>
<li>The Yajurveda, containing formulas to be recited by the adhvaryu or officiating priest;</li>
<li>The Samaveda, containing formulas to be sung by the udgātr.</li>
<li>The Atharvaveda, a collection of spells and incantations, apotropaic charms and speculative hymns.</li>
</ol>
<p>One information must be remembered. The words Rigveda, Yajurveda, Samaveda and Atharvaveda are NEVER mentioned in the Veda Samhitas. All these names have been given by Brahmins to identify the books. The earlier terms referred to the different styles of composition, They were:</p>
<ol>
<li>ricah, stanzas of praise</li>
<li>yajunsh, liturgical stanzas and formulas</li>
<li>saman, melodies</li>
<li>atharvangirasah, blessings and curses.</li>
</ol>
<p>But the collection which now goes by the name of Rig-veda contains in its later parts &#8216;blessings and curses&#8217;, as well as &#8216;stanzas of praise&#8217;, together with most of the stanzas which form the text to the saman melodies of the Sama-veda. Similarly the Atharva-veda contains ricah, &#8216;stanzas of praise, and yajunshi, &#8216;liturgical stanzas&#8217; mostly worked over for its own purposes, as well as its characteristic &#8216;blessings and curses&#8217;. The Yajur-veda also contains matter of the other Vedic types in addition to liturgical formulae. The Sama-veda is merely a collection of certain ricah or &#8216;stanzas of praise&#8217;, taken with variations and additions from the Rig-veda, and set to tunes indicated by musical notations.</p>
<p>So each Veda Samhita is a mixture of all types of mantras. Thus, Rigveda can be called Samaveda , Atharvaveda and vice-versa. Atharvaveda can be called Rigveda or Yajurveda. Same is the case with other Veda Samhitas.</p>
<p>Now to our burning question,<strong> what is the total number of Veda Samhitas?</strong></p>
<p>Let me use the statement of Patanjali Rishi as the base to solve this question. In the Mahabhashya, he says,</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-7536" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-33.png" alt="http://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/060218_0654_testingresp1.png" width="452" height="116" /></p>
<p>The four Vedas, <strong>along-with their parts</strong> diffuse into many forms. There are 101 Shakhas of Yajurveda, 1000 of Samaveda, 21 of Rigveda and 9 of Atharvaveda.</p>
<p>Adding these numbers we get a figure of 1131 Shaakhaas. Agniveer has not responded to this basic question in a clear and coherent manner.  His dilemma can be understood. This is an issue which shakes the foundations of Vedic Dharma.. The Guru of Agniveer, when asked about this issue said,</p>
<p><strong>Q. How many Shaakhaas (branches) are there of the Veda?</strong></p>
<p>A. Eleven hundred and twenty-seven.</p>
<p><strong>Q. What are Shaakhaas (branches)? </strong></p>
<p>A. The expositions are called shaakhaas.</p>
<p><strong>Q. We hear of learned people speaking of the different parts of the Veda as shaakhaas. Are they wrong?</strong></p>
<p>A. If you think over it a little, you will understand that they are in the wrong, because all the Shaakhaas are attributed to Rishis such as Ashwalaayani and others, whilst the authorship of the Veda is ascribed to God. It other words, as the author of the four Vedas is believed to be God, so are Rishis held to be the authors of the shaakhaas, such as Ashwalaayani. And besides, all the shaakhaas take Veda texts and expound them, while in the Veda texts only are given. Therefore, the four Vedas – the books of Divine revelation – are like the trunk of a tree, whose branches (shaakhaas) are the books, such as Ashwalaayani, <strong>written by Rishis and not revealed by God</strong>… [Satyarth Prakash, Chapter 7]
<p>There is not a shred of evidence to prove that there are 1127 Shaakhaas of the Veda.  Patanjali Rishi CLEARLY says 1131 Shaakhaas.No classical text mentions 1127 Shaakhaas. The Swami is clearly lying here.</p>
<p>Agniveer wrote,</p>
<p>Oh No. Not again. Branch refers to a particular recension style of Vedas to emphasize certain aspects and making it relevant to existing time and society. <strong>Branches or Shakhas are not eternal</strong>. But original Vedas have been preserved as they were even till today.</p>
<p>The quotation of Maharishi Patanjali is very clear. <strong>The four Vedas are made of 1131 parts and these parts are the Shaakhaas and these Shaakhaas include those which are held as originals by Agniveer.</strong> Shaakal Shaakha (present Rigveda) is already included in the 21 Shaakhas of Rigveda. So, according to the confession of Agniveer even that is not eternal.</p>
<p>However, the answer to the question, &#8216;What is the total number of Veda samhitas?&#8217; is very simple. There are 1131 Veda Samhitas which on the basis of the mantra types are divided into 4. The 1131 Shaakhaas can be understood as 1131 versions of Vedas. To make it simple for you, Rigveda has 21 VERSIONS, Yajurveda has 101 VERSIONS, Samaveda has 1000 VERSIONS and Atharvaveda has 9 VERSIONS. The bogus claims of Agniveer are buried by this simple FACT that<strong> each Shaakhaa had its own Samhita, Brahman, Aranyak and Upanishad.</strong> So dear readers, what does this tell you? Either Agniveer does not know his own religion or he is lying. If it is the later it is devilish and if it is the former it is inexcusable.</p>
<p>Out of these 1131 VEDA SAMHITAS 1120 Samhitas are lost. In other words, 99% of the Vedas are LOST.</p>
<p>Notice that Swami Dayanand Saraswati says that Shaakhaas are expositions of the ORIGINAL Vedas. But Agniveer is then lying when he says,</p>
<p>&#8220;Now some fools argue that why are original Vedas are also called by name of Shakhas. The answer is that the name of Shakha is derived from the Rishi who ensured its preservation from generation to generation. Some Rishis chose to promote the variations so as to propagate their meaning among masses and specialized students. Some volunteered to continue preserving the original Vedas so that more Shakhas could be created in future. Why should we not acknowledge these Rishis? Hence Shaakal chose to preserve the Rigveda, Madhyandin chose to preserve Yajurveda, Shaunak chose to preserve Atharveveda and Kauthum chose to protect Samaveda. These refer not only to individuals but entire traditions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Can Agniveer bring any valid proof to justify his claim? There is not a shred of evidence to prove what Agniveer said. Where do classical scholars of Hinduism claim that only Shaakal Samhita is the original? That is a challenge to Agniveer. If Shaakal Rishi preserved the &#8216;original&#8217; Rigveda (Shaakal Shaakha), why are the Samhitas, Brahmans, Aranyaks and Upanishads different for each Shaakha? Agniveer is compelled to promote unorthodox ideas to defend his sect.</p>

<p>As you can see, each Shaakha has its own Samhita. There is no one Samhita. Agniveer, therefore, is clearly lying on this important issue and why should he not lie when his guru, Moolshanker, condones lying to defend their Dharma. Swami Danayanad commenting on Shakanacharya says,</p>
<p>&#8220;Now it must be understood that if it was the belief of Shankar that God and the human soul were identical and that the world was an illusion, it was not good; <strong>but if he had avowed this doctrine simply in order to refute Jainism more successfully, it was a little good.</strong>&#8221; [Satyarth Prakash, Chapter 11]
<p>So. Agniveer has already got his license to deceive.</p>
<p>Let me elaborate on the nature of the disputes between various Shaakhaas to bury Agniveer&#8217;s deceptive arguments once and for all.</p>
<p><strong>Nature of Disputes between various Shaakhaas with special reference to Yajurveda</strong></p>
<p>Comparing all the available manuscripts of the Yajurveda, we come to know that they are NOT mere expositions of the so-called originals. Rather, they contain many different mantras than those found in others. Broadly classified, Yajurveda has two branches, Krishna and Shukla. The former is predominant in South India and the latter in North India. At the time of Patanjali Rishi, the Kathaka Samhita was predominant as stated in Mahabhashya 4:3:101.</p>
<p>The different Samhitas differ in the number of mantras, arrangement of mantras, etc. Following is the brief list of the variations:</p>
<p>1. The very first mantras of all Samhitas are variant. For example see the image below.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="545" height="586" class="wp-image-7537" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-34.png" alt="http://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/060218_0654_testingresp2.png" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-34.png 545w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-34-279x300.png 279w" sizes="(max-width: 545px) 100vw, 545px" /></p>
<p>2. The last mantra of these Samhitas is also different.</p>
<p>3. There is huge difference in the total number of mantras of all these Samhitas. Vajasneyi Samhita  (Madhyandin) has 1974 mantras, Taittiriya has 1018, Maitrayani has 458, and Katha has 640 mantras.</p>
<p>4. More than 50% of Vajasneyi Samhita is imported from Rigveda. Swami Dayanand, has accepted this fact in the 33rd and 34th chapters of his Yajurveda translation. On this basis, the Vedic scholars are of the opinion that intermixing of the mantras of Yajurveda and Rigveda has actually broken the Yajurveda chain. The mutual coherence of the themes of Yajurveda has been lost and by extension the meanings have also been lost.</p>
<p>All these differences between various Samhitas of Yajurveda reveal the fact that these Samhitas are not the expositions of a so-called original Veda. Rather, these are different versions of one Yajurveda floating around. The true version cannot be found and the mutual rivalry between these versions is not hidden. The followers of one Samhita used to condemn the followers of another Samhita. For example, Shatapath Brahmana 1:7:1:3 condemns the recitation of Taittiriya Samhita.</p>
<p>&#8220;They then let the calves join their mothers. He thereupon touches (each) calf (in order to drive it away from the cow), with the formula , &#8216;The winds are ye!&#8217;–for, indeed, it is this wind that here blows, it is this (wind) that makes swell all the rain that falls here; it is it that makes those (cows) swell; and for this reason he says &#8216;the winds are ye!&#8217; Some people add here the formula,<strong> &#8216;Going near are ye!&#8217;</strong><br />
<strong>but let him not say this</strong>, because thereby another (an enemy) approaches (the sacrificer).&#8221;</p>
<p>Shatapath Brahman here is referring to Taittiriya Samhita 1:1:1:1, which contains the addional words &#8216;Going near are ye&#8217; or &#8216;Ye are approachers&#8217;. In other words, Shatapath Brahman is condemning the recitation of Taittiriya Samhita as FALSE.  Similarly, at many other places in the Shatapath Brahman, Taittiriya Samhita is criticized. How can the likes of Agniveer explain this censure of Taittiriya Samhita by Shatapath Brahman?</p>
<p>This Shaakha issue is now settled. All Shaakhaas are EQUAL contenders of being the originals. Thus there are 1131 Veda Samhitas and now we have 11 Samhitas left. Agniveer has no authority to claim exclusive originality.</p>
<p><strong>Missing Verses</strong></p>
<p>After the collection and codification of Vedas, many different manuscripts gained currency amongst the Brahmin groups. The number of mantras in every manuscript continued to be changed. The current version of Rigveda was collected by Shaakal Rishi and was thus called Shaakal Samhita. It is divided into 10 Mandals (Books).</p>
<p>Nirukt 7:8 mentions the following,</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a joint oblation offered to Agni and Vishnu in the ten books of the Rigveda.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, in the entire Rigveda, there is not a single mantra jointly praising Agni and Vishnu.  What is meant by joint oblation here? An oblation is an offering (Late Latin oblatio, from offerre, oblatum, to offer), a term, particularly in ecclesiastical usage, for a solemn offering or presentation to God. Where is an offering jointly made to Agni and Vishnu, we would like to see? This is a clear evidence that the Rigveda at the time of Yaska Muni had the joint oblation offered to Agni and Vishnu, but it is not found in today&#8217;s Rigveda, demonstrating corruption of the text.</p>
<p>Agniveer wrote,</p>
<p>1. Nirukta wasn&#8217;t preserved in the way Rigveda was. So Rigveda is much more authoritative, especially after scrutiny by even the skeptics as mentioned above.</p>
<p>What a scholarly reply? Is Agniveer prepared to delete all references of Nirukt form his website and throw Nirukt in the dustbin? Why are they still publishing and spreading a polluted book, if it really is polluted? The desperation of Agniveer can be understood. When Rigveda is being blown apart by Nirukt here, Agniveer is choosing the lesser of the two evils and casting doubt on Nirukt to save Rigveda, the source of Hinduism. However, this answer is just not satisfactory. Agniveer first needs to prove that this particular reference of Nirukt is wrong and give evidences of the same. If he is unable to do so, then Rigveda has been obviously changed. He also has to publicly announce that Nirukt is a false book and should not be used to establish anything. Hindu scholars should announce the same in public.</p>
<p>But wait a minute, let Agniveer&#8217;s deception be exposed by his own deception guru, aka Swami Dayananda. In his Magnum Opus, Satyarth Prakash, the Swami lists several books which should be read and others which should be avoided. And guess what? He just rips Agniveer apart. The Swami says,</p>
<p>&#8220;We can liken this to digging up a whole mountain and finding a penny-worth of gold; whilst the study of the books of the great sages can be well likened to the diving of a man into the sea and finding most valuable pearls in one plunge.<br />
3. Then let them read <strong>Nighantoo and Nirukta</strong> (books on Vedic Vocabulary and Philology) by Yaska in six to eight months, but not waste years of their valuable time over Amarkosha and other such books written by atheists.&#8221; [Satyarth Prakash, Chapter 3]
<p>and further down he gives a long list of books to be avoided,</p>
<p>&#8220;The books to be avoided are:-</p>
<p>1. Grammar:-a.Katantra, b. Saaraswata, c. Chandrika, d. Mugdhabodha. e. Kaumudi, f. Shekhar, g. Monorma, etc.<br />
2. Dictionary – Amarkosha, etc.<br />
3. Prosody – Urittaratnakar, etc.<br />
4. Shiksha is the Science which teaches the proper pronunciation of words and laws of euphony. Atka Shiksham Pravakshyami Pranamyan matam yatha.<br />
5. Jotisha (astronomy) – Shighrabodha, Mahurta, Chintaamani, ettc. books on astrology.<br />
6. Poetry – Naya ka bheda, Kuvabja nand, Raghuvansha, Maagha, Kiratarjunira, etc.<br />
7. Mimansa – Dharmasindhu, Vratarka, etc.<br />
8. Visheshika – Tarkasangraha, etc.<br />
9. Nyaya -Yogdishaa, etc.<br />
10. Yoga – Hathapradipka<br />
11. Saankhya – Yagavashishtha, Pancha dashi<br />
12. Medical Service – Sharangdhar.<br />
13. Smriti – all Smritis except the Manu Smirit arring the interpolated verses.<br />
14. all Tantras, Puranaas, Upapuraanaas, Ramaayaana by Tulsi Das, Rukmani Mangala, etc., and all books 9of this kind) written in Bhaashaa.</p>
<p>They ought to be looked upon as snares; once caught in them a student can never know the truth.</p>
<p><strong>Is there no truth to be found in these books?</strong></p>
<p>A.~ There is a sprinkling of truth mixed with a large amount of rubbish, myths and fabrications; but as even the best food mixed with poison is to be avoided, so should these books.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ah! These golden words must be pinned on the walls of Agniveer&#8217;s house. Agniveer has already poisoned many articles on his poisonous website with Nirukta, which according to him is false but not according to his guru. I know Agniveer is merely using deception to refute me, but deep in his heart he must be really ashamed that he condemned the great Nirukt in public.</p>
<p>Then, Agniveer is taking recourse to Indologists to save the Vedas. However, Hindu scholars themselves opine that Vedas have suffered heavy changes. Pandit Ram Gvind Trivedi writes in the preface to his translation of Rigveda,</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="538" height="150" class="wp-image-7538" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-35.png" alt="http://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/060218_0654_testingresp3.png" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-35.png 538w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-35-300x84.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 538px) 100vw, 538px" /></p>
<p>&#8220;According to one Mantra of Rigveda (10:114:8), we come to know that it has 15,000 Mantras. However, when we count the total Mantras, we get 10,469 Mantras. It is possible that  like a large portion of the books of Vedic literature and Vedas were destroyed by the anti-religious, similarly,  Mantras too suffered destruction for many reasons.&#8221;</p>
<p>Agniveer only partially quotes Indologists to deceive the people. Let him taste the same Indologists now.</p>
<p>Prof. Maurice Bloomfield writes in the Introduction to his Hymns of the Atharvaveda,</p>
<p>&#8220;<strong>The nineteenth book is a late addendum, in general very corrupt</strong>; its omission (with the exception of hymns 26, 34, 35, 38, 39, 53, and 54) does not detract much from the general impression left by the body of the collection. The seventeenth book consists of a single hymn of inferior interest. <strong>Again, books XV and XVI, the former entirely Brahmanical prose, the latter almost entirely so, are of doubtful quality and chronology.</strong> Finally, books XIV and XVIII contain respectively the wedding and funeral stanzas of the Atharvan, and are largely coincident with corresponding Mantras of the tenth book of the Rig-veda: they are, granted their intrinsic interest, not specifically Atharvanic.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dr. A.A. Macdonell echoes the same views about Atharvaveda in his book A History of Sanskrit Literature,</p>
<p>&#8220;<strong>The last two books are manifestly late additions.</strong> Book XIX. consists of a mixture of supplementary pieces, <strong>part of the text of which is rather corrupt.</strong> Book XX., with a slight exception, contains only complete hymns addressed to Indra, which are borrowed directly and without any variation from the Rigveda. The fact that its readings are identical with those of the Rigveda would alone suffice to show that it is of later date than the original books, the readings of which show considerable divergences from those of the older Veda. <strong>There is, however, more convincing proof of the lateness of this book.</strong> Its matter relates to the Soma ritual, and is entirely foreign to the spirit of the Atharva-veda. <strong>It was undoubtedly added to establish the claim of the Atharva to the position of a fourth Veda</strong>, by bringing it into connection with the recognised sacrificial ceremonial of the three old Vedas. This book, again, as well . as the nineteenth, is not noticed in the Praticakhya of the Atharva-veda. <strong>Both of them must, therefore, have been added after that work was composed.</strong> Excepting two prose pieces (48 and 49) the only original part of Book XX. is the so-called kuntapa hymns (127-136). &#8221;</p>
[A History of Sanskrit Literature, A. A. Macdonell, Printed in 1900, Page 188]
<p>Dr. Macdonell even exposes the Rigveda in the following words,</p>
<p>&#8220;The importance of the latter as a criterion of the authenticity of verses in the Rigveda is indicated by the following fact. <strong>There are six verses in the Rigveda not analysed in the Pada text, but only given there over again in the Samhita form. This shows that Sakalya did not acknowledge them as truly Rigvedic, a view justified by internal evidence.</strong> This group of six, which is doubtless exhaustive, stands midway between old additions which (Sakalya recognised as canonical, and the new appendages called Khilas, which never gained admission into the Pada text in any form.&#8221;</p>
<p>The six verses he is referring to are, Rigveda 7:59:12, 10:20:1, 10:121:10 and 10:190:1,2,3.</p>
<p>Now, Agniveer should also get rid of Atharvaveda and well as these six verses, when the Indologists are confirming it.</p>
<p>Agniveer, the misled fanatic wrote,</p>
<p>2. The Vishnu of Vedas is same as the Agni. Both refer to same Singular Supreme Entity. Only the misled see polytheism in Vedas. So joint oblation to Vishnu and Agni is applicable to any mantra that can be interpreted to imply those characteristics of Supreme that are common in meaning of Agni and Vishnu. This is a research subject for those who have skills to contemplate deeply on mantras. There is nothing conflicting in it. At best one can say that – Since I don&#8217;t know anything about Vedas because knowing that would put me in Hell, hence I cannot understand it.</p>
<p>The topic of Vedic deities is a separate one, which is beyond the scope of this article. However, to briefly respond to the bogus claims of Agniveer, he is trivializing the text of the Vedas because he thinks it is his personal property and he can twist it as he likes. Extending his bogus argument, Agnim ile purohitam can be changed to Vaishnam ile purohitam and there will be no difference. May be  Maharishi Agniveer has an intention of producing his own Samhita of Rigveda and is therefore propounding unorthodox views to deceive the people. He is going to the extent of calling Yaska Acharya &#8216;misled&#8217; because Yaska speaks of plural deities in the Vedas. Notice the original words of Yaska, &#8220;There is a <strong>joint oblation</strong> offered to Agni <strong>and</strong> Vishnu in the ten books of the Rigveda.&#8221; No person in his right mind can say that Yaska is speaking of the same deity. If Agni and Vishnu were same, then the words &#8216;joint oblation&#8217; become absurd. Agniveer is considering himself smarter than classical Hindu scholars. He is free to do all the research he needs, but he will evidently fail.</p>
<p>Agniveer wrote,</p>
<p>&#8220;3. Interestingly the very people who are currently raising this childish allegation are the ones who also attempt to prove that Vedas talk of only one Single God. But they use this argument when they want to prove that Vedas and their modern scripture both talk of the same Singular God, but because their scripture is latest, hence that latest version should be followed. Hence everyone should start believing in their religion to escape Hell.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is another proof that Agniveer is not in his right mind. Who is he talking about? Where have I ever claimed that Vedas talk of only one Single God? Agniveer needs to spend time and study my articles thoroughly before writing nonsense. I have time and time again emphasized that Vedas teach only NATURE WORSHIP, DARK POLYTHEISM AND PANTHEISM. I suggest that readers read my article <a href="/index.php/2014/01/02/what-is-hinduism/" data-wpel-link="internal">What is Hinduism?</a> to know my position on the conception of &#8216;gods&#8217; in Vedas. May be Agniveer is dreaming that I am affiliated with IRF. I do not endorse the research of IRF on Hinduism, specially the concept of God in Hinduism. Dr. Zakir Naik is wrongly propagating that Vedas speak about one God, but then again, he bases his arguments on the works of Arya Samaj. I intend to write a separate article refuting the notion that Vedas speak of one Supreme God.</p>

<p><strong>Corruption in recitation</strong></p>
<p>The oral tradition of the Vedas (Śrauta) consists of several pathas, &#8220;recitations&#8221; or ways of chanting the Vedic mantras.The padapatha consists of dividing the sentence into individual pada or words. The kramapatha consists of pairing two words at a time. There has been a lot of corruption in the former recitation. I will give some examples to demonstrate this.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1</strong></p>
<p>Yask Muni, the author of Nirukt and Nighantu, writes that Vaayah is one word [See Nirukt 6:28]. But in the Shaakal Shakha&#8217;s (Rigveda&#8217;s) padapatha, it has been divided and hence became meaningless. Rigveda 10:29:1 is the place which has made the mistake.</p>

<p>&#8220;As sits the young bird on the tree rejoicing, ye, swift Pair, have been roused by clear laudation,…&#8221;</p>
<p>Yaska himself criticizes Shakalya and says,</p>
<p>&#8220;Sakalya has analyzed <strong>Vaayah </strong>into <strong>Vaa </strong>and <strong>yah</strong>, then the finite verb would have had the accute accent and the sense have been incomplete.&#8221;</p>
<p>Agniveer wrote ,</p>
<p>Whether we take the word as &#8216;Va + Yah&#8217; or Vayo, they both are pronounced in exactly the same manner. Same is true for &#8216;Ma + Iha + Naasti&#8217;. However in Vedic mantras, these words come us Vayo and Mehanaasti. Scholars can have disputes over how the word should be interpreted. This is a research topic. Depending on their views, they can have different Pada Paatha or break-up of the words. <strong>Perhaps during Yaska&#8217;s time, someone broke the word in wrong manner and hence he had to counter it.</strong> Similar to the way even we have to counter the most outdated concepts even today despite the availability of thoroughly verified and edited Vedas!</p>
<p><strong>Pada Paatha is NOT original Vedas. </strong>It is one way of preserving Vedas. There are 9 more. Refer <a href="http://agniveer.com/2697/no-textual-corruption-in-vedas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">http://agniveer.com/2697/no-textual-corruption-in-vedas/<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. If an error comes in Pada Patha, it is corrected by comparing with other methods. And hence today, there is no doubt over what the original Vedic mantras are. (Thanks to efforts of sages like Yaska from time to time.) I recommend looking at editions of Pt Damodar Satvalekar which is accepted widely as the most corrected published version.</p>
<p>Agniveer is again shooting himself in the foot. This IITian can&#8217;t  even read properly. Yaska has not countered a &#8216;someone&#8217;, but Sakalya himself. &#8220;<strong>Sakalya</strong> has analyzed <strong>Vaayah </strong>into <strong>Vaa </strong>and <strong>yah</strong>, then the finite verb would have had the accute accent and the <strong>sense have been incomplete</strong>.&#8221; The  question  here is not whether pada patha is the original or not. The important thing to notice here is that Agniveer&#8217;s &#8216;original&#8217; Rigveda is under fire from Yaska. Yaska is exposing the mistake of Shaakal Samhita. So, agniveer is caught deceiving again. The false reading of Rigveda has continued to our time also and agniveer is reading the same.</p>
<p>Regarding <strong>Mehanaasti</strong>, Yaska is again showing how Sakalya is wrong and Gargya the author of Samaveda pada patha is right. So, Agniveer is lying here too.</p>
<p><strong>Different versions of Rigveda</strong></p>
<p>Shaakal Rishi is called as the collector of Rigveda. He had a number of students, who later expressed many differences and compiled their own versions of Rigveda. numbering upto 21. There are major differences between the Shaakal and Baskal samhitas of Rigveda. The Śākala recension has 1,017 regular hymns, while the Bāṣkala samhita has a total of 1025 hymns.  Thus, around  some 50 mantras are missing in Śākala samhita. There are differences even over the total number of mantras.</p>
<p>The detailed analysis of the mantra differences in Rigveda will be dealth in a separate article.</p>
<p><strong>Different versions of Yajurveda</strong></p>
<p>Agniveer wrote,</p>
<p>1. Black or Krishna Yajurveda is a branch (Shakha) and not original Yajurveda. It contains original mantras modified along with historical and explanatory descriptions to suit research interests of specific kind. Shukla or White Yajurveda refers to those branches of Yajurveda that modify the original mantras if required but do not add additional texts. The Madhyandini Yajurveda of Shukla Branch is the original Yajurveda and rest are its variations.</p>
<p>Another bogus claim devoid of any solid proof. I have already shown the nature of disputes between various Samhitas of Yajurveda. Refer to that discussion. There is no proof that only the Madhyandin Samhita is the original and not the others. Agniveer is conditioned to believe that Madhyandin is the original. What Agniveer is considering as original is considered an exposition in South India and vice versa. Agniveer deceptively ignored the meat of my argument. Anyway i will repeat it to sink it into his mind.</p>
<p><strong>Difference between Krishna (Black) and Shukla (White) Yajurveda</strong></p>
<p>The Vishnu Purana gives the following explanation of their names : Vaisampayana, a pupil of the great Vyasa, was the original teacher of the Black Yajur-Veda. Yajnavalkya, one of his disciples, having displeased him, was called upon by his master to part with the knowledge which he had acquired from him. He forthwith vomited the Yajur-Yeda. The other disciples of Vaisampayana, assuming the form of partridges (tittiri), picked up from the ground its several dirtied texts. From this circumstance it received the name of Taittiriya Krishna Yajur-Veda.</p>
<p>Yajnavalkya afterwards, by the performance of severe penances, induced the Sun God to impart to him those Yajur texts which his master had not possessed. The Sun God then assumed the form of a horse (Vajin), and communicated to him the desired texts. Hence the Sanhita was called Vajasaneyi, and also White (or bright) because it was revealed by the Sun God.</p>
<p>There was a lot of hostility between the two groups.</p>
<p>Agniveer wrote,</p>
<p>So in case you do not have access to original Yajurveda, start with a branch. That would be much more easy to approach due to explanations and simplifications. And when you have mastered them, you can have the taste of the original. The keen minds who are less paranoid and more zealous can approach the original directly as well!</p>
<p>Thus, as per Maharishi Agniveer, making the Madhyandin Samhita available online for common public is a mistake. They need to first read the man made books and then the original. But wait, did we not already see that Shatapath Brahman condemns Taittiriya Samhita as false. So why is Agniveer promoting false texts? May be he has some hidden agenda.</p>
<p>Agniveer wrote,</p>
<p>2. Ishopanishad is nothing but the 40th Chapter of Yajurveda as <strong>it appears in a particular branch of Black Yajurveda</strong> with some modifications. Because this is the greatest text on spiritualism and philosophy and mother of all other texts like Geeta, other Upanishads and even Darshans, it has a special place in Vedic literature. Being mother of all Upanishads, it is called Isha Upanishad. Only a paranoid can explain why he or she thinks that Isha Upanishad cannot be part of Yajurveda.</p>
<p>The deceptive game of Agniveer continues.  Agniveer just claimed in point number 1 that Black or Krishna Yajurveda is a branch (Shakha) and not original Yajurveda. But here he is taking recourse to  this very shaakha in order to establish the validity of the Ishopanishad. I told you he is a deceiver.</p>
<p>Further, according to Agniveer&#8217;s Arya Samaj, Upanishads are NOT Shruti (revealed). Then, how come has this Upanishad been added to the Veda Samhita? Maharishi Agniveer gives this reason; &#8220;Because this is the greatest text on spiritualism and philosophy and mother of all other texts like Geeta, other Upanishads and even Darshans, it has a special place in Vedic literature.&#8221;</p>
<p>The same argument is given by orthodox Hindus as well in favour of the other Upanishads being revealed texts. Why then does Agniveer not consider other upanishads as revealed also? By interpolatng an Upanishad into the Vedic samhita, Agniveer is proving that Vedas are devoid of spirituality and that man-made texts like Ishopanishad is superior to Vedas. We have always been saying that Vedic Samhitas are simply useless. Upanishads are far better than Veda Samhitas.</p>
<p>Now you can judge who is a paranoid.</p>
<p>Agniveer evades vital questions</p>
<p>In dealing with my arguments about the problems with the Yajurveda texts, Agniveer evaded answering many points with the hope that his blind followers will never check the article properly. Agniveer was so scared of the truth that he did not even give the link of our article and neither mentioned the source article he was refuting. All this exposes his grand claims that he is for truth and truth alone.</p>
<p>Questions which Agniveer did not answer:</p>
<p>1. Agniveer did not answer about the schism between the people of Black and White Yajurveda.</p>
<p>2. He did not respond to the differences between the two rival samhitas, in the number and arrangement of mantras.</p>
<p>2. Agniveer also ignored the argument that a lot of Brahamanas have been inserted into the text of the Yajurveda. For example, Adhyay 24 is entirely a Brahman; Adhyay 30: verses 7 through 15 are all Brahmanas and not Mantras. Agniveer did not respond to this. What are Brahmanas doing in Shukla Yajurveda, which he holds as original? Shatapath Brahmana 4:2:3:7-8 testifies to this interpolation of Brahmans in the Samhita as follows:</p>
<p>7. He draws it without (reciting) a puroruk; for the puroruk is a song of praise, since the puroruk is a Rik, and the song of praise is Rik; and the libation is Sâman; and what other (formula) he mutters, that is Yagus. <strong>Formerly these same (puroruk verses) were apart from the Riks, apart from the Yagus, and apart from the Sâmans</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>8. The devatas said, &#8216;Come, let us place them among the Yagus:</strong> thus this science will be still more manifold.&#8217; Accordingly they placed them among the Yagus, and thenceforward this science was still more manifold.</p>
<p>This rips aparts the deception of Agniveer that Madhyandin Samhita is the original.</p>
<p><strong>How Arya Samaj corrupts the Vedas?</strong></p>
<p>1. In the Yajurveda Bhasya of Dayanand Ji, Adhyay 9, Mantra 20 has been distorted by adding the word Gamyaat, which is not to be found in the text. Where did this word come from?</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="441" height="546" class="wp-image-7540" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-37.png" alt="http://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/060218_0654_testingresp5.png" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-37.png 441w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-37-242x300.png 242w" sizes="(max-width: 441px) 100vw, 441px" /></p>
<p>Agniveer wrote,</p>
<p>1. Did Swami Dayanand add the word in the mantra? No. The word is found only in Hindi translation in some editions. Now Swami Dayanand used to dictate meaning in Sanskrit to his pundits who would then translate it in Hindi as well as transcribe what he said.</p>
<p>But even if he or his pundit added the word in explanation, then you should be thankful to him for attempting to simplify things instead of taking exceptions.</p>
<p>2. Even if Swami Dayanand added the word in the mantra, that does not make Yajurveda corrupted. It only means that Swami Dayanand made an error. When did Vedas or Agniveer or Swami Dayanand claim that humans are fully perfect?</p>
<p>There is a marked contradiction between point 1 and 2. If point 1 is correct then point 2 is incorrect and vice versa. The Swami has added the word in bracket which means he is hoping to deceive people that this is part of the text. All the words in brackets mean they are part of the text. Agniveer would do well to remove this error (read deception) from the market.</p>
<p>2. Comparing the Yajurveda of Gayatri Parivar and Arya Samaj, there are many mantras missing in one or another of the versions. For example, the 25th Chapter of Gayatri Parivar Yajurveda has 47 mantras. Even the Yajurveda of Ralph Griffith has 47 mantras. But, the Arya Samaj version has an additional Mantra 48.</p>
<p>Agniveer, the new Maharishi, wrote,</p>
<p>1. So your anger is towards additional <strong>bonus </strong>that Arya Samaj translation gives you, if I understand properly. This means that you admit original Vedas to be a subset of existing Vedas with one less mantra. Hence there is no <strong>loss</strong> of information at least.</p>
<p>This type of bonus is present in other samhitas of Yajurveda as well, according to you. Then, all your above arguments simply stand nullified by this one. Dear readers, do you remember what Agniveer wrote earlier? If you have forgotten, I will republish the golden words,</p>
<p>&#8220;Black or Krishna Yajurveda is a branch (Shakha) and not original Yajurveda.<strong> It contains original mantras modified along with historical and explanatory descriptions to suit research interests of specific kind. Shukla or White Yajurveda refers to those branches of Yajurveda that modify the original mantras if required but do not add additional texts. </strong>The Madhyandini Yajurveda of Shukla Branch is the original Yajurveda and rest are its variations.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, according to Maharishi Agniveer, Black or Krishna Yajurveda is not original because it contains many bonuses. Therefore, I thank Agniveer for adding a bonus mantra in his so-called original and proving that his Yajurveda IS NOT ORIGINAL ANYMORE. The corollary would be like this. If one bonus mantra of Arya Samaj makes no difference to the text, then the many bonus mantras of other Samhitas proves that they are more desrving to be called originals.</p>
<p>Agniveer wrote,</p>
<p>2. Now if we review this mantra, is it against rest of the Vedas in its message? If not, then what is the cause of concern. If you get one additional sentence in Einstein&#8217;s text on relativity that was written later by an editor but only emphasizes what Einstein says in rest of the paper, how is that a problem?</p>
<p>Are the bonuses of the other samhitas against their own mantras? Then what are you telling us they are not originals? What is the cause of concern? By giving Einsteins example, you are digging your own grave. No sane person would ever edit the TEXT of Einsteins work. They will only add their explanation and they would mention that this is an explanation and not written by Einstein, so that people do not confuse it with Einsteins words. But you have added the &#8216;new bonus mantra&#8217; in the TEXT and without even mentioning in the footnote that it is not in the original. This is called fraud and we should not trust fraud people. What say you Maharishi Agniveer? Also if other Shaakhaas added explanations, which obiously do not contradict the text, are you not riding in the same boat?</p>
<p>Agniveer wrote,</p>
<p>3. This is an objection only for those who think that if they mug up the book of divine and say a big sorry for all their misdeeds and laziness to Supreme Lord, they would easily get Heaven full of virgins. But for Vedic followers, there are no shortcuts to success. You have to practice what you learn in actions and keep exploring the truth within. And when you have liberated yourself from ignorance significantly, you would well have re-ignited the Vedas within. <strong>So one harmless mantra in one edition makes absolutely no difference.</strong> The only cause of concern could have been if the verse misled you, which it does not.</p>
<p>Let Maharishi Agniveer  produce some evidence for the false charges he has made. Where have we ever said that just by muggin up the Quran and doing misdeeds will give us heaven? Where does the Noble Quran say so? How do we know that ONLY ONE HARMLESS MANTRA has been added to the text? If you can add a mantra to the text, it shows that Vedas can be made by man. Agniveer Ji, I already knew Vedas were nothing special and are man made. If the verse does not mislead me, so is the case with other Samhitas.</p>
<p>Regarding virgins of Vedic Swarga, Maharishi Agniveer can read my artcles,</p>

</ul>
<p>Did Agniveer say that for Vedic followers there are no shortcuts to success? Maharishi! haven&#8217;t you read the Vedas? If you haven&#8217;t, let me tell you the Vedic shortcuts of entering Paradise.</p>

<p>Agniveer wrote,</p>
<p>4. By the way, the 25th Chapter has only 47 mantras and that is accepted by one and all. <strong>Some publishers publish an additional mantra due to relevance of context. Perhaps someone inserted it years ago and then no printer bothered to or rather was not competent enough to scrutinize it.</strong> Please send us the name of the publisher and we shall write to him to correct the mistake. Or even you can write so referring to this article.</p>
<p>So, now you are saying it is not a &#8216;bonus mantra&#8217;? What happened dear? Let it remain there. Why bother to correct this &#8216;mistake&#8217;? If you needed a Muslim to tell you that mischief has been done to the Vedic text, then you all need to hang yourselves in shame. For 150 years you let the verse remain in the text and want to remove it now? Someone rightly said, Arya Samajis are the biggest frauds. The &#8216;bonus mantra&#8217; is given by all Arya publishers. I can only imagine, how many such mantras would have been made up &#8216;due to relevance of the context&#8217;. Poor Yajurveda. I think Agniveer should now follow Taittiriya Samhita. His Madhyandin has disappointed me. Notice that Agniveer is contradicting himself in the same mantra. On one hand he says that the &#8216;PUBLISHERS&#8217; added it due to relevance of context and on the other hand he is mocking them by saying they are not competent. If they WILLINGLY added it why will they scrutinize it?</p>
<p>3. In Yajurveda Bhashya of Dayanand Ji Adhyay 26, mantra 26, the word <strong>Ayohatay<br />
</strong> was changed to <strong>Apohatay.</strong></p>
<p>Agniveer wrote,</p>
<p>1. This is a printing mistake. Real word is Ayohate (अयोहते). Now in Devanagri script, Ya (य) and Pa (प) appear almost similar. Such errors are found in several places in Vedas because the first time they were being printed, they were being typeset from hand-written manuscripts. However Pt Damodar Satvalekar did a great job of scrutinizing all published mantras with manuscripts and manuscripts with various Paatha methods to give to us extremely authentic editions of Rigveda.</p>
<p>2. But thankfully, the meaning does not change because that was based on actual word.</p>
<p>Come on Maharishi Agniveer. You blame every mischief of your guru on the poor printers. If it was a printing error, why did the Swami translate <strong>Apohatay</strong> and not <strong>Ayohate</strong>? He translated it as &#8216;gold&#8217; instead of the actual meaning &#8216;iron&#8217;. Who are you deceiving? The Swami Brahmachari was looking for gold instead of worthless iron. Changing 1 into 11 is the old habit of Grocers. When caught out they said, &#8220;Oh man! This is only a writing error.&#8221;</p>
<p>4. In Yajurveda Bhashya of Dayanand Ji Adhyay 39, mantra 5, the word <strong>Vishyandmaane </strong>was changed to <strong>Vishpandmaane.</strong></p>
<p>Agniveer wrote,</p>
<p>Refer previous allegation.</p>
<p>How can you refer it to previous point, when this is a separate fraud? The swami has translated <strong>Vispand</strong> and not <strong>Visyand</strong>. Vispand (विष्पन्द ) means throbbing and Vishyand (विष्यन्द) means trickling. Only a fool will call it a printing error. Swami has taken Visyand deliberately to mistraslate it.</p>
<p>5. The longer ending in Yajurveda 13:58 has been deleted from Arya Samaj version, but exists in the Gayatri Parivar version .</p>
<p>Agniveer wrote,</p>
<p>It does not matter whether this text is there or not. The meaning of the phrase is implied in overall meaning of the mantras continued from Chapter 12 itself up to this last mantra of Chapter 13. So for sake of completion of meaning you can put the phrase, and for sake of brevity you can skip it. A conservative approach would be to keep it. but if focus is to understand meaning alone, it can be skipped. <strong>We suggest having the phrase for sake of completeness.</strong></p>
<p>If Veda is revealed text according to you, do you mean the Words of God do not matter? Is your God a lunatic who reveals texts in vain? I told this to a Sanatan Dharmi friend. He became upset and said, &#8220;Who the hell is Agniveer to suggest what should be Vedas and what not?&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Corruption of Samaveda</strong></p>
<p>Samaveda is heavily borrowed from the Rigveda. It consists of a collection of hymns, portions of hymns, and detached verses, all but 75 taken from the Sakala Sakha of the Rigveda, the other 75 belong to the Bashkala Sakha, to be sung, using specifically indicated melodies, called Samagana. There are differences regarding the exact number of mantras in the Samaveda. As I said earlier,  according to Patanjali&#8217;s statement, &#8220;sahasravartma samvedah&#8221; सहस्रवर्त्म<br />
समवेदः, &#8220;There are thousand branches of Samaveda&#8221;. However, only three survive:</p>
<ul>
<li>the Kauthuma Shakha is current in Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Orissa and since a few decades in Darbhanga, Bihar,</li>
<li>the Jaiminiya in the Karnatak, Tamilnadu and Kerala,</li>
<li>and the Rāṇāyanīya in the Maharastra.</li>
</ul>
<p>The total mantras in the Jaimniya Shakha is 1687. Kauthama Shakha has 1869 mantras . Thus, 182 mantras are missing from Kauthama Shakha. An analysis of both these versions reveals lots of Paath-Bhed (variant readings). Besides this, there is a difference in number of songs attributed to different branches. Shri Satvalekar in his preface to Samaveda Samhita has given the following table of songs (Samagana).</p>

<p>We can easily see that the Samaganas of Jaiminiya Version are 1000 more than those of Kauthamiya Version.</p>
<p>Agniveer wrote,</p>
<p>We have already mentioned that Kauthum Rishi preserved the original Samaveda. Refer the previous discussion on branches.</p>
<p>Further, Samaveda songs make no sense for the disturbed mind. They represent the melodies that generate from within when one reaches a high level of enlightenment and exalted state. Jaimini branch offers more variety and you can experiment with them to find what melody touches you the most. However keep caution – avoid spicy food, meat, alcohol, anger, frustration, hatred etc, study other Vedas as well and practice meditation. Without foundation of this, you may be simply wasting your time.</p>
<p>When will Agniveer stop lying? What is the proof that only Kauthama Samhita is original? Whether Samaveda songs make sense or not is no response to the argument of textual corruption. Samaveda is a mere waste of ink and paper. All except 75 mantras are copied from Rigveda&#8217;s Shaakal samhita. The remaining are from Baashkal. Now, if Baashkal is not the original Samhita, then the 75 mantras of Samaveda are also fake.</p>
<p><strong>Corruption in Atharvaveda</strong></p>
<p>Atharvaveda, also known as Brahmaveda is considered the youngest amongst all other Vedas.</p>
<p>Following is an exmaple of textual corruption in the Atharvaveda.</p>
<p>Atharvaveda Khand 20 and Sookt 127 is part of the Kuntap Sooktas. In the third mantra of this Sookt there has been  an alteration. The Atharvaveda of Arya Samaj and Gayatri Parivar both have it as follows:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="365" height="67" class="wp-image-7545" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-42.png" alt="http://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/060218_0654_testingresp10.png" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-42.png 365w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-42-300x55.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 365px) 100vw, 365px" /></p>
<p>The word preceeding <strong>Maamahe</strong> is <strong>Eeshaai</strong>. However, in the Atharvaveda of Pandit Raja Ram Shashtri of Arya Samaj as well as the Atharvaveda printed in Germany, the text differs as follows:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="317" height="56" class="wp-image-7546" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-43.png" alt="http://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/060218_0654_testingresp11.png" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-43.png 317w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-43-300x53.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 317px) 100vw, 317px" /></p>
<p>Here the word preceeding <strong>Maamahe </strong>is <strong>Rishye </strong>and not <strong>Eeshaai</strong>. This makes a difference in the meaning of the mantra.</p>
<p>Agniveer wrote,</p>
<p>Again a case of printing mistake due to bad handwriting in Devanagri manuscript or error by typist. The correct word is &#8216;Ishaya&#8217;. Printing mistakes are not attributable to original texts.</p>
<p>This is not a printing error. Prof. Whitney mentions the variation in the footnote of this word. This is a manuscript variation. That is why all European scholars such as Griffith, Whitney, Bloomfield translate it as Seer or Rishi. Agniveer would do well to learn the Vedas properly instead of blaming all  manuscript mistakes on the poor printers.</p>
<p>Points left unanswered by Agniveer</p>
<p>Patanjali Rishi, in his Mahabhasya, has given the first words of all the four Vedas. Patanjali quotes SHANNODEVEE RABHISHTAYE as the first verse of the Atharvaveda. However, Atharvaveda now begins with the verse YE NNISHATPAAH PARIYANTA. SHANNODEVEE RABHISHTAYE now appears as the first verse of the 6th Sukta of the first Kanda or in aggregate the 26th verse. This shows that  25 mantras have been interpolated in the beginning of Atharvaveda.</p>
<p>It is mentioned in Shatapath Brahman 13:4:3:4-8 in the context of the Ashvamedha sacrifice; after the Yagya (ritual) is completed, the householders should be instructed in Rigveda of the first day. old men should be instructed in Yajurveda on the second day, handsome youths should be instructed in Atharvaveda on the third day and handsome maiden should be instructed in Angirasveda on the  fourth day. Angirasveda is attributed to Rishi Angiras who is in the fourth generation after Rishi Atharva. There is no mention of Samaveda in this reference of Shatapath Brahman.</p>
<p>Agniveer wrote,</p>
<p>I shall not comment on what exactly this reference from Shatpath means. But even if we take it at face value:</p>
<p>1. Samaveda is not mentioned because Samaveda cannot be simply listened like other Vedas. Samaveda is all about emotions and meditation. <strong>Further, bulk of mantras in Samaveda are already in Rigveda. So there is no purpose of listening them again. </strong>However if the same mantras are meditated upon with emotions and sung, new revelations would come. But this is not in context of the ritual described. You need to separately practice this art.</p>
<p>Yes, how can you comment because your knowledge of Vedas has taken a big beating by now.</p>
<p>Agniveer is right that bulk of the mantras in Samaveda are already in Rigveda. Agniveer himself confessed that Samaveda is useless and mere waste of paper, ink and time, because it is mere repetition of Rigveda.</p>
<p>Agniveer wrote,</p>
<p>2. Even if Rishi Angiras was born 4th generation from Rishi Atharva (I shall not comment on authenticity of this history), how does it matter? Names of Rishis depict their deeds and specializations and not the names in their Class X pass certificate. So a specialist in Atharvaveda can name himself Rishi Atharva. Similarly another Rishi can use synonym of Atharva ie Angiras and use as his name. This is similar to we using Agniveer as our name. Now just because we call ourselves Agniveer, it does not mean that we are the author of all the mantras in Vedas that have word &#8216;Agni&#8217;.</p>
<p>Agniveer cannot comment on the authenticity of this history because he doesn&#8217;t know any history. There are no preserved records of the imaginary authors of the Vedas. The point to be noted is that it is technically absurd to call the same Veda by different names in the same sentence, just because the gender is different. Rest of the claims of Agniveer are without any evidence.</p>
<p>Agniveer wrote,</p>
<p>4. Atharvaveda and Angirasveda refer to same text. They are also called Chhanda in some places. Atharvaveda has the privilege of multiple names because it is an all-rounder. It adopts from Rik, Yajuh and Sama Vedas are brings forth their applied aspects. To there are multiple dimensions to it deserving multiple names.</p>
<p>The correct view is that Atharvaveda is divided into two parts, Atharvaved and Angirasved. Atharvaved as a whole is a later addition to the canon of Vedas, interpolated by Brahmins. Even within Atharvaved, Angirasved portion is a late addition. Agniveer has produced no evidence for the multiple names of Atharvaved.</p>
<p>Agniveer wrote,</p>
<p>But if this be the argument for Vedas being corrupted then Quran is perhaps the most corrupted text in the world. Because Quran is referred by a huge number of names in Quran itself. The word Quran was later adopted for the text by fighting followers long after death of the peace-loving founder. The founder never knew that this book would be called Quran. Quran is also referred by names reserved for Jewish and Christian texts in Quran itself! That is why some scholars conclude that original Quran refers to Bible or Old Testament or some unchangeable text which was existing ever prior to Testaments and was much bigger in size. This a matter of scholarly debate and we shall leave it to scholars.</p>
<p>Exactly, the Quran has many names WITHIN the text itself. There was no fighting between the companions over the names. Agniveer is just throwing red herrings to distract the attention of the readers from the main topic. Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) always referred to it as Al-Quran (The Quran). Agniveer neither has knowledge of Vedic Dharma nor of Islam. His credibility is already destroyed. Commenting on the comments of the ignorant does not fetch anything. The topic is about Vedas so bringing the Quran into the picture is evidence that Agniveer has really no factual response to the clear textual corruption of Vedas. Our research has been substantial, reasonable and rational.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Agniveer has problems with my usage of the word &#8216;accusation&#8217;. I already know, after thorough study, that Vedas are false and corrupt. Hence I am justified in using the word &#8216;accusation&#8217;. &#8216;To accuse&#8217; according to dictionary means &#8216;to charge with a shortcoming or error.&#8217; Check <a href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/accuse" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">this link<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> to know more.</p>
<p>All Maharishi Agniveer can do is go into hairsplitting a simple word and build more castles of lies and deception. You can think why Agniveer is so upset here. Obviously because the foundations of Vedic Dharma are being shaken here.</p>
<p>Agniveer writes more lies,</p>
<p>4. To take this argument to an extreme, let us state something. Even if all the allegations…sorry &#8216;<strong>accusations</strong>&#8216; stand, still that would NO WAY AFFECT the Vedic religion. This is because the very essence of Vedic religion is to <strong>not</strong> blindly and literally translate any text as recipe for life.</p>
<p>To know about the truth of Vedic Religion, go through our disection of Vedas on our website. You  will know the reality with references and exact quotes.</p>
<p>Agniveer wrote,</p>
<p>Vedic texts are like Science textbooks for us and not a roadside Mantra-Tantra book that promises to help us getting job, marriage, money, destruction of enemy, mesmerism over lover, invisibility, control of Jinna and ghosts etc by blankly reciting certain mantras on microphone and moving some bones.</p>
<p>Sorry, if you think Vedas are akin to Jhaad Phoonk of Pagla Baba Banarasi, or Ajmer Sharif ka Jaadu, or Shahdara Wale Miyanji ke Totke or something similar, you are at a wrong place. Get these addresses from any Railway Station rather than daring to open the minds to think honestly. Or perhaps your own scripture might be a good replacement for these Babas and Miyans.</p>
<p>All you have to do is read the Vedas yourself and see the kind of primitive, superstitous book it is. Let me give you a sample of Mantra-Tantra and Jhaad Phoonk.</p>
<p>6. The mother shall sleep, the father shall sleep, the dog shall sleep, the lord of the house shall sleep! All her relations shall sleep, and these people round about shall sleep!<br />
7. O sleep, put thou to sleep all people with the magic that induces sleep! Put the others to sleep until the sun rises; may I be awake until the dawn appears, like Indra, unharmed, uninjured!</p>
<p>(Atharvaved 4:5:6-7)</p>
<p>These mantras in Atharvaveda are taught to the Robber. It is claimed that by chanting these mantras, all the family members of the house, which the robber intends to rob, will sleep so that the robber can  easily rob the house. Now, it is for you to decide what kind of knowledge is this? Obviuosly knowledge of fraud or in short fraud-veda.</p>

<p>P.S. Since this is a response article, we had to restrict it to the arguments presented. However, to prove the textual corruption of Vedas, one more article will be added soon with many more proofs and evidences. Stay tuned and thanks for reading! Beware of Fraud Maharishis.</p>

<p>जब भी हिंदू धर्म में व्याप्त जाति व्यवस्था पर वार्तालाप की जाती है प्राय: जाति परिवर्तन के अनेकों उधारण दिये जाते हैं और ये संदेश दिया जाता है कि जाति बदली जा सकती है। हम अपने इस लेख और आने वालें लेखों में कुछ ऐसे ही उधारणों पर चर्चा करेंगे।</p>
<p><span id="more-5639"></span></p>
<p><strong>मातंग</strong> <strong>चांडालपुत्र</strong> <strong>से</strong> <strong>ब्राह्मण</strong> <strong>बने</strong><strong> ?</strong></p>
<p>मतंग (ना की मातंग) ऋषि की कथा विस्तार से महाभारत के अनुशासन पर्व (अध्याय 27 से 29) में आती है। उसमे आता है कि मतंग ऋषि एक ब्राह्मणी के पेट से शूद्रजातीय नाई द्वारा पैदा किए गए एक चांडाल है (अनुशासन पर्व अध्याय 27 श्लोक 17)। शूद्र वर्ण में जन्मे मतंग ऋषि घोर तप करते हैं। उनकी तपस्या से प्रसन्न हो कर इन्द्र उनके पास कई बार आते है और वर मांगने के लिए कहते है। मतंग वर मांगते है कि “मैं ब्राह्मण बन जाऊं । इस पर इंद्र बार-बार इसे छोड़ कर कोई अन्य वर मांगने के लिए कहते हैं।</p>
<p>इन्द्र का कहना है कि:</p>
<p><strong>चण्डालयोनौ</strong> <strong>जातेन</strong> <strong>नावाप्यं</strong> <strong>वै</strong> <strong>कथंचन</strong><strong>     –  </strong><strong>महाभारत</strong> <strong>अनुशासन</strong> <strong>पर्व</strong> <strong>अध्याय</strong><strong> 29 </strong><strong>श्लोक</strong><strong> 4</strong></p>
<p><em>चाण्डाल</em> <em>की</em> <em>योनि</em> <em>में</em> <em>जन्म</em> <em>लेने</em> <em>वाले</em> <em>को</em> <em>किसी</em> <em>तरह</em> <em>भी</em> <em>ब्राह्मणत्व</em> <em>नहीं</em> <em>मिल</em> <em>सकता।</em></p>
<p>मतंग ब्राह्मणत्वं ते विरुद्धमिह दृश्यते । ब्राह्मणयं दुर्लभतरं    – महाभारत अनुशासन पर्व अध्याय 29 श्लोक 8</p>
<p><em>मतंग</em> <em>इस</em> <em>जन्म</em> <em>में</em> <em>तुम्हारे</em> <em>लिए</em> <em>ब्राह्मणत्व</em> <em>की</em> <em>प्राप्ति</em> <em>असंभव</em> <em>दिखायी</em> <em>देती</em> <em>है।</em> <em>ब्राह्मणत्व</em> <em>अत्यंत</em> <em>दुर्लभ</em> <em>है।</em></p>
<p>लेकिन मतंग नहीं मानते। इन्द्र चले जाते हैं। ऐसा कई बार होता है। अंतिम बार इंद्र आते हैं। मतंग पहले सा आग्रह नहीं करते वह अन्य वर मांगते हैं। वह कहते हैं-</p>
<p><strong>यथा</strong> <strong>कामविहारी</strong> <strong>स्यां</strong> <strong>कामरूपी</strong> <strong>विहड्नमः</strong> <strong>।ब्रह्मक्षत्राविरोधेन</strong> <strong>पूजां</strong> <strong>च</strong> <strong>प्राप्नुयामहम्</strong> <strong>॥</strong></p>
<p><strong>यथा</strong> <strong>ममाक्षया</strong> <strong>किर्तिर्भवेच्चापि</strong> <strong>पुरंदर</strong> <strong>।कर्तुमर्हसि</strong> <strong>तद्</strong> <strong>देव</strong> <strong>शीरसा</strong> <strong>त्वां</strong> <strong>प्रसादये</strong><strong>  </strong><strong>॥</strong><strong>         – </strong><strong>महाभारत</strong> <strong>अनुशासन</strong> <strong>पर्व</strong> <strong>अ०</strong><strong> 29 </strong><strong>श०</strong><strong> 22-23</strong></p>
<p><em>देव</em> <em>पुरंदर</em> <em>आप</em> <em>ऐसी</em> <em>कृपा</em> <em>करें</em><em>, </em><em>जिससे</em> <em>मैं</em> <em>इच्छानुसार</em> <em>विचरनेवाला</em> <em>तथा</em> <em>अपनी</em> <em>इच्छा</em> <em>के</em> <em>अनुसार</em> <em>रूपधारण</em> <em>करने</em> <em>वाला</em> <em>आकाशचारी</em> <em>देवता</em> <em>होऊँ</em> <em>।</em> <em>ब्राह्मण</em> <em>और</em> <em>क्षत्रियों</em> <em>के</em> <em>विरोध</em> <em>से</em> <em>रहित</em> <em>हो</em> <em>मैं</em> <em>सर्वत्र</em> <em>पूजा</em> <em>एवं</em> <em>सत्कार</em> <em>प्राप्त</em> <em>करूँ</em> <em>तथा</em> <em>मेरी</em> <em>अक्षय</em> <em>किर्ति</em> <em>का</em> <em>विस्तार</em> <em>हो।</em> <em>मैं</em> <em>आपके</em> <em>चरणों</em> <em>में</em> <em>मस्तक</em> <em>रख</em> <em>कर</em> <em>आपकी</em> <em>प्रसन्नता</em> <em>चाहता</em> <em>हूँ।</em> <em>आप</em> <em>मेरी</em> <em>इस</em> <em>प्राथना</em> <em>को</em> <em>सफल</em> <em>बनाइये</em> <em>।।</em></p>
<p>इंद्र वर देते हुए कहते हैं-</p>
<p><strong>छंदोदेव</strong> <strong>इति</strong> <strong>ख्यातः</strong> <strong>स्त्रीणां</strong> <strong>पुज्यो</strong> <strong>भविष्यसि</strong> <strong>।किर्तिश्र्च</strong> <strong>ते</strong> <strong>तुला</strong> <strong>वत्स</strong> <strong>त्रिषु</strong> <strong>लोकेषु</strong> <strong>यास्यति॥महाभारत</strong> <strong>अनुशासन</strong> <strong>पर्व</strong> <strong>अ०</strong><strong> 29 </strong><strong>श०</strong><strong> 24</strong></p>
<p><em>इंद्र</em><em>  </em><em>ने</em> <em>कहा</em><em> –</em><em>वत्स</em><em> ! </em><em>तुम</em> <em>स्त्रियों</em> <em>के</em> <em>पूजनीय</em> <em>होओगे।</em> <em>छंदोदेव</em> <em>के</em> <em>नाम</em> <em>से</em> <em>तुम्हारी</em> <em>ख्याति</em> <em>होगी</em> <em>और</em> <em>तीनों</em> <em>लोकों</em> <em>में</em> <em>तुम्हारी</em> <em>अनुपम</em> <em>किर्ति</em> <em>का</em> <em>विस्तार</em> <em>होगा</em><em>  </em><em>।।</em></p>
<p>स्पष्ट है की मतंग चांडाल से ब्राह्मण नहीं बना ।इसी बात को 29 वे अध्याय के 26 वें श्लोक में दोहराया गया है-</p>
<p><strong>एवमेतत्</strong> <strong>परं</strong> <strong>स्थानं</strong> <strong>ब्राह्मण्यं</strong> <strong>नाम</strong> <strong>भारत</strong> <strong>।</strong><strong> </strong><strong>तच्च</strong> <strong>दुष्प्रापमिह</strong> <strong>वै</strong> <strong>महेंद्रवचनं</strong> <strong>यथा</strong><strong>   </strong><strong>॥</strong><strong>     </strong><strong>महाभारत</strong> <strong>अनुशासन</strong> <strong>पर्व</strong><strong>   29 </strong><strong>अ०</strong> <strong>श०</strong><strong> 26</strong></p>
<p><em>भारत</em><em> ! </em><em>इस</em> <em>तरह</em> <em>यह</em> <em>ब्राह्मणत्व</em> <em>परम</em> <em>उत्तम</em> <em>स्थान</em> <em>है।</em> <em>जैसा</em> <em>की</em> <em>इंद्र</em> <em>का</em> <em>कथन</em> <em>है</em><em>, </em><em>यह</em> <em>इस</em> <em>जीवन</em> <em>में</em> <em>दूसरे</em> <em>वर्ण</em> <em>के</em> <em>लोगों</em> <em>के</em> <em>लिए</em> <em>दुर्लभ</em> <em>है।</em></p>
<p>आर्यसमाजियों की धोकेभाज़ी- मूल मंत्र में हेराफेरी</p>
<p>इतनी स्पष्ट मतंगकथा के होते हुए भी किस तरह लोग भ्रांति में पड़ते हैं। इस का कारण स्वामी दयानंद जी का सत्यार्थ प्रकाश है, जिस में लिखा है-“ महाभारत में……मातंग ऋषि चांडाल कुल से ब्राह्मण हो गए थे।” (चतुर्थ समुल्लास)। इस बात को पुष्ट करने के लिए सत्यार्थप्रकाश के आर्यसमाज शताब्दी संस्करण (रामलाल कपूर ट्रस्ट प्रकाशन) के पृष्ठ 141 पर पादटिप्पणी में संपादकों ने महाभारत ,अनुशासन पर्व (3/19) का एक श्लोक,बिना अर्थ लिखे ,अंकित कर दिया है-</p>
<p>स्थाने मातंगो ब्राह्मण्यमलभद् भरतर्षभ,</p>
<p>चण्डालयोनौ जातो हि कथं ब्राह्मण्यमवाप्तवान्</p>
<p>कुछ ऐसा हि प्रयास सत्यार्थप्रकाश मानक संस्करण( श्रीमद् दयानंद सत्यार्थ प्रकाश न्यास ) द्वारा किया गया। इस संस्करण में विशेष टिप्पणी भाग पृष्ठ 27 में मतंग ऋषि के प्रकरण पर यह टिप्पणी बिना अर्थ के की गयी है-</p>
<p>स्थाने मतंगो ब्राह्मण्यमलभद् भरतर्षभ,</p>
<p>चण्डालयोनौ जातो हि कथं ब्राह्मण्यमवाप्तवान्             -महा,अनु (3/19)</p>
<p>इसी पथ पर चलते हुए कुछ वीरों ने (या कहिए झूठो ने) भी वीरता (पढ़िये कायरता) दिखाने की कोशिश की है:</p>
<p id="mczlQyS"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="605" height="155" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7665 " src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/img_5f257ab41a7c0.png" alt="" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/img_5f257ab41a7c0.png 605w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/img_5f257ab41a7c0-300x77.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 605px) 100vw, 605px" /></p>
[Note: The url is erased without the permission of the writer Neer Mohammed by the admin of VedKaBhed]
<p>इस श्लोक में आर्यसमाजियों ने हेराफेरी की है। मूल में “न” शब्द था, जो पादटिप्पणी में गायब है। अर्थ वैसे ही नहीं लिखा था। आर्यसमाजियों की बोधिक ईमानदारी का अंदाजा पाठक स्वयं लगा सकते हैं। अब यह जिज्ञासा बनी रहती है कि वास्तव में इस श्लोक का क्या अर्थ है। प्रकरण विश्वामित्र का चल रहा है। अध्याय के अंत में युधिष्ठिर का प्रश्नात्मक कथन है</p>
<p>स्थाने मतंगो ब्राह्मण्यं नालभद् भरतर्षभ,</p>
<p>चण्डालयोनौ जातो हि कथं ब्राह्मण्यमवाप्तवान्             -महा,अनु (3/19)</p>
<p>प्रमाण</p>
<p>1.गीता प्रैस गोरखपुर महाभारत हिन्दी अनुवाद सहित पृ. 5439</p>
<p id="hBeZOmF"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="626" height="147" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7666 " src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/img_5f257ac4690bf.png" alt="" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/img_5f257ac4690bf.png 626w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/img_5f257ac4690bf-300x70.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 626px) 100vw, 626px" /></p>
<p>इस का अर्थ प्रकरण में इस तरह आता है: भरतश्रेष्ठ, मतंग को जो ब्राह्मणत्व नहीं प्राप्त हुआ,यह उचित ही था,क्योंकि उस का जन्म चांडाल की योनि में हुआ था,परंतु विश्वामित्र ने कैसे ब्राह्मणत्व प्राप्त कर लिया ?</p>
<p>स्वामी दयानंद का कथन महाभारत के उपरोक्त विवरण के बिलकुल विपरीत होने के कारण निराधार और कपोलकल्पित है। यहा स्पष्ट है की मतंग ब्राह्मण नहीं बनते, इस श्लोक में विश्वामित्र जी का भी उल्लेख किया गया है। इसकी यथार्थता हम इस श्रंखला के अगले लेख में देखेंगे।</p>

<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">This section deals with the Concept of God <em>(or Concept of <span style="color:black;"><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">God<span style="color:red;">s</span></span> – </strong></span>later we&#8217;ll make things more evident)</em> in Protestant Hinduism<em>(so-called Ārya Samāj)</em>, the concept of God in Protestant Hinduism is grossly and totally incoherent. In fact it&#8217;s also doubted whether this could be called as concept of <strong>&#8220;God&#8221;</strong> or not. It seems, the very definition of God was not fathomed by Moolshankar. The conception of God in Protestant Hinduism itself is sufficient to prove the false nature of this cult. It&#8217;s quite amazing to see how Moolshankar describes his god <em>(Ishwar)</em>, he extensively stresses on his gods omnipresence, omnipotence, omniscience, formlessness and shapelessness. Nowadays we see fanatical zealots, hate-monger&#8217;s like Agniveer, propagating his works, <strong>as these <em>(Mahendra Pāl, Agniveer -now claims to be a &#8216;Movement&#8217;)</em> being a blind-followers of Moolshankar like other protestant Hindus. Here we&#8217;ll try to demystify the concept of God in Protestant Hinduism and show how rational and coherent it is.</strong><br />
</span><br />
<span id="more-1651"></span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">The protestant Hindus propagandise, their cult to be <strong>&#8220;Monotheistic&#8221;</strong> in nature and claim their scriptures teach worship of One God exclusively, this is what people are usually informed by the protagonists, but the reality of their belief will be evident in the following passages.Vedas only teach polytheism not monotheism.<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">We read, Moolshankar <em>(Dayānanda Saraswati)</em>writing in his book <em>(Satyarth Prakāsh)</em>, that the Vedas strictly preach and teach Monotheism and this was his belief <em>[delusion]</em> too. In fact the translator Durgā Prasād writes in the book <em>(Satyarth Prakāsh&#8217;s translation, pg. 60)</em> that<span style="color:red;"><strong> &#8220;Satyarth Prakash – an exposition of the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">monotheism</span> and civilization of the ancient Aryans.&#8221; </strong></span>It seems that his <em>(Moolshankar&#8217;s)</em> blind -followers truly believe that this book <em>(Satyarth Prakāsh)</em> deals with monotheism, nonetheless this so-called monotheism of protestant Hinduism will be scrutinized to truth.<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><strong>a.1) Is<span style="text-decoration:underline;"> Ishwar the Creator</span>?</strong><br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">Protestant Hindus go around talking of so-called one god <strong>&#8220;Ishwar&#8221;</strong> who is the creator.  But what they really mean by the <em>&#8220;Creator&#8221;</em>? Let&#8217;s see.<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">First, Moolshankar wrote that God is the creator of all, then contradicts himself, by stating that Paramātmā <em>[God],</em> Ātmā <em>[Human Souls]</em> and Prakriti <em>[Primordial matter],</em> are beginning-less and uncreated! So how come God is <em>(Ishwar)</em> <strong>&#8220;creator of all&#8221;</strong>? We shall probe into this case, and expose some amazingly incoherent beliefs of protestant Hindus.<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">Mooshankar wrote <em>(quotes Yajurveda 36:3)</em> –<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><strong>&#8220;…Omniscient, Sustainer and Ruler of the Universe, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Creator of all</span>, Eternal…&#8221;</strong><br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">&#8211; [Satyarth Prakash Ch. 3, pg.33 Tr. Dr.Chiranjiva Bhardawaja]
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">It wasn&#8217;t slip of pen that Moolshankar <em>(Dayānanda Saraswati)</em> wrote <strong>&#8220;Creator of all&#8221;</strong> but this has been stated in other parts of Satyarth Prakāsh too. For instance, Moolshankar quotes Rigveda &#8211;<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">&#8220;…I am the controller of the universe<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>,<span style="color:red;"> know me alone as the Creator of all</span></strong></span>…&#8221;<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">-[Satyarth Prakash Ch. 7 ,pg.205 Tr. Dr.Chiranjiva Bhardawaja ]
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">Similarly, stated by Moolshankar <em>(Dayānanda Saraswati)</em> on pg. 207<em>(Tr.Chiranjiva)</em>,<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">&#8220;…If He were localized to some particular place, He could never be Omniscient, Inward Regular of all, Universal Controller, <span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;"><strong><em>Creator of all</em></strong></span>, Sustainer of all and the Cause for resolution….&#8221;<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">So we read, at first Moolshankar states that &#8220;<strong>Ishwar (God) is Creator of all</strong>&#8220;and later he goes on to state that there are 3 entities which are Uncreated, Eternal, Beginning-less.<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">The three entities which are uncreated eternal, beginning-less – here Moolshakar <em>(Dayānanda Saraswati)</em>quotes <em>&#8220;SHWETA SHWATER UPNISHAD, 4: 5&#8221;</em>and states:<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;"><strong>&#8220;The prakriti, the soul and God, all of them, are uncreated.</strong></span> They are the cause of the whole universe.&#8221;<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">– [Satyarth Prakash Ch. 8, pg.244 Tr. Dr.Chiranjiva Bhardawaja]
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">As he <em>(Moolshankar)</em> states in Satyarth Prakash-<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">&#8220;How many entities are eternal or beginningless?<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><strong>   A-<span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;">Three – God, the soul, and the prakriti (matter).</span></strong>                                                                                      -[Satyarth Prakash Ch. 8 ,pg.243 Tr. Dr.Chiranjiva Bhardawaja ]
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">According to Moolshankar&#8217;s <em>(and protestant Hindu)</em> theology there are 3 <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>beginning less</strong></span>, <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">uncreated</span> </strong>,<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>immortal</strong></span> entities –<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><em>1)      </em><strong>Paramātmā</strong> <em>(Ishwar/God)</em><br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">2)      <strong>Prakriti</strong> <em>(Primordial matter)</em><br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">3)      <strong>Ātmā </strong><em>(Human Souls,note -we&#8217;ll be using plural i.e. Human Souls for clarity)</em><br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">This philosopher&#8217;s stance <em>(uncreated primordial matter)</em> adopted by Moolshankar is self-contradictory in many areas, for instance Moolshankar seem to claim in monotheistic Vedas, but this stance of co-eternal prakriti <em>(Primordial matter) </em>and Ātmā <em>(Human Souls)</em> explicitly disqualifies prostestant Hindusim from the claim of monotheism, as this undermines and infringes the absolute monotheistic nature of God and reduces Him <em>(God)</em> to an position of an artificer –a Demiurge.<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">Now, if this is the case <em>(co-eternal, uncreated Prakriti and Ātmā)</em> then, why did Moolshankar write God is the <strong>&#8220;<span style="text-decoration:underline;">creator of all</span>&#8220;</strong>? This is an explicit contradiction, which is easily noticeable. It&#8217;s understood that God is uncreated but what of <strong>&#8220;Prakriti&#8221; <em>(</em></strong><em>Primordial matter)</em> and <strong>&#8220;Ātmā&#8221;</strong> <em>(human souls)</em>? <strong>Who created them</strong><em>?[their being eternal,uncreated is not possible, rationally and logically especially for those who claim to be &#8216;monotheistic&#8217;]</em> And if God isn&#8217;t their creator – as these 2 things are uncreated <em>(as per protestant hindu belief)</em>, then why is God or in protestant Hindu terminology <em>&#8220;Ishwar&#8221;</em> <em>&#8220;Parameshawar&#8221;</em> called <strong>&#8220;Creator of all&#8221;. </strong>This is quite contradictory and absurd. In fact this is a white lie.<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:#ff9900;"><strong>Agniveer</strong></span>, the fanatic hate-monger wrote –<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><strong>Q: Who created the world? Ishwar or someone else?</strong><br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">A<span style="text-decoration:underline;">: Ishwar created the world in same manner as an engineer creates a machine. He is thus the<strong>&#8216;engineer&#8217;</strong> of the world. But like engineer, He used existing <strong>&#8216;raw material&#8217;</strong> or Nature (matter/ energy approximately) to create the world.</span><br />
</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><strong>Q: Did Ishwar not create Nature as well?</strong><br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">A<span style="text-decoration:underline;">: No, Nature or &#8216;raw material&#8217; is eternal (beginningless and endless)</span> like Ishwar. Being eternal, there is no cause for origin or destruction of Ishwar or Nature.&#8221;<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">&#8211; [Source &#8211; <a href="http://agniveer.com/2775/creation/" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="color:blue;text-decoration:underline;">http://agniveer.com/2775/creation/</span><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>]
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">We learn that Protestant Hindu God <strong>&#8216;Ishwar&#8217;</strong> is the <strong>&#8216;engineer of the world&#8217;</strong>, who uses <strong>&#8216;raw material&#8217;</strong> to create the world, this stance of protestant Hindu&#8217;s is quite fanciful, and irrational as it insults the concept of God itself in its entirety. I wonder why, don&#8217;t these protestant Hindus call Ishwar, an &#8216;engineer&#8217; when they believe so?<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">So, this incapability of Ishwar is also affirmed and stated by the hate-monger Agniveer, I wonder how a rational person <em>(assuming Agniveer is rational- I know it&#8217;s very farfetched, but let&#8217;s give him benefit of doubt and assume)</em> can accept such gibberish, incoherent theological views!<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">In fact this absurdity is also supported by Vedas &#8211;<br />
</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">&#8220;God, the Lord of final emancipation is in truth the <span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;"><strong>creator of all</strong></span> that hath been and what yet shall be; and what grows on earth.&#8221;                                                   – [Yajurveda Ch. 31, verse 2, pg. 302 Tr. Devi Chand]
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">&#8220;Worship Him, Whose beautiful sacrifice, wealth, strength, and mighty glory are enjoyed by the Heaven and Earth; <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong><span style="color:red;">Who is the creator of all</span> <span style="color:#ffcc00;">beings</span></strong></span>, the Embodiment of great happiness, All-pervading and Supplier of food.&#8221;                                      – [Yajurveda Ch. 33, verse 23, pg. 312 Tr. Devi Chand]
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">It&#8217;s to be noted that, the second verse states in an interrogative way &#8220;<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><span style="color:red;"><strong>Who is the creator of all beings…</strong></span> All-pervading</span>&#8221; Here again this statement is contradictory to the belief&#8217;s of Protestant Hindus, in order to prove this lets first define &#8220;<span style="color:#ffcc00;text-decoration:underline;"><strong>beings</strong></span>&#8220;. And<strong>&#8220;being&#8221;</strong>means &#8211;<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:#333399;"><strong>being</strong></span> <em>noun </em>[ C or U ]
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">a person or thing that exists or the state of existing<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">&#8211; [Cambridge Advanced Learner&#8217;s Dictionary CD- ROM, 3rd Edition, © Cambridge University Press 2008]
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">So <strong>&#8216;being&#8217;</strong> means – <span style="text-decoration:underline;">a person or thing that exists or the state of existing</span>. So we ask doesn&#8217;t <strong>&#8216;Prakriti&#8217;</strong> <em>(Primordial Matter) </em>exist? Doesn&#8217;t <strong>&#8216;Ātmā&#8217;</strong> <em>(Human Souls)</em> exist? Yes of course they do, as stated by Moolshankar. Then how can &#8216;Ishwar&#8217; be the <strong><em>&#8216;creator of all beings&#8217;</em></strong> when Prakriti and Ātmā are uncreated? Then is &#8216;Ishwar&#8217; creator of them? No, as stated by Moolshankar, then why is it stated in the above quoted verse of Yajurveda that the <em>&#8220;All-prevading&#8221;</em> <em>(i.e Ishwar)</em> is the <em>&#8220;Creator of all beings&#8221;? </em>This is nothing but pure contradiction which is repeated in many of the Vedic verses.Later, in the article we&#8217;ll see that Ishwar is not the creator of &#8216;time&#8217;…etc<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">Questions which mavericks like us would like to ask –<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">a) How can &#8216;Ishwar&#8217; be <strong>&#8216;creator of all&#8217; <em>(or &#8216;<span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;">creator of all <span style="color:#ffcc00;">beings</span>&#8216;)</span></em></strong> as claimed by protestant Hindus when, they themselves believe<em>(state)</em> in uncreated-ness of &#8216;Prakriti&#8217; and &#8216;Ātmā&#8217;?<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">b) Who created <strong><em>&#8216;prakriti&#8217;</em></strong>, if <strong><em>&#8216;Ishwar&#8217;</em></strong> – the Protestant Hindu God, didn&#8217;t? <em>[Rationally it&#8217;s impossible to prove uncreated-ness of<strong>Prakriti</strong> , especially when those claiming this are also claiming to be Monotheistic.]</em><br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">c) Who created <strong><em>&#8216;Ātmā&#8217;</em></strong>, if <strong><em>&#8216;Ishwar&#8217;</em></strong> – the Protestant Hindu God, didn&#8217;t?<em> [Rationally it&#8217;s impossible to prove uncreated-ness of <strong>Ātmā</strong>, especially when those claiming this are also claiming to be Monotheistic.]</em><br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">This ameliorates exposure of the reality of protestant Hindu theology in the eyes of Truth-Seeker&#8217;s. Now coming to some amazing facts, which will really expose the distortions <em>(of meanings)</em> from the protestant Hindu cult.<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">Moolshankar wrote in Satyarth Prakāsh Ch.1 pg. 5 <em>(quoting Kaivalya Upanishad)</em> –<br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">&#8220;He is called Brahma – the Creator of the Universe…&#8221;<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">And, in the footnotes the translator Dr. Chiranjiva comments&#8221;<span style="color:blue;">The word <span style="color:red;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Creator</span><span style="color:blue;"> used in the <span style="color:red;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>sense of Maker</strong></span><span style="color:blue;"> as according to Vedic Philosophy there is <span style="color:red;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">no such thing as creation or the evolution of something out of nothing</span><span style="color:blue;">.</span>&#8220;</span><br />
</span></span></span></span></span></span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">Also we find <span style="color:#ffcc00;"><strong>Agniveer</strong></span> the Hate-Monger, Islāmophobe confessing and admitting the fact that –<br />
</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>&#8220;GOD NEVER CREATED US.</strong></span><br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">And because God never created us, He also never destroys us. <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Creation and destruction of soul is NOT the scope of work of God</strong></span>. Thus, just as God is beginningless and endless, so are we. We have existed along with God always and shall continue to do so.&#8221;<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">– [Source &#8211; <a href="http://agniveer.com/1985/why-did-god-create-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right"><span style="color:blue;text-decoration:underline;">http://agniveer.com/1985/why-did-god-create-us/</span><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>]
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">Now astonishingly, we learn, that in the so-called <em>&#8220;Vedic Philosophy&#8221;</em> there&#8217;s nothing like <strong><em>&#8220;Creation out of nothing&#8221; </em></strong>and that the word<strong><em> &#8220;Creator&#8221; </em></strong>is used in <strong><em>&#8220;Sense of Maker&#8221;. </em></strong>One would be tempted to question, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Why not simply use the word <strong>&#8216;Maker&#8217;</strong> why use the word <strong>&#8216;Creator&#8217;</strong>?</span> The answer to it is simple, to <span style="text-decoration:underline;">fool people</span> and blind-followers <em>(protestant Hindus)</em>.As how can one believe in a &#8216;God&#8217; who is not the Creator but just the <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Maker or Fashioner</strong></span> of it.<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">So we are left with the philosophical excreta of philosopher&#8217;s brains</span> that&#8217;s &#8220;<span style="color:blue;">there is no such thing as creation or the evolution of something out of nothing.</span>&#8221;<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">And we also see how the hate-monger Agniveer tries to get his incoherent, unintelligible belief, explained with few nonsensical words like &#8220;<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Creation and destruction of soul is NOT the scope of work of God&#8221;</strong></span>, we wonder <em>&#8216;What&#8217;s the Scope of God&#8217;</em>? Does scope even apply on GOD?Is God something like created beings that <em>&#8216;Scope&#8217;</em> applies to him, or is Agniveer trying to anthropomorphise God and apply Human-related characteristics/attributes to Him? By the way, is God<em>(according to Agniveer)</em>some sought of professional , for instance an Accountant , who&#8217;s been asked to handle Software engineers post , and cries out saying <em>&#8220;It&#8217;s out of my scope of work!!&#8221;</em> It&#8217;s pretty disgusting to see people insulting God by using such vernacular<em> (like &#8220;<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Creation and destruction of soul is NOT the scope of work of God&#8221;</strong></span>)</em>. We do not think that such a statement needs a refutation <em>(still we shall expose such irrationalities for those people seeking truth)</em>; such obscurely illogical statement arises out of pure ignorance of monotheism and pure blind following <em>(as in case of Agniveer).</em> We will be dealing with the reasons and causes of such irrational statement in our next subsection, wherein those reasons and causes shall be refuted and debunked.<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">It will be worthwhile and of immense benefit to state one verse from the Holy, Noble Qur&#8217;ān wherein Allāh Azz wa Jall <em>(the alone worthy of worship, One true Almighty God)</em> says which means –<br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">        &#8220;<span style="color:#666699;"><strong>Do they attribute as partners to Allāh those <span style="text-decoration:underline;">who created nothing</span></strong></span>&#8221;                                                                                                    – [Surah al-A&#8217;raaf, Ayat 191]
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">So true! See the misery and state of these Protestant Hindus, how they worship those who create not! These poor protestant Hindus set up partners <em>(by worshipping Ishwar who creates nothing) </em>with Allāh who alone is the true Almighty God, the creator of Al -&#8216;Alamîn <em>[Total Creation]</em>. We would ask our reader&#8217;s and especially the truth seeker&#8217;s to see<em>[and learn a lesson, so that you may not fall into the same dark pit]</em> how these protestant Hindus have wronged themselves by worshipping false God , who is unable to create anything.<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">For now we&#8217;ll leave the reader&#8217;s and truth-seeker&#8217;s with this verse and let them ponder upon it and contemplate whether they are on truth or falsehood, now coming back &#8211;<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">So this only proves that <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Ishwar <em>(Protestant Hindu God) </em>is <span style="color:red;">Incapable</span></strong></span> of –<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">1)      Creating Prakriti <em>(Primordial Matter)</em> and Ātmā <em>(Human Souls).</em><br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">2)      Destroying, Annihilating Prakriti and Ātmā.<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">This sufficiently proves that <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Incapability</strong></span> is an attribute <em>(characteristic)</em> of <em>&#8216;Ishwar&#8217;</em>. This also proves that &#8216;Ishwar&#8217; isn&#8217;t omnipotent or All-Powerful. But Moolshankar seems to state something opposite to it, he states <em>(quoting Rigveda)</em> –<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">&#8220;…Mayest thou (Vishnu) O Omnipresent and (Urukrama) <span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Omnipotent Being</strong></span>, shower Thy blessings all around us…&#8221;                                                                                                                               -[Satyarth Prakash Ch. 1,pg.2 Tr. Dr.Chiranjiva Bhardawaja ]
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">So what does <strong>&#8220;Omnipotence&#8221;</strong> mean? Let&#8217;s have it defined –<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:blue;"><strong>Omnipotent       </strong></span> <em>adjective </em>formal<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">having unlimited power; able to do anything<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">&#8211; [Cambridge Advanced Learner&#8217;s Dictionary CD- ROM, 3rd Edition, © Cambridge University Press 2008]
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">All the words, like Omnipotent, All-Powerful, creator are just empty words used by Moolshankar &amp; Co. for deluding people and poor blind-followers of his<em> (Moolshankar).</em> As we read earlier that , if Ishwar isn&#8217;t able to create <strong>&#8220;Prakriti&#8221;</strong> and <strong>&#8220;Ātmā&#8221;</strong> then this inability of creating things renders him free of the title &#8220;Creator&#8221; and  also this raises questions on Ishwar&#8217;s <strong>&#8220;Omnipotence&#8221;. </strong>These questions will be dealt, in the later part of the section, for now let&#8217;s see whether Moolshankar , believed in &#8220;Omnipotence&#8221; of &#8220;Ishwar&#8221;?<em>(We&#8217;ve seen a quote above , now let&#8217;s see his belief in detail).</em><br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">Moolshankar was and ardent believer of &#8220;Ishwar&#8217;s&#8221; Omnipotence <em>(at least he made it seem so)</em>, we read in various places in Satyarth Prakāsh, where he claims God to be Omnipotent, All-Powerful.<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">&#8220;Vayu: the <span style="color:red;">Omnipotent</span><br />
<span style="color:red;">Being</span>,&#8221;                                                                                                                                  – (Satyrath Prakash Ch 1, pg.71 Tr. Durga Prasad)<br />
</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">&#8220;The verse means: May (bhavatu) the Infinite Spirit<span style="color:red;"><strong> (Parmatma) who is Omnipotent</strong></span>&#8221;                                                                                                                                                                – (Satyrath Prakash Ch 1, pg.77 Tr. Durga Prasad)<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">&#8220;O Lord Thou Who art the Protector of the universe and the Veda, and art <span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Omnipotent</strong></span>, Omnipresent…&#8221;<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">-(Satyarth Prakash Ch. 10,pg.368 Tr. Dr.Chiranjiva Bhardawaja )<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">Hence, we learn that Moolshankar did believe in Omnipotence of his Ishwar, but was this Omnipotence true? Or what did Moolshankar mean by Omnipotence? As stated earlier &#8220;<em>Omnipotence</em>&#8220;, &#8220;<em>All-Powerful</em>&#8221; et al. are just empty words for Moolshankar, this will be evident below. In fact, Moolshankar goes on to <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>distort</strong></span> the meanings of words like &#8220;All-Powerful&#8221; and &#8220;Omnipotence&#8221; to fit his beliefs, for instance &#8220;<em>Omnipotence</em>&#8221; according to him does not mean <strong>&#8220;having unlimited power; able to do anything&#8221;</strong>.<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:#ffcc00;"><strong>Agniveer</strong></span> the fanatical Protestant Hindu-extremist, hate-monger also affirms and believes in the so-called All-Powerful Ishwar, he wrote –<br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">&#8220;Finally, Yajurveda 40.8 lists the properties of Ishwar as follows:<br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">Paryagat – Omnipresent,<br />
<span style="color:red;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Shukram – All-powerful</strong></span>,</span>&#8221;<br />

</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">Elsewhere too, with vigor same is stated by this mere hate- monger –<br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">&#8220;But Vedic <span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Ishwar is truly all-Powerful</strong></span>…&#8221;<br />

</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">But according to him <em>(Moolshankar)</em> it&#8217;s <em>(omnipotence&#8217;s meaning)</em> something different, this is what he answered when a questioned, regarding Ishwar&#8217;s inability of creating &#8220;prakriti&#8221;.<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><strong>Q – God being Omnipotent, He can also create prakriti – the primordial matter – and the soul. If He cannot, He cannot be called Omnipotent.</strong><br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><strong>A.</strong> – <span style="color:red;"><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">We have explained the meaning of the word Omnipotent before</span>.</strong></span> But does Omnipotent mean one who can work even the impossibilities. If there be one who can do even such impossible things as the production of an effect without a cause, then can He make another God, Himself die, suffer pain, become dead and inert, inanimate, unjust, impure and immoral or not? Even God cannot change the natural properties of things as heat of the fire, Fluidity of liquids and inertness of earth, etc. His laws being true and perfect, He cannot alter them.<strong><em><span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;">Omnipotence, therefore, only means that He possesses the power of doing all His works without any help</span>.                                        </em></strong>-[Satyarth Prakash Ch. 8, pg.251 Tr. Dr.Chiranjiva Bhardawaja ]
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">Primarily, it&#8217;s to be noted that Moolshankar states he has explained the meaning of word Omnipotence, earlier in the book, on which we&#8217;ll expound soon. Secondarily, we learn that according to Moolshankar omnipotence isn&#8217;t the ability to do anything but only means &#8220;<em><span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;"><strong>the power of doing all His works without any help</strong></span><strong>.&#8221;</strong>(This is moolshankar&#8217;s proposed definition). <strong>We see Moolshankar, distorting the meaning of Omnipotence in order to hide the fact that Ishawar isn&#8217;t omnipotent or All-Powerful and this factuality is impossible to grasp for any believer (theist) in God, hence in order to delude people and his own self <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Moolshankar indulges in namely two things – Distortion of meaning and Sophistry.</span></strong></em><br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><strong>a.2) Is Ishwar Omnipotent (All-Powerful) and what does Omnipotence mean to protestant Hinduism?</strong><br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">Now coming to the <em>&#8220;explanation&#8221; </em>of the meaning of Omnipotence by Moolshankar, which he stated to have explained earlier, wherein he uses sophistry in order prove his beliefs, which is quite amusing<em>(hilarious)</em> to read.<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">In order to, prove that his <em>(Moolshankar)</em> <span style="text-decoration:underline;">meaning <em>(&#8216;proposed definition&#8217;)</em> of <strong>&#8216;Omnipotence&#8217;</strong> and conception of God is correct</span>,<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Moolshankar disgustingly</span>, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">indulges in sophistry</span>. These question explain the situation to us –<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><strong>Is God All-powerful or not?</strong><br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><strong>A.</strong> – <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Yes, He is, but what you understand by the word All- powerful is not right</strong></span>. It really means that God does not require the least assistance from any person in all His works such as Creation, Sustenance and Dissolution of the Universe, and administration of Divine Justice. In other words, He does all His works with His own infinite power.                                      – [ Satyarth Prakash , Ch 7,pg 208 ,Tr. Dr. Chiranjiva]
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><strong>But we believe that God can do whatever He likes. There is no one above Him.</strong><br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><strong>A.     </strong>&#8211; What does He like? If you say that he likes and can do all things, we ask – <strong>&#8220;Can God kill Himself?&#8221;</strong> Or<strong>&#8220;can He make other Gods like Himself, become ignorant, commit sins such as theft, adultery and the like? Or can He be unhappy?&#8221;</strong> <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Your answer can only be in the negative, as these things are opposed to the nature and attributes of God</span>; hence your contention, that God can do all things, does not hold good. Our meaning only, therefore, of the word All-powerful is true.                                                                   – [ Satyarth Prakash , Ch 7,pg 208 ,Tr. Dr. Chiranjiva]
</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">We would also like to quote the hate monger, <span style="color:#ffcc00;">Islāmophobe Agniveer, so as to expose his ignorance</span>, this Islāmophobe wrote &#8211;<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><strong>Q: Is Ishwar Omnipotent or All-Powerful?</strong><br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">A: <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Yes, He is omnipotent<strong>.<span style="color:red;"> But that does not mean He can do whatever He wants</span></strong></span>. <span style="color:red;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Doing whatever one may want is sign of indiscipline. On contrary, Ishwar is most disciplined</span>.<strong> Omnipotence means that Ishwar does not need help of any other entity to conduct His duties</strong> – creation, management, destruction of universe. He is self-sufficient to conduct His duties. But He would act only as per His duties. For example,He will not kill Himself to create another Ishwar. He cannot make Himself an idiot. He cannot do theft or dacoity etc.</span><br />

</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">These <em>(above)</em> emphasized<em> (by us)</em> interrogative questions were asked by Moolshankar <em>(&amp; Agniveer)</em> to prove that his god <em>(Ishwar)</em>is <span style="text-decoration:underline;">not</span> omnipotent<em> (as per the meaning of the word)</em> in true sense but has limited omnipotence. Moolshankar <em>(so does Agniveer)</em>seems very eager and zealous to prove that his god <em>(Ishwar)</em> is not at all omnipotent in true sense, but merely is called so. Moolshankar seems to be trying pretty hard, to prove his definition of <em>&#8220;Omnipotence&#8221;</em> to be true, but drastically fails at it, as will be evident. Now coming to his silly, hilarious questions:<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">Firstly it&#8217;s to be noted that Moolshankar, states <em>(assumes)</em> that the answers to the questions will be in negative, I wonder why didn&#8217;t the questioner reply or why wasn&#8217;t his reply <em>(in detail or were these questions and answers made-up by himself, that&#8217;s the case most probably)</em> stated in Satyarth Prakash . Now replying to the insinuations and irrationality of Moolshankar and Agniveer.<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">We would be pleasured to ask –<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">Do these attributes or qualities/characteristics <em>(Killing, ignorance, theft, adultery…etc.)</em> befit Almighty God or belong to him? Of course not, Moolshankar also agrees by writing &#8220;<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><span style="color:red;">these things are opposed to the nature and attributes of God</span>&#8220;.</span> Now, we would like to question, how come these things are applied to God? Also, it&#8217;s should be noted that these are qualities of humans and not of God, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">so how can these be applied to God or how could one judge God&#8217;s capability in terms of these <em>[human]</em> acts?</span> Same deviant principle of judging and understanding God in human context and human attributes is followed by Agniveer , our readers need not get surprised after all Agniveer is a mere blind-follower of Moolshankar .We read Agniveer stating &#8220;Doing whatever one may want is sign of indiscipline. On contrary, Ishwar is most disciplined&#8221; What a show of irrationality and illogicalness! This statement of Agniveer show&#8217;s us his <em>&#8216;conceptualization&#8217;</em> of God. What Agniveer states here is pure irrationality, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">God the Almighty is the <strong>creator of Discipline</strong></span> and hence he is not subjected to it , we wonder how could Agniveer even think of such a thing , he judges God in the light of human attributes and behavior!<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">Hence the so-called argument that doing whatever one wants is a sign of indiscipline is only applied to humans and not to God Almighty. Also, another aspect should be pointed out is that <span style="text-decoration:underline;">God Almighty by <strong>nature</strong> and<strong> definition</strong> is the <strong>Most-Perfect</strong> or <strong>All-Perfect</strong></span>, hence the one who&#8217;s perfect by nature needs no discipline at all, on contrary it&#8217;s only those who have the tendency to get deviated<em> (like humans, animals…etc) </em>and indulge in non-disciplinary acts and behavior need discipline and are subjected to it or judged by it.<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">This understanding of God in scales of human attributes and behavior, only show the anthropomorphic tendencies of Agniveer and his gross incoherency. To enlighten Agniveer we would present here, what Allāh Azz wa Jall <em>(the only One True Almighty God)</em> says which means:<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:purple;"><strong>                                         &#8220;<span style="text-decoration:underline;">There is nothing like Him(</span>Allāh)&#8221;</strong></span><br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><strong>                                                                                                    – [Surah Ash- Shura Ayat 11]</strong><br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">This verse proves and shows the obligation of rejection and negation of resembling God the Most Perfect, with His creation or anything else</span>. This is what we Muslims believe, in fact this is the most basic and fundamental principle which we Muslims are taught at first, hence as stated above, there is no similitude, resembling, likeness of God [<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>There is nothing like Him]</strong></span>, so are his attributes <em>[His attributes are perfectly Unique , and have no resembling, Similitude]</em>, hence we ask Protestant Hindus, to ponder upon it and we think and Agniveer too comes under Protestant Hinduism, so we would also ask him to humbly ponder upon this truly, great and glorious principle which every theist should believe in. This principle will help Agniveer get rid of his anthropomorphic tendencies – understanding God in light of Human attributes/context/behavior, as this verse makes clear that there is nothing like unto God.<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">We&#8217;ve also read what Moolshankar wrote; in fact both Agniveer and Moolshankar suffer from same disease of sophism, and irrationality<em> [moreover both have the anthropomorphic tendency of understanding God and judging him in Human behavioral patterns, attributes].</em> Questions <em>(like &#8216;<strong>Can God Kill Himself </strong>&#8216;<strong>…et al.)</strong></em> asked by Moolshankar and Agniveer are similar <em>[like both ask whether God can kill himself and create gods…etc]</em>, hence we would refute and debunk the questions <em>(insinuations) </em>asked by Moolshankar, and indirectly Agniveer&#8217;s questions will be debunked too.<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">Now coming back to the &#8216;questions&#8217; of Moolshankar –<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">And we would now again like to ask <strong><em>&#8220;Why would God need to steal something, when he is the creator of that thing and can create it?&#8221;</em></strong> Yeah, only the Protestant Hindu god <em>(Ishwar)</em> would need to steal things as he is not the Creator but only the efficient cause <em>(acc. to Protestant Hindu Theology)</em>, as prakriti <em>(Primordial Matter)</em> is eternal and uncreated like God , so it is possible that he could steal a bit from prakriti <em>(Primordial Matter)</em>.<span style="text-decoration:underline;">So why would God Almighty need to steal</span>? It&#8217;s ridiculous of Moolshankar to ask such hilarious and incoherent questions and this only adds up to his ignorance.<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">Now scrutinizing a bit more, Moolshankar also questions <strong>&#8216;can He<em>[God]</em> become ignorant, commit sins such as theft, adultery and the like&#8217;</strong> this is really hilarious and irrational. By scrutinizing and observing questions similar and those asked by him we, learn a lot of Moolshankar&#8217;s state of mind and the basis of his belief system. We&#8217;ll see questions similar to Moolshankar&#8217;s first to show the real problem in his approach and then refute his questions.<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">Basically what Moolshankar is trying to ask<strong> <em>&#8220;If God can do anything, can He make it impossible for him-self to do something [like adultery, theft…etc]?&#8221;</em></strong><br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">Such question&#8217;s becomes even clearer when we examine a related question: <strong>&#8220;Can God create an uncreated being?&#8221;</strong> The problem here is that the questioner has already defined the being to be uncreated and then proceeds to ask for something that contradicts that definition. The problem is in the questioner&#8217;s terms, not any lack in God&#8217;s potential. The same is true when asking God to make a circle with four sides. Having already provided a definition of a circle that could never include a four-sided figure, such a question is absurd. Something is certainly self-contradictory here, but it is the questioner&#8217;s terminology and not the omnipotence of God. The answer to the question (<strong>Can God kill Himself?)</strong> of Moolshankar is-. <strong>Well, killing <em>(death)</em> isn&#8217;t ability; it&#8217;s the inability to live</strong> moreover <span style="text-decoration:underline;">death is a creation</span> <em>(death is created and God&#8217;s uncreated)</em> of God, so it&#8217;s quite irrational to ask such questions as creation can never overcome the creator in any sense. The immortal cannot die because that defies His attribute of immortality. Similarly, the omnipotent cannot create a task that He can&#8217;t complete because such a task is merely a figment of one&#8217;s imagination and could not exist, not because He is incapable.Can God make 1=2? Well if 1=2, then it wouldn&#8217;t be 1! So the idea is self-contradictory, not God.<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">The question also reminds us of the idea of what happens when an immovable rock meets an unstoppable force? The two things cannot exist in the same universe. Likewise, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">if God exists then all things which contradict His attributes are imaginary, non-existent and impossible. They are forever bound to the realm of imagination and cannot be brought into existence.</span><br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">Similar is the question <em>(of Moolshankar)</em> &#8220;<strong>can He <span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;">make </span>other Gods like Himself&#8221; </strong>.In fact the phrase <strong>&#8220;can He <span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;">make</span> other Gods like Himself&#8221;</strong> is explicit sophism or false/invalid argument, and is a contradiction in terms, because the mere fact that something is created <em>(&#8216;</em><strong>can He <span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;">make&#8217;</span></strong><em>) </em>means that it cannot be a God. This question is like asking could God create <span style="text-decoration:underline;">&#8220;a god who is not a god?&#8221;</span> It is self-evident that the answer can only be: The power of God has nothing to do with that, because the idea that something can be a god and not a god is illogical and is irrational, and<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong> the power and might of God has nothing to do with irrationalities</strong></span>.<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">In fact all the questions asked by Moolshankar and Agniveer are just instances of sophism and are self-contradiction –<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">&#8211;          <strong>&#8220;Can God kill Himself?&#8221;</strong><br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">&#8211;          <strong>&#8220;Can He (God) make other Gods like Himself, become ignorant, commit sins such as theft, adultery and the like?</strong><br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">&#8211;          <strong>&#8220;Can He (God) be unhappy?&#8221;</strong><br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">God is eternal and uncreated<em>[in fact even Moolshankar attest to this , that his god Ishwar is eternal and uncreated] </em>by nature and definition hence God killing himself is irrational and contradictory in terms , also Killing <em>(or dying)</em> is a human&#8217;s act or attribute, like Humans kill humans, Humans die. So what we see is Moolshankar first defining God to be uncreated and eternal then posing a sophistic questions which are purely contradictory and irrational , Moolshankar is only contradicting himself.<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">As for creating God then again God is Uncreated and eternal, hence what is created cannot be god so it&#8217;s irrational and spurious even to think of such absurdities.<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">Same for questions like, &#8216;can God become Ignorant&#8217;, God by nature is <strong>All-wise </strong>and <strong>All-Knowledgeable</strong> hence again its contradiction and irrational, also things like ignorance, adultery sins, theft are all instances of human behaviors, attributes or actions and in no way can they ever be applied to God or used to judge God. Same with being <em>&#8220;Unhappy&#8221;</em>, being happy and unhappy are human attributes/characteristics and traits, not of God ,also these things contradict God&#8217;s attribute of Perfection<em>(All-Perfect)</em> hence God by nature being perfect is not subject to such things and state, such queries are but contradiction. As<span style="text-decoration:underline;"> God exists hence all things which contradict His attributes are imaginary, non-existent and impossible. They are forever bound to the realm of imagination and cannot be brought into existence. Also the Power, Majesty and Might of Almighty God have nothing to do with Irrationalities.</span><br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">Hence we see Moolshankar using sophistry <em>(false-invalid arguments)</em> to prove that &#8220;Omnipotence&#8221; in fact means &#8220;<strong><em><span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;">the power of doing all His works without any help</span>.&#8221;  And not &#8220;</em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">able to do anything</span>&#8220;</strong> which in fact, is the true and right definition of being Omnipotent.<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">Concluding, it will be beneficial to note, how Moolshankar uses his irrationality and Sophistry to prove things. Like first he defines Ishwar as uncreated and beginning-less and then questions whether &#8220;God can kill himself?&#8221; that&#8217;s so self-contradictory and irrational of him. Again and again he repeats his irrational questions like &#8220;<strong>can He(God) <span style="color:red;">make</span> other Gods like Himself&#8221; , </strong>same here he as defined and stated God to be &#8220;Uncreated&#8221; , then ask can God <span style="text-decoration:underline;">make</span>other Gods? This is what happens when you swallow the excreta of philosopher&#8217;s brain. This is pure irrationality and this will be evident, even to novice or amateur, let&#8217;s see what a mathematician opines about such ridiculous questions.<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><strong>Mathematician&#8217;s Opinion –</strong><br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">Summing up the section, I would like to present a short quote from a revert to Islām – Dr. Jeffrey Lang, a mathematician <em>[Professor of Mathematics at University of Kansas, US] (an ex-atheist)] </em>–<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">&#8220;If God is all-powerful, can He become a man, terminate His existence, tell a lie, be unjust, or create a stone too heavy for even Him to move? <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>These somewhat <span style="color:red;">silly</span> riddles most often arise from imposing unnecessary and <span style="color:red;">contradictory assumptions</span> on certain attributes of God or by <span style="color:red;">assigning unwarranted additional attributes</span> to Him.</strong></span>&#8221;<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">&#8211; [&#8220;Even Angels Ask&#8221;, Dr. Jeffrey Lang, pg. 69, Beltsville, 1997]
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">We are pretty sure that every intelligent, sane and unbiased person will believe such &#8216;questions&#8217; to be silly, and illogical.<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">It would also be beneficial <em>(concisely)</em> to state the reasons why Moolshankar delved into such absurdities which are totally untenable. It&#8217;s necessary to note that Moolshankar was reluctant enough to apply <em>(judge and understand) </em>human attributes to God in order to prove his point; also his conception of God in his mind was somewhat anthropomorphic in essence. This also shows how Moolshankar swallowed the excreta of philosophers and atheists&#8217; <em>(in fact, sophistry was chiefly used by atheist to disprove God and his existence)</em> brain in order to forward his claims, delude people from the straight path and malign and corrupt monotheism.<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><strong>Islāmic Stance –</strong><br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">To enlighten people about Islām and present a true picture of Islām <em>(which the Hate-monger&#8217;s and quacks like Mahendra Pāl, Agniveer cowardly and hypocritically don&#8217;t do, due to their bias, prejudice and hate for Islām.)</em> we&#8217;ll shortly and very briefly present Islāmic point of view here, very concisely for our readers and truth Seekers –<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Who&#8217;s the Creator?</strong></span><br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">Allāh the Most-Merciful says which means,<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">&#8220;<span style="color:purple;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>That is Allāh, your Lord, the Creator of all things</strong></span>, Lā ilāha illā Huwa <em>(none has the right to be worshipped but He)</em>. How then are you turning away <em>(from Allāh, by worshipping others instead of Him)</em>?&#8221;    </span>                           – [Surah Al-Mu&#8217;min , Ayat 62]
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">See you O, protestant Hindus your only One True Almighty God <em>(Allāh)</em> states that He is the Creator of all things; still you turn away from Him and worship false-god?<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">And in another verse of the Noble, Holy Qur&#8217;ān, Allāh Azz wa Jall says which means,<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">&#8220;<span style="color:purple;">Such is Allāh, your Lord(none has the right to be worshipped but He), the</span> <strong><span style="color:purple;text-decoration:underline;">Creator of all things</span>.<span style="color:purple;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">So worship Him <em>(Alone),</em></span> and He is the Wakîl <em>(Trustee, Disposer of affairs or Guardian)</em> over all things.&#8221;</span> – [Surah, Al-An&#8217;aam, Ayat 102]</strong><br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">Again theonly One True Almighty God <em>(Allāh)</em> states that He alone is the Creator of all things and calls every of his creation to worship Him alone.<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Is God (Allāh) Omnipotent or All-Powerful?</strong></span><br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">Allāh the Most-Merciful says which means,<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><strong><span style="color:purple;">&#8220;Truly, Allāh is Ever Most Powerful, All-Wise.&#8221;</span> </strong>         – [Surah An-Ni&#8217;saa, Ayat 56]
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:purple;"><strong>&#8220;Verily, Allāh is Ever Oft-Pardoning, All-Powerful.&#8221;</strong></span>    – [Surah An-Ni&#8217;saa, Ayat 149]
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:purple;"><strong>&#8220;Truly, Allāh is All-Knowing, All-Powerful.&#8221;</strong></span>                 – [Surah An-Nahl, Ayat 70]
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:purple;"><strong>&#8220;Verily, Allāh is All-Powerful, All-Mighty.&#8221;</strong></span>               – [Surah Al-Mujaadilah, Ayat 21]
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">We think the above quoted verses speak for themselves; we need not re-write what the verses make so explicitly evident. We learn that Allāh Azz wa Jall is Omnipotent unlike the protestant Hindu god Ishwar who isn&#8217;t, moreover he <em>(Ishwar)</em> is dependent over other to &#8216;engineer&#8217; hence is not even the creator- we&#8217;ll expound on this issue later in the article.<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">We all know that Al-Qur&#8217;ān al-Kareem cannot be translated, it&#8217;s a well known fact attested by approximately every Arabic scholar be it Muslim or non-Muslim, Al-Qur&#8217;ān is perfectly unique and hence there is no question that it&#8217;s glory and perfection can be conveyed in any other language except that in which it was revealed <em>(we can only try and convey interpretation of its meanings)</em>, and even the famous briton &#8216;translator&#8217; of the Qur&#8217;an Marmaduke Pickthall<em>(An famous English literati who reverted to Islām)</em>confessed saying &#8211;<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">&#8220;<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>The Koran cannot be translated</strong></span>… It is only an attempt to <span style="text-decoration:underline;">present the meaning</span> of the Koran and peradventure something of the charm in English. It can never take the place of the Koran in Arabic, nor is it meant to do so.&#8221;<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">&#8211; [The Meanings of the Glorious Koran, pg. vii, Alfred A. Knopp Inc., 1930]
</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">What we can do, is somehow show and translate the interpretation of meanings of Glorious, Noble Qur&#8217;ān, in different languages.<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Hence it&#8217;s to be understood that all the Qur&#8217;ānic verse quoted here in the article are mere interpretation of the meanings of the Noble Qur&#8217;ān.</span><br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><strong>Strengthen your Understanding –</strong><br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">Summarizing this sub-section <em>(i.e. <strong>&#8216;A) Is Protestant Hinduism Monotheistic?&#8217;</strong>)</em>, we would like to review what we&#8217;ve learnt about protestant Hindu theology, their creedal system and Protestant Hindus –<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><strong>1)</strong> Ishwar<em>(Protestant Hindu God)</em> isn&#8217;t the <strong>&#8216;Creator&#8217; </strong>but simply the <strong>&#8216;Maker&#8217; , &#8216;Engineer&#8217;</strong> ,&#8217;<strong>Fashioner&#8217;</strong> of the world , as he didn&#8217;t create Prakriti <em>(Primordial matter)</em> nor Ātmā <em>(Human Souls) </em> as per Protestant Hindu Theology. What does this necessitate?<br />
</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">This belief itself proves protestant Hinduism to be non-Monotheistic, as in Monotheistic belief everything <span style="text-decoration:underline;">is dependent on God</span>, but here 2 entities namely Prakriti <em>(Primordial matter)</em> and Ātmā are <strong>independent</strong>. Where as God is dependent on Prakriti <em>(Primordial matter)</em> for <strong>&#8216;Making&#8217;</strong> <strong>&#8216;engineering&#8217;</strong> <strong>&#8216;Fashioning&#8217;</strong> Universe …etc things out of it.<br />
</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">This belief rips God of his one main and very important attribute that&#8217;s Uniqueness , Ishwar<em>(Protestant Hindu God)</em> isn&#8217;t unique as he share&#8217;s the very same attribute with Prakriti <em>(Primordial matter)</em> and Ātmā , that is attributes like <strong>&#8216;Uncreated&#8217;</strong> ,<strong>&#8216;Beginning less&#8217; .This make&#8217;s Vedic God <em>(Ishwar)</em> <span style="text-decoration:underline;">a mere artificer and Demiurge</span> , which results to pure Polytheism.</strong><br />
</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">This belief also , entitlesPrakriti <em>(Primordial matter)</em> and Ātmā <em>(Human Souls) </em>  to be <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Partners of God</strong></span>, in being &#8216;Uncreated&#8217; and in &#8216;Making&#8217; and &#8216;engineering&#8217; of Universe as the Protestant Hindu God(<em>Ishwar) </em>is dependent on both Ātmā<em>(Human Souls) </em> and Prakriti <em>(Primordial matter)</em> to bring about this Universe. This in Islām is known as <strong>Shirk </strong>or<strong>Associationism</strong>, which is in fact polytheism. Hence Protestant Hinduism by nature is Polytheistic.<br />
</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">We&#8217;ve also proved that protestant Hinduism doesn&#8217;t regard its God to be &#8216;Omnipotent&#8217; or All-Powerful and their use of these words is totally futile as these are used just used in empty sense without affirming the meanings of these words.<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><strong>2) </strong>We&#8217;ve also learnt and seen how Moolshankar and his blind-follower Agniveer use Sophistry to prove their point.<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">There are many other points and proofs which expose the falsity of the protestant Hinduism being Monotheistic, these points and proofs shall be discussed and stated in the next sub-section.<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">Written by Abd Al Muhsin Al Hindy<br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">The proponents <em>(blind-follower&#8217;s)</em> of protestant Hinduism stress that their cult<em> (and Vedic Hinduism)</em> is strictly monotheistic and has nothing to do with dualism, polytheism, pantheism, monistic or any other conception of God but monotheism. Whereas the orthodox Hindus maintain the opposite, that Vedic Dharma <em>(Vedic Religion)</em> is not monotheistic and the cult <em>(Protestant Hinduism, so-called Arya Samāj)</em> is unorthodox and deviated. In order to solve this <em>&#8216;mystery&#8217;</em>, we&#8217;ll be showing <span style="text-decoration:underline;">few more proofs</span>, which will prove that protestant Hinduism is purely non-monotheistic, wearing garb of monotheism in order to delude and lead people astray, especially those who try to seek truth. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">This sub-section aims at exposing the polytheist <em>(i.e. protestant Hindus) </em>posing as monotheists</span>. In the previous sub-section<em> (i.e. <strong>&#8216;A) Is Protestant Hinduism Monotheistic?&#8217;</strong>) ,</em>we&#8217;ve already provided many proofs, to prove the non-monotheistic nature of protestant Hinduism, still we want to block any mice holes through which any such false claim could be made or even be thought of.<br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span id="more-1648"></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><strong>b.1) Ishwar is Dependent not Independent – </strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">We&#8217;ve seen the <strong>&#8216;proposed definition&#8217;</strong> for Omnipotence by the protestant Hindus, now its time to put this proposed definition to scrutiny and see whether it can rightly depict the true picture of Protestant Hindu god Ishwar. Again in a precise manner we&#8217;ll be stating the &#8216;proposed definition&#8217; as given by protestant Hindus – </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><span style="color:#ff9900;"><strong>Agniveer </strong></span>the new Islāmophobe <em>(once was a &#8220;wannabee&#8221; but now is full-fledged Islāmophobe)</em>, hate-monger wrote –</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">&#8220;<strong>Omnipotence means that Ishwar <span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;">does not need help of any other entity</span> to conduct His duties</strong> – creation, management, destruction of universe. He is self-sufficient to conduct His duties&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Moolshankar Tiwāri <em>(Dayānanda Saraswati)</em> wrote – </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">&#8220;It really means that God <strong>does not require the least assistance</strong> from any person in all His works such as Creation, Sustenance and Dissolution of the Universe, and administration</span> of Divine Justice. In other words, He does all His works with His own infinite power.&#8221; –  [SP, Ch 7, pg. 208, Tr.Chiranjiva] [See Sub-section a.2 for the complete source]</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Moolshankar <em>(Dayānanda Saraswati)</em> wrote – </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">&#8220;…<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>God stands in need of nobody&#8217;s least help</strong></span> in doing His work of creation, preservation, and destruction, and in doing equitable justice to souls according to their merits and demerits. In other words, <strong>He accomplishes all His works out of His own infinite power</strong>.&#8221;                                                   </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">                              – [Satyarth Prakash Ch 7, pg.211 Tr. Durga Prasad]</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">In the earlier sub-section we had hinted at the dependent nature of Ishwar, and Inshā&#8217;Allāh we&#8217;ll expound on it more in this sub-section, as we read above, that the proposed definition of <strong>&#8220;Omnipotence&#8221;</strong> is <strong>&#8220;[Ishwar]</strong><br />
<strong><span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;">does not need help of any other entity</span>&#8221; </strong>as stated by the Islāmophobe Agniveer. But does Ishwar stands true to this <strong>&#8216;proposed definition&#8217;? </strong>We learn that according to Mooshankar, his god Ishwar needs nobody&#8217;s help? Well that&#8217;s quite contradictory to the apparent facts, which we&#8217;ve seen and other are mentioned below.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">We&#8217;ve have sufficiently shown the distorted nature of the <strong>&#8216;proposed definition&#8217;</strong> of <strong>Omnipotence</strong> by Moolshankar, and shown his deception, now we seek to elaborate something which readers may have noticed in our early points but may not have fathomed it completely. Above we saw the definition of <em>&#8220;Omnipotence&#8221; </em>by Protestant Hindus where they claim that Omnipotence means &#8220;<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">God does not require the least assistance from any person</span>&#8221; or &#8220;Ishwar does not need help of any other entity&#8221; or &#8220;<span style="text-decoration:underline;">God stands in need of nobody&#8217;s least help</span>.&#8221;</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">The problem with their &#8216;<strong>proposed definition&#8217; </strong>is that their god Ishwar does not stand true even upon this definition<span style="text-decoration:underline;">! Ishwar does require </span>the assistance<em> (help)</em> of Ātmā <em>(Human Souls)</em> and Prakriti <em>(Primordial matter)</em> for the creation of this universe. </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">All of his duties (<em>Ishwar&#8217;s)</em> are dependent on basically two things – Ātmā <em>(Human Souls)</em> and Prakriti <em>(Primordial matter)</em>, hence he is not self-sufficient nor is he independent of others and their help.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">For instance, what if Ātmā <em>(Human Souls)</em> refuse to <em>(or don&#8217;t)</em> inhabit the bodies created by Ishwar using Prakriti? As according to protestant Hinduism, Ātmā <em>(Human Souls)</em> are &#8216;sat&#8217; <em>(eternal)</em> and have &#8216;chit&#8217; <em>(conscious)</em> , where as Ishwar is &#8216;sat&#8217; <em>(eternal)</em> has chit <em>(conscious)</em> and has &#8216;ānanda&#8217; <em>(bliss)[hence protestant god Ishwar is known as Satchidananda], and prakriti( primordial matter)</em>  is only &#8216;sat&#8217;<em>(eternal)</em> and lacks the other 2 attributes.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">As these souls have conscious they are responsible whether or not to associate themselves with the bodies…etc made using prakriti, by Ishwar. And this is what is stated by a Protestant Hindu Pandit in his book – </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><strong>&#8220;Souls tend to <span style="color:red;">associate</span> themselves with matter </strong><span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;">but are free</span><strong> to do so with God</strong>. In the former case they are subject to births and deaths, in the latter case they acquire bliss which is a divine attribute. <strong>In both cases it retains its individuality being uncreated and indestructible.</strong>&#8220;</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">       – [The Handbook of Ārya Samāj, pg 41, Pandit Vishnu Lāl Sharmā, Ārya Pratinidhi Sabhā]</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">We question, what if all the Ātma <em>(Human Souls)</em> refuse to associate themselves with Ishwar and matter <em>(Ishwar made Bodies…etc)</em>? The <strong>making</strong> of this universe cannot be completed, without their help and co-operation! Now you need not be &#8216;scholar&#8217; or even a &#8216;graduate&#8217; from MIT, Harvard or NASA to predict and guess the outcome of such situation! It&#8217;s evident that Ishwar is NOT Self-sufficient and requires assistance<em> (needs prakriti)</em> from prakriti for making universe and co-operation from Ātmā to make the universe working. So who does Ishwar need and depend?</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">1)      Ātmā <em>(Human Souls)</em></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">2)      Prakriti<em>(Primordial matter)</em></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Ishwar depends and needs Prakriti <em>(Primordial matter)</em> for creating this universe, hence he cannot be self-sufficient or independent.Moreover Ishwar also requires  Ātmā <em>(Human Souls)</em>to make his universe <strong>&#8220;living&#8221;</strong> or <strong>&#8220;active&#8221;</strong> as mere bodies without souls are nothing but matter. Hence for a <strong>&#8220;working&#8221;</strong>, <strong>&#8220;active&#8221;</strong> universe Ishwar heavily depends upon his two other partners named above.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Now let&#8217;s assume for the sake of argumentation, that – </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Ātmā <em>(Human Souls)</em> totally including everyone of the souls, agree to either associate with, matter <em>(Ishwar&#8217;s making i.e. Universe, Human Bodies…Etc)</em> or Ishwar, so will then Ishwar be Omnipotent according to the <strong>&#8216;proposed definition&#8217;</strong> of omnipotence by protestant Hindus?</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Of course not as, even then Ishwar will still be dependent on prakriti<em>(Primordial Matter)</em>, for making universe, Human bodies, animal bodies…etc as Ishwar cannot create primordial matter<em>(prakriti)</em> nor destroy it, he is a mere &#8216;Fashioner&#8217; or &#8216;Engineer&#8217; of it ,in terms of Agniveer.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Hence in no way, either by the correct definition of &#8216;Omnipotence&#8221; or by the distorted definition <em>(<strong>&#8216;proposed definition&#8217; </strong>by protestant Hindus)</em> is Ishwar OMNIPOTENT.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">This ultimately proves that God is purely in need of the other 2 co-eternal entities. Hence even the &#8216;proposed&#8217; definition of Omnipotence <em>(i.e. &#8220;<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">God does not require the least assistance from any person</span>&#8221; or &#8220;<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Ishwar does not need help of any other entity&#8221;</span> or &#8220;<span style="text-decoration:underline;">He is self-sufficient to conduct His duties</span>.&#8221;)</strong></em> is too big for Ishwar. And that he <em>(Ishwar) </em>does not stand up to this definition. This materialistic view of creation makes protestant Hinduism very close to materialism; it would be ridiculous of thinking them to be monotheistic in any sense.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Now, that we&#8217;ve learned how desperately Ishwar&#8217;s in need of prakriti and Human souls, but let&#8217;s see another scenario, where Ishwar has run into bankruptcy. Moolshankar<em><span style="color:black;"> (Day</span>ā<span style="color:black;">nanda Saraswati)</span></em>, wrote in his <span style="color:black;"><strong><em>&#8216;Bible of Hate&#8217;</em></strong><br />
<em>(Satyarth Prak</em></span><em>ā<span style="color:black;">sh)</span></em> :</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><strong>13. No, there can be no dearth of souls, because the emancipated souls are replaced by new ones that God creates.</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><strong>A </strong>– &#8220;…Fifthly, if you say that God creates new souls, <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>the material out of which He creates them will eventually run short</strong></span>; because a bank, however wealthy it may be that has a constant drain on it, but has no income, is sure to become bankrupt sooner or later.&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>

</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><strong>Q. God replaces the saved souls with the newly created souls on earth. So they never come to an end.</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><strong>A </strong>&#8211; &#8220;…If God creates new souls, <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>the material out of which He creates them, will be exhausted</strong></span>; for, however much a treasure may be, it will sooner or later run out, if there be nothing bat drawings upon it and no puttings in it.&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">                                              &#8211; [Satyarth Prakash, Ch 9, pg. 264, Tr.Durga Prasad]</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">What, you&#8217;ve read above is a question posed to Moolshankar related to emancipation souls <em>(he was trying to refute the notion that souls are created at which he fails drastically)</em>, and while answering this question Moolshankar states that <span style="text-decoration:underline;">&#8220;matter&#8221; is limited and will get exhausted one day or the other</span>. It&#8217;s the protestant Hindu belief that except god <em>(Ishwar)</em> the other 2 entity are finite. Hence this makes Moolshakar assert that &#8220;prakriti&#8221; <em>(Primordial matter)</em> is limited and one day will get depleted.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">This belief of limited or finite prakriti <em>(Primordial matter)</em> strengthens our argument of Ishwar being dependent and provides a blow to the so-called, distortedly fake, Omnipotence of Ishwar. </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Mavericks like us would question – </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><strong>What if prakriti <em>(Primordial matter)</em> gets depleted? </strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<div style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Well, Ishwar will no longer be able to provide for the Humans Souls <em>(Ātmā)</em> for their sustenance. And then Ishwar will be in a big trouble! And when Ishwar cannot provide for Humans Souls <em>(Ātmā)</em> living in material bodies engineered by Ishwar using prakriti <em>(Primordial matter)</em> then by effect Ishwar will cease to be the Sustainer of his own engineering&#8217;s <em>(i.e Human Bodies,Universe…etc)</em> So this rips Ishwar from the attribute of <em>&#8220;Sustainer&#8221;</em> too.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></div>
</li>
<li>
<div style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Seccondly, this strengthens our claim that Ishwar is extremely dependent on prakriti <em>(Primordial Matter)</em>.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><strong>b.2) Attributes of Ishwar – </strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Attributes and names of God are the crux of theology of any religious denomination and these attributes are very intrinsic to the concept of God, as these attributes define and make us understand what God is – to an extent. Since early times, mankind has been in an abyss of darkness due to its misunderstanding of these attributes of God, it&#8217;s these attributes which play a major role in conceptualizing the &#8216;Concept of God&#8217; in any religion, and if these attributes are misunderstood then the consequences are devastating. We&#8217;ll be having a concise look at the names and attributes of Ishwar as stated and understood by Moolshankar <em>(Dayānanda Saraswati)</em></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">&#8220;<strong>Virat</strong>-The word virat (an illumer) is derived from the root &#8216;raj&#8217;: to illume or shine, with the prefix &#8216;vi&#8217; and &#8216;kvipa&#8217; termination. He who illumes and manifests the world in various forms, is called Virat. Hence it means God.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><strong>Pita Maha</strong>&#8211; God is called Pita Maha, because he is the father of fathers. </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Here above, we&#8217;ve enumerated few <em>(reproducing all names would take a huge amount of space, and would be un-yielding)</em> names of protestant Hindu god Ishwar, as enlisted by Moolshankar in his <strong>&#8216;Bible of Hate&#8217;</strong><em> (i.e. Satyarth Prakāsh).</em> There is huge controversy what these name mean, for instance Orthodox Hindus maintain that <strong>&#8216;Agni&#8217; </strong>means fire primarily where as Moolshankar believes it to be a name of Ishwar. We won&#8217;t be delving into this controversy as it&#8217;s beyond the scope of this article<em> (treatise)</em>, the purpose of mentioning this was to show the vast differing between mainstream Hinduism and protestant Hinduism, and to expose these so-called names of God, we need just a single verse from the divine revelation from Allāh Azz wa Jall our alone One true God.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">The Noble Qur&#8217;ān says which means,</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><strong><span style="color:purple;">&#8220;You do not worship besides Him but only names which you have</span><br />
<span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;">named <em>(forged)</em></span><br />
<span style="color:purple;">– you and your fathers – for which Allāh has sent down no authority.</span></strong><br />
<span style="color:purple;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">The command <em>(or the judgement)</em> is for none but All</span>ā<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>. He has commanded that you worship none but Him <em>(i.e. His Monotheism)</em>; that is the <em>(true)</em> straight religion, but most men know not.&#8221;</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">We see how the Noble Qur&#8217;ān refutes the misdoings of people like Moolshankar, his predecessors and other polytheists, the above divine verse from the Noble Qur&#8217;ān clearly states that the different names, which are claimed to be of the one true Almighty God <em>(Allāh)</em> by the polytheists like protestant Hindus are just FORGERIES by these protestant Hindus and their deviant predecessors. These protestant Hindus like their idol worshipping predecessors have merely concocted names which have no authority from the true Almighty God<em> (Allāh)</em>.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">The above verse, also makes it clears, that this protestant Hindu POLYTHEISM has no authority from the One True Almighty God <em>(Allāh)</em>, hence we Muslims would like to call our protestant Hindu truth-seekers and our readers to the straight path – True Religion , Islām. </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Now coming to the attributes of Ishwar – the protestant Hindu god, we&#8217;ve earlier stated/proved few attributed of Ishwar they are – </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">But according to the same Yajurveda , which first states that Ishwar is &#8216;Incomparable&#8217; but later on compares him to a <strong>&#8216;shining man of knowledge&#8217; –</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

I think this should be enough to prove our point, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">also another important point to be noticed is &#8220;anthropomorphism&#8221;, Yajurveda clearly states the Hindu protestant God Ishwar, shines <span style="color:red;"><strong>LIKE</strong></span> the shining man of knowledge</span>! This is explicit anthropomorphism, of which few instances were quite evident from Moolshankar&#8217;s <em>(and his blind-follower)</em> writings which we had quoted in earlier sections.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Though the above quoted verse satisfactorily proves our point, we shall provide one more verse from the same Yajurveda which show&#8217;s how anthropomorphic Vedas are and that Ishwar is compared in Vedas itself.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">The above quoted verse clearly compares two entities that are –</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">1) <strong>Persons</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">2) <strong>Ishwar<em> (God)</em></strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"> It <em>(verse)</em> states that there are <strong>&#8220;Persons&#8221;</strong> who are excellent <span style="color:red;"><strong>LIKE</strong></span> God! So, there is someone <em>(here persons)</em> like God, according to Vedas!</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">We think it&#8217;s completely proven with no ounce of doubt left, that Ishwar is Comparable and that Vedas are self-contradictory. Still for the sake of argumentation and nailing the issue lets see some other facts which prove Ishwar to be completely comparable.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Above quoted statements of Moolshankar<em> (Dayānanda Saraswati)</em> prove the following things – </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">1)      <strong>Ishwar</strong> and <strong>Human Souls </strong><em>(Ātmā) </em>are <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>beginning-less</strong></span><br />
<em>(also prakriti as stated in Section A).</em></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">2)      <strong>Human Souls </strong><em>(Ātmā)</em>and <strong>Ishwar </strong>have by nature <strong>IDENTICAL attributes </strong>for instance<strong> ,</strong> they both are CONSCIOUS ,pure, immortal, virtuous…etc</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">So what does this prove? Such belief-system legitimizes <strong>&#8220;Comparing&#8221;</strong> the protestant Hindu god <strong>Ishwar </strong>to <strong>Human Souls</strong><em> (Ātmā)</em><strong> and prakriti </strong><em>(Primordial matter)</em><strong> as all the 3 entities are – </strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><strong>a)</strong>      <strong><em>Beginning-less</em>, b) <em>Eternal,</em> c) <em>Uncreated</em></strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">So it&#8217;s possible to say that <em>&#8216;Ishwar is Eternal like(identical) prakriti&#8217;</em> or <em>&#8216;Ishwar is beginning-less like(identical) Human Souls&#8217;</em> or <em>&#8216;Ishwar and other 2 entities are alike in 3 attributes namely beginning-less, Eternal, Uncreated-ness&#8217;</em></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">The problem is with <strong>IDENTICAL</strong> attributes <em>(Eternal,Uncreated,beginning-less,…etc)</em>, these identical attributes make Ishwar comparable and co-equal to the other 2 entities, which is violation of monotheism, and disqualifies protestant Hinduism from the claim of being Monotheistic.</span><br />
<strong>Identical</strong> attributes prove that Ishwar is identical to and resembles somewhat to Human Souls <em>(Ātmā)</em>and prakriti <em>(Primordial Matter)</em>, to some extent.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><strong>b.2.2) Is Ishwar Coequal –</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">According to Moolshankar&#8217;s <em>(Dayānanda Saraswati)</em> belief, Ishwar is not coequal as stated by him in Satyarth Prakash- </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">   &#8220;<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>There is none beside, Thee, who is equal</strong></span> to Thee or above Thee.&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">                                          – [Satyarth Prakash, Ch.1 pg. 35Tr.Chiranjiva Bhardawaja]</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><span style="color:black;">&#8220;The Great Eternal Spirit undergoes no modifications, requires no instruments to work with, <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>has <span style="color:red;">no equal<span style="color:black;"> nor any superior</span></span></strong></span>. He is the Supremely Powerful Being, endowed with innate Omniscience, Omnipresence and Infinite activity.&#8221; SHWETA SHWETAR UPANISHAD 6, 8.&#8221;                              &#8211; [</span>Satyarth Prakash, Ch.1 pg. 218 ,Tr.Chiranjiva Bhardawaja]</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Although, Moolshankar <em>(Dayānanda Saraswati)</em> seems to be zealously ascribing non-coequality to his Ishwar, the reality of the matter is totally different which we want to shed light upon. So does Ishwar have someone equal to him or equal to him in anything? Yes, of course he is <em>(coequal)</em> as proven above <em>(earlier-subsection)</em>, Ishwar is coequal to Human Souls <em>(Ātmā)</em> and prakriti <em>(Primordial Matter)</em>.Ishwar is coequal as he has <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>identical </strong>attributes which make him coequal in </span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><em>1)</em>      <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Eternity</em></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><em>2)</em>      <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Uncreated-ness</em></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><em>3)</em>      <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Beginning-less-ness.</em></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">As all the 3 entities are eternal, uncreated and beginning-less. Hence Ishwar is coequal undoubtedly. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Also Ishwar is co-equal in Consciousness, virtue, purity with Human Souls <em>(Ātm</em></span><em>ā<span style="text-decoration:underline;">)</span></em> as these are <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>identical attributes</strong> shared by the two, as stated by Moolshankar</span>. Not only is Ishwar Co-equal in eternity with the above stated entities but also with other as stated by Moolshankar –</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">&#8220;…<span style="color:black;text-decoration:underline;"><strong>the prakriti, the souls, time and space which are all uncreated and eternal.&#8221;</strong></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">                                                                           – [Satyarth Prakash , Ch 8, pg 253, Tr.Chirajiva Bhardawaja]</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"> Earlier, we&#8217;ve stated the major 3 eternal entities but there are few other entities which are eternal and Uncreated according to Moolshankar Tiwāri <em>(Dayānanda Saraswati)</em> they are <strong>time</strong> and <strong>space</strong>. So it&#8217;s perfectly fine to say that, Ishwar is Coequal in <strong><em>Eternity</em></strong> and <strong><em>Uncreated-ness</em></strong> not only with Human Souls <em>(Ātmā)</em>and prakriti <em>(Primordial Matter)</em> but also with <strong>time</strong> and <strong>space</strong>.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Apart from these proofs there are other proofs which we want to put light upon which will explicitly and evidently prove that Ishwar is coequal to Human Souls <em>(Ātmā)</em>and prakriti <em>(Primordial Matter)</em>…etc</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Protestant Hindu theology, states that the number of cause of this universe are as follows –</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;text-decoration:underline;"><strong>5. How many causes are there of the Universe</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:black;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><strong>A.-<span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;">Three </span></strong><span style="color:black;">&#8211; <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">The efficient , the material and the common</span>. </strong>The <strong>efficient cause </strong>is the one by whose directed activity a thing is made, and by the absence of whose directed activity nothing is made. It does not change itself, though it works changes in other things. The <strong>material cause </strong>is one without which nothing can be made. It undergoes changes, is made and un-made. The <strong>common cause </strong>is one that is an instrument in the making of a thing, and is common to many things. The <strong>efficient cause </strong>is of two kinds:- <span style="text-decoration:underline;">The <strong>Primary efficient cause </strong>is the Supreme Spirit – the Governor </span></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Of all, Who creates the universe out of the prakriti (matter), sustains it, and then resolves it into its elementary form. </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;text-decoration:underline;">The <strong>secondary efficient cause </strong>is the soul. It takes different materials out of the universe created by God and moulds them into different shapes. </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">The <strong>material cause </strong>is the prakiti which is the material used in the making of the universe. Being devoid of intelligence it can neither make nor unmake itself, but is always mad or unmade by a conscious intelligent being; though here and there even one kind of dead matter (but those changes are never ordered). Let us take an illustration. God made seeds (of different kinds), when they fall into a suitable soil and get the proper amount of water and nourishment, they develop into trees; but if they come in contact with fire they perish. All ordered changes in material things depend for their occurrence on God and the soul. </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;text-decoration:underline;"><strong>All such means as knowledge, strength and hands, and instruments, time and space, that are required for the making of thing constitute its common cause. </strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Now take for illustration a pot. The potter is its efficient cause clay its material cause, whilst the rod, the wheel and other instruments, time, space, light, eyes, hands (of the potter), knowledge and the necessary labour, etc., constitute its common cause. <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Nothing can be made or unmade without these three causes.</strong></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

<strong><em>Secondary Efficient Cause</em></strong><br />
<em>(Ātmā – Human Souls).</em></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><strong>2)</strong> The <strong><em>Material Cause</em></strong><br />
<em>(Prakriti – Primordial Matter).</em></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

<em>(&#8216;<span style="color:black;"><strong>common cause </strong>is one that is an instrument in the making of a thing&#8217; for instance knowledge, strength, hands, instruments, time and space).</span></em></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Earlier we proved that Ishwar is not a <em>&#8220;Creator&#8221;</em> but he is only a <em>&#8220;Maker&#8221; &#8220;Engineer&#8221;</em>…etc but this is the partial truth Ishwar isn&#8217;t the <strong><em>&#8220;Maker&#8221;</em></strong> or <strong><em>&#8220;Engineer&#8221;</em></strong> of the universe in complete sense he is just a <em>&#8220;part&#8221;</em> or one of the causes which <em>&#8220;engineer&#8221;</em> or <em>&#8220;make&#8221;</em> the universe and his other partners are listed above. This again evidently proves that Ishwar is coequal with –</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Ishwar has equal partners <em>(entities)</em>, which assisted him in <em>&#8216;managing&#8217;</em> and <em>&#8216;engineering&#8217;</em> of the universe <em>(who are equally important in engineering of the universe)</em>, which ultimately makes these entities as <strong><em>&#8216;Coequal&#8217;</em></strong> to Ishwar as without these the bringing about of universe is impossible. Hence these coequal causes of the universe are coequal to Ishwar.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Basically these are the same three causes which according to Moolshankar brought about the universe, except that here he <em>(Moolshankar)</em> expands the three causes to 6, but we think it&#8217;s quite incoherent to do so, as &#8220;<span style="color:red;"><strong>combination of atoms</strong></span>&#8221; come under material Cause<em>(atoms)</em> and Common Cause <em>(combining – application of atoms) </em>and &#8220;<span style="color:red;"><strong>requisite skill, knowledge and thought.&#8221;</strong></span> Also come under Common cause so does<strong><span style="color:red;"> &#8220;application&#8221;</span>, </strong>and the other 2 causes are clearly same<em>(Maker=Ishwar,Material, Cause=prakriti.</em>Hence it&#8217;s quite incoherent of Moolshankar to first propose 3 causes of the world then to make them 6.We also read Moolshankar stating that the so-called &#8220;Creation&#8221; of the Universe with six causes is just like six men who <strong>HELP </strong><em>(again Moolshankar himself implies that Ishwar needs help of other 5 causes, hence Ishwar is not Omnipresent even according to the proposed definition)</em>each other in putting a thatch on the roof of the house.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">The problem arises from the necessity of at least 3 causes of the Universe which necessitates that Ishwar is Co-equal. As it could be questioned <em>&#8220;Can the making, engineering of Universe be brought about without the material cause or by Ishwar alone&#8221;? </em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Of Course not, this evidently equates Ishwar <em>(Primary Efficient Cause)</em> and other causes as they all are equally important for the engineering of Universe. Hence this proves Ishwar<em>(Primary Efficient Cause)</em> to be Co-equal in work of engineering or making the Universe, with other Causes.</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Lastly, what we&#8217;ve discovered is that according to protestant Hindu theology Ishwar is coequal in Eternity, Uncreated-ness , Beginning-less with <strong>Ātmā </strong><em>(Human Souls) , </em><strong>Prakriti</strong><em>(Primordial matter), </em>also he<em>(Ishwar)</em> is co-equal with time and space in terms of uncreated-ness and eternity. Ishwar <em>(in terms of engineering the universe)</em> also is co-equal with all the causes which bring about the Universe, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">he <em>(Ishwar)</em> may not be totally/Completely equal to his counterparts <em>(Ātm</em></span><em>ā<span style="text-decoration:underline;"> ,Prakriti,time, space…etc)</span></em> but he indeed is equal to them in man<span style="text-decoration:underline;">y terms as proven above.</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">It would be beneficial that we precisely state the Islāmic view point on <strong><em>&#8216;Incomparability&#8217;</em></strong> and <strong><em>&#8216;Coequality&#8217;</em></strong> here, so as to aid the truth-seekers and those of our readers who are interested in learning more about Islām.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Earlier we had presented a verse from the Noble, Holy Qur&#8217;ān [<strong>&#8220;<span style="text-decoration:underline;">There is nothing like Him(Allāh)</span>&#8220;</strong>] which should have made the Islāmic stance very clear with regard to <strong><em>&#8216;Incomparability&#8217;</em></strong> and <strong><em>&#8216;Coequality&#8217;</em>  </strong>but we would like to present another proof which may annihilate any doubt persisting in the minds of our readers. Allāh the Most-Merciful says which means –</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><span style="color:purple;"><strong>&#8220;And there is none coequal or comparable to Him (Allāh).&#8221;</strong></span>                                           – [<span style="color:black;">Soorah al-Ikhlaas , Ayat 4]</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">This Soorah <em>(Chapter)</em> of the Noble, Holy Qur&#8217;ān is known as <span style="color:black;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong><em>at-Tawheed</em></strong></span><br />
<em>(The Oneness of All</em></span><em>āh, His Attributes and Names, – Belief in Absolute Monotheism)</em>, which shows how important it&#8217;s for every monotheist to believe in the <strong><em>&#8216;Incomparability&#8217; </em></strong>and<strong> &#8216;<em>non- Coequality&#8217;</em><br />
</strong>of God.  The famous exegete <span style="color:black;">al-Im</span>ā<span style="color:black;">m, <span style="color:blue;">Imad Ad-Din Isma&#8217;il bin &#8216;Umar bin Kathir<span style="color:black;"> wrote in his Commentary </span><em>Tafsir al-Qur&#8217;ān al-&#8216;Adhim</em></span> commenting on this verse–</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">&#8220;<span style="color:black;">So how can He</span><em>(Allāh)</em><span style="color:black;"> have a peer among His creatures who can be equal to Him, or a relative who can resemble Him Glorified, Exalted and far removed is Allah from such a thing.&#8221;</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">And <span style="color:blue;">Ibn Abi Hātim</span> and <span style="color:blue;">At-Tirmidhî</span> recorded –</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">&#8220;This <em>(Verse)</em> means there is none similar to Him<em> (Allāh)</em>, none equal to Him and there is nothing at all like Him&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">And Ash-Shaykh <span style="color:blue;">&#8216;Abdur-Rahmān ibn Nāsir as-Sa&#8217;dî</span>wrote in <em>&#8216;Tayseer al-Karim-ur-Rahmān Fe Tafseer Kalām Al-Mannān&#8217;</em>–</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">&#8220;There is nothing like Him<em> (Allāh)</em>, in His Names, His Attributes His actions, Blessed and Exalted is He&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">We hope this concise, presentation of Islāmic stance on the issue we are dealing with should quench the thirst of knowledge seekers for now and clear doubts. We learn that Islām calls people to a pure Monotheistic; complete way of life, unlike other &#8216;religions&#8217; which lead them into a pit of darkness. Also we learn how stringently and absolutely Islām is Monotheitic and that protestant Hinduism no where near it. The above verse is explicit and needs not explanation at all; we think this should make the Islāmic point of view evident and clear any misconception of Truth-seekers or our readers, if there.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><strong>b.2.3) <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Is Ishwar a Stealer</span> –</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Does, Ishwar &#8216;steal&#8217;? Or is &#8216;stealing&#8217; one of the characteristics of Ishwar? This is an important issue as this will help our truth-seekers see the reality without any mist or fog, people may have seen numerous of concted claims which aim to debase the Most-High , Most-Merciful Allāh Azz wa Jall by protestant Hindus, in fact their articles are filled with insults directly or indirectly , but our aim here is not to debase or insult anyone <span style="text-decoration:underline;">as this is not from our manners,</span> but our aim is just to bring out the TRUTH, so that people may be guided and made aware of certain facts.So is Ishwar a stealer?</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Well, let Yajurveda answer it, this Veda mentions the following verses- </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">&#8220;Mighty God, through the veda, singing Thy praise, I pray unto Thee. The sacrificer through oblations and praises hankers after Thee. O God worshipped by many, never disrespected, give us in this world your knowledge. <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong><span style="color:red;">Steal </span>not our life</strong>.</span>&#8220;</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">                                                                  – [Yajurveda Chapter 18, Verse 49, pg-198-99 Tr. Devi Chand]</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">&#8220;O Worshipful God, with my prayer, I attain unto Thee through vedic knowledge. A worshipper longs to realise Thee with his oblations. O praiseworthy God, worthy of respect, give us Thy knowledge in this world, <strong><span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;">steal</span><span style="text-decoration:underline;"> not our life from us</span>.&#8221;</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>

</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">We hope the above mentioned verses establish the fact, that according to the Vedas Ishwar is considered as an <strong><em>&#8216;Stealer&#8217; </em></strong>who steals away the life of humans, isn&#8217;t it amazing how Ishwar label&#8217;s himself <em>(according to protestant hindus , Ishwar revelead Vedas)</em><br />
<em>&#8220;Stealer&#8221;</em>. We wonder, what&#8217;s the use of such useless and insulting attribute to be applied to God. Again, human attributes <em>(characterstics)</em> that too negative characterstics are applied to God the Almighty, such an insult of God was never expected from theist, forget those claiming to be monotheists. Vedas are clear here <em>(these are words of Vedas not ours)</em>, that Ishwar is a stealer we need not write more, it is enough for those who truly seek truth. </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><strong>b.2.4) <span style="color:red;">Communion</span> with Ishwar – Polythieism par excellence.</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Have you ever heard that humans can unite with God! Well if not then we welcome you all to learn how to have a union with God as per Moolshankar and his cult.According to Moolshankar humans can unite with God by performing <em>(practicing) <strong>&#8216;<span style="color:black;">Sandhyaopaasanaa&#8217;</span></strong></em>specifically speaking by doing<span style="color:black;"><strong> &#8216;Upaasanaa&#8217;</strong> – Communion.</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">&#8220;The word <strong>upaasanaa </strong>literally means to come close to. All that is required in order to come close to God by the practice of the the Octapartite (eight parts or stages) yoga and directly see the Omnipresent, Omniscient God should be accomplished.&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">By doing <span style="color:black;"><strong>&#8216;Upaasanaa&#8217;</strong>, a man can be united with God! Now let&#8217;s learn how to do &#8216;<strong>&#8216;Upaasanaa&#8217; </strong>in brief.</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:black;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">&#8220;When a man desires to engage in <strong>Upaasanaa </strong>(communion), let him resort to a solitary, clean place and get comfortably seated, practise <strong>Praanaayaama </strong>(control of breath) reatrain the senses from the pursuit of outward objects, <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>fix his mind on <span style="color:red;">one<span style="color:black;"> of the following places</span></span></strong></span>:- <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>the navel, the heart, the throat, eyes, the top of the head or the spine.</em></span> Let him, then, discriminate between his own soul and the Supreme Spirit, get absorbed in contemplation of the latter and commune with Him. When a man follows these practices his mind as well as the soul becomes pure and imbued with righteousness. <span style="color:red;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>His knowledge and wisdom advance day by day till he obtains salvation.</strong></span><span style="color:black;"><br />
<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>He who contemplated the Deity in this way for even one hour out of the twenty-four hours always continues to advance spiritually.&#8221;</strong></span></span></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Above we&#8217;ve seen how to perform communion with God <em>(Ishwar)</em> as per Moolshankar, but did anyone notice something fishy? Yes, we did.One of the benefits of <span style="color:black;"><strong>&#8216;Upaasanaa&#8217; or Communion </strong>with Ishwar is that people performing this communion advance in <strong><em>&#8216;Wisdom&#8217;</em></strong> and <strong><em>&#8216;Knowledge&#8217;</em></strong>!! Reading this we were intimidated to question, so if <strong>&#8216;Upaasanaa&#8217;</strong> can advance people in <strong><em>&#8216;Wisdom&#8217;</em></strong> and <strong><em>&#8216;Knowledge&#8217;</em></strong> as per claims, so can upaasanaa increase the knowledge of people without studying? It&#8217;s for first time; we&#8217;ve heard that just by breathing in and out while concentrating on one of yours of body part like navel you&#8217;ll advance in <strong><em>&#8216;Knowledge&#8217;</em></strong>! <span style="text-decoration:underline;">So will a student appearing for matriculation <em>(10<sup>th</sup>)</em> without studying anything and just by doing upaasanaa pass with the finest marks<em> (first rank)</em>? </span></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Not only this but people attain <strong><em>superhuman psychic power</em></strong> and <strong><em>absolute knowledge</em></strong><br />
<em>(Moolshankar advances his stance from <strong>&#8216;advance in knowledge&#8217;</strong> to <strong>&#8216;absolute knowledge&#8217;</strong>)</em> by doing upaasanaa as stated by Moolshankar – </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">&#8220;The great sage Vyasa holds that when a man attains a beatified state in this life by virtue of <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>direct communion with God and acquisition of superhuman psychic powers and absolute knowledge</strong></span>, he recovers his original pure self and enjoys extreme bliss.&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"> <span style="color:black;">We wonder, if people had just started performing upaasanaa and had not studied, would we humans have reached this stage of scientific development.</span><br />
<span style="color:black;">Obviously, the answer is no, upaasanaa in no way increases a person&#8217;s knowledge as knowledge can only be acquired by study and not just concentrating at your navel or head..Etc! In addition, we think no rational person can believe that just by doing upaasanaa one can attain <strong><em>&#8216;absolute knowledge&#8217; </em></strong>or <strong><em>&#8216;</em></strong></span><strong><em>superhuman psychic powers&#8217;</em></strong>. In fact humans cannot have<strong><br />
<span style="color:black;"><em>&#8216;absolute knowledge&#8217;</em></span></strong> as perfectly complete knowledge is of God and none other. Humans attaining <span style="color:black;"><strong><em>&#8216;absolute knowledge&#8217;</em><br />
</strong>or perfect/ complete knowledge is impossible as this is attributed to God exclusively as God by nature and definition has perfectly complete or absolute knowledge, hence stating that God and humans both have absolute knowledge is equaling God and humans which is polytheism showing anthropomorphic tendencies .  </span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">We hope that this method of increasing or advancing knowledge isn&#8217;t prescribed to scienctist, researcher…etc especially that of our country as we love our country and would love to see it at the pinnacle of scientific developments which is not possible via performing upaasanaa. Here are few verses from Vedas which proudly state this pagan concept.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><strong>Attain to Godhead through Upaasanaa – </strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">The above verse states how one can attain to Godhead! And that is by upaasanaa.There are more such polytheistic verses in the polytheistic Vedas which teach such utter pagan polytheism which is vulgar to monotheists.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">How does being united with God sound to a monotheist? Well, obscenely insulting to God! We as monotheist would like to reprimand and disparage this polytheistic concept where man and God are said to be united! This is polytheism par excellence. Associating man with God is such a filthy idea, but our protestant Hindu brothers/sisters here are not only associating but also uniting him with man.!! Communion and unification of God with man, isn&#8217;t an allegation but an insult to God which no monotheist will ever tolerate, nor do we, hence we ask protestant Hindus to correct their deviated beliefs and seek truth that they may be guided.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Above we read Moolshankar, propogating the pagan polytheistic concept of communion or unification with Ishwar. Look at this hypocritical double-standard nature of protestant Hindus, where accuse orthodox <em>(mainstream)</em> Hindus of polytheism and on the other side themselves are immersed in pure polytheism.This communion where Ishwar and human soul become <strong><em>&#8216;One&#8217;</em></strong> or <strong><em>&#8216;unified&#8217;</em></strong> is pathetic and irrational.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><span style="color:black;">Let us show our readers the incoherency of protestant Hindu theology – according to protestant Hindu theology, <strong>Ishwar is <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>&#8216;inseparably one&#8217;</em></span><br />
</strong>with thefollowing <em>[see the sub-section (</em></span><em>b.3) for the reference and more on the topic]</em><span style="color:black;"> : </span><strong>Ātmā </strong><em>(Human Souls) , </em><strong>Prakriti</strong><em>(Primordial matter)</em><strong>.</strong> If Ishwar is already<em> (inherently)</em> &#8216;<span style="color:black;"><strong><em>&#8216;inseparably one&#8217;</em></strong> with </span>Ātmā, prakriti …etc then what&#8217;s the use of upasanaa? According to protestant Hindu Ishwar is omnipresent, he pervades everything that exists, hence is <em>&#8216;inseparably one&#8217;</em> with everything that exists.So if Ishwar is already united with everything then what&#8217;s the use of Upaasanaa, in any sense? Mooshankar states upaasanaa helps us <strong>&#8216;come<span style="color:black;"> close to God&#8217;</span></strong>.But the rational question is if Ishwar is already pervading everything including humans then why is upasanaa needed, because when both Ishwar and human souls are <span style="color:black;"><strong><em>&#8216;inseparably one&#8217;</em></strong> and <strong><em>&#8216;close&#8217;</em></strong> to each other upaasanaa is useless?</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"> <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Claiming that Ishwar is <strong><em>&#8216;inseparably one&#8217;</em></strong> with everything but still far and away from everything is like stating 1+1 = 2 at first , then claiming 1+1 = 1; is this rational?</span> Only one of the two statements can be true. Either Ishwar pervades everything hence necessarily he is <strong><em>&#8216;inseparably one&#8217;</em></strong> which make them one and there is no more closeness than being <strong><em>&#8216;one&#8217;</em></strong>. Or Ishwar and other entities aren&#8217;t <strong><em>&#8216;inseparably one&#8217;</em></strong> and are not <strong><em>close</em></strong> to each other.Claiming that both the statements are true is logical fallacy and incoherency of protestant Hindu theology.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">And here&#8217;s the logical fallacy found in the Vedas – </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>&#8220;God moves in the eyes of fools.</strong></span> He is motionless. <strong>He is <span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;">far distant</span> from the irreligious and ignorant</strong>, and near the yogis. <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">He is within this entire universe, and surrounds it externally.</span>&#8220;</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">                                    – [Yajurveda Ch 40, verse 5, pg.347 Tr. Devi Chand]</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">The above statement shows the logical incoherency of Vedas and protestant Hindu thelogy, the verse firstly states that God moves in the eyes of the fools, this proves he is near them then goes on to state that God is far distant from the irereligious and ignorant then further states that he is within the entire universe and surrounds it externally.!!What a show of illogicalness, if God <em>(Ishwar) </em>is within entire universe and surrounds it then how can he be <strong><em>&#8216;far distant&#8217;</em></strong> from the irreligious? This is explicitly contradictory as Ishwar due to his omnipresence cannot in any sense be <strong><em>&#8216;far distant&#8217; </em></strong>from anyone his omnipresence necessitate his being <strong><em>&#8216;inseparably one&#8217; </em></strong>and <strong><em>close </em></strong>with everything that exist.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Finally, this concept of <strong><em>&#8216;unification&#8217;</em></strong> or <strong><em>&#8216;communion&#8217;</em></strong> is polytheistic and cannot be fathomed by a rational mind as this is against the general percepts of rationality and logicality. Also this concept preaches polytheism in the vilest form, this <strong><em>&#8216;unification&#8217;</em></strong> or <strong><em>&#8216;communion&#8217;</em><br />
</strong>is nothing but labeled as Shirk <em>[associationism- setting up partners or associating false gods with Allāh(ta&#8217;āla…etc), please refer to Islāmic texts for the complete meaning of Shirk]</em>in Islām and this shirk necessitates <em>(leads) </em>a person to be a polytheist.We think we have amply provided our readers with evidences proving protestant Hinduism to be polytheistic but here&#8217;s the clincher with which we intend to conclude this section(b.2.4).Protestant Hindu pandit Vishnu Lāl wrote –</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><strong>&#8220;Souls tend to <span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;">associate</span> themselves with matter but are free to do so with God.&#8221;</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">We don&#8217;t think there moreexplicit statement that this which admits the associationism <em>(shirk)</em> which necessitates polytheism in protestant Hinduism.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">As we&#8217;ve stated, attributes or characterstics of God are the crux of any theology and people have erred a lot, and few of those who erred are the <strong><em>&#8216;Guru and Chela&#8217;</em></strong><br />
<em>[Moolshankar and Agniveer]</em>. Agniveer exposes his illiteracy in Islām and not only in Islām but also contradicts Moolshankar, did agniveer really read the <em>&#8216;Bible of Hate&#8217; (Satyarth Prakāsh</em>)? Seemingly Agniveer never read the complete Satyarth Prakāsh or why would he contradict Moolshankar.Agniveer commented/wrote in his article<em> (This article of agniveer exposes the novice nature of Agniveer in comparative religion and his total ignorance of Islām, we&#8217;ve would have with pleasure refuted his ignorant and illiterate allegations but this would disturb the flow of this article hence we will prevent ourself from doing so, Inshā&#8217;Allāh his baseless allegations will be refuted soon.)</em> – </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">   <strong>&#8220;<span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;">Sharing attributes</span> with Allah is nothing but <span style="color:red;">Shirk</span>&#8220;</strong> &#8211;</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">                                         – [<a href="http://agniveer.com/3839/islam-the-religion-of-tauheed/" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="color:blue;text-decoration:underline;">http://agniveer.com/3839/islam-the-religion-of-tauheed/</span><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>]</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Though Agniveer does not understand the concept of Shirk, but here he does contradict his own creed by stating that <strong><em>&#8216;Sharing attributes with Allāh&#8217; </em></strong>is <em><strong>&#8216;Shirk&#8217; </strong>(please refer to authentic Islāmic texst for the complete and correct understanding and meaning of Shirk) </em>by which he means<strong><br />
<span style="color:red;">polytheism</span></strong>. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Hence agniveer states that if God shares any of his attributes with humans then that is gross polytheism.</span>But what does Moolshankar state, and is Agniveer a polytheist according to his own words? <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Let us display, how Agniveer clearly states protestant Hinduism to be polytheistic</span>.Moolshankar wrote – </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">31. <strong>God and the soul possess the attributes of Existence, Consciousness and Blissfulness common to each other and are therefore, one. Why do you then refute this belief?</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:black;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">A.-<span style="color:red;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>The fact of two things possessing a few attributes common to each other does not make them one.</strong></span><span style="color:black;">Take for instance, solids and liquids and fire, all these are inanimate and visible but that does not make them one. <strong>The dissimilar attributes differentiate them</strong>. The hardness and prevent them from being considered as one. Or take another illustration. Both a man and an ant see with their eyes, eat with their mouths and walk with their feet, yet they are not one and the same, having their bodily forms different from each other, a man having two feet whilst an ant many, and so on.</span></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">               — [Satyarth Prakash, Ch 7, pg.233, Tr. Chiranjiva Bhardawaja]</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Now coming to the, the confession of Agniveer that protestant Hinduism is polytheistic, according to Agniveer sharing common attributes is polytheism. We think we&#8217;ve shown a lot of common attributes between Ishwar, Ātmā <em>(Human Souls)</em> and Prakriti <em>(Primordial matter),</em> for instance all of them have share identical attributes namely,<strong> Eternal, uncreated, beginning-less</strong> hence according to Agniveer himself, protestant Hindus are polytheist! But amazingly Agniveer conflicts Moolshankar by stating that <strong><em>&#8216;sharing attributes&#8217;</em></strong> means polytheism.Hence Agniveer himself accepts that he is a polytheist <em>(if he believes in protestant Hinduism)</em>.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Now let us come to our stance – we shall make our stance crystal clear; the correct rational belief is thus:</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">·         <span style="text-decoration:underline;">&#8216;Attributing attributes/characterstics <strong><span style="color:red;">identical</span><br />
</strong>to that of human, animal…etc <em>(attributes of creation, or anything unworthy)</em> to God is <strong>polytheism</strong>&#8216;.&#8217;God and humans…etc <em>(creation) </em>cannot have <strong>COMMON</strong><em> (identical)</em> attributes, having common<em> (identical)</em> attributes is pure <strong>polytheism</strong>&#8216;</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">For instance Ishwar has both<strong> identical</strong> and <strong>common</strong><em> (common attributes usually mean identical to some one&#8217;s hence they are called common)</em> attributes to that of Ātmā <em>(Human Souls)</em> and Prakriti <em>(Primordial matter)</em>, namely all share or have attributes eternal, uncreated, and beginning-less, these three attributes are not only identical but also common.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Let us make one thing crystal clear, there is a huge difference between IDENTICAL and SIMILAR <em>(in name only)</em> attributes, God and humans may have attributes similar <em>(in name only)</em> for instance both God and humans have a similar attribute <em>(in name only)</em> called <strong><em>&#8216;existence&#8217;</em></strong>. Both God and humans <strong><em>&#8216;exist&#8217;.</em><br />
<span style="text-decoration:underline;">But the modality of existence of God is <em>unknown</em>, his existence befits his Majesty and Might and is not like our existence</span>, only the name of the attribute is similar. </strong>For example, we all have heard the famous electronic cum computer manufacturing company <strong><em>&#8216;Apple&#8217;</em></strong> so is this <strong><em>&#8216;Apple&#8217;</em></strong> company similar to an <strong><em>&#8216;Apple&#8217;</em></strong><br />
<em>(fruit)</em>? Of course not, only the name is similar. Or is the famous software company <strong><em>&#8216;Oracle&#8217;</em></strong> same to an <em><strong>&#8216;Oracle&#8217;</strong> (an authoritative person who divines the future,a shrine where an oracular god is consulted)? </em>Of course not, they only have similar name and nothing else, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">so the modality of existence of God is unknown and his existence has no comparison/resemblance nor is similar to anything</span> , we hope our readers and truth-seeker&#8217;s remember the sublime, glorious verse from the noble qur&#8217;an which we quoted earlier – </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:purple;font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><strong>                                         &#8220;<span style="text-decoration:underline;">There is nothing like Him(</span>Allāh)&#8221;</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">                                                                                                    – [Soorah Ash- Shura, Ayat 11]</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Any attribute of God cannot be identical to that of any creature nor does God have common attributes with his creature, though he may have attributes with similar name.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Does similarity in attribute name necessitate God and man to be similar?</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Though the question is inherently ridiculously hilarious, as it is well established that similarity in names does not necessitate that God and humans are similar.Nonetheless we&#8217;ll be delving into such ridiculous question in order to make this matter clear for our readers.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Similarity in name <em>(of attributes)</em> in no sense necessitates, that God is similar to the one who&#8217;s name <em>(of attribute)</em> is similar.As the name of attribute of God is Perfect <em>[as God Himself is All-Perfect, also its (name of attribute) divinely revealed and is eternal]</em> where as the name <em>(of attribute)</em> of human…etc<em> [who&#8217;s name (of attribute) is similar]</em> are created not perfect nor are divinely revealed or eternal. Hence God has no resemblance whatsoever with his creature in anything, nor resemblance with any attributes of any creature.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">There are many such rationally proved reasons which prove that similarity in name of attributes does not make two things similar, but we&#8217;ve restricted ourself as this topic is out of the scope, of this article.We hope the matter is clear. We would have written more for the benefit of our readers but this would disturb the flow of our article ,also this topic is out of scope of this article as stated earlier, Inshā&#8217;Allāh we&#8217;ll someday write on this subject too, as time permits us.We&#8217;ve read Agniveer admitting protestant Hinduism being polytheistic; also he contradicts his <strong><em>&#8216;Idol&#8217;</em></strong> named Moolshankar. All these things should be enough for a sincere truth-seeker.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><strong>b.3) <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Protestant Hindu Trinity [<span style="color:red;">Vedic Trinity</span>]</span> –</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><span style="color:black;">As we have seen, that the protestant Hindus <span style="text-decoration:underline;">basically</span> believe in 3 uncreated, eternal, beginning-less, non-destructible entities they are – <strong>Param</strong></span><strong>ā<span style="color:black;">tm</span>ā<span style="color:black;">, Prakriti, </span>Ātmā<span style="color:black;">.</span></strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">And these three are also very important in <em>&#8216;engineering&#8217;</em> or <em>&#8216;making&#8217;</em> the universe as Ishwar<em>(<span style="color:black;">Param</span>ā<span style="color:black;">tm</span>ā<span style="color:black;">)</span></em><br />
<span style="color:black;">is the <strong><em>Primary Efficient Cause</em></strong> whereas Prakriti <em>(Primordial matter)</em> is the <strong><em>Material Cause</em></strong> and </span>Ātmā <em>(Human Souls)</em> is the <strong><em>Secondary Efficient Cause</em></strong>. And these three play an important role in protestant Hindu theology in factuality these are the major role players and everything in protestant Hindu theology revolves around these three entities, and we wonder how come these people label themselves as monotheists? The <strong>&#8216;protestant Hindu trinity&#8217;</strong>, just like everything in Christianity revolves around the Christian concept of trinity <em>(i.e. The Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost/Spirit) </em>everything in protestant Hindu theology revolves around these 3 entities which constitutes to the major part of their creed. The protestant Hindu trinity is made up of –</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">1)<strong> Paramātmā</strong><br />
<em>(Ishwar/God)</em></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">2)<strong> Prakriti</strong><br />
<em>(Primordial matter)</em></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">3)<strong> Ātmā</strong><br />
<em>(Human Souls)</em></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">The above three entities make up the <strong><em>&#8220;Trinitarian Doctrine&#8221;</em></strong> of protestant Hinduism, though not exactly identical to that of Christianity, nonetheless both share the confusing and irrational trinity in theology. According to protestant Hindus Ishwar is <strong><em>&#8220;Father&#8221;</em></strong> of all Humans and other creatures, as stated in Vedas – </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">We learn that Moolshankar<em> (Dayānanda Saraswati)</em> believed Ishwar to be the <strong>Father of all</strong>, and not only Father but <strong>&#8220;Father of Fathers&#8221;</strong> and also the <strong>&#8220;Great-Grandfather&#8221;</strong>. So we again see similarity between the protestant Hindu trinity and the Christian trinity. But does this end here? No not at all, another zealously fanatic protestant Hindu pandit states – </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">&#8220;We have heard it contended by Christian divines that the <span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;"><strong>fatherhood of God</strong></span> and the brotherhood, of man were first preached by Christ. For the benefit of such critics we quote the following mantra from the Rig Veda (I. 6. 16. 10).</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">&#8216;Thou art ever the Imperishable, the self-effulgent, the unchangeable, and the Lord of all! <span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Thou art the mother, the father and the son</strong></span>. Thou art Glorious, Indestructible, the Creator of the five breaths which, support life,! Conscious Brahama, thou art ever manifest, though others (soul and matter) sometimes become imperceptible. Thou art the Creator of the universe!&#8217;</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Other mantras in which the <span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;"><strong>fatherhood of God</strong></span> is specifically mentioned are, Rig Veda (1. 1.9) ; Yajur (Veda III. 24; XVII. 17; XVII. 27; XXXII. 10).&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Amazingly, not only Ishwar is <strong><em>Father</em></strong>, but also the <strong><em>mother</em></strong> and also the <strong><em>Son</em></strong> ,now this really is interesting!  Ishwar seems to be really multi-faceted entity, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">its evident how protestant Hindus are trying hard to match-up with so-called Christian concepts of &#8216;peace&#8217; &#8216;Fatherhod&#8217; and &#8216;brotherhood&#8217;</span>. But in doing so they have erred gravely and exposed their incoherent <em>&#8216;conceptualization&#8217;</em> and understanding of God. </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">The problem with <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Christianity is their claim of God being 3 different entities still is 1</span>, it&#8217;s something similar to protestant Hindu theology, where the 3 entities are eternal, uncreated and beginning-less still only Ishwar has the right to be God or is known as God and the other 2<em>(entities i.e. Ātmā and Prakriti)</em> aren&#8217;t, while the other 2 entities have a large amount of action and role to play<em>(if not equal)</em> also Ishwar is totally dependent on these two for nearly everything right from engineering the universe to giving &#8216;bliss&#8217; to the human souls<em>(on Moksha)</em>. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">We read that Ishwar is – Father of Fathers, Great-Grandfather, Father, Mother and the Son<em> (a step ahead of Christian dogmas)</em></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">It would be a beneficial to note another important point which we&#8217;ve been stressing and proving since the beginning of this article cum treatise, is the anthropomorphic tendencies of protestant Hinduism, again here they expose how greatly they view God in human framework or conceptualize God in human-resembling manner. Above protestant Hindus are zealously eager to prove that their god Ishwar is the paragon of <strong><em>&#8220;Fatherhood&#8221;</em></strong> through which they aim to prove their god is loving like a <em>&#8220;Father&#8221;</em> and that this concept of <em>&#8220;Fatherly love&#8221; </em>was present in the Vedas even before the existence of Bible, but in doing so they follow the Christian and anthropomorphize God and resemble His relation with His creatures similar to that of Human bonds and relationship. What the protestant Hindus don&#8217;t realize, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">is that the relation of man and God is way too pure, spiritual and higher than that of man with his Father, mother or Son</span>. And it would be a great oppression against humanity, asceticism and spirituality on the part of protestant Hinduism to undermine and debase the pure relation of man with God by resembling and equaling it with human relationships. Concluding the paragraph, we learn that Ishwar is – The Father [<em>and relations like (Son, Mother, Great-grand Father), Humans have]</em> in the protestant Hindu trinity.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">In order to strengthen the proofs of our statements here&#8217;s some more evidences, where the relation between God and Humans is identified and resembled with that relationships between humans.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Above quoted statement <em>(pg.225)</em> of <em>&#8216;pandit&#8217;</em> Moolshankar <em>(Dayānanda Saraswati),</em> explicitly defines the relation between <strong>Ātmā</strong> (<em>Humans Souls)</em> and <strong>Ishwar </strong><em>(protestant Hindu god),</em> like that of the Father and the Son! Other instances of the relation between God and Soul provided by Mooshankar seem to be fine, like <em>&#8216;<span style="color:black;">the Ruler and the ruled&#8217;</span></em><br />
<span style="color:black;"><em>[God is the Ultimate Ruler and rules over everything]</em>, <em>&#8216;Master and the servant&#8217;</em>, &#8216;served and the servitor&#8217;, &#8216;the supporter and the supported&#8217;, all these instances are fine as they don&#8217;t debase the relationship of God to mere Human relations like that of the &#8216;Father and Son&#8217;. </span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><span style="color:black;">And in the quote from pg.<em> (205, above the quote of pg.225)</em> &#8216;pandit&#8217; Moolshankar </span><em>(Dayānanda Saraswati) </em>wrote <em>&#8220;</em><span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Let all men look up to me alone as children do to their parents&#8221;</strong></span> what more evidence would a unbiased person need to acknowledge the fact that protestant Hinduism debases and undermines the pure relation between God and man with that of <em>&#8216;Father/Mother and the Son&#8217;</em>. It&#8217;s to be noted that the relation between a mother and a son or the father and son is very important and high amongst humans, also should be respected highly but resembling the relation between God and humans to that of human bonds/relationships is a fatal error which would lead to the corruption and undermining spirituality.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">The trinitarian doctrine of protestant Hindus is confusing and incoherent to a rational mind; it is far removed from being anywhere near to rationality. Christians claims their &#8216;concept of triune&#8217; to be monotheistic so is the claim of protestant Hinduism with different variables and few constants. </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">In Christianity, the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit are 3 different/distinct entities, still they are not 3 Gods but they are 1 God. Something similar in essence is propounded by, Moolshankar<em> (Dayānanda Saraswati)</em> –</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:black;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">&#8220;<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>God and the soul are two <span style="color:red;">distinct<span style="color:black;"> entities</span></span></strong></span> by virtue of being different in nature and of being possessed of dissimilar attributes and characteristics. <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>They are, however, <span style="color:red;">inseparable one<span style="color:black;"> from the other,</span></span></strong></span> being related to each other as the <strong>pervader </strong>and the <strong>pervaded </strong>and have <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>certain attributes in common.</strong></span> Just as a material object has always been and shall always be, distinct from the space in which it exists and as the two have never been, <span style="color:red;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>nor shall ever be one and the same<span style="color:black;">, even so are God and the soul to each other.</span></strong></span> Their mutual relation is that of the pervader and the pervaded, of father and son and the like.</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><span style="color:black;">Also, Moolshankar</span><em> (Dayānanda Saraswati)</em><span style="color:black;">wrote,</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">&#8220;It is only because He is even more subtle than the soul and the prakriti, and pervades them, that He can grasp them and transform them into this visible universe.&#8221; </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><span style="color:black;">As can be read above, according to Moolshankar</span><em>(Dayānanda Saraswati)</em><span style="color:black;"> , Ishwar is the subtlest of the 3 entities and pervades all. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">All the 3 entities are distinct but still are inseparable</span>, seem to be using some sought of glue! As per protestant Hindu theology , the 3 eternal , uncreated, beginning-less entities <em>(i.e Ishwar,Prakriti and </em></span><em>Ātmā) </em>are distinct but are <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>&#8216;inseparable one&#8217;</strong></span>, which simply means and that they are –Ishwar, <span style="color:black;">Prakriti and </span>Ātma, <strong>&#8216;DISTINCT&#8217;</strong>  but are <strong>&#8216;NOT SEPRATE&#8217;</strong>. So what does this mean? Moolshankar is trying to teach us two things –</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:black;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><strong>1)</strong>      &#8220;<span style="text-decoration:underline;">They<em> [2 entities] </em>are, however<strong>, <span style="color:red;">inseparable one</span></strong><span style="color:black;">from the other<strong>&#8220;</strong></span></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:black;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><strong>2)</strong>     <strong>&#8220;</strong>Just as a material object has always been and shall always be, distinct from the space in which it exists and as the two have never been, <span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;"><strong>nor shall ever be one and the same<span style="color:black;">, even so are God and the soul to each other.&#8221;</span></strong></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><span style="color:black;">Moolshankar claims Ishwar <em>and </em></span>Ātmā to be <strong>&#8216;insperable one&#8217; </strong>but further goes on claiming that Ishwar and human souls (<em>Ātmā)</em> cannot become ONE and the same. What he&#8217;s trying to imply is that Ishwar and human souls (<em>Ātmā)</em> are distinct/different entities with few similar attributes that cannot be divided/parted/disjoined or separated, but they are not the same. </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><span style="color:black;">After reading the meanings, I guess the matter will be more clear, and our readers will understand, Moolshankar is trying to state that Ishwar is different not like Humans souls except few common attributes , but they are <strong><em>&#8216;inseparably one&#8217;</em><br />
</strong>meaning joined and cannot be divided , which ultimately leads us to the conclusion – <span style="text-decoration:underline;">They<em>[Ishwar,Prakriti,</em></span></span><em><span style="text-decoration:underline;"> Ātm</span>ā<span style="text-decoration:underline;">] </span></em>are one with many different attributes among which some are common and identical to all three<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>[ like earlier proved all three have identical eternity, uncreated-ness, beginning-less-ness<span style="color:black;">, commonly shared which make them co-equal in that attributes.]</span></em></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><span style="color:black;">This is something close and similar to the Christian concept of <strong>&#8216;triune&#8217;</strong>. 3 different entities but still One <em>(or 3 in 1)</em>, same here with a minor difference <em>&#8216;3 different&#8217;</em> entities<em> (as Ishwar pervades everything including Prakriti)</em> but are <strong>&#8216;<span style="text-decoration:underline;">inseparable one</span>&#8216;</strong> or <strong><em>joined/undivided</em></strong>. Irrational and illogical concept also very lowly to a mind of monotheist, who believes in perfect Uniqueness of God. This issue needs a detail exposure, but unfortunately presently it&#8217;s beyond the scope of the article, Insh</span>ā&#8217;Allāh, we&#8217;ll expound in it in greater detail later, as time permits, but briefly it&#8217;s a gross violation of Monotheism.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><span style="color:black;">The above belief is labeled as <strong><em>&#8220;Shirk&#8221;</em></strong> in Isl</span>ā<span style="color:black;">m or <strong><em>&#8220;Associationism&#8221;</em></strong>, above Moolshankar adamantly states God and humans souls to be &#8216;inseparable one&#8217; which is pure instance of polytheism. Here he adjoins and associates, Human Souls to God, which is superfluously polytheism. Such a belief can hardly be recognized as <em>&#8220;Monotheistic&#8221;</em>, in-fact this is more than polytheism it can be better labeled as <em>&#8220;Polytheism&#8221;.</em> It&#8217;s irrational even to think of such bizarre belief, where God is <strong>JOINED/ UNITED</strong> and cannot separate himself from other things.</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;text-decoration:underline;"><strong>We would, here like to shed light upon, the double-standards and hypocritical nature of protestant Hindus,</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><strong><span style="color:#ff9900;">Agniveer</span>,</strong> the Islāmophobe and hate-monger wrote – </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Not only this, <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Vedas also <span style="color:red;">refuse existence of any</span> angel or <span style="color:red;">Prophet or</span> incarnation who is necessarily required to act as an <span style="color:red;">agent</span> between You and Ishwar.</strong></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">To give a rough analogy:</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Ishwar of Vedas = God of Christianity minus the concept of Trinity minus the necessity to surrender to Jesus</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Ishwar of Vedas = Allah of Islam minus the necessity to accept Muhammad as final Prophet.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">In other words, If someone says first part of Shahada : <em>lâ ilâha illallâh</em> (There is no other God except one and only Allah) <span style="color:red;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>but rejects the second part</strong></span> : </span><em>Muhammadur rasûlullâh</em> (Muhammad is his messenger), that is close to concept of Vedic God.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;text-decoration:underline;"><strong>In Islam, it is <span style="color:red;">Shirk or greatest sin</span> to worship anything except Allah. If you take this concept further and also refuse to accept any Muhammad or Gabriel as necessary to be remembered apart from Allah, you are avoiding Shirk as per Vedas.</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">The first, delusion we see is the claim that Vedas refuse to acknowledge any <em>&#8216;Prophet&#8217; </em>&#8220;who is necessarily required to act as an agent between You and Ishwar&#8221;. The thing that amazes us, the most, is this person&#8217;s confident lies <em>(though being white lies)</em> and misinterpretations of religious texts of Islām.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">It&#8217;s totally wrong, absurd and misleading that, Vedas don&#8217;t have <strong><em>&#8216;Agents&#8217;</em></strong>, to prove it let&#8217;s go to the inventor of this protestant Hindu cult, that&#8217;s Moolshankar and he wrote – </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:black;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">A.-&#8220;<span style="color:red;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">In the beginning, God revealed the four Vedas, Rig, Vayu, Sama, and Atharva, to Agni, Vayu, A&#8217;ditya and Angira, respectively.</span><span style="color:black;">&#8221; SHAPATHA BRAHMAN 11: 4,2.3. </span></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><strong>Q. But it is written in the Shwetashwetar Upanishad, &#8220;In the beginning God created Brahma and revealed the Vedas in his heart.&#8221;SHEWTAR UPANISHAD 6:18. Why do you say that they were revealed to Agni, and other sages? </strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><strong>A.</strong> – Brahma was instructed in the knowledge of the Veda <span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;"><strong>through the medium of the four sages</strong></span>, such as Agni. Mark what Manu Says:</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"> &#8220;In the beginning after human being had been created, the Supreme Spirit made the Vedas known to Brahma through Agni, etc., i.e., Brahma learnt the four Vedas from Agni, Vayu, A&#8217;ditya and Angira.&#8221; MANU: 23 </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><strong>Q. To whose mind and at what time did God reveal the Vedas ?</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><strong>A <span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;">&#8211;</span></strong> In the beginning of the creition God revealed a Veda to the soul of <span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;">each of the four sages, called Agni, Vayu, Adittya, and Angira…</span>God caused them communicated through Agni and others to the mind of Brahma. See what Manu says, I. 23,</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">In the beginning the Great God, having made men, blessed Brahma with the four Vedas through the four sages, called Agni and others Brahma received the Rig, Yajur, Sanaa and Atharva Vedas from Agni Vayu, Aditya, and Angira.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">                                 – [Satyrath Prakash Ch 7, pg.229 Tr. Durga Prasad]</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">What we have seen is that protestant Hindu god <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Ishwar revealed Vedas to <strong>four Rishis</strong></span><br />
<span style="text-decoration:underline;">and through them Brahma learnt these Vedas, so what does this mean</span>? It&#8217;s clear that here these <strong><em>&#8220;Rishis&#8221;</em></strong> are nothing but some sought of <strong><em>&#8216;Prophets&#8217; (or may be &#8216;Agents&#8217;)</em></strong>. And it&#8217;s amazing to see that Agniveer wrote – </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:black;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"> <span style="color:red;">&#8220;<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Vedas also refuse existence </strong></span>of any angel or <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Prophet</strong></span> or incarnation <span style="text-decoration:underline;">who is necessarily required to act as <strong>an agent between You and Ishwar</strong></span>.&#8221;</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">So again here Agniveer&#8217;s claim, of Vedas refusing to believe the existence of <em>&#8216;Prophets'(or so-called Agents)</em> is refuted by his own leader&#8217;s and his own belief <em>(we think he is a protestant Hindu isn&#8217;t he, hence blind-following of Moolshankar is obligatory on him isn&#8217;t it?Thats what they are taught!)</em>. The meaning of Rishis <em>(here -as used by Moolshankar)</em> is in fact is quite similar, to the notion of a Prophet and we also read above that<strong><em>&#8216;through the medium of the four Rishis&#8217;</em></strong> Brahma was instructed the knowledge of Vedas. So this simply proves how the four Rishis acted as <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>&#8216;Agents&#8217;</strong></span> between Brahma and Ishwar, and in fact all the others<em>( excluding the four Rishis) </em>learnt the knowledge of Vedas via these four Rishis , hence it&#8217;s evident that these Rishis are mere <strong><em>Agents</em></strong> between Ishwar and people. Somewhat <em>(to an extent)</em> similar to, the Prophets conveyed the message and knowledge of Divine Inspiration and revelation so did the rishis do.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Hence, the claim made by Agniveer, of Vedas refusing to accept an agent or prophet is contradictory to Agniveer&#8217;s own creed! We think it&#8217;s pretty much apparent that protestant Hindu&#8217;s have 4 agents from whom they understood Vedas. Now coming to a question of similar nature asked by the master<em> (swāmi)</em> of Agniveer – Moolshankar.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Moolshankar wrote – </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><strong>53. &#8220;Nor is God minded to lay open the secret thing to you but God chooseth what he will of his apostles to know them. Believe therefore, in God and his apostles.&#8221; (3:174) </strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">C. ~ <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Why does this verse inculcate faith in Mohammad along with that in God,</strong></span> when the Mohammedans process to believe in none but God, and hold that none is worthy of sharing homage with Him? Hence they cannot call God Incomparable. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">If it be argued that this verse only teaches that people should have faith in Mohammad as a Prophet, we should like to know where is the necessity of Mohammad (being regarded as a Prophet).</span> If God cannot accomplish His desired object without making him His Prophet, He is certainly powerless.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">                                                       &#8211; [Satyarth Prakash, Ch14, pg.673 Tr.Chiranjiva Bhardawaja]</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Well, we&#8217;ve proved, that Vedas have the concept of <em>&#8216;agents&#8217;</em> and something similar is being questioned by Moolshankar , but firstly its to be noted that Moolshankar has misquoted the Holy, Noble Qur&#8217;ān, here the Ayat quoted <em>(3:174)</em> by Moolshankar is provided , and it in no way matches with that of Moolshankar&#8217;s citation. Here&#8217;s the Ayat as per the reference provided by Moolshankar.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Right translation of interpretation of meaning of the Ayat reference provided –</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:purple;font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">&#8220;So, they returned with grace and bounty from Allāh. No harm touched them; and they followed the good Pleasure of Allāh. And Allāh is the Owner of Great Bounty.&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">                                                          -[ <span style="color:black;">Soorah Aal-&#8216;Imraan(3), Ayat 174]</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"> This is typical of protestant Hindus including the likes of Agniveer, who often misquote, misinterpret and provide unknown-faulty translation of Islāmic texts.Nonetheless, here we shall answer the silly objections raised by Moolshankar, despite of the fact that we do not have the correct reference, but have understood the basic objection. Moolshankar here is trying to question the belief in Prophets held by Muslims. So why do Muslims believe in Prophets<em> (&#8216;Alayhimus Salām)?</em> The questioned can be simply answered by another question. <em>&#8220;Why do protestant Hindus believe in the 4 rishis&#8221;,</em> why do they not reject these rishis? Of course, because it was to them, the Vedas were revealed as per protestant Hindu theology.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Now answering the question of Agniveer and Moolshankar which is better articulated by Agniveer, he wrote<em> (earlier full source is provided, see above) – </em></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">&#8220;Ishwar of Vedas = Allah of Islam minus the necessity to accept Muhammad as final Prophet.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">In other words, If someone says first part of Shahada : <em>lâ ilâha illallâh</em> (There is no other God except one and only Allah) <span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;"><strong>but rejects the second part</strong></span> : <em>Muhammadur rasûlullâh</em> (Muhammad is his messenger), that is close to concept of Vedic God.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>In Islam, it is <span style="color:red;">Shirk or greatest sin</span> to worship anything except Allah. If you take this concept further and <span style="color:red;">also refuse to accept any Muhammad or Gabriel </span>as necessary to be remembered apart from Allah, <span style="color:red;">you are avoiding Shirk as per Vedas</span>.</strong></span>&#8220;</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Let us teach Agniveer some basics of Islām, his illiteracy of Islām is apparent and is disgusting that such a person is criticising Islām, who does not even know nick about Islām. Nonetheless, let us educate him. Firstly, this illiterate does not even know what the shahādatayn<em> (loosely, &#8216;testimony of faith&#8217;)</em> means! Before going further let me provide our readers with correct meaning of <em>&#8216;Shirk&#8217;</em> in Islām, Agniveer clearly lack basic comprehension of Islām, hence has stated, &#8220;<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">In Islam, it is <span style="color:red;">Shirk or greatest sin</span></span>&#8220;. &#8216;Shirk&#8217;</strong> does not literally mean <strong>&#8220;Greatest Sin&#8221;</strong> as stated by Agniveer.<strong> &#8216;Shirk&#8217;</strong> to state in a very concise set of words <em>(loosely)</em>, means <span style="color:red;"><strong>&#8220;Assocationism&#8221;</strong></span> or <span style="color:red;"><strong><em>&#8220;Associating or setting up partners with All<span style="color:#ff6600;">ā<span style="color:red;">h&#8221;</span></span></em></strong> as done by protestant Hinduism. Hence, </span><strong><em>&#8216;Shirk&#8217;</em></strong> is an act that&#8217;s considered the evilest and greatest sin, which takes you out of the fold of Islām.<em>[Please refer to Islāmic texts to comprehend the correct meaning of Shirk , as explaining it in detail here is out of the scope of this article]</em></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"> Expounding on <strong>Shahādatayn</strong>, in brief (there could be volumes written) –</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">That none has the right to be worshiped and deified except Allāh, the only one Almighty true God. It is the belief and affirmation no one deserves to be worshipped except Allāh , it&#8217;s obligation and action upon it.So <strong>&#8216;<em>Lā ilāha&#8217;</em></strong><em> negates anyone besides Allāh deserving of worship no matter who it is.And <strong>&#8216;illallāh&#8217;</strong> affirms the fact that only Allāh has right to be worshipped and derserves to be worshipped.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;text-decoration:underline;"><strong><em>Lā ilāha illallāh, has 2 pillars- Which are :</em></strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><strong>Lā ilāha</strong>, <span style="color:red;">negates </span>all the types of shirk, and neccissitates in disbelieving in everything, that is worshipped besides Allāh.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Here are few scholar&#8217;s who expounded on it, <em>(We&#8217;ll quote them in brief)</em> –</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><strong>Ash-Shaykh al-Islām al-Imām <span style="color:blue;">Ibn Taymiyyah</span><br />

</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><strong>Al-Imām <span style="color:blue;">al-Qurtubee</span></strong> wrote – <span style="text-decoration:underline;">&#8220;<em><strong>Lā ilāha illallāh </strong>: </em>That there is none other worthy of worship besidesAllāh</span>&#8220;</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><strong>Al-Imām al-Hāfidh <span style="color:blue;">al-Hakamee</span></strong> wrote – <span style="text-decoration:underline;">&#8220;So the meaning of <strong>Lāilāhaillallāh<em> is : There is no deity worthy of worship in truth , besides Allah </em>(lā Ma&#8217;bood bi haqq illallāh)</strong></span><strong>&#8220;</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><strong>Hence anyone who basically knows what<em> &#8216;</em>Lā ilāha illallāh&#8217; means, would not indulge in such silly and incoherent question as done by the &#8216;Guru and Chela&#8217; <em>(Moolshankar and Agniveer)</em>.</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Now coming to the second part of the <strong>Shahādatayn </strong>that is<strong> – </strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">&#8216;<strong>Muhammadur rasūlullāh<em>&#8216;</em></strong></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"> This part itself is a proof that the <strong>Shahādah </strong>does not contain anything near to shirk! We think that the this part makes it crystal clear that <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Muhammad is the Messenger of Allāh</span> and this indirectly refutes those who claimed prophets to be children of God or incarnate of God hence this part is a refutation and rebuking against the polythiestic nature of those who made man God, and nowhere does it associate man and God.Now lets expound briefly on this part of <strong>Shahādatayn. </strong>This is the inward and outward recognition of the fact that<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>&#8216;Muhammad</strong></span><em> (sal-Allāhu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam)</em><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;"> is the Slave and Messenger of All</span>ā<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h to all the people ,who&#8217;s to be followed&#8217;.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><strong>These Ayaat, clearly refute the silly, useless objection and claims raised by those who are incompetent in Islām.The verses state, that Muhammad</strong><em> (sal-Allāhu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam)</em><strong>is mere a man like all of us , and upon him was the holy, divine , noble Qur&#8217;ān revealed.This verse clearly states Muhammad the prophet of Mercy</strong><em> (sal-Allāhu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam), </em>to be a Man<em>(Slave and Messenger)</em> who&#8217;s been honored by his Sole Creator , the only one True God, by revealing to him<em>(Muhammad)</em> the noble Qur&#8217;ān and elevating him to a certain degree<em>(in honor)</em>.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">We see how the noble Prophet claimed to be a mere <em>&#8216;Slave&#8217;</em> of Allāh and also forbade people from &#8216;exaggerating&#8217; or adulating him like the Christians did to Jesus and made him a god! Like the Hindus<em>(orthodox)</em> make anyone who claims to be a <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>&#8216;incarnate of God&#8217;</em></span> a God.There should be no more objection or silly conjectures as this is totally enough even for dummies to understand the Islāmic stance on Prophets.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"> We think by now, it should be clear that the <strong>&#8216;Shahādatayn&#8217;</strong> does not associate <strong>&#8216;Muhammad&#8217;</strong><em> (sal-Allāhu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam)</em>to Allāh Azz wa Jall in fact it disassociates Muhammad from divinity, exaggeration and makes him a mere slave and messenger of the only one true Almighty God, to all the Humanity.And in factuality the <strong>&#8216;Shahādatayn&#8217; </strong>itself is proof of monotheistic nature of Islām.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><span style="color:#ff9900;"><strong>Agniveer</strong></span>the Hate-monger wrote – </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">&#8220;<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>If you take this concept further and <span style="color:red;">also refuse to accept any Muhammad or Gabriel </span>as necessary to be remembered apart from Allah, <span style="color:red;">you are avoiding Shirk as per Vedas</span>.</strong></span>&#8220;</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Poor agniveer, here explicitly humilates himself by exposing his , total ignorance of Islām and even of minor concepts of it <em>(Isl</em>ā<em>m)</em>.Firstly, Vedas nowhere teach the sublime and truthful concept of Shirk<em>(denouncing,rejection,censuring of Shirk)</em> in-fact Vedas are <strong><em>&#8216;Book of Polytheism&#8217;</em></strong> who have taught polytheism ,wearing the garb of monotheistic book <em>(as per protestant Hinduism)</em>.We&#8217;ve seen many instance of such polytheism advocated by Vedas in the preceding sub-sections.Any intelligent man ,after reading the above words of agniveer would be forced to question himself- <strong><em>&#8220;How come remembering God and his &#8220;Slave and Messenger&#8221; constitute to Shirk?&#8221;</em></strong>Such incompetent and logically devoid question, stemmed only due to the ignorance of Islāmic concepts on the part of protestant Hindus.Also such belief <em>(so-called &#8216;remembering&#8217; of Muhammad as a messenger and slave of Allāh)</em> is hilariously irrational, how can remembering God and stating a Human to be his slave and Messenger make upto shirk? If this is the belief of protestant Hindus then just by saying <em>&#8220;Oh! How perfectly did God make humans&#8221;</em> would make people polytheist isn&#8217;t it? God and humans are remembered together here!! Hilarious!! O you protestant Hindus go and learn the meaning of Shirk and the basic concepts of Islām, then talk, as your ignorance will only humiliate you before the entire world.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Now, coming to a similar question asked by Moolshankar- </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">&#8220;<span style="color:black;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">If it be argued that this verse only teaches that people should have faith in Mohammad as a Prophet, we should like to know where is the necessity of Mohammad (being regarded as a Prophet).</span> If God cannot accomplish His desired object without making him His Prophet, He is certainly powerless.&#8221;</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Well, this silly conjecture or at-most objection can be answered by simply asking <strong><em>&#8216;Why does protestant Hinduism inculcate faith in the 4 &#8216;rishis to be seers to whom Vedas were revealed</em></strong>? Why don&#8217;t the protestant Hindus reject these rishis?  Or believe as many Hindus believe Vedas to be the the work of these rishis? We think many would have received the answer by now, but still to make it clear, we&#8217;ll concisely state reasons why it is a necessity for Muhammad<em>(sal-Allāhu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam)</em> being regarded as a Prophet.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">1)      <strong>Because, the holy, Noble Qur&#8217;ān was revealed to Muhammad</strong><em>(sal-Allāhu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam)</em><strong>, which necessitates him to be the Messenger</strong>.It&#8217;s foolish to pose such a question <em>(i.e. &#8220;<span style="color:black;">where is the necessity of Mohammad (being regarded as a Prophet&#8221;)</span></em>.It&#8217;s clearly established that the o<span style="color:black;">ne who receives the &#8216;revelation&#8217; from God is a Prophet/Messenger! So where&#8217;s the necessity to ask such a silly question? We think that Moolshankar did not even comprehend the meaning of <em>&#8216;Messenger&#8217;</em> or what intelligent person would ask such a question? </span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">2)      <strong>Believing in the Messenger-ship <em>(or Prophethood)</em> of Muhammad</strong><em> (sal-Allāhu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam)</em><strong>is necessary as this proves that he is a mere <em>&#8216;Slave&#8217;</em> and <em>&#8216;Messenger&#8217;</em> of Allāh also this is a helps stop people making Muhammad as an &#8216;<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Avatār</span>&#8216; of God, like in Hinduism every other reformer<em>(this was with reformers , just thing what they may have done with Messengers</em>) is made an incarnate of God.This acts as an repellent against those who seek to apply <em>&#8216;divinity&#8217;</em> to the prophets or Messengers.</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><strong>3)</strong>      <strong>The belief or faith in a messenger is a necessary part, because without believing a person to be a messenger how can one believe in the book or inspiration/revelation he&#8217;s received, for instance , why do protestant hindus believe in the 4 people to be rishis to whom the vedas were revealed? Why just not believe in the vedas<em> (while rejecting the rishis)</em>? Is not such question foolishly hilarious? It is just like believing in<em> (the truth of)</em> a news flashed on news channel, while maintaining the news channel to be <span style="text-decoration:underline;">always </span>spreading false and fake news.</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><strong>The answer is simple, disbelieving in the messengership of a messenger also necessitates disbelieve in the revelation he has been provided with. Hence if protestant Hindus were to disbelieve that the vedas were revealed to the four rishis, they would be rejecting the vedas, as how can a rational person believe in the revealtion of a messenger and reject him? Hence, the protestant Hindus believe in the four rishis. Thus, disbelief in a messenger necessitates disbelief in the revealtion he has come with.</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">There are numerous reasons and points which could be stated here but for the sake of brevity we&#8217;ve stated only a few.The above silly question , evidently exposes the credentials of Moolshankar, we wonder how can such a person be labeled <em>&#8220;<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Maharishi</span>&#8220;</em> by his blind-follwers who could not even grasp easy concepts like such , and posed such ridiculously baseless question.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Lastly, Moolshankar again exposing his irrational mind wrote – </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">&#8220;If God cannot accomplish His desired object without making him His Prophet, He is certainly powerless.&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">We&#8217;ve seen who&#8217;s powerless and who&#8217;s not in the sub-section of Ishwar being Omnipotent or not.Above statement of Moolshankar is just like stating that <em>&#8220;</em><span style="color:black;">If Ishwar cannot accomplish His desired object without making him the 4 people his rishis, He is certainly powerless</span><em>&#8220;</em> So is this true, protestant hindus? Well, the answer will be in negative. Therefore, why this double-standard.The answer to Moolshankar&#8217;s defunct question is <em>&#8220;God does what He wills&#8221; (The perrogative belongs to Him alone)</em> and it is the humans who need Prophets and Messengers so that they may be guided not God.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Now coming to one of the reasons for debunking this conjecture or useless-objections of Agniveer and Moolshankar was to show their double standards and hypocricy.We included the refutation of the conjectures, in this subsection for this particular reason, so that people may see the true face of these quacks and ignobles claiming to be Scholars and nobles. We left our reader with the bizzare and absurd belief of Ishwar,Ātma and Prakriti being <strong><em>&#8216;inseparably one&#8217;</em></strong> or JOINED, UNDIVIDED.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Here we can see the double standards and hyocricy of Moolshankar and protestant Hindu who criticize Islām, for the Shahādatayn containing the mention of Prophet Muhammad, and stating it to be &#8216;Shirk'(poor polemics don&#8217;t even know the meaning of &#8216;shirk&#8217;), which has been totally debunked. But what of Protestant Hinduism? They <strong><em>adjoin</em></strong>Ātmā, Prakriti to Ishwar stating them to be &#8216;<strong><em>inseparably one&#8217; </em></strong>still claim to be &#8216;monotheist&#8217;! We would like to question what can this be called? If just the mere mention of Prophet Muhammad as being the slave and Messenger of Allāh, is polytheism <em>(as claimed),</em> then what would they label this belief of theirs? Well this is pure polytheism where God <em>(whom they call Ishwar)</em> is JOINED to Ātmā, prakriti and is <strong><em>&#8216;inseparably one&#8217;</em></strong>.We wonder who taught Moolshankar and his blind-followers the meaning of <em>&#8220;Monotheism&#8221;</em>.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">This <span style="color:red;"><strong><em>&#8216;unification&#8217;</em></strong></span> of the three eternal entities <em>[Paramātmā (Ishwar), Ātmā, Prakriti]</em> is purely an instance of Shirk or associationism, and this theory of unification is stated in Vedas – </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>&#8220;Let thy soul be <span style="color:red;">united</span> with God</strong></span>.

</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">There are plently of verses<em>(see the sub-section b.2.4 for more about this polytheistic concept)</em> exposing this polytheistic doctrine of unification of God and Human souls in vedas, but we&#8217;ve resorted to only two as these are satisfactorily enough to expose this vilest form of polytheism, in fact it&#8217;s no less than pantheism.The verses claim unification of God and human souls.Now may we ask, if the mere utterance of name of prophet Muhammad as the slave and messenger of Allāh the Almighty, in Shahādatayn is polytheism as per protestant Hindus then what would this <strong><em>&#8216;<span style="text-decoration:underline;">unification</span>&#8216;</em></strong> of God <em>(Ishwar – Paramātmā)</em> and Human Souls (<em>Ātmā)</em> be labeled as? Well, the answer is simple and outrightly evident; this is nothing but pure <span style="text-decoration:underline;">polytheism</span> under guise of monotheism. Let us provide another instance of pure and outright exclamation of associationism (Shirk) which necessitates polytheism by the protestant Hindu pandit-scholar – </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">This is pure polytheism, where <em>Ātmā</em> is associated or set up as a partner to God! Isn&#8217;t this enough for true, sincere truth-seeker? We think there can be no more explicit statement then this though there are many such statements available in the works of protestant Hindu scholars.So may we ask Agniveer <em>&#8216;What is this&#8217;</em>? This is nothing more than pure polytheism.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Christianity and protestant Hinduism both have three different, distinct entities, but are one <em>(&#8216;inseparably one&#8217; according to protestant Hindus)</em>. Both the concepts be it chrisitian or protestant Hinduism both constitute to <em>&#8220;polytheism&#8221;</em> as both associate , 2 entities to God <em>(if not more)</em> and claim that they are one. Both these denominations, believe all the three entities to be distinct and different still to be one in the case of protestant Hinduism <strong><em>&#8216;inseparably one&#8217;</em></strong>. Though there are differences in this concept, in essence it is same. This concept is a violation and insult to monotheism, which takes these belief systems out of the fold of monotheism.Both even are similar in claiming monotheism , both claim to be monotheistic in nature . However, the problematic issue is that none of the two stands true to the test of monotheism.So in essence the Christian trinity is not different from the protestant Hindu trinity<em> (Vedic Trinity)</em>, both share the same belief of 3 different entities being inseparably one, give or take few issues. The basic framework of thining about god in both chrisitianity and protestant Hinduism is same.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">In essence, protestant Hinduism is similar to Christianity. It&#8217;s widely accepted by many academicians, scholars and even orthodox Hindus that Protestant Hinduism has been inspired by Christians and has adapted/edited Hindu beliefs in order to respond to Christians by making Hinduism something &#8216;modern&#8217;, and also have tried to make Hinduism something like Christianity in terms of <em>&#8220;Love&#8221;</em>, <em>&#8220;Proselytism&#8221;</em> et al. As the Hindu-fascist<em> (more correctly Hindutva-vadi)</em> Shrikant G. Talageri states in his book <em>&#8216;The Rigveda – A Historical Analysis&#8217;</em>, in Section III- Appendices -:</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">&#8220;The Christian missionaries treated Hinduism as inferior to Christianity on various counts: namely, idol-worship, polytheism, etc. Instead of countering these religious prejudices and pointing out that there was nothing superior to polytheism in monotheism, or superior to idolworship in Christian forms of worship, <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>the Arya Samaj <span style="color:red;">adopted</span> these prejudices</strong></span>, and sought to counter the Christian propaganda by insisting that Hinduism, in its pristine and &#8220;pure&#8221; form, as represented in the Vedas, was more monotheistic and non-idol-worshiping than Christianity itself. <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">This was rather like accepting and adopting the European prejudice which treats white-skinned people as superior to dark-skinned people, and then trying to show that Indian skins are whiter than European skins!</span><br />
</strong>Another point of Christian superiority to Hinduism, in the eyes of the Christian missionaries, was the claim that Christianity had One Divine Book which was the revealed word of God, while the Hindus had a large and miscellaneous assortment of religious books. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">The Arya Samaj sought to counter this by raising the Vedas to that status: the Vedas thus became the one and only Divine Book (the four Samhitas being treated as parts of one indivisible whole) revealed by God</span>.&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Anyone, who has read Satyarth Prakāsh and other protestant Hindu manuals, books, will take no time to acknowledge the influence and impact of Christianity on protestant Hinduism and the consequences of such influence and impact. Though Moolshankar had put all his energy to <strong><em>&#8216;reform&#8217;</em></strong> Hinduism by reinterpreting Vedas and other Shashtras as per his whims, it&#8217;s to be noted that all such things done were in line with Christian principles and methods and were done in- order to present Hinduism as a competitor against so-called monotheistic<em>(undoubtedly Polytheistic)</em> and modern faith like Christianity.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">And as Ronald Neufeldt writes,</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">&#8220;Even in the case of Dayānanda, whose relationships with Christians tended to be polemical, one finds an emphasis on a personal God who rules in terms of justice, compassion and orderliness and the assertion that these beliefs are in accord with the dictates of conscience and reason. <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Clearly there is much here that parallels the language of missionaries and indologists alike, and in some cases at least there is the <span style="color:red;">admission of indebtedness to the teachings of bible and the missionaries.</span></strong></span>&#8220;</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Also as Harold Coward writes,</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><strong>&#8220;Dayananda made Hinduism a religion of the book by adopting the Protestant principle of <em>sola scriptura</em> and applying it to the Vedas&#8221;</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"> – [&#8220;Dayananda&#8217;s Approach to Other Religions&#8221;, in G.R.Garg, <em>World Perspectives on Swami  Dayananda Saraswati</em>, pg. 267, 1984] </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Moolshankar used the protestant principle of <strong><em>&#8216;Sola Scriptura&#8217;</em></strong> , and demoted Upanishads, Brahmanas…etc to the level of smriti <em>(from shruti)</em> and only the Samhitā portion were or are called as <em>&#8216;Vedas&#8217;</em> by him and his blind-followers. In fact if we were to see today, we can find numerous similarities between protestant Hinduism and Christianity with regards to their presentation, organization and proselytizing…etc. For instance we can see how , fanatics like Mahendra Pāl, Agniveer et al. use <em>&#8216;Character Assassination'(to malign noble Prophet Muhammad Sallal lāhu alayhi wa Sallam)</em> as a tool against Islām, this was first used by Christians against Muslims as they very well-knew, Islām taught and commanded strict mannerism and respect, even toward bitter enemies , hence by attacking the character of the noble Prophet they were sure that Muslims won&#8217;t get so lowly and unethical, due to stringent Islāmic mannerism and secondly the high respect Muslims held for Jesus Christ , as we believe him to be prophet of the Almighty ,hence <em>(Muslims)</em> would not retaliate by abusing, debasing or maligning Jesus. Protestant Hinduism also follows something similar to protestant chrisitianity and that&#8217;s the watchword by Luther – <em>&#8220;back to Bible&#8221;</em>, where as Moolshankar cried out – <em>&#8220;back to Vedas&#8221;</em>.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">And this same <em>&#8216;Character Assassination&#8217;</em> is used by protestant Hindus against Islām; moreover they<em> (protestant Hindus like Agniveer et al) </em>use the same arguments and claims concocted by the Christian missionaries and Christian Islāmophobes. Their style of proselytizing and converting people is similar to that of Christians, using <em>&#8216;deception&#8217;</em> and are <em>&#8216;double-faced&#8217;</em>, at times they&#8217;ll be talking of global peace, brotherhood and behind the back they&#8217;ll be found abusing and maligning your religion, on false accounts and fake information. </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">If anyone were to read polemical works by protestant Hindus against Islām , he would fore sure be struck by the striking similarity between their<em>(protestant Hinduism and Christianity)</em>methods, works and arguments, in factuality most of the arguments hurled at Islām by protestant Hindus are borrowed from Christian Orientalists and missionaries. There are tremendous amount of similarities between these two paragons of polytheism and false-hood, but due to space and time scarcity we won&#8217;t be dealing with those, in here for now.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

<div style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><strong>Attributes of Ishwar</strong> are <strong>incapability</strong>,<strong> dependency</strong>.
