<p><strong>Meat consumption and animal sacrifice in Valmiki Ramayana</strong></p>
<p>By: Muhammad Qasim al-Hanafi</p>
<p>The Valmiki Ramayana is one of the foremost &#8216;Pramānās (Evidences)&#8217; for a Hindu. The epic traditionally ascribed to the Maharishi Valmiki. This epic is divided into seven kāṇḍas: the ayodhyakāṇḍa, the araṇyakāṇḍa, the kiṣkindakāṇḍa, the sundarākāṇḍa, and the laṅkākāṇḍa (also called Yuddhakāṇḍa). These five Kandas are unanimously accepted by Hindus, but they differ about the Uttarākāṇḍa &amp; the Bālakāṇḍa. Though Bālakāṇḍa is sometimes considered in the main epic, according to many Uttarakanda is certainly a later interpolation and thus is not attributed to the work of Maharshi Valmiki. This is disputed issue among Hindu scholars.</p>
<p>But Geeta Press (Gorakhpur) seems to have accepted it wholly, without compromising on any part including Uttarakanda. So, I do build up my words relying on this version published by Geeta Press.</p>
<p>If we check on such authentic version of Valmiki Ramayana, there are several places which indicate that Rama, his wife Sita and his brother Lakshman would eat meat. Also it was common among them in their &amp; other people&#8217;s life in Ramayan Period.</p>
<p>Swami Vivekanand himself admitted the fact:</p>
<p><span id="more-8525"></span></p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Instances are found in the Râmâyana and the Mahâbhârata of the drinking of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">wine and the taking of meat by Rama and Krishna,</span> whom they worship as God. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sita Devi vows meat</span>, rice, and a thousand jars of wine to the river-goddess, Gangâ!&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Complete_Works_of_Swami_Vivekananda/Volume_5/Writings:_Prose_and_Poems/The_East_and_The_West/Food_and_Cooking" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Complete_Works_of_Swami_Vivekananda/Volume_5/Writings:_Prose_and_Poems/The_East_and_The_West/Food_and_Cooking<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>Due to controversy among Hindus regarding seven Kandas&#8217; authenticity, in beginning I will quote from authentic Kandas; and will quote from Uttarakanda &amp; Balkanda in the end in following these reliable Kandas.</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><strong>Ayodhya Kanda, Chapter: 50, Verses: 8-10</strong></p>
<p>&#8216;Kosala (कोसल)&#8217; was one of the &#8216;Solasa Mahajanapadas (sixteen powerful realms)&#8217; in ancient India. According to the Ramayana, Rama ruled the &#8216;Kosala kingdom (कोसल राज्य)&#8217; from his capital, Ayodhya. In the verses, Rama bids farewell to his birth-place Ayodhya, this region is glorified in Ramayana as follows:</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>ततो धान्यधनोपेतान् दानशीलजनान् शिवान्।</p>

<p>&#8220;Proceeding on his way, Shri Rama beheld prosperous towns and villages full of men of charitable, righteous and fearless disposition evidenced by the abundance of temples, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">and sacrificial pillars</span>, of their cities. The garden filled with mango trees were enriched by pools of translucent water with carefully tended highways and herds of cattle grazing here and there. Everywhere the recitation of the Veda could be heard.&#8221;</p>

<p>Verse no. 8 is mentioning very clear word &#8216;चैत्ययूपसमावृतान्&#8217; which means &#8216;surrounded by sacrificial altars and posts&#8217;. But Geeta Press is confusing the readers by ambiguous words: &#8216;यज्ञ-सम्बन्धी यूपों से व्याप्त थे&#8217;.</p>

<p>The illustrious son of Sumitra <span style="text-decoration: underline;">slew a black antelope and roasted it in the flames</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">When it was dressed and the blood drained from it</span>, Lakshmana addressed Raghava, saying: &#8220;O Godlike one<span style="text-decoration: underline;">, I have prepared the flesh of the black deer,</span> now offer up the sacrifice to propitiate the God.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>(6) Gross fraud by Geeta Press:</strong></p>
<p>Verse no. 22 mentions the word &#8216;ऐणेयं&#8217; means &#8216;antelope (especially black)&#8217; and &#8216;मासम्&#8217; means &#8216;meat&#8217;. But Geeta Press is mistranslating it as &#8216;गजकन्द का गूदा&#8217; to veil the truth about meat eating;</p>
<p>And verse no. 23 quotes &#8216;मृगं&#8217; means &#8216;antelope/deer&#8217;, and &#8216;हत्वा&#8217; means &#8216;Killing (having killed)&#8217;. But Geeta Press distorted it by &#8216;गजकन्द नामक कंद को उखाड़कर या खोदकर&#8217;;</p>
<p>Verse no. 25 mentions the same as verse no. 22 &#8216;ऐणेयं&#8217; means &#8216;antelope&#8217;, but here also mistranslation exists &#8216;गजकन्द को&#8217;;</p>
<p>Verse no. 26 says &#8216;कृष्णमृगं&#8217; which also means &#8216;black antelope&#8217;, but Geeta Press is doing fabrication as usual &#8216;काले छिलके वाले गजकन्द को&#8217;. The verse also mentions two words: &#8216;हत्वा&#8217; means &#8216;Killing (having killed)&#8217; as in verse no. 23, and &#8216;मेध्यं&#8217; means &#8216;Pure meat&#8217; as in Chapter: 52, Verse: 102. But Geeta Press concocted as did in previous verses;</p>
<p>Verse no. 27 mentions &#8216;पक्वं&#8217; means &#8216;cooking (having cooked)&#8217;. But Geeta Press seems to show it &#8216;पका हुआ&#8217; in the mean of &#8216;ripe&#8217; to make it fit for &#8216;गजकन्द&#8217; fruit; and turning &#8216;पका हुआ&#8217; from the mean of &#8216;cooked&#8217; which is fit for &#8216;meat&#8217;, so that the reader can&#8217;t understand the hidden truth. The verse also says &#8216;निष्टप्तं&#8217; which translates &#8216;roasted well&#8217;, and &#8216;छिन्नशोणितम्&#8217; which means &#8216;drained of the blood&#8217;. But Geeta Press is making it the medicine for &#8216;Blood Disorder&#8217; by translating &#8216;रक्तविकार का नाश करने वाले&#8217;;</p>
<p>Verse no. 28 says &#8216;समस्तांगः&#8217; means &#8216;all the limbs&#8217;, but Geeta Press mistranslates &#8216;जो बिगड़े हुए सभी अंगों को ठीक करने वाला है&#8217;. It seems according to Geeta Press Rama, Seeta &amp; Lakshman were suffering from &#8216;Blood Disorder&#8217; so they searched for this medicine and had it to be healed from this disorder. And the word &#8216;कृष्णमृगो&#8217; is mentioned again means &#8216;black antelope&#8217; as in verse no. 26, but mistranslated by Geeta Press. And the word &#8216;यजस्व&#8217; means &#8216;offer with sacrifice&#8217;, but Geeta Press conceals this sacrifice by &#8216;वास्तुदेवताओं का यजन&#8217;.</p>

Feasting Videhi <span style="text-decoration: underline;">with venison</span>, Shri Rama, in order to please her, spoke in this wise: &#8220;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">This meat is pure and is rendered delicious by being roasted in the fire</span>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;गिरिनिम्नगां गिरिनदीम्। मांसेन छन्दयन् वशीकुर्वन्। ’वशाभिप्राययोश्छन्’ इति वैजयन्ती। वशीकरणप्रकारमाह इदमित्यादिना। <span style="text-decoration: underline;">इदं</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">मांसं</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">मेध्यं</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">शुद्धं</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">निर्मलमिति</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">यावत्।</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">स्वादु</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">रसवत्।</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">निष्टप्तं</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">प्रतप्तम्।</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">इदं</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">शब्देन</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">स्वभुक्तशेषमिति</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">गम्यते।</span> एवमास्ते एवं ब्रुवन्नास्त इत्यन्वयः।&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The word &#8216;girinimnaga&#8217; refers to Mandakini River that Rama is showing Seeta. The word &#8216;chandayan&#8217; indicates that Rama was trying to attract Seeta. The mode for such attraction is shown in the second sloka starting with &#8216;idam medhyam&#8217;. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The word &#8216;idam&#8217; refers to meat. &#8216;</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">medhyam</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">&#8216; means purified. &#8216;Svadu&#8217; means delicious. &#8216;Nishtaptam&#8217; means &#8216;cooked well&#8217;. The usage of &#8216;idam&#8217; (meaning &#8216;this&#8217;) indicates that it is the leftover of Rama’s food.</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Having noticed &#8216;BrahmaKshatrena&#8217; in verse 37, it has to be confessed that during Ramayan Period the practice of meat eating was equally present among Brahmans &amp; Kshatriyas.”</p>

<p>Abovementioned comment by Hindu scholar reveals the secret about meat eating by Brahmins &amp; Kshatriyas in Ramayana period, and don’t forget Rama was Kshatriya. Further, Geeta Press (Gorakhpur) admitted one more hidden truth by translating &#8216;ब्रह्मक्षत्रेण&#8217; as ‘त्रैवर्णिक’. Now first we will see what the word ‘त्रैवर्णिक’ means:</p>

<p>Now have a look!</p>
<p>Hindu Scholar Dwaraka Prasad Sharma mentioned only Brahmins &amp; Kshatriyas, but Geeta Press (Gorakhpur) is telling us that also among Vaishyas, meat eating was common as well as in Brahmins &amp; Kshatriyas. Because, Geeta Press Translation is informing about the first three castes. And every child, who is aware of Hindu ‘CASTE SYSTEM’, will tell you: “These first three castes are Brahmin, Kshatriya &amp; Vaishya.”</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> These abovementioned 16 verses are quoted from the kandas which are unanimously authentic according to Hindus. Now let me quote from two disputed kandas:</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><strong>17. Uttar Kanda, Chapter: 42, Verse: 19</strong></p>
<p>Rama entered the Ashoka along with Seeta. What happens there, see:</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">मांसानि</span> च सुमृष्टानि फलानि विविधानि च।</p>

<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><strong>(1) Translation by Hari Prasad Shastri:</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Taking Sita by the hand, Kakutstha gave her delicious wine made of distilled honey to drink, as formerly Purandara had offered to Sachi. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Thereafter pure </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>viands</em></span> and fruits of every kind were brought by servants&#8230;!&#8221;</p>

<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>Be careful!</p>
<p>The Sanskrit text mentions ‘मांसानि’ very clearly which means meat. But the translator is trying to conceal the truth by translating this apparent word by an ambiguous word ‘viands’. But, let me make this ambiguous word unambiguous:</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> The word &#8216;Viand&#8217; is French, means meat, flesh, meat food, flesh food —</p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://m.interglot.com/fr/en/viande" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">https://m.interglot.com/fr/en/viande<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><strong> 2.</strong> See what&#8217;s Merriam Webster says:</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Viand&#8217; entered English in the 15th century from Anglo-French (viand means ‘meat’ even in modern French)&#8230;!&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/viand" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/viand<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>But now a days, this word is commonly used in English for several items of food or its stock also, which is generic for veg. and non-veg. So, the translator is indirectly accepting the truth about ‘मांसानि’.</p>

<p><strong>(3) Geeta Press misled again:</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a distortion also, but truth revealing. The verse says &#8216;मांसानि (meat)&#8217; but Geeta Press replaced it with &#8216;राजोचित भोग्य पदार्थ (food befitting to King)&#8217;. Geeta Press is indirectly informing us that the meat is the food befitting to the kings. And we must remember Rama was a Kshatriya king.</p>

<p>There must remain no confusion in the readers’ mind after understanding all these irrefutable testimonies that the Ramayana Period legalizes meat eating; and also sacrificing the animals is noted as an investment for greater welfare. Now, let me turn the table to the obliteration of modern Hindu Polemics who are wasting their time in actions against documented facts.</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><strong>Refuting Hindu Polemics concerning the word &#8216;मांसम् (mānsam)&#8217;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hindu Argument (seen several times on Hindu sites and blogs):</strong></p>
<p>The word &#8216;मांसम् (mānsam)&#8217; doesn&#8217;t mean &#8216;flesh&#8217; or &#8216;meat&#8217; in these verses, because this word also means &#8216;गूदा (pulp of fruit)&#8217;. That&#8217;s why scholars explain it as &#8216;flesh of the fruit&#8217;. The same meaning is mentioned by Apte&#8217;s Sanskrit-Hindi lexicon.</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><strong>My Response:</strong></p>
<p>Firstly, we must understand that a single word can have several meanings. Exponents in the language can apply any meaning anywhere. However, only cognizant linguists are capable of understanding the context and applying the suitable meaning everywhere. Let me give a very simple and straight forward logic to dismiss the argument:</p>
<p>They say &#8216;मांसम् (mānsam)&#8217; means &#8216;pulp of a fruit&#8217;. But wait, the original text says this very explicitly: &#8216;ऐणेयं मांसम् आहृत्य&#8217;, meaning: &#8216;bringing the meat of an antelope&#8217;. In response, Lakshmana kills a &#8216;कृष्णमृगं (black antelope)&#8217;. So, now the Hindu polemics must explain which fruit is called &#8216;कृष्णमृगं (krishnamrigam)&#8217; and &#8216;ऐणेयं (ayneyam)&#8217; for the &#8216;मांसम् (mānsam)&#8217; to mean &#8216;its pulp&#8217;?</p>
<p>Please note that both occurrences are in the same context. One may see 56th chapter of Ayodhya kanda for the complete text and context.</p>
<p>Secondly, the opponent referred to Apte’s lexicon to show what is compatible with his claim and to neglect what is incompatible to his claim. In actual, Apte’s Sanskrit-Hindi lexicon mentioned three means of &#8216;मांसम् (mānsam)&#8217;:</p>
<p>1. मांस, गोश्त (meat, flesh); 2. मछली का मांस (flesh of fish); 3. फल का गूदा (pulp of fruit).</p>
[Pg. No. 847, Published by Shree Prakashan (New Delhi), New edition]
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="481" height="252" class="wp-image-8588 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/WhatsApp-Image-2020-11-21-at-2.02-481w252h.jpeg" alt="WhatsApp Image 2020-11-21 at 2.02.00 PM.jpeg" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/WhatsApp-Image-2020-11-21-at-2.02-481w252h.jpeg 481w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/11/WhatsApp-Image-2020-11-21-at-2.02-481w252h-300x157.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 481px) 100vw, 481px" /></p>
<p>I agree with the opponent that &#8216;मांसम् (mānsam)&#8217; also means pulp, but rarely, not often. And it also with no doubt means flesh. And which mean, more accurate at the place, is always decided by the context. And the word &#8216;मांसम् (mānsam)&#8217; in the verses which I quoted can never mean &#8216;pulp&#8217;, as per context. But some modern frauds want to take &#8216;मांसम् (mānsam)&#8217; everywhere in the mean of pulp to conceal the truth.</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>Thirdly, On the contrary, the words &#8216;मांसम् (mānsam)&#8217;, &#8216;मांसानि (mānsāni)&#8217; and &#8216;मांस (māns)&#8217; are mentioned in the mean of &#8216;meat&#8217; or &#8216;flesh&#8217; at several places in Valmiki Ramayan. Some are:</p>
<p>Kishkindha Kanda, 17:38; 17:40; 18:39;</p>
<p>Yuddha Kanda, 60:23; 60:33; 60:63; 67:37;</p>
<p>Sundar Kanda, 36:41; 38:15-16;</p>
<p>Now the opponent should tell me the suitable mean of &#8216;मांसम् (mānsam)&#8217;, &#8216;मांसानि (mānsāni)&#8217; and &#8216;मांस (māns)&#8217; in these ten verses? If it means ‘pulp’ then the opponent should meet a psychiatrist nearby; if not, then why? If ‘why’ is solved by the context, the same answer is from me regarding the verses abovementioned.</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><strong>Hindu Argument (as seen in Geeta Press version &amp; other Hindu sources):</strong></p>
<p>In these verses &#8216;मांसम्&#8217; means &#8216;फल-मूल (Fruits &amp; roots etc)&#8217;, not &#8216;meat&#8217;.</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><strong>My response: </strong></p>
<p>The translator or exponent must learn the rules of &#8216;Literal&#8217; and &#8216;Non-literal&#8217; language first. &#8216;Non-literal&#8217; is also called &#8216;Figurative&#8217; or &#8216;Metaphorical&#8217; sometimes. We need not take metaphorical meaning, when literal meaning is possible. Metaphorical mean can&#8217;t be accepted until the possibility of taking literal meaning ends. If we do so, it will be called &#8216;fabrication&#8217; or turning the words from their real senses. In sanskrit &#8216;फल-मूल&#8217; is literally used as &#8216;मूलफलं&#8217; or &#8216;फलमूलं&#8217;, and this word is mentioned in Valmiki Ramayan several times as:</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>In Ayodhya Kanda, 54:16</p>
<p>पित्रा नियुक्ता भगवन् प्रवेक्ष्यामस्तपोवनम्।</p>
<p>धर्ममेव चरिष्याम स्तत्र <span style="text-decoration: underline;">मूलफला</span>शनाः।।</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>Further in Ayodhya Kanda, 56:13-14</p>
<p>तन्तु पर्वतमासाद्य नानापक्षिगणायुतम्।</p>
<p>बहु<span style="text-decoration: underline;">मूलफलं</span> रम्यं सम्पन्नं सरसोदकम्।।</p>

<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>Also in Kishkindha Kanda, 17:25 (in some versions 24)</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">फलमूला</span>शनं नित्यं वानरं वनगोचरम्।</p>
<p>मामिहाप्रतियुध्यन्तमन्येन च समागतम्।।</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>Again in the same chapter of Kishkindha Kanda, verse: 30 (on no. 29 in some versions)</p>
<p>वयं वनचरा राम मृगा <span style="text-decoration: underline;">मूलफला</span>शना:।</p>
<p>एषा प्रकृतिरस्माकं पुरुषस्त्वं नरेश्वरः।।</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>Also in Ayodhya Kanda 34:59, literal words are mentioned for &#8216;फल-मूल&#8217;, see:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">फलानि</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">मूलानि</span> च भक्षयन्वने</p>
<p>गिरींश्च पश्यन् सरितस्सरांसि च।</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>One more in Ayodhya Kanda 20:29</p>
<p>चतुर्दश हि वर्षाणि वत्स्यामि विजने वने।</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">कन्दमूलफलै</span>र्जीवन्हित्वा मुनिवदामिषम्।।</p>
[In some versions, it&#8217;s &#8216;मधुमूलफलैर्जीवन्हित्वा&#8217; instead of &#8216;कन्दमूलफलैर्जीवन्हित्वा&#8217;.]
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>Furthermore in Ayodhya Kanda 27:16 (on no. 15 in some versions)</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">फलमूला</span>शना नित्यं भविष्यामि न संशयः।</p>
<p>न ते दुःखं करिष्यामि निवसन्ती सह त्वया।।</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>Now, when Sanskrit has several unequivocal words &#8216;फलमूलं&#8217;, &#8216;मूलफलं&#8217;, &#8216;कन्दमूलफल&#8217; or &#8216;फलानि मूलानि&#8217; for &#8216;फल-मूल (fruits &amp; roots etc)&#8217;, what caused the writer to take metaphorical word &#8216;मांसम् (meat)&#8217; for &#8216;फल-मूल (fruits)&#8217;, which is literal for &#8216;meat&#8217;?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s nothing except the literal fraud by modern Hindu translators and exponents. Geeta Press&#8217;s choice of word prima facie appears to &#8216;be ill-motivated and purposefully made&#8217;.</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><strong>Hindu Argument (as posed by several Hindus including Arya Samajis):</strong></p>
<p>How could Rama have meat in forest while he pledged:</p>
<p>चतुर्दश हि वर्षाणि वत्स्यामि विजने वने।</p>
<p>मधुमूलफलैर्जीवन्हित्वा मुनिवदामिषम्।।2.20.29।।</p>
<p>&#8220;Abstaining from eating meat like hermits and living on honey, fruits and roots, I am to live in the solitary forest for fourteen years.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>फलानि मूलानि च भक्षयन्वने</p>
<p>गिरींश्च पश्यन् सरितस्सरांसि च।</p>
<p>वनं प्रविश्यैव विचित्रपादपम्</p>
<p>सुखी भविष्यामि तवास्तु निर्वृतिः।।2.34.59।।</p>
<p>&#8220;Entering the forest full of various kinds of trees I shall be happy to view the mountains, rivers and the lakes and to eat fruits and roots. (Hence) do not grieve.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>पित्रा नियुक्ता भगवन् प्रवेक्ष्यामस्तपोवनम्।</p>
<p>धर्ममेव चरिष्याम स्तत्र मूलफलाशनाः।।2.54.16।।</p>
<p>&#8220;O venerable one on my father&#8217;s command we entered the desolate forest of penance. Subsisting on roots and fruits, I shall practice the righteous way of life.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>Here, the condition of exile and Rama&#8217;s pledge not to have meat. And &#8216;रामो द्विर्नाभिभाषते&#8217;, Rama hadn&#8217;t double standard in his talk.</p>
<p>Also Kaikeyi&#8217;s instruction: &#8220;रामो भवतु तापसः (Rama shall live like an ascetic.)&#8221; as mentioned in Ayodhya Kanda, 11:27.</p>
<p>So, Rama had to live in the forest like &#8216;Tapaswi (ascetic)&#8217;. How can he consume meat, while ascetics wouldn&#8217;t do so!?</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><strong>My Response:</strong></p>
<p>Firstly, coming to the statement of Kaikeyi, nothing proves in it that Rama being &#8216;Tapaswi (ascetic)&#8217; can&#8217;t have meat. Rather, Rama was to follow only an &#8216;ekadesham (a part)&#8217; of Tapashwi&#8217;s lifestyle. For all that we know, he carried his bow and sword along with him in the forest. Even Agastya Muni presents him with several weapons. But Tapashwis never carry weapons with them to the forest. Yet, we acknowledge that Rama was living like a Tapashwi. Similar is the case here.</p>
<p>Secondly, Ayodhya Kanda, 34:59 and 54:16 don&#8217;t mention that Rama won&#8217;t eat meat in the forest rather it proves taking fruits &amp; roots. Proof of having fruits doesn&#8217;t necessitate the denial of having meat.</p>
<p>Thirdly, as far as Ayodhya Kanda 20:29 is concerned, just to quote Govindarajiya commentary for this verse. The commentary says:</p>
<p>&#8220;अत्र आमिषशब्देन सूदैस्संस्कृतं मांसमुच्यते। केवलमांसस्वीकारस्योत्तरत्र वक्ष्यमाणत्वात् इदं मेध्यमिदं स्वादु निष्टप्तमिदमग्निनेति।&#8221;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="531" height="317" class="wp-image-8589 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/WhatsApp-Image-2020-11-25-at-8.01-531w317h.jpeg" alt="WhatsApp Image 2020-11-25 at 8.01.29 PM.jpeg" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/WhatsApp-Image-2020-11-25-at-8.01-531w317h.jpeg 531w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/11/WhatsApp-Image-2020-11-25-at-8.01-531w317h-300x179.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 531px) 100vw, 531px" /></p>
<p>Here, it clearly says &#8216;Aamishah (आमिषः)&#8217; is used to mean &#8216;meat used in a gravy&#8217;. He limits this meaning as it should not contradict with the &#8216;idam medhyam (इदं मेध्यम्, as in 2:96:2)&#8217; sloka where Rama eats and offers plain meat to Seeta.</p>
<p>Fourthly, Some Hindus may say: <em>&#8220;In this verse &#8216;Aamish (आमिष)&#8217; doesn&#8217;t mean &#8216;meat&#8217;, but &#8216;Good or favourite things as sweets etc&#8217;.&#8221;</em> The same interpretation is given by Swami Jagdishwaranand Saraswati in one of his articles. This interpretation is ill. Because I said before when a literal or unambiguous meaning is possible, ambiguous can&#8217;t be accepted. Further, &#8216;Aamish (आमिष)&#8217; is one of six names for &#8216;meat&#8217; given by Great Sanskrit Lexicon &#8216;Amarkosha (अमरकोश)&#8217;, it is the popular name for &#8216;Nāmaliṅgānuśāsanam (नामलिङ्गानुशासनम्)&#8217;.

<p>Fifthly, the secret behind mistranslation is unveiled now. Geeta Press &amp; alike are mistranslating these verses to conceal the truth that Rama was contradicting himself by his words &amp; acts. In some verses Rama says: <em>&#8220;I won&#8217;t have meat&#8221;,</em> but in others he is seen having meat. It proves Rama wasn&#8217;t fulfilling the promise he did in the palace. To conceal this mystery, Hindus are doing distortion in texts and to defend their Rama from character assassination. On the contrary, Valmiki Ramayana itself is assassinating his character not to be loyal in his pledge. This problem led Hindus to the way of forgery and they are doing intentionally mistranslating. And this isn&#8217;t slander or accusation from us, but it has been admitted by Geeta Press itself. See the footnotes by the press below Ayodhya Kanda, 56:22-28</p>

<p><strong>Hindu Argument (a preferred one by Hindus):</strong></p>
<p>When Hamuman meets Seeta at Lanka, he describes the personality of Rama to make her believe that he is the messenger of Rama. During the conversation, Seeta asks the routine activities of Rama while they were separated. In reply to this question, Hanuman describes Rama&#8217;s routine. In that conversation, he says in Sundarkanda 36:41</p>
<p>&#8220;न मांसं राघवो भुङ्क्ते न चापि मधु सेवते।</p>
<p>वन्यं सुविहितं नित्यं भक्तमश्नाति पञ्चमम्।।&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Rama is not eating meat, nor drinking wine. He takes only the one fifth of a meal (sanctioned for an ascetic) available in the forest.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><strong>My Response:</strong></p>
<p>I quote from Govindarajiya Vyakhya (popularly called by the other name &#8216;Bhushanam&#8217;) for this verse alone, as this is more than enough to substantiate my point:</p>
<p>&#8220;न मांसमिति॥ दृङ्मनस्सङ्गसङ्कल्पजागरः कृशतारतिः। ह्री त्यागोन्मादमूर्छान्ता इत्यनङ्गदशादशेति। दशावस्थास्वरतिरनेनोच्यते। मांसाद्यभोजनम् अरत्या। <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ततः</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">पूर्वं</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">तद्भोजनोक्तः</span>।&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There are ten states of mind that describe the mood of a lone lover who is separated from his/her spouse. Of these ten states, &#8216;arati&#8217; or &#8216;disinterest&#8217; is one. The restraint from eating meat and drinking liquor is out of &#8216;arati&#8217; or &#8216;disinterest&#8217; (since Rama has lost his spouse). <span style="text-decoration: underline;">That indicates his partaking of meat and liquor earlier.</span>&#8221;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="545" height="241" class="wp-image-8593 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/WhatsApp-Image-2020-11-26-at-6.25-545w241h.jpeg" alt="WhatsApp Image 2020-11-26 at 6.25.42 PM.jpeg" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/WhatsApp-Image-2020-11-26-at-6.25-545w241h.jpeg 545w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/11/WhatsApp-Image-2020-11-26-at-6.25-545w241h-300x133.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 545px) 100vw, 545px" /></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>From this detailed analysis, a just can conclude that there is no prevention of consuming meat in Hindus. Their ‘Maryada-Purushottam’ also took it in his life. In refutation of this analysis, the only expected answers from Hindus may be two. They will say: <em>“These verses are interpolated”,</em> or <em>“Muslims do misinterpret our scriptures to prove their claims”.</em> But, one can see above I did say nothing from my own. But I quoted their own scholars and books at every step. And that should be sufficient for righteous, but obstinacy has no cure. After all, what can be said except Qur&#8217;ān 7:179 —</p>
<p><em>&#8220;&#8230;they have hearts in which there is no understanding; and the eyes they do not see with; and the ears they do not hear with&#8230;!&#8221; </em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Written by Ibn Muhammad</p>
<p>Special thanks to Brother Neer Muhammad, who has been really helpful throughout the writing of this article and also gave valuable points.</p>
<p>Present day Hindu culture is pivoted solely on the cow. Its material and spiritual concepts are both engulfed in cow worship. Such an animal worship is known as zoolatry. The Hindutva brigade propaganda machinery uses the politics of cow to mobilize the blind Hindu masses and works them into a frenzy. The taboo on cow slaughter is one of the pillars of the Hindutva ideology. According to M.S.Golwalkar, a Hindutva ideologue, cow slaughter in India began with foreign domination. “The Muslims started it and the Britishers continued it” (M.S.Golwalkar, <em>Bunch of Thoughts</em>, Pg 496). In the past, several futile attempts have been made by proponents of Hindutva to pass a law to ban the slaughter of cows at the national level. In the NCERT school textbook for Class VI (2002) we read:</p>
<p><span id="more-843"></span></p>
<p><strong>“Among the animals the cow was given the most important and sacred place. Injuring or killing of cow was prohibited in the Vedic period. The cow was called Aghnya (is not to be killed or injured). Vedas prescribe punishment for injuring or killing cow by expulsion from the kingdom or by death penalty, as the case may be”</strong></p>
<p><strong>(<em>Social Sciences Textbook for Class VI</em>, Pg 89.).</strong></p>
<p>But the theory that the in Vedic times there was no cow slaughter is historically inaccurate. Although cow was revered and treated as sacred, it was also offered as food to guests and persons of high status. The fact remains that ancient Hindu scriptures clearly permit the consumption of meat, even of cows. True scholars, and not modern frauds, know this. For example, Swami Vivekananda who is considered as a major force in the revival of Hinduism in modern India, admitted that ancient Hindus used to eat meat. He says,</p>
<p><strong>“You will be astonished if I tell you that, according to the old ceremonials, he is not a good Hindu who does not eat beef. On certain occasions he must sacrifice a bull and eat it.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>[<em>The complete works of Swami Vivekananda</em>, Volume 3, Pg 536]</strong></p>
<p>In the same volume on page 174 he says,</p>
<p><strong>“There was a time in this very India when, without eating beef, no Brahmin could remain a Brahmin;”</strong></p>
<p>Let us now look at the evidence from Hindu texts, which proves that Hinduism not only permits beef eating but also requires its folowers to institute certain cow sacrifices. I will simultaneously refute the common arguments of Hindus.</p>
<h1><strong>Yajna and animal sacrifices</strong></h1>
<p>In Hinduism, Yajna is a ritual of sacrifice derived from the practice of Vedic times. It is performed to please the gods or to attain certain wishes. A Vedic yajna is typically performed by an <em>adhvaryu</em> priest, with a number of additional priests such as the <em>hotar</em>, <em>udgatar</em> playing a major role, next to their dozen helpers, by reciting or singing Vedic verses. How to deal with the animal, that is to be sacrificed in the Yajna, be it a goat, a horse or a cow, is mentioned in the <em>Aitareya Brahman</em> of the Rigveda as follows:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="418" height="324" class="wp-image-7615" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/3-5d8baf8705.jpeg" alt="3-5d8baf8705" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/3-5d8baf8705.jpeg 418w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/3-5d8baf8705-300x233.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 418px) 100vw, 418px" /></p>
<p><strong>“6. …Turn the animal’s feet northwards. Make its eyes go to the Sun, dismiss its breath to the wond, its life to the space, its hearing to the directions, its body to the earth. In this way the Hotar (priest) connets it with these world. Take of the entire skin without cutting it. Before opening the navel tear out the omentum. Stop its breathing within (by stopping its mouth). Thus the Hotar puts breath in the animals. Make of its breast a piece like an eagle, of its arms (two pieces like) two hatchets, of its forearms (two pieces like) two spikes, of its shoulders (two pieces like) two kashyapas (tortoises), its loins should be unbroken (entire); make of its thigs (two pieces like) two shields, of the two kneepans (two pieces like) two oleander leaves; take out its twenty-six ribs according to their order; preserve every limb of its in its integrity. Thus he benefits all its limbs. Dig a ditch in the earth to hide its excrements.</strong></p>
<p><strong>7. Present the evil spirits with the blood.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Aitareya Brahman, Book 2, para 6 and 7]</strong></p>
<p>Subsequently, the same Aitareya Brahman instructing on how to distribute different parts of the sacrificial animal says,</p>
<p><strong>“Now follows the division of the different parts of the sacrificial animal (among the priests). We shall describe it. The two jawbones with the tongue are to be given to the Prastotar; the breast in the form of an eagle to the Udgatar; the throat with the palate to the Pratihartar; the lower part of the right loins to the Hotar; the left to the Brahma; the right thigh to the Maitravaruna; the left to the Brahmanuchhamsi; the right side with the shoulder to the Adhvaryu; the left side to those who accompany the chants; the left shoulder to the Pratipasthatar; the lower part of the right arm to the Neshtar; the lower part of the left arm to the Potar; the upper part of the right thigh to the Achhavaka; the left to the Agnidhra; the upper part of the right arm to the Aitreya; the left to the Sadasya; the back bone and the urinal bladder to the Grihapati (sacrificer); the right feet to the Grihapati who gives a feasting; the left feet to the wife of that Grihapati who gives a feasting; the upper lip is common to both, which is to be divided by the Grihapati. They offer the tail of the animal to wives, but they should give it to a Brahmana; the fleshy processes (maanihah) on the neck and three gristles (kikasaah) to the Grahvastut; three other gristles and one half of the fleshy part on the back (vaikartta) to the Unnetar; the other half of the fleshy part on the neck and the left lobe (Kloma) to the Slaughterer (Shamita), who should present it to a Brahmana, if he himself would not happen to be a Brahmana. The head is to be given to the Subrahmanya, the skin belongs to him (the Subrahmanya), who spoke, Svaah Sutyam (to morrow at the Soma Sacriice); that part of the sacrificial animal at a Soma sacrifice which beloings to Ilaa (sacrificial food) is common to all the priests; only for the Hotar it is optional.</strong></p>
<p><strong>All these portions of the sacrificial animal amount to thirty-six single pieces, each of which represents the paada (foot) of a verse by which the sacrifice is carried up…”</strong></p>
<p><strong>“To those who divide the sacrificial animal in the way mentioned, it becomes the guide to heaven (Swarga). But those who make the division otherwise are like scoundrels and miscreants who kill an animal merely.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>“This division of the sacrificial animal was invented by Rishi Devabhaaga, a son of Srauta. When he was departing from this life, he did not entrust (the secret to anyone). But a supernatural being communicated it to Girija,the son of Babhru. Since his time men study it.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Aitareya Brahman, Book 7, Para 1, Translated by Martin Haug]</strong></p>
<p>I have come across certain bigots among Hindus, who make the excuse that these are the translations of a non-Hindu European scholar with ‘ulterior motives’. This is a common response of  half-baked Hindus, who have negligible knowledge of Hindu scriptures. To establish the authenticity of the above translations, I will produce before you passages from the <em>‘Purva Mimamsa Sutras’</em> of Jaimini, its commentary called ‘<em>Shabarbhasya</em>‘ and the views of renowned Arya Samaj scholar, Pandit Yudhishthira Mimamsak on them.</p>
<p>It must be noted that the <em>Purva Mimamsa Sutras</em> (compiled between 300-200 BCE), written by Rishi Jaimini is one of the most important ancient Hindu philosophical texts. It forms the basis of Mimamsa, the earliest of the six orthodox schools (darshanas) of Indian philosophy.</p>
<p>Commenting on Purv Mimansa Sutra Adhyaya 3, Pada 6, Sutra 18, the <em>Shabarbhasya</em> says,</p>
<p>संति च पशुधर्माः- उपाकरणं, उपानयं, अक्ष्णया बंधः, यूपे नियोजनम्, संज्ञपनं, विशसनमित्येवमादयः</p>
<p><strong>There are also certain details to be performed in connection with the animals, such as (a) Upaakaranam [Touching the animal with the two mantras], (b) Upaanayanam [Bringing forward], (c) Akshanyaa-bandhah [Tying with a rope], (d) Yoope niyojanam [Fettering to the Sacrificial Post], (e) Sanjnapanam [Suffocating to death], (f) Vishasanam [Dissecting], and so forth.</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Shabhar bhashya on Mimamsa Sutra 3/6/18; translated by Ganganath Jha]</strong></p>
<p>Expounding on this, Arya Samaj scholar, Pandit Yudhisthira Mimamsak writes in is ‘<em>Mimamsa Shabar Bhashyam’</em></p>
<p><strong>“In this case and otherwise it appears from the Jaimini Sutras that the offering of sacrificed animals is to be made in the Yajnas. It is clearly mentioned in the Mimamsa Sutrs.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Mimamsa Shabharbhasyam, adhyaya 3, Page 1014]</strong></p>
<p>Moving on let us see Mimamsadarshan Sutra 3/7/28 which says,</p>
<p>शमिता च शब्दभेदात्</p>
<p><strong>The ‘Shamita’ (slaughterer of the animal) is not distinct from the major priests.</strong></p>
<p>Commenting on it the <em>Shabarbhashya </em>says,</p>
<p>क्लोमा चार्द्धवं वैकर्तनं च शमितुः तद् ब्राह्मणाय दद्यात् यद्य ब्राह्मणः स्यात्</p>
<p><strong>“The liver and the upper quarter belongs to the Shamita Priest ; one should give it to a Brahmana if he be a non-Brahmana.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Shabhar bhasya on Mimamsa Sutra 3/7/28; translated by Ganganath Jha]</strong></p>
<p>Notice that this is exactly the same things that we saw was said in Aitareya Brahman Book 7; Para 1 above (the highlighted part). This proves that Shabarbhashya is confirming the Aitareya Brahman and the translation is also accurate.</p>
<p>Pandit Yudhisthira Mimamsak also confirms this when he says,</p>
<p><strong>“The division of the meat of the sacrificed animal as instructed in the Aitareya Brahman clearly proves that during the time of the writing of Aitareya Brahman and the time when it was edited by Saunaka, animals were sacrificed in the Yajnas and their meat was consumed by the Brahmins“</strong></p>
<p>Some half-baked Hindus who like to play games might try to call all these references as later interpolations. However, the scholar Yudhisthir Mimamsak outrightly rejects such a bogus conclusion when he says,</p>
<p><strong>“There is no strong evidence to consider these passages as later interpolations.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Mimamsa Shabarbhashyam by Yudhishthir Mimamsak Adhyaya 3, Page 1075]</strong></p>
<p>Further in Mimamsa Sutra 3/8/43 it is mentioned,</p>
<p>मांसं तु सवनियानां चोदनाविशेषात</p>
<p><strong>“Only the ‘Savaniya’ cakes should consist of flesh”</strong></p>
<p>All these passages prove that the flesh of the sacrificed animal was consumed as per the instructions of the Hindu texts.</p>
<h1><strong>Refuting the modern Hindu polemic of ‘No violence in Yajna’<br />
</strong></h1>
<p><strong>Hindu Argument (quoted from a Hindu apologetics website)</strong></p>
<p>Yajna never meant animal sacrifice in the sense popularly understood. Yajna in the Vedas meant a noble deed or the highest purifying action.</p>
<p>————————<em>—————–</em></p>
<p>Adhvara iti Yajnanaama – Dhvaratihimsaakarmaa tatpratishedhah</p>
<p>Nirukta 2.7</p>
<p>According to Yaaska Acharya, one of the synonyms of Yajna in Nirukta or the Vedic philology is Adhvara.</p>
<p>Dhvara means an act with himsa or violence. And therefore a-dhvara means an act involving no himsa or no violence. There are a large number of such usage of Adhvara in the Vedas.</p>
<p><strong>Response</strong></p>
<p>This argument is incorrect because the word ‘Adhvar’ has been misplaced and interpreted incompletely. Yaska is merely giving the etymology of the word ‘Adhvar’ and not where it is to be applied and what constitutes violence. To know the true application of the word ‘Adhvar’ we will have to turn to Shatapath Brahman, which gives the complete understanding of why ‘Yajna’ is called ‘Adhvar’. Shatapath Brahman 1/4/1/40 says,</p>
<p>devānha vai yajñena yajamānāṃtsapatnā</p>
<p>asurā dudhūrṣāṃ cakruste dudhūrṣanta eva na śekurdhūrvituṃ te</p>
<p>parābabhūvustasmādyajño <strong>adhvaro nāma</strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="81" class="wp-image-7617" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/8-ff30ff984e.jpeg" alt="8-ff30ff984e" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/8-ff30ff984e.jpeg 683w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/8-ff30ff984e-300x36.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px" /></p>
<p><strong>“For once when the gods were engaged in sacrificing, their rivals, the Asuras, wished to injure (dhvar) them; but, though desirous of injuring them, they were unable to injure them and were foiled: for this reason the sacrifice is called adhvara (‘not damaged, uninterrupted’).”</strong></p>
<p>Thus the argument of the polemicist turns out to be a deception aimed at fooling those who have no access to the original texts. The passage of Shatapath Brahman makes it clear that ‘Adhvar’ is called so because the priests performing the Yajna did not become victims of violence. It has no connection to the violence of the animals done in the Yajna.</p>
<p>Renowned classical commentator of the four Vedas, Sayana Acharya, also gives the same reason for calling Yajna as ‘Adhvar’. He says in his comments on Rigveda 1/1/4,</p>
<p>अध्वरं हिंसारहितम् ह्वग्निना सर्वतः पालितं यज्ञं राक्षसादयो हिंसितुं प्रभवंति</p>
<p><strong>“Adhvar is called ‘without violence’ because being protected by Agni on all sides it is uninterrupted by Rakshashas or violent enemies, who are unable to mar it.”</strong></p>
<p>Again we see that Acharya Sayan expresses the same view as that of the Shatapath Brahman i.e the violence referred in the ‘adhvar’ is not for the sacrificial animal in the Yajna.</p>
<p>Renowned Hindu scholar, Swami Prabhupada explains the so-called violence in the Yajna in the following words,</p>
<p><strong>“Although animal killing in a sacrifice is recommended in the Vedic literature, the animal is not considered to be killed. The sacrifice is to give a new life to the animal. Sometimes the animal is given a new animal life after being killed in the sacrifice, and sometimes the animal is promoted immediately to the human form of life.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Bhagavad Gita As It Is 8/13]</strong></p>
<p>Even Manu Smriti echoes the same opinion in a more clear way in Chapter 5, verse 39 when it says,</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="698" height="35" class="wp-image-7618" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/9-f576746bf5.jpeg" alt="9-f576746bf5" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/9-f576746bf5.jpeg 698w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/9-f576746bf5-300x15.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 698px) 100vw, 698px" /></p>
<p><strong>“Svayambhu (the Self-existent) himself created animals for the sake of sacrifices; sacrifices (have been instituted) for the good of this whole (world); hence the slaughtering (of beasts) for sacrifices is not slaughtering (in the ordinary sense of the word).”</strong></p>
<p>Again Manu Smriti Chapter 5, verse 44 says</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="694" height="38" class="wp-image-7619" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/10-c0106913d5.jpeg" alt="10-c0106913d5" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/10-c0106913d5.jpeg 694w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/10-c0106913d5-300x16.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 694px) 100vw, 694px" /></p>
<p><strong>“Know that the injury to moving creatures and to those destitute of motion, which the Veda has prescribed for certain occasions, is no injury at all; for the sacred law shone forth from the Veda.”</strong></p>
<p>Thus, this argument stands nullified. For more scholarly explanation that the violence of animals in the Yajna is actually no violence please see the last section of this article namely ‘The testimony of classical scholars’.</p>
<h1><strong>Animal sacrifices in Vedas, including cow sacrifice<br />
</strong></h1>
<p>Chapter 24 of the Shukla Yajurveda is a unique chapter that will help us throw light on the animal sacrifices in the Vedas. This chapter contains an exact enumeration of animals that are to be tied to the sacrificial stakes, with the names of the deities to which they are dedicated. Several of the animals cannot be identified. This entire chapter is a weird puzzle, which is difficult to solve for the  modern vegetarian Hindus. They are simply unable to explain the coherent meaning of this chapter. You will be amazed to know that even a Vedic scholar like Swami Dayanand is unable to throw any light on it. He merely says that we should know the  qualities of each animal by relating to the qualities of the deity to whom they are dedicated.  This statement of the Swami is itself a puzzle, as it gives no clear beneficial knowledge to us. Even Pandit Devi Chand, an Arya Samaj scholar, who based his English translation of the Yajurveda on Swami Dayanand’s work is clueless about the exact meaning of this chapter. He says in  the footnote to verse #1,</p>
<p><strong>“The exact significance of these animals being attached to the forces of nature (or Deities) is not clear to me.” (words in brackets  mine)</strong></p>
<p>Does this mean that no Hindu scholar for thousands of years has been able to understand the meaning of this chapter? I would say that is not the case. If we go to the Brahmanas and the classical commentators of the Vedas, the puzzle is solved. According to them each animal dedicated to a particular diety in this chapter has to be sacrificed to that deity. See Shatapath Brahmana 13/2/2/1-10</p>
<p>If this view is not accepted as the correct one, then every verse of this chapter would be a question mark with no answer.  For example, verse 1 dedicates ‘a cow that slips her calf’ to Indra. But the question is, what will Indra do with such a cow? Is Indra going to give a sermon to her? or is Indra going to punish her? Such questions require satisfactory answers which modern vegetarian Hindus are unable to provide.</p>
<p>In the Yajnas meant for obtaining Rice, meat of bulls was cooked and offered to the diety.</p>
<p>Rigveda 10/28/3 mentions this as</p>
<p>अद्रिणा ते मन्दिन इन्द्र तूयान सुन्वन्ति सोमान पिबसि तवमेशाम |</p>
<p>पचन्ति ते वर्षभानत्सि तेषां पर्क्षेण यन्मघवन हूयमानः ||</p>
<p><strong>“Your worshippers express with the stone fast flowing exhilarating Soma-juices for you. You drink them. They roast bulls for you, you eat them when you are invoked, Maghavan, to the sacrificial food.”</strong></p>
<p>This is interpreted by Sayana Acharya as follows:</p>
<p><strong>“You (O Indra), eat the cattle offered as oblations belonging to the worshippers who cook them for you.”</strong></p>
<p>Acharya Sayana explicitly mentions about sacrificing a bull in the introduction to Atharvaveda 9/4/1 as follows</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="574" height="156" class="wp-image-7620" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/12-de55437186.jpeg" alt="12-de55437186" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/12-de55437186.jpeg 574w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/12-de55437186-300x82.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 574px) 100vw, 574px" /></p>
<p><strong>“The Brahman after killing the bull, offers its meat to the different deities. In this hymn, the bull is praised, detailing which parts of the bull are attached to which deity as well as the importance of sacrificing the bull and the rewards of doing the same.”</strong></p>
<h1><strong>The Ashwamedha Yajna</strong></h1>
<p>The ‘<em>Practical Sanskrit English Dictionary’</em> by V. S. Apte (1890) gives the following meaning of ‘Ashwa-medha’</p>
<p>अश्वः प्रधानतया मेध्यते हिंस्यते अत्र</p>
<p><strong>“A Yajna in which a Horse is primarily sacrificed is called Ashwamedha. [A Horse Sacrifice]“</strong></p>
<p>The dictionary further goes on to say</p>
<p><strong>“In Vedic times this sacrifice was performed by kings desirous of offspring.”</strong></p>
<p>This statement is right when we turn to Shatapath Brahman 13/1/9/9.</p>
<p>To give readers a brief idea of Ashwamedha Yajna, I will briefly mention the entire ritual based on Hindu texts like Katyayana Srauta Sutra, Apastamba Sutra, etc; but I will not mention the obscene portion of the Ashwamedha ritual as it is irrelevant with the topic at hand.</p>
<p>The horse to be sacrificed is sprinkled with water, and the Adhvaryu and the sacrificer whisper mantras into its ear. Anyone who should stop the horse is ritually cursed, and a dog is killed symbolic of the punishment for the sinners. The horse is then set loose towards the North-East, to roam around wherever it chooses, for the period of one year (or half a year, according to some commentators). The horse is associated with the Sun, and its yearly course. If the horse wanders into neighbouring provinces hostile to the sacrificer, they must be subjugated. The wandering horse is attended by a hundred young men, sons of princes or high court officials, charged with guarding the horse from all dangers and inconvenience. During the absence of the horse, an uninterrupted series of ceremonies is performed in the sacrificer’s home.</p>
<p>After the return of the horse, more ceremonies are performed. I HAVE OMITTED THE OBSCENE PORTION OF THIS YAJNA IN THIS ARTICLE. Those who wish to read them can see Shukla Yajurveda Chapter 23; verses 19-31 and the commentary of classical scholars.</p>
<p>After this, the horse, a hornless he-goat, a wild ox are bound to sacrificial stakes near the fire, and seventeen other animals are attached to the horse. A great number of animals, both tame and wild, are tied to other stakes, according to a commentator 609 in total (Yajurveda, chapter 24 consists of an exact enumeration).</p>
<p>Then the horse is slaughtered. The horse is dissected, and its flesh roasted. Various parts are offered to a host of deities. Prayers are made for wealth, offspring and body strength.</p>
<p>In Rigveda, the clearest mention of Ashwamedha is made in Mandal 1 Sookt 162.  I will be quoting those verses of this hymn which directly prove that a horse was sacrificed and consumed. As we have already read the passages of Aitareya Brahman concerning the method of sacrificing the animal and distributing its meat, the following passages of the Rigveda will be easier to comprehend.</p>
<p>Rigveda 1/162/3 says,</p>
<p>एष छागः पुरो अश्वेन वाजिना पूष्णो भागो नीयते विश्वदेव्यः |</p>
<p>अभिप्रियं यत पुरोळाशमर्वता तवष्टेदेनं सौश्रवसाय जिन्वति ||</p>
<p><strong>This goat, the portion of Pushan, fit for all the gods, is brought first with the fleet courser, so that Twashtri may prepare him along with the horse, as an acceptable preliminary offering for the (sacrificial) food.</strong></p>

<p>Next verse 1/162/4 says,</p>
<p>यद धविष्यं रतुशो देवयानं तरिर्मानुषाः पर्यश्वं नयन्ति |</p>
<p>अत्रा पूष्णः परथमो भाग एति यज्ञं देवेभ्यः परतिवेदयन्नजः ||</p>
<p><strong>‘When the priests at the season (of this ceremony) lead forth the horse, the offering devoted to the gods, thrice round the (sacrificial fire) ; then the goat, the portion of Pushan (or Agni), goes first, announcing the sacrifice to the gods.’</strong></p>
<p>That is, the goat is first sacrificed and then the horse.</p>

<p>Verse 9 says,</p>
<p>यदश्वस्य क्रविषो मक्षिकाश यद वा सवरौ सवधितौ रिप्तमस्ति |</p>
<p>यद धस्तयोः शमितुर्यन नखेषु सर्वा ता ते अपि देवेष्वस्तु ||</p>
<p><strong>Whatever the flies may eat of the raw flesh of the horse; whatever is smeared upon the brush or upon the axe; (what is smeared) upon the hands or the nails of the immolator, may all this be with you, (horse) among the gods.</strong></p>
<p>Here we clearly see that the belief of the Vedic people was that horse was not actually dying. It was rather going to the world of the gods to enjoy a much better life, quite similar to the explanation given by Swami Prabhupada above.</p>

<p>Verse 10 says,</p>

<p><strong>Whatever (portion) of your slaughtered body fall from your carcase when it is being roasted by the fire, (escaping) from the spit; let it not be left on the ground, nor on the (sacred) grass, but let it (all) be given to the longing gods.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Let their exertions be for our good who watch the cooking of the horse; who say, it is fragrant; therefore give us some; who solicit the flesh of the horse as alms.</strong></p>

<p>verse 21, addressing the horse says,</p>
<p>न वा उ एतन मरियसे न रिष्यसि देवानिदेषि पथिभिः सुगेभिः |</p>
<p>हरी ते युञ्जा पर्षती अभूतामुपास्थाद वाजी धुरि रासभस्य ||</p>
<p><strong>Verily at this moment you do not die; nor are you harmed; for you go by auspicious paths to the gods. The horses of Indra, the steeds of the Maruts shall be yoked (to their cars), and a courser shall be placed in the shaft of the ass of the Ashwins (to bear you to heaven).</strong></p>
<p>Again, this verse explicitly proves the belief of the Vedic people that the sacrificial horse did not actually die but was trasported to noble heavenly worlds.</p>
<p><strong>Simultaneous Hindi Translation and Commentary: </strong><a href="http://vedamu.org/VedaImages/192719.GIF" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right"><strong>http://vedamu.org/VedaImages/192719.GIF</strong><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>After finishing all the rites of the sacrifice, prayers were made for wealth, male offspring and bodily strength as is revealed by verse 22.</p>
<p>सुगव्यं नो वाजी सवश्व्यं पुंसः पुत्रानुत विश्वापुषं रयिम |</p>
<p>अनागास्त्वं नो अदितिः कर्णोतु कषत्रं नो अश्वो वनतां हविष्मान ||</p>
<p><strong>May this horse bring to us all-sustaining wealth, with abundance of cows, of excellent horses, and of male offspring: may the spirited steed bring us exemption from wickedness: may this horse, offered in oblation, procure for us bodily vigour.</strong></p>

<p>This hymn would be nonsense if the horse was not really killed and cooked. That the horse was to be actually immolated and that the body was cut up into fragments is clear ; that these fragments were dressed, partly boiled, and partly roasted, is also undisputable ; and although the expressions may be differently understood, yet there is little reason to doubt that part of the flesh was eaten by the assistants, part presented as a burnt offering to the gods.</p>
<h1><strong>Refuting Hindu polemics concerning Ashwamedha</strong></h1>
<p><strong>Hindu Argument (quoted from a Hindu apologetics website)</strong></p>
<p>The biggest accusation of cattle and cow slaughter comes in the context of the Yajnas that derived their names from different cattle like the Ashwamedh Yajna, the Gomedha Yajna and the Nar-medh Yajna. Even by the wildest stretch of the imagination the word Medha would not mean slaughter in this context.</p>
<p>It’s interesting to note what Yajurveda says about a horse</p>
<p>——————————————————–</p>
<p><em>Imam ma himsirekashafam pashum kanikradam vaajinam vaajineshu</em></p>
<p>Yajurveda 13.48</p>
<p>Do not slaughter this one hoofed animal that neighs and who goes with a speed faster than most of the animals.</p>
<p>———————————————————-</p>
<p>Aswamedha does not mean horse sacrifice at Yajna. Instead the Yajurveda clearly mentions that a horse ought not to be slaughtered.</p>
<p>In Shathapatha, Ashwa is a word for the nation or empire</p>
<p>The word medha does not mean slaughter. It denotes an act done in accordance to the intellect Alternatively it could mean consolidation, as evident from the root meaning of medha i.e. medhru san-ga-me</p>
<p>Raashtram vaa ashwamedhah</p>
<p>Annam hi gau</p>
<p>Agnirvaa ashwah</p>
<p>Aajyam medhah</p>
<p>(Shatpath 13.1.6.3)</p>
<p><strong>Response</strong></p>
<p>Even this argument is not upto the mark.  The tactic used by the Hindu apologists here is quoting only part of a verse (Yajurveda 13.48) and ignoring the rest; thus, attempting to mislead the gullible. Doing so gives a completely different picture that Vedas are instructing people not to kill a horse.</p>
<p>Firstly, we need to ascertain that who is this mantra being spoken to? Is it a legal prohibition or a prayer? Is this general or specific? Let us read the full mantra.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="690" height="165" class="wp-image-7621" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/18-caf29fb820.jpeg" alt="18-caf29fb820" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/18-caf29fb820.jpeg 690w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/18-caf29fb820-300x72.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px" /></p>
<p><strong>“O Agni, don’t harm this one-hoofed beautiful horse, swifter than most animals. I point out to you the wild rhinoceros. Let the wild rhinocerous be harmed by you. Let the enemy whom we hate be harmed by you.”</strong></p>
<p>As you can see this is actually a prayer by a selfish person asking his firegod Agni not to harm his own horses but to harm the wild animals, in this case a rhinocerous. So this verse is not a legal prohibition from killing horses. It is also prayer for the welfare of one’s own animals as every animal owner will naturally do. For example, there are many shepherds who pray to God to protect their cattle from undue harm so that he can sell them or kill them for food and thus they do not go waste. This prayer is on the same lines and thus cannot be taken as a prohibition of slaughtering horses.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="338" height="240" class="wp-image-7622 alignleft" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/19-b9e91e7e7e.jpeg" alt="19-b9e91e7e7e" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/19-b9e91e7e7e.jpeg 338w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/19-b9e91e7e7e-300x213.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 338px) 100vw, 338px" /></p>
<p>The next argument that Ashwa means a nation or empire, in the reference to Shatapath Brahman is also incorrect. For example, we all know that water is essential for the existence of life on this planet. But in many campaigns to prevent the wastage of water, we find slogans like ‘Water is Life’. Does this make the meaning of water to be life or the meaning of life to be water? Not at all. It is a mode of speech where figuratively water and life are equated to establish the importance of water. Similarly, in Vedic times, the horse-sacrifice was considered essential for a strong empire so much that it was equated to the nation itself. Performance of this sacrifice depicted the royal granduer. But the meaning of Ashwa can thus never become a nation. To claim so is ignorance.</p>
<p>If we read the quoted Brahman (13.1.63) further, it clearly differentiates between a nation and the ashwamedha by saying, “let him who holds royal sway perform the ashwamedha”.</p>
<p>A counter example to further nullify this argument will come from the same Shatapath Brahman. Who does not know that the Sacrifice (Yajna) and the Sacrificer (Yajmaan) are two different things. Yet Rishi Yajnavalkya says in Shatapath Brahman 13:2:2:1</p>
<p><strong>Yajmaano Yajna</strong></p>
<p>meaning the ‘<strong>Sacrifice is the Sacrificer</strong>‘. This mode of speech is very common in the Brahmanas. Only a person with the intention of twisting the meanings does not reveal this. Seeing all these evidences this argument of the Hindtuva polemicist also turns out to be false.</p>
<p>The final blow to this argument comes from the historical narratives of Mahabharata and Ramayana, where Hindus are clearly shown sacrificing a horse and other animals including cows.</p>
<p>The Ashwamedha Parv of Mahabharata, section 89, shlokas 1-5 says</p>
<p>1 [व]
<p>शमयित्वा पशून अन्यान विधिवद दविजसत्तमाः</p>
<p>तुरगं तं यथाशास्त्रम आलभन्त दविजातयः</p>
<p>2 ततः संज्ञाप्य तुरगं विधिवद याजकर्षभाः</p>
<p>उपसंवेशयन राजंस ततस तां दरुपदात्मजाम</p>
<p>कलाभिस तिसृभी राजन यथाविधि मनस्विनीम</p>
<p>3 उद्धृत्य तु वपां तस्य यथाशास्त्रं दविजर्षभाः</p>
<p>शरपयाम आसुर अव्यग्राः शास्त्रवद भरतर्षभ</p>
<p>4 तं वपा धूमगन्धं तु धर्मराजः सहानुजः</p>
<p>उपाजिघ्रद यथान्यायं सर्वपाप्मापहं तदा</p>
<p>5 शिष्टान्य अङ्गानि यान्य आसंस तस्याश्वस्य नराधिप</p>
<p>तान्य अग्नौ जुहुवुर धीराः समस्ताः षॊडशर्त्विजः</p>
<p><strong>Vaisampayana said, ‘Having cooked, according to due rites, the other excellent animals that were sacrificed, the priests then sacrificed, agreeably to the injunctions of the scriptures, that steed (which had wandered over the whole world). After cutting that horse into pieces, conformably to scriptural directions, they caused Draupadi of great intelligence, who was possessed of the three requisites of mantras, things, and devotion, to sit near the divided animal. The Brahmanas then with cool minds, taking up the marrow of that steed, cooked it duly, O chief of Bharata’s race. King Yudhishthira the just, with all his younger brothers, then smelled, agreeably to the scriptures, the smoke, capable of cleansing one from every sin, of the marrow that was thus cooked. The remaining limbs, O king, of that horse, were poured into the fire by the sixteen sacrificial priests possessed of great wisdom.</strong></p>
<h1><strong>Meat Eating in Vedas including Cow meat</strong></h1>
<p>The Sanskrit word for meat is ‘<strong>Maamsam</strong>‘. Yaska Acharya’s Nirukt 4:3 says ‘<strong>Maamsam maananam va</strong>‘ (<strong>मांसं माननं</strong> <strong>वा</strong>) and ‘<strong>Maanasam va</strong>‘ (<strong>मानसं वा</strong>). The meaning of the former is ‘it is honoured’, while the later means ‘it is thought’. Durga Acharya, the most important classical commentator of Yaska’s Nirukt, explains the phrase ‘<strong>Maamsam maananam va</strong>‘ to mean, “It is prepared for a person who is honoured”. Explaining the phrase ‘<strong>Maanasam va</strong>‘ he says, “It is enjoyed by a person with hearty pleasure or by those who are intelligent’.</p>
<p>So we see that the very sanskrit word for meat is actually a permission for meat eating.</p>
<p>Atharvaveda 18/4/20 mentions the following.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="472" height="76" class="wp-image-7623" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/untitled.jpeg" alt="Untitled" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/untitled.jpeg 472w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/untitled-300x48.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 472px) 100vw, 472px" /></p>
<p><strong>Rich in cakes, rich in flesh, let the dish (charu) take seat here; to the world-makers, the road-makers, do we sacrifice, whoever of you are here, sharing in the oblation of the gods.</strong></p>
<p>verse 42 of the same hymn reads.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="332" height="77" class="wp-image-7624" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/untitled.png" alt="Untitled" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/untitled.png 332w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/untitled-300x70.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 332px) 100vw, 332px" /></p>
<p><strong>The mingled draught, the mess of rice, the flesh which I present to you, May these be full of food for you, distilling fatness, rich in sweets.</strong></p>
<p>The serving of meat to the guests is confirmed by Shatapath Brahman 3/4/1/2 which says,</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="695" height="126" class="wp-image-7625" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/untitled-1.png" alt="Untitled" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/untitled-1.png 695w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/untitled-1-300x54.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 695px) 100vw, 695px" /></p>
<p><strong>Now as to why it is called ‘guest-offering.’ He, the purchased Soma, truly comes as his (the sacrificer’s) guest,–to him (is offered) that (hospitable reception): even as for a king or a Brâhman one would cook a large ox or a large he-goat–for that is human (fare offered to a guest), and the oblation is that of the gods–so he prepares for him that guest-offering.</strong></p>
<h1><strong>Goghna- the guest for whom a cow is killed</strong></h1>
<p>Literally the word ‘<strong>Goghna</strong>‘ means a killer of cows. However in the ancient Indian context it has a unique application. The word ‘<strong>Goghna</strong>‘ occurs in ancient Indian Grammarian Panini’s book Ashtadhyayi. He mentions in Ashtadyayi 3/4/73</p>
<p>दाशगोघ्नौ संप्रदाने</p>
<p><strong>“The words ‘daasa’ and ‘goghna’ are irregularly formed and the affix in these denotes the idea of the Dative or Recipient.”</strong></p>
<p>What does Panini mean that the word ‘goghna’ denotes the idea of recipient? He intends to say that in popular usage ‘goghna’ does not mean ‘<strong>the killer of cow</strong>‘ but ‘he on whose coming the cow is killed in order to give him, that is to say, a guest’. It is this irregularly formed word ‘goghna’ which is made applicable to the priests, guests, sons-in-law, and not the regularly formed word ‘goghna’ which means ‘a killer of a cow’.</p>
<p><strong>Thus guests in ancient India were called ‘goghna’</strong>, because on their coming a cow was slaughtered to be served to them.</p>
<p>This is exactly the explanation given in the 14th century grammar book <em>Siddhanta Kaumudi</em> by Pandit Bhattoji Dikshit. This book is taught to university level students across India for learning sanskrit grammar. In it, the sutra of Panini दाशगोघ्नौ संप्रदाने is explained in the ‘Uttarkradant’ chapter as follows:</p>
<p>गां हंति तस्मै गौघ्नो.अतिथिः</p>
<p><strong>For it a cow is slaughtered; a guest is called ‘goghna’</strong></p>
<p>Almost similar definition of ‘goghna’ is provided by the Vedic commentator Acharya Sayana in his book <em>Maadhaviya dhaatuvrittih</em>. He writes</p>
<p>गौर्यस्मै दातुं हन्यते स गोघ्नः अतिथिः</p>
<p><strong>“A person for whom a cow is slaughtered, is known as ‘goghna’ and ‘atithi’ (guest).”</strong></p>
<p>Thus it is clear that in ancient India, cows were slaughtered for honouring the guests.</p>
<h1><strong>Refuting the Hindu polemic of cow being called ‘Aghnya’</strong></h1>
<p>Many Hindus trying to somehow hide these clear evidences give some lame arguments. One common argument is that a cow in Vedic literature is called ‘<strong>Aghnya</strong>‘ meaning ‘<strong>not fit to be killed</strong>‘ and therefore a cow cannot in any way be killed. Let us address this argument.</p>
<p><strong>Hindu Argument</strong></p>
<p>Not only the Vedas are against animal slaughter but also vehemently oppose and prohibit cow slaughter.Yajurveda forbids killing of cows, for they provide energizing food for human beings</p>
<p>———————————</p>
<p>Ghrtam duhaanaamaditim janaayaagne maa himsiheeh</p>
<p>Yajurveda 13.49</p>
<p>Do not kill cows and bulls who always deserve to be protected.</p>
<p>In Rigveda cow slaughter has been declared a heinous crime equivalent to human murder and it has been said that those who commits this crime should be punished.</p>
<p>—————————————–</p>
<p><em>Sooyavasaad bhagavatee hi bhooyaa atho vayam bhagvantah syaama</em></p>
<p>Addhi trnamaghnye vishwadaaneem piba shuddhamudakamaacharantee</p>
<p>Rigveda 1.164.40 or Atharv 7.73.11 or Atharv 9.10.20</p>
<p>The Aghnya cows – which are not to be killed under any circumstances– may keep themselves healthy by use of pure water and green grass, so that we may be endowed with virtues, knowledge and wealth.</p>
<p><strong>Response</strong></p>
<p>As with the previous arguments, this argument also has serious shortcomings. We’ve already dealt with Yajurveda 13/48 and seen that it wasn’t a legal prohibition against killing a horse. Similarly, this verse also is a prayer to protect one’s cows. Let me post before you the full mantra to demonstrate my position.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="724" height="228" class="wp-image-7626" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/25-2613c5ad91.jpeg" alt="25-2613c5ad91" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/25-2613c5ad91.jpeg 724w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/25-2613c5ad91-300x94.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 724px) 100vw, 724px" /></p>
<p><strong>“O Agni, don’t harm this our cow, the giver of thousands of comforts, the source of immense milk, yielding butter for the people.  I point out to you the forest cow. Let the wild forest cow be harmed by you. Let the enemy whom we hate be harmed by you.”</strong></p>
<p>Again we see, as in verse 48, that there is no legal prohibition in this verse on killing a cow for food. It is a prayer being made to the fire god Agni to protect one’s cows from undue harm due to the wrath of the fire god.All cowherds in the world pray to their own god to keep their cows safe from harm, so that they can sell their milk and other dairy products and earn profit. This does not mean that certain cows cannot be killed for food. To say so will be just an assumption.  If this verse was about prohibiting killing of cows, why would it talk about killing the forest cow? Anyone who would read the complete verse will realize that this verse cannot be taken as a prohibition for killing cows. That is why the Hindu polemicists never give the complete verse to their audience.</p>
<p>The next argument was that in the Vedas, a cow is called ‘<strong>Aghnya</strong>‘ meaning ‘<strong>not fit to be killed</strong>‘. By this argument they try to establish that as per the Vedas cows are not to be killed. This is again a flawed argument as even according to the cultures who have beef for food know that certain cows are not fit to be killed who bring more profit through dairy products; but there are also cows who do not give much profit and thus are fit to be killed.  Even the Vedic references where a cow is called ‘Aghnya’ cannot in any way be generalized for all the cows.</p>
<p>Consider the following mantra from Rigveda 1/164/27.</p>
<p>हिङकर्ण्वती वसुपत्नी वसूनां वत्समिछन्ती मनसाभ्यागात |</p>
<p>दुहामश्विभ्यां पयो अघ्न्येयं स वर्धतां महते सौभगाय ||</p>
<p><strong>“Making the ‘hin’ sound, the treasure queen, desiring the calf of treasures with her mind, has approached. Let this cow (aghnya) yield milk for the two Asvins, and may she grow for greater prosperity”</strong></p>
<p>This mantra is speaking about a particular cow which gives milk to the Asvins, the divine twin horsemen in the Rigveda. Again it is not a legal prohibition, but rather is a prayer to yiled milk for the Asvins. Moreover, classical Hindu commentators like Acharya Sayana interpret this verse and the one before it i.e. verse 26 in terms of metaphors of clouds, rain and the earth. He opines that the cow may be the rain cloud, the milk being the rain and the milker Vaayu, the god of wind who causes it to flow. The calf is the world longing for the rain to fall.</p>
<p>Thus, it will be incorrect to insist that this verse is speaking about all cows in the world, referring to them as ‘<strong>Aghnya</strong>‘. In order for anything to be prohibited it should be stated explicitly and without any ambiguity, This is the basis of all law. However, nothing on the lines of prohibition can be deduced from this verse and other verses where the word ‘<strong>Aghnya</strong>‘ exists.</p>
<p>But this one more important point I wish to share with regards to the meaning of the word ‘<strong>Aghnya</strong>‘. I agree that a meaning of ‘<strong>Aghnya</strong>‘ is ‘not fit to be killed’, however, this does not tell us the entire story. According to Yaska Acharya’s Nirukt, the word has two meanings as follows:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="398" height="41" class="wp-image-7627" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/alt.gif" alt="alt" /></p>
<p><strong>Aghnya means ‘not fit to be killed’ or ‘destroyer of sins‘</strong></p>
<p>Thus, we see why all the noise is being made on the first meaning of the word i.e. ‘not fit to be killed’; while the second meaning i.e. ‘destroyer of sins’ is being completely brushed under the carpet. This is a clear proof of intellectual dishonesty. Applying the second meaning to the verses where the word ‘Aghnya’ appears in the Vedas appears to be a more appealing prospect. Let us now read Rigveda 1/164/40 with this very meaning:</p>
<p>सूयवसाद भगवती हि भूया अथो वयं भगवन्तः सयाम |</p>
<p>अद्धि तर्णमघ्न्ये विश्वदानीं पिब शुद्धमुदकमाचरन्ती ||</p>
<p><strong>“O Aghnya (destroyer of sins), may you be rich in milk through abundant fodder; that we also may be rich (in abundance); eat grass at all seasons, and roaming (at will), drink pure water.”</strong></p>
<p>Notice that now this verse speaks nothing about not killing cows. A cow may be called ‘destroyer of sins’ due to the very fact that it was sacrificed as a burnt offering for cleansing a person’s sins. This is not a far fetched conclusion. However, the primary point is that in no terms in this verse and other verses like it implying any prohibition of cow slaughter. Even if ‘Aghnya’ is taken to mean ‘not fit to be killed’, it can only be taken to mean a particular kind of cow.</p>
<p>Thus, this argument also is not valid.</p>
<p>Some Hindus still try to show more mantras. which according to them, prohibit the killing of cows. However, when we look at those mantras, we find that they are again quoted out of context. One most commonly used mantra of that sort is Atharvaveda 1/16/4 which says,</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="712" height="129" class="wp-image-7628" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/28-4d9352092f.jpeg" alt="28-4d9352092f" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/28-4d9352092f.jpeg 712w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/28-4d9352092f-300x54.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 712px) 100vw, 712px" /></p>
<p><strong>“If you destroy a cow of ours, a human being, or a steed, We pierce you with this piece of lead so that you may not slay our men.”</strong></p>
<p>Even on a simple reading of this mantra, one cannot conlude that it is prohibiting killing cows for food. It is a merely threat for the enemies to not kill any cow, horse or people of the Vedic people so as to cause loss to them. For example, we know that chicken are bred in poultry farms so that they can later be sold in the market and people can consume them as food. Any owner of such a farm knows this. But still, if someone would want to harm his chicken unnecessarily, it would mean loss of wealth for him. As such he is ready to take protective action and ensure the safety of his chicken. He makes sure that no one steals any chicken from his farm to kill them, even though chicken are meant for food. So, he will ensure that such theieves are punished. Also, there is threat from many animals who might eat the chicken when he is unaware. For that he even kills the harmful animals to save his chicken. Consider that chicken owner saying, “if anyone will harm MY chicken, I will punish him”. Will the Hindutvavadis interpret his statement to mean that the chicken are not meant to be eaten? No. That would be totally ridiculous.</p>
<p>Similarly, in the verse of Atharvaveda, it is a threat of punishment for those who harm the cattle of Aryans. It is in no way a prohibition on slaughtering a cow for food. Considering all the evidences presented in this article, insisting that cows and other animals are not meant for food will be illogical.</p>
<h1><strong>Other evidences of beef eating</strong></h1>
<p>Brihadaranyak Upanishad 6/4/18 suggests a ‘super-scientific’ way of giving birth to a super intelligent child. It says,</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="423" height="135" class="wp-image-7629" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/29-7aabfeecd2.jpeg" alt="29-7aabfeecd2" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/29-7aabfeecd2.jpeg 423w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/29-7aabfeecd2-300x96.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 423px) 100vw, 423px" /></p>
<p><strong>“If a man wishes that a son should be born to him who will be a famous scholar, frequenting assemblies and speaking delightful words, a student of all the Vedas and an enjoyer of the full term of life, he should have rice cooked with the meat of a young bull or of one more advanced in years and he and his wife should eat it with clarified butter. Then they should be able to beget such a son.”</strong></p>
<p>Some Hindutvavadis try to play tricks even here by trying to twist the translation of few words like ‘Auksha’ and ‘Aarshabh”. They say they refer to certain medicinal plants and not a bull. To refute them, we are fortunate to have available the most ancient commentary on this mantra by none other than Adi Shankaracharya, revered by Hindus as the reviver of Hinduism in India and finishing off Buddhism and Jainism. Commenting on this verse he writes,</p>
<p>मांसमिक्षमोदनं मांसौदनम्. तन्मांसनियमार्थमाह – औक्षेण वा मांसेन. उक्षा सेचनसमर्थः पुंगवस्तदीयं मांसम्. रिषभस्ततो.अप्यधिकवयास्त दीयमार्षभं मांसम्.</p>
<p><strong>“Odan’ (rice) mixed with meat is called ‘Mansodan‘. On being asked whose meat it should be, he answers ‘Uksha‘. ‘Uksha‘ is used for an ox, which is capable to produce semen. Or the meat should be of a ‘Rishabh‘. ‘Rishabh’ is a bull more advanced in years than an ‘Uksha’.”</strong></p>
<p>Thus people trying to twist the mantras have no ground to stand on except deceit and fraud. This verse of Brihadaranyak Upanishad is clearly encouraging the eating of beef.</p>
<h1><strong>Animal Sacrifices in Mahabharata</strong></h1>
<p>The Anushasan Parv (Book 13); section 88 mentions many animal sacrifices which are can be done to please the Pitris (fathers). I will quote the significant sholkas</p>
<p>1 [य]
<p>किं सविद दत्तं पितृभ्यॊ वै भवत्य अक्षयम ईश्वर</p>
<p>किं हविश चिररात्राय किम आनन्त्याय कल्पते</p>
<p><strong>“Yudhishthira said, ‘O you of great puissance, tell me what that object is which, if dedicated to the Pitris, becomes inexhaustible! What Havi (oblation), again, (if offered) lasts for all time? What, indeed, is that which (if presented) becomes eternal?’”</strong></p>
[भ]
<p>5 दवौ मासौ तु भवेत तृप्तिर मत्स्यैः पितृगणस्य ह</p>
<p>तरीन मासान आविकेनाहुश चातुर्मास्यं शशेन तु</p>
<p>6 आजेन मासान परीयन्ते पञ्चैव पितरॊ नृप</p>
<p>वाराहेण तु षण मासान सप्त वै शाकुनेन तु</p>
<p>7 मासान अष्टौ पार्षतेन रौरवेण नवैव तु</p>
<p>गवयस्य तु मांसेन तृप्तिः सयाद दश मासिकी</p>
<p>8 मासान एकादश परीतिः पितॄणां माहिषेण तु</p>
<p>गव्येन दत्ते शराद्धे तु संवत्सरम इहॊच्यते</p>
<p>9 यथा गव्यं तथायुक्तं पायसं सर्पिषा सह</p>
<p>वाध्रीणसस्य मांसेन तृप्तिर दवादश वार्षिकी</p>
<p>10 आनन्त्याय भवेद दत्तं खड्गमांसं पितृक्षये</p>
<p>कालशाकं च लौहं चाप्य आनन्त्यं छाग उच्यते</p>
<p><strong>Bhishma said, “With fishes offered at Sraddhas, the Pitris remain gratified for a period of two months. With mutton they remain gratified for three months and with the flesh of the hare for four. With the flesh of the goat, O king, they remain gratified for five months, with bacon for six months, and with the flesh of birds for seven. With venison obtained from those deer that are called Prishata, they remain gratified for eight months, and with that obtained from the Ruru for nine months, and with the meat of the Gavaya for ten months. With the meat of the buffalotheir gratification lasts for eleven months. With beef presented at the Sraddha, their gratification, it is said, lasts for a full year. Payasa mixed with ghee is as much acceptable to the Pitris as beef. With the meat of the Vadhrinasa the gratification of the Pitris lasts for twelve years. The flesh of the rhinoceros, offered to the Pitris on the anniversaries of the lunar days on which they died, becomes inexhaustible.</strong></p>
<p>Clearly there can be no doubt that meat of all kinds was extensively used in sacrifice rituals to please one’s fathers who had died.</p>
<p>Sacrificial slaughter of cows is also  mentioned in Mahabharata, Shalya Parv, Section 41. A king called Rantidev is mentioned in the Vana Parv, section 207 as well as section 199, as follows</p>
<p>7 राज्ञॊ महानसे पूर्वं रन्तिदेवस्य वै दविज</p>
<p>दवे सहस्रे तु वध्येते पशूनाम अन्वहं तदा</p>
<p>8 समांसं ददतॊ हय अन्नं रन्तिदेवस्य नित्यशः</p>
<p>अतुला कीर्तिर अभवन नृपस्य दविजसत्तम</p>
<p><strong>“And in days of yore, O Brahmana, two thousand animals used to be killed every day in the kitchen of king Rantideva; and in the same manner two thousand cows were killed every day; and, O best of regenerate beings, king Rantideva acquired unrivalled reputation by distributing food with meat every day.”</strong></p>
<p>Some Hindus bigots try to claim that these are interpolation and later additions in Mahabharat. However, there is no evidence to conclude that. This is only a bogus claim of those who are unwilling to accept that their ancestors used to eat beef.</p>
<p>Nowadays an effort is being made in India to establish the society based on the principle of Manu, however, no clear-cut picture or its implementation is drawn out. It is interesting that the same Manu permits eating of meat and does not list the killing of cows in the major sins.</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 5/35 mentions,</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="682" height="39" class="wp-image-7630" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/alt-1.gif" alt="alt" /></p>
<p><strong>“But a man who, being duly engaged (to officiate or to dine at a sacred rite), refuses to eat meat, becomes after death an animal during twenty-one existences.”</strong></p>
<p>Manu Smriti 5/56 says</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="615" height="37" class="wp-image-7631" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/alt-2.gif" alt="alt" /></p>
<p><strong>“There is no sin in eating meat, in (drinking) spirituous liquor, and in carnal intercourse, for that is the natural way of created beings, but abstention brings great rewards.”</strong></p>
<h1><strong>The testimony of ancient Indian medical texts</strong></h1>
<p>Modern Hindus usually are seen boasting about India’s scientific heritage, especially of medical texts like <em>Charaka Samhita</em> and <em>Sushruta Samhita</em>, which they think are proof of the advancement of science in the ancient Hindu society. No doubt that like other nations of the word ancient Hindus too have contributed to our knowledge, epecially science and mathematics. I will now reveal before you the medicinal benefits of cow meat as enshrined in ancient Indian medical texts. I will not be commenting on the medical validity of the passages. They are only given to prove that cow meat was consumed.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="376" height="62" class="wp-image-7632" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/alt-3.gif" alt="alt" /></p>
<p><strong>“Cow meat is beneficial in curing breathing problems, Ozaena, Ague, dry cough, fatigue, diseases due to burns and marasmus.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Charaka Samhita, Sutra Sthaanam, 27/79-80]</strong></p>
<p>Charaka Samhita, Chikitsa Sthaanam 8/163 says,</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="416" height="71" class="wp-image-7633" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/alt-4.gif" alt="alt" /></p>
<p><strong>“A person of magnanimous heart who eats meat along with a wine named as ‘Maadhveek’, is quickly relieved of tuberculosis.</strong></p>
<p>Charaka Samhita, Chikitsa Sathaanam 8/165 says,</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="350" height="69" class="wp-image-7634" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/alt-5.gif" alt="alt" /></p>
<p><strong>“While consuming the above mentioned kinds of meat, one may have a dose of whichever wine is appropriate such as ‘Prasanna’, ‘Vaarooni’, ‘seedhu’, ‘arisht’, ‘aasava’ and ‘madhu’.”</strong></p>
<p>Besides the cow, meat of other animals is also prescribes for various diseases. For example, Sutra 158 of the same chapter says,</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="353" height="67" class="wp-image-7635" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/alt-6.gif" alt="alt" /></p>
<p><strong>“Meat of a peacock, patridge, rooster, goose, swine, camel, donkey, cow and buffalo is beneficial for developing one’s body.”</strong></p>
<p>Although there are numerous other references from Charaka Samhita prescribing meat for various other ddiseases, I feel the above mentioned passages are sufficient to prove that no meat was prohibited in ancient Indian society. It was freely taken as cure for various diseases and improving one’s health.</p>
<h1><strong>The testimony of classical scholars</strong></h1>
<p>To conclude my article establishing that the Vedas and the subsidiary texts permit beef eating as well as sacrificing animals, I will post the testimony of renowned classical Hindu scholars, besides the other notale scholars I have already quoted.</p>
<p><strong>1. Adi Shankaracharya</strong></p>
<p>Adi Shankaracharya has written an extensive commentary on the famous Brahma Sutras. In his commentary on Brahma Sutra Adhyaai 3, Paada 1, Sutra 25 he writes,</p>
<p><strong>“None therefore can know, without scripture, what is either right or wrong. Now from scripture we derive the certain knowledge that the gyotishtoma-sacrifice, which involves harm done to animals (i.e. the animal sacrifice), is an act of duty; how then can it be called unholy?–But does not the scriptural precept, ‘Do not harm any creature,’ intimate that to do harm to any being is an act contrary to duty?–True, but that is a general rule, while the precept, ‘Let him offer an animal to Agnîshomau,’ embodies an exception; and general rule and exception have different spheres of application. The work (i.e. sacrifice) enjoined by the Veda is therefore holy, being performed by authoritative men and considered blameless;”</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. Acharya Ramanuja</strong></p>
<p>Acharya Ramanuja also has written a very famed commentary on the Brahma Sutras called ‘Sri Bhasya’. Commenting on the same Sutra 25 he writes,</p>
<p><strong>“Scripture declares that the killing of sacrificial animals makes them to go up to the heavenly world, and therefore is not of the nature of harm. This is declared in the text, ‘The animal killed at the sacrifice having assumed a divine body goes to the heavenly world’; ‘with a golden body it ascends to the heavenly world.’ An action which is the means of supreme exaltation is not of the nature of harm, even if it involves some little pain; it rather is of beneficial nature.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. Sikand Swami</strong></p>
<p>This 7th century commentator of the Vedas, while commenting on Rigveda 1/1/4 writes,</p>
<p><strong>“Yajna is good for everyone, and no one is injured. The animals who are sacrificed, also gain ultimate good. The ancestors say, “the animals that are sacrificed in the Yajna, obtain the higher worlds”</strong></p>
<p>There must remain no doubt in the anyone’s mind after seeing all these testimonies that the Vedic religion permits beef eating and also sacrificing the animals is considered as an investment for greater good.</p>

<p>Written by Sulaiman Razvi</p>
<p>Meat especially that of cow is the centre of controversy in India. People are lynched and raped on rumours of beef consumption but such mentality didn&#8217;t exist in Vedic period, people in the Vedic period relished beef and meat of other animals. There are clear references in Vedas about meat consumption, but some Hindu scholars don&#8217;t translate it literally despite the fact that it is supported by other Hindu texts. Vedas no-where says that &#8216;You shouldn&#8217;t have meat&#8217;, Hindu scriptures doesn&#8217;t prohibit meat consumption, it&#8217;s only Hindu scholars that prohibits it. In the Vedas the cattle were gifted to other Deities, because it was a source of money during the Vedic period. A historian William Butler writes,</p>
<p>&#8220;The people among whom the Veda were composed, as here introduced to us, had evidently passed the nomadic stage. Their wealth consisted of Horses, Cattle, Sheep, Goats and Buffaloes. Coined money, and indeed money in any shape, was unknown. We meet but two allusions to gold, except for the purpose of ornaments. The cow was to the Vedic Hindu at once food and money.&#8221;<br />

<p>A recent survey found that 70% Indians are non-vegetarians. <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.in/2016/06/18/over-70-indians-are-meat-eaters-but-indian-tv-continues-to-vil/" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">http://www.huffingtonpost.in/2016/06/18/over-70-indians-are-meat-eaters-but-indian-tv-continues-to-vil/<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>While according to BBC report, just 20% of Indians are vegetarians,<br />
&#8220;But new research by US-based anthropologist Balmurli Natrajan and India-based economist Suraj Jacob, points to a heap of evidence that even these are inflated estimations because of &#8220;cultural and political pressures&#8221;. So people under-report eating meat &#8211; particularly beef &#8211; and over-report eating vegetarian food.<br />
Taking all this into account, say the researchers, only about 20% of Indians are actually vegetarian &#8211; much lower than common claims and stereotypes suggest.<br />
Hindus, who make up 80% of the Indian population, are major meat-eaters. Even only a third of the privileged, upper-caste Indians are vegetarian.&#8221;<br />

<p>Despite these facts Hindus views non-vegetarians especially Muslims as demons equivalent to cannibals. Hindu apologists says that veg diet is healthy and non-veg diet is unhealthy but they aren&#8217;t aware of the fact that veg diet doesn&#8217;t provide required amount of nutrients and there are several risks associated with veg diet, vegetarians suffer from B12 deficiency. Vitamin B12 is found in non-veg food and egg is a key source of vitamin B12. You may like to go through the following links,</p>

<p><strong>Hindu Scholars on Meat Consumption</strong></p>
<p>Swami Vivekananda writes that Aryans used to relish beef,</p>
<p>&#8220;There was a time in this very India when, without eating beef, no Brahmin could remain a Brahmin&#8221; The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda, Volume 3 <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Complete_Works_of_Swami_Vivekananda/Volume_3/Lectures_from_Colombo_to_Almora/Reply_to_the_Address_of_Welcome_at_Madura" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Complete_Works_of_Swami_Vivekananda/Volume_3/Lectures_from_Colombo_to_Almora/Reply_to_the_Address_of_Welcome_at_Madura<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>Adishankaracharya writes,</p>
<p>&#8220;Odan&#8217; (rice) mixed with meat is called &#8216;Mansodan&#8217;. On being asked whose meat it should be, he answers &#8216;Uksha&#8217;. &#8216;Uksha&#8217; is used for an ox, which is capable to produce semen. Or the meat should be of a &#8216;Rishabh&#8217;. &#8216;Rishabh&#8217; is a bull more advanced in years than an &#8216;Uksha&#8217;.&#8221; <strong>Adishankaracharya in his commentary on Brihadaranyak Upanishad 6/4/18</strong></p>
<p>Ramanujacharya writes,</p>
<p>&#8220;In the Agnisomiya sacrifice no real harm is caused to the animal victim; for according to the Vedic Texts, the victim —a goat, after abandoning an inferior body, will attain a higher rebirth, with a beautiful body. The Text pertaining to immolation declares: — &#8216;O animal, by this (immolation) you never die, you are not destroyed. You will pass through happy paths to the realm of the gods, where the virtuous, not the sinful reach. May the god Savitar give you a suitable place.&#8217; (Yajñ, 4.6.9.46; Taitt. Br. iii 7.2).<br />
Likewise the attainment of more beautiful bodies by those who die here in this war [which is like a sacrifice] has been declared in the Gita (2.22). Hence, just as a surgeon makes an incision and performs other surgical procedures for the purpose of curing a patient, the immolation of the sacrificial animal in the Agnisomiya and other sacrifices contributes to its welfare.&#8221; <strong>Ramanujaacharya in his commentary on Bhagavad Gita 2.32</strong></p>
<p>If you ask Hindus as to why we shouldn&#8217;t have meat, they give irrational answer, they say &#8216;We should not slaughter animals because animals feel pain&#8217;. This answer is not convincing and is only a shift of logic. Before it was discovered that even Plants have life they used to say &#8216;We should not slaughter animals because they have life&#8217; and now they started this &#8216;Animals feel pain&#8221; issue. Here are some excerpts from Hindu texts which shows how the logic was changed,</p>
<p>Mahabharat Book 13, Section 115 &#8220;… Thou hast said so while discoursing formerly upon the ordinances in respect of Sraddhas. How can meat, however, be procured without slaying a living creature…&#8221; Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Mahabharata Book 13, Section 116 &#8220;…Flesh cannot be had from grass or wood or stone. Unless a living creature is slain, it cannot be had. Hence is the fault in eating flesh&#8230;&#8221; Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Founder of Arya Samaj Swami Dayanand Saraswati writes in his book,</p>
<p>&#8220;It is childish to say that there is no sin in eating meat…for meat cannot be had without killing animals, and it can never be right to hurt or kill animals without an offence.- Satyarth Prakash, Swami Dayanand Saraswati, p.342, Tr. Chiranjiva Bhardwaj.</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 5.48. Meat can never be obtained without injury to living creatures, and injury to sentient beings is detrimental to (the attainment of) heavenly bliss; let him therefore shun (the use of) meat.</p>
<p>These passages doesn&#8217;t say that we shouldn&#8217;t have meat because they feel pain but it says that we should not slaughter animals because they have life, they are living creatures. However these passages shouldn&#8217;t be taken as prohibition for meat consumption because Vedic deities used to consume beef every day, but meat consumption appears occasionally, i.e., for sacrifices in later texts. Manu Smriti 5.48 is explained in Vasistha Dharma Shastra 4.5-8 and Mahabharata 13.116 permits meat consumption on the condition that it is first offered to the gods and Pitrs (ancestors). I have explained those verses from Manu Smriti in this article. Researchers have found that even plants feel pain,</p>
<p>Researchers Have Found That Plants Know They Are Being Eaten<br />

<p>Bad news for vegetarians! Plants can ‘hear’ themselves being eaten &#8211; and become defensive when attacked<br />

<p>Indian scientist Jagdish Chandra Bose was one of the first scientist to discover that plants feel pain.<br />
<a href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/education/story/jagadish-chandra-bose-proved-plants-have-life/1/664259.html" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">http://indiatoday.intoday.in/education/story/jagadish-chandra-bose-proved-plants-have-life/1/664259.html<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>Doctors say that meat of fish, chicken and egg are very good for health then why should anyone abstain from it? Although it&#8217;s proved that even plants have life and feels pain but if vegan Hindus don&#8217;t eat meat merely because animals feel pain then will they eat egg? Egg doesn&#8217;t feel pain when you make omelette from it or boil it, so will Brahmins eat egg if the issue is all about pain? If the issue is about pain then will they be okay with slaughtering animals after proper anaesthesia is administered?</p>

<h3><a id="post-6065-Buddhism-Jainism"></a>Influence of Buddhism and Jainism on Hinduism</h3>
<p>Hundreds and thousands of animals were slaughtered as per Hindu texts. But animal slaughter became a taboo in Hindu society only after Hinduism was influenced by other religions like Buddhism and Jainism.</p>
<p>Swami Prabhupada the founder of ISKCON writes in the commentary of Bhagwad Purana 1.3.24,</p>
<p>&#8220;…Lord Buddha superficially denied the authority of the Vedas. This rejection of the Vedas by Lord Buddha was adopted in order to save people from the vice of animal-killing as well as to save the poor animals from the slaughtering process of their big brothers who clamor for universal brotherhood, peace, justice and equity. There is no justice when there is animal-killing. Lord Buddha wanted to stop it completely, and therefore his cult of ahimsa was propagated not only in India but also outside the country…&#8221; <strong>Swami Prabhupada on Bhagwad Purana 1.3.24</strong> [ <a href="http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_1.3.24" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_1.3.24<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> ]
<p>So Buddha rejected the authority of Vedas because Vedas sanctions animal slaughter and Hindus of his time sacrificed animals and he wanted them to stop this Vedic practice. Swami Vivekananda is of the same view. He writes,</p>
<p>&#8220;In what way do you see this importance of Buddhism in India today?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;It is obvious and overwhelming. You see India never loses anything; only she takes time to turn everything into bone and muscle. Buddha dealt a blow at animal sacrifice from which India has never recovered; and Buddha said, &#8216;Kill no cows&#8217;, and cow-killing is an impossibility with us.&#8221; <strong>The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda, Volume 5</strong><br />
<a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Complete_Works_of_Swami_Vivekananda/Volume_5/Interviews/Reawakening_Of_Hinduism_On_A_National_Basis" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Complete_Works_of_Swami_Vivekananda/Volume_5/Interviews/Reawakening_Of_Hinduism_On_A_National_Basis<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>Some scholars also say that people during Buddha&#8217;s time misinterpreted Vedas and started slaughtering animals in Vedic Yajnas, so to stop animal slaughter Buddha completely rejected the Vedas and established anti-Vedic philosophy called Buddhism. My question is, if Vedas do not sanction animal slaughter and people only misinterpreted the Vedas then why didn&#8217;t Buddha the avatar of Vishnu (as per Hinduism) revive the Vedas? Why wasn&#8217;t he born as a revivalist who should&#8217;ve correctly interpreted the meaning of the Vedas?</p>
<p>Following verses from Skanda Purana shows that animal slaughter was prevalent in 10<sup>th</sup> century during the reign of Kumarapala,</p>
<p>Skanda Purana III.ii.36.62 &#8220;[Kumarapala said] O Brahmanas, I shall not abide and honour the Royal Charter issued by Rama. I disown the Brahmanas who indulge in violence and kill animals in Yajna. There is no question of my having any respect for and devotion to these killers.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Kumarapala was a 10th century A.D king who had embraced Jainism, This shows that Brahmins were engaged in slaughtering animals in 10th century also. There is a story of another king named Vena who had also embraced Jainism and stopped animal slaughter in Vedic Yajnas,</p>
<p>Padma Purana II.37.32b-42 &#8220;[The sinful one said] I shall tell you another fierce act (mentioned) in the Vedas. When a guest goes (ie. arrives) to the house, a brahmana (kills and) cooks (the flesh of) a goat. (They kill) a horse in a horse- sacrifice, and a bull in a bull sacrifice; a man in human sacrifice and goats in a Vajapeya sacrifice. O great king, a great slaughter of many animals is done at a Rajasuya sacrifice. At a Pundarika sacrifice one would kill (i.e. one kills) an elephant, and at an elephant sacrifice (they kill) an elephant. At the Sautramani sacrifice a beast is seen to be fit for being sacrificed. Thus, O prince, listen how at rites of various forms of killing of beasts of various species is laid down…&#8221; Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p>Buddhism and Jainism were wiped out from India by Hindu kings and scholars probably because of their dominance and confrontation with Hinduism. Animal slaughter in Vedic sacrifices and rituals was often the main topic of debate between Buddhist/Jain and Brahmins where Buddhist/Jains had some valid points against Brahmin beliefs. Vishnu Purana says that demons after embracing Buddhism and Jainism started criticizing animal slaughter sanctioned by the Vedas, One of the main point raised by Buddhist/Jain converts was,</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 3.18.21-30 “The delusions of the false teacher paused not with the conversion of the Daityas to the Jaina and Bauddha heresies, but with various erroneous tenets he prevailed upon others to apostatize, until the whole were led astray, and deserted the doctrines and observances inculcated by the three Vedas. Some then spake evil of the sacred books; some blasphemed the gods; some treated sacrifices and other devotional ceremonies with scorn; and others calumniated the Brahmans. &#8220;The precepts,&#8221; they cried, &#8220;that lead to the injury of animal life (as in sacrifices) are highly reprehensible. To say that casting butter into flame is productive of reward, is mere childishness. If Indra, after having obtained godhead by multiplied rites, is fed upon the wood used as fuel in holy fire, he is lower than a brute, which feeds at least upon leaves. If an animal slaughtered in religious worship is thereby raised to heaven, would it not be expedient for a man who institutes a sacrifice to kill his own father for a victim? If that which is eaten by one at a Śráddha gives satisfaction to another, it must be unnecessary for one who resides at a distance to bring food for presentation in person.&#8221; Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Swami Dayanand Saraswati also writes about this,</p>
<p>&#8220;Eleven arguments in favored by the Charvaka Faith</p>
<p>3.&#8221;If the animal offered as sacrifice goes to heaven, why does not the Yajmana (master of ceremonies) send his parents, etc., to heaven, by killing them by way of sacrifice.&#8221; <strong>Satyarth Prakash, Ch 11, page 508, by Swami Dayanand Saraswati, Tr. Chiranjiva Bhardwaja</strong></p>
<p>Dayanand replies to this argument in the following way,</p>
<p>&#8220;3, 4, 5. The Veda and other Shaastras do not at all sanction animal sacrifice; the practice of offering oblations to the manes of departed ancestors is an invention of priests, because it is opposed to the Vedic and Shaastric teachings and finds sanction only in the Puraana like the Bhagvat. We have, therefore, nothing to say against the refutation of this doctrine.&#8221; <strong>Satyarth Prakash, Ch 11, page 509, by Swami Dayanand Saraswati, Tr. Chiranjiva Bhardwaja</strong></p>
<p>Swami Dayanand Saraswati cleverly tries to get rid of it by saying there is no sanction in Vedas. It&#8217;s true that Shraddha to Pitrs (ancestors) is not mentioned in Vedas but oblation to departed ancestors is mentioned in Shastras and animal slaughter is mentioned in Vedas and supported by other texts like Brahmanas, Puranas so there is no way out but to accept that Vedas permits animal slaughter. All these verses shows that Hindus used to slaughter animals till Buddhism and Jainism became prevalent and also shows that Hinduism was later influenced by these religions and adopted vegetarianism and later on animal slaughter was considered sinful in Hindu society.</p>

<p>Rig Veda 1.162.2-3 What time they bear before the Courser, covered with trappings and with wealth, the grasped oblation, the dappled goat goeth straightforward, bleating, to the place dear to Indra and to Pūṣan. Dear to all Gods, this goat, the share of Pūṣan, is first led forward with the vigorous Courser, while Tvaṣṭar sends him forward with the Charger, acceptable for sacrifice, to glory.</p>

<p>मेष [Mesha] = Ram/Sheep.</p>
<p>पचत [Pachat] = Cooked</p>
<p>Above is Shri Ram Sharma&#8217;s Hindi translation.</p>
<p>Apologist present some verses which according to them prohibits meat consumption but those verses are quoted out of context, those verses have historical context, for instance it&#8217;s mentioned in the Vedas</p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.87.16 The <strong>fiend</strong> [non Aryan, Dasyu, Rakshas, Mleccha] who smears himself with flesh of cattle, with flesh of horses and of human bodies, Who steals the milch-cow&#8217;s milk away, O Agni,-tear off the heads of such with fiery fury.</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 1.16.4 If thou [Foreigners] destroy a cow of ours, a human being, or a steed, We pierce thee with this piece of lead so that thou mayst not slay our men.</p>
<p>These verses refer to the foreigners/Non Aryans [Maleccha, Rakshasa] or enemies of deities of Vedic period, that they should not kill the Aryans, cows or horses OF THE Aryans as Cows and Horses were sources of wealth and horses were also used for warfare, you can have meat of other castes or of foreigners (non Aryans). Who would like their wealth to be destroyed? Just like stealing milk of cow is wrong similarly killing animals belonging to other people is considered sinful in those verses. The verse Rig Veda 10.87.16 also prohibits stealing milk but it doesn&#8217;t mean that you shouldn&#8217;t consume milk, you can have milk after buying it similarly you can have meat after buying meat or animal. There may be some confusion among Hindus whether to eat cow or not but there is hardly any prohibition in Vedas to slaughter bull although Vedas do not prohibit any kind of meat.</p>
<p>Some Hindus might say those verses I mentioned above has historical context but they shouldn&#8217;t be viewed in a context as all verses are eternal and it&#8217;s applicable for all ages. Does that mean you should eat dog&#8217;s intestines when you are in deep distress? Because the Vedas says,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 4.18.13 In deep distress I cooked a dog&#8217;s intestines. Among the Gods I found not one to comfort. My consort I beheld in degradation. The Falcon then brought me the pleasant Soma.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="473" height="105" class="wp-image-6075" src="http://vedkabhed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/http-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-2016-8.png" alt="http://truthabouthinduism.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/112016_1617_meat9.png" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/http-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-2016-8.png 473w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/07/http-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-2016-8-300x67.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 473px) 100vw, 473px" /></p>
<p>This verse has a historical context which I am not going to explain, does that mean you should eat dog&#8217;s intestines when you are anxious?</p>
<p>The reason why it&#8217;s difficult to find verses on meat consumption in the Vedas (from few Hindu translators) is because some Hindu scholars don&#8217;t view the animal sacrifice as literal slaughtering but they view it as charity or symbolic slaughtering. So Hindus should ask their scholars to literally translate the Sanskrit verses on meat consumption and I am sure all their doubts on meat eating will be cleared. Vedic verses clearly uses words like Mamsa (Meat), Pachat (Cook) etc., Which is pretty clear for meat consumption but some Hindu scholars likes to add their own words into it, they give their own meanings.</p>
<p>Some Hindu apologists might say Yajnas does not contain killing, Yajnas are non-violent etc.,  But they cannot deny the fact that the animals which were brought as oblation were thrown into the fire,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.91.14-15 He [Agni/Fire] <strong>in whom</strong> horses, bulls, oxen, and barren cows, and rams, when duly set apart, are <strong>offered up</strong>,- To Agni, Soma-sprinkled, drinker of sweet juice, Disposer, with my heart I bring a fair hymn forth. Into thy [Agni&#8217;s] mouth is poured <strong>the offering</strong>, Agni, as Soma into cup, oil into ladle…</p>

<p>Manu Smriti 3.76 An oblation duly thrown into the fire, reaches the sun; from the sun comes rain, from rain food, therefrom the living creatures (derive their subsistence).</p>
<p>Rig Veda 3.59.5 The great Aditya, to be served with worship, who stirreth men, is gracious to the singer. To Mitra, him most highly to be lauded, offer in fire [the] oblation that he loveth.</p>

<p>Satapatha Brahmana 6.2.1.14 Now when he slaughters those animals, he prepares a home for Agni; for nowhere but in his home does one enjoy himself. But the home means food: it is that he lays down in, front, and when Agni sees that, he turns unto him.</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana 11:7:1:1- He performs the animal sacrifice. Now the animal sacrifice means cattle: thus, when he performs the animal sacrifice (pasubandha, the binding of the animal), it is in order that he may be possessed of cattle…And when he performs the animal sacrifice, he renews his fires, and so, along with the renewal of his fires, does the Sacrificer (renew himself), and along with the Sacrificer his house and cattle. And beneficial to life, indeed, is that redemption of his own self; for whilst he is offering the Sacrificer&#8217;s fires long for flesh; they set their minds on the Sacrificer and harbour designs on him. In other fires people do indeed cook any kind of meat, but these (sacrificial fires) have no desire for any other flesh but this (sacrificial animal), and for him to whom they belong.</p>
<p>Asvalayana Grihya Sutra, IV Adhyaya, 8 Kandika, 25 &#8220;The husks and chaff (of the rice), the tail, the skin, the head, the feet (of the sacrificial animal) he should throw into the fire.</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 20.79 O Agni [Fire], within thy mouth is poured the offering, as Soma into cup, ghee into ladle…</p>

<p>Read Rig Veda 1.162.19 which I have mentioned above which talks about meat balls of horse put into the fire, We can obtain meat balls only after killing the horse, So it is a undeniable fact that animals were killed in the Yajna.  As I said earlier Hindu scholars don&#8217;t view the sacrifice as literal for instance Veda says</p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.104.3 To make thee [Indra] start, a strong true draught I offer to thee, the Bull [as a oblation], O thou whom Bay Steeds carry.</p>
<p>Rig Veda 5.29.8 When thou [Indra] three hundred buffaloes&#8217; flesh hadst eaten, and drunk, as Maghavan, three lakes of Soma, All the Gods raised as &#8217;twere a shout of triumph to Indra praise because he slew the Dragon.</p>
<p>I have given the Hindi translation of Rig Veda 5.29.8 by Pundit Ram Govind Trivedi. Some scholars have skipped the Sanskirt word Maas (Meat/Flesh) in their translation, A Hindu scholar Ram Acharya has translated the verse 5.29.8 as Indra &#8221;ACCEPTED&#8221; the three hundred buffaloes instead of &#8220;Eaten&#8221; he has also omitted the word Maas (Flesh/Meat), even if he just accepted the buffaloes then it means later he ate them because Veda commands Indra and Agni to eat the oblation which they receive,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.116.8 Eat, Indra, <strong>these oblations which approach thee</strong>: be pleased with food made ready and with Soma.</p>

<p>Rig Veda 2.1.13-14 The A&#8217;dityas have made thee, Agni, their mouth; the pure (deities) have made thee, Kavi, their tongue: the (gods), the givers of wealth, depend upon thee at sacrifices; they eat the offered oblation through thee [Agni]. All the benignant immortal gods eat the offered oblation through thee, as their mouth: mortals taste the flavour (of all viands) through thee: thou art born pure, the embryo of plants.</p>

<p>Indra, Agni and other gods were commanded to eat the offered oblations, therefore they did consume meat. In Vedas, there are two more verses about bulls brought for sacrifice,</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 9.4.9 …that Brahman gives a thousand who offers up the Bull as his oblation.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="481" height="93" class="wp-image-6082" src="http://vedkabhed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/http-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-2016-15.png" alt="http://truthabouthinduism.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/112016_1617_meat16.png" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/http-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-2016-15.png 481w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/07/http-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-2016-15-300x58.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 481px) 100vw, 481px" /></p>

<p>We have already read that the cattle which were brought as oblation/offerings were put in the fire and later on eaten, so it is a pretty much clear that Hindu deities used to partake beef.</p>
<p>Hindu extremists make so much hue and cry over cow slaughter today but cow slaughter was a common practice in Vedic period,</p>
<p>Krishna Yajur Veda 2.5.5.3-4 On the full moon (the Soma) is pressed for the gods; during this half-month it is pressed forth for them, and a cow for Mitra and Varuna is to be slaughtered for them at the new moon. In that he sacrifices on the day before…In that he sacrifices at the new moon with clotted curds for Mitra and Varuna, the cow which is slaughtered for the gods becomes his also.</p>
<p>Krishna Yajur Veda 2.2.9.6 At the time of the (offering of the) cow, he should offer on one potsherd to Mitra and Varuna, this (offering) corresponds to his foe&#8217;s cow which is to be slaughtered</p>
<p>Krishna Yajur Veda 5.1.8 …if he were to let them go after circumambulation with fire, he would disturb the sacrifice; if he were to keep them until the conclusion, the heads would be exhausted; in that he offers the animals, he wins thereby animals; in that he lets them go after circumambulation with fire, (it serves) to prevent the exhaustion of the heads; he concludes (the rite) with (an animal) for Prajapati; Prajapati is the sacrifice; verily he concludes the sacrifice in the sacrifice…</p>

<h3><a id="post-6065-Ashvamedha-Yajna"></a>Ashvamedha Yajna</h3>
<p>Veda clearly speaks of animal killing and putting it in the Agni (Fire) during Yajna, one of the most popular hymn about animal slaughter is from the Rig Veda about Horse sacrifice (Ashvamedha Yajna). Ashvamedha mentioned in Rig Veda deals with slaughtering and cooking of the sacrificial horse. I am using English translation of H.H Wilson and Hindi translation of Pundit Ram Govind Trivedi,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.162.9 “Whatever the flies may eat of the raw flesh of the horse; whatever (grease) is smeared upon the brush or upon the axe ; (what is smeared) upon the hands or the nails of the immolator, may all this be with thee, (horse), among the gods.” Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>

<p>Rig Veda 1.162.10 Whatever undigested grass fall from his belly ; whatever particle&#8221; <strong>of raw flesh</strong> may remain let the immolators make the whole free from defect, and so cook the pure (offering) that it may be perfectly dressed.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s see what other scriptures says about Horse Sacrifice</p>
<p>Krishna Yajur Veda 5.4.12.1 It is the twenty onefold day, <strong>on which the horse is slain</strong>, there are twelve months, five seasons; these worlds are three</p>
<p>Krishna Yajur Veda 5.3.12. The eye of Prajapati swelled, that fell away, that became a horse; because it swelled (áçvayat), that is the reason why the horse (áçva) has its name. By the horse sacrifice the gods replaced it. He who sacrifices with the horse sacrifice makes Prajapati whole; verily he becomes whole; this is the atonement for everything, and the cure for everything. All evil by it the gods overcame; by it also the gods overcame (the sins of) Brahman- slaying; all evil [1] he overcomes, he overcomes Brahman-slaying who sacrifices with the horse sacrifice, and he who knows it thus. It was the left eye of Prajapati that swelled; therefore they cut off from the horse on the left side, on the right from other animals. The mat is of reeds; the horse has its birthplace in the waters, the reed is born in the waters; verily he establishes it in its own birthplace. The Stoma is the fourfold one; the bee tore the thigh of the horse, the gods made it whole with the fourfold Stoma; in that there is the fourfold Stoma, (it is) to make whole the horse.</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagawatam (Bhagvad Purana) 4.19.11 “When Pṛthu Mahārāja was performing the last horse sacrifice [aśvamedha-yajña], King Indra, invisible to everyone, stole the horse intended for sacrifice. He did this because of his great envy of King Pṛthu.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Commentary: &#8220;King Indra is known as śata-kratu, which indicates that he has performed one hundred horse sacrifices (aśvamedha-yajña). We should know, however, that the animals sacrificed in the yajña were not killed. If the Vedic mantras were properly pronounced during the sacrifice, the animal sacrificed would come out again with a new life.&#8221; <strong>Swami Prabhupada on Srimad Bhagavatam 4.19.11</strong></p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana 11.2.5.1. And, verily, even on this occasion, they slaughter the sacrificial horse (Asvamedha) as a sacrifice to the gods…</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana 13:2:1:1-2 Pragâpati assigned the sacrifices to the gods; the Asvamedha he kept for himself. The gods said to him, &#8216;Surely, this–to wit, the Asvamedha–is a sacrifice: let us have a share in that also.&#8217; He contrived these Anna-homas (food-oblations) for them: thus when he performs the Annahomas, it is the gods he thereby gratifies. With ghee he makes offering, for ghee is fiery mettle: by means of fiery mettle he thus lays fiery mettle into him (the horse and Sacrificer). With ghee he offers; for that–to wit, ghee–is the gods&#8217; favourite resource: it is thus with their favourite resource he supplies them.</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana 11:2:5:5 Verily, then, for him who, knowing this, offers both the Agnihotra and the Full and New-moon sacrifices, they slaughter the sacrificial horse month by month; and month by month the Asvamedha is offered for him, and his Agnihotra and Full and New-moon sacrifices come to pass into the Asvamedha.</p>
<p>Valmiki Ramayan Bala Kanda 1, Sarga 14, Verses 33-38 “With great delight coming on her Queen Kausalya reverently made circumambulations to the horse, and symbolically killed the horse with three knives. Queen Kausalya desiring the results of ritual disconcertedly resided one night with that horse that flew away like a bird…Then the priest, one with controlled senses and rich in scriptural wealth, took up the omentum [fat] of the horse and cooked it as per scriptures while dropping into the altar of fire to bake as a food to the celestials…Those remaining body parts that horse are there, the sixteen officiating priests have procedurally oblated all of them into fire.” Tr. Desiraju Hanumanta Rao</p>
<p>Brahma Purana 104.137 &#8220;After performing these tasks Rama the most excellent among the virtuous performed ten horse-sacrifices where flesh was offered to the deities.&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Swami Vivekananda and Swami Dayanand Saraswati said that whatever from the Puranas (or other text also) contradicts the Vedas then it must be rejected without any mercy. And verses from Shatapatha Brahmana and Puranas confirms that the horse was slaughtered in Ashvamedha Yajna. So there is no way that apologists can now twist verses from Vedas about Horse-sacrifice.</p>

<h3><a id="post-6065-Cows-Guests"></a>Killing cows and offering its meat to guests</h3>
<p>Cattle were slaughtered for guests. But as per Swami Vivekananda this practise was later stopped. Sometimes we may wonder how an animal like cow became so sacred that Hindus started worshiping it and also prohibited its slaughter. When you ask any Hindu why he considers the Cow to be his Mother, he will tell you that &#8216;Since cow gives us milk, we consider it to be our mother&#8217;.</p>
<p>In the Vedas even the earth is considered a Mother. The reason for this may be because food grows from the soil. So Hindus considers all such things to be their mother whichever provides them with food. As we have already read some references about cattle used as source of money and ploughing the fields. It could be that people in ancient India heavily relied on Agriculture. Many farmers in India still plough fields with the help of Bulls and Cows. So killing cattle would result in heavy loss for such people, thus the prohibition of killing cows may have enacted. Swami Vivekananda writes,</p>
<p>&#8220;you read in the Vedas how, when a Sannyasin, a king, or a great man came into a house, the best bullock was killed. How in time it was found that as we were an agricultural race, killing the best bulls meant annihilation of the race. Therefore the practice was stopped, and a voice was raised against the killing of cows. Sometimes we find existing then what we now consider the most horrible customs.&#8221; <strong>The Complete Works of Swami Vivekandan, Volume 3</strong><br />

<p>Hindu scriptures commands to slaughter cattle or goat for the guests,</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti 51.64 When honoring a guest, at a sacrifice, or when worshipping the manes, or the gods, a man may slay cattle, but not otherwise on any account.</p>
<p>Sankhayana Grihya Sutra 2.15.1-3 Should any one of the six persons (mentioned in the Srauta-sutra and in the Sutras 4-9) to whom the Arghya reception is due, visit (him), let him make (ready) a cow, a goat, or what (sort of food) he thinks most like (thereto). Let the Argha not be without flesh. On the occasion of a sacrifice and of a wedding let (the guest) say, &#8216;Make it (ready).&#8217;</p>
<p>Kausitaki Brahmana 1.15 …Just as in the world when a human king has come, or another deserving person, they slay an ox or a cow that miscarries; so for him they slay in that they kindle the fire, for Agni is the victim of the gods.</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana 3:4:1:2. Now as to why it is called &#8216;guest-offering.&#8217; He, the purchased Soma, truly comes as his (the sacrificer&#8217;s) guest,–to him (is offered) that (hospitable reception): even as for a king or a Brâhman one would cook a large ox or a large he-goat–for that is human (fare offered to a guest), and the oblation is that of the gods–so he prepares for him that guest-offering.</p>
<p>Asvalayana Grihya Sutra 1.24.33 Let the Madhuparka not be without flesh, without flesh.</p>
<p>Madhuparka means offerings to the guest. Krishna tells Yuddhisthira,</p>
<p>Mahabharata Book 14, Section 2 “…And then Kesava (Krishna) accosted him,&#8211;&#8216;If a person indulges excessively in sorrow for his departed forefathers, he grieves them. (Therefore, banishing grief), do thou (now) celebrate many a sacrifice with suitable presents to the priests; and do thou gratify the gods with Soma liquor, and the manes of thy forefathers with their due food and drink. Do thou also gratify thy guests with meat and drink and the destitute with gifts commensurate with their desires…” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>On the occasion of Rukmini&#8217;s marriage with Krishna, Rukmi tells his father to slaughter a lakh cows, two lakh deers, 4 lakhs of rabbits and tortoise, ten lakhs of goats and 40 lakhs of sheep,</p>
<p>Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Krishna Janma Khanda 105. 47-67 &#8220;Get also slaughtered a lakh of cows, two lakhs of deer, 4 lakhs of rabbits and tortoise. Reverentially sacrifice to the village goddess on the night of the ful moon ten lakhs of goats and sheep four times the number of the last named and get the flesh properly cooked for food. O lord of the world, get also vegetables cooked for the purpose. The monarch Bhismaka having heard the words of his son took his family priest aside and also sent a suitable Brahmin to Dwarka. He fixed a date which was regarded auspicious unanimously&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Rajendra Nath Sen</p>
<p>Cow is also called Aghnya, Yaska in Nirukta has given two definitions for this word, one is that cow is not to be killed and another one is that cow is called Aghnya because it is a destroyer of sins. Cow is destroyer of sin because sacrificing it emancipates ones sins,</p>
<p>Grihya Sutra of Hiranyakesin I Prasna, 4 Patala, 14 Section, verses 11-16 &#8220;That (cow is either killed or let loose. If he chooses to let it loose, (he murmurs), &#8216;This cow will become a milch cow&#8217;&#8230;If it shall be killed, (he says), &#8216;A cow art thou; sin is driven away from thee. Drive away my sin and the sin of N.N.! Kill ye him whoever hates me. He is killed whosoever hates me. Make (the cow) ready!&#8217; If (the cow) is let loose, a meal is prepared with other meat, and he announces it (to the guest) in the words, &#8216;It is ready!&#8217; He replies, &#8216;It is well prepared; it is Virag; it is food. May it not fail! May I obtain it&#8230;Give food to the Brahmanas!&#8217; After those (Brahmanas) have eaten, (the hose) orders blameless (?) food to be brought to him (i.e. to the guest).</p>
<p>Scholars have opined that milch cows were not slaughtered and only barren cows were slaughtered as slaughtering milch cows would result in heavy loss.</p>

<h3><a id="post-6065-Meat-Consumption"></a>Meat consumption in other Hindu scriptures</h3>
<p>Hindu text even permits the meat of cow,</p>
<p>Apastamba Dharma Shastra Prasna I, Patala 5, Khanda 17, 30-31 (But the meat) of milch-cows and oxen may be eaten. The Vâgasaneyaka declares &#8216;bull&#8217;s flesh is fit for offerings.&#8217; 37. Five-toed animals (ought not to be eaten) with the exception of the iguana, the tortoise, the porcupine, the hedgehog, the rhinoceros, the hare, and the Pûtikhasha.</p>
<p>Vasistha Dharma Shastra 14.46. It is declared in the Vâgasaneyaka, that (the flesh of) milch-cows and oxen is fit for offerings.</p>
<p>Hinduism also permits meat of the following animals, birds and fishes,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 5.18 The porcupine, the hedgehog, the iguana, the rhinoceros, the tortoise, and the hare they declare to be eatable; likewise those (domestic animals) that have teeth in one jaw only, excepting camels.</p>
<p>Padma Purana III.56.31b-46 &#8220;&#8230;O best ones, Prajapati Manu has said that these animals with five claws may be always eaten: alligator, tortoise, hare, rhinoceros, porcupine. He may also eat fish with scales, and the flesh of (the deer called) ruru after having presented them to deities and brahmanas, and not otherwise. O best brahmanas, so also (the flesh of) a peacock, a patridge, a pigeon, a cataka, rhinoceros, a crane, a swan. Thus said Prajapati (Manu). These fish, viz. (the glittering fish) saphari, simhatunda, pathina and rohita are directed as fit to be eaten. With a desire (to retain the status) as a twice-born he should eat the flesh of these after it is sprinkled over; even if he is about to loose his life he should duly use it. He should not at all eat flesh. He who eats what remains, is not smeared (with sin). If he is weak, he should eat flesh as medicine, or by an order or for sacrificial purposes. He, who would give up flesh when invited at a sraddha or a rite in honour of a deity, goes to (i.e. lives) in hell for as many years as the number of hair of the beast&#8230;&#8221; Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p>Agni Purana 168.12-23 &#8220;&#8230;Animals having five nails such as the Shallaki, the Godha, the rhinoceros, and the tortoise are clean animals; and accordingly their flesh may be taken without any impunity. Flesh of animals other than the five mentioned in the preceding line, should be deemed impure. There is no harm in eating such fishes as Pathin, Rohita, and Sinhatunda&#8230;&#8221; Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Yajnavalkya Smriti verse 177-8 Of the five toed animals, the porcupine the iguana-lizard, the tortoise, the hedge-hog; and the hare; among fishes the Simhatundaka and the Rohita. So also the pathina, the Rajiva, the sasalka may be eaten by the twice born classes.</p>
<p>Brahma Purana 113.111-2 &#8220;The following can be eaten: hare, tortoise, alligator, porcupine and the fish with darts (?) The village boar and the cock should be avoided. In the following circumstances, even if one eats meat, one is not defiled: if it is the remnant of offerings unto the Pitrs, Devas etc. or if it is cooked in Sraddha at the request of the brahmins and is sprinkled with the holy water or if it is taken as a medicine.&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Vamana Purana 15.2-3 &#8220;Rice cooked well with oil or ghee, even if it be stored for a long time is fit to be eaten. Rice without any oil or ghee, and delicate preparations of milk, meat of the rabbit, porcupine, alligator, hedgehog, fish and tortoise, pulses and similar other things are fit to be eaten, said Manu.&#8221; Tr. Ananda Swarup Gupta</p>
<p>Paraskara Grihya Sutra III Kanda, 10 Kandika, 48 On the eleventh day he should give to an uneven number of Brahmanas a meal at which meat is served.</p>
<p>Sankha Samhita 13.25 &#8220;A Sraddha ceremony performed by offering oblations of Vala Sakas, bird&#8217;s flesh, the flesh of a rhinoceros, or a large-scaled fish, bears infinite fruit. This is the opinion of Yama, the law-giver.&#8221; Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Sankha Samhita 17.22 &#8220;Golden coloured godhas, tortoises, porcupines, hares, although they belong to the group of five nailed creatures, are animals whose flesh may be eaten; but having killed of any of these animals, one should practise the above-said penance.&#8221; Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Sankha Samhita 17.27 &#8220;Pheasants, peacocks, Lavaakas, Kapinjaras, Vartakas, and Bardhrinasas are birds, whose flesh, according to holy Yama, may be always eaten.&#8221; Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Usana Samhita 3.107 &#8220;This Sraddha is called Pindanvaharyakam. In the afternoon of the day, when the waning of the Moon takes place, the twice-born should perform it with sanctified fish and meat.&#8221; Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Manu Smriti clearly allow consumption of meat,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 5.29  What is destitute of motion is the food of those endowed with locomotion; (animals)  without fangs (are the food) of those with fangs, those without hands of those who possess hands, and the timid of the bold.</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 5.30 The eater who daily even devours those destined to be his food, commits no sin; for the creator himself created both the eaters and those who are to be eaten (for those special purposes).</p>
<p>Above Manu Smriti verse might sound contradicting to other verse of Manu which says,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 5.41 On offering the honey-mixture (to a guest), at a sacrifice and at the rites in honour of the manes, but on these occasions <strong>only</strong>, may an animal be slain; that (rule) Manu proclaimed.</p>
<p>What some Hindu apologists do is they quote these two verse and says &#8220;See these two verses are contradicting each other, one says we can slaughter animals only on occasions but other says we can slaughter animals daily so this proves Manu Smriti is interpolated&#8221; It&#8217;s so easy to say fake translation and Manu Smriti is corrupted to escape the argument, But the next verse explains it,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 5.32 He who eats meat, <strong>when he honours the gods and manes</strong>, commits no sin, whether he has bought it, or himself has killed (the animal), or has received it as a present from others.</p>
<p>So the condition to eat the meat is, he should honor the god, if he doesn&#8217;t then it&#8217;s a minor offense.</p>
<p>Internet Arya Samajis considers Manu Smriti to be unauthentic. Manu Smriti is the second most authentic scripture of Arya Samaj, Vedas are the most sacred Sruti and the Manu Smriti is the most authentic Smriti, Swami Dayanand Saraswati the founder of Arya Samaj writes in his book,</p>
<p>Q. ~ Well sir! Have you no faith even in what the Parashar says:<br />
A. ~ …. <strong>Among the Smrities, the Manu Smriti alone is authentic.- Satyarth Prakash</strong> pg 142, Tr. Chiranjiva Bhardwaja</p>
<p>Dayanand recommended reading Manu Smriti to understand several things, Moreover he used approximately 250 verses of Manu Smriti in his book Satyarth Prakash, If Manu Smriti is so corrupted (corrupted according to some keyboard warriors) then why did Dayanand used 250 Shlokas of Manu Smriti in his book Satyarth Prakash? This proves Manu Smriti is the most authentic Smriti of Arya Samaj no matter today if some keyboard warriors reject it. In a debate between Dayanand and an Orthodox Hindu named Tara Charan, Dayanand accepted that Manu Smriti and few other texts are authoritative and they are based on the Vedas</p>
<p>Some Hindu apologists try to show there is no violence in Yajnas therefore killing animals during Yajna is prohibited, let me give an example to refute this point. Drinking alcohol is illegal in Saudi Arabia, if you trade or drink alcohol there you will be imprisoned, but in India drinking or trade of alcohol is legal and you won&#8217;t be imprisoned for it similarly killing animals in Yajnas is permissible and is a non-violent act.</p>

<p>Vayu Purana 16.5 &#8220;During the sacrifice to Visvadevas and Saumyas, the Havis can contain plenty of meat. But one should avoid the horn of the rhinoceros to mitigate the malice (of Pitrs) (?).&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Offerings to Goddess Kali,<br />
Narada Purana III.84.27-28 &#8220;At midnight, on Bhutastami (the eighth day in the dark fortnight of Karttika month) the devotee shall offer unto the goddess the flesh of cats and rams along with bones, hairs and hide or the oblation of a camel or a buffalo.

<p>Varaha Purana 119.12-18 &#8220;[Varaha said:] All this I accept if devoutly offered; also the flesh of deer, goat and hare. All these are dear to me in the worship to attain me. When the goat is offered in sacrifice by the Vaidic Brahmin, a part of it comes to me as my share&#8230;The birds that are to be used also in my worship, I shall tell you now.

<h3><a id="post-6065-Sacrifice-Ritual"></a>Animal sacrifice for Vedic sacrifice and rituals</h3>
<p>Hinduism permits slaughtering the following animals for Vedic sacrifices and rituals,</p>
<p>Sankha Samhita 13.25 &#8220;A S&#8217;raddha ceremony performed by offering oblations of Vala Sakas, bird&#8217;s flesh, the flesh of a rhinoceros, or a large scaled fish, bears infinite fruit. This is the opinion of Yama, the law-giver.&#8221; Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana even say that meat is the best food,</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana 11.7.1.3. Now, when he performs the animal offering. He thereby redeems himself–male by male, for the victim is a male, and the Sacrificer is a male. And this, indeed, to wit, flesh, is the best kind of food: he thus becomes an eater of the best kind of food. Let not a year pass by for him without his offering; for the year means life: it is thus immortal life he thereby confers upon himself.</p>
<p>Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 6.4.18 And if a man wishes that a learned son should be born to him, famous, a public man, a popular speaker, that he should know all the Vedas, and that he should live to his full age, then, after having prepared boiled rice with meat and butter, they should both eat, being fit to have offspring. The meat should be of a young or of an old bull.</p>
<p>Maitrayana Brahmaya 6.36 … Therefore (to the former) sacrifice must be offered on the house-altar with hymns, herbs, ghee, meat, cakes, sthalipaka, and other things; to the latter, with meat and drinks (belonging to the great sacrifices) thrown into the mouth, for the<br />
mouth is the Ahavaniya-fire; and this is done to increase our bodily vigour, to gain the world of purity, and for the sake of immortality.</p>
<p>Apastamba Dharma Shastra, Prasna II, Patala 7, Khanda 16.28. By this (permission of the use of buffalo&#8217;s meat) it has been declared that the meat of (other) tame and wild animals is fit to be offered.</p>
<p>Narada Purana III.87.22-24 &#8220;&#8230;If one performs hundred homas everyday with the flesh of a goat smeared with ghee, and continues it for a month, all kings will be subservient to him&#8230;25 By performing homa with the fruits of udumbara and palasa trees he attains good fortune. With the flesh of a jackal also he attains the same&#8230;27 He can captivate people by performing homa with the menstrual flow of women; the desire is fulfilled by means of the flesh of a deer. The stunning is achieved through the flesh of a buffalo&#8230;&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 3.10.3-7 &#8220;When a son is born, let his father perform for him the ceremonies proper on the birth of a child, and all other initiatory rites, as well as a Śráddha, which is a source of prosperity. Let him feed a couple of Brahmans, seated with their faces to the east; and according to his means offer sacrifices to the gods and progenitors. Let him present to the manes balls of meat mixed with curds, barley, and jujubes, with the part of his hand sacred to the gods, or with that sacred to Prajápati. Let a Brahman perform such a Śráddha, with all its offerings and circumambulations, on every occasion of good fortune.&#8221; Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Narada Purana III.90.147 &#8220;By performing homa with the meat of ram smeared with trimadha one shall attain gold. If the meat of ram is smeared with milk and homa is performed, one shall attain a very fertile land abounding in plants within forty days.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Brahma Purana: Gautami Mahatmya 61.27-28 &#8220;In the southern bank of Ganga the cows were set apart as the sacrificial animals. These cows had fled and the Devas herded them together on Ganga.

<h3><a id="post-6065-Gods-Manes"></a>Honoring Gods and Manes is the condition to eat meat</h3>
<p>Yajnavalkya Smriti verse 179 One may eat meat without incurring any guilt when one&#8217;s life is in danger, (when engaged) in Sraddha, when it has been springkled with water while Mantras were recited, when Brahmanas desire one&#8217;s doing it, or when it has been properly offered to Gods and the pitris.</p>
<p>Yajnavalkya Smriti Chapter 1, verse 171 &#8220;[One should avoid] havi (clarified butter) made for the worship of a deity, [before the adoration is finished,] the juice of a pot-herb, that of a red-coloured tree, that of trees born of cuttings, meat of animals not offered in sacrifices&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Vijnanesvara writes on this verse,</p>
<p>&#8220;Unhallowed meat, The flesh of animals not offered at the sacrifice.&#8221; Tr. Srisa Chandra Vasu</p>
<p>Vyasa Samhita 3.558 &#8220;A twice-born one, by eating the cooked flesh of an animal wantonly slaughtered (not killed in any sacrifice), suffers the pangs of hell for eternal time, or as long as the sun and stars would shine in heaven&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Usana Samhita 9.22 &#8220;[There is] no [penance for taking] the meat [of animals] sacrificed unto a deity; [for taking any other meat, one] should perform the Chandrayana. Or, fasting for twelve days, he should offer oblations of clarified butter to the Fire with the Kushmanda [Mantram].&#8221; Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti 51.59 &#8220;Under no circumstance shall eat the flesh of an animal, not consecrated with Mantras, but he will eat, in conformity with the injunctions of the eternal scriptures, the flesh of an animal consecrated with Mantras and duly offered on the occasion of a sacrifice.&#8221; Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 5.32 He who eats meat, <strong>when he honours the gods and manes</strong>, commits no sin, whether he has bought it, or himself has killed (the animal), or has received it as a present from others.</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti 51.20-21 Or (food that is given) in a disrespectful manner, or the meat (of animals killed) for no sacred purpose. After having (unawares) eaten the flesh of any sort of fish, excepting the Pathina, Rohita, Ragiva, Simhatunda, and Sakula fishes, he must fast for three days.</p>
<p>Kurma Purana II.24.3 &#8220;A Brahmana maintaining sacred fires and desirous of living for a long time should not eat cooked food or meat without performing the Yajna of fresh harvest and the animal sacrifice.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Garuda Purana I.96.72 &#8220;By eating garlic and onion one becomes sinful and as atonement one should perform Candrayana. If one takes meat after worshipping deities and manes in Sraddha one does not acquire sin.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Garuda Purana I.96.60-64 &#8220;&#8230;Meat should not be taken without consecration&#8230;&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Mahabharata Book 3, Section 207 “…this rule has been laid down by Munis:–Whoever partakes of animal food after having first offered it duly and respectfully to the gods and the manes, is not polluted by the act. And such a man is not at all considered to have partaken of animal food…” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Mahabharata Book 12, Section 37 “…Rice boiled in sugared milk, food mixed with the tila seed, meat, and cakes, that have not been dedicated to the gods, should not be taken by Brahmanas leading a domestic mode of life, Having first gratified the gods, Rishis, guests, Pitris, and the household deities, a Brahmana leading a domestic mode of life should then take his food…” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>It is considered sinful to eat meat without honouring gods and manes,</p>
<p>Vamana Purana 12.20 &#8220;Those men who have consumed rice boiled in milk, rice cooked with sesamum, and meat, without offering them to the deity have thrust into their mouth awfully hot iron balls.&#8221; Tr. Ananda Swarup Gupta</p>
<p>Devi Bhagavagam 9.33.62-85. &#8220;If any Brâhmin villain eats, out of greed, any flesh (not sacrificed before the goddess) or anything not offered to Hari, he will have to remain in the Krimi Kunda where he eats those things for as many years as there are hairs on his body&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Gautama Samhita 17.31. Nor the flesh of animals whose milk-teeth have not fallen out, which are diseased, nor the meat of those (which have been killed) for no (sacred) purpose,</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 206.15 &#8220;Then the following formulae should be recited:_ &#8216;Whatever sins I may have committed through insinuations, backbiting, or eating flesh not offered to the gods, be destroyed by the giving away of this copper vessel.&#8217; Then the vessel is to be given over.&#8221; Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>Kurma Purana 2.17.34b-39 &#8220;Manu the Prajapati has said that these five clawed animals may be eaten viz. Godha (alligator), Kurma (tortoise), Sasa (hare), Svavit and Sallaki (the small and the big porcupione). O excellent men, one may eat those fish with thorny scales (?) and the flesh of the deer Ruru. They can be eaten after offering them to the deities and the Brahmanas and not otherwise. The Prajapati has said that the peacock, the francoline patridge, the Kapinjala (a variety of the ruddy goose), the rhenocero and the panther can be eaten. O leading sages, among fishes, these are mentioned as worthy of being eaten, viz: the Rajivas (lotus-like ones) the Simhatundas (lion-snouted), the Pathinas and the Rohitas. The flesh of these must be sprinkled with holy water and consecrated before eating if the Brahmanas so desires. One shall eat meat in accordance with the injunctions or as enjoined at a time when life is in danger. One who eats the remainder (i.e. what is left after worship) or as a medicine or when one is powerless or is deputed, he is not affected by sin.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p><strong>Division of parts of sacrificial animal</strong></p>
<p>Aitareya Brahmana Book 7, Chapter 1, Para 1 “Now follows the division of the different parts of the sacrificial animal (among the priests). We shall describe it. The two jawbones with the tongue are to be given to the Prastotar; the breast in the form of an eagle to the Udgatar; the throat with the palate to the Pratihartar; the lower part of the right loins to the Hotar; the left to the Braham; the right thigh to the Maitravaruna; the left to the Brahmanacchamsi; the right side with the shoulder to the Adhvaryu; the left side to those who accompany the chants; the left shoulder to the Pratipasthatar; the lower part of the right arm to the Neshtar; the lower part of the left arm to the Potar&#8230;the other half of the fleshy part on the neck and the left lobe (kloma) to the slaughterer&#8230;Those who divide the sacrificial animal in the way mentioned, it becomes the guide to heaven. But those who make the division otherwise are like scoundrels and miscreants who kill an animal merely (for gratifying their lust after flesh. This division of the sacrificial animal was invented by the Rishi Devabhaga, a son of Sruta. When he was departing from this life, he did not entrust (the secret to any one). But a supernatural being communicated it to Girija, the son of Babhru. Since his time men study it.&#8221; Tr. Martin Haug</p>

<h3><a id="post-6065-Shraddha-Pitrs"></a>Animal slaughter at Shraddha for Pitrs (ancestors)</h3>
<p>Mahabharata book 13 section 88 Manu has said that if a Sraddha is performed with a copious measure of sesame, such Sraddha becomes inexhaustible. Of all kinds of food, sesame seeds are regarded as the best. With fishes offered at Sraddhas, the Pitris remain gratified for a period of two months. With mutton they remain gratified for three months and with the flesh of the hare for four. With the flesh of the goat, O king, they remain gratified for five months, with bacon for six months, and with the flesh of birds for seven. With venison obtained from those deer that are called Prishata, they remain gratified for eight months, and with that obtained from the Ruru for nine months, and with the meat of the Gavaya for ten months. With the meat of the buffalo their gratification lasts for eleven months. With beef presented at the Sraddha, their gratification, it is said, lasts for a full year. Payasa mixed with ghee is as much acceptable to the Pitris as beef. With the meat of the Vadhrinasa the gratification of the Pitris lasts for twelve years. The flesh of the rhinoceros, offered to the Pitris on the anniversaries of the lunar days on which they died, becomes inexhaustible. The potherb called Kalasaka, the petals of the Kanchana flower, and meat of the goat also, thus offered, prove inexhaustible.</p>
<p>Apastamba Dharma Shastra, Prasna II, Patala 7, Khanda 16.3-4 At that (rite) the Manes (of one&#8217;s father, grandfather, and great-grand father) are the deities (to whom the sacrifice is offered). But the Brâhmanas, (who are fed,) represent the Âhavanîya-fire. That rite must be performed in each month [26] Beef satisfies (the Manes) for a year.</p>
<p>Apastamba Dharma Shastra, Prasna II, Patala 7, Khanda 17.1-3 (If) rhinoceros&#8217; meat (is given to Brahmanas seated) on (seats covered with) the skin of a rhinoceros, (the Manes are satisfied) for a very long time. (The same effect is obtained) by (offering the) flesh (of the fish called) Satabali, And by (offering the) meat of the (crane called)</p>
<p>Gautama Dharma Shastra 15.15. The Manes are satisfied for a month by gifts of sesamum, Masha-beans, rice, barley, and water, For (three) years by fish and the flesh of common deer, spotted deer, hares, turtles, <strong>boars</strong>, and sheep,For twelve years by cow&#8217;s milk and messes made of milk, For a very long time by the flesh of (the crane called) Vardhrinasa, by Ocyrnurn sanctum (sacred Basil), and by the flesh of goats, (especially) of a red (he-goat), and of a rhinoceros, (if these dishes are) mixed with honey.</p>
<p>Maharishi Manu writes,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 3.266-72 I will now fully declare what kind of sacrificial food, given to the manes according to the rule, will serve for a long time or for eternity. The ancestors of men are satisfied for one month with sesamum grains, rice, barley, masha beans, water, roots, and fruits, which have been given according to the prescribed rule, Two months with fish, three months with the meat of gazelles, four with mutton, and five indeed with the flesh of birds, Six months with the flesh of kids, seven with that of spotted deer, eight with that of the black antelope, but nine with that of the (deer called) Ruru, Ten months they are satisfied with the meat of boars and buffaloes, but eleven months indeed with that of hares and tortoises, One year with cow-milk and milk-rice; from the flesh of a long-eared white he-goat their satisfaction endures twelve years. The (vegetable called) Kalasaka, (the fish called) Mahasalka, the flesh of a rhinoceros and that of a red goat, and all kinds of food eaten by hermits in the forest serve for an endless time.</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 2.16.1-3 “AURVA continued.–&#8221;Ancestors are satisfied for a month with offerings of rice or other grain, with clarified butter, with fish, or the flesh of the hare, of birds, of the hog, the goat, the antelope, the deer, the gayal, or the sheep, or with the milk of the cow, and its products. They are for ever satisfied with flesh (in general), and with that of the long-eared white goat in particular. The flesh of the rhinoceros, the Kálaśáka potherb, and honey, are also especial sources of satisfaction to those worshipped at ancestral ceremonies.” Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Yajnavalkya Smriti verse 258-59 (The Pitris are satisfied) verily for a moth with the havisya (sacrificial food), but for a year with the milk rice, with the fish, with the meat of gazelles, with mutton, with the flesh of birds, with the flesh of kids, with flesh of spotted deer. With the flesh of black antelope, with that of Ruru deer, with the meat of boars, and with the meat of hares respectively for a period progessively increasing by a month are satisfied when offered to the Grandfathers here.</p>
<p>Markandeya Purana 32.2-5; Matsya Purana 17-31-36 The Pitris are satisfied with clarified butter and rice for a month. The paternal grandfathers receive satisfaction with fish meat for two months. Venison should be known to satisfy the pitris for three months; and the flesh of hares nourishes the pitris for four months; bird&#8217;s flesh satisfies them for five months; hog&#8217;s flesh for six months; goat&#8217;s flesh for seven months; and flesh of the black antelope for eight months; flesh of the ruru deer gives them satisfication for nine months, without doubt; flesh of gayal gives satisfaction for ten months.</p>
<p>Same is repeated in in Kurma Purana II.20.37-54 which also talks about giving meat to Brahmins as food. Narada Purana Uttarabhaga 44.51; Vayu Purana 21-2-9; Agni Purana 117.44-48; Padma Purana 1.9.153-157; Agni Purana 163.28-39; Brahma Purana 111.15-33; Brahmanda Purana 2.3.19.2-10 similar thing is also said in Garuda Purana I.99.37- 38; Matsya Purana 15.34-35; Matsya Purana 204.6-9; Narada Purana II.51.142b-145a; Padma Purana 1.9.62-63 including the following verses,</p>
<p>Markandeya Purana 35.2-4 &#8220;&#8230;The hare, the tortoise, the gosamp, the porcupine, and the rhinoceros, my son, these indeed may be eaten; and domestic pig and fowl should be eschewed. The remains of food at a sraddha after the pitris and gods and other recipients have been satisfied may be eaten at the desire of the brahmanas. A man who eats flesh that has been killed for the purpose of medicine is not defiled.&#8221;</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti 30.34 Now he who studies the hymns of the Rig-veda (regularly), feeds the manes with clarified butter. 37 He who studies the Atharva-veda, (feeds them) with meat.</p>
<p>Markandeya Purana 32.31-34 &#8220;At this ceremony also songs in honour of the pitris are sung by those who recite the Veda, songs which were formerly sung by the pitris to king Puruavas. &#8220;When will any one of use have a son, the chief among his race, who, eating the remains food left by yogis, will offer the pinda on earth? Or will offer pinda, buffalo-beef, the clarified butter, or the vegetable kala mixed with sesamum-seed, or khichree at Gaya for our monthly satisfaction? May we obtain the offering to the Visvadevas and the soma juice, buffalo-beef, and the finest clarified butter, and the divine food by getting a young rhinoceros!&#8221;</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti 80.1-14 Sesamum, rice, barley, beans, water, roots, fruits, vegetables, Syâmâka grain, millet, wild rice, kidney-beans, and wheat satisfy (the manes) for a month; The flesh of fishes (excepting those species that are forbidden), for two months; The flesh of the common deer, for three months; The flesh of sheep, for four months; The flesh of birds (of those kinds that may be eaten), for five months; The flesh of goats, for six months; The flesh of the spotted deer, for seven months; The flesh of the spotted antelope, for eight months; Beef, for nine months; Buffalo&#8217;s meat, for ten months; The meat of a hornless goat, for eleven months; The milk of a cow, or preparations from it, for a year. On this subject there exists a stanza, which the manes utter: &#8216;(The pot-herb) Kâlasâka (sacred basil), (the prawn) Mahâsalka, and the flesh of the (crane called) Vârdhrînasa[1], (and of) a rhinoceros having no horn, is food which we always accept.&#8217;</p>
<p>Agni Purana 117.44-48 &#8220;Now I shall discuss the nature of satisfaction which the different sorts of cakes or oblations respectively impart to the souls of one&#8217;s ancestors. Oblations composed of cereals grown in villages as well as forest fruits, bulbs and roots last one&#8217;s forefathers for a month, while those consisting of fishes and venison would serve them well for double or triple that division of time. The peculiar kind of venison known as the Rouravas would gratify them for five months, whereas games and wild fowls would last them for four months. The departed soul are supposed to live satisfactorily upon goat&#8217;s meat for six months, meat of tortoise, pork, mutton, and buffalo flesh lasting them for seven, eight, nine and ten months respectively. Sweetened porridge and butter of cow milk offered in a clarified state would gratify them for a whole year, while the meat of a full grown sacrificial goat (Vardrinasa) as well as the sword of a rhinoceros, flesh of an antelope or that of a red goat and honey should be considered as their full and proper ration for a period of three consecutive&#8217; months. Offerings made during the rainy season consist of fishes having large scales, while a Shraddha ceremony performed on the day on which the moon enters the asterisk Magha should be supposed as hearing immortal fruits.&#8221; Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Usana Samhita 3.137-141 &#8220;one should, with care, give at a Sraddha, deer, lamb and tortoise. With fish and meat, [the Manes attain to gratification for] two months; and [for] three months, with the meat of deer. With mutton, [they are gratified for] four months; with the meat of birds, [for] five months; with the meat of goat, [for] six months; and with the meat of Ruru deer, [for] nine months. With the meat of buffalo and pork, [they] are gratified for ten months; and with the meat of hare and tortoise, for eleven months. With cow&#8217;s milk and Payasa (milk and boiled-rice), [they attain to gratification for] one year. With the meat of rhinoceros, [they attain to] gratification for twelve years. Black pot herbs, sea-scrabs, meat of rhinoceros and black goat, honey and all other roots leads to their everlasting gratification.&#8221; Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Grihya Sutra of Hiranyakesin II Prasna, 5 Patala, 15 section, 1-9 On the following day he sacrifices a cow to the Fathers&#8230;When it has been sprinkled and fire has been carried round it, they kill it to the west of the fire, its head being turned to the west, its feet to the south. After it has been killed, he silently &#8216;strengthens&#8217; its sense-organs (by touching them) with water, and silently takes out the omentum, the heart, and the kidneys.…He sacrifices the omentum entirely. The other parts (Sutra 5) he should offer to the Brahmanas and should feed them (with those parts of the cow). When the food (for the Brahmanas) is ready, he cuts off (the Avadanas) together from the mess of boiled rice, and form the pieces of meat, and mixing them with clarified butter he makes oblations thereof with the verses, &#8216;Behold the Ekashtaka, the giver of food with meat and ghee, (which is offered) with (the word) svadha. By the Brahmanas that food is purified. May it be an imperishable (blessings to me! Svadha! Adoration!&#8217;</p>

I.e animals offered at Sraddhas and Srauta-sacrifices, though under other circumstances forbidden, may be eaten both by the priests and other Brahmanas.</p>
<p>Padma Purana 1.33.80 &#8220;O you of a good vow, satisfy the brahmanas with musk, and flesh and various kinds of grains, and by offering a Sraddha.&#8221; Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p>All these animals sacrificed to gods and manes is supposed to be eaten by the Brahmin priest. Some Aryas may cry that this has nothing to do with Hinduism, these are interpolated texts. But for their kind information, interpolation can occur only in one text, the same interpolation cannot happen in several texts like Manu Smriti, Yajnvalkya Smriti, Mahabharata, Vishnu, Markandeya, Matsya Puranas, Dharma Shastras and so on. The fact that this Shraddha for Pitrs occurs in so many Smritis and Puranas proves that Sages who wrote these books agreed with it, so do Hindus mean to say they know more about Hinduism than their sages?</p>

<h3><a id="post-6065-Rejecting-Meat"></a>Rejecting meat offered at Vedic sacrifice and ritual is sinful</h3>
<p>Hindu texts even say that one who refuses to eat meat offered to gods and manes at Shraddha is punished after death,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 5.35 But a man who, being duly engaged (to officiate or to dine at a sacred rite), refuses to eat meat, becomes after death an animal during twenty-one existences.</p>
<p>Vasistha Dharma Shastra 11.34 &#8216;But an ascetic who, invited to dine at a sacrifice of the manes or of the gods, rejects meat, shall go to hell for as many years as the slaughtered beast has hairs.&#8217;</p>
<p>Kurma Purana 2.17.40 &#8220;If a person invited for the Sraddha or the worship of a deity eschews meat he may have to be in the hell as many years as there are hairs on the body of the animal.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Kurma Purana II.22.74-75 &#8220;An excellent Brahmana engaged in the Sraddha should not avoid anything served. He should not refuse even the meat offered. One should not look at the food served to another person. If the Brahmanas who engaged in the Pitr rite, does not partake of the meat served, he is reborn as an animal for twenty-one births.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Vyasa Samhita 3.56-57 &#8220;A Brahmana, engaged in the celebration of a religious sacrifice, becomes degraded by not taking meat. A Kshatriya should eat the cooked flesh of a quarry after having propitiated therewith the gods and his departed manes. A Vaishya can take meat, lawfully obtained for money, after having worshipped therewith his departed manes.&#8221; Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>

<h3><a id="post-6065-Animals-Sacrifice"></a>Animals are created for sacrifice</h3>
<p>Manu Smriti 5.31-42 The consumption of meat (is befitting) for  sacrifices,&#8217; that is declared to be a rule made by the gods; but to persist (in using it) on other (occasions) is said to be a proceeding worthy of Rakshasas. He who eats meat, when he honours the gods and manes, commits no sin, whether he has bought it, or himself has killed (the animal), or has received it as a present from others…After death the guilt of one who slays deer for gain is not as (great) as that of him who eats meat for no (sacred) purpose. But a man who, being duly engaged (to officiate or to dine at a sacred rite), refuses to eat meat, becomes after death an animal during twenty-one existences…If he has a strong desire (for meat) he may make an animal of clarified butter or one of flour, (and eat that); but let him never seek to destroy an animal without a (lawful) reason. As many hairs as the slain beast has, so often indeed will he who killed it without a (lawful) reason suffer a violent death in future births. Svayambhu (the Self-existent) himself created animals for the sake of sacrifices; sacrifices (have been instituted) for the good of this whole (world); hence the slaughtering (of beasts) for sacrifices is not slaughtering (in the ordinary sense of the word)&#8230;On offering the honey-mixture (to a guest), at a sacrifice and at the rites in honour of the manes, but on these occasions only, may an animal be slain; that (rule) Manu proclaimed. A twice-born man who, knowing the true meaning of the Veda, slays an animal for these purposes, causes both himself and the animal to enter a most blessed state.</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti 51.61 It is for sacrifices that beasts have been created by the self-existent (Brahman) himself. Sacrificing causes the whole universe to prosper; therefore is the slaughter (of beasts) for a sacrifice no slaughter.</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti 51.65 That twice-born man who, knowing the exact truth (promulgated) in the Veda, slays cattle for the sacrifices (ordained in the Veda) will convey himself and the cattle (slain by him) to a blissful abode.</p>
<p>Chandogya Upanishad 8.15.1  …never giving pain to any creature, except at the tirthas  (sacrifices, &amp;c.), he who behaves thus all his life, reaches the world of Brahman, and does not return, yea, he does not return..</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam (Bhagvad Purana) 11.5.11 “In this material world the conditioned soul is always inclined to sex, meat-eating and intoxication. Therefore religious scriptures never actually encourage such activities. Although the scriptural injunctions provide for sex through sacred marriage, for meat-eating through sacrificial offerings and for intoxication through the acceptance of ritual cups of wine, such ceremonies are meant for the ultimate purpose of renunciation.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Mahabharata Book 3, Section 207 “And in days of yore, O Brahmana, two thousand animals used to be killed every day in the kitchen of king Rantideva…&#8217;The sacred fire is fond of animal food,&#8217; this saying has come down to us. And at sacrifices animals are invariably killed by regenerate Brahmanas, and these animals being purged of sin, by incantation of hymns, go to heaven. If, O Brahmana, the sacred fire had not been so fond of animal food in ancient times, it could never have become the food of any one. And in this matter of animal food, this rule has been laid down by Munis:–Whoever partakes of animal food after having first offered it duly and respectfully to the gods and the manes, is not polluted by the act. And such a man is not at all considered to have partaken of animal food…” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.163.12-13 “The strong Steed hath come forward to the slaughter, pondering with a mind directed God-ward. The goat who is his kin is led before him the sages and the singers follow after. The Steed is come unto the noblest mansion, is come unto his Father and his Mother. This day shall he approach the Gods, most welcome: then he declares good gifts to him who offers.” Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>Above verses from Mahabharata and Veda says that animals killed in Vedic sacrifice goes to heaven, on this statement I would like to mention the argument of Jains and Buddhists against this,</p>
<p>&#8220;If an animal slaughtered in religious worship is thereby raised to heaven, would it not be expedient for a man who institutes a sacrifice to kill his own father for a victim?&#8221;</p>

<h3><a id="post-6065-Killing-nonviolent"></a>Killing animal is non-violent</h3>
<p>Vedic verses clearly tells us that killing animal is part of Yajna (sacrifice). Maharshi Manu also writes that slaughtering animals for sacrifices is non-violent,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 5.44 Know that the injury to moving creatures and to those destitute of motion, which the Veda has prescribed for certain occasions, is no injury at all; for the sacred law shone forth from the Veda.</p>
<p>Whether animals should be killed in Yajna (Sacrifices) or not is explained in detail in the Devi Bhagawatam,</p>
<p>Devi Bhagwatam 1.18.48-61 &#8220;…O King! One can see before one&#8217;s eyes that the drinking of Soma rasa, the killing of animals, the eating of fish and flesh and so are advised in the Vedas; so much so that in the sacrificial ceremony named Sautrâmana the rule of drinking wine and many other vratas are clearly mentioned; even gambling is advised in the Vedas. So how can Mukti be obtained by following the Veda Dharma? It is heard that, in ancient times, there was a great king, named S&#8217;as&#8217;avindu, very religious, truthful, and performing sacrifices, very liberal; he protected the virtuous, and chastised those that were wicked and going astray. He performed many Yajñas, where many cows and sheep were sacrificed according to the rules of the Vedas and abundant Dakshinâs (sacrificial fees) were presented to every one that performed their parts in the sacrifices. In these sacrifices, the hides of the cows that were sacrificed as victims, were heaped to such an enormous extent that they looked liked a second Bindhyâchal mountain. Then the rains fell and the dirty water coming out of that enormous heap of skins flowed down and gave rise to a river which was thence called the Charmanvatî river… Janaka said :– &#8220;The killing of animals in a sacrificial ceremony is not killing; it is known as Ahimsa [Non Violence]; for that himsa [Violence] is not from any selfish attachment; therefore when there is no such sacrifice and the animals are killed out of selfish attachment, then that is real himsâ; … O Dvija! Really speaking, the killing of animals done by the house-holder attached to senses and their objects, and done under their impulses can be taken into account as a real act of killing; but, O Mahâbhâga of those whose hearts are not attached to anything of those self controlled persons, desirous of moksa, if they do an act of Himsa out of a sense of duty, with no desires of fruits and with their hearts free from egoism that can never be reckoned as a real act of killing.&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 3.26.32-34 &#8220;Those who eat meat, they can sacrifice animals in this worship of the Devî; and, for this purpose, goat and wild boars are the best. O sinless one! The goats, etc., offered as a sacrifice before the Devî attain to unending heavens. Therefore persons offering the sacrifices of goats do not incur any sin. O king! The goats, etc., and other beast offered as a sacrifice before the Devas undoubtedly go to the heavenly regions; therefore, in all the S&#8217;âstras, it has been decided that this killing of animals in a sacrifice is considered as non-killing.&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti 51.67 That slaughter which is in accordance with the precepts of the Veda, and has been fixed for this world of movable and immovable creatures, should be considered as no slaughter at all; because it is from the Veda that law shines forth.</p>
<p>Kalki Purana 26.12 &#8220;&#8230;The Vedas therefore say that killing in a righteous battle or in a sacrificial performace does not constitute killing.&#8221; Tr. Bhumipati Das, edited by Purnaprajna Das</p>
<p>Following verse from Vasistha explains Manu Smriti 5.48 which is used by Hindu apologists to prohibit meat consumption in Manu,</p>
<p>Vasistha Dharma Shastra 4.5-8 The Manava (Sutra states), &#8216;Only when he worships the manes and the gods, or honours guests, he may certainly do injury to animals.&#8217; On offering a Madhuparka (to a guest), at a sacrifice, and at the rites in honour of the manes, but on these occasions only may an animal be slain; that (rule) Manu proclaimed.&#8221;Meat can never be obtained without injuring living beings, and to injure living beings does not procure heavenly bliss; therefore the (sages declare) the slaughter (of beasts) at a sacrifice not to be slaughter (in the ordinary sense of the word).&#8217; &#8216;Now he may also cook a full-grown ox or a full-grown he-goat for a Brâhmana or Kshatriya guest; in this manner they offer hospitality to such (a man).</p>

<h3><a id="post-6065-Examples"></a>Examples of meat consumption</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Krishna</strong></p>
<p>Krishna recommended slaughtering animals for worshipping Govardhan Mountain and also ate the flesh of animals that was offered by the people,</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 5.10.36-49 “Let prayer and offerings then be addressed to the mountain Govarddhana, and kill a victim in due form. Let the whole station collect their milk without delay, and feed with it the Brahmans and all who may desire to partake of it. When the oblations have been presented, and the Brahmans have been fed, let the Gopas circumambulate the cows, decorated with garlands of autumnal flowers. If the cowherds will attend to these suggestions, they will secure the favour of the mountain, of the cattle, and also mine.&#8221; When Nanda and the other Gopas heard these words of Krishńa, their faces expanded with delight, and they said that he had spoken well. &#8220;You have judged rightly, child,&#8221; exclaimed they; &#8220;we will do exactly as you have proposed, and offer adoration to the mountain.&#8221; Accordingly the inhabitants of Vraja worshipped the mountain, presenting to it curds and milk and flesh; and they fed hundreds and thousands of Brahmans, and many other guests, who came to the ceremony, even as Krishńa had enjoined: and when they had made their offerings, they circumambulated the cows and the bulls, that bellowed as loud as roaring clouds. Upon the summit of Govarddhana, Krishńa presented himself, saying, &#8220;I am the mountain,&#8221; and partook of much food presented by the Gopas; whilst in his own form as Krishńa he ascended the hill along with the cowherds, and worshipped his other self. Having promised them many blessings, the mountain-person of Krishńa vanished; and the ceremony being completed, the cowherds returned to their station.” Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>H.H. Wilson also writes about it in his introduction of translation of Vishnu Purana,</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;and says that at Krsna&#8217;s advice Nanda and the other cowherds worshipped the mount Govardhana with the offer of various kinds of foods including meat of a sacrificial animal killed on that occasion and that Krsna took his seat on the mount, identifying himself with it, and ate up much of the food thus offered by the cowherds&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>It is also mentioned in Harivamsha Purana,</p>
<p>Harimvsha Purana 2.17.15-21 &#8220;Let us kill the animals such as buffalos to be eaten. Let this sacrifice be conducted with all gopas…Along with a pond of curd, a vortex of ghee, a river of milk, a variety of meat and a mountain of cooked rice, the entire complex of vraja including the happy gopa-s and beautiful gopi-s proceeded for the hill sacrifice…At the start of the sacrifice, the items were offered to the fire as ordained. The gopa-s performed the sacrifice along with brahmins on an auspicious day. At the end of the sacrifice, by illusion, Krishna became the hill and consumed the best rice, milk, curd and meat which were offered.&#8221; Tr. A. Purushothaman and A. Harindranath</p>
<p>This is also mentioned in Brahma Purana,</p>
<p>Brahma Purana 79.21 &#8220;[Krishna said] Hence, let the mountain Govardhana be honoured and worshipped with all due offerings after killing the sacrificial animal in accordance with injunctions. [25] Vyasa said: O brahmins, on hearing these words of his, Nanda and other residents of the colony became delighted with their faces beaming with pleasure. They said &#8216;Well said, well said, my boy&#8230;Accordingly the residents of colony performed Yajna unto the mountain. They offered oblations unto the mountain by curds, milk puddings, meat etc.&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Hundreds of animals were slaughtered and wine was drunk by Krishna&#8217;s family and Pandavas,</p>
<p>Mahabharata Virata Parva 4, Section 72, Verses 19-28 &#8220;And Krishna gave unto each of the illustrious sons of Pandu numerous female slaves, and gems and robes. And then the nuptial festival set in between the families of the Matsya king and the Pandavas. And then conchs and cymbals and horns and drums and other musical instruments appointed by the Pandavas, began to play in the palace of Virata. And deer of various kinds and clean animals by hundreds were slain. And wines of various kinds and intoxicating juices of trees were profusely collected.&#8221; Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Rama</strong></p>
<p>These are the words of Hindu god Ram before his exile,</p>
<p>Valmiki Ramayana, Ayodhya Kanda 2.20.29 &#8220;I shall live in a solitary forest like a sage for fourteen years, <strong>leaving off meat</strong> and living with roots, fruits and honey.&#8221; Tr. K.M.K. Murthy</p>
<p>This proves that meat was part of his lavish lifestyle in the palace. Rama also used to relish pork, meat of deer and other animals in the forest after the exile,</p>
<p>Valmiki Ramayana, Ayodhya Kanda 2.52.102 &#8220;Famished, they (Rama and Lakshmana) killed a boar, a rishya (whitefooted male antelope), a spotted deer and a great deer with black stripes. They partook the meat and reached a tree by evening where they rested for the night.&#8221; Tr. <a href="https://www.valmiki.iitk.ac.in/sloka?field_kanda_tid=2&amp;language=dv&amp;field_sarga_value=52" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">IIT Kanpur<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>Valmiki Ramayana Ayodhya Kanda 2.96.1-2 &#8220;Having shown Mandakini River in that manner to Seetha, the daughter of Mithila, Rama set on the hill-side in order to gratify her appetite with a piece of flesh. Rama, whose mind was devoted to righteousness stayed there with Seetha, saying; &#8220;This meat is fresh, this is savoury and roasted in the fire.&#8221; Tr. Shri K.M.K. Murthy</p>
<p>Sita addressed Ravana (who was in the guise of an ascetic) in the following way,</p>
<p>Valmiki Ramayana 3.47.22b-23 &#8220;Be comfortable for a moment, here it is possible for you to make a sojourn, and soon my husband will be coming on taking plentiful forest produce, and on killing stags, mongooses, wild boars he fetches meat, aplenty.&#8221; Tr. Desiraju Hanumanth Rao</p>
<p>This is what Rama said to Lakshamana on hunting a golden deer,</p>
<p>Valmiki Ramayana, Aranya Kanda 3.43.31 &#8220;Kings pursuing games of hunting in great forests, oh, Lakshmana, will be felling deer either for the sake of flesh, or just for the purpose of sporting archery.&#8221; Tr. Desiraju Hanumant Rao</p>
<p>Ramayana of Valmiki, Ayodhya Kanda 2, Sarga 55, verse 33 “Thereafter having travelled only a couple of miles the two brothers Rama and Lakshmana killed many consecrated deer and ate in the river-forest of Yamuna.” Tr. K.M.K. Murthy</p>
<p>Bali addresses Rama,</p>
<p>Ramayana of Valmiki, Kishikindha Kanda 4, Sarga 17, Verse 39 &#8220;Raghava, five kinds of five-nailed animals, viz., a kind of wild rodent, a kind of wild-boar, a kind of lizard, a hare and fifthly the turtle are edible for Brahmans and Kshatriya-s.&#8221; Tr. Desiraju Hanumanta Rao</p>
<p>Rama&#8217;s father Dashratha was an avid hunter,</p>
<p>Valmiki Ramayana, Ayodhya Kanda 2.63.21-25 &#8220;With a wish to do hunting as an exercise in that most comfortable season, I went along Sarayu River, in a chariot, wearing bow and arrows. Without my senses under control and with an intent to kill there a (wild) buffalo or an elephant or any other wild animal coming in the night at that place for the purpose of drinking water, I was ready with my bow at a solitary place. Hearing the sound, I killed turning towards it, a wild animal, which came to the bank of Sarayu River and another violent beast too which came there. Meanwhile, in that darkness and not within the react of the eye, I heard the sound of a pitcher being filled up, the sound of which appeared like that of an elephant. With an intent to hit that elephant, I drew out a shining arrow resembling a serpent, targeted towards the direction sound and discharged it.&#8221; Tr. Shri K.M.K Murthy</p>
<p>Some Hindus says that meat shouldn&#8217;t be consumed in Kali Yuga. But they are unaware of the fact that Kalki avatar who will be born in Kali Yuga will offer meat to Brahmins as per Kalki Purana,</p>
<p>Kalki Purana 30.10-13 &#8220;Lord Kalki sumptuously fed all the brahmanas the four kinds of food that are chewed, licked, sucked, and rank, and this included vegetable preparations, soup, cakes, meat, fruit, roots, and many other items&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Bhumipati Das, edited by Purnaprajna Das</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Shiva</strong></p>
<p>Mahabharata Book 13, Section 161, Verse 7 &#8220;And since he burns and oppresses, is keen and fierce, and endued with great energy, and is engaged in eating flesh and blood and marrow, he is said to be Rudra.&#8221; Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.30.202 &#8220;Hail to the one greedy of raw and cooked meat&#8230;[211] Obeisance to the jackal (fond of) embryo meal&#8230;&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Kalki</strong></p>
<p>Kalki avatar tells to perform horse sacrifice,</p>
<p>Kalki Purana 3.42 &#8220;(Lord Kalki said:) Many pious human beings become degraded in this age of Kali. But because of My presence, they will all become pious once again. Now I would like that all of you worship Me by the performance of a Rajasuya sacrifice and a horse sacrifice.&#8221; Tr. Bhumipati Das, edited by Purnaprajna Das</p>
<p>Kalki Purana also says that Vishnuyasa father of Kalki avatar will perform horse sacrifice. This proves that Ashvamedha Yajna (horse sacrifice) is permissible in Kali Yuga also. Secondly, Vedas are said to be eternal which permits animal slaughter so there is no prohibition to consume meat in Kali Yuga. Mahabharata also shows that Brahmins used to relish meat,</p>
<p>Mahabharata Book 3, Section 96 &#8220;…The Brahmana, however, did not grant the Asura a son like Indra. And at this, the Asura was inflamed with wrath against the Brahmana. And from that day, O king, the Asura Ilwala became a destroyer of Brahmanas. And endued with power of illusion the angry Asura transformed his brother into a ram. And Vatapi also capable of assuming any form at will, would immediately assume the shape of a ram. And the flesh of that ram, after being properly dressed, was offered to Brahmanas as food. And after they had eaten of it, they were slain. For whomsoever Ilwala summoned with his voice, he would come back to Ilwala even if he had gone to the abode of Yama, in re-embodied form endued with life, and show himself to Ilwala. And so having transformed the Asura Vatapi into a ram and properly cooked his flesh and feeding Brahmanas therewith, he would summon Vatapi…&#8221; Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Ashwamedha Yajna mentioned in Mahabharata,</p>
<p>Mahabharata Book 14, Section 89 “Vaisampayana said, &#8216;Having cooked, according to due rites, the other excellent animals that were sacrificed, the priests then sacrificed, agreeably to the injunctions of the scriptures, that steed (which had wandered over the whole world). After cutting that horse into pieces, conformably to scriptural directions, they caused Draupadi of great intelligence, who was possessed of the three requisites of mantras, things, and devotion, to sit near the divided animal. The Brahmanas then with cool minds, taking up the marrow of that steed, cooked it duly, O chief of Bharata&#8217;s race. King Yudhishthira the just, with all his younger brothers, then smelled, agreeably to the scriptures, the smoke, capable of cleansing one from every sin, of the marrow that was thus cooked. The remaining limbs, O king, of that horse, were poured into the fire by the sixteen sacrificial priests possessed of great wisdom.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p><strong>OTHERS</strong></p>
<p>Rishi Agastya is said to have eaten beasts and birds and even a Asura who was in the form of a ram,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 5.22-23 Beasts and birds recommended (for consumption) may be slain by Brahmanas for sacrifices, and in order to feed those whom they are bound to maintain; for Agastya did this of old. For in ancient (times) the sacrificial cakes were (made of the flesh) of eatable beasts and birds at the sacrifices offered by Brahmanas and Kshatriyas.</p>
<p>Vasistha Dharma Shastra 14.15. For it is declared in the Veda, &#8216;At a sacrificial session (sattra), which lasted one thousand years, Agastya went out to hunt. He had sacrificial cakes prepared with the meat of beasts and fowls good (to eat).&#8217;</p>
<p>Mahabharata Book 3, Section 199 &#8220;Lomasa said, &#8216;When Ilwala learnt that those kings along with the great Rishi had arrived on the confines of his domain, he went out with his ministers and worshipped them duly. And that prince of Asuras received them hospitably, entertaining them, O son of the Kuru race, with well dressed meat supplied by his brother Vatapi (transformed into a ram). Then all those royal sages, beholding the mighty Asura Vatapi, who had been transformed into a ram thus cooked for them, became sad and cheerless and were nearly deprived of themselves. But that best of Rishis&#8211;Agastya&#8211;addressing those royal sages, said, &#8216;Yield ye not to grief, I will eat up the great Asura.&#8217; And the mighty Rishi then sat himself down on an excellent seat, and the prince of Asuras, Ilwala, began to distribute the food smilingly. And Agastya ate up the whole of the meat supplied by Vatapi (transformed into a ram).” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Following verse shows that animal sacrifice was performed to please departed manes,</p>
<p>Brahma Purana 5.47-50 &#8220;&#8230;On the Astaka day Iksvaku commanded Vikuksi &#8216;O powerful one, kill some rabbits and bring their flesh for performing Sraddha.&#8217;O Brahmins, after planning to perform the Sraddha rite before executing it he ate part of the meat of the rabbit which was meant for the Sraddha&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>This is also mentioned in Devi Bhagavatam and Srimad Bhagavatam 9.6.6-8 and Devi Bhagavatam,</p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 7.59.1-11. Vyâsa said :&#8211; O King! Once on a time, the time for Astaka S&#8217;râddha (the funeral ceremony in honour of the departed) arrived. Seeing this, the King Iksâku ordered his son Vikuksi:&#8211; &#8220;O Child! Go immediately to the forest and bring carefully pure sanctified meat for the S&#8217;râddha purposes; see, that there be no neglect of duty.&#8221; Thus ordered, Vikuksi instantly went to the forest equipped with arms. He hunted in the forest lots of boars, pigs, deer, and hare. But he was so very tired with his journey in the forest and got so hungry that he forgot everything about the Astaka S&#8217;râddha and ate one hare there in the forest. The remaining excellent meat he brought and handed over to his father. When that meat was brought to be sprinkled for purification, the family priest Vas&#8217;istha, on seeing it, at once came to know that some portion had already been eaten and it was the remaining part. The leavings of food are not fit for the sprinkling purposes; this is the S&#8217;âstric rule…&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 5.20.16-50 &#8220;&#8230;The Râjasik Brâhmanas were versed in the Vedas and acted as priests to the Ksattriyas and ate flesh as sanctioned by recognised rules. They were busy with their six duties&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Sons of Pandu killed many animals and offered them to Brahmins,</p>
<p>Mahabharata Book 3, Section 80 &#8220;And, O chief of the Bharata race, those mighty warriors endowed with great prowess slew with pure arrows various kinds of sacrificial animals for the Brahmanas. And those tigers among men and repressors of foes, daily slaying those wild animals and sanctifying them properly, offered them unto the Brahmanas.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Mahabharata Book 1, Section 116 says that Rishi Vyasa divided meat ball into 100 pieces and gave it to Gandhari so she can conceive 100 sons.</p>
<p>Munis also used to partake meat,</p>
<p>Mahabharata Book 3, Section 159 &#8220;Having heard from that one of incomparable energy, (Arshtishena), that advice conducive to their welfare, those foremost of the Bharatas, began to behave always accordingly. Those best of men, the Pandavas, dwelt upon the Himavan, partaking of the food eaten by the Munis, and luscious fruit, and the flesh of deer killed with unpoisoned shafts and various kinds of pure honey.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Mahabharata Book 2, Section 4 &#8220;Vaisampayana said,&#8211;&#8220;Then that chief of men, king Yudhishthira, entered that palatial sabha having first fed ten thousand Brahmanas with preparations of milk and rice mixed with clarified butter and honey with fruits and roots, and with pork and venison. The king gratified those superior Brahmanas, who had come from various countries with food seasoned with seasamum and prepared with vegetables called jibanti, with rice mixed with clarified butter, with different preparations of meat&#8211;with indeed various kinds of other food, as also numberless viands that are fit to be sucked and innumerable kinds of drinks, with new and unused robes and clothes, and with excellent floral wreaths.&#8221; Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Some Hindus might try to twist the Vedic verses by saying they does not mean what they say, they are allegorical. You cannot say verses from Manu Smriti, Upanishad, Brahmanas etc., are allegorical, all those verses including the Vedic verses on meat consumption are literal. There is no prohibition of meat consumption in Hindu scriptures, so Hindus should not just enjoy eating meat secretly at night but they should start eating openly during day also.</p>

<p><strong>A. Introduction</strong></p>
<p><em>Valmiki Ramayan</em> happens to be the &#8220;Original Ramayan&#8221; in Indian tradition. This is the book that introduced people to the story of Shri Ram chandr ji. This great epic was written by Shri Valmiki ji. Owing to the popularity of this book; several versions of <em>Ramayana</em> were written afterwards. Several centuries later <em>Ramcharitmanas</em> written by Tulsidas came into existence. Now days it is <em>Ramcharitmanas</em> that is read widely. Valmiki Ramayan is not read as much, but thankfully it is accessible and available to people.</p>
<p>To know about some differences between Original Ramayana and the Ramayana that you know &#8211; click here.<br />

<p><a href="http://khurshidimam.blogspot.in/2011/08/difference-between-original-ramayan-and.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">http://khurshidimam.blogspot.in/2011/08/difference-between-original-ramayan-and.html<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>Our Hindu brethren accuse muslims of meat eating and declare this act as inhumane and barbaric. This issue of &#8220;meat eating&#8221; has even become a political tool for some mischievous elements of society. However when we go through Sacred Books of <em>Sanatan dharma</em> or Hinduism then we find several references that not only permit or justify meat eating but also encourage in some case. When killing of animal for sacrifice or eating is done by revered personality or those who are worshipped then it poses a very big question mark over the issue of meat eating. In this article we will look at very few such references (7-8) wherein sacred personalities of Hinduism kill animal for sacrifice and for eating purpose.</p>
<p>Kindly note: I am not presenting research work on all references related to meat eating in Hindu Scriptures but only showing very few references from one book only!!</p>
<p>Another important point is that I would like to draw attention of dear readers of gross mistranslation done by some publishers. It is not difficult to understand that there are deliberate mistranslations done for some verses which speak about meat eating or animal killing. Why this literal fraud? Of course; to conceal truth from the common mass and let them not understand the reality of the issue.</p>

<p>For the ease of user we are presenting at least 2-3 different translations for each <em>shlok</em> (Verse).</p>
<p><strong>B. Glorification of roasted meat for eating by Shri Ram chandr ji and others</strong></p>
<p>1. <em>Sanskrit text</em></p>
<p>तां तदा दर्शयित्वा तु मैथिली गिरिनिम्नगाम् ।निषसाद गिरिप्रस्थे सीतां <strong>मांसेन</strong> छन्दयन् ।।</p>
<p>इदं मध्यमिदं स्वादु निष्टप्तमिद मग्निना ।एवमास्ते स धर्मात्मा सीतया सह राघवः ।।</p>
<p>(वाल्मीकि रामायण, अयोध्या काण्ड, 96, 1 व 2)</p>
<p><em>Hindi Translation</em></p>
<p>अर्थात इस प्रकार सीता जी को (नदी के) दर्शन कराकर उस समय श्री रामचन्द्र जी उनके पास बैठ गए और तपस्वी जनों के <strong>उपभोग में आने योग्यमांस</strong> से उनका इस प्रकार लालन करने लगे, ‘‘इधर देखो प्रिये, यह कितना मुलायम है, स्वादिष्ट है और इसको आग पर अच्छी तरह सेका गयाहै।‘‘</p>
<p>===============================================================================</p>
<p><em>Word by word Sanskrit to english translation:</em></p>
<p>मैथिलीम् princess of Mithila, तां सीताम् that Sita, तथा in that way, गिरिनिम्नगाम् mountain-river, दर्शयित्वा having shown,<strong> मांसेन</strong> with <strong>meat</strong>,छन्दयन् gratifying, गिरिप्रस्थे on the mountain-slope, निषसाद sat.</p>
<p>धर्मात्मा righteous, स राघवः that Rama, इदम् this, <strong>मेध्यम् sacred meat</strong>, इदम् this, स्वादु is savoury, इदम् this one, अग्निना with fire,<strong>निष्टप्तम् roasted</strong>, एवम् uttering this way, सीतया सह in the company of Sita, आस्ते was seated.</p>
<p>Having shown to Sita the mountain-river Mandakini and <strong>gratifying her with meat</strong>, Rama sat on the mountain slope. Righteous Rama was seated in Sita&#8217;s company and remarked saying &#8220;<strong>This meat is sacred. This is savoury roasted in fire</strong>&#8220;. (Valmiki Ramayan, Ayodha Kand 96:1-2)</p>

<p>See the mistranslation done by Geeta press, Gorakhpur. Word “meat” is mistranslated as fruit and plants parts!!Though Original Sanskrit text is talking about meat that is meant for eating; meat that is roasted well on fire but in hindi translation readers are told that fruits and plant parts were meant for eating and cooked well on fire </p>
<p><strong>C. Shri Ram chandr ji and Shri Lakshman killing animals for meat</strong></p>
<p>2. <em>Sanskrit text</em></p>
<p>तौ तत्र <strong>हत्वा</strong> चतुरो महामृगान्      वराहमृश्यं पृषतं महारुरुम् ।</p>
<p>आदाय मेध्यं त्वरितं बुभुक्षितौ      वासाय काले ययतुर्वनस्पतिम्</p>
<p>(Valmiki Ramayan, Ayodha Kand 52:102)</p>
<p><em>Word by word Sanskrit to english translation</em></p>
<p>बुभुक्षितौ being very hungry, तौ they, तत्र there, <strong>वराहम् a boar</strong>, <strong>ऋश्यम् a white footed male antelope</strong>, <strong>पृषतम् spotted deer</strong>, <strong>महागुरुम् a great deer with black stripes</strong>, चतुरः four, मृगान् animals, <strong>हत्वा</strong> <strong>killed</strong>, <strong>मेध्यम् pure meat</strong>, त्वरितम् quickly, <strong>आदाय partaking as food</strong>,काले in the evening time, वासाय for rest, वनस्पतिम् under a tree, ययतुः reached.</p>
<p>Being famished, <strong>Rama, Lakshmana hunted and killed a boar, a Rishya animal (a white footed male antelope), a spotted deer and a great deer with black stripes and quickly partaking the pure meat</strong> reached a tree by the evening to spend the night. (Valmiki Ramayan, Ayodha Kand 52:102)</p>

<p>In the below photo taken from the site <a href="http://nyktrivedi.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/valmiki-ramayan-sanskrit-hindi-vol-02-ayodhya-kaand-purvardh1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">http://nyktrivedi.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/valmiki-ramayan-sanskrit-hindi-vol-02-ayodhya-kaand-purvardh1.pdf<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>  one can see how readers are made to understand things wrongly.</p>

<p>The Sanskrit word HATWA (हत्वा) = after KILLING. But it’s wrongly translated as “shikaar kheli” i.e. (they enjoyed hunting???)</p>
<p>Similarly word  Medhyam (मेध्यम्) = pure meat here. But it is wrongly translated as “kand mul, phal” i.e. Plants, fruits etc </p>
<p>Can you see this open forgery?</p>

<p>Yet again we can see entirely different translation. Text says that Shri Ram chandr ji and Lakshman ji killed various animals and took meat from it but translation says that they merely threw at animals and took plant food for eating Is not this literal scam? People are being fooled.</p>
<p><strong>D. Shri Ram chandr ji and lakshman ji killing animals for sacrifice</strong></p>

<p>Once again this publication – Geeta press, Gorakhpur – has made mockery of Sanskrit to hindi translation. Revered personality lakshaman follows order of his elder brother Shri Ram chandr and got the meat drained off blood; roasted it well and cooked it. But hindi translation is telling different story about some plant / vegetable.</p>

<p>Same story of literal fraud is repeated here. Sanskrit text is openly abused and wrong translation is being presented to the innocent mass. People are made to believe that Non-veg food is against their culture while sacred books talk about “god” eating animal meat after killing them.</p>

<p>Geeta press, Gorakhpur – again misleads the common mass. The Sanskrit text is talking about Shri ram chandr ji bringing meat of animals after killing deer, alligators, hogs/pigs for purpose of eating; but the hindi translation speaks about “fruit” for eating . Fooling the common mass!!!</p>
<p><strong>F. Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>1.      Majority of our Hindu brethren are made to believe that Non-veg food is against their culture and tradition. They are told that Hinduism is against killing of animals for food. However a careful study of  their sacred scripture gives entirely different picture.</p>
<p>2.      Valmiki Ramayan not only speaks about shri Ram chandr ji – who is worshipped by millions of Indians as ideal person – eating meat but gives the picture that he was very fond of it.</p>
<p>3.      Shri Ram chandr ji would kill animals, get meat to eat. He would order his brother Shri lakshmana ji to do the same. They would offer animals for sacrifice also.</p>
<p>4.      Unfortunately some Ramayana publications grossly mistranslate such sholkas of Valmiki Ramayan that speaks about meat eating and animal killing. They not only mislead common mass but also disrespect scripture by not giving its due.</p>
<p>5.      It’s heartening to note that some translators DO have translated such sholkas correctly and accepted meat eating and animal killing in Ramayana.</p>
<p>6.      When Ramayana speaks about permissibility of meat eating then one should not lead common mass into believing wrong thing.</p>
<p>7.      Intention is not at all to hurt any of our brethren but to draw attention towards the literary fraud done by some publications and wrong principles preached by some people.</p>
<p>8.      We have not speculated, assumed or guessed but presented correct translation of such references done by learned Hindu Scholars.</p>
<p>9.      Also its time for our Indian brethren to wake up and understand the tactics of some elements of our society who use meat eating as a political tool to divide people. Due to the sensitive nature of the topic some of our innocent’s brethren get carried away in emotion and don’t look at facts. Let’s not be divided and don’t let people polarize the society.</p>
<p>10.  Let us not allow anti-social elements to spread hatred, create division and polarize hearts of fellow countrymen in the name of meat and animals.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>:  Lets look at another source which proves our point. Please find below translation of above mentioned verses from Scholars of Hindu scriptures available at other site: <a href="http://www.valmikiramayan.net/" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">http://www.valmikiramayan.net/<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>

<p class="story-body__introduction">BBC report: http://www.bbc.com/hindi/india/2015/04/150402_beef_ban_ambedkar_hindu_ate_cow_rd</p>
<p class="story-body__introduction"><strong>भारतीय संविधान के प्रमुख निर्माताओं में से एक डॉक्टर बीआर अंबेडकर अच्छे शोधकर्ता भी थे. उन्होंने गोमांस खाने के संबंध में एक निबंध लिखा था, &#8216;क्या हिंदुओं ने कभी गोमांस नहीं खाया?&#8217;</strong></p>
<p>यह निबंध उनकी किताब, &#8216;अछूतः कौन थे और वे अछूत क्यों बने?&#8217; में है.<br />
<span id="more-2544"></span><br />
दिल्ली विश्वविद्यालय में राजनीति विज्ञान के प्रोफ़ेसर शम्सुल इस्लाम ने इस निबंध को संपादित कर इसके कुछ हिस्से बीबीसी हिंदी के पाठकों के लिए उपलब्ध करवाए हैं.</p>
<h2 class="story-body__crosshead">&#8216;पवित्र है इसलिए खाओ&#8217;</h2>
<figure class="media-landscape no-caption full-width"></figure>
<figure class="media-landscape no-caption full-width"><span class="image-and-copyright-container"> <span class="story-image-copyright"><br />
</span> </span></figure>
<p>अपने इस लेख में अंबेडकर हिंदुओं के इस दावे को चुनौती देते हैं कि हिंदुओं ने कभी गोमांस नहीं खाया और गाय को हमेशा पवित्र माना है और उसे अघन्य (जिसे मारा नहीं जा सकता) की श्रेणी में रखा है.<br />
अंबेडकर ने प्राचीन काल में हिंदुओं के गोमांस खाने की बात को साबित करने के लिए हिन्दू और बौद्ध धर्मग्रंथों का सहारा लिया.<br />
उनके मुताबिक, &#8220;गाय को पवित्र माने जाने से पहले गाय को मारा जाता था. उन्होंने हिन्दू धर्मशास्त्रों के विख्यात विद्वान पीवी काणे का हवाला दिया. काणे ने लिखा है, ऐसा नहीं है कि वैदिक काल में गाय पवित्र नहीं थी, लेकिन उसकी पवित्रता के कारण ही बाजसनेई संहिता में कहा गया कि गोमांस को खाया जाना चाहिए.&#8221; (मराठी में धर्म शास्त्र विचार, पृष्ठ-180).<br />
अंबेडकर ने लिखा है, &#8220;ऋगवेद काल के आर्य खाने के लिए गाय को मारा करते थे, जो खुद ऋगवेद से ही स्पष्ट है.&#8221;</p>
<figure class="media-landscape no-caption full-width"></figure>
<figure class="media-landscape no-caption full-width"><span class="image-and-copyright-container"> <span class="story-image-copyright"><br />
</span> </span></figure>
<p>ऋगवेद में (10. 86.14) में इंद्र कहते हैं, &#8220;उन्होंने एक बार 5 से ज़्यादा बैल पकाए&#8217;. ऋगवेद (10. 91.14) कहता है कि अग्नि के लिए घोड़े, बैल, सांड, बांझ गायों और भेड़ों की बलि दी गई. ऋगवेद (10. 72.6) से ऐसा लगता है कि गाय को तलवार या कुल्हाड़ी से मारा जाता था.&#8221;</p>
<h2 class="story-body__crosshead">&#8216;अतिथि यानि गाय का हत्यारा&#8217;</h2>
<p>अंबेडकर ने वैदिक ऋचाओं का हवाला दिया है जिनमें बलि देने के लिए गाय और सांड में से चुनने को कहा गया है.<br />
अंबेडकर ने लिखा &#8220;तैत्रीय ब्राह्मण में बताई गई कामयेष्टियों में न सिर्फ़ बैल और गाय की बलि का उल्लेख है बल्कि यह भी बताया गया है कि किस देवता को किस तरह के बैल या गाय की बलि दी जानी चाहिए.&#8221;<br />
वो लिखते हैं, &#8220;विष्णु को बलि चढ़ाने के लिए बौना बैल, वृत्रासुर के संहारक के रूप में इंद्र को लटकते सींग वाले और माथे पर चमक वाले सांड, पुशन के लिए काली गाय, रुद्र के लिए लाल गाय आदि.&#8221;</p>
<figure class="media-landscape no-caption full-width"></figure>
<figure class="media-landscape no-caption full-width"></figure>
<p>&#8220;तैत्रीय ब्राह्मण में एक और बलि का उल्लेख है जिसे पंचस्रदीय-सेवा बताया गया है. इसका सबसे महत्वपूर्ण तत्व है, पांच साल के बगैर कूबड़ वाले 17 बौने बैलों का बलिदान और जितनी चाहें उतनी तीन साल की बौनी बछियों का बलिदान.&#8221;<br />
अंबेडकर ने जिन वैदिक ग्रंथों का उल्लेख किया है उनके अनुसार मधुपर्क नाम का एक व्यंजन इन लोगों को अवश्य दिया जाना चाहिए- (1) ऋत्विज या बलि देने वाले ब्राह्मण (2) आचार्य-शिक्षक (3) दूल्हे (4) राजा (5) स्नातक और (6) मेज़बान को प्रिय कोई भी व्यक्ति.<br />
कुछ लोग इस सूची में अतिथि को भी जोड़ते हैं.<br />
मधुपर्क में &#8220;मांस, और वह भी गाय के मांस होता था. मेहमानों के लिए गाय को मारा जाना इस हद तक बढ़ गया था कि मेहमानों को &#8216;गोघ्न&#8217; कहा जाने लगा था, जिसका अर्थ है गाय का हत्यारा.&#8221;</p>
<h2 class="story-body__crosshead">&#8216;सब खाते थे गोमांस&#8217;</h2>
<figure class="media-landscape no-caption full-width"></figure>
<figure class="media-landscape no-caption full-width"></figure>
<p>इस शोध के आधार पर अंबेडकर ने लिखा कि एक समय हिंदू गायों को मारा करते थे और गोमांस खाया करते थे जो बौद्ध सूत्रों में दिए गए यज्ञ के ब्यौरों से साफ़ है.<br />
अंबेडकर ने लिखा है, &#8220;कुतादंत सुत्त से एक रेखाचित्र तैयार किया जा सकता है जिसमें गौतम बुद्ध एक ब्राह्मण कुतादंत से जानवरों की बलि न देने की प्रार्थना करते हैं.&#8221;<br />
अंबेडकर ने बौद्ध ग्रंथ संयुक्त निकाय(111. .1-9) के उस अंश का हवाला भी दिया है जिसमें कौशल के राजा पसेंडी के यज्ञ का ब्यौरा मिलता है.<br />
संयुक्त निकाय में लिखा है, &#8220;पांच सौ सांड, पांच सौ बछड़े और कई बछियों, बकरियों और भेड़ों को बलि के लिए खंभे की ओर ले जाया गया.&#8221;<br />
अंत में अंबेडकर लिखते हैं, &#8220;इस सुबूत के साथ कोई संदेह नहीं कर सकता कि एक समय ऐसा था जब हिंदू, जिनमें ब्राह्मण और गैर-ब्राह्मण दोनों थे, न सिर्फ़ मांस बल्कि गोमांस भी खाते थे.&#8221;<br />

अर्थात गौ के मांस से श्राद्ध करने पर पितरों की एक साल के लिए तृप्ति होती है<br />
मनुस्मृति में<br />
उष्&#x200d;ट्रवर्जिता एकतो दतो गोव्&#x200d;यजमृगा भक्ष्&#x200d;याः &#8212; मनुस्मृति 5/18 मेधातिथि भाष्&#x200d;य<br />
ऊँट को छोडकर एक ओर दांवालों में गाय, भेड, बकरी और मृग भक्ष्&#x200d;य अर्थात खाने योग्&#x200d;य है</span></div>
<div><span class="Apple-style-span"><br />
महाभारत में रंतिदेव नामक एक राजा का वर्णन मिलता है जो गोमांस परोसने के कारण यशवी बना. महाभारत, वन पर्व (अ. 208 अथवा अ.199) में आता है<br />
राज्ञो महानसे पूर्व रन्तिदेवस्&#x200d;य वै द्विज<br />
द्वे सहस्रे तु वध्&#x200d;येते पशूनामन्&#x200d;वहं तदा<br />
अहन्&#x200d;यहनि वध्&#x200d;येते द्वे सहस्रे गवां तथा<br />
समांसं ददतो ह्रान्नं रन्तिदेवस्&#x200d;य नित्&#x200d;यशः<br />
अतुला कीर्तिरभवन्&#x200d;नृप्&#x200d;स्&#x200d;य द्विजसत्तम &#8212;- महाभारत, वनपर्व 208 199/8-10<br />
अर्थात राजा रंतिदेव की रसोई के लिए दो हजार पशु काटे जाते थे. प्रतिदिन दो हजार गौएं काटी जाती थीं<br />
मांस सहित अन्&#x200d;न का दान करने के कारण राजा रंतिदेव की अतुलनीय कीर्ति हुई.<br />
इस वर्णन को पढ कर कोई भी व्&#x200d;यक्ति समझ सकता है कि गोमांस दान करने से यदि राजा रंतिदेव की कीर्ति फैली तो इस का अर्थ है कि तब गोवध सराहनीय कार्य था, न कि आज की तरह निंदनीय</span></div>
<div><span class="Apple-style-span"><br />
<strong>रंतिदेव का उल्&#x200d;लेख महाभारत </strong>में अन्&#x200d;यत्र भी आता है. शांति पर्व, अध्&#x200d;याय 29, श्&#x200d;लोक 123 में आता है कि राजा रंतिदेव ने गौओं की जा खालें उतारीं, उन से रक्&#x200d;त चूचू कर एक महानदी बह निकली थी. वह नदी चर्मण्&#x200d;वती (चंचल) कहलाई.<br />
महानदी चर्मराशेरूत्&#x200d;क्&#x200d;लेदात् संसृजे यतः<br />
ततश्&#x200d;चर्मण्&#x200d;वतीत्&#x200d;येवं विख्&#x200d;याता सा महानदी<br />
कुछ लो इस सीधे सादे श्&#x200d;लोक का अर्थ बदलने से भी बाज नहीं आते. वे इस का अर्थ यह कहते हैं कि चर्मण्&#x200d;वती नदी जीवित गौओं के चमडे पर दान के समय छिडके गए पानी की बूंदों से बह निकली.<br />
इस कपोलकप्ति अर्थ को शाद कोई स्&#x200d;वीकार कर ही लेता यदि कालिदास का &#8216;मेघदूत&#8217; नामक प्रसिद्ध खंडकाव्&#x200d;य पास न होता. &#8216;मेघदूत&#8217; में कालिदास ने एक जग लिखा है<br />
व्&#x200d;यालंबेथाः सुरभितनयालम्&#x200d;भजां मानयिष्&#x200d;यन्<br />
स्रोतोमूर्त्&#x200d;या भुवि परिणतां रंतिदेवस्&#x200d;य कीर्तिम<br />
यह पद्य पूर्वमेघ में आता है. विभिन्&#x200d;न संस्&#x200d;करणों में इस की संख्&#x200d;या 45 या 48 या 49 है. इस का अर्थ हैः &#8221;हे मेघ, तुम गौओं के आलंभन (कत्&#x200d;ल) से धरती पर नदी के रूप में बह निकली राजा रंतिदेव की कीर्ति पर अवश्&#x200d;य झुकना.&#8221;<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Written by Satish Chand Gupta</p>
<p>पुस्तक में मांसाहार संबंधी विषय पर व्यापक आपत्तियां और प्रतिक्रियाएं प्राप्त हुई हैं। लिखित रूप में मुझे किसी आलोचक का कोई पत्र प्राप्त नहीं हुआ है। सभी आपत्तियां मौखिक रूप से बातचीत के दौरान और फोन पर की गई हैं। सभी आलोचकों ने एक ही बात कही है कि हिंदू शास्त्रों में कहीं भी जीव हत्या और मांस भक्षण का उल्लेख नहीं है। जीव हत्या और मांस भक्षण क्रूरता और जघन्य पाप है।<br />
जिन लोगों ने हिंदू धर्म ग्रंथों का गंभीरता और गहनता के साथ अध्ययन किया है उन्हें यह बात आसानी से समझ में आ रही होगी कि मांस भक्षण के उक्त तथाकथित आलोचकों ने हिंदू शास्त्रों को पढ़ा तो क्या छुआ तक नहीं है। मांसाहार के अनेक हिंदू आलोचक मुझे ऐसे भी मिले हैं जो मांस भक्षण करते हैं, परंतु फिर भी मांसाहार का प्रबल विरोध करते हैं। इस तरह की मानसिकता के लोगों को क्या कहा जाएगा ?<br />
उक्त विषय पर अनेक पढ़े-लिखे लोगों से मेरा विचार-विमर्श और चर्चा हुई है और होती रहती है, उनको मैंने हिंदू धर्म ग्रंथों वेद, रामायण, महाभारत, मनुस्मृति आदि में उल्लिखित मांस भक्षण से संबंधित मंत्रों और ‘लोकों को दिखाया तो उनमें से किसी का जवाब था कि किताबों में अर्थ का अनर्थ किया गया है। किसी ने मंत्र पढ़कर किताब को अलटा-पलटा और जवाब दिया कि हमारी इन किताबों में मुसलमानों ने गड़बड़ की है।<br />
जिन लोगों से मेरी बातचीत हुई वे सभी उच्च शिक्षा प्राप्त (Well Educated) थे, मगर उनमें मुझे न कोई तर्क शक्ति (Reasoning Power) नज़र आई और न ही उनमें कोई विश्लेषण शक्ति (Analysis Power) मुझे दिखाई दी। जो लोग मांस खाते हैं और मांस भक्षण का विरोध करते हैं उनमें तर्क शक्ति (Logical Power) भला हो भी कैसे सकती है?<br />
<span id="more-2038"></span><br />
एक वाकिये का उल्लेख करना यहां प्रासंगिक (Relevant) होगा। सन् 2006 के उत्तर प्रदेश नगर निकाय चुनाव में मेरी डयूटी पोलिंग अधिकारी के रूप में लगी। जिस मतदान केन्द्र पर मेरी डयूटी थी उस केन्द्र पर दो पोलिंग पार्टियों में कुल मिलाकर 18 मतदान कर्मी थे। सभी कर्मी हिंदू थे। मतदान से पहले दिन हम लोग मतदान केन्द्र पर पहुंच गए। दोनों मतदान स्थल पर हिंदू मुस्लिम दोनों के मतदाताओं की संख्या लगभग आधी-आधी थी। शाम को सभी लोगों का खाना दोनों ही तरफ से लाया गया। किसी मतदान अधिकारी ने मुसलमान अभिकर्ता द्वारा खाने के विषय में पूछने पर उसे इशारा कर दिया था कि खाने में नानवेज बनवाए। एक तरफ से दाल-चावल, रोटी और दूसरी तरफ से नानवेज बनवाकर लाया गया। 18 लोगों में एक व्यक्ति ऐसा था जिसने दाल रोटी खायी। 17 लोगों ने दाल को हाथ तक नहीं लगाया। क्या उक्त वाकिये से यह साबित नहीं होता कि हम अंदर से कुछ और हैं और बाहर से कुछ और। यह भी मुमकिन है कि उक्त सभी लोग अपने समाज में शाकाहार के समर्थक और प्रचारक हों। क्या यही है हम और यही है हमारा चरित्र और आचरण ?<br />
आज हम वैज्ञानिक युग में जी रहे हैं। दुनिया में कहां क्या हो रहा है यह भी हमारी आंखों के सामने है। आज किसे मालूम नहीं है कि आर्यों के इस देश भारत में हजारों मांस प्रसंस्करण ईकाइयां (डमंज च्तवबमेेपदह न्दपजे) काम कर रही हैं। किसे मालूम नहीं कि स्वामी दयानंद और स्वामी रामदेव के इस देश भारत में प्रतिदिन अरबों रुपयों का डिब्बा बंद मांस निर्यात होता है। किसे मालूम नहीं है कि शाकाहार वादियों (म्गजतमउपेजे टमहमजंतपंदपेउ) के इस देश भारत में मछली पालन और मुर्गी पालन को बढ़ावा देने के लिए हमारी सरकार अनुदान (ैनइेपकल) दे रही है। अगर मांस का उक्त कारोबार क्रूरता और पाप की पराकाष्ठा है तो हमारे धर्मगुरु क्यों चुप हैं?<br />
कल तक हिंदू राष्ट्र कहे जाने वाले पड़ोसी देश नेपाल के विश्व प्रसिद्ध गढ़ी माई मंदिर में प्रतिवर्ष करीब 200000 (दो लाख) पशुओं की बलि दी जाती है। क्या यह वही नेपाल नहीं है जहां अहिंसा के संदेशवाहक गौतम बुद्ध का जन्म हुआ था ?<br />
नीचे हिंदू धर्मग्रंथों से मांस भक्षण संबंधी कुछ उदाहरण प्रस्तुत किए जा रहे हैं। मांसाहार के आलोचक और विरोधी इन्हें गंभीरता से पढ़े। मुझे उम्मीद है कि प्रबुद्ध आलोचक इन उदाहरणों को पढ़कर अपनी आपत्तियों पर पुनर्विचार करेंगे और अवश्य किसी निश्चित निष्कर्ष पर पहुंचेंगे।<br />
<span class="Apple-tab-span"><br />
</span><br />
ऋग्वेद के निम्न मंत्र को देखिए-<br />
उक्ष्णो   हि    मे   पंचदश   साकं   पचन्ति   विंशमित्।<br />
उताहमद्मि पवि इदुभा कुक्षी पृणन्ति में विश्वस्मादिन्द्र उत्तरः।।<br />
(ऋग्वेद, 10-86-14)<br />
<span class="Apple-tab-span"><br />
</span><br />
भावार्थ &#8211; मेरे लिए इंद्राणी द्वारा प्रेरित यज्ञकर्ता लोग 15-20 बैल मार कर पकाते हैं, जिन्हें खाकर मैं मोटा होता हूँ। वे मेरी कुक्षियों को भी सोम रस से भरते हैं।<br />
यजुर्वेद के एक मंत्र में पुरुषमेध का प्राचीन इतिहास इस तरह प्रस्तुत किया गया है।<br />
देवा यद्यज्ञं तन्वानाऽ अवध्नन् पुरुषं पशुम।<br />
(यजुर्वेद, 31-15)<br />
<span class="Apple-tab-span"><br />
</span><br />
भावार्थ &#8211; इंद्र आदि देवताओं ने पुरुषमेध किया और पुरुष नामक पशु का वध किया।<br />
अथर्ववेद में स्पष्ट ‘ाब्दों में पांच प्राणियों को देवता के लिए बलि दिए जाने योग्य कहा है &#8211;<br />
तवेमे पंच पशवो विभक्ता गावो अश्वाः पुरुषा अजावयः।<br />
(अथर्ववेद, 11-29-2)<br />
भावार्थ &#8211; हे पशुपति देवता, तेरे लिए गाय, घोड़ा, पुरुष, बकरी और भेड़ ये पांच पशु नियत हैं।<br />
<span class="Apple-tab-span"><br />
</span><br />
मनुस्मृति जो स्वामी दयानंद के चिंतन का मुख्य आधार रही है उसमें न केवल मांस भक्षण का उल्लेख और संकेत है, बल्कि मांस भक्षण की स्पष्ट अनुमति दी गई है। मनुस्मृति में मांस भक्षण की अनुमति के साथ मांस भक्षण की उपयोगिता और महत्व भी बताया गया है &#8211;<br />
यज्ञे वधोऽवधः।<br />
(मनु0, 5-39)<br />
भावार्थ &#8211; यज्ञ में किया गया वध, वध नहीं होता।<br />
<span class="Apple-tab-span"><br />
</span><br />
या वेदविहिता हिंसा नियतास्ंिमश्चराचरे।<br />
अहिंसामेव तां विद्याद्वेदाद्धर्मो हि निर्बभौ।।<br />
(मनु0, 5-44)<br />
भावार्थ &#8211; जिस हिंसा का वेदों में विधान किया गया है, वह हिंसा न होकर अहिंसा ही है, क्योंकि हिंसा, अहिंसा का निर्णय वेद करता है।<br />
<span class="Apple-tab-span"><br />
</span><br />
एष्वर्थेषु पशून्हिसन्वेदतत्त्वार्थविद्द्विजः।<br />
आत्मानं च पशुं चैव गमयत्युत्तमां गतिम्।।<br />
(मनु0, 5-42)<br />
भावार्थ &#8211; वेद-कर्मज्ञ द्विज यज्ञ-कर्म में पशु वध करता है तो वह पशु-सहित उत्तम गति को प्राप्त करता है।<br />
उष्ट्रवर्जिता एकतो दतो गोऽव्यजमृगा भक्ष्याः।<br />
(मनु0, 5-18)<br />
भावार्थ- ऊंट को छोड़कर एक ओर दांतवालों में गाय, भेड़, बकरी और मृग भक्ष्य अर्थात् खाने योग्य हैं।<br />
‘वभिर्हतस्य यन्मांसं ‘ाुचि तन्मनुरब्रवीत।<br />
क्रव्याöिश्च हतस्यान्यैश्चाण्डालाद्यैश्च दस्युभिः।।<br />
(मनु0, 5-134)<br />
भावार्थ- मनु के अनुसार, कुत्तों द्वारा पकड़े गए मृग, ‘ोरों द्वारा खाया गया कच्चा मांस, चांडाल व चोरों द्वारा मारे गए मृग का मांस शुद्ध है।<br />
दौ मासौ मत्स्यमांसेन त्रीन्मासान् हारिणेन तु।<br />
औरभ्रेणाथ चतुरः ‘ााकुनेनाथ पत्र्च वै।।<br />
(मनु0, 3-269)<br />
भावार्थ- विधि-विधान के द्वारा प्रदत्त मछली के मांस से मानव-पितर दो महीने तक, मृग के मांस से तीन महीने तक, भेड़ के मांस से चार महीने तक, पक्षियों के मांस से पांच महीने तक तृप्त संतुष्ट होते हैं।<br />
“ाण्मासांश्छागमांसेन पार्षतेन च सप्त वै।<br />
अष्टावैणेस्यमांसेन रौरवेण नवैव तु।।<br />
(मनु0, 3-270)<br />
भावार्थ- बकरे, चित्रमृग, भेड़ व रूरूमृग के मांस से क्रमशः सात, आठ और नौ महीने तक मानव-पितर तृप्त-संतुष्ट रहते हैं।<br />
दशामासांस्तु तृप्यन्ति वराहमहिषामिषैः।<br />
‘ाशकूर्मयोस्तु मांसेन मासानेकादशैव तु।।<br />
(मनु0, 3-271)<br />
भावार्थ- सूअर और भैंस के मांस से मानव-पितर दस महीने तक संतृप्त रहते हैं और खरगोश व कछुए के मांस से ग्यारह महीने तक।<br />
<span class="Apple-tab-span"><br />
</span><br />
महाभारत में आया है &#8211;<br />
गव्येन दत्तं श्राद्धे तु संवत्सरमिहोच्येत।<br />
(अनुशासन पर्व, 88-5)<br />
भावार्थ- गौ के मांस से श्राद्ध करने पर पितरों की एक साल के लिए तृप्ति होती है।<br />
महाभारत में रंतिदेव नामक एक राजा का वर्णन मिलता है जो गोमांस परोसने के कारण यशस्वी बना। महाभारत, वन पर्व में आता है &#8211;<br />
राज्ञो महानसे पूर्व रन्तिदेवस्य वै द्विज,<br />
द्वे सहस्रे तु वध्येते पशूनामन्वहं तदा,<br />
अहन्यहनि वध्येते द्वे सहस्रे गवां तथा,<br />
समांसं ददतो ह्यन्नं रन्तिदेवस्य नित्यशः,<br />
अतुला कीर्तिरभवन्नृपस्य द्विजसत्तम,<br />
(वनपर्व 208-8,10)<br />
भावार्थ- राजा रंतिदेव की रसोई के लिए दो हजार पशु काटे जाते थे। प्रतिदिन दो हजार गाय काटी जाती थी। मांस सहित अन्न का दान करने के कारण राजा रंतिदेव की अतुलनीय कीर्ति हुई।<br />
<span class="Apple-tab-span"><br />
</span><br />
उक्त से कमअक़्ल व्यक्ति भी समझ सकता है कि महाभारत काल में गोवध और गोमांस भक्षण सराहनीय कार्य था न कि निंदनीय।<br />
श्रीमद्वाल्मीकीय रामायण में भी मांस भक्षण का स्पष्ट उल्लेख है। निम्न ‘लोक देखिए-<br />
जब भरत सेना सहित भरद्वाज मुनि के आश्रम में जाते हैं तो भरद्वाज मुनि के आश्रम में भरत का सेना सहित मृग, मोर और मुर्गों के मांस से स्वागत सत्कार होता है।<br />
वाप्यो मैरेयपूर्णाश्च मृष्टमांसचयैर्वृताः।<br />
प्रतप्तपिठरैश्चापि मार्गमायूरकौक्कुटैः।।<br />
(अयोध्या कांड, 91-70)<br />
भावार्थ &#8211; भरत की सेना में आये हुए निषाद आदि निम्न वर्गों के लोगों की तृप्ति के लिए वहां मधु से भरी हुई बावड़ियां प्रकट हो गई थी तथा उनके तटोंपर तपे हुए पिठर (कुण्ड) में पकाये हुए मृग, मोर और मुर्गाें के स्वच्छ मांस भी ढेर के ढेर रख दिये गये थे। जब रावण सीता के हरण की नीयत से साधु का वेष बनाकर वन में सीता के पास जाता है तो सीता अपना परिचय देते हुए रावण से राम के विषय में बतलाती है-<br />
रुरून् गोधान् वराहांश्च हत्वाऽ ऽदायामिषं बहु।।<br />
स त्वं नाम च गोत्रं च कुलमाचक्ष्व तत्त्वतः।।<br />
एकश्च दण्डकारण्ये किमर्थ चरसि द्विज।।<br />
(अरण्यकांड, 47-23, 24)<br />
भावार्थ- ‘रुरू, गोह और जंगली सूअर आदि हिंसक पशुओं का वध करके तपस्वी जनों के उपभोग में आने योग्य बहुत सा फल-मूल लेकर वे अभी आयेंगे। (उस समय आपका विशेष सत्कार होगा)। ब्रहान्! अब आप भी अपने नाम गोत्र और कुल का ठीक-ठीक परिचय दीजिए। आप अकेले इस दण्डकारण्य में किस लिये विचरते हैं ?<br />
श्री राम जब गंगा पार करके समृद्धिशाली वत्स देश (प्रयाग) में पहुंचे तो वहां लक्ष्मण सहित दोनों भाइयों ने चार महामृगों का शिकार किया।<br />
तौ तत्र हत्वा चतुरो महामृगान्<br />
वराहमृश्यं पृषतं महारुरुम्।<br />
आदाय मेध्यं त्वरितं बुभुक्षितौ<br />
वासाय काले ययतुर्वनस्पतिम्।।<br />
(अयोध्याकांड, 52-102)<br />
भावार्थ- वहां उन  दोनों भाइयों ने मृगया विनोद के लिए वराह, ऋश्य, पृषत् और महारुरु- इन चार महामृगों पर बाणों का प्रहार किया। तत्पश्चात् जब उन्हें भूख लगी, तब पवित्र कंद-मूल आदि लेकर सायंकाल के समय ठहरने के लिए (सीताजी के साथ) एक वृक्ष के नीचे चले गये।<br />
<span class="Apple-tab-span"><br />
</span><br />
स्वामी तुलसीदास कृत रामचरितमानस का भी एक दोहा देखिए-<br />
बंधु  सखा  संग लेहिं बोलाई। बन मृगया नित खेलहिं जाई।।<br />
पावन मृग मारहिं जियं जानी। दिन प्रति नृपहि देखावहिं आनी।<br />
(बालकांड, 204-1)<br />
भावार्थ- श्रीराम चन्द्र जी भाइयों और इष्ट-मित्रों को बुलाकर साथ ले लेते हैं और नित्य वन में जाकर शिकार खेलते हैं। मन में पवित्र समझकर मृगों को मारते हैं और प्रतिदिन लाकर राजा (दशरथ जी) को दिखलाते हैं।<br />
<span class="Apple-tab-span"><br />
</span><br />
श्रीमद्वाल्मीकीय रामायण में राजा दशरथ द्वारा किए गए अश्वमेध यज्ञ का वर्णन मिलता है। बाल कांड में आता है कि राजा दशरथ के कोई संतान नहीं थी। पुत्रोत्पत्ति की लालसा से राजा दशरथ ने सरयू नदी के उत्तर तट पर यज्ञ भूमि का निर्माण कर शास्त्रोक्त रीति से यज्ञ किया।<br />
देखिए अयोध्या राजा दशरथ द्वारा किया गया अश्व-<br />
मेध नामक महायज्ञ किस प्रकार संपन्न हुआ।<br />
अथ संवत्सरे पूर्णे तस्मिन् प्राप्ते तुरंगमे ।<br />

हयस्य यानि चांगनि तानि सर्वाणि ब्राह्मणाः<br />
अग्नौ प्रास्यन्ति विधिवत् समस्ताः“ाोडशत्र्विजः<br />
इधर वर्ष पूरा होने पर यज्ञ सम्बन्धी अश्व भूमण्डल में भ्रमण करके लौट आया। फिर सरयू नदी के उत्तर तट पर राजा का यज्ञ आरम्भ हुआ।<br />
महामनस्वी राजा दशरथ के उस अश्वमेध नामक महायज्ञ में ़ऋष्य श्रृंग को आगे करके श्रेष्ठ ब्राह्मण यज्ञ सम्बन्धी कार्य करने लगे।<br />
वहाँ पूर्वोक्त यूपों में शास्त्र विहित पशु, सर्प और पक्षी विभिन्न देवताओं के उद्देश्य से बाँधे गये थे ।<br />
‘ाामित्र कर्म में यज्ञिय अश्व तथा कूर्म आदि जलचर जन्तु जो वहाँ लाये गये थे, ऋषियों ने उन सबको शास्त्र विधि के अनुसार पूर्वोक्त यूपों में बाँध दिया।<br />
उस समय उन यूपों में तीन सौ पशु बँधे हुए थे तथा राजा दशरथ का वह उत्तम अश्वरत्न भी वहीं बाँधा गया था।<br />
रानी कौसल्या ने वहाँ प्रोक्षण आदि के द्वारा सब ओर से उस अश्वका संस्कार करके बड़ी प्रसन्नता के साथ तीन तलवारों से उसका स्पर्श किया।<br />
तद्नन्तर कौसल्या देवी ने सुस्थिर चित्त से धर्मपालन की इच्छा रखकर उस अश्व के निकट एक रात निवास किया।<br />
तत्पश्चात् होता, अध्वर्यु और उदªाता ने राजा की (क्षत्रिय जातीय) महिषी ‘कौसल्या’, (वैश्य जातीय स्त्री) ‘वावाता’ तथा (शूद्र जातीय स्त्री) ‘परिवृत्ति’- इन सबके हाथ से उस अश्व का स्पर्श कराया।<br />
इसके बाद परम चतुर जितेन्द्रिय ऋत्विक् ने विधि पूर्वक अश्वकन्द के गूदे को निकालकर शास्त्रोक्त रीति से पकाया।<br />
तत्पश्चात् उस गूदे की आहुति दी गयी। राजा दशरथ ने अपने पाप को दूर करनेे के लिये ठीक समय पर आकर विधि पूर्वक उसके धुएँ की गन्ध को सूँघा।<br />
उस अश्वमेध यज्ञ के अंग्भूत जो-जो हवनीय पदार्थ थे, उन सबको लेकर समस्त सोलह ऋृत्विज ब्राह्मण अग्नि में विधिवत् आहुति देने लगे।<br />
(बालकांड, 14-1,2,30-38)<br />
<span class="Apple-tab-span"><br />
</span><br />
ऊपर जो लिखा गया है वह तो अति संक्षेप में है, वरना हिंदू धर्मग्रंथों में इस विषय पर अभी और बहुत कुछ है। आलेख अधिक लम्बा न हो इसलिए कुछ ग्रंथों जैसे उपनिषद् और चरक संहिता आदि को छोड़ दिया गया है। जो लोग कहते हैं कि हिंदू धर्म ग्रंथों में ऊपर जो लिखा गया है वह तो अति संक्षेप में है, वरना हिंदू धर्मग्रंथों में इस विषय पर अभी और बहुत कुछ है। आलेख अधिक लम्बा न हो इसलिए कुछ ग्रंथों जैसे उपनिषद् और चरक संहिता आदि को छोड़ दिया गया है। जो लोग कहते हैं कि हिंदू धर्म ग्रंथों में पशुबलि, जीव हत्या और मांस भक्षण का कहीं कोई उल्लेख नहीं है वे लोग अपने धर्मग्रंथों से क़तई अनभिज्ञ हैं। इतिहास इस बात का साक्षी है कि आर्य मांस प्रेमी थे, यज्ञों में पशु बलि को वे बहुत अधिक पुण्य का कार्य समझते थे। अतः यह सत्य है कि मांस भक्षण विज्ञान सम्मत तो है ही, धर्मशास्त्र सम्मत भी है।<br />
<span class="Apple-tab-span"><br />
</span><br />
अगर हम अंधविश्वास और रुढ़िवादिता को छोड़कर उक्त वैज्ञानिक सत्य को स्वीकार कर लें तो ऐसा करने से हमारी कौन सी नाक कट जाएगी? एक वैज्ञानिक सत्य को अपनाने से हम कौन सा असभ्य और अनैतिक साबित हो जाएंगे? एक वैज्ञानिक सत्य को मानने से हम कौन सा कमजोर और बुद्धिहीन समझे जाएंगे?</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Written by Sulaiman Razvi Cow is holy animal in Hinduism.

Cow is holy animal in Hinduism. Cow is so revered among Hindus that even its wastes like dung and urine is considered sacred and it is claimed that the Panchagavya (Cow urine, dung, milk, curd &amp; Ghee) can cure many diseases. There is no stopping for cow vigilantism in India, people are lynched to death over beef and women thrashed and raped for beef. Cow has more value than humans in India. Due to the reverence of cow, Hindus ignore the environmental damage caused by cows and Gaushalas (cow shelters). Cow emits greenhouse gasses like CO2 and Methane and Methane is denser greenhouse gas than CO2, these gasses are dangerous for our environment. But according to Vedic scientists cow is a useful animal and not a dangerous animal in fact they even say that cow exhales oxygen.<br />
<span id="more-2973"></span><br />
Hindus are trying to impose their food habits on others, there is already a ban on beef in India except for few states. But that doesn&#8217;t seem to satisfy Hindus, they are trying to show that beef is prohibited in other religions as well and are coming with some weird reasons on why one shouldn&#8217;t have beef. They present their views backed by unproven scientific evidence that too conducted by cow loving Hindus only. They also try to show scientific evidence on how beef consumption is bad for environment. Well, Hindus takes only those scientific research which seems to favor them and reject the one which doesn&#8217;t favor them, like consumption of cow urine is scientifically proven to be harmful that can even lead to death but Hindus doesn&#8217;t agree with this scientific finding because it contradicts their views on cow urine which according to them has cure for almost all diseases.<br />
Coming to the point. I came across an article widely shared by Hindus on social media which says that giving up beef is good for environment. Hindus have hastily shared the article without reading the article and what really is causing it. As you may know, cow emits methane gas more than a car which is dangerous for our environment, rearing cattle requires 28 times more land than pigs, goats or chicken, 10-11 times more water and more food is required to feed cows than to feed other livestock like pigs, goats and chicken. And this is how beef is more dangerous than other foods but our Vedic scientists and beef-haters didn&#8217;t care to read this. Even vegetable food requires water, land to grow, it requires energy to be stored in refrigerator, it needs to be transported to reach the desired destination in between the journey of vegetables to final destination, fuel burns up and the vehicle transporting it emits harmful gasses. So even vegetarian food is harmful for environment but lesser one. <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/greenhouse-gas-emissions-from-indian-paddy-fields-very-high-study/article24925357.ece" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">The study published in PNAS<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> says Greenhouse gas emissions from Indian paddy fields is very high So what I am trying to say is that Beef industry is considered harmful only because cattle requires land, excessive water and fodder to feed the animals. Taking this into consideration even Gaushala (cow shelters) in India is equally harmful to environment as beef industry because both these things requires large land to shelter the cows, requires water to quench the thirst of cows, at least nearly 40-50 kilograms of fodders for each cow every day. So if Hindus wants non-vegetarians to give up beef because beef industry is impacting environment then Hindus should also give up the idea of having Gaushala (Cow shelters). At least beef industry is contributing to the economic growth of the country by paying taxes, beef is a billion dollar business in India whereas Gaushalas does nothing except for sucking money out of people for maintenance of Gaushala and feeding animals instead of feeding poor people.<br />
Many Hindus are not aware that there are separate farming for milk production known as dairy farming and beef industry for beef, when you say that &#8220;I love beef&#8221; to a Hindu (probably on internet otherwise you will be lynched) the defensive Hindu will tell you that &#8220;if cows starts to be slaughtered everyday then we will run out of milk, so to maintain average milk production cow slaughter must be stopped&#8221;. Five products of cow are sacred in Hinduism Cow urine, dung, milk, ghee and curd which is considered Panchagavya. Even dairy industry is on par with beef industry according to experts in terms of emission of greenhouse gasses. Let&#8217;s have a look at what the article says which is widely shared by Hindu apologists on the internet. The article is titled &#8220;Giving up beef will reduce carbon footprint more than cars, says expert&#8221; Published on Monday 21 July 2014 by theguardian.com. It says,<br />
&#8220;Study shows red meat dwarfs others for environmental impact, using 28 times more land and 11 times water for pork or chicken&#8221;<br />
&#8220;The heavy impact on the environment of meat production was known but the research shows a new scale and scope of damage, particularly for beef. <span style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;">The popular red meat requires 28 times more land to produce than pork or chicken, 11 times more water</span> and results in five times more climate-warming emissions.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;<span style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;">Eshel&#8217;s team analysed how much land, water and nitrogen fertiliser was needed to raise beef and compared this with poultry, pork, eggs and dairy produce</span>. Beef had a far greater impact than all the others because as ruminants, cattle make far less efficient use of their feed. &#8220;Only a minute fraction of the food consumed by cattle goes into the bloodstream, so the bulk of the energy is lost,&#8221; said Eshel. Feeding cattle on grain rather than grass exacerbates this inefficiency, although <span style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;">Eshel noted that even grass-fed cattle still have greater environmental footprints than other animal produce</span>. The footprint of lamb, relatively rarely eaten in the US, was not considered in the study <a href="http://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1402183111" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>.&#8221;<br />
<strong>Source</strong>: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jul/21/giving-up-beef-reduce-carbon-footprint-more-than-cars" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jul/21/giving-up-beef-reduce-carbon-footprint-more-than-cars<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a><br />
So beef production leads to global warming not because cow releases some kind of magical gasses when slaughtered but because rearing cow requires more land, more water, more crops for feeding and <span style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;">most importantly</span> because cows emits more greenhouse gasses than a car that&#8217;s leading to global warming. So in this way even Gaushalas will impact the environment. Following are some evidence for my claim although the article shared by Hindu apologists itself proves my point,<br />
<strong>Cattle used for ploughing, milk production will also be dangerous to environment as well as cattle cultivation</strong><br />
&#8220;Livestock such as cows, buffalo, goats, sheep, horses and mules are indispensable to India&#8217;s rural economy — whether the animals are yoked to plow land, raised for milk and manure or harnessed to pull carts to move goods and people. The Ministry of Agriculture estimates that livestock contribute 5.3% to total GDP, up from 4.8% during 1980-81. But, says K.K. Singhal, head of dairy cattle nutrition at the National Dairy Research Institute in Karnal in northern India, &#8220;while livestock plays a crucial role in the economy, global warming is becoming a huge worry. We&#8217;re trying to find indigenous solutions, because our realities are very different from the West.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;For starters, most Indian livestock is underfed and undernourished, unlike its robust counterparts in richer countries. The typical Indian farmer is unable to buy expensive dietary supplements even for livestock of productive age, and dry milch cattle and older farm animals are invariably turned out to fend for themselves. Poor-quality feed equals poor animal health as well as higher methane production.&#8221;<br />
<a href="http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1890646,00.html" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1890646,00.html<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a><br />
&#8220;Climate-warming gases emitted by manure, feed production, milk processing and even cows&#8217; burping are a concern. But the F.A.O. says that globally, the dairy industry has made real environmental strides since 2006, when it <a href="http://www.fao.org/docrep/010/a0701e/a0701e00.HTM" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">warned<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> that livestock was one of the two or three most environmentally damaging sectors, polluting &#8220;on a massive scale.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;In the San Joaquin Valley, though, environmentalists and residents say they are still paying the price for the world&#8217;s taste for milk, cheese and yogurt, in the form of tainted water, terrible odors, flies and fumes that add to the region&#8217;s severe air pollution.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;The American Lung Association says the region suffers from America&#8217;s highest levels of the tiny, airborne pollution particles that are linked to ailments like heart attacks and strokes. Many sources contribute, including heavy truck traffic and the dairy and feed processing facilities whose vast tanks and chutes line Highway 99. Nearby mountains exacerbate the problem by holding stagnant air in place.<br />
Near a big cow farm in Riverdale, residents &#8220;are not comfortable even going outside on most summer days, they&#8217;re not comfortable inviting people to their homes and they&#8217;re not comfortable having their children play outside,&#8221; said Cesar Campos, coordinator at the Central California Environmental Justice Network, in Fresno. &#8220;Dairies, there is that smell attached to it, it is impossible for the community to ignore.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Globally, dairy production accounted for 2.8 percent of all man-made climate-warming gases in 2005, the most recent year for which data is available, she said.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;On his computer, at home amid Shafter&#8217;s almond fields, Mr. Frantz pulled up a <a href="http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2014/09oct_methanehotspot/" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">satellite map<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> showing a yellow-orange blob indicating elevated levels of the potent climate-warming gas methane over the region. &#8220;That&#8217;s not an industrial area,&#8221; he said, pointing. &#8220;There&#8217;s no source of methane except the cows.&#8221;<br />
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/04/business/energy-environment/how-growth-in-dairy-is-affecting-the-environment.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/04/business/energy-environment/how-growth-in-dairy-is-affecting-the-environment.html<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a><br />
&#8220;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Environmentalists often note that cattle cultivation is a critical source of greenhouse gas emissions, with methane 105 times the potency of carbon dioxide</span>. Pasturing a growing population of slaughter-free cattle can also displace wildlife, air-purifying vegetation, and agricultural crops.&#8221;<br />

<strong>Study says cow urine may be a reason for global warming</strong><br />
Cow urine — a minor fount of research in India for its medicinal benefits — may also contribute to global warming. The urine from the ruminant is a source of nitrous oxide emissions (N2O), a gas that is 300 times more powerful than carbon dioxide. Most times, when cow urine is used in degraded pastures, which are also seen in vast tracts of land in India, N2O emissions are tripled, says a study conducted in Colombia, Argentina, Brazil, Nicaragua, Trinidad and Tobago, and published in the latest edition of the peer-reviewed Scientific Reports.<br />
<a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/study-says-cow-urine-may-be-a-reason-for-global-warming/article26131810.ece" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/study-says-cow-urine-may-be-a-reason-for-global-warming/article26131810.ece<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p><strong>Cows of dairy farms and meat industry leading to global warming and Indian cow produces more methane.</strong><br />
&#8220;New research suggests that the methane emissions are far higher than estimated earlier. Data published last year in the <em>Asian-Australasian Journal of Animal Sciences</em> shows that <span style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;">India&#8217;s livestock annually produces 14.32 million tonnes of GHG, which is a whopping 15.1 per cent of the global total</span>. This is alarmingly much higher than the nine million tonnes estimated in 1994 or the figure of 11.75 million tonnes published by scientists at the Ahmedabad-based Space Applications Centre in February 2009.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;There&#8217;s more. The world&#8217;s largest producer of milk at roughly 140 million tonnes a year, the country must considerably crank up production to 180 million tonnes over the next five years to cater to the needs of its growing population and expanding disposable incomes. <span style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;">Projected demands for meat and dairy products suggest that methane and other GHGs from Indian livestock could swell to nearly 19 million tonnes by 2050. Half of this will, unbelievably, be emitted from our cows</span>.<br />
&#8220;EPA (the US Environmental Protection Agency) estimates that &#8220;a single cow can produce between 250 and 500 litres of methane a day&#8221;. Indian cows, as any animal husbandry expert will confirm, are far more flatulent and produce much higher volumes of methane. Unlike dairy operations in western nations, where the animals are fed scientifically with regular dietary interventions to increase digestive efficiency, livestock in India is relatively undernourished. Only a small handful of farmers are ever able to afford the high cost of regulated feed and dietary supplements.&#8221;<br />
<a href="http://www.dailyo.in/politics/indian-cows-flatulent-global-warming-cow-worship-haryana-milch-beef/story/1/6670.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">http://www.dailyo.in/politics/indian-cows-flatulent-global-warming-cow-worship-haryana-milch-beef/story/1/6670.html<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a><br />
<strong>Methane is 20 times more damaging than CO2, and gasses from Cow is more dangerous than a car</strong><br />
&#8220;The emissions produced by nature&#8217;s woodwind section contain a nasty mix of many gasses, among them methane. Though carbon dioxide is the first gas that comes to mind when we think of greenhouse emissions, pound for pound, methane is more than 20 times more powerful in terms of its global warming potential. Methane doesn&#8217;t linger in the atmosphere quite as long as CO2, and it&#8217;s not produced industrially in anywhere near the same quantity, but it does its damage all the same — and livestock toots out a surprisingly large share of it.<br />
<span style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;">According to one Danish study, the average cow produces enough methane per year to do the same greenhouse damage as four tons of CO2. The average car, by contrast, produces just 2.7 tons</span>. Multiply that by the planet&#8217;s 1.5 billion cattle and buffalo and 1.8 billion smaller ruminants and you have the methane equivalent of two billion tons of CO2 per year. According to the U.K. Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA), livestock account for about 4.5% of all of the country&#8217;s annual greenhouse gas emissions. Globally the figure is thought to be higher — about six percent.&#8221;<br />
<a href="http://science.time.com/2011/03/30/silence-the-cows-and-save-the-planet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">http://science.time.com/2011/03/30/silence-the-cows-and-save-the-planet/<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a><br />
&#8220;Agriculture accounts for approximately 16% of Australia&#8217;s total greenhouse gas emissions, with direct on farm emissions from dairy farms contributing about 19% of this, (or about 3% of total national emissions).&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Each individual dairy farm will have a different emissions profile depending upon their farm system. Approximately 60 to 70% of a typical dairy farm&#8217;s emissions arise from methane produced by the rumination of cows. Nitrous oxide arising from dung and urine contributes about 10%, while energy and indirect losses from wet soils contribute a similar amount. The contribution from the production of electricity used on farm is also about 10%.&#8221;<br />
<a href="http://agriculture.vic.gov.au/agriculture/dairy/emissions-in-dairy" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">http://agriculture.vic.gov.au/agriculture/dairy/emissions-in-dairy<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a><br />
&#8220;The dairy sector makes up for around four per cent of all global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, says a report by the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations.<br />
Anthropogenic (caused or produced by human beings) greenhouse gases (GHG) include carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide.<br />
&#8220;This figure (4 per cent) includes emissions from production, processing and transportation of milk products as well as those related to meat produced from animals originating from the dairy system,&#8221; FAO said in a statement highlighting findings of its study.<br />
The dairy sector contributes 2.7 per cent of global anthropogenic GHG emissions, if meat production is excluded.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;In 2007, the dairy sector emitted 1,969 million tonnes (MT) of carbon dioxide equivalent, of which 1,328 MT is attributed to milk, 151 MT to meat from culled dairy animals, and 490 MT from calves from the dairy sector that were raised for meat.&#8221;<br />

<strong>Cows consumes lot of water and requires lot of fodder</strong><br />
&#8220;Ranching, the report adds, is &#8220;the major driver of deforestation&#8221; worldwide, and overgrazing is turning a fifth of all pastures and ranges into desert. Cows also soak up vast amounts of water: it takes a staggering 990 litres of water to produce one litre of milk.&#8221;<br />
<a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/climate-change/cow-emissions-more-damaging-to-planet-than-co2-from-cars-427843.html" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/climate-change/cow-emissions-more-damaging-to-planet-than-co2-from-cars-427843.html<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a><br />
&#8220;The poor feed quality in impoverished regions like sub-Saharan Africa means that a cow there may consume as much as 10 times more feed — mostly grasses — to produce a kilogram of protein than a cow raised in richer regions. That lack of efficiency also means that cattle in countries like Ethiopia and Somalia account for as much as 1,000 kg of carbon for every kg of protein they produce — in the form of methane from manure as well as from the reduced carbon absorption that results when forests are converted to pastureland. That&#8217;s 10 times higher than the amount of carbon released per kg of protein in many parts of the U.S. and Europe, where livestock production is much more intensive.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;About that: in North America or Europe, a cow consumes about 75 kg to 300 kg of dry matter — grass or grain — to produce a kg of protein. In sub-Saharan Africa, a cow might need 500 kg to 2,000 kg of dry matter to produce a kg of protein, because of the poor feed quality in arid countries and because of the high mortality rates in herds of often undernourished and sick animals.&#8221;<br />
<a href="http://science.time.com/2013/12/16/the-triple-whopper-environmental-impact-of-global-meat-production/" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">http://science.time.com/2013/12/16/the-triple-whopper-environmental-impact-of-global-meat-production/<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a><br />
<strong>Crops production for feeding cows results in global biodiversity loss<br />
</strong><br />
&#8220;Firstly, there&#8217;s the issue that when it comes to livestock, reducing emissions isn&#8217;t the only challenge. Duncan Williamson, corporate stewardship manager at WWF-UK, voiced his concern yesterday in a press release response to the FAO study. &#8220;Around 30% of global biodiversity loss can be attributed to livestock production, such as the spread of pasture land or turning over forests and savannahs…to feed production.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;The FAO&#8217;s last livestock report, a 2006 assessment titled <a href="http://www.fao.org/newsroom/en/news/2006/1000448/index.html" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Livestock&#8217;s Long Shadow<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, found that farms breeding chickens, pigs, and cows for meat and dairy products, produced a disconcerting 18% of global greenhouse gas emissions.&#8221;<br />
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/world-on-a-plate/2013/sep/27/environment-food-ipcc-emissions-greenhouse-gas-livestock-vegetarian-meat" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">https://www.theguardian.com/environment/world-on-a-plate/2013/sep/27/environment-food-ipcc-emissions-greenhouse-gas-livestock-vegetarian-meat<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>

<p>Experts have also suggested that greenhouse gasses from beef industry can be cut to a huge amount just by changing the diet of cows. So cows whether living or dead are dangerous for environment. There might be a solution to this in future or we can use Swami Dayanand Saraswati&#8217;s solution mentioned in his book which says that &#8220;It is the business of the State to punish or even kill all those men and animals that are injurious (to the community).&#8221; Ironically Hindus have become environmentalist when the matter is related to beef but finds no problem polluting the environment during their festivals like Ganesh Chaturthi, Durga idol immersion, Holi and especially Diwali.<br />

As we witness yet another incident of violence in the name of stopping cow-slaughter by groups of vigilantes known as <em>gau-rakshaks, </em>we revisit BR Ambedkar’s 1948 work <em>The Untouchables: Who Were They and Why They Became Untouchables?, </em>which grapples with many of the issues that continue to plague India even today.</p>
<blockquote class="cms-block cms-block-quote"><p>What is the cause of the nausea which the Hindus have against beef-eating? Were the Hindus always opposed to beef-eating? If not, why did they develop such a nausea against it? Were the Untouchables given to beef-eating from the very start? Why did they not give up beef-eating when it was abandoned by the Hindus? Were the Untouchables always Untouchables? If there was a time when the Untouchables were not Untouchables even though they ate beef why should beef-eating give rise to Untouchability at a later-stage? If the Hindus were eating beef, when did they give it up? If Untouchability is a reflex of the nausea of the Hindus against beef-eating, how long after the Hindus had given up beef-eating did Untouchability come into being?</p></blockquote>
<p>Ambedkar&#8217;s conclusions, based on an analysis of various religious texts, will seem more than deeply ironical to anyone who studies contemporary India, for the father of Indian Constitution argued that Brahmins who once had no compunctions against slaughter of animals, including cows, and were the greatest beef-eaters themselves, not only gave up beef-eating but also started worshipping the cow as a deliberate strategy.</p>
<blockquote class="cms-block cms-block-quote"><p>The clue to the worship of the cow is to be found in the struggle between Buddhism and Brahmanism and the means adopted by Brahmanism to establish its supremacy over Buddhism.</p></blockquote>
<p>Earlier in the book, Ambedkar introduces the concept of Broken Men, whom he describes as follows:</p>
<blockquote class="cms-block cms-block-quote"><p>In a tribal war it often happened that a tribe instead of being completely annihilated was defeated and routed. In many cases a defeated tribe became broken into bits. As a consequence of this there always existed in Primitive times a floating population consisting of groups of Broken tribesmen roaming in all directions.</p></blockquote>
<p>He also makes the assumption that</p>
<blockquote class="cms-block cms-block-quote"><p>“Untouchables are Broken Men belonging to a tribe different from the tribe comprising the village community.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Ambedkar’s third assumption is that</p>
<blockquote class="cms-block cms-block-quote"><p>“Broken Men were the followers of Buddhism and did not care to return to Brahmanism when it became triumphant over Buddhism”.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>What follows are excerpts from Chapter 9 to 14:</em><br />
The Broken Men hated the Brahmins because the Brahmins were the enemies of Buddhism and the Brahmins imposed untouchability upon the Broken Men because they would not leave Buddhism. On this reasoning it is possible to conclude that one of the roots of untouchability lies in the hatred and contempt which the Brahmins created against those who were Buddhist.<br />
Can the hatred between Buddhism and Brahmanism be taken to be the sole cause why Broken Men became Untouchables? Obviously, it cannot be. The hatred and contempt preached by the Brahmins was directed against Buddhists in general and not against the Broken Men in particular. Since untouchability stuck to Broken Men only, it is obvious that there was some additional circumstance which has played its part in fastening untouchability upon the Broken Men. What that circumstance could have been? We must next direct our effort in the direction of ascertaining it.]
<strong>Beef-eating as the root of Untouchability </strong><br />
[&#8230;]The Census Returns [of 1910] show that the meat of the dead cow forms the chief item of food consumed by communities which are generally classified as untouchable communities. No Hindu community, however low, will touch cow’s flesh. On the other hand, there is no community which is really an Untouchable community which has not something to do with the dead cow. Some eat her flesh, some remove the skin, some manufacture articles out of her skin and bones.<br />
From the survey of the Census Commissioner, it is well established that Untouchables eat beef. The question however is: Has beef-eating any relation to the origin of Untouchability? Or is it merely an incident in the economic life of the Untouchables?<br />
Can we say that the Broken Men to be treated as Untouchables because they ate beef? There need be no hesitation in returning an affirmative answer to this question. No other answer is consistent with facts as we know them.<br />
In the first place, we have the fact that the Untouchables or the main communities which compose them eat the dead cow and those who eat the dead cow are tainted with untouchability and no others. The co-relation between untouchability and the use of the dead cow is so great and so close that the thesis that it is the root of untouchability seems to be incontrovertible.<br />
In the second place if there is anything that separates the Untouchables from the Hindus, it is beef-eating. Even a superficial view of the food taboos of the Hindus will show that there are two taboos regarding food which serve as dividing lines.<br />
There is one taboo against meat-eating. It divides Hindus into vegetarians and flesh eaters. There is another taboo which is against beef eating. It divides Hindus into those who eat cow’s flesh and those who do not. From the point of view of untouchability the first dividing line is of no importance. But the second is. For it completely marks off the Touchables from the Untouchables.<br />
The Touchables whether they are vegetarians or flesh-eaters are united in their objection to eat cow’s flesh. As against them stand the Untouchables who eat cow’s flesh without compunction and as a matter of course and habit.<br />
In this context it is not far-fetched to suggest that those who have a nausea against beef-eating should treat those who eat beef as Untouchables. There is really no necessity to enter upon any speculation as to whether beef-eating was or was not the principal reason for the rise of Untouchability.<br />
This new theory receives support from the Hindu Shastras. The Veda Vyas Smriti contains the following verse which specifies the communities which are included in the category of Antyajas and the reasons why they were so included</p>
<blockquote class="cms-block cms-block-quote"><p>“The Charmakars (Cobbler), the Bhatta (Soldier), the Bhilla, the Rajaka (washerman), the Puskara, the Nata (actor), the Vrata, the Meda, the Chandala, the Dasa, the Svapaka, and the Kolika – these are known as Antyajas as well as others who eat cow’s flesh.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Generally speaking, the Smritikars never care to explain the why and the how of their dogmas. But this case is exception. For in this case, Veda Vyas does explain the cause of untouchability. The clause “as well as others who eat cow’s flesh” is very important. It shows that the Smritikars knew that the origin of untouchability is to be found in the eating of beef.<br />
The dictum of Veda Vyas must close the argument. It comes, so to say, straight from the horse’s mouth and what is important is that it is also rational for it accords with facts as we know them.<br />
The new approach in the search for the origin of Untouchability has brought to the surface two sources of the origin of Untouchability. One is the general atmosphere of scorn and contempt spread by the Brahmins against those who were Buddhists and the second is the habit of beef-eating kept on by the Broken Men.<br />
As has been said the first circumstance could not be sufficient to account for stigma of Untouchability attaching itself to the Broken Men. For the scorn and contempt for Buddhists spread by the Brahmins was too general and affected all Buddhists and not merely the Broken Men.<br />
The reason why Broken Men only became Untouchables was because in addition to being Buddhists they retained their habit of beef-eating which gave additional ground for offence to the Brahmins to carry their new-found love and reverence to the cow to its logical conclusion.<br />
We may therefore conclude that the Broken Men were exposed to scorn and contempt on the ground that they were Buddhists, and the main cause of their Untouchability was beef-eating.<br />

<strong>Did the Hindus never eat beef?</strong><br />
<strong>[&#8230;] </strong>The adjective Aghnya applied to the cow in the Rig Veda means a cow that was yielding milk and therefore not fit for being killed. That the cow is venerated in the Rig Veda is of course true. But this regard and venerations of the cow are only to be expected from an agricultural community like the Indo-Aryans. This application of the utility of the cow did not prevent the Aryan from killing the cow for purposes of food. Indeed the cow was killed because the cow was regarded as sacred. As observed by Mr Kane:</p>
<blockquote class="cms-block cms-block-quote"><p>&#8220;It was not that the cow was not sacred in Vedic times, it was because of her sacredness that it is ordained in the Vajasaneyi Samhita that beef should be eaten.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>That the Aryans of the Rig Veda did kill cows for purposes of food and ate beef is abundantly clear from the Rig Veda itself. In Rig Veda (X. 86.14) Indra says:</p>
<blockquote class="cms-block cms-block-quote"><p>&#8220;They cook for one 15 plus twenty oxen&#8221;.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Rig Veda (X.91.14) says that for Agni were sacrificed horses, bulls, oxen, barren cows and rams. From the Rig Veda (X.72.6) it appears that the cow was killed with a sword or axe.<br />
[&#8230;] The correct view is that the testimony of the Satapatha Brahmana and the Apastamba Dharma Sutra in so far as it supports the view that Hindus were against cow-killing and beef-eating, are merely exhortations against the excesses of cow-killing and not prohibitions against cow-killing.<br />
Indeed the exhortations prove that cow-killing and eating of beef had become a common practice. That notwithstanding these exhortations cow-killing and beef-eating continued. That most often they fell on deaf ears is proved by the conduct of Yajnavalkya, the great Rishi of the Aryans. &#8230; After listening to the exhortation this is what Yajnavalkya said :</p>
<blockquote class="cms-block cms-block-quote"><p>&#8220;I, for one, eat it, provided that it is tender&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>That the Hindus at one time did kill cows and did eat beef is proved abundantly by the description of the Yajnas given in the Buddhist Sutras which relate to periods much later than the Vedas and the Brahmanas.<br />
The scale on which the slaughter of cows and animals took place was collosal. It is not possible to give a total of such slaughter on all accounts committed by the Brahmins in the name of religion&#8230;<br />
<strong>Why did non-Brahmins give up beef-eating?</strong><br />
[&#8230;]
Examining the legislation of Asoka the question is: Did he prohibit the killing of the cow? On this issue there seem to be a difference of opinion&#8230; Asoka had no particular interest in the cow and owed no special duty to protect her against killing. Asoka was interested in the sanctity of all life human as well as animal. He felt his duty to prohibit the taking of life where taking of life was not necessary. That is why he prohibited slaughtering animal for sacrifice which he regarded as unnecessary and of animals which are not utilised nor eaten which again would be want on and unnecessary.<br />
That he did not prohibit the slaughter of the cow in specie may well be taken as a fact which for having regard to the Buddhist attitude in the matter cannot be used against Asoka as a ground for casting blame.<br />
Coming to Manu there is no doubt that he too did not prohibit the slaughter of the cow. On the other hand he made the eating of cow&#8217;s flesh on certain occasions obligatory.This may be a novel theory but it is not an impossible theory. As the French author, Gabriel Tarde has explained that culture within a society spreads by imitation of the ways and manners of the superior classes by the inferior classes.<br />
This imitation is so regular in its flow that its working is as mechanical as the working of a natural law. Gabriel Tarde speaks of the laws of imitation. One of these laws is that the lower classes always imitate the higher classes. This is a matter of such common knowledge that hardly any individual can be found to question its validity.<br />
That the spread of the cow-worship among and cessation of beef-eating by the non-Brahmins has taken place by reason of the habit of the non-Brahmins to imitate the Brahmins who were undoubtedly their superiors is beyond dispute.Of course there was an extensive propaganda in favour of cow-worship by the Brahmins. The Gayatri Purana is a piece of this propaganda. But initially it is the result of the natural law of imitation. This, of course, raises another question: Why did the Brahmins give up beef-eating?<br />
Why did the Brahmins give up beef-eating?<br />
<strong>What made the Brahmins become vegetarians?</strong><br />
[&#8230;]
[T]here was a time when the Brahmins were the greatest beef-eaters&#8230; In a period overridden by ritualism there was hardly a day on which there was no cow sacrifice to which the Brahmin was not invited by some non-Brahmin. For the Brahmin every day was a beef-steak day. The Brahmins were therefore the greatest beef-eaters. The Yajna of the Brahmins was nothing but the killing of innocent animals carried on in the name of religion with pomp and ceremony with an attempt to enshroud it in mystery with a view to conceal their appetite for beef. Some idea of this mystery pomp and ceremony can be had from the directions contained in the Atreya Brahamana touching the killing of animals in a Yajna&#8230;<br />
[F]or generations the Brahmins had been eating beef. Why did they give up beef-eating? Why did they, as an extreme step, give up meat eating altogether and become vegetarians? It is two revolutions rolled into one.<br />
As has been shown it has not been done as a result of the preachings of Manu, their Divine Law-maker. The revolution has taken place in spite of Manu and contrary to his directions. What made the Brahmins take this step? Was philosophy responsible for it? Or was it dictated by strategy?&#8230;<br />
To my mind, it was strategy which made the Brahmins give up beef-eating and start worshipping the cow. The clue to the worship of the cow is to be found in the struggle between Buddhism and Brahmanism and the means adopted by Brahmanism to establish its supremacy over Buddhism.<br />
The strife between Buddhism and Brahmanism is a crucial fact in Indian history. Without the realisation of this fact, it is impossible to explain some of the features of Hinduism. Unfortunately students of Indian history have entirely missed the importance of this strife. They knew there was Brahmanism. But they seem to be entirely unaware of the struggle for supremacy in which these creeds were engaged and that their struggle, which extended for 400 years has left some indelible marks on religion, society and politics of India.<br />
This is not the place for describing the full story of the struggle. All one can do is to mention a few salient points. Buddhism was at one time the religion of the majority of the people of India. It continued to be the religion of the masses for hundreds of years. It attacked Brahmanism on all sides as no religion had done before.<br />
Brahmanism was on the wane and if not on the wane, it was certainly on the defensive. As a result of the spread of Buddhism, the Brahmins had lost all power and prestige at the Royal Court and among the people.<br />
They were smarting under the defeat they had suffered at the hands of Buddhism and were making all possible efforts to regain their power and prestige. Buddhism had made so deep an impression on the minds of the masses and had taken such a hold of them that it was absolutely impossible for the Brahmins to fight the Buddhists except by accepting their ways and means and practising the Buddhist creed in its extreme form.<br />
After the death of Buddha his followers started setting up the images of the Buddha and building stupas. The Brahmins followed it. They, in their turn, built temples and installed in them images of Shiva, Vishnu and Ram and Krishna etc – all with the object of drawing away the crowd that was attracted by the image worship of Buddha.<br />
That is how temples and images which had no place in Brahmanism came into Hinduism.<br />
The Buddhists rejected the Brahmanic religion which consisted of Yajna and animal sacrifice, particularly of the cow. The objection to the sacrifice of the cow had taken a strong hold of the minds of the masses especially as they were an agricultural population and the cow was a very useful animal.<br />
The Brahmins in all probability had come to be hated as the killer of cows in the same way as the guest had come to be hated as Gognha, the killer of the cow by the householder, because whenever he came a cow had to be killed in his honour. That being the case, the Brahmins could do nothing to improve their position against the Buddhists except by giving up the Yajna as a form of worship and the sacrifice of the cow.<br />
That the object of the Brahmins in giving up beef-eating was to snatch away from the Buddhist Bhikshus the supremacy they had acquired is evidenced by the adoption of vegetarianism by Brahmins.<br />
Why did the Brahmins become vegetarian? The answer is that without becoming vegetarian the Brahmins could not have recovered the ground they had lost to their rival namely Buddhism.<br />
In this connection it must be remembered that there was one aspect in which Brahmanism suffered in public esteem as compared to Buddhism. That was the practice of animal sacrifice which was the essence of Brahmanism and to which Buddhism was deadly opposed.<br />
That in an agricultural population there should be respect for Buddhism and revulsion against Brahmanism which involved slaughter of animals including cows and bullocks is only natural. What could the Brahmins do to recover the lost ground? To go one better than the Buddhist Bhikshus not only to give up meat-eating but to become vegetarians – which they did. That this was the object of the Brahmins in becoming vegetarians can be proved in various ways.<br />
If the Brahmins had acted from conviction that animal sacrifice was bad, all that was necessary for them to do was to give up killing animals for sacrifice. It was unnecessary for them to be vegetarians. That they did go in for vegetarianism makes it obvious that their motive was far-reaching.<br />
Secondly, it was unnecessary for them to become vegetarians. For the Buddhist Bhikshus were not vegetarians. This statement might surprise many people owing to the popular belief that the connection between Ahimsa and Buddhism was immediate and essential. It is generally believed that the Buddhist Bhikshus eschewed animal food. This is an error.<br />
The fact is that the Buddhist Bhikshus were permitted to eat three kinds of flesh that were deemed pure. Later on they were extended to five classes. Yuan Chwang, the Chinese traveller was aware of this and spoke of the pure kinds of flesh as San-Ching&#8230;<br />
As the Buddhist Bhikshus did eat meat the Brahmins had no reason to give it up. Why then did the Brahmins give up meat-eating and become vegetarians? It was because they did not want to put themselves merely on the same footing in the eyes of the public as the Buddhist Bhikshus.<br />
The giving up of the Yajna system and abandonment of the sacrifice of the cow could have had only a limited effect. At the most it would have put the Brahmins on the same footing as the Buddhists. The same would have been the case if they had followed the rules observed by the Buddhist Bhikshus in the matter of meat-eating. It could not have given the Brahmins the means of achieving supremacy over the Buddhists which was their ambition.<br />
They wanted to oust the Buddhists from the place of honour and respect which they had acquired in the minds of the masses by their opposition to the killing of the cow for sacrificial purposes. To achieve their purpose the Brahmins had to adopt the usual tactics of a reckless adventurer. It is to beat extremism with extremism. It is the strategy which all rightists use to overcome the leftists. The only way to beat the Buddhists was to go a step further and be vegetarians.<br />
There is another reason which can be relied upon to support the thesis that the Brahmins started cow-worship, gave up beef-eating and became vegetarians in order to vanquish Buddhism. It is the date when cow-killing became a mortal sin. It is well-known that cow-killing was not made an offence by Asoka. Many people expect him to have come forward to prohibit the killing of the cow. Prof Vincent Smith regards it as surprising. But there is nothing surprising in it.<br />
Buddhism was against animal sacrifice in general. It had no particular affection for the cow. Asoka had therefore no particular reason to make a law to save the cow. What is more astonishing is the fact that cow-killing was made a <em>Mahapataka</em>, a mortal sin or a capital offence by the Gupta Kings who were champions of Hinduism which recognised and sanctioned the killing of the cow for sacrificial purposes&#8230;<br />
The question is why should a Hindu king have come forward to make a law against cow-killing, that is to say, against the Laws of Manu? The answer is that the Brahmins had to suspend or abrogate a requirement of their Vedic religion in order to overcome the supremacy of the Buddhist Bhikshus.<br />
If the analysis is correct then it is obvious that the worship of the cow is the result of the struggle between Buddhism and Brahminism. It was a means adopted by the Brahmins to regain their lost position.<br />
<strong>Why should beef-eating make broken men Untouchables?</strong><br />
THE stoppage of beef-eating by the Brahmins and the non-Brahmins and the continued use thereof by the Broken Men had produced a situation which was different from the old. This difference lay in the face that while in the old situation everybody ate beef, in the new -situation one section did not and another did.<br />
The difference was a glaring difference. Everybody could see it. It divided society as nothing else did before. All the same, this difference need not have given rise to such extreme division of society as is marked by Untouchability. It could have remained a social difference. There are many cases where different sections of the community differ in their foods. What one likes the other dislikes and yet this difference does not create a bar between the two.<br />
There must therefore be some special reason why in India the difference between the Settled Community and the Broken Men in the matter of beef eating created a bar between the two.<br />
What can that be? The answer is that if beef-eating had remained a secular affair – a mere matter of individual taste – such a bar between those who ate beef and those who did not would not have arisen.<br />
Unfortunately beef-eating, instead of being treated as a purely secular matter, was made a matter of religion. This happened because the Brahmins made the cow a sacred animal. This made beef-eating a sacrilege. The Broken Men being guilty of sacrilege necessarily became beyond the pale of society.<br />
The answer may not be quite clear to those who have no idea of the scope and function of religion in the life of the society. They may ask: Why should religion make such a difference? It will be clear if the following points regarding the scope and function of religion are borne in mind.<br />
To begin with the definition of religion. There is one universal feature which characterises all religions. This feature lies in religion being a unified system of beliefs and practices which (1) relate to sacred things and (2) which unite into one single community all those who adhere to them.<br />
To put it slightly differently, there are two elements in every religion. One is that religion is inseparable from sacred things. The other is that religion is a collective thing inseparable from society.<br />
The first element in religion presupposes a classification of all things, real and ideal, which are the subject-matter of man&#8217;s thought, into two distinct classes which are generally designated by two distinct terms the sacred and the profane, popularly spoken of as secular.<br />
This defines the scope of religion. For understanding the function of religion the following points regarding things sacred should be noted:<br />
The first thing to note is that things sacred are not merely higher than or superior in dignity and status to those that are profane. They are just different. The sacred and the profane do not belong to the same class. There is a complete dichotomy between the two. As Prof Durkhiem observes:</p>
<blockquote class="cms-block cms-block-quote"><p>“The traditional opposition of good and bad is nothing beside this; for the good and the bad are only two opposed species of the same class, namely, morals, just as sickness and health are two different aspects of the same order of facts, life, while the sacred and the profane have always and everywhere been conceived by the human mind as two distinct classes, as two worlds between which there is nothing in common.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The curious may want to know what has led men to see in this world this dichotomy between the sacred and the profane. We must however refuse to enter into this discussion as it is unnecessary for the immediate purpose we have in mind.<br />
Confining ourselves to the issue the next thing to note is that the circle of sacred objects is not fixed. Its extent varies infinitely from religion to religion. Gods and spirits are not the only sacred things. A rock, a tree, an animal, a spring, a pebble, a piece of wood, a house, in a word anything can be sacred. Things sacred are always associated with interdictions otherwise called taboos. To quote Prof Durkhiem again:</p>
<blockquote class="cms-block cms-block-quote"><p>“Sacred things are those which the interdictions protect and isolate; profane things, those to which these interdictions are applied and which must remain at a distance from the first.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Religious interdicts take multiple forms. Most important of these is the interdiction on contact. The interdiction on contact rests upon the principle that the profane should never touch the sacred.<br />
Contact may be established in a variety of ways other than touch.<br />
A look is a means of contact. That is why the sight of sacred things is forbidden to the profane in certain cases. For instance, women are not allowed to see certain things which are regarded as sacred.<br />
The word (i.e., the breath which forms part of man and which spreads outside him) is another means of contact. That is why the profane is forbidden to address the sacred things or to utter them. For instance, the Veda must be uttered only by the Brahmin and not by the Shudra.<br />
An exceptionally intimate contact is the one resulting from the absorption of food. Hence comes the interdiction against eating the sacred animals or vegetables.<br />
The interdictions relating to the sacred are not open to discussion. They are beyond discussion and must be accepted without question. The sacred is &#8220;untouchable&#8221; in the sense that it is beyond the pale of debate. All that one can do is to respect and obey.<br />
Lastly the interdictions relating to the sacred are binding on all. They are not maxims. They are injunctions. They are obligatory but not in the ordinary sense of the word. They partake of the nature of a categorical imperative. Their breach is more than a crime. It is a sacrilege.<br />
The above summary should be enough for an understanding of the scope and function of religion. It is unnecessary to enlarge upon the subject further.<br />
The analysis of the working of the laws of the sacred which is the core of religion should enable any one to see that my answer to the question why beef-eating should make the Broken Men untouchables is the correct one. All that is necessary to reach the answer I have proposed is to read the analysis of the working of the laws of the sacred with the cow as the sacred object.<br />
It will be found that Untouchability is the result of the breach of the interdiction against the eating of the sacred animal, namely, the cow.<br />
As has been said, the Brahmins made the cow a sacred animal. They did not stop to make a difference between a living cow and a dead cow. The cow was sacred, living or dead. Beef-eating was not merely a crime. If it was only a crime it would have involved nothing more than punishment. Beef-eating was made a sacrilege. Anyone who treated the cow as profane was guilty of sin and unfit for association. The Broken Men who continued to eat beef became guilty of sacrilege.<br />
Once the cow became sacred and the Broken Men continued to eat beef, there was no other fate left for the Broken Men except to be treated unfit for association, i.e., as Untouchables.<br />
<strong>Obvious objections</strong><br />
Before closing the subject it may be desirable to dispose of possible objections to the thesis. Two such objections to the thesis appear obvious.<br />
One is what evidence is there that the Broken Men did eat the flesh of the dead cow. The second is why did they not give up beef-eating when the Brahmins and the non-Brahmins abandoned it.<br />
These questions have an important bearing upon the theory of the origin of untouchability advanced in this book and must therefore be dealt with.<br />
The first question is relevant as well as crucial. If the Broken Men were eating beef from the very beginning, then obviously the theory cannot stand. For, if they were eating beef from the very beginning and nonetheless were not treated as Untouchables, to say that the Broken Men became Untouchables because of beef-eating would be illogical if not senseless.<br />
The second question is relevant, if not crucial. If the Brahmins gave up beef-eating and the non-Brahmins imitated them why did the Broken Men not do the same? If the law made the killing of the cow a capital sin because the cow became a sacred animal to the Brahmins and non-Brahmins, why were the Broken Men not stopped from eating beef? If they had been stopped from eating beef there would have been no Untouchability.<br />
The answer to the first question is that even during the period when beef-eating was common to both, the Settled Tribesmen and the Broken Men, a system had grown up whereby the Settled Community ate fresh beef, while the Broken Men ate the flesh of the dead cow. We have no positive evidence to show that members of the Settled Community never ate the flesh of the dead cow. But we have negative evidence which shows that the dead cow had become an exclusive possession and perquisite of the Broken Men.<br />
The evidence consists of facts which relate to the Mahars of the Maharashtra to whom reference has already been made. As has already been pointed out, the Mahars of the Maharashtra claim the right to take the dead animal. This right they claim against every Hindu in the village. This means that no Hindu can eat the flesh of his own animal when it dies. He has to surrender it to the Mahar. This is merely another way of stating that when eating beef was a common practice the Mahars ate dead beef and the Hindus ate fresh beef.<br />
The only questions that arise are: Whether what is true of the present is true of the ancient past? Can this fact which is true of the Maharashtra be taken as typical of the arrangement between the Settled Tribes and the Broken Men throughout India?<br />
In this connection reference may be made to the tradition current among the Mahars according to which they claim that they were given 52 rights against the Hindu villagers by the Muslim King of Bedar. Assuming that they were given by the King of Bedar, the King obviously did not create them for the first time. They must have been in existence from the ancient past. What the King did was merely to confirm them. This means that the practice of the Broken Men eating dead meat and the Settled Tribes eating fresh meat must have grown in the ancient past.<br />
That such an arrangement should grow up is certainly most natural. The Settled Community was a wealthy community with agriculture and cattle as means of livelihood. The Broken Men were a community of paupers with no means of livelihood and entirely dependent upon the Settled Community. The principal item of food for both was beef. It was possible for the Settled Community to kill an animal for food because it was possessed of cattle. The Broken Men could not for they had none.<br />
Would it be unnatural in these circumstances for the Settled Community to have agreed to give to the Broken Men its dead animals as part of their wages of watch and ward? Surely not. It can therefore be taken for granted that in the ancient past when both the Settled Community and Broken Men did eat beef the former ate fresh beef and the latter of the dead cow and that this system represented a universal state of affairs throughout India and was not confined to the Maharashtra alone.<br />
This disposes of the first objection. To turn to the second objection. The law made by the Gupta Emperors was intended to prevent those who killed cows. It did not apply to the Broken Men. For they did not kill the cow. They only ate the dead cow. Their conduct did not contravene the law against cow-killing. The practice of eating the flesh of the dead cow therefore was allowed to continue.<br />
Nor did their conduct contravene the doctrine of Ahimsa assuming that it has anything to do with the abandonment of beef-eating by the Brahmins and the non-Brahmins. Killing the cow was Himsa. But eating the dead cow was not. The Broken Men had therefore no cause for feeling qualms of conscience in continuing to eat the dead cow. Neither the law nor the doctrine of Himsa could interdict what they were doing, for what they were doing was neither contrary to law nor to the doctrine.<br />
As to why they did not imitate the Brahmins and the non-Brahmins the answer is two fold. In the first place, imitation was too costly. They could not afford it. The flesh of the dead cow was their principal sustenance. Without it they would starve.<br />
In the second place, carrying the dead cow had become an obligation though originally it was a privilege. As they could not escape carrying the dead cow they did not mind using the flesh as food in the manner in which they were doing previously.<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By Mahadev Chakravarti</p>
<p><strong>BEEF-EATING was not peculiar to the people of the Western countries alone, but was popular with the Vedic Indians also.</strong> The food items of the Vedic Indian can be gathered from the list of sacrificial victims because what man ate he usually presented to his gods.<a name="_ftnref1"></a>[1] Practically all the important ceremonies and sacrifices were attended with slaughter of bulls and cows. The <em>Gomedha</em> and <em>Asvamedha</em> sacrifices are important in this respect. The <em>Sulagava</em> sacrifice, in which the bull, as the name implies, seems to have been pierced with a spike or lance to appease Rudra, is described in detail in the <em>grhyasutras</em>.</p>
<p><span id="more-19"></span></p>
<p><strong><em>Restrictions in Vedic Literature </em></strong></p>
<p>In a hymn of the <em>RgVeda</em> it is said that “Indra will eat thy bulls.”<a name="_ftnref2"></a>[2] In another hymn of the <em>RgVeda</em><a name="_ftnref3"></a>[3] Agni is styled <em>Uksanna</em> and <em>Vasanna</em> i.e. “eater of bulls and barren cows.” Not only for the purpose of sacrifices but for food also, the bovine species were killed in regular slaughter-houses and this is evident from another hymn of the <em>RgVeda</em>.<a name="_ftnref4"></a>[4] Again, it is suggested in the <em>RgVeda</em> that the cow was cut up with a sword or axe.<a name="_ftnref5"></a>[5] It is interesting to note in this context that the modern Hindu practice of Jhatka-bali, that is, severing the head of the animal at one stroke, had not yet come into fashion. <strong>There are ample evidences how the <em>Rgvedic</em> people were fond of beef-eating. Even in funeral ceremony beef-eating was considered an essential part.</strong><a name="_ftnref6"></a>[6]
<p><strong>Interestingly enough in the same <em>Veda</em> the cow is sometimes considered inviolable as indicated by her designation <em>aghnya</em></strong> (‘not to be slain’) which occurs sixteen times in the entire <em>RgVeda</em>,<a name="_ftnref7"></a>[7] as opposed to three instances of <em>aghnya</em><a name="_ftnref8"></a>[8] (masculine). <strong>But this fact cannot be regarded as showing that beef-eating was condemned in the <em>Rgvedic</em> period.</strong> In this connection, we should point out that the Sanskrit word used for the sacrificial cow is Vasa (i.e. ‘sterile cow’) and a milch cow was seldom sacrificed.<a name="_ftnref9"></a>[9] It is only in this way that one can explain the lavish praise bestowed on the cow in the <em>RgVeda</em> where she is described in a number of hymns as “the mother of Rudras, the daughter of the vasus, the sister of Adityas, and the centre of nectar.”<a name="_ftnref10"></a>[10]
<p>Although we have three references of <em>aghnya</em> in the <em>RgVeda</em>, still apparently no strict restriction in regard to the slaughter of bulls (as opposed to milch cows) is found. It seems probable that some composers of <em>Rgvedic</em> hymns were pre-Aryan (non-Aryan) Indians (who disliked beef-eating) who became Aryanized like the Asuras and the Vratyas and labelled the whole bovine species inviolable, because outside India this inviolability is utterly unknown.<a name="_ftnref11"></a>[11]
<p>In the days of <em>Atharva Veda</em> beef-eating remained unaltered, although it was censured here and there in that <em>Veda</em>. <strong>During the <em>Brahmana</em> period the habit of beef-eating seems to have increased.</strong> Among the <em>Kamya Ishtis</em> or minor sacrifices set forth in the <em>Taittiriya</em> <em>Brahmana</em> different bovine species were sacrificed to different gods, namely, a dwarf ox to Visnu, a drooping horned bull with a blaze on the forehead to Indra, a red cow to Rudra, a white barren cow to Surya and so on. The <em>Aitareya</em> <em>Brahmana</em> lists the bull as one of the sacrificial animals<strong>.<a name="_ftnref12"></a>[12] From the <em>Taittiriya</em> and the <em>Pancavimsa</em> <em>Brahmana</em>swe learn that the sage Agastya slaughtered hundred bulls at a sacrifice</strong>.’<a name="_ftnref13"></a>[13] The <em>Satapatha</em> <em>Brahmana</em> gives a picture of the inordinate fondness of Yajnavalkya for beef who said: “I for one eat it, provided it is tender (amsala)”.<a name="_ftnref14"></a>[14] But, <strong>strangely enough, we are to face two exhortations in the same <em>Brahmana</em> against eating beef</strong>.<a name="_ftnref15"></a>[15]
<p>Among the <em>Sutras</em>, <em>kalpasutra</em> and <em>grhyasutra</em>, display less reticence and distinctly suggest beef as an item of food on different occasions of life. According to <em>Sankhyayana</em>–<em>sutra</em> <strong>a bull or a sterile cow should be killed in the house of the father of the bride on the wedding day and also in the house of the bridegroom when the husband and the wife arrive after marriage</strong>.<a name="_ftnref16"></a>[16] Even at <em>sraddhas</em> or periodical oblations to the manes, the sacrifice of a bull or cow is recommended by the <em>Apastamba</em> and <em>Paraskara</em> <em>grhyasutras</em>.<a name="_ftnref17"></a>[17] <strong>Yajnavalkya indicates how the aroma of beef was thought to be an ailment for the spirits</strong>.<a name="_ftnref18"></a>[18] According to <em>Vasistha</em>–<em>sutra</em> “an ascetic who, invited to dine at a sacrifice . . . rejects meat shall go to hell for as many years as the slaughtered beast has hairs.”<a name="_ftnref19"></a>[19] The <em>Khadira</em> and <em>Gobhila</em>–<em>Sutras</em> prescribed the sacrifice of a black cow to the deity of the dwelling-houses when a new house was constructed.<a name="_ftnref20"></a>[20]
<p>Distinguished guests like one’s teachers, priests, kings, bridegrooms and Vedic students on their return home after the completion of their studies are to be honoured with the presentation of a bull or a barren cow to be slaughtered – hence, a guest is denominated in the Vedic literature as <em>goghna</em> or cow-killer.<a name="_ftnref21"></a>[21] The ceremony of madhuparka is notable in this context. The madhuparka ceremony seems to have been very old because <strong>the custom of entertaining a distinguished guest with beef is found both in the <em>Satapatha</em> <em>Brahmana</em><a name="_ftnref22"></a>[22] and the <em>Aitareya</em> <em>Brahmana</em></strong><a name="_ftnref23"></a>[23] and it was in all likelihood known also in the <em>Rgvedic</em> period.</p>
<p><strong><em>Moral Codes and Beef-eating </em></strong></p>
<p>We now turn to the <em>Smrti</em> literature. Manu, like Vasistha, sanctions the consumption of the flesh of all domestic animals which have but one row of teeth.<a name="_ftnref24"></a>[24] That this would obviously include beef becomes clear from the comments of even such orthodox pundits like Medhatithi and Raghavananda.<a name="_ftnref25"></a>[25] <strong>Manu also recommends the madhuparka with beef for the reception of kings.</strong><a name="_ftnref26"></a>[26] The <em>Yajnavalkya-smrti</em> distinctly lays down that a <em>mah-oksa</em> or ‘big bull’ is to be slaughtered on such occasions.<a name="_ftnref27"></a>[27] In fact, both the Manu and Yajnavalkya-<em>Smrti</em>s permit the killing of bovine species on such special occasions, in sacrifices and in rites for manes etc.; otherwise beef-eating was regarded as <em>upapataka</em> or minor offence, though not <em>mahapataka</em> or mortal sin.<a name="_ftnref28"></a>[28] In spite of the individual predilections of the author of <em>Manu-Smrti</em>, who was a staunch upholder of <em>ahimsa</em>, who even said that no flesh can be had without killing living beings and killing such beings cannot lead to heaven and so one should give up flesh eating,<a name="_ftnref29"></a>[29] the general usage was different in his times and centuries were required before the views propounded by Manu became predominant.<a name="_ftnref30"></a>[30]
<p><strong><em>From Ancient Science and Literature </em></strong></p>
<p><strong>The ancient medical works like the <em>Charaka Samhita</em> recommend beef for pregnant women</strong>, but prohibits it for everyday use for everybody.<a name="_ftnref31"></a>[31] R L Mitra enlightens us that <strong>in some medieval Indian medical works beef soup is especially recommended for people recovering from fainting fits</strong>.<a name="_ftnref32"></a>[32]
<p>The Epics allude to the <em>gomedha</em> without any details. In the ‘Vanaparva’ of the <em>Mahabharata</em><a name="_ftnref33"></a>[33] it is stated that animals killed in sacrifices to the accompaniment of Vedic mantras went to heaven and it narrates the story of <strong>king Rantideva in whose sacrifices two thousand animals, including cows, were killed every day</strong>. In the ‘Udyogaparva’ <strong>king Nahusha was cursed and hurled down from heaven by the great sage Agastya because he ventured to cast doubts on the Vedic injunctions for the sacrifice of cows</strong> and offered insult to a <em>Brahmana</em>.<a name="_ftnref34"></a>[34]
<p>Bhavabhuti in his <em>Uttara-Rama-Charita</em> (Act IV) describes how the venerable poet Valmiki, when preparing to receive the sage Vasistha, slaughtered a number of calves for the entertain- ment of his guest. From the <em>Mahaviracharita</em> of the same author it is evident how Vasistha, in his turn, likewise entertained Visvamitra, Janaka, Satananda and other sages with ‘fatted calf’, and tempted Jamadagnya by saying: “<strong>The heifer is ready for sacrifice and the food is cooked in ghee</strong>.”<a name="_ftnref35"></a>[35]
<p>In Kautilya’s <em>Arthasastra</em> cattle are classified, where <strong>bulls are intended for the slaughter-house</strong>, but the killing of the milch cows, and calves, though permitted for sacrificial purposes, is forbidden for butchers’ stalls.<a name="_ftnref36"></a>[36] Asoka in his Rock Edict I and Pillar Edict I declared how originally thousands of animals were killed in the royal kitchen. Considering the popularity of beef-eating among the people even Asoka, the great propagator of <em>ahimsa</em>, resolved later on to discontinue the slaughter of animals only for some days in the year; for example, he included the breeding bull but not the cow in the list of animals not to be slaughtered on those days.<a name="_ftnref37"></a>[37]
