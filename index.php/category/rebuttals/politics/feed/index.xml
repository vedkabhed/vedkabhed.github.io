<h3>ब्लॉग: अगर बाबा रामदेव भी टोपी पहेन कर कुछ बोल दें तो मीडिया उसे फतवा बना देगी!</h3>
<p>पिछले कुछ समय से अगर आप कोई न्यूज़ चैनल लगाएं। तो ये तो हो ही नही सकता के आप तलाक़, अज़ान, फ़त्वा जैसे शब्दों को न सुनें। इतने शब्द तो ETV उर्दू, मुंसिफ और ZEE सलाम जैसे “टोकन मुस्लिम” चैनेलों पर भी सुनने को नही मिलते हैं। मीडिया में रोज़ किसी न किसी विषय पर डिबेट होती है।</p>
<p>फतवा उस राय को कहा जाता है जो मुफ़्ती सवाल पूछे जाने पर देता है। फतवा कुरान, हदीस और इस्लामी किताबो की रौशनी में दिया जाता है। कोई मौलाना, आलिम या इस्लामी स्कॉलर भी फतवा नही दे सकता। अभी कुछ ही दिनों पहले असम के मुस्लिमो द्वारा एक म्यूजिक कंसर्ट के खिलाफ की गयी अपील को फतवा बता कर मीडिया ने काफी हंगामा खड़ा कर दिया था। India Today ने तो उसे आतंकवाद से भी जोड़ दिया था। बाद में सच्चाई सामने आने के बाद NDTV को छोड़ के किसी भी न्यूज़ चैनल या पत्रकार ने माफ़ी नही मांगी।</p>

<h4>अभी चंद दिनों पहले गायक सोनू निगम ने दावा किया के उनकी नींद अज़ान की वजह से खुल जाती है।  इस पर काफी बवाल हुवा, कुछ पत्रकार उनके घर के बाहर सुबह सवेरे जा पहुंचे। मगर किसी को अज़ान सुनाई नही दी।  अभी ये बवाल चल ही रहा था कि तभी सय्यद आतिफ अली कादरी नाम के आदमी ने सोनू निगम को गंजा करने पर १० लाख का इनाम देने की घोषणा कर दी।</h4>
<p>फिर क्या था, इस खबर को ANI के कैमेरो से सभी चैनल्स की ब्रॉडकास्ट फीड में जाने के लिए ज्यादा समय नही लगा। शाम की डिबेट के लिए मसाला मिल गया। फ़ौरन ही उस आदमी को मौलाना और मुफ़्ती बना दिया गया। और उसके बचकाने बयान को फतवा। सोनू ने भी अपने सर को एक मशहूर हेयर स्टाइलिस्ट के हाथो गंजा करवा दिया। और एक बड़ी से प्रेस कांफ्रेंस कर के अपने १० लाख के इनाम की मांग भी कर डाली।</p>
<p>बस, मीडिया की नजर में सोनू हीरो बन गए। एक अंग्रेजी चैनल, जो खुद अपने डिबेट के द्वारा ध्वनि प्रदुषण करने के लिए बदनाम है #SonuV/S Fanatics ट्रेंड करवाने लगा। तो वही एक और चैनल फतवों की औक़ात दिखाने की बात करने लगा। आतिफ अली कादरी के घर के बाहर मीडिया की ओ बी वेंस का ताँता लग गया। उनके बचकाने बयान को फतवा बताया गया। और करीब २ दिन डिबेट की गयी। सय्यद आतिफ अली ने ये बात खुद कही है के वो न मौलाना है न मुफ़्ती, उनके बयान को फतवा बता कर पेश किया गया।</p>
<h3>जबकि उसी दिन बीजेपी के एक सीनियर लीडर ने कश्मीर को पूरी तरह से उजाड़ कर बचे कुचे कश्मीरियो को तमिलनाडू में कैंप बना कर क़ैद करने की बाद की थी। उस नेता के बयान पर न तो कोई डिबेट हुवी न ही कोई न्यूज़ सेगमेंट दिखाया गया। शायद मीडिया की नज़र में किसी गायक के बाल माँगना एक राज्य की पूरी आबादी को ख़तम करने की मांग से ज्यादा खतरनाक है।</h3>
<p>देश में आज भी बहुत सी समस्याएं हैं। नए रोज़गार बनाने की दर ७ साल के सब से निचले स्तर पर है। नोट बैन के बावजूद भ्रष्टाचार आज भी बढ़ रहा है। मंहगाई आज भी वैसी ही है। धार्मिक असहिष्णुता के मामले में भारत चौथे नंबर पर है। रोज़ जवान अपने प्राणों की आहुति दे रहे हैं। हर हफ्ते नक्सली कहीं ना कहीं हमला करते हैं।</p>
<p>जी हाँ, ये सब समस्याएँ पहले भी होती थी। मगर उस समय सरकार को कटघरे में खड़ा किया जाता था। मीडिया प्रधान मंत्री से सवाल पूछती थी और डिबेट में “नेशन” दोषी कौन है ये “जानना चाहता” था। आज कल मीडिया तलाक़, बुर्का और काल्पनिक फ़त्वो पर डिबेट करता है। किसी भी दाढ़ी टोपी वाले की बात को फतवा बता कर पेश करना मीडिया के लिए अब आम सी बात है।</p>
<p>बल्कि मैं तो कहता हूँ अगर बाबा रामदेव भी टोपी पहन कर कुछ बोल दें तो मीडिया उसे फतवा बना कर उस पर डीबेट करवाएगी। जनता का ध्यान मूल मुद्दों से भटकने के लिए ये सब से उपयोगी तरीका है।</p>

<p>The Hindu population has faced persecution in Pakistan ever since 1947, but it didn’t vanish – it came home.</p>
<p><span id="more-1059"></span></p>
<p><span class="list-group-item-text list_info author_name">By <a href="https://www.newslaundry.com/author/anand-ranganathan" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span class="art_cat">Anand Ranganathan</span><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></span></p>
<p><strong>What has Pakistan done to its Hindu population?</strong></p>
<p>On January 6, 2015, in an <em>NDTV</em> <a href="http://www.ndtv.com/video/player/the-buck-stops-here/asaduddin-owaisi-sparks-outrage-muslim-right-mirrors-hindu-right/351307" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">debate<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, BJP spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi said (19:05): “When Pakistan was created there were 24% Hindus in Pakistan. Now there are less than 1% Hindus.”</p>
<p>Trivedi has got his numbers wrong – it was undivided Pakistan at the time of partition that had 24 per cent Hindus, not the modern-day Pakistan, that has 21,11,271 or 1.6 per cent Hindus; East Pakistan, now Bangladesh, has 9.5 per cent Hindus. Worryingly, he is also wrong on the conclusions he drew from his numbers – <em>“What happened to the rest? Obviously they were converted.”</em> But Mr Trivedi is not the exception.</p>
<p>Professor Saswati Sarkar, an academic based in the United States of America, has recently written two articles relating to Hindu <a href="http://www.dailyo.in/opinion/the-missing-hindus-in-south-asia-and-a-conspiracy-of-silence/story/1/1149.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">persecution<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> in the subcontinent and its <a href="http://swarajyamag.com/politics/discrimination-against-hindus-in-indian-public-discourse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">lack<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> of reportage in the media. Together, they provide a meticulously, detailed analysis of the subject and act as a valuable resource for researchers. Doubtless, Sarkar’s thesis is correct – Hindus have been, and still are, persecuted in many of the sub-continent’s countries.</p>
<div class="row subscribe-block">
<div class="col-lg-9 col-sm-9 col-md-8 col-xs-12"></div>
<div class="col-lg-3 col-sm-3 col-md-4 col-xs-12"></div>
</div>
<p>With regard to Pakistan specifically, Sarkar writes: “When Pakistan was created in 1947, Hindus constituted about 15 per cent of the population of West Pakistan (current Pakistan); by 1998 it is about 1.6 per cent – the population has declined by about 90 per cent in about 50 years. This decimation is the outcome of sustained legal and social discrimination ever since the creation of Pakistan.”</p>
<p>For the above claim, Sarkar has sourced the data from the <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/225515727/Hindus-in-South-Asia-the-Diaspora-A-Survey-of-Human-Rights-2013" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">report<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, <em>Hindus in South Asia &amp; the Diaspora: A Survey of Human Rights, 2013</em>, by the Hindu American Foundation (HAF). On page 74, the HAF report says: “At the time of Partition in 1947, the Hindu community in what is now Pakistan was approximately 15% of the population (the Western half of the country, not including Bangladesh, or the former East Pakistan). By 1998, it was only 1.6%.” For these numbers the HAF, in-turn, cites a <em>Zee News</em> <a href="http://zeenews.india.com/blog/being-a-hinduin-pakistan_493.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" data-wpel-link="external">blog<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> titled, <em>Being a Hindu in Pakistan</em>. The <em>Zee News</em> blog, by Ritesh Srivastava, does not provide a reference for the 15% statistic.</p>
<p>Reading Sarkar’s articles and the HAF report, one may get the impression that – as Sarkar says so herself – the Hindu population of Pakistan has been decimated and that this decimation has happened over a period of 50 years because of – to use Sarkar’s words again – “sustained legal and social discrimination ever since the creation of Pakistan.”</p>
<p>It is this author’s contention that the above conclusion is erroneous and that decimation, one which led to a decrease in the Hindu population of Pakistan by 90 per cent, never took 50 years to materialise. Decimation did happen, but in the months preceding or subsequent to the date of the partition. In other words, the cataclysmic reduction of the Hindu population of Pakistan had taken not 50 years but, rather, half a decade.</p>
<p>To get a better understanding of what happened to the Hindu population of Pakistan, it is important to first consider which window to look at. HAF, Sudhanshu Trivedi, and Prof. Sarkar all use 1947 as the starting point. Table 1 shows why this could be misguided.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Table 1. Pakistan Census data. For 1931 and 1941, the figures are for West Pakistan in undivided India. For 1951 and 1961, the figures are for West Pakistan in undivided Pakistan. Data for 1971 could not be accessed.</p>
<p><em>* The 1998 Hindu population increases to 1.85% if SC population is added to the Hindu (jati) population.</em></p>
<p>From a healthy 14 per cent in 1941 – a figure some analysts say had reached 16 per cent by 1947 – the Hindu population came down to just 1.3 per cent in 1951. The decimation took five years not 50. After 1951, the Hindu population has hovered around the same 1.5-2 per cent mark. It is this tiny population that has been subjected to hardships, conversions, and denial of human rights that Sarkar and others have written about. Most of the 16 per cent Hindus who were present in Pakistan at the time of the partition either escaped to India or, most tragically, succumbed to the genocide that accompanied partition.</p>
<p>In 1951, according to the Indian Census <a href="https://books.google.co.in/books?id=tkHi5j81VHEC&amp;pg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">data<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, refugees from Pakistan constituted as much as 20 per cent of the total population of Indian Punjab. To be sure, a significant decrease in the Hindu population had occurred even before the partition. In 1881, there were 92,52,295 Hindus in Punjab, or 43.8 per cent of the population. By 1911, the Hindu population had come down to 87,73,621, or 36.3 per cent. During the same period, the Muslim population had risen from 1,16,62,434 to 1,22,75,477 and the Christian population from 33,699 to 199,751.</p>
<p>Indeed, this decrease in the Hindu population was what triggered the <em>Shuddhi</em> Movement, or what one calls today as <em>Ghar Wapsi</em>. Between 1909 and 1912, <em>Ghar Wapsi</em> was carried out on lakhs of Muslims and Christians; 100,000 Doms of Gurdaspur, 30,000 Megs of Sialkot, and 1052 Muslim Rajputs were re-converted and <a href="https://books.google.co.in/books?id=XAO3i_gS61wC&amp;pg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">brought back<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> to the Hindu fold.</p>
<p>Nothing, however, comes close to the drop in Hindu population in the aftermath of the partition. One may ask, does the vanishing of such a large human population have any parallel in modern history? The answer is yes, it does. On the Indian side.</p>
<p>The partition of Punjab was devastating to the nation’s psyche, and an unprecedented genocidal event. A million died, many millions were displaced. Exactly how Punjab was to be divided was a closely guarded secret. On August 17, 1947, having celebrated the Independence Day parades of the two baby nations, Mountbatten unlocked his safe and <a href="https://books.google.co.in/books?id=tHmPrSPzu3MC&amp;printsec" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">removed<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> the boundary maps. He must have sensed a great tragedy was about to unfold.</p>
<p>The irascible Churchill had once famously gloated of how, after the Great War, he divided the Middle East with blind swishes of his fountain pen. Now it transpired that Radcliffe had done the same. Of the 29 districts of Punjab, 16 went to Pakistan, 13 to India. Gurdaspur came India’s way and Lahore, the jewel in India’s crown, was now Pakistan’s. Mayhem ensued.</p>
<p>Punjab bore the brunt of the mass exodus. By August 14, 1947, an estimated 2 million Hindus and Sikhs had <a href="https://books.google.co.in/books?id=Kr6S2WONpFYC&amp;pg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">moved<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> already to West Punjab, and an equally large number, 2.1 million Muslims, to East Punjab. Between September 18 and October 29, facing unimaginable hardships, an estimated 8,49,000 Hindus and Sikhs crossed over to India in 24-foot convoys. An equal number of Muslims went the other way – the 1941 Census put the number of Muslims in East Punjab at 5 million. No one, least of all Jinnah and Nehru, expected such mass migration to take place. Indeed, even as late as August 19, Nehru <a href="https://books.google.co.in/books?id=Kr6S2WONpFYC&amp;pg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">said<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>: “We would not like to encourage mass migration of people across the new borders for this will involve tremendous misery.”</p>
<p>The largest migration in human history involved more than misery; it involved a holocaust. Jinnah, once he had got what he wanted, was so shocked to witness first-hand the mayhem that he is supposed to have <a href="http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/a-case-of-mistaken-paternity/article18323.ece" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">said<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, “Oh my God, what have I done?”   By 1950, almost 4.7 million Hindus and Sikhs, and 6.5 million Muslims had <a href="https://books.google.co.in/books?id=U7imPH4KVJUC&amp;pg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">exchanged<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> places. Table 2 shows the Muslim population of Indian Punjab over a period of 70 years.</p>

<p>Table 2. Indian Census data of the Muslim population of Indian Punjab. The 1931 figure is for pre-independence Punjab, while the 1941, 1951, and 1961 figures are for undivided Indian Punjab.</p>
<p>It is clear. What had happened to the Hindus of Pakistan, also happened to the Muslims of Indian Punjab. The Muslim population came down from 32.3 per cent to 0.8 per cent, a drop as drastic if not more, than the Hindu drop one saw earlier. The Muslims of Punjab had vanished. It should be added, however, that this emptying out was an exception. There was hardly any population fluctuation, for example, in Uttar Pradesh during the partition. Table 3 shows the Muslim population of Uttar Pradesh over a period of 100 years:</p>

In 1951, an astonishing 48 per cent of the total urban population <a href="https://books.google.co.in/books?id=U7imPH4KVJUC&amp;pg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">was<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> Mohajir. Just how near-complete the population switch was, becomes clear when one explores the demographic changes of Indian Punjab.</p>
<p>In 1941, there were 6,57,695 Muslims in Amritsar. By 1951, <a href="http://punjabrevenue.nic.in/fdigs.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" data-wpel-link="external">their<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> number had dwindled to 4,585 – from 45.4 per cent of the population <a href="http://paa2004.princeton.edu/papers/41274" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" data-wpel-link="external">to<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> a mere 0.3 per cent. Take, next, the case of Gurdaspur. According to the 1941 Census, there <a href="http://punjabrevenue.nic.in/gaz_gdr5.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" data-wpel-link="external">were<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> 4,40,323 Muslims in Gurdaspur, or 25 per cent of the population of the district. By 1951, Muslim numbers had come down to 10,425. In 1971, the number of Muslims in Gurdaspur was 6,868, or 0.56 per cent of the population. Now if one were to read these decreases as HAF did for the Hindu population of Pakistan, one would phrase it thus: <em>At the time of Partition in 1947, the Muslim community in what is now Gurdaspur was approximately 25 per cent of the population. By 1971 it was only 0.56 per cent.</em></p>
<p>Although factually correct, the above statement is misleading and doesn’t tell the real story, which is that the Muslim population was “decimated” because of an overwhelming outflow around the time of partition itself. A truer picture emerges only when we compare the 1951 population numbers with those that were revealed during subsequent Census counts. This holds as much for the Muslim numbers for Indian Punjab as it does for the Hindu numbers for Pakistan.</p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">In this context, it is also worth pointing out that the </span><span lang="EN-GB">HAF</span><span lang="EN-GB"> report contradicts its claim</span> – albeit in a limited sense – when it says that “In the city of Karachi alone, the Hindu population decreased from 51 per cent in 1947 to only two per cent in 1951, while the Muslim population in the city went from 42% to 96% during that same period.” It further adds: “There are conflicting figures on the number of Hindus residing in Pakistan, and the government has not conducted a census since 1998. While many estimates place the figure at less than 2%, the Pakistan Hindu Council (PHC), one of the leading representative bodies for Hindus in the country, approximates that there are more than 70,00,000 Hindus, or 5.5% of the population.”</p>
<p>On a closer inspection, the PHC <a href="http://www.pakistanhinducouncil.org/site/?page_id=3844" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">does<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> indeed provide a district-by-district analysis of Hindu numbers in Pakistan, but it does not cite the source of this information, which is strange considering it overshoots both, the Census estimate and Mr Trivedi, by more than three-fold.</p>
<p>Irrefutably, thousands of Hindus – those who could not make it to safety or decided to stay back in Pakistan – were converted to Islam during partition, but it couldn’t possibly have been 90 per cent of the Hindu population – the numbers are just too large. Also, the Indian Census data of 1951 – that provides detailed figures for the huge influx of Hindus to Punjab – indicates otherwise. The evidence is clear: Without question the Hindu population has faced persecution in Pakistan ever since 1947, but it didn’t vanish – it came home.</p>
<p>Oddly, what is more troubling than the Pakistan scenario is the one concerning Bangladesh, where one has witnessed a steady decline in the Hindu population. Indeed, one may even term it alarming. Table 4 shows the Hindu population of Bangladesh over the past 80 odd years.</p>
<p><a href="https://e.infogr.am/hindus-in-bangladesh0?src=embed" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">https://e.infogr.am/hindus-in-bangladesh0?src=embed<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>

<p>Table 4. Census data for Hindus in Bangladesh. The 1931, 1941, 1951, and 1961 figures are for East Pakistan.</p>
<p>Coupled with the population decline – from 22 per cent in 1951 to 9.5 per cent now – is the unrelenting persecution of Hindus in Bangladesh, as articulated by Sarkar in her articles and by many others, notably <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/ASA13/006/2001/en/28f655a2-d8b7-11dd-ad8c-f3d4445c118e/asa130062001en.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" data-wpel-link="external">Amnesty International<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, it is also true that, because of the circumstances surrounding the intervening Liberation War of 1971, the East also had to bear the brunt of voluntary and forced mass migration of Hindus. Indeed, such migrations were routine in erstwhile East Pakistan even before the Liberation War. As Vijaya Laxmi Pandit, in her address to the United Nations on September 30<sup>th</sup>, 1963 <a href="https://books.google.co.in/books?id=UP1XHGF7yBcC&amp;printsec" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">said<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>: “The government of Pakistan, ever since its creation, has followed a communal policy based on the pernicious two-nation theory. It is as a result of this policy that 2.25 million Hindus have been forced to flee East Pakistan during the period 1951 to 1961. This policy has a double advantage for Pakistan. In the first place, it helps Pakistan to get rid of its Hindu population from East Pakistan; the Hindus from West Pakistan having been already practically eliminated.”</p>
<p>Clearly, the battle lies elsewhere.</p>

<p>With the escalation of Hindu-Muslim tension in India, Hindutva ideologues have started to brainwash Indian Hindus by trying to instill in them a sort of existential dilemma. They reason that Islamist Jihad in India will result in a situation where no Hindus will be left to live in Bharat. In order to substantiate their claim, they cite the example of Muslim majority Pakistan and Muslim majority Kashmir. When Pakistan came into being in 1947, the Hindu population of the state ran in double digits (percentage wise) but gradually this figure has descended to a percentage or two. Similarly, the ethnic cleansing of Kashmiri Pandits from the Valley has led to over 90% of the Kashmiri Pandits being forced out of their homes. Islamophobic intellectuals in India have stated that these warnings should not be taken lightly by the Hindus as Muslims are on a mission to convert India into Darul Islam. I wonder whether these academicians really understand the meaning of the term Darul Islam (Abode of Peace) which has been used in the Quran to describe heaven and not some Muslim majority country ruled by the Sharia as some Islamophobes would have us to believe.<br />
<span id="more-1061"></span></p>
<p>If there is any person who is worried about the fate of Hindus in Muslim majority countries and intends to know whether the two communities can co-exist in such a situation then that person should look at Indonesia, the country with the highest number of Muslims in the world. According to the 2010 National Census of Indonesia, the island nation’s human force stands at 237.6 million. Muslims form the majority with 87.5% of the population. Christians happen to be the major minority in the country with 9% stake in the population whereas Hindus and Buddhists form 3% and 2% population share, respectively. Indonesia happens to be a secular state and the guiding force behind the idea of Indonesia is the Pancasila. The Constitution of Indonesia was formulated by such secular fundamentalists that in August 1945 they unanimously ratified and agreed upon the usage of the term “Tuhan” instead of “Allah” in the Indonesian Constitution. This was done particularly to strengthen the confidence of minorities like Hindus who preferred using the term “Tuhan” and could connect with it. On the same day ie 18<sup>th</sup> August, 1945 the constitution makers modified the first principle of the Pancasila from “Belief in Almighty Good with the obligation for its Muslim adherents to carry out the Islamic Law” to “Belief in Almighty Good”. This made the Indonesian Constitution all the more secular.</p>

<p class="wp-caption-text">Garuda Pancasila is the National Emblem of Indonesia. It has been inspired by the Hindu mythological bird, Garuda.</p>
</div>
<p>The official motto of Indonesia is “”Bhinneka Tunggal Ika” which can be translated as “Unity in Diversity”. The term unity and diversity is said to have been originally coined by Bahai Ullah, the founder of Bahai Faith. The national emblem of Indonesia is called Garuda Pancasila. In Hindu mythology, Garuda is a bird of great significance as it is the vehicle of Lord Vishnu. One of the most important Hindu scriptures called Garuda Purana describes the conversation between Lord Vishnu and Garuda regarding afterlife. Garuda Purana is also recited in Hindu households after someone passes away. Indonesia’s national airline has also been influenced by this bird of Hindu mythology and is called Garuda Indonesia. Lord Ram’s beloved “Hanuman” who appears in the Ramayana is the official mascot of Indonesia’s military intelligence. The National flag of Indonesia called the “Sang Saka Merah-Putin” (meaning “The Sacred Red and White”) has been influenced by the banner of Majapahit empire which was at the time of 13<sup>th</sup> century one of the largest empires of the region. Hinduism and Buddhism were the dominant religions in the Majapahit Empire.</p>

<p>Senior BJP leader and Former Deputy Prime Minister of India, Lal Krishna Advani visited Indonesia in July 2010 to attend the World Sindhi Conference in Jakarta. It is noteworthy to mention that Advani used to be the poster boy of Hindutva in India as it was him who headlined the Ram Janmabhoomi movement and ensured the rise of Hindu nationalism in the country. During his trip, Advani was left awestruck because of the pride bestowed upon Hinduism by Muslim majority Indonesia. On his return to India, he wrote a blog titled “Hindu influence in Indonesia” on 17<sup>th</sup> July, 2010. He concluded that write up with the following words, “Indonesia, I must say, seemed to know and cherish Ramayana and Mahabharata better than we (Indians) do.” Advani mentioned in his blog about the Ganesh inscription on a high denomination currency note of Indonesia ie 20,000 rupiah.</p>

<p class="wp-caption-text">The official logo of the island of Bali in Indonesia represents the Three Gods of the Universe ie Brahma, Vishnu and Shiv.</p>
</div>
<p>During his stay in Bali, Advani encountered the newly adopted logo of the island of Bali which in Advani’s words was a “manifestation of country’s Hindu traditions.” A publication of the Indonesian Ministry of Tourism described the logo as follows, “The triangle (shape of logo) is a symbol of stability and balance. It is formed out of three straight lines in which both ends meet, taking the symbols of a blazing fire (Brahma – The Creator), lingga or phallus. The triangle also represents the three Gods of the Universe (Trimurti – Brahma, Wisnu and Siwa), three stages of nature (Bhur, Bwah, Swah and Loka), and three stages of life (Born, Live and Die). The tagline ‘Shanti, Shanit, Shanti’ represents peace be upon Bhuwana alit dan agung (yourself and the world) which will deliver a sacred and holy vibe that awakens a deep aura that balance and make peace to all living creatures.” During his short trip to Indonesia of 4 days (2 days in Bali and 2 in Jakarta), Advani also saw the Krishna-Arjuna Statue at Jakarta main square. While Advani was in Denpasar, capital of Bali, he saw another statue which even he was unable to decipher. When he inquired about the statue from the driver of his car, the driver replied, “This is a depiction of the Ghatotkach from Mahabharata.”</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter">
<p><a href="https://saifahmadkhan.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/indonesia-statue-of-ghatotkach.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" id="i-620" class="size-full wp-image" src="http://vedkabhed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/indonesia-statue-of-ghatotkach.jpg" alt="Image" width="273" height="289" /></a></p>
<p class="wp-caption-text">Statue of Ghatotkach in Indonesia.</p>
</div>
<p>The driver’s answer won Advani’s heart. Advani wrote, “Indeed, even in India very few would be able to identify who Ghatotkach is. And here was the driver of our car knowing full well both Ghatotkach as well as his relationship with Bheema.” Indonesia’s pluralism and its respect for the various religious traditions being practised in the country is a matter of great pride for the entire world. The world’s largest Muslim majority country stands as a testimony for those who believe that societies which are dominated by Islam do not even exhibit the slightest form of tolerance. Advani’s respect for Indonesia stems from Indonesia’s respect for Hinduism. We hope and pray to God that Indonesia continues to prosper and remains a citadel of peace and tolerance across the globe. Advani stated in his blog, “In Indonesia, the names of places, of people, and the nomenclature of institutions also give one a clear impression of a benign Sanskrit influence.” We hope that this vibrancy of Indonesian culture never ceases and continues its existence till eternity.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>History of the madrasas in India goes back to the advent of Muslims to the subcontinent<strong>.</strong> They played an important role in the eco-cultural life of the Muslim society. In the medieval India, they used to provide with the manpower to the government to run its huge and vast machinery. A chain of these madrasas were spread in the length and breadth of the country. They were instrumental in imparting education to the masses. They were marked with the secularism in their nature. This, including with other characteristics of the madrasas, attracted a good crowd of the children even from the non-Muslim majority. This situation continued up till late 19<sup>th</sup> century. The luminaries like Raja Ram Mohan Roy, Dr.Rajendra Prasad and Dr.Sachdanand Sinha and thousands of others got their elementary education in madrsas.</p>
<p><span id="more-896"></span></p>
<p>The situation started changing towards the 19<sup>th</sup> century when some critical problems engulfed the Muslims of the sub-continent. On the one hand, hegemony of the Muslim dynasty which had been ruling the country for centuries, came to an end and, on the other hand, the Englishmen, conquering the land, had begun to consolidate their empire. Muslims were in a dilemma, not been able to decide what to do. As the Englishmen put an end to the traditional education system, they divided the education into two categories: religious and non-religious. This made the ulama worried about the preservation of the religious as well as cultural identities. The ulama responded to the situation in two ways: firstly, they tried to tackle this impasse through violent means in uprising of 1857 but it resulted in disastrous consequences; secondly, sensing the change in the need and nature of the time, they did their best to open a series of madrasas at a number of places first in UP and then all across the country. Thus, a network of them got established in the country.</p>
<p>Maulana Wahiduddin Khan, a noted Muslim scholar, terms this spurt in the opening of madrasas at this juncture of history as the <em>“Movement of Dini Madaris” </em>[<em> D</em>een-o-Shari’at: Deen-e-Islam ka ek Fiki Motala, Goodwords, New Delhi, 2002]<em> . </em>According to him; the ideas regarding this movement must have been germinated around 1834 when Lord Thomas Babington Macaulay came to India as Viceroy of the British India Company. To him goes the credit to introduce the prototype of what is today known as the English/Secular Education System. The purpose of introducing this system, in Macaulay’s own words, was: “So that a generation may arise, which is Indian in birth and English in thought.” In other words, it aimed at consolidating the British Empire in India. Contrary to that, the ulama made an effort to establish an <em>apolitical empire</em> through setting up a network of madrasas in the country. The ulama were vehemently opposed to the Macaulay syndrome. This opposition on their part springs from the perception that it would act as an axe on the roots of the cultural and religious heritage of the country. This helped in cultivating their image as anti-colonialist and also made them out of the synch with the march of the time. Consequently they grew more radical in their anti-colonial views.</p>
<p>This network of madrasas was meant to function as the <em>supply house</em> which could cater to the religious needs of the Muslim community. So; they started imparting <em>God-oriented education,</em> instead of job-oriented education because they were not the factories to manufacture <em>earning animals</em>. Some of salient features of the madrasas which were established under the influence of this Movement of Dini Madaris are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>They are funded by the public donations.</li>
<li>They provide free education to all students.</li>
<li>They were/are not an urban-centric phenomenon. They were/are opened in every possible village, bringing education at the doorstep of every house, resulting in the elimination of the intellectual gap between the masses and the elites.</li>
</ol>
<p>Despite the fact that these madrasas grew by geometrical proportion, thanks to the missionary spirit of the ulama which was the driving force behind the whole project, their graduates didn’t perform that well in the non-religious sphere of life as was expected. This is evident from the fact that in the first half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, the sub-continent witnessed two important movements: the freedom struggle and the Pakistan movement. The ulama took part in both of them but they played second fiddle to the English-educated persons. The situation didn’t change after the Partition. When the All India Muslim Majlis-e-Moshawarat, the biggest movement of the Indian Muslims after the Independence, was launched, the ulama participated in it in a large number but they have gradually been marginalized and, thus, become ineffective. This can be seen as the consequences of the introduction of new education system by Macaulay in the country. It has created not only the dichotomy of religious and secular education but also raised the status of English to the language of the ruling elite and the educated ones. In this changed scenario, the madrasa graduates found themselves at the periphery of the day-to-day life though they have been playing important roles in every walk of life throughout the history.</p>

<h2>States that are more developed, have a higher per-capita income and better access to healthcare have a lower total fertility rate</h2>
<p><span id="more-892"></span></p>
<div class="article-body">
<p>Fertility rates in India are more closely related to education levels and the socio-economic development within a state, than to religious beliefs, according to an <em>IndiaSpend </em>analysis of government data and research evidence.</p>
<p>The evidence <em>IndiaSpend </em>looked at shows that richer families and states with better health facilities and higher female literacy have lower fertility rates in India. Globally, there is little evidence to link religion and fertility rates, with poorer, conflict-ridden states and countries with lower female empowerment reporting higher population growth rates.</p>
<p>When the office of the <a class="link-external wpel-icon-right" href="http://censusindia.gov.in/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external">Registrar General and Census Commissioner of India<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> released fertility rates for the Indian population last year, the conversation was hijacked by the difference in population growth rates across religions. Several newspapers emphasised that the data showed that <a class="link-external wpel-icon-right" href="http://www.dailypioneer.com/nation/fertility-rate-indian-muslim-women-beat-others.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external">Muslim women had higher fertility<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> rates than non-Muslims, and that the <a class="link-external wpel-icon-right" href="http://www.financialexpress.com/india-news/narendra-modi-reveals-religious-census-muslim-population-rises-24/33530/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external">percentage of Muslims in the population was steadily growing<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>.</p>
<p>The numbers <a class="link-external broken_link wpel-icon-right" href="http://pib.nic.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=126326" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external">showed<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> that the proportion of Muslims in India had grown to 14.2% of the total population in 2011, up from 13.4% in 2001, while the proportion of Hindus had reduced to 79.8% from 80.5%. The percentage of Christians and Jains did not significantly change at 2.3% and 0.4%, respectively, while the proportion of Buddhists decreased from 0.8% to 0.7%, and that of Sikhs reduced from 1.9% to 1.7%.</p>
<p>This implicit suggestion that Muslims have more children than other religious communities, missed data that shows how population growth rates and the total fertility rate – or the average number of children a woman has over her childbearing years – vary widely between India’s states. The total fertility rate seems more closely related to per-capita income, healthcare and other basic facilities in that state.</p>
<h3 class="cms-block cms-block-heading">Development and fertility</h3>
<p>Compare, for instance, Kerala and Uttar Pradesh. In 2011, the total fertility rate of Uttar Pradesh, at 3.3, was higher than the Indian average of 2.4, and higher than the rate in Kerala, at 1.8, according to census data.</p>
<p>The Muslim population in Uttar Pradesh increased 25.19%, while the Muslim population in Kerala increased 12.83% between 2001 and 2011. Over the same period, the Hindu population increased 18.9% in Uttar Pradesh and 2.8% in Kerala.</p>
<p>The higher growth rates of Muslims in northern states are “more or less part of a northern culture than a Muslim culture”, NC Saxena, the former secretary of the Planning Commission of India, said in an <a class="link-external wpel-icon-right" href="http://thewire.in/9351/the-perils-of-reading-the-census-as-a-sensex-of-religion/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external">interview<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> to <em>The Wire</em>, a nonprofit journalism portal.</p>
<p>This is in sync with higher average total fertility rates in northern and central states, such as Uttar Pradesh (3.3), Bihar (3.5), Chhattisgarh (2.7), and Madhya Pradesh (2.9), as compared to southern states like Andhra Pradesh (1.8), Karnataka (1.9), Kerala (1.8), and Tamil Nadu (1.7), according to 2011 census data.</p>
<p>The states with the highest fertility rates in India are all in north and central India – Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan (which has a total fertility rate of 2.9), Jharkhand (2.8), and Chhattisgarh.</p>
<p>These overall fertility rates seem more related to the state’s development. For instance, Kerala has a <a class="link-external wpel-icon-right" href="http://censusindia.gov.in/2011-prov-results/data_files/india/Final_PPT_2011_chapter6.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external">literacy rate<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> of 93.9%, compared to 69.7% in Uttar Pradesh in 2011. In the same year, 99.7% of mothers in Kerala received medical attention at delivery compared to 48.4% of mothers in Uttar Pradesh. 74.9% of women were above the age of 21 in Kerala at marriage, compared to only 47.6% in Uttar Pradesh.</p>
<p>Another way to interpret population growth rates is through the difference in poor and rich states. Empowered Action Group states, which include the poorest in India – Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Bihar, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, and Chhattisgarh – <a class="link-external wpel-icon-right" href="http://censusindia.gov.in/2011-prov-results/data_files/india/Final_PPT_2011_chapter3.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external">have higher population growth<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. Between 2001 and 2011, the population of Empowered Action Group states grew at a rate of 21%, compared to 15% for the rest of India. Still, decadal population growth rates even in these states has fallen when compared to the decadal growth rate of 24.99% between 1991 and 2001.</p>
<figure class="cms-block cms-block-image "><img decoding="async" src="http://vedkabhed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/jyzjcadpci-1470815273.png" /></figure>
<h3 class="cms-block cms-block-heading">Differences within states</h3>
<p>Still, there are differences within states in total fertility rates between religious groups. In 2005-2006, according to data from the <a class="link-external wpel-icon-right" href="http://rchiips.org/NFHS/nfhs3.shtml" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external">third National Family Health Survey<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, Uttar Pradesh had a total fertility rate of 3.3, higher than the all-India average of 2.4.</p>
<p><a class="link-external wpel-icon-right" href="http://rchiips.org/nfhs/NFHS-3%20Data/ke_state_report_for_website.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external">Kerala<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> had a total fertility rate of 1.93. In 2005-2006, Muslims in Kerala had a total fertility rate of 2.46, higher than that of Hindus in Kerala, at 1.53. But the Muslim total fertility rate in Kerala was lower than that of Hindus in Uttar Pradesh, at 3.73. The total fertility rate of Muslims in UP was 4.33.</p>
<p>One reason for the higher Muslim fertility within a state could be wealth-related factors.</p>
<p>Survey information showed that families in the lower wealth quintiles have more children than richer families. For instance, in Bihar, women in the lowest wealth quintile have a total fertility rate of 5.08, while women in the highest quintile have a total fertility rate of 2.12. The same holds true for a richer state, like Maharashtra, where the lowest wealth quintile has a total fertility rate of 2.78, compared to the richest wealth quintile with a total fertility rate of 1.74.</p>
<p>On average, Muslims across India are poorer than Hindus across India, with an average monthly household per capita expenditure of Rs 833, compared to Rs 888 for Hindus, Rs 1,296 for Christians and Rs 1,498 for Sikhs, according to a 2013 <a class="link-external broken_link wpel-icon-right" href="http://mospi.nic.in/mospi_new/upload/nss_report_552.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external">National Sample Survey report<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, based on data from 2009-2010.</p>
<p>Researcher Sriya Iyer, a professor at the University of Cambridge, said that religion does not have a statistically significant effect on fertility if other factors such as “access to education (quantity and quality), income, whether couples have help with childcare or not, local health care provision (quantity and quality) that lowers infant mortality and hence increases child survival, and the degree of urbanisation of the community” are taken into account.</p>
<p>Further, her <a class="link-external broken_link wpel-icon-right" href="http://dev.wcfia.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/845__Iyer.UReligion.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external">2002 study<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> in a Karnataka taluka (an administrative sub-division of a district) found that both Hindus and Muslims had more children than Christians, but she argued that religion affects fertility and contraception through other socio-economic factors, such as a family’s decision to educate its children, rather than through the ideological tenets of a religion.</p>
<p>Socio-economic factors affect the fertility of religious groups in different ways. For instance, higher education for women, and secondary education for men, lowers the fertility of Muslims but not of Hindus or Christians, the study reported, suggesting that family planning programs might have to be designed keeping in mind these differences.</p>
<p>Further, Iyer said, evidence from India showed that, over the long term, “total fertility rate between religious groups are projected to converge, as women from all religious communities are having fewer children today than their mothers or grandmothers”.</p>
<figure class="cms-block cms-block-image "><img decoding="async" src="http://vedkabhed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/twnmvnjsyx-1470815305.png" /></figure>
<h3 class="cms-block cms-block-heading">Religion and fertility</h3>
<p>There is little evidence internationally of the correlation between religion and fertility rates.</p>
<p>For instance, according to World Bank <a class="link-external wpel-icon-right" href="http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.TFRT.IN" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external">data<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, in 2014, Bangladesh, India’s Muslim-majority neighbor, had a total fertlity rate of 2.2. Iran, another Muslim country, has a total fertility rate of 1.7, below replacement level, which means the current population cannot be replaced at the prevailing population growth rate.</p>
<p>Similarly, Malaysia and Indonesia, both Muslim-majority countries, have fertility rates of 1.9 and 2.5, respectively. Other Muslim-majority countries, such as Saudi Arabia (2.8), and Egypt (3.3), have higher fertility rates. The Hindu and the Muslim populations in Pakistan <a class="link-external broken_link wpel-icon-right" href="http://www.globalreligiousfutures.org/countries/pakistan/religious_demography#/?affiliations_religion_id=0&amp;affiliations_year=2010" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external">have<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> the same total fertility rate – 3.2 – according to data from the Pew Research Center.</p>
<p>Another neighboring country, Sri Lanka, with a Buddhist majority, had a total fertility rate of 2.1 in 2014. Its Buddhist population had a total fertility rate of 2.2 between 2010 and 2015, while both Hindus and Muslims had a higher total fertility rate, at 2.3 and 2.8, respectively.</p>
<figure class="cms-block cms-block-image "><img decoding="async" src="http://vedkabhed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zkropblftk-1470816677.jpg" /></figure>
<h3 class="cms-block cms-block-heading">Socio-economic factors</h3>
<p>Fertility rates also depend on a number of factors unrelated to religious group. For instance, socio-economic factors, education, modernisation, access to contraceptives, and state policies for development, all affect fertility, according to P Arokiasamy, the head of the department of development studies, at Mumbai-based International Institute for Population Sciences.</p>
<p>In addition, population growth rates also depend on other factors such as work opportunities for women, access to contraception, age at marriage, and decision-making power within the household. For instance, a <a class="link-external wpel-icon-right" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24955875" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external">meta-analysis of studies<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, published in 2014, found a positive correlation between women’s empowerment and lower fertility, longer birth intervals, and lower rates of unintended pregnancy.</p>
<h3 class="cms-block cms-block-heading">Population growth</h3>
<p><a class="link-external wpel-icon-right" href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/04/21/by-2050-india-to-have-worlds-largest-populations-of-hindus-and-muslims/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external">Population projections<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> by the Pew Research Center, a US-based think tank, estimates that by the year 2050, Muslims will make up 18.4% of India’s population, the largest population of Muslims in any county in the world. But India’s Hindu population will still be larger than the total Muslim population of India, Pakistan, Indonesia, Nigeria, and Bangladesh, five countries with the largest Muslim population in the world.</p>
<p>Overall, population growth is slowing down in India and the decadal growth rate fell from 21.54% between 1991 and 2001 to 17.64% between 2001 and 2011, which is in line with global trends that show that population growth rates fall as a country becomes more developed and literate.</p>
<p>In India, the Muslim growth rate is falling faster than the growth rate of Hindus.</p>
<p>The decadal population growth rate of Muslims fell 4.9 percentage points from 29.5% in 2001 to 24.6% in 2011, while that of Hindus fell 3.5 percentage points, from 20.3% to 16.8%. In 2001, 65.1% of all Hindus, above the age of 7 years, were literate, while 59.1% of Muslims were literate, according to census data. In 2011, the percentage of literate Hindus rose to 73.3%, while that of Muslims increased to 68.5%.</p>
<p>Fertility rates of populations that have higher fertility, such as low-income families and Muslims, are falling faster than other groups, as methods of contraception and education spread to these groups, explained Arokiasamy of International Institute for Population Sciences.</p>

<a name="five-charts"></a>Five charts that puncture the bogey of Muslim population growth</h3>
<p>From Muslims overtaking Hindus to Bangladeshi immigration, much of the right wing’s rhetoric on demographics is belied by data.</p>
<p>A <a href="http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/pew-study-india-muslim-population/article7064237.ece" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">report<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> released last week by the Pew Research Center predicting that India will overtake Indonesia as the country with the largest Muslim population has set off the usual suspects. In response, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad on Saturday <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/VHP-demands-uniform-law-to-rectify-demographic-imbalance/articleshow/46806704.cms" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">asked<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> Hindus to have more children to rectify this &#8220;demographic imbalance&#8221; and predicted that soon Muslims will overtake the number of Hindus in India.</p>
<p>This is nothing new, of course. Malthusian fears of a Muslim takeover of India have been a core part of the Hindutva agenda for almost a century now. After the 2002 Gujarat pogrom, for example, Narendra Modi characterised the violence-affected Muslims in riot camps as “baby-producing factories”. After he formed the government at the Centre, these fears have come to the fore in the form of pronouncements by various Bharatiya Janata Party leaders who want Hindu women to have greater numbers of children in order to boost the community’s numbers. In January, just before the Delhi assembly elections, the 2011 Census’ figures on religion were conveniently <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Census-2011-Assam-records-highest-rise-in-Muslim-population/articleshow/45972566.cms" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">leaked<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> to newspapers.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, these feverish demographic projections generate far more heat than light. As the charts below show, actual data on this issue would hardly support the sort of fears that the Sangh Parivar plays up.</p>
<p><strong>Bogey #1: Muslims will overtake Hindus</strong></p>
<p>This is an extremely popular notion in the Sangh Parivar. Before the Vishwa Hindu Parishad&#8217;s statement on Saturday, this was last bought up in February by the Bharatiya Janata Party’s Sadhvi Prachi, who accused Muslims of giving birth to “40 dogs” each and “trying to convert Hindustan into Darul Islam”. Drumming up of fears of a minority swamping a majority is standard right wing political strategy and it is no different in India.</p>
<p>Indeed, Muslim population growth rates are higher than the corresponding figure for the Hindu community. If one were to accepted that the leaked figures from the 2011 Census are accurate, Hindus grew at an average annual rate of 1.4% between 2001 and 2011. For Muslims, the corresponding figure was 2.2%.</p>
<p>If we assume both communities continue to grow at this rate, Muslims will catch up with Hindus by 2220 ‒ in around 200 years.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="http://vedkabhed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1423407700-1203_chart-1.png" /><br />
<strong>Data: Census of India, 2001 and 2011.</strong><br />
Accepting these growth rates,  at the time Muslims outnumber Hindus, India’s population will be 3,264 crore. Now you know that is a lot of people but let’s see just how much.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="http://vedkabhed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1423407754-618_chart-2.png" /><br />
<strong>Data: Census of India, 2001 and 2011.</strong><br />
At these rates, for Muslims to overtake Hindus, India’s population would need to be almost five times the current global population.  In other words, this is clearly an <em>impossible</em> scenario.</p>
<p>More logically, at some point in the future, Muslim growth rates will slow down and the population will stabilise. This, in fact, is already happening. While from 1991 to 2001, the Indian Muslim population grew by 29.3%, in the period 2001-2011, it grew by 24.4% – a fall, therefore, of almost 5 percentage points.</p>
<p>The Sachar Committee Report, taking this falling growth rate into account, has estimated that the Muslim proportion will stabilise at between 17% and 21% of the Indian population by 2100. A far cry from some of the doomsday scenarios being painted.</p>
<p><strong>Bogey #2: The Muslim growth rate is abnormal</strong></p>
<p>The extremely poor economic conditions of Muslims in India are cited by many liberals and left wingers as the prime reason for their high population growth rate. However, the Hindutva explanation for this growth, expectedly, blames religious factors and dismisses the economic drivers. To quote Hindutva Indologist, Koenraad Elst: “Muslims will have a markedly higher birth rate than their Hindu counterparts, even to the extent of having a higher birth rate than Hindus in a lower educational or income bracket.”</p>
<p>The data tells a different story.</p>
<p>As this chart below shows, depending on how you segment the data, a number of other disadvantaged population groups have growth rates similar to the Muslim growth rate.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="http://vedkabhed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1423407809-738_chart-3.png" /><br />
<strong>Data: Census of India, 2011.</strong><br />
Moreover, since Muslim infant mortality is lower than other population segments, this effect can even be seen in the Total Fertility Rate (or number of births per woman).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="http://vedkabhed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1423407841-1213_chart-4.png" /><br />
<strong>Data: National Family Health Survey.</strong><br />
The Muslim Total Fertility Rate is, as expected, higher than that for Hindus and Christian. But when we segment the population socio-economically, we see that Muslims manage to be better off than people without any education or the poorest fifth of India’s population by wealth.</p>
<p>Clearly then, economic and educational factors seem to the major driver at play here.</p>
<p>We could also disprove the Hindutva groups’ religious argument by looking at the global scene. Iran, for example, achieved replacement level fertility (with each new generation being less populous than the one before) in 2002, a goal India will only reach in 2020. With a population that is more than 90% Muslim, Bangladesh has a TFR not only <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.TFRT.IN" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">lower<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> than India’s overall but also lower than India’s Hindus.</p>
<p><strong>Bogey #3: Bangladeshi Immigration</strong></p>
<p>Accusations of large-scale Bangladeshi immigration are a hot-button issue for the right wing now, another supposed driver of the alleged Muslim population boom, along with polygamy (which in itself is <a href="http://scroll.in/article/669083/Muslim-women-and-the-surprising-facts-about-polygamy-in-India" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">untrue<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>). So critical, in fact, that Modi <a href="http://www.ndtv.com/elections-news/assam-government-killing-rhinos-to-make-way-for-bangladeshi-immigrants-narendra-modi-555757" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">thought<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> that the Assam government was culling rhinos in order to make way for immigrants.</p>
<p>If, as alleged, such large-scale immigration was taking place from Bangladesh to Assam and West Bengal, the Muslim population in those two states would tend to show abnormal growth. But the data shows nothing of that sort.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="http://vedkabhed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1423407915-1162_chart-5.png" /><br />
<strong>Data: Census of India, 2001.</strong><br />
Assam’s Muslim population, for example, grew at the same rate as India’s Muslim population between 1991 and 2001 and West Bengal’s Muslim population, in fact, grew slower. The abnormal growth rate that Assam’s and West Bengal’s Muslim populations should show, given the alleged massive Bangladeshi immigration, simply has not happened.</p>
<p>In the rough and tumble of India’s politics, religious rhetoric often goes a long way electorally. It is therefore not surprising that, in spite of the mountains of contrary data, the Sangh Parivar&#8217;s demographic scaremongering has managed to achieve a significant amount of traction</p>

<h3>
<a name="growth-rates"></a>Census data by religion: Growth rates of all religious communities in India are falling</h3>
<p>At this rate, Muslims will take 270 years to outnumber Hindus.</p>
<p>by Dilip D&#8217;Souza</p>
<p>A few years ago, someone sent me an article he had just written. By way of introduction, he called himself an “accomplished nuclear physicist”, and also an “expert on Islamic fundamentalism”. This was appropriate, because the article purported to be an analysis of the threat that Islamic fundamentalism posed to India. It was, instead a  comical mishmash of paranoia, lies and twisted statistics that any self-respecting editor should have torn up pronto.</p>
<p>But one sentence in this feverish screed, in particular, has stuck. The Muslim population in India, said the expert, had increased so fast and to such an extent that “non-Muslims now rarely venture into areas of India where Muslims are in large numbers, fearing unpredictable, irrational behaviour or violence directed at them”.<br />
This is what qualifies, in some quarters, as analysis.</p>
<p>The nuclear physicist likely thinks he has new ammunition for his wayward gun: The Census Commissioner has just released <a href="http://pib.nic.in/newsite/erelease.aspx?relid=126326" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" data-wpel-link="external">population data by religion<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> from the 2011 Census of India.</p>
<p>What will draw his attention ‒ and that of any number of other fear-mongers across this country ‒ are the growth figures for the different religious communities in the decade ending in 2011. In those ten years, the Hindu population increased by 16.8%, Muslim by 24.6%, Christian 15.5%, Sikh by 8.4%, Buddhist 6.1% and Jain 5.4%. This means that 79.8% of Indians are Hindu ‒ apparently the first time that fraction has dipped below 80% ‒  and 14.2% are Muslim, with the other faiths making up tiny slices of the population pie.</p>
<p>Fear-mongers will point fearfully at the Muslim figures and scream in panic:</p>
<p>Of course, this is what fear-mongers do. For the less fearful among us, here are just four numbers to chew on. Two are a repeat: between 2001 and 2011, Hindu and Muslim numbers increased by 16.8% and 24.6%, respectively. But what about the previous ten years ‒ between 1991 and 2001? In that decade, Hindu and Muslim numbers increased by 19.9% and 29.5%, respectively. (See my previous article on this subject<a href="http://scroll.in/article/694975/with-current-trends-it-will-take-220-years-for-indias-muslim-population-to-equal-hindu-numbers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right"> here.<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>)</p>
<p>Any way you look at those four numbers, two conclusions are inescapable: both growth rates are decreasing, and the Muslim growth rate declined faster than the Hindu growth rate.</p>
<p>In that previous article, I used the 1991-2001 numbers to deduce, via some elementary arithmetic, that at those growth rates, “it will be nearly 220 years before the Muslim population equals the Hindu population”. If we use the 2001-2011 numbers in the same way, we find that for the Muslim population to equal the Hindu population, we will have to wait nearly 270 years. Stack 220 up against 270 to know that, again, the Muslim growth rate is declining faster than the Hindu growth rate. And if population parity itself frightens you, at least consider that the mongers are talking of something that might happen in (drumroll, please) … 2285 AD.</p>
<p>And in fact it won’t happen. For if we do maintain these 2001-2011 growth rates ‒ again repeating calculations from that previous article ‒ in 2285 AD we’ll have nearly 64 billion Hindus and 64 billion Muslims in this country. Or actually we won’t: we’ll have long crowded ourselves to death by then. That’s the only way we will manage any “EXTINCTION”.<br />
So here’s the only sensible deduction to make from the Census figures: population growth rates will slow across the board, leading eventually to a stable population and then to a decline in numbers.</p>
<p>Even the accomplished nuclear physicist should be able to understand that. Except, he prefers fear-mongering.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="muslims-shrinking"></a>Minority report: Muslim families shrinking fastest among Indian communities</h3>
<p>Indian families are getting smaller and the decline is sharpest among Muslims, religious census data released on Friday said, in what could be signs of rising literacy levels in the community.</p>
<p>The report of the census carried out in 2011 was released almost a year after the government revealed religion-wise population figures from the same year.</p>
<p>The latest data said the country’s average family size in 2011 was 4.45 members, down from 4.67 a decade earlier, a drop of 5.3%.</p>
<p>In the Muslim community the average family size fell from 5.61 to 5.15, the report released by the home ministry said. The reduction was sharper &#8212; 11.1% &#8212; for Muslim households headed by men while for families headed by women it was 4.47%.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Muslim community is often targeted by Hindu right-wing groups of having large families and a higher population growth rate. Last year, BJP parliamentarian Sakshi Maharaj and Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) Sadhvi Prachi had separately asked Hindu women to bear at least four children to counter the growth in Muslim population.</p>
<div id="inarticle_wrapper_div"></div>
<p>Religious population data released last year showed that the community grew by 24.6 percent between 2001 and 2011. At 17.22 crore, the community formed 14.2% of India’s 121 crore population. With a population of 96.63 crore, Hindus constitute 79.8% of the population.</p>
<p>Data released on Friday also showed the average size of Hindu families declined by 5.02% over the decade, Christian households by 6.47%, Sikh by 7.44%, Buddhist by 5.96% and Jain by 5.5%.</p>
<p>The average household size was higher in male headed households as compared to those headed by females across all religious communities.</p>
<p>Overall, “Christians had the highest percentage of households headed by females (17.4%) followed next by Buddhist (15.9%). The lowest percentage of female headed households is in Jain community (11.5%),” the report said.</p>
<p>The data showed that the difference in household size between different religious communities wasn’t as big as was often made out. Besides, the continuing decline has also narrowed the gap in family size between different religious communities.</p>
<p>In 2011, the average size of a Hindu family was 4.35. In contrast, a Muslim household had 5.15 members, a Christian household 4.05, Sikh household 4.85, Buddhist household 4.1 and a Jain household 4.45 members.</p>
<p>In 2011, an average Muslim family just had 0.8 more persons than a Hindu household as compared to 1.03 persons in 2001.</p>

<p>Muslims are often criticized for not condemning terrorist attack perpetrated by &#8216;Fellow&#8217; Muslims. Islamophobes gives this statement even when thousands of Muslim scholars and millions of Muslims condemn terrorism. Interestingly, more number of Muslim scholars have condemned terrorism so far than the total strength of ISIS terrorists. But this doesn&#8217;t seem to convince Islamophobes that Muslims or Islam has nothing to do with terrorism because Islamophobes are bent on declaring every single Muslim to be a terrorist. Ironically even if a single terrorist says something against non Muslim then Islamophobes takes it as strong evidence of Islam&#8217;s intolerance towards non Muslims but they keep mum or ignore when hundreds and thousands of Muslim scholars condemn the wrong doings. ISIS has destroyed mosques belonging to both Shia and Sunni, killed Muslim scholars, vowed to destroy Muslim&#8217;s most holy site Kaba, kills more Muslims than non Muslims and yet Islamophobes calls them &#8216;Islamic&#8217;, Islam prohibits shedding blood of a Non Muslim leave aside killing Muslims. If a Muslim doesn&#8217;t condemn the terrorist attack then he is termed Terrorist or terrorist sympathizer and if a Muslim condemns the terrorist attack then Islamophobes calls him a liar &#8216;who is lying to further his religion&#8217;.</p>

<h1 class="headline__title">The Big Lie About Muslim Silence on Terrorism</h1>
<p>by Kamran Pasha</p>
<div class="content-list-component mt-paragraph text">
<p>Today I had to refute yet again the Big Lie that hounds the Muslim community — that we fail to speak out and condemn terrorism.</p>
</div>
<div class="content-list-component mt-paragraph text">
<p>I was being interviewed by the wonderful radio host Dr. Alvin Augustus Jones about my new novel <em>Mother of the Believers</em>. Dr. Jones is a deeply spiritual man whose show always features uplifting themes and speakers. And he went out of his way to make me feel welcome.</p>
</div>
<div class="content-list-component mt-paragraph text">
<p>But as a good journalist, he had to ask the question he felt his audience wanted answered — “Why do mainstream Muslims fail to speak out against terrorism?</p>
</div>
<div class="content-list-component mt-paragraph text">
<p>It is a question that I get almost every single day, and it leaves me flabbergasted. I often respond to that question with one of my own — “Why does the media fail to report on Muslims who condemn terrorism?”</p>
</div>
<div class="content-list-component mt-paragraph text">
<p>Since before 2001, every single major Muslim group in the United States has been outspoken in their condemnation of terrorism and the murder of innocent people in the name of Islam. And yet the media ignores it. Every single time.</p>
</div>
<div class="content-list-component mt-paragraph text">
<p>Don’t believe me?</p>
</div>
<div class="content-list-component mt-paragraph text">
<p>Go <a href="http://www.muhajabah.com/otherscondemn.php" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">here<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
</div>
<div class="content-list-component mt-paragraph text">
<p>That site lists links to dozens of major Muslims group and Islamic scholars who have condemned terrorism as a violation of the fundamental moral precepts of Islam.</p>
</div>
<div class="content-list-component mt-paragraph text">
<p>Want more?</p>
</div>
<div class="content-list-component mt-paragraph text">
<p>Here’s a compilation of Islamic fatwas against terrorism by <a href="http://www.juancole.com/2005/07/friedman-wrong-about-muslims-again-and.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Juan Cole<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a><br />
, scholar of the Middle East and author of <em>Engaging the Muslim World</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="content-list-component mt-paragraph text">
<p>Cole’s list was compiled after Thomas Friedman wrote an <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/08/opinion/08friedman.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">outrageous column<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> in <em>The New York Times</em> claiming that “no major Muslim cleric or religious body has ever issued a fatwa condemning Osama Bin Laden.”</p>
</div>
<div class="content-list-component mt-paragraph text">
<p>Friedman knew (or should have known as an alleged Middle East expert) that what he was saying was a lie. But he chose to publish this garbage anyway, giving it the full credibility of the Times.</p>
</div>
<div class="content-list-component mt-paragraph text">
<p>What was so shocking was that Friedman’s column was published on July 8, 2005. But three months before, on March 11, 2005, a group of Spanish imams issued a fatwa against Osama Bin Laden:</p>

</div>
<div class="content-list-component mt-paragraph text">
<p>So what is going on here?</p>
</div>
<div class="content-list-component mt-paragraph text">
<p>As one of the few Muslims who has worked inside Hollywood for the past 7 years as a writer and producer, I can only explain this shocking lie that has become a national meme as the product of an intentional media agenda.</p>
</div>
<div class="content-list-component mt-paragraph text">
<p>There is a real political agenda inside the media itself to keep Islam as the enemy, and to portray mainstream Muslims as a fifth column inside America. The idea that your Muslim neighbors are silently supporting Bin Laden sells newspapers. It captures the attention of viewers of the nightly news. And it furthers the ambitions of politicians who need a rallying point to get votes.</p>
</div>
<div class="content-list-component mt-paragraph text">
<p>As a Muslim and a patriot I don’t know what more to do except continue telling the truth every time I get the opportunity.</p>
</div>
<div class="content-list-component mt-paragraph text">
<p>But I ask my non-Muslim friends this question. How would you feel if your community was being falsely portrayed as being sympathetic to murderers by the media? How would you feel if every single thing you do to condemn and fight such criminals is intentionally ignored? What would you conclude about the character and motivation of people that continue to spread a lie against millions of your fellow human beings?</p>
</div>
<div class="content-list-component mt-paragraph text">
<p>If you can take a moment to consider, you might get a sense of the true burden your Muslim neighbors carry. The world wants us to be the monsters. When we condemn and fight the monsters, no one notices or cares. It’s like the army telling a soldier who has just survived a hellish firefight that he was never in the war in the first place, and condemning him for his cowardice.</p>
</div>
<div class="content-list-component mt-paragraph text">
<p>It would be a formula for despair for most people. And yet what is remarkable is that Muslim groups continue to patiently work against terrorism in accordance with their faith, even though they receive no credit for their deeds. They are secure that everything is in the hands of God. And, as the Holy Qur’an says, that the light of truth will never be put out by the mouths of liars.</p>
</div>
<div class="content-list-component mt-paragraph text">
<p>Last year, I attended the Pilgrimage to Mecca, a powerful, life-changing event that I chronicled on my personal blog at <a href="http://blog.kamranpasha.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">blog.kamranpasha.com<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
</div>
<div class="content-list-component mt-paragraph text">
<p>One of the most remarkable stories that I heard when I was there was the tale of Abraham, who Muslims believe founded the first settlement at Mecca with his son Ishmael. The Angel Gabriel appeared to him and told Abraham to climb a mountain and call mankind to God.</p>
</div>
<div class="content-list-component mt-paragraph text">
<p>Abraham was incredulous, and responded that there was no one in the barren desert valley except him and his family. Who would hear the call?</p>
</div>
<div class="content-list-component mt-paragraph text">
<p>And Gabriel smiled and said: “Just call mankind to the truth. God will make sure it is heard.”</p>
</div>
<div class="content-list-component mt-paragraph text">
<p>—-</p>
</div>
<div class="content-list-component mt-paragraph text">
<p>ADDENDUM:</p>
</div>
<div class="content-list-component mt-paragraph text">
<p>In response to this article, the new meme is being promulgated: “Muslims condemn terrorism, but it’s all talk! Sure, Muslims say they condemn terrorism, but there’s no action!”</p>
</div>
<div class="content-list-component mt-paragraph text">
<p>Where do I begin to respond to this kind of nonsense? There are 1. 5 billion Muslims living their lives in peace, trying to put food on the table for their families. Over six million of them live here in America as patriotic citizens. They work hard, pay their taxes, and have ZERO contact with the criminal underworld where these terrorists breed.</p>
</div>
<div class="content-list-component mt-paragraph text">
<p>I have never, ever met a terrorist in real life (it is ridiculous that I even have to say this). If I met one, I would turn him in to the authorities, as would every other Muslim I know. Since I don’t have access to this shadowy underworld, I live my life on the surface in broad daylight, working in my community to promote interfaith cooperation, peace and prosperity. It is that grassroots effort that Muslims do to promote good in this world that receives ZERO coverage in the media. I could list every single good thing I and other Muslims have ever done to make the world a better, safer place, but people who hold this attitude don’t care. It will never be enough. If I listed 1 million positive things Muslims are doing in their daily lives today on this planet, they would respond: “Why can’t you name a billion things you’ve done? See, you’re not doing enough!”</p>
</div>
<div class="content-list-component mt-paragraph text">
<p>So I ask those who are outraged at this supposed Muslim inaction: “What have YOU done to defeat racism in this world?” List every single thing you have ever done to fight the Ku Klux Klan. List it here, right now. Times, dates and hyperlinks please. The response would be that I am crazy — average Americans have nothing to do with the KKK, and don’t need to justify their daily actions in support of righteousness to me or anyone else. But that same common sense response is rejected when a Muslim uses it.</p>
</div>
<div class="content-list-component mt-paragraph text">
<p>The terrorists are a few thousand criminals (less than 0.01% of the Muslim population). They act in secret, in a shadowy underworld that is more like the Mafia than a public organization that holds meetings and takes minutes. Asking Muslims to list how they are fighting Al-Qaeda is like asking a pizza store owner what he is doing to destroy the Mafia.</p>
</div>
<div class="content-list-component mt-paragraph text">
<p>Muslims fight these monsters by publicly denouncing them, leading lives as law-abiding citizens, helping their communities, and trying to educate people about the loving and harmonious values of true Islam.</p>
</div>
<div class="content-list-component mt-paragraph text">
<p>It is what I am doing here, every single day.</p>
</div>
<div class="content-list-component mt-paragraph text">
<p>But for some people, it will never be enough,</p>
</div>
<div class="content-list-component mt-paragraph text">
<p>So I respond in the way the Holy Qur’an teaches Muslims when they encounter ignorant people. I say to them: “Peace.”</p>
</div>

<p>It has often been claimed in the media that Muslims are &#8220;silent&#8221; and do not condemn terrorism. This page is intended to refute that claim. Muslims have not been silent. Not even close.

<blockquote class="quote-light"><p>Nearly 70,000 [Muslim] clerics [from around the world] came together and passed a fatwa [i.e. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatwa" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Islamic legal decree<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>] against terrorist organizations, including IS, Taliban and al-Qaida.

<p>Surprised?</p>
<p>As <a href="http://metrocosm.com/support-isis-muslim-world-perceptions-vs-reality/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">documented<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>  by Metrocosm, what Americans <em>assume</em> about Muslim support for ISIS is very different from <em>reality</em>:</p>

<p>According to a Brookings <a href="http://www.brookings.edu/research/reports/2015/01/08-american-opinion-poll-isis-syria-telhami" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">report<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> from last January:</p>

<li><strong>40%</strong> of Americans believe most Muslims oppose ISIS.</li>
<li><strong>14%</strong> think most Muslims support ISIS.</li>
<li>And <strong>44%</strong> (the plurality) of Americans believe Muslim views are evenly balanced on the issue.</li>
</ul>
<p>***</p>
<p>Last month, the International Business Times cited a study from <a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/11/17/in-nations-with-significant-muslim-populations-much-disdain-for-isis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Pew Research Center<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> concluding ISIS is “<em><a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/muslim-dominated-nations-hold-overwhelmingly-negative-views-isis-pew-survey-finds-2189491" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">almost universally hated<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></em>.”</p>

<h3>What the Muslim world actually<em> </em>thinks of ISIS</h3>
<p>Looking only at scientific opinion polls, the results are actually very consistent.</p>
<p>The figures in the map below come from surveys conducted by six different research organizations, covering a combined 20 countries in the Muslim world.</p>
<p><a href="https://theindianmuslim.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/what-muslims-really-think-of-isis.png" class="broken_link" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-876" src="https://theindianmuslim.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/what-muslims-really-think-of-isis.png?w=300" alt="what-muslims-really-think-of-isis" width="300" height="215" /></a></p>
<p><strong>In the Muslim world, support for ISIS is low across the board.</strong></p>
<p><strong>In 15 of the 20 countries shown, support for ISIS is in the single digits. And with the exception of Syria, in no country is it greater than 15%</strong>.</p>

According to newly released data that the Pew Research Center collected in 11 countries with significant Muslim populations, people from Nigeria to Jordan to Indonesia overwhelmingly expressed negative views of ISIS.</p>
<p class="selectionShareable">One exception was Pakistan, where a majority offered no definite opinion of ISIS. The nationally representative surveys were conducted as part of the Pew Research Center’s annual global poll in April and May this year.</p>
<p class="selectionShareable">In no country surveyed did more than 15% of the population show favorable attitudes toward Islamic State. And in those countries with mixed religious and ethnic populations, negative views of ISIS cut across these lines.</p>
<p class="selectionShareable">In Lebanon, a victim of one of the most recent attacks, almost every person surveyed who gave an opinion had an unfavorable view of ISIS, including 99% with a <em>very </em>unfavorable opinion. Distaste toward ISIS was shared by Lebanese Sunni Muslims (98% unfavorable) and 100% of Shia Muslims and Lebanese Christians.</p>
<p class="selectionShareable">Israelis (97%) and Jordanians (94%) were also strongly opposed to ISIS as of spring 2015, including 91% of Israeli Arabs. And 84% in the Palestinian territories had a negative view of ISIS, both in the Gaza Strip (92%) and the West Bank (79%). <span id="more-275205"></span></p>
<p class="selectionShareable">Six-in-ten or more had unfavorable opinions of ISIS in a diverse group of nations, including Indonesia, Turkey, Nigeria, Burkina Faso, Malaysia and Senegal.</p>

An overwhelming number of Nigerian Christians (71%) had an unfavorable view of ISIS, as did 61% of Nigerian Muslims. However, 20% of Nigerian Muslims had a favorable view of ISIS when the poll was conducted in the spring of this year. The group Boko Haram in Nigeria, which has been conducting a terrorist campaign in the country for years, is affiliated with ISIS, though the two are considered separate entities.</p>
<p class="selectionShareable">Only 28% in Pakistan had an unfavorable view of ISIS, and a majority of Pakistanis (62%) had no opinion on the extremist group.</p>
<p class="selectionShareable">While we did not ask people in Western nations about their views of ISIS, half or more of people in 15 mostly Western countries <a href="http://www.pewglobal.org/2015/07/14/climate-change-seen-as-top-global-threat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">said they were very concerned<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> about ISIS as an international threat. In France, the target of multiple coordinated attacks in Paris last week, 71% said <em>before the attacks</em> that they were very concerned about the ISIS threat. Similar shares of the public in other nations also expressed serious concern, including 77% of Spanish, 70% of Germans, 69% of Italians and 68% of Americans. In Lebanon and Jordan, nations that are taking in refugees from the ISIS conflict in Syria and whose people have been victims of mass terrorist incidents, 84% and 62% also said they were very concerned about the group.</p>

<p>&#8220;Former chief justice of Delhi high court Rajinder Sachar, who headed the committee that brought out a report on the condition of Muslim community in India in 2006, pointed out that there had been several cases of Muslim youths being acquitted after years in prison.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8216;Cops need only a Muslim name to fabricate a case&#8217;<br />
says Irshad Ahmed Malik who spent 11 years to prove his innocence, he said<br />
&#8220;They convinced me that I was working for the country. Later, they wanted me to go to Pakistan on a secret mission. They also asked me to work in Muslim-dominated areas and instigate youths to participate in jihad,&#8221; Irshad said. When he refused to follow orders, Irshad was arrested. He fought a legal battle for 11 years to prove his innocence.&#8221;<br />
Rashid Hussain, who was an accused in the Jaipur blast in 2008, said IB had a role in every blast that occurred in the country. &#8220;I was involved in helping blast victims and had interacted with 250 of them in a month after the blast. I was detained illegally for several days. The only evidence against me was the email I sent to Yahya Kammukutty, who was later let off by the court in the Hubballi terror conspiracy,&#8221; he said.<br />
Yahya Kammukutty, Syed Imran (who was acquitted in the Mecca masjid blast case), Nisar (who was let of in the Panayikulam SIMI case), Shahul Hameed (Thiruvananthapuram resident who was accused of propagating communal content through Facebook), Hanif Pakitwala (who was let of in the tiffin box bomb case in Ahmedabad) and Abrar Ahmed (who was forced to become an approver in the Mecca Masjid blast case) narrated their experiences.<br />

<p>Abdul Wahid Shaikh spent 9 years in prison on false terror charges, pens a book about his experiences, to serve as a guide for anyone who gets falsely implicated in a terrorist attack.<br />
“I have been made to suffer all three degrees of torture that the police use to force false confessions out of people,” said Shaikh, speaking to <em>Scroll.in</em> during recess hour at the school where he teaches.<br />
First, he says, the police use verbal abuse, threats and the stripping of clothes as an interrogation technique. “Second degree is when they beat you with belts, force you into hunger or solitary confinement, tie you up and force you to stand for days,” said Shaikh. Third degree involves extreme physical torture including waterboarding, using electric shocks or chemicals on private parts, or forcing the prisoner’s legs into 180-degree splits.<br />
“They also make rape threats towards the wives and sisters of the accused, or molest female relatives in front of you,” said Shaikh, who claims that one of his co-accused was forced to watch police officers molest his sister-in-law. “Through these means, the police managed to get false confessional statements from everyone.”<br />
Shaikh was the only accused at the time who did not end up signing a confessional statement, which he claims was a deliberate “strategy” on the part of the police’s anti-terrorism squad to prove in court that no torture had been involved in the interrogations. However, in the jail cells of various prisons in Maharashtra, Shaikh continued to face intermittent bouts of mental and physical torture till 2008. “At one point they fractured my arm and left me without medication for 15 days,” he said.&#8221;<br />

<p>&#8220;Slapped with untenable terror charges, many Muslim men have lost the prime years of their lives as they languished in jail. After their release they have found it difficult to adjust to a world that has changed in the interim, graduating from buses to metros, banks to ATMs, landlines to smartphones.</p>
<p>Recently, Nisaruddin Ahmad was acquitted in the Babri anniversary blast case after he spent 23 years in a Jaipur jail. There have been others too. Mohd Amir Khan was acquitted in 17 out of the 19 terrors charges he was fending off, but only after being incarcerated for 14 years. He had been charged with setting off 20 low-intensity bombs over 10 months during 1996-1997 in Delhi, Rohtak, Panipat and Ghaziabad. He told TOI on Tuesday: &#8220;The government has policies to rehabilitate surrendered terrorists, but nothing for those who are falsely charged.&#8221;<br />

<p>&#8220;The issue of alleged wrongful arrests is being repeatedly raised at various forums. While MPs have demanded clarifications on the same in Parliament, Minority Affairs Minister K. Rahman Khan had also written to Mr. Shinde expressing concern over &#8220;wrong arrests&#8221; of Muslim youths in terror cases. Mr. Khan also highlighted alleged misuse of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) against minorities and called for special courts to ensure speedy trial of all terror cases.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The six men, all Muslims, had been accused of being conspirators of a terror attack by two gunmen at Akshardham Temple at Gujarat&#8217;s capital city, Gandhinagar, on 24 September 2002 who had killed 33 people. This is what Adam Ajmeri, an accused who the lower court had sentenced to death and who spent 11 years in prison before the apex court acquitted him, told The Indian Express: …Qayyum [Mufti Abdul Qayyum Mansuri alias Mufti Baba], who too served 11 years, had been charged with writing letters the crime branch claimed to have found in the pockets of terrorists killed, but the Supreme Court noted that the bodies had a number of bullet wounds while the letters had no bloodstains, mud or bullet holes…</p>
<p>While [Altaf Malek, who was released in 2008 after serving his five-year term] was in Mumbai recently with Mufti, Ajmeri and Sheikh for a press conference organised by Jamiat-e-Ulema-e-Hind, his family was questioned about his absence, his wife and brother said. &#8220;The SC gave us a clean chit and the terrorist label has been removed, but the Gujarat police have become more aggressive,&#8221; said Malek, who used to work for an advertising agency in Riyadh and runs a small fabrication business now.&#8221;</p>

<p><em>&#8220;The serial blasts which occurred near Hamidia mosque near Bada Kabrastan after Friday prayers on Shab-e-Baraat day in September 2006, killed 37 and injured over 100 people in communally sensitive Malegaon power loom town in Nasik district in north Maharashtra. The bombs were planted on bicycles, ATS investigation revealed.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Now, can anybody who talks about &#8216;Islamic Terrorism&#8217; please tell me as to who is going to rehabilitate them. Sorry, you can&#8217;t rehabilitate all of them because one of them already died while spending his last days in prison. <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=It+took+10+years+to+prove+that+they+were+innocent&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youthkiawaaz.com%2F2016%2F06%2Fterrorism-charge-young-muslims%2F&amp;via=YouthKiAwaaz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">It took 10 years to prove that they were innocent<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>.</p>
<p>When some innocents who are framed and later released to live lives of misery and desolation they choose to narrate their story in protest. Mohammad Aamir Khan who was charged with murder, terrorism and waging war against the nation when he was 18 chose to narrate his tale of 13 years and 10 months in prison in his book &#8216;Framed As A Terrorist&#8217;. He includes the stories of many other Muslim men framed as terrorists and left to rot in different prisons across India. The book, for example, narrates the story of Maqbool Shah from Srinagar, who was arrested by the Delhi Police at the age of 17. He was accused of being involved in the Lajpat Nagar blast. It was in Tihar Jail that he spent the next 13 years, 10 months and three weeks.&#8221;</p>

<p>Indian Hindus, more specifically Hindutvavadis are fond of asking Muslims: Are you a Muslim first or Indian first. This question is obviously asked as a test of their loyalty to the nation. To them, if they think they are Muslims first, they are not patriotic. I now ask Hindus, again particularly the Hindutvavadis: Are you Indian first or Hindu first? And then I ask them:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>When Godse killed Gandhi, was he a Hindu first or Indian first? When you declare him a “brave” man and want to build his temple, are you proving to be Hindu first or Indian first?</strong></li>
<li><strong>When you destroyed Babri Masjid leading the country to worst ever social and emotional division since Partition, were you being Hindu first or Indian first? When you still hope to build Ram Mandir on the ruins of Babri Masjid, are you Hindu first or Indian first?</strong></li>
<li><strong>When you reserve Hindu Dalits, Hindu OBCs in the name of backwardness (about half of your population), and call any attempt for giving reservation to Muslims “appeasement”, are you Hindu first or Indian first?</strong></li>
<li><strong>When you call for making Gita and other Hindu scriptures part of educational syllabi, are you Hindu first or Indian first?</strong></li>
<li><strong>When Prime Minister Modi gifts Gita instead of a book on Gandhi or Indian History to foreign heads of state on his official visits, does he prove himself to be Hindu first or Indian first?</strong></li>
<li><strong>When Hindutva organisations try to equate “Hindu” with “Indian” giving fallacious grounds causing severe anguish to majority of Indians, are they trying to be Hindu first or Indian first?</strong></li>
<li><strong>When they raise voice only against terrorist attacks committed by Muslims and not against much greater number of Hindu terrorist attacks and much greater violence in riots, are they Hindus first or Indians first?</strong></li>
<li><strong>When instead of demanding severest punishment to Hindu leaders involved in communal riots, you honour them, are you being Hindu first or Indian first?</strong></li>
<li><strong>When they campaign for Hindus producing more and more children (so that they retain their demographic domination) are they trying to be Hindu first or Indian first?</strong></li>
<li><strong>When the Government declared Yoga Day and tried to present it as a national practice, was it Hindu first or Indian first?</strong></li>
<li><strong>When political parties like BJP and Shiv Sena endeavour to consolidate Hindu votes by promoting communal polarisation, do they behave as Hindu firstr or Indians first?</strong></li>
<li><strong>When you oppose Urdu, which is an Indian language, just because lately it has become more popular with Muslims, do you prove yourselves to be Hindus first or Indians first?</strong></li>
<li><strong>If tens of thousands of Hindus left India and became American, Australian or British citizens, while still retaining their religious identity, were they Hindu first or Indian first before their migration?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong> It does not mean that Hindus should not feel proud of their religion. They must. The follower of every religion must be proud of his religion if he has faith in it. Till a person or a community is fighting for its own principles or right, there is nothing wrong about it. The problem starts when instead of being concerned about itself, it starts targeting others.</strong></p>
<p>I find the very question of “what you are first/” absurd. Can you ask anybody: Are you a human first or Indian first?  Are you honest first or Indian first? Or a doctor first or Indian first? Are you Delhite first or Indian first?</p>
<p>To be Indian or not relates to one’s nationality. One can be an Indian, Chinese, American or Russian? To be a Muslim or Hindu or Christian or a Communist, Atheist etc relates to one’s ideology. One has several identities at the same time. I am an Indian by nationality, Muslim by Faith, Doctor by Profession, man by sex, and a Delhite by location. One can at the same time also belong to a political party. All these identities become important at different times. If as a doctor, I have to treat 10 patients having different nationalities, I will not treat Indian first but I will treat a patient, Indian or otherwise, who needs more urgent attention or who reported first. When you go to a temple and several people of different nations are there, you will not again identify them by nationality.</p>
<p>Nationality of a person in most cases is by chance, not by choice. When a person is born, he is just a human being. When he grows, he comes to know that he is an Indian and a Hindu/Muslim. He can then change or continue with the same identities.</p>
<p>I am a Muslim first when the question relates to Faith, I am an Indian first when it relates to nationality. If an Indian government in future becomes atheistic or Muslim or Christian, and that government asks a Hindu to do something which is against his faith, he will not necessarily accept it. Hindus may unite and campaign against the government even if they happen to be in minority.</p>
<p>Indian Muslims are mostly of Indian origin. Even those who are from foreign origin have accepted India as their nation. But Indianans does not mean that they can be persuaded by the majority to follow a wrong course in the name of nationality. Justice and honesty are above everything including nationality. If many American protested against American attack on Iraq, they proved that they were lovers of justice more than that of America.</p>
<p>It is just a ploy of the forces of Hindutva to keep raising issues that clouds the patriotism of Indian Muslims. I have seen British and Australian Hindus of Indian origin openly supporting Indian Cricket teams against their countries. Are they traitors? Indian Hindus feel the pain when a Hindu Australian or American is killed there. This is natural because they have common religion. On any ground of identity, one can feel closeness to anyone. When I was in Australia, I loved meeting Indian Hindus more than Saudi Muslims because of our common language and culture. When I went to Iran to attend a conference, my eyes were looking for any Indians, not for Iranian Muslims.</p>
<p>Religion tells you about your morality, about your preferences for good and bad. Nationality is about an administrative cohesion, which helps you achieve your aims in professional and other fields.</p>
<p>By putting such absurd questions, Muslims cannot be bullied anymore. They belong to this nation and the nation belongs to them. They have every right to influence the direction of Indian policies in every single field, and to get benefits from its achievements because they are partners in its work as well as result.</p>
<p>I am a great proponent of coming together of all religions, and I have recurrently argued that Indian Muslims and Hindus must come together against the immorality propagated by the current world for commercial aims. Westernism or New World Order, based on negation of religious morality and propagation of commercial morality, is a threat to every religion and the whole mankind. The fight today is not between religions but between religion and irreligion. Hindus and Muslims think alike in most matters be it family values, moral values or social values. We all hate alcohol, gambling, sex outside marriage and homosexuality and nakedness. We all are believers in God though our methods can be different. I will repeat here that Islam is not a religion started by Prophet Muhammad. Islam means submission to God, called Allah in Arabic and Parmeshwar in Hindi/Sanskrit and Jehovah in Hebrew. Hinduism in its original form may have been the old version of Islam, and Islam is the latest version of God’s religion, which includes Christianity, Judaism, Hinduism as well as Buddhism. Quran asks us to believe in the truthfulness of all the previous scriptures and messengers.</p>
<p><strong>I believe one should be human first and any other identity should be secondary. The lessons of humanity are taught not by nationalism but by ideologies, religious or atheistic. So any person should be a Hindu, Muslim, Christian, Buddhist or Communist first than an Indian, Russian, Chinese, American or Saudi. But this identity must be based on ideology and not community. If it is based on communal or ethnic considerations, it tends to be dangerous, especially when it is directed against others. Moreover, national identity should not necessarily mean support to the State in every matter, even if it goes against the principles of justice and humanity. Citizens must try to stop their governments from indulging in violent struggles against other countries.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Instead of indulging in a campaign of hatred, let us campaign for the commonness of morality in religion, and let us unite against the vices perpetrated by Westernism dominated by supremacy of Economics. Let those Hindus and Muslims who believe in this approach unite first. Others will follow.</strong></p>

<p>Here are the names of some Muslims who died liberating India from Britishers, article is taken from <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/The-unsung-freedom-fighters/articleshow/6312588.cms" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/The-unsung-freedom-fighters/articleshow/6312588.cms<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p><span id="advenueINTEXT">PATNA: Ask anybody who Bhagat Singh was or, for that matter, Ashfaqullah Khan. The reply will be they were freedom fighters who fought the British and were hanged for their rebellion. But nobody can say who was Ghasita Khalifa or Nandu Lal.</span></p>
<p>They were also freedom fighters who fought the British and hanged. But there is absolutely no mention of them in history books. The unsung freedom fighters got no recognition though they sacrificed their lives for the Independence of their motherland.</p>
<p>Now quite a few people know who Peer Ali Khan was. This martyr is now little known thanks to the state government&#8217;s decision to develop a children&#8217;s park opposite the residence of the Patna DM and name it after Khan who had been hanged at the same place in 1857.</p>
<p>But several other freedom fighters, who had been hanged or sent for rigorous imprisonment to Kala Pani&#8217;, Andamans, still remain unknown. For, history books do not include their names and the historians never made an attempt to dig out their sacrifices.</p>
<p>On July 7, 1857 as many as 30 rebels, including Peer Ali Khan, had been summarily tried in presence of then Patna commissioner William Tayler and 14 of them were handed out capital punishment.</p>
<p>Apart from Khan, others who were hanged to death were Ghasita Khalifa, Ghulam Abbas, Nandu Lal alias Sipahi, Jumman, Maduwa, Kajil Khan, Ramzani, Peer Bakhsh, Peer Ali, Wahid Ali, Ghulam Ali, Mahmood Akbar and Asrar Ali Khan. Hardly anybody ever heard these names.</p>
<p>As many as 13 others were awarded rigorous imprisonment with stakes and chains at that trial. They were Habibullah, Faiyaz Ali, Mirza Agha Mughal, Rajab Ali, Asghar Ali Beg, Deen Mahmood, Shiv Dayal, Bhanju, Jagdhar Singh, Sadat Ali, Bandhu, Munnu and Bihari. Nathu Chokar was ordered to be flogged and Peer Bakhsh Dafali and Sheikh Fakir were given life term.</p>
<p>The second trial was held on July 13, 1857 when Ghasita Doman, Kallu Khan and Paigambar Bakhsh were hanged and Ashraf Ali sentenced to 14 years of jail. At third trail on August 8, 1857 two more: Ausaf Husain and Chhedi Gwala were hanged and Sheikha Nabi Bakhsh, Rahmat Ali and Dilawar were awarded life imprisonment while Khwaja Amir Jan got 14 years jail term.</p>
<p>The list of these freedom fighters have been printed in a book recently published by the state archives department.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really very sad that these and many other people, who took active part in the freedom struggle and even sacrificed their lives, were forgotten,&#8221; said historian and Khuda Bakhsh Library director Imtiaz Ahmad. &#8220;There are numerous evidence to show that in the decades before the Upsurge of 1857, some eminent persons from Patna were active in mobilizing opinion and organizing support against the British,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Ahmadullah (1808-1881) was one such person who belonged to the family of the Ulema (clerics) of Sadiqpur in Patna. He was arrested by Tayler on charges of conspiracy to wage war against the Empire and was ferried to Andaman islands and his properties were confiscated.</p>
<p>Historian Qeyamuddin Ahmad wrote that all properties of Ahmadullah and others who were convicted or proclaimed as rebels were confiscated and their residential houses demolished. &#8220;The confiscated properties were sold at throwaway prices and out of the sale proceeds, totalling Rs 1,21,948, a Wahabi Fund was formed. Part of it was spent on the construction of a municipal market and on the expansion of the Patna College building,&#8221; the historian wrote.</p>
