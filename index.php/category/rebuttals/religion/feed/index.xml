<p>वो आयत, जिसकी बात सूरज की तरह रौशन है, इन नाम-निहाद इन्टलैक्चुअल्स को समझ नहीं आ रही है. अल्लाह (ﷻ) ने क़ुरआन <span style="font-size: 12pt;">18:86</span> में, &#8216;सय्यिदुना सिकंदर ज़ुल्-क़रनैन (रद़ियल्लाहु अ़न्हु)&#8217; के, मग़रिब की तरफ़ <span style="font-size: 12pt;">(</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">towards the west) </span>सफ़र के बारे में इर्शाद फ़रमाया:</p>
<p>&#8220;حَتّٰۤى اِذَا بَلَغَ مَغْرِبَ الشَّمْسِ وَجَدَهَا تَغْرُبُ فِیْ عَیْنٍ حَمِئَةٍ&#8230;. &#8220;،</p>
<p>&#8220;यहां तक कि जब सूरज डूबने की जगह पहुंचा, उसे एक सियाह कीचड़ के चश्मे में डूबता पाया&#8230;..&#8221;, [कंज़ुल् ईमान]
<p>इस आयत पर ये एतराज़ होता है कि: &#8220;क़ुरआन के मुत़ाबिक़ सूरज कीचड़/पानी के चश्मे में डूबता है.&#8221;</p>
<p>पहले इसका मुख़्तस़र और आसान जवाब सुनें:<a id="_Toc138956279"></a></p>
<p>इस आयत में, कहीं भी ऐसा नहीं कहा गया है कि: &#8220;सूरज कीचड़/पानी के चश्मे में डूब रहा था&#8221;, या: &#8220;कीचड़/पानी के चश्मे में डूबता है&#8221;, बल्कि वो मंज़र बताया जा रहा है जो हम सब आज भी समन्दर के किनारे खड़े होकर, सूरज डूबने के वक़्त देखते हैं, कि: &#8220;सिकंदर ज़ुल्-क़रनैन ने सूरज को काली कीचड़ के चश्मे में डूबता हुआ पाया&#8221;, अब इसमें कौन सी ऐसी अजीब बात है कि जो समझ में नहीं आ रही है इन लोगों के. ख़ुद अगर ये भी किसी समंदर के किनारे जाएं, या पहाड़ के सामने खड़े हों, तो शाम को सूरज डूबने के वक़्त यही नज़र आएगा न, कि जैसे सूरज समंदर के अंदर जा रहा हो, या पहाड़ के अंदर घुस रहा हो;</p>
<p>ये एक ऐसा ह़सीन मंज़र होता है कि इसे देखने के लिए अक्सर लोग साह़िले समंदर पर जाते हैं, और लुत़्फ़ उठाते हैं. मगर इस साफ़-सुथरी बात को कैसे शोरो ग़ोग़ा का ज़रिया बना लिया है लोगों ने, कि शैतान भी इनसे शर्मा जाए;</p>
<p>जब आपने ये मुख़्तस़र और आसान जवाब सुन लिया, तो अब बढ़ते हैं तफ़्स़ीली जवाब की तरफ़:</p>
<p>इस एतराज़ के दो जवाब में:<a id="_Toc138956280"></a></p>
<p>1. इल्ज़ामी <span style="font-size: 12pt;">(</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Offensive) </span></p>
<p>2. तह़क़ीक़ी <span style="font-size: 12pt;">(</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Defensive)</span></p>
<p>फिर &#8216;इल्ज़ामी <span style="font-size: 12pt;">(</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">offensive)</span>&#8216; जवाब को, हम कई तरह पेश करेंगे:</p>
[1] सनातनियों की किताबों से कुछ मिसालें;</p>
[2] यहूदियों की मौजूदा तौरात (ओल्ड टेस्टामेंट की पहली पांच किताबों), और ईसाईयों की न्यू टेस्टामेंट से कुछ मिसालें;</p>
[3] आ़म इंग्लिश/हिन्दी लिटरेचर से कुछ मिसालें;</p>
<p>फिर इसके बाद &#8216;तह़क़ीक़ी <span style="font-size: 12pt;">(</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Defensive)</span>&#8216; जवाब को कई तरह सामने रखेंगे:</p>
[1] इस आयत को मुफ़स्सिरीन ने कैसे समझा;</p>
[2] इस आयत को मुह़द्दिसीन ने कैसे समझा;</p>
[3] आयत का मतलब अरबी ग्रामर की रौशनी में;</p>
[4] आयत का मतलब अ़क़्ल की रौशनी में;</p>
<p>फिर आख़िर में &#8216;ख़ातिमा&#8217; पेश करेंगे;</p>

<h3>[3] आ़म इंग्लिश/हिन्दी लिटरेचर से कुछ मिसालें:<a id="_Toc138956288"></a></h3>
<p>(1) इंग्लिश दुनिया का मश्हूर कवि: <span style="font-size: 11pt;">&#8216;John Donne (d. 1631</span> <span style="font-size: 14pt;">ई</span><span style="font-size: 14pt;">.)</span><span style="font-size: 14pt;">&#8216;, </span><span style="font-size: 14pt;">जिसे</span> <span style="font-size: 14pt;">1621</span> <span style="font-size: 14pt;">ई</span><span style="font-size: 14pt;">. </span><span style="font-size: 14pt;">से</span> <span style="font-size: 14pt;">1631</span> ई. तक चर्च ऑफ़ इंग्लैंड में &#8216;सैंट पॉल्स कैथेडरल&#8217; के डीन की हैसियत से भी रखा गया, वो अपनी मश्हूर कविता: <span style="font-size: 12pt;">&#8216;The Sun Rising&#8217; </span>की शुरुआत इस तरह करता है:</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&#8220;Busy old fool, unruly sun,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Why dost thou thus,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Through windows, and through curtains call on us?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>क़ुरआन के इस बुलन्द साहित्यिक अंदाज़ को न समझ पाने वाले, क़ाबिल लोग बताएं कि वो इन लाइन्स को कैसे समझते हैं? इसका क्या मतलब है कि सूरज ये सब हरकतें कैसे दे सकता है जैसा कि कवि कह रहा है?</p>
<p>(2) विलियम शैक्सपियर <span style="font-size: 12pt;">(</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">d. 1616</span> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">ई</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">.)</span> ने अपनी <span style="font-size: 12pt;">&#8216;Sonnet 33&#8217; </span>में सूरज के बारे में लिखा है कि:</p>

<p>अब, क़ुरआन की साहित्यिक ऊंचाई तक न पहुंच पाने वाले लोग, मुझे बताएं कि सूरज ऐसा कैसे हो सकता है जैसा कि शैक्सपियर ने लिखा है?</p>
<p>(3) आधुनिक हिन्दी साहित्य के प्रमुख लेखक, कवि, नाटककार और सामाजिक विचारक: &#8216;धर्मवीर भारती <span style="font-size: 12pt;">(</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">d. 1997</span> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">ई</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">.)</span>&#8216; ने एक उपन्यास लिखा: &#8216;सूरज का सातवाँ घोड़ा&#8217;, जो बहुत मश्हूर है;</p>
<p>अब क़ुरआन की साहित्यिक बोली न समझकर, बात बात पर एतराज़ करने वाले लोग बताएं, इसका क्या मतलब है? क्या अब वो यहां भी यही कहेंगे कि: &#8220;धर्मवीर भारती के अनुसार सूरज घोड़ों पर घूमता है?&#8221;</p>
<p>(4) हिन्दी के एक प्रमुख लेखक, कवि, व निबन्धकार: &#8216;रामधारी सिंह दिनकर <span style="font-size: 12pt;">(</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">d. 1974</span> ई.<span style="font-size: 12pt;">)</span>&#8216; ने एक कविता लिखी, जिसका शीर्षक है: &#8216;सूरज का ब्याह&#8217;, अब जिसे साहित्य की बोली समझ आती है वो तो एक पल में समझ जाएगा कि इसका क्या मतलब है. मगर, क़ुरआन पर ज़ुबान-दराज़ी करने वाले, साहित्य को चौपतिया समझने वाले बताएं कि वो इस कविता के शीर्षक का क्या मतलब लेंगे? या ये शोर मचायेंगे कि: &#8220;रामधारी सिंह दिनकर के अनुसार सूरज का विवाह हुआ है.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;أَنَّهُ ثَبَتَ بِالدَّلِيلِ أَنَّ الْأَرْضَ كُرَةٌ وَأَنَّ السَّمَاءَ مُحِيطَةٌ بِهَا، وَلَا شَكَّ أَنَّ الشَّمْسَ فِي الْفَلَكِ، وَأَيْضًا قَالَ: وَوَجَدَ عِنْدَها قَوْماً وَمَعْلُومٌ أَنَّ جُلُوسَ قَوْمٍ فِي قُرْبِ الشَّمْسِ غَيْرُ مَوْجُودٍ، وَأَيْضًا الشَّمْسُ أَكْبَرُ مِنَ الْأَرْضِ بِمَرَّاتٍ كَثِيرَةٍ فَكَيْفَ يُعْقَلُ دُخُولُهَا فِي عَيْنٍ مِنْ عُيُونِ الْأَرْضِ، إِذَا ثَبَتَ هَذَا فَنَقُولُ: تَأْوِيلُ قَوْلِهِ: تَغْرُبُ فِي عَيْنٍ حَمِئَةٍ مِنْ وُجُوهٍ. الْأَوَّلُ: أَنَّ ذَا الْقَرْنَيْنِ لَمَّا بَلَغَ مَوْضِعَهَا فِي الْمَغْرِبِ وَلَمْ يَبْقَ بَعْدَهُ شَيْءٌ مِنَ الْعِمَارَاتِ وَجَدَ الشَّمْسَ كَأَنَّهَا تَغْرُبُ فِي عَيْنٍ وَهْدَةٍ مُظْلِمَةٍ وَإِنْ لَمْ تَكُنْ كَذَلِكَ فِي الْحَقِيقَةِ كَمَا أَنَّ رَاكِبَ الْبَحْرِ يَرَى الشَّمْسَ كَأَنَّهَا تَغِيبُ فِي الْبَحْرِ إِذَا لَمْ يَرَ الشَّطَّ وَهِيَ فِي الْحَقِيقَةِ تَغِيبُ وَرَاءَ الْبَحْرِ.</p>

<p>&#8220;ये बात दलील से साबित हो चुकी है कि ज़मीन कुरवी (spherical) है, और आसमान इसे घेरे हुए है, और इसमें कोई शक नहीं कि सूरज आसमान में है. और (अल्लाह ने) ये भी फ़रमाया: &#8220;और उस (ज़ुल्-क़रनैन) ने सूरज के पास एक क़ौम को पाया&#8221;, जब कि ये बात मालूम है कि सूरज के क़रीब किसी भी क़ौम का बैठना नहीं पाया जाता. और ये भी, कि सूरज, ज़मीन से कई गुना बड़ा है, तो ये बात कैसे अ़क़्ल में आ सकती है कि सूरज, ज़मीन के चश्मों में से किसी चश्मे में डूबे?</p>
<p>जब ये साबित हो गया, तो हम कहते हैं कि: अल्लाह का ये फ़रमाना कि: &#8216;सूरज को काली मिट्टी के चश्मे में डूबता पाया&#8217;, इसकी कई तरह से तअ्वील <span style="font-size: 12pt;">(</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">interpretations) </span>हैं, पहली ये कि:</p>
<p>जब सिकंदर ज़ुल्-क़रनैन, मग़रिब <span style="font-size: 12pt;">(</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">west)</span> में उसके डूबने की जगह पहुंचे, तो वहाँ उसके बाद कोई भी आबादी बाक़ी न बची, तो उन्हें ऐसा लगा जैसे कि सूरज किसी काले चश्मे या गड्ढे में डूब रहा है. जबकि हक़ीक़त में ऐसा कुछ नहीं है. जैसे कि समंदर का सफ़र करने वाला जब किनारा नहीं देख पाता, तो उसे भी ऐसा लगता है कि सूरज समंदर में ही डूब रहा है, जबकि वो हक़ीक़त में समन्दर के पीछे डूब रहा होता है;</p>
<p>दूसरी ये कि: ज़मीन के मग़रिबी इलाक़ों को समंदर घेरे हुए हैं. तो सूरज को देखने वाला ये ख़्याल करता है कि वो इन समंदरों में ही (डूब कर) ग़ायब हो रहा है. और इसमें कोई शक नहीं है कि मग़रिबी समंदर, ज़्यादा गर्म होते हैं, तो ये &#8216;ह़ामिया&#8217; भी हुए, और इनमें ज़्यादा काली कीचड़ और पानी होने की वजह से, ये &#8216;ह़मिअह&#8217; भी हुए. तो अल्लाह का ये फ़रमाना कि: &#8216;सूरज को काली कीचड़ के चश्मे में डूबता हुआ पाया&#8217;, इस बात की तरफ़ इशारा है कि ज़मीन के जिन मग़रिबी इलाक़ों को समंदर ने घेर लिया है, वो सख़्त गर्म जगह हैं.&#8221;</p>

<h3>2. इमाम क़ुर्त़ुबी (d. 671 हि.) ने इस आयत की तफ़्सीर में लिखा:<a id="_Toc138956292"></a></h3>
<p>&#8220;وَهِيَ أَعْظَمُ مِنْ أَنْ تَدْخُلَ فِي عَيْنٍ مِنْ عُيُونِ الْأَرْضِ، بَلْ هِيَ أَكْبَرُ مِنَ الْأَرْضِ أَضْعَافًا مُضَاعَفَةً، بَلِ الْمُرَادُ أَنَّهُ انْتَهَى إِلَى آخِرِ الْعِمَارَةِ مِنْ جِهَةِ الْمَغْرِبِ وَمِنْ جِهَةِ الْمَشْرِقِ، فَوَجَدَهَا فِي رَأْيِ الْعَيْنِ تَغْرُبُ فِي عَيْنٍ حَمِئَةٍ، كَمَا أَنَّا نُشَاهِدُهَا فِي الْأَرْضِ الْمَلْسَاءِ كَأَنَّهَا تَدْخُلُ فِي الْأَرْضِ، وَلِهَذَا قَالَ: &#8216;وَجَدَها تَطْلُعُ عَلى قَوْمٍ لَمْ نَجْعَلْ لَهُمْ مِنْ دُونِها سِتْراً&#8217;، وَلَمْ يُرِدْ أَنَّهَا تَطْلُعُ عَلَيْهِمْ بِأَنْ تُمَاسَّهُمْ وَتُلَاصِقَهُمْ، بَلْ أَرَادَ أَنَّهُمْ أَوَّلُ مَنْ تَطْلُعُ عَلَيْهِمْ&#8221;،</p>
<p>&#8220;और सूरज तो ज़मीन से कई ज़्यादा गुना बड़ा है, फिर इसके किसी चश्मे में कैसे घुस सकता है? बल्कि इसका मतलब ये है कि ज़ुल्-क़रनैन मग़रिब और मशरिक़ की तरफ़ तमाम आबादी से आगे निकल गए, तो उन्हें देखने में ऐसा लगा जैसे कि सूरज कीचड़ के चश्मे में डूब रहा हो. जैसा कि हम हमवार ज़मीन पर ये देखते हैं जैसे कि सूरज उसी में छुप रहा हो. इसीलिए अल्लाह ने (आगे) कहा है कि: &#8216;उस (ज़ुल्-क़रनैन) ने सूरज को एक ऐसी क़ौम पर उगता हुआ पाया, जिनके लिए हम ने सूरज से कोई आड़ नहीं बनाई&#8217;, तो इसका ये मतलब थोड़ी न हुआ कि सूरज उस क़ौम को छू रहा है, या उनसे चिपक रहा है. बल्कि इसका मतलब ये है कि सूरज उन पर सबसे पहले उगता है.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;और शायद वो बह़रे मुह़ीत के किनारे पहुंचे, तो उन्होंने ऐसा देखा, क्यूंकि उनकी नज़र के सामने सिवा पानी के कुछ था ही नहीं. इसीलिए अल्लाह ने कहा कि: &#8216;उस (सिकंदर ज़ुल्-क़रनैन) ने सूरज को डूबता हुआ पाया&#8217;, और ये नहीं कहा कि: &#8216;सूरज डूब रहा था&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>इमाम बैज़ावी के इस आख़िरी नुक़्त़े पर अगर ग़ौर करें, तो यही बात हम ने भी ऊपर कही है, कि ये नहीं कहा गया है कि सूरज ऐसे ऐसे डूबता है, या डूब रहा था. बल्कि देखने वाले को कैसा महसूस हुआ, उसका ज़िक्र है, बस. अब जब बात इमाम बैज़ावी की है, तो यहां एक अहम बात मज़ीद बताता चलूं:</p>
<p>इस एतराज़ को, एक अ़रब मुतनस़्स़िर <span style="font-size: 12pt;">(</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Christian Arab): </span>&#8216;अ़ब्दुल्लाह अ़ब्दुल् फ़ादी (प्रेसिडेंट ऑफ <span style="font-size: 12pt;">CIRA)</span>&#8216; ने जब अपनी ज़हरीली किताब: <span style="font-size: 12pt;">&#8216;Is the </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Qur</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">ʾ</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">ā</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">n</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> infallible</span>?&#8217; में लिखा, तो इमाम बैज़ावी का हवाला देकर धोखा देने की कोशिश की है, और इमाम बैज़ावी की मज़्कूरा इ़बारत <span style="font-size: 12pt;">(</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">abovementioned statement) </span>का बिल्कुल ज़िक्र तक नहीं किया, ताकि कहीं इसकी लाल रुमाल में छुपी हुई मक्कारी, सामने न आ जाए. हमने, इसीलिए इसकी इस नापाक किताब पर, इसी जगह हाशिया <span style="font-size: 12pt;">(</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">footnote) </span>लगाकर इसकी अ़य्यारी को ज़ाहिर किया है, और बताया है कि इमाम बैज़ावी तो इस बात का रद कर रहे हैं, जिसे ये साबित करना चाह रहा है.</p>

<p>&#8220;ये भी मुम्किन है कि: &#8216;काले कीचड़ के चश्मे में&#8217; से मुराद: &#8216;उसके पास काली कीचड़ का चश्मा&#8217; हो, या फिर ये मतलब हो कि उनके देखने में ऐसा लगा, और ऐसा इसलिए हुआ क्यूंकि वो मग़रिब के उस इलाक़े में पहुंच चुके थे जहां कोई आबादी बाक़ी न रही, तो उन्हें ऐसा लगा कि सूरज किसी अंधेरे गड्ढे में डूब रहा है. जैसे कि समंदर का सफ़र करने वाले को लगता है कि सूरज समन्दर में छुप रहा है.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;और कीचड़ के चश्मे में डूबने का मतलब ये है कि देखने में ऐसा लगा, न कि हक़ीक़त में. जैसे कि हम हमवार ज़मीन पर देखते हैं तो लगता है कि सूरज इसके अन्दर दाख़िल हो रहा है. ऐसा भी हो सकता है कि ये चश्मा समंदर का ही हिस्सा हो, और ये भी मुम्किन है कि सूरज इसके पीछे छुप रहा हो.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;ثبت بالدَّليل أنَّ الأرض كرة، وأنَّ السماء محيطة، وأنَّ الشمس في الفلك الرابع، وكيف يعقل دخولها في عينٍ؟ وأيضاً قال: &#8220;وجد عِنْدهَا قوماً&#8221;، ومعلومٌ أن جلوس القوم قرب الشَّمسِ غير موجودٍ، وأيضاً فالشمس أكبر من الأرض بمراتٍ كثيرةٍ، فكيف يعقل دخولها في عين من عيون الأرض؟ وإذا ثبت هذا، فنقول: تأويل قوله تعالى: &#8220;تَغْرُبُ فِي عَيْنٍ حَمِئَةٍ&#8221;، من وجوه:</p>
<p>الأول: أنَّ ذا القرنين لما بلغ موضعاً من المغرب، لم يبق بعدهُ شيءٌ من العماراتِ، وجد الشَّمس كأنَّها تغربُ في عينٍ مظلمةٍ، وإن لم يكن كذلك في الحقيقة، كما أنَّ راكب البحر يرى الشمس كأنَّها تغيبُ في البحر، إذا لم يرَ الشطَّ، وهي في الحقيقة تغيبُ وراء البحر&#8221;،</p>
<p>&#8220;दलील से साबित हो चुका है कि ज़मीन, कुरवी <span style="font-size: 12pt;">(</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">spherical)</span> है, और आसमान (इसे) घेरे हुए है, और सूरज चौथे आसमान में है. फिर ये बात कैसे समझ में आ सकती है कि वो एक चश्मे में दाख़िल हो रहा है. और (अल्लाह ने) ये भी फ़रमाया: &#8220;और उसके पास एक क़ौम को पाया&#8221;, जबकि सूरज के पास किसी क़ौम का बैठना मौजूद नहीं. और ये भी, कि सूरज, ज़मीन से बहुत बड़ा है, तो ये कैसे अ़क़्ल में आ सकता है कि वो ज़मीन के चश्मों में से एक चश्मे में दाख़िल हो रहा है? जब ये साबित हो गया तो हम कहते हैं कि अल्लाह के इस फ़रमान की तअ्वील <span style="font-size: 12pt;">(</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">interpretation)</span> कई तरह से है;</p>
<p>पहली ये कि: जब ज़ुल्-क़रनैन, मग़रिब के ऐसे इलाक़े में पहुंच गए, जहां कोई इ़मारत न बची, तो उन्हें सूरज ऐसा लगा जैसे कि अंधेरे चश्मे में डूब रहा हो, अगरचे हक़ीक़त में ऐसा नहीं है. जैसे कि समन्दर का सफ़र करने वाला सूरज को देखता है तो ऐसा ही लगता है जैसे कि वो समन्दर में ही डूब रहा है, जब किनारा दिखाई न दे तो. जबकि हक़ीक़त में वो समंदर के पार डूब रहा होता है.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;وربما توهَّم متوهِّم أن هذه الشمس على عِظَم قدْرها تغوص بذاتها في عين ماءٍ، وليس كذلك. فإنها أكبر من الدنيا مرارا، فكيف يسعها عين ماء، وقيل: إِن الشمس بقدر الدنيا مائة وخمسين مَرَّة، وقيل: بقدر الدنيا مائة وعشرين مَرَّة، والقمر بقدر الدنيا ثمانين مرة وإِنما وجدها تغرب في العين كما يرى راكب البحر الذي لا يرى طَرَفه أن الشمس تغيب في الماء، وذلك لأن ذا القرنين انتهى إلى آخر البنيان فوجد عيناً حَمِئة ليس بعدها أحد&#8221;،</p>
<p>&#8220;हो सकता है कि कोई वहमी ये वहम करे कि सूरज इतना बड़ा होकर भी पानी के चश्मे में कैसे डूब सकता है. जबकि ऐसा नहीं है. वो तो दुनिया से कई गुना बड़ा है, फिर पानी का चश्मा उसे कैसे समा सकता है. और कहा गया है कि सूरज दुनिया से, डेढ़ सौ या एक सौ बीस गुना बड़ा है, और चांद अस्सी गुना;</p>
<p>तो उन्होंने उसे चश्मे में ऐसे ही डूबता पाया जैसे कि समन्दर का सफ़र करने वाला — जिसे किनारा नहीं दिखाई देता — देखता है कि सूरज पानी में छुप रहा है. और ऐसा इसलिए हुआ क्यूंकि ज़ुल्-क़रनैन आख़िरी आबादी क्रॉस कर चुके थे, और वहाँ कीचड़ के चश्मे के सिवा कुछ नहीं पाया.&#8221;</p>

<h2>[3] आयत का मतलब अ़रबी ग्रामर की रौशनी में:<a id="_Toc138956315"></a></h2>
<p>पहले इस आयत में मौजूद, इस पूरे जुमले की तरकीब <span style="font-size: 12pt;">(</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">grammatical structure)</span> देख लेते हैं कि कौनसा लफ़्ज़ क्या है:</p>
<p>1. वजद (وَجَدَ): ये पास्ट टैन्स में, वाह़िद मुज़क्कर ग़ाइब <span style="font-size: 12pt;">(</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Singular, Masculine, Third Person)</span> के लिए आया है. इसका मतलब होगा: &#8216;उस एक मर्द ने पाया&#8217;,</p>
<p>2. हा (ھَا): ये पहला मफ़्ऊ़ल <span style="font-size: 12pt;">(</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">object)</span> है, जिसका मतलब हुआ: &#8216;उसे&#8217;,</p>
<p>3. तग़्-रुबु (تَغْرُبُ): ये दूसरा मफ़्ऊ़ल <span style="font-size: 12pt;">(</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">object)</span> है, जिसका मतलब है: &#8216;डूबता हुआ&#8217;,</p>
<p>4. फ़ी (فِىْ): ये ह़र्फ़े जार <span style="font-size: 12pt;">(</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">preposition)</span> है, जिसका मतलब है: &#8216;में <span style="font-size: 12pt;">(</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">in/into)</span>&#8216;,</p>
<p>5. ऐ़निन् ह़मिअतिन् (عَیْنٍ حَمِئَةٍ): ये मजरूर <span style="font-size: 12pt;">(</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">genitive)</span> है, जिसका मतलब है: &#8216;काली कीचड़ से भरा हुआ चश्मा&#8217;,</p>
<p>अब जब &#8216;वजद (وَجَدَ)&#8217; के साथ दो मफ़्ऊ़ल <span style="font-size: 12pt;">(</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">two objects)</span> पाए जा रहे हैं, तो अब ये &#8216;अफ़्आ़लुल् क़ुलूब <span style="font-size: 12pt;">(</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">actions of hearts)&#8217;</span> को बतायेगा. यानी दिल में जो एहसास हो, उसे बतायेगा. ये यक़ीन का मअ़्ना भी देगा. मगर इसका हक़ीक़त में उसी तरह पाया जाना ज़रूरी नहीं होता, सिर्फ़ मुम्किन होता है. यानी इस यक़ीन का, वाक़िअ़ के मुत़ाबिक़ होना ज़रूरी नहीं, बल्कि कभी ये वाक़िअ़ के मुख़ालिफ़ भी हो सकता है. सिर्फ़ मुअ़्तक़िद की तरफ़ निस्बत करते हुए इसे यक़ीनी कहा जाता है. जैसा कि तमाम अ़रबी नह़्व <span style="font-size: 12pt;">(</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Arabic Syntax)</span> की किताबों में लिखा है;</p>
<p>तो अब &#8216;वजद (وَجَدَ)&#8217; का सबसे बेहतर मतलब ये होगा कि: &#8220;उसे ऐसा महसूस हुआ कि सूरज कीचड़ के चश्मे में डूब रहा है.&#8221; और इंग्लिश में भी <span style="font-size: 12pt;">&#8216;found&#8217;</span> की जगह <span style="font-size: 12pt;">&#8216;Perceived&#8217;</span> तर्जमा सबसे बेहतर है. क्यूंकि &#8216;वजद (وَجَدَ)&#8217; का मतलब <span style="font-size: 12pt;">&#8216;Perception&#8217;</span> भी होता है. जैसा कि <span style="font-size: 12pt;">William Lane&#8217;s Lexicon </span>में भी है.</p>

<h2>[4] आयत का मतलब अ़क़्ल की रौशनी में:<a id="_Toc138956317"></a></h2>
<p>एक अ़क़्लमंद शख़्स, जिसके अंदर किताबें समझने की सलाहियत होती है, वो इस आयत को, क़ुरआन की दूसरी आयतों की रौशनी में आसानी से समझ सकता है, किसी तरह की कोई तह़क़ीक़ किए बिना. आइए इसपर कुछ अ़क़्ली दलीलें देते हैं:</p>
<p>(1) जब एक छोटे से क्लास का बच्चा भी ये जानता है कि सूरज, इस ज़मीन से कई गुना बड़ा है. फिर ये कैसे मुम्किन हो सकता है कि सूरज इस ज़मीन पर मौजूद किसी नदी, नाले, समुद्र, चश्मे या तालाब में, अपनी फिजिकल बॉडी के साथ डूब जाए? ऐसी समझदारी तो सिर्फ़ इस्लाम के दुश्मनों में ही पाई जा सकती है.</p>
<p>(2) हिन्दुस्तान के बहुत बड़े इस्लामी विद्वान, आ़ला ह़ज़रत इमाम अह़मद रज़ा ख़ान (d. 1921 ई.) की तह़क़ीक़ के मुत़ाबिक़, सूरज, ज़मीन से तक़रीबन 13 लाख, 13 हज़ार, 256 गुना बड़ा है, जैसा कि इमाम अह़मद रज़ा ने अपनी किताब: &#8216;मुई़ने मुबीन बहरे दौरे शम्स व सुकूने ज़मीन, पेज नं. 6&#8217; के हाशिये में लिखा है. अब जब इस्लामी विद्वान ख़ुद ये कह रहे हैं कि सूरज, ज़मीन से बहुत बड़ा है, फिर वही विद्वान ये बात कैसे नहीं मानते कि क़ुरआन के मुत़ाबिक़, सूरज एक चश्मे में डूबता है? जबकि एक मुसलमान कभी भी अपने क़ुरआन की बात से ख़िलाफ़, कोई राय पेश नहीं कर सकता. अब ऐसी अक़्ल तो सिर्फ़ इस्लाम के दुश्मनों को ही नसीब!</p>
<p>(3) जब क़ुरआन में कई जगह सूरज और चांद के बारे में ये कहा गया है कि ये सब आसमान में घूम रहे हैं. जैसा कि क़ुरआन 21:33 में, और क़ुरआन 36:40 में आया है. अब ये कैसे मुम्किन हो सकता है कि यही क़ुरआन ये भी कहे कि सूरज, ज़मीन पर मौजूद एक चश्मे के अंदर डूबता है? ऐसी अ़क़्ल तो क़ुरआन के दुश्मनों के पास ही मिलेगी.</p>
<p>(4) एतराज़ करने वाले बताएं कि जब क़ुरआन 6:78 के मुत़ाबिक़ सय्यिदुना इब्राहीम (अ़लैहिस्सलाम) ने सूरज पूजने वालों को, एक अल्लाह की इबादत के लिए कहा, और सूरज के डूबने पर कहा कि ऐसों से मैं बरी हूं. तो उस वक़्त, लोगों ने, सूरज को कहाँ डूबता पाया? आसमान में, या चश्मे में?</p>
<p>(5) जब इन दुश्मनों की जुनून वाली अक़्ल के मुत़ाबिक़, क़ुरआन की ज़ुबान में सूरज चश्मे में डूबता है. तो फिर उगेगा भी उसी जगह से, क्यूंकि चश्मे के अंदर तो उसके लिए कोई रास्ता ही नहीं बचा?</p>
<p>अगर कहें हाँ, तो अपने दिमाग़ का इलाज करें, क्यूंकि क़ुरआन 2:258 ने बता दिया है कि अल्लाह, सूरज को मशरिक़ (east) से उगाता है. साथ ही ये बात बच्चा-बच्चा जानता है;</p>
<p>और अगर कहें कि नहीं, तो फिर सूरज कहाँ जाता है उगने के लिए? चश्मे के अंदर कौन-सा रास्ता उसे मिल गया कहीं जाने के लिए?</p>
<p>(6) पूरे इस्लामी साहित्य की किसी भी मुअ़्तबर किताब में, एक भी इस्लामी विद्वान की लिखी हुई ऐसी लाइन नहीं दिखाई जा सकती कि उसने लिखा हो: &#8220;क़ुरआन के हिसाब से सूरज हक़ीक़त में ही चश्मे में डूबता है.&#8221;</p>
<p>ख़ातिमा:<a id="_Toc138956318"></a></p>
<p>इस एतराज़ पर, हमारे जवाबात पढ़कर, हर इन्साफ़-पसंद ये समझ जाएगा कि इस आयत को, दुश्मनों की तरफ़ से बेजा ग़लत बनाकर पेश किया जा रहा है, जबकि आयत का मतलब बिल्कुल साफ़ है. हमने हर ज़ाविए से जवाब देकर, सारे गोशों को घेरने की कोशिश की है. अब भी अगर कोई वही पुरानी रट लगाए, तो लगाता रहे. हठधर्मी का कोई इलाज नहीं होता. इतनी आसान सी बात, जिसे बच्चे भी समझ जाएं, उसपर इतना शोर मचाना ज़रूर किसी अ़क़्ल के अंधे ही की ख़ूबी हो सकती है, किसी समझदार की नहीं. मिस्र के बहुत बड़े आ़लिमे दीन: &#8216;शैख़ मुह़म्मद ग़ज़ाली (d. 1996 ई.)&#8217; ने, इस आयत पर यही एतराज़ करने वाले को जवाब देते हुए, बड़ी प्यारी बात लिखी, वो कहते हैं:</p>
<p>&#8220;فهم من قوله تعالى: &#8216;وَجَدَهَا تَغْرُبُ فِي عَيْنٍ حَمِئَةٍ&#8217;، أن الشمس تغطس فى الماء يومياً، ثم تخرج. ولم يدرك ما يعرفه الأطفال عندنا أن اختفاء قرص الشمس فى الماء إنما هو فى عين الرائى لا فى حقيقة الأمر&#8221;،</p>
<p>&#8220;अल्लाह के क़ौल: &#8216;उसने सूरज को कीचड़ के चश्मे में डूबता हुआ पाया&#8217;, से ये समझ बैठा कि सूरज रोज़ाना पानी में डूबता है, फिर निकलता है. ये, वो बात नहीं समझ पाया, जो हमारे यहां के बच्चे भी समझ लेते हैं, कि सूरज का पानी में छुपना, ये देखने वाले की नज़र में होता है, न कि हक़ीक़त में.&#8221;</p>

<p>अब अंदाज़ लगाएं कि ये एतराज़ सिर्फ़ कुछ ही सालों पहले पैदा हुआ. जबकि इसकी, और इसे पेश करने वालों की पैदाइश से सैकड़ों साल पहले ही, इस्लामी विद्वानों ने इसके जवाब लिख दिए थे. अब ऐसे क़ुरआन से कौन टक्कर ले सकता है, जिसकी ताक़त का हाल ये है कि दुश्मन के पैदा होने से पहले ही इसको समझने वाले उ़लमा, इनके वसवसों का इलाज कर देते है, अल्ह़म्दुलिल्लाह (ﷻ)!</p>
<p>ये वो अ़ज़ीम किताब है कि तारीख़ गवाह है, इसके ख़िलाफ़ जितना लिखा या बोला गया, उससे कहीं ज़्यादा ही इसे क़ुबूल किया गया. ऐसी ज़बर्दस्त किताब, जिसके बारे में ख़ुद क़ुरआन 11:01 में कहा गया है:</p>
<p>&#8220;كِتٰبٌ اُحْكِمَتْ اٰیٰتُهٗ ثُمَّ فُصِّلَتْ مِنْ لَّدُنْ حَكِیْمٍ خَبِیْرٍ&#8221;،</p>
<p>&#8220;ये एक किताब है जिसकी आयतें, ह़िकमत भरी हैं. फिर तफ़्स़ील की गयीं, ह़िकमत वाले, ख़बरदार की तरफ़ से.&#8221; [कंज़ुल् ईमान]
<p>आख़िर में, हम ऐसे कज-फ़हम लोगों के लिए दुआ़ ही कर सकते हैं कि अल्लाह (ﷻ) इन सब को कुफ़्र के अंधेरे से निकालकर, इस्लाम की रौशनी अ़त़ा फ़रमाए;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By Sulaiman Razvi</p>
<p>Islamophobic Hindus have made objection to verse 2:223. They have raised two questions about this verse which shall be answered in this article inshallah. I am not a scholar, I am just a common Muslim with basic knowledge, so may Allah forgive me if I make error in explaining Quranic verses here. First let&#8217;s read the verse,</p>
<p>Qur&#8217;an, Surah Baqara 2, verse 223 &#8220;Your wives are your tilth; go, then, unto your tilth as you may desire, but first provide something for your souls, and remain conscious of God, and know that you are destined to meet Him. And give glad tidings unto those who believe.&#8221; Translated by Muhammad Asad<br />
<span id="more-1268"></span></p>
<p><strong>First objection</strong>: Islam considers women as commodity by comparing womenfolk to tilth.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> If you read Qur&#8217;an you will find that Allah has used many parables and simile to explain various things in the holy Qur&#8217;an. And what is mentioned in 2:223 is a simile. By mentioning women on par with tilth, Islam has not treated womenfolk as tilth or commodity. One should try to understand the meaning behind this simile. What it says is that women are not merely for enjoyment, it encourages to have children for propagation, to carry on family name, to treat women well. Just as a farmer sows seeds in the field and reaps benefits of crops so a man should sow his seed in his wife and reap the benefit of having children from her. The farmer does not go to his field merely for recreation and enjoyment but for cultivation to get produce from it. In the same way, a man should go to his wife to produce children. Islam is not concerned about how one sows the seed but it is concerned about production. Neither this verse treats women as child production factory, it is the nature of human beings to marry and have children for the propagation of human race. I am amazed that it&#8217;s Hindus who are raising this issue because Hindu texts also mentions women as tilth and further goes on explaining it.</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 14.2.14 <span style="color:red;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">This dame </span></span>hath come, <span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;">an animated corn-field</span>: there sow, thou man, the seed of future harvest.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="http://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/062118_1619_testingdoes1.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Here is the link to above Hindi translation by Arya Samaji scholar Pandit Kshemkaran Das Trivedi <a href="http://aryasamajjamnagar.org/atharvaveda_v2/pages/p686.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">http://aryasamajjamnagar.org/atharvaveda_v2/pages/p686.gif<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>Arya Samaj founder Swami Dayanand Saraswati also wrote,</p>
<p>&#8220;Whosoever wastes this invaluable fluid in illicit intercourse with other people’s wives, prostitutes, or lewd men, is the greatest fool, because even a farmer or a gardener, ignorant though he be, does not sow the seed in a field or a garden that is not his own&#8230;It is a sin of the deepest dye to sow the seed, out of which great souls and distinguished men have sprung, in a bad soil (such as a prostitute) or to let a good soil be impregnated with a bad seed.&#8221; <a href="http://satyarthprakash.in/english/chapter-four/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right"><strong>Satyarth Prakash, Chapter 4, Page no 138-9, by Swami Dayanand Sawarwati, Tr. Dr. Chiranjeeva Bhardwaj</strong><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>Smritis also mentions this,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 9.33 &#8221;<span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;">The woman is said to be like unto a field</span>, and the man is like unto a seed; the origin of all creatures is (in) the union of the seed and the soil.&#8221; Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 9.51-53 Thus men who have no marital property in women, but sow their seed in the soil of others, benefit the owner of the woman; but the giver of the seed reaps no advantage. If no agreement with respect to the crop has been made between the owner of the field and the owner of the seed, the benefit clearly belongs to the owner of the field; the receptacle is more important than the seed. But if by a special contract (a field) is made over (to another) for sowing, then the owner of the seed and the owner of the soil are both considered in this world as sharers of the (crop).</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 10.69 As good seed, springing up in good soil, turns out perfectly well, even so the son of an Aryan by an Aryan woman is worthy of all the sacraments.</p>
<p>Narada Smriti 12.19 Women have been created for the sake of propagation, <span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;">the wife being the field</span>, and the husband the giver of the seed. The field must be given to him who has seed. He who has no seed is unworthy to possess the field.</p>
<p>Puranas also mentions it,</p>
<p>Padma Purana II.10.10-12a &#8221;Kasyapa said:- &#8230;The father is the giver of the semen (i.e. seed); and the <span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;">mother is always the soil</span>&#8230;.&#8221; Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p>Shastras also mentions it,</p>
<p>Vashistha Dharma Shastra 17.9 (Others say), <span style="text-decoration:underline;">&#8216;Carefully watch the procreation of your offspring, lest strangers <span style="color:red;">sow seed on your soil</span></span>; in the next world the son belongs to the begetter; (by carelessness) a husband makes (the possession of) offspring in vain.&#8217;</p>
<p>Apastamba Dharma Shastra Prasna II, Patala 6, Khanda 13, Verse7. Now they quote also (the following Gâthâ from the Veda): &#8216;(Having considered myself) formerly a father, I shall not now allow (any longer) my wives (to be approached by other men), since they have declared that a son belongs to the begetter in the world of Yama. The giver of the seed carries off the son after death in Yama&#8217;s world; therefore they guard their wives, fearing the seed of strangers. Carefully watch over (the procreation of) your children, lest stranger seed be sown on your soil. In the next world the son belongs to the begetter, an (imprudent) husband makes the (begetting of) children vain (for himself).&#8217;</p>
<p>Mahabharat also considers women as tilth,</p>
<p>Mahabharata Shanti Parva 13.49 &#8220;Bhishma said, &#8216;He who having begotten a son of his own loins, abandons him for some reason or other, cannot be regarded as the sire of such a son, for vital seed only cannot create sonship. Such a son must be held to belong to the person who owns the soil. When a man, desiring to have a son, weds a girl quick with child, the son born of his spouse must belong to him, for it is the fruit of his own soil. The person from whose vital seed the son has sprung can have no right to such a son. The son that is born in one&#8217;s soil but not begotten by the owner…</p>
<p>Mahabharata Adi Parva 1.120 The best of men are born in this world to beget children for discharging that debt. I would ask you, should children be begotten in my soil (upon my wives) as I myself was begotten in the soil of my father by the eminent Rishi?&#8217;</p>
<p>So how Hindus are going to explain these verses?</p>
<p><strong>Another allegation:</strong> This verse is obscene</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: I fail to understand how a verse which merely tells you to love your wife as you like for propagation is obscene? This verse has maintained decency, it is one&#8217;s own lustful mind which is finding obscenity in this verse. This verse was revealed as a response to the Jewish superstitious belief that if one copulates with wife from behind then the offspring would be born as cross eyed. Ismail Ibn Kathir r.a explains it as,</p>
<p>&#8220;(Your wives are a tilth for you,) Ibn `Abbas commented, &#8220;Meaning the place of pregnancy.&#8221; <span style="font-size:10pt;">﴿</span>Allah then said: (&#8230;so go to your tilth, when or how you will,) meaning, wherever you wish from the front or from behind, as long as sex takes place in one valve (the female sexual organ), as the authentic Hadiths have indicated. For instance, Al-Bukhari recorded that Ibn Al-Munkadir said that he heard Jabir say that the Jews used to claim that if one has sex with his wife from behind (in the vagina) the offspring would become cross-eyed. Then, this Ayah was revealed… Muslim and Abu Dawud also reported this Hadith. Ibn Abu Hatim said that Muhammad bin Al-Munkadir narrated that Jabir bin `Abdullah told him that the Jews claimed to the Muslims that if one has sex with their wife from behind (in the vagina) their offspring will become cross-eyed…&#8221;</p>
<p>The verse has maintained decency, it&#8217;s not obscene at all. But these Vedic verses are surely obscene,</p>
<p><span style="color:#444444;background-color:white;">Yajur Veda 19.88 &#8216;<span style="text-decoration:underline;">&#8216;<span style="color:red;">Just as a wife, the recipient of semen, at the time of cohabitation keeps her head opposite to the head of the husband, and her face opposite to that of his</span></span><span style="color:#444444;">, so should both husband and wife perform together their domestic duties. A husband is a protector like a physician. He lives happily like a child, and with tranquillity produces progeny with penis keen with ardour.&#8221; Tr. Devi Chand (Arya Samaj)<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#444444;background-color:white;">Atharva Veda 20.126.17; Rig Veda 10.86.16-17 &#8220;He whose organ [Penis] even in dream and even before cohabitation discharges genitive fluid may not be capable of having progeny. <span style="color:red;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">He whose long-shaped organ enters deep in the womb straight may be capable of having progeny</span><span style="color:#444444;">. Almighty God is rarest of all and supreme over all. Tr. Vaidyanath Shastri (Arya Samaj)<br />
</span></span></span></p>
<p style="background:white;"><span style="color:#444444;">Yajur Veda 19.76 &#8216;<span style="color:black;">&#8216;The generative organ [Penis] releases urine, <span style="color:red;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">but when it enters the womb [Vagina], it releases semen</span></span></span></span>…&#8221; Tr. Devi Chand (Arya Samaj)<span style="color:#444444;"><span style="color:black;"><span style="color:red;"><span style="font-size:14pt;"><br />
</span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="background:white;"><span style="color:#444444;">Atharva Veda 5.25.1 &#8216;<span style="color:red;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">The phallus of man which sows the seminal fluid, lays in the female organ</span> </span></span>as feather on a shaft, the seed of embryo which is drawn from limb to limb and from cloud and heavenly region.&#8217; Tr. Vaidyanath Shastri (Arya Samaj)<span style="color:#444444;"><span style="color:red;"><span style="font-size:14pt;"><br />
</span></span></span></p>
<p>These are just some examples, there are many more obscene verses in the Vedas including the one about sun god raping his wife by inserting his male organ in her mouth mentioned in Rig Veda Mandal 10, Sukta 17.</p>
<p>So reading these verses may help them understand. Long ago I was having a discussion with a Hindu who considered Quranic verse 2:223 to be obscene and went on to declare it as pornographic, astaghfirullah. I explained him this verse but he wasn&#8217;t convinced, I know how to handle such people who makes objections on Quran for merely maligning it so I showed him some verses from Vedas like mentioned above then suddenly he disappeared and the next day he was saying that these Vedic verses are not obscene at all as Ishwar is only giving knowledge of sexual intercourse through these verses. Can you handle such hypocrisy? They consider a Quranic verse which merely tells you to &#8220;<em>approach your tilth when or how ye will</em>&#8221; but considers such obscene Vedic verses as &#8220;Knowledgeable&#8221; when they explicitly mentions sex positions and sexual organs. One can read Quran 2:223 in front of elders and family members without any hesitation but can Hindus read such obscene verses from their Vedas in front of their family?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bismillah ir Rahman nir Raheem</p>
<p>This article has several rebuttals written by different scholars and preachers which is taken from different websites. It clears every doubt about sun setting in murky water in Quran and Hadith and also explains the meaning behind sun’s prostration.</p>
<p><span id="more-937"></span></p>
<h1>First rebuttal: Sun sets in the murky water as per Qur&#8217;an?</h1>
<p>One of the top-ten questions hurled at Muslims in any debate against Christians is about the following verse of the Holy Qur’an about Zulqarnain;</p>
<p>حَتَّى إِذَا بَلَغَ مَغْرِبَ الشَّمْسِ وَجَدَهَا تَغْرُبُ فِي عَيْنٍ حَمِئَةٍ</p>
<p><strong>“Until, when he reached the setting of the sun, he found </strong><em>(wajada)</em> <strong>it set in a spring of murky water: “</strong>(Qur’an 18:86)</p>
<p><a id="post-7959-more"></a><br />
They say, the verse clearly says that sun sets in the murky water and needless to say it is blunder and proves that Qur’an is not the word of God <strong></p>
<p>What does the Qur’an actually say</strong>?</p>
<p>Had the Qur&#8217;an actually said what they make it say, their conclusion would have been logical only. But they err in understanding the verse in the very first place.</p>
<p>1- The word used by the Qur’an:</p>
<p>I have given the translation of Abdullah Yusuf Ali above. The word he translated as “found” is وجد i.e. ‘<em>wajada.</em>’ This word is used to describe the perception. See the proof from the Edward William Lane’s Lexicon.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="400" height="76" class="wp-image-7960" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-web-archive-org-web-20160429044628im_-http.jpeg" alt="https://web.archive.org/web/20160429044628im_/http:/1.bp.blogspot.com/-WMf6BCvhrBY/TYuzdmDFdHI/AAAAAAAAASk/7AEhUeBcaIM/s400/lane%2Bwajada%2Bone.JPG" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-web-archive-org-web-20160429044628im_-http.jpeg 400w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-web-archive-org-web-20160429044628im_-http-300x57.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /><br />
And further he writes;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="400" height="81" class="wp-image-7961" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-web-archive-org-web-20160429044628im_-http-1.jpeg" alt="https://web.archive.org/web/20160429044628im_/http:/4.bp.blogspot.com/-u5HW5BBYigM/TYuzl-K3_sI/AAAAAAAAASs/FlynWmSX-VM/s400/lane%2Bwajada%2Btwo.JPG" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-web-archive-org-web-20160429044628im_-http-1.jpeg 400w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-web-archive-org-web-20160429044628im_-http-1-300x61.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /> Edward William Lane’s Arabic-English Lexicon p. 2924</p>
<p>So the word ‘<em>wajada</em>’ refers to perception through any one of the five senses.</p>
<p>2- Qur’an uses the wording from Zulqarnain’s perspective:</p>
<p>What we find is that Qur’an has used the word from the perspective of Zulqarnain and merely describes his perception and how it appeared in his sight. owH And the description is very much valid for on a shore that is how sunset actually seems. May be the following image helps a bit.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="359" height="348" class="wp-image-7962" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-web-archive-org-web-20160429044628im_-http-2.jpeg" alt="https://web.archive.org/web/20160429044628im_/http:/1.bp.blogspot.com/-oJMK75wieu8/TYuzwjMtYoI/AAAAAAAAAS0/0qZkHItC48c/s400/sunset.jpg" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-web-archive-org-web-20160429044628im_-http-2.jpeg 359w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-web-archive-org-web-20160429044628im_-http-2-300x291.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 359px) 100vw, 359px" /><br />
3- Muslims have always understood the verse like this:</p>
<p>Someone may argue, the above explanation is the concoction of modern Muslim apologists and the verse reads as the skeptics say because early Muslims never knew the scientific facts about the cosmos as they are known today.</p>
<p>In Tafsir Jalalayn co-authored by al-Suyuti (d. 911 A.H.) and al-Mahalli (d. 864 A.H.), we find the following words;</p>
<p>وغروبها في العين في رأي العين</p>
<p><strong>“… its setting in a spring is [described as seen] from the perspective of the eye.” </strong>(<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160429044628/http:/www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=1&amp;tTafsirNo=74&amp;tSoraNo=18&amp;tAyahNo=86&amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;UserProfile=0&amp;LanguageId=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">ONLINE SOURCE<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>)</p>
<p>Before them Ibn Kathir (d. 774 A.H.) wrote<strong>:</strong></p>
<p>رَأَى الشَّمْسَ فِي مَنْظَرِهِ تَغْرُبُ فِي الْبَحْرِ الْمُحِيطِ، وَهَذَا شَأْنُ كُلِّ مَنِ انْتَهَى إِلَى سَاحِلِهِ، يَرَاهَا كَأَنَّهَا تَغْرُبُ فِيهِ، وَهِيَ لَا تُفَارِقُ الْفَلَكَ الرَّابِعَ الَّذِي هِيَ مُثَبَّتَةٌ فِيهِ لَا تُفَارِقُهُ</p>
<p><strong>“… he saw the sun as if it were setting in the ocean. This is something which everyone who goes to the coast can see: it looks as if the sun is setting into the sea but in fact it never leaves its path in which it is fixed.” </strong>(<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160429044628/http:/www.tafsir.com/default.asp?sid=18&amp;tid=30770" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">ONLINE SOURCE<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>)</p>
<p>And even before him Nasiruddin al-Baydhawi (d. 691 A.H.) said:</p>
<p>ولعله بلغ ساحل المحيط فرآها كذلك إذ لم يكن في مطمح بصره غير الماء ولذلك قال { وَجَدَهَا تَغْرُبُ } ولم يقل كانت تغرب</p>
<p><strong>“Perhaps he reached shore of an ocean and saw it like that as there was nothing in his sight except water and for this reason it is said, “and he perceived it to set”, and not that it actually sets.” </strong>(Anwar al-Tanzil wa Asrar al-Tawil 4/14)</p>
<p>I hope all this detail leaves no ambiguity.</p>
<p><strong><em>LET ME TURN THE TABLES!</em></strong></p>
<p>In the Bible we have something interesting on these lines. Talking about the two mountains, Gerizim and Ebal, the Book of Deuteronomy tells us;</p>
<p><strong>“Are they not on the other side Jordan, by the way where the sun goeth down, in the land of the Canaanites, which dwell in the campaign over against Gilgal, beside the plains of Moreh?”</strong>(KJV, Deuteronomy 11:30)</p>
<p>Now the question is if the sun actually goes down? Certainly not! There is no doubt the verse simply refers to how humans perceive it and calling it a scientific error is nothing but sheer cunningness.</p>
<p>But the point here is, why adopt double standards? Why do the missionaries divorce with the common sense when they speak about Islamic texts?</p>
<p>Remember the words of Jesus, may Allah bless him?</p>
<p><strong>“Judge not, that ye be not judged. For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.”</strong> (KJV, Matthew 7: 1-2)</p>
<p><strong>Indeed Allah knows the best!</strong></p>

<h1>Second rebuttal: What does it mean that the “Sun runs on to its place of settlement?” When is this? How is this?</h1>
<p>Allah says: “And the Sun runs on to its place of settlement. That is the determination of the Mighty the Knowing.” [<em>Sûrah YâSîn</em>: 38]
<p>What does it mean that the “Sun runs on to its place of settlement?” When is this? How is this?</p>
<p>Abû Dharr al-Ghifârî, one of the Prophet Muhammad’s Companions, relates the following:</p>
<p>The Prophet (peace be upon him) said to me: “O Abû Dharr! Do you know where the Sun goes when it sets?”</p>
<p>I said: “Allah and His Messenger know best.”</p>
<p>He said: “It goes until it prostrates beneath the Throne. Then it seeks permission and permission is granted to it. Soon it will prostrate and it will not be accepted from it, and seek permission and will not be granted permission. It will be said to it: ‘Go back where you came from.’ Then it will rise from its setting place. This is Allah’s statement: ‘And the Sun runs on to its place of settlement. That is the determination of the Mighty the Knowing. [<em>Sûrah YâSîn</em>: 38]’.” [<em>Sahîh al-Bukhârî</em> (3199, 7424)]
<p>It is also found in. Its text, as related by Abû Dharr al-Ghifârî, is as follows:</p>
<p>The Prophet (peace be upon him) said one day: “Do you know where the Sun goes when it sets?”</p>
<p>They said: “Allah and His Messenger know best.”</p>
<p>He said: “It goes until it arrives at its place of settlement beneath the Throne. Then it falls down in prostration and remains like that until it is said to it: ‘Arise! Go back from whence you came.’ Then it goes back and rises from its place of rising. Then it goes until it arrives at its place of settlement beneath the Throne. Then it falls down in prostration and remains like that until it is said to it: ‘Arise! Go back from whence you came.’ Then it goes back and rises from its place of rising. Then it goes without people finding anything wrong with it until it arrives at that place of settlement it has beneath the throne. Then it will be told: ‘Arise! Enter upon the morning rising from your setting place’.”</p>
<p>Then Allah’s Messenger (peace be upon him) said: “Do you know when that will be? It will be when ‘its faith will not avail a soul which had not believed before or earned some good from its faith. [<em>Sûrah al-An`âm</em>: 157]’.” [<em>Sahîh Muslim</em> (159,205) ]
<p>The hadîth is also found in <em>Sahîh al-Bukhârî</em> in a highly abridged form (4803, 7433). Its text reads:</p>
<p>I asked the Prophet (peace be upon him) about Allah’s statement: “And the Sun runs on to its place of settlement&#8230; [<em>Sûrah YâSîn</em>: 38]”.</p>
<p>He said: “Its place of settlement is beneath the throne.”</p>
<p>Ibn Hajar al-`Asqalânî, in <em>Fath al-Bârî</em>, his commentary on <em>Sahîh al-Bukhârî</em>, writes:</p>
<p>This was how Wakî` related it from al-A`mash in an abbreviated form. It is a narration by meaning. In the previous narration of the hadîth, the Prophet (peace be upon him) asked Abû Dharr: “Do you know where the Sun goes when it sets?” [<em>Fath al-Bârî</em>(8/688)]
<p><strong>What about the fact that the Earth goes around the Sun?</strong></p>
<p>Some people have wondered how these texts should be understood in relation to the Earth&#8217;s movement around the Sun and the fact that sunrise and sunset are a consequence of the Earth revolving around its axis. What they fail to realize is that these texts talk about the Sun&#8217;s relationship to the Throne of Allah, not its relationship to the Earth.</p>
<p>The first point that we need to consider is that nowhere in any of these texts is it mentioned that the Sun is revolving around the Earth. The word used for the Sun’s motion in all of these texts is the verb “<em>tajrî</em>” meaning “to go, flow, proceed”. This verb is not qualified by any other words indicating a spherical motion of any kind or any specific type of motion relative to the Earth.</p>
<p>The second point that we must consider is that nowhere does the hadîth discuss the mechanics of the Sun’s motion in any way. Likewise, it says nothing about the mechanics of the motions of the Sun and the Earth on that fateful day when the Sun will rise from the West.</p>
<p>Thirdly, the place of settlement mentioned in the hadîth is beneath the throne and not under the Earth.</p>
<p>What we know scientifically about the Sun is that it is indeed in motion. It is traveling around the center of the galaxy at roughly 220 km/s in an orbit that takes about 230 million years to complete.</p>
<p>It may be interesting to take note of the fact that the Qur’ân mentions an orbital motion for the Sun. Allah says: “It is not for the Sun to overtake the Moon, nor does the night outstrip the day. They float each in an orbit.” [<em>Sûrah YâSîn</em>: 40]
<p>However, we must caution that the verse says nothing about the nature or placement of the Sun’s orbit. It states only that the Sun has one.</p>
<p>As for the Sun’s relationship to the Throne, which is what the hadîth is discussing, this is something that we cannot speculate about. The Throne is part of the Unseen and we know nothing about it except what Allah and His Messenger tell us about it. It follows that the Sun’s behavior in relationship to the throne, both spatially and temporally, is also a matter of the Unseen.</p>
<p>We must believe whatever Allah and His Messenger inform us about the Sun&#8217;s relationship to Allah&#8217;s Throne and not speculate any further on the subject.</p>
<p>We can, therefore, safely conclude that these texts are not taking about the Sun’s relationship to the Earth at all. They certainly do not indicate that the Sun orbits the Earth.</p>

<h1>Third rebuttal: Unreliable Hadith about Sunset in the Spring of Warm Water</h1>
<p>There is a Hadith from Sunan Abu Dawud that has been brought up by some anti-Islamic polemicists.</p>
<p><strong>The narration:</strong></p>
<p>The narration along with the chain of narrators goes as;</p>
<p>Yazid bin Harun- Sufyan bin Husain- Al-Hakam bin ‘Utaybah- Ibrahim (b. Yazid al-Taymi)- Yazid al-Taymi- Abu Dharr said: I was sitting behind the Apostle of Allah who was riding a donkey while the sun was setting. He asked: Do you know where this sets? I replied: Allah and his Apostle know best. He said: It sets in a spring of warm water. (Sunan Abu Dawud, Hadith 3991)</p>
<p>Related narrations:</p>
<p>In Musnad Ahmad these words are part of a longer narration reported through same chain of narrators;</p>
<p>Abu Dharr narrated, “Once I was with the Prophet riding a donkey on which there was a saddle or a (piece of) velvet. That was at sunset. He said to me, ‘O Abu Dharr, do you know where this (sun) sets?’ I said, ‘Allah and His Messenger know better.’ He said, ‘It sets in a spring of murky water, (then) it goes and prostrates before its Lord, the Exalted in Might and the Ever-Majestic, under the Throne. And when it is time to go out, Allah allows it to go out and thus it rises. But, when He wants to make it rise where it sets, He locks it up. The sun will then say, “O my Lord, I have a long distance to run.” Allah will say, “Rise where you have set.” That (will take place) when no (disbelieving) soul will get any good by believing then.’” (Musnad Ahmad, Hadith 21459 al-Risala ed.)</p>
<p>This narration is quite similar to the narration found in many hadith works including Sahih Bukhari, Sahih Muslim etc. except the words “It sets in a spring of warm water.”</p>
<p>In Sahih Bukhari it goes as;</p>
<p>Sufyan (al-Thawri)- Al-A’mash- Ibrahim (b. Yazid al-Taymi)- Yazid al-Taymi- Narrated Abu Dharr: The Prophet asked me at sunset, &#8220;Do you know where the sun goes (at the time of sunset)?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;Allah and His Messenger know better.&#8221; He said, &#8220;It goes (i.e. travels) till it prostrates Itself underneath the Throne and takes the permission to rise again, and it is permitted and then (a time will come when) it will be about to prostrate itself but its prostration will not be accepted, and it will ask permission to go on its course but it will not be permitted, but it will be ordered to return whence it has come and so it will rise in the west. And that is the interpretation of the Statement of Allah: &#8220;And the sun is quickly proceeding towards its destination. That is the designing of the All-Mighty, the All-Knowing. &#8221; (36.38) (Sahih Bukhari, Volume 4, Book 54, Hadith 421)</p>
<p>The significant difference is of the words <em>“it sets in a spring of warm/murky water.”</em></p>
<p>Analysis of the chains of narrators:</p>
<p>From Abu Darr, it both ways i.e. with and without the words under consideration, it narrated by Yazid al-Taymi and from him by his son Ibrahim bin Yazid al-Taymi. From Ibrahim it is narrated by six different narrators;</p>
<p>1- Al-A’mash: And from him at least five people narrate it. See Sahih Bukhari etc.</p>
<p>2- Yunus bin ‘Ubaid: And from him at least three narrators report this narration. See Sahih Muslim etc.</p>
<p>3- Musa bin al-Musayyab al-Thaqafi: From him it is narrated by Abdah bin Sulayman, See Al-‘Uzmah of Abu al-Shaykh al-Asbahani 4/1189</p>
<p>4- Abdul A’la al-Taymi: The narrator down from him is Mis’ar, See Hilyah al-Awliya 5/89</p>
<p>5- Harun bin Sa’d: Abdul Ghaffar bin al-Qasim narrates from him. See Al-‘Uzmah of Abu al-Shaykh al-Asbahani 4/1191 and Al-Tabarani’s Mu’jam Al-Awst, Hadith 4470</p>
<p>6- Al-Hakam bin ‘Utaybah: The sole narrator down from him is Sufyan bin Husain, See Sunan Abu Dawud, Musnad Ahmad, Mustadrak al-Hakim, Musnad al-Bazzar etc.</p>
<p>Of all these various routes from Ibrahim bin Yazid al-Taymi, it is <strong><em>only</em></strong> through Al-Hakam bin ‘Utaybah that these words <em>“It sets in a spring of warm water”</em> are narrated.</p>
<p>In short, there are six narrators reporting the hadith from Ibrahim bin Yazid, and only one of them i.e. Al-Hakam bin ‘Utaybah quotes the particular words. And to add to the trouble there is again only one narrator down from him and he is Sufyan bin Husain whereas parallel to Sufyan there are at least eleven people narrating the hadith without these words on the authority of five different people narrating from Ibrahim bin Yazid.</p>
<p>Following flow diagram for the above detail gives the pictorial display the strangeness of these words. Down from Ibrahim bin Yazid al-Taymi only the narrators with <strong>red</strong> outline for their names give the words under consideration against loads of other narrators who do not report these words.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="736" height="619" class="wp-image-7963" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/word-image-1.png" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/word-image-1.png 736w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/word-image-1-300x252.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 736px) 100vw, 736px" /></p>
<p>The narration is anomalous (<em>shaadh</em>) and defective (<em>mu’allal</em>):</p>
<p>This fact alone is enough to make the narration dubious. No doubt both Al-Hakam and Sufyan are <em>per se</em>trustworthy narrators but because on their respective levels they go against much reliable and numerous narrators. Such a narration reported this way is termed as “shaadh” i.e. anomalous.</p>
<p>Carefully read the definition of anomalous (<em>shaadh</em>) hadith given by Ibn al-Salah (d. 643 A.H.) in his<em>magnus opus</em>, “<em>Kitab Ma’rifat ‘anwa’ ‘ilm al-Hadith</em>” translated under the title “An Introduction to the Science of Hadith”;</p>
<p><strong>“… the anomalous hadith is the one which a <em>reliable transmitter</em> relates and which is in conflict with what other people relate.”</strong> (An Introduction to the Science of Hadith, Translated by Dr. Eerik Dickinson, Garnet Publishing Ltd. Berkshire 2006 p.57)</p>
<p>Also see the definition of defective (<em>mu’allal</em>) hadith given by Ibn Salah;</p>
<p><strong>“A defective hadith is one in which a defect impugning its soundness is detected, although it outwardly appears to be free of the defect. That may apply to an isnad made up of reliable transmitters which outwardly seems to fulfill the conditions of soundness. <em>Someone being alone in transmitting</em> the hadith as well as others contradicting him aid in catching the defect.”</strong> (An Introduction to the Science of Hadith, p.67)</p>
<p>And when a report or a part of it becomes “shaadh” it ceases to be a <em>sahih</em> (sound) report. For this the definition of a “Sahih hadith” will help.</p>
<p>Hafiz Ibn Salah writes;</p>
<p><strong>“The sahih (sound) hadith is a “supported” hadith (<em>al-hadith al-musnad</em>), the isnad of which coheres continuously through the transmission of one upright and accurate person from another up to its point of termination. The sound hadith can be neither anomalous (<em>shaadh</em>) nor defective (<em>mu’allal</em>),”</strong> (An Introduction to the Science of Hadith, p.5)</p>
<p>So merely being “sahih al-isnaad” is not enough for the report itself to be sahih.</p>
<p>Therefore, the very fact that Al-Hakam bin ‘Utaybah’s narrates differently from five other narrators reporting it on the authority of Ibrahim bin Yazid al-Taymi, makes the narration “shaadh” (anomalous) which is a kind of weak (<em>da’if</em>) reports.</p>
<p>But the trouble with the narration does not end here. Down from Al-Hakam bin ‘Utaybah, Sufyan bin Husain is also unique in narrating these words whereas the number of narrators down from narrators other than Al-Hakam narrating it from Ibrahim al-Taymi is at least eleven. There is not a single supporting narrator for Sufyan either.</p>
<p>Hafiz Al-Bazzar (d. 292 A.H.) after giving this narration writes;<br />
<strong><br />
“We do not know anyone other than Sufyan bin Husain reporting it through the chain: Al-Hakam bin ‘Utayba –Ibrahim- his father- Abu Dharr, while Yunus bin ‘Ubayd, Suleman Al-A’mash and Harun bin Sa’d have also narrated it from Ibrahim.” </strong>(Musnad Al-Bazzar- Bahr al-Zakhkhar, under Hadith 4010)</p>
<p>And this is important, not only because it adds more to the oddity of the narration, but also because Sufyan bin Husain though generally considered authentic was also criticized by few scholars. This criticism does not harm his general narrations but becomes significant when he goes out of the way and narrates what other narrators from the same original source do not.</p>
<p>Muhammad ibn Sa’d said about him: <strong>“He was reliable (but) he made many mistakes in his narrations.” </strong>(Tabaqat al-Kubra, Dar al-Kotob al-Ilmiyya, Beirut, 1990, vol.7 p.227 No. 3417)</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>:</p>
<p>These details make it quite clear that according to rules of reporting it is not right to attribute these words to the Messenger of Allah- on him be the peace and blessings of Allah.</p>
<p>Apparently, the words from Qur’an 18:86 were confused and appended to the hadith that had no link to the ayah whatsoever. The narrator failed to understand the real significance of the verse and the hadith and for apparent semblance he confused the two.</p>
<p>The verse from the Holy Qur’an i.e. surah 18 ayah 86 is simply about how the sunset appeared to Zulqarnain and even the classical Muslim scholars understood it like that.

<h1>Fourth rebuttal: Where Does the Sun Set, Hadith Error?</h1>
<p><strong>Question</strong></p>
<p>Assalaamu alaikum</p>
<p>Some critics of Islam use the following hadith to prove that the Quran teaches that the Sun sets in the murky water.<br />
Sunan Abu Dawud 3991—Abu Dharr said: I was sitting behind the Apostle of Allah who was riding a donkey while the sun was setting. He asked: Do you know where this sets? I replied: Allah and his Apostle know best. He said: It sets in a spring of warm water.</p>
<p>There reference might be approximate but can you please provide your scholarly opinion on this hadith and whether it is reliable or not.</p>
<p>Thanking you.</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong></p>
<p>Wa AlaikumuSalam,</p>
<p>The matter of where the sun sets has been sufficiently answered in our response titled, <a href="http://www.understanding-islam.com/q-and-a/miscellaneous-issues/regarding-al-kahaf-18-86-a-scientific-error-5198" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Regarding Al-Kahf 18:86 – A Scientific Error?<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>As to the hadith in question, there are several hadiths worded similarly but without the words, “sets in a spring of warm water.” If all the hadiths that are related are read, it can easily be appreciated that the quoted part is an error. The evidence is that each of the other hadiths end the with reference to the Qu’ranic verse from Surah Al Kahf 36:38, which notes the sun’s path (from the human perspective and from which we benefit) as a sign of God. Instead, in the hadith in question someone has erroneously managed to substitute one verse for another. In other words, instead of ending the hadith with the verse from Surah Al Kahf 18:86 the narrator replaced it with a verse from Surah Ya-Sin 36:38.</p>
<p>In analyzing the two hadiths (found in Abu Dawood #3991 and Musnad Ahmad #20933) that have this mistake – as opposed to the multiple hadiths that do not transfer the mistake – it becomes clear that the first source to report the hadith in the incorrect form is Al Hakam Al ‘Utaybah. His version is clearly a deviation from the multiple hadiths cited by other narrators. Additionally, he has only one person, Sufyan bin Hussain, narrating from him. While both narrators are generally considered reliable, there are a few scholars that voice some reservations about them. Following are the observations of the scholars about the two narrators:</p>
<p>Al Hakam Al ‘Utaybah</p>
<ul>
<li>Abu Hatim bin Hibban Al Yasti said: “He used to engage in Tadlees (i.e. implying that a hadith comes from someone when it didn’t or being ambiguous about the source or omitting a weak narrator who was in between two reliable narrators who have met each other).”</li>
<li>Abdul Rahman bin Mahdi said: “Steadfast reliability but vary meanings of hadith.”</li>
<li>Ibn Hajar said: “Steadfast trustworthiness, jurist, except he may have committed Tadlees.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Sufyan bin Hussain</p>
<ul>
<li>Muhammad Ibn Sa’d said: “He was reliable but made many mistakes in [transmitting] hadiths.</li>
<li>Ibn Hajar Al Asqalani said: “Yaqoub bin Sheebah said, ‘honest, reliable and in his hadiths there are weaknesses.’ ‘Uthman bin Abi Sheebah declared him, ‘reliable except he used to be a bit confused/disorderly.&#8217;”</li>
</ul>
<p>So while Al Albani (ra) certifies that the chain of narrators is solid, its contents come into question along with any potential flaws contributing to the problem. The point here is not to shed a negative light upon these narrators but to put in perspective that an error was made and because of their noted flaws this may have been the reason this version of the hadith developed. Keep in mind, there are multiple versions of this hadith but without the words “the sun sets in a warm spring.” When one seeks this hadith in Muslim (ra) and Bukhari (ra) there is no mention of the phrase. These two sources are the most authentic books of hadith and must be given proper consideration.</p>
<p>Lastly, it is clear that with the number of hadiths that report it differently than the one cited above combined with the fact that they come from only one narrator who was also criticized, makes the case that this hadith has been reported wrongly. Thus, the “critics” of Islam have no basis to their argument if they have not appreciated the actual statement of the hadith. Had they attempted to understand better they may have realized that the hadith in question is unreliable.</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>
<p>God knows best.</p>

<h1>Fifth rebuttal: AntiMuslim Sun Set Arguments Refuted by That Muslim Guy</h1>
<p>This was recommended by AC so I&#8217;ve reproduced it here. I have not had time to check it.<br />
<a href="http://quran-errors.blogspot.co.uk/2013/10/did-sun-set-in-muddy-pool-according-to.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">http://quran-errors.blogspot.co.uk/2013/10/did-sun-set-in-muddy-pool-according-to.html<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>Did the Sun set in a Muddy Spring according to the Quran? (Quran 18:86) [Detailed]
<p>A number of Critics of the Quran put forth that there is a verse in the Quran that states that the Sun sets into a Muddy or Murky body of water. They claim it is a clear Scientific Error.</p>
<p><strong>Verses in Question</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong> The verses in question are found in chapter 18 verses 83-90 of the Quran. Here, Dhul-Qarnayn is described as rightous ruler who travelled to spread the message of God. Please read these verses before reading the following.</p>
<p>The specific verse in question Chapter 18:86 says:</p>
<p>{حَتَّىٰ إِذَا بَلَغَ مَغْرِبَ الشَّمْسِ وَجَدَهَا تَغْرُبُ فِي عَيْنٍ حَمِئَةٍ}</p>
<p>When taking a look through varyious translations we gather what the verse is actually saying:</p>
<p>Until, when he reached the setting of the sun,<strong>he found it [as if]</strong> setting in a spring of dark mud&#8230; [Saheeh International]
<p>Until, when he reached the setting of the sun,<strong>he found it</strong> set in a spring of murky water&#8230; [Yusuf Ali]
[And he marched westwards] till, when he came to the setting of the sun, <strong>it appeared to him</strong> that it was setting in a dark, turbid sea [Muhammad Asad]
<p>Until when he reached the place where the sun set, <strong>he found it</strong> going down into a black sea&#8230; [Shakir]
<p>Until when he reached the setting-place of the sun, <strong>he perceived it</strong> setting in a miry spring&#8230; [Abdul Majid Daryabadi]
<p>Until, when he reached the setting-place of the sun, <strong>he saw it</strong> setting in a spring of hot and black muddy water&#8230; [Ali Unal]
<p>Till, when he reached the setting-place of the sun, <strong>he found it</strong> setting in a muddy spring&#8230; [Pickthall]
<p>until, when he reached the setting of the sun,<strong>he found it</strong> setting in a muddy spring&#8230; [Arthur John Arberry]
<p>until he reached the West and <strong>saw the</strong> sun setting in a pool of black mud&#8230; [N J Dawood]
<p>After looking at a few translation of the verse it becomes clear what the verse is saying. The verse clearly says Dhul-Qarnayn travelled to the end of the land (i.e. until he reached the sea), as far west as he could travel. When he travelled west and reached the coast, there was no more land in this direction (on is route to travel westward), there was only the ocean, and the sun was setting. And as he looked across the murky body of water he saw the sun setting at the horizon.</p>
<p>So what does the Quran <strong><em>actually</em></strong> say, does it state the sun enters the murky spring as the critics claim? The Quran was revealed in Arabic so to answer this we need to do a linguistic analysis of the verse.<br />
<strong><br />
Linguistic Analysis</strong></p>
<p>{حَتَّىٰ إِذَا بَلَغَ مَغْرِبَ الشَّمْسِ وَجَدَهَا تَغْرُبُ فِي عَيْنٍ حَمِئَةٍ}</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Until, when he reached the setting of the sun (maghrib), he found (wajada) it set (taghrubu) in a spring of murky water&#8230;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The main words in question in this verse are:</p>
<p>مَغْرِبَ (Maghrib)</p>
<p>وَجَدَ (Wajada)</p>
<p>تَغْرُبُ (Taghrubu)</p>
<p><strong>Meaning of  مَغْرِبَ (Maghrib)</strong></p>
<p>The word “maghrib” [مغرب] is literally meaning something that is doing غرب, or loosely (but commonly): “west” or “sunset”.</p>
<p>According to Almu&#8217;jam Alwaseet المعجمالوسيط( Arabic dictionary published by Academy_of_the_Arabic_Language ):</p>
<p>المغرب<br />
مكان غروب الشمس<br />
وزمان غروبها<br />
وجهة غروبها<br />
وبلاد المغرب البلاد الواقعة في شمال إفريقية في غربي مصر وهي ليبيا وتونس والجزائر ومراكش<br />
ومملكة المغرب اليوم الجزء الواقع في أقصى بلاد المغرب في غربي الجزائر ويحدها البحر<br />
المغرب</p>
<p>So, it&#8217;s :</p>
<ol>
<li>Place of sunset</li>
<li>Time of sunset</li>
<li>Point of sunset</li>
<li>Countries located in North Africa in the west of Egypt ( Libya, Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco)</li>
<li>The Kingdom of Morocco ( Called Maghrib in arabic )</li>

<p>Maghrib is used in other verses of the Quran where the word does indeed mean “west”, such as {رَبُّ الْمَشْرِقِ وَالْمَغْرِبِ} in Chapter 26:28 meaning “Lord of the east and the west”.</p>

<li>Place of Sunset, i.e. west as the sun sets in the west.</li>

<p>Also according to the authoritative lexicon of Qur&#8217;anic terms <strong><em>Mufradat al-Quran</em></strong> of Imam Raghib Isfahani:</p>
<p><strong>وجود بإحدى الحواس الخمس </strong></p>
<p>Perceiving something using one of the five senses</p>
<p>So according to:</p>

<li>Mufradat al-Quran<strong><em> </em></strong>of Imam Raghib Isfahani</li>
</ol>
<p>وَجَدَ (Wajada) means:</p>
<ol>
<li>To find.</li>
<li>To discover.</li>
<li>To perceive.</li>
<li>To see.</li>
<li>To experience.</li>
<li>Finding by means of any one of the five senses.</li>
</ol>
<p>Also this action of Wajada is done with a strong emotion.</p>
<p>So when Allah says &#8220;wajada it set (taghrubu) in a spring of murky water&#8221; it can mean:</p>
<p>he found/discovered/perceived/saw the sun set in a spring of murky water.</p>
<p>This means it is from Dhul-Qarnayn perspective, where he saw or perceived the sun setting in murky water. This can be easily seen when one travels to a shore whilst it is sun set and he will find it setting in the sea:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="359" height="348" class="wp-image-7979" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-4-bp-blogspot-com-q4ls3vhp0o4-ulrunokhrii-.jpeg" alt="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-q4ls3Vhp0O4/UlrUNOkhrII/AAAAAAAAAJY/bSb4W2VPxwk/s640/sunset.jpg" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-4-bp-blogspot-com-q4ls3vhp0o4-ulrunokhrii-.jpeg 359w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-4-bp-blogspot-com-q4ls3vhp0o4-ulrunokhrii--300x291.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 359px) 100vw, 359px" /></p>
<p>It is important to note that if the Quran wished to give the implication that the sun entered the body of water it wouldn&#8217;t of said:</p>
<p>Until, when he reached the setting of the sun (maghrib), he found/perceived/saw (wajada) it set (taghrubu) in a spring of murky water&#8230;</p>
<p>It would of said:</p>
<p>Until, when he reached the setting of the sun (maghrib), it set in a spring of murky water&#8230;</p>
<p>The usage of wajada shows that it is from Dhul-Qarnayn&#8217;s perspective.</p>
<p><strong>Meaning of  تَغْرُبُ (Taghrubu)</strong></p>
<p>The word used to describe the setting of the sun ‘in the murky spring’ is تَغْرُبُ [stemming from the word غرب &#8211; meaning to leave, be absent, be hidden, to depart, to be distant].  تَغْرُبُ  just means setting or disappearing. Meaning Dhul-Qarnayn found/saw/perceived the sun setting/disappearing.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the word used doesn&#8217;t mean to enter [دخل], neither to sink in/be swallowed up [خسف]. If the Quran wished to say the Sun entered the water it wouldn&#8217;t have used تَغْرُبُ (taghrubu) as تَغْرُبُ (taghrubu) doesn&#8217;t mean entering. It would of used  دخل meaning to enter.</p>
<p>Everything mentioned above is summarised in the following video:</p>
<p><strong><br />
Summary of Linguistic Analysis</strong><br />
<strong><br />
</strong> So the verse says that Dhul-Qarnayn reached maghrib &#8211; the time of Sunset or the place of sunset (west) &#8211; and he found/saw/perceived (wajada) it setting/disappearing (taghrubu) into a body of murky water.</p>
<p>This verse doesn&#8217;t state the sun goes into a body of water, there are no implications of this at all. What the verse states is that Dhul-Qarnayn found/saw/perceived the sun setting in a body of water, which would obviously be the case when he travelled as far west as possible until there was no more land to travel on. Just as one can easily do if they visit the sea-side and watch the sunset.<br />

Tafsir and Opinions of classical scholars</strong><br />
<strong><br />
</strong> How did Classical Tafsirs and Scholars understand this verse? Did they support the understanding above? Undoubtedly yes:</p>
<p><strong>Tafseer al-Jalalayn co-authored by al-Suyuti (d. 911 A.H.) and al-Mahalli (d. 864 A.H.):</strong></p>
<p>until, when he reached the setting of the sun, the place where it sets, he found it setting in a muddy spring (‘ayn hami’a: [a spring] containing ham’a, which is black clay): <strong>its setting in a spring is [described as seen] from the perspective of the eye</strong>, for otherwise it is far larger [in size] than this world; and he found by it, that is, [by] the spring, a folk, of disbelievers. We said, ‘O Dhū’l-Qarnayn — by [means of] inspiration — either chastise, the folk, by slaying [them], or treat them kindly’, by [merely] taking them captive. <strong>[</strong><a href="http://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=0&amp;tTafsirNo=74&amp;tSoraNo=18&amp;tAyahNo=86&amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;UserProfile=0&amp;LanguageId=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right"><strong>Source</strong><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a><strong>]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tafseer ibn Katheer (d. 774 A.H.):</strong></p>
<p>Until, when he reached the setting place of the sun,) means, he followed a route until he reached the furthest point that could be reached in the direction of the sun’s setting, which is the west of the earth.<strong> As for the idea of his reaching the place in the sky where the sun sets, this is something impossible, and the tales told by storytellers that he travelled so far to the west that the sun set behind him are not true at all. Most of these stories come from the myths of the People of the Book and the fabrications and lies of their heretics.</strong></p>
<p>(he found it setting in a spring of Hami’ah) meaning,<strong> he saw the sun as if it were setting in the ocean</strong>. This is something which everyone who goes to the coast can see: it looks as if the sun is setting into the sea but in fact it never leaves its path in which it is fixed… <strong>[</strong><a href="http://www.qtafsir.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2704&amp;Itemid=73" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right"><strong>Source</strong><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a><strong>]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Abu Hayyan al-Andalusi (d. 745 A.H) said in his Tafsir al-Bahr al-Muhit:</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;And the meaning of setting in a spring is that<strong>it is according what the eye sees</strong>, not that it it actually does so, just as we see it (the sun)on the smooth earth (land) as if it as if it goes into the earth. It is also permissible (possible) that this spring a part of the sea&#8221;</p>
<p>(Abu Hayyan al-Andalusi, Muhammad bin Yusuf,Tafsir al-bahr al-muhit, 1993, First print, Dar al-kutub al-&#8221;ilmiyya, vol.6, p. 151)</p>
<p><strong>Imam Al-Baidawi (d. 691 A.H.):</strong></p>
<p><strong>He probably reached shore of the ocean and saw it</strong> like that because there was but water at the furthest of his sight that’s why He says “he found it set” and does not say “it sets”. (Al-Baidawi, Anwar-ut-Tanzil wa Asrar-ut-Taw’il, Volume 3, page 394. Published by Dar-ul-Ashraf, Cairo, Egypt)</p>
<p><strong>Imam Al-Qurtubi (d. 651 A.H.):</strong></p>
<p>Al-Qaffal said: It is not meant by reaching the rising or setting of the sun that he reached its body and touched it because it runs in the sky around the earth without touching it and it is too great to enter any spring on earth. It is so much larger than earth. But it is meant that he reached the end of populated land east and west,<strong> so he found it – according to his vision </strong>– setting in a spring of a murky water like we watch it in smooth land as if it enters inside the land. That is why He said, “he found it rising on a people for whom we had provided no covering protection against the sun.” (Holy Qur’ân 18:90) and did not mean that it touches or adheres to them; but they are the first to rise on. (Al-Qurtubi, Al-Game’ le Ahkam-el-Qur’an, Volume 16, page 47. Published by Dar-ul-Hadith, Cairo, Egypt.)</p>
<p><strong>Imam Fakhr-ud-Deen Ar-Razi (d. 587 A.H.) in At-Tafsir-ul-Kabir:</strong></p>
<p>When Zul-Qarnain reached the furthest west and no populated land was left, he found the sun as if it sets in a dark spring, but it is not in reality. The same when sea traveller sees the sun as if it sets in the sea if he cannot see the shore while in reality it sets behind the sea. (Ar-Razi, At-Tafsir-ul-Kabir, Volume 21, page 166)</p>
<p><strong>According to Al-Mawardi (d.450 A.H) in his tasir (al-Nukat wa al-&#8216;uyun) the verse can be understood as:</strong></p>
<p>That He (Dhul Qarnayn) wajadaha (found it, saw it) setting behind the spring (&#8216;ayn) <strong>AS IF</strong>it was setting in the very spring&#8221;</p>
<p>:فيه وجهان</p>
<p>الثاني انه وجدها تغرب وراء العين حتى كانها تغرب في نفس العين</p>
<p>(Al-Mawardi, &#8216;Ali bin Muhammad bin Habib, Al-Nukat wa al-&#8216;Uyun, Unknown year, Dar al-kutub al-&#8216;ilmiyya, vol 3, p. 450)</p>
<p><strong>According to Al-Qutaybi (Ibn Qutayba , the famous scholar of Arabic language, d. 276 A.H):</strong></p>
<p>it is permissible for the verse to mean from the <strong>perspective of the eye</strong> (في راي العين)</p>
<p>و قال القتيبي: يجوز ان يكون معنى قوله(( في عين حمئة)) اي عندها عين حمئة او في راي العين</p>
<p>(Al-Baghawi, Al-Hussayn bin Mas&#8217;ud, Ma&#8217;alim al-tanzil, Dar Ibn Hazm, First print, 2002, p. 795)</p>
<p><strong>What about the hadeeth in Sunan Abu Dawud?</strong><br />
<strong><br />
</strong> There is a narration reported in the Sunan of Abu Dawud and in other sources that reads:</p>
<p><em>Yazid bin Harun- Sufyan bin Husain- Al-Hakam bin ‘Utaybah- Ibrahim (b. Yazid al-Taymi)- Yazid al-Taymi- Abu Dharr said: </em><strong><em>I was sitting behind the Apostle of Allah who was riding a donkey while the sun was setting. He asked: Do you know where this sets? I replied: Allah and his Apostle know best. He said: It sets in a spring of warm water.</em></strong><em> (Sunan Abu Dawud, Hadith 3991)</em></p>
<p>So the question is &#8211; Is this hadeeth authentic?</p>
<p>The answer is no. The hadeeth is Shadh (anonymolous) and Mu&#8217;allal (defective), rendering the hadeeth da&#8217;if, as has been demonstrated <a href="http://www.letmeturnthetables.com/2012/09/weak-hadith-sun-spring-warm-water.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right"><em>here</em><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a><em>. </em><br />
<em><br />
</em> The defintion of a Shadh hadeeth is the following:</p>
<p><strong><em>“… the anomalous hadith is the one which a reliable transmitter relates and which is in conflict with what other people relate.”</em></strong><em> (An Introduction to the Science of Hadith, Translated by Dr. Eerik Dickinson, Garnet Publishing Ltd. Berkshire 2006 p.57) </em></p>
<p>The definition of a Mu&#8217;allal hadeeth is the following:</p>
<p><strong><em>“A defective hadith is one in which a defect impugning its soundness is detected, although it outwardly appears to be free of the defect. That may apply to an isnad made up of reliable transmitters which outwardly seems to fulfill the conditions of soundness. Someone being alone in transmitting the hadith as well as others contradicting him aid in catching the defect.”</em></strong><em> (An Introduction to the Science of Hadith, p.67)</em></p>
<p>The Shadh and Mu&#8217;allal narrations are rejected by the Muhadditheen and cannot be attributed to the Prophet.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br />
<strong><br />
</strong> The allegation put forth against the Quran is utterly baseless and is simply refuted by the Arabic language. The verse contains no reference at all of the sun literally setting or entering or going down into a muddy pool of water.</p>
<p>It simply tells the story of righteous servant of God &#8211; Dhul-Qarnayn &#8211; who traveled on a journey until he reached the time of sunset or the western part of his empire and saw the sun setting, from his perspective, in a body of water. As anyone is able to do if they visit the sea side.</p>

<h1>Sixth rebuttal: The correct way to describe the sun is that it “prostrates beneath the Throne” and not that it “sets in a spring of warm water”</h1>
<p>The correct way to describe the sun is that it “prostrates beneath the Throne” and not that it “sets in a spring of warm water”</p>
<p><strong>It is narrated by Abu Dawood in as-Sunan (3991) that Abu Dharr (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I was with the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), riding a donkey, and the sun was setting. He said: “Do you know where this (sun) goes?” I said: Allah and His Messenger know best. He said: “It sets in a spring of warm water (innaha taghrubu fi ‘aynin hami’ah).” Is this hadeeth saheeh? If it is, then what does it mean? I have heard some non-Muslims using this to stir up doubts about Islam and cast aspersions on it.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Published Date: 2014-08-04</strong></p>
<p><strong>Praise be to Allah.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Firstly: </strong></p>
<p><strong>The hadeeth of Abu Dharr (may Allah be pleased with him) which describes the place where the sun goes was narrated via Ibraaheem ibn Yazeed at-Taymi, from his father, from Abu Dharr, from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him. </strong></p>
<p><strong>It was narrated from Ibraaheem at-Taymi by al-Hakam ibn ‘Utaybah, al-A‘mash, Fudayl ibn Ghazwaan, Haroon ibn Sa‘d, and Moosa ibn al-Musayyab, as was stated by Ibn Mandah in <em>al-Eemaan</em> (2/926) </strong></p>
<p><strong>They narrated it via two isnaads: </strong></p>
<p><strong>The first isnaad: </strong></p>
<p><strong>It was narrated by al-A‘mash, Yoonus ibn ‘Ubayd, Moosa ibn al-Musayyab and Haroon ibn Sa‘d. In this report it says that the sun goes and prostrates beneath the Throne or before its Lord; there is no mention of a spring of warm water. It appears in several versions, of which we will mention one here: </strong></p>
<p><strong>It was narrated that Abu Dharr (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said to Abu Dharr when the sun set: “Do you know where it goes?” I said: Allah and His Messenger know best. He said: “It goes and prostrates beneath the Throne, then it asks for permission (to rise) and permission is given to it. Soon it will prostrate, but it will not be accepted from it, and it will ask for permission (to rise) but permission will not be given to it; it will be said to it: “Go back to where you came from.’ So it will rise from its place of setting, and that is what Allah, may He be glorified, refers to in the verse (interpretation of the meaning): <em>“And the sun runs on its fixed course for a term (appointed). That is the Decree of the All-Mighty, the All-Knowing” [Yaa-Seen 36:38]</em>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>It was narrated via A‘mash by al-Bukhaari in his <em>Saheeh</em> (no. 3199, 4802 and 7424); Muslim in his<em>Saheeh</em> (no. 159); Abu Dawood at-Tayaalisi in <em>al-Musnad</em> (1/368); Ahmad in <em>al-Musnad</em> (35/282, 429); at-Tirmidhi in <em>as-Sunan</em> (no. 2186, 3227 – he said: It is hasan saheeh; an-Nasaa’i in <em>as-Sunan al-Kubra</em>(10/229); at-Tabari in <em>Jaami‘ al-Bayaan</em>, 20/516); al-Bazzaar in <em>al-Bahr al-Zukhaar</em> (9/409); Abu ‘Awaanah in <em>al-Mustakhraj</em> (1/100-101); at-Tahhaawi in <em>Sharh Mushkil al-Athaar</em> (1/254); Ibn Hibbaan in his <em>Saheeh</em> (14/24); al-Qutay‘i in <em>Juz’ al-Alf Dinar</em> (p. 183); Abu Nu‘aym in <em>al-Musnad al-Mustakhraj ‘ala Saheeh Muslim</em> (1/222); al-Baghawi in <em>at-Tafseer</em> (4/14); Abu ash-Shaykh in <em>al-‘Azamah</em> (4/1192); Ibn Mandah in <em>al-Eemaan</em> (2/924) and <em>at-Tawheed</em> (1/134, 135); Ibn Bashraan in <em>al-Amaali</em> (p. 159); al-Bayhaqi in <em>al-Asma wa as-Sifaat</em> (2/273); Ibn ‘Asaakir in <em>al-Mu‘jam</em> (2/1015); Abu Nu‘aym in <em>Hilyat al-Awliya’</em> (4/216) and others. </strong></p>
<p><strong>It was narrated via Yoonus ibn ‘Ubayd by Imam Muslim in his <em>Saheeh</em> (no. 159); an-Nasaa’i in <em>as-Sunan al-Kubra</em> (10/96); at-Tabari in <em>Jaami‘ al-Bayaan</em> (12/249); Abu ‘Awaanah in <em>al-Mustakhraj</em> (1/100); Abu al-‘Abbaas as-Siraaj in <em>Hadeeth as-Siraaj</em> (3/258); Ibn Hibbaan  in his <em>Saheeh</em> (14/21); Abu ash-Shaykh in <em>al-‘Azamah</em> (4/1189); Ibn Mandah in <em>al-Eemaan</em> (2/925, 926) and in <em>at-Tawheed</em> (1/136); Abu Nu‘aym in <em>al-Mustakhraj</em> (1/221). </strong></p>
<p><strong>It was narrated via Moosa ibn al-Musayyab by: Abu ash-Shaykh al-Asbahaani in <em>al</em>-‘Azamah (4/1188);</strong></p>
<p><strong>And via Haroon ibn Sa‘d by at-Tabaraani in <em>al-Mu‘jam al-Kabeer</em> (4/373); Abu ash-Shaykh al-Asbahaani in <em>al-‘Azamah</em> (4/1190). </strong></p>
<p><strong>Abu Nu‘aym (may Allah have mercy on him) said: </strong></p>
<p><strong>This is a saheeh hadeeth on which they (the hadeeth scholars) are agreed, from the hadeeth of al-A‘mash from Sufyaan ath-Thawri and others. It was narrated from at-Taymi al-Hakam ibn ‘Utaybah, Fudayl ibn ‘Umayr, Haaroon ibn Sa‘d, Moosa ibn al-Musayyab, Habeeb ibn Abi al-Ashras, and from Yoonus ibn ‘Umayd among the Basris.</strong></p>
<p><strong>End quote from <em>Hilyat al-Awliya’</em> (4/216) </strong></p>
<p><strong>The second isnaad: </strong></p>
<p><strong>It was narrated by al-Hakam ibn ‘Utaybah only, from Ibraaheem at-Taymi; in this report it says that the sun sets in a spring of warm water. </strong></p>
<p><strong>It was narrated that Abu Dharr said: I was riding behind the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) when he was on a donkey and the sun was setting. He said: “Do you know where this (sun) sets?” I said: Allah and His Messenger know best. He said: “It sets in a spring of warm water (<em>innaha taghrubu fi ‘aynin haamiyah</em>).” </strong></p>
<p><strong>Narrated by Ahmad in <em>al-Musnad</em> (35/363); Abu Dawood in <em>as-Sunan</em> (no. 4002); Hafs ad-Doori in Juz’ Qiraa’aat an-Nabi sall Allahu ‘alayhi wa sallam (p. 123); al-Bazzaar in <em>al-Bahr al-Zakhaar</em> (9/407); as-Siraaj in his <em>Hadeeth</em> (3/258); al-Haakim in <em>al-Mustadrak</em> (2/267) – he said: This is a hadeeth with a saheeh isnaad, although they (al-Bukhaari and Muslim) did not narrate it. All of them narrated it via Yazeed ibn Haaroon, from Sufyaan ibn Husayn, from al-Hakam. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Al-Bazzaar said: We do not know that anyone narrated it from al-Hakam ibn ‘Utaybah, from Ibraaheem, from his father, from Abu Dharr except Sufyaan ibn Husayn. Yoonus ibn ‘Ubayd narrated it from Ibraaheem at-Taymi, Sulayman al-A‘mash and Haroon ibn Sa‘d. End quote. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Secondly: </strong></p>
<p><strong>From the above it is clear that the version of the hadeeth of Abu Dharr which is most likely to be correct is the first one, in which it says: “It goes and prostrates beneath the Throne”, in which it makes no mention of it setting “in a spring of warm water (<em>innaha taghrubu fi ‘aynin haamiyah</em>).” This is based on several factors: </strong></p>
<p><strong>~1~</strong></p>
<p><strong>This wording is that on which the majority of narrators and those with the best memories agreed upon, in the report from Ibraaheem at-Taymi. </strong></p>
<p><strong>~2~</strong></p>
<p><strong>The second version (“in a spring of warm water”) was narrated only by al-Hakam ibn ‘Utaybah from Ibraahem, and al-Hakam – although he was trustworthy – was described by an-Nasaa’i as mudallis [i.e., he used vague wording to give a wrong impression] in <em>Dhikr al-Mudalliseen</em> (no. 11). Ibn Hibbaan said: He used to engage in tadlees. End quote from <em>ath-Thiqaat</em> (4/144). None of those who narrated his hadeeth said that he clearly stated that he heard it from the previous narrator; rather they all said that his report included the word <em>‘an</em> (from – instead of ‘I heard’, etc). Ibn Hajar mentioned him in <em>Maraatib al-Mudalliseen</em> in the second rank of mudalliseen (p. 30), who are the ones whose tadlees the imams (leading scholars) tolerated and from whom they narrated reports that they regarded as sound, because of their prominence and because they rarely engaged in tadlees  compared to others, such as ath-Thawri; or (it was tolerated) because they did not use engage in tadlees except when narrating from a trustworthy source, such as Ibn ‘Uyaynah. The fact that this report is contrary to the report narrated by the trustworthy narrators confirms the possibility that tadlees occurred in this hadeeth in particular. </strong></p>
<p><strong>~3~</strong></p>
<p><strong>The first version was narrated by both al-Bukhaari and Muslim, whereas the second version was not narrated by these two shaykhs. That is because they thought the first version was more likely to be correct than any other. Undoubtedly the reports in the books of al-Bukhaari and Muslim take precedence, according to the critics and scholars, than those in other books and <em>Musnads</em>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>~4~</strong></p>
<p><strong>There is a great difference between the two versions. The first one describes the sun as prostrating beneath the Throne, whether at the time of sunset or at any other time, according to different versions of the hadeeth. Prostration beneath the Throne is a matter of the unseen, and no one knows how it is except Allah, may He be glorified and exalted. He, may He be glorified and exalted, has told us that all created things prostrate to Him, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>“See you not that to Allah prostrates whoever is in the heavens and whoever is on the earth, and the sun, and the moon, and the stars, and the mountains, and the trees, and Ad-Dawab (moving living creatures, beasts, etc.), and many of mankind? But there are many (men) on whom the punishment is justified”</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>[al-Hajj 22:18]</em>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>No one knows how this prostration is or when it happens or its real nature except Allah, may He be glorified and exalted. Similarly, the hadeeth of Abu Dharr is no different from this verse at all, and there is nothing objectionable in it. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Al-Khattaabi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</strong></p>
<p><strong>It cannot be denied that it halts beneath the Throne, in a manner that we cannot see or comprehend; rather this is speaking about a matter of the unseen. So we should not disbelieve in it or ask how it happens, because our knowledge cannot comprehend it.</strong></p>
<p><strong>End quote from <em>A‘laam al-Hadeeth Sharh Saheeh al-Bukhaari</em> (p. 1893) </strong></p>
<p><strong>With regard to the second version, “It sets in a spring of warm water”, this is problematic, because the setting of the sun occurs when its disc disappears below the horizon, and it sets on some people and rises on others because of the movement of the earth around it. So it is not possible that the sun, which is of immense size, could disappear into a spring of warm water. With regard to the words of Allah, may He be exalted, in the story of Dhu’l-Qarnayn (interpretation of the meaning): <em>“Until, when he reached the setting place of the sun, he found it setting in a spring of black muddy (or hot) water” [al-Kahf 18:86]</em>, the commentators said that what is meant is to depict the scene that appeared before him, for he saw it on the horizon of the sea, as if it were sinking into it at the time of setting. The Holy Qur’an does not tell us that this was something that happnened in a real sense; hence Allah, may He be glorified, said “he found it setting” and He did not say “it was setting in a spring of black muddy (or hot) water.” </strong></p>
<p><strong>Al-Haafiz Ibn Katheer (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</strong></p>
<p><strong>That is, he way he saw the sun was as if it was setting in the ocean, which is something that happens to everyone who stands on the shore: he sees the sun as if it is setting into the sea, when in fact it does not leave the celestial path on which it is firmly established.</strong></p>
<p><strong>End quote from <em>Tafseer al-Qur’an al-Kareem</em> (5/191) </strong></p>
<p><strong>To sum up: whoever casts aspersions on the Sunnah because of this wording is ignorant of the precision of the hadeeth scholars in examining different versions of the hadeeth and distinguishing between the reports which are proven and those which are not proven. The fact that some scholars regarded this report as saheeh is problematic; rather what they intended was to class as saheeh the basis of the hadeeth, not to suggest that this version is more correct than that which is proven in <em>as-Saheehayn</em>: “It goes and prostrates beneath the Throne.” </strong></p>
<p><strong>In order to refute this specious argument, it is sufficient to note that the scholars of Islam were unanimously agreed that the earth is round and that all the celestial bodies are also round. It is on that basis that night and day alternate, because of the movements and rotation of these heavenly bodies. This is clear from many texts of the Qur’an and Sunnah. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: </strong></p>
<p><strong>The heavenly bodies are round, according to the Muslim scholars among the Sahaabah and those who followed them in guidance; that was also proven from them with isnaads mentioned in the appropriate places. In fact, more than one of the Muslim scholars narrated that there was consensus among the Muslims on that point.</strong></p>
<p><strong>End quote from <em>Minhaaj as-Sunnah an-Nabawiyyah</em> (5/442) </strong></p>
<p><strong>The Muslims were ahead of others in knowledge of astronomy; if the apparent meaning of this hadeeth contradicts that, then there would not have been consensus on the contrary; but the correct view is that the hadeeth does not contradict the scientific, astronomical facts. </strong></p>

<h1>Seventh rebuttal: Meaning of Prostration of the Sun under the Throne</h1>
<p><em>Meaning of the Hadith about the Prostration of Sun underneath the Throne of Allah, in the light of the context and significance of the verse of the Holy Qur’an (36:38) that is explained by the Hadith and the purpose of the prophetic teachings.</em></p>
<p>Following Hadith narrations are used by haters of Islam from amongst the Christians missionaries to attack Islam and by Hadith rejecters to question the divine origin of Hadith. Further it raises queries in the minds of general readers as well.</p>
<p>Narrated Abu Dharr: <strong>The Prophet asked me at sunset, &#8220;Do you know where the sun goes (at the time of sunset)?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;Allah and His Messenger know better.&#8221; He said, &#8220;It goes (i.e. travels) till it prostrates Itself underneath the Throne and takes the permission to rise again, and it is permitted and then (a time will come when) it will be about to prostrate itself but its prostration will not be accepted, and it will ask permission to go on its course but it will not be permitted, but it will be ordered to return whence it has come and so it will rise in the west. And that is the interpretation of the Statement of Allah: &#8220;<em>And the sun is quickly proceeding towards its destination. That is the designing of the All-Mighty, the All-Knowing</em>. &#8221; (36.38)</strong><br />
(Sahih Bukhari, Volume 4, Book 54, Hadith 421)</p>
<p>In a narration, again from Sayyidina Abu Dharr, there appear the additional words to the effect:</p>
<p>“I asked the Prophet about the Statement of Allah: &#8212; ‘<strong><em>And the sun is quickly proceeding towards its destination. That is the designing of the All-Mighty, the All-Knowing</em></strong> &#8216; (36.38) <strong>He said, ‘Its course is underneath &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Throne.’&#8221; </strong>(Sahih Bukhari, Volume 6, Book 60, Hadith 327)</p>
<p>Following is the explanation given by Mufti Muhammad Shafi’ after quoting the above narrations in his commentary (<em>tafsir</em>) to Qur’an 36:38.<a id="post-7959-_ftnref1_9241"></a><a href="https://www.letmeturnthetables.com/2012/09/sun-prostration-throne-hadith-explained.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">1<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p><strong>The Prostration of the Sun: A look into the phenomenon of the sun performing <em>sajdah</em>(prostration) beneath the <em>‘arsh </em>(the Divine Throne)</strong></p>
<p>From these narrations of Hadith, we learn that <em>mustaqar</em> means a spatial destination, that is, a place where on orbit of the movement of the sun stands completed- and they also tell us that this place is beneath the<em>‘arsh </em>(the Throne of Allah). Hence, the verse would mean that, everyday, the sun moves towards a particular destination, and once it has reached there, it performs prostration before Allah and seeks His permission for the next orbit. Once permission is given, it begins the next orbit.</p>
<p><strong>Questions about the Hadith</strong>:</p>
<p>But, when seen outwardly, several strong difficulties arise on the basis of principles laid down by experiments, observations and astronomy.</p>
<p>1. The state of the <em>‘arsh</em> of Allah (generally referred to as Divine Throne) as understood from the Qur’an and Sunnah is that it surrounds all that we know as the masses of the land and expanses of the sky. All these masses and expanses along with planets and stars, without any exceptions, are enclosed within the<em>‘arsh</em>&#8211; and the <em>‘arsh</em> of Allah holds the entire cosmic universe inside itself. If seen from this angle, the sun is, in all conditions and all the times, simply under the <em>‘arsh</em>. What, then, would be the sense of going beneath the <em>‘arsh</em> after it sets?</p>
<p>2. It is common observation that the sun, after it sets at someplace, does rise elsewhere. Therefore, its rising and setting is an ongoing phenomenon, what then is the meaning of going beneath the <em>‘arsh</em> after setting and doing prostration?</p>
<p>3. From the apparent sense of the Hadith mentioned above, we learn that the sun, after having reached its destination (<em>mustaqar</em>), pauses within which it offers <em>sajdah</em> (prostration) before Allah and seeks the permission for the next orbit- although, there being no break in the movement of the sun at any time is an open observation. And since this rising and setting of the sun keeps taking place all the time in terms of different locations, therefore, this pause should also be there all the time as result of which sun should not have any movement any time.</p>
<p><strong>Some clarifications and reminders before the actual explanation</strong></p>
<p>To understand its answer, it must be borne in mind that to the extent the explanation of the cited verse (i.e. Qur’an 36:38 for itself) is concerned, no difficulty out of the doubts and difficulties mentioned above relates to the Qur’an. The sense it carries is no more than that Allah Almighty has commissioned the sun to move in such an organized and steady was that it keeps moving continuously in a single state towards its destination (<em>mustaqar</em>). I</p>
<p>Any doubts, out of the doubts mentioned above, does not apply to what has been said in the cited verse. However, all these doubts and difficulties in comprehension do arise from the Hadith statement about the sun that soon after its setting, it goes beneath the <em>‘arsh </em>(Divine Throne), performs <em>sajdah</em> (prostration) and seeks permission to start the next orbit. And this debate sprung up in relation to this verse for the reason that, in some words of the hadith, reference has been made to this verse. Answers to these doubts given by experts of the Hadith and commentators of the Qur’an differ. From the apparent connotation of the words there, it is generally gathered that this <em>sajdah</em> of the sun takes effect only once in day-night span after its setting.</p>
<p>The clear cut, and cloudless rejoinder seems to be that which Allama Shabbir Ahmad Usmani has given in his treatise (<em>Sujud al-Shams</em>: The Prostration of the Sun) which finds support in the statement of several leading commentators.</p>
<p>Before one proceeds to understand the presentation … It should be borne in mind that the argument of the Qur’an and the noble prophets through the creations in the heavens and the earth and the major changes that occur therein is limited to the extent that could be rationalized by every human being by virtue of bare observation and elementary deliberation. Technical refinements of philosophy and mathematics that can be resolved by experts in the field alone are not the material on which argument of this nature is based; nor are people invited to deliberate on these. The reason is simple. <strong><em>Believing in Allah the Almighty and acting in accordance with His message is the duty of every human being- learned or illiterate, man or woman, urbanite or villager, dweller of some mountain or island. Therefore, prophetic teachings are synchronized with the level of perception, reason and understanding of common people that need no technical expertise.</em></strong></p>
<p>Take the example of knowing the time of <em>salah </em>(daily ritual prayers), fixing the orientation of <em>qiblah </em>(the Holy Ka’ba in Makkah), and knowing the months, years and dates. The knowledge of all these things can also be acquired through mathematical computations. But the <em>shariah</em> (Law) of Islam has, rather than rely on high-tech mathematical calculations to determine any of these things, placed reliance on common observations. Months and years and theirs dates were set in accordance with the lunar calendars. The basis of determining whether the new moon has or has not appeared was declared to be physical observation alone, the seeing of the new moon. The days of fasting and the hajj were fixed on that very basis. When some people asked the Holy Prophet about the secret behind the waning, waxing and disappearing of the moon and then its rising again, the answer to it was given by the Qur’an on his behalf: “<em>Say: They are indicative of time for the people, and of the Hajj”</em>&#8211; (Al-Baqarah, 2:189) In other words, the Holy Prophet was asked to tell people that all those changes occurring in the life of the moon are there so that they could find out when the month begins and ends and then find out its dates and determine the days of the Hajj. The answer served them with a warning against their unnecessary and ineffectual question, because no business of theirs, in this world or in the next, hinges on finding the reality behind it. Therefore, they were supposed to ask only about something that related to either their worldly or other worldly need.</p>
<p><strong>The context of the verse quoted in the hadith</strong></p>
<p>After these initial remarks, let us give a little though to the essential matter before us. Is it not that, in the cited verses, Allah the Almighty has, after having mentioned some manifestations of His perfect power and infinite wisdom, invited human beings to believe?<a id="post-7959-_ftnref2_9241"></a><a href="http://www.letmeturnthetables.com/2012/09/sun-prostration-throne-hadith-explained.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">2<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> Of these mentioned first was the land that is before us all the time:</p>
<p><strong>“And a sign for them is the dead LAND.” </strong>(36:33)</p>
<p>Then mention was made of how rains made it come alive and the growth of trees and other produce became possible- something everyone sees and knows:</p>
<p><strong>“We GAVE IT LIFE and BROUGHT FORTH GRAIN from it; so from it they eat.” (36:33)</strong></p>
<p>Mentioned first after that was the daily alternation of the night and day:</p>
<p><strong>“And a sign for them is the night. We strip (the cover of) the day from it, and they are suddenly in darkness.”</strong> (36:37)</p>
<p>Mentioned thereafter were planets and stars. Out of these, about the sun it was said:</p>
<p><strong>“And the sun is quickly proceeding towards its destination. That is the designing of the All-Mighty, the All-Knowing.” </strong>(36:38)</p>
<p>Think about it. The purpose here is to tell that the sun is not moving on its own, not of its volition or power. Instead, it is moving in subservience to the One who is Mighty and Knowing, and moving under the predetermined system originated by an entity with great power and knowledge.</p>
<p>The Holy Prophet, close to the time of one sunset, had alerted Sayyidina Abu Dharr al-Ghifari to the reality behind it during a question answer interlude with him. He has told him that the sun, at the time of its setting, performs a prostration before Allah the Almighty beneath the <em>‘arsh</em> and seeks the permission to start the next orbit. When it has the permission, it moves as usual and rises from the east in the morning. Its outcome is no more than that the atmosphere of the world goes through a new transformation at the time of the setting and rising of the sun, something that depends on the sun. <strong><em>The Holy Prophet, took this moment as suitable to teach human beings their essential lesson that they should not take the sun to be an independent entity moving of its own volition and power.</em></strong><em> </em>It moves only under the permission and will of Allah the Almighty. Every time it rises and every time it sets has to be with His permission, for it is subservient to His permission. <strong><em>This very act of moving under the command of Allah the Almighty has been declared to be its prostration, the act of prostration before its creator.</em></strong> The reason is that a prostration made by anything happens to be appropriate to its state of being as the Qur&#8217;an has itself clearly said:</p>
<p><strong>“Did you not realize that the greatness of Allah is proclaimed by all those in the heavens and the earth, and by the birds with their wings spread out? Everyone knows one‘s own (way of) praying (to Allah) and one‘s own (way of) proclaiming Allah‘s greatness.” </strong>(24:41)</p>
<p>It means that the entire creation of Allah is engaged in worshipping and glorifying Allah, but each has its own separate way of doing it that has already been taught to it just like human beings who have been told how to do their <em>salah</em> and <em>tasbih</em>. Therefore, taking the prostration<em> (sajdah</em>) of the sun to mean that it can take effect only when it places its forehead on some floor like a human being would not be correct.</p>
<p>And when it stands clarified from the statements of the Qur&#8217;an and Sunnah that the Divine Throne, the <em>‘arsh</em>of the Allah, surrounds all heavens and stars and surfaces, it is already obvious that the sun is nowhere but under the <em>‘arsh</em>, at all times and at every place. And when experience bears out that the time the sun is setting at one place, it is also rising at another. Therefore, no moment of the sun is free of either rising or setting. Thus, the being of the sun under the <em>‘arsh</em> is also perennial under all states and so is its setting and rising. Therefore, the outcome of the subject mentioned in the Hadith is that the sun, in its entire orbit, remains in the state of prostration before Allah under the <em>‘arsh</em>, that is, it moves under His permission and command. And this cycle will stay activated right through the proximity of the last Day of Resurrection until comes the time for the emergence of the sign that the Day of Resurrection is very close. When this happens, the sun will, rather than start its next orbit, be commanded to turn back &#8211; and then, it will rise from the west. At that time, the door of repentance will be closed and no declaration of faith or repentance from anyone shall remain acceptable at that hour.</p>
<p>In short, this particularity of the setting of the sun, its passing under the <em>‘arsh</em>, the making of prostration there and the incidence of seeking permission for the next orbit mentioned in the narration being studied is simply a similitude in consonance with the mores of effective prophetic teaching and in terms of common perception. Neither does it make it necessary that it performs prostration<em> (sajdah)</em> on some land surface like a human being, nor does it make it necessary that there be some pause in the movement of the sun at the time of making a prostration, nor does it mean that it goes to some particular place doing only one prostration during a day and night, and nor that it goes beneath the <em>‘arsh</em> after setting only. <strong>But, at this time of great alternation, when people are seeing that the sun is receding away from them, what has been done is that they have been appraised of the truth of what is happening in the manner of a similitude while the reality is that this whole thing is happening because of the sun moving beneath the <em>‘arsh</em> in subservience to the Divine command &#8211; the sun does not have any capability or power of its own.</strong> So, the way, at this time, the people of Madinah were convinced that the sun would now make its prostration and seek permission for the next orbit, similarly, the message was relayed onwards to every place where the sun would be setting and everyone there would stand advised of the lesson thereof.</p>
<p>Thus, the truth of the matter turns out to be that the sun at every moment while moving on its orbit keeps offering prostration before Allah the Almighty and keeps seeking permission to move ahead &#8211; and <strong>it needs no pause or break to make prostration or seek permission.<em> </em></strong>Following this submission, there remains no doubt concerning the Hadith quoted, neither in terms of observations, nor in terms of the rules of astronomy.</p>
<p>(See, Maariful Qur’an, English Translation by Muhammad Shamim, vol.6 pp.388-395)</p>
<p>One may say that the hadith suggests it is the sun that revolves around the Earth and not the other way round.</p>
<p>As stressed above, one must remember that the prophets do not come to teach astronomy. Their sole aim is to make people understand that everything in the universe obeys Allah and so should the humans. For this reason they allude to how humans perceive the things and it actually does appear that sun moves across the horizon. Had the Prophet –peace and blessings of Allah be upon him- through divine guidance made the point in a way that could not be comprehended by his immediate listeners, it would have killed the purpose of it, because their guidance and instruction into righteousness was certainly the sole way message could reach us in this age. Looking back, we can now easily understand the proverbial sense of it and appreciate it, but it wouldn’t have been anyway possible for the people in the seventh century to look ahead into the future. For us the message remains as great and relevant as ever because even though we have the knowledge that it is rather the Earth that revolves around sun, we know the grand design and the fine-tuning of the whole celestial system including the sun is such that it speaks of an Ultimate Power which is obeyed by the whole Universe. And this is what the essence of the message is.</p>
<p>(See, Abu Al-A’la Maududi, <em>Rasail wa Masail</em>, Islamic Publications, Lahore, 2000 pp.21-22)</p>
<p><strong>Further elucidation</strong>:</p>
<p>The following two verses are also about the topic at hand;</p>
<p><strong>“The seven heavens and the earth and whatever is in them exalt Him. And there is not a thing except that it exalts [Allah] by His praise, but you do not understand their [way of] exalting. Indeed, He is ever Forbearing and Forgiving.”</strong> (Qur’an 17:44)</p>
<p><strong>“Do you not see that to Allah prostrates whoever is in the heavens and whoever is on the earth and the sun, the moon, the stars, the mountains, the trees, the moving creatures and many of the people?” </strong>(Qur’an 22:18)</p>
<p>Maulana Daryabadi in his commentary note to Qur’an 22:18 reproduces what Edward William Lane’s quotes with reference to Lisan al-‘Arab, the well known and voluminous Arabic lexicon;</p>
<p><strong>“The primary significance of</strong> السجود <strong>is</strong> تذلل<strong> … The</strong> سجود <strong>of inanimate things to God, we understand, in the Qur’an as denoting as obedience to that whereto they are made subservient.”</strong> (Tafsir-ul-Quran- Translation and Commentary of the Holy Qur’an by Abdul Majid Daryabadi, Academy of Islamic Research and Publications, Lucknow, 2007 vol.3 pp.178)</p>
<p>Shah Wali Ullah (d. 1176 A.H./1762 C.E.) sums up the essence of the whole issue beautifully;</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;In their conduct (the prophets) did not occupy themselves with what had no relevance for refining the soul and the governing of the community. They did not explain the events of the atmosphere like rain, eclipses, rings around the sun or moon, the wonders of plants and animals, <em>the measurement of the paths of the sun and moon</em>, the causes of daily events, and the stories of the prophets, kings, countries and so on, unless they used simple words with which their audience was familiar, and that their minds would accept if these were used to remind them of the blessings of God and the requital of God, unless this was by way of digression into a general discussion which is permitted in cases like this, through <em>introducing metaphors and similes.</em> This was basically the case when they asked the Prophet about the reasons for the waxing and waning of the moon, and God the Exalted turned from that to the explanation of the benefits of that waning and waxing, and said, &#8220;They ask you about the new moons, say they are times appointed for the people and the pilgrimages.&#8221; </strong>(Qur&#8217;an 2:189)<strong> You may see many people whose taste is corrupted because of familiarity with these (technical) fields, or due to other causes, so that <em>they apply the words of the prophets to things to which they did not refer,</em> and God knows better.&#8221;</strong> (Hujjat Allah al-Baligha- The Conclusive Argument from God, Translated by Marcia K. Hermansen, Islamic Research Institute, Islamabad, 2003 p.256)</p>
<p><strong><em>LET ME TURN THE TABLES</em></strong></p>
<p>While Christians missionaries are hell bent on finding issues with such hadith narrations, what they often forget is that the scripture they consider “holy” is not only riddled top class absurdities but also such classical expressions of the kind they take exception to when it comes to Islamic sources.</p>
<p>The following is from the Bible:</p>
<p><strong>“The sun rises and the sun sets, and <em>hurries back to where it rises</em>.” </strong>(Ecclesiastes 1:5)</p>
<p>The readers should wait for explanation to this verse which does not show the cunning approach and double standards of these anti-Islamic polemicists – the Rivals of the Truth.</p>
<p><strong>Indeed Allah knows the best!</strong></p>

<h1>Eight rebuttal: The prostration of the sun before its Lord</h1>
<h3>Question</h3>
<h5><strong>Assalaamu ‘Alaykum Warahmatullaahi Wabarakaatuh, Please explain these Ahadith and the meaning of the sun setting in a spring of water. Yazid bin Harun- Sufyan bin Husain- Al-Hakam bin ‘Utaybah- Ibrahim (b. Yazid al-Taymi)- Yazid al-Taymi- Abu Dharr said: I was sitting behind the Apostle of Allah who was riding a donkey while the sun was setting. He asked: Do you know where this sets? I replied: Allah and his Apostle know best. He said: It sets in a spring of warm water. (Sunan Abu Dawud, Hadith 3991) Abu Dharr narrated, “Once I was with the Prophet riding a donkey on which there was a saddle or a (piece of) velvet. That was at sunset. He said to me, ‘O Abu Dharr, do you know where this (sun) sets?’ I said, ‘Allah  and His Messenger know better.’ He said, ‘It sets in a spring of murky water, (then) it goes and prostrates before its Lord, the Exalted in Might and the Ever-Majestic, under the Throne. And when it is time to go out, Allah allows it to go out and thus it rises. But, when He wants to make it rise where it sets, He locks it up. The sun will then say, “O my Lord, I have a long distance to run.” Allah will say, “Rise where you have set.” That (will take place) when no (disbelieving) soul will get any good by believing then.’” (Musnad Ahmad, Hadith 21459 al-Risala ed.) Sahih in chain (Al Albani) Jazaakallaahu khayran</strong></h5>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>All perfect praise be to Allaah, The Lord of the Worlds. I testify that there is none worthy of worship<br />
except Allaah, and that Muhammad  <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="24" height="24" class="wp-image-7980" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-www-islamweb-net-ver2-archive-images-icon-.gif" alt="http://www.islamweb.net/ver2/Archive/images/icon--1.gif" /> , is His slave and messenger.</p>
<p>These two Ahaadeeth include two points:</p>
<p>The first point: The setting of the sun in a spring of black muddy water (or a spring of hot water). Before talking about the meaning of this statement, we must establish a fact that the sun does not set at a specific tangible place; rather, it sets in a specific direction which is what has been defined by the people by the term: the west. When the sun sets in relation to some people, it rises upon some other people and so on. This indicates that what is meant is not the literal meaning of the Hadeeth.</p>
<p>In his interpretation of the story of Thul-Qarnayn, and the verse in which Allaah says (what means): {Until, when he reached the setting of the sun, he found it [as if] setting in a spring of dark mud,…} [Quran 18:86], Al-Qurtubi  <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="30" height="19" class="wp-image-7981" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/may-allaah-have-mercy-upon-him.gif" alt=" may  Allaah  have  mercy  upon  him" />  quoted Al-Qaffaal as saying: “Some scholars said: what is meant is not that Thul-Qarnayn reached the west where the sun itself sets or the east where the sun itself rises, because it revolves in the sky around the earth without touching the earth. The sun is much bigger than the earth, so how can it enter at a place of the places of the earth? Rather, what is meant is that he reached the farthest point of the west, and the farthest point of the east, and he found it, according to what the eye can see, as if it sets in a spring of black muddy water, in the same manner that we see it in the desert as if it enters into the inside of the earth.” [End of quote] This means in relation to how the eye sees it.”</p>
<p>The second point: Its prostration under the Throne. This was interpreted by the scholars in many ways. For instance, Ibn Hajar  <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="30" height="19" class="wp-image-7982" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/may-allaah-have-mercy-upon-him-1.gif" alt=" may  Allaah  have  mercy  upon  him" />  said: “It is likely that what is meant by prostration is the prostration of the angels that are in charge of it, or that it itself prostrates, which means showing more submission and humility at that time.”</p>
<p>The most preponderant opinion is that it is a real prostration and we do not know how it is done. Shaykh Muhammad Saalih Al-Munajjid said: “Its prostration is real in a manner befitting the sun, but how does it fall prostrate before Allaah under the Throne? Only Allaah knows how this prostration takes place. The apparent meaning of the Hadeeth does not suggest that prostration refers to mere submission to the order of Allaah and being subjugated to His Obedience. Rather, it is submission, humiliation and compliance with a real prostration but we do not know how it is done. The same thing is said about the moon, trees, animals and all other beings, as each of them has its own manner of prostration that suits it. Therefore, a Muslim should not let his ignorance of how all these creations prostrate prevent him from believing in what Allaah informed us about the prostration of created beings to Him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Allaah Knows best.</p>

<h1>Ninth rebuttal: And the Sun runs on to its place of settlement&#8230;</h1>
<p>Allah says: “And the Sun runs on to its place of settlement. That is the determination of the Mighty the Knowing.” [<em>Sûrah YâSîn</em>: 38]
<p>What does it mean that the “Sun runs on to its place of settlement?” When is this? How is this?</p>
<p>Abû Dharr al-Ghifârî, one of the Prophet Muhammad’s Companions, relates the following:</p>
<p>The Prophet (peace be upon him) said to me: “O Abû Dharr! Do you know where the Sun goes when it sets?”</p>
<p>I said: “Allah and His Messenger know best.”</p>
<p>He said: “It goes until it prostrates beneath the Throne. Then it seeks permission and permission is granted to it. Soon it will prostrate and it will not be accepted from it, and seek permission and will not be granted permission. It will be said to it: ‘Go back where you came from.’ Then it will rise from its setting place. This is Allah’s statement: ‘And the Sun runs on to its place of settlement. That is the determination of the Mighty the Knowing. [<em>Sûrah YâSîn</em>: 38]’.” [<em>Sahîh al-Bukhârî</em> (3199, 7424)]
<p>It is also found in. Its text, as related by Abû Dharr al-Ghifârî, is as follows:</p>
<p>The Prophet (peace be upon him) said one day: “Do you know where the Sun goes when it sets?”</p>
<p>They said: “Allah and His Messenger know best.”</p>
<p>He said: “It goes until it arrives at its place of settlement beneath the Throne. Then it falls down in prostration and remains like that until it is said to it: ‘Arise! Go back from whence you came.’ Then it goes back and rises from its place of rising. Then it goes until it arrives at its place of settlement beneath the Throne. Then it falls down in prostration and remains like that until it is said to it: ‘Arise! Go back from whence you came.’ Then it goes back and rises from its place of rising. Then it goes without people finding anything wrong with it until it arrives at that place of settlement it has beneath the throne. Then it will be told: ‘Arise! Enter upon the morning rising from your setting place’.”</p>
<p>Then Allah’s Messenger (peace be upon him) said: “Do you know when that will be? It will be when ‘its faith will not avail a soul which had not believed before or earned some good from its faith. [<em>Sûrah al-An`âm</em>: 157]’.” [<em>Sahîh Muslim</em> (159,205) ]
<p>The hadîth is also found in <em>Sahîh al-Bukhârî</em> in a highly abridged form (4803, 7433). Its text reads:</p>
<p>I asked the Prophet (peace be upon him) about Allah’s statement: “And the Sun runs on to its place of settlement&#8230; [<em>Sûrah YâSîn</em>: 38]”.</p>
<p>He said: “Its place of settlement is beneath the throne.”</p>
<p>Ibn Hajar al-`Asqalânî, in <em>Fath al-Bârî</em>, his commentary on <em>Sahîh al-Bukhârî</em>, writes:</p>
<p>This was how Wakî` related it from al-A`mash in an abbreviated form. It is a narration by meaning. In the previous narration of the hadîth, the Prophet (peace be upon him) asked Abû Dharr: “Do you know where the Sun goes when it sets?” [<em>Fath al-Bârî</em>(8/688)]
<p><strong>What about the fact that the Earth goes around the Sun?</strong></p>
<p>Some people have wondered how these texts should be understood in relation to the Earth&#8217;s movement around the Sun and the fact that sunrise and sunset are a consequence of the Earth revolving around its axis. What they fail to realize is that these texts talk about the Sun&#8217;s relationship to the Throne of Allah, not its relationship to the Earth.</p>
<p>The first point that we need to consider is that nowhere in any of these texts is it mentioned that the Sun is revolving around the Earth. The word used for the Sun’s motion in all of these texts is the verb “<em>tajrî</em>” meaning “to go, flow, proceed”. This verb is not qualified by any other words indicating a spherical motion of any kind or any specific type of motion relative to the Earth.</p>
<p>The second point that we must consider is that nowhere does the hadîth discuss the mechanics of the Sun’s motion in any way. Likewise, it says nothing about the mechanics of the motions of the Sun and the Earth on that fateful day when the Sun will rise from the West.</p>
<p>Thirdly, the place of settlement mentioned in the hadîth is beneath the throne and not under the Earth.</p>
<p>What we know scientifically about the Sun is that it is indeed in motion. It is traveling around the center of the galaxy at roughly 220 km/s in an orbit that takes about 230 million years to complete.</p>
<p>It may be interesting to take note of the fact that the Qur’ân mentions an orbital motion for the Sun. Allah says: “It is not for the Sun to overtake the Moon, nor does the night outstrip the day. They float each in an orbit.” [<em>Sûrah YâSîn</em>: 40]
<p>However, we must caution that the verse says nothing about the nature or placement of the Sun’s orbit. It states only that the Sun has one.</p>
<p>As for the Sun’s relationship to the Throne, which is what the hadîth is discussing, this is something that we cannot speculate about. The Throne is part of the Unseen and we know nothing about it except what Allah and His Messenger tell us about it. It follows that the Sun’s behavior in relationship to the throne, both spatially and temporally, is also a matter of the Unseen.</p>
<p>We must believe whatever Allah and His Messenger inform us about the Sun&#8217;s relationship to Allah&#8217;s Throne and not speculate any further on the subject.</p>
<p>We can, therefore, safely conclude that these texts are not taking about the Sun’s relationship to the Earth at all. They certainly do not indicate that the Sun orbits the Earth.</p>

<h1>Tenth rebuttal: Misunderstanding of a verse of the Quran and hadith regarding the sun and moon</h1>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: As-Salamu ‘Alaykum wa Rahmatullahi wa Barakatuh:</p>
<p>And He has made the sun and the moon, both constantly pursuing their courses, to be of service to you; and He has made the night and the day, to be of service to you. ( سورة إبراهيم , Ibrahim, Chapter #14, Verse #33) Qur’an.</p>
<p>Narrated Abu Dharr: Once I was with the Prophet in the mosque at the time of Sunset. The Prophet said, “O Abu Dharr! Do you know where the Sun sets?” I replied, “Allah and His Apostle know best.” He said, “It goes and prostrates underneath (Allah’s) Throne; and that is Allah’s Statement:– ‘And the Sun runs on its fixed course for a term (decreed). And that is the decree of All-Mighty, the All-Knowing….’ (36.38) (Book #60, Hadith #326) Bukhari.</p>
<p>It seems that in both the Qur’an and Hadith the Sun is being said to move around the Earth. This seems unscientific because we know that the Earth revolves around the Sun. Why is the sun being said to do the motion around the earth? Was-Salamu ‘Alaykum wa Rahmatullahi wa Barakatuh.</p>
<p>Country: USA</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>Wa alaykum salam wa rahmatuLlahi wa barakatuHu,</p>
<p>Regarding the first verse:</p>
<p>وَسَخَّرَ لَكُمُ الشَّمْسَ وَالْقَمَرَ دَائِبَيْنِ ۖ وَسَخَّرَ لَكُمُ اللَّيْلَ وَالنَّهَارَ</p>
<p>Arabic dictionaries mention that the word الدائبان ad-daa’ibaan means day and night. While the word’s trilateral root preserves other meanings too, like persistence, habitually. (Lisan al-Arab v. 16, p. 1310) Wherefore, according to the Quran expert of the Sahabah, Abd Allah b. Abbas, it implies, “Their untiring persistence in obedience to Allah.” (Tafsir al-Baghawi v. 4, p. 353) The main lexical reference works do not describe the word to denote one thing orbiting another.</p>
<p>Allah is telling us that, day in and day out, the sun and the moon provide us with a “service” that is indubitably in our best interests. Many services we probably have not even realized, but just the moon’s influence on the tides and the sun’s influence on maintaining a gravitational central force for the earth’s solar system keep a balance and harmony, only possible with Allah’s will and power. It seems like Allah is calling our attention to one of the many blessings that He bestows on us all, that He subjugated the sun and moon that they continually function thereby favoring us with the blessing and sustenance of day and night. Allah continues in the 34th verse of Surah Ibrahim, “And He gave you all that you asked Him for, if you try to enumerate Allah’s blessings, you will not be able to enumerate them…”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regarding the hadith, it is in Sahih al-Bukhari v. 2, p. 382 #3199. This text does not contain explicit mention that the sun orbits the earth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The hadith mentions the sun prostrating beneath the Arsh. To this detail, many ulama, for instance Khattabi as related by Hafiz Zayn al-Din al-‘Iraqi in Tarh al-Tathrib v. 8, p. 259, maintained that this is from the knowledge of the unseen, and thus we accept it, while knowledge of it is only with Allah. Therefore, we accept the hadith just as it is, while much of its meaning is beyond the scope of our understanding.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In both the 37th and 38th verses of Surah Yasin, Allah draws one’s attention again to the day and night, “And a sign for them is the night; it removes by it the day, so then they are in darkness (37) along with the sun proceeding on its fixed course (38)…” In Mafatih al-Ghayb v. 26, p. 62-63, al-Fakhr al-Razi discussed that the particle lam may indicate time. The sun is proceeding on its course, both in respect to each day, from its rising to its setting. Likewise, in respect to how we observe the sun’s fixity in movement during the yearly cycle, from one month to the next. By this all, it proceeds to a fixed time, the Final Hour, the Day of Judgment. Allah says in the 13th verse of Surah Fatir, “He merges the night into day, and merges the day into night, and subjugates the sun and the moon, all proceeding on to an appointed time.” The major books of tafsir consider the phrase in this verse لأجل مسمى to be the end of the world and the coming of the Last Hour.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Allah has given many blessings to us; He has given us the days of our lives, minute by minute, hour by hour, day by day, to get ready for when these fleeting worldly moments end. The Quran shows us in so many places how temporary things really are. At times, we are reminded of this very straightforwardly. Additionally, we are given examples from the world around us to sit and ponder upon. If something awe-inspiring like the sun is counting down to its last, then what about us?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Allah continues in Surah Yasin, “And the trumpet will again be blown and they will come quickly from their graves to their Lord. (51) They will say, ‘Woe is to us! Who raised us from our resting places!?’ [It will be said to them], ‘This is what the Merciful promised, and the Messengers spoke the truth.’ (52) It will be only a single shout, behold they shall all be brought before Us! (53) This Day, none shall be wronged in anything, nor will you be requited except in what you used to do. (54)” Truly, Allah is great.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This article is a response to the critics who misquote the following Hadith</p>
<p>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: The things which annual prayer were mentioned before me (and those were): a dog, a donkey and a woman. I said, &#8220;You have compared us (women) to donkeys and dogs. By Allah! I saw the Prophet praying while I used to lie in (my) bed between him and the Qibla. Whenever I was in need of something, I disliked to sit and trouble the Prophet. So, I would slip away by the side of his feet.&#8221;</p>

<h3><a name="first-rebuttal"></a>Does Islam consider women like donkeys and dogs?</h3>
<p align="justify">http://www.letmeturnthetables.com/2008/08/does-islam-consider-women-like-donkeys.html</p>
<p align="justify">It has been observed that many anti-Islamic sites are misquoting a Hadith and polluting the innocent minds about the noble faith of Islam.The translation of the Hadith goes as;</p>
<p>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: <strong>The things which annul prayer were mentioned before me (and those were): a dog, a donkey and a woman. I said, &#8220;You have compared us (women) to donkeys and dogs. By Allah! I saw the Prophet praying while I used to lie in (my) bed between him and the Qibla. Whenever I was in need of something, I disliked to sit and trouble the Prophet. So, I would slip away by the side of his feet.&#8221;</strong> (Sahih Bukhari, Hadith 484)</p>
<div align="justify">
<p>They argue that as here woman, dogs &amp; donkeys are mentioned together so this is a degradation of women.<br />
<span style="color:#000000;"><br />
</span><strong><u>The notion is refuted in the very same tradition</u>:</strong></p>
<p>Infact if one is in his senses than the very text of the Hadith shows that its not Islam that-God Forbid!!- considers women as donkeys or dogs but it was the understanding of certain people whom Sayyidah Aisha (RA) rebuked. Again read the translation of the Hadith with special attention to the words emphasized.</p>
<p>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: The things which annul prayers were mentioned before me (and those were): a dog, a donkey and a woman. I said, &#8220;<strong>You have compared us (women) to donkeys and dogs. By Allah! I saw the Prophet praying while I used to lie in (my) bed between him and the Qibla.</strong> Whenever I was in need of something, I disliked to sit and trouble the Prophet. So, I would slip away by the side of his feet.&#8221;(Bukhari , Hadith 484)</p>
<p>It’s plain enough that some people mentioned the things which, according to their understanding, annulled prayers and they mentioned &#8220;dog, donkey &amp; woman&#8221;.But then Sayyidah Aisha (RA) rebuked them by saying &#8220;You have compared us (women) to donkeys and dogs&#8221; and then she clarifies that this not something taught by the Messenger of ALLAH (pbuh) as, she said; &#8220;By Allah! I saw the Prophet praying while I used to lie in (my) bed between him and the Qibla.&#8221;So where is the confusion? The problem is the same that I often mention that these missionaries, these devil incarnates yell such obscenities only in an attempt to get rid of their frustration that they have when they see Islam as the fastest growing religion of the world.</p>
<p><strong><u>Other Hadith and meaning of the ‘annulment of Salah’</u>:</strong></p>
<p>Now some people may bring some more Ahadith from the Holy Prophet (PBUH) himself like the following;</p>
<p>Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas: Ikrimah reported on the authority of Ibn Abbas, saying: I think the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: <strong>&#8220;When one of you prays without a sutrah, a dog, an ass, a pig, a Jew, a Magian, and a woman cut off his prayer, but it will suffice if they pass in front of him at a distance of over a stone&#8217;s throw.&#8221; </strong>(Abu Dawud, Hadith 703. Albani classified it as Da’if)</p>
<p>Abu Huraira reported: The Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) said: &#8220;<strong>A woman, an ass and a dog disrupt the prayer, but something like the back of a saddle guards against that.&#8221; </strong>(Muslim, Hadith 790)</p>
<p>But even these Ahadith never mean that these things annul the prayers, it only means that they can divert ones attention, they disrupt the prayers.</p>
<p>Imam Nawawi, a famous Scholar writes in his commentary to this hadith from Sahih Muslim;</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Here disruption only means to have a negative effect on the prayers by the way of occupation of heart in these things.&#8221;</strong> (Sharah Al-Nawawi 2/266).</p>
<p>All these things mentioned here can disrupt one&#8217;s attention. A Jew because of his particular appearance and the fact that they were having a row with Muslims then, seeing an adversary can obviously distract one&#8217;s attention. A pig or an ass can become a source of distraction because of their course and loud voice and bad smell, a Magian because of his unusual appearance (see from the point of view of Arabs then). And a woman could distract because of her beauty while prayers need full time attention.This is enough to prove that it’s only about being a cause of distraction that women are mentioned with all these things. It’s not that-God Forbid!-some parallel is drawn here.</p>
<p><strong><u>Its not to degrade woman. Read the following!</u></strong></p>
<p>Now its not degradation for the females but only the truth is mentioned that if a woman passes in front of a man, this can get his attention diverted and that will effect the quality &amp; sincerity of ones prayers. It never means that, God-Forbid, a parallel is being drawn between woman and other things mentioned. These are mentioned together only because they can divert ones attention.See its just as if a person says; <strong>&#8220;Humans, dogs &amp; donkeys are all living beings&#8221;</strong>, this does not mean that humans are considered equal or same as dogs &amp; donkeys or some parallel is being drawn between all these. Or does it?</p>
<p><strong><u>It’s about mature women only</u>:<br />
</strong><br />
And this is said for the grown up women only not small kids for they cannot divert ones attention in that sense.</p>
<p>Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas: Qatadah said: I heard Jabir ibn Zayd who reported on the authority of Ibn Abbas; and Shu&#8217;bah reported the Prophet (peace be upon him) as saying:<strong> &#8220;A menstruating (i.e. grown up) woman and a dog cut off the prayer.&#8221;</strong> (Abu Dawud, Hadith 704. Albani classified it as Sahih)</p>
<p><strong><u>Nothing annuls Salah as such</u>:</strong></p>
<p>Nothing annuls the Salah as such but these things can disrupt ones attention. Read the following Hadith;</p>
<p>Narrated Ayyash bin Abu Rabiya:<strong>The Prophet (pbuh) said: “Nothing annuls prayers.”</strong> (Sunan Darqutni, Hadith 1396. Ibn Hujr classified ir as <em>Hasan</em> in al-Diraya 1/178)</p>
<p>In the end I&#8217;ll only repeat a statement of Sayyidah Aisha (RA) from the very Hadith the heathen bring forward; <strong>&#8220;By Allah! I saw the Prophet praying while I used to lie in (my) bed between him and the Qibla.&#8221;<br />
</strong><br />
Hope all this will help understand!</p>
<p><strong>INDEED ALLAH KNOWS THE BEST!</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Abu Dharr reported: <strong>THE MESSENGER OF &#8216;ALLAH (may peace be upon him) SAID</strong>: When any one of you stands for prayer and there is a thing before him equal to the back of the saddle that covers him and in case there is not before him (a thing) equal to the back of the saddle, <strong>HIS PRAYER WOULD BE CUT OFF BY (passing of an) ASS, WOMAN, AND BLACK DOG</strong>. I said: O Abu Dharr, what feature is there in a black dog which distinguish it from the red dog and the yellow dog? He said: O, son of my brother, I asked the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) as you are asking me, and he said: The black dog is a devil. (Sahih Muslim, Book 004, <a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/muslim/004.smt.html#004.1032" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Number 1032<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>)</em><br />
<strong>Response: </strong></p>
<p>The translation given is practically unreadable, so I am translating it again:</p>
<p>Abd Allah ibn al-Samit said: Abu Dharr said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger &#8212; Allah bless and salute him! &#8212; said:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;When one of you stands in prayer, what definitely constitutes a barrier for him is an object placed in front of him of the same height as the back of a camel-saddle. If it is not in front of him and of the same height as the back of a camel-saddle, then some [stray] donkey, or some woman passing, or some black dog will cut off his prayer.&#8221; I said: &#8220;O Abu Dharr! What is it that makes a black dog different from a red or yellow dog?&#8221; He replied: &#8220;O dear cousin! I asked Allah&#8217;s Messenger &#8212; Allah bless and salute him! &#8212; the exact same question. He said that the black dog is a devil.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><strong><u>Notes on the legal rulings based on this hadith and its meaning:</u></strong></p>
<p>The passing of the above-mentioned in front of the person at prayer does not invalidate his prayer according to the vast majority of the Imams of Law, Salaf and Khalaf (early and late authorities) who concur that the meaning of &#8220;will cut off his prayer&#8221; <strong>is not literal but means: &#8220;will make his prayer imperfect&#8221; due to the distraction they will cause in people&#8217;s hearts</strong>, <strong>while Imam Ahmad considered that only the passing of a black dog actually invalidates it.</strong><strong>This was mentioned by </strong><u>Imam al-Nawawi in Sharh Sahih Muslim and al-Mubarakfuri in Tuhfa al-Ahwadhi.</u></p>
<p>In other words the hadith does not view women as impure or equal to animals, thats nonsense, what the hadith ment is that women who pass by in front of a praying person , can distract that person during his prayer (which would make his prayer imperfect) , just like a dogg will distract his prayer. It’s like beauty and the beast, the beauty can distract his attention (due to it’s beauty) and the beast can distract his attention (due to it’s smell or sound/wildness etc) .</p>
<p><em>Abu Huraira reported: <strong>THE MESSENGER OF ALLAH (may peace be upon him) SAID: A WOMAN, AN ASS AND A DOG DISRUPT THE PRAYER</strong>, but something like the back of a saddle guards against that. (Sahih Muslim, Book 004, <a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/muslim/004.smt.html#004.1034" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Number 1034<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>)</em></p>
<p><em>&#8216;Urwa b. Zubair reported: &#8216;A&#8217;isha asked: What disrupts the prayer? We said: <strong>THE WOMAN AND THE ASS</strong>. Upon this she remarked: <strong>IS THE WOMAN AN UGLY ANIMAL?</strong> I lay in front of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) like the bier of a corpse and he said prayer. (Sahih Muslim, Book 004, <a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/muslim/004.smt.html#004.1037" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Number 1037<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>)</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Response: </strong></p>
<p>Again the hadith doesn’t say ‘nullify’ but ‘disrupt’ which in the other hadith quoted before is explained as ‘will cut off his prayer’ , which means ‘<strong>&#8220;will make his prayer imperfect&#8221; due to the distraction they will cause in people’s hearts</strong>.</p>
<p>The second hadith about Aicha’s reaction will be explained later in my conclusion by sheikh g.f. haddad.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Interestingly, Urwa ibn Zubair was Aisha’s nephew!</em></p>
<p><em>Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:<br />
Qatadah said: I heard Jabir ibn Zayd who reported on the authority of Ibn Abbas; and Shu&#8217;bah reported the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) as saying: <strong>A menstruating woman and a dog cut off the prayer</strong>. (Sunan Abu Dawud, Book 2, <a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/abudawud/002.sat.html#002.0703" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Number 0703<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>)</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Response:</strong></p>
<p>This hadith shows that there is no difference between a menstruating or menstruating women, both can disrupt person his prayer, since it all had to do with distraction (see Imam nawawi’s sharch sahih muslim) in these hadith. The reason why this hadith uses the word ‘menstruating’ women is because women are not allowed to pray during menstruation and therefor the women that would pass by in front of the praying men (during their 5 times a day obligated prayer) were menstruating women, thats why the prophet said ‘a menstruating women’. The fact that other hadith narrations don’t use the word ‘menstruation’ proof that the hadith in question all has to do with things that can distract a person during his prayer. The menstruation itself has nothing to do with the issue of distraction during prayer, since the prophet (saw) himself prayed while his menstruating wife aicha (ra) was laying in bed in front him, and secondly since the prophet (saw) recited the quran while his menstruating wife aicha was close to him. The prophet (saw) also touched the clothes of his menstruating wife Maimuna during prayer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Narrated Aisha, Ummul Mu&#8217;minin: <strong><em>I was sleeping in front of the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) with my legs between him and the qiblah. Shu&#8217;bah said: I think she said: I was menstruating. </em></strong><u>( Sunan Abu Dawud Book 2, Number 0710 )</u></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Narrated Maimuna: <strong><em>(the wife of the Prophet) <u>During my menses</u>, I never prayed, but used to sit on the mat beside the mosque of Allah&#8217;s Apostle. He used to offer the prayer on his sheet and in prostration some of his clothes <u>used to touch me</u>.&#8221;</em></strong> ((<u>Sahih Bukhari Volume 1, Book 6, Number 329) </u></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Narrated &#8216;Aisha:  <strong><em>&#8220;The Prophet used to recite the Quran with his head in my lap while I used to be in my periods (having menses).</em></strong><u>(Translation of Sahih Bukhari, ONENESS, UNIQUENESS OF ALLAH (TAWHEED), Volume 9, Book 93, Number 639)&#8221;</u></p>
<p>Aisha reported:  &#8220;<strong><em>The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) would recline in my lap when I was menstruating, and recite the Qur&#8217;an.</em></strong><u>(Translation of Sahih Muslim, The Book of Menstruation (Kitab Al-Haid), Book 003, Number 0591)&#8221;</u></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em>Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:<br />
Ikrimah reported on the authority of Ibn Abbas, saying: I think the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) said: When one of you prays without a sutrah, <strong>A DOG, AN ASS, A PIG, A JEW, A MAGIAN, AND A WOMAN CUT OFF HIS PRAYER</strong>, but it will suffice if they pass in front of him at a distance of over a stone&#8217;s throw. (Sunan Abu Dawud, Book 2, <a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/abudawud/002.sat.html#002.0704" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Number 0704<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>)</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Response:</strong></p>
<p>All these things clearly proof that it all has to do with distraction (things that mostly would distract a man during prayer) and nothing else. The thins mentioned by the prophet (saw) in this hadith <u>could mostly </u>distract a person during prayer <em>(women are mentioned, because a menstruating women does not have to pray, and therefor most likely would pass by in front of a man during prayer, since all persons are obligated to pray, except the menstruating women)</em> . A jew could distract a muslim during praying due to his typical outstanding jewish look (the long white beards/jewisch clothes etc. ) , also many jews and muslims were rivals back then (due to wars etc.) , seeing ones rival could off course distract oneself during prayer. The pig could distract the praying person due to its bad smell and loud sound, the magian could distract the praying person due to his outstanding look, the women could distract a person due to their beauty (while he should be 100% with his mind to Allah swt during prayer instead of women or other things) , in other words all these thoughts ‘<strong>&#8220;will make his prayer imperfect&#8221; due to the distraction they will cause in people’s hearts</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Conclusion:</u></strong></p>
<p><strong><u> </u></strong></p>
<p>The hadith in question do not compare women at all with animals, secondly the hadith in question talks about things that mostly distract men from prayer, in other words it’s all about distraction and not about menstruation (since the prophet touched the clothes of his menstruating wife during prayer etc) or impurity of animals, this is not the point here. Let us take a final look again at the main hadith, and summarize all:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Abd Allah ibn al-Samit said: Abu Dharr said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger &#8212; Allah bless and salute him! &#8212; said:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;When one of you stands in prayer, what definitely constitutes a barrier for him is an object placed in front of him of the same height as the back of a camel-saddle. If it is not in front of him and of the same height as the back of a camel-saddle, then some [stray] donkey, or some woman passing, or some black dog will cut off his prayer.&#8221; I said: &#8220;O Abu Dharr! What is it that makes a black dog different from a red or yellow dog?&#8221; He replied: &#8220;O dear cousin! I asked Allah&#8217;s Messenger &#8212; Allah bless and salute him! &#8212; the exact same question. He said that the black dog is a devil.&#8221;</em><br />
<strong><u>Notes on the legal rulings based on this hadith and its meaning:</u></strong></p>
<p>The passing of the above-mentioned in front of the person at prayer does not invalidate his prayer according to the vast majority of the Imams of Law, Salaf and Khalaf (early and late authorities) who concur that the meaning of &#8220;will cut off his prayer&#8221; <strong>is not literal but means: &#8220;will make his prayer imperfect&#8221; due to the distraction they will cause in people&#8217;s hearts</strong>, while Imam Ahmad considered that only the passing of a black dog actually invalidates it. This was mentioned by <u>Imam al-Nawawi in Sharh Sahih Muslim and al-Mubarakfuri in Tuhfa al-Ahwadhi.</u></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The renowned sunni scholar Sheikh G.F. haddad Commented on the next hadith:</p>
<p>`A&#8217;isha said: &#8220;<strong><em>Are you [the narrator of that hadith] equating us [women] with dogs and donkeys? It happened to me more than once that I was lying down in bed, and the Prophet &#8212; Allah bless and salute him! &#8212; would come in, the bed being between us, and pray. Disliking to stand up in his face, I would slink down towards the bottom of the bed until I cleared my bedcover</em></strong>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ibn Hajar in Fath al-Bari mentioned that al-Bukhari adduced this hadith to show that the fact that a man at prayer faces a woman does not necessaily distract him.</p>
<p>Among the benefits of `A&#8217;isha&#8217;s narration of the Prophet&#8217;s behavior &#8212; Allah bless and salute him &#8212; are the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>An important elaboration on the general legal rulings inferred from the previous hadith, specifying that distraction is not an inevitable fact for all people. This is confirmed by another narration from `A&#8217;isha in Bukhari states that at other times she would continue to sleep, and that the Prophet &#8212; Allah bless and salute him &#8212; would touch her lightly upon prostrating so that she would withdraw her legs to make way for him, then she would stretch them again when he got up.</li>
<li>The clarification that women are less likely to cause distraction because they can take care to avoid whatever causes it, especially a spouse, as this situation is the likeliest to occur frequently in the life of Muslims.</li>
<li>The teaching that <u>one should not</u> mindlessly equate women with animals in the course of relating this authentic hadith.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>My own note</u></strong>:</p>
<p>In other words it&#8217;s all about distraction (things that can distract a man during prayer, which would make his prayer less perfect) , a beautifull women can distract a man during prayer, just like a stinking ass or wild dogg can distract a man during prayer, this does not mean that women and asses/dogs are viewed equal (which is a redicilous claim) , it&#8217;s beauty and the beast, but both can distract a man during prayer. The fact that women are singled out in the hadith quoed by christian missionaries has to do with the fact , that women more likely can distract a men from prayer , then muslim-men can do to other muslim-men (when a man for example is offering an extra prayer on the street somewhere, cause normally during the 5 obligated prayer-times, all muslims have to pray, except menstruating women or little children) . However every person has it&#8217;s own nature and weakness, some can easily get distracted (even by other muslim-men) during prayer while others not, thats why the general rule is that nobody should pass by a praying person , women <strong>AND MEN.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Sahih Bukhari, Volume 1, Book 9, Number 489:<br />
</u><strong><em>Narrated Busr bin Said: that Zaid bin Khalid sent him to Abi Juhaim to ask him what he had heard from Allah&#8217;s Apostle about a person passing in front of another person who was praying. Abu Juhaim replied, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;<u>If the person who passes in front of another person in prayer knew the magnitude of his sin he would prefer to wait for 40 (days, months or years) rather than to pass in front of him</u>.&#8221; Abu An-Nadr said, &#8220;I do not remember exactly whether he said 40 days, months or years.&#8221; </em></strong></p>
<p>Here the prophet clearly tells us that such a person (could be man or woman) would commit a sin, why would he commit a sin ? Off course because he probably could distract a person during prayer, which could ‘cut off’ that persons prayer (make his prayer less perfect or imperfect) . <strong><u>So both men and women can distract a person during prayer,</u></strong> which would ‘cut off’ / make less perfect ‘ someones prayer. The reason that women are sometimes singled out in a hadith, is because a beautifull women more likely distracts a man from prayer then an ordinary muslim-man and secondly in most cases during the normal 5 times a day obligated prayer, all men have to pray except menstruating women, thats why the prophet pointed out to ‘menstruating women’ in the hadith and not to men, since they are obligated to pray.</p>
<p><u>Sahih Bukhari Volume 1, Book 9, Number 487 &amp; 488:<br />
</u><em><strong>Narrated Abu Salih As-Samman: I saw Abu Said Al-Khudri praying on a Friday, behind something which acted as a Sutra. A young man from Bani Abi Mu&#8217;ait, wanted to pass in front of him, but Abu Said repulsed him with a push on his chest. Finding no alternative he again tried to pass but Abu Said pushed him with a greater force. The young man abused Abu Said and went to Marwan and lodged a complaint against Abu Said and Abu Said followed the young man to Marwan who asked him, &#8220;O Abu Said! What has happened between you and the son of your brother?&#8221; Abu Sa&#8217;id said to him, &#8220;I heard the Prophet saying, <u>&#8216;If anybody</u> amongst you is praying behind something as a Sutra and somebody tries to pass in front of him, then he should repulse him and if he refuses, he should use force against him <u>for he is a satan</u>.&#8217; &#8220;</strong> </em></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><em>Here again we clearly see that a prayer can be distracted by <strong>anybody (men and women) </strong>who passes by in front of the praying person, the prophet clearly said: <strong>anybody ( ALSO MEN ! )</strong> , so again the claim that ‘ women are compared to doggs/asses ‘ is foolishness and not true, since the hadith in question quoted by the christian missionaries only talks about things that can distract a man during prayer, this can also be man. </em></p>
<p>Allah Almighty knows best. Blessings and peace on the best of creation, our Prophet Muhammad, and upon his Family and all his Companions.</p>

<p>http://islamicresponsesatblogger.blogspot.in/2010/09/response-to-suggestion-by-wikiislam.html</p>
<p>WikiIslam attempted to prove that women are considered no better than dogs and donkeys by the Holy Prophet (saw) in the Ahadith by quoting various traditions. I will quote the website here:</p>

<p>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: The things which annul the prayers were mentioned before me. They said, &#8220;Prayer is annulled by a dog, a donkey and a woman (if they pass in front of the praying people).&#8221; I said, &#8220;You have made us (i.e. women) dogs. I saw the Prophet praying while I used to lie in my bed between him and the Qibla.

<p>The following tradition was left out by WikiIslam which proves a point besides the one made above:</p>
<p>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: It is not good that you people have made us (women) equal to dogs and donkeys. No doubt I saw Allah&#8217;s Apostle praying while I used to lie between him and the Qibla and when he wanted to prostrate, he pushed my legs and I withdrew them.  (Book <a href="http://www.searchtruth.com/book_display.php?book=9&amp;translator=1&amp;start=0&amp;number=498" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">#9<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, Hadith <a href="http://www.searchtruth.com/book_display.php?book=9&amp;translator=1&amp;start=0&amp;number=498#498" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">#498<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>)</p>
<p>(Sahih Bukhari)</p>
<p>Either way, the meaning of the above Ahadith has been misconstrued, since Hazrat Ayesha (ra) was explaining that women were not equal to dogs and donkeys, rather it was alright for a woman to be in front of a man when he prayed. Hazrat Ayesha (ra) knew the Prophet better than the people so she corrected their views on the subject of praying without a Sutrah. She lived with him in his own home, while the people only learned about what he did when they saw him on some occasions.</p>
<p>As for the third Hadith about praying without a Sutrah, it is better for someone to not pass in front of another who is praying without a Sutrah since it can be spiritually harmful to that individual:</p>
<p>Abu Sa&#8217;id al-Khudri reported that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: When any one of you prays he should not let anyone pass in front of him (if there is no sutra), and should try to turn him away as far as possible, but if he refuses to go, he should turn him away forcibly for he is a devil.  (Book <a href="http://www.searchtruth.com/book_display.php?book=004&amp;translator=2&amp;start=0&amp;number=1023" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">#004<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, Hadith <a href="http://www.searchtruth.com/book_display.php?book=004&amp;translator=2&amp;start=0&amp;number=1023#1023" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">#1023<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>)</p>
<p>(Sahih Muslim)</p>
<p>The grievousness of passing in front of someone praying is given in the following Hadith:</p>
<p>Busr b Sa&#8217;id reported that Zaid b Khalid al-Juhani sent him to Abu Juhaim in order to ask him what he had heard from the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) with regard to the passer in front of the worshipper. Abu Juhaim reported that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: If anyone who passes in front of a man who is praying knew the responsibility he incurs, he would stand still forty (years) rather than to pass in front of him Abu Nadr said: I do not know whether he said forty days or months or years.  (Book <a href="http://www.searchtruth.com/book_display.php?book=004&amp;translator=2&amp;start=0&amp;number=1027" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">#004<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, Hadith <a href="http://www.searchtruth.com/book_display.php?book=004&amp;translator=2&amp;start=0&amp;number=1027#1027" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">#1027<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>)</p>
<p>(Sahih Muslim)</p>
<p>Thus, the meaning of the above Ahadith are that it is better to not be in front of someone else while they are praying because of the sin one could get from being in front of someone. Hazrat Ayesha slipped away when the Prophet (saw) prayed and he was in front of him because of her courtesy for him and his concentration during his (saw)’s prayers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The article first brings up hadiths trying to prove Muhammad drank wine:<span id="more-741"></span>They said:<br />
“Sahih Muslim: “Drinks, Drinking wine and fermentation”<br />
Narrated by Gaber bin Abdullah:<br />
We were with the messenger of Allah, <acronym title="Peace be upon him">PBUH</acronym> and he asked for a drink. One of his men said: “Oh Messenger of Allah, Can we offer you wine to drink?” He said Yes. He (Gaber) went out looking for the drink and came back with a cup of wine. The messenger (Peace Be Upon him) asked, “Have you covered it with a twig in a transverse manner” He (Gaber) said, “Yes” and he (Muhammad) drank. Sahih Muslim – Hadith #3753<br />
<span id="more-905"></span></p>
<p>Ibn ‘Abbas reported that Nabidh was prepared for Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) in the waterskin, Shu’ba said: It was the night of Monday. He drank it on Monday and on Tuesday up to the afternoon, and If anything was left out of it he gave it to his servant or poured it out. Sahih Muslim 23:4972.”</p>
<p>Reply:<br />
The title of the title the critic has given is an inaccurate translation. An accurate one is:<br />
“COMMAND PERTAINING TO THE COVERING OF VESSELS, AND TIGHTENING (THE MOUTHS) OF WATERSKINS, ETC.” (<b><a class="nex_linkicon broken_link wpel-icon-right" href="http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/muslim/023.smt.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external">Source<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></b>).</p>
<p>It should be borne in mind that the Prophet didn’t drink it when it was fermented. He drank it when it was unfermented. A scholar writing on a related hadith:<br />
<b>عصير العنب الذي لم يصل إلى حد الإسكار</b><br />
“Grape juice, <b>which had not reached the level of causing intoxication</b>.” (<b>Sheikh Abdul ‘Azeez Bin Abdullah Al-Raajhi – Commentary Of Sahih Muslim –<a class="nex_linkicon broken_link wpel-icon-right" href="http://shrajhi.com/?Cat=3&amp;SID=5251" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external">Source<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></b>).</p>
<p>“This gives us an idea of the <b>utmost care which the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) observed in the use of Nabidh</b>. He continued using it <b>until there appeared signs of fermentation in it</b>. He discarded its use much before the time when there could be any possibility of any change in its smell and taste. He, therefore, used it only for two days and a half and in case it had no smell or colour of fermentation in it, he gave it to the servant to drink.” (<b>Commentary Of: <a class="nex_linkicon broken_link wpel-icon-right" href="http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/muslim/023.smt.html#023.4971" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external">Sahih Muslim, Book 23, Number 4971<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> – Abdul Hamid Siddiqi’s Commentary – Dar Al Arabia – Volume 3 – Chapter DCCCXXXVIII – Footnote 2418 – Page 1110</b>).</p>
<p>He also prepared the drink in waterskins, to slow down the process of fermentation:</p>
<p>“The Holy Prophet (may peace up upon him) had been particular about it. He preferred to get his Nabidh prepared in the waterskin, <b>as due to coolness, it takes a longer time to turn intoxicant</b>.” (<b>Commentary Of: <a class="nex_linkicon broken_link wpel-icon-right" href="http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/muslim/023.smt.html#023.4972" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external">Sahih Muslim, Book 23, Number 4972<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> – cited in: Ibid – Footnote 2419 – Page 1110</b>).</p>
<p><a class="nex_linkicon broken_link wpel-icon-right" href="http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/muslim/023.smt.html#023.4943" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external">Sahih Muslim, Book 23, Number 4943:<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a><br />
“‘Uqba b. Huraith said: I heard Ibn ‘Umar saying: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) forbade (the preparation of Nabidh) in a green pitcher (besmeared with pitch), in varnished jar, and in gourd, and he said: <b>Prepare Nabidh in small waterskins</b>.”</p>
<p>“The <b>process of fermentation is very slow in waterskin</b> as compared with varnished vessels, gourd, pumpkin or hollow stump.” (<b>Ibid – Chapter DCCCXXXVI – Footnote 2410 – Page 1105</b>).</p>
<p>“<b>The lower the temperature the slower the process</b>. At a high temperature the alcoholic rapidly passes into the acetous fermentation.” (<b>William Thomas Brande &amp; Alfred Swaine Taylor – Chemistry – Henry C. Lea, 1867 – Page 576</b>).<br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-743" src="http://vedkabhed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/qrgj7k.jpg" alt="qrgj7k" width="412" height="339" /><br />
(<b>Emile Peynaud – Knowing And Making Wine – Wiley-IEEE, 1984 – Page 110</b>).</p>
<p>At 35 degrees, the first 24 hours give 6% alcohol strength. At 10 degrees, the first 24 hours give roughly 2.025% alcohol strength. This is calculated using the formula: 16.2 / 8 = 2.025%. So we see here that the speed of fermentation is very slow at lower temperatures, and waterskins help give &amp; retain cool temperatures. So, the wisdom of preparing Nabidh in waterskins is that it takes less time to become alcohol.</p>
<p>Since it wasn’t even fermented into the state of wine, he never drank wine. Science has established that the negative effects we get from alcohol &amp; wine don’t exist, if the liquid isn’t fermented. The Arabic “nabiz” could mean both fermented and unfermented drink. What this critic has done is translated it as wine, but ignored other narrations which indicate it would be referring to other drinks.<br />
<a class="nex_linkicon broken_link wpel-icon-right" href="http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/muslim/023.smt.html#023.4990" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external">Sahih Muslim, Book 23, Number 4990:<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a><br />
“Jabir reported that a person who was known as Abu Humaid brought for him (the Holy Prophet) <b>a cup of milk</b> from al-Naqi’. Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said to him: Why did you not cover it even with a wood across it?”<br />
Furthermore, Abu Humaid (the eyewitness) himself narrated a hadith in <a class="nex_linkicon broken_link wpel-icon-right" href="http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/muslim/023.smt.html#023.4987" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external">Sahih Muslim, Book 23, Number 4987<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> where it mentions milk. Notice this is referring to the same story. So this is one piece of evidence the Arabic word doesn’t specifically mean wine. Also:</p>
<p><a class="nex_linkicon broken_link wpel-icon-right" href="http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/muslim/023.smt.html#023.4952" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external">Sahih Muslim, Book 23, Number 4952:<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a><br />
“‘Abdullah b. Buraida, on the authority of his father, reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: I had forbidden you from the preparation of Nabidh except in a waterskin. But now you may drink in all vessels, <b>but do not drink what is intoxicant</b>.”</p>
<p>Notice how this narration distinguishes intoxicants with Nabidh, which indicates the Arabic word doesn’t specifically refer to fermented drinks. Moreover, Muhsin Khan in Bukhari translates it in the following narration as:<br />
<a class="nex_linkicon broken_link wpel-icon-right" href="http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/bukhari/059.sbt.html#005.059.654" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external">Sahih Bukhari, Volume 5, Book 59, Number 654:<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a><br />
“I said to Ibn ‘Abbas, “I have an earthenware pot containing Nabidh (i.e. <b>water and dates or grapes</b>) for me, and I drink of it while it is sweet. <b>If I drink much of it and stay with the people for a long time, I get afraid that they may discover it (for I will appear as if I were drunk)</b>. Ibn ‘Abbas said, “A delegation of Abdul Qais came to Allah’s Apostle and he said, “Welcome, O people! Neither will you have disgrace nor will you regret.” They said, “O Allah’s Apostle! There are the Mudar pagans between you and us, so we cannot come to you except in the sacred Months. So please teach us some orders on acting upon which we will enter Paradise. Besides, we will preach that to our people who are behind us.” The Prophet said, “I order you to do four things and forbid you from four things (I order you): To believe in Allah…Do you know what is to believe in Allah? That is to testify that None has the right to be worshipped except Allah: (I order you also to offer prayers perfectly to pay Zakat; and to fast the month of Ramadan and to give the Khumus (i.e. one-fifth of the booty) (for Allah’s Sake). I forbid you from four other things (i.e. the wine that is prepared in) Ad-Dubba, An-Naquir, Az-Hantam and Al-Muzaffat. (See Hadith No. 50 Vol. 1).”</p>
<p>Not only is this another piece of evidence that the word’s meaning isn’t bound to ‘fermented drinks’, but it also shows that the Prophet made sure that the drink he drank did not wasn’t fermented. Moreover:</p>

“Abu Sa’id al-Khudri reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: He who amongst you <b>drinks Nabidh should drink that (prepared either from) grapes alone, or from dates alone, or from unripe dates alone (and not by mixing them with one another)</b>. Isma’il b. Muslim al-‘Abadi reported on the authority of the same chain of transmitters: Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) prohibited us that we should mix dry dates with unripe dates or (mix) grapes with dry dates (and prepare Nabidh). He also said: He who amongst you drinks-the rest of the hadith is the same.”</p>
<p>A narration (<a class="nex_linkicon broken_link wpel-icon-right" href="http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/muslim/023.smt.html#023.4895" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external">Number 4895<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>) of Sahih Muslim says that wine comes from vine and date palms. The above narration informs us that Nabidh can include drinks that aren’t mixed together, which makes it evident that this Arabic word doesn’t only refer to fermented drinks. We also read:</p>
<p>“As far as the scope of prohibition of drinking is concerned, it is <b>not confined to some specific forms of wine</b> <b>because the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him) has extended the scope of Khamr to every intoxicant</b>.” (<b>Prof. Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri – Legal Character Of Islamic Punishments – Minhaj-ul-Quran Publications, 1994 – Page 40</b>).</p>
<p>They said:<br />
“Narrated by Abdullah bin Masoud (May God be pleased with him):<br />
He was with the Messenger of Allah peace be upon him on the night of the jinn when he asked him if he had water. He answered that he had wine in a pot. Mohammed said: Pour me some to do ablution and he did. [The] Prophet peace be upon him [said]: “O Abdullah bin Masood it is a drink and a purifier.” Musnad Ahmad – Hadith #3594.”</p>
<p>Reply:<br />
Based on this narration, they claim the Prophet did ablution with wine. Firstly, is this narration even sahih? It’s not.</p>
<p><b>إسناده ضعيف</b><br />
“Its chain is weak.” (<b>Declared By Sheikh Arna’oot, #3782 – <a class="nex_linkicon wpel-icon-right" href="http://ahlulkahf.files.wordpress.com/2009/04/1-4.doc" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external">Source<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></b>)</p>
<p>“It is da’if.” (<b>Ath-Dhahabi – Tankeeh At-Tahqeeq 1/19</b>).</p>

Moreover, this hadith has been narrated by Ibn Masood, but transmitted via a another chain. However, this chain is weak, because Abu Zaid al-Qurashi is unknown. (<a class="nex_linkicon wpel-icon-right" href="http://www.islamweb.net/hadith/display_hbook.php?bk_no=372&amp;hid=170&amp;pid=455412" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external">Source1<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, <a class="nex_linkicon wpel-icon-right" href="http://www.islamweb.net/hadith/display_hbook.php?bk_no=779&amp;hid=297&amp;pid=505007" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external">Source2<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, <a class="nex_linkicon wpel-icon-right" href="http://www.islamweb.net/hadith/display_hbook.php?bk_no=673&amp;hid=26&amp;pid=" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external">Source3<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, <a class="nex_linkicon wpel-icon-right" href="http://www.islamweb.net/hadith/display_hbook.php?bk_no=60&amp;hid=668&amp;pid=350887" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external">Source4<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>).</p>
<p>Additionally, commenting on Abu Zaid, Sheikh Albani writes:</p>
<p><b>أبو زيد رجل مجهول عند أهل الحديث لا يعرف له رواية غير هذا الحديث</b><br />
“Abu Zaid is an unknown man, and scholars of hadith don’t know his details from hadiths.” (<b><a class="nex_linkicon broken_link wpel-icon-right" href="http://islamport.com/d/1/mtn/1/54/1987.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external">Source<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, #120.

<p><b>قال الهيثمى : فيه أبو زيد مولى عمرو بن حريث وهو مجهول</b><br />
“Al-Haythami said: the freed slave Abu Zaid bin Amr Hurayth is unknown.” (<b>Cited In: Suyuti’s: Jami Al-Ahadith, #11404 – <a class="nex_linkicon broken_link wpel-icon-right" href="http://islamport.com/d/1/mtn/1/37/995.html?zoom_highlightsub=%22%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AC%D9%87%D8%A7%D8%AF+%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%AC%D8%A8+%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%83%D9%85+%D9%85%D8%B9+%D9%83%D9%84+%D8%A3%D9%85%D9%8A%D8%B1+%D8%A8%D8%B1%D8%A7" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external">Source<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></b>).</p>
<p>Also, notice how the Musnad Ahmad hadith says that he (Abdullah bin Masood) was with the Prophet during the night of the jinn (which would refer to the Mi’raj). However, he never accompanied him at that time.</p>
<p><b>قال الدارقطني : وقيل إن ابن مسعود لم يشهد مع النبي – صلى الله عليه وسلم – ليلة الج</b></p>
<p>“Daraqutni said: It was said that <u><b>Ibn Masood did not witness with the Prophet</b></u> – peace be upon him – at the night of the jinn.” (<b>Daraqutni cited in Tafsir Al-Qurtubi – <a class="nex_linkicon wpel-icon-right" href="http://www.islamweb.net/newlibrary/display_book.php?idfrom=3215&amp;idto=3215&amp;bk_no=48&amp;ID=2666" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external">Source<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></b>).</p>
<p>So, these chains of narrations are not authentic and cannot be used as evidence.<br />
Secondly, even it was authentic, the Arabic word doesn’t strictly refer to fermented drink. It could also refer to an unfermented drink. The critics attempt to refute this by providing lexicons on the Arabic “nabiz” which show it means wine. They fail to realize that back then when the Arabic was more pristine and pure, the term “wine” wasn’t the only way it was understood. This is why he need to consult classical lexicons. The critics even show us from a classical lexicon that the word doesn’t specifically refer to a fermented drink:<br />
“Entabaztuhu (the past tense from entabaza) …… taken as nabeezen whether it is intoxicant <b>or not</b>, it is called nabeezen and alkhamr (strong drink) squeezed from vine is called nabeez and the nabeez is called khamr (strong drink)” (<b>Lisan Al-Arab</b>).</p>
<p>Here’s the part of Lisan Al-Arab the critic did not translate:<br />
“<b>Nabeeth is any drink that is made from dates, or grapes, or honey, or wheat, or barley, or other than that</b>. And it is called Nabeeth <b>whether it is intoxicating OR NOT</b>.” (<b>Lisan Al-Arab – <a class="nex_linkicon wpel-icon-right" href="http://www.lesanarab.com/kalima/%D9%86%D8%A8%D8%B0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external">Source<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></b>).<br />
<b>أنه نبيذ لم يشتد<br />
</b>“It’s Nabith <b>that hasn’t become intoxicated</b>.” (<b>Imam Nawawi: Commentary Of Sahih Muslim – <a class="nex_linkicon broken_link wpel-icon-right" href="http://hadith.al-islam.com/Loader.aspx?pageid=237&amp;Words=%D8%A3%D9%86%D9%87+%D9%86%D8%A8%D9%8A%D8%B0+%D9%84%D9%85+%D9%8A%D8%B4%D8%AA%D8%AF+&amp;Type=phrase&amp;Level=exact&amp;ID=387607&amp;Return=http://hadith.al-islam.com/Portals/al-islam_com/loader.aspx%3fpageid%3d236%26Words%3d%D8%A3%D9%86%D9%87%2b%D9%86%D8%A8%D9%8A%D8%B0%2b%D9%84%D9%85%2b%D9%8A%D8%B4%D8%AA%D8%AF%2b%26Level%3dexact%26Type%3dphrase%26SectionID%3d2%26Page%3d0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external">Source<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></b>).</p>
<p>“According to them “nabiz” meant fruit juice in which dates, dried raisins, etc are added in order to sweeten and that is drunk before it forms foams and becomes intoxicant.” (<b><a class="nex_linkicon broken_link wpel-icon-right" href="http://www.questionsonislam.com/index.php?s=show_qna&amp;id=1655" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external">Source<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></b>).</p>
<p>“What is Nabidh? It is a drink made of grapes; it is an <b>Arab grape-juice</b>. Since when is grape-juice Haram? After Umar left alcohol, he took up grape-juice as his favorite drink. As even a half-wit knows, wine is made by fermented grapes. Fermentation means that the drink is left out for so long that it grows yeast and thereby becomes toxic. Therefore, the conclusion we reach is that grape-juice is Halal but if it becomes fermented, then it becomes Haram. Thus, Nabidh is Halal if it hasn’t fermented. We can find the following fatwa on Al-Islam.com which says quite clearly: “Permissibility of Nabidh which is not ripe nor becomes intoxicant” (<a class="nex_linkicon wpel-icon-right" href="http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20070904002535/http://hadith.al-islam.com/bayan/tree.asp?Lang=eng&amp;ID=712" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external">http://hadith.al-islam.com/Bayan/tree.asp?Lang=eng&amp;ID=712<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>).” (<b><a class="nex_linkicon broken_link wpel-icon-right" href="http://www.schiiten.com/backup/AhlelBayt.com/www.ahlelbayt.com/response-to-chapter8.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external">Source<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></b>).</p>
<p>“An <b>unfermented liquor, called nabidh</b> like other palm-liquors, and made by letting water poured on fresh dates stand overnight, has been drunk since the time of Muhammad.” (<b>Western Arabia And The Red Sea – Naval Intelligence Division, 1946 – Page 489</b>).</p>
<p>A learned Mufti writes:</p>
<p>“It is incorrect to translate Nabeez as wine. <b>The correct translation of nabeez is that drink which has been sweetened by putting dates, grapes or honey (flavoured water with these items) in it but has not reached the stage where it is fermented and becomes an intoxicant</b>. (Al ta’reefaatul Fiqhiyah pg 225).” (<b><a class="nex_linkicon broken_link wpel-icon-right" href="http://www.mathabah.org/General-Counsel/did-the-prophet-muhammads-drink-wine.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external">Source<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></b>).</p>
<p>“Nabidh: (النبيذ) <b>Water in which dates or grapes etc., are soaked and left overnight and is not yet fermented</b>. It is lawful. But it begins to ferment as the time passes, effervescence and bubbling appear and it turns out to be intoxicating and becomes unlawful.” (<b>Nasiruddin Al-Khattab – English Translation Of Sunan Nasai – Darussalam, 2007 – Volume 6 – Page 452</b>).</p>

<p>If the Prophet drank fermented drinks, we wouldn’t expect that he throw it away after a certain point. He did this to make sure that he didn’t take fermented drinks. There would be no reason <b>in context with other narrations presented</b> as to why he would dispose of it, except that he shunned fermented drinks &amp; never drunk them, even if it wasn’t evident to him that it became fermented.</p>

<p>So, the Sahih Muslim narration does not show the Prophet asking as to whether or not the drink was fermented. It shows that he asked as to whether or not the drink was covered, and the above narrations given evidently prove this and give the full context.</p>
<p>They then cite a scholar from Lisan al-Arab:<br />
“Ibn alatheer said ……. It is meant the act of getting drunk so they make (he continues) what is prohibited is the act itself of getting into a state of drunkenness and not the drink itself, so they allow what is little of it which does not cause drunkenness, and what is famous is the first one.”</p>
<p>They said:<br />
“We understand also that even scholars considered only what is taken from wine to be prohibited and others allowed drinking a little amount of it on condition that one should not get drunk as the strong drink (Alkhamr) in itself is not prohibited.”</p>
<p>Reply:<br />
Can’t these critics read their own translation? Ibn Al-Atheer did not say one can have <i>strong</i> drink so long as you don’t get drunk. He said that which DOES NOT cause drunkenness. Let us read again:</p>
<p>“Ibn alatheer said ……. It is meant the act of getting drunk so they make (he continues) what is prohibited is the act itself of getting into a state of drunkenness and not the drink itself, so they <b>allow what is little of it which</b> <b>DOES NOT CAUSE DRUNKENNESS</b>, and what is famous is the first one.”<br />
So what is allowed here is little of which does not cause one to get drunk, according to Ibn Al-Atheer. What drink would that be? It would be what we have already proved it to be: UNFERMENTED DRINKS. Notice the critic writes “<b>others</b> allowed drinking a little amount of it on condition that one should not get drunk as the strong drink (Alkhamr) in itself is not prohibited.”<br />
Who are the “others?” All that was quoted as supposed evidence that one can drink a little alcohol if one does not get drunk was Ibn Al-Atheer (singular not plural), and even this was based on the critic’s misreading of what Ibn Al-Atheer said, according to their own translation.</p>
<p>They said:<br />
“We notice also that the prohibition of al-khamr came later, 13 years from Muhammad’s message. That is to say it was lawful for Muhammad to drink al-khamr especially because the definition of al-khamr at that time was not decisive as we saw some considered the word “sakar” nabeez while others considered it khamr.”</p>
<p>Reply:<br />
The prohibition didn’t come out of the blue 13 years later. It gradually came, until the last prohibition came in Surah 5:90-91. It was lawful before the prohibition of not getting drunk at salah (Surah 4:43). So, even if Prophet Muhammad did drink <b>before</b> this period, it would’ve have been back then, Islamically speaking. With that said, we have no proof the Prophet drank intoxicated drinks in his entire life. Commenting on the Prophet:</p>
<p>“He never worshipped an idol, <b>never drank alcohol</b>, never committed any offence and he was called among his people the “truthful and trustworthy.”” (<b>Rabaa’ Al Taweel – Reality Of The Testimony Of No God But Allah &amp; Mohammed Is The Messenger Of Allah – Browsed By: Shaikh Abdul Aziz Al Shaikh – King Fahd National Library Cataloging-in-Publication Data Al-Taweel, 2007 – Page 127</b>).</p>
<p>They said:<br />
“From the following hadith we see that Muhammad kept drinking from the same drink for three successive days while at the time there were no refrigerators to keep things in good condition. If it became rotten he poured it down:<br />
حدثنا ‏ ‏مخلد بن خالد ‏ ‏حدثنا ‏ ‏أبو معاوية ‏ ‏عن ‏ ‏الأعمش ‏ ‏عن ‏ ‏أبي عمر يحيى البهراني ‏ ‏عن ‏ ‏ابن عباس ‏ ‏قال ‏<br />
‏كان ‏ ‏ينبذ ‏ ‏للنبي ‏ ‏صلى الله عليه وسلم ‏ ‏الزبيب فيشربه اليوم والغد وبعد الغد إلى مساء الثالثة ثم يأمر به ‏ ‏فيسقى الخدم أو ‏ ‏يهراق</p>
<p>Sunan Abi Dawood, drinks, quality of al-Nabeez no. 3226 (Arabic version)</p>
<p>Translation: Raisin was younbaz (prepared to be nabeez) and he drank it, the same day, the following day and the day after till the evening of the third day. Then he commanded that the servants would drink from it or to be poured down.<br />
In a hot country like Saudi Arabia, within three days the nabeez will be strong to some extent.”</p>
<p>Reply:<br />
A hot country would speed the process up. Exactly! That is the whole reason the Prophet made it <a class="nex_linkicon broken_link wpel-icon-right" href="http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/muslim/023.smt.html#023.4943" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external">forbidden<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> to prepare Nabidh in things like: green pitcher, varnished jar, etc, and is the reason why he prepared Nabidh in waterskins. As shown <a href="http://www.islamic-life.com/forums/#waterskins" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" data-wpel-link="external">above<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, placing it in waterskins slows down the process of fermentation, because waterskins are used to ensure drinks maintain their cool temperatures. If the Prophet was interested in fermented Nabidh, why would he not only <b>forbid</b> other preparation methods, but endorse a method which takes long to ferment drinks? It’s obvious here that he did not drink alcohol, nor desired to.<br />
Secondly, the Prophet did not wait for it to become rotten to pour it down. He (in advance) poured it down, in fear that it might have fermented, even if it wasn’t evident to him. This has already been discussed <a href="http://www.islamic-life.com/forums/#unfermented" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" data-wpel-link="external">above<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. Moreover, commenting on a very similar hadith on the authority of Ibn Abbas found in Sunan Nasai, we read:</p>
<p>“‘(He) used to drink it’ <b>provided the danger of intoxication had not had occurred</b>. <b>When there was danger of intoxication, it was poured out</b>.” (<b>Nasiruddin Al-Khattab – English Translation Of Sunan Nasai – Darussalam, 2007 – Commentary Of Hadith Number 5741 – Volume 6 – Page 373</b>).</p>
<p>So, we <b>CHALLANGE</b> the WikiIslam critics to prove that the Prophet threw away the drink, after it merely became rotten.</p>
<p>They said:<br />
“In another hadith we find that Muhammad himself drank the strong nabeez but after he broke it with water which means that it is not the material itself that matters but the states of getting drunk:<br />
عن أبي مسعود قال : عطش النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم وهو يطوف فأتي بنبيذ من السقاية فقطب , فقيل : أحرام هو ؟ قال لا : علي بذنوب من ماء زمزم , فصب عليه وشرب ”<br />
[1]
<p>Translation: Narrated by Abi Masoud, he said: The prophet <acronym title="Peace be upon him">PBUH</acronym> got thirsty while he was doing tawaf (walking around the Black Stone), so he was given some nabeez from the al-Sekaa (pot made from skin) but he frowned and was asked: was it prohibited (haram)? He said No, fetch some zamzam water and he poured on it and drank.<br />
There are many other hadiths that prove that Muhammad commanded people to break the strong drink with water.”</p>
<p>Reply:<br />
Firstly, they must prove from this narration that the drink was fermented. Secondly, these critics might ignorantly claim that this narration is in Bukhari, but the translators were too scared to translate this. In reality, this is not the case. This narration was collected by Bukhari, but he did not include in in is Sahih collection. The reason why is because it is a weak hadith according to Bukhari, Abu Zarah Al-Razi, Daaraqutni, Ibn Hajar, Bayhaqi and others. (<a class="nex_linkicon broken_link wpel-icon-right" href="http://www.dorar.net/enc/hadith/%D8%A8%D9%86%D8%A8%D9%8A%D8%B0+%D9%85%D9%86+%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D9%82%D8%A7%D9%8A%D8%A9+%D9%81%D9%82%D8%B7%D8%A8/+wj" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external">Source<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>).</p>
<p>We have problems with a certain narrator named Yahya bin Yahman. This is what Bukhari himself said about this narrator:</p>
<p><b>حديث ضعيف لأن يحيى بن يمان انفرد به دون أصحاب سفيان وهو سيء الحفظ كثير الخطأ<br />
</b><br />
“Da’eef hadeeth because Yahya ibn Yahman narrated mistakes about Sufyan, and had a bad memory and made errors.” (<b>Abu Abdullah Muhammad ibn Yusuf al-Hanafi Zayla’i – Nasb Al-Rayah Takhrij Ahadith – <a class="nex_linkicon broken_link wpel-icon-right" href="http://www.islamport.com/b/3/alhadeeth/takhreej/%DF%CA%C8%20%C7%E1%CA%CE%D1%ED%CC/%E4%D5%C8%20%C7%E1%D1%C7%ED%C9/%E4%D5%C8%20%C7%E1%D1%C7%ED%C9%20042.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external">Source<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></b>).</p>
<p>“Yahya ibn Yaman was weak.” (<b>Mizanul I’tidal – cited <a class="nex_linkicon wpel-icon-right" href="http://gift2shias.com/2010/07/31/hadeeth-when-i-was-washing-body-of-prophet-sallalahu-alaihi-wa-ala-alihi-wa-sallam/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external">here<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></b>).</p>
<p>“Yahya Ibn Yaman, of whom Ibn Hajr says: “He was a righteous man, but they (i.e. the scholars of Hadeeth) are agreed that <b>he used to make many mistakes, especially in the Hadeeth of (Sufyan) Ath-Thawri</b>.” (<b>Muhammad Ibn ‘Abd Al-Wahhab – Mukhtasar Zad Al-Ma’ad – Darussalam, 2003 – Page 196</b>).<br />
“Yahya bin Yaman is weak.” (<b>Sheikh Albani – Silsilah Hadith Daif: Volume 2 – Gema Insani, 1997 – Page 72</b>).</p>
<p>Commenting on this hadith:</p>
<p><b>إسناد شديد الضعف فيه راو مجهول في موضع التعليق</b><br />
“Isnad is very weak as <b>there’s an anonymous narrator and it’s fabricated</b>.” (<b>Ibn Qutaybah – Kitab Al-Ashribah, #9 – <a class="nex_linkicon wpel-icon-right" href="http://www.islamweb.net/hadith/display_hbook.php?bk_no=188&amp;hid=9&amp;pid=46722" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external">Source<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></b>).</p>
<p>The same narration is found in Sunan Nasai, #5706, which has been declared as weak by hadith scholar: Nasiruddin Al-Khattab (<b>Nasiruddin Al-Khattab – English Translation Of Sunan Nasai – Darussalam, 2007 – Volume 6 – Page 360</b>).</p>
<p>To add, Imam Al-Nasai who collected this narration himself stated that the hadith is weak (<b><a class="nex_linkicon broken_link wpel-icon-right" href="http://hadith.al-islam.com/Page.aspx?pageid=192&amp;BookID=27&amp;PID=5614" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external">Source<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>.

Sheikh Albani also declared it weak (<b>Sahih Wa Da’if Sunan An-Nasai, #5703 – <a class="nex_linkicon broken_link wpel-icon-right" href="http://ba7th.net/cached-version.aspx?id=2687-12-203&amp;highlight=%22%D9%81%D8%B4%D9%85%D9%87%20%D9%81%D9%82%D8%B7%D8%A8%20%D9%81%D9%82%D8%A7%D9%84%20%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%8A%22" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external">Source<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></b>). Likewise, Ibn Hajar has pointed to the weakness of the narration (<b>Fathul Bari – Volume 3 – Page 67 – <a class="nex_linkicon broken_link wpel-icon-right" href="http://ba7th.net/cached-version.aspx?id=1820-3-67" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external">Source<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></b>). Imam Al-Bayhaqi has likewise pointed to the weakness of this hadith and to the narrators (<b>Sunan Al-Kubra Lil-Bayhaqi, #17896 – <a class="nex_linkicon broken_link wpel-icon-right" href="http://ba7th.net/cached-version.aspx?id=1683-8-304&amp;highlight=%22%D9%81%D8%B4%D9%85%D9%87%20%D9%81%D9%82%D8%B7%D8%A8%20%D9%81%D9%82%D8%A7%D9%84%20%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%8A%22" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external">Source<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></b>).

<p>Even if the narration was authentic and deemed acceptable by hadith scholars, as reiterated before: the Arabic word used in this hadith (Nabidh) can refer to unfermented drink. Hence, it would fail to prove that the Prophet drank fermented drinks. The ignoramus critics at WikiIslam then claim that all narrations they used in their article are sahih. We <b>CHALLENGE</b> them to academically adduce that the Musnad Ahmad narration and the one given above is sahih, giving <b>reasons</b> as to why we should accept it’s authenticity. Reasons have been given above to reject the authenticity of the 2 narrations.</p>
<p>They said:<br />
“In this case the entire section of hadith “Drinking wine and fermenting the container” has been omitted from English hadith collections.”</p>
<p>Reply:<br />
There is NO SUCH SECTION which mentions the above exact wording in Arabic. We CHALLENGE these bigots to provide us the Arabic text from Sahih Muslim.<br />
To conclude, these greenhorn critics need to do much more studying before attempting to promulgate their preconceived propaganda.</p>

<p><span id="more-900"></span></p>
<p>With regard to what the questioner has mentioned, there is no proof to confirm it in the Holy Qur’an or in the saheeh Prophetic Sunnah. The most that has been narrated concerning it is reports from some of the Sahaabah and Taabi‘een.</p>
<p>It was narrated from Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with him) that he said: The first thing that Allah created was the Pen, and it wrote all that is to happen. Then water vapour was raised, from which the heavens were created. Then the noon – i.e., the whale – was created, and the earth was spread out on the back of the noon, and the earth moved and shook. Then it was made steady with the mountains, and for that reason the mountains boast to the earth. And he recited (interpretation of the meaning): <i>“</i><i>Noon. (These letters (Noon, etc.) are one of the miracles of the Quran, and none but Allah (Alone) knows their meanings).By the pen and what the (angels) write (in the Records of men)” [al-Qalam 68:1]</i>.</p>
<p>This was narrated by ‘Abd al-Razzaaq in his <i>Tafseer</i> (2/307); Ibn Abi Shaybah (14/101); Ibn Abi Haatim – as mentioned in <i> Tafseer Ibn Katheer</i> (8/210); at-Tabari in <i>Jaami‘ al-Bayaan</i> (23/140); al-Haakim in <i>al-Mustadrak</i> (2/540); and many others. All of them narrated it via al-A‘mash, from Abu Zabyaan Husayn ibn Jundub, from Ibn ‘Abbaas. This is a saheeh isnaad. Al-Haakim said: This hadith is saheeh according to the conditions of the two shaykhs (al-Bukhaari and Muslim), although they did not narrate it. Adh-Dhahabi said in <i>at-Talkhees</i> [It is saheeh] according to the conditions of al-Bukhaari and Muslim, as was narrated from Mujaahid, Muqaatil, as-Suddi and al-Kalbi. See: <i>ad-Durr al-Manthoor</i> (8/240); <i>Tafseer Ibn Katheer</i> (8/185) at the beginning of the commentary on Soorat al-Qalam.</p>
<p>This report – as you can see – is mawqoof and is the words of Ibn ‘Abbaas. It is not the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). What is most likely to be the case is that Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with him) learned it from the words of Ka‘b al-Ahbaar or from the books of Bani Israa’eel that contain many weird and strange things and lies. This is indicated by the details mentioned in some of the books of tafseer concerning this matter.</p>
<p>Imam al-Baghawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>
<p>The narrators said: When Allah created the earth and split it (from the heavens), He sent from beneath the Throne an angel who came down to earth until he reached beneath the seven earths, then he placed them on his shoulders, with one of his hands in the east and the other in the west, stretched out and holding the seven earths until he managed to get them settled. His feet did not have a firm place to stand on, so Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, sent down from al-Firdaws a bull that had forty thousand horns and forty thousand feet, and He made the feet of the angel stand on its hump, but his feet did not become settled firmly on it. So Allah took a green emerald from the highest level of al-Firdaws, the thickness of which was the distance of five hundred years, and He placed it between the hump and the ear of the bull, so that the feet of the angel could stand firm on it. The horns of that bull emerge from beneath the layers of the earth, and its nostrils are in the sea. Every day it takes a breath. When it exhales, the tide comes in towards the land, and when it inhales, the tide goes out. The feet of the bull had no firm place to stand, so Allah, may He be exalted, created a rock as thick as seven heavens and seven earths, so that the feet of the bull could stand firm on it. This is the rock that Luqmaan mentioned to his son when he said: <i> “</i><i>O my son! If it be (anything) equal to the weight of a grain of mustard seed, and though it be in a rock, or in the heavens or in the earth, Allah will bring it forth” [Luqmaan 31:16]</i>. The rock was not stable, so Allah created a noon, which is a great whale, and placed the rock on its back, and there is nothing else on its body. The whale is on an ocean, and the ocean is carried on the back of the wind, and the wind is carried by divine power. It was said that the entire world, with everything on it, is only two letters (the kaaf and noon of the word <i>kun</i>, meaning ‘Be!’); the Compeller, may He be glorified and exalted, said to it: ‘Be!’, and it was.</p>
<p>Ka‘b al-Ahbaar said:</p>
<p>Iblees managed to reach the whale on whose back the earth is carried and he whispered to it: Do you know what is on your back, O Leviathan – the name of the whale – of nations, animals, trees and mountains? If you shake them off, you will throw them off from your back. Leviathan thought of doing that, but Allah sent a beast that entered his nostrils and reached his brain, so the whale beseeched Allah because of it, and Allah gave it permission to leave.</p>
<p>Ka‘b said: By the One in Whose hand is my soul, the whale is looking at the beast and the beast is looking at the whale, in case the whale wants to do that, in which case the beast is ready to jump back into its nostrils. End quote.</p>
<p><i> Ma‘aalim at-Tanzeel</i> (8/186). There is a similar report in <i>Tafseer al-Qurtubi</i> (29/442). The words of Ka‘b al-Ahbaar were narrated by Abu Nu‘aym in <i>Hilyat al-Awliya’ </i>(8/6), The commentators on <i>Tafseer at-Qurtubi</i> (1/385), both Dr ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Abd al-Muhsin at-Turki and Muhammad Ridwaan ‘Irqsoosi, commented on this report and said: It is an Israa’eeli report (i.e., from Jewish sources) for which there is no basis. It would have been better for the author to keep such things out of his book. End quote.</p>
<p>Look at how the narrators added more details to the story, then ultimately the matter can be traced back to Ka‘b al-Ahbaar, who was the source of many weird things that are attributed to this religion.</p>
<p>Therefore al-Haafiz Ibn Katheer pointed out in <i>al-Bidaayah wa’n-Nihaayah</i> (1/15) – after mentioning a number of weird reports, including this hadith – that it is one of the Israa’eeliyyaat (reports from Jewish sources) and said: In this report with this isnaad, as-Suddi mentions many weird things; it is as if many of them came from the Israa’eeliyyaat. End quote.</p>
<p>There are also some marfoo‘, munkar (odd) hadiths with similar meanings, including the report narrated from Ibn ‘Umar, according to which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The earth is above the water, and the water is above a rock, and the rock is on the back of a whale whose flippers touch the Throne. The whale is on the shoulders of an angel whose feet are standing on nothing.” This is a mawdoo‘ (fabricated) hadith. See: <i>as-Silsilah ad-Da‘eefah</i> (no. 294).</p>
<p>As none of these reports was proven to be sound or regarded as part of religious teachings, and they are not mentioned in the Book of Allah or in the Sunnah of His Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), the most that can be said concerning them is that they are reports from some of the early generations, and it is clear that the source of all of them is reports from Jewish sources. What we must do with regard to such reports is refrain from confirming any of them, and delegate knowledge of that to the Knower of the unseen, as the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) taught us. It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The People of the Book used to read the Torah in Hebrew and explain it in Arabic to the Muslims. Therefore the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Do not believe the people of the Book and do not disbelieve them. <i>‘</i><i>Say (O Muslims), &#8220;We believe in Allah and that which has been sent down to us and that which has been sent down to Ibrahim (Abraham), Ismail (Ishmael), Ishaq (Isaac), Ya‘qoob (Jacob), and to Al-Asbat (the twelve sons of Ya‘qoob (Jacob)), and that which has been given to Moosa (Moses) and ‘Eesa (Jesus), and that which has been given to the Prophets from their Lord. We make no distinction between any of them, and to Him we have submitted (in Islam)’ [al-Baqarah 2:136]</i>.”</p>
<p>According to another report, the reason for refraining from believing or disbelieving is explained as follows:</p>
<p>“Then if it is false you will not have believed it and if it is true you will not have disbelieved it.” Narrated by Abu Dawood (3644) and Ahmad (16774); classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in <i>as-Saheehah</i> (2800).</p>
<p>And Allah knows best.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The following question was posed to Mufti Naseem Ashraf Habibi (South Africa) who in turned requested Allama Mufti Mohammad Akhtar Raza Azhari to provide the answer. Hadrat was at the moment in Johannesburg, South Africa.<strong> </strong></p>
<p><span id="more-880"></span></p>
<p><strong> QUESTION:</strong><em> </em></p>
<p><em> What is the Islamic ruling concerning the following question: Is the circumcision of women permissible in Islam?</em></p>
<p><strong> Mahomed Yunus Abdul Karrim</strong></p>
<p><strong> Durban. South Africa</strong></p>
<p><strong> THE ANSWER </strong></p>
<p>The circumcision of women in not Sunnah and neither has it been an emphasized command in Shari&#8217;at. It is a tradition in certain of the Arab countries.</p>
<p>It is stated in the Hadith Shareef that:</p>
<p><em> &#8220;Circumcision is Sunnah for men, and for women it is only better.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>It is in <strong>&#8220;Dur&#8217;re Mukhtar&#8221;</strong> that:</p>
<p><em> &#8220;The circumcision of women is not Sunnah, but for the sake of the men, it is something which is better and this statement that it is Sunnah is Da&#8217;eef (weak).&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Where the tradition of circumcision for women is not present, it should not be started since this will cause people to laugh at and make a mockery of Shari&#8217;at. For further reference, refer to <strong>&#8220;Fatawa Afriqa&#8221;</strong> of A&#8217;la Hadrat <em>(radi Allahu anhu).</em></p>
<p><em> Almighty Allah knows best.</em><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Mohammad Akhtar Raza Khan Qadiri Azhari</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Written by MDI [Source: http://www.muslimdebate.org/theological-arguments/answering-islamophobic-claims/35-are-muslims-commanded-to-fight-until-everyone-submits-to-islam ]
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A common Hadith that critics often bring up is the following one:</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p><em>Bukhari Volume 1, Book 2, Number 24:</em></p>
<p><em>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar:</em></p>
<p><em>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said: &#8220;I have been ordered (by Allah) to fight against the people until they testify that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah and that Muhammad is Allah&#8217;s Apostle, and offer the prayers perfectly and give the obligatory charity, so if they perform a that, then they save their lives an property from me except for Islamic laws and then their reckoning (accounts) will be done by Allah.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p><span id="more-861"></span></p>
<p>So from the above Hadith, they conclude that Muslims are obligated to fight the non-Muslims, until they convert to Islam, and this proves that Islam is not a peaceful religion but a religion that does seek to impose itself on everyone.</p>
<p>Now as with most things, especially when we’re dealing with a piece of a text, is that we analyze the text in it’s context, rather than simply isolating it all on it’s own, and then deriving a supposed interpretation and conclusion. Anyone who studies about Islam will find that the Holy Quran teaches for religious freedom:</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p><em>Let there be no compulsion in religion: Truth stands out clear from Error: whoever rejects evil and believes in Allah hath grasped the most trustworthy hand-hold, that never breaks. And Allah heareth and knoweth all things. (2:256)</em></p>
<p><em>So if they dispute with thee, say: &#8220;I have submitted My whole self to Allah and so have those who follow me.&#8221; And say to the People of the Book and to those who are unlearned: &#8220;Do ye (also) submit yourselves?&#8221; If they do, they are in right guidance, but if they turn back, Thy duty is to convey the Message; and in Allah&#8217;s sight are (all) His servants. (3:20)</em></p></blockquote>
<p>And an entire chapter devoted to religious freedom:</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p><em>Say: O ye that reject Faith! I worship not that which ye worship, Nor will ye worship that which I worship. And I will not worship that which ye have been wont to worship, Nor will ye worship that which I worship. To you be your Way, and to me mine. </em>(Surah 109)</p></blockquote>
<p>So it is quite clear that Islam teaches religious tolerance, nobody is compelled to follow Islam, they can keep their way and religion, and the same for the Muslims. So in light of this one must therefore apply the Hadith to this context, one cannot simply ignore all these verses and then go on to conclude that Islam teaches forced conversions to Islam.</p>
<p>Now we move to the second part, and we go back to the Quran, because the above Hadith is very familiar to a Quranic passage, and the passage reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p><em>And fight them on until there is no more tumult or oppression, and there prevail justice and faith in Allah altogether and everywhere; but if they cease, verily Allah doth see all that they do. (8:39)</em></p></blockquote>
<p>In the above passage Muslims are commanded to fight until there is no more oppression, till justice prevails, and when faith is for Allah. This is essentially the same message as the Hadith in a slight different wording, but the content is similar. Now off course if we applied the same narrow minded methodology as many Islamophobes do, then we too would have to conclude that 8:39 commands Muslims to fight until people have faith in Allah, meaning convert to Islam and submit to Allah. In fact the Islamophobic bigot Geert Wilders brought this verse up in his Fitna documentary.</p>
<p>If anyone studies the context of 8:39 one will see that this verse was aimed at the Pagans, not only was this verse revealed against the Pagans, but the very same Pagans the Muslims were at war with. Basically this verse was revealed during a time of war between the Muslims and the Pagans, the very same Pagans who initiated the war as the verse itself mentions, the Muslims are to fight them until there is no more OPPRESSION, and these Pagans were oppressing the Muslims. The Pagans were the ones who began the conflict, and the reason behind this conflict was simply down to the faith of Muslims, the Muslims were being persecuted by the Pagans precisely because of their Muslim faith. Muslims were beaten, tortured, and killed at the hands of the Pagans.</p>
<p>So how does this all relate to the Hadith in question? The reason why it relates to the Hadith is because the Quranic verse is very similar to what the prophet said, and when one analyzes the Quran one will find that when it gave this specific ruling, it was revealed during a time of war, and revealed against the Pagan combatants. Hence we must apply the same standard to the Hadith in question. After all, the best interpretation to the Quran and Hadith is the Quran and Hadith itself.</p>
<p>If one were to also study what Islamic scholarship had to say about this, then they would further see that the Islamophobic interpretation is unfounded. For example the well known and major scholar, Imam Nawawi, explained the Hadith as referring to the Pagan Arabs, and as we have mentioned, these were the same Pagan Arabs who initiated the conflict with the Muslims. And finally, Ibn Taymiyyah, another major Islamic scholar who is often labeled as an extremist had this to say about the hadith in question:</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p><strong><em>&#8220;It refers to fighting those who are waging war, whom Allah has permitted us to fight. It does not refer to those who have a covenant with us with whom Allah commands us to fulfill our covenant.&#8221; [</em></strong><strong>Majmû` al-Fatâwâ (19/20)<em>]</em></strong></p></blockquote>

<strong>a rapist</strong><strong><br />

an assassin<br />

a cult leader<br />
a mentally deranged</strong> (was paranoid, heard voices, hallucinated of seeing jinns, Satan and angels, used to think he had sex with his wives when he did not, suffered from depression and had suicidal tendencies).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One by one <em>Insha’Allah</em>, we will destroy Ali Sina’s accusations.</p>
<p><b>Accusation No.1</b></p>
<p>“A Rapist”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that the person who Ali Sina thinks was “raped” is Safiyyah, a wife of the Holy Prophet (S). We need not reply to such stupid claims, we will just move on to the more important things. Still, if anyone is interested in learning about Safiyyah please visit this wonderful article written by Brother Bassam Zawadi:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.answering-christianity.com/bassam_zawadi/safiyyah_the_wife_of_the_prophet.htm" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">http://www.answering-christianity.com/bassam_zawadi/safiyyah_the_wife_of_the_prophet.htm<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Accusation No.2</b></p>
<p>“A Pedophile”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ali Sina’s problem here isn’t with the Holy Prophet (S), but infact it is with Aisha (R). The reasons why this accusation is itself lame is because:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Back then, it was perfectly normal for a girl at young age to marry. We know this because before Aisha was married to the Holy Prophet (S), she was engaged to someone else</li>
<li>Who are we to tell Aisha now what is right for her and what is wrong for her? Aisha (R) remained all her life married to the Holy Prophet (S), and even when she was given the chance to divorce the Holy Prophet (S), she did not divorce him! A case like this shows that both of them loved each other</li>
<li>Noone objected to Aisha’s marriage with the Holy Prophet (S), infact everyone was happy! It seems the only person who has a problem, is Ali Sina and his crowd.</li>
<li>It was Aisha’s parents who approved of this marriage. They deemed it good to marry their daughter to the Holy Prophet (S), and indeed they did a great thing, <strong>as Aisha grew up to be a great scholar of Islam! </strong></li>
<li>When one looks up the definition of a “pedophile”, you will find that pedophiles have: “&#8221;Low self esteem. Many pedophiles, although by no means all, do not have a great sense of capacity for adopting a sexual demeanor towards adults or those of their own age or older. <strong><u>They feel unhappy and fearful at the prospect of sexual behaviour with adults</u></strong> and hence turn to children due to the fact that they are unable to have the strength of personality to seek adults for sexual demeanor. When considering treatment therefore it is important to establish and develop a higher sense of self-esteem in such individuals.&#8221; (<a href="http://www.answering-christianity.com/aisha.htm" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Source<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>). Obviously that is not the case with the Holy Prophet (S), as his other wives were older then Aisha, two of his wives were older then him, specifically Sauda (R) and Khadijah (R).</li>
<li>If the Holy Prophet (S) was a pedophile (Astaghfirullah), then one must ask why didn’t he consummate his marriage with Aisha right there and then when Aisha (R) was six years old? Infact, this source says: &#8220;Lack of impulse control. Many pedophiles find it extremely difficult to deal with the impulsive nature which inclines them towards sexual behaviour to children. <strong><u>They simply cannot control their need for engaging children in sexual practices</u></strong>. They might be said to suffer from an obsessive-compulsive condition. Here again treatment would involve developing better impulse control and of course redirecting the sexual inclinations.&#8221; (Source, same as above). Thus, if the Holy Prophet (S) was a “pedophile”, according to the definition of a pedophile, he would have no control over his sexual desire. On the contrary, the Holy Prophet (S) waited 3 years after the marriage contract to consummate his marriage with Aisha.</li>
<li>Can we honestly say Aisha (R) would’ve remained with the Holy Prophet (S) after she was allegedly “molested”? We must remember that Aisha (R) was very wise, and a great orator and she was quick to comment when she saw something wrong. If she was in any way, shape or form “molested” by the Holy Prophet (S), then she would’ve never remained married to him!</li>
<li>The women who spoke to Aisha (R) when she was marrying the Holy Prophet (S) were happy for Aisha. When she married the Holy Prophet (S), they praised her, they didn’t cry for her, or pity her for marrying a person who is, allegedly, as Ali Sina claims a “pedophile” (Astaghfirullah!).</li>
<li>Even the Non-Muslims who were quick to yell and shout when they saw something they didn’t like in Islam didn’t think anything was wrong with this marriage. After all, how can they say this marriage was wrong, when in the Arab culture it is normal for a girl at a young age to marry?</li>
<li>Do we honestly think if Aisha (R) were alive today, she would support people like Ali Sina, who claim she was molested, and that her husband was a “pedophile”??</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lastly, we end this section with some quotes from Aisha (R):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Sahih Al-Bukhari</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em>Volume 1, Book 6, Number 299: </em></p>
<p>Narrated &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Al-Aswad:</p>
<p>(on the authority of his father) &#8216;Aisha said: &#8220;Whenever Allah&#8217;s Apostle wanted to fondle anyone of us during her periods (menses), he used to order her to put on an Izar and start fondling her.&#8221; <strong><u>&#8216;Aisha added, &#8220;None of you could control his sexual desires as the Prophet could.</u></strong>&#8221;</p>
<p>Sahih Muslim</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Book 006, Number 2439: </em></p>
<p>&#8216;A&#8217;isha (Allah be pleased with her) reported: Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) used to kiss (his wives) while fasting and embraced (them) while fasting<strong><u>; but he had the greatest mastery over his desire among you.</u></strong></p>
<p>Thus, according to the words of our Mother Aisha (R), the Holy Prophet (S) had the greatest control over his desire amongst the people. Thus, Aisha (R) herself has refuted the Christian missionaries, and anti-Islamic haters like Ali Sina with these quotes of hers!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Accusation No.3</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“An Assassin”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that many of these so called “assassinations” reported in Ibn Ishaq’s or Tabari’s works all have something in common, and that is that because the person who was assassinated insulted the Holy Prophet (S), were assassinated. However, the scholars have looked at reports like this and have concluded:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>All such reports, as ascribe the execution of others merely to their having harrased the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in the past, have Ibn Ishaq as the last narrator at the top; and in the terminology of the traditionalists such reports are called Mursal and are not to be relied on.&#8221;</u></strong></p>
<p>(Source: Sirat-Un-Nabi, by Allama Shibli Nu&#8217;Mani, rendered into English by M. Tayyib Bakhsh Budayuni, Kazi Publications Lahore, Vol. II, p. 199-203, bold and underlined emphasis ours)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ali Sina can however now run and quote from the Authentic Collections of hadith where it shows that Ka’b bin Al-Ashraf was executed. However, one must note that there were reports that say Ka’b bin Al-Ashraf planned to get the Prophet (S) assassinated, and that he went to Makkah to incite the Pagans to fight the Holy Prophet (S).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Secondly, Ka’b did all this, despite the fact that the Holy Prophet (S) had a treaty with the Jews, which clearly says, “Whoever is rebellious or whosoever seeks to spread enmity and sedition, the hand of every God-fearing Muslim shall be against him, even if he be his son” (Source: The Life of Muhammad PBUH by Abdul Hameed Siddiqui, p. 141-142). Thus, the liar and deceiver Ka’b bin Al-Ashraf had to pay the price, for planning to assassinate the Holy Prophet (S), and for putting the lives of the Muslims and the Jews who the Muslims had a treaty with in danger.</p>

<p>“A Mass Murderer”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One reason why Ali Sina calls the Holy Prophet (S) a “mass murderer” is because of the Banu Quraiza incident. Here are some hadiths which will perhaps shed some more light on this topic:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Sahih Muslim</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em>Book 19, Number 4368: </em></p>
<p>It has been narrated on the authority of Abu Sa&#8217;id al-Khudri who said: The people of Quraiza surrendered accepting the decision of Sa&#8217;d b. Mu&#8217;adh about them. Accordingly, the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) sent for Sa&#8217;d who came to him riding a donkey. When he approached the mosque, the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said to the Ansar: Stand up to receive your chieftain. Then he said (to Sa&#8217;d): These people have surrendered accepting your decision. He (Sa&#8217;d) said: <strong><u>You will kill their fighters</u></strong> and capture their women and children. (Hearing this), the Prophet (may peace he upon him) said: You have adjudged by the command of God. The narrator is reported to have said: Perhaps he said: You have adjudged by the decision of a king.<br />
Ibn Muthanna (in his version of the tradition) has not mentioned the alternative words.</p>
<p>Sahih Al-Bukhari</p>
<p><em>Volume 5, Book 58, Number 148: </em></p>
<p>Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri:</p>
<p>Some people (i.e. the Jews of Bani bin Quraiza) agreed to accept the verdict of Sad bin Muadh so the Prophet sent for him (i.e. Sad bin Muadh). He came riding a donkey, and when he approached the Mosque, the Prophet said, &#8220;Get up for the best amongst you.&#8221; or said, &#8220;Get up for your chief.&#8221; Then the Prophet said, &#8220;O Sad! These people have agreed to accept your verdict.&#8221; Sad said, &#8220;I judge that their warriors should be killed and their children and women should be taken as captives.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;You have given a judgment similar to Allah&#8217;s Judgment (or the King&#8217;s judgment).&#8221;</p>
<p><em>Volume 8, Book 74, Number 278: </em></p>
<p>Narrated Abu Said:</p>
<p>The people of (the tribe of) Quraiza agreed upon to accept the verdict of Sa&#8217;d. The Prophet sent for him (Sa&#8217;d) and he came. The Prophet said (to those people), &#8220;Get up for your chief or the best among you!&#8221; Sa&#8217;d sat beside the Prophet and the Prophet said (to him), &#8220;These people have agreed to accept your verdict.&#8221; Sa&#8217;d said, &#8220;So I give my judgment that their warriors should be killed and their women and children should be taken as captives.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;You have judged according to the King&#8217;s (Allah&#8217;s) judgment.&#8221; (See Hadith No. 447, Vol. 5)</p>
<p>Those who reached the age of puberty were eligible to fight, hence considered warriors.</p>
<p>Secondly, this is double standards on the part of Ali Sina, as in all of the wars fought by the Muslims, combined, only one thousand and eighteen persons lost their lives on both sides. Out of that, only two hundred and fifty nine were Muslims. It is interesting to note that Ali Sina is quick to comment on this, and he is quick to say that the Holy Prophet (S) was a “mass murderer”, even though the amount of people killed are not even close to what Charles the Great did to the Pagan Saxons. Also, the “famous answer by which the Papal Legate, in the Algerian War, quieted the scruples of a too conscientious general, ‘Kill all, God will know His own’. And how can we forget the Two World Wars, where in WWI alone, ten million soldiers were killed, and an equal number of civilians. In WWII, twenty two million people were killed. No person can compare these numbers to the amount of people killed in the wars fought by the Holy Prophet (S), since they do not even come close to that number!</p>
<p>Dr. Jamal Badawi <a href="http://www.islamonline.net/english/Contemporary/2005/04/Article01.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">writes<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>:</p>
<p>Referring to this incident, many say the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) massacred the tribe of Banu Quraizhah, but this is a distortion of the historical facts. In fact, it was not a sentence by the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him). The people of Banu Quraizhah chose their own arbitrator and former ally (Sa`d), who determined their punishment according to the law of the Torah, which specifies killing for treason. The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) simply agreed with his sentence, but it was not the sentence of the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) in the first place. A scholarly article by W. N. Arafat questions the exaggerated estimate of the number of fighting men who were punished, which is found even in some biographies about the Prophet’s life, like that of Ibn Ishaq. His argument is compelling and well researched.</p>
<p>Lastly, it is to be noted that the Holy Prophet (S), gave the Jews the penalty as per what their Holy Book said:</p>
<p>1 When you go to war against your enemies and see horses and chariots and an army greater than yours, do not be afraid of them, because the LORD your God, who brought you up out of Egypt, will be with you. 2 When you are about to go into battle, the priest shall come forward and address the army. 3 He shall say: &#8220;Hear, O Israel, today you are going into battle against your enemies. Do not be fainthearted or afraid; do not be terrified or give way to panic before them. 4 For the LORD your God is the one who goes with you to fight for you against your enemies to give you victory.&#8221;</p>
<p>5 The officers shall say to the army: &#8220;Has anyone built a new house and not dedicated it? Let him go home, or he may die in battle and someone else may dedicate it. 6 Has anyone planted a vineyard and not begun to enjoy it? Let him go home, or he may die in battle and someone else enjoy it. 7 Has anyone become pledged to a woman and not married her? Let him go home, or he may die in battle and someone else marry her.&#8221; 8 Then the officers shall add, &#8220;Is any man afraid or fainthearted? Let him go home so that his brothers will not become disheartened too.&#8221; 9 When the officers have finished speaking to the army, they shall appoint commanders over it.</p>
<p>10 When you march up to attack a city, make its people an offer of peace. 11 If they accept and open their gates, all the people in it shall be subject to forced labor and shall work for you. 12 If they refuse to make peace and they engage you in battle, lay siege to that city. 13 <strong><u>When the LORD your God delivers it into your hand, put to the sword all the men in it</u></strong>. 14 <strong><u>As for the women, the children, the livestock and everything else in the city, you may take these as plunder for yourselves. And you may use the plunder the LORD your God gives you from your enemies. </u></strong>15 <strong><u>This is how you are to treat all the cities that are at a distance from you and do not belong to the nations nearby.</u></strong></p>
<p><strong><u> 16 However, in the cities of the nations the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance, do not leave alive anything that breathes. 17 Completely destroy <sup>[<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deut%2020&amp;version=31#fen-NIV-5445a" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">a<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>]</sup> them—the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites—as the LORD your God has commanded you. 18 Otherwise, they will teach you to follow all the detestable things they do in worshiping their gods, and you will sin against the LORD your God. </u></strong></p>
<p>19 When you lay siege to a city for a long time, fighting against it to capture it, do not destroy its trees by putting an ax to them, because you can eat their fruit. Do not cut them down. Are the trees of the field people, that you should besiege them? <sup>[<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deut%2020&amp;version=31#fen-NIV-5447b" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">b<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>]</sup> 20 However, you may cut down trees that you know are not fruit trees and use them to build siege works until the city at war with you falls.</p>
<p>(Deut Chapter 20)</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that even the leader who caused the problems that started the siege did not have a problem with the penalty.</p>
<p>And lastly, note how it says above from verses 16 to 18 that the cities which God gave the Israelites inheritance, you must put to death everyone in that city, leaving noone alive. From the above, we can conclude that the punishment given to the Banu Quraiza was a lenient punishment, meaning according to the Jewish Law, everyone in Banu Quraiza was to be executed, however only the warriors were executed. Agreeing with this view, Sheikh Abdullah Yusuf Ali writes:</p>
<p>“The Banu Quraiza (see last note) were filled with terror an dismay when Medina was free from the Quraish danger. They shut themselves up in the their castles about three or four miles to the east (or north east) of Medina, and sustained a siege of 25 days, after which they surrendered, stipulating that they would abide by the decision of their fate at the hands of Sa’d ibn Mu’az, chief of the Aus tribe, with which they had been in alliance.</p>
<p><strong><u>Sa’d applied to them the Jewish Law of the Old Testament, not as strictly as the case warranted.</u></strong> In Deut. Xx. 10-18, the treatment of the city “which is very far off from thee” is prescribed to be comparatively more lenient than the treatment of a city “of those people, which the Lord thy God gives thee for an inheritance,” i.e., which is near enough to corrupt the religion of the Jewish people. The punishment for these is total annihilation: “thou shalt save alive nothing that breatheth” (Deut. xx.16). <strong><u>The more lenient treatment for far-off cities is described in the next note. According to the Jewish standard, then, the Quraiza deserved total extermination- of men, women, and children. They were in the territory of Medina itself, and further they had broken their engagements and helped the enemy.</u></strong></p>
<p><strong><u>Sa’d judged them the milder treatment</u></strong> of the “far-off” cities which is thus described in the Jewish Law: “ Thou shalt smite every male thereof with the edge of the sword: but the women and the little ones, and the cattle, and al that is in the city, even al the spoil thereof, shalt thou take unto thyself; and thou shalt eat the spoil of thine enemies, which the Lord they God hath given thee” (Deut.xx.13-14). The men of the Quraiza were slain: the women were sold as captives of war: and their lands and properties were divided among the Muhajirs.”</p>
<p>(Source: The Qur’an: Text, Translation and Commentary by Abdullah Yusuf Ali, Footnotes # 3702-3704)</p>
<p>Now, we end by asking the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the Holy Prophet (S) was a mass murderer, then why didn’t he kill all of his enemies when he entered Makkah? In Makkah, he had enemies who did a lot worse to him, yet they were not killed</li>
<li>If the Holy Prophet (S) was really bent on destroying Banu Quraiza, then why didn’t he also just kill the women and children?</li>
<li>The Chiefs of Banu Quraiza had no problem with the penalty given to them, as it was according to their Jewish law!</li>
<li>If the Holy Prophet (S) wanted revenge, then why didn’t he kill Abu Sufyan? Remember, this is the same Abu Sufyan who fought against the Muslims numerous times, yet the Holy Prophet (S) forgave him, and Abu Sufyan became a Muslim.</li>
<li>If the Holy Prophet (S) had extreme hatred for Jews, and Banu Quraiza, then why did he previously ask for the Quraiza to renew their treaty with the Muslims? Obviously, if he wanted their land he wouldn’t have done that, <strong><u>nor would he have signed any treaty with the Jews</u></strong>, but he would’ve just waged war on them.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And with that, we end this part of the discussion, and move on to:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Accusation No.5</b></p>
<p>“A Ruthless Torturer”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The person Ali Sina is referring to over here (the person who was tortured), is Kinana al-Rabi, who was allegedly tortured in Khaibar because the Holy Prophet (S), wanted to know where the treasury was. Refuting this baseless story, Allama Shibli Nu’Mani writes:</p>
<p>“While describing the battle of Khaibar, the history writers have committed a serious blunder in reporting a totally baseless report, which has become a common place. It is said that the Prophet (Peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) had granted amnesty to the Jews on condition that they would not hide anything. When Kinana Ibn Rabi&#8217; refused to give any clue to the hidden treasures, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) ordered Zubair to adopt stern measures to force a disclosure. Zubair branded his chest with a hot flint again and again, till he was on the point of death. At last he ordered Kinana to be put to death and all the Jews were made slaves.</p>
<p><strong><u>The whole truth in the story is that Kinana was put to death. But it was not for his refusal to give a clue to the hidden treasure.</u></strong> He was put to death because he had killed Mahmud Ibn Maslama (also Muslima). Tabari had reported it in unambiguous words: “Then the Holy Prophet (Peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) gave Kinana to Muhammad Ibn Maslama (Muslima), &#8221; and he put him to death in retaliation of the murder of his own brother, Mahmud Ibn Maslama (Muslima).&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><u>In the rest of the report, both Tabari and Ibn Hisham have quoted it from Ibn Ishaq, but Ibn Ishaq does not name any narrator. Traditionalists, in books on Rijal, have explicitly stated that Ibn Ishaq used to borrow from the Jews stories concerning the battle of the Prophet (Peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). As Ibn Ishaq does not mention the name of any narrator whatsoever in this case, there is every likelihood of the story of having been passed on by the Jews.</u></strong></p>
<p>That a man should be tortured with burns on his chest by the sparks of a flint is too heinous a deed for a Prophet (Peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) who had earned for himself the title of Rahma&#8217;lil Alamin (Mercy for all the worlds). After all, did he not let the woman who had sought to poison him go scot free? Who would expect such a soul to order human body to be so burnt for the sake of a few coins.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, Kinana Ibn Rabi Ibn al-Huquaiq had been granted his life on the condition that he would never break faith or make false statements. He had also given his word, according to one of the reports, that if he did anything to the contrary, he could be put to death. Kinana played false, and the immunity granted to him was withdrawn. He killed Mahmud Ibn Maslama (Muslima) and had, therefore to suffer for it, as we have already stated on the authority of Tabari.&#8221;</p>

<p><b>Accusation No.6</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“A Terrorist (I have been made victorious through terror”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First of all, Ali Sina did not quote the whole hadith. The rest of the hadith says:</p>
<p><em>Sahih Al-Bukhari</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em>Volume 4, Book 52, Number 220: </em></p>
<p>Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;I have been sent with the shortest expressions bearing the widest meanings, <strong><u>and I have been made victorious with terror (cast in the hearts of the enemy)</u></strong>, and while I was sleeping, the keys of the treasures of the world were brought to me and put in my hand.&#8221; Abu Huraira added: Allah&#8217;s Apostle has left the world and now you, people, are bringing out those treasures (i.e. the Prophet did not benefit by them).</p>
<p>The hadith says clearly, that terror was cast in the hearts of the enemy, not literally that the Holy Prophet (S) was a terrorist!</p>
<p>Clearly, the Holy Prophet (S) being a “terrorist” (Astaghfirullah!), would go against the Holy Qur’an, as Allah SWT says:</p>
<p>Fight in the cause of God those who fight you, <strong><u>but do not transgress limits; for God loveth not transgressors</u></strong>. (Sura 2 Ayat 190)</p>
<p>Is Ali Sina so desperate, that he would even distort Islamic texts to suit his twisted interpretations?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Accusation No.7</b></p>
<p>“A Lecher”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A “lecher” means a man with strong sexual desire (<a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=lecher&amp;x=0&amp;y=0" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Source<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>).</p>
<p>Hilariously enough, Aisha (R), the man who Ali Sina and his loonies say was “raped”, refutes this claim:</p>
<p><em>Sahih Al-Bukhari</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em>Volume 1, Book 6, Number 299: </em></p>
<p>Narrated &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Al-Aswad:</p>
<p>(on the authority of his father) &#8216;Aisha said: &#8220;Whenever Allah&#8217;s Apostle wanted to fondle anyone of us during her periods (menses), he used to order her to put on an Izar and start fondling her.&#8221; <strong><u>&#8216;Aisha added, &#8220;None of you could control his sexual desires as the Prophet could.</u></strong>&#8221;</p>
<p>Sahih Muslim</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Book 006, Number 2439: </em></p>
<p>&#8216;A&#8217;isha (Allah be pleased with her) reported: Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) used to kiss (his wives) while fasting and embraced (them) while fasting<strong><u>; but he had the greatest mastery over his desire among you.</u></strong></p>
<p>Secondly, a man who didn’t have control over his desire (a man who was a lecher), would love to touch women wouldn’t he? However, this wasn’t the case with the Holy Prophet (S):</p>
<p><em>Sahih Muslim</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em>Book 20, Number 4602: </em></p>
<p>It has been narrated on the authority of &#8216;A&#8217;isha, the wife of the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him). She said: When the believing women migrated (to Medina) and came to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him), they would be tested in accordance with the following words of Allah. the Almighty and Exalted: &#8220;O Prophet, when believing women come to thee to take the oath of fealty to thee that they will not associate in worship anything with God, that they will not steal. that, they will not commit adultery. . .&#8221; to the end of the verse (lx. 62).<br />
Whoso from the believing women accepted these conditions and agreed to abide by them were considered to have offered themselves for swearing fealty. When they had (formally) declared their resolve to do so, the Messenger of Allah (may peace he upon him) would say to them: You may go. I have confirmed your fealty. <strong><u>By God, the hand of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) never touched the hand of a woman. He would take the oath of fealty from them by oral declaration. By God, the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) never took any vow from women except that which God had ordered him to take, and his palm never touched the palm of a woman. When he had taken their vow, he would tell them that he had taken the oath from them orally. </u></strong></p>
<p>However, Ali Sina can argue now and say ‘Well, what about Zaynab Bint Jahsh?”. According to an unauthentic report, the Holy Prophet (S) saw Zaynab Bint Jahsh changing her clothes, and he began to like her from there. Refuting this baseless story, Abdul Hameed Siddiqui says:</p>
<p>&#8221; So far as the fanciful stories and calumnies of the Orientalists are concerned, we can only say that these are so absurd that any one having even a grain of sense in him would unhesitatingly reject them as mere fabrications. William Muir and so may others like him state that the Prophet, having seen Zaynab by change through a half-open door, was fascinated by her beauty, and that Zayd having come to know of the leanings of his master, divorced her and then she was marred ti Muhammad. <strong><u>There is absolutely no truth in these stories which have been fabricated in this connection</u></strong>.&#8221;</p>
<p>(Source: The Life of Muhammad, by Abdul Hameed Siddique, Islamic Publications LTD, p. 214, bold and underlined emphasis ours)</p>
<p>Sheikh Hammudah Abdallati says:</p>
<ol start="6">
<li><u> <strong>Some of the Prophet&#8217;s marriages were for legislative reasons and to abolish certain corrupt traditions</strong>. Such was his marriage to Zaynab, divorcee of the freed slave Zayd. Before Islam, the Arabs did not allow divorcees to remarry. Zayd was adopted by the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) and called his son as was the custom among the Arabs before Islam. But Islam abrogated this custom and disapproved of its practice. Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) was the first man to express this disapproval in a practical way</u>. So he married the divorcee of his &#8220;adopted&#8221; son to show that adoption does not really make the adopted child a real son of the adopting father and also to show that marriage is lawful for divorcees. Incidentally, this very Zaynab was Muhammad&#8217;s cousin, and had been offered to him in marriage before she married Zayd. He refused her then, but after she was divorced he accepted her for the two legislative purposes: the lawful marriage of divorcees and the real status of adopted children. <strong><u>The story of this Zaynab has been associated in some minds with ridiculous fabrications regarding the moral integrity of Muhammad. These vicious fabrications are not even worth considering here </u></strong>(see Qur&#8217;an, 33: 36, 37, 40).</li>
</ol>

<p>Shabir Ally also <a href="http://www.islaminfo.com/new/detail.asp?ID=28" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">writes<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Is it true that the prophet (pbuh) had fallen in love with Zainab due to her beauty?</li>
<li>If that were true it would not detract from the veracity of the prophet. Muslims admit that he was a human being. It is not unnatural for a man to fall in love. The fact that he is a prophet does not rob him of his natural human emotions. In fact it is true that he loved his wives.</li>
</ol>
<p>However, it is not true that he fell in love with Zainab in the way that is claimed by some critics. They say that once the prophet visited Zaid, the husband of Zainab. Zaid was out at the time, and Zainab was combing her hair. The prophet was struck by her beauty and immediately left saying something to the effect that God changes the hearts of people. When Zaid learnt about this incident he offered the prophet that he would divorce Zainab in order that the prophet may marry her. Accordingly, he divorced her and the prophet married her.</p>
<p>Several things point to the lack of truth in this story. First, it is unlikely that the prophet (pbuh) was suddenly struck by Zainab&#8217;s beauty. Zainab was his cousin. He had known her since childhood. Why would she suddenly appear striking after she was already married to another?</p>
<p>Second, the prophet had arranged for her to get married to Zaid. If there was to be an attraction why did the prophet (pbuh) not encourage her to marry none but himself?</p>
<p>Third, the fact of the matter was that Zaid&#8217;s marriage proved to be an unhappy one. Zaid was a former slave and as such was held in low esteem in the eyes of Zainab. He mentioned to the prophet that he intended to divorce his wife. But the prophet advised him to keep his wife and avoid divorce.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Zaid intended to divorce his wife, Allah intended to marry her to the prophet. Eventually Zaid could maintain his marriage no longer. He divorced Zainab and Allah declared in his Glorious Book that he has wedded her to the prophet after the proper waiting period was over.</p>
<p>This marriage served more than one purpose. First, the prophet was responsible for arranging Zainab&#8217;s marriage to Zaid. In a sense, then, he was also indirectly responsible for the unhappiness she felt in her marriage. Her marriage to the prophet now provided her the honour she felt she deserved, and exonerated the prophet.</p>
<p>Second, Zaid had been adopted as the prophet&#8217;s son. Eventually, however, the Qur&#8217;an prohibited the practice of changing the parental identity of adopted persons. Zaid, then, was to no longer be called &#8220;son of Muhammad&#8221; but rather &#8220;a close friend.&#8221; The prophet&#8217;s marriage to the divorced wife of Zaid was a practical demonstration that the adopted relationship was not equal to a real blood-relationship. A man cannot marry the divorced wife of his real son but he can marry the divorced wife of his adopted son.</p>
<p>The abolishment of the age-old practice was a positive improvement for the adopted persons. People outside of Islam still continue this practice for their own benefit. They adopt children and rob them of their real identify, making them believe they are real children of the household in which they grow up. When such children realize the truth they suffer much disappointment and grief. The adoptive process continues for the selfish gain of the adoptive parents.</p>
<p>But is it not true that children sometimes need adoptive parents? Yes. But they also need to preserve their real identify. This is what Islam ensures. It is the responsibility of the entire community to help children in need. They should be taken in and nurtured but not confused with one&#8217;s own children.</p>
<p>The prophet&#8217;s marriage to Zainab was a bold measure to forever engrave in the minds of his followers that as much as people would resist change, some changes are worth the effort. Adoptive children should no longer be robbed of their real identities.</p>

<p>Question:<em> Al-Salâm `Alaykum. Some non-Muslims informed me of the story of Zaynab bint Jahsh and the verses of the Qur&#8217;ân which were revealed in this context. They said that the Prophet (peace be upon him) saw her once unveiled or something and it affected his heart and he said &#8220;Glory be to the one who moves our hearts!&#8221; Not long after the verses were revealed he was &#8220;convieniently&#8221; instructed by the Qur&#8217;ân to marry Zaynab, who had previously been the wife of his adopted son. Please explain this matter to me in detail. </em><em></p>
<p>Answered by the Fatwa Department Research Committee &#8211; chaired by Sheikh `Abd al-Wahhâb al-Turayrî</em><br />
As we shall see, the story of Zaynab is actually a good piece of evidence for the genuineness of the Prophet (peace be upon him), not for his insincerity like Orientalists and some Christian missionaries like to claim.</p>
<p>Zaynab bint Jahsh married the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) in 5 AH, when she was thirty-five years old, but only after her previous marriage, which had been arranged by none other than the Prophet (peace be upon him), had ended in divorce. Zaynab bint Jahsh was the cousin of the Prophet (peace be upon him). She came from one of the noblest families of Quraysh and was expected to marry a man with the same high social status.</p>
<p>The Prophet (peace be upon him) knew that piety and not social status was the primary consideration in marriage. He wanted her to marry Zayd ibn Hârith, a former slave of Khadîjah who the Prophet (peace be upon him) had freed and adopted as a son at the age of eight.</p>
<p>Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) had watched both Zayd and Zaynab grow up, and thought they would make a good couple and that their marriage would demonstrate that it was not who their ancestors were, but rather their religiousness that mattered. When the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) asked for her hand on behalf of Zayd, Zaynab’s family were shocked at the idea of her marrying a freed slave. Moreover, Zaynab had wanted to marry the Prophet (peace be upon him) and in fact her family had already offered to marry her to him.</p>
<p>At first Zaynab refused. Zayd also had reservations about the idea. However, when both he and Zaynab realized that there was no difference between what the Prophet (peace be upon him) wanted and what Allah wanted, they both agreed to the marriage. The Prophet provided a dowry for Zaynab on Zayd’s behalf, consisting of ten dinars, sixty dirhams, a veil, a cloak, a shirt, and a considerable amount of food and dates.</p>
<p>The marriage, alas, was not a success. Zaynab and Zayd proved to be incompatible for each other. After about a year, problems arose between them and Zayd complained about her to the Prophet (peace be upon him), who told him to stay with his wife and fear Allah.</p>
<p>Zayd asked the Prophet (peace be upon him) for permission to divorce Zaynab on more than one occasion, and although the Prophet (peace be upon him) advised Zayd not to divorce her, the divorce ultimately took place. The Prophet (peace be upon him) was then ordered by Allah to marry Zaynab, which he did in 5 AH.</p>
<p>The custom among the pagan Arabs was that an adopted son was like a person’s real son. He carried his adopted father’s name and inherited from him. Islam overturned that custom. Islam, we must understand, came to safeguard lineage. A man may adopt a child and take care of him, but that child cannot assume the lineage of his adopted father. He must retain his own family name.</p>
<p>Allah says: “Nor has He made your adopted sons your sons. Such is only your (manner of) speech by your mouths. But Allah tells you the Truth, and He shows the right way that is correct. Call them by the names of their fathers: that is more just with Allah. But if ye know not their father’s names, (then they are) your brothers in faith, or your wards.” [<em>Sûrah al-Ahzâb</em>: 4-5]
<p>By marrying Zaynab, the Prophet (peace be upon him) demonstrated in the clearest possible way that in Islam an adopted son is not the same as a natural son and that the guardian of an adopted son is permitted to marry a woman who was once married to that adopted son.</p>
<p>As for the verse itself, Allah says: “And (remember) when you said to him on whom Allah has bestowed grace and you have done a favor: ‘Keep your wife to yourself, and have fear of Allah.’ But you did hide in yourself that which Allah will make manifest, you did fear the people whereas Allah had a better right that you should fear Him. So, when Zayd had completed his aim with her, We gave her to you in marriage, so that there may be no difficulty to the believers in respect of the wives of their adopted sons when the latter have no desire to keep them. And Allah&#8217;s command must be fulfilled.” [<em>Sûrah al-Ahzâb</em>: 37]
<p>Ibn Jarîr narrated that `Â’ishah said: “If Muhammad were to have concealed anything that was revealed to him of the Book of Allah, he would have concealed the verse: ‘But you did hide in yourself that which Allah will make manifest, you did fear the people whereas Allah had a better right that you should fear Him’.”</p>
<p>Allah had already revealed to him that Zaynab bint Jahsh was going to be one of his wives. The Prophet (peace be upon him) did not speak about this matter. Then Allah revealed this verse.<br />
<strong><u><br />
This verse is clearly not the statement of a false Prophet making up verses trying to justify his desires</u></strong>. If the Prophet (peace be upon him) had ulterior motives, he could have gone about the matter in a much more subtle way and gotten what he wanted. Instead, he was put on the spot to do something he otherwise would not have wanted to do. The last way we would describe the situation of the Prophet (peace be upon him) here is to call it “convenient”.</p>
<p>This, however, was from Allah’s wisdom. If the Prophet (peace be upon him) had only said to the people that since adopted sons are not true sons, therefore men may marry the ex-wives of their adopted sons, it would not have had the same effect. Cultural practices and taboos are quite strong. For instance, as Muslims we all know that race and ethnicity are not important. However, we can see the problems that almost invariably arise when a Muslim girl wants to marry a Muslim boy from a different ethnic background. Therefore, the Prophet (peace be upon him) was commanded to marry her by way of example.</p>
<p>In the very next verse, Allah continues: “There can be no difficulty upon the Prophet in what Allah has obliged him to do. That was Allah&#8217;s way with respect to those who have gone before. And the command of Allah is a decree determined.” [<em>Sûrah al-Ahzâb</em>: 38]
<p>You mention the story that the Prophet (peace be upon him) saw Zaynab not fully dressed and became full of desire for her and said something indicating his desire to marry her. Then when Zayd divorced her, the verse was revealed “…you did hide in yourself that which Allah will make manifest, you did fear the people whereas Allah had a better right that you should fear Him…” According to the story, the thing that the Prophet (peace be upon him) was concealing in his heart was his desire to marry Zaynab.</p>
<p><strong><u>This story is a favorite of the Orientalists and is patently false. Please understand that many people concocted false stories and false hadîth for various reasons. That is the reason why the science of hadîth came about. Hadîth are graded as authentic (<em>sahîh</em>), good (<em>hasan</em>), weak (<em>da`îf</em>), rejected (<em>munkar</em>), and fabricated (<em>mawdû`</em>). This grading is not arbitrary and not according to anyone’s desires. A hadîth is graded based on a study of the chain of transmission by way of which it reached us. If a chain of transmission has gaps in it or contradictions or contains people who were known liars, then the hadîth is not acceptable.</u></strong></p>
<p>This story is baseless. It does not come to us with any chain of transmission worth mentioning. If we wish to believe this story, we might as well believe anything that people tell us.</p>
<p>This story is found in some books like al-Tabarî’s <em>Tafsîr</em>, but he relates it without any chain of transmission and starts by saying: “It was said that…”</p>
<p>For this reason, Ibn Kathîr does not mention it at all in his commentary of the Qur’ân. In his monumental work on history, <em>al-Bidâyah wa al-Nihâyah</em>, Ibn Kathîr discusses the marriage of Zaynab bint Jahsh and mentions that there were some strange stories circulated by the early scholars, but many of them were dubious and should be abandoned.</p>
<p>Of course, Orientalists and other enemies of Islam gleefully reproduce this story so they can have some dirt to throw on the Prophet (peace be upon him). <strong><u>They fail to mention that the story is baseless and has no claim to authenticity</u></strong>. They just pass it on as fact.</p>
<p>And lastly, Allama Shibli Nu’Mani writes:</p>
<p>&#8221; Tabari has it that once the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) visited the house of Zaid. Zaid was not at home, and Zainab was dressing herself. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saw her doing that, and turned back saying : &#8221; Glory to Allah, Most High and glory to him who turns the hearts&#8221;. Zaid came to know of it. He came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said, &#8221; I may divorce Zainab if you have come to like her.&#8221;</p>
<p>I have quoted that dirty narration with a pricking of conscience. But to report a blasphemy is not to commit a blasphemy. <u>This is the single report that forms the mainstay of authority for the Christain historians. But the poor fellows do not know what value this narration holds when critically viewed in the light of the principles set by the traditionalists. <strong>Tabari, the historian has taken this story from Waqidi, the well-known liar and fabricator</strong>. He coined such fictions to provide some sort of sanction for the licentiousness of the &#8216;Abbasid caliphs</u>.&#8221;</p>

<p><b>Accusation No.8</b></p>
<p>“A Misogynist”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A misogynist means a person who mistrusts or hates woman.</p>
<p>We can only say that Ali Sina is very foolish to accuse the Holy Prophet (S) of this, when the Holy Prophet (S) said:</p>
<p><em>Sahih Muslim</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em>Book 8, Number 3469: </em></p>
<p>Abu Huraira (Allah be pleased with him) reported Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying<strong><u>: A believing man should not hate a believing woman</u></strong>; if he dislikes one of her characteristics, he will be pleased with another.</p>
<p><em>Book 20, Number 4496: </em></p>
<p>It has been narrated on the authority of Ibn &#8216;Umar that the Holy Prophet (May be upon him) said: Beware. every one of you is a shepherd and every one is answerable with regard to his flock. The Caliph is a shepherd over the people and shall be questioned about his subjects (as to how he conducted their affairs). A man is a guardian over the members of his family and shal be questioned about them (as to how he looked after their physical and moral well-being). <strong><u>A woman is a guardian over the household of her husband and his children and shall be questioned about them (as to how she managed the household and brought up the children).</u></strong> <strong>(NOTE from Author: We should just stop right here! If the Holy Prophet (S) mistrusted woman, then he wouldn’t have said that women are a guardian over the household!) </strong>A slave is a guardian over the property of his master and shall be questioned about it (as to how he safeguarded his trust). Beware, every one of you is a guardian and every one of you shall be questioned with regard to his trust.</p>
<p><em>Book 4, Number 0884: </em></p>
<p>Salim narrated it from his father (&#8216;Abdullah b. Umar) that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: <strong><u>When women ask permission for going to the mosque, do not prevent them. </u>(NOTE from Author: Again, if the Prophet (S) mistrusted woman, why would he allow for them to enter the Masjid?)</strong></p>

<td>Anas bin Maalik Radiyallahu &#8216;Anhu reports: &#8220;No one was more beloved to the Sahaabah than Rasulullah Sallallahu &#8216;Alayhi Wasallam. <strong><u>When they saw him they did not stand up,</u></strong> <strong><u>knowing that he did not approve of it&#8221;.</u></strong></p>
<p>Commentary <strong><u>This was also the result of the complete humbleness of Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu &#8216;Alayhi Wasallam. Despite his high status and being the leader of both worlds, Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu &#8216;Alayhi Wasallam did not approve this</u></strong>. For this reason the Sahaabah, although possessing a great love for him, and knowing that he disapproved of it, did not stand up for him as is the requirement from this hadith. Rarely, due to their intense love, they stood up. A hadith has been mentioned in the Abu Daawud that Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu &#8216;Alayhi Wasallam was sitting with us in the masjid and talking. When he stood up, we all stood up till he went into the house. In this manner many ahaadith are narrated on this subject in the books of hadith, to the extent that in some ahaadith it has been strongly prohibited to stand up, and in some ahaadith it has been commanded to stand up for a few visitors. The &#8216;ulama differ in the permissibility of standing or not standing. The majority of the researchers say there is no contradiction, as there are many reasons for standing up, therefore different commands are mentioned in the ahaadith. Abul Walid bin Rashid says there are four ways and reasons for standing up. (a). Not permissible: This is standing up for such a person who likes this due to pride, that when he enters, people should stand up. (b). Makruh: To stand up for a person who has no pride, but it is feared if one is treated in this manner, pride will enter in that person. (c). Permissible: This is for that person this fear does not exist. (d). Mustahab: To stand up for a person who returns from a journey. To stand in happiness on one&#8217;s return. Imam Nawawi says: &#8221;It is mustahab to stand for the Ahlul-Ilm, Ahlul-Fadl and Ahlul-Sharaf&#8221;. Qaadi &#8216;Iyaad says the prohibition is for that standing, where a great person remains seated and the people continue standing in his presence. In the ahaadith where standing has been prohibited it is stated that: &#8221;One should not stand in the manner that the &#8216;ajami people stand for their leaders&#8221;. The research of Maulana Gangohi, which has been mentioned in the Badh-lul-Majhud through my late father, is that standing in itself is permissible, till such an obstacle does not appear which prohibits it. For example, a person will fall into mischief if one stands up for a certain person. Pride etc. will form in one, which will be detrimental to that person&#8217;s religious well-being. In the same manner, to stand up hypocritically, where there does not exist in the heart any feeling or respect, but for the sake of show and hypocrisy one stands up. Both these are not permissible, but, if one fears that by doing so, one will have to bear financial and physical consequences, then in this case it will be permissible to stand up to deter oppression.</td>

<p>Secondly, if Ali Sina wants to accuse the Holy Prophet (S) of being a narcissist, then he must apply the same way of thinking to the Biblical Prophets, specifically Isa (A). It is recorded in the Gospels that Isa (A) said:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=50&amp;chapter=11&amp;verse=25&amp;version=31&amp;context=verse" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">John 11:25<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></strong><br />
Jesus said to her, <strong><u>&#8220;I am the resurrection and the life.</u></strong> He who believes in me will live, even though he dies;</li>
</ul>
<p>Clearly, Ali Sina was desperate for an accusation, so he claims the Holy Prophet (S) was a narcissist, yet he is being unfair since one can claim that all of the Prophets were “narcissists”, because claiming you are a Prophet from God is itself a huge claim!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Accusation No.10</b></p>
<p>“A Thief and Plunderer”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brother Bassam Zawadi has thoroughly refuted this charge against the Holy Prophet (S) in the following links:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It should be noted that a thief and a plunderer would only steal if he wished to live a lavish lifestyle, and wanted to be rich. The Holy Prophet (S) did not live as a rich man, infact he distributed most of his wealth to the poor!:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Commentary The bed Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu &#8216;Alayhi Wasallam used, was at times the one made of leather as stated in the above hadith, or at times was one that was made of canvas, as will be mentioned in the following hadith. At times it was only a mat made of palm leaves. This subject has been narrated in many ahaadith that when the Sahaabah Radiyallahu &#8216;Anhum asked the permission to make a soft bed, Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu &#8216;Alayhi Wasallam used to reply: &#8216;What do I have in common with worldly comforts. <strong><u>My example is that of a traveller who after walking, stops under the shadow of a tree for a while to rest, and after sitting a while continues on his way&#8217;</u></strong>.

She returned home and made a bed in which she filled wool, and sent it to me for Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu &#8216;Alayhi Wasallam. When Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu &#8216;Alayhi Wasallam returned and saw the bed, he inquired, &#8216;What is this?&#8217; I replied: &#8216;A certain woman from the Ansaar came and after seeing the bed of Rasulullah Sallallahu &#8216;Alayhi Wasallam she made and sent this bed&#8217;. Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu &#8216;Alayhi Wasallam said; &#8216;Return it&#8217;. It looked good to me, and I did not feel like sending it back. Rasulullah Sallallahu &#8216;Alayhi Wasallam insisted that I send it back, and said: <strong><u>&#8216;I swear an oath if I wish Allah Ta&#8217;aala will line up mountains of gold and silver for me&#8217;.</u></strong> On this saying of Rasulullah Sallallahu &#8216;Alayhi Wasallam I returned the bed. Sayyidina &#8216;Abdullah bin Mas&#8217;ud Radiyallahu &#8216;Anhu says: &#8216;I once came to Rasulullah Sallallahu &#8216;Alayhi Wasallam. He was resting on a mat made of palm leaves, the marks of which could be seen on the mubaarak body of Rasulullah Sallallahu &#8216;Alayhi Wasallam.

We travelled the whole of the night, and when it was about to dawn, we got down for rest, and were overpowered (by sleep) till the sun shone. Abu Bakr was the first to awake amongst us. and we did not awake the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) from his sleep allowing him to wake up (of his own accord). It was &#8216;Umar who then woke up. He stood by the side of the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) and recited takbir in a loud voice till the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) woke up. When he lifted his head, he saw that the sun had arisen; he then said: Proceed on. He travelled along with us till the sun shone brightly. He came down (from his camel) and led us in the morning prayer. A person, however, remained away from the people and did not say, prayer along with us. After having completed the prayer, the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said to him: O, so and so, what prevented you from observing prayer with us? He said: Apostle of Allah! I was not in a state of purity. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) ordered him arid lie performed Tayammum with dust and said prayer. He then urged me to go ahead immediately along with other riders to find out water, for we felt very thirsty. We were traveling when we came across a woman who was sitting (on a camel) with her feet hanging over two leathern water bags. We said to her: How far is water available? She , said: Far, very far, very far. You cannot get water. We (again) said: How much distance is there between (the residence of) your family and water? She said: It is a day and night journey. We said to her: You go to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). She said: Who is the Messenger of Allah ? We somehow or the other managed to bring her to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and he asked about her, and she informed him as she had informed us that she was a widow having orphan children<strong><u>. He ordered that her camel should be made to kneal down and he gargled in the opening (of her leathern water-bag). The camel was then raised up and we forty thirsty men drank water till we were completely satiated, and we filled up all leathern water-bags and water-skins that we had with us and we washed our companions, but we did not make any camel drink, and (the leathern water-bags) were about to burst (on account of excess of water). He then said: Bring whatever you have with you. So we collected the bits (of estable things) and dates and packed them up in a bundle, and said to her : Take it away. This is meant for your children, and know that we have not its any way done any loss to your water.W hen she came to her family she said: I have met the greatest magician amongst human beings, or he is an apostle, as he claims to be, and she then narrated what had happened and Allah guided aright those people through that woman. She affirmed her faith in Islam and so did the people embrace Islam. </u></strong></p>
<p><em>Book 19, Number 4392: </em></p>
<p>This tradition has been narrated on the authority of Salama who said: We fought by the side of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) at Hunain. When we encountered the enemy, I advanced and ascended a hillock. A man from the enemy side turned towards me and I shot him with an arrow. He (ducked and) hid himself from me. I could not understand what he did, but (all of a sudden) I saw that a group of people appeared from the other hillock. They and the Companions of the Prophet (may peace be upon him) met in combat, but the Companions of the Prophet turned back and I too turned back defeated. I had two mantles, one of which I was wrapping round the waist (covering the lower part of my body) and the other I was putting around my shoulders. My waist-wrapper got loose and I held the two mantles together. (In this downcast condition) I passed by the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) who was riding on his white mule. He said: The son of Akwa&#8217; finds himself to be utterly perplexed. Where. the Companions gathered round him from all sides. the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) got down from his mule. picked up a handful of dust from the ground, threw it into their (enemy) faces and said: May these faces be deformed 1 <strong><u>There was no one among the enemy whose eyes were not filled with the dust from this handful. So they turned back fleeing. and Allah the Exalted and Glorious defeated them, and the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) distributed their booty among the Muslims. </u></strong></p>
<p><em>Book 19, Number 4394: </em></p>
<p>It has been narrated on the authority of Anas that when (the news of) the advance of Abu Sufyan (at the head of a force) reached him. the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) held consultations with his Companions. The narrator said: Abu Bakr spoke (expressing his own views), but he (the Holy Prophet) did not pay heed to him. Then spoke &#8216;Umar (expressing his views), but he (the Holy Prophet) did not pay heed to him (too). Then Sa&#8217;d b. &#8216;Ubada stood up and said: Messenger of Allah, you want us (to speak). By God in Whose control is my life, if you order us to plunge our horses into the sea, we would do so. If you order us to goad our horses to the most distant place like Bark al-Ghimad, we would do so. The narrator said: Now the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) called upon the people (for the encounter). So they set out and encamped at Badr. (Soon) the water-carriers of the Quraish arrived. Among them was a black slave belonging to Banu al-Hajjaj. The Companions of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) caught him and interrogated him about Abu Sufyan and his companions. He said: I know nothing about Abu Sufyan, but Abu Jahl, Utba, Shaiba and Umayya b. Khalaf are there. When he said this, they beat him. Then he said: All right, I will tell you about Abu Sufyan. They would stop beating him and then ask him (again) about Abu Sufyan. He would again say&#8217;, I know nothing about Abu Sufyan, but Abu Jahl. &#8216;Utba, Shaiba and Umayya b. Khalaf are there. When he said this, they beat him likewise. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) was standing in prayer. When he saw this he finished his prayer and said: By Allah in Whose control is my life, you beat him when he is telling you the truth, and you let him go when he tells you a lie. The narrator said: <strong><u>Then the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: This is the place where so and so would be killed. He placed his hand on the earth (saying) here and here; (and) none of them fell away from the place which the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) had indicated by placing his hand on the earth. </u></strong></p>
<p><em>Book 23, Number 5057: </em></p>
<p>Jabir b. &#8216;Abdullah reported: When the ditch was dug, I saw Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace he upon him) feeling very hungry. I came to my wife and said to her: Is there anything with you? I have seen Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) feeling extremely hungry. She brought out a bag of provisions which contained a sa&#8217;, of barley. We had also with us a lamb. I slaughtered it. She ground the flour. She finished (this work) along with me. I cut it into pieces and put it in the earthen pot and then returned to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) (for inviting him). She said: Do not humiliate me in the presence of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and those who are with him. When I came to him I whispered to him saying: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, we have slaughtered a lamb for you and she has ground a sa&#8217; of barley which we had with us. So you come along with a group of people with you. Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said loudly: O people of the ditch, Jabir has arranged a feast for you, so (come along). Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Do not remove your earthen pot from the hearth and do not bake the bread from the kneaded flour until I come. So I came and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) came and he was ahead of the people; and I came to my wife and she said (to me): You will be humbled. I said: I did what you had asked me to do. She (his wife) said: I brought out the kneaded flour and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) put some saliva of his in that and blessed It. He then put saliva in the earthen pot and blessed it and then said. Call another baker who can bake with you. and bring out the soup from it, but do not remove it from the hearth, and the guests were one thousand.<u> <strong>(Jabir said): </strong></u><strong><u>I take an oath by Allah that all of them ate (the food to their fill) until they left it and went away and our earthen pot was brimming over as before, and so was the case with our flour, or as Dahhak (another narrator) said: It (the flour) was in the same condition and loaves had been prepared from that. </u></strong></p>
<p><em>Book 23, Number 5059: </em></p>
<p>Anas b. Malik reported : Abu Talha sent me to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) in order to invite him (for meal). She had prepared a meal. So I came and found Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) along with some people. He looked at me, and I felt shy and said : Accept the invitation of Abu Talha. He (the Holy Prophet) asked the people to get up. Thereupon Abu Talha said : Allah&#8217;s Messenger, I have prepared something for you. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) touched (the food) and invoked blessings upon it, and then said : Let ten persons from my Companions enter (the house). He then said : Eat, and (in the meanwhile) brought out something from between his fingers for them. <strong><u>They then began to eat until they had their fill and then went out. He then asked ten more men (to have the meal) and they ate to their fill, and the ten persons went on getting in (and eating the food) and then getting out until none was left amongst them who had not got in and eaten to his fill. He then collected (the remaining part of the food) and it (the quantity of the food) was the same (as it had been prior to the serving of guests). </u></strong></p>
<p><em>Book 23, Number 5062: </em></p>
<p>Anas b. Malik reported this incident pertaining to the feast given by Abu Talha to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) with the addition of these words : &#8220;Abu Talha stood at the door (to welcome the honourable guest) until Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peacec be upon him) came there, He (Abu Talha) said to him : Allah&#8217;s Messenger, the thing (we intend to offer you as a meal) is small in quantity<strong><u>. Thereupon he (the Holy Prophet) said : Bring that, for Allah will soon bless it (and increase it).</u></strong></p>
<p><em>Book 30, Number 5662: </em></p>
<p>Mu&#8217;adh b. Jabal reported that he went along with Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) in the expedition of Tabuk and he (the Holy Prophet) combined the prayers. He offered the noon and afternoon prayers together and the sunset and night prayers together and on the other day he deferred the prayers; he then came out and offered the noon and afternoon prayers together. He then went in and (later on) came out and then after that offered the sunset and night prayers together and then said: God willing, you would reach by tomorrow the fountain of Tabuk and you should not come to that until it is dawn, and he who amongst you happens to go there should not touch its water until I come. We came to that and two persons (amongst) us reached that fountain ahead of us. It was a thin flow of water like the shoelace. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) asked them whether they had touched the water. They said: Yes. Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) scolded them, and he said to them what he had to say by the will of God. The people then took water of the fountain in their palms until it became somewhat significant and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) washed his hands and his face too in it, and then, took it again in that (fountain) and <strong><u>there gushed forth abundant water from that fountain, until all the people drank to their fill. </u></strong>He then said: Mu&#8217;adh, it is hoped that if you live long you would see its water irrigating well the gardens.</p>
<p><em>Book 5, Number 2333: </em></p>
<p>Zaid b. Wahb Jahani reported and he was among the squadron which wall under the command of Ali (Allah be pleased with him) and which set out (to curb the activities) of the Khwarij. &#8216;Ali (Allah be pleased with him) said: 0 people, I heard the Messeinger of Allah (may peace be upon him) say: There would arise from my Ummah a people who would recite the Qur&#8217;an, and your recital would seem insignificant as compared with their recital, your prayer as compared with their prayer, arid your fast,as compared with their fast. They would recite the Qur&#8217;an thinking that it sup- ports them, whereas it is an evidence against them. Their prayer does not get beyond their collar bone; they would swerve through Islam just as the arrow passes through the prey. If the squadron which is to encounter them were to know (what great boon) has been assured to them by their Apostle (may peace be upon him) they would completely rely upon this deed (alone and cease to do other good deeds), and their (that of the Khwarij) distinctive mark is that there would be (among them) a person whose wrist would be without the arm, and the end of his wrist would be fleshy like the nipple of the breast on which there would be white hair. You would be marching towards Muawiya and the people of Syria and you would leave them behind among your children and your property (to do harm). By Allah, I believe that these are the people (against whom you have been commanded to fight and get reward) for they have shed forbidden blood, and raided the animals of the people. So go forth in the name of Allah (to fight against them). Salama b. Kuhail mentioned that Zaid b. Wahb made me alight at every stage, till we crossed a bridge. &#8216;Abdullah b. Wahb al-Rasibi was at the head of the Khwarij when we encountered them. He (&#8216;Abdullah) said to his army: Throw the spears and draw out your swords from their sheaths, for I fear that they would attack you as they attacked you on the day of Harura. They went back and threw their spears and drew out their swords, and people fought against them with spears and they were killed one after another. Only two persons were killed among the people (among the army led by Hadrat &#8216;Ali) on that day. &#8216;Ali (Allah be pleased with him) said: Find out from among them (the dead bodies of the Khwarij) (the maimed). They searched but did not find him. &#8216;Ali (Allah be pleased with him) then himself stood up and (walked) till he came to the people who had been killed one after another. He (&#8216;Ali) said: Search them to the last, and then (&#8216;Ali&#8217;s companions) found him (the dead body of the maimed) near the earth. <strong><u>He (Hadrat &#8216;Ali) then pronounced Allah-O-Akbar (Allah is the Greatest) and then said, Allah told the Truth and His Messenger (may peace be upon him) conveyed it.</u></strong> Then there stood before him &#8216;Abida Salmani who said: Commander of the Believers, by Allah, besides Whom there is no god but He, (tell me) whether you heard this hadith from the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him<strong><u>). He said: Yes, by Allah, besides Whom there is no god but He. He asked him to take an oath thrice and he took the oath. </u></strong></p>
<p><em>Book 20, Number 4699: </em></p>
<p>It has been reported on the authority of Anas b. Malik that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) used to visit Umm Haram daughter of Milhan (who was the sister of his foster-mother or his father&#8217;s aunt). She was the wife of &#8216;Ubada b. Samit, One day the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) paid her a visit. She entertained him with food and then sat down to rub his head. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) dozed off and when he woke up (after a while), he was laughing. She asked: What made you laugh. Messenger of Allah? <strong><u>He said: Some people from my Umma were presented to me who were fighters in the way of Allah and were sailing in this sea</u></strong>. (Gliding smoothly on the water), they appeared to be kings or like kings (sitting) on thrones (the narrator has a doubt about the actual expression used by the Holy Prophet). She said : Messenger of Allah, pray to Allah that He may include me among these warriors. He prayed for her. Then he placed his head (down) and dozed off (again). He woke up laughing, as before. (She said) I said: Messenger of Allah, what makes you laugh? He replied: A people from my Umma were presented to me. They were fighters in Allah&#8217;s way. (He described them in the same words as he had described the first warriors.) She said: Messenger of Allah, pray to God that He may include me among these warriors<strong><u>. He said: You are among the first ones.<br />
Umm Haram daughter of Milhan sailed in the aea in the time of Mu&#8217;awiya. When she came out of the sea and (was going to mount a riding animal) she fell down and died. </u></strong></p>
<p><em>Book 31, Number 6003: </em></p>
<p>&#8216;A&#8217;isha reported that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) called his daughter Fatima (during his last illness). He said. to her something secretly and she wept. He again said to her something secretly and she laughed. &#8216;A&#8217;isha further reported that she said to Fatima: What is that which Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said to you secretly and you wept and then said to you something secretly and you laughed? <strong><u>Thereupon she said: He informed me secretly of his death and so I wept. He then again informed me secretly that I would be the first amongst the members of his family to follow him and so I laughed.</u></strong></p>
<p><em>Book 39, Number 6721: </em></p>
<p><strong><u>Abdullah said that five signs have (become things) of the past (and have proved the truth of the Holy Prophet) : (Enveloping) by the smoke, inevitable (punishment to the Meccans at Badr), (the victory of) Rome, (violent) seizing (of the Meccans at Badr) and (the splitting up of) the Moon. </u></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Secondly, Ali Sina would have to also call the Companions of the Holy Prophet (S), “mentally deranged”, since they witnessed these acts, and affirmed they happened, and witnessed other important things as well:</p>
<p>Sahih Muslim</p>
<p><em>Book 30, Number 5713: </em></p>
<p>Sa&#8217;d reported that on the Day of Uhud I saw on the right side of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and on <strong><u>his left side two persons dressed in white clothes and whom I did not see before nor after that, and they were Gabriel and Michael (Allah be pleased with both of them). </u></strong></p>
<p>Clearly, a man who was mentally deranged couldn’t perform the acts performed above, nor could he speak such accurate prophecies! And again, if the Holy Prophet (S) was hallucinating because he said he saw angels, then the Sahaba were also hallucinating. As shown above, one of the Companions of the Holy Prophet (S) saw Gabriel and Michael on the right side of the Holy Prophet (S).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thus, we have refuted <em>Alhumdulilah </em>Ali Sina’s “accusations”. Ali Sina now, as promised before, must remove his site, as his accusations have been disproved by the Grace of Allah SWT!</p>
<p>May Allah Almighty continue to shower prayers and peace, forever and always, upon the Best of Creation, the Holy Prophet Muhammad <em>Rasool Allah</em> <em>Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam</em>…………Ameen!</p>
<p>We have ended Part 2, continue on to Part 3.</p>

<p style="font-weight:400;">Surah 9:29 states that the people of the book are to pay the Jizyah in a statewhere they are <em>saaghiruun.</em> This word according to the Arabic experts means humiliation or disgrace. <strong>(See <em>Tafsir Al-Tabari</em>, Volume 12, page 96; Al-Qaradihi, <em>Kitab Al-&#8216;Ayn Lil-Khaleel</em>, Volume 4, page 372; Al-Jawhari, <em>Al-Sihaah Taaj Al-Lugha wa Sihaah Al-&#8216;Arabiyah</em>, Volume 2, page 713; Ibn Faaris, <em>Mu&#8217;jam Ma</em></strong><strong><em>qayees Al-Lugha</em></strong><strong>, Volume 3, page 290; Abi Mansur Al-Azhari, <em>Tahdheeb Al-Lugha</em>, Volume 3, page 50; Ibn Sayda, <em>Al-Muhkam</em><em>wal Muheet Al-&#8216;Adham</em>, Volume 5, page 422; Al-Matrazi, <em>Al-Mugharab fi Tarteeb Al-Mu&#8217;arab, </em>Volume 3, page 260; Ibn Manzur, <em>Lisaan Al-&#8216;Arab</em>, Volume 4, page 458; Al-</strong><strong>Qayyumi, <em>Al-Misbaah Al-Muneer fi Ghareeb Al-Sharh Al-Kabeer</em>, Volume 5, page 221)</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight:400;">
<p style="font-weight:400;">First let us understand what Jizyah is. Jizyah is the duty that a non-Muslim has to pay in order to live in the Muslim land. <strong>(Ibn Qudamah, <em>Al Mughni,</em>Volume 12, p. 756). </strong>N<em>ot all non-Muslims are required to pay the Jizyah tax. There are conditions which may exempt non-Muslims from paying the Jizyah tax, which could be summarized as follows:</em></p>
<p style="font-weight:400;">
<p style="font-weight:400;"><em>&#8211;</em><em>          </em><em>Women and children are excused absolutely</em></p>
<p style="font-weight:400;"><em>&#8211;</em><em>          </em><em>Handicapped, blind and old men, even if they are rich</em></p>
<p style="font-weight:400;"><em>&#8211;</em><em>          </em><em>Needy and mad-men</em></p>
<p style="font-weight:400;"><em>&#8211;</em><em>          </em><em>Day laborers, servants or wageworkers</em></p>
<p style="font-weight:400;"><em>&#8211;</em><em>          </em><em>A chronically ill-man even if he is rich</em></p>
<p style="font-weight:400;"><em>&#8211;</em><em>          </em><em>Religious people who keep themselves free for praying and worshipping, i.e. men of churches, cloisters and oratories</em></p>
<p style="font-weight:400;"><em>&#8211;</em><em>          </em><em>If a non-Muslim voluntarily participates in military service for protecting the country.</em></p>
<p style="font-weight:400;"><em>&#8211;</em><em>          </em><em>If the Islamic state becomes unable to protect non-Muslims, then they are legally exonerated from paying the tax. <strong>(See Ibnul Qayyim, </strong></em><em><strong>Ahkam Ahlul Dhimma,</strong></em><em><strong> Volume1, pp.8, 15 and al-Shafi&#8217;, </strong></em><em><strong>al-Umm¸ </strong></em><em><strong>pp. 172-1)</strong></em></p>
<p style="font-weight:400;">
<p style="font-weight:400;">Hence, we see that only those able bodied, financially able male adult non-Muslims who don&#8217;t volunteer to fight for the country are made to pay Jizyah tax if they live in the Muslim land.</p>
<p style="font-weight:400;">
<p style="font-weight:400;">Now the specific verse in question (i.e. 9:29) states that whomever is paying the Jizyah is doing it in a state of humiliation. But is this verse talking about a particular group of non-Muslims or all non-Muslims eligible for paying Jizyah in general?</p>
<p style="font-weight:400;">
<p style="font-weight:400;">Imam At-Tabari in his commentary has a narration:</p>
<p style="font-weight:400;">
<p style="font-weight:400;"><strong>حَدَّثَنِي مُحَمَّد بْن عُرْوَة , قَالَ : ثنا أَبُو عَاصِم , قَالَ : ثنا عِيسَى , عَنْ اِبْن أَبِي نَجِيح , عَنْ مُجَاهِد : { قَاتِلُوا الَّذِينَ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ بِاَللَّهِ وَالْيَوْم الْآخِر وَلَا يُحَرِّمُونَ مَا حَرَّمَ اللَّه وَرَسُوله وَلَا يَدِينُونَ دِين الْحَقّ مِنْ الَّذِينَ أُوتُوا الْكِتَاب حَتَّى يُعْطُوا الْجِزْيَة عَنْ يَد وَهُمْ صَاغِرُونَ } حِين أُمِرَ مُحَمَّد وَأَصْحَابه بِغَزْوَةِ تَبُوك</strong></p>

<p style="font-weight:400;">Muhammad ibn Arwa &#8211; Abu &#8216;Aasim &#8211; Eesa &#8211; Ibn Abi Najeeh &#8211; Mujahid said regarding Surah 9:29 &#8220;This is when Muhammad and his companions were ordered to march towards Tabuk&#8221; <strong>(Ibn Jarir al-Tabari, <em>Jami&#8217; al-bayan fi ta&#8217;wil al-Qur&#8217;an</em>, Commentary on Surah </strong><strong>9:29, <a href="http://quran.al-islam.com/Tafseer/DispTafsser.asp?l=arb&amp;taf=TABARY&amp;nType=1&amp;nSora=9&amp;nAya=29" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Source<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>)</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight:400;">
<p style="font-weight:400;">Imam Al-Qurtubi states:</p>

<p style="font-weight:400;">Our scholars (may Allah have mercy on them) have said: And what the Qur&#8217;an indicates is that the Jizyah is taken <strong><u>from those men who are fighting</u></strong>. Because He All Mighty said: &#8220;Fight those&#8221; until he said &#8220;Until they give the Jizyah&#8221; so this implies its obligation on those who are fighting. And it also implies that it is not to be applied on the slave even if he is a fighter, because he has no money and because Allah said &#8220;Until they give&#8221; and it is not said regarding those who have no money &#8220;Until they give&#8221;. There is a consensus amongst the scholars that the Jizyah is only to be taken from free adult men who have attained puberty <strong><u>and they are the ones who fight</u></strong> in exclusion to women, children, worshippers and lunatics who are mentally ill.<strong>(Abu &#8216;Abdullah Al-Qurtubi, <em>Tasfir al Jami&#8217; li-ahkam al-Qur&#8217;an, </em>Commentary on Surah 9:29, <a href="http://quran.al-islam.com/Tafseer/DispTafsser.asp?l=arb&amp;taf=KORTOBY&amp;nType=1&amp;nSora=9&amp;nAya=29" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Source<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>)</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight:400;">
<p style="font-weight:400;">It appears that according to the historical context of this verse the ones paying in a state of disgrace are those non-Muslims fighting the Muslims or non-Muslims whom the Muslims are intending to fight in battle (since no fighting eventually occurred in the March to Tabuk).</p>
<p style="font-weight:400;">
<p style="font-weight:400;">Shafi&#8217;i jurist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Mawardi" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Al-Mawardi<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> states that non-Muslims paying while they are<em>saaghiruun</em> means:</p>
<p style="font-weight:400;">
<p style="font-weight:400;">أن تجري عليهم أحكام الإسلام</p>
<p style="font-weight:400;">
<p style="font-weight:400;">To have the rules of Islam applied on them. <strong>(Al-Maawardi, <em>Al Haawi Al Kabeer, </em>Volume 10, page 985)</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight:400;">
<p style="font-weight:400;">
<p style="font-weight:400;">Imam Al-Shafi&#8217;i said:</p>
<p style="font-weight:400;">
<p style="font-weight:400;">والصغار أن يجرى عليهم حكم الاسلام</p>
<p style="font-weight:400;">
<p style="font-weight:400;">And <em>sighaar </em>is to have the rulings of Islam applied on them. <strong>(Al-Shafi&#8217;i,<em>Al-Umm</em>, Volume 4, page 219)</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight:400;">
<p style="font-weight:400;">
<p style="font-weight:400;">The fact that non-Muslims fighting Muslims have to pay Jizyah in recognition of the Muslims being victorious over them is understandably a sign of humiliation. Does this however mean that a normal non-Muslim wanting to live in an Islamic state who wants to pay Jizyah in order to avoid joining the military have to pay the Jizyah while feeling humiliated? There are some Muslim scholars who said that the non-Muslims paying the Jizyah must do so in a humiliating manner. These scholars are mistaken for theQuran said no such thing.</p>
<p style="font-weight:400;">
<p style="font-weight:400;">Imam Al-Nawawi, commenting on those who would impose a humiliation along with the paying of the <em>Jizyah</em>, said:</p>
<p style="font-weight:400;">
<p style="font-weight:400;"><strong>هذه الهيئة المذكورة أولا لا نعلم لها على هذا الوجه أصلا معتمدا وإنما ذكرها طائفة من أصحابنا الخراسانيين وقال جمهور الأصحاب تؤخذ الجزية برفق كأخذ الديون فالصواب الجزم بأن هذه الهيئة باطلة مردودة على من اخترعها ولم ينقل أن النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم ولا أحد من الخلفاء الراشدين فعل شيئا منها مع أخذهم الجزية وقد قال الرافعي رحمه الله في أول كتاب الجزية الأصح عند الأصحاب تفسير الصغار بالتزام أحكام الإسلام وجريانها عليهم وقالوا أشد الصغار على المرء أن يحكم عليه بما لا يعتقده ويضطر إلى احتماله</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight:400;">
<p style="font-weight:400;">
<p style="font-weight:400;">As for this aforementioned practice (<em>hay&#8217;ah</em>), I know of no sound support for it in this respect, and it is only mentioned by the scholars of Khurasan. <strong><u>The majority (<em>jumhur</em>) of scholars say that the <em>Jizyah </em>is to be taken with gentleness,</u></strong> as one would receive a debt (<em>dayn</em>). The reliably correct opinion is that this practice is invalid and those who devised it should be refuted. It is not related that the Prophet or any of the rightly-guided caliphs did any such thing when collecting the <em>Jizyah</em>.Al-Raafi&#8217;i may Allah have mercy on him said in the first part of his book on Jizyah that the more correct opinions amongst our companions is that<em>sighaar </em>means to abide by the rulings of Islam and to have them imposed on you. They said that the most severe form of <em>sighaar </em>that could occur is having something that they don&#8217;t agree with imposed on them. <em> </em><strong>(</strong><strong><em>Rawdat al-Talibin</em></strong><strong>, Volume </strong><strong>10, p.315-16)</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight:400;">
<p style="font-weight:400;">The great scholar, Ibnul Qayyim says:</p>
<p style="font-weight:400;">
<p style="font-weight:400;">This is groundless and the verse doesn&#8217;t imply that. It is not related that the Prophet or the companions acted like that. The correct opinion regarding this verse is that the word <strong><em>&#8220;saghâr&#8221; </em></strong>means &#8220;acceptance&#8221; by non-Muslims of the structure of the Muslim right and their payment of Jizya. <strong>(<em>Ahkam Ahlul Dhimma</em>, Volume 1, p. 23-24).</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight:400;">
<p style="font-weight:400;">Ibn Qudama also said the same thing <strong>(</strong><strong><em>Al-Mughni</em></strong><strong>, Volume </strong><strong>4, p.250).</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight:400;">
<p style="font-weight:400;">Notice that these scholars are saying that there is no evidence in imposing humiliation on those who pay Jizyah either from the acts of the Prophet (peace be upon him) or his companions.</p>
<p style="font-weight:400;">
<p style="font-weight:400;">Let&#8217;s provide some evidence showing that Jizyah is not to be paid in such a negative way.</p>
<p style="font-weight:400;">
<p style="font-weight:400;">The following narration states:</p>
<p style="font-weight:400;">
<p style="font-weight:400;">Once, during the reign of &#8216;Umar ibn al-Khattab, a Jizyah collector offered the taxes collected from the people to &#8216;Umar, who was upset by the large amount and asked him if he had burdened the people. He replied, &#8220;No, not at all! We took only the surplus and lawful taxes.&#8221; &#8216;Umar asked, <strong>&#8220;<u>Without any pressure or persecution?&#8221;</u></strong> The man replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; &#8216;Umar then said to him, <strong><u>&#8220;Praise be to Almighty Allah that the non-Muslim citizens have not been oppressed during my rule.</u></strong> <strong>(Ibn Salam, Imam Abu &#8216;Ubayd al-Qasim, <em>Al-Amwal</em>, p. 43</strong><strong>. Also see </strong><strong>Ibn Qudamah, <em>Al Mughni</em>, Volume 9, p. 290 &amp; Ibnul Qayyim</strong>,<strong><em>Ahkam Ahlul Dhimma, </em>Volume 1, p.139</strong><strong>)</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight:400;">
<p style="font-weight:400;">Notice that Umar ibn Al-Khattab while he was Caliph tried his best to ensure that those who were paying Jizyah were not doing so under any harsh conditions.</p>
<p style="font-weight:400;">
<p style="font-weight:400;">The scholars of Islam have formed a consensus in that it is permissible to take the Jizyah from Non-Muslims in the name of charity. For one time there were non-Muslims who insisted that Umar ibn Al Khattab agree to take the Jizyah from them after they called it charity and he accepted. <strong>(</strong><strong>Ibn &#8216;Abideen, <em>al-Hashiya</em>, Volume 3, p. 432. Ibn Rushd, <em>Bidaayat al Mujtahid</em>, Volume 6, p. 101. Ibnul Qayyim, <em>Zad Al Ma&#8217;aad</em>, Volume 3, page 643. Ibn Qudama, <em>Al Mughni</em>, Volume 10, p. 590-91). </strong>What does this tell us? This tells us that Muslims are supposed to take the feelings of the non-Muslims into consideration. If the non-Muslims feel more satisfied to pay the Jizyah in the name of charity for the sake of feeling better about the whole ordeal, then Muslims are to do that. How on earth does this show that Islam teaches that all non-Muslims are to pay Jizyah in humiliation?</p>
<p style="font-weight:400;">
<p style="font-weight:400;">In conclusion, non-Muslims paying Jizyah in a state of <em>saaghiruun </em>is nothing that non-Muslims should take offensively if they are not paying it in recognition of defeat in a battle. If non-Muslims who don&#8217;t fight Muslims want to live in an Islamic state peacefully and want to pay the Jizyah in order to avoid joining the military, may do so in an uplifting manner.</p>
