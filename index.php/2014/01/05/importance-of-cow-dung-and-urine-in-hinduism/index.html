<p>Importance of Cow dung and urine in Hinduism</p>
<p>by Sulaiman Razvi</p>
<p>Cow is so revered in Hinduism that even its wastes are considered sacred. In support for consumption of Cow dung and urine, Hindus often say that it has the ability to cure many diseases. They have even launched products made from cow urine and dung. In a bizarre way, Hindu argue that after a research they have found gold in cow urine and dung hence it is very healthy and useful for consumption, no reliable research team has ever found such thing in cow’s urine or dung. If advising others to consume cow dung and urine is justified in this manner, then will the apologist eat his own faeces? As recent study has found that gold exists in human faeces [<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/25/poop-gold-human-waste-metals_n_6936262.html?ir=India&amp;adsSiteOverride=in" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">1<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/feces-contains-gold-worth-millions-224632128.html" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">2<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>]. The most awkward thing is that Hindutva forces are shamelessly promoting such outdated and useless religious commandment.</p>

<h1><span id="Cow_Dung_and_Urine_harmful_for_consumption_proves_Science"><a id="post-7115-Panchagavya-Harmful"></a>Cow Dung and Urine harmful for consumption proves Science</span></h1>
<p>Cow urine is harmful for consumption and can even lead to death. Studies concerning ingesting individual components of Panchagavya, such as cow urine, have shown no positive benefit, and significant side effects, including convulsion, depressed respiration, and death.</p>
<p>“Results of the experiments show that both “cow’s urine” and nicotine cause excitement in low doses and cause convulsion and/or death in higher doses. Both also depress respiration. The role of “cow’s urine” toxicity following administration to patients with convulsion and the possible aetiology of the neurological sequelae of “cow’s urine” poisoning are discussed.”<br>

<p>Citrobacter, Klebsiella, Proteus, E. coli and Shigella were also the most recovered bacterial species from urine of cows in this study.<br>

<p>A 1976 study on dogs showed that repeated administration of cow urine concoction as used in Nigerian folk medicine, resulted in hypotension and tachypnea, and also death.<br>

<p>“Cow’s urine” concoction (CUPR) is a traditional remedy for convulsive seizures in Nigeria. Its administration has been associated with severe poisoning, sometimes with a fatal outcome in Nigerian children. Recently, we showed that several of the components of the concoction are toxic. We have demonstrated in the present study certain cardio-respiratory effects of cow’s urine concoction in dogs. On the cardiovascular system, an initial bradycardia followed by tachycardia and a biphasic effect on blood pressure characterized by a fall followed by a rise were demonstrated. Progressive hypotension following repreated administration of CUPR was also shown in all experimental dogs. On the respiratory system, a short period of respiratory arrest and/or respiratory depression, followed by tachyponoea with associated hypoventilation of the lungs, were observed. The possible explanations for the observed cardiorespiratory effects of the concoction were discussed. On the basis of our findings, an hypothesis is advanced for the possible mechanisms of the neurological sequelae and/or death following cow’s urine poisoning.<br>

<p>19 die due to leptospirosis this year<br>
“While the quantity of urine discharged by mice is just around 1 to 3 ml, cattle like cows, buffaloes and bullocks, which are reared by people in rural areas, pass around half to 3 litre of urine. In cattle sheds, the urine and dung is mixed and the floor, if it is kuccha, tends to remain damp, helping the bacteria breed and infect people,” said a senior health department official.</p>
<p>“The volume of cattle urine is more and people come into contact with it more often,” he explained.<br>

<p>“But medical doctors warn they can be harmful, despite being “all natural,” and critics argue that the government is promoting alternative medicines without seeking to test their efficacy and develop them into modern treatments.”<br>
“Doctors complain that patients come to them when their cancer has progressed too far for surgery or when hepatitis has already resulted in liver failure, because they’ve spent weeks or months in the care of alternative practitioners. Meanwhile, as an ongoing outbreak of dengue fever in New Delhi has illustrated, the public health system is creaking its way toward abject failure, says Dr. Sumit Ray, vice chairman of critical care at the capital’s Sir Ganga Ram Hospital.”<br>

<h1><span id="Reverence_of_Cow_Dung_and_Urine_in_Hindu_scriptures"><a id="post-7115-Reverence"></a>Reverence of Cow Dung and Urine in Hindu scriptures</span></h1>
<p>Cow dung and urine are praised in the following way in the Hindu scriptures,</p>
<p>“Pañca-gavya, the five products received from the cow, namely milk, yogurt, ghee, cow dung and cow urine, are required in all ritualistic ceremonies performed according to the Vedic directions. Cow urine and cow dung are uncontaminated, and since even the urine and dung of a cow are important, we can just imagine how important this animal is for human civilization…” A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada on Srimad Bhagavatam 8.8.11 <a href="http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_8.8.11" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_8.8.11<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti 99.11 “(I reside) in fresh cow dung, in a noble elephant in rut…”</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti 23.61 In the urine of cows dwells the Ganges, prosperity (dwells) in the dust (rising from their couch), good fortune in cow dung, and virtue in saluting them. Therefore should they be constantly saluted.</p>
<p>Agni Purana 230.1 “Pushkara said:- Cereals, paddies except those of the black species, cotton, hay, cowdung and coins are auspicious things and ensure the success of his mission, when looked as by a man just at the time of leaving his house.” Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Agni Purana 292.1-5 “…Bad luck never sticks to the place, which has once been sprinkled over with the urine of a cow. Even a particle of water, dropped down from the horn of a cow engaged in scratching her body, is possessed of the virtue of expiating all sins. A man having had a bad dream in the night, should take a composition, consisting of the dung and the urine of a cow, as well as of curd, cream, etc., prepared out of the thickened milk of a cow, mixed with the the substance known as the Rochona. The urine of a cow is endued with the efficacy of neutralising all sorts of poison, and of keeping off the undesired intrutions of demons and monsters on the household…” Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Devi Bhagvatam 11.11 Narayana said :—” O Narada! I am now talking of the three kinds of ashes; hearing this even destroys one’s sins and brings in good fame. When a cow evacuates her dung ,just as the cow dang leaves her and is far from reaching the ground, one should catch it with one’s hand and this cowdung burnt with “Sadyojatadi i.e. Brahma Mantra” becomes ashes which are called “Santika Bhasma,” i.e. ashes producing peace. Before the cowdung is about to reach the ground, the devotee should take it with his hand and uttering the six lettered Mantra, he is to burn the cowdung. The ashes from this are called ” Paustik Bhasma” i.e. ashes leading to nourishment. If the cowdung be burned with the Mantra “Haum,” the ashes of this are called “Kamala Bhasma” i.e., ashes leading to the granting of desires.</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 267.5-6 “Cow’s urine should be placed after reciting the sacred Gayatri cowdung by reciting ‘Gandhadvara,’ milk after reciting ‘Apyayasva,’ curds by reciting ‘Dadhikravna,’ clarified butter after reciting ‘Tejost’, etc.,’ water after reciting ‘Tad Devasya-tva etc.’ All these are mixed and then Kusa is thrown therein. Thus Panchagavya is prepared. The idol should be bathed with this Panchagavya of the jar thus filled in.” Tr. Various Sanskrit Scholar, edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>Markandeya Purana 29.8 …her [cow’s] ordure and urine are tranquillity and prosperity…</p>
<p>Mahabharata 13.78 One should never feel any repugnance for the urine and the dung of the cow.</p>
<p>Panchgavya or five products of cow are claimed to be very useful for human beings, they are said to be boon given by god. The definition of Panchagavya given by Hindu scriptures is as follows,</p>

<p>Parasara Smriti 11.27-28 “Holy and sin absolving is Panchagavyam, which is a compound of cow’s urine, cow dung, cow’s milk, curdled cow milk, cow butter in a clarified state, and the washings of Kusa grass. The urine of a black cow, the cowdung of a white cow, the milk of a copper coloured cow, and the curdled milk of a red cow should be collected (for the compound, Panchagavyam).” Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Garuda Purana 1.222.63-66 “The constituents of Pancagavya are as follows: Milk taken from a gold colored cow, the cow dung of a white cow, urine of a copper colored cow, clarified butter of the milk of a blue cow and the curd of the milk of a black cow. Water added should be consecrated by Kusa grass. Eight Masas of cow’s urine, four Masas of dung, twelve Masas of milk, ten Masas of curd and five Masas of ghee form the correct proportion. This Pancagavya removes all impurities.” Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>

<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 10.6.19-21 Thereafter, mother Yaśodā and Rohiṇī, along with the other elderly gopīs, waved about the switch of a cow to give full protection to the child Śrī Kṛṣṇa. The child was thoroughly washed with cow urine and then smeared with the dust raised by the movements of the cows. Then different names of the Lord were applied with cow dung on twelve different parts of His body, beginning with the forehead, as done in applying tilaka. In this way, the child was given protection. The gopīs first executed the process of ācamana, drinking a sip of water from the right hand. They purified their bodies and hands with the nyāsa-mantra and then applied the same mantra upon the body of the child.</p>
<p>Agni Purana 299.19-23 “…The monstress Putana, attacks child that has just completed its first month of life. The disease which is ascribed to her, is ushered in by the following symptoms: The child moans like a crow. The respiration becomes difficult. The body emits a smell like that of urine, and the eye-lids remain completely closed, or half shut. The remedy consists in washing the body of the child with the urine of cow, and in fumigating it with the vapours of Godanta…” Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>

Sadhvi Pragya, who is also an accused in the 2008 Malegaon blasts case, is a breast cancer survivor. “I was a patient of cancer and I cured myself by consuming cow urine and panchgavya-mixed ayurvedic herbs,” she said.<br>
Panchagavya is a mixture of five cow products and used in traditional Hindu rituals. These are cow dung, urine, milk, curd and ghee. These are mixed in proper ratio and then allowed to ferment. Sadhvi Pragya called the cure scientific, saying, “I am a living example of its effectiveness.”<br>

Very much pleased by the sound of other people’s ankle bells, They used to follow these people as if going to Their mothers, but when They saw that these were other people, They became afraid and returned to Their real mothers, Yaśodā and Rohiṇī. Dressed with muddy earth mixed with cow dung and cow urine, the babies looked very beautiful, and when They went to Their mothers, both Yaśodā and Rohiṇī picked Them up with great affection, embraced Them and allowed Them to suck the milk flowing from their breasts. While sucking the breast, the babies smiled, and Their small teeth were visible. Their mothers, upon seeing those beautiful teeth, enjoyed great transcendental bliss.</p>

<p>Parasara Smriti 11.28. Urine of the cow, cow-dung, milk, curd, and ghee, these five are the five articles derived from a cow. They, and water in which the kusa grass has been dipped, — are themselves pure, and therefore purify the sin.</p>
<p>Garuda Purana 1.105.60 “O Brahmins, the Pancagavya consists of cow’s milk, ghee, curd, urine and dung. The expiator should swallow these and fast for the next day. This is called Santapana Krcchra.” Tr. Board of scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 11.166. (To swallow) the five products of the cow (pankagavya) is the atonement for stealing eatables of various kinds, a vehicle, a bed, a seat, flowers, roots, or fruit.</p>

<p>Mahabharata 13.81 One should, indeed, always confer happiness on them. One should, always reverence kine and worship them, with bends of one’s head.

One should for three days drink the hot urine of the cow.</p>

<p>Garuda Purana ch 231 “Articles of Indian bell metal, smelled by kine or defiled by the touch of residue of a Sudra’s meal, or by the contact of a dog or a crow, are purified by being rubbed with ten kinds of ashes.

[32] By taking food in a vessel belonging to a Sudra or in a broken plate, one should get himself purified with the Panchagavya after fasting for a day and night.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Apastamba Samhita 2.2 “Having drunk water in a Prapa, or that lieing accumulated in a forest or in the furrows of a ploughed field, as well as that which is flowing out of a pond, or is owned by a Svapak or a Chandala, one should regain one’s purity by drinking Panchagavyam. [5] Having drunk water out of, or bathed in, a well or tank, caused to be excavated by another, one should regain one’s purity by drinking Panchagavyam.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Angiras Samhita 1.9-10 “If he on any occasion, touched by a Sudra who has not washed his mouth after taking meals, he should bathe and recite [the Gayatri] and shall become purified by [fasting for] half a day. If a Vipra is [similarly] touched by a Vaisya, a dog or a Sudra, he shall after fasting for one night become purified with the Panchagavya” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dath</p>
<p>Samvarta Samhita verses 197 “By associating with an outcast for a month or a half, one would become purified, in half-a-month, by living upon barley and the urine of cow.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>

<p>Samvarta Samhita verses 182 “By drinking well water contaminated by a Chandala’s vessel, one becomes purified by living on barley and the urine of a cow for three nights.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p><strong>Shudra not allowed to drink Panchagavya</strong></p>
<p>Apastamba Samhita 5.4 “Sudras should not be enjoined to drink Panchagavyam, inasmuch as they are not privileged to utter any Mantras. A Sudra, guilty of any delinquency, should regain his purity by confessing it to a Brahmana and by making gifts.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti 54.7 “If a Sudra drinks Panchagavyam, and if a Brahmana drinks wine, both of them will go to the great howling hell (Maha-rauravam).” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Shudra is not even allowed to drink milk of a tawny cow,</p>
<p>Garuda Purana 4.22 “The Śūdra who studies the letter of the Vedas, who drinks the milk of the tawny cow, who wears the sacred thread or consorts with Brāhmiṇ women. [23] Having come all along the path the sinful reach the abode of Yama, and having come, by command of Yama, the messengers hurl them into that river again.” Tr. Ernest Wood and S.V. Subrahmanyam</p>

<p>Vishnu Smriti 23.56 A house is purified by scouring it with a broom and plastering the ground with cow dung, and a manuscript or book by sprinkling water over it. Land is cleansed by scouring, by plastering it with cow dung.</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 5.124. Land is purified by (the following) five (modes, viz.) by sweeping, by smearing (it with cowdung), by sprinkling (it with cows’ urine or milk), by scraping, and by cows staying (on it during a day and night).</p>

In support for consumption of Cow dung and urine, Hindus often say that it has the ability to cure many diseases. They have even launched products made from cow urine and dung. In a bizarre way, Hindu argue that after a research they have found gold in cow urine and dung hence it is very healthy and useful for consumption, no reliable research team has ever found such thing in cow's urine or dung. If advising others to consume cow dung and urine is justified in this manner, then will the apologist eat his own faeces? As recent study has found that gold exists in human faeces [1, 2]. The most awkward thing is that Hindutva forces are shamelessly promoting such outdated and useless religious commandment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n \r\nHindus obsession with Cow Dung and Urine\r\nReaders may like to go through the following links,\r\n\r\nCow urine for your skin?

Studies concerning ingesting individual components of Panchagavya, such as cow urine, have shown no positive benefit, and significant side effects, including convulsion, depressed respiration, and death.\r\n\r\n\"Results of the experiments show that both \"cow's urine\" and nicotine cause excitement in low doses and cause convulsion and\/or death in higher doses. Both also depress respiration. The role of \"cow's urine\" toxicity following administration to patients with convulsion and the possible aetiology of the neurological sequelae of \"cow's urine\" poisoning are discussed.\"\r\nhttps:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/1179485\r\n\r\nCitrobacter, Klebsiella, Proteus, E. coli and Shigella were also the most recovered bacterial species from urine of cows in this study.\r\nhttps:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3032614\/\r\n\r\nA 1976 study on dogs showed that repeated administration of cow urine concoction as used in Nigerian folk medicine, resulted in hypotension and tachypnea, and also death.\r\nhttp:\/\/trstmh.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/71\/2\/127.short\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nCow's urine can also be a source of harmful bacteria and infectious diseases, including leptospirosis.\r\nhttps:\/\/www.cambridge.org\/core\/journals\/epidemiology-and-infection\/article\/leptospiral-carrier-state-and-seroprevalence-among-animal-population-a-cross-sectional-sample-survey-in-andaman-and-nicobar-islands\/BDBBA5C65A8BCCA5960647EC98E9BF0B\r\n\r\n\r\n“Cow's urine” concoction (CUPR) is a traditional remedy for convulsive seizures in Nigeria. Its administration has been associated with severe poisoning, sometimes with a fatal outcome in Nigerian children. Recently, we showed that several of the components of the concoction are toxic. We have demonstrated in the present study certain cardio-respiratory effects of cow's urine concoction in dogs. On the cardiovascular system, an initial bradycardia followed by tachycardia and a biphasic effect on blood pressure characterized by a fall followed by a rise were demonstrated. Progressive hypotension following repreated administration of CUPR was also shown in all experimental dogs. On the respiratory system, a short period of respiratory arrest and\/or respiratory depression, followed by tachyponoea with associated hypoventilation of the lungs, were observed. The possible explanations for the observed cardiorespiratory effects of the concoction were discussed. On the basis of our findings, an hypothesis is advanced for the possible mechanisms of the neurological sequelae and\/or death following cow's urine poisoning.\r\nhttp:\/\/trstmh.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/71\/2\/127.short-accessdate=29\r\n\r\n19 die due to leptospirosis this year\r\n\"While the quantity of urine discharged by mice is just around 1 to 3 ml, cattle like cows, buffaloes and bullocks, which are reared by people in rural areas, pass around half to 3 litre of urine. In cattle sheds, the urine and dung is mixed and the floor, if it is kuccha, tends to remain damp, helping the bacteria breed and infect people,\" said a senior health department official.\r\n\r\n\"The volume of cattle urine is more and people come into contact with it more often,\" he explained.\r\nhttp:\/\/www.dnaindia.com\/mumbai\/report-19-die-due-to-leptospirosis-this-year-2125261\r\n\r\n\"Observations of CUC poisoning in man and experimental animals showed that the main effects of CUC are severe depression of respiration, cardiovascular system, the central nervous system and hypoglycaemia.

Manmatha Nath Dutt\r\n\r\nShudra is not even allowed to drink milk of a tawny cow,\r\n\r\nGaruda Purana 4.22 “The Śūdra who studies the letter of the Vedas, who drinks the milk of the tawny cow, who wears the sacred thread or consorts with Brāhmiṇ women. [23] Having come all along the path the sinful reach the abode of Yama, and having come, by command of Yama, the messengers hurl them into that river again.” Tr. Ernest Wood and S.V. Subrahmanyam\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\ntop\r\nHouse\/Kitchen should be purified\/plastered with Cow Dung\r\nVishnu Smriti 23.56 A house is purified by scouring it with a broom and plastering the ground with cow dung, and a manuscript or book by sprinkling water over it. Land is cleansed by scouring, by plastering it with cow dung.\r\n\r\nManu Smriti 5.124. Land is purified by (the following) five (modes, viz.) by sweeping, by smearing (it with cowdung), by sprinkling (it with cows' urine or milk), by scraping, and by cows staying (on it during a day and night).\r\n\r\nShiva Purana, Rudrasamhita 2, Sristi Khanda I 13.18 \"In a clean place washed and smeared with cowdung, the devotee shall take his seat, O Brahmins.\" Tr. J.L. Shastri\r\n\r\nSrimad Bhagavatam 7.11.26 \"A pious lady should keep the house clean by sweeping and plastering (with cowdung), and decorating it with auspicious coloured diagrams and pictures on the floor.\" Tr. G.V. Tagare\r\n\r\n''The place that has been plastered with a thin coating of mud and dung properly mixed together looks nice. If the kitchen, wherein food is... The kitchen, therefore, should be properly plastered with mud and dung, swept and kept thoroughly clean.'' by Swami Dayanand Saraswati, Satyarth Prakash Ch 10, p.325, Tr. Dr. Chiranjiva Bhardwaja\r\n\r\nParasara Smriti 6.47. But an earthen vessel filled with an oily substance need not be thrown away. The house should be washed with cow-dung and water, mixed together.\r\n\r\nManu Smriti 5.122. Grass, wood, and straw become pure by being sprinkled (with water), a house by sweeping and smearing (it with cowdung or whitewash), an earthen (vessel) by a second burning.\r\n\r\nMahabharata 13.146 That woman who always takes a pleasure in rising at early down, who is devoted to the discharge of all household duties, who always keeps her house clean, who rubs her house daily with cowdung, who always attends to the domestic fire (for pouring libations upon it)\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\ntop\r\n\r\n ","publisher":{"@id":"#Publisher","@type":"Organization","name":"VedKaBhed.Com Fast Server","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"\/wp-content\/themes\/jannah\/assets\/images\/logo@2x.png"}},"sourceOrganization":{"@id":"#Publisher"},"copyrightHolder":{"@id":"#Publisher"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"\/index.php\/2014\/01\/05\/importance-of-cow-dung-and-urine-in-hinduism\/","breadcrumb":{"@id":"#Breadcrumb"}},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Ved Ka Bhed","url":"\/author\/solomon246rezarprotonmail-com\/"},"image":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/word-image-60.jpeg","width":1926,"height":1680}}</script>
