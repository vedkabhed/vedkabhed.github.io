In fact it's also doubted whether this could be called as concept of \"God\" or not. It seems, the very definition of God was not fathomed by Moolshankar. The conception of God in Protestant Hinduism itself is sufficient to prove the false nature of this cult. It's quite amazing to see how Moolshankar describes his god (Ishwar), he extensively stresses on his gods omnipresence, omnipotence, omniscience, formlessness and shapelessness. Nowadays we see fanatical zealots, hate-monger's like Agniveer, propagating his works, as these (Mahendra Pāl, Agniveer -now claims to be a 'Movement') being a blind-followers of Moolshankar like other protestant Hindus. Here we'll try to demystify the concept of God in Protestant Hinduism and show how rational and coherent it is.\n<\/p>\n<p>The protestant Hindus propagandise, their cult to be \"Monotheistic\" in nature and claim their scriptures teach worship of One God exclusively, this is what people are usually informed by the protagonists, but the reality of their belief will be evident in the following passages.Vedas only teach polytheism not monotheism. We read, Moolshankar (Dayānanda Saraswati)writing in his book (Satyarth Prakāsh), that the Vedas strictly preach and teach Monotheism and this was his belief  too. In fact the translator Durgā Prasād writes in the book (Satyarth Prakāsh's translation, pg. 60) that \"Satyarth Prakash – an exposition of the monotheism and civilization of the ancient Aryans.\" It seems that his (Moolshankar's) blind -followers truly believe that this book (Satyarth Prakāsh) deals with monotheism, nonetheless this so-called monotheism of protestant Hinduism will be scrutinized to truth. a.1) Is Ishwar the Creator? Protestant Hindus go around talking of so-called one god \"Ishwar\" who is the creator.  But what they really mean by the \"Creator\"? Let's see. First, Moolshankar wrote that God is the creator of all, then contradicts himself, by stating that Paramātmā , Ātmā  and Prakriti , are beginning-less and uncreated! So how come God is (Ishwar) \"creator of all\"? We shall probe into this case, and expose some amazingly incoherent beliefs of protestant Hindus. Mooshankar wrote (quotes Yajurveda 36:3) – \"…Omniscient, Sustainer and Ruler of the Universe, Creator of all, Eternal…\" - It wasn't slip of pen that Moolshankar (Dayānanda Saraswati) wrote \"Creator of all\" but this has been stated in other parts of Satyarth Prakāsh too. For instance, Moolshankar quotes Rigveda - \"…I am the controller of the universe, know me alone as the Creator of all…\" - Similarly, stated by Moolshankar (Dayānanda Saraswati) on pg. 207(Tr.Chiranjiva), \"…If He were localized to some particular place, He could never be Omniscient, Inward Regular of all, Universal Controller, Creator of all, Sustainer of all and the Cause for resolution….\" So we read, at first Moolshankar states that \"Ishwar (God) is Creator of all\"and later he goes on to state that there are 3 entities which are Uncreated, Eternal, Beginning-less. The three entities which are uncreated eternal, beginning-less – here Moolshakar (Dayānanda Saraswati)quotes \"SHWETA SHWATER UPNISHAD, 4: 5\"and states: \"The prakriti, the soul and God, all of them, are uncreated. They are the cause of the whole universe.\" – As he (Moolshankar) states in Satyarth Prakash- \"How many entities are eternal or beginningless?    A-Three – God, the soul, and the prakriti (matter).                                                                                      - According to Moolshankar's (and protestant Hindu) theology there are 3 beginning less, uncreated ,immortal entities – 1)      Paramātmā (Ishwar/God) 2)      Prakriti (Primordial matter) 3)      Ātmā (Human Souls,note -we'll be using plural i.e. Human Souls for clarity) This philosopher's stance (uncreated primordial matter) adopted by Moolshankar is self-contradictory in many areas, for instance Moolshankar seem to claim in monotheistic Vedas, but this stance of co-eternal prakriti (Primordial matter) and Ātmā (Human Souls) explicitly disqualifies prostestant Hindusim from the claim of monotheism, as this undermines and infringes the absolute monotheistic nature of God and reduces Him (God) to an position of an artificer –a Demiurge. Now, if this is the case (co-eternal, uncreated Prakriti and Ātmā) then, why did Moolshankar write God is the \"creator of all\"? This is an explicit contradiction, which is easily noticeable. It's understood that God is uncreated but what of \"Prakriti\" (Primordial matter) and \"Ātmā\" (human souls)? Who created them? And if God isn't their creator – as these 2 things are uncreated (as per protestant hindu belief), then why is God or in protestant Hindu terminology \"Ishwar\" \"Parameshawar\" called \"Creator of all\". This is quite contradictory and absurd. In fact this is a white lie. Agniveer, the fanatic hate-monger wrote – Q: Who created the world? Ishwar or someone else? A: Ishwar created the world in same manner as an engineer creates a machine. He is thus the'engineer' of the world. But like engineer, He used existing 'raw material' or Nature (matter/ energy approximately) to create the world. &nbsp;\nQ: Did Ishwar not create Nature as well? A: No, Nature or 'raw material' is eternal (beginningless and endless) like Ishwar. Being eternal, there is no cause for origin or destruction of Ishwar or Nature.\" - We learn that Protestant Hindu God 'Ishwar' is the 'engineer of the world', who uses 'raw material' to create the world, this stance of protestant Hindu's is quite fanciful, and irrational as it insults the concept of God itself in its entirety. I wonder why, don't these protestant Hindus call Ishwar, an 'engineer' when they believe so? So, this incapability of Ishwar is also affirmed and stated by the hate-monger Agniveer, I wonder how a rational person (assuming Agniveer is rational- I know it's very farfetched, but let's give him benefit of doubt and assume) can accept such gibberish, incoherent theological views! In fact this absurdity is also supported by Vedas - &nbsp;\n\"God, the Lord of final emancipation is in truth the creator of all that hath been and what yet shall be; and what grows on earth.\"                                                   – \"Worship Him, Whose beautiful sacrifice, wealth, strength, and mighty glory are enjoyed by the Heaven and Earth; Who is the creator of all beings, the Embodiment of great happiness, All-pervading and Supplier of food.\"                                      – It's to be noted that, the second verse states in an interrogative way \"Who is the creator of all beings… All-pervading\" Here again this statement is contradictory to the belief's of Protestant Hindus, in order to prove this lets first define \"beings\". And\"being\"means - being noun  a person or thing that exists or the state of existing - So 'being' means – a person or thing that exists or the state of existing. So we ask doesn't 'Prakriti' (Primordial Matter) exist? Doesn't 'Ātmā' (Human Souls) exist? Yes of course they do, as stated by Moolshankar. Then how can 'Ishwar' be the 'creator of all beings' when Prakriti and Ātmā are uncreated? Then is 'Ishwar' creator of them? No, as stated by Moolshankar, then why is it stated in the above quoted verse of Yajurveda that the \"All-prevading\" (i.e Ishwar) is the \"Creator of all beings\"? This is nothing but pure contradiction which is repeated in many of the Vedic verses.Later, in the article we'll see that Ishwar is not the creator of 'time'…etc Questions which mavericks like us would like to ask – a) How can 'Ishwar' be 'creator of all' (or 'creator of all beings') as claimed by protestant Hindus when, they themselves believe(state) in uncreated-ness of 'Prakriti' and 'Ātmā'? b) Who created 'prakriti', if 'Ishwar' – the Protestant Hindu God, didn't?  c) Who created 'Ātmā', if 'Ishwar' – the Protestant Hindu God, didn't?  This ameliorates exposure of the reality of protestant Hindu theology in the eyes of Truth-Seeker's. Now coming to some amazing facts, which will really expose the distortions (of meanings) from the protestant Hindu cult. Moolshankar wrote in Satyarth Prakāsh Ch.1 pg. 5 (quoting Kaivalya Upanishad) –\n<\/p>\n<p>\"He is called Brahma – the Creator of the Universe…\"\n<\/p>\n<p>And, in the footnotes the translator Dr. Chiranjiva comments\"The word Creator used in the sense of Maker as according to Vedic Philosophy there is no such thing as creation or the evolution of something out of nothing.\" Also we find Agniveer the Hate-Monger, Islāmophobe confessing and admitting the fact that – &nbsp;\n\"GOD NEVER CREATED US. And because God never created us, He also never destroys us. Creation and destruction of soul is NOT the scope of work of God. Thus, just as God is beginningless and endless, so are we. We have existed along with God always and shall continue to do so.\" – Now astonishingly, we learn, that in the so-called \"Vedic Philosophy\" there's nothing like \"Creation out of nothing\" and that the word \"Creator\" is used in \"Sense of Maker\". One would be tempted to question, Why not simply use the word 'Maker' why use the word 'Creator'? The answer to it is simple, to fool people and blind-followers (protestant Hindus).As how can one believe in a 'God' who is not the Creator but just the Maker or Fashioner of it. So we are left with the philosophical excreta of philosopher's brains that's \"there is no such thing as creation or the evolution of something out of nothing.\" And we also see how the hate-monger Agniveer tries to get his incoherent, unintelligible belief, explained with few nonsensical words like \"Creation and destruction of soul is NOT the scope of work of God\", we wonder 'What's the Scope of God'? Does scope even apply on GOD?Is God something like created beings that 'Scope' applies to him, or is Agniveer trying to anthropomorphise God and apply Human-related characteristics/attributes to Him? By the way, is God(according to Agniveer)some sought of professional , for instance an Accountant , who's been asked to handle Software engineers post , and cries out saying \"It's out of my scope of work!!\" It's pretty disgusting to see people insulting God by using such vernacular (like \"Creation and destruction of soul is NOT the scope of work of God\"). We do not think that such a statement needs a refutation (still we shall expose such irrationalities for those people seeking truth); such obscurely illogical statement arises out of pure ignorance of monotheism and pure blind following (as in case of Agniveer). We will be dealing with the reasons and causes of such irrational statement in our next subsection, wherein those reasons and causes shall be refuted and debunked. It will be worthwhile and of immense benefit to state one verse from the Holy, Noble Qur'ān wherein Allāh Azz wa Jall (the alone worthy of worship, One true Almighty God) says which means –\n<\/p>\n<p>        \"Do they attribute as partners to Allāh those who created nothing\"                                                                                                    –\n<\/p>\n<p>So true! See the misery and state of these Protestant Hindus, how they worship those who create not! These poor protestant Hindus set up partners (by worshipping Ishwar who creates nothing) with Allāh who alone is the true Almighty God, the creator of Al -'Alamîn . We would ask our reader's and especially the truth seeker's to see how these protestant Hindus have wronged themselves by worshipping false God , who is unable to create anything. For now we'll leave the reader's and truth-seeker's with this verse and let them ponder upon it and contemplate whether they are on truth or falsehood, now coming back - So this only proves that Ishwar (Protestant Hindu God) is Incapable of – 1)      Creating Prakriti (Primordial Matter) and Ātmā (Human Souls). 2)      Destroying, Annihilating Prakriti and Ātmā. This sufficiently proves that Incapability is an attribute (characteristic) of 'Ishwar'. This also proves that 'Ishwar' isn't omnipotent or All-Powerful. But Moolshankar seems to state something opposite to it, he states (quoting Rigveda) – \"…Mayest thou (Vishnu) O Omnipresent and (Urukrama) Omnipotent Being, shower Thy blessings all around us…\"                                                                                                                               - So what does \"Omnipotence\" mean? Let's have it defined – Omnipotent        adjective formal having unlimited power; able to do anything - All the words, like Omnipotent, All-Powerful, creator are just empty words used by Moolshankar &amp; Co. for deluding people and poor blind-followers of his (Moolshankar). As we read earlier that , if Ishwar isn't able to create \"Prakriti\" and \"Ātmā\" then this inability of creating things renders him free of the title \"Creator\" and  also this raises questions on Ishwar's \"Omnipotence\". These questions will be dealt, in the later part of the section, for now let's see whether Moolshankar , believed in \"Omnipotence\" of \"Ishwar\"?(We've seen a quote above , now let's see his belief in detail). Moolshankar was and ardent believer of \"Ishwar's\" Omnipotence (at least he made it seem so), we read in various places in Satyarth Prakāsh, where he claims God to be Omnipotent, All-Powerful. \"Vayu: the Omnipotent\nBeing,\"                                                                                                                                  – (Satyrath Prakash Ch 1, pg.71 Tr. Durga Prasad) &nbsp;\n\"The verse means: May (bhavatu) the Infinite Spirit (Parmatma) who is Omnipotent\"                                                                                                                                                                – (Satyrath Prakash Ch 1, pg.77 Tr. Durga Prasad) \"O Lord Thou Who art the Protector of the universe and the Veda, and art Omnipotent, Omnipresent…\" -(Satyarth Prakash Ch. 10,pg.368 Tr. Dr.Chiranjiva Bhardawaja ) Hence, we learn that Moolshankar did believe in Omnipotence of his Ishwar, but was this Omnipotence true? Or what did Moolshankar mean by Omnipotence? As stated earlier \"Omnipotence\", \"All-Powerful\" et al. are just empty words for Moolshankar, this will be evident below. In fact, Moolshankar goes on to distort the meanings of words like \"All-Powerful\" and \"Omnipotence\" to fit his beliefs, for instance \"Omnipotence\" according to him does not mean \"having unlimited power; able to do anything\". Agniveer the fanatical Protestant Hindu-extremist, hate-monger also affirms and believes in the so-called All-Powerful Ishwar, he wrote –\n<\/p>\n<p>\"Finally, Yajurveda 40.8 lists the properties of Ishwar as follows:\n<\/p>\n<p>Paryagat – Omnipresent,\nShukram – All-powerful,\"\n<\/p>\n<p>-   Elsewhere too, with vigor same is stated by this mere hate- monger –\n<\/p>\n<p>\"But Vedic Ishwar is truly all-Powerful…\"\n<\/p>\n<p>                                                                 – But according to him (Moolshankar) it's (omnipotence's meaning) something different, this is what he answered when a questioned, regarding Ishwar's inability of creating \"prakriti\". Q – God being Omnipotent, He can also create prakriti – the primordial matter – and the soul. If He cannot, He cannot be called Omnipotent. A. – We have explained the meaning of the word Omnipotent before. But does Omnipotent mean one who can work even the impossibilities. If there be one who can do even such impossible things as the production of an effect without a cause, then can He make another God, Himself die, suffer pain, become dead and inert, inanimate, unjust, impure and immoral or not? Even God cannot change the natural properties of things as heat of the fire, Fluidity of liquids and inertness of earth, etc. His laws being true and perfect, He cannot alter them.Omnipotence, therefore, only means that He possesses the power of doing all His works without any help.                                        - Primarily, it's to be noted that Moolshankar states he has explained the meaning of word Omnipotence, earlier in the book, on which we'll expound soon. Secondarily, we learn that according to Moolshankar omnipotence isn't the ability to do anything but only means \"the power of doing all His works without any help.\"(This is moolshankar's proposed definition). We see Moolshankar, distorting the meaning of Omnipotence in order to hide the fact that Ishawar isn't omnipotent or All-Powerful and this factuality is impossible to grasp for any believer (theist) in God, hence in order to delude people and his own self Moolshankar indulges in namely two things – Distortion of meaning and Sophistry. a.2) Is Ishwar Omnipotent (All-Powerful) and what does Omnipotence mean to protestant Hinduism? Now coming to the \"explanation\" of the meaning of Omnipotence by Moolshankar, which he stated to have explained earlier, wherein he uses sophistry in order prove his beliefs, which is quite amusing(hilarious) to read. In order to, prove that his (Moolshankar) meaning ('proposed definition') of 'Omnipotence' and conception of God is correct,Moolshankar disgustingly, indulges in sophistry. These question explain the situation to us – Is God All-powerful or not? A. – Yes, He is, but what you understand by the word All- powerful is not right. It really means that God does not require the least assistance from any person in all His works such as Creation, Sustenance and Dissolution of the Universe, and administration of Divine Justice. In other words, He does all His works with His own infinite power.                                      –  But we believe that God can do whatever He likes. There is no one above Him. A.     - What does He like? If you say that he likes and can do all things, we ask – \"Can God kill Himself?\" Or\"can He make other Gods like Himself, become ignorant, commit sins such as theft, adultery and the like? Or can He be unhappy?\" Your answer can only be in the negative, as these things are opposed to the nature and attributes of God; hence your contention, that God can do all things, does not hold good. Our meaning only, therefore, of the word All-powerful is true.                                                                   –  &nbsp;\nWe would also like to quote the hate monger, Islāmophobe Agniveer, so as to expose his ignorance, this Islāmophobe wrote - Q: Is Ishwar Omnipotent or All-Powerful? A: Yes, He is omnipotent. But that does not mean He can do whatever He wants. Doing whatever one may want is sign of indiscipline. On contrary, Ishwar is most disciplined. Omnipotence means that Ishwar does not need help of any other entity to conduct His duties – creation, management, destruction of universe. He is self-sufficient to conduct His duties. But He would act only as per His duties. For example,He will not kill Himself to create another Ishwar. He cannot make Himself an idiot. He cannot do theft or dacoity etc. -   &nbsp;\nThese (above) emphasized (by us) interrogative questions were asked by Moolshankar (&amp; Agniveer) to prove that his god (Ishwar)is not omnipotent (as per the meaning of the word) in true sense but has limited omnipotence. Moolshankar (so does Agniveer)seems very eager and zealous to prove that his god (Ishwar) is not at all omnipotent in true sense, but merely is called so. Moolshankar seems to be trying pretty hard, to prove his definition of \"Omnipotence\" to be true, but drastically fails at it, as will be evident. Now coming to his silly, hilarious questions: Firstly it's to be noted that Moolshankar, states (assumes) that the answers to the questions will be in negative, I wonder why didn't the questioner reply or why wasn't his reply (in detail or were these questions and answers made-up by himself, that's the case most probably) stated in Satyarth Prakash . Now replying to the insinuations and irrationality of Moolshankar and Agniveer. We would be pleasured to ask – Do these attributes or qualities/characteristics (Killing, ignorance, theft, adultery…etc.) befit Almighty God or belong to him? Of course not, Moolshankar also agrees by writing \"these things are opposed to the nature and attributes of God\". Now, we would like to question, how come these things are applied to God? Also, it's should be noted that these are qualities of humans and not of God, so how can these be applied to God or how could one judge God's capability in terms of these  acts? Same deviant principle of judging and understanding God in human context and human attributes is followed by Agniveer , our readers need not get surprised after all Agniveer is a mere blind-follower of Moolshankar .We read Agniveer stating \"Doing whatever one may want is sign of indiscipline. On contrary, Ishwar is most disciplined\" What a show of irrationality and illogicalness! This statement of Agniveer show's us his 'conceptualization' of God. What Agniveer states here is pure irrationality, God the Almighty is the creator of Discipline and hence he is not subjected to it , we wonder how could Agniveer even think of such a thing , he judges God in the light of human attributes and behavior! Hence the so-called argument that doing whatever one wants is a sign of indiscipline is only applied to humans and not to God Almighty. Also, another aspect should be pointed out is that God Almighty by nature and definition is the Most-Perfect or All-Perfect, hence the one who's perfect by nature needs no discipline at all, on contrary it's only those who have the tendency to get deviated (like humans, animals…etc) and indulge in non-disciplinary acts and behavior need discipline and are subjected to it or judged by it. This understanding of God in scales of human attributes and behavior, only show the anthropomorphic tendencies of Agniveer and his gross incoherency. To enlighten Agniveer we would present here, what Allāh Azz wa Jall (the only One True Almighty God) says which means:                                          \"There is nothing like Him(Allāh)\"                                                                                                     – This verse proves and shows the obligation of rejection and negation of resembling God the Most Perfect, with His creation or anything else. This is what we Muslims believe, in fact this is the most basic and fundamental principle which we Muslims are taught at first, hence as stated above, there is no similitude, resembling, likeness of God , so are his attributes , hence we ask Protestant Hindus, to ponder upon it and we think and Agniveer too comes under Protestant Hinduism, so we would also ask him to humbly ponder upon this truly, great and glorious principle which every theist should believe in. This principle will help Agniveer get rid of his anthropomorphic tendencies – understanding God in light of Human attributes/context/behavior, as this verse makes clear that there is nothing like unto God. We've also read what Moolshankar wrote; in fact both Agniveer and Moolshankar suffer from same disease of sophism, and irrationality . Questions (like 'Can God Kill Himself '…et al.) asked by Moolshankar and Agniveer are similar , hence we would refute and debunk the questions (insinuations) asked by Moolshankar, and indirectly Agniveer's questions will be debunked too. Now coming back to the 'questions' of Moolshankar – And we would now again like to ask \"Why would God need to steal something, when he is the creator of that thing and can create it?\" Yeah, only the Protestant Hindu god (Ishwar) would need to steal things as he is not the Creator but only the efficient cause (acc. to Protestant Hindu Theology), as prakriti (Primordial Matter) is eternal and uncreated like God , so it is possible that he could steal a bit from prakriti (Primordial Matter).So why would God Almighty need to steal? It's ridiculous of Moolshankar to ask such hilarious and incoherent questions and this only adds up to his ignorance. Now scrutinizing a bit more, Moolshankar also questions 'can He become ignorant, commit sins such as theft, adultery and the like' this is really hilarious and irrational. By scrutinizing and observing questions similar and those asked by him we, learn a lot of Moolshankar's state of mind and the basis of his belief system. We'll see questions similar to Moolshankar's first to show the real problem in his approach and then refute his questions. Basically what Moolshankar is trying to ask \"If God can do anything, can He make it impossible for him-self to do something ?\" Such question's becomes even clearer when we examine a related question: \"Can God create an uncreated being?\" The problem here is that the questioner has already defined the being to be uncreated and then proceeds to ask for something that contradicts that definition. The problem is in the questioner's terms, not any lack in God's potential. The same is true when asking God to make a circle with four sides. Having already provided a definition of a circle that could never include a four-sided figure, such a question is absurd. Something is certainly self-contradictory here, but it is the questioner's terminology and not the omnipotence of God. The answer to the question (Can God kill Himself?) of Moolshankar is-. Well, killing (death) isn't ability; it's the inability to live moreover death is a creation (death is created and God's uncreated) of God, so it's quite irrational to ask such questions as creation can never overcome the creator in any sense. The immortal cannot die because that defies His attribute of immortality. Similarly, the omnipotent cannot create a task that He can't complete because such a task is merely a figment of one's imagination and could not exist, not because He is incapable.Can God make 1=2? Well if 1=2, then it wouldn't be 1! So the idea is self-contradictory, not God. The question also reminds us of the idea of what happens when an immovable rock meets an unstoppable force? The two things cannot exist in the same universe. Likewise, if God exists then all things which contradict His attributes are imaginary, non-existent and impossible. They are forever bound to the realm of imagination and cannot be brought into existence. Similar is the question (of Moolshankar) \"can He make other Gods like Himself\" .In fact the phrase \"can He make other Gods like Himself\" is explicit sophism or false/invalid argument, and is a contradiction in terms, because the mere fact that something is created ('can He make') means that it cannot be a God. This question is like asking could God create \"a god who is not a god?\" It is self-evident that the answer can only be: The power of God has nothing to do with that, because the idea that something can be a god and not a god is illogical and is irrational, and the power and might of God has nothing to do with irrationalities. In fact all the questions asked by Moolshankar and Agniveer are just instances of sophism and are self-contradiction – -          \"Can God kill Himself?\" -          \"Can He (God) make other Gods like Himself, become ignorant, commit sins such as theft, adultery and the like? -          \"Can He (God) be unhappy?\" God is eternal and uncreated by nature and definition hence God killing himself is irrational and contradictory in terms , also Killing (or dying) is a human's act or attribute, like Humans kill humans, Humans die. So what we see is Moolshankar first defining God to be uncreated and eternal then posing a sophistic questions which are purely contradictory and irrational , Moolshankar is only contradicting himself. As for creating God then again God is Uncreated and eternal, hence what is created cannot be god so it's irrational and spurious even to think of such absurdities. Same for questions like, 'can God become Ignorant', God by nature is All-wise and All-Knowledgeable hence again its contradiction and irrational, also things like ignorance, adultery sins, theft are all instances of human behaviors, attributes or actions and in no way can they ever be applied to God or used to judge God. Same with being \"Unhappy\", being happy and unhappy are human attributes/characteristics and traits, not of God ,also these things contradict God's attribute of Perfection(All-Perfect) hence God by nature being perfect is not subject to such things and state, such queries are but contradiction. As God exists hence all things which contradict His attributes are imaginary, non-existent and impossible. They are forever bound to the realm of imagination and cannot be brought into existence. Also the Power, Majesty and Might of Almighty God have nothing to do with Irrationalities. Hence we see Moolshankar using sophistry (false-invalid arguments) to prove that \"Omnipotence\" in fact means \"the power of doing all His works without any help.\"  And not \"able to do anything\" which in fact, is the true and right definition of being Omnipotent. Concluding, it will be beneficial to note, how Moolshankar uses his irrationality and Sophistry to prove things. Like first he defines Ishwar as uncreated and beginning-less and then questions whether \"God can kill himself?\" that's so self-contradictory and irrational of him. Again and again he repeats his irrational questions like \"can He(God) make other Gods like Himself\" , same here he as defined and stated God to be \"Uncreated\" , then ask can God makeother Gods? This is what happens when you swallow the excreta of philosopher's brain. This is pure irrationality and this will be evident, even to novice or amateur, let's see what a mathematician opines about such ridiculous questions. Mathematician's Opinion – Summing up the section, I would like to present a short quote from a revert to Islām – Dr. Jeffrey Lang, a mathematician  (an ex-atheist)] – \"If God is all-powerful, can He become a man, terminate His existence, tell a lie, be unjust, or create a stone too heavy for even Him to move? These somewhat silly riddles most often arise from imposing unnecessary and contradictory assumptions on certain attributes of God or by assigning unwarranted additional attributes to Him.\" - We are pretty sure that every intelligent, sane and unbiased person will believe such 'questions' to be silly, and illogical. It would also be beneficial (concisely) to state the reasons why Moolshankar delved into such absurdities which are totally untenable. It's necessary to note that Moolshankar was reluctant enough to apply (judge and understand) human attributes to God in order to prove his point; also his conception of God in his mind was somewhat anthropomorphic in essence. This also shows how Moolshankar swallowed the excreta of philosophers and atheists' (in fact, sophistry was chiefly used by atheist to disprove God and his existence) brain in order to forward his claims, delude people from the straight path and malign and corrupt monotheism. Islāmic Stance – To enlighten people about Islām and present a true picture of Islām (which the Hate-monger's and quacks like Mahendra Pāl, Agniveer cowardly and hypocritically don't do, due to their bias, prejudice and hate for Islām.) we'll shortly and very briefly present Islāmic point of view here, very concisely for our readers and truth Seekers – Who's the Creator? Allāh the Most-Merciful says which means, \"That is Allāh, your Lord, the Creator of all things, Lā ilāha illā Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He). How then are you turning away (from Allāh, by worshipping others instead of Him)?\"                               – See you O, protestant Hindus your only One True Almighty God (Allāh) states that He is the Creator of all things; still you turn away from Him and worship false-god? And in another verse of the Noble, Holy Qur'ān, Allāh Azz wa Jall says which means, \"Such is Allāh, your Lord(none has the right to be worshipped but He), the Creator of all things.So worship Him (Alone), and He is the Wakîl (Trustee, Disposer of affairs or Guardian) over all things.\" – Again theonly One True Almighty God (Allāh) states that He alone is the Creator of all things and calls every of his creation to worship Him alone. Is God (Allāh) Omnipotent or All-Powerful? Allāh the Most-Merciful says which means, \"Truly, Allāh is Ever Most Powerful, All-Wise.\"          – \"Verily, Allāh is Ever Oft-Pardoning, All-Powerful.\"    – \"Truly, Allāh is All-Knowing, All-Powerful.\"                 – \"Verily, Allāh is All-Powerful, All-Mighty.\"               – We think the above quoted verses speak for themselves; we need not re-write what the verses make so explicitly evident. We learn that Allāh Azz wa Jall is Omnipotent unlike the protestant Hindu god Ishwar who isn't, moreover he (Ishwar) is dependent over other to 'engineer' hence is not even the creator- we'll expound on this issue later in the article. We all know that Al-Qur'ān al-Kareem cannot be translated, it's a well known fact attested by approximately every Arabic scholar be it Muslim or non-Muslim, Al-Qur'ān is perfectly unique and hence there is no question that it's glory and perfection can be conveyed in any other language except that in which it was revealed (we can only try and convey interpretation of its meanings), and even the famous briton 'translator' of the Qur'an Marmaduke Pickthall(An famous English literati who reverted to Islām)confessed saying - \"The Koran cannot be translated… It is only an attempt to present the meaning of the Koran and peradventure something of the charm in English. It can never take the place of the Koran in Arabic, nor is it meant to do so.\" - &nbsp;\nWhat we can do, is somehow show and translate the interpretation of meanings of Glorious, Noble Qur'ān, in different languages.Hence it's to be understood that all the Qur'ānic verse quoted here in the article are mere interpretation of the meanings of the Noble Qur'ān. Strengthen your Understanding – Summarizing this sub-section (i.e. 'A) Is Protestant Hinduism Monotheistic?'), we would like to review what we've learnt about protestant Hindu theology, their creedal system and Protestant Hindus – 1) Ishwar(Protestant Hindu God) isn't the 'Creator' but simply the 'Maker' , 'Engineer' ,'Fashioner' of the world , as he didn't create Prakriti (Primordial matter) nor Ātmā (Human Souls)  as per Protestant Hindu Theology. What does this necessitate?\n<\/p> This belief itself proves protestant Hinduism to be non-Monotheistic, as in Monotheistic belief everything is dependent on God, but here 2 entities namely Prakriti (Primordial matter) and Ātmā are independent. Where as God is dependent on Prakriti (Primordial matter) for 'Making' 'engineering' 'Fashioning' Universe …etc things out of it. This belief rips God of his one main and very important attribute that's Uniqueness , Ishwar(Protestant Hindu God) isn't unique as he share's the very same attribute with Prakriti (Primordial matter) and Ātmā , that is attributes like 'Uncreated' ,'Beginning less' .This make's Vedic God (Ishwar) a mere artificer and Demiurge , which results to pure Polytheism. This belief also , entitlesPrakriti (Primordial matter) and Ātmā (Human Souls)   to be Partners of God, in being 'Uncreated' and in 'Making' and 'engineering' of Universe as the Protestant Hindu God(Ishwar) is dependent on both Ātmā(Human Souls)  and Prakriti (Primordial matter) to bring about this Universe. This in Islām is known as Shirk orAssociationism, which is in fact polytheism. Hence Protestant Hinduism by nature is Polytheistic. We've also proved that protestant Hinduism doesn't regard its God to be 'Omnipotent' or All-Powerful and their use of these words is totally futile as these are used just used in empty sense without affirming the meanings of these words. <p>2) We've also learnt and seen how Moolshankar and his blind-follower Agniveer use Sophistry to prove their point. There are many other points and proofs which expose the falsity of the protestant Hinduism being Monotheistic, these points and proofs shall be discussed and stated in the next sub-section.\n<\/p>\n","name":"Concept of God in Arya Samaj (Protestant Hinduism) Part 1 - VedKaBhed.Com Fast Server","@id":"/index.php/2014/01/01/concept-of-god-in-arya-samaj-protestant-hinduism-part-1/#richSnippet","isPartOf":{"@id":"/index.php/2014/01/01/concept-of-god-in-arya-samaj-protestant-hinduism-part-1/#webpage"},"inLanguage":"en-US","mainEntityOfPage":{"@id":"/index.php/2014/01/01/concept-of-god-in-arya-samaj-protestant-hinduism-part-1/#webpage"}}]}</script>

<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">Written by Abd Al Muhsin Al Hindy<br>
</span><br>
&nbsp;<br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">This section deals with the Concept of God <em>(or Concept of <span style="color:black;"><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">God<span style="color:red;">s</span></span> – </strong></span>later we’ll make things more evident)</em> in Protestant Hinduism<em>(so-called Ārya Samāj)</em>, the concept of God in Protestant Hinduism is grossly and totally incoherent. In fact it’s also doubted whether this could be called as concept of <strong>“God”</strong> or not. It seems, the very definition of God was not fathomed by Moolshankar. The conception of God in Protestant Hinduism itself is sufficient to prove the false nature of this cult. It’s quite amazing to see how Moolshankar describes his god <em>(Ishwar)</em>, he extensively stresses on his gods omnipresence, omnipotence, omniscience, formlessness and shapelessness. Nowadays we see fanatical zealots, hate-monger’s like Agniveer, propagating his works, <strong>as these <em>(Mahendra Pāl, Agniveer -now claims to be a ‘Movement’)</em> being a blind-followers of Moolshankar like other protestant Hindus. Here we’ll try to demystify the concept of God in Protestant Hinduism and show how rational and coherent it is.</strong><br>
</span><br>
<span id="more-1651"></span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">The protestant Hindus propagandise, their cult to be <strong>“Monotheistic”</strong> in nature and claim their scriptures teach worship of One God exclusively, this is what people are usually informed by the protagonists, but the reality of their belief will be evident in the following passages.Vedas only teach polytheism not monotheism.<br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">We read, Moolshankar <em>(Dayānanda Saraswati)</em>writing in his book <em>(Satyarth Prakāsh)</em>, that the Vedas strictly preach and teach Monotheism and this was his belief <em>[delusion]</em> too. In fact the translator Durgā Prasād writes in the book <em>(Satyarth Prakāsh’s translation, pg. 60)</em> that<span style="color:red;"><strong> “Satyarth Prakash – an exposition of the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">monotheism</span> and civilization of the ancient Aryans.” </strong></span>It seems that his <em>(Moolshankar’s)</em> blind -followers truly believe that this book <em>(Satyarth Prakāsh)</em> deals with monotheism, nonetheless this so-called monotheism of protestant Hinduism will be scrutinized to truth.<br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><strong>a.1) Is<span style="text-decoration:underline;"> Ishwar the Creator</span>?</strong><br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">Protestant Hindus go around talking of so-called one god <strong>“Ishwar”</strong> who is the creator.  But what they really mean by the <em>“Creator”</em>? Let’s see.<br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">First, Moolshankar wrote that God is the creator of all, then contradicts himself, by stating that Paramātmā <em>[God],</em> Ātmā <em>[Human Souls]</em> and Prakriti <em>[Primordial matter],</em> are beginning-less and uncreated! So how come God is <em>(Ishwar)</em> <strong>“creator of all”</strong>? We shall probe into this case, and expose some amazingly incoherent beliefs of protestant Hindus.<br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">Mooshankar wrote <em>(quotes Yajurveda 36:3)</em> –<br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><strong>“…Omniscient, Sustainer and Ruler of the Universe, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Creator of all</span>, Eternal…”</strong><br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">– [Satyarth Prakash Ch. 3, pg.33 Tr. Dr.Chiranjiva Bhardawaja]
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">It wasn’t slip of pen that Moolshankar <em>(Dayānanda Saraswati)</em> wrote <strong>“Creator of all”</strong> but this has been stated in other parts of Satyarth Prakāsh too. For instance, Moolshankar quotes Rigveda –<br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">“…I am the controller of the universe<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>,<span style="color:red;"> know me alone as the Creator of all</span></strong></span>…”<br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">-[Satyarth Prakash Ch. 7 ,pg.205 Tr. Dr.Chiranjiva Bhardawaja ]
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">Similarly, stated by Moolshankar <em>(Dayānanda Saraswati)</em> on pg. 207<em>(Tr.Chiranjiva)</em>,<br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">“…If He were localized to some particular place, He could never be Omniscient, Inward Regular of all, Universal Controller, <span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;"><strong><em>Creator of all</em></strong></span>, Sustainer of all and the Cause for resolution….”<br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">So we read, at first Moolshankar states that “<strong>Ishwar (God) is Creator of all</strong>“and later he goes on to state that there are 3 entities which are Uncreated, Eternal, Beginning-less.<br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">The three entities which are uncreated eternal, beginning-less – here Moolshakar <em>(Dayānanda Saraswati)</em>quotes <em>“SHWETA SHWATER UPNISHAD, 4: 5”</em>and states:<br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;"><strong>“The prakriti, the soul and God, all of them, are uncreated.</strong></span> They are the cause of the whole universe.”<br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">– [Satyarth Prakash Ch. 8, pg.244 Tr. Dr.Chiranjiva Bhardawaja]
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">As he <em>(Moolshankar)</em> states in Satyarth Prakash-<br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">“How many entities are eternal or beginningless?<br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><strong>   A-<span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;">Three – God, the soul, and the prakriti (matter).</span></strong>                                                                                      -[Satyarth Prakash Ch. 8 ,pg.243 Tr. Dr.Chiranjiva Bhardawaja ]
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">According to Moolshankar’s <em>(and protestant Hindu)</em> theology there are 3 <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>beginning less</strong></span>, <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">uncreated</span> </strong>,<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>immortal</strong></span> entities –<br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><em>1)      </em><strong>Paramātmā</strong> <em>(Ishwar/God)</em><br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">2)      <strong>Prakriti</strong> <em>(Primordial matter)</em><br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">3)      <strong>Ātmā </strong><em>(Human Souls,note -we’ll be using plural i.e. Human Souls for clarity)</em><br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">This philosopher’s stance <em>(uncreated primordial matter)</em> adopted by Moolshankar is self-contradictory in many areas, for instance Moolshankar seem to claim in monotheistic Vedas, but this stance of co-eternal prakriti <em>(Primordial matter) </em>and Ātmā <em>(Human Souls)</em> explicitly disqualifies prostestant Hindusim from the claim of monotheism, as this undermines and infringes the absolute monotheistic nature of God and reduces Him <em>(God)</em> to an position of an artificer –a Demiurge.<br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">Now, if this is the case <em>(co-eternal, uncreated Prakriti and Ātmā)</em> then, why did Moolshankar write God is the <strong>“<span style="text-decoration:underline;">creator of all</span>“</strong>? This is an explicit contradiction, which is easily noticeable. It’s understood that God is uncreated but what of <strong>“Prakriti” <em>(</em></strong><em>Primordial matter)</em> and <strong>“Ātmā”</strong> <em>(human souls)</em>? <strong>Who created them</strong><em>?[their being eternal,uncreated is not possible, rationally and logically especially for those who claim to be ‘monotheistic’]</em> And if God isn’t their creator – as these 2 things are uncreated <em>(as per protestant hindu belief)</em>, then why is God or in protestant Hindu terminology <em>“Ishwar”</em> <em>“Parameshawar”</em> called <strong>“Creator of all”. </strong>This is quite contradictory and absurd. In fact this is a white lie.<br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:#ff9900;"><strong>Agniveer</strong></span>, the fanatic hate-monger wrote –<br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><strong>Q: Who created the world? Ishwar or someone else?</strong><br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">A<span style="text-decoration:underline;">: Ishwar created the world in same manner as an engineer creates a machine. He is thus the<strong>‘engineer’</strong> of the world. But like engineer, He used existing <strong>‘raw material’</strong> or Nature (matter/ energy approximately) to create the world.</span><br>
</span><br>
&nbsp;<br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><strong>Q: Did Ishwar not create Nature as well?</strong><br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">A<span style="text-decoration:underline;">: No, Nature or ‘raw material’ is eternal (beginningless and endless)</span> like Ishwar. Being eternal, there is no cause for origin or destruction of Ishwar or Nature.”<br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">– [Source – <a href="http://agniveer.com/2775/creation/" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="color:blue;text-decoration:underline;">http://agniveer.com/2775/creation/</span><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>]
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">We learn that Protestant Hindu God <strong>‘Ishwar’</strong> is the <strong>‘engineer of the world’</strong>, who uses <strong>‘raw material’</strong> to create the world, this stance of protestant Hindu’s is quite fanciful, and irrational as it insults the concept of God itself in its entirety. I wonder why, don’t these protestant Hindus call Ishwar, an ‘engineer’ when they believe so?<br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">So, this incapability of Ishwar is also affirmed and stated by the hate-monger Agniveer, I wonder how a rational person <em>(assuming Agniveer is rational- I know it’s very farfetched, but let’s give him benefit of doubt and assume)</em> can accept such gibberish, incoherent theological views!<br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">In fact this absurdity is also supported by Vedas –<br>
</span><br>
&nbsp;<br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">“God, the Lord of final emancipation is in truth the <span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;"><strong>creator of all</strong></span> that hath been and what yet shall be; and what grows on earth.”                                                   – [Yajurveda Ch. 31, verse 2, pg. 302 Tr. Devi Chand]
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">“Worship Him, Whose beautiful sacrifice, wealth, strength, and mighty glory are enjoyed by the Heaven and Earth; <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong><span style="color:red;">Who is the creator of all</span> <span style="color:#ffcc00;">beings</span></strong></span>, the Embodiment of great happiness, All-pervading and Supplier of food.”                                      – [Yajurveda Ch. 33, verse 23, pg. 312 Tr. Devi Chand]
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">It’s to be noted that, the second verse states in an interrogative way “<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><span style="color:red;"><strong>Who is the creator of all beings…</strong></span> All-pervading</span>” Here again this statement is contradictory to the belief’s of Protestant Hindus, in order to prove this lets first define “<span style="color:#ffcc00;text-decoration:underline;"><strong>beings</strong></span>“. And<strong>“being”</strong>means –<br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:#333399;"><strong>being</strong></span> <em>noun </em>[ C or U ]
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">a person or thing that exists or the state of existing<br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">– [Cambridge Advanced Learner’s Dictionary CD- ROM, 3rd Edition, © Cambridge University Press 2008]
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">So <strong>‘being’</strong> means – <span style="text-decoration:underline;">a person or thing that exists or the state of existing</span>. So we ask doesn’t <strong>‘Prakriti’</strong> <em>(Primordial Matter) </em>exist? Doesn’t <strong>‘Ātmā’</strong> <em>(Human Souls)</em> exist? Yes of course they do, as stated by Moolshankar. Then how can ‘Ishwar’ be the <strong><em>‘creator of all beings’</em></strong> when Prakriti and Ātmā are uncreated? Then is ‘Ishwar’ creator of them? No, as stated by Moolshankar, then why is it stated in the above quoted verse of Yajurveda that the <em>“All-prevading”</em> <em>(i.e Ishwar)</em> is the <em>“Creator of all beings”? </em>This is nothing but pure contradiction which is repeated in many of the Vedic verses.Later, in the article we’ll see that Ishwar is not the creator of ‘time’…etc<br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">Questions which mavericks like us would like to ask –<br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">a) How can ‘Ishwar’ be <strong>‘creator of all’ <em>(or ‘<span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;">creator of all <span style="color:#ffcc00;">beings</span>‘)</span></em></strong> as claimed by protestant Hindus when, they themselves believe<em>(state)</em> in uncreated-ness of ‘Prakriti’ and ‘Ātmā’?<br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">b) Who created <strong><em>‘prakriti’</em></strong>, if <strong><em>‘Ishwar’</em></strong> – the Protestant Hindu God, didn’t? <em>[Rationally it’s impossible to prove uncreated-ness of<strong>Prakriti</strong> , especially when those claiming this are also claiming to be Monotheistic.]</em><br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">c) Who created <strong><em>‘Ātmā’</em></strong>, if <strong><em>‘Ishwar’</em></strong> – the Protestant Hindu God, didn’t?<em> [Rationally it’s impossible to prove uncreated-ness of <strong>Ātmā</strong>, especially when those claiming this are also claiming to be Monotheistic.]</em><br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">This ameliorates exposure of the reality of protestant Hindu theology in the eyes of Truth-Seeker’s. Now coming to some amazing facts, which will really expose the distortions <em>(of meanings)</em> from the protestant Hindu cult.<br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">Moolshankar wrote in Satyarth Prakāsh Ch.1 pg. 5 <em>(quoting Kaivalya Upanishad)</em> –<br>
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">“He is called Brahma – the Creator of the Universe…”<br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">And, in the footnotes the translator Dr. Chiranjiva comments”<span style="color:blue;">The word <span style="color:red;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Creator</span><span style="color:blue;"> used in the <span style="color:red;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>sense of Maker</strong></span><span style="color:blue;"> as according to Vedic Philosophy there is <span style="color:red;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">no such thing as creation or the evolution of something out of nothing</span><span style="color:blue;">.</span>“</span><br>
</span></span></span></span></span></span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">Also we find <span style="color:#ffcc00;"><strong>Agniveer</strong></span> the Hate-Monger, Islāmophobe confessing and admitting the fact that –<br>
</span><br>
&nbsp;<br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>“GOD NEVER CREATED US.</strong></span><br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">And because God never created us, He also never destroys us. <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Creation and destruction of soul is NOT the scope of work of God</strong></span>. Thus, just as God is beginningless and endless, so are we. We have existed along with God always and shall continue to do so.”<br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">– [Source – <a href="http://agniveer.com/1985/why-did-god-create-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right"><span style="color:blue;text-decoration:underline;">http://agniveer.com/1985/why-did-god-create-us/</span><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>]
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">Now astonishingly, we learn, that in the so-called <em>“Vedic Philosophy”</em> there’s nothing like <strong><em>“Creation out of nothing” </em></strong>and that the word<strong><em> “Creator” </em></strong>is used in <strong><em>“Sense of Maker”. </em></strong>One would be tempted to question, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Why not simply use the word <strong>‘Maker’</strong> why use the word <strong>‘Creator’</strong>?</span> The answer to it is simple, to <span style="text-decoration:underline;">fool people</span> and blind-followers <em>(protestant Hindus)</em>.As how can one believe in a ‘God’ who is not the Creator but just the <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Maker or Fashioner</strong></span> of it.<br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">So we are left with the philosophical excreta of philosopher’s brains</span> that’s “<span style="color:blue;">there is no such thing as creation or the evolution of something out of nothing.</span>”<br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">And we also see how the hate-monger Agniveer tries to get his incoherent, unintelligible belief, explained with few nonsensical words like “<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Creation and destruction of soul is NOT the scope of work of God”</strong></span>, we wonder <em>‘What’s the Scope of God’</em>? Does scope even apply on GOD?Is God something like created beings that <em>‘Scope’</em> applies to him, or is Agniveer trying to anthropomorphise God and apply Human-related characteristics/attributes to Him? By the way, is God<em>(according to Agniveer)</em>some sought of professional , for instance an Accountant , who’s been asked to handle Software engineers post , and cries out saying <em>“It’s out of my scope of work!!”</em> It’s pretty disgusting to see people insulting God by using such vernacular<em> (like “<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Creation and destruction of soul is NOT the scope of work of God”</strong></span>)</em>. We do not think that such a statement needs a refutation <em>(still we shall expose such irrationalities for those people seeking truth)</em>; such obscurely illogical statement arises out of pure ignorance of monotheism and pure blind following <em>(as in case of Agniveer).</em> We will be dealing with the reasons and causes of such irrational statement in our next subsection, wherein those reasons and causes shall be refuted and debunked.<br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">It will be worthwhile and of immense benefit to state one verse from the Holy, Noble Qur’ān wherein Allāh Azz wa Jall <em>(the alone worthy of worship, One true Almighty God)</em> says which means –<br>
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">        “<span style="color:#666699;"><strong>Do they attribute as partners to Allāh those <span style="text-decoration:underline;">who created nothing</span></strong></span>”                                                                                                    – [Surah al-A’raaf, Ayat 191]
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">So true! See the misery and state of these Protestant Hindus, how they worship those who create not! These poor protestant Hindus set up partners <em>(by worshipping Ishwar who creates nothing) </em>with Allāh who alone is the true Almighty God, the creator of Al -‘Alamîn <em>[Total Creation]</em>. We would ask our reader’s and especially the truth seeker’s to see<em>[and learn a lesson, so that you may not fall into the same dark pit]</em> how these protestant Hindus have wronged themselves by worshipping false God , who is unable to create anything.<br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">For now we’ll leave the reader’s and truth-seeker’s with this verse and let them ponder upon it and contemplate whether they are on truth or falsehood, now coming back –<br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">So this only proves that <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Ishwar <em>(Protestant Hindu God) </em>is <span style="color:red;">Incapable</span></strong></span> of –<br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">1)      Creating Prakriti <em>(Primordial Matter)</em> and Ātmā <em>(Human Souls).</em><br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">2)      Destroying, Annihilating Prakriti and Ātmā.<br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">This sufficiently proves that <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Incapability</strong></span> is an attribute <em>(characteristic)</em> of <em>‘Ishwar’</em>. This also proves that ‘Ishwar’ isn’t omnipotent or All-Powerful. But Moolshankar seems to state something opposite to it, he states <em>(quoting Rigveda)</em> –<br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">“…Mayest thou (Vishnu) O Omnipresent and (Urukrama) <span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Omnipotent Being</strong></span>, shower Thy blessings all around us…”                                                                                                                               -[Satyarth Prakash Ch. 1,pg.2 Tr. Dr.Chiranjiva Bhardawaja ]
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">So what does <strong>“Omnipotence”</strong> mean? Let’s have it defined –<br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:blue;"><strong>Omnipotent       </strong></span> <em>adjective </em>formal<br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">having unlimited power; able to do anything<br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">– [Cambridge Advanced Learner’s Dictionary CD- ROM, 3rd Edition, © Cambridge University Press 2008]
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">All the words, like Omnipotent, All-Powerful, creator are just empty words used by Moolshankar &amp; Co. for deluding people and poor blind-followers of his<em> (Moolshankar).</em> As we read earlier that , if Ishwar isn’t able to create <strong>“Prakriti”</strong> and <strong>“Ātmā”</strong> then this inability of creating things renders him free of the title “Creator” and  also this raises questions on Ishwar’s <strong>“Omnipotence”. </strong>These questions will be dealt, in the later part of the section, for now let’s see whether Moolshankar , believed in “Omnipotence” of “Ishwar”?<em>(We’ve seen a quote above , now let’s see his belief in detail).</em><br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">Moolshankar was and ardent believer of “Ishwar’s” Omnipotence <em>(at least he made it seem so)</em>, we read in various places in Satyarth Prakāsh, where he claims God to be Omnipotent, All-Powerful.<br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">“Vayu: the <span style="color:red;">Omnipotent</span><br>
<span style="color:red;">Being</span>,”                                                                                                                                  – (Satyrath Prakash Ch 1, pg.71 Tr. Durga Prasad)<br>
</span><br>
&nbsp;<br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">“The verse means: May (bhavatu) the Infinite Spirit<span style="color:red;"><strong> (Parmatma) who is Omnipotent</strong></span>”                                                                                                                                                                – (Satyrath Prakash Ch 1, pg.77 Tr. Durga Prasad)<br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">“O Lord Thou Who art the Protector of the universe and the Veda, and art <span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Omnipotent</strong></span>, Omnipresent…”<br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">-(Satyarth Prakash Ch. 10,pg.368 Tr. Dr.Chiranjiva Bhardawaja )<br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">Hence, we learn that Moolshankar did believe in Omnipotence of his Ishwar, but was this Omnipotence true? Or what did Moolshankar mean by Omnipotence? As stated earlier “<em>Omnipotence</em>“, “<em>All-Powerful</em>” et al. are just empty words for Moolshankar, this will be evident below. In fact, Moolshankar goes on to <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>distort</strong></span> the meanings of words like “All-Powerful” and “Omnipotence” to fit his beliefs, for instance “<em>Omnipotence</em>” according to him does not mean <strong>“having unlimited power; able to do anything”</strong>.<br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:#ffcc00;"><strong>Agniveer</strong></span> the fanatical Protestant Hindu-extremist, hate-monger also affirms and believes in the so-called All-Powerful Ishwar, he wrote –<br>
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">“Finally, Yajurveda 40.8 lists the properties of Ishwar as follows:<br>
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">Paryagat – Omnipresent,<br>
<span style="color:red;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Shukram – All-powerful</strong></span>,</span>”<br>

</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">Elsewhere too, with vigor same is stated by this mere hate- monger –<br>
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">“But Vedic <span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Ishwar is truly all-Powerful</strong></span>…”<br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">                                                                 – [Source –<a href="http://agniveer.com/2728/more-on-vedic-god/" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="color:blue;text-decoration:underline;">http://agniveer.com/2728/more-on-vedic-god/</span><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> ]
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">But according to him <em>(Moolshankar)</em> it’s <em>(omnipotence’s meaning)</em> something different, this is what he answered when a questioned, regarding Ishwar’s inability of creating “prakriti”.<br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><strong>Q – God being Omnipotent, He can also create prakriti – the primordial matter – and the soul. If He cannot, He cannot be called Omnipotent.</strong><br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><strong>A.</strong> – <span style="color:red;"><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">We have explained the meaning of the word Omnipotent before</span>.</strong></span> But does Omnipotent mean one who can work even the impossibilities. If there be one who can do even such impossible things as the production of an effect without a cause, then can He make another God, Himself die, suffer pain, become dead and inert, inanimate, unjust, impure and immoral or not? Even God cannot change the natural properties of things as heat of the fire, Fluidity of liquids and inertness of earth, etc. His laws being true and perfect, He cannot alter them.<strong><em><span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;">Omnipotence, therefore, only means that He possesses the power of doing all His works without any help</span>.                                        </em></strong>-[Satyarth Prakash Ch. 8, pg.251 Tr. Dr.Chiranjiva Bhardawaja ]
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">Primarily, it’s to be noted that Moolshankar states he has explained the meaning of word Omnipotence, earlier in the book, on which we’ll expound soon. Secondarily, we learn that according to Moolshankar omnipotence isn’t the ability to do anything but only means “<em><span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;"><strong>the power of doing all His works without any help</strong></span><strong>.”</strong>(This is moolshankar’s proposed definition). <strong>We see Moolshankar, distorting the meaning of Omnipotence in order to hide the fact that Ishawar isn’t omnipotent or All-Powerful and this factuality is impossible to grasp for any believer (theist) in God, hence in order to delude people and his own self <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Moolshankar indulges in namely two things – Distortion of meaning and Sophistry.</span></strong></em><br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><strong>a.2) Is Ishwar Omnipotent (All-Powerful) and what does Omnipotence mean to protestant Hinduism?</strong><br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">Now coming to the <em>“explanation” </em>of the meaning of Omnipotence by Moolshankar, which he stated to have explained earlier, wherein he uses sophistry in order prove his beliefs, which is quite amusing<em>(hilarious)</em> to read.<br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">In order to, prove that his <em>(Moolshankar)</em> <span style="text-decoration:underline;">meaning <em>(‘proposed definition’)</em> of <strong>‘Omnipotence’</strong> and conception of God is correct</span>,<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Moolshankar disgustingly</span>, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">indulges in sophistry</span>. These question explain the situation to us –<br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><strong>Is God All-powerful or not?</strong><br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><strong>A.</strong> – <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Yes, He is, but what you understand by the word All- powerful is not right</strong></span>. It really means that God does not require the least assistance from any person in all His works such as Creation, Sustenance and Dissolution of the Universe, and administration of Divine Justice. In other words, He does all His works with His own infinite power.                                      – [ Satyarth Prakash , Ch 7,pg 208 ,Tr. Dr. Chiranjiva]
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><strong>But we believe that God can do whatever He likes. There is no one above Him.</strong><br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><strong>A.     </strong>– What does He like? If you say that he likes and can do all things, we ask – <strong>“Can God kill Himself?”</strong> Or<strong>“can He make other Gods like Himself, become ignorant, commit sins such as theft, adultery and the like? Or can He be unhappy?”</strong> <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Your answer can only be in the negative, as these things are opposed to the nature and attributes of God</span>; hence your contention, that God can do all things, does not hold good. Our meaning only, therefore, of the word All-powerful is true.                                                                   – [ Satyarth Prakash , Ch 7,pg 208 ,Tr. Dr. Chiranjiva]
</span><br>
&nbsp;<br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">We would also like to quote the hate monger, <span style="color:#ffcc00;">Islāmophobe Agniveer, so as to expose his ignorance</span>, this Islāmophobe wrote –<br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><strong>Q: Is Ishwar Omnipotent or All-Powerful?</strong><br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">A: <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Yes, He is omnipotent<strong>.<span style="color:red;"> But that does not mean He can do whatever He wants</span></strong></span>. <span style="color:red;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Doing whatever one may want is sign of indiscipline. On contrary, Ishwar is most disciplined</span>.<strong> Omnipotence means that Ishwar does not need help of any other entity to conduct His duties</strong> – creation, management, destruction of universe. He is self-sufficient to conduct His duties. But He would act only as per His duties. For example,He will not kill Himself to create another Ishwar. He cannot make Himself an idiot. He cannot do theft or dacoity etc.</span><br>

</span><br>
&nbsp;<br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">These <em>(above)</em> emphasized<em> (by us)</em> interrogative questions were asked by Moolshankar <em>(&amp; Agniveer)</em> to prove that his god <em>(Ishwar)</em>is <span style="text-decoration:underline;">not</span> omnipotent<em> (as per the meaning of the word)</em> in true sense but has limited omnipotence. Moolshankar <em>(so does Agniveer)</em>seems very eager and zealous to prove that his god <em>(Ishwar)</em> is not at all omnipotent in true sense, but merely is called so. Moolshankar seems to be trying pretty hard, to prove his definition of <em>“Omnipotence”</em> to be true, but drastically fails at it, as will be evident. Now coming to his silly, hilarious questions:<br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">Firstly it’s to be noted that Moolshankar, states <em>(assumes)</em> that the answers to the questions will be in negative, I wonder why didn’t the questioner reply or why wasn’t his reply <em>(in detail or were these questions and answers made-up by himself, that’s the case most probably)</em> stated in Satyarth Prakash . Now replying to the insinuations and irrationality of Moolshankar and Agniveer.<br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">We would be pleasured to ask –<br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">Do these attributes or qualities/characteristics <em>(Killing, ignorance, theft, adultery…etc.)</em> befit Almighty God or belong to him? Of course not, Moolshankar also agrees by writing “<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><span style="color:red;">these things are opposed to the nature and attributes of God</span>“.</span> Now, we would like to question, how come these things are applied to God? Also, it’s should be noted that these are qualities of humans and not of God, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">so how can these be applied to God or how could one judge God’s capability in terms of these <em>[human]</em> acts?</span> Same deviant principle of judging and understanding God in human context and human attributes is followed by Agniveer , our readers need not get surprised after all Agniveer is a mere blind-follower of Moolshankar .We read Agniveer stating “Doing whatever one may want is sign of indiscipline. On contrary, Ishwar is most disciplined” What a show of irrationality and illogicalness! This statement of Agniveer show’s us his <em>‘conceptualization’</em> of God. What Agniveer states here is pure irrationality, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">God the Almighty is the <strong>creator of Discipline</strong></span> and hence he is not subjected to it , we wonder how could Agniveer even think of such a thing , he judges God in the light of human attributes and behavior!<br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">Hence the so-called argument that doing whatever one wants is a sign of indiscipline is only applied to humans and not to God Almighty. Also, another aspect should be pointed out is that <span style="text-decoration:underline;">God Almighty by <strong>nature</strong> and<strong> definition</strong> is the <strong>Most-Perfect</strong> or <strong>All-Perfect</strong></span>, hence the one who’s perfect by nature needs no discipline at all, on contrary it’s only those who have the tendency to get deviated<em> (like humans, animals…etc) </em>and indulge in non-disciplinary acts and behavior need discipline and are subjected to it or judged by it.<br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">This understanding of God in scales of human attributes and behavior, only show the anthropomorphic tendencies of Agniveer and his gross incoherency. To enlighten Agniveer we would present here, what Allāh Azz wa Jall <em>(the only One True Almighty God)</em> says which means:<br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:purple;"><strong>                                         “<span style="text-decoration:underline;">There is nothing like Him(</span>Allāh)”</strong></span><br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><strong>                                                                                                    – [Surah Ash- Shura Ayat 11]</strong><br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">This verse proves and shows the obligation of rejection and negation of resembling God the Most Perfect, with His creation or anything else</span>. This is what we Muslims believe, in fact this is the most basic and fundamental principle which we Muslims are taught at first, hence as stated above, there is no similitude, resembling, likeness of God [<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>There is nothing like Him]</strong></span>, so are his attributes <em>[His attributes are perfectly Unique , and have no resembling, Similitude]</em>, hence we ask Protestant Hindus, to ponder upon it and we think and Agniveer too comes under Protestant Hinduism, so we would also ask him to humbly ponder upon this truly, great and glorious principle which every theist should believe in. This principle will help Agniveer get rid of his anthropomorphic tendencies – understanding God in light of Human attributes/context/behavior, as this verse makes clear that there is nothing like unto God.<br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">We’ve also read what Moolshankar wrote; in fact both Agniveer and Moolshankar suffer from same disease of sophism, and irrationality<em> [moreover both have the anthropomorphic tendency of understanding God and judging him in Human behavioral patterns, attributes].</em> Questions <em>(like ‘<strong>Can God Kill Himself </strong>‘<strong>…et al.)</strong></em> asked by Moolshankar and Agniveer are similar <em>[like both ask whether God can kill himself and create gods…etc]</em>, hence we would refute and debunk the questions <em>(insinuations) </em>asked by Moolshankar, and indirectly Agniveer’s questions will be debunked too.<br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">Now coming back to the ‘questions’ of Moolshankar –<br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">And we would now again like to ask <strong><em>“Why would God need to steal something, when he is the creator of that thing and can create it?”</em></strong> Yeah, only the Protestant Hindu god <em>(Ishwar)</em> would need to steal things as he is not the Creator but only the efficient cause <em>(acc. to Protestant Hindu Theology)</em>, as prakriti <em>(Primordial Matter)</em> is eternal and uncreated like God , so it is possible that he could steal a bit from prakriti <em>(Primordial Matter)</em>.<span style="text-decoration:underline;">So why would God Almighty need to steal</span>? It’s ridiculous of Moolshankar to ask such hilarious and incoherent questions and this only adds up to his ignorance.<br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">Now scrutinizing a bit more, Moolshankar also questions <strong>‘can He<em>[God]</em> become ignorant, commit sins such as theft, adultery and the like’</strong> this is really hilarious and irrational. By scrutinizing and observing questions similar and those asked by him we, learn a lot of Moolshankar’s state of mind and the basis of his belief system. We’ll see questions similar to Moolshankar’s first to show the real problem in his approach and then refute his questions.<br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">Basically what Moolshankar is trying to ask<strong> <em>“If God can do anything, can He make it impossible for him-self to do something [like adultery, theft…etc]?”</em></strong><br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">Such question’s becomes even clearer when we examine a related question: <strong>“Can God create an uncreated being?”</strong> The problem here is that the questioner has already defined the being to be uncreated and then proceeds to ask for something that contradicts that definition. The problem is in the questioner’s terms, not any lack in God’s potential. The same is true when asking God to make a circle with four sides. Having already provided a definition of a circle that could never include a four-sided figure, such a question is absurd. Something is certainly self-contradictory here, but it is the questioner’s terminology and not the omnipotence of God. The answer to the question (<strong>Can God kill Himself?)</strong> of Moolshankar is-. <strong>Well, killing <em>(death)</em> isn’t ability; it’s the inability to live</strong> moreover <span style="text-decoration:underline;">death is a creation</span> <em>(death is created and God’s uncreated)</em> of God, so it’s quite irrational to ask such questions as creation can never overcome the creator in any sense. The immortal cannot die because that defies His attribute of immortality. Similarly, the omnipotent cannot create a task that He can’t complete because such a task is merely a figment of one’s imagination and could not exist, not because He is incapable.Can God make 1=2? Well if 1=2, then it wouldn’t be 1! So the idea is self-contradictory, not God.<br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">The question also reminds us of the idea of what happens when an immovable rock meets an unstoppable force? The two things cannot exist in the same universe. Likewise, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">if God exists then all things which contradict His attributes are imaginary, non-existent and impossible. They are forever bound to the realm of imagination and cannot be brought into existence.</span><br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">Similar is the question <em>(of Moolshankar)</em> “<strong>can He <span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;">make </span>other Gods like Himself” </strong>.In fact the phrase <strong>“can He <span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;">make</span> other Gods like Himself”</strong> is explicit sophism or false/invalid argument, and is a contradiction in terms, because the mere fact that something is created <em>(‘</em><strong>can He <span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;">make’</span></strong><em>) </em>means that it cannot be a God. This question is like asking could God create <span style="text-decoration:underline;">“a god who is not a god?”</span> It is self-evident that the answer can only be: The power of God has nothing to do with that, because the idea that something can be a god and not a god is illogical and is irrational, and<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong> the power and might of God has nothing to do with irrationalities</strong></span>.<br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">In fact all the questions asked by Moolshankar and Agniveer are just instances of sophism and are self-contradiction –<br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">–          <strong>“Can God kill Himself?”</strong><br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">–          <strong>“Can He (God) make other Gods like Himself, become ignorant, commit sins such as theft, adultery and the like?</strong><br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">–          <strong>“Can He (God) be unhappy?”</strong><br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">God is eternal and uncreated<em>[in fact even Moolshankar attest to this , that his god Ishwar is eternal and uncreated] </em>by nature and definition hence God killing himself is irrational and contradictory in terms , also Killing <em>(or dying)</em> is a human’s act or attribute, like Humans kill humans, Humans die. So what we see is Moolshankar first defining God to be uncreated and eternal then posing a sophistic questions which are purely contradictory and irrational , Moolshankar is only contradicting himself.<br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">As for creating God then again God is Uncreated and eternal, hence what is created cannot be god so it’s irrational and spurious even to think of such absurdities.<br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">Same for questions like, ‘can God become Ignorant’, God by nature is <strong>All-wise </strong>and <strong>All-Knowledgeable</strong> hence again its contradiction and irrational, also things like ignorance, adultery sins, theft are all instances of human behaviors, attributes or actions and in no way can they ever be applied to God or used to judge God. Same with being <em>“Unhappy”</em>, being happy and unhappy are human attributes/characteristics and traits, not of God ,also these things contradict God’s attribute of Perfection<em>(All-Perfect)</em> hence God by nature being perfect is not subject to such things and state, such queries are but contradiction. As<span style="text-decoration:underline;"> God exists hence all things which contradict His attributes are imaginary, non-existent and impossible. They are forever bound to the realm of imagination and cannot be brought into existence. Also the Power, Majesty and Might of Almighty God have nothing to do with Irrationalities.</span><br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">Hence we see Moolshankar using sophistry <em>(false-invalid arguments)</em> to prove that “Omnipotence” in fact means “<strong><em><span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;">the power of doing all His works without any help</span>.”  And not “</em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">able to do anything</span>“</strong> which in fact, is the true and right definition of being Omnipotent.<br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">Concluding, it will be beneficial to note, how Moolshankar uses his irrationality and Sophistry to prove things. Like first he defines Ishwar as uncreated and beginning-less and then questions whether “God can kill himself?” that’s so self-contradictory and irrational of him. Again and again he repeats his irrational questions like “<strong>can He(God) <span style="color:red;">make</span> other Gods like Himself” , </strong>same here he as defined and stated God to be “Uncreated” , then ask can God <span style="text-decoration:underline;">make</span>other Gods? This is what happens when you swallow the excreta of philosopher’s brain. This is pure irrationality and this will be evident, even to novice or amateur, let’s see what a mathematician opines about such ridiculous questions.<br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><strong>Mathematician’s Opinion –</strong><br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">Summing up the section, I would like to present a short quote from a revert to Islām – Dr. Jeffrey Lang, a mathematician <em>[Professor of Mathematics at University of Kansas, US] (an ex-atheist)] </em>–<br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">“If God is all-powerful, can He become a man, terminate His existence, tell a lie, be unjust, or create a stone too heavy for even Him to move? <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>These somewhat <span style="color:red;">silly</span> riddles most often arise from imposing unnecessary and <span style="color:red;">contradictory assumptions</span> on certain attributes of God or by <span style="color:red;">assigning unwarranted additional attributes</span> to Him.</strong></span>”<br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">– [“Even Angels Ask”, Dr. Jeffrey Lang, pg. 69, Beltsville, 1997]
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">We are pretty sure that every intelligent, sane and unbiased person will believe such ‘questions’ to be silly, and illogical.<br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">It would also be beneficial <em>(concisely)</em> to state the reasons why Moolshankar delved into such absurdities which are totally untenable. It’s necessary to note that Moolshankar was reluctant enough to apply <em>(judge and understand) </em>human attributes to God in order to prove his point; also his conception of God in his mind was somewhat anthropomorphic in essence. This also shows how Moolshankar swallowed the excreta of philosophers and atheists’ <em>(in fact, sophistry was chiefly used by atheist to disprove God and his existence)</em> brain in order to forward his claims, delude people from the straight path and malign and corrupt monotheism.<br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><strong>Islāmic Stance –</strong><br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">To enlighten people about Islām and present a true picture of Islām <em>(which the Hate-monger’s and quacks like Mahendra Pāl, Agniveer cowardly and hypocritically don’t do, due to their bias, prejudice and hate for Islām.)</em> we’ll shortly and very briefly present Islāmic point of view here, very concisely for our readers and truth Seekers –<br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Who’s the Creator?</strong></span><br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">Allāh the Most-Merciful says which means,<br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">“<span style="color:purple;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>That is Allāh, your Lord, the Creator of all things</strong></span>, Lā ilāha illā Huwa <em>(none has the right to be worshipped but He)</em>. How then are you turning away <em>(from Allāh, by worshipping others instead of Him)</em>?”    </span>                           – [Surah Al-Mu’min , Ayat 62]
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">See you O, protestant Hindus your only One True Almighty God <em>(Allāh)</em> states that He is the Creator of all things; still you turn away from Him and worship false-god?<br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">And in another verse of the Noble, Holy Qur’ān, Allāh Azz wa Jall says which means,<br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">“<span style="color:purple;">Such is Allāh, your Lord(none has the right to be worshipped but He), the</span> <strong><span style="color:purple;text-decoration:underline;">Creator of all things</span>.<span style="color:purple;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">So worship Him <em>(Alone),</em></span> and He is the Wakîl <em>(Trustee, Disposer of affairs or Guardian)</em> over all things.”</span> – [Surah, Al-An’aam, Ayat 102]</strong><br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">Again theonly One True Almighty God <em>(Allāh)</em> states that He alone is the Creator of all things and calls every of his creation to worship Him alone.<br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Is God (Allāh) Omnipotent or All-Powerful?</strong></span><br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">Allāh the Most-Merciful says which means,<br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><strong><span style="color:purple;">“Truly, Allāh is Ever Most Powerful, All-Wise.”</span> </strong>         – [Surah An-Ni’saa, Ayat 56]
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:purple;"><strong>“Verily, Allāh is Ever Oft-Pardoning, All-Powerful.”</strong></span>    – [Surah An-Ni’saa, Ayat 149]
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:purple;"><strong>“Truly, Allāh is All-Knowing, All-Powerful.”</strong></span>                 – [Surah An-Nahl, Ayat 70]
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:purple;"><strong>“Verily, Allāh is All-Powerful, All-Mighty.”</strong></span>               – [Surah Al-Mujaadilah, Ayat 21]
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">We think the above quoted verses speak for themselves; we need not re-write what the verses make so explicitly evident. We learn that Allāh Azz wa Jall is Omnipotent unlike the protestant Hindu god Ishwar who isn’t, moreover he <em>(Ishwar)</em> is dependent over other to ‘engineer’ hence is not even the creator- we’ll expound on this issue later in the article.<br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">We all know that Al-Qur’ān al-Kareem cannot be translated, it’s a well known fact attested by approximately every Arabic scholar be it Muslim or non-Muslim, Al-Qur’ān is perfectly unique and hence there is no question that it’s glory and perfection can be conveyed in any other language except that in which it was revealed <em>(we can only try and convey interpretation of its meanings)</em>, and even the famous briton ‘translator’ of the Qur’an Marmaduke Pickthall<em>(An famous English literati who reverted to Islām)</em>confessed saying –<br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">“<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>The Koran cannot be translated</strong></span>… It is only an attempt to <span style="text-decoration:underline;">present the meaning</span> of the Koran and peradventure something of the charm in English. It can never take the place of the Koran in Arabic, nor is it meant to do so.”<br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">– [The Meanings of the Glorious Koran, pg. vii, Alfred A. Knopp Inc., 1930]
</span><br>
&nbsp;<br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">What we can do, is somehow show and translate the interpretation of meanings of Glorious, Noble Qur’ān, in different languages.<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Hence it’s to be understood that all the Qur’ānic verse quoted here in the article are mere interpretation of the meanings of the Noble Qur’ān.</span><br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><strong>Strengthen your Understanding –</strong><br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">Summarizing this sub-section <em>(i.e. <strong>‘A) Is Protestant Hinduism Monotheistic?’</strong>)</em>, we would like to review what we’ve learnt about protestant Hindu theology, their creedal system and Protestant Hindus –<br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><strong>1)</strong> Ishwar<em>(Protestant Hindu God)</em> isn’t the <strong>‘Creator’ </strong>but simply the <strong>‘Maker’ , ‘Engineer’</strong> ,’<strong>Fashioner’</strong> of the world , as he didn’t create Prakriti <em>(Primordial matter)</em> nor Ātmā <em>(Human Souls) </em> as per Protestant Hindu Theology. What does this necessitate?<br>
</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">This belief itself proves protestant Hinduism to be non-Monotheistic, as in Monotheistic belief everything <span style="text-decoration:underline;">is dependent on God</span>, but here 2 entities namely Prakriti <em>(Primordial matter)</em> and Ātmā are <strong>independent</strong>. Where as God is dependent on Prakriti <em>(Primordial matter)</em> for <strong>‘Making’</strong> <strong>‘engineering’</strong> <strong>‘Fashioning’</strong> Universe …etc things out of it.<br>
</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">This belief rips God of his one main and very important attribute that’s Uniqueness , Ishwar<em>(Protestant Hindu God)</em> isn’t unique as he share’s the very same attribute with Prakriti <em>(Primordial matter)</em> and Ātmā , that is attributes like <strong>‘Uncreated’</strong> ,<strong>‘Beginning less’ .This make’s Vedic God <em>(Ishwar)</em> <span style="text-decoration:underline;">a mere artificer and Demiurge</span> , which results to pure Polytheism.</strong><br>
</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">This belief also , entitlesPrakriti <em>(Primordial matter)</em> and Ātmā <em>(Human Souls) </em>  to be <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Partners of God</strong></span>, in being ‘Uncreated’ and in ‘Making’ and ‘engineering’ of Universe as the Protestant Hindu God(<em>Ishwar) </em>is dependent on both Ātmā<em>(Human Souls) </em> and Prakriti <em>(Primordial matter)</em> to bring about this Universe. This in Islām is known as <strong>Shirk </strong>or<strong>Associationism</strong>, which is in fact polytheism. Hence Protestant Hinduism by nature is Polytheistic.<br>
</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">We’ve also proved that protestant Hinduism doesn’t regard its God to be ‘Omnipotent’ or All-Powerful and their use of these words is totally futile as these are used just used in empty sense without affirming the meanings of these words.<br>
</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><strong>2) </strong>We’ve also learnt and seen how Moolshankar and his blind-follower Agniveer use Sophistry to prove their point.<br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">There are many other points and proofs which expose the falsity of the protestant Hinduism being Monotheistic, these points and proofs shall be discussed and stated in the next sub-section.<br>

In fact it's also doubted whether this could be called as concept of \"God\" or not. It seems, the very definition of God was not fathomed by Moolshankar. The conception of God in Protestant Hinduism itself is sufficient to prove the false nature of this cult. It's quite amazing to see how Moolshankar describes his god (Ishwar), he extensively stresses on his gods omnipresence, omnipotence, omniscience, formlessness and shapelessness. Nowadays we see fanatical zealots, hate-monger's like Agniveer, propagating his works, as these (Mahendra Pāl, Agniveer -now claims to be a 'Movement') being a blind-followers of Moolshankar like other protestant Hindus. Here we'll try to demystify the concept of God in Protestant Hinduism and show how rational and coherent it is.\n\n\nThe protestant Hindus propagandise, their cult to be \"Monotheistic\" in nature and claim their scriptures teach worship of One God exclusively, this is what people are usually informed by the protagonists, but the reality of their belief will be evident in the following passages.Vedas only teach polytheism not monotheism.\n\nWe read, Moolshankar (Dayānanda Saraswati)writing in his book (Satyarth Prakāsh), that the Vedas strictly preach and teach Monotheism and this was his belief [delusion] too. In fact the translator Durgā Prasād writes in the book (Satyarth Prakāsh's translation, pg. 60) that \"Satyarth Prakash – an exposition of the monotheism and civilization of the ancient Aryans.\" It seems that his (Moolshankar's) blind -followers truly believe that this book (Satyarth Prakāsh) deals with monotheism, nonetheless this so-called monotheism of protestant Hinduism will be scrutinized to truth.\n\na.1) Is Ishwar the Creator?\n\nProtestant Hindus go around talking of so-called one god \"Ishwar\" who is the creator.  But what they really mean by the \"Creator\"? Let's see.\n\nFirst, Moolshankar wrote that God is the creator of all, then contradicts himself, by stating that Paramātmā [God], Ātmā [Human Souls] and Prakriti [Primordial matter], are beginning-less and uncreated! So how come God is (Ishwar) \"creator of all\"? We shall probe into this case, and expose some amazingly incoherent beliefs of protestant Hindus.\n\nMooshankar wrote (quotes Yajurveda 36:3) –\n\n\"…Omniscient, Sustainer and Ruler of the Universe, Creator of all, Eternal…\"\n\n- [Satyarth Prakash Ch. 3, pg.33 Tr. Dr.Chiranjiva Bhardawaja]\n\nIt wasn't slip of pen that Moolshankar (Dayānanda Saraswati) wrote \"Creator of all\" but this has been stated in other parts of Satyarth Prakāsh too. For instance, Moolshankar quotes Rigveda -\n\n\"…I am the controller of the universe, know me alone as the Creator of all…\"\n\n-[Satyarth Prakash Ch. 7 ,pg.205 Tr. Dr.Chiranjiva Bhardawaja ]\n\nSimilarly, stated by Moolshankar (Dayānanda Saraswati) on pg. 207(Tr.Chiranjiva),\n\n\"…If He were localized to some particular place, He could never be Omniscient, Inward Regular of all, Universal Controller, Creator of all, Sustainer of all and the Cause for resolution….\"\n\nSo we read, at first Moolshankar states that \"Ishwar (God) is Creator of all\"and later he goes on to state that there are 3 entities which are Uncreated, Eternal, Beginning-less.\n\nThe three entities which are uncreated eternal, beginning-less – here Moolshakar (Dayānanda Saraswati)quotes \"SHWETA SHWATER UPNISHAD, 4: 5\"and states:\n\n\"The prakriti, the soul and God, all of them, are uncreated. They are the cause of the whole universe.\"\n\n– [Satyarth Prakash Ch. 8, pg.244 Tr. Dr.Chiranjiva Bhardawaja]\n\nAs he (Moolshankar) states in Satyarth Prakash-\n\n\"How many entities are eternal or beginningless?\n\n   A-Three – God, the soul, and the prakriti (matter).                                                                                      -[Satyarth Prakash Ch. 8 ,pg.243 Tr. Dr.Chiranjiva Bhardawaja ]\n\nAccording to Moolshankar's (and protestant Hindu) theology there are 3 beginning less, uncreated ,immortal entities –\n\n1)      Paramātmā (Ishwar\/God)\n\n2)      Prakriti (Primordial matter)\n\n3)      Ātmā (Human Souls,note -we'll be using plural i.e. Human Souls for clarity)\n\nThis philosopher's stance (uncreated primordial matter) adopted by Moolshankar is self-contradictory in many areas, for instance Moolshankar seem to claim in monotheistic Vedas, but this stance of co-eternal prakriti (Primordial matter) and Ātmā (Human Souls) explicitly disqualifies prostestant Hindusim from the claim of monotheism, as this undermines and infringes the absolute monotheistic nature of God and reduces Him (God) to an position of an artificer –a Demiurge.\n\nNow, if this is the case (co-eternal, uncreated Prakriti and Ātmā) then, why did Moolshankar write God is the \"creator of all\"? This is an explicit contradiction, which is easily noticeable. It's understood that God is uncreated but what of \"Prakriti\" (Primordial matter) and \"Ātmā\" (human souls)? Who created them?[their being eternal,uncreated is not possible, rationally and logically especially for those who claim to be 'monotheistic'] And if God isn't their creator – as these 2 things are uncreated (as per protestant hindu belief), then why is God or in protestant Hindu terminology \"Ishwar\" \"Parameshawar\" called \"Creator of all\". This is quite contradictory and absurd. In fact this is a white lie.\n\nAgniveer, the fanatic hate-monger wrote –\n\nQ: Who created the world? Ishwar or someone else?\n\nA: Ishwar created the world in same manner as an engineer creates a machine. He is thus the'engineer' of the world. But like engineer, He used existing 'raw material' or Nature (matter\/ energy approximately) to create the world.\n\n \nQ: Did Ishwar not create Nature as well?\n\nA: No, Nature or 'raw material' is eternal (beginningless and endless) like Ishwar. Being eternal, there is no cause for origin or destruction of Ishwar or Nature.\"\n\n- [Source - http:\/\/agniveer.com\/2775\/creation\/]\n\nWe learn that Protestant Hindu God 'Ishwar' is the 'engineer of the world', who uses 'raw material' to create the world, this stance of protestant Hindu's is quite fanciful, and irrational as it insults the concept of God itself in its entirety. I wonder why, don't these protestant Hindus call Ishwar, an 'engineer' when they believe so?\n\nSo, this incapability of Ishwar is also affirmed and stated by the hate-monger Agniveer, I wonder how a rational person (assuming Agniveer is rational- I know it's very farfetched, but let's give him benefit of doubt and assume) can accept such gibberish, incoherent theological views!\n\nIn fact this absurdity is also supported by Vedas -\n\n \n\"God, the Lord of final emancipation is in truth the creator of all that hath been and what yet shall be; and what grows on earth.\"                                                   – [Yajurveda Ch. 31, verse 2, pg. 302 Tr. Devi Chand]\n\n\"Worship Him, Whose beautiful sacrifice, wealth, strength, and mighty glory are enjoyed by the Heaven and Earth; Who is the creator of all beings, the Embodiment of great happiness, All-pervading and Supplier of food.\"                                      – [Yajurveda Ch. 33, verse 23, pg. 312 Tr. Devi Chand]\n\nIt's to be noted that, the second verse states in an interrogative way \"Who is the creator of all beings… All-pervading\" Here again this statement is contradictory to the belief's of Protestant Hindus, in order to prove this lets first define \"beings\". And\"being\"means -\n\nbeing noun [ C or U ]\n\na person or thing that exists or the state of existing\n\n- [Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary CD- ROM, 3rd Edition, © Cambridge University Press 2008]\n\nSo 'being' means – a person or thing that exists or the state of existing. So we ask doesn't 'Prakriti' (Primordial Matter) exist? Doesn't 'Ātmā' (Human Souls) exist? Yes of course they do, as stated by Moolshankar. Then how can 'Ishwar' be the 'creator of all beings' when Prakriti and Ātmā are uncreated? Then is 'Ishwar' creator of them? No, as stated by Moolshankar, then why is it stated in the above quoted verse of Yajurveda that the \"All-prevading\" (i.e Ishwar) is the \"Creator of all beings\"? This is nothing but pure contradiction which is repeated in many of the Vedic verses.Later, in the article we'll see that Ishwar is not the creator of 'time'…etc\n\nQuestions which mavericks like us would like to ask –\n\na) How can 'Ishwar' be 'creator of all' (or 'creator of all beings') as claimed by protestant Hindus when, they themselves believe(state) in uncreated-ness of 'Prakriti' and 'Ātmā'?\n\nb) Who created 'prakriti', if 'Ishwar' – the Protestant Hindu God, didn't? [Rationally it's impossible to prove uncreated-ness ofPrakriti , especially when those claiming this are also claiming to be Monotheistic.]\n\nc) Who created 'Ātmā', if 'Ishwar' – the Protestant Hindu God, didn't? [Rationally it's impossible to prove uncreated-ness of Ātmā, especially when those claiming this are also claiming to be Monotheistic.]\n\nThis ameliorates exposure of the reality of protestant Hindu theology in the eyes of Truth-Seeker's. Now coming to some amazing facts, which will really expose the distortions (of meanings) from the protestant Hindu cult.\n\nMoolshankar wrote in Satyarth Prakāsh Ch.1 pg. 5 (quoting Kaivalya Upanishad) –\n\n\"He is called Brahma – the Creator of the Universe…\"\n\nAnd, in the footnotes the translator Dr. Chiranjiva comments\"The word Creator used in the sense of Maker as according to Vedic Philosophy there is no such thing as creation or the evolution of something out of nothing.\"\n\nAlso we find Agniveer the Hate-Monger, Islāmophobe confessing and admitting the fact that –\n\n \n\"GOD NEVER CREATED US.\n\nAnd because God never created us, He also never destroys us. Creation and destruction of soul is NOT the scope of work of God. Thus, just as God is beginningless and endless, so are we. We have existed along with God always and shall continue to do so.\"\n\n– [Source - http:\/\/agniveer.com\/1985\/why-did-god-create-us\/]\n\nNow astonishingly, we learn, that in the so-called \"Vedic Philosophy\" there's nothing like \"Creation out of nothing\" and that the word \"Creator\" is used in \"Sense of Maker\". One would be tempted to question, Why not simply use the word 'Maker' why use the word 'Creator'? The answer to it is simple, to fool people and blind-followers (protestant Hindus).As how can one believe in a 'God' who is not the Creator but just the Maker or Fashioner of it.\n\nSo we are left with the philosophical excreta of philosopher's brains that's \"there is no such thing as creation or the evolution of something out of nothing.\"\n\nAnd we also see how the hate-monger Agniveer tries to get his incoherent, unintelligible belief, explained with few nonsensical words like \"Creation and destruction of soul is NOT the scope of work of God\", we wonder 'What's the Scope of God'? Does scope even apply on GOD?Is God something like created beings that 'Scope' applies to him, or is Agniveer trying to anthropomorphise God and apply Human-related characteristics\/attributes to Him? By the way, is God(according to Agniveer)some sought of professional , for instance an Accountant , who's been asked to handle Software engineers post , and cries out saying \"It's out of my scope of work!!\" It's pretty disgusting to see people insulting God by using such vernacular (like \"Creation and destruction of soul is NOT the scope of work of God\"). We do not think that such a statement needs a refutation (still we shall expose such irrationalities for those people seeking truth); such obscurely illogical statement arises out of pure ignorance of monotheism and pure blind following (as in case of Agniveer). We will be dealing with the reasons and causes of such irrational statement in our next subsection, wherein those reasons and causes shall be refuted and debunked.\n\nIt will be worthwhile and of immense benefit to state one verse from the Holy, Noble Qur'ān wherein Allāh Azz wa Jall (the alone worthy of worship, One true Almighty God) says which means –\n\n        \"Do they attribute as partners to Allāh those who created nothing\"                                                                                                    – [Surah al-A'raaf, Ayat 191]\n\nSo true! See the misery and state of these Protestant Hindus, how they worship those who create not! These poor protestant Hindus set up partners (by worshipping Ishwar who creates nothing) with Allāh who alone is the true Almighty God, the creator of Al -'Alamîn [Total Creation]. We would ask our reader's and especially the truth seeker's to see[and learn a lesson, so that you may not fall into the same dark pit] how these protestant Hindus have wronged themselves by worshipping false God , who is unable to create anything.\n\nFor now we'll leave the reader's and truth-seeker's with this verse and let them ponder upon it and contemplate whether they are on truth or falsehood, now coming back -\n\nSo this only proves that Ishwar (Protestant Hindu God) is Incapable of –\n\n1)      Creating Prakriti (Primordial Matter) and Ātmā (Human Souls).\n\n2)      Destroying, Annihilating Prakriti and Ātmā.\n\nThis sufficiently proves that Incapability is an attribute (characteristic) of 'Ishwar'. This also proves that 'Ishwar' isn't omnipotent or All-Powerful. But Moolshankar seems to state something opposite to it, he states (quoting Rigveda) –\n\n\"…Mayest thou (Vishnu) O Omnipresent and (Urukrama) Omnipotent Being, shower Thy blessings all around us…\"                                                                                                                               -[Satyarth Prakash Ch. 1,pg.2 Tr. Dr.Chiranjiva Bhardawaja ]\n\nSo what does \"Omnipotence\" mean? Let's have it defined –\n\nOmnipotent        adjective formal\n\nhaving unlimited power; able to do anything\n\n- [Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary CD- ROM, 3rd Edition, © Cambridge University Press 2008]\n\nAll the words, like Omnipotent, All-Powerful, creator are just empty words used by Moolshankar & Co. for deluding people and poor blind-followers of his (Moolshankar). As we read earlier that , if Ishwar isn't able to create \"Prakriti\" and \"Ātmā\" then this inability of creating things renders him free of the title \"Creator\" and  also this raises questions on Ishwar's \"Omnipotence\". These questions will be dealt, in the later part of the section, for now let's see whether Moolshankar , believed in \"Omnipotence\" of \"Ishwar\"?(We've seen a quote above , now let's see his belief in detail).\n\nMoolshankar was and ardent believer of \"Ishwar's\" Omnipotence (at least he made it seem so), we read in various places in Satyarth Prakāsh, where he claims God to be Omnipotent, All-Powerful.\n\n\"Vayu: the Omnipotent\nBeing,\"                                                                                                                                  – (Satyrath Prakash Ch 1, pg.71 Tr. Durga Prasad)\n\n \n\"The verse means: May (bhavatu) the Infinite Spirit (Parmatma) who is Omnipotent\"                                                                                                                                                                – (Satyrath Prakash Ch 1, pg.77 Tr. Durga Prasad)\n\n\"O Lord Thou Who art the Protector of the universe and the Veda, and art Omnipotent, Omnipresent…\"\n\n-(Satyarth Prakash Ch. 10,pg.368 Tr. Dr.Chiranjiva Bhardawaja )\n\nHence, we learn that Moolshankar did believe in Omnipotence of his Ishwar, but was this Omnipotence true? Or what did Moolshankar mean by Omnipotence? As stated earlier \"Omnipotence\", \"All-Powerful\" et al. are just empty words for Moolshankar, this will be evident below. In fact, Moolshankar goes on to distort the meanings of words like \"All-Powerful\" and \"Omnipotence\" to fit his beliefs, for instance \"Omnipotence\" according to him does not mean \"having unlimited power; able to do anything\".\n\nAgniveer the fanatical Protestant Hindu-extremist, hate-monger also affirms and believes in the so-called All-Powerful Ishwar, he wrote –\n\n\"Finally, Yajurveda 40.8 lists the properties of Ishwar as follows:\n\nParyagat – Omnipresent,\nShukram – All-powerful,\"\n\n-  [Source - http:\/\/agniveer.com\/1566\/eternity-of-vedas\/]\n\nElsewhere too, with vigor same is stated by this mere hate- monger –\n\n\"But Vedic Ishwar is truly all-Powerful…\"\n\n                                                                 – [Source -http:\/\/agniveer.com\/2728\/more-on-vedic-god\/ ]\n\nBut according to him (Moolshankar) it's (omnipotence's meaning) something different, this is what he answered when a questioned, regarding Ishwar's inability of creating \"prakriti\".\n\nQ – God being Omnipotent, He can also create prakriti – the primordial matter – and the soul. If He cannot, He cannot be called Omnipotent.\n\nA. – We have explained the meaning of the word Omnipotent before. But does Omnipotent mean one who can work even the impossibilities. If there be one who can do even such impossible things as the production of an effect without a cause, then can He make another God, Himself die, suffer pain, become dead and inert, inanimate, unjust, impure and immoral or not? Even God cannot change the natural properties of things as heat of the fire, Fluidity of liquids and inertness of earth, etc. His laws being true and perfect, He cannot alter them.Omnipotence, therefore, only means that He possesses the power of doing all His works without any help.                                        -[Satyarth Prakash Ch. 8, pg.251 Tr. Dr.Chiranjiva Bhardawaja ]\n\nPrimarily, it's to be noted that Moolshankar states he has explained the meaning of word Omnipotence, earlier in the book, on which we'll expound soon. Secondarily, we learn that according to Moolshankar omnipotence isn't the ability to do anything but only means \"the power of doing all His works without any help.\"(This is moolshankar's proposed definition). We see Moolshankar, distorting the meaning of Omnipotence in order to hide the fact that Ishawar isn't omnipotent or All-Powerful and this factuality is impossible to grasp for any believer (theist) in God, hence in order to delude people and his own self Moolshankar indulges in namely two things – Distortion of meaning and Sophistry.\n\na.2) Is Ishwar Omnipotent (All-Powerful) and what does Omnipotence mean to protestant Hinduism?\n\nNow coming to the \"explanation\" of the meaning of Omnipotence by Moolshankar, which he stated to have explained earlier, wherein he uses sophistry in order prove his beliefs, which is quite amusing(hilarious) to read.\n\nIn order to, prove that his (Moolshankar) meaning ('proposed definition') of 'Omnipotence' and conception of God is correct,Moolshankar disgustingly, indulges in sophistry. These question explain the situation to us –\n\nIs God All-powerful or not?\n\nA. – Yes, He is, but what you understand by the word All- powerful is not right. It really means that God does not require the least assistance from any person in all His works such as Creation, Sustenance and Dissolution of the Universe, and administration of Divine Justice. In other words, He does all His works with His own infinite power.                                      – [ Satyarth Prakash , Ch 7,pg 208 ,Tr. Dr. Chiranjiva]\n\nBut we believe that God can do whatever He likes. There is no one above Him.\n\nA.     - What does He like? If you say that he likes and can do all things, we ask – \"Can God kill Himself?\" Or\"can He make other Gods like Himself, become ignorant, commit sins such as theft, adultery and the like? Or can He be unhappy?\" Your answer can only be in the negative, as these things are opposed to the nature and attributes of God; hence your contention, that God can do all things, does not hold good. Our meaning only, therefore, of the word All-powerful is true.                                                                   – [ Satyarth Prakash , Ch 7,pg 208 ,Tr. Dr. Chiranjiva]\n\n \nWe would also like to quote the hate monger, Islāmophobe Agniveer, so as to expose his ignorance, this Islāmophobe wrote -\n\nQ: Is Ishwar Omnipotent or All-Powerful?\n\nA: Yes, He is omnipotent. But that does not mean He can do whatever He wants. Doing whatever one may want is sign of indiscipline. On contrary, Ishwar is most disciplined. Omnipotence means that Ishwar does not need help of any other entity to conduct His duties – creation, management, destruction of universe. He is self-sufficient to conduct His duties. But He would act only as per His duties. For example,He will not kill Himself to create another Ishwar. He cannot make Himself an idiot. He cannot do theft or dacoity etc.\n\n-  [Source - http:\/\/agniveer.com\/2708\/understanding-vedic-god\/ ]\n\n \nThese (above) emphasized (by us) interrogative questions were asked by Moolshankar (& Agniveer) to prove that his god (Ishwar)is not omnipotent (as per the meaning of the word) in true sense but has limited omnipotence. Moolshankar (so does Agniveer)seems very eager and zealous to prove that his god (Ishwar) is not at all omnipotent in true sense, but merely is called so. Moolshankar seems to be trying pretty hard, to prove his definition of \"Omnipotence\" to be true, but drastically fails at it, as will be evident. Now coming to his silly, hilarious questions:\n\nFirstly it's to be noted that Moolshankar, states (assumes) that the answers to the questions will be in negative, I wonder why didn't the questioner reply or why wasn't his reply (in detail or were these questions and answers made-up by himself, that's the case most probably) stated in Satyarth Prakash . Now replying to the insinuations and irrationality of Moolshankar and Agniveer.\n\nWe would be pleasured to ask –\n\nDo these attributes or qualities\/characteristics (Killing, ignorance, theft, adultery…etc.) befit Almighty God or belong to him? Of course not, Moolshankar also agrees by writing \"these things are opposed to the nature and attributes of God\". Now, we would like to question, how come these things are applied to God? Also, it's should be noted that these are qualities of humans and not of God, so how can these be applied to God or how could one judge God's capability in terms of these [human] acts? Same deviant principle of judging and understanding God in human context and human attributes is followed by Agniveer , our readers need not get surprised after all Agniveer is a mere blind-follower of Moolshankar .We read Agniveer stating \"Doing whatever one may want is sign of indiscipline. On contrary, Ishwar is most disciplined\" What a show of irrationality and illogicalness! This statement of Agniveer show's us his 'conceptualization' of God. What Agniveer states here is pure irrationality, God the Almighty is the creator of Discipline and hence he is not subjected to it , we wonder how could Agniveer even think of such a thing , he judges God in the light of human attributes and behavior!\n\nHence the so-called argument that doing whatever one wants is a sign of indiscipline is only applied to humans and not to God Almighty. Also, another aspect should be pointed out is that God Almighty by nature and definition is the Most-Perfect or All-Perfect, hence the one who's perfect by nature needs no discipline at all, on contrary it's only those who have the tendency to get deviated (like humans, animals…etc) and indulge in non-disciplinary acts and behavior need discipline and are subjected to it or judged by it.\n\nThis understanding of God in scales of human attributes and behavior, only show the anthropomorphic tendencies of Agniveer and his gross incoherency. To enlighten Agniveer we would present here, what Allāh Azz wa Jall (the only One True Almighty God) says which means:\n\n                                         \"There is nothing like Him(Allāh)\"\n\n                                                                                                    – [Surah Ash- Shura Ayat 11]\n\nThis verse proves and shows the obligation of rejection and negation of resembling God the Most Perfect, with His creation or anything else. This is what we Muslims believe, in fact this is the most basic and fundamental principle which we Muslims are taught at first, hence as stated above, there is no similitude, resembling, likeness of God [There is nothing like Him], so are his attributes [His attributes are perfectly Unique , and have no resembling, Similitude], hence we ask Protestant Hindus, to ponder upon it and we think and Agniveer too comes under Protestant Hinduism, so we would also ask him to humbly ponder upon this truly, great and glorious principle which every theist should believe in. This principle will help Agniveer get rid of his anthropomorphic tendencies – understanding God in light of Human attributes\/context\/behavior, as this verse makes clear that there is nothing like unto God.\n\nWe've also read what Moolshankar wrote; in fact both Agniveer and Moolshankar suffer from same disease of sophism, and irrationality [moreover both have the anthropomorphic tendency of understanding God and judging him in Human behavioral patterns, attributes]. Questions (like 'Can God Kill Himself '…et al.) asked by Moolshankar and Agniveer are similar [like both ask whether God can kill himself and create gods…etc], hence we would refute and debunk the questions (insinuations) asked by Moolshankar, and indirectly Agniveer's questions will be debunked too.\n\nNow coming back to the 'questions' of Moolshankar –\n\nAnd we would now again like to ask \"Why would God need to steal something, when he is the creator of that thing and can create it?\" Yeah, only the Protestant Hindu god (Ishwar) would need to steal things as he is not the Creator but only the efficient cause (acc. to Protestant Hindu Theology), as prakriti (Primordial Matter) is eternal and uncreated like God , so it is possible that he could steal a bit from prakriti (Primordial Matter).So why would God Almighty need to steal? It's ridiculous of Moolshankar to ask such hilarious and incoherent questions and this only adds up to his ignorance.\n\nNow scrutinizing a bit more, Moolshankar also questions 'can He[God] become ignorant, commit sins such as theft, adultery and the like' this is really hilarious and irrational. By scrutinizing and observing questions similar and those asked by him we, learn a lot of Moolshankar's state of mind and the basis of his belief system. We'll see questions similar to Moolshankar's first to show the real problem in his approach and then refute his questions.\n\nBasically what Moolshankar is trying to ask \"If God can do anything, can He make it impossible for him-self to do something [like adultery, theft…etc]?\"\n\nSuch question's becomes even clearer when we examine a related question: \"Can God create an uncreated being?\" The problem here is that the questioner has already defined the being to be uncreated and then proceeds to ask for something that contradicts that definition. The problem is in the questioner's terms, not any lack in God's potential. The same is true when asking God to make a circle with four sides. Having already provided a definition of a circle that could never include a four-sided figure, such a question is absurd. Something is certainly self-contradictory here, but it is the questioner's terminology and not the omnipotence of God. The answer to the question (Can God kill Himself?) of Moolshankar is-. Well, killing (death) isn't ability; it's the inability to live moreover death is a creation (death is created and God's uncreated) of God, so it's quite irrational to ask such questions as creation can never overcome the creator in any sense. The immortal cannot die because that defies His attribute of immortality. Similarly, the omnipotent cannot create a task that He can't complete because such a task is merely a figment of one's imagination and could not exist, not because He is incapable.Can God make 1=2? Well if 1=2, then it wouldn't be 1! So the idea is self-contradictory, not God.\n\nThe question also reminds us of the idea of what happens when an immovable rock meets an unstoppable force? The two things cannot exist in the same universe. Likewise, if God exists then all things which contradict His attributes are imaginary, non-existent and impossible. They are forever bound to the realm of imagination and cannot be brought into existence.\n\nSimilar is the question (of Moolshankar) \"can He make other Gods like Himself\" .In fact the phrase \"can He make other Gods like Himself\" is explicit sophism or false\/invalid argument, and is a contradiction in terms, because the mere fact that something is created ('can He make') means that it cannot be a God. This question is like asking could God create \"a god who is not a god?\" It is self-evident that the answer can only be: The power of God has nothing to do with that, because the idea that something can be a god and not a god is illogical and is irrational, and the power and might of God has nothing to do with irrationalities.\n\nIn fact all the questions asked by Moolshankar and Agniveer are just instances of sophism and are self-contradiction –\n\n-          \"Can God kill Himself?\"\n\n-          \"Can He (God) make other Gods like Himself, become ignorant, commit sins such as theft, adultery and the like?\n\n-          \"Can He (God) be unhappy?\"\n\nGod is eternal and uncreated[in fact even Moolshankar attest to this , that his god Ishwar is eternal and uncreated] by nature and definition hence God killing himself is irrational and contradictory in terms , also Killing (or dying) is a human's act or attribute, like Humans kill humans, Humans die. So what we see is Moolshankar first defining God to be uncreated and eternal then posing a sophistic questions which are purely contradictory and irrational , Moolshankar is only contradicting himself.\n\nAs for creating God then again God is Uncreated and eternal, hence what is created cannot be god so it's irrational and spurious even to think of such absurdities.\n\nSame for questions like, 'can God become Ignorant', God by nature is All-wise and All-Knowledgeable hence again its contradiction and irrational, also things like ignorance, adultery sins, theft are all instances of human behaviors, attributes or actions and in no way can they ever be applied to God or used to judge God. Same with being \"Unhappy\", being happy and unhappy are human attributes\/characteristics and traits, not of God ,also these things contradict God's attribute of Perfection(All-Perfect) hence God by nature being perfect is not subject to such things and state, such queries are but contradiction. As God exists hence all things which contradict His attributes are imaginary, non-existent and impossible. They are forever bound to the realm of imagination and cannot be brought into existence. Also the Power, Majesty and Might of Almighty God have nothing to do with Irrationalities.\n\nHence we see Moolshankar using sophistry (false-invalid arguments) to prove that \"Omnipotence\" in fact means \"the power of doing all His works without any help.\"  And not \"able to do anything\" which in fact, is the true and right definition of being Omnipotent.\n\nConcluding, it will be beneficial to note, how Moolshankar uses his irrationality and Sophistry to prove things. Like first he defines Ishwar as uncreated and beginning-less and then questions whether \"God can kill himself?\" that's so self-contradictory and irrational of him. Again and again he repeats his irrational questions like \"can He(God) make other Gods like Himself\" , same here he as defined and stated God to be \"Uncreated\" , then ask can God makeother Gods? This is what happens when you swallow the excreta of philosopher's brain. This is pure irrationality and this will be evident, even to novice or amateur, let's see what a mathematician opines about such ridiculous questions.\n\nMathematician's Opinion –\n\nSumming up the section, I would like to present a short quote from a revert to Islām – Dr. Jeffrey Lang, a mathematician [Professor of Mathematics at University of Kansas, US] (an ex-atheist)] –\n\n\"If God is all-powerful, can He become a man, terminate His existence, tell a lie, be unjust, or create a stone too heavy for even Him to move? These somewhat silly riddles most often arise from imposing unnecessary and contradictory assumptions on certain attributes of God or by assigning unwarranted additional attributes to Him.\"\n\n- [\"Even Angels Ask\", Dr. Jeffrey Lang, pg. 69, Beltsville, 1997]\n\nWe are pretty sure that every intelligent, sane and unbiased person will believe such 'questions' to be silly, and illogical.\n\nIt would also be beneficial (concisely) to state the reasons why Moolshankar delved into such absurdities which are totally untenable. It's necessary to note that Moolshankar was reluctant enough to apply (judge and understand) human attributes to God in order to prove his point; also his conception of God in his mind was somewhat anthropomorphic in essence. This also shows how Moolshankar swallowed the excreta of philosophers and atheists' (in fact, sophistry was chiefly used by atheist to disprove God and his existence) brain in order to forward his claims, delude people from the straight path and malign and corrupt monotheism.\n\nIslāmic Stance –\n\nTo enlighten people about Islām and present a true picture of Islām (which the Hate-monger's and quacks like Mahendra Pāl, Agniveer cowardly and hypocritically don't do, due to their bias, prejudice and hate for Islām.) we'll shortly and very briefly present Islāmic point of view here, very concisely for our readers and truth Seekers –\n\nWho's the Creator?\n\nAllāh the Most-Merciful says which means,\n\n\"That is Allāh, your Lord, the Creator of all things, Lā ilāha illā Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He). How then are you turning away (from Allāh, by worshipping others instead of Him)?\"                               – [Surah Al-Mu'min , Ayat 62]\n\nSee you O, protestant Hindus your only One True Almighty God (Allāh) states that He is the Creator of all things; still you turn away from Him and worship false-god?\n\nAnd in another verse of the Noble, Holy Qur'ān, Allāh Azz wa Jall says which means,\n\n\"Such is Allāh, your Lord(none has the right to be worshipped but He), the Creator of all things.So worship Him (Alone), and He is the Wakîl (Trustee, Disposer of affairs or Guardian) over all things.\" – [Surah, Al-An'aam, Ayat 102]\n\nAgain theonly One True Almighty God (Allāh) states that He alone is the Creator of all things and calls every of his creation to worship Him alone.\n\nIs God (Allāh) Omnipotent or All-Powerful?\n\nAllāh the Most-Merciful says which means,\n\n\"Truly, Allāh is Ever Most Powerful, All-Wise.\"          – [Surah An-Ni'saa, Ayat 56]\n\n\"Verily, Allāh is Ever Oft-Pardoning, All-Powerful.\"    – [Surah An-Ni'saa, Ayat 149]\n\n\"Truly, Allāh is All-Knowing, All-Powerful.\"                 – [Surah An-Nahl, Ayat 70]\n\n\"Verily, Allāh is All-Powerful, All-Mighty.\"               – [Surah Al-Mujaadilah, Ayat 21]\n\nWe think the above quoted verses speak for themselves; we need not re-write what the verses make so explicitly evident. We learn that Allāh Azz wa Jall is Omnipotent unlike the protestant Hindu god Ishwar who isn't, moreover he (Ishwar) is dependent over other to 'engineer' hence is not even the creator- we'll expound on this issue later in the article.\n\nWe all know that Al-Qur'ān al-Kareem cannot be translated, it's a well known fact attested by approximately every Arabic scholar be it Muslim or non-Muslim, Al-Qur'ān is perfectly unique and hence there is no question that it's glory and perfection can be conveyed in any other language except that in which it was revealed (we can only try and convey interpretation of its meanings), and even the famous briton 'translator' of the Qur'an Marmaduke Pickthall(An famous English literati who reverted to Islām)confessed saying -\n\n\"The Koran cannot be translated… It is only an attempt to present the meaning of the Koran and peradventure something of the charm in English. It can never take the place of the Koran in Arabic, nor is it meant to do so.\"\n\n- [The Meanings of the Glorious Koran, pg. vii, Alfred A. Knopp Inc., 1930]\n\n \nWhat we can do, is somehow show and translate the interpretation of meanings of Glorious, Noble Qur'ān, in different languages.Hence it's to be understood that all the Qur'ānic verse quoted here in the article are mere interpretation of the meanings of the Noble Qur'ān.\n\nStrengthen your Understanding –\n\nSummarizing this sub-section (i.e. 'A) Is Protestant Hinduism Monotheistic?'), we would like to review what we've learnt about protestant Hindu theology, their creedal system and Protestant Hindus –\n\n1) Ishwar(Protestant Hindu God) isn't the 'Creator' but simply the 'Maker' , 'Engineer' ,'Fashioner' of the world , as he didn't create Prakriti (Primordial matter) nor Ātmā (Human Souls)  as per Protestant Hindu Theology. What does this necessitate?\n\n\n\tThis belief itself proves protestant Hinduism to be non-Monotheistic, as in Monotheistic belief everything is dependent on God, but here 2 entities namely Prakriti (Primordial matter) and Ātmā are independent. Where as God is dependent on Prakriti (Primordial matter) for 'Making' 'engineering' 'Fashioning' Universe …etc things out of it.\n\n\tThis belief rips God of his one main and very important attribute that's Uniqueness , Ishwar(Protestant Hindu God) isn't unique as he share's the very same attribute with Prakriti (Primordial matter) and Ātmā , that is attributes like 'Uncreated' ,'Beginning less' .This make's Vedic God (Ishwar) a mere artificer and Demiurge , which results to pure Polytheism.\n\n\tThis belief also , entitlesPrakriti (Primordial matter) and Ātmā (Human Souls)   to be Partners of God, in being 'Uncreated' and in 'Making' and 'engineering' of Universe as the Protestant Hindu God(Ishwar) is dependent on both Ātmā(Human Souls)  and Prakriti (Primordial matter) to bring about this Universe. This in Islām is known as Shirk orAssociationism, which is in fact polytheism. Hence Protestant Hinduism by nature is Polytheistic.\n\n\tWe've also proved that protestant Hinduism doesn't regard its God to be 'Omnipotent' or All-Powerful and their use of these words is totally futile as these are used just used in empty sense without affirming the meanings of these words.\n\n\n2) We've also learnt and seen how Moolshankar and his blind-follower Agniveer use Sophistry to prove their point.\n\nThere are many other points and proofs which expose the falsity of the protestant Hinduism being Monotheistic, these points and proofs shall be discussed and stated in the next sub-section.\n","publisher":{"@id":"#Publisher","@type":"Organization","name":"VedKaBhed.Com Fast Server","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"\/wp-content\/themes\/jannah\/assets\/images\/logo@2x.png"}},"sourceOrganization":{"@id":"#Publisher"},"copyrightHolder":{"@id":"#Publisher"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"\/index.php\/2014\/01\/01\/concept-of-god-in-arya-samaj-protestant-hinduism-part-1\/","breadcrumb":{"@id":"#Breadcrumb"}},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Ved Ka Bhed","url":"\/author\/solomon246rezarprotonmail-com\/"}}</script>
