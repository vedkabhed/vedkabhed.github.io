										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-family: arial black, sans-serif;">Analysis of Lingam (updated)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Written by Sulaiman Razvi</p>
<p>The meaning of Shiva Ling or Lingam has become a subject of controversy in recent times. Hindus revere the Shiv Ling. Hindu god Shiva is considered “The Destroyer” part of Trimurti and he is also considered the Ascetic god. The early scholars of Hinduism didn’t lay stress on the meaning of Shivling, it was only in recent times when Hinduism was exposed to foreigners that some Hindu scholars started giving their definitions. Hindus insist that Shivling isn’t a male genital organ despite Hindu scriptures defining Shivling as Shiva’s penis, it&#8217;s obvious that Hindus are embarrassed by this definition of Shivling. When dealing with such issues we have to look deep into its history. Shiva Lingam actually a Phallic (male erected generative organ) emblem is considered a symbol by present-day Hindu scholars. We can find traces of Phallus or Shiva Lingam worshipers in the Rig Veda which is the oldest scripture of Hinduism, Rig Veda Mandal 7, Sukta 21, verse 5 mentions Shishnadeva which is literally translated as Penis worshippers (Sishna+Deva), we read that the ancient Aryans were hostile towards these worshipers. However, its meaning is obscure as some scholars consider the word Shishandeva to be “lewd people” or “unchaste people”, it could be that those people were considered unchaste on account of them being Phallus worshippers. When you tell any Hindu that Shivling is penis, he would reply that the Sanskrit word Shisan is generally used for penis and not Ling, but they would deny that Shishandeva mentioned in Rigved is penis worshippers as they have unending excuses to defend their Dharm.</p>

<h1><strong><span style="color: initial;">The meaning of Ling</span></strong></h1>

[Student’s Sanskrit English Dictionary 1893 edition, By V.S Apte, page 311]
<p>ISKCON scholars give the following meaning,</p>
<p>“lingam — phallic symbol which is used in the worship of Lord Śiva.” [Source: <a href="http://www.prabhupada-books.de/gita/glossary/glossary_L.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">http://www.prabhupada-books.de/gita/glossary/glossary_L.html<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>]
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">It is mentioned in Mahabharata,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Mahabharata Anushasana Parva 13, section, 14, verses 230-1 …all creatures bear the signs that mark Mahadeva and his spouse. Hence, all creatures must be regarded as belonging to Maheswara. All creatures of the feminine sex, have sprung from Ulna’s nature as their cause, and hence it is they bear the mark of femininity that distinguishes Uma; while all creatures that are masculine, having sprung from Siva, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">bear the masculine mark that distinguishes Siva</span>…” Tr. K.M. Ganguly</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">So what is that masculine mark that distinguishes a male person? It’s obviously the male organ (penis). And it is that which distinguishes Siva also. The pedestal of Shivling is Yoni which translates as Vagina. The meaning of Ling and Yoni itself should dispel doubt about Shivling not being a </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">male genital organ.</span> </span></p>
<h1><strong><span style="color: initial;">Rishis cutting o</span><span style="color: initial;">f</span><span style="color: initial;">f Bhikshatan’s (Shiva) Penis in Darunavam forest </span></strong></h1>
<p>There are mainly two versions of Shivling origin. One which proves Shivling as a male organ and another one appear as a measureless cosmic pillar, this too has a story which proves Shivling to be penis. But the Shivling as penis version is emphasized in the Hindu scriptures which is why this version has a group of stories on the origin of the Shivling. But the most repeated story is that of Shiva going to Darunvanam forest in his Bhikshatana avatar which is his “Supreme Beggar” form and is depicted as a nude man. Rishis resided in Daruvanam forest with their families, Shiva went to Darunavam forest fully nude holding a begging bowl in hand and as per some text he appeared there in front of the wives and daughters of Rishis with an erected penis, he enchanted the wives and daughters of Rishis which according to me is nothing but molestation. No person in the right mind would appear naked with an erected penis in front of women, in the modern world the person would be behind bars on sexual harassment charges. Coming to the point, this angered the Rishis who started beating up Shiva (Bhikshatana) and cut off his penis, as per some version the penis fell down due to the curse by sages, that penis grew larger and wreaked havoc on the earth, and Rishis went to Brahma to stop it but he recommended Rishis to propitiate Shiva. As advised by Brahma, the Rishis begged Shiva to withdraw his Ling, Shiva agreed on one condition that Rishis make a pedestal akin to Parvati’s vagina which will hold the Ling, and that the Rishis should start worshipping it. Rishis did as told by Shiva and that’s how Shivling came to be worshipped. Let’s go through Hindu texts and read about different versions on the origin of Shivling.</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Kotirudra Samhita 4, chapter 12, verses 8-51 “Once the leading Brahmin devotees of Siva engrossed in the meditation of Siva went into the forest for bringing sacrificial twigs. In the meantime Siva himself assuming a very hideous form came there in order to test their devotion. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">He was very brilliant but stark naked</span>. He had smeared ashes all over his body as the sole ornament. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Standing there and holding his penis he began to show all sorts of vicious tricks</span>. It was with a mind to do something pleasing to the forest-dwellers that Siva, favourite of the devotees, came to the forest at his will. The wives of the sages were extremely frightened at this sight. The other women excited and surprised approached the lord. Some embraced him. Others held his hands. The women were engrossed in struggling with one another…When the naked sage did not reply, the great sages told that terrible Puruṣa. “You are acting pervertedly. This violates the Vedic path. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Hence let your penis fall on the ground</span>.” When they said thus, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">the penis of that Avadhūta, who was Śiva of wonderful form, fell down instantly. That penis burnt everything in front; wherever it went it began to burn everything there</span>. It went to Pātāla; it went to heaven; it went all over the earth; it never remained steady anywhere. &#8220;When the naked sage did&#8230;Brahmā said:— Let the gods propitiate goddess <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Pārvatī and pray. If she can assume the form of the vaginal passage that penis will become steady</span>&#8230;The penis shall be drenched with that water, O great sages. When the sprinkling is made with Śatarudrīya mantras it will become stable. Pārvatī in the form of the Vaginal passage and an auspicious arrow shall form as the pedestal wherein the phallus shall be installed in accompaniment of the Vedic mantras&#8230;After propitiating Pārvatī and the bull-bannered lord and performing the rites mentioned before, the excellent penis became static&#8230; Śiva became delighted and so also Pārvatī, the mother of the universe. That phallus was held by her in that form then.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Following is another translation of this passage by Shiva Sharan (Alain Daniélou),</p>
<p><span style="color: #353535; background-color: #ffffff;">Shiva Purana, Kothi Rudra Samhita 4.12.17-46</span> <span style="color: #353535; background-color: #ffffff;">“</span><span style="color: #353535; background-color: #ffffff;">Shocked by the appearance and behaviour of Shiva, the sages of the forest said to him, ‘You have acted perversely. That is contrary to the scriptures. </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000; background-color: #ffffff;">Your sexual organ will fall to the ground’. When they had thus spoken, the sexual organ of this messenger of Heaven, who was none other than Shiva of the marvellous forms, at once fell to the ground</span><span style="color: #353535; background-color: #ffffff;">. The phallus burned everything before it; wherever it went, all was consumed. It travelled through the under-world, in heaven and on the earth, never staying in one place. All the worlds and their inhabitants lived in anguish. The sages were struck with dismay. The gods, and the sages knew neither peace nor pleasure any more. [all the sages then went to God Brahma] and Brahma continued, ‘As long as this Phallus is not in a fixed position, no good can come to any of the three worlds. </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000; background-color: #ffffff;">In order to calm its wrath, you must sprinkle this divine sexual organ with holy water, build a pedestal in the form of a vagina and shaft (symbol of the goddess), and install it with prayers, offerings, prostrations, hymns and chants accompanied by musical instruments</span><span style="color: #353535; background-color: #ffffff;">. Then you shall invoke the god, saying, ‘You are present in everything that exists. The universe is but the form of yourself. O benevolent One! calm yourself and protect the world’. The sages therefore reverently approached Shiva who said to them, </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000; background-color: #ffffff;">‘The world shall not find peace until receptacle is found for my sexual organ. No other being except the Lady of the Mountain [ie., Parvati] may seize hold of my sexual organ</span><span style="color: #353535; background-color: #ffffff;">. If she takes hold of it, </span><span style="color: #353535; background-color: #ffffff;">it will immediately become calm</span><span style="color: #353535; background-color: #ffffff;">.</span><span style="color: #353535; background-color: #ffffff;">”</span><span style="color: #353535; background-color: #ffffff;"> Tr.</span><span style="color: #353535; background-color: #ffffff;"> Shiva Sharan</span> <span style="color: #353535; background-color: #ffffff;">(</span><span style="color: #353535; background-color: #ffffff;">Alain </span>Daniélou)</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">This story is further supported by various other Puranas which I have mentioned below,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Kurma Purana II.38.52 “The sages said: A certain highly brilliant person has entered the holy Daruvana along with his wife, who was very beautiful in all her limbs. But he was naked. The lordly person fascinated our entire women and daughters, with his charming personality. While his beloved defiled our sons. We heaped various imprecations and curses on him but they were defied and set at nought. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">He was beaten soundly by us. His Linga was struck down</span>.” Tr. Ganesh Vasudeo Tagare</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Kurma Purana, Part II, chapter 39, verses 1-3 states,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Kurma Purana II.39.1-3 &#8220;[The sages said:] O lord of all immortal beings, tell us, how we can see the Pinaka-bearing lord once again. You are the saviour of those who seek refuge. [Brahma said:] <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Make an excellent Linga of the Lord resembling the Linga which was seen by you all and struck down on to the ground</span>, and observing celibacy, worship it with respect along with your wives and sons, through the varios Vedic observances.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Brahmanda Purana, Part I, Anusanga Pada 2, chapter 27, verse 45 states,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Brahmanda Purana I.2.27.45 “He [Shiva] was scolded and beaten. <span style="color: #ff0000;">His Linga (?penis) was taken out</span>. It is to alleviate his anger that we have sought refuge in you.” Tr. G.V. Tagare </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">There is also a mixture of the two versions of Shivling origin, following verses from Vamana and Skanda Purana mention the Darunavam story but with the fusion of the penis and cosmic pillar stories. When the penis became endless, Vishnu assumed the form of a boar and digs the earth to find its beginning and Brahma becomes a swan and flies upwards (according to some he flies in his lotus plane) to find its end, on failing to find the beginning or end they return to the same place and accepts Shiva to be the superior god and worships Shiva. There’s also a twist, as per some text Brahma decided to cheat, saying that he had reached the top of the Linga and brought Ketaki flower as proof. Following is Skanda Purana I.1.6.25-44, </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Skanda Purana Māheśvara-khaṇḍa 1, Kedāra-khaṇḍa 1, chapter 6, verses 2-34 &#8220;Lord Śaṃbhu wandered about in the forest Dāruvana for the sake of begging alms. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The sole lord of the worlds with quarters for his garments (i.e. naked)</span>, having the cluster of his matted hair loosened&#8230;At midday the sages, O brāhmaṇas, went to the sacred places (for bath) from their hermitages. At that very time, all the wives of those sages came there. On seeing Śaṃbhu they spoke to one another, “Who is this personage of uncommon appearance, who has come here in the form of a mendicant? We along with our friends shall give him alms.” Saying, “So be it”, they went home and joyously brought various kinds of food as alms&#8230;In this manner all young women gathered together at the place where Śaṅkara was (standing). The alms-bowl of Śaṃbhu was filled with cooked food of very good quality. Four types of foodstuffs with all the six tastes filled his bowl. When Śaṃbhu was desirous of returning to the Kailāsa mountain, all those wives of brāhmaṇas joyously followed him forsaking their domestic duties. With their minds attached to him, they walked on and on (after him)&#8230;When all those wives (of sages) had left thus, the excellent sages reached their hermitages and found them empty and vacant. They spoke to one another, “Where have all these women (our wives) gone? We do not know by what damned fellow they have been abducted.” Pondering and deliberating thus they searched here and there. Thereupon they saw that they had been following Śiva. On seeing Śiva, the sages angrily closed in upon him. Standing in front of Śiva, all of them said with impetuosity, “What has been done by you, O Śaṃbhu (who profess to be) detached and noble-souled? You are no doubt the kidnapper of the wives of others, i.e. of us, the sages.” Although rebuked thus, Śiva silently went on towards his mountain. Then that immutable Mahādeva was overtaken by the sages. (They then cursed him thus:) “<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Since you are the abductor of (our) wives, be instantaneously a eunuch.” Thus cursed by the sages, his penis fell down on the ground</span>. As soon as it reached the ground, it became very large immediately and it increased in size (enormously). From beneath and above, the Liṅga covered the seven Pātālas in an instant. Then it pervaded the entire earth and enveloped the firmament. All the heavens were covered. Then it rose beyond the heavens&#8230;Viṣṇu and the Lotus-bora god Brahmā both of whom were (gods) of exalted fortune, heard this. Viṣṇu went to the nether worlds and Brahmā went to heaven.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">A similar story is mentioned in Vamana Purana chapter 6, verses 57-84 which states that Kama (Cupid) was going to strike Shiva so he went to Daruvanam forest, as Shiva had seduced wives of sages so they cursed him, as a result of the curse Shiva’s penis fell off, Shiva disappeared from the place, all people were terrified, terrible omen ensued.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Vamana Purana 6.57- 84 &#8220;Going there too <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Cupid saw Sankara, and Hara finding him ready to strike, fled from that place</span>. Then pursued by Cupid, Hara entered the frightful pine forest where Rsis were settled with their consorts&#8230;Seeing him enter, the wives of Bhargavas and Atreyas felt excited and completely lost their self control, excepting the unique Arundhati and the lady Anasuya&#8230;Wherever Sankara went women became agitated and with their passion excited, they followed him. Leaving their own hermitages vacant, the wives of the sages followed him, in the same way as the she-elephants follow the he-elephants. O sage, enraged at this sight the Rsis, Bhargavas and Angirasas said, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">&#8216;May his Linga drop down on the earth</span>.&#8217; <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Subsequently the Linga of the deity dropped down</span> rending the earth and the trident-holding Sankara invisible. Thereafter cleaving the earth, the Linga fell down, entered the lower world instantly and rent the universe at the top. Then Hari viewing the measureless Linga and mounting the chief of birds entered the nether world, wonderstruck. O Brahman, making an all round survey from above on his lotus plane Brahman could not reach its end, and returned amazed. O great sage, the Visnu&#8230;visited the seven regions under the earth and later came out, but did not reach its end. Approaching the Linga of Hara both Visnu and Brahman began to propitiate the god with hands folded before him&#8230;The gods said &#8216;O Sankara, withdraw the Linga of yours which was hurled down on the earth. O Lord, for this do we propitiate you. Hara said, &#8216;O Exalted gods, if the gods worship my Linga, then I can take it back and in no other manner.&#8221; Tr. Anand Swarup Gupta</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">A similar story is mentioned in Linga Purana also but it doesn’t mention the bobbitising of Shiva, but the story does say that Shiva went to the forest intending to seduce them as well as to test them, Shiva seduced women of sages by his erotic gestures, </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Linga Purana, Section I, chapter 29, verses 5-36 &#8220;In order to propitiate the lord of Devas, the sages performed a terrible penance in the Daru forest. They were accompanied by their wives, sons and sacrificial fires&#8230;Rudra, wanted to test the sincerity of the dwellers of the Daru forest&#8230;Thus in order to test their faith, and sportively too, he assumed a deformed but attractive appearance. He had three eyes and two hands. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">He was nude</span>, and dark in complexion. Even in this form he was extremely handsome. He was smiling and singing, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">with seductive play of his eyebrows, thereby creating feelings of love in the hearts of women</span>. He the destroyer of cupid, the lord of extremely handsome features increased their sexual feelings On seeing a man of deformed features, black-red (in colour), even the chaste women followed him with great enthusiasm&#8230;One of them, on seeing him did not know that her upper and lower garments had stripped off. Others in their excitement could not distinguish between their kinsmen and the multi-branched trees though they were familiar&#8230;Due to the Maya of Rudra even the chaste ladies fell down in an awkward posture with their clothes loosened and their tresses dishevelled, in the very presence of their husbands…On seeing the crowd of women and Rudra in this situation the brahmins, leading sages began to say harsh words. Their powers of austerity were ineffective against Rudra&#8230;Thus deluded the sages of Daruvanam did not understand Rudra. They spoke harsh words to Rudra who thereupon disappeared. In the morning all those sages with perplexed minds and blurred thinking went from Daruvana to Brahma of noble soul&#8230;they informed him about what had happened in that holy Daru forest&#8230;He stood up with palm joined in reverence and bowed to Rudra. He then spoke hurriedly to the sages who had their abodes in Daru forest. Fie upon you all who had attained excellent treasure, O brahmins, but had unluckily wasted it. The man with a Linga who had been seen by you all without Lingas, the person of deformed features was the supreme lord himself.&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edied by J.L. Shastri</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Here the line &#8220;without Linga&#8221; means impotent men. Mahabharata 13.14.157 states that Shiva had sex with the daughters and wives of Rishis, I assume this is alluding to the Darunvama forest story, </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Mahabarata, Anusasana Parva 13, section 14, verse 157 <span style="color: #353535; background-color: #ffffff;">“He sports with the daughters and wives of the Rishis. His hair is long and erect. He is perfectly nude for he has the horizon for his dress. He has terrible eyes.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Nilkantha Chaturdhara the commentator of Mahabharata wrote,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">“It is known that Siva entered the Pine Forest naked in order to entice the wives of the sages.” Nilkantha Chaturdhara on Mahabharata XIII.17.42, Tr. Wendy Doniger</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">In the Skanda Purana I.i.34.116-129, Parvati the wife of Shiva says that Shiva went to Daruvanam forest nude only to seduce women of sages on the pretext of begging alms, Parvati had denuded Shiva in front of gods and their servants after Shiva lost bet in the game of dice, </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Skanda Purana, Part 1, Mahesvarakhanda book 1, Kedarkhanda section 1, chapter 34, verses 11-129 &#8220;After saying thus, Parvati, the goddess, beloved of Sankara, became furious. She held Sankara by the hand. The lady of slender limbs took away the serpent Vasuki from his neck. Similarly she removed many other ornaments also. The infuriated lady hurriedly took away the ornaments of Sambhu. His crescent moon and his excellent elephant hide removed. The serpents Kambala and Asvatara tha thad been worn by Mahesa as ornaments were removed by the great goddess laughingly with tricky words. Even his loincloth was taken away laughingly with the utterance of tricky words. At that time the Ganas and the friends (of Parvati) felt embarrassed and ashamed. (The friends and others) turned their faces away. Bhrngi of great oenance, Candi, Munda, Mahaloman, Mahodara and many other Ganas became miserable. On seeing them in that plight, Mahesa became ashamed. Sankara who became angry spoke these words to Parvati: &#8216;All these sages are laughing satirically. Similarly Brahma, Visnu and these Devas, Indra and others all of them laughing (at me)&#8230;On being told thus by Sambhu, the Yogin, Parvati, the chaste lady of charming face, laughed and spoke these words: <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">&#8216;What have you to do with a loincloth</span>? You are a sage of sanctified soul. (Some time back) <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">you wandered through Daruvana with the cardinal points alone for your garment (i.e. you were naked). Under the pretext of begging for alms, the wives of the sages were enchanted</span>. While you were going, you were greatly adored by them. Your loincloth fell down (penis?) there&#8230;&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Dharmasamhita of Shiva Purana states that on not getting sexual pleasure from his wife Gauri he went to pine forest with an erect penis, </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Shiva Purana, Dharmasamhita 10.187; 10.78-80 “When Siva failed to be satisfied by making love to Gauri, his wife, he then went naked into the Pine forest in the guise of madman, his linga erect, his mind full of desire, wishing to obtain sexual pleasures with the wives of the sages.” Tr. Wendy Doniger</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Skanda Purana VI.258.1-20 version also states that Shiva was infuriated with the urge to have sexual intercourse but Parvati was doing penance so he tried to calm himself by pouring water on his body, by taking dips in rivers and streams but to no avail, he then went to the abode of sages and seduced women of sages, the sages in anger cursed Shiva’s penis to fall off, the penis fell down instantly due to which blood was oozing out from Shiva. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Skanda Purana, Nāgara-khaṇḍa 6, Tīrtha-māhātmya section 1, chapter 258, verses 1-20 &#8220;When the Daughter of Mountain became engrossed in a great and terrible penance, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Hara who had been overwhelmed by Kandarpa (god of Love)</span> roamed over the earth in the Tirthas, cool shades of trees, rivers, streams everywhere. Mahesvara indulged in sprinkling his body with water. Still the Lord oppressed by Kama, did not attain happiness anywhere&#8230;Mahesa adopted a handsome form and (roamed about on her banks)&#8230;As he passed through the abode of sages at will, he displayed fickle and rash movements of his limbs&#8230;Even as he roamed about thus, the wives of the sages became infatuated and mentally fancied him in the form of their husbands&#8230;The handsome features of the Lord enraged them further. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">They shouted &#8216;Let this fellow be held and beaten</span>. Who is this wicked fellow that has come here?&#8217; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Uttering thus, they took up wooden sticks and rushed at him. Afraid of those noble sages, he fled away</span>&#8230;When they all could not catch hold of Mahesvara, the angry <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Brahmanas cursed Siva thus: &#8216;It was on account of your Linga (penis) that you came to the hermitages like a thief. Since you have abducted other men&#8217;s wives, let your Linga fall on the ground</span>. O Tapasa (ascetic), this terrible curse will affect you immediately.&#8217; As soon as this (curse) was uttered, the tremendous fire of the curse adopted an adamantine form, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">cut off the Linga of Dhurjati and made it fall on the ground. The almightly Lord swooned with his body smeared with blood</span>.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</span></p>
<p>The above passage is also a good response to those who like to play with words. It states that blood was flowing from his body after his Linga (penis) was cut off by sages through the curse, which suggests that the Linga mentioned here is Shiva’s penis and not symbol as claimed by Hindu apologists. Skanda Purana VII.iii.39.5-15 narrates another version which states that Shiva got the urge to have sex after his first wife Sati passed away, then Shiva went to the hermitage of Valakhilya,</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Skanda Purana, book 7 Prabhasa Khanda, Section 3 Arbuda Khanda, chapter 39, verses 5-15 &#8220;When due to humiliation of Dakṣya for not being invited to Yajña, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Satī&#8230;got consumated by death</span>, Kāmadeva taking his bow and arrow of flowers in hand arrived there swiftly. Seeing the invincible Kāmadeva, Śiva then put him as an arrow onto his bow. Apparently out of fear Śiva disappeared. Then he, i.e., Kāmadeva moving about here and there, reached the hermitage of Vālakhilya which was bearing a beautiful look with a good tree outside it. Vālakhilya’s wives then got a glimpse of the handsome Kāmadeva. The group of same women began to embrace the worshipable Liṅga following it up with kissing and repeated touching&#8230;The Sage saw change in the women manifesting all the possibility of their going wayward. Unaware as he was, the great soul simply got enraged with Mahādeva. Heated up with distress, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">he (i.e., the Sage) therefore, to save his wives took out his curse on the worshipable Liṅga of Śiva saying ‘let this worshipable Liṅga fall down</span> for having caused such evils/sins’. A mere sight of the worshipable Liṅga which is reason enough for causing deceit among women is an immediate enemy of the body. Hence, there should be a downfall for this and let this Liṅga fall down.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</span></p>
<h1><strong><span style="color: initial;">Bhrigu cursing Shiva</span></strong></h1>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Srimad Devi Bhagavatam 4.20.36-37 narrates the story of Shiva having sexual intercourse in the forest and was spotted by sage Bhrigu who cursed Shiva, as a result, Shiva’s penis fell off, </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Srimad Devi Bhagavatam book 4, chapter 20, verses 36-37 “O King! When Mahâdeva, being infatuated with Kâma, went into the forest of Bhrigu and becoming naked, began to copulate, the ascetic Bhrigu, seeing him in that state, exclaimed “O You are very shameless” and cursed Him thus:- <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Let your penis drop off just now</span>. Mahâdeva, then to satisfy his thirst for passion, began to drink the water of the lake Amrita Vapî, dug by the Dânavas.” Tr. Swami Vijnananda</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Padma Purana VI.255.26-40 has a slight variation, it states that Bhrigu went to the abode of Shiva to meet him but Shiva was too busy having sex with his wife, moreover Nandi spoke harsh words to Bhrigu which angered Bhrigu, who then cursed Shiva that his form shall be that of Ling in the clitoris. The pedestal of Shivling is Yoni which is vagina/clitoris.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Padma Purana Uttara Khanda 6, chapter 255, verses 26-40 Having gone near the door of the house of the magnanimous Śaṅkara and seeing very fierce Nandin with a spear in his hand, he said (to him): “I, the brāhmaṇa Bhṛgu, have come to see Hara, the best god. Quickly announce me (i.e. my arrival) to the magnanimous Śaṅkara.” Hearing the words of him, Nandin, the lord of (Śiva’s) attendants spoke harsh words to the great sage of an unlimited splendour: “The lord is not in the vicinity. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Śaṅkara is sporting with goddess (Pārvatī)</span>. O best sage, go back if you desire to live.” Thus repudiated by him the (sage) of a great penance remained there, at the door of the great lord, for many days. “<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Since he, arrogant due to the company of a woman, thinks lightly of me, he shall have the form of clitoris</span>. Approached (i.e. overcome) by vice he slights me, a brāhmaṇa! Reduced to an impious state, he will not be adored by brāhmaṇas. Therefore, all the food, water, flowers and oblations offered to him will undoubtedly be useless.” The very lustrous one, having thus cursed Śaṃkara honoured by the world, said to the very fierce attendant, Nandin, holding a spear, O king: “May Śiva’s devotees, having ash, phallus and bones be impious and out of the Vedic fold.” The sage, having thus cursed Rudra, Tripura’s killer, went to Brahmā’s world&#8230;&#8221; Tr. N.A. Deshpande</span></p>
<h1><strong><span style="color: initial;">Self-Castration</span></strong></h1>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">There’s also a story that shows that Shiva himself let his penis fall down. There is a correlating story mentioned in Dharmasamhita of Shiva Purana and Mahabharata which states that Brahma asked Rudra/Shiva to create living beings after which Shiva plunged himself into the water, Brahma waited for a long time, Brahma ran out of patience and then he created living beings, Shiva came out of the water and upon learning that Brahma created all living beings he in anger cast off his penis as it was no longer necessary. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Mahabharata Sauptika Parva 10, section 17, verses 17-26 “After the creatures had multiplied and the Grandsire had become well pleased, the first-born rose from the water and beheld the living creation. He saw that diverse kinds of creatures had been created and that they had multiplied by their own energy.<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;"> At this sight, Rudra became angry and caused his procreative limb to disappear in the bowels of the Earth</span>. The unfading Brahma, soothing him by soft words, said unto him, “O Sharva, what wert thou doing so long within the water? For what reason, also hast thou caused thy <span style="color: #ff0000;">limb of generation to disappear in the bowels of the Earth?</span>” Thus questioned, that lord of the universe wrathfully answered the lord Brahman, “<span style="color: #ff0000;">Somebody else has created all these creatures! What purpose then would be served by this limb of mine</span>? I have by my austerities, O Grandsire, created food for all these creatures. These herbs and plants also will multiply like those that will subsist upon them!” Having said these words, Bhava went away, in cheerlessness and rage, to the foot of the Menjavat mountains for practising severer austerities.” Tr. Kisari Mohan Ganguly</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Shiva Purana, Dharmasamhita 49:23b-46, 74-86 “He agreed to this and laughed, for he was secretly amused, and he said to Brahma, ‘<span style="color: #ff0000;">There</span><span style="color: #ff0000;"> is no good use for this Linga </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">except for the creation of progeny</span>.’ <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">And as he said this he broke it off and threw it upon the surface of the earth</span>. The Linga broke through the earth down to the subterranean hell and went to the very sky. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Vishnu sought the end of it below, and Brahma flew upwards, but they did not find the end of it</span>, for all their vital effort. Then a voice arose out of the sky as the two of them sat there, and it said, ‘If the Linga of the god with braided hair is worshipped, it will certainly grant all desires that are longed for in the heart.’ When Brahma and Vishnu heard this, they and all the divinities worshipped the Linga with devotion, with their hearts set upon Rudra (Shiva).” Tr. Wendy Doniger</span></p>
<p>A Hindu scholar named Swami Parmeshwaranand wrote,</p>
<p>“According to the account given in the Dharmasamhita of the Shiva Purana, during the ekarnava state before creation, Brahma approached Shiva-Rudra and beseeched him to create the universe, Shiva agreed and entered into the vast ocean in order to prepare himself for the enormous task. However, he did not come out of the ocean for a considerably long time. In the meantime, Brahma became fretful; he could not wait any longer and therefore brought about his own creation. When, later, Shiva-Rudra emerged out of the water, he found that the creation had already accomplished. He, there, cut off his generative organ as it was no longer necessary and threw it down on the earth. Since then the Linga became the form in which Shiva came to be worshiped.”- <strong>Encyclopaedic Dictionary of Puranas, Vol 1, By Swami Parmeshwaranand, page 1239</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1><strong><span style="color: initial;">Some verses on importance of Shivling worship</span></strong></h1>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Padma Purana states the importance of Shiv’s Lingam worship, it says that Gayatri turned the curse into a boon,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Padma Purana, Sṛṣṭi-khaṇḍa 1, chapter 17, verses 262-265. &#8220;Then Gāyatrī, the giver of boons said to Rudra: “<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Those, men, who will worship your genital organ (in the form of phallus) even though it had fallen</span>, being purified and earning merit thereby, will share (i.e. enjoy) heaven. That state which men get by worshipping your genital organ (in the form of phallus), cannot be had in (i.e. by) maintaining sacred fire or offering oblations into it. Those who will, in the early morning worship your genital organ (in the form of phallus) with a bilva-leaf, will enjoy the world of Rudra.” Tr. by N.A. Deshpande</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The context of the story is that Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva were cursed by Savitri as Shiva and Vishnu got a woman married to Brahma, infuriated wife of Brahma cursed them in the following way mentioned in Skanda Purana VII.I.165.87-89,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Skanda Purana, Prabhāsa Khaṇḍa 7, Prabhāsa-kṣetra-māhātmya section 1, chapter 165, verses 87-89 &#8220;Similarly the angry lady spoke to Rudra: &#8216;O Hara, while you are in Daruvana, the infuriated sages will curse you (as follows). &#8216;Oh! Kapalika, O insignificant one, you desire to carry off our wives. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Hence this accursed Linga (penis) of yours, O Rudra, will fall on the ground.&#8217; Bereft of manliness</span>, you shall be afflicted with the curse of the sages. Your wife stationed on the banks of Ganga will console you.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">In the following Shiva Purana verse, Shiva’s male organ is considered his symbol,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Shiva Purana, Vidyesvara Samhita 1, chapter 16, verses 104-107 &#8220;The phallus is united with vagina and vagina is united with phallus. For the sake of perpetual enjoyment here and hereafter the devotee shall worship the phallic emblem which is lord Śiva Himself. He is the sun giving birth and sustenance to the worlds. His symbol is justified in the coming into existence of things. Persons should worship Śiva, the cause of birth, in his phallic form. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">That which makes the Puruṣa known, is called Liṅga, the symbol.</span> The unification and fusion of the symbols of Śiva and Śakti is thus called Liṅga.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Linga Purana, Section II, chapter 21, verses 1-3 &#8220;&#8230;Obeisance to you, O deity of holy rites, of infinite splendour&#8230;the trident-bearer, of excellent penis deserving worship, the staff-holder and of dry and arid semen.&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Shiva Purana, Vidyeshwara Samhita 1, chapter 9, verses 43-44 “The phallic symbol and the symbolised Śiva are non-different. Hence this phallic emblem is identical with me. It brings devotees quite near to me. It is worthy of worship therefore. O dear sons, if phallic emblem of this sort in installed I can be considered installed, though my idol is not installed.” Tr. J.L. Shastri</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Another translation for the above verse,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Shiva Purana, Vidyeshwara Samhita 1,9.43-44 “Shiva said, &#8216;I am not distinct from the Phallus. The Phallus is identical with me. It draws my faithful to me, and therefore must be worshipped. My well beloved! Wherever there is an upright male organ, I myself am present, even if there is no other representation of me.” Tr. Shiva Sharan (Alain Daniélou)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Srimad Devi Bhagawatam 9.41.48 “Laksmi always remains there with the greatest gladness where conch-shells are blown, where there are conchsells, the S&#8217;alagrama stone, the Tulasi leaves and the service and meditation of Laksmi are daily done. Where the phallic emblem of Siva is worshipped… &#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Varaha Purana 72.10 &#8220;People who seek pleasures sacrifice to me in my form as linga (phallus)&#8230;.&#8221; Tr. Venkitasubramonia Iyer, edited by J.L. Shastri</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Yoni (Vagina) worship can also be found in the Upanishad, it is mentioned,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 6.4.2-3 “Prajapati said to Himself: “Well, let Me make a firm basis for it (semen).” So He created woman. Having created her, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">He worshipped her bottom portion. Therefore one should worship the bottom portion of a woman</span>. He (Prajapati) extended His organ that projects and with it impregnated her.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>By:</strong> <em>Muhammad Qasim al-Hanafi</em></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a retaliatory action from me, a Muslim, against blasphemous writings, speeches &amp; slogans continuously, by Hindus on social media, and in their &#8216;Dharm-sabha&#8217; congregations, and in their religious rallies, denigrating the only Creator of the universe &#8216;Allah&#8217;, and the best of creation &#8216;Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ)&#8217;. These lines will be a stinging rejoinder to these slanderers &amp; critics. Our silence isn&#8217;t our weakness, but patience &amp; wisdom. Obviously, we Muslims always have a smart-aleck rejoinder to every single accusation by accusers against us, specifically when it comes to our Almighty Allah, or His beloved prophet Muhammad (ﷺ), the best of creation.</p>
<p>In this work, I am going to highlight some sexual contents mentioned in Valmiki Ramayana. Hindus always prefer to have a talk about sexuality in other religious scriptures. Most certainly, it&#8217;s integral part of their character. These fanatics always mock Islam by quoting fabricated narrations or inauthentic references, and the only solution to this mental illness of Hindus seems to be showing them mirror, and telling them &#8216;Pornographic scandals&#8217; of their gods &amp; sages from their own books. And remember! I have no intention to do mockery of Hindus&#8217; religious personalities or hurt their sentiments, which are more fragile than the spider web, and can be hurt by a simple question about Manu Smriti in KBC by Amitabh Bachchan.</p>
<p>The detailed vulgarity in Hindu literatures has been mentioned in these two jaw-breaking articles: &#8216;<a href="/index.php/2014/12/27/hinduism-lust/" data-wpel-link="internal">Hinduism and Lust</a>&#8216;, and &#8216;<a href="/index.php/2018/05/15/there-is-indeed-obscenity-in-vedas/" data-wpel-link="internal">Obscenity in Vedas</a>&#8216;.</p>
<p>Here, I will quote only from one book &#8216;Valmiki Ramayana&#8217;, which is accepted as magnum opus for Rama&#8217;s life by Hindus. Here you go:</p>

<p><strong>1. Sundar Kanda, Chapter: 38, Verses: 11-27</strong></p>
<p>When Hanuman meets Sita, he asks Sita to give him a token of remembrance, which Rama can recognize. Sita then narrates the episode of her &#8216;physical torture&#8217; by Jayant (the son of Indra) disguised as a crow which occurred on the Chitrakuta mountain, and requests Hanuman to repeat it before Rama by way of a token of recollection. A fatigued Rama was sleeping in the lap of Sita, when the crow attacked her. The story goes on:</p>

<p>&#8220;Having heard Hanuman, Sita, a child of god, said these words in a low tone. Choked with tears, &#8216;Carry this token of identity to my dear husband&#8217;:</p>
<p>&#8220;Long ago we were staying at Siddhashrama. This hermitage was situated to the northeast at the foot of Chitrakuta Mountain which was not far from the river Mandakini. It had abundant roots, fruits and water. You sported with me in the gardens which were fragrant with many types of flowers and ponds. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">You sat down on my lap with wet clothes in the hermitage</span>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then a crow greedy of flesh began <u>to peck my bosom with its beak</u>. I took a clod of earth and warded him off.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The crow was an eater of offerings, hungry for food began to peck me again and again for flesh. He did not stop.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My upper <u>cloth was slipping</u>. I was trying to pull up <u>my waist string</u> angrily when you saw me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you made fun of me, and I became angry. I was abashed. Torn by the voracious bird I sought your shelter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Exhausted, I sat on your lap again. Seeing my angry face you pacified me. You were happy (to see me draw close).&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O lord when I was angered by the crow and my face was filled with tears you marked me wiping my eyes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Totally exhausted I slept on your lap for a long time, and in turn you slept on my lap later.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The crow came back again and clawed me in the space <u>between my breasts</u> even after I woke up after slumber from Rama&#8217;s lap. Flying, it tore my bosom again and again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, Rama got wet by the discharged drops of blood. Thereafter, that splendorous Rama, the annihilator of enemies, who was in a pleasant slumber, was woken up by that crow and by me who was grievously tormented by the crow.&#8221;¹</p>
<p>&#8220;O strong-armed Rama, seeing my <u>torn breasts</u>, you became angry like a hissing serpent and hissing said:</p>
<p>&#8216;O Sita, with a beautiful lap like an elephant trunk, by whom is <u>your bosom wounded</u>? Who is sporting with an angry five-hooded snake?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then looking around, you saw the crow facing me with sharp, bloodstained claws.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This crow was the best of birds. He was surely <u>Indra&#8217;s son</u> who had covered a long distance with great speed and his speed was like the Windgod&#8217;s.&#8221; [Tr. IIT Kanpur]

<p>Now imagine!</p>
<p>A goddess of Hindus Sita is passing her time in romance with her Husband-god Rama, but Jayant, disguised as a crow, comes to tear Sita&#8217;s breasts, is also son of Hindu god Indra. I can&#8217;t understand which type of divinity this is, and which type of religious book the Ramayana is!</p>
<p>While the name of this &#8216;Kākāsura (काकासुर)&#8217; is not explicitly mentioned as Jayant in the episode, various commentaries on the epic like the Tilaka and the Bhushana by Govindaraja identify Jayant as the &#8216;son of Indra&#8217;. Govindaraja says only Jayant is known as the son of Indra.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="665" height="602" class="wp-image-8645" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/whatsapp-image-2021-05-15-at-10-30-54-pm-jpeg.jpeg" alt="WhatsApp Image 2021-05-15 at 10.30.54 PM.jpeg" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/whatsapp-image-2021-05-15-at-10-30-54-pm-jpeg.jpeg 665w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/05/whatsapp-image-2021-05-15-at-10-30-54-pm-jpeg-300x272.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 665px) 100vw, 665px" /></p>
<p>But, Tulsi Das fabricated the story in his &#8216;Ramcharitmanas&#8217;, and replaces the breast with feet. He writes in Aranya Kanda:</p>
<p>&#8220;सीता <u>चरण</u> चोंच हतिभागा। मूढ़ मंद मति कारन कागा।।&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The stupid fool, who had disguised himself as a crow with a sinister motive, bit Sita <u>in the foot</u> with his beak and flew away.&#8221; [Tr. Geeta Press]
<p>But no worries, because such types of textual adulteration are very common in Hindus.</p>
<p><strong>But don’t forget:</strong> <em>“Valmiki Ramayana is a religious book of Hindus.”</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2. Ayodhya Kanda, Chapter: 91, Verses: 10-91</strong></p>
<p>Having been instructed by Bhardwaja to bring the army to his place, Bharat (brother of Rama) allowed his army also to come to the hermitage. Then, Bhardwaja invokes Vishvakarma, the divine architect and requests him to arrange for a befitting hospitality to Bharat. The reader can refer to this full chapter, but I am quoting certain verses:</p>
<p>तेनैव च मूहूर्तेन <u>दिव्याऽभरणभूषिताः</u>।<br />
<u>आगुर्विंशतिसाहस्राः ब्रह्मणा प्रहिताः स्त्रियः</u>।।2.91.43।।</p>
<p><u>सुवर्णमणिमुक्तेन प्रवालेन च शोभिताः</u>।<br />

<p>याभिर्गृहीतः पुरुषस्सोन्माद इव लक्ष्यते।<br />
<u>आगुर्विंशतिसाहस्रा नन्दनादप्सरोगणाः</u>।।2.91.45।।</p>
<p><u>अलम्बुसा</u> <u>मिश्रकेशी</u> <u>पुण्डरीका</u>ऽथ <u>वामना</u>।<br />
<u>उपानृत्यंस्तु भरतं</u> भरद्वाजस्य शासनात्।।2.91.47।।</p>
<p><u>सुरास्सुरापाः</u> पिबत पायसं च बुभुक्षिताः।।2.91.52।।</p>
<p><u>मांसानि</u> च सुमेध्यानि भक्ष्यन्तां यावदिच्छथ।।2.91.53।।</p>
<p><u>उच्छाद्य</u> <u>स्नापयन्ति</u> स्म नदीतीरेष वल्गुषु।<br />
<u>अप्येकमेकं पुरषं प्रमदास्सप्त चाष्ट च</u>।।2.91.54।।</p>
<p><u>संवाहन्त्य</u>स्समापेतु<u>र्नार्यो रुचिरलोचनाः</u>।<br />
<u>परिमृज्य</u> तथाऽन्योन्यं पाययन्ति वराङ्गनाः।।2.91.55।।</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;At that very moment <u>twenty thousand women adorned with beautiful ornaments</u> sent <u>by Brahma</u> presented themselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<u>Twenty thousand women adorned with gold, gems and corals</u> sent by Kubera came.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<u>Troops of twenty thousand apsaras by whom any man when taken hold of in their arms could be intoxicated with intense passion,</u> came from Nandana gardens.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thereafter, <u>the apsaras, Alambusa, Misrakesi, Pundarika and Vamana danced near Bharata</u> at the command of Bharadwaja.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;O <u>wine drinkers</u>, drink as much as you can those who are hungry partake payasam and <u>sacred meat&#8217;</u>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Every single warrior was attended by <u>seven or eight women who applied oil and massaged his body and bathed him </u>on the lovely banks of the river.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<u>Some women with beautiful eyes quickly approached them for massaging. The best of ladies wiped their bodies dry and gave each other wine to drink</u>.&#8221; [Tr. IIT Kanpur]

<p>One can see in above-mentioned verses, the roots of &#8216;Dancing/Nautch Girls&#8217; custom. Hindu personalities gained a particular reputation for their licentiousness as a result of the activities of the &#8216;nautch girls&#8217;. As part of the entertainment for the royal family, these highly skilled dancers performed for the ruler and entertained his guests. They also formed part of everyday life for those outside the palaces, as people invited them to perform at celebrations, festivals, and fairs. These women were valued for their intelligence as well as their dancing skills. As a form of side employment they offered sexual services, and they would cover themselves in gold as an outward sign of their wealth. Every Hindu temple of any importance possessed a troupe of nautch girls: some acted as priestesses, married in childhood to the idols and obliged by their vocation to prostitute themselves to men of every caste; others acted as mistresses to the temple priests. Such prostitution was not looked down on, and even distinguished families were proud to have daughters dedicated to the temple&#8217;s service. At one time it was estimated that twelve thousand such temple prostitutes existed in Madras alone. For the Hindu deities, the nautch girls were the embodiment of sexuality, highly erotic seductresses who had the ability to charm all males. Indeed, seventeenth-century travelers frequently portrayed India as a hotbed of vice and full of prostitutes. The only reason for this is that the roots of this fornication go back to the Hindu scriptures.</p>
<p>The verses 52-53 are teaching about &#8216;Date Rape&#8217;, because those dancing girls took &#8216;liquor (सुराः)&#8217; for Bharat &amp; his army. It means the &#8216;Date Rape Drugs&#8217; originated from this ancient culture of Hinduism.</p>
<p>A &#8216;date rape drug&#8217; is any drug that incapacitates another person and renders that person vulnerable to a sexual assault, including rape. Alcohol, consumed voluntarily, is the most commonly used drug involved in sexual assaults. Researchers agree that the drug most commonly involved in drug-facilitated sexual assaults is alcohol, which the victim has consumed voluntarily in most cases. In most jurisdictions, alcohol is legal and readily available and is used in the majority of sexual assaults. Many perpetrators use alcohol because their victims often drink it willingly, and can be encouraged to drink enough to lose inhibitions or consciousness. Sex with an unconscious victim is considered rape in most jurisdictions and some assailants have committed &#8216;rapes of convenience&#8217;, assaulting a victim after he or she had become unconscious from drinking too much.</p>

<p>And the verses 54-55 are encouraging &#8216;erotic massage&#8217;, and beach fornication. The person providing the massage is called a masseur (male) or masseuse (female).</p>
<p>&#8220;Erotic massage is a means through which two people in an intimate relationship touch and stimulate each other, communicate love and tenderness too. Touch and massage, therefore, are the perfect tools for sexual foreplay.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now the reader can understand the roots of adultery, being committed in massage parlors and at beaches.</p>

<p><strong>3. Balkanda, Chapter: 48, Verses: 17-31</strong></p>
<p>On enquiry by Rama, sage Vishwamitra relates the story of Gautama&#8217;s curse to his wife Ahalya:</p>

<p>&#8220;The thousand-eyed Indra, consort of Sachi, having found an opportunity (during the absence of the ascetic), assumed the guise of the ascetic (Gautama) and said to Ahalya:</p>
<p>‘O most beautiful one those overtaken by passion would not await the completion of <u>the menstrual period (favourable for copulation). O woman of fine waist I desire union with you’</u>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O Delight of the Raghus the evil-intentioned Ahalya, inclined towards the king of the celestials and knowing him to be the thousand-eyed Indra in the guise of the ascetic, consented for the union.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O Foremost of men with her <u>heart&#8217;s desire fulfilled</u>, Ahalya said: &#8220;O Chief of the celestials <u>I&#8217;m satisfied</u>. O Lord, quit this place: O Lord of the gods, protect yourself and also me from Gautama in all respects.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Indra smilingly said to Ahalya, &#8216;O One with <u>lovely hips</u>, <u>I am gratified</u>. I shall go away the way I have come&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O Rama he (Indra) came out of the leaf hut quickly after <u>his union with her,</u> apprehensive of Gautama.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Subsequently, Indra beheld the great ascetic Gautama, unassailable by devatas and danavas, endowed with the power of asceticism, drenched with sacrificial waters, shining like flaming fire, carrying sacrificial firewood and Kusha grass and preeminent among sages, entering that leaf hut.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;On seeing him, the face of the Lord of the gods (Indra) turned pale with fear. Having seen the wicked Indra with a thousandeyed in the guise of an ascetic, the gentle sage Gautama got enraged and said:</p>
<p>&#8216;O Wicked natured one assuming my form you have done a forbidden act. For that reason <u>you shall be devoid of scrotum</u>.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cursed thus out of anger by eminent Gautama, <u>the testicles of Indra immediately dropped down</u> on the earth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Having thus cursed Indra, he also cursed Ahalya: &#8216;You will be staying here for thousands of years without food and subsisting on air, lying down in ashes, doing penance, without being seen by any living beings in this ashrama&#8217;.&#8221; [Tr. IIT Kanpur]

<p>These verses have the roots of &#8216;extramarital sex&#8217;, because the lady Ahalya, the wife of Hindu Sage Gautama deceived her husband, and Hindu God Indra went into her. &#8216;Extramarital sex&#8217; occurs when a married person engages in sexual activity with someone other than his or her spouse. This sin destroyed tranquility and peace of uncountable families. See the results of such stories, the survey says:</p>
<p>&#8220;48% of women who had extramarital affairs are moms.&#8221;</p>

<p>That&#8217;s what the feminists could abstract from the lady Ahalya&#8217;s erotic story of Valmiki Ramayana, and they call it &#8216;Freedom of life&#8217;.</p>

<p>Dear Readers!</p>
<p>Have a look at these obscene verses, and see how this Hindu&#8217;s religious book &#8216;Valmiki Ramayana&#8217; is slaying the significance of religiosity, morality, sanctity, piety and devoutness. Imagine when a Hindu becomes addicted to recitation of such vulgar epics, what kind of beatitude &amp; sainthood he/she adorns of!</p>
<p>I feel genuine shame when see any Hindu talking about pietism &amp; divinity.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it&#8217;s not about any common woman. It&#8217;s about their Goddess Sita Mata&#8217;s figure. Ravan described inflection points of Sita&#8217;s body to the extent of explaining her waist-to-hip ratio (WHR).</p>
<p>Even he says: <em>&#8220;Your smooth thighs are like the trunk of an elephant&#8221;,</em> this vulgar verse is indeed innovating the fornication of &#8216;thigh show&#8217;.</p>
<p>And when he says: <em>&#8220;Your breasts adorned with gems, are round and robust like palm fruits and drooping with heaviness with projected stiff nipples, shining and delightful&#8221;,</em> and he says: <em>&#8220;Your slender waist can be compassed by my fist&#8221;,</em> it means he is describing ‘hourglass figure’ of Sita.</p>
<p>Now, Hindus should tell me which type of sacredness is this? What does this vulgar book want to explain about your mother goddess Sita? Would you like to explain such private things about your own mother what your religious book does about your Sita Mata!?</p>
<p><strong>But don’t forget:</strong> <em>“Valmiki Ramayana is a religious book of Hindus.”</em></p>

<p>Can any Hindu explain me why your mother Sita&#8217;s plump breasts, wide hips and other erogenous zones are highlighted everywhere? Which sort of devotion is taught here in this religious book?</p>
<p>It is not only the evil Ravana, but even Sita herself has a polluted mouth as well. When the fictitious news of Rama&#8217;s death (a trick by Ravana) reaches Sita who is held hostage in Lanka, she laments that her body is no longer of any use because her husband has been slain; however, Sita also mutters about all the voluptuous features of her body.</p>
<p><strong>But don’t forget:</strong> <em>“Valmiki Ramayana is a religious book of Hindus.”</em></p>

<p><strong>9. Kishkindha Kand, Chapter: 66, Verses: 10-20</strong></p>
<p>Description of Hanuman&#8217;s birth goes on, and starts with how Windgod (वायु देवता) impregnated Hanuman’s mother Anjana, the wife of Kesri. Jambavan (divine-king of bears) tells Hanuman:</p>

<p>&#8220;She was the daughter of a great king of monkeys called Kunjara. That young and beautiful lady had assumed a lustrous human form decked with wonderful garlands, ornaments and silk clothes and was roving on top of the mountain which appeared like a proud raincloud.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<u>While the large-eyed lady was stationed on the mountain top, the Windgod gently let her auspicious yellow garment with red border fly away.&#8221;</u></p>
<p><u>&#8220;Then he (Windgod) saw her curved, well-set thighs, her beautiful plump breasts and her lovely pleasing face.&#8221;</u></p>
<p><u>&#8220;On seeing the broad hips, slender waist and beautiful limbs</u> of that famous lady the Windgod was infatuated.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Windgod lost his control over himself. His whole being was overpowered by love for her beautiful, flawless body. He <u>embraced her with his long arms</u>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She was bewildered by this and being chaste and strict observer of chastity she said, &#8216;Who is it that has destroyed my monoandry?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;On hearing Anjana&#8217;s words, the Windgod replied, &#8216; O auspicious lady, I do you no harm, <u>O lady of beautiful hips.</u> I reached (enjoyed) you in mind, not body. You need not fear.'&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O renowned lady I have embraced you and united with you mentally (enjoyed you without physical contact).You will bring forth a son endowed with great wisdom and courage.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He will be very powerful, illustrious and will be of great valour and strength. He will be my equal in leaping and flying&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O great monkey O strongshouldered one having been assured that way, <u>your mother was pleased and delivered you, a bull among monkeys, in a cave.</u>&#8221; [Tr. IIT Kanpur]

<p>Dear Readers!</p>
<p>Are you having a look at these sexually explicit, profane and dirty stories of Valmiki Ramayana!?</p>
<p>Verse no. 11 and 12 talk about &#8216;Clothing Fetishism&#8217;, and the last part of the verse 12 is talking about &#8216;clothes off sex&#8217; when it says: <em>&#8220;The Windgod gently let her auspicious yellow garment with red border fly away.&#8221; </em></p>
<p>Now &#8216;eye sex&#8217; by Windgod started in verse no. 13 and continues with &#8216;leg show&#8217;, &#8216;thigh show&#8217;, &#8216;breast show&#8217;, and staring at &#8216;broad hips&#8217; &amp; &#8216;slender waist&#8217; in verse 14. This ends in verse 15 to 20 with &#8216;holding hand&#8217;, &#8216;hugging&#8217;, &#8216;impregnation&#8217; and birth of Hanuman in a cave. It isn&#8217;t any secret that the Vedas and Puranas are full of sexual tales, essentially these are hardcore pornographic literature. But I never expected such things from Valmiki Ramayana.</p>
<p>I am questioning again: <em>&#8220;Why are the full swelling breasts of your mother Sita and Anjana highlighted in this religious text, and their other erogenous body parts as well? Would you like to mention the same about your own mother?&#8221;</em></p>
<p><strong>But don’t forget:</strong> <em>“Valmiki Ramayana is a religious book of Hindus.”</em></p>
<p>Now, Rama&#8217;s body parts explained —</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>10. Sundar Kanda, Chapter: 35, Verse: 17</strong></p>
<p>While requested by Sita, Hanuman explains bodily symbols of Rama:</p>
<p>त्रिस्थिरस्त्रिप्रलम्बश्च <u>त्रिसम</u>स्त्रिषु चोन्नतः।<br />
त्रिताम्रस्त्रिषु च स्निग्धो <u>गम्भीरस्त्रिषु नित्यशः</u>।।5.35.17।।</p>
<p><strong>Word by word translation by IIT Kanpur:</strong></p>
<p>त्रिस्थिरः has the three stiff limbs (chest, fist and wrists), त्रिप्रलम्बश्च long in three (arms, eyebrows and scrotum), <u>त्रिसमः </u><u>has three even parts (locks of hair, knees and testicles),</u> त्रिषु elevated in three parts (abdomen, navel and chest), उन्नतः raised, त्रिषु च all the three parts (soles, nails and eyes), स्निग्धः has coppery reddish colour, नित्यशः all over, त्रिषु in the three parts (the underlines of feet, the hair and <u>the reproductive organs</u>), गम्भीरः is majestic.</p>
[He has three stiff parts, three long parts, three even parts, three shining parts, elevated in three parts, has three raised parts, his body has lines in three parts and is of coppery reddish colour in three parts. He has a majestic look.]

<p>Now, happens the genocide of all sorts of morality, when the sex organs of gods are lifted up by their devotees. Even if a tongue recites these pornographic verses, it will scold itself: ‘Shut the hell up!’</p>
<p><strong>But don’t forget:</strong> <em>“Valmiki Ramayana is a religious book of Hindus.”</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>11. Ayodhya Kanda, Chapter: 19, Verse: 7</strong></p>
<p>Hindu god Rama tells Kaikeyi (mother of Bharat) that had she (or his father) simply asked him, he&#8217;d have gladly given away (his right to) the kingdom &amp; everything he possessed, <em>including Sita</em>, to half-brother Bharata:</p>
<p>अहं हि <u>सीतां</u> राज्यं च प्राणानिष्टान्धनानि च।<br />
हृष्टो भ्रात्रे स्वयं दद्यां भरतायाप्रचोदितः।।2.19.7।।</p>
<p>&#8220;Unurged, I would have gladly given to Bharata the kingdom, wealth, my most coveted life, <u>and even Sita</u>.&#8221; [Tr. IIT Kanpur]

<p>I would like to ask which type of ‘spousal abandonment’ is this? And why was the Hindu concept of &#8216;सात जन्मों का रिश्ता (relationship of seven births)&#8217; forgotten by Rama?</p>
<p><strong>But don’t forget:</strong> <em>“Valmiki Ramayana is a religious book of Hindus.”</em></p>
<p>Hindus claim: <em>“Their scriptures are factual story-teller.”</em></p>
<p>I say: Being fictional or factual does not matter, the authenticity given by scholars matters.</p>
<p>Hindu frauds like Narsinhanand Saraswati &amp; Pushpendra Kulshreshtha who have venomous mouth against other religious personalities and addicted of mental intoxication when talk about other religions, are bound to answer:</p>
<p>“If your religious books indeed say what I quoted above, what is the difference between your these sacred texts and top-shelf magazines?”</p>
<p>“If it is religious epic, what problems you Hindus face in accepting ‘adult magazines’ as your holy books?”</p>
<p>“After seeing such nudity, the Ramayana should lead the list of well-known erotic magazines like &#8216;Playboy&#8217;, &#8216;Penthouse&#8217;, &#8216;Playgirl&#8217; and &#8216;Hustler&#8217;. If yes, I agree. If not, why?”</p>
<p>Conclusively, instead of just throwing stones at everything we Muslims propose, why don&#8217;t you Hindus contribute some constructive suggestions for a change in yourself? Due to the intense hatred, all you Hindus do is throw stones. You are all over us about our divine faith Islam, but you start pouting when we point out that you have such and such things in your sacred texts! What, you can dish it out, but you can’t take it!? Hindu fanatics also must stop throwing bone to common Hindus by acknowledging the need for their help.</p>
<p>Qur&#8217;ān 85:8 tells about the peaceful reason behind their hatred:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;And what did they dislike from the Muslims, except that the Muslims accepted faith in Allah the Most Honourable, the Most Praiseworthy?&#8221;</em> [Tr. Kanzul Īmān]

<p><strong>Meat consumption and animal sacrifice in Valmiki Ramayana</strong></p>
<p>By: Muhammad Qasim al-Hanafi</p>
<p>The Valmiki Ramayana is one of the foremost &#8216;Pramānās (Evidences)&#8217; for a Hindu. The epic traditionally ascribed to the Maharishi Valmiki. This epic is divided into seven kāṇḍas: the ayodhyakāṇḍa, the araṇyakāṇḍa, the kiṣkindakāṇḍa, the sundarākāṇḍa, and the laṅkākāṇḍa (also called Yuddhakāṇḍa). These five Kandas are unanimously accepted by Hindus, but they differ about the Uttarākāṇḍa &amp; the Bālakāṇḍa. Though Bālakāṇḍa is sometimes considered in the main epic, according to many Uttarakanda is certainly a later interpolation and thus is not attributed to the work of Maharshi Valmiki. This is disputed issue among Hindu scholars.</p>
<p>But Geeta Press (Gorakhpur) seems to have accepted it wholly, without compromising on any part including Uttarakanda. So, I do build up my words relying on this version published by Geeta Press.</p>
<p>If we check on such authentic version of Valmiki Ramayana, there are several places which indicate that Rama, his wife Sita and his brother Lakshman would eat meat. Also it was common among them in their &amp; other people&#8217;s life in Ramayan Period.</p>
<p>Swami Vivekanand himself admitted the fact:</p>
<p><span id="more-8525"></span></p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Instances are found in the Râmâyana and the Mahâbhârata of the drinking of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">wine and the taking of meat by Rama and Krishna,</span> whom they worship as God. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sita Devi vows meat</span>, rice, and a thousand jars of wine to the river-goddess, Gangâ!&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Complete_Works_of_Swami_Vivekananda/Volume_5/Writings:_Prose_and_Poems/The_East_and_The_West/Food_and_Cooking" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Complete_Works_of_Swami_Vivekananda/Volume_5/Writings:_Prose_and_Poems/The_East_and_The_West/Food_and_Cooking<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>Due to controversy among Hindus regarding seven Kandas&#8217; authenticity, in beginning I will quote from authentic Kandas; and will quote from Uttarakanda &amp; Balkanda in the end in following these reliable Kandas.</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><strong>Ayodhya Kanda, Chapter: 50, Verses: 8-10</strong></p>
<p>&#8216;Kosala (कोसल)&#8217; was one of the &#8216;Solasa Mahajanapadas (sixteen powerful realms)&#8217; in ancient India. According to the Ramayana, Rama ruled the &#8216;Kosala kingdom (कोसल राज्य)&#8217; from his capital, Ayodhya. In the verses, Rama bids farewell to his birth-place Ayodhya, this region is glorified in Ramayana as follows:</p>

Since we purpose to live here long, we should enter it with peaceful intention! O son of Sumitra, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">having killed a black deer, bring it here</span>, speedily.

<p><strong>(6) Gross fraud by Geeta Press:</strong></p>
<p>Verse no. 22 mentions the word &#8216;ऐणेयं&#8217; means &#8216;antelope (especially black)&#8217; and &#8216;मासम्&#8217; means &#8216;meat&#8217;. But Geeta Press is mistranslating it as &#8216;गजकन्द का गूदा&#8217; to veil the truth about meat eating;</p>
<p>And verse no. 23 quotes &#8216;मृगं&#8217; means &#8216;antelope/deer&#8217;, and &#8216;हत्वा&#8217; means &#8216;Killing (having killed)&#8217;. But Geeta Press distorted it by &#8216;गजकन्द नामक कंद को उखाड़कर या खोदकर&#8217;;</p>
<p>Verse no. 25 mentions the same as verse no. 22 &#8216;ऐणेयं&#8217; means &#8216;antelope&#8217;, but here also mistranslation exists &#8216;गजकन्द को&#8217;;</p>
<p>Verse no. 26 says &#8216;कृष्णमृगं&#8217; which also means &#8216;black antelope&#8217;, but Geeta Press is doing fabrication as usual &#8216;काले छिलके वाले गजकन्द को&#8217;. The verse also mentions two words: &#8216;हत्वा&#8217; means &#8216;Killing (having killed)&#8217; as in verse no. 23, and &#8216;मेध्यं&#8217; means &#8216;Pure meat&#8217; as in Chapter: 52, Verse: 102. But Geeta Press concocted as did in previous verses;</p>
<p>Verse no. 27 mentions &#8216;पक्वं&#8217; means &#8216;cooking (having cooked)&#8217;. But Geeta Press seems to show it &#8216;पका हुआ&#8217; in the mean of &#8216;ripe&#8217; to make it fit for &#8216;गजकन्द&#8217; fruit; and turning &#8216;पका हुआ&#8217; from the mean of &#8216;cooked&#8217; which is fit for &#8216;meat&#8217;, so that the reader can&#8217;t understand the hidden truth. The verse also says &#8216;निष्टप्तं&#8217; which translates &#8216;roasted well&#8217;, and &#8216;छिन्नशोणितम्&#8217; which means &#8216;drained of the blood&#8217;. But Geeta Press is making it the medicine for &#8216;Blood Disorder&#8217; by translating &#8216;रक्तविकार का नाश करने वाले&#8217;;</p>
<p>Verse no. 28 says &#8216;समस्तांगः&#8217; means &#8216;all the limbs&#8217;, but Geeta Press mistranslates &#8216;जो बिगड़े हुए सभी अंगों को ठीक करने वाला है&#8217;. It seems according to Geeta Press Rama, Seeta &amp; Lakshman were suffering from &#8216;Blood Disorder&#8217; so they searched for this medicine and had it to be healed from this disorder. And the word &#8216;कृष्णमृगो&#8217; is mentioned again means &#8216;black antelope&#8217; as in verse no. 26, but mistranslated by Geeta Press. And the word &#8216;यजस्व&#8217; means &#8216;offer with sacrifice&#8217;, but Geeta Press conceals this sacrifice by &#8216;वास्तुदेवताओं का यजन&#8217;.</p>

<p>&#8220;The men beheld countless <span style="text-decoration: underline;">dishes of mutton, pork, venison and other meats cooked</span> in fruit-juices and fried in butter with cloves, caraway seeds and lentils simmering gently in them.

<p>&#8220;The word &#8216;girinimnaga&#8217; refers to Mandakini River that Rama is showing Seeta. The word &#8216;chandayan&#8217; indicates that Rama was trying to attract Seeta. The mode for such attraction is shown in the second sloka starting with &#8216;idam medhyam&#8217;. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The word &#8216;idam&#8217; refers to meat. &#8216;</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">medhyam</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">&#8216; means purified. &#8216;Svadu&#8217; means delicious. &#8216;Nishtaptam&#8217; means &#8216;cooked well&#8217;.

<p>&#8220;Having noticed &#8216;BrahmaKshatrena&#8217; in verse 37, it has to be confessed that during Ramayan Period the practice of meat eating was equally present among Brahmans &amp; Kshatriyas.”</p>

<p>Abovementioned comment by Hindu scholar reveals the secret about meat eating by Brahmins &amp; Kshatriyas in Ramayana period, and don’t forget Rama was Kshatriya. Further, Geeta Press (Gorakhpur) admitted one more hidden truth by translating &#8216;ब्रह्मक्षत्रेण&#8217; as ‘त्रैवर्णिक’. Now first we will see what the word ‘त्रैवर्णिक’ means:</p>

<p>Now have a look!</p>
<p>Hindu Scholar Dwaraka Prasad Sharma mentioned only Brahmins &amp; Kshatriyas, but Geeta Press (Gorakhpur) is telling us that also among Vaishyas, meat eating was common as well as in Brahmins &amp; Kshatriyas. Because, Geeta Press Translation is informing about the first three castes. And every child, who is aware of Hindu ‘CASTE SYSTEM’, will tell you: “These first three castes are Brahmin, Kshatriya &amp; Vaishya.”</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> These abovementioned 16 verses are quoted from the kandas which are unanimously authentic according to Hindus. Now let me quote from two disputed kandas:</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><strong>17. Uttar Kanda, Chapter: 42, Verse: 19</strong></p>

<p><strong>(1) Translation by Hari Prasad Shastri:</strong></p>

<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>Be careful!</p>
<p>The Sanskrit text mentions ‘मांसानि’ very clearly which means meat. But the translator is trying to conceal the truth by translating this apparent word by an ambiguous word ‘viands’. But, let me make this ambiguous word unambiguous:</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> The word &#8216;Viand&#8217; is French, means meat, flesh, meat food, flesh food —</p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://m.interglot.com/fr/en/viande" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">https://m.interglot.com/fr/en/viande<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><strong> 2.</strong> See what&#8217;s Merriam Webster says:</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Viand&#8217; entered English in the 15th century from Anglo-French (viand means ‘meat’ even in modern French)&#8230;!&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/viand" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/viand<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>But now a days, this word is commonly used in English for several items of food or its stock also, which is generic for veg. and non-veg. So, the translator is indirectly accepting the truth about ‘मांसानि’.</p>
<p><strong>(2) Hindi Translation by Dwaraka Prasad Sharma:</strong></p>

<p>It&#8217;s a distortion also, but truth revealing. The verse says &#8216;मांसानि (meat)&#8217; but Geeta Press replaced it with &#8216;राजोचित भोग्य पदार्थ (food befitting to King)&#8217;. Geeta Press is indirectly informing us that the meat is the food befitting to the kings. And we must remember Rama was a Kshatriya king.</p>

<p>There must remain no confusion in the readers’ mind after understanding all these irrefutable testimonies that the Ramayana Period legalizes meat eating; and also sacrificing the animals is noted as an investment for greater welfare. Now, let me turn the table to the obliteration of modern Hindu Polemics who are wasting their time in actions against documented facts.</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><strong>Refuting Hindu Polemics concerning the word &#8216;मांसम् (mānsam)&#8217;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hindu Argument (seen several times on Hindu sites and blogs):</strong></p>
<p>The word &#8216;मांसम् (mānsam)&#8217; doesn&#8217;t mean &#8216;flesh&#8217; or &#8216;meat&#8217; in these verses, because this word also means &#8216;गूदा (pulp of fruit)&#8217;. That&#8217;s why scholars explain it as &#8216;flesh of the fruit&#8217;. The same meaning is mentioned by Apte&#8217;s Sanskrit-Hindi lexicon.</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><strong>My Response:</strong></p>
<p>Firstly, we must understand that a single word can have several meanings. Exponents in the language can apply any meaning anywhere. However, only cognizant linguists are capable of understanding the context and applying the suitable meaning everywhere. Let me give a very simple and straight forward logic to dismiss the argument:</p>
<p>They say &#8216;मांसम् (mānsam)&#8217; means &#8216;pulp of a fruit&#8217;. But wait, the original text says this very explicitly: &#8216;ऐणेयं मांसम् आहृत्य&#8217;, meaning: &#8216;bringing the meat of an antelope&#8217;. In response, Lakshmana kills a &#8216;कृष्णमृगं (black antelope)&#8217;. So, now the Hindu polemics must explain which fruit is called &#8216;कृष्णमृगं (krishnamrigam)&#8217; and &#8216;ऐणेयं (ayneyam)&#8217; for the &#8216;मांसम् (mānsam)&#8217; to mean &#8216;its pulp&#8217;?</p>
<p>Please note that both occurrences are in the same context. One may see 56th chapter of Ayodhya kanda for the complete text and context.</p>
<p>Secondly, the opponent referred to Apte’s lexicon to show what is compatible with his claim and to neglect what is incompatible to his claim. In actual, Apte’s Sanskrit-Hindi lexicon mentioned three means of &#8216;मांसम् (mānsam)&#8217;:</p>
<p>1. मांस, गोश्त (meat, flesh); 2. मछली का मांस (flesh of fish); 3. फल का गूदा (pulp of fruit).</p>
[Pg. No. 847, Published by Shree Prakashan (New Delhi), New edition]
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="481" height="252" class="wp-image-8588 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/WhatsApp-Image-2020-11-21-at-2.02-481w252h.jpeg" alt="WhatsApp Image 2020-11-21 at 2.02.00 PM.jpeg" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/WhatsApp-Image-2020-11-21-at-2.02-481w252h.jpeg 481w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/11/WhatsApp-Image-2020-11-21-at-2.02-481w252h-300x157.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 481px) 100vw, 481px" /></p>
<p>I agree with the opponent that &#8216;मांसम् (mānsam)&#8217; also means pulp, but rarely, not often. And it also with no doubt means flesh. And which mean, more accurate at the place, is always decided by the context. And the word &#8216;मांसम् (mānsam)&#8217; in the verses which I quoted can never mean &#8216;pulp&#8217;, as per context. But some modern frauds want to take &#8216;मांसम् (mānsam)&#8217; everywhere in the mean of pulp to conceal the truth.</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>Thirdly, On the contrary, the words &#8216;मांसम् (mānsam)&#8217;, &#8216;मांसानि (mānsāni)&#8217; and &#8216;मांस (māns)&#8217; are mentioned in the mean of &#8216;meat&#8217; or &#8216;flesh&#8217; at several places in Valmiki Ramayan. Some are:</p>
<p>Kishkindha Kanda, 17:38; 17:40; 18:39;</p>
<p>Yuddha Kanda, 60:23; 60:33; 60:63; 67:37;</p>
<p>Sundar Kanda, 36:41; 38:15-16;</p>
<p>Now the opponent should tell me the suitable mean of &#8216;मांसम् (mānsam)&#8217;, &#8216;मांसानि (mānsāni)&#8217; and &#8216;मांस (māns)&#8217; in these ten verses? If it means ‘pulp’ then the opponent should meet a psychiatrist nearby; if not, then why? If ‘why’ is solved by the context, the same answer is from me regarding the verses abovementioned.</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><strong>Hindu Argument (as seen in Geeta Press version &amp; other Hindu sources):</strong></p>
<p>In these verses &#8216;मांसम्&#8217; means &#8216;फल-मूल (Fruits &amp; roots etc)&#8217;, not &#8216;meat&#8217;.</p>

<p><strong>My response: </strong></p>
<p>The translator or exponent must learn the rules of &#8216;Literal&#8217; and &#8216;Non-literal&#8217; language first. &#8216;Non-literal&#8217; is also called &#8216;Figurative&#8217; or &#8216;Metaphorical&#8217; sometimes. We need not take metaphorical meaning, when literal meaning is possible. Metaphorical mean can&#8217;t be accepted until the possibility of taking literal meaning ends. If we do so, it will be called &#8216;fabrication&#8217; or turning the words from their real senses. In sanskrit &#8216;फल-मूल&#8217; is literally used as &#8216;मूलफलं&#8217; or &#8216;फलमूलं&#8217;, and this word is mentioned in Valmiki Ramayan several times as:</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>In Ayodhya Kanda, 54:16</p>
<p>पित्रा नियुक्ता भगवन् प्रवेक्ष्यामस्तपोवनम्।</p>
<p>धर्ममेव चरिष्याम स्तत्र <span style="text-decoration: underline;">मूलफला</span>शनाः।।</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>Further in Ayodhya Kanda, 56:13-14</p>
<p>तन्तु पर्वतमासाद्य नानापक्षिगणायुतम्।</p>
<p>बहु<span style="text-decoration: underline;">मूलफलं</span> रम्यं सम्पन्नं सरसोदकम्।।</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>मनोज्ञोऽयं गिरिस्सौम्य नानाद्रुमलतायुतः।</p>
<p>बहु<span style="text-decoration: underline;">मूलफलो</span> रम्य स्स्वाजीवः प्रतिभाति मे।।</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>Also in Kishkindha Kanda, 17:25 (in some versions 24)</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">फलमूला</span>शनं नित्यं वानरं वनगोचरम्।</p>
<p>मामिहाप्रतियुध्यन्तमन्येन च समागतम्।।</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>Again in the same chapter of Kishkindha Kanda, verse: 30 (on no. 29 in some versions)</p>
<p>वयं वनचरा राम मृगा <span style="text-decoration: underline;">मूलफला</span>शना:।</p>
<p>एषा प्रकृतिरस्माकं पुरुषस्त्वं नरेश्वरः।।</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>Also in Ayodhya Kanda 34:59, literal words are mentioned for &#8216;फल-मूल&#8217;, see:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">फलानि</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">मूलानि</span> च भक्षयन्वने</p>
<p>गिरींश्च पश्यन् सरितस्सरांसि च।</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>One more in Ayodhya Kanda 20:29</p>
<p>चतुर्दश हि वर्षाणि वत्स्यामि विजने वने।</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">कन्दमूलफलै</span>र्जीवन्हित्वा मुनिवदामिषम्।।</p>
[In some versions, it&#8217;s &#8216;मधुमूलफलैर्जीवन्हित्वा&#8217; instead of &#8216;कन्दमूलफलैर्जीवन्हित्वा&#8217;.]
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>Furthermore in Ayodhya Kanda 27:16 (on no. 15 in some versions)</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">फलमूला</span>शना नित्यं भविष्यामि न संशयः।</p>
<p>न ते दुःखं करिष्यामि निवसन्ती सह त्वया।।</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>Now, when Sanskrit has several unequivocal words &#8216;फलमूलं&#8217;, &#8216;मूलफलं&#8217;, &#8216;कन्दमूलफल&#8217; or &#8216;फलानि मूलानि&#8217; for &#8216;फल-मूल (fruits &amp; roots etc)&#8217;, what caused the writer to take metaphorical word &#8216;मांसम् (meat)&#8217; for &#8216;फल-मूल (fruits)&#8217;, which is literal for &#8216;meat&#8217;?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s nothing except the literal fraud by modern Hindu translators and exponents. Geeta Press&#8217;s choice of word prima facie appears to &#8216;be ill-motivated and purposefully made&#8217;.</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><strong>Hindu Argument (as posed by several Hindus including Arya Samajis):</strong></p>
<p>How could Rama have meat in forest while he pledged:</p>
<p>चतुर्दश हि वर्षाणि वत्स्यामि विजने वने।</p>
<p>मधुमूलफलैर्जीवन्हित्वा मुनिवदामिषम्।।2.20.29।।</p>
<p>&#8220;Abstaining from eating meat like hermits and living on honey, fruits and roots, I am to live in the solitary forest for fourteen years.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>फलानि मूलानि च भक्षयन्वने</p>
<p>गिरींश्च पश्यन् सरितस्सरांसि च।</p>
<p>वनं प्रविश्यैव विचित्रपादपम्</p>
<p>सुखी भविष्यामि तवास्तु निर्वृतिः।।2.34.59।।</p>
<p>&#8220;Entering the forest full of various kinds of trees I shall be happy to view the mountains, rivers and the lakes and to eat fruits and roots. (Hence) do not grieve.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>पित्रा नियुक्ता भगवन् प्रवेक्ष्यामस्तपोवनम्।</p>
<p>धर्ममेव चरिष्याम स्तत्र मूलफलाशनाः।।2.54.16।।</p>
<p>&#8220;O venerable one on my father&#8217;s command we entered the desolate forest of penance. Subsisting on roots and fruits, I shall practice the righteous way of life.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>Here, the condition of exile and Rama&#8217;s pledge not to have meat. And &#8216;रामो द्विर्नाभिभाषते&#8217;, Rama hadn&#8217;t double standard in his talk.</p>
<p>Also Kaikeyi&#8217;s instruction: &#8220;रामो भवतु तापसः (Rama shall live like an ascetic.)&#8221; as mentioned in Ayodhya Kanda, 11:27.</p>
<p>So, Rama had to live in the forest like &#8216;Tapaswi (ascetic)&#8217;. How can he consume meat, while ascetics wouldn&#8217;t do so!?</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><strong>My Response:</strong></p>
<p>Firstly, coming to the statement of Kaikeyi, nothing proves in it that Rama being &#8216;Tapaswi (ascetic)&#8217; can&#8217;t have meat. Rather, Rama was to follow only an &#8216;ekadesham (a part)&#8217; of Tapashwi&#8217;s lifestyle. For all that we know, he carried his bow and sword along with him in the forest. Even Agastya Muni presents him with several weapons. But Tapashwis never carry weapons with them to the forest. Yet, we acknowledge that Rama was living like a Tapashwi. Similar is the case here.</p>
<p>Secondly, Ayodhya Kanda, 34:59 and 54:16 don&#8217;t mention that Rama won&#8217;t eat meat in the forest rather it proves taking fruits &amp; roots. Proof of having fruits doesn&#8217;t necessitate the denial of having meat.</p>
<p>Thirdly, as far as Ayodhya Kanda 20:29 is concerned, just to quote Govindarajiya commentary for this verse. The commentary says:</p>
<p>&#8220;अत्र आमिषशब्देन सूदैस्संस्कृतं मांसमुच्यते। केवलमांसस्वीकारस्योत्तरत्र वक्ष्यमाणत्वात् इदं मेध्यमिदं स्वादु निष्टप्तमिदमग्निनेति।&#8221;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="531" height="317" class="wp-image-8589 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/WhatsApp-Image-2020-11-25-at-8.01-531w317h.jpeg" alt="WhatsApp Image 2020-11-25 at 8.01.29 PM.jpeg" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/WhatsApp-Image-2020-11-25-at-8.01-531w317h.jpeg 531w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/11/WhatsApp-Image-2020-11-25-at-8.01-531w317h-300x179.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 531px) 100vw, 531px" /></p>
<p>Here, it clearly says &#8216;Aamishah (आमिषः)&#8217; is used to mean &#8216;meat used in a gravy&#8217;. He limits this meaning as it should not contradict with the &#8216;idam medhyam (इदं मेध्यम्, as in 2:96:2)&#8217; sloka where Rama eats and offers plain meat to Seeta.</p>
<p>Fourthly, Some Hindus may say: <em>&#8220;In this verse &#8216;Aamish (आमिष)&#8217; doesn&#8217;t mean &#8216;meat&#8217;, but &#8216;Good or favourite things as sweets etc&#8217;.&#8221;</em> The same interpretation is given by Swami Jagdishwaranand Saraswati in one of his articles. This interpretation is ill. Because I said before when a literal or unambiguous meaning is possible, ambiguous can&#8217;t be accepted. Further, &#8216;Aamish (आमिष)&#8217; is one of six names for &#8216;meat&#8217; given by Great Sanskrit Lexicon &#8216;Amarkosha (अमरकोश)&#8217;, it is the popular name for &#8216;Nāmaliṅgānuśāsanam (नामलिङ्गानुशासनम्)&#8217;.

<p>Fifthly, the secret behind mistranslation is unveiled now. Geeta Press &amp; alike are mistranslating these verses to conceal the truth that Rama was contradicting himself by his words &amp; acts. In some verses Rama says: <em>&#8220;I won&#8217;t have meat&#8221;,</em> but in others he is seen having meat. It proves Rama wasn&#8217;t fulfilling the promise he did in the palace. To conceal this mystery, Hindus are doing distortion in texts and to defend their Rama from character assassination. On the contrary, Valmiki Ramayana itself is assassinating his character not to be loyal in his pledge. This problem led Hindus to the way of forgery and they are doing intentionally mistranslating. And this isn&#8217;t slander or accusation from us, but it has been admitted by Geeta Press itself. See the footnotes by the press below Ayodhya Kanda, 56:22-28</p>

<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><strong>Hindu Argument (a preferred one by Hindus):</strong></p>
<p>When Hamuman meets Seeta at Lanka, he describes the personality of Rama to make her believe that he is the messenger of Rama. During the conversation, Seeta asks the routine activities of Rama while they were separated. In reply to this question, Hanuman describes Rama&#8217;s routine. In that conversation, he says in Sundarkanda 36:41</p>
<p>&#8220;न मांसं राघवो भुङ्क्ते न चापि मधु सेवते।</p>
<p>वन्यं सुविहितं नित्यं भक्तमश्नाति पञ्चमम्।।&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Rama is not eating meat, nor drinking wine. He takes only the one fifth of a meal (sanctioned for an ascetic) available in the forest.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><strong>My Response:</strong></p>
<p>I quote from Govindarajiya Vyakhya (popularly called by the other name &#8216;Bhushanam&#8217;) for this verse alone, as this is more than enough to substantiate my point:</p>
<p>&#8220;न मांसमिति॥ दृङ्मनस्सङ्गसङ्कल्पजागरः कृशतारतिः। ह्री त्यागोन्मादमूर्छान्ता इत्यनङ्गदशादशेति। दशावस्थास्वरतिरनेनोच्यते। मांसाद्यभोजनम् अरत्या। <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ततः</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">पूर्वं</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">तद्भोजनोक्तः</span>।&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There are ten states of mind that describe the mood of a lone lover who is separated from his/her spouse. Of these ten states, &#8216;arati&#8217; or &#8216;disinterest&#8217; is one. The restraint from eating meat and drinking liquor is out of &#8216;arati&#8217; or &#8216;disinterest&#8217; (since Rama has lost his spouse). <span style="text-decoration: underline;">That indicates his partaking of meat and liquor earlier.</span>&#8221;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="545" height="241" class="wp-image-8593 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/WhatsApp-Image-2020-11-26-at-6.25-545w241h.jpeg" alt="WhatsApp Image 2020-11-26 at 6.25.42 PM.jpeg" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/WhatsApp-Image-2020-11-26-at-6.25-545w241h.jpeg 545w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/11/WhatsApp-Image-2020-11-26-at-6.25-545w241h-300x133.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 545px) 100vw, 545px" /></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>From this detailed analysis, a just can conclude that there is no prevention of consuming meat in Hindus. Their ‘Maryada-Purushottam’ also took it in his life. In refutation of this analysis, the only expected answers from Hindus may be two. They will say: <em>“These verses are interpolated”,</em> or <em>“Muslims do misinterpret our scriptures to prove their claims”.</em> But, one can see above I did say nothing from my own. But I quoted their own scholars and books at every step. And that should be sufficient for righteous, but obstinacy has no cure. After all, what can be said except Qur&#8217;ān 7:179 —</p>
<p><em>&#8220;&#8230;they have hearts in which there is no understanding; and the eyes they do not see with; and the ears they do not hear with&#8230;!&#8221; </em></p>

<p>This article deals with contradictions in Vedas more particularly the Rig Veda. Contradictions in religious scriptures prove that either it is not a word of God because a god cannot make mistakes, or it is that the scripture underwent interpolations over time resulting in conflicting views within the scripture. Books like The Oriental Studies by John Muir and Vedic Mythology by Arthur Anthony Macdonell were very helpful on this topic, I have taken some points from my previous articles as well. Due to time constraints, I couldn&#8217;t write more, if God wills then I will add more contradictions in this article. And I request you to please mention the blog link when you copy this article, appreciate the hard work of writers by crediting the writer.</p>

<li><span style="color: #0070c0; text-decoration: underline;"><strong>WHAT DID THE ASHWINS DRAW FROM HOOF OF THE HORSE?</strong><br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>100 Jars of Sura (wine)<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.116.7 &#8220;O Heroes, ye gave wisdom to Kakṣīvān who sprang from Pajra&#8217;s line, who sang your praises. Ye poured forth from the hoof of your strong charger a hundred jars of wine as from a strainer.&#8221; Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p><strong>100 Jars of Madhu (honey)</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.117.6 &#8220;Kakṣīvān, Pajra&#8217;s son, must laud that exploit of yours, Nāsatyas, Heroes, ye who wander! When from the hoof of your strong horse ye showered a hundred jars of honey for the people.&#8221; Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>Madhu sometime also denotes wine but that&#8217;s probably not applicable here. If it meant sweet wine then the word Sura should have also been used here which is not the case. It clearly says that Ashwins (Nasatyas) drew 100 jars of Madhu (Honey).</p>

Maruts<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.85.10-11 &#8220;They with their vigorous strength pushed the well up on high, and clove the cloud in twain though it was passing strong. The Maruts, bounteous Givers, sending forth their voice, in the wild joy of Soma wrought their glorious deeds. They drave the cloud transverse directed hitherward, and poured the fountain forth for thirsting Gotama…&#8221; Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p><strong>Nasatyas/Ashwins</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.116.9 &#8220;Ye lifted up the well, O ye Nasatyas, and set the base on high to open downward. Streams flowed for folk of Gotama who thirsted, like rain to bring forth thousandfold abundance.&#8221; Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>

<p><strong>Indra<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 2.15.7 &#8220;Conscious of the disappearance of the damsels, the (Rishi) Parivrij, becoming manifest, stood up; the lame man overtook (them), the blind man beheld (them): in the exhilaration of the Soma, Indra has done these (deeds).&#8221; Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Griffith&#8217;s translation is not clear hence I quoted Wilson&#8217;s translation here but Ralph T.H. Griffith writes in the footnotes of this verse, &#8220;Paravrij, here rendered &#8216;the outcast,&#8217; is taken by Sayana as the name of a Rishi who was lame and blind. When some girls made sport of him he prayed to Indra and was made sound.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Nasadiya Sukta version</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.72.1-4 Let us proclaim with a clear voice the generations of the gods (the divine company), who, when their praises are recited, look (favourably on the worshipper) in this latter age. Brahmanaspati filled these (generations of the gods) with breath as a blacksmith (his bellows) in the first age of the gods the existent was born of the non-existent. In the first age of the gods the existent was born of the non-existent; after that the quarters (of the horizon) were born, and after them the upward-growing (trees). The earth was born from the upward-growing (tree), the quarters were born from the earth; Daksha was born from Aditi, and afterwards Aditi from Daksha. – Tr. H.H Wilson</p>
<p><strong>Purusha Sukta version</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.90.8-14 &#8220;From that great general sacrifice the dripping fat was gathered up&#8230;</p>
<p>He formed the creatures of-the air, and animals both wild and tame. From it were horses born, from it all cattle with two rows of teeth: From it were generated kine, from it the goats and sheep were born&#8230;The Moon was gendered from his mind, and from his eye the Sun had birth; Indra and Agni from his mouth were born, and Vāyu from his breath. Forth from his navel came mid-air the sky was fashioned from his head Earth from his feet, and from his car the regions. Thus they formed the worlds.&#8221; Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>

<p>Rig Veda 10.85.3-4 One thinks, when they have brayed the plant, that he hath drunk the Soma&#8217;s juice; Of him whom Brahmans truly know as Soma no one ever tastes.

<p>Rig Veda 3.43.14 states that Kikatas brings no Soma mixed with milk to the Vedic deities which suggests that even non-Aryan Kikatas inhabiting in present day Bihar possessed Soma and tasted Soma. Moreover there are also verses stating that Soma was with the Gandharvas and there are many such verses which states Soma was drunk on earth which contradicts above verse which says that no one has ever tasted Soma on earth.</p>

<p>Atharva Veda 8.9.21 &#8220;…Eight are the wombs of Aditi, eight her children…&#8221; Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p><strong>Six<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 2.27.1 &#8220;THESE hymns that drop down fatness, with the ladle I ever offer to the Kings Ādityas. May Mitra, Aryaman, and Bhaga hear us, the mighty Varuṇa Dakṣa, and Aṁśa.&#8221; Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>In later texts the number of Adityas given are twelve. But we are dealing only with the Vedas which gives varying numbers. Rig Veda 10.72.8 is much clear about number of Adityas, it states that there were total number of eight Adityas of whom Martanda died and was later brought back to life. Rig Veda 2.27.1 mentions six Adityas by their names, they are Mitra, Aryaman, Bhaga, Varuṇa, Dakṣa and Aṁśa. Atharva Veda 11.6.2 mentions all these with Vivasvan also, Rig Veda verse quoted earlier mentions Martanda as an Aditya, so now we know eight Adityas by name.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s assume that number of Adityas given in Vedas are eight but it makes the situation more complex because apart from those eight Adityas, Veda mentions various other deities as Adityas. In Atharva Veda 13.2.29, 37 Surya is called Aditya and son of Aditi. In Atharva Veda 8.2.15 Sun &amp; Moon are called two sons of Aditi, Rig Veda 8.90.11 calls Surya (sun) as Aditya. Rig Veda 8.18.3 also mentions Savitar as Aditya but for the sake of argument lets count Savitar as sun here. Indra is considered Aditya along with Varuna in Rig Veda 7.85.4, however in Rig Veda 5.51.10 Indra is mentioned separately from Adityas.</p>

<p>Rig Veda 1.64.2 &#8220;They spring to birth, the lofty Ones, the Bulls of Heaven, divine, the youths of Rudra, free from spot and stain; The purifiers, shining brightly even as suns, awful of form like giants, scattering rain-drops down.&#8221; Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>Rig Veda 7.56.1-2 &#8220;Who are these radiant men in serried rank, Rudra&#8217;s young heroes borne by noble steeds? Verily no one knoweth whence they sprang: they, and they only, know each other&#8217;s birth.&#8221; Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p><strong>Rudra being the father of Maruts and Maruts being referred as Rudras<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 5.60.5-6 &#8220;None being eldest, none among them youngest, as brothers they have grown to happy fortune. May their Sire Rudra, young and deft, and Pṛśni pouring much milk, bring fair days to the Maruts. Whether, O blessed Maruts, ye be dwelling in highest, midmost, or in lowest heaven,</p>
<p>Thence, O ye Rudras, and thou also, Agni, notice the sacrificial food we offer.&#8221; Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.114.6 &#8220;To him the Maruts&#8217; Father is this hymn addressed, to strengthen Rudra&#8217;s might…&#8221; Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.39.4 &#8220;Consumers of your foes, no enemy of yours is found in heaven or on the earth: Ye Rudras, may the strength, held in this bond, be yours, to bid defiance even now.&#8221; Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>

<p>Black Yajur Veda 3.4.9.7 &#8220;…the Rudras are eleven…&#8221; Tr. Arthur Berriedale Keith</p>
<p>There is no clear mention of 11 Rudras in the Veda. However Yajur Veda verse quoted above seems to explain number of Rudras, Adityas and other group of deities. Later text like Taittriya Samhita (Black Yajur Veda) is clear on number of Rudras.</p>

<li><span style="color: #0070c0; text-decoration: underline;"><strong>WHO WAS THE FIRST ONE TO DRINK SOMA?<br />
</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Brahman (Supreme God)<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Atharva Veda 4.6.1. The Brâhmana was the first to be born, with ten heads and ten mouths. He was the first to drink the soma; that did render poison powerless.</p>
<p><strong>Vayu<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 4.46.1 &#8220;DRINK the best draught of Soma-juice, O Vāyu, at our holy rites: For thou art he who drinketh first.&#8221; Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.134.1 Vayu, let fleet-foot coursers bring thee speedily to this our feast, to drink first of the juice we pour, to the first draught of Soma juice.</p>
<p>Rig Veda 2.11.14 …the Vayus, who drink the first libation of the Soma.</p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.135.4 … Vāyu, to taste the offerings! Drink of the pleasant-flavoured juice: the first draught is assigned to you.</p>
<p><strong>Indra<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Atharva Veda 20.99.1; Rig Veda 3.36.8 says that Indra was invited to drink Soma first. These two verses may be in a sense of Indra being invited at sacrifices to drink Soma first but contradiction can&#8217;t be ignored. Some verses states that Vayu was the first drinker and some later texts like Aitareya Brahmana elaborating this story says that there was a race between gods on who should partake Soma first, Vayu won the competition and Indra came second. But this story is in contradiction with story of falcon Suparna bringing Soma to Indra. Rig Veda states that the falcon had brought the Soma, Krishna Yajur Veda is more clear in this case wherein it states that the gods didn&#8217;t had Soma and Soma was brought by the falcon.</p>

<p><strong>Usha (Dawn)<br />

</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Friends<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 4.16.10 &#8220;Come to our home resolved to slay the Dasyu: Kutsa longed eagerly to win thy friendship. Alike in form ye both sate in his dwelling the faithful Lady was in doubt between you.&#8221; Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p><strong>Enemies</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.53.10 &#8220;Thou hast protected Suśravas with succour, and Tūrvayāṇa with thine aid, O Indra. Thou madest Kutsa, Atithigva, Āyu, subject unto this King, the young, the mighty.&#8221; Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>Rig Veda 2.14.7 &#8220;Ye ministers, to him who slew a hundred thousand, and cast them down upon earth&#8217;s bosom; Who quelled the valiant men of Atithigva, Kutsa, and Āyu,—bring to him the Soma.&#8221; Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>There are also verses wherein Indra aided Kutsa in battle against Kutsa&#8217;s enemies suggesting their friendly relationship. Later texts like Brahmanas gives different story that Kutsa was the son of Indra born from his thighs. Though Veda calls Kutsa as son of Arjuna (Rig Veda 8.1.11). If that is applied here then there will be another contradiction because Veda calls Indra and Kutsa as friends so there would be contradiction in their relationship.</p>

<p>Written by Sulaiman Razvi</p>
<p>As per Hindu texts, Brahma had an incestuous relationship with his own daughter Saraswati. Such an act was done by the creator Brahma. Puranas states that Saraswati was the daughter as well as the wife of Brahma, as per Skanda Purana III.i.41.98-99 Brahma had two wives Gayatri and Saraswati. There are several versions of this story. Some text says that Brahma was married to Saraswati and some say he had an incestuous relationship without marriage. Some say Brahma cohabited with Saraswati for propagation after marrying her and some say he cohabited with her for propagation without marriage, verses that talk about Brahma&#8217;s relationship with Saraswati for propagation don&#8217;t view the relationship as sinful. Some text says that Brahma and Saraswati were greeted and welcomed after their marriage and some text says that Brahma was punished for having an affair with his own daughter.</p>
<p><span id="more-2513"></span></p>
<p>Not only is this relationship morally wrong but this is also disgusting. Hindu apologists in their defence say that Brahma being in a relationship with his daughter Saraswati is the reason Brahma isn’t worshipped by Hindus. The fact is that there are various reasons why Brahma isn’t worshipped. Some texts say that it was a consensual relationship, then why is Saraswati worshipped by Hindus? If rape/incest is the reason Brahma isn’t worshipped then almost every Hindu god should be shunned by Hindus as they were all rapists, in fact, Hindus celebrate the rape of Vrinda by Vishnu as a festival called Tulsi Vivah, read the article Hinduism and Lust for textual references. So, this argument of Hindus doesn’t hold water. The question isn’t why he isn’t worshipped or whether Brahma was punished or not, the subject of controversy is that Brahma the so-called Creator part of Hindu Trimurti committed such an act. I have taken some references from Catherine Ludvik&#8217;s book. The following verse shows Brahma&#8217;s marriage with Saraswati and how they were welcomed in Brahma-Loka,</p>

<p>Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Krishna Janma Khanda, chapter 35, verses 8-20 &#8220;&#8230;Then he came and bowed to me; and having secured Saraswati, the enchantress of the three worlds, as his bride Brahma dallied with her in several places in solitude. After a good deal of diversion, he desisted from his amours and came back to Brahma-loka&#8230;Then they performed auspicious rites, greeted Brahman and the goddess Bharati, gladly ushered them in into the land of Brahma. Brahma sported with her day and night and was absorbed in sexual enjoyments&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Rajendra Nath Sen</p>
<p>Matsya Purana states that Saraswati was born from half portion of Brahma’s body and Brahma accepted her as his daughter but the beauty of just born Saraswati enchanted Brahma who couldn’t control his lust and regretted accepting her as his daughter.</p>
<p>Matsya Purana chapter 3, verses 30-44 &#8220;&#8230;With this view, He began to invoke Gayatri. After some time the goddess Gayatri, known under different names, viz. &#8211; Satarupa, Savitri, Sarasvati, Brahmani, etc., appeared in the form of a girl from the half portion of Brahma&#8217;s body who at the first sight mistakenly took Her for His daughter. Afterwards, the Creator, seeing that form of exquisite beauty, was fired with love and repeatedly uttered, &#8220;What an enchanting form!&#8221; At this, the Manasa putras of Brahma, i.e., Vasistha, etc., taking Savitri for their sister, began to express their feelings&#8230;&#8230;Brahma, fired with passion in her company, married Satarupa and began to pass his days in enjoyment inside a lotus. He enjoyed the company of Savitri for hundred years, and after a long time Manu was born to them.&#8221; Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>Chapter 4 of Matsya Purana justifies this act of Brahma saying that Devas beget progeny in quite different ways. It&#8217;s a conversation between Manu and Vishnu avatar Matsya,</p>
<p>Matsya Purana chapter 4, verses 1-11 &#8220;The king said, &#8220;O Merciful! I feel awfully grieved to hear that Lord Brahma married Angaja. Pray, tell me why he was not regarded as having committed a fearful sin by having done so. Remove my doubts, O, Master of the Universe! by graciously explain to me why the offspring of Brahma were allowed to intermarry in their paternal circle without any regard for close-knit kinship.&#8221; The Lord Fish replied: &#8220;O king! such doubts only arise in the case of mankind, for men have atomic bodies and beget children in a different way, while the primeval creation is celestial in which Rajoguna predominates. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The Devas not have </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">supersensious</span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;"> bodies and they beget progeny in quite different ways</span>. The celestial forms come into being in other ways, and it is very difficult for men having sensuous bodies to understand this great secret. Only supernatural intellect causes celestial creation; therefore those alone can understand its great sect who themselves possessed with such an intellect&#8230; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">O, King! the question of any prescribed order on prohibition does not arise in the deeds of the Devas</span>. Only Their desire is taken into considered in whatever they do. Other beings reap the fruits of their karma (doings) which the Devas do not. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">No doubts should therefore be raised regarding the doings of the Devas</span>, nor should beings having sensuous bodies think of doing the same deed. Besides this, as Lord, Brahma is the governor of the Vedas, so is the goddess Gayatri of the Brahmans (the sacred text, i.e., the Vedas). <span style="text-decoration: underline;">She is the </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">better-half of the Lord</span>, and this is why she appeared from his body&#8230;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">He committed no sin by marrying Her</span>. In spite of all this, Lord Brahma felt ashamed for not being able to suppress His passion in presence of His manasa sons&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, Edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>The above passage not only justifies incest between Brahma and Saraswati but also clears many doubts. Some Hindu apologists are coming up with pathetic responses to Brahma-Saraswati incest like “If Saraswati was Brahma’s daughter then what was the name of her mother? She wasn’t his daughter.” And much more, Ganesh was made by Parvati from her waste all alone without a partner yet Shiva is considered the father of Ganesh, there are many characters in the Hindu mythology who have taken birth without a father or a mother like Sita who had no father. So this is a pathetic excuse to explain the incest, the above verse from Matsya Purana like other verses clearly states that Brahma married his daughter, that should be enough to refute the rebuttal of apologists. Srimad Bhagavatam (Bhagavad Purana) states that Saraswati was Brahma Svam Duhita (own daughter), you can read the word to word Sanskrit translation by going to the ISKCON link given below,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam Canto 3, Chapter 31, verse 36 “At the sight of his <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">own daughter</span>, Brahmā was bewildered by her charms and shamelessly ran up to her in the form of a stag when she took the form of a hind.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Swami Prabhupada wrote in the commentary on this verse,</p>
<p>“Lord Brahmā’s being captivated by the charms of his daughter and Lord Śiva’s being captivated by the Mohinī form of the Lord are specific instances which instruct us that even great demigods like Brahmā and Lord Śiva, what to speak of the ordinary conditioned soul, are captivated by the beauty of woman. Therefore, everyone is advised that one should not freely mix even with one’s daughter, mother or sister because the senses are so strong that when one becomes infatuated the senses do not consider the relationship of daughter, mother or sister…” <a href="https://vedabase.io/en/library/sb/3/31/36/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">https://vedabase.io/en/library/sb/3/31/36/<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other version of this story is that Brahma had an incestuous relationship with his daughter in order to create living beings.</p>
<p>Birhadaranyaka Upanishad chapter 1, section 4, verse 3 &#8220;He was not at all happy. Therefore people (still) are not happy when alone. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">He desired a mate</span>. He became as big as man and wife embracing each other. He parted this very body into two. From that came husband and wife. Therefore, said Yajnavalkya, this (body) is one-half of oneself, like one of the two halves of a split pea. Therefore this space is indeed filled by the wife. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">He was united with her.</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">From that men were born</span>.&#8221; Tr. Swami Madhavananda</p>
<p>Adi Shankaracharya wrote on this verse,</p>
<p>&#8221;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">He, the Viraj called Manu, was united with her, his daughter called </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Satarupa</span>, whom he conceived of as his wife. From that union men were born.&#8221; <strong>Adi Shankaracharya on </strong>Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 1.4.3, Tr. Swami Madhavananda.</p>
<p>The next verse 1.4.4 says she ran away and became different animals and Prajapati assumed the male forms of those animals and raped with her thence all such creatures were born, So this shows that creation took place after Prajapati raped his daughter.</p>
<p>Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, chapter 1, section 4, verse 4. “She thought, ‘How can he be united with me after producing me from himself? Well, let me hide myself.’ She became a cow, the other became a bull and was united with her; from that cows were born. The one became a mare, the other a stallion; the one became a she-ass, the other became a he-ass and was united with her; from that one-hoofed animals were born. The one became a she-goat, the other a he-goat; the one became a ewe, the other became a ram and was united with her; from that goats and sheep were born. Thus did he project every-thing that exists in pairs, down to the ants.” Tr. Swami Madhavananda</p>
<p>Creation after father having sex with daughter is also supported by the Vedas,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.61.5-7 (Rudra), the benefactor of man, whose eager virile energy was developed, drew it back when disseminated (for the generation of offspring)again the irresistible (Rudra) concentrates (the energy) which was communicated to his maiden daughter. When the deed was done in mid-heaven in the proximity of the father working his will, and the daughter coming together, they let the seed fall slightly; it was poured upon the high place of sacrifice. When the father united with the daughter, then associating with the earth, he sprinkled it with the effusion[Semen]: then the thoughtful gods begot Brahma : they fabricated the lord of the hearth (of sacrifice); the defender of sacred rites.</p>
<p>The following Hindi translation is by Pandit Ram Govind Trivedi<br />
<span style="color: #0000ff;"><a href="https://truthabouthinduism.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/rv-10-61-5-7.jpg" class="broken_link" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="544" height="381" class="wp-image-8945 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Picture-6-544w381h.jpeg" alt="rv 10.61.5-7" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Picture-6-544w381h.jpeg 544w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Picture-6-544w381h-300x210.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 544px) 100vw, 544px" /></a></span></p>
<p>Brahmanas speaks of this illicit relationship as well,</p>
<p>Pancavimsa Brahmana 8.2.10 Prajapati went on top of his own daughter Usas. His semen flew away. It was poured on this (the earth). He made it perfect, [thinking]: &#8221;Let this [Semen] of mine not be spoiled.&#8221; He made it [something] real, namely, cattle.</p>
<p>Aitareya Brahmana 6.5.27 For the semen is like something unspeakable secretly poured forth into the womb. The sperm becomes blended. For when Prajapati had carnal intercourse with his daughter, his sperm was poured forth upon the earth (and was mixed up with it. This was done for making the sperm produce fruit.</p>
<p>Some Hindus say that these verses from Vedas are allegorical. I am not talking about whether these verses are allegorical or not although Panchavimsha and Aitareya Brahmana don&#8217;t explain it allegorically, I am concerned about the obscenity promoted in Vedas. Was Ishwar short of words that he used such vulgar words in Vedas? Why can&#8217;t he use some nice poetry if he wants to convey a message? There is no doubt that these verses promote incest between father and daughter, If Hindus don&#8217;t agree then they should furnish reference from Vedas wherein Ishwar prohibits incest between father and daughter. Another version shows that Brahma divided himself into two parts a male and a female and creatures were born from these two after their union,</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Vayaviyasamhita 7, Section I, chapter 17, verses1-4 &#8220;Securing the great and eternal Sakti from the lord and desiring to initiate the process of procreation by copulation, Brahma became a wondrous man in one half and a woman in one half. From the woman half was born Satarupa. The man half created Viraja, called Svayambhuva Manu, the first creation. Performing a difficult penance the gentle Satarupa got the Manu of bright fame as her husband.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana 1.2.9.32-38a states,</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana, part 1, Section 2 Anuṣaṅga-pāda, chapter 9, verses 32-38a &#8220;Brahma discarded his own shining physical body. After dividing his own body into two, he became a man by on half. By (another) half he became a woman and she was Satarupa. She was the Prakrti, the mother of all living beings (and manifested thus) because the lord was creating out of desire. ..The half that was created as a woman became Satarupa. That divine lady performed a very difficult penance for a hundred thousand years and obtained Purusa of brilliant fame as her husband. Indeed, he is called Manu, the Purusa, the earlier son of the self-born lord&#8230;After obtaining as his wife, Satarupa who was not born of any womb, the Purusa sported with her. Hence it is called Rati (sexual dalliance).&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Some stories also say that it was Brahma&#8217;s son and daughter who had an incestuous relationship for propagation,</p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam book 3, chapter 13, verses 15-16 &#8220;Next Svayambhava Manu sprang from the lower half of Brahma; and the daughter named Satarupa came out of the left hand side of the Brahma&#8217;s body. The two sons Priyavrata and Uttânapâda were born of Manu in the womb of S&#8217;atarûpâ and the three daughters, very beautiful and fair complexioned, were also born of him.&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagvatam 4.1.1 Sri Maitreya said: Svayambhuva Manu begot three daughters in his wife Satarupa, and their names were Akuti, Devahuti and Prasuti.</p>
<p><strong>Swami Prabhupada writes on this verse:</strong> &#8220;…The Supreme Lord Himself does the real creation by agitating His material energy, and then, by His order, Brahma, the first living creature in the universe, attempts to create the different planetary systems and their inhabitants, expanding the population through his progeny, like Manu and other progenitors of living entities, who work perpetually under the order of the Supreme Lord…Svayambhuva Manu was the son of Brahma. Brahma had many other sons, but Manu&#8217;s name is specifically mentioned first because he was a great devotee of the Lord. In this verse there is also the word ca, indicating that besides the three daughters mentioned, Svayambhuva Manu also had two sons.&#8221; <a href="http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_4.1.1" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_4.1.1<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p><strong>Swami Prabhupada</strong> <strong>on Srimad Bhagavatam 3.12.48</strong> &#8220;…His transcendental value is not to be minimized, even though he exhibited a tendency to enjoy his own daughter. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">There is a purpose for the exhibition of such a tendency by </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Brahmā</span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">, and he is not to be condemned like an ordinary living entity</span>.&#8221; <a href="http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_3.12.48" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_3.12.48<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>A version of Kausitaki shows that Brahma&#8217;s sons were attracted to their sister and Kausitaki Brahamana also finds no problem in this act,</p>
<p>Kausitaki Brahmana 6.1.1-12 &#8220;Prajapati, being desirous of propagation, underwent penance; from him when heated were born five, Agni, Vayu, Adityaa, Candramas, and Usas as fifth. He said to them, &#8216;Do ye also practise fervour.&#8217; They consecrated themselves; then when they had consecrated themselves and had acquired fervour, Usas, offspring of Prajapati, taking the form of an Apsaras, came out in front of them; to her their minds inclined; they poured out seed; they went to Prajapati, their father, and said, &#8216;We have poured out seed; let it not remain here&#8217;. Prajapati made a golden bowl, an arrow breadth in height and similar in breadth; in it he poured the seed; then arose he of a thousand eyes, of a thousand feet, with a thousand fitted (arrows).&#8221; Tr. A.B. Keith</p>
<p>Other versions shows that Brahma was punished for having an affair with his own daughter,</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana 1.7.4.1-3 Prajapati set his mind on his own daughter, either Sky or Dawn. &#8216;May I pair with her,&#8217; [he wished. He made love to her. That indeed was a sin for the gods: &#8216;He who acts thus towards his own daughter, our sister, [commits a sin].&#8217; Those gods then said to this god who is lord of cattle. &#8216;An act of transgression he commits who acts thus towards his own daughter, our sister. Pierce him.&#8217; Rudra, having aimed [him], pierced him. In the middle [of the act, his semen spurted forth. Thus indeed it was.</p>
<p>Matryani Samhita (4.214 [35, 11-15]) Prajapati desired his own daughter Usas, she became a red deer, [and he,] having assumed a buck, went on top of her. Prajapati set his mind on Usas, his own daughter. She, having become a deer, stood still for him. He, having become a buc, jumped on her. he (rudra-agni) reflected: &#8221;For this have the gods produced me, for supervision. This one (Prajapati) transgesses. Let me pierce him.&#8221; He pierced him. Pierced, he threw off this [buck] appearance and rose upwards.</p>
<p>Aitareya Brahmana 3.33.1-4 The gods saw him (Prajapati). &#8216;Prajapati does what is not done.&#8217; They sought one who would hit him. They could not find this [god] amongst one another. Their most dreadful forms they gathered into one. Brought together, those [forms] became (abhavat) this god. Therefore there is this name of his (i.e., Bhutapati) that contains [the word] Bhuta. He thrives if he thus knows this name of his. To him the gods said: &#8221;Prajapti here has done what is not done. Pierce him.&#8221; &#8216;So be it.&#8217; He said. &#8221;Let me choose a boon from you.&#8221; &#8221;Choose,&#8221; [They said]. He chose this very boon: overlordship of cattle (Pasu}. Therefore there is this name of his (Pasupati) that contains [the word] Pasu. As an owner of cattle he thrives, if he thus knows this name of his.</p>
<p>Skanda Purana III.i.40.6-12 states,</p>
<p>Skanda Purana, Book 3 &#8211; Brāhma-khaṇḍa, Section 1 &#8211; Setu-māhātmya, chapter 40, verses 6-12 &#8220;Prajpati (i.e. Brahma) was formerly deluded, O Brahmanas. He desired like a lover of his own daughter named Vac (Speech) joyously. This daughter of Prajapati became ashamed on noticing his lecherous love for her. Hence she assumed the form of a Rohita deer. Inclined to have sexual dalliance with her, Brahma too took the form of a deer. As she went ahead in the guise of a female deer, he too followed her. On seeing him intent on having sexual intercourse with his daughter, all the deities condemned him: &#8216;This Brahma is committing a deed that should not be done, i.e. (attempt to have) sexual union with one&#8217;s own daughter.&#8217; Thus they censured the creator and the Lord of the worlds. On seeing Paramesthin (Brahma) engaged in the forbidden act, Lord Hara took up the Pinaka bow and assumed the form of a hunter. He fitted one arrow to his bow. He drew the bow string as far as his ear and hit Brahma with his sharp arrow. Struck down by the arrow of the Annihilator of the three Puras, Brahma fell down on the ground.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>This is also repeated in Skanda Purana II.iii.2.3-4,</p>
<p>Skanda Purana, Book 2 &#8211; Vaiṣṇava-khaṇḍa, Section 3 &#8211; Badarikāśrama-māhātmya chapter 2, verses 3-4 “Formerly, in the beginning of Kṛtayuga, Brahmā attempted to have sexual intercourse with his own daughter who was richly endowed with beauty and youth. On seeing him like that I cut off his head with a sword into five parts in a great fury. Taking the skull (sticking to) the hand that attempted the murder of Brahmā, I immediately left the place in order to resort to various Tīrthas in heaven, earth and nether worlds and performed penances as well.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Manu and his daughter Ida incest. The following passage is obscure, it states that Manu begat offspring through his daughter by sacrifice.</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana book 1, Adhyaya 8, Brahmana 1, verses 7-10 &#8220;Being desirous of offspring, he engaged in worshipping and austerities. During this time he also performed a pâka-sacrifice: he offered up in the waters clarified butter, sour milk, whey, and curds. Thence a woman was produced in a year: becoming quite solid she rose; clarified butter gathered in her footprint. Mitra and Varuna met her. They said to her, &#8216;Who art thou?&#8217; &#8216;Manu&#8217;s daughter,&#8217; she replied. &#8216;Say (thou art) ours,&#8217; they said. &#8216;No,&#8217; she said, &#8216;I am (the daughter) of him who begat me.&#8217; They desired to have a share in her. She either agreed or did not agree, but passed by them. She came to Manu. Manu said to her, &#8216;Who art thou?&#8217; &#8216;Thy daughter,&#8217; she replied. &#8216;How, illustrious one, (art thou) my daughter?&#8217; he asked. She replied, &#8216;Those offerings (of) clarified butter, sour milk, whey, and curds, which thou madest in the waters, with them thou hast begotten me. I am the blessing (benediction): make use of me at the sacrifice! If thou wilt make use of me at the sacrifice, thou wilt become rich in offspring and cattle. Whatever blessing thou shalt invoke through me, all that shall be granted to thee!&#8217; He accordingly made use of her (as the benediction) in the middle of the sacrifice; for what is intermediate between the fore-offerings and the after-offerings, is the middle of the sacrifice. With her he went on worshipping and performing austerities, wishing for offspring. Through her he generated this race, which is this race of Manu; and whatever blessing he invoked through her, all that was granted to him. Now this (daughter of Manu) is essentially the same as the Idâ&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Julius Eggeling</p>

<p>Written by Sulaiman Razvi</p>
<p>Internet has given us the opportunity to express our views, many times internet is misused. Many people especially Hindu fanatics misuse internet by abusing other religions especially Islam even if the post is not even remotely related to Muslims. While the whole world was mourning for the victims of Christchurch Mosque attack, Hindus in India were celebrating the attack. While only this reaction on NZ attack by Hindus caught the attention of Muslims but the fact is that Hindus have been rejoicing over the death of Muslims much before the Christchurch attack happened. Indian Muslims usually blames politicians for dividing Hindus and Muslims on religious line but in reality majority of Hindus harbours hatred against Muslims. Hindus have always celebrated attack on Muslims and justified it, what does that mean? It means that Hindus are happy that someone else is doing the job they wanted to do. Majority of Hindus has genocidal intention, if they get a chance to slaughter Muslims they would happily do it. Hindus have so much hatred against Muslims that if destruction of their family leads to the extinction of Muslims then they would happily butcher their own family. While it’s true that Islamophobia can be seen in many parts of the world but no one stoops down so low as the Hindus who uses slang words against non-Hindus and Dalits. I have seen several non-Indian anti-Muslims but I have never come across any Anti-Muslim using abusive language like Hindus does or having the mentality like Hindus, but those terms have become common usage on Indian social media and websites. Journalist <a href="http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-worse-than-trump-supporters-when-mehdi-hasan-discovered-online-hindutva-trolls-2160082" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Mehdi Hasan<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> was shocked to see the mindset of Hindu trolls after he interviewed Hindu leader Ram Madhav.</p>
<p><span id="more-5274"></span></p>
<p>The celebration by Hindus over Christchurch attack is a wake-up alarm for Indian Muslims. <a href="http://vedkabhed.com/index.php/2013/10/06/how-peaceful-are-hindus/" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Hindu leaders calling for the persecution of Muslims<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> has been normalized now, no one bats an eye when any Hindu leader does that. But what’s worth noticing is that the common Hindus too has such a mentality. It’s not that Hindus were not upset after the NZ attack, they were but not because 50 Muslims were killed but because of the love and support poured down on Muslims after the NZ attack. Hindus are no different than the pagans of Arabia, both Hindus and pagans practice female foeticide, used to sacrifice children for their gods and goddesses. The Quran perfectly describes the hatred of Hindus against Muslims,</p>
<p>Quran 9:50-51 “If good befalls thee, it grieves them; but if a misfortune befalls thee, they say, “We took indeed our precautions beforehand,” and they turn away rejoicing. Say: “Nothing will happen to us except what God has decreed for us: He is our protector”: and on God let the Believers put their trust.”</p>
<p>Hindus were very hurt to see the world standing in solidarity with the Muslims since they thought that the whole world is as inhuman and as barbaric as them and expecting the world to celebrate attack on fellow humans and justify the NZ massacre. After all for them only lives of cows and Hindus matter, you can’t expect humanity from followers of a Dharm which sanctions Human sacrifice, Widow burning and encourages female foeticide. Almost every major Hindu festival is nothing but celebration of someone’s death, they celebrate Dushera which celebrates the killing of Ravana, story of Holi is about burning of Holika, Durga Puja is about killing of Mahishasura, every Hindu god &amp; goddess is depicted wielding weapons, now you can guess why Hindus has habit of celebrating deaths of non Hindus. New Zealand’s response to Christchurch attack is exemplary, it has set an example for the whole world especially for the “5000 years old way of life” in India. Another thing worth mentioning is the absence of Nationalism/Patriotism and love for fellow Indians after the attack. Some seven Indian Muslims were killed in NZ attack but Hindus felt no pain for fellow Indians, it debunks their claim that Nation is above Religion, had it been so then they would’ve mourned the death of 7 Indian Muslims killed in NZ attack.</p>
<p>Don’t ignore Hindu’s views on the internet as work of trolls because internet is a place where people usually express their opinion which cannot be aired publicly as internet guarantees more “Freedom of speech”. And this mentality is not confined to internet alone, there are several instances where Hindus came out on the streets to support killers of Muslims such as those hundreds and thousands of Hindus holding Indian flag the tricolor in their hands and <a href="https://thewire.in/225080/hindu-ekta-manch-bjp-protest-support-spo-arrested-rape-jammu" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">marching in support of rapists &amp;

Adolf Hitler was also inspired by Hindu extremism. He adopted the Swastika symbol and was proud of his Arya race.</p>
<p>Hindus hailing killers of Muslims is nothing new. Narendra Modi was elected Chief Minister of Gujarat thrice and Prime Minister twice by Hindus only because of <a href="http://www.catchnews.com/india-news/ehsan-jafri-called-modi-for-help-i-heard-modi-abuse-him-gulberg-survivor-1464888144.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">his role in 2002 Gujarat riots<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/12/world/asia/india-yogi-adityanath-bjp-modi.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">The New York Times interviewed one Sonu Yadav<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> from Gorakhpur who was honest with his views, he said, “<em>We voted for Modi because Yogi endorsed him, but we are disillusioned,” he said. He went on to refer to the 2002 riots in the state Mr. Modi led, which his critics say he allowed to rage for several days, leading to more than 1,000 deaths. All of us in our colony felt that Modi would allow us to kill Muslims,” he said. “Muslims were scared. But nothing happened. When Yogi became chief minister, they were scared again</em>.”</p>
<p>Whenever there’s a riot, Hindus would abuse Muslims and denigrate Islam but Muslims won’t do that, Muslims’ usual response would be ‘<em>preparation for upcoming election by politicians has begun</em>‘, innocent Muslims parrots their religious scholars who are blind in Hindu-Muslim Bhaichara aka the Ganga Jamuna Tehzeeb. But what Indian Muslims didn’t notice is that how come politicians use riots to garner votes? Has Indian Muslims ever asked themselves this question? They need to ponder over it. Politicians orchestrate riots because it really works, Hindus are entertained by the sufferings of Muslims and they would vote anyone who harms Muslims. If Hindus had not given any importance to Hindu politicians starting riots against Muslims then Hindu politicians would’ve given up the idea and tried other tactics to win elections, Hindu politicians just echoes their Hindu followers. I want to ask Muslims, would you vote for any Muslim candidate if he starts a riot against Hindus or spews venom against them? But your Hindu brothers does that every time, their basis for casting vote is not based on any development agenda, they vote for such candidate who either spews venom against Muslims or has butchered Muslims in riots. BJP rose to prominence only after it demolished Babri mosque, it came to power soon after demolishing Babri mosque and the riots that followed it. <a href="https://www.newsclick.in/unresolved-2007-gorakhpur-riots" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Yogi Adityanath has alleged involvement in 2007 riot<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> and has also given several hate speeches against Muslims <a href="http://www.sify.com/news/adityanath-asks-supporters-to-convert-100-muslims-for-1-hindu-girl-news-national-oi0xDpiebfeea.html" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">calling for persecution of Muslims<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, <a href="http://zeenews.india.com/news/india/will-install-gauri-ganesh-in-every-mosque-says-yogi-adityanath_1543681.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">vandalism of mosques<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> and his followers telling to <a href="http://www.indiatimes.com/news/india/yogi-adityanaths-men-telling-hindus-to-rape-dead-muslim-women-is-beyond-shocking-230679.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">rape dead Muslim women<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> and distributing <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/bjp-mp-yogi-adityanaths-outfit-offers-guns-to-hindus-in-dadri/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">weapons to Hindus in Dadri to kill Muslims<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> and such a person was elected by Hindus as Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh state. Please bear in mind that such mass murderers and hate mongers are elected by the common Hindu masses. India is probably the only place where murderers and hate mongers are elected as head of the state. States like Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, West Bengal fares better than Gujarat in every aspect then what’s the reason for Hindus’ overwhelming love for Modi? Hindus vote murderers on the pretext of development hoping that Modi would repeat 2002 all over India on a larger scale.</p>
<p>Hinduism is not a peaceful and tolerant religion, in fact, it is very violent and intolerant. Hindus using communal slurs has origin in the Hindu scripture where low caste and non-Hindus are called with objectionable words like Acchoot (Untouchable), Anarya (ill-mannered), non-Hindus are called Asur (demons), Rakashasa, Yavana, Maleccha (Barbarian/foreigner). Hindus have always had enmity and hostility towards non-Hindus. Patanjali a 4<sup>th</sup> century Hindu scholar considered the relationship between Buddhists and Brahmins to that of snake and mongoose, Adi Shankaracharya had spent his life denigrating Buddhism and persecuting Buddhists, another Hindu scholar Kumarila Bhatta was a critic of Jainism, Madhavacharya considered Adi Shankaracharya as reincarnation of Shiva for putting an end to Buddhism, 19<sup>th</sup> century Hindu scholar Swami Dayanand Saraswati was critical of almost every religion whose main target was Islam and considered <a href="/index.php/2014/05/14/mulshankar-on-jainism-and-buddhism/" data-wpel-link="internal">Jainism to be a stupid religion</a>, 20<sup>th</sup> century scholar Swami Vivekananda too had given hate speeches against Islam, Hindu poet Rabindranath Tagore had also denigrated Islam, Founder of RSS <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=dfSHAwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">K.B. Hedgewar<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> described Muslims as ‘hissing Yavana snakes’, had to be put in place or they were to face extinction become ‘dead as a dodo’. Said that the struggle for India’s freedom became a ‘religious war’ against Muslims, and so on, also said that Buddhism is a religion of cowardice. Hindu political leader <a href="https://scroll.in/article/808788/reading-savarkar-how-a-hindutva-icon-justified-the-idea-of-rape-as-a-political-tool" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Savarkar had justified rape of Muslim women<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> as a political tool &amp; wanted to <a href="https://www.dailyo.in/politics/tom-treanor-vd-savarkar-mahatma-gandhi-hitler-nationalist-hindu-mahasabha/story/1/20207.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">treat Muslims the way Negroes<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> were treated, RSS stalwart <a href="https://countercurrents.org/2017/01/17/anti-national-rss-documentary-evidences-from-rss-archives/" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Golkwalkar considered Muslims<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, Christians and Communists as internal enemies and wanted to transfer Delhi Muslims to Pakistan. These were not some Tom, Dick &amp; Harry, these were all prominent Hindu personalities and they had such hateful views of other religions, you could imagine what small-time Hindu scholars and politicians used to say against other religions. And this consistent brainwashing &amp; hate against other religions have turned the Hindu masses into monsters longing for blood of Muslims, Dalits and other minorities. They teach their children to hate Muslims &amp; Dalits <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-42650106" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">1<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJEfaHr2tmY" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">2<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, <a href="https://www.news18.com/news/india/up-students-refuse-mid-day-meal-prepared-by-lower-caste-cook-school-throws-out-food-after-protest-1871653.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">3<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/bangalore/watch-at-an-rss-inspired-school-in-karnataka-students-reenact-demolition-of-babri-masjid-6169961/" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">4<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. Can you show me few such hate speeches against Hindus by prominent Muslim leaders of the 20<sup>th</sup> century? Even to this day hundreds of Hindu leaders spew venom against Muslims and Muslim leaders don’t make such provocative speeches against Hindus except for 1-2 leaders who were jailed for their speeches. This softness against Hindu extremists is what encourages them to insult us not just in India, we have seen Hindus abusing Muslims even while <a href="/index.php/2013/10/16/hindus-in-arab-countries/" data-wpel-link="internal">working in Muslim countries</a>. It has become common for Hindu masses to use communal slurs against other religions especially against Muslims. Don’t forget that the weakest kid in the class gets bullied the most. Muslims must develop the same mentality against Hindus which Hindus have for us, Muslims must develop the same sentiments against Hindus which Hindus have for us, Muslims must reply in the same tone and language which they use against us. I am not instigating you against Hindus, I am not provoking you to take up arms against Hindus. Violence is not a solution. Indian Muslims consider Hindus as their brothers while Hindus are ready to stab in the back. I just want you to recognize the real face of the Hindu community, a known enemy is always better than an enemy hiding as a friend. This article is intended only as an eye-opener to serve as a wake-up alarm for Muslims, to show them what their Hindu brothers think of them and their religion. Once you start replying to Hindus in their language then they will think twice before insulting Islam and Muslims. No matter how good you treat them, in the end, they will malign you and <a href="/index.php/2014/10/30/ungrateful-hindus/" data-wpel-link="internal">history proves it</a>. Their hatred has gone to the extent of calling for our persecution and justifying the persecution of Muslims. In ancient India Hindu scholars like Adi Shankaracharya, Kumarila Bhatta… used to denigrate other religions and after annihilating Buddhists and Jains they have come for Muslims, Christians and other minorities and the responsibility of insulting non-Hindus is carried on the shoulders of modern Hindu scholars, refer the article <a href="/index.php/2016/06/20/violence-in-hinduism/" data-wpel-link="internal">Killing Infidels in Hinduism</a> in the category Intolerance Towards Other Religion to see modern Hindu scholars’ views on non-Hindus. Whereas gullible Muslims are busy building a positive image of Hinduism by saying that Hindutva is different from Hinduism and quoting a handful of Acharya Pramod Krishnan, Laxmi Narayan’s views on Islam. One of the first steps Muslims must take is to start referring to Hindu terrorists as Hindu Terrorists and not Sanghis, Bhakts, activists, nationalists or at least you could use the term ‘Hindutva’. Because the majority of them has anti-Muslim sentiments so we should instead differentiate Secular Hindus from Hindus instead of differentiating radical Hindus who form majority of the Hindu community. Hindus always link Islam with terrorism while openly support Hindu Terrorism in India which is the real threat. I am not generalizing, it is very wrong to do that, India’s religious minorities owe a lot to the secular Hindus, had secular Hindus not been there, India would’ve witnessed annihilation of minorities long ago but I can’t ignore the fact that secular Hindus are minority among Hindus and radical Hindus forms the majority.</p>

Yet they shamelessly claim to be most tolerant and inclusive of other religions and also claims that minorities are safe in Hindu majority India despite every community being targeted by Hindu Terrorists may it be Sikhs in 1984, 1989, Christians in Kandhamal riots, persecution of Muslims and Dalits have become routine. Hindus, whether they are politicians, religious scholars, celebrities, common people, teen or old, man or woman all of them, are dehumanizing Muslims while they live comfortably in Muslim &amp; Christian majority countries like Malaysia, Indonesia, Bangladesh, UAE, US, UK… Imagine what if these countries treat their Hindu minority the way Hindus treat Muslims, Christians and Dalits in India? Hindus are concerned about minority rights when in minority but supports Hindu extremism when in majority, <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/india/liberal-in-us-conservative-in-india-survey-finding-on-indian-americans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">The online survey<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, conducted in September 2020 by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Johns Hopkins University, and the University of Pennsylvania says, “Hindus and non-Hindus agree (the latter more so) that white supremacy is a threat in the United States, but significantly diverge on the threat posed by Hindu majoritarianism in India.” There&#8217;s demonization of Muslim countries, even some secular Hindus doesn’t criticize Hindu fascism without involving Muslims into it. They compare Hindutva extremism with Muslim countries and asks whether we want to become like so and so Muslim country? Considering the above points I say India has its own uniqueness when it comes to extremism so Hindu extremism can’t be compared to any Muslim nation. According to Hindus, Muslims in India are not discriminated because India had 4 Muslim Presidents which is proof of inclusiveness but this logic is not to be applied to Mughals and other Muslim rulers who had numerous Hindu ministers and commanders. Can racial discrimination in the west be ignored just because the USA had Barack Obama a black as its President? Indian Muslims were given fair treatment only by Secular Hindus and the majority radical Hindus have no right to take credit for that, this is why intellectuals are showing concern for growing intolerance in the country. Another answer put forth is that the Indian Muslim population is increasing hence they are not discriminated, even <a href="https://www.indiatvnews.com/news/india/hinduism-fastest-growing-religion-in-pakistan-saudi-arabia-51516.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Hindu population is fastest growing in Pakistan<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. Would Hindutvadis apply the same logic to Pakistan as well? India is <a href="https://qz.com/india/959802/india-is-the-fourth-worst-country-in-the-world-for-religious-violence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">ranked<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> 4th worst country for religious violence. A survey by <a href="https://factchecker.in/our-new-hate-crime-database-76-of-victims-over-10-years-minorities-90-attacks-reported-since-2014/" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Factchecker.in<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> provides great insight into the oppression and persecution of Indian Muslims though the survey seems to be of some selected incidents, the survey shows that Muslims, who comprise 14% of India’s population, were the victims in 62% of cases, whereas Hindus are victims only in 10% of hate crimes, Of the 172 cases in which the religion of the alleged perpetrator is known, 86% cases involved Hindus (148 cases), Hate Crime Watch shows. In 13% or 22 cases, the attackers were Muslim, hate crimes–66% or 167 cases–have been reported from states run by the BJP.</p>

<p>Hindus usually says the opposite, Hindus claim that Muslims kill girl for marrying a Hindu whereas Hate Crime Watch recorded at least 36 crimes committed over a bias against interfaith relationships. In 64% or 23 such cases, the victims involved were Muslim. Ironically Hindus who kills couples for inter-caste marriages accuses Muslims of being intolerant of inter-faith marriages. As per the survey by <a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/86-killed-in-cow-related-violence-since-2010-are-muslims-97-attacks-after-modi-govt-came-to-power/story-w9CYOksvgk9joGSSaXgpLO.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Indiaspend<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> 86% of people killed in cow-related violence were Muslims.

Instead, largely, they’re shown as terrorists without delving into the reasons why. In my book, Kurbaan (2009) has been the worst B-Town offender of the clutch, because of its sweeping generalisations and dismaying divisive tenor.

As if demonizing Muslim rulers through Saffronization of history wasn’t enough. Hindus uses numerous tactics to provoke Hindus against Muslims, when they spread fake data of declining Hindu population in <a href="https://www.indiatvnews.com/news/india/hinduism-fastest-growing-religion-in-pakistan-saudi-arabia-51516.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Pakistan<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> and <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/india/hindu-population-in-bangladesh-increasing-sushma-swaraj-in-rajya-sabha-5266275/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Bangladesh<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> then they don’t really mean that, they actually tell fellow Hindus to reduce Muslim population in India <a href="https://scroll.in/latest/809537/its-time-to-rid-india-of-muslims-sadhvi-prachi-says-in-communal-strife-torn-roorkee" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">1<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, <a href="http://www.hindustantimes.com/assembly-elections/need-to-reduce-population-bjp-gujarat-candidate-in-apparent-reference-to-muslims/story-9PDNp03Z2t33xBFerCIhoM.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">2<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>.

There have been numerous calls by <a href="/index.php/2013/10/06/how-peaceful-are-hindus/" data-wpel-link="internal">Hindus to socially and economically boycott</a> Muslims. Shops owned by Muslims are often targeted by Hindu extremists during riots to further weaken the Muslim community economically. Hindus have been consistently calling for an economic boycott of Muslims. They bear so much hatred for no valid reason. They have been taught to hate Muslims since their childhood. If they really want to boycott Muslims then they must destroy nuclear missiles given by a Muslim. That would be a very good start. Saudi Arabia is going to invest 100 billion dollars in India, Hindus must refuse that investment. Modi must not go to Muslim countries begging for investments. 3.1 million Hindus are living in Gulf countries earning their bread and butter in Muslim countries, they must be called back to serve Bharata Mata. Apart from that, there are approx. 30 million Hindus living in Bangladesh, Indonesia, Malaysia. Hindus living in these countries must stop purchasing from Muslims.</p>
<p>Muslims are a strange lot, Muslims don’t tolerate other sects and considers them to be Kafirs, Bidati, Qabarparast but when it comes to countering Islam hating Hindus verbally they cite Quranic verses about tolerating other religions as an excuse for their cowardice &amp; incapability to give a befitting response. Hindus started writing against Islam from the 19<sup>th</sup> century onwards and Ulemas of that time didn’t have time to read Hindu scriptures and expose them as they were busy in declaring fellow Muslims as Kafirs for difference in Aqeedah because for them someone insulting Islam and holy prophet ﷺ was a lesser sin compared to other Muslims have difference in Aqeedah. And it is for this reason that Hindus will for writing against Muslims grew stronger day by day. Have a look at Muslim countries, Muslim countries have hatred for one Muslim country because that country adheres to different sect, they are boycotting another Muslim country due to geopolitical reasons whereas they are busy conferring awards to Modi the killer of Muslims. Sect A hates B sect because B sect doesn’t respect three Khalifas and Ummul Momineen, another Sect C hates sect A because sect A is Gustakhe Rasool. All these three sects read the same Quran, worships the same god, believes in the same final prophet yet they have so much hate against each other but doesn’t say a word against Islam bashing Hindus who use abhorrent words for holy prophet ﷺ Islam and Quran. Indian Muslims blames only BJP for communal violence because that&#8217;s what they are told. I would like to ask Indian Muslims a question, was Pushyamitra Shunga a BJP leader who persecuted Buddhists? Did BJP exist when Raja Ganesha destroyed numerous mosques? Did BJP exist when Jaswant Singh of Marwar destroyed mosques? Riots against Muslims started from the 18th century onwards as soon as powerful Muslim rulers passed away, were there any BJP, RSS or Bajrang Dal at the time? Hindus were always radicalized, their politicians used to spew venom against Muslims in the 19th century, their religious scholars wrote books against Islam from the 19th century. This helped them create more hatred among Hindus against Muslims, Hatred doesn&#8217;t develop overnight, BJP just cashed that hatred of Hindus to come to power.</p>

<p>Its only after the NZ attack that Muslims noticed how Hindus rejoices over death of Muslims, since Hindus likes to do all mischief and not get caught so when they were caught with their pants down they tried their usual trick of whataboutery, they cited Pakistani and Kashmiri’s response on Pulwama as an excuse for their reaction on NZ attack. I don’t know how Pulwama and Christchurch attacks are related to each other. Didn’t Hindus rejoice when Pakistani soldiers were killed? There’s a difference between Pulwama and Christchurch, one was related to nation and the other was related to religion, among the Pulwama victims, there was one Muslim soldier also. Ironically Hindus who were upset over Pakistani and Kashmiri’s reaction on Pulwama were the ones who cheered when an innocent Kashmiri Muslim Farooq Ahmed Dar was tied to jeep and taken through the streets, he had gone out to cast his vote, the scene was reenacted in a movie where the protagonist ties a Kashmiri to Jeep and Hindus were printing T-Shirts of the act to cheer it. Hindus usually justify violence against Muslims by calling it retaliation. Wondering if it were Muslims who started the 1984, 1989 riots against Sikhs? Were it Muslims who started the 2008 Kandhamal riots against Christian and burned Christian missionary Staines along with his family in 1999? Was Ranvir Sena a Muslim organization that killed hundreds and thousands of Dalits? It’s actually Hindus who start riots and then calls it retaliation to justify the violence, ironically Hindus claims to be the most tolerant community in the world, then why such a “Tolerant” community is ready to “Retaliate”? Why is it that such a tolerant community is ready to take up arms against non-Hindus on trivial issues? <a href="http://www.hindustantimes.com/india/riot-breaks-out-after-muslim-barber-refuses-to-shut-shop-on-tuesday/story-TdTFCBmvWPDpOaM1ZczHsO.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Hindus started a riot<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> in Nelliyada village in Karnataka just because a Muslim barber refused to shut his shop on Tuesday because Hindus doesn’t cut their hairs on that day, <a href="https://www.jansatta.com/rajya/karnataka/communal-tension-sirsi-uttar-kannada-karnatka-rss-worker-murder/515620/lite/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Shops belonging to Muslims were burnt down by Hindus<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> in Sirsi Uttara Kannada after a rumour had spread that a Hindu boy was killed by Muslims whereas Muslims didn’t react this way when Hindus killed nearly a hundred Muslims on cow related violence in last five years, in <a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/man-arrested-in-assam-for-posting-pro-pakistan-comments-from-neighbour-s-facebook-account/story-UZUfQROT33p009KHg1BzsI.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">lower Assam<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> Hindus tried to burn down shop of a Muslim man Ahedul Ali after a Hindu man Jyotish Nath created Facebook account in Ali’s name and posted some objectionable contents against India and Hindus but when Hindus came to know about the real culprit they did nothing to the Hindu man’s house, seems the Facebook post was just an excuse to burn down shop of a Muslim, <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/india/right-wing-groups-uttarakhand-town-vandalise-shops-muslims-fake-social-media-post-5126693/" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">in Rudraprayag district of Uttarakhand<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> state Hindus burned down shops belonging to Muslims over a fake Facebook post of minor Hindu girl being killed by Muslims whereas Muslims didn’t burn anything when innocent Asifa was gang raped and murdered by Hindu priest and accomplices in communal hate crime in Kathua. So who are tolerant? There are numerous such cases where “Muslims started the riot (Satire)”. Considering these incidents it seems like Hindus are ready on their toes to attack Muslims and just an excuse is needed.</p>
<p>Muslims must give it a thought, why Hindus elect murderers of Muslims, why Hindu celebrities spew venom against Muslims, why Hindu celebrities get thousands of followers overnight after they spew venom against Muslims? why Hindus on such large scale insults Islam and Muslims? An analysis of hate speech and disinformation on the social networking site Facebook India by a South Asian American human rights and technology research organization shows that the highest proportion of hate speech — 37 percent — is linked to Islamophobia as reported by <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/islamophobia-in-37-of-hate-speech-disinformation-on-facebook-5774337/" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Indian Express<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. According to a <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/web-stories/india/why-islamaphobia-spreads-faster-on-whatsapp/articleshow/81104814.cms" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">study by the MIT and IIT researchers<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, One is three Whatsapp posts in India stokes hate and fear of Muslims. Thousands of Whatsapp groups spread venom against Muslims, &#8220;When TOI went over the dataset, there was a wide range of misinformation meant to stoke fear among Hindus. Wayanad, where Rahul Gandhi was contesting, was vilified right before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections as a place where “decrees are given to kill non-Muslims every Friday.” Muslim doctors were accused of “medical jihad,” a conspiracy theory that they kill Hindus with the fake treatment they offer, with a reference to Gorakhpur’s Dr Kafeel Khan. And “love jihad”, the messages said, was actually meant to feed a black-market organ trade — “Middle class Bharatiya girls do not smoke or drink and maintain their bodies … Ek ladki ki kimat Rs 5 crore hai (one girl costs Rs 5 crore).” Emojis, they found, were used a lot. At least one emoji was present in 52% of the fear speech messages (compared to 44% for the whole dataset). And these emojis have taken on deeply entrenched meanings. Those of the saffron flag, trident, bow and arrow, conch shells and the om symbol were used to represent Hindutva, while dehumanising emojis of demon, devil smileys, pig face and pig were used to represent Muslims.&#8221; According to <a href="https://www.thequint.com/news/politics/narendra-modi-hindutva-lok-sabha-election-results-2019-csds-survey-muslims-sikhs" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Lokniti-CSDS post poll survey<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, “Compared to other communities, a slightly larger number of Hindus said that people should have the right to promote violence against other communities, while Muslims were most likely to say that people shouldn’t have such a right. A similar pattern can be seen on the question whether people should have the right to ridicule other communities. Muslims and Sikhs were the most likely to oppose such a right while Hindus and others were more likely to support it, compared to other communities [End quote]”. why crimes against Muslims in India <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/18/world/asia/india-cow-religious-attacks.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">go unpunished<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>? Dr. Zakir Naik was forced to flee on the pretext of flimsy reasons just because he preached his religion whereas Hindus have given shelter to critics of Islam from Bangladesh, Pakistan, Canada, France, Belgium, Australia and so forth and are made to run programs and to write books against Muslims as if Hindu extremists and namesake Muslims bashing Indian Muslims wasn’t enough, I am not naming anyone but you know very well who I am talking about. Muslim bashing is a booming business in India that’s the reason critics of Islam have a great interest in India. You will never see Hindus standing in support of Muslims but you will definitely find Hindus supporting those who are in conflict with Muslims in any part of the world, when French government allowed blasphemy under the garb of freedom, Hindus in India were <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/10/27/istandwithfrance-trends-in-india-amid-outrage-in-muslim-world" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">trending hashtags<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> in support of the blasphemy, when Israel was bombarding Palestine killing hundreds of Muslims, Hindus in India were <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/5/18/bjp-expresses-solidarity-with-israel-as-gaza-bombing-continues" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">trending hashtags<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> in support of Israel, many Hindu politicians also showed their support to Israel because the those who were being killed were Muslims. China is in conflict with India and has usurped Indian territory yet Hindus praise China &#8220;re-education&#8221; camps in which Uyghurs are tortured, Hindus wish that India emulate Chinese camps. Why Islamophobics are given shelter in India? Why Hindus doesn’t want to shelter Rohingya but are giving citizenship to Hindus from Pakistan and Bangladesh, where’s the nationalism now? Why Hindus in India are worrying about Pakistani and Bangladeshi Hindus when nation is first and last for them? Ram Janmabhoomi trust chief <a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/anyone-from-pak-who-has-faith-in-lord-ram-can-come-to-ayodhya-says-ram-janmabhoomi-trust-chief/story-8JYboUV7ihtpBkEegTveNK.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Nritya Gopal Das<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> said, “Pakistan is a part of Akhand Bharat and Hindus living there are our brothers. If he (Kaneria) wants to visit Ram Mandir and offer prayers, then he is most welcome,” VHP leader Sharad Sharma said, “Pakistani Hindus have a blood relation with us and Kaneria’s statement proves this,” Indian Muslims are called Pakistani and are told to go to Pakistani whereas they welcome Pakistani Hindus with open arms, doesn&#8217;t this prove that for them religion is above nation? Go to any non Indian pages and you will definitely see Hindus commenting against Muslims. If you happen to see any Islamophobic comment then check who has liked it, most of them would be Hindus. Check Twitter handles of non-Indian, Non-Hindu Islamophobics most of their followers would be Hindus only, Hindus have so much hatred against us that they would follow anyone who spews venom against us as they believe in enemy of enemy is my friend proverb. If Hindus are secular then why right-wing party is winning every election, According to the CSDS survey 52 percent of all Hindus voted for the NDA, up nine percentage points from 43 percent in 2014? Why Hindu terrorists RSS, VHP, Bajrang Dal has 5 million members each? Why there are hundreds and thousands of riots against non-Hindus every year? According to NCRB, there were 723 communal riots in 2017 alone, there were 1092 victims of these communal riots. This is the official figure, the unofficial figure is always much higher than the official figure. The incidents registered under the Scheduled Caste Prevention of Atrocities Act saw an increase from 5,082 incidents reported in 2016 to 5,775 in 2017. Incidents of crime related to Scheduled Tribes dipped from 844 in 2016 to 720 in 2017.</p>
<p>Why Muslims are marginalized? Why is it that Muslims are attacked during Hindu festivals? Hindu festivals have become more of a show of might rather than celebration where Hindus takes out procession through Muslim dominated areas armed with swords and guns vandalizing mosques, raising objectionable slogans outside mosques and killing Muslims <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/surat/communal-tension-in-surat-for-third-day/articleshow/63571762.cms" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">1<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/delhi-bike-rally-stopped-at-four-mosques-with-swords-and-saffron-flags-5133727/" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">2<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/man-killed-after-trouble-erupted-over-ram-navami-procession-in-kolkata/articleshow/63454273.cms" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">3<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/ludhiana/faridkot-man-assaulted-for-objecting-to-holi-hooliganism-dies-5085099/" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">4<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, <a href="https://www.news18.com/news/india/dont-want-more-houses-to-burn-will-leave-if-theres-retaliation-asansol-imam-on-sons-death-1703863.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">5<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. And in case if Muslims reacts then Muslims are accused of pelting stones at “peaceful procession”, like in the case of <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/agra/video-shows-kasganj-mohalla-preparing-for-r-day-surrounded-by-tiranga-yatra-youths/articleshow/62729675.cms" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Kasganj violence<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> where Hindu mob attacked Muslims who were busy preparing for Republic Day celebration and then it was claimed by Hindus that Muslims killed a Hindu for chanting Bharat Mata Ki Jay, later <a href="http://www.jantakareporter.com/india/kasganj-communal-riots-new-cctv-footage-shows-muslims-preparing-republic-day-attacked/171505/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">CCTV footage<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> showed that Chandan Gupta was a rioter who was attacking Muslims. Why crimes are given religious color? If a Muslim is involved in any crime like murder, theft or rape then his religion is highlighted by Hindus though majority of crimes are committed by Hindus in India, it is a way to demonize Muslims and portray the Muslim community as a community of criminals, they can’t even differentiate a stray crime and a hate crime. Why Indian Muslims living in Indian states bordering Bangladesh are called Bangladeshi while the rest of the Indian Muslims (baring Kashmiris) are called Pakistanis? A party that doesn’t spew venom against Muslims or hasn’t persecuted Muslims is accused of doing “Muslim Appeasement”. The Sachar Committee report shows how much Muslims have been appeased. Reports by <a href="https://thewire.in/rights/christophe-jaffrelot-majoritarian-state-muslims-parliament" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">TheWire.in<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> &amp; <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/muslims-politicians-in-india-bjp-narendra-modi-government-5282128/" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Indian Express<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> showed that Muslims are greatly underrepresented in the Parliament because it’s the people who choose MP and Hindus doesn’t like Muslim candidates, the survey also shows that even the Congress Party is reluctant to field Muslim candidates in Hindu majority constituencies because they know that Hindus won’t vote for Muslims, approx. 20 Muslims had won the 2014 Lok Sabha election out of 543+2 Lok Sabha seats and they won only from constituencies which are Muslim majority or has sizeable Muslim population, obviously, this is an indication of Hindus’ unlikeness for Muslims. During the recent Gujarat assembly elections Hindus were spreading rumor that Congress’ CM candidate is Ahmed Patel, it was a clear expression that “hey look if you vote for Congress then they will make a Muslim man as Chief Minister”, during elections right-wing Hindus spreads pictures of secular Hindu leaders wearing Muslim skull caps and asks their fellow Hindus whether they want a Hindu Hriday Samrat leader or a skull cap-wearing leader. Check news of attack on Indian Muslims in Muslim FB pages or twitter handles, you won’t find a single comment of Muslims bashing Hindus or insulting Hinduism, then go to pro Hindu pages and check their fake news intended to peddle their imaginary victimhood of Hindu Khatre Mein Hain (Hindus are in danger) and you will see most comments are against Muslims and Islam. That’s the difference between them and us which shouldn’t exist because we can’t wait until Hindus start building gas chambers or to turn the condition of Indian Muslims like that of Rohingya Muslims. There are so many FB pages and Twitter handles created by Hindus solely dedicated for maligning Islam, and most of those pages has lakhs and millions of followers, you can’t even name one such page having at least 10K followers dedicated to exposing Hinduism. Muslims must think why Hindus takes video of them attacking Muslims? Because they know very well that they won’t be punished in the undeclared Hindu Rashtra (Hindu State), there won’t be imprisonment in the first place as they would be out on bail just as murderers of Akhlaq, Pehlu, Qasim, Junaid, Gulberg society massacre, Muzaffarnagar riots… are out on bail and if in case they get convicted by mistake then still they would be granted bail like in the case of Ajmer Dargah blast convict Bhavesh Patel, Dhananjay Desai and Gujarat riot convicts Babu Bajrangi and Maya Kodnani. Why such a free hand on murderers of Muslims? According to Hindus, the destruction of Bamiyan Buddha by Taliban terrorists is Islamic barbarism but the demolition of the Babri Mosque by Hindu Terrorists is Shaurya Divas worthy to be celebrated. If Rohingyas are persecuted then Hindus reaction would be <em>Hahaha, dekho mulle har jagah pith rahe hain</em> (hahaha, look Mullas are getting beaten up everywhere) and if IS terrorists kills in Syria then their response would be, ‘Look at these barbaric Mullahs, the religion of peace at work’.</p>
<p>Hindus are so obsessed with Muslims that anything happens and they would definitely drag Muslims which shows that Muslims always revolves around their mind. If a movie is made on fictional Hindu queen Padmavati then Hindus including their leaders like Subramanian Swamy, Togadia &amp; Giriraj dares producers to make a film on Prophet <a href="https://www.outlookindia.com/website/story/can-anyone-dare-to-make-film-on-prophet-mohammed-union-minister-giriraj-singh-as/307481" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">1<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, <a href="https://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/current-affairs/271117/padmavati-comes-in-for-stick-at-dharma-sansad.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">2<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, if someone says to use fewer firecrackers during Diwali in wake of rising pollution then Hindus will question What about Bakrid? Say the same to Mullas <a href="https://theprint.in/opinion/bloodless-bakrid-or-crackerless-diwali-religious-whataboutery-has-marred-festivals/102932/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">1<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, <a href="https://www.indiatimes.com/news/india/as-pollution-yet-again-grips-delhi-after-diwali-angry-people-debate-the-firecrackers-ban-332022.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">2<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. When train mowed down 61 Hindus in Amritsar who were celebrating Dushera on railway tracks, Hindus were not saddened with the loss of lives but they were more concerned whether the driver of the train was Muslim or not and had even started <a href="https://www.firstpost.com/india/amritsar-train-mishap-fake-news-on-muslim-driver-circulated-on-social-media-news-agency-shares-misleading-eyewitness-account-5423751.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">spreading rumour that the driver was Imtiaz Ali or Imtiaz Khan<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. These are a few of the hundreds and thousands of cases.</p>
<p>Hundreds of comments were made by Hindus celebrating NZ attack but I didn’t find a single article or coverage on those comments by any mainstream Indian media. You may have seen numerous Hindus insulting Muslims or Islam but you will rarely find Muslims doing the same against Hindus or Hinduism. Hindus even creates parody accounts in the name Muslims to spread hate and insult Islam <a href="https://www.altnews.in/rajiya-bano-or-sharma-ji-a-fake-hate-spewing-profile-exposed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">1<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> which is then shared by Hindus to show “<a href="https://www.altnews.in/fake-account-anti-hindu-tweets-tripping-right-wing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">How much Muslims hate Hindus<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>” <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.in/entry/election-2019-a-bjp-voters-whatsapp-is-the-stuff-of-nightmares_in_5cb06b64e4b098b9a2d22bf0" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">1<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, they have to create such parody accounts and spread fake news since Muslims are not interested in saying anything against Hindus, it also serves as a lesson for Muslim community who keeps silence over Hindus hatred for Muslims on the internet, Muslims are not concerned about exposing ugly face of Hindus. Muslims do not troll others like Hindus does and does not use abusive language, Muslims trolling is a rarest of the rare case. Some Muslims “trolling” Mohammed Shami, Suhana Sayeed made news headlines, these news were repeatedly reposted on Facebook and broadcasted on television, such posts attracted Hindu trolls who abused Muslims but it didn’t make any headline. I guess Muslims “trolling” Suhana Sayeed was a matter of national security that’s why it was given a lot of coverage but a Hindu BJP leader <a href="https://www.jagran.com/west-bengal/malda-15645956.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Phani Mondal<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> caught (on same week when Suhana was trolled) with 500 bombs in Malda, West Bengal didn’t find place even in newspaper let alone getting attention of mainstream media as media did with Suhana Sayeed, this reminds me of a famous Urdu poetry,</p>
<p>Ham aah bhi karte hai to ho jaate hai badnam<br />
wo qatl bhi karte hai to charcha nahi hota<br />
(I do suffer a slander, when I merely sigh she gets away with murder, no mention of it nigh)</p>
<p>Media is supposed to be unbiased, I was very shocked at the prejudice of Indian media, they randomly picked comments of some Muslims and made it news but Hindus abusing Muslims/Islam has never made headline.</p>
<p>Check news of Hindu terrorists attacking Muslims and go to the comment section, you won’t find Hindu condemning the incident rather they usually justify the attack calling it retaliation and considering it to be Karma and starts their whataboutery to divert the topic. Their whataboutery is nothing but condoning violence against Muslims, you observe that after every attack on Muslims, Hindus would come up with some invented fake news to justify the attack. I am not telling you to follow Pro Hindu Facebook pages and Twitter handles where Muslim bashing is a common scenario, go to general pages like The Times of India, Hindustan Times, The Hindu, News18, Zee News… and check comments of Hindus on posts about Muslims. Hindus leave no stone unturned in bashing Islam and Muslims. Hindus doesn’t have a heart, they justify violence on Muslim children and women as well. I took numerous screenshots of Hindus showing their hatred for Muslims and Islam, making mockery of Islam even on posts completely unrelated to the post but I will post some specific screenshots, more specifically those where Hindus have called for persecution of Muslims and celebrated massacre of Muslims because there is nothing more heinous than celebrating massacre of humans. After a while I stopped taking screenshots because of the extreme hate because it was just unbearable, I wanted to avoid negativity. <strong>I request you to not just read comments but also look at the number of likes such comments get</strong> because a comment is a view of just one person but the number of likes reflects how many Hindus endorses such hateful views. I will also post screenshots of Hindu celebrities showing their hatred against Islam and Muslims. Seems that worshipping animals has deprived them of humanity.</p>

<p>Hindus community is the only community in the world which looks at crimes from religious angle (only if the perpetrator is a Muslim), but they keep their mouth shut on numerous crimes where culprit is from their religion. An example in the above pic where they tried to communalize a crime but later it turned out that the three year old girl beheaded and raped was a Muslim and culprits were from Hindu community. Another example given below, Look at the number of likes, no one cared to check if it is a fake news or genuine one.</p>

<h1><a id="post-6295-7"></a><strong>Hindus calling for Rape of Muslim women and celebrating attack on Muslim women</strong></h1>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Hindus projected themselves as champions of women’s rights when it came to triple talaq but usually they call for rape and murder of Muslim women. When there’s news about attack on Muslim women in the west then Hindus won’t condemn the incident rather they will rejoice and start whataboutery.</p>

<p>As it is rightly said that when something bad happens to Muslims then it becomes a moment of celebration for Hindus and when something good happens then it pains them. Look at how much Hindus are happy after a Muslim woman failed to become Prime Minister of Romania.</p>

<h1><a id="post-6295-8"></a><strong>Reaction of Hindus on suffering of Muslims</strong></h1>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>When there’s news that a mosque was attacked or some country imposed some restrictions on Muslims then Hindus will never ever condemn that rather they will rejoice and start their whataboutery. When a crime against Muslims is reported then never ever expect Hindus to condemn the incident they will come up with all sort of tricks and whataboutery like What about Pandits? Where were you when… why don’t you post about Mullas? Why bring religion?</p>

<h1><a id="post-6295-9"></a><strong>Hindus on Non-Hindus</strong></h1>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Don’t think that Hindus bear hatred only against Muslims, they hate Christians, Sikhs and even Dalits its just that since Muslims are the largest minority in India so Muslims are the primary target when Hindus are done with Muslims then they will move on to other minorities</p>

<h1><a id="post-6295-10"></a><strong>Hindus Insulting Holy Prophet even when the post is irrelevent to Prophet or Islam</strong></h1>
<p>Hindus have no respect for others, they have made it their habit of mocking other faiths and religious personalities. Insulting prophet of Islam is a pass time for them, they insult holy prophet ﷺ even when the post is completely unrelated to Muslims or when a Muslim comments on politics. Reproducing slurs against holy prophet ﷺ is a sin, may Allah forgive me for that, I have erased abusive words against prophet by Hindus. It was very necessary to show you how Hindus makes mockery of other religions. Also check <a href="/index.php/2019/04/15/hindus-calling-for-massacre-of-muslims-celebrating-persecution-of-muslims/#Hindu_Celebrities_Journalists_spewing_venom_against_Muslims" data-wpel-link="internal">Hindu Celebrities and Journalists spewing venom against Muslims</a> category to see some Hindu celebrities, media persons and officers’s blasphemous remark against holy Prophet ﷺ</p>
<p>But before I begin, I would like to show you the difference between Muslims and Hindus. When an Australian ad featured Hindu god Ganesha eating meat, every Muslim was condemning it because Muslims doesn’t find it appropriate to portray other deities or that which could hurt other people but on the other hand Hindus were daring the producer of the ad to make a similar ad featuring Holy Prophet ﷺ ,</p>

<p>Hindus again trended blasphemous hashtag on 29/11/2019. They trended this hashtag on pretext of protesting murder of a lady named Priyanka Reddy in Hyderabad whose one of the culprit happened to be Mohammed Pasha. The other accused in the case were Naveen, Keshavulu and Shiva.<br />

<p>Written by Sulaiman Razvi</p>
<p>Hinduism is perhaps the only religion in the world which has a deity of liquor called Varuni and a god like Shiva associated with Bhang (cannabis). Intoxicant consumption is not unknown in Hindu society. In fact, intoxicants like Bhang and liquor have become ceremonial beverages during Hindu festivals like Holi and Diwali. Bhang (hemp/cannabis) in the form of drink is widely consumed by Hindus during the festival Holi. Even Sadhus spend their lives smoking weed to please their lord Shiva though it is in violation of NDPS act. Dr. B.R. Ambedkar wrote in his book Riddles in Hinduism, &#8220;The ancient Aryans were also a race of drunkards. Wine formed a most essential part of their religion. The Vedic Gods drank wine. The divine wine was called Soma. Since the Gods of the Aryans drank wine the Aryans had no scruples in the matter of drinking. Indeed to drink it was a part of an Aryan&#8217;s religious duty&#8230;Who were denied Soma drank Sura which was ordinary, unconsecrated wine sold in the market. Not only the male Aryans were addicted to drinking but the females also indulged in drinking. The Kaushitaki Grihya Sutra I.11-12 advises that four or eight women who are not widowed after having been regaled with wine and food should be called to dance for four times on the night previous to the wedding ceremony.&#8221;<br />
<span id="more-4848"></span></p>
<p>Consumption of liquor is clearly prohibited in Hindu scriptures and it is considered a great sin (Mahapataka) but some texts allow it under certain conditions, moreover, there are plenty of examples of Gods, Rishis and even Goddesses enjoying liquor. Some text even suggests the use of liquor for offering a libation to Hindu deities. There are approximately 11 types of liquors mentioned in Hindu scriptures such as Sura which is made from grains and was perhaps the most popular drink back then, Maireya which is Rum and made from treacle or molasses, Paista which is made from rice, Madhvika made from flowers, Madhuka made from honey, Panasa taken from jack fruit, Draksa made from grapes, Khajura sambhava made from date fruits, Nalikeraja prepared from coconut palm, Gaudi prepared from molasses, Arista which is a fermented liquor made from soapberry. Wine is praised in various ways in Hinduism, As per Agni Purana 84.1-2 dreaming about ‘wine in the night preceding the day of the ceremony, should be held as the most auspicious ones’, As per Srimad Bhagavatam 5.1.32-33 there are seven islands on Earth which are separated by seven oceans and the oceans are of salt water, sugarcane juice, wine, clarified butter, milk, curds and pure water.</p>
<p>Kumraila Bhatta a 8<sup>th</sup> century Hindu reformer observes, &#8220;Among the people of modern days we find the Brahmana women of the countries of Ahicchatra and Mathura to be addicted to drinking.&#8221; (Tantra-vartika, I.III.4). He condemned this practice in the case of Brahmins only, but not of Ksatriya and Vaisya men and women, if the liquor was distilled from fruits or flowers (Madhvi) and molasses (Gaudi) and not from grains (Sura). Madhavacharya in his Sankara Dig Vijaya Canto 15, verses 1-23 wrote that Adi Shankaracharya along with King Sudhanva traveled to Karnataka where they happened to confront Kapalikas a Shaivite sect who were engaged in drinking liquor in their worship like the Saktas. Then they had a debate on the issue. Which shows that Sadhus consumed liquor in 8<sup>th</sup> century also. Consumption of liquor by Kapalin (Shaivite sect of Hinduism) is much older than this, It is mentioned in Skanda Purana I.i.1.33-34 that Kapalins were engaged in drinking liquor. Liquor or cannabis consumption is not a taboo in the Shaivite sect because of that they are censured by Vaishnavite Hindus. Srimad Bhagavatam a Vaishnavite Purana censures Kapalins in the following way,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 4.2.28-29 “One who takes a vow to satisfy Lord Śiva or who follows such principles will certainly become an atheist and be diverted from transcendental scriptural injunctions. Those who vow to worship Lord Śiva are so foolish that they imitate him by keeping long hair on their heads. When initiated into worship of Lord Śiva, they prefer to live on wine, flesh and other such things.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p><strong>Swami Prabhupada wrote</strong>: “It is sometimes seen that devotees of Lord Śiva imitate the characteristics of Lord Śiva. For example, Lord Śiva drank an ocean of poison, so some of the <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">followers of Lord Śiva imitate him and try to take intoxicants like gāñjā (marijuana)</span>. Here the curse is that if someone follows such principles he must become an infidel and turn against the principles of Vedic regulation. It is said that such devotees of Lord Śiva will be sac-chāstra-paripanthinaḥ, which means “opposed to the conclusion of śāstra, or scripture.’…” <strong>Swami Prabhupada on Srimad Bhagavatam 4.2.28</strong> <a href="http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_4.2.28" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_4.2.28<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>

<h1>Definition of Sura &amp; Asura</h1>
<p>Devas in Hinduism are also called Sura and their enemies i.e. Demons are called Asuras, In later texts like Itihaas and Purana the definition of Sura and Asura given is that the Devas were imbibers of wine hence they were called Sura (literal meaning is liquor) and the demons did not accept liquor hence they were called A-Sura. As per stories mentioned in Hindu texts, Varuni (liquor) was born during the second churning of the ocean (Samundra Manthan) by Devas and Danavas. The Devas accepted her while the Danavas rejected her.</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana, Lalita-Mahatmya 9.66-69 &#8220;When the ocean of Milk was once again churned by the Devas and Danavas, goddess Varuni with tremulous eyes on account of inebriety, rose up even as the Siddhas in the firmament began to think &#8216;What is this&#8217;? She smilingly stood in front of the Asuras. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Daityas did not accept her. </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Therefore</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> they become Asuras</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">They were given the appellation Asura in the sense &#8216;Those who do not have Sura (liquor)</span>&#8216;. Thereupon, she stood in front of Devas. On the direction given by paramesthin (Brahma) Deva joyously accepted her. In view of the fact that they accepted Sura, they became glorified by the appellation Sura.&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Ramayana of Valmiki, Bala Kanda 1, Sarga 45, verses 36-37 &#8220;Oh, Rama, the sons of Diti, namely asuraa-s, have not espoused that daughter of Rain-god, but oh, brave Rama, the sons of Aditi on their part, namely sura-s, have espoused that impeccable Vaaruni. Thereby the sons of Diti are called a suraa-s, and the sons of Aditi are called suraa-s, and gods are delighted and rejoiced on espousing Vaaruni.&#8221; Tr. Desiraju Hanumanta Rao</p>
<p>Mahabharata mentions the vow of Asura which was to abstain from drinking alcohol,</p>
<p>Mahabharata Vana Parva 3, Section 255&#8243;&#8230;And I shall observe the Asura vow&#8230;&#8221; Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Kisari Mohan Ganguli writes, &#8220;The vow of the Asuras was (according to the Burdwan Pundits) never to drink wine&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p>Varuni is the liquor deity of Hinduism, some texts calls her the wife of Varuna and some considers her the daughter of Varuna. Wine was born after churning of the ocean as per Hindu texts,</p>
<p>Mahabharata Udyoga Parva 5, Section 102 “…<span style="color: #000000;">The gods, uniting with the Asuras, and making the Mandara mountain their pole, churned the waters of the ocean and obtained the wine called Varuni…” Tr. K.M. Ganguli </span></p>
<p>Mahabharata Udyoga Parva 5, Section 98 “…<span style="color: #000000;">Behold now, O companion of the Lord of the celestials, that abode, made entirely of gold, and full of the wine called </span><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Varuni</em></span><span style="color: #000000;">. Indeed, having obtained that wine, the gods acquired their god-heads…” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</span></p>

<h1>Consumption of Alcohol by Gods and Goddesses</h1>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Rama &amp; Sita</span></strong></p>
<p>Rama the Maryada Purshottom (ideal man) is said to have made his wife Sita drink wine and then enjoyed the dance of women,</p>
<p>Ramayana of Valmiki, Uttarakhanda 7, Sarga 42, Verses 18-23 &#8220;Like unto Purandara with Sachi <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">he took Sita by the hand, made her sit and drink the wine</span> distilled in the province of Mira. And in no time the servants brought for him <span style="color: #ff0000;">well-cooked meat</span> and various fruits. Being inebriate the beautiful <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Apsaras, well-skilled in the art of singing and dancing, began to dance before Rama</span> in the company of Kinnaris. The virtuous souled Rama, the foremost of those who know how to please, satisfied those beautiful damsels adorned with various ornaments.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">This verse appears in the 52nd Sarga of M.N. Dutt&#8217;s translation but actually, it is supposed to be in the 42nd Sarga. Following is another English translation by Hindu scholar Hari Prasad Shastri,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Valmiki Ramayana, Uttarakhanda 7, Sarga 42, Verses 18-23 &#8220;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Taking Sita by the hand, Kakutstha gave her delicious wine made of distilled honey to drink</span>, as formerly Puandara had offered to Sachi. Thereafter pure viands and fruits of every kind were brought by servants, whilst lovely Apsaras, skilled in the arts of singing and dancing, began to perform in the Prince&#8217;s presence and troops of Nymphs and Uragas, surrounded by the Kinneris intoxicated with wine, danced before Kakutstha, and the virtuous Rama, the most captivating of warriors, delighted those ravishing and charming women.&#8221; Tr.

<p>The Sanskrit word mentioned here is Madhu Maireya which is a type of liquor made from honey, Panini defines the word Madhu Maireya as,</p>

<p>The above passage also makes the definition of the word Sura (सुरा) clear. Swami Vivekananda wrote,</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p>“…Instances are found in the Râmâyana and the Mahâbhârata of the drinking of wine and the taking of meat by Rama and Krishna, whom they worship as God. Sita Devi vows meat, rice, and a thousand jars of wine to the river-goddess, Gangâ!”<br />
<a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Complete_Works_of_Swami_Vivekananda/Volume_5/Writings:_Prose_and_Poems/The_East_and_The_West/Food_and_Cooking" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Complete_Works_of_Swami_Vivekananda/Volume_5/Writings:_Prose_and_Poems/The_East_and_The_West/Food_and_Cooking<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p></blockquote>
<p>When Hanuman met Sita in the Ashok Vatika, he informed Sita about the condition of Rama, he told Sita that Rama has given up consumption of liquor and meat due to the grief of being separated from her,</p>
<p>Ramayana of Valmiki, Sundara Khanda 5, Sarga 36, verse 41 &#8220;Rama is not eating meat, nor indulging even in spirituous liquor. Everyday, in the evening, he is eating the food existing in the forest, well arranged for him.&#8221; Tr. K.M.K. Murthy</p>
<p>We know that Rama was a meat-eater, when he was about to go to Vanvaas (exile into the forest) he lamented that he would have to live in the forest without meat. So this verse indicates that Rama also consumed liquor. A verse from Ayodhya Kanda of Valmiki Ramayana states that Sita vowed to offer hundred cups of wine to the goddess if her wish is fulfilled,</p>
<p>Ramayana of Valmiki, Ayodhya Kanda 2, Sarga 55, verses 19-20 &#8220;Having come near the middle of the Kalindi, Sita prayed unto her, saying, &#8216;Hail to thee, O goddess! I cross thee. If my husband can successfully perform his vow. I will worship thee with a thousand cows and a hundred vessels of wine.&#8221; Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Hanuman</span></strong></p>
<p>The ardent Bhakt of Rama is also said to have taken intoxicants,</p>
<p>Mahabharata Vana Parva 3, Section 145, Verse 86 “…The powerful Hanuman, however, opening his eyes partially looked at him (Bhima) with disregard, with eyes reddened with intoxication&#8230;” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Krishna</span> </strong></p>
<p>In the Mahabharata, Sanjay describes Krishna and Arjuna in the company of Draupadi and Satyabhama (wife of Krishna and an incarnation of Bhudevi), exhilarated by Bassia wine,</p>
<p>Mahabharata, Udyog Parva 5, Section 59, verses 2-5 &#8220;Sanjaya said, &#8216;Listen, O king, as I tell thee the state in which I found Krishna and Dhananjaya. I will also, O Bharata, tell thee what those heroes said; O king, with looks bent down and hands joined together, and with senses well restrained, I entered the inner apartments for conferring with those gods among men. Neither Abhimanyu nor the Twins can repair to that place where <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">are the two Krishnas and Draupadi and lady Satyabhama. There I beheld those chastisers of foes, exhilarated with Bassia wine</span>, their bodies adorned with garlands of flowers.” Tr. Kisari Mohan Ganguli</p>
<p>Renowned Hindu scholar Kumarila Bhatta explained this verse of Mahabharata and justified it by saying that by drinking wine Krishna and Arjuna didn’t transgress the law. Kumarila Bhatta wrote that Sura (prepared from grain) is prohibited whereas Krishna and Arjuna drank Madhu which is not prohibited and that Kshatriyas and Vaishyas can have Madhu and Sidhi (types of liquors made from honey and molasses),</p>
<p>Tantra Vartika, Adhyaya 1, Pada III, Adhi 4(a) “Then remains the case of Krshna and Arjuna being drunk with wine, and having married the daughters of their respective maternal uncles, both being instances of direct transgressions of the law. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">But it is only the wine distilled from grains, which is called &#8216;Sura&#8217;, that is prohibited for the three higher castes;</span> says the Smrti: &#8216;Sura is the impure essence of the grains and it is evil that is spoken of as impure; hence the Brahmana, the Kshatriya and the Vaicya should never drink Sura.&#8217; <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">As for the particular wines &#8216;Madhu&#8217; (wine distilled from certain fruits, as grapes and the like), and the &#8216;Sidhu&#8217; (that distilled from molasses), these are not prohi</span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">bited for the Kshatriya and the </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Vaicya</span>, as &#8216;all intoxicating drinks&#8217; have been prohibited for the Brahmana alone. Though there is a passage that declares &#8216;all the three kinds of wine, the Gaudi (that distilled from molasses) Paishthi (that distilled from grains) and Madhu (distilled from fruits), being the same, they should not be drunk by the Brahmavadis,&#8217; yet here the word &#8216;Brahmavadi&#8217; should be taken as denoted the Brahmanas only, as the word literally means &#8216;one who is capable of teaching Brahma,&#8217; or &#8216;whose duty it is to teach Brahma&#8217;, or &#8216;whose excellence lies in such teaching&#8217;, and as the root &#8216;Vada&#8217; is synonymous with &#8216;Bru&#8217; such duties are distinctly restricted to the Brahmana alone, by such texts as &#8216;from among the three higher castes, the Brahmana alone should teach&#8217;&#8230;Hence we take the passage &#8216;All the three kinds of wine, etc,&#8217; to mean that just as the one, Sura distilled from grains, is not drinkable by the three higher castes, so are all the three undrinkable by the Brahmana otherwise, if the simple prohibition of wine in general were meant, then the words &#8216;Yathava, etc.,&#8217; and &#8216;Brahmavadibhih&#8217; would be totally redundant. The mention of &#8216;the three castes&#8217; we shall supply from out of another verse. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">For this reason, the fact of Krshna and Arjuna both Kshatriyas being intoxicated with &#8216;Madhu&#8217; (grape wine) is in no way a transgression of the law</span>. And, as a matter of fact, we have Vedic texts that distinctly show (1) that the prohibition of wine is for others (i.e, Brahmanas), and also (2) that is distinctly permissible (in the case of others)&#8230;hence the Brahmana should not drink the wine; lest he be attached to evil&#8217;, and (2) &#8216;The Kshatriya should say to the Brahmana &#8216;the drinking of wine does no harm to him who knows this&#8217;, and this latter is with the reference to the &#8216;Madhu&#8217; and the &#8216;Sidhu&#8217; (and not the &#8216;Sura&#8217; which is in no case allowed to anyone else but the Cudra)&#8230;” Tr. Ganganath Jha</p>
<p>As far as my opinion is concerned, Even Sura is not prohibited for Brahmins as Vedas the eternal law for Hindus gives instructions on the consumption of Sura for Brahmins and Kshatriyas. Padma Purana states that Krishna used to drink wine in the company of his wives who also enjoyed wine,</p>
<p>Padma Purana V.89.53-59a &#8220;Then the two, O brahmana, being tired due to many pastimes proper for the times in the groves endowed with vernal breezes on all sides, resort, with their attendants, to the root of a tree, and sitting on a divine seat, drink liquor, O best sage. Then the two, intoxicated due to the liquor, with their eyes closed due to sleep, holding each other&#8217;s hands, being under the influence of Cupid&#8217;s arrows, and desiring to sport, enter, with their words and mind stumbling on the path. There they sport like a female elephant and (the male elephant) the lord of the herd. All the friends also, intoxicated by wine, and with their eyes troubled by sleep (i.e. drowsy) sleep all around in the charming bowers. Again and again incited by his beloved, Krsna, the lord, would go near all, with a separate body (for each) and simultaneously. Having satisfied all of them as a lord of elephants satisfies the female elephants, he would, along with his beloved and with them, go to the lake to sport.&#8221; Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p>A story mentioned in Skanda and Samba Purana goes like this, Narada Muni visited Krishna, and all the Yadu boys received him with their heads bowed down in respect but Samba the son of Krishna didn’t greet him properly, So Narada thought of teaching him a lesson. So he told Krishna that his 16100 wives were sexually attracted to Samba. Krishna doesn’t believe him. Then Narada visits him again after a gap of a few days, there he sees that Krishna along with his wives were engaged in drinking liquor. Narada takes this as an opportunity to teach Samba a lesson so he tells Samba that his father i.e. Krishna is calling him. Samba goes there and sits next to his father Krishna. Intoxicated wives of Krishna becomes sexually aroused seeing the handsome boy and their private parts becomes moistened so much that even their underwear becomes drenched due to arousal. Then suddenly Narada Muni enters the place and all the wives of Krishna gets up to pay respect to Narada Muni and then all their dresses slip from their bodies including their wet underwear. Krishna then curses his wives. So it shows that Krishna used to quaff liquor along with his wives, story mentioned in Skanda Purana is too long, I have tried my best to shorten it while the Samba Purana is a summarized version by Wendy Doniger. The Skanda Purana verse also states that Samba used to enjoy liquor and had illicit relationships with women,</p>
<p>Samba Purana 3.6-55 &#8220;One day Narada came to Dvaraka to see Krsna. All the Yadu boys received him with respect, but Samba, proud of his young beauty and deluded by the fated, inevitable force of the curse, disregarded Narada. To teach Samba a lesson, Narada told Krsna that all of Krsna&#8217;s sixteen thousand wives were in love with Samba. Samba was summoned, and the women, whose minds were blurred by wine, showed inmistakable signs of passion when Samba appeared&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Skanda Purana Book VII, Section I, Chapter 101, verses 1-38 &#8220;At this very juncture (came) venerable sage Narada&#8230;In the court of his wandering at will, he always used to come to Dvaravati to pay a visit to Vasudeva. As he came on quickly all the Yadava youths beginning with Pradyumna remained with their heads (politely) bent down&#8230;but Samba due to the inevitability of the curse, slighted the noble souled Narada as usual. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Being very proud of his youth and handsome features he was forever indulgent in sexual dalliance and liquor</span>. On seeing him impolite and rude, Narada thought thus: Today I shall try to curb this impolite one&#8230;After thinking thus, he spoke to Vasudeva: O most excellent one among Devas, here there are sixteen thousand women. O my Lord, their emotional fondness for Samba is much&#8230;On hearing these words from Narada, Kesava began to think. What has thus been mentioned by Narada may have some truth in it&#8230;Narada went away as he came. A few days thereafter, he returned to Dvaraka. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">On that day the Lord was engaged in drinking liquor after enjoying aquatic sports along with all the members of his Antahpura (inner </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">apartment)&#8230;</span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Staying </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">there the Lord drank the liquor of great auspicious flavour</span>. In the meantime, fully aware that the <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">women were inebriated due to liquor</span>, Narada spoke to Samba: &#8216;O princely youth, do come and stand here. The Lord calls you. It is not proper on my part to stay on there.&#8217; Urged by Narada&#8230;Samba entered quickly and bowed down to his father. He took the seat pointed out by Visnu with natural feeling. In the meantime those women there who were deficient in self control became highly agitated as soon as they saw Samba. As they were staying within the Antahpura so long, they had not seen him before. The liquor had its own effect in making them forget everything. Further they were naturally devoid of self control. Hence their loins became moistened. On seeing an excellent man, the excellent organ of generation of women becomes moistened and dump even if they are observing celibacy or are Yoginis&#8230;After sending Samba in, Narada also came hurriedly closely on the heels of Samba. On seeing the sage coming with pleasant manners, all those women suddenly got up; they were tipsy. Even as Vasudeva was watching, when they got up suddenly their valuable garments got torn and fell down into the pots (of liquor). The clothes clinging to their loins (underwear) also fell separately. On seeing it Hari became angry, he cursed those women: O women, since your minds strayed elsewhere unmindful of me, you will not get into the regions occupied by your husband at the close of your life. Slipping down from the world of your husband as well as from the path of heaven, you will have no refuge and will fall into the clutches of robbers. As a result of this defect and curse, those women, at the time of Krsna&#8217;s heavenward departure, were abducted by robbers belonging to Pancanada even as Arjuna was looking on.&#8221; Tr. Ganesh Vasudeo Tagare</p>
<p>Mahabharata Virata Parva 4, Section 72, Verses 19-28 &#8220;And Krishna gave unto each of the illustrious sons of Pandu numerous female slaves, and gems and robes. And then the nuptial festival set in between the families of the Matsya king and the Pandavas. And then conchs and cymbals and horns and drums and other musical instruments appointed by the Pandavas, began to play in the palace of Virata. And deer of various kinds and clean animals by hundreds were slain. And wines of various kinds and intoxicating juices of trees were profusely collected.&#8221; Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Krishna in the following verse is mentioned as Rama,</p>
<p>Skanda Purana VII.I.202.10-11 &#8220;Rama with the plough as his weapon, went to the city of Dvaravati teeming with delighted and contented people. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">There he indulged in a drunken bout with the persons (ladies) </span>of his Antahpura. After imbibing wine, he seized a mace with his hand and went to the splendid garden of Raivatodyana accompanied by Revati and others. Moving in the midst of groups of women, he went along with faltering steps like an inebriated person&#8230;&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Skanda Purana VII.I.202.31-32 &#8220;The Brahmanas assembled there, were well-versed in the Puranas and were glad to listen to the stories and conducts of the primordial celestial sages. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">On seeing Rama with eyes reddened due to drinking wine</span> they thought, &#8216;He is thoroughly drunk&#8217;, and hurriedly got up and began to honour and adore Halayudha excepting Suta who continued to sit.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Suta kills the Brahmins so Krishna feels the guilt of drinking wine, vows to abstain from wine drinking and also orders corporal punishment to those guilty of drinking wine therefrom. But was the law ever implemented? Because his beloved brother Balrama was addicted to wine and Krishna’s son Samba and grandson Pradumnya is also said to have relished wine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Balarama</strong></p>
<p>Krishna’s brother Balarama was addicted to drinking liquor, several texts mentions this habit of Balarama,</p>
<p>Brahma Purana 90.5-7 &#8220;Roaming about that spot Balarama inhaled the intensive odour of wine. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">After smelling it he experienced the delight that he previously used to have in wine</span>. O sages, thereafter, Balarama saw a current of liquor suddenly falling form Kadamba. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">He derived great joy therefrom. He drank it joyously</span> in the company of cowherds and cowherdesses&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Harivamsa Purana, Visnu Parva 2.41.5-13 &#8220;Then the valiant, auspicious Sankarsana (Balarama), appearing like an elephant roamed on the peak of the mountain, without Krishna. He went under the shade of the kadamba (Nauclea Cadamba) tree, fully blossomed, enjoying the breeze with a faint smell, comfortably. While he was enjoying the breeze there, the smell of (vinous) spirituous liquor entered his nose. Immediately he was affected by the desire to have Varuni, (spirituous liquor). His face appeared dim like the face of an intoxicated person in the afternoon. Then the lord immediately remembered the ancient incident of partaking Amrita (nectar). Then, searching for spirituous liquor, he saw that tree. The water from the rain clouds, showered on the fully blossomed, beautiful tree became the spirituous liquor in the hollows of the tree. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">After drinking that liquor again and again with desire, his body was swaying with intoxication</span>. The eyes on the face of the intoxicated Balarama, with the colour of the moon in winter, started moving and rolling.

<p>Vishnu Purana 5.251-11 “Varuńa, in order to provide for his recreation, said to his wife Váruńí (the goddess of wine), &#8220;Thou, Madirá, art ever acceptable to the powerful Ananta; go therefore, auspicious and kind goddess, and promote his enjoyments.&#8221; Obeying these commands, Váruní went and established herself in the hollow of a Kadamba tree in the woods of Vrindávana. Baladeva, roaming about, came there, and smelling the pleasant fragrance of liquor, resumed his ancient passion for strong drink. The holder of the ploughshare observing the vinous drops distilling from the Kadamba tree, was much delighted, and gathered and quaffed them along with the herdsmen and the Gopís, whilst those who were skilful with voice and lute celebrated him in their songs.

His body shone brilliantly as He behaved like an elephant in rut…Angered, Lord Balarāma, the best of fighters, hurled a rock at him, but the cunning ape dodged the rock and grabbed the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Lord’s pot of liquor</span>. Further infuriating Lord Balarāma by laughing and by ridiculing Him, wicked Dvivida then broke the pot and offended the Lord even more by pulling at the girls’ clothing.

<p>Wine was often consumed by goddesses like Kali, her forms and Shaktis before a battle. There was a battle between Saktis and Danavas, the battle seems to have come to a standstill for some time while Saktis were drinking wine.</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana, Lalita-Mahatmya 28.71-89 &#8220;The oceans of liquors showered torrents of liquors of various kinds, such as Gaudi (spirit distilled from molasses), Paisti (spirit distilled from meal), Madhvi (liquor made from honey, the excellent Kadambari (spirit distilled from Kadamba flowers (Nauclea Cadamba,) Haintali (spriti from the palm of the variety, Hintala (elatepaludosa) Langaleya (spirit from the palm of the variety Langala (Mithonia superba) many varieties of palm-made spirits, divine liquors were made from the Kalpa tree.

Liquors light and lukewarm and different varieties of liquors that dispel distress and bestow victory. The Madirarnava (ocean of liquor) showered different kinds of liquor in torrent. Each one of the Yoginis (i.e. Saktis) joyously drank the torrent of liquor as big as the trunk of Airavata elephant uninterruptedly for the period of one full Yama. (3 hours). Saktis went on drinking liquor joyously with their eyes closed. Their faces were supine and moving to and fro with lolling tongues. After propitiating them by means of torrents of liquors of various kinds in this manner, the ocean of liquor assumed a divine form and came there. He approached Dandanatha and after bowing to her spoke these words&#8230;One seeing Saktis thus pointed out by the ocean of liquor, Dandini was extremly satisfied and she said to him&#8230;Due to my favour henceforth, in the age of Dvapara you will be extremely worthy of being used by Yajlikas (priests who perform sacrifices) in their sacrifices like the drinking of Soma. All the deities will drink you after you have been sanctified by means of Mantras in the course of sacrifice. After drinking you, purified by the Mantras, let the people attain Siddhi (spiritual achievement), Rddhi (prosperity), strength, heavenly bliss and salvation. All these great people will drink you viz: Mahesvari, Mahadeva, Baladeva, Bhargava, Dattatreya, Vidhi and Visnu.&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana, Lalita-Mahatmya 28.90-93 &#8220;&#8230;After gratifying the ocean of liquor by granting boons thus Dandini urged Mantrini for fighting once again and asked her to hasten it. Again the fight between Saktis and Danavas was resumed. The loud and boisterous laughter of joy pierced the eight cardinal points and mountains. Intoxicated due to the fresh wine and with the eyes rendered red, Saktis fell upon the troops of Daityas in a body and sportively.&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana, Lalita-Mahatmya 35.28 &#8220;By frequently drinking the water therein viz.: wine, the Saktis stationed on its banks become mad with inebriation and play about.

<p>Brahmanda Purana, Lalita-Mahatmya 19.49b-52 &#8220;Then, three deities were stationed on the second step of the leading chariot Cakraratha. They were seated on three (different) seats.

They were excessively proud after drinking liquor and the blood of soldiers in the army of demons&#8230;&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Asava (liquor) was given to Devahuti daughter of Swayambhuva Manu and wife of Kardama Muni,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 3.23.28 “The girls, being very respectful to Devahūti, brought her forth, and after bathing her with valuable oils and ointments, they gave her fine, new, spotless cloth to cover her body. They then decorated her with very excellent and valuable jewels, which shone brightly. Next they offered her food containing all good qualities, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">and a sweet inebriating drink called āsavam</span>.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Swami Prabhupada insists that Asava is not liquor but an Ayurvedic drink made from herbs, but then he translates the same word Asava as beer in Srimad Bhagavatam 4.18.16.</p>
<p>Matangi is one of the Mahavidyas, ten Tantric goddesses and a ferocious aspect of Devi, the Hindu Divine Mother. She is considered to be the Tantric form of Sarasvati,</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Dattatreya</span></strong></p>
<p>The Markandeya Purana tells us that once when the gods were defeated by the demons in a battle, they approached Brihaspati for help. Brihaspati sent them to Muni Dattatreya the son of Rishi Atri. When the gods approached Dattatreya, they found him drinking wine in the company of Lakshmi with whom he also had sex. The gods prayed to him for help, but he pointed out his own faults, drinking, attachment, affection and sexual enjoyment of women. But then the gods told him that he is sinless and he is not stained by these acts,</p>
<p>Markandeya Purana 18.23-32 &#8220;Thus exhorted the gods then went to <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Dattatreya&#8217;s hermitage, and they beheld the high-souled Muni, attended by Lakshmi</span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">hymned by Gandharvas and engrossed in </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">quaffing spirituous liquor</span>&#8230;Daddatreya addressed the prostrate gods, &#8216;What desire ye of me, that ye do me this obeisance&#8230;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">I am drinking strong drink</span>, I have remnants of food in my mouth, nor I subdued my senses. How is it, O gods, ye seek for victory over your enemies even from me?&#8217; <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The gods spoke. Thou art sinless</span>, O lord of the world; no stain hast thou, into whose heart, purified by the ablution of learning, has entered the light of knowledge. True is this, o gods! all learning have I, who am impartial in view: <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">but by reason of association with this woman</span> I am now impure after eating. For commerce with women when continually pursued tends to depravity. Thus addressed, the gods then spoke again. This woman, O sinless brahman! is the mother of the world; she is not depraved&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Lakshmi was present there and then he tells the gods that he had copulation with this woman (i.e. Lakshmi), Padma Purana tells us that Dattatreya had sex with Lakshmi though it doesn’t mention Lakshmi but the above verse attests to this statement,</p>
<p>Padma Purana II.103.110-113 &#8220;Atri&#8217;s son Dattatreya, the high-souled brahmana, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">the great sage, with his eyes red due to (having drunk) spirituous liquor, was sporting with a woman</span>. The virtuous one, intoxicated by wine, having seated a young, auspicious woman, best of all women, on his lap, sang, danced and heavily drank liquor&#8230;&#8221; Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p>Another verse shows that Dattatreya asked a king to bring him some meat and wine and the king presented the same,</p>
<p>Padma Purana II.103.124-8 &#8220;When a long time of many days passed, Dattatreya, in an intoxicated condition, said to the best king: &#8216;Do as I tell you. Give me wine in a cup; and the meal of flesh that is got cooked.&#8217; Hearing those words of him, that Ayu, the lord of the earth, being eager, speedily got wine in a cup, and quickly cut off well-cooked flesh with his hand, and, O best one, the best king, gave these to Dattatreya. That best sage became happy in mind&#8230;&#8221; Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Kashyapa</span></strong></p>
<p>According to Puranas, Kashyapa was a drunkard, he was addicted to wine and thus he was given the name Kashya (wine) + Hasya (laughter),</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana 2.3.1.120-1 &#8220;When Daksa was over-bearing in his speech in regard to his daughters, the holy lord became angry. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Then he drank Kasya. Liquor is called by the name Kasya</span>. The word Kasi should be understood to have the sense of Hasya (Humour, wit). The speech and mind are mentioned by the word Kasya. Liquor is remembered by Brahmanas by means of the word Kasya. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The sage is called Kasyapa due to his drinking liquor</span>.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Vayu Purana, Section II, Ch 4, verse 114-5 &#8220;Kasyapa was the knower of the sun (?) Hence he was on a par with Brahma. In every Manvantara, he is born through a part of Brahma. The subjects were angered by Daksa, it is said (?) for the sake of (his) daughters. Then he drank wine. The word &#8216;Kasya&#8217; means wine. Hascekasa should be known as Brahma&#8217;s Kasya. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Kasya is remembered by Brahmanas as wine.

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Consumption by Kings</span></strong></p>
<p>Liquor drinking seems to have been part of the life of nobles in the Vedic and Puranik period, there are some references to the consumption of liquor by kings,</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Mahabharata </span><span style="color: #000000;">Asramavasika Parva 15, Section </span><span style="color: #000000;">1 “…Pandu&#8217;s son, collected costly robes and garlands of diverse kinds and duly offered them to Dhritarashtra.

<p>Rig Veda 10.131.4-5 “Ye, Aśvins, Lords of Splendour, drank full draughts of grateful Soma juice, And aided Indra in his work with Namuci of Asura birth. As parents aid a son, both Aśvins, Indra, aided thee with their wondrous Powers and wisdom. When thou, with might <span style="text-decoration: underline;">hadst drunk the draught that gladdens</span>, Sarasvatī, O Maghavan, refreshed thee.” Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>Griffith has translated the word Sura as draught here. These verses are also repeated in Yajur Veda 20.76-78 where Griffith has mentioned the word Sura in his translation and I have further explained it in this article in the Sautramani sacrifice category. These verses are elaborated in Baudhayana Srauta Sutra,</p>
<p>Baudhayana Srauta Sutra XVII.35 &#8220;…The Maitravruna recites as the puronuvakya the verse, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">&#8216;O Asvins the guardians of the auspicious, do you two partaking of the Sura-soma in association with the demon Namuci help Indra in his deeds</span>.&#8217; Having crossed the alter and having caused to announce, he says (to the Maitravaruna), &#8216;Do you impel (the Hotr to recite the yajya for the Sura-soma set forth for the Asvins, Sarasvati and Sutraman Indra.&#8217; The Maitravaruna pronounces the call, &#8216;Let the Hotr recite the yajya for the Asvins, Sarasvati and Sutraman Indra. These Sura-soma (o gods) set forth for you-powerful, exhilerating, prepared out of the mixture&#8230;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">May the Avins, Sarasvati and Sutraman Indra the Vrtra-killer enjoy them; may they drink the sweet wine</span>, become exhilarated and enjoy. O Hotr, do you recite the yajya. The Hotr recites the yajya, &#8216;O Asvins, do you favour us with your deed like the parents their son. O Indra, when thou didst consume the Sura-soma in order to achieve good deeds and to possess powers, Sarasvati healed thee&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Chintaman Ganesh Kashikar</p>
<p>As you can read, the Sanskrit word mentioned here is Sura which means liquor, following is the snapshot from Vaman Shivaram Apte’s Sanskrit-English lexicon,</p>

<h2><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sautramani and Rajasuya Sacrifices</span></strong></h2>
<p>Wine and Soma are used in the Sautramani sacrifice. Yajur Veda chapters 19 and 21 deal with offering and consumption of Sura (liquor) and Soma mixture in sacrifices like Sautramani, Rajasuya and offerings to departed manes. Satapatha Brahmana, Kanda 12, Adhayaya 7, Brahmana 3, Verses 1-22 describes the Sautramani ritual. It is stated in the same chapter in verse 4 that Sautramani is to be performed to get rid of enemies. Yajur Veda describes the Sautramani sacrifice which is further elaborated in the Srauta Sutra and Brahmana. Indra, Ashwins, Saraswati, and Agni were the first to perform this sacrifice, Veda states that they quaffed Sura-Soma mixture. And that’s how this sacrifice started, Sura-Soma mixture is offered to deities as well as to one&#8217;s ancestors and it is to be consumed by the Brahmin priests as well.</p>
<p><strong>Preparation of Sura (liquor) in the Sautramani sacrifice</strong></p>
<p>Baudhayana Srauta Sutra XXVI.22 &#8220;The Sura to be prepared for the Sautramani contains the grains as one fourth part or one fifth part, sprouting grass and young blades: The sprouting grass is of barley and young blades are of paddy. Beans are intended for fermentation. Now this filtering basket is wooden or of split bamboo or earthen; it has however a leather spread over it. This (sacrificer) is one who has pressed Soma and who has also filtered wine. The pressing leads him to the yonder world; the filtering of wine grants him welfare here.&#8221; Tr. C.G. Kashikar</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana, Kanda 12, Adhayaya 8, Brahmana 2, verses 8-11 &#8220;The malted rice, indeed, is of the form of the morning-pressing, for the morning-pressing is this (terrestrial) world, and the latter relates to the Asvins, and Âsvina milk he pours (into the Surâ-liquor) the first night: he thus provides him (the Sacrificer 1) with the morning-pressing&#8211;with its own world, with its own deity, with its own form. And the malted barley is of the form of the midday-pressing, for the midday-pressing is the air, and the latter relates to Sarasvatî and the Sârasvata milk he pours (into the Surâ) the second night: he thus provides him with the midday-pressing&#8211;with its own world, with its own deity, with its own form. And the fried rice is of the form of the evening-pressing, for the evening-pressing is the sky, and the latter relates to Indra, and Aindra milk he pours (into the Surâ) the third night: he thus provides him with the evening-pressing&#8211;with its own world, with its own deity, with its own form. The milk of one (cow) he pours (into the Surâ) the first night, the milk of two the second night, and the milk of three the third night: he thus provides him with the pressings, in accordance with their forms, and in accordance with their deities.&#8221; Tr. Julius Eggeling</p>

<p><strong>Details on the offering of Sautramani Sacrifice</strong></p>
<p>I will be mentioning some verses from Yajur Veda chapter 19 and I will also add elaborations of those verses from Satapatha Brahmana, Baudhayana Srauta Sutra and Sankhayana Srauta Sutra. I will underline those sentences of Brahmana and Srauta Sutra which are taken from the Vedas.</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 19.1 &#8220;Sweet with the sweet, I sprinkle thee with Soma, strong with the strong, the nectar with the nectar, the honey-sweet with what is sweet as honey, Soma art thou. Get dressed for the Asvins. Get dressed for Sarasvati. Get dressed for Indra and the Good Deliverer.&#8221; Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith<br />

<p>Above Hindi translation is by Swami Karpatri Maharaj. This verse elaborated in Satapatha Brahmana as,</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana, Kanda 12, Adhyaya 7, Brahmana 3, Verses 5-6 “With (Vâg. S. XIX, 1), <span style="text-decoration: underline;">&#8216;Thee, the sweet (liquor I mix) with the sweet (Soma)</span>,&#8217; <span style="color: #ff0000;">he compounds (the ingredients for the preparation of) the Surâ-liquor, and makes it </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">palatable</span>;&#8211;&#8216;the strong with the strong,&#8217; he thereby bestows energy on him (the Sacrificer);&#8211;&#8216;the immortal with the immortal,&#8217; he thereby bestows life on him &#8216;the honeyed with the honeyed,&#8217; he thereby bestows flavour to it (the liquor);&#8211;&#8216;I mix with the Soma,&#8217; he thereby makes it (the Surâ-liquor) a form of Soma. &#8216;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Thou art Soma: get thee matured for the Asvins! get thee matured for Sarasvatî! get thee matured for Indra Sutrâman!</span>&#8216; for these were the deities who first prepared that sacrifice, and with their help he now prepares it; and, moreover, he thereby provides these deities with their share. He distils it with a view to (its being like) the Soma-pressing. For three nights it remains standing, for the Soma remains standing for three nights after it has been bought: he thus makes it a form of Soma.” Tr. Julius Eggeling</p>
<p>Mahidhara a commentator on Veda writes on Yajur Veda 19.1 about the preparation of the Sura,</p>
<p>“Having purchased (a) malted rice (sashpa), malted barley (tokma), and fried rice (lâgâh), and (b) various vegetable substances (called with the generic name of nagnahu) serving as spices and ferments, such as the bark of Vatica robusta, three myrobalans (nutmeg, areca-nut, and cloves), ginger, hog-weed, &amp;c., he takes them into the fire-house, and pounds the two lots separately. He then prepares two gruels or mashes of rice and millet respectively, adding more water than is ordinarily used, puts them on the fire till they boil over, and catches the overflowing water in two separate vessels. He then acids thereto one-third part of the (still separate) pounded malted rice and barley and fried rice (or one-sixth part into each vessel), and likewise one-half of the spice (or one-fourth part into each vessel): this mixture, called mâsara (serving both as malt and as flavouring matter), is allowed to dry and is then pounded. One-half of the remaining pounded malted rice and barley and fried rice, as well as the whole of the remaining spices, is then, in equal parts, added to the two mashes, which are thereupon poured into a large vessel, after which the pounded &#8216;mâsara&#8217; is mixed with the compound whilst the above formula is pronounced; and the pot is deposited in a hole dug in the south-western corner of the fire-shed (sâlâ), where it remains standing for three days (and nights), during which the milk of one, two, and three cows respectively, and the remaining quantities of malted and fried grain are gradually added to it.” Tr. Julius Eggeling</p>
<p>Asking the Soma to get dressed is probably talking about fermentation as stated in the Baudhaya Srauta Sutra which is an elaboration of Yajur Veda 19.1,</p>
<p>Baudhayana Srauta Sutra XVII.32 &#8220;&#8230;He piles the cooked rice around the wooden filter. Having covered it, he touches it with the formula, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">&#8216;Thou art Soma; do thou be fermented for the Asvins, fermented for Sarasvati, fermented for Sutraman Indra</span>.&#8217; The Sura mixed up together is retained for three consecutive (nights). &#8216;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Soma, after having been purchased, stays on for three nights</span>.&#8217; So says the Brahmana. When it dawns after three nights, an animal-sacrifice of three or four animals is performed. The alter prescribed for the Sautramani is measured for the sacrificer on the preceeding day. Having strewn it around, he carries the Stambayajus.&#8221; Tr. Chintaman Ganesh Kashikar</p>
<p>The Black Yajur Veda 6.1.6.5 gives mythical reason behind keeping Soma for three days/nights which shall be discussed later in this article.</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 19.4-5 &#8220;By means of this eternal sieve may Sûrya&#8217;s Daughter purify The Soma that flows forth from thee. Soma with Wine, pressed; filtered for the banquet, cleanses priest, noble, brilliancy and vigour.&#8221; Tr. Ralph. T.H. Griffith</p>

<p>Satapatha Brahmana elaborates these verses as,</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana, Kanda 12, Adhyaya 7, Brahmana 3, Verse 12 “With (Vag. S. XIX, 4), &#8216;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">She purifieth thy liquor</span>.&#8217; purifies (the Sura) in the case of one wishing for prosperity:- &#8216;thy Soma, she, the daughter of Surya:&#8217; the daughter of Surya (the sun) assuredly is Faith, and by faith that (liquor) becomes Soma-juice, and by faith he makes it to be Soma-juice; &#8216;with the perpetual tail,&#8217; for with a tail-whisk that (liquor) is purified. With (Vâg. S. XIX, 5), <span style="text-decoration: underline;">&#8216;The Brahman and Kshatra he purifieth</span>,&#8217; he purifies the milk: he thus produces the Kshatra from out of the Brahman, for from out of the priesthood the nobility is produced;&#8211;&#8216;the fiery spirit and energy;&#8217; fiery spirit and energy, vital power, he thus bestows on him;&#8211;&#8216;with the Surâ the Soma,&#8217; for with the Surâ-liquor is Soma;&#8211;&#8216;the juice, is distilled,&#8217; for from the distilled the juice is obtained;&#8211;&#8216;for joy,&#8217; to joy (intoxication), indeed, the Soma juice contributes, and to joy also does the Surâ-liquor: he thus secures both the joy of the Soma, and the joy of the Surâ;&#8211;&#8216;with the pure juice, O god, satiate the deities!&#8217; that is, &#8216;with the pure juice satisfy thou the deities;&#8217;&#8211;&#8216;with sap bestow thou food on the Sacrificer,&#8217; sap and food he thereby bestows on the Sacrificer. The cups of milk are taken first, then the cups of Surâ-liquor: he thereby makes the peasantry obedient to the nobility.” Tr. Julius Eggeling</p>
<p>Baudhayana Saruta Sutra elaborates it as,</p>
<p>Baudhayana Srauta Sutra XVII.34 &#8221; While the Adhvaryu is engaged in his duties, the Pratiprashatr filers the wine by means of the woollen filter with its fringe towards the north, with the verse, &#8216;May the daughter of Surya filter O Indra for thee the mixture of wine regarded as Soma with the evernew woollen filter.&#8217; If the sacrificer is purged of Soma (he shall filter it) with the verse, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">&#8216;The swift wine, cleansed by the filter, the associate friend of Indra has passed downwards</span>&#8230;&#8221; Tr. C.G. Kashikar</p>

<p>This is elaborated in the Satapatha Brahman,</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana, Kanda 12, Adhyaya 7, Brahmana 3, Verse 14-15 “With (Vâg. S. XIX, 7), &#8216;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Separately, indeed, a seat, acceptable to the gods, hath been prepared for you two</span>,&#8217; he fills the (three) cups of Surâ-liquor; for separate, indeed, are the Soma-juice and the Surâ-liquor; and &#8216;acceptable to the gods&#8217; he says, because these two are indeed acceptable to the gods; and &#8216;separately a seat hath been prepared&#8217; he says, because there are two altar-grounds;&#8211;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">&#8216;do not ye mingle in the highest heaven</span>!&#8217; he thereby keeps him (the Sacrificer) from evil;&#8211;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">&#8216;the potent Surâ-liquor thou art</span>,&#8217; he thereby makes Surâ to be Surâ;&#8211;&#8216;and this is Soma,&#8217; he thereby makes Soma to be Soma;&#8211;&#8216;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">entering thine own seat, injure me not</span>!&#8217; he thereby turns it (the Surâ-liquor) away to its own seat for his own safety. With a single (verse) he fills them: singly and solely on the Sacrificer he thus bestows fame, for the Surâ-liquor is fame. Verily, the cups of milk are the nobility (chieftaincy), and the cups of Surâ-liquor are the peasantry (clan): thus, were he to draw (the cups) without interlinking them, he would detach the peasantry from the nobility, and the nobility from the peasantry, and would cause confusion between the higher and lower, and a failure of the sacrifice. He draws them so as to be interlinked and thereby combines the peasantry with the nobility, and the nobility with the peasantry, for the prevention of confusion between the higher and lower, and for the success of the sacrifice.&#8221; Tr. Julius Eggeling</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana 12:7:3:8 “There are both milk and Surâ-liquor; for milk is Soma, and the Surâ-liquor food: through the milk he secures the Soma-drink, and through the Surâ-liquor food. And milk is the nobility (chieftaincy), and Surâ-liquor the peasantry (clan); the milk he purifies after purifying the Surâ-liquor: he thus produces the nobility from out of the peasantry, for the nobility is produced from out of the peasantry.” Tr. Julius Eggeling</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Yajur Veda 19.7 is also elaborated in Aitareya Brahmana which explains the Rajasuya sacrifice. In the consecration ceremony (Rajasuya?) of king mentioned in Aitareya Brahmana, the king is required to drink Sura (liquor) along with Soma which is given by the Brahmin priest,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Aitareya Brahmana, Book 8, Chapter 2, Para 8 “…The spirituous liquor represents the Kshattra, and further, the juice in the food; thus both the Kshattra and the juice in the food, are placed in him…Now he gives into his hand a goblet of spirituous liquor, under the recital of the verse, svadishthaya madishthaya, (9.1.1) i.e. ‘Purify, O Soma! with thy sweetest most exhilarating drops (the sacrificer), thou who art squeezed for Indra, to be drunk by him.’ After having put the spirituous liquor into his hand, the priest repeats a propitiatory mantra (which runs thus): <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">‘To either of you (spirituous liquor and Soma!) a separate residence has been prepared, and allotted by the gods. Do not mix with one another in the highest heaven; liquor! thou art powerful; Soma! thou art a king. Do not harm him (the king)! may either go to his own place</span><span style="color: #444444;">.’ </span>(Here is said), that the drinking of the<span style="color: #444444;"> </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Soma and that of liquor, exclude one another (they are not to be mixed). After having drunk it</span><span style="color: #444444;">…</span>Thus he finally places the liquor in his friend (gives him a share in it).” Tr. Martin Haug</span></p>
<p>Chapter 20 of Aitareya Brahmana deals with the pouring of various liquids over the king’s head by the priest and also deals with the drinking of liquor. By means of Mantra the liquor was transformed into real Soma which is then drunk by the king,</p>
<p>Aitareya Brahmana, Book 8, chapter 4, Para 20 “…Then the priest gives into his hands a goblet filled with spirituous liquor, repeating the mantra, svadishthaya. He then should drink the remainder (after previous libations to the gods)…<span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Soma beverage which is (in a mystical way) contained in the spirituous liquor, is thus drunk by the king</span>, who is inaugurated by means of Indra’s inauguration ceremony (the ceremony just described)…The drinking of spirituous liquor, or Soma, or the enjoyment of some other exquisite food, affects the body of the Kshattriya who is inaugurated by means of Indra’s great inauguration ceremony…” Tr. Martin Haug</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 19.7 is also elaborated in Baudhayana Srauta Sutra,</p>
<p>Baudhayana Srauta Sutra XVII.36 “(He recites) the verse) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">&#8216;Do you offer heartfelt sweet praise to Agni the drinker of wine, receiving Soma on the surface, the creator of all and whom horses, oxen, bulls, barren cows, sheeps released (by the sacrificer) are offered</span>,&#8217; and makes the offering at the second Vasat-uttering. He pours down the remnants of the cup for the Asvins into that for Sarasvati; the remnants of the cup for Sarasvati into that for Indra. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">A brahmana consumes it with the two verses</span>: &#8216;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">(O Sura and Soma) god has erected separate resorts for you; do not be mixed up in the high above. Thou art powerful Sura; this is Soma. Entering into thy own abode, do not injure me</span>. Whatever has remained here out of the juicy pressed drink, which Indra rank for his powers&#8230;He fills in the cups with the sediment of the Sura; he fixes the feath of the eagle into the cup of Butea frondosa&#8230;.He takes the sura with the excessive substance and pours it inot the sieve of a hundred pores with the formula, &#8216;O Pitrs with Soma as the first, be gratified.&#8217; When the liquid passes through the sieve, all offer prayers with eight verses&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Chintaman Ganesh Kashikar</p>
<p>Above passage from Baudhayana is also an elaboration of following Yajur Veda verses,</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 20.76-78 &#8220;Ye Asvins and Sarasvati, joint drinkers of the Sura draught, In Namuchi of Asura birth, gave aid to Indra in his deeds. As parents aid a son, both Asvins aided thee, Indra, with their wondrous powers and wisdom. When thou with might hadst drunk the draught that gladdens, Sarasvati, O Bounteous Lord, refereshed thee. He in whom horses, bulls, oxen, and barren cows, and rams, when duly set apart, are offered up, To Agni, Soma-sprinkled, drinker of sweet juice, Disposer, with thy heart bring forth a pleasant hymn.&#8221; Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>Griffith has translated the word “Sura” as “Draught” and “Sweet juice” here. Part of the above passage where Ashwins are said to have helped Indra to kill Namuchi is also mentioned in Baudhayana Srauta Sutra XVII.35 and Yajur Veda 20.59 which I have quoted in this article and let me again quote a few sentences of Baudhayana for your ease,</p>
<p>Baudhayana Srauta Sutra XVII.35 “…Getting up taking the two cups, the Adhvaryu says &#8216;Do you recite the puronuvakya for the Sura-soma taken for the Asvins, Sarasvati and Sutraman Indra. &#8216;The Maitravruna recites as the puronuvakya the verse, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">&#8216;O Asvins the guardians of the auspicious, do you two partaking of the Sura-soma in association with the demon Namuci help Indra in his deeds</span>.&#8217; Having crossed the alter and having caused to announce, he says (to the Maitravaruna), &#8216;Do you impel (the Hotr to recite the yajya for the Sura-soma set forth for the Asvins, Sarasvati and Sutraman Indra.&#8217; The Maitravaruna pronounces the call, &#8216;Let the Hotr recite the yajya for the Asvins, Sarasvati and Sutraman Indra. These Sura-soma (o gods) set forth for you-powerful, exhilerating, prepared out of the mixture&#8230;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">May the Avins, Sarasvati and Sutraman Indra the Vrtra-killed enjoy them; may they drink the sweet wine</span>, become exhilarated and enjoy. O Hotr, do you recite the yajya. The Hotr recites the yajya, &#8216;O Asvins, do you favour us with your deed like the parents their son. O Indra, when thou didst consume the Sura-soma in order to achieve good deeds and to possess powers, Satasvati healed thee&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Chintaman Ganesh Kashikar</p>
<p>Sankhayana elaborates it as,</p>
<p>Sankhayana Srauta Sutra XV.15.1-14 &#8220;Now the sautramani. (The victims at this occasion are) a red he goat for the Asvins, a ewe for Sarasvati, a bull for Indra the protecting (sutraman) After encircling with the firebrand has been performed on these, they proceed with the surasoma. Over the flowing (sura) they mutter&#8230;Or the verses addressed to the Fathers. The inviting (verse for the libation of the sura is) &#8216;Ye both, O Asvins, the cheering)&#8217; The formula of prompting is Let the hotr worship the Asvins, Sarasvati, Indra the protecting&#8230;The mantra to accompany the partaking of the sura is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">&#8216;The (Soma), which the Asvins took from the asura Namuci which Sarasvati pressed out to obtain</span> strength, this king Soma the bright, sweet drop, I here partake of.&#8217; If he starts from the moaning that <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">a brahmana must be engaged for a reward to drink the (remainings of the) sura</span>, the beverage (the rest of the sura) is poured out for him.&#8221; Tr. W. Caland</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 19.32 &#8220;The rite with sacred grass, wine, store of heroes, the mighty ones speed on with adorations. May we, sweet-singing sacrificers, setting Soma mid Gods in heaven, give joy to Indra.&#8221; Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith<br />

<p>Satapatha Brahmana elaborates on this verse as,</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana, Kanda 12, Adhayaya 8, Brahmana 1, verse 2 &#8220;He (the Adhvaryu) offers (of the three cups of milk) with (Vâg. S. XIX, 32), &#8216;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">By their devotions the buffalos quicken the sacrifice</span>,&#8217;&#8211;the buffalos, doubtless, are the officiating priests, and devotion is sacrifice: through the priests he causes the sacrifice to prosper, and through the sacrifice the sacrificer;&#8211;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">&#8216;the barhis-seated one, supplied with Surâ and goodly heroes</span>,&#8217; supplied with Surâ, indeed, is this barhis-seated sacrifice, to wit, the Sautrâmanî: by means of the barhis (the sacred grass on the Vedi), and the sacrifice, he causes him to prosper;&#8211;&#8216;they who bestow Soma,&#8217;&#8211;they thus bestow the Soma-drink upon him;&#8211;&#8216;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">with the deities in heaven</span>,&#8217;&#8211;they thus place him with the deities in heaven;&#8211;&#8216;may we enjoy ourselves,&#8217;&#8211;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">the Soma-juice, indeed, conduces to joy, and so does the Surâ-liquor</span>: both the joy of Soma and the joy of Surâ he thus secures;&#8211;&#8216;worshipping Indra with good hymns of praise!&#8217;&#8211;for the hymn of praise is food for the gods, and the sacrifice also is food: by sacrifice, by food, he thus makes him successful. Having sacrificed, they drink (of the milk), and thereby increase what is prosperous with him.&#8221; Tr. Julius Eggeling</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 19.33 “All essence of thine own in plants collected, all strength of Soma when poured out with Surâ—Therewith impel with joy the sacrifice, Sarasvatî, the Asvins, Indra, Agni.” Tr. Ralph T.H Griffith<br />

<p>Satapatha Brahmana elaborates it as,</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana, Kanda 12, Adhayaya 8, Brahmana 1, Verse 12 &#8220;He (the Pratiprasthâtri) offers (libations from the cups of Surâ-liquor), with (Vâg. S. XIX, 33), <span style="text-decoration: underline;">&#8216;What essence there is of thine, gathered from the plants</span>,&#8217; for this Surâ-liquor, indeed, is the essence of both the waters and the plants: by the essence of both the waters and the plants he thus causes him to prosper;&#8211;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">&#8216;the strength of the Soma-juice together with the Surâ-liquor</span>,&#8217;&#8211;he thereby secures what strength there is in the Soma-juice and in the Surâ-liquor;&#8211;&#8216;by that exhilarating drink quicken thou the Sacrificer,&#8217;&#8211;that is, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">&#8216;by that exhilarating drink gladden thou the Sacrificer;&#8217;&#8211;&#8216;Sarasvatî, the Asvins, Indra, and Agni</span>,&#8217;&#8211;by deities he (the priest) thus causes the sacrifice to prosper, and by deities and sacrifice the Sacrificer. Having made the offering, they drink (the liquor), and thereby cause to prosper what is unprosperous with him.&#8221; Tr. Julius Eggeling</p>
<p>Veda also mentions offering liquor to departed manes. The sacrificer is not supposed to drink liquor as it is meant only for offering in this case,</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 19.36 &#8220;To Fathers who claim Svadha be Svadha and homage! To Grandfathers who claim Svadha be Svadha and homage! To Great-grandfathers who claim Svadha be Svadha and homage! The Fathers have eaten. The Fathers have rejoiced. The Fathers have been satisfied. Fathers, be ye purified.&#8221; Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>It is elaborated in the Satapatha Brahmana,</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana, Kanda 12, Adhayaya 8, Brahmana 1, verses 6-8 “…this Soma-drink falls to the share of the fathers and grandfathers of whoever drinks (the liquor) on this occasion. Having shifted three coals of the southern fire to outside the enclosing-stones 1, he may there offer (of the liquor) with these (three) utterances (Vâg. S. XIX, 36):&#8211; &#8216;To the Svadhâ-loving Fathers be Svadhâ, adoration!&#8217; he thereby places the Fathers with the Svadhâ in the world of the Fathers.&#8211;&#8216;To the Svadhâ-loving grandfathers he Svadhâ, adoration!&#8217; he thereby places the grandfathers with the Svadhâ in the world of the grandfathers.&#8211;&#8216;To the Svadhâ-loving great-grandfathers be Svadhâ, adoration!&#8217; he thereby places the great-grandfathers with the Svadhâ in the world of the great-grandfathers. Having fetched water, he pours it (into the cups) with, &#8216;The Fathers have drunk:&#8217; he thereby bestows food on them;&#8211;&#8216;the Fathers have enjoyed themselves:&#8217; he thereby causes them to enjoy themselves;&#8211;&#8216;the Fathers have become satisfied:&#8217; he thereby satisfies them;&#8211;&#8216;may the Fathers cleanse themselves!&#8217; he thereby purifies all of them from the first downwards, for the Sautrâmanî is a means of purification.&#8221; Tr. Julius Eggeling</p>
<p>The following verse is about offering various animals to Vedic deities, it is also about offering liquor and asking them to drink it,</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 21.29-31 &#8220;Let the Hotar sacrifice with fuel to Agni in the place of libation, to the Asvins, Indra, Sarasvatî. A grey-coloured he-goat with wheat, jujube-fruit and sprouts of rice becomes a sweet salutary remedy, splendour, might, milk, Soma. Let them enjoy sweet butter with foaming liquor. Hotar, present offerings of butter. Let the Hotar, Tanunapat, worship Sarasvati. A sheep, a ram, a salutary remedy on the honey-sweet path, bearing to the Asvins and Indra heroic strength, with jujebe-fruit, Indra-grains, sprouts of rice, becomes a salutary remedy, milk, Soma. Let them enjoy Sweet butter with foaming liquor. Hotar, present offerings of butter&#8230;Let the Hotar, magnified with oblations, offering sacrifice, worship Sarasvati and Indra, increasing them with strength, with a bull and a cow. Strength and medicine to the Asvins and Indra are meath with jujube-fruit, Masara with parched grain, milk, Soma. Let them enjoy sweet butter with foaming liquor&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>It is elaborated in Sankhayana as,</p>
<p>Sankhayana Srauta Sutra XIV.13.1-9 &#8220;At this rite two animals a grey he goat to the Asvins a ewe to Sarasvati, are immolated in addition to the savana victim. To Indra Sutraman a barren cow of the same kind is immolated in addition to the usual one. The reason why these victims are thus tied (and slaughtered) is the wish not to depart from the sautramani. After the Savana cakes of the morning (service) they put the fuel to the fire outside and go on with the (i.e. pour out the libation of) surasoma&#8230;Now, in that for Indra Sutraman a barren cow is immolated in addition to the usual one, (the reason thereof is) along with Indra Sutraman the sautramani is completed.&#8221; Tr. W. Caland</p>
<p>Baudhayana Srauta Sutra elaborates these verses as,</p>
<p>Baudhayana Srauta Sutra XVII.35 &#8220;He carried those (cups) towards the east or north along the rear of the handles of the ladles. He takes the wine together with excessive substance and moves towards the southern fire&#8230;he formally dedicates the animals a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">gray coloured (goat) to the Asvins, a male sheep to Sarasvati and a bull to Indra</span>. He dedicates a goat to Brhaspati as the fourth animal if the sacrificer has purged Soma. After having offered their omenta as prescribed, the Adhvaryu takes up the cups for the Asvins and Sarasvati; the Pratiprasthatr takes the one for Indra. Getting up taking the two cups, the Adhvaryu says &#8216;Do you recite the puronuvakya for the Sura-soma taken for the Asvins, Sarasvati and Sutraman Indra. &#8216;The Maitravruna recites as the puronuvakya the verse, &#8216;O Asvins the guardians of the auspicious, do you two partaking of the Sura-soma in association with the demon Namuci help Indra in his deeds.&#8217; Having crossed the alter and having caused to announce, he says (to the Maitravaruna), &#8216;Do you impel (the Hotr to recite the yajya for the Sura-soma set forth for the Asvins, Sarasvati and Sutraman Indra.&#8217; The Maitravaruna pronounces the call, &#8216;Let the Hotr recite the yajya for the Asvins, Sarasvati and Sutraman Indra. These Sura-soma (o gods) set forth for you-powerful, exhilerating, prepared out of the mixture&#8230;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">May the Avins, Sarasvati and Sutraman Indra the Vrtra-killer enjoy them; may they drink the sweet wine</span>, become exhilarated and enjoy. O Hotr, do you recite the yajya. The Hotr recites the yajya, &#8216;O Asvins, do you favour us with your deed like the parents their son. O Indra, when thou didst consume the Sura-soma in order to achieve good deeds and to possess powers, Sarasvati healed thee&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Chintaman Ganesh Kashikar</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana, Kanda 12, Adhayaya 8, Brahmana 2, verse 15 &#8220;All (the praishas) contain (the word) &#8216;payas&#8217; (milk), for in the form of milk Soma is (here) pressed; they all contain (the word) &#8216;Soma,&#8217; for the sake of (conformity with) the Soma-pressing; they all contain (the word) &#8216;parisrut&#8217; (spirituous liquor), for in the form of spirituous liquor Soma is (here) pressed; they all contain (the word) &#8216;ghrita&#8217; (ghee), for this&#8211;to wit, ghee&#8211;doubtless is manifestly a form of the sacrifice: he thus makes it to be manifestly a form of the sacrifice; they all contain (the word) &#8216;madhu&#8217; (honey), for this&#8211;to wit, honey&#8211;is manifestly a form of Soma: he thus makes it to be manifestly a form of Soma.&#8221; Tr. Julius Eggeling</p>
<p>Yajur Veda verse mentions the word Parisrut which is a semi-fermented liquor according to the translator Julius Eggeling while Griffith translates it as foaming liquor. Both the sacrificer and priests have to drink Parisrut liquor offered to gods,</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana, Kanda 12, Adhayaya 8, Brahmana 2, verse 21 &#8220;This Sautrâmanî, then, is manifestly a Soma-sacrifice; and were the Sacrificer alone to drink (the liquor), it would be either an ishti-offering, or an animal sacrifice; but, for the sake of conformity of the liquor) to the Soma, all the priests drink thereof, for all the priests drink of the Soma-juice.&#8221; Tr. Julius Eggeling</p>
<p>Following Yajur Veda verses states that Agni, Sarasvati and Indra had drunk the Sura-Soma mixture,</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 21.59-60 “To-day this Sacrificer cooking viands, cooking sacrificial rice-cakes, binding a goat for the Asvins, a ram for Sarasvatî, a hull for Indra, pressing Surâ and Soma juices for the Asvins, Sarasvatî, and Indra the Good Deliverer, has chosen Agni as Hotar. To-day the divine Vanaspatî has done good service to the Asvins with a goat, to Sarasvatî with a ram, to Indra with a bull. They have eaten these from the marrow onwards, they have accepted the cooked viands, they have waxed strong with the rice-cakes. The Agnis, Sarasvatî, and Indra have drunk the Surâ and Soma draughts.” Tr. Ralph. T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>The following is the Hindi translation by Dr. Ganga Sahay Sharma,</p>

<p>This is in continuation from verse 1, so supplementary texts mentioned for Yajur Veda 21.29-31 can be read for understanding above Yajur Veda 21.59-60 verses.</p>
<p>Also check the meaning of Sura given by Panini in his Ashtadhyayi and Hindu reformer Kumarila Bhatta in his Tantra Vartika.</p>
<h2>Parisrut</h2>
<p>Julius Eggeling writes in the footnotes of Satapatha Brahmana, &#8220;According to Sayana, the difference between sura and parisrut would seem to be that the former beverage is prepared from mature shoots (of rice, &amp;c.), and the latter from such as are not quite ripe.&#8221; It is stated that Parisrut is neither Soma nor Sura. Parisrut seems to have been a semi-fermented liquor. Also see Yajur Veda 21.29 which is mentioned in the category Sautramani sacrifice and is further elaborated in Brahmana and Srauta Sutra. Satapatha Brahmana, Kanda 12, Adhayaya 8, Brahmana 2, verse 15 also mentions drinking Soma and Parisrut in Sautramani ritual.</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 20.59-65 The Asvins brought from Namuchi pressed Soma bright with <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">foaming juice</span>. Sarasvatî with sacred grass brought that to Indra for his drink. The Asvins, and the Three, apart, Sarasvatî, Idâ, Bhâratî, As drink to gladden Indra, poured strong Soma with the foaming juice. Praising with <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">foaming liquor</span> at due times, Indra, Vanaspatî, Sarasvatî as cow gave forth sweet beverage with the Asvins Twain.&#8221; Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>Read Baudhayana Srauta Sutra XVII.35 and Sankhayana Srauta Sutra XV.15.1-14 mentioned above which elaborates Yajur Veda 20.59-65. Griffith has translated the word Parisrut as foaming juice as well as foaming liquor.</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 19.95 &#8220;Splendour of victims, powerful oblation, honey and meath with milk and foaming liquor, Healing Sarasvatî effused, and Asvins; from pressed and unpressed Soma, deathless Indu.&#8221; Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 2.34 &#8220;Bearers of vigour and immortal fatness, milk and sweet beverage and foaming liquor, ye are a freshening draught. Delight my Fathers.&#8221; Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>Julius Eggeling in his translation of Satapatha Brahmana mentions Katyayana Samhita in the footnotes which elaborates the above Yajur Veda verse as,</p>
<p>Kâtyâyana Samhita IV, I, 15 “Having made (them) wash themselves as before, and having loosened (visramsya) the tuck, he makes obeisance with &#8216;adoration to your vigour, O fathers!&#8217; &amp;c. (Vâg. S. II, 32 a-f)&#8230; He pours [the water, left in the pitcher, on the cakes] with &#8216;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ye (O waters) are a refreshing draught, ye, that bring sap, immortal ghee and milk and foaming mead: gladden my fathers!&#8217; (Vâg. S. II, 34.)</span> 20, [The Adhvaryu] having laid (the cakes on the dish) the sacrificer smells at them. 21, The firebrand and the once-cut stalks of grass (he throws) into the fire. 22, The wife, if desirous of a son, eats the middle cake with, &#8216;Bestow offspring on me, O fathers, a boy crowned with lotuses; that there may he a man here!&#8217; (Vâg. S. II, 33.)…” Tr. Julius Eggeling</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 19.79 &#8220;Seeing the foaming liquor&#8217;s sap, Prajapati with the bright drank out the bright, the milk, the Soma juice, the Soma juice, BY Law, etc.&#8221; Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 3.12.7 &#8220;Hither to this (house) hath come the tender child, hither the calf along with (the other) domestic animals; hither the vessel (full) of liquor, together with bowls of sour milk!&#8221; Tr. Maurice Bloomfield</p>
<p>Griffith has translated the word Parisrut as foaming drink in this verse and in the footnotes, he provides an explanation,</p>
<p>&#8220;Foaming drink: parisutas; a beverage prepared from herbs, a sort of beer.&#8221;</p>

They take up two fires; on the northern altar 2 (they lay down) the northern (fire), and on a raised (mound) the southern one, thinking, &#8216;Lest we should offer together the Soma-libations, and the Surâ (liquor) -libations:&#8217; therefore they take up two fires, and on the northern altar (they lay down) the northern (fire), and on a raised (mound) the southern one. And when he proceeds with the omenta, then he proceeds with that spirituous liquor.</p>

<h1>Hindu Scriptures on Liquor Drinking</h1>
<p>Narada Purana not only allows one to drink liquor after offering it to gods but it also gives details on the preparation of three types of liquors,</p>
<p>Narada Purana III.90.11-22 &#8220;This Vidya is exhilarating as the intoxicating liquor. It is the means of crossing over distress. I shall now tell you the precise preparation of it. The liquor they classify into three types: Gaudi, Paisti and Madhvi. Put jaggery in hot water and stir it well. The pollen powder of the flower dhataki (grislea tomentosa) shall be put into it and the whole solution is kept in a glass jar. It is stored under ground but at dawn and at dusk the solution is stirred well with the hands. After a month is over when the sediments go to the bottom, it is filtered. This can be used for worship. This is called Gaudi because it is prepared from Guda. Similarly, that which is got by adding honey is called Madhvi. O dear one, listen to the Paisti variety. Rice should be boiled slowly and cooked in two and a half times more water (than the rice). It should be left over for three days. Then the powdered sprout of the embylic Myrobalan is put into it. Keep this in an airy place for a day where there is not much of wind. Water is then poured into it and stirred well. This is then filtered. It is then called Paistika Madhu. Artificial liquor is prepared in two ways extracting from trees or squeezing from fruits. Listen to the mode of its preparation. By its taste the mind gets repose. Bunches of grapes, or date fruits or the flowers of Bassia latifolia are put into water and boiled to half the original quantity. To this add a small quantity of distilled spirit and keep it undisturbed for two days. After filtering the same it becomes tasty and auspicious, worthy of being offered for worship. I causes full repose of the mind. As to the second variety it is prepared from the coconut, Hintala or palm trees. The milk that exudes from the stalk of the fruit must be taken fresh from the tree. It is tasty. Take the water out of the coconut fruit. Put a little camphor therein. The juice of Arecanut half the quantity of the former. Mix both and keep it in the sunlight. This immediately becomes liquor which the gods are very fond of.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Another verse from Narada Purana permits one to drink a certain amount of liquor after offering it to deities,</p>
<p>Narada Purana III.90.23-28 &#8220;Or the devotee shall offer for the arghya to the goddess the liquor which has been mentioned here. It must be offered immediately which will be fruitful. The aspirant while remaining in trance should drink it always restricting his diet. Never should a siddha drink it unless it has been first offered to the goddess. It should be drunk until the mind is wholly absorbed in the Goddess. If he drinks more than that he shall become a sinner immediately. He who drinks wine with wilful desire without serving it to the god becomes a sinner. He should be punished by the king for he is the worshipper of avidya &#8230;The devotee with the previously-mentioned form should worship the deities of the above-mentioned forms. He should worship them in the proper sequence with the offering if wine, fish and meat duly consecrated.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Baudhayana Dharma Shastra permits the drinking of Rum only for South Indian Hindus,</p>
<p>Baudhayana Dharma Shastra, Prasna 1, Adhyaya 1, Kandika 1, verses 1-4 “There is a dispute regarding five (practices) both in the south and in the north…Now (the customs peculiar) to the north are, to deal in wool, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">to drink rum</span>, to sell animals that have teeth in the upper and in the lower jaws, to follow the trade of arms, to go to sea. He who follows (these practices) in any other country than where they prevail, commits sin.”</p>
<p>Indra questions Brihaspati about Asava (a type of liquor) and Brihaspati explains to him in detail and also about which type of liquor is permissible for Kshatriya, Vaishya after offering it to deities,</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana, Lalita-Mahatmya 7.63-76 &#8220;Indra said: &#8216;What is the nature of Asava? (Liquor). What is its defect? What is its merit? What type of cooked food is defective? Mention this in detail to me.&#8217; Brihaspati said: The different types of intoxicating beverages are as follows: Paiffika (made from flour or rice), Talaja (from the date palm), Kaira (cocounut palm-juice), Madhuka (made from honey or Madhuka flowers), Gudasambhava (prepared from molasses). In regard to sinful nature the later ones mentioned above are half as dreadful as the earlier ones. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Asava can be used as a beverage by the three castes beginning with the Ksatriyas</span>. Excepting a Brahmana lady, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">all women can drink liquors beginning with the third one i.e. Kaira (coconut palm juice, and prepared from honey and molasses)</span>. A widow, a virgin and a woman in her monthly period shall avoid drinking liquor. If a woman drinks liquor out of covetousness and not in the company of her husband, she is called Unmadini (a mad woman). One should avoid her like a Candala woman. The ratio of drinking liquors in the case of four castes beginning with the Brahmanas shall be ten to eight or six to four. In the case of women it shall be half of the above. If they drink in the company of their husbands it shall be one-fourth of the above. After drinking liquor out of delusion, a Brahmana should perform Krcchracandrayana expiation. Or he shall repeat Gayatri Mantra or Jatavedasa Mantra ten thousand times. If a man repeats Ambikahrdaya Mantra he shall become pure. A Ksatriya among the three castes shall be purified by repeating those Mantras half the number of times. In the case of women the number of repetitions shall be one-fourth or they can get the same done through Brahmanas. One should repeat the Mantras a thousand times under water and become purified thereby. Laksmi, Sarasvati, Gauri, Candika, Tripura, Ambika, Vaisnavi, Bhairavi, Kali and Mahendri are the mothers. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">There are other Sakti goddesses. In worshipping them the liquor prepared from honey is approved of</span>. A Brahmana who has mastered the Vedangas shall perform worship without wine &#8230;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The base fellow who drinks liquor without worshipping Para Sakti </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">shall stay in hell called Raurava for a period calculated at the rate of a year for every d</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">r</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">op so consumed</span>.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Brahmins were not always barred from quaffing wine, in the Vedic period Kshatriyas and even Brahmins enjoyed wine especially after mixing it with Soma,</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 19.5 <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Soma with Wine, pressed</span>; filtered for the banquet, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">cleanses priest, noble</span>, brilliancy and vigour. God, with the Bright give Deities enjoyment: give food with flavour to the Sacrificer.</p>
<p>Following is the Sanskrit text with Hindi translation by Swami Karpatri Maharaj,</p>

<p>In the consecration ceremony (Rajasuya?) of the king mentioned in Aitareya Brahmana, the king is required to drink Sura (liquor) along with Soma which is given by the Brahmin priest,</p>
<p>Aitareya Brahmana, Book 8 , Chapter 2, Para 8 &#8220;&#8230;The spirituous liquor represents the Kshattra, and further, the juice in the food; thus both the Kshattra and the juice in the food, are placed in him&#8230;Now he gives into his hand a goblet of spirituous liquor, under the recital of the verse, svadishthaya madishthaya, (9.1.1) i.e. &#8216;Purify, O Soma! with thy sweetest most exhilarating drops (the sacrificer), thou who art squeezed for Indra, to be drunk by him.&#8217; After having put the spirituous liquor into his hand, the priest repeats a propitiatory mantra (which runs thus): <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">&#8216;To either of you (spirituous liquor and Soma!) a separate residence has been prepared, and allotted by the gods. Do not mix with one another in the highest heaven; liquor! thou art powerful; Soma! thou art a king. Do not harm him (the king)! may either go to his own place</span>.&#8217; (Here is said), that the drinking of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Soma and that of liquor, exclude one another (they are not to be mixed). After having drunk it</span>&#8230;Thus he finally places the liquor in his friend (gives him a share in it).” Tr. Martin Haug</p>
<p>Underlined sentences of the above passage are an elaboration of the following Yajur Veda verse,</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 19.7 For each of you is made a God-appointed place: so grant to me a portion in the highest sphere. Surâ the strong art thou. This here is Soma. Entering thine own place do me no mischief.</p>
<p>Following is the Sanskrit text along with the Hindi translation of Swami Karpatri Maharaj</p>

<p>Now, those who cry “fake translation” has no way to escape, Aitareya Brahmana attests Yajur Veda verse. Chapter 20 of Aitareya Brahmana deals with the pouring of various liquids over the king&#8217;s head by the priest and also deals with drinking liquor. By means of Mantra the liquor was transformed into real Soma which is then drunk by the king,</p>
<p>Aitareya Brahmana, Book 8, chapter 4, Para 20 &#8220;&#8230;Then the priest gives into his hands a goblet filled with spirituous liquor, repeating the mantra, svadishthaya. He then should drink the remainder (after previous libations to the gods)&#8230;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Soma beverage which is (in a mystical way) contained in the spirituous liquor, is thus drunk by the king</span>, who is inaugurated by means of Indra&#8217;s inauguration ceremony (the ceremony just described)&#8230;The drinking of spirituous liquor, or Soma, or the enjoyment of some other exquisite food, affects the body of the Kshattriya who is inaugurated by means of Indra&#8217;s great inauguration ceremony&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Martin Haug</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti prohibits all forms of wine for a Brahmin but permits certain types of liquor for Kshatriya and Vaishya,</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti 22.82-84 Distilled from sugar, or from the blossoms of the Madhûka. (Mâdhvi wine], or from flour: these three kinds of spirituous liquor have to be discerned; as one, so are all: none of them must be tasted by the twice-born. Again, distilled from the blossoms of the Madhûka tree (Madhûka wine), from molasses, from the fruits of the Tanka (or Kapittha tree), of the jujube tree, of the Khargûra tree, or of the breadfruit tree, from wine-grapes, from Madhûka blossoms (Mâdhvîka wine), Maireya, and the sap of the cocoanut tree: <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">These ten intoxicating drinks are unclean for a Brâhmana; but a Kshatriya and a Vaisya commit no wrong in touching (or drinking) them</span>.</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 5.56 There is no sin in eating meat, in (drinking) spirituous liquor, and in <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">carnal intercourse, for that is the natural way of created beings</span>, but abstention brings great rewards</p>
<p>Acharya Medhatithi writes on this verse that drinking wine is permissible for Kshatriyas. Arthashastra of Kautilya (Chanakya) allows the sale, purchase and drinking of liquor, it brings liquor manufacturers and shops under state regulation, an entire chapter is dedicated to it,</p>
<p>Kautilya’s Arthashastra, Book 2, chapter 25 “BY employing such men as are acquainted with the manufacture of liquor and ferments (kinva), the Superintendent of Liquor shall carry on liquor-traffic not only in forts and country parts, but also in camps. In accordance with the requirements of demand and supply (krayavikrayavasena) he may either centralize or decentralize the sale of liquor. A fine of 600 panas shall be imposed on all offenders other than those who are manufacturers, purchasers, or sellers in liquor-traffic. Liquor shall not be taken out of villages, nor shall liquor shops be close to each other. Lest workmen spoil the work in hand, and Aryas violate their decency and virtuous character, and lest firebrands commit indiscreet acts, liquor shall be sold to persons of well known character in such small quantities as one-fourth or half-a-kudumba, one kudumba, half-a-prastha, or one prastha. Those who are well known and of pure character may take liquor out of shop. Or all may be compelled to drink liquor within the shops and not allowed to stir out at once in view of detecting articles such as sealed deposits, unsealed deposits, commodities given for repair, stolen articles, and the like which the customer&#8217;s may have acquired by foul means. When they are found to possess gold and other articles not their own, the superintendent shall contrive to cause them to be arrested outside the shop. Likewise those who are too extravagant or spend beyond their income shall be arrested. No fresh liquor other than bad liquor shall be sold below its price. Bad liquor may be sold elsewhere or given to slaves or workmen in lieu of wages; or it may form the drink of beasts for draught or the subsistence of hogs. Liquor shops shall contain many rooms provided with beds and seats kept apart. The drinking room shall contain scents, garlands of flowers, water, and other comfortable things suitable to the varying seasons. Spies stationed in the shops shall ascertain whether the expenditure incurred by customers in the shop is ordinary or extraordinary and also whether there are any strangers. They shall also ascertain the value of the dress, ornaments, and gold of the customers lying there under intoxication. When customers under intoxication lose any of their things, the merchants of the shop shall not only make good the loss, but also pay an equivalent fine. Merchants seated in half-closed rooms shall observe the appearance of local and foreign customers who, in real or false guise of Aryas lie down in intoxication along with their beautiful mistresses. Of various kinds of liquor such as medaka, prasanna, ásava, arista, maireya, and madhu:&#8211; Medaka is manufactured with one drona of water, half, an ádaka of rice, and three prastha of kinva (ferment). Twelve ádhakas of flour (pishta), five prasthas of kinva (ferment), with the addition of spices (játisambhára) together with the bark and fruits of putraká (a species of tree) constitute prasanná. One-hundred palas of kapittha (Feronia Elephantum) 500 palas of phánita (sugar), and one prastha of honey (madhu) form ásava. With an increase of one-quarter of the above ingredients, a superior kind of ásava is manufactured; and when the same ingredients are lessened to the extent of one-quarter each, it becomes of an inferior quality. The preparation of various kinds of arishta for various diseases are to be learnt from physicians. A sour gruel or decoction of the bark of meshasringi (a kind of poison) mixed with jaggery (guda) and with the powder of long pepper and black pepper or with the powder of triphala (1 Terminalia Chebula, 2 Terminalia Bellerica, and 3 Phyllanthus Emblica) forms Maireya. To all kinds of liquor mixed with jaggery, the powder of triphala is always added. The juice of grapes is termed madhu. Its own native place (svadesa) is the commentary on such of its various forms as kápisáyana and hárahúraka. One drona of either boiled or unboiled paste of másha (Phraseolus Radiatus), three parts more of rice, and one karsha of morata (Alangium Hexapetalum) and the like form kinva (ferment). In the manufacture of medaka and prasanna, five karshas of the powder of (each of páthá (Clypea Hermandifolio), lodhra (Symplocos Racemosa), tejovati (Piper Chaba), eláváluka (Solanum Melongena) honey, the juice of grapes (madhurasa), priyangu (panic seeds), dáruharidra (a species of turmeric) black pepper and long pepper are added as sambhára, requisite spices. The decoction of madhúka (Bassia Latifolia) mixed with granulated sugar (katasarkará), when added to prasanna, gives it a pleasing colour. The requisite quantity of spices to be added to ásava is one karshá of the powder of each of chocha (bark of cinnamon), chitraka (Plumbago Zeylanica), vilanga, and gajapippalí (Scindapsus Officinalis), and two karshas of the powder of each of kramuka (betel nut), madhúka (Bassia Latifolia), mustá (Cyprus Rotundus), and lodhra (Symlocos Racemosa). The addition of one-tenth of the above ingredients (i.e., chocha, kramuka, etc.), is (termed) bíjabandha. The same ingredients as are added to prasanná are also added to white liquor (svetasurá). The liquor that is manufactured from mango fruits (sahakárasurá) may contain a greater proportion of mango essence (rasottara), or of spices (bíjottara). It is called mahásura when it contains sambhára (spices as described above). When a handful (antarnakho mushtih, i.e., so much as can be held in the hand, the fingers being so bent that the nails cannot be seen) of the powder of granulated sugar dissolved in the decoction of moratá (Alangium Hexapetalum), palása (Butea Frondosa), dattúra (Dattura Fastuosa), karanja (Robinia Mitis), meshasringa (a kind of poison) and the bark of milky trees (kshiravriksha) mixed with one-half of the paste formed by combining the powders of lodhra (Symplocos Racemosa), chitraka (Plumbago Zeylanica), vilanga, páthá (clypea Hermandifolia), mustá (cyprus Rotundus), kaláya (leguminous seeds), dáruharidra (Amonum Xanthorrhizon), indívara (blue lotus), satapushpa (Anethum Sowa), apámárga (Achyranthes Aspera) saptaparna (Echites Scholaris), and nimba (Nimba Melia) is added to (even) a kumbha of liquor payable by the king, it renders it very pleasant. Five palas of phánita (sugar) are added to the above in order to increase its flavour. On special occasions (krityeshu), people (kutumbinah, i.e., families) shall be allowed to manufacture white liquor (svetasura), arishta for use in diseases, and other kinds of liquor. On the occasions of festivals, fairs (samája), and pilgrimage, right of manufacture of liquor for four days (chaturahassaurikah) shall be allowed. The Superintendent shall collect the daily fines (daivasikamatyayam, i.e., license fees) from those who on these occasions are permitted to manufacture liquor. Women and children shall collect ‘sura,’ and ‘kinva,’ ‘ferment.’ Those who deal with liquor other than that of the king shall pay five percent as toll. With regard to sura, medaka, arishta, wine, phalámla (acid drinks prepared from fruits), and ámlasídhu (spirit distilled from molasses):&#8211; Having ascertained the day&#8217;s sale of the above kinds of liquor, the difference of royal and public measures (mánavyáji), and the excessive amount of sale proceeds realised thereby, the Superintendent shall fix the amount of compensation (vaidharana) due to the king (from local or foreign merchants for entailing loss on the king&#8217;s liquor traffic) and shall always adopt the best course.” Tr. R. Shamasastry</p>

<p>Rig Veda mentions a miracle by Ashwins who drew a hundred jars of wine from the hoof of their horse,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.116.7 O heroes, ye gave wisdom to Kakshivan who sprang from Parjra&#8217;s line, who sang your praises. Ye poured forth from the hoof of your strong charger a hundred jars of wine as from a strainer.</p>
<p>Following is the Sanskrit text with Hindi translation by Pandit Ram Govind Trivedi,<br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="581" height="250" class="wp-image-8900 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Picture-7-581w250h.jpeg" alt="rv 1.116.7" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Picture-7-581w250h.jpeg 581w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Picture-7-581w250h-300x129.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 581px) 100vw, 581px" /></p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana 12:7:3:88. There are both milk and Surâ-liquor; for milk is Soma, and the Surâ-liquor food: through the milk he secures the Soma-drink, and through the Surâ-liquor food. And milk is the nobility (chieftaincy), and Surâ-liquor the peasantry (clan); the milk he purifies after purifying the Surâ-liquor: he thus produces the nobility from out of the peasantry, for the nobility is produced from out of the peasantry.</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana also mentions Parishrut (spelt Parisrut) a type of liquor different from Sura,</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana 12:9:1:11. Verily, from this sacrifice the man is born and whatever food a man consumes in this world, that (food), in return, consumes him in yonder world. Now this sacrifice is performed by means of spirituous liquor, and spirituous liquor (parisrut is not to be consumed by a Brâhmana: he thus is born from that which is not (to be) consumed, and the food does not, in return, consume him in yonder world. Therefore this (sacrifice), the Sautrâmanî, is a Brâhmana&#8217;s sacrifice.</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana 5:1:2:14 …and the Parisrut-liquor is neither Soma nor Sura: this is why he buys the Parisrut for a piece of lead from a long haired man.</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana 5.5.4.19 &#8220;&#8230;Let him therefore rather throw them into the fermented liquor (Parisrut)&#8230;let him therefore throw it rather into the spirituous liquor.</p>

<h1>Soma</h1>
<p>Soma plant finds frequent mention in the Vedas. It was of great importance in the Vedic religion. Soma plant is said to have stems and leaves and used to grow in the mountains, Soma plant as a whole, as well as Soma Ras (juice), are also called Andhas. Soma the mythical plant is extinct. Let’s not discuss its botanical features since this article deals with only intoxication in Hinduism. Soma drink was prepared from the leaves of Soma plant by pressing them between stones. It was mixed with water, milk, curd and a few other edible things probably to lessen its intoxicating effect. As per Nirukta 11.2 the word Soma is derived from the root &#8220;Su&#8221; which means &#8220;To Press.&#8221; As per Nirukta 1.11 the word Sura (liquor prepared from grains) is also derived from the root &#8220;Su&#8221; which means &#8220;To press.&#8221; Both the words Sura and Soma are derived from the same root. Before we begin let’s have a look at what prominent Hindu scholars said about Soma,</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">VIEWS OF SCHOLARS</span></strong></p>
<p>Swami Vikvekananda the founder of Ramakrishna Mission wrote,</p>
<p>“And they had a popular plant called Soma. What plant it was nobody knows now; it has entirely disappeared, but from the books we gather that, when crushed, it produced a sort of milky juice, and that was fermented; and it can also be gathered that this <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">fermented Soma juice was intoxicating</span>. This also they offered to Indra and the other gods, and they also drank it themselves. Sometimes they drank a little too much, and so did the gods. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Indra on occasions got drunk</span>. There are passages to show that Indra at one time drank so much of this Soma juice that he talked irrelevant words.” <strong>The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda/Volume 1/Lectures And Discourses/Vedic Religious Ideals</strong><br />

<p>Sri Aurobindo the founder of Sir Aurobindo Ashram wrote,</p>
<p>&#8220;Soma is the Lord of the wine of delight, the wine of immortality. Like Agni he is found in the plants, the growths of earth, and in the waters. The Soma-wine used in the external sacrifice is the symbol of this wine of delight. It is pressed out by the pressing-stone (adri, gravan) which has a close symbolic connection with the thunderbolt, the formed electric force of Indra also called adri&#8230;&#8221; <strong>The Secret of the Veda, p.354, by Sri Aurobindo, Published by SriAurobindoAshram Publication Dept, 2003</strong></p>
<p>Swami Prabhupada the founder of ISKCON is of the same view that Soma was an intoxicating drink, however, he is also of the view that SomRas was not an ordinary intoxicating liquor, it was a special intoxicating liquor made for the gods. He wrote,</p>
<p>“…The demigods are accustomed to drinking the soma-rasa beverage, and therefore the drinking of wine and intoxication are not unknown to them…” <strong>Swami Prabhupada on Srimad Bhagavatam 1.15.34</strong><br />

<p>Dr. B.R Ambedkar the first Law Minister of India wrote,</p>
<p>“Drinking was another evil which was rampant among the Aryans. Liquors were of two sorts Soma and Sura. Soma was a sacrificial wine. The drinking of the Soma was in the beginning permitted only to Brahmins, Kshatriyas and Vaishyas. Subsequently it was permitted only to Brahmins and Kshatriyas. The Vaishyas were excluded from it and the Shudras were never permitted to taste it. Its manufacture was a secret known only to the Brahmins. Sura was open to all and was drunk by all. The Brahmins also drank Sura. Shukracharya the priest to the Asuras drank so heavily that in his drunken state he gave the life giving Mantra known to him only and with which he used to revive the Asuras killed by the Devas—to Katch the son of Brahaspati who was the priest of the Devas. The Mahabharat mentions an occasion when both Krishna and Arjuna were dead drunk. That shows that the best among the Aryan Society were not only not free from the drink habit but that they drank heavily. The most shameful part of it was that even the Aryan women were addicted to drink. For instance Sudeshna the wife of King Virat tells her maid Sairandhri to go to Kichaka’s palace and bring Sura as she was dying to have a drink. It is not to be supposed that only queens indulged in drinking. The habit of drinking was common among women of all classes and even Brahmin women were not free from it. That liquor and dancing was indulged in by the Aryan women is clear from the Kausitaki Grihya Sutra I. 11-12, which says; “Four or eight women who are not widowed, after having been regaled with wine and food are to dance for four times on the night previous to the wedding ceremony.” men, not to speak of women of the lower Varnas, as late as the seventh and eighth centuries- A.D. in the Central region of Aryavarta, is clear from Kumarila Bhatta’s Tantra- Vartika I (iii). 4, which states, “Among the people of modern days we find the Brahmin women of the countries of Ahicchatra and Mathura to be addicted to drinking”. Kumarila condemned the practice in the case of Brahmins only, but not of Kshatriyas and Vaishyas men and women, if the liquor was distilled from fruits or flowers (Madhavi), and Molasses (Gaudi) and not from grains (Sura).” <strong>Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Writings and Speeches, Vol 3, page 154-5 </strong><a href="https://mea.gov.in/images/attach/amb/volume_03.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">https://mea.gov.in/images/attach/amb/volume_03.pdf<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SOMA RAS</span></strong></p>
<p>As you may know, Aryan’s Vedic religion shares many similarities with the Zoroastrians. One of them is Soma plant. Soma in Zoroastrianism is known as Haoma. In the Zoroastrian text Yasna, Haoma (Soma) is considered a mildly intoxicant drink with no harm.</p>
<p>Yasna 10.8 “All other toxicants go hand in hand with Rapine of the bloody spear, but H(a)oma&#8217;s stirring power goes hand in hand with friendship. [Light is the drunkenness of H(a)oma (Pâzand).] Who as a tender son caresses H(a)oma, forth to the bodies of such persons H(a)oma comes to heal.” Tr. L.H. Mills</p>
<p>In the Puranas and Mahabharat, there’s a story of King of Gaya performing a sacrifice in which Indra drank Soma Ras so much that he became intoxicated, I am mentioning all those verses here,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 5.15.12 “In Mahārāja Gaya’s sacrifices, there was a great supply of the intoxicant known as soma. King Indra used to come and become intoxicated by drinking large quantities of soma-rasa. Also, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Viṣṇu [the yajña-puruṣa] also came and personally accepted all the sacrifices offered unto Him with pure and firm devotion in the sacrificial arena.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 4.1.14-18 &#8220;There was never beheld on earth a sacrifice equal to the sacrifice of Marutta: all the implements and utensils were made of gold. Indra was intoxicated with the libations of Soma juice, and the Brahmans were enraptured with the magnificent donations they received.&#8221; Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Mahabharata 12.29.35 “While the king of Anga performed his sacrifice by the hill called Vishnupada, Indra became intoxicated with the Soma he drank, and the Brahmanas with the presents they received.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Mahabharata 1.121.9 &#8220;&#8230;while he was performing a sacrifice the gods with Indra and the great Rishis came to him, and Indra was so intoxicated with the Soma juice he drank and the Brahmanas with the large presents they received&#8230;&#8221; Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Mahabharata 3.88.6-7 &#8220;&#8230;We have heard respecting the sacrificing king Nriga that which really took place while he was performing a sacrifice in the excellent tirtha called Varaha on the Payoshni. In that sacrifice Indra became intoxicated with quaffing the Soma, and the Brahmanas, with the gifts they received&#8230;&#8221; Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Markandeya Purana 129.15-16 &#8220;Equal to Marutta never lived a sacrificer on the face of the earth at whose sacrifice his dwelling house was cast and also golden palaces as largesse, Indra was made intoxicated with Soma and twice-born brahmanas with gifts&#8230;&#8221; Tr. F. Eden Pargiter</p>
<p>Following verses from Veda calls Soma as Mada (intoxicating), I am using Hindi translation by Pandit Ram Govind Trivedi,</p>
<p>ते तवा <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">मदा</span> इन्द्र मादयन्तु शुष्मिणं तुविराधसं जरित्रे |<br />

<p>As you can see, words like Madira (मदिरा) and Mada (मद) have been used in these verses, Madira and Mada both denotes intoxication. Even those fluent in Hindi language can define these words. The word Mada (intoxication) is mentioned in connection with Soma stating that Soma is Mada (intoxicating) in numerous verses such as Rig Veda 1.85.10; 9.107.14; 1.104.9; 2.19.1; 9.12.3; 6.43.1-4; 2.14.1; 9.6.6; Rig Veda 1.84.4 which is also mentioned in Sankhayana Srauta Sutra 12.26.7; Rig Veda Mandala 2, Hymn 15 boasts deeds of Indra done in Intoxication (Mada) of Soma which is translated as rapture by Griffith; Rig Veda 8.14.7 which is elaborated in Aitareya Brahmana 6.7.</p>
<p>V.S Apte defines the word Mada as,</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="903" height="568" class="wp-image-8905 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Picture-14.jpeg" alt="Mada Sanskrit English VS Apte" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Picture-14.jpeg 903w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Picture-14-300x189.jpeg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Picture-14-768x483.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 903px) 100vw, 903px" /><br />
[<strong>The Practical Sanskrit-English Dictionary, by Vaman Shivram Apte, page 836, Published by Shiralkar &amp; Co., 1890</strong>]
<p>Arya Samaji scholar Svami Satya Prakash Sarasvati in his translation of Rig Veda defines it as,</p>
<p>Madah, intoxication; pleasure.<br />
[<strong>Rgveda Samhita, Volume III, page 881, by Svami Satya Prakash Sarasvati &amp; Satyakam Vidyalankar, Published by Veda Pratishthana</strong>]
<p>Ralph T.H. Griffith has translated it as rapture, gladdening, wild joy, etc., and the reason he gave for this is as follows. Ralph T.H Griffith commenting on Rig Veda 1.51.2 quotes Max Mueller on the word Mada (pronounced Mad),</p>
<p>&#8220;Rushing in rapture: when exhilarated by draughts of Soma. &#8216;Here again,&#8217; says Professor Max Muller, ‘The difficulty of rending Vedic though in English, or any other modern language, becomes apparent, for we have no poetical word to express a high state of mental excitement produced by drinking the intoxicating juice of the Soma or other plants, which has not something opprobrious mixed up with it, while in ancient times that state of excitement was celebrated as a blessing of the gods, as not unworthy of the gods themselves, nay, as a state in which both the warrior and the poet would perform their highest achievements. The German Rausch is the nearest approach to the Sanskrit mada.’</p>
<p>In this version, mada has generally been rendered by rapture, delight, transport, or wild joy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Griffith has mentioned Soma as liquor in the following verses like</p>
<p>Rig Veda 2.14.1 “MINISTERS, bring the Soma juice for Indra, pour forth the gladdening liquor with the beakers. To drink of this the Hero longeth ever; offer it to the Bull, for this he willeth.” Tr. Ralph T.H Griffith</p>
<p>Rig Veda 3.48.1 “SOON as the young Bull sprang into existence he longed to taste the pressed-out Soma&#8217;s liquor. Drink thou thy fill, according to thy longing, first, of the goodly mixture blent with Soma.”</p>
<p>Rig Veda 4.34.5 “Out of what substance was that chalice fashioned which ye made fourfold by your art and wisdom? Now for the gladdening draught press out the liquor, and drink, O Ṛbhus, of die meath of Soma.”</p>
<p>Rig Veda 4.44.4 “Borne on your golden car, ye omnipresent! come to this sacrifice of ours, Nāsatyas.</p>
<p>Drink of the pleasant liquor of the Soma give riches to the people who adore you.”</p>
<p>Griffith translated Rig Veda 9.32.1 as,</p>
<p>पर सोमासो मदच्युतः शरवसे नो मघोनः |<br />
सुता विदथे अक्रमुः ||</p>
<p>pra somāso madacyutaḥ śravase no maghonaḥ |<br />
sutā vidathe akramuḥ ||</p>
<p>Rig Veda 9.32.1 &#8220;The rapture-shedding Soma-drops, effused in our assembly, have Flowed forth to glorify our prince.&#8221; Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>This is elaborated in Panchavimsha Brahmana as,</p>
<p>Pancavimsa Brahmana XI.5.1 &#8220;(The verse beginning:) &#8216;Forth (has) the intoxicating madacyut) Soma&#8217; is the gayatri; intoxicating (having mada) (and) rich in sap is the afternoon service; he, thereby, puts intoxication (and) sap (in it)&#8230;&#8221; Tr. W. Caland</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">FERMENTED SOMA</span></strong></p>
<p>As far as my knowledge is concerned, Soma by itself was mildly intoxicating and was made fully intoxicating through the fermentation process. Veda and Brahmana indicate that Soma was fermented and Swami Vivekananda also mentions that Soma was fermented and that fermented juice was intoxicating. Veda, Brahmana and Srauta Sutra state that Soma was mixed with barley [Rig Veda 9.68.4; Atharva Veda 20.24.7], it was kept for three days probably for the fermentation to complete.</p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.187.9 &#8220;What Soma, we enjoy from thee in milky food or barley-brew, Vātāpi, grow thou fat thereby.” Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>Rig Veda 9.17.3 &#8220;Soma, with swelling waves, exhilarating, inebriating, flows to the straining-cloth, destroying the Rakshasas, and devoted to the gods.&#8221; Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Following verses mentions about a day or 3 days old Soma,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.45.10 &#8220;Bring with joint invocations thou, O Agni, the celestial host: Here stands the Soma, bounteous gods: drink this expressed ere yesterday.&#8221; Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>Rig Veda 3.58.7 &#8220;O Asvins, very mighty ones, with Vayu and with his steeds, one-minded, ever-youthful, Nasatyas, joying in the third day&#8217;s Soma, drink it, not hostile, very bounteous givers.&#8221; Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>There’s one more verse from Yajur Veda which talks about the fermentation of Soma, I have mentioned this in the Sautramani sacrifice, you can read Yajur Veda 19.1, Baudhayana Srauta Sutra XVII.32 and Satapatha Brahmana, Kanda 12, Adhyaya 7, Brahmana 3, Verses 5-6 mentioned above. William Scott Shelley has explained fermentation of Soma in the following way,</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p>“In the preparation of the Soma beverage, the Soma stalks were boiled [Satapatha Brahmana XII.7.3.6], and remained standing for three nights [Baudhayana Srauta Sutra XVII.32]. The Taiitriya Samhita contains the mythological justification for keeping Soma for three nights: &#8220;When the Soma was being borne away, the Gandharva Vicvavasu stole it. It was for three nights stolen; therefore after purchase the Soma is kept for three nights [Taittriya Samhita VI.1.6.4]. Referring to Sura, an alcoholic beverage produced from fermented grain, the Satapatha Brahmana states: &#8220;He distils (i.e., boils) it with a view to )its being alike) the Soma-pressing. For three nights it remains standing, for the Soma remains standing for three nights after it has been brought [Satapatha Brahmana XII.7.3.6].&#8221; The Atharva Veda also makes reference to &#8220;him that takes pains, and cooks and presses the soma [Atharva Veda XI.1.30].&#8221; According to the Vedic literature, the Soma liquor was fermented. The directions in the Soma rite include the word Parisrut, &#8220;spirituous liquor [Satapatha Brahmana XII.8.2.15],&#8221; and this is also indicated in the Rgveda by the term Vatapi, &#8220;fermenting&#8221; of the Soma liquor [Rgveda I.187.10]: &#8220;What, Soma, we enjoy from thee in milky food or barley-brew, Vatapi, grow thou fat thereby [Rgveda I.187.10].&#8221;</p>
<p>Following the fermenting of the liquor, the Soma stalks were removed from the vessel and crushed between two stones on a cowhide [Rgveda IX.65.25, IX.79.4, X.94.9], or with a mortar and pestle [Rgveda I.28.1-6, IX.46.3]. The Rgveda tells of Soma libations &#8220;fifteenfold strong [Rgveda X.27.2], and with the addition of water [Rgveda IX.75.9, IX.107.2], which diluted the mixture and caused crushed Soma stalks to swell [Rgveda VIII.9.19, IX.64.8, IX.107.12], the Soma juice was poured over the stalks upon the cowhide, and filtered through a strainer made of cloth or wool [Rgveda VIII.2.2, IX.12.4, IX.13.1]. The Soma stalks were brown (babhru), ruddy (aruna), or tawny (hari) color [Rg Veda VIII.9.19], and Soma juice was also brown [Rgveda IX.33.2, IX.63.4, 6], ruddy [Rgveda IX.45.3], or tawny [Rgveda IX.3.9, IX.98.7]. This beverage is described in the Rgveda as &#8220;good to taste and full of sweetness, verily it is strong and rich in flavour.&#8221; Indicating that the fermenting of the liquor preceeded the pressing, Soma was often drunk unmmixed [Rgveda I.135.3, V.2.3, VII.90.2, IX.72.4], or it was mixed with milk [Rgveda I.23.1, VIII.2.3, VIII.90.10, IX.11.2, 5, IX.64.28, IX.72.1, IX.101.12, IX.107.2], butter [Rgveda X.29.6], curd [I.5.5, V.51.7, VII.32.4, IX.11.6, IX.101.12], or barley [Rgveda I.187.9, III.35.3, 7, III.52.1, IX.68.4].&#8221;<br />

<h1>Cannabis</h1>
<p>In folk tradition, Shiva is often associated with cannabis, Sadhus imitates him by smoking weed. Swami Dayanand Saraswati was also <a href="/index.php/2013/09/14/the-problem-with-satyarth-prakash-dayanand-saraswati-arya-samaj/" data-wpel-link="internal">addicted to cannabis</a>. Vedas lists Bhanga (Cannabis) among the top five best herbs on the earth,</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>SCIENTIFIC ERRORS IN HINDUISM</strong></p>
<p>Written by Sulaiman Razvi</p>
<p>The Hindus claim that they were so scientifically advanced that everything was made by them. Later on the knowledge was either destroyed by Muhgals or the white people copied their ideas. As soon as something is discovered they claim that it was already mentioned in Hindu scriptures. Ironically such advanced people’s research is now limited in finding medicinal values of Cow Urine and Dung. They invented everything except for pen to note down their inventions. I will be mentioning some verses from my article <a href="http://vedkabhed.com/index.php/2014/05/14/scientific-errors-in-vedas-part-i/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Scientific Errors In Vedas<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> but without the Hindi translation as it makes the article very lengthy. This article deals with various scientific errors in Hindu scriptures including the Vedas. And I have written this according to my capability, if a scholar writes about scientific errors in Hinduism then he may find even more errors than I did. It is ridiculous to claim that Hinduism is a scientific religion, this article proves that the Rishis wrote down science of their period which is irrelevant to modern science. Some verses even start with “Scientists says” which suggests that science in Puranas was plagiarized from scientists of that time.</p>
<p>Scientific knowledge in Hindu scriptures is highly objectionable, Atharved 2.32.3 has chant to destroy pests, Atharva Veda 5.23.5 has chant to destroy worms, this is the scientific knowledge imparted by the Vedas. It is mentioned in Vishnu Purana book 5, chapter 11 that Indra was offended by the loss of his offerings, so he caused heavy rain to deluge Gokul, then Krishna held the mountain Govardhana to shelter the cowherds and their cattle. Although this can be dismissed as a miracle but the following scientific errors can’t be dismissed with the said excuse.</p>

<h1>Mountains had Wings</h1>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-6596" title="Vedic Science" src="http://vedkabhed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/word-image-2-300x220.jpeg" alt="Vedic Science" width="568" height="417" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/word-image-2-300x220.jpeg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/07/word-image-2-1024x751.jpeg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/07/word-image-2-768x563.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 568px) 100vw, 568px" /></p>
<p>Hinduism says that mountains had wings and used to fly and then Indra cut off their wings, the reason why Indra did this varies according to different Puranas, some say that their wings were becoming too large so Indra cut them off and then they became clouds, some says that Gods feared flying mountains would fall to the ground and kill</p>
<p>people so for this reason Indra cut off their wings. Mainak mountain was saved as he took shelter in Vayu Devta.</p>
<p>Valmiki Ramayana 5.1.123-5 “O son! Earlier in the Krita yuga, mountains had wings. With speed equal to that of Garuda and Vayu, they went in all directions. After that when those mountains were thus flying freely, Devas and living creatures together with sages obtained fear in the doubt that those mountains might fall down. Then the angry Devendra who performed a hundred Asvamedha rituals, cut off the wings of thousands of mountains by his weapon vajra then and there.” Tr. K.M.K Murthy</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 8.11.34 “Indra thought: Formerly, when many mountains flying in the sky with wings would fall to the ground and kill people, I cut their wings with this same thunderbolt.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 125.10-17 “…The clouds Puskarabartaka have been born from the wings (of the mountains). These wings are named Puskara and hold a huge volume of water hence these clouds are known as Puskaravarta. The valiant Indra cut down the wings of the mountains that used to fly at their will and cause ruin and destruction to the rising generation (of the universe)…” Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, Edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>Linga Purana I.54.46-48 “…The origin of the third type of clouds is from the wings of mountains chopped off by Indra.” Tr. Board of Scholars, Edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana I.2.22.41 “The wings of very powerful mountains that had increased in size and who used to go wherever as they pleased, were chopped off by Indra who wished to secure the welfare of all living beings.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Harivamsa Purana 3.40.19 “Knowing that the mountains are responsible for lack of firmness (immobility) of earth, the destroyer of strongholds (Indra), the lord, after installing the mountains at their own places, cut off their wings with his weapon, the hundred jointed (edged shataparva) Vajra.”</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.51.38 “The wings of the powerful mountains who could go as per their will and pleasure, had grown very large. Indra cut them off for the (welfare of all) living beings.” Tr. G.V. Tagare, Edited by G.P Bhatt</p>
<p>H.H. Wilson writes in the footnoes of the verse Rig Veda 2.12.2,<br />
“Yah parvatan prakupitan aramnat; the Scholiast says he quieted the mountains, going hither and thither, as long as they had wings: Indra cut them off.”</p>
<p>Swami Prabhupada also wrote,<br />
“In many descriptions in Vedic literature it is found that mountains also fly in the sky with wings. When such mountains are dead, they fall to the ground, where they stay as very large dead bodies.” <strong>Swami Prabhupada on Srimad Bhagavatam 8.11.12 </strong><br />

<p>According to Hinduism a woman conceives child after the semen mixes with her menstrual blood,</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 39.10 ”The menstrual flow of a woman suddenly develops conception as soon as it mingles itself with the semen virile of man, through the sap of the flowers of herbs.” Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, Edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>Varaha Purana 125.14 ”The generative fluid is in the female and the semen is in the male. In the womb they combine to form a being. This is due to my Maya.” Tr. Vekitasubramonia Iyer, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Following are the embryological developments mentioned in Hindu scriptures,</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana 2.3.72.42-47 “…Blood takes its origin from Rasa (a vital fluid constituent of the body) and it is said that the flesh originates from blood. The source of fat is from the flesh. It is defined that the bone originates from the fat. From the bone the pith and marrow take their origin and the origin of Semen is from the marrow. (?) Foetus originated from semen virile through its assimilative rasa bodily fluid. It is there that water is mixed initially (?). This is called the Saumya Rasi. The foetus that is solidified [lit. born of Asman, stone solid] is called the second Rasi. One should know that semen is of the nature of Soma and Menstrual blood is of the nature of fire. These two Evolutes follow Rasa…” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.14.17-22 “Then, at the time of conception, Kalana, the embryo at its first stage (in the form of a drop) is formed. In due course the Kalana develops into bubbles. Just as a lump of clay pressed by the wind in the potter’s wheel and shaped by the hands (of the potter) attains multifarious shapes, so also the foetus united with bones and impelled by the wind becomes a human body with proper forms, features and mind. The wind assembles them together. From the wind water is generated. From the water the vital breath is formed and through the vital breath the semen gets developed. Thirty three parts of blood (female contribution) and fourteen parts of the semen mixing together form only half a Pala (two karsas) and is deposited in the womb. The child in the womb is covered by the five vital breaths. From the father’s body he inherits his forms and features.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 39.14-16 “At the time of menstruation, the air draws the semen virile up, from the inside, after which it magnifies itself there; and then it develops into the embryo and assumes human or animal form (according to the kind of the womb where such development occurs)…” Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, Edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>The following excerpts from Brahma Vaivarta Purana and Skanda Purana provide details about Puranic Embryology,</p>
<p>Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Prakriti Khanda 35.121-141 “…As soon as the semen is cast into the womb it is mixed up with blood. If there is excess of blood, the issue takes the form of his mother, and if there is excess of semen, the issue takes his father’s form. The combination of the semen with the blood on even days, i.e. Sunday, Tuesday and Thursday, results in a male issue, otherwise, in a female issue…Semen and blood get united in one night. This union, followed by development from day to day. On the seventh day, the fetus takes the form of a jujube and it takes the form of a pillow in a month, the shape of a lump of flesh without hands and feet in three months and is vested with hands, legs and other members of the body in the fifth month. In the sixth month the body gets animation and consciousness, the animate body then knows the past, but like a bird in a cage, it suffers endless torments. The child in the womb occupies the most unholy place for residence, partakes of the remains of the food eaten by its mother and contemplates Hari in endless tortures. After four months of trouble the child impelled by the wind of the womb is born. But by the illusion of Hari, it forgets the past and oblivious of the quarters, time, space and the necessities…” Tr. Rajendra Nath Sen</p>
<p>Skanda Purana V.iii.159.33-53 “…when semen and blood become mixed due to the intercourse of a man and a woman, a creature is born undoubtedly…In the first month it is a phlegmatic mass with the full complement of the body ingredients. In the second month it is a lump of flesh; in the third it gets equipped with sense organs. From the element of ether it derives lightness, subtlety, sound, power of hearing, strength etc. From air the Atman obtains sense of touch, movement, digestive power and roughness. From fiery element the sense of vision, warmth, digestive capacity, colour, and illumination are obtained. It takes from watery elements chillness, fluidity, dampness and softness. From earth element it takes odour, sense of smell, weight and physical form. These are unborn Atman takes up in the third month and beings to throb. If the longing of a pregnant woman is not fulfilled, the foetus becomes defective. It may get ugliness or even death. Hence the woman should be kept pleased. In the fourth month the limbs get firmness. Blood begins to flow in the fifth month. Physical strength is obtained in the sixth month. Complexion is fixed and the nails and hairs grow at that time. In the seventh month, the foetus becomes endowed with consciousness and mind and the body has all the nails and hundreds of hairs. In the eighth month, the outer skin is fixed and the foetus becomes endowed with the power of memory. It is at this time that his sin pursues the foetus and the mother as well. Hence if the birth is premature and the child is born in the eighth month it dies invariably. Either in the ninth or the tenth month the child comes out naturally forced by the powerful winds at the time of delivery…Now it has its full complement of the limbs of the body. There are one hundred vulnerable joints with three hundred Asthas (bones?). There are seven skull pieces in the head created by the Self born Lord himself. O descendant of Bharata, there are three and half crores of hairs on the limbs. There are seventy two thousand Nadis (nerve vessels) fanning out.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Both these passages are contradicting each other. Hinduism believes that a woman becomes pregnant after semen mixes with her menstrual blood. Semen contains millions of sperm and a woman becomes pregnant when a sperm enters egg of the female and not when entire semen mixes with blood. Every Purana which talks about Embryology says that a woman becomes pregnant after her blood mixes with semen which is a scientific error. Foetus doesn’t take the form of a jujube in a week. The above verse from Brahma Vaivarta Purana says that foetus takes the shape of a lump of flesh without hands and feet in three months and is vested with hands and legs in the fifth month which is not correct because the foetus starts developing limbs in 8 weeks (2 months) and by 14th week (3 ½ month) the lower limbs are well developed, refer Mayo Clinic’c articles <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/prenatal-care/art-20045302?pg=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Link 1<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/fetal-development/art-20046151?pg=2" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Link 2<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>,</p>

<p>It also says that the baby “partakes of the remains of the food eaten by its mother” while the baby doesn’t eat food in the womb, it gets all nutrients from the umbilical cord. Now let’s move on to Skanda Purana. It says that in the third month the baby gets the power of hearing, whereas the baby begins to hear from the 18th week (4 ½ month), refer <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/fetal-development/art-20046151" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Mayo Clinic<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>‘s article. It also says that the baby obtains sense of movement, digestive power in the third month whereas this happens after the fourth month, Refer <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/fetal-development/art-20046151" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Mayo Clinic<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. Blood begins to flow in the 6th week and heart pumps about 100 pints of blood each day in 17th week (4 month &amp; 1 week) but Skanda Purana says that blood begins to flow in the fifth month, refer <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/fetal-development/art-20046151" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Mayo Clinic<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> and <a href="http://www.parents.com/pregnancy/stages/fetal-development/first-trimester-images-of-your-developing-baby/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Parents.com<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. Skanda Purana says that in the sixth month the baby grows hairs and nails and by seventh month it has all hairs and nails whereas baby’s fingernails starts forming in 10 weeks (2 months &amp; 2 weeks) and toenails appears in 14-15 (3 ½ months) weeks and develops in 17th week (4 months and 1 week), refer Mayo Clinic <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/prenatal-care/art-20045302?pg=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">link 1<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/fetal-development/art-20046151" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">link 2<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> and <a href="https://embryology.med.unsw.edu.au/embryology/index.php/Integumentary_System_-_Nail_Development" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">UNSW.edu.au<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. Hairs starts growing in 22 week (5 months &amp; 2 week) and gets a full head of hairs by 30th week (7 month &amp; 2 weeks), refer Mayo Clinic, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/fetal-development/art-20046151?pg=2" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">link 1<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> &amp; <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/fetal-development/art-20045997" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">link 2<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. Skanda Purana is bit correct about bones of baby but not precisely accurate, a new born baby has 270-350 bones. It says that baby’s skulll has 7 pieces whereas the skull of a baby consists of five main bones: two frontal bones, two parietal bones, and one occipital bone. These are joined by fibrous sutures, which allow movement that facilitates childbirth and brain growth, refer <a href="http://www.stanfordchildrens.org/en/topic/default?id=anatomy-of-the-newborn-skull-90-P01840" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Stanford Children’s Health<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> &amp; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fontanelle" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Wikipedia<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>.</p>
<p>Now let’s evaluate Embryology mentioned in Padma and Bhagavad Puranas,</p>
<p>Padma Purana II.66.22-38 …The semen with the blood (of the woman) would be (turned into) a foetus in a day. Then within five nights bubbles would be formed in the foetus. It takes the form of flesh in the five forms; neck, head, shoulder (s), spine and belly; so also hands and feet, the two sides, waists, and (the other parts of) the body; the limbs are produced one by one within two months. After three months, hundreds of sharp joints are produced (i.e. formed). Fingers etc. are produced (i.e. are formed) one by one in four months. After five months mouth, nose and ears are produced (i.e. formed). Within six months, the row of teeth, so also tongue and nails are formed, so also cavities in the ears are formed. So also are formed anus, penis, organ of generation and the male organ of generation. The joints which (are present) in the limbs, are formed within seven months. In the eight month the head with the entire body with limbs and with each limb clearly separated is formed. He is complete and endowed with five. Due to the power of the food of (i.e. eaten by) the mother and by the tastes of six kinds, fixed in the umbilical cord (i.e. the foetus) grows day by day.” Tr. N.A Deshpande</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 3.31.2-5 “On the first night, the sperm and ovum mix, and on the fifth night the mixture ferments into a bubble. On the tenth night it develops into a form like a plum, and after that, it gradually turns into a lump of flesh or an egg, as the case may be. In the course of a month, a head is formed, and at the end of two months the hands, feet and other limbs take shape. By the end of three months, the nails, fingers, toes, body hair, bones and skin appear, as do the organ of generation and the other apertures in the body, namely the eyes, nostrils, ears, mouth and anus. Within four months from the date of conception, the seven essential ingredients of the body, namely chyle, blood, flesh, fat, bone, marrow and semen, come into existence. At the end of five months, hunger and thirst make themselves felt, and at the end of six months, the fetus, enclosed by the amnion, begins to move on the right side of the abdomen. Deriving its nutrition from the food and drink taken by the mother, the fetus grows and remains in that abominable residence of stools and urine, which is the breeding place of all kinds of worms.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam says a head is formed in a month whereas head develops in 7<sup>th</sup> week (1 month &amp; 3 weeks) refer <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/prenatal-care/art-20045302?pg=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Mayo Clinic’s article<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. It says by the end of third month (i.e. on 3<sup>rd</sup> month) nails appear whereas baby’s fingernails starts forming in 10 weeks (2 months &amp; 2 weeks) and toenails appears in 14-15 weeks (around 3 ½ months) and develops in 17th week (4 months and 1 week), refer Mayo Clinic <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/prenatal-care/art-20045302?pg=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">link 1<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/fetal-development/art-20046151" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">link 2<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. Srimad Bhagavatam says that fingers, nostrils, toes, reproductive organ appears in third month whereas it occurs much early than that, fingers starts forming at 8<sup>th</sup> week (2 months), nostrils form at 7-8 week (around 2 months), toes forms at 9<sup>th</sup> week (2 month &amp; 1 week), genitals develops on 11<sup>th</sup> week (2 months &amp; 3 week), refer <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/prenatal-care/art-20045302?pg=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Mayo Clinic’s article<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>.</p>
<p>Now let’s evaluate Padma Purana. Padma Purana says fingers are formed in 4 months which is contrary to what is mentioned in Srimad Bhagavatam which says they are formed in 3 months but in reality this occurs much earlier than that, reference is already given above. It says after five months nose, ears are produced whereas ears starts developing much earlier than that i.e. in 8<sup>th</sup> week (2 months) and baby may begin to hear by 18<sup>th</sup> week (4 months &amp; 2 weeks), refer <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/prenatal-care/art-20045302?pg=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Link 1<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/fetal-development/art-20046151?pg=2" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Link 2<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. And nose is formed in 2<sup>nd</sup> month (week 8) refer <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/prenatal-care/art-20045302?pg=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Mayo Clinic<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. It says nails are formed in 6<sup>th</sup> month whereas baby’s fingernails starts forming in 10 weeks (2 months &amp; 2 weeks) and toenails appears in 14-15 weeks and develops in 17th week (4 months and 1 week), refer Mayo Clinic <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/prenatal-care/art-20045302?pg=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">link 1<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/fetal-development/art-20046151" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">link 2<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> and <a href="https://embryology.med.unsw.edu.au/embryology/index.php/Integumentary_System_-_Nail_Development" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">UNSW.edu.au<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. Padma Purana says that reproductive organs are formed in 6th month which is contrary to what is mentioned in Srimad Bhagavatam which says that reproductive organ is formed in 3 months which are both contradictory. Organ of generation develops on 11<sup>th</sup> week (2 months &amp; 3 week), refer <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/prenatal-care/art-20045302?pg=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Mayo Clinic’s article<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>.</p>
<p>I have checked these facts from several websites but I am quoting only Mayo Clinic because it is very reliable, readers can read about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayo_Clinic" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Mayo Clinic on Wikipedia<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. The following topic is also about Embryology in Hinduism.</p>
<p><a href="#top">top</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1><a id="post-6594-3"></a>Semen is produced?</h1>
<p>These verses even says that bone is produced from fat,</p>
<p>Brahma Purana 70.49 “Fat is produced from flesh; bone is produced from fat; marrow is generated from bone and semen is produced from marrow.” Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Also mentioned in Brahmanda Purana 2.3.72.44</p>
<p>Harivamsa Purana 1.40.48-56 “The distillate of various foods, rasa, vital-juice, produces blood, and flesh is produced from that blood; fat comes from flesh and bones from that fat; bones generate marrow and marrow generates seminal fluid, from which pregnancy occurs; hence, rasa, vital-fluid is substratum of all… Water is the primary principle of that rasa, vital-fluid, and this belongs to the soma, the moon, or, the nectarean principle of the moon, in the somatology – Greek – soma -atos ‘body’ and its formation… heat resides in the second half, say in menstrual blood… hence, the being of living beings is a compound of coolness and heatedness of the moon and fire. Thus the essence of all juice, the seminal fluid, is created by an excess of phlegm; blood is created by an excess billious matter. The seat of phlegm is the heart and the seat of bile is the navel. The heart, which is in the body, is known as the seat of the mind. The fire exists behind the cavity of the navel – jaThara agni – is none other than huta-ashana, the devourer of oblations, whose life-spirit is madhu-sUdana. Mind is known as prajApati, the phlegm as soma and the bile as agni. Thus the whole world is a commixture of heat and cold. Where a conception takes place, as is the formation of a cloud, the air enters there accompanied by the Absolute… It then creates the various limbs and nourishes them. Inside the body the vital air divides itself into five kinds of airs, namely prANa, apAna, samAna, samAna and vyAna, and gradually assumes proportions.” Tr. Desiraju Hanumant Rao</p>
<p>Vayu Purana II.35.45-46 ”From flesh fat is produced and bone is developed from fat. Pith and marrow are developed from bone and semen virile is generated from marrow; foetus is developed from semen through assimilative activity of Rasa bodily fluid (or through the activity rooted in sexual pleasure).” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p><a href="#top">top</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1><a id="post-6594-4"></a>Conceiving pregnancy at will without intercourse</h1>
<p>Hinduism says that sexual intercourse wasn’t needed to conceive birth in ancient period and offspring were begotten by flat of the will and in the succeeding Yuga women conceived pregnancies just by touch,</p>
<p>Mahabharata 12.207.38-40 “…Sexual congress, O chief of the Bharatas, was then not necessary for perpetuating the species. In those days offspring were begotten by flat of the will. In the age that followed, viz., Treta, children were begotten by touch alone. The people of that age even, O monarch, were above the necessity of sexual congress. It was in the next age, viz., Dwapara, that the practice of sexual congress originated, O king, to prevail among men. In the Kali age, O monarch, men have come to marry and live in pairs…” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Vayu Purana II.2.45 ”The creation of the earlier ones was due to thought, sight, and touch. Thenceforth, the subjects in this world were born of sexual intercourse.” Tr. G.V. Tagare, edited by G.P. Bhatt</p>
<p>Seer Urva is said to have created a son named Aurva with his mental ability,</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 175.43-44 ”…If one has the seed of asceticism within him, he can create a son from his mind…The ascetics ought to beget progeny out of the embryo created by their mind, and your address to me is bereft of dharma, and is like the speech of those who are not good. By the power of my innerself, I shall create a son, without the help of a woman, after illumining my mind with the glory of asceticism. I shall create such a son out of my soul, who would be ready to consume the creation. Afterwards the sage Urva, absorbed in his asceticism, throwing his thighs into the fire rubbed them with a kusu grass. Then the son in the form of Fire, desirous of consuming the universe, was produced from his thigh, by its own force without the help of any firewood. In such a way the fearful Aurva was begotten from the thigh of the seer Urva.” Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, Edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p><a href="#top">top</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1><a id="post-6594-5"></a>Conceiving pregnancy by drinking semen</h1>
<p>Hinduism also says that a woman can become pregnant by drinking semen. It even says that animals can become pregnant after drinking human semen,</p>
<p>Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Brahma Kanda 20.33-46 “…At that time, Menaka was passing by that way, At the sight of her thigh and breast the semen of the saint was discharged. Thereupon the woman Kalavati drank it cheerfully, went to her husband, bowed to him and told him everything about, her pregnancy…” Tr. Rajendra Nath Sen</p>
<p>Varaha Purana 95.20-21 “Finding the water fragrant (with it), Mahismati told her friends that she would drink it. She then drank the water containing the emission of the sage. As a result she conceived and in due time brought forth, a son named Mahisa, intelligent and valiant.” Tr. Venkitaasubramonia Iyer, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Skanda Purana III.iii.19.64 The semen virile of the royal sage Yupaketu fell into water. It is said that a harlot drank that water together with the semen and became pregnant” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Skanda Purana V.iii.5.27-37 “…O excellent king, Paramesthin Rudra sported about with Uma in the vast expanse of sea-like water. A splendid girl was born out of the sweat of Uma due to her delight. When Sarva’s chest pressed against the breasts of Uma, a great girl of lotus-like eyes issued forth from the sweat…” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 4.2.13-17 “Yuvanaswa had no son, at which he was deeply grieved. Whilst residing in the vicinage of the holy Munis, he inspired them with pity for his childless condition, and they instituted a religious rite to procure him progeny. One night during its performance the sages having placed a vessel of consecrated water upon the altar had retired to repose. It was past midnight, when the king awoke, exceedingly thirsty; and unwilling to disturb any of the holy inmates of the dwelling, he looked about for something to drink. In his search he came to the water in the jar, which had been sanctified and endowed with prolific efficacy by sacred texts, and he drank it. When the Munis rose, and found that the water had been drunk, they inquired who had taken it, and said, “The queen that has drunk this water shall give birth to a mighty and valiant son.” “It was I,” exclaimed the Raja, “who unwittingly drank the water!” and accordingly in the belly of Yuvanaswa was conceived a child, and it grew, and in due time it ripped open the right side of the Raja, and was born, and the Raja, did not die&#8230;&#8221; Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Animals becoming pregnant,</p>
<p>Skanda Purana III.iii.19.65 “After drinking the semen of Sage Vibhandaka together with water, a female deer became pregnant and gave birth to Rsyasrnga.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Mahabharata 1.3.17 “…The Rishi thus addressed, answered Janamejaya, ‘O Janamejaya, this my son, deep in ascetic devotions, accomplished in the study of the Vedas, and endued with the full force of my asceticism, is born of (the womb of) a she-snake that had drunk my vital fluid…” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 5.2.27-31 “…Vyasa said :– O king! Hearing thus the sweet words of Fire, Rambha quitted the hold of his hairs and said :– O Lord of the Devas! If thou art pleased, grant my desired boon that a son be born unto me, who will destroy the forces of my enemy and who will conquer the three worlds. And that son be invincible in every way by the Devas, Danavas and men, very powerful, assuming forms at will, and respected by all. The Fire [Agni] said :– O highly Fortunate! You will get your son, as you desire; therefore desist now from your attempting suicide. O highly fortunate Rambha! With any female of whichever species, you will co-habit, you will get a son, more powerful than you; there is no doubt in this. Vyasa said :– O king! Hearing thus the sweet words of the Fire as desired, Rambha, the chief of the Danavas, went, surrounded by Yaksas, to a beautiful place, adorned with picturesque sceneries; when one lovely she-buffalo, who was very maddened with passion, fell to the sight of Rambha. And he desired to have sexual intercourse with her, in preference to other women. The she-buffallo, too, gladly yielded to his purpose and Rambha had sexual intercourse with her, impelled as it were by the destiny. The she-buffalo became pregnant with his semen virile…” Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>

<h1><a id="post-6594-6"></a>Seven layers of the Skin</h1>
<p>There are three layers of the skin, 1) Epidermis, 2) Dermis and 3) Hypodermis. But according to Agni Purana there are seven layers of the skin,</p>
<p>Agni Purana 350.40-45 “The external layers of the skin, together with the one that contains blood, are seven in number.” Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>

<h1><a id="post-6594-7"></a>Seven Oceans created by the impression of King Priyavrata’s chariot’s wheel</h1>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 5.1.31 “When Priyavrata drove his chariot behind the sun, the rims of his chariot wheels created impressions that later became seven oceans, dividing the planetary system known as Bhū-maṇḍala into seven islands.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>

<p>Earth according to Vedas is four cornered,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.58.3 Thy spirit, that went far away, away to the four cornered earth…</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana says the same,</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahman 6.1.2.29 …Now this earth is four-cornered, for the quarters are her corners: hence the bricks are four-cornered; for all the bricks are after the manner of this earth.</p>

<p>Rig Veda 8.6.5 &#8220;His might is manifest, for Indra folds and unfolds both heaven and earth, as (one spreads or rolls up) a skin.&#8221; Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Rig Veda 6.8.3 “Wonderful Mitra propped the heaven and earth apart, and covered and concealed the darkness with his light. He made the two bowls part asunder like two skins. Vaiśvānara put forth all his creative power.” Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>One can Google how a hide (skin of animal) is stretched and spread. Some Puranas describes the earth as lotus shaped,</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 2.12.36 “From the waters, which are the body of Vishnu, was produced the lotus shaped earth, with its seas and mountains.” Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.34.44 “The lotus that was fashioned by Visnu grew from his umbilicus. The earth along with the forests and the trees was evolved in the shape of a lotus.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam describes the planetary system or the earth as lotus shaped and Jambudvipa (Which is supposed to where we live) in the shape of leaf of a lotus flower,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 5.16.5 “The planetary system known as Bhū-maṇḍala resembles a lotus flower, and its seven islands resemble the whorl of that flower. The length and breadth of the island known as Jambūdvīpa, which is situated in the middle of the whorl, are one million yojanas [eight million miles]. Jambūdvīpa is round like the leaf of a lotus flower.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Markandeya Purana 156.22 also mentions Earth as a lotus. Puranas says that Vishnu flattened the Earth,</p>
<p>Padma Purana 1.3.55 “The beginningless supreme being, then having flattened the earth, piled the mountains on it according to (its) divisions.” Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 1.4.45-48 “The supreme being thus eulogized, upholding the earth, raised it quickly, and placed it on the summit of the ocean, where it floats like a mighty vessel, and from its expansive surface does not sink beneath the waters. Then, having levelled the earth, the great eternal deity divided it into portions, by mountains…” Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Kurma Purana I.6.25 “He levelled the earth and gathered the mountains together on it…” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Shiva Purana VayaviyaSamhita 7, Section I.11.34-35; Vayu Purana I.6.27 “The Boar brought the earth to its own place. It then assumed his natural form and fixed it there. He levelled the earth, fixed the mountains and set up the four worlds on the earth as before.” Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Veda says that the Earth is stretched or spread out. Hindus often uses such verses against other religions, wondering what they will have to say about these,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 3.6.5 Great are the deeds of thee, the Great, O Agni: thou by thy power hast spread out earth and heaven.</p>

<p>Some translates words like Gau, Bhu Mandala as globe which is misleading, they try to insert their own definitions while according to Hinduism, the Earth is four-cornered, lotus shaped, shaped like a leaf of a lotus flower etc, but the idea of Earth as a flat circular disk is emphasised in the Puranas. Puranas describes the earth as a flat disc of enormous size. In its centre was Mount Meru, round which sun, moon and stars revolved. Around Meru were continents or regions (Dvipa), separated from the central peak by oceans, and named according to the great trees which stood on their shores opposite Meru. According to some Puranas there are Saptadvipas (four regions/continents/islands) in the world and as per some there are Chaturdvipa (four Dvipas) including Jambduvipa. Below the earth are seven levels of hell and above the earth is heaven, the earth is established on waters. This is the description of earth given in Hindu scriptures. The verses are not clear, but if you search Jambudvipa on Google then you will find stuff related to Earth as a Flat Circular disc also if you imagine the Earth as described in Puranas then you will get a flat circular earth.</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 2.2.4-36 “PARÁŚARA.–You shall hear, Maitreya, a brief account of the earth from me: a full detail I could not give you in a century. The seven great insular continents are Jambu, Plaksha, Sálmali, Kuśa, Krauncha, Śáka, and Pushkara: and they are surrounded severally by seven great seas; the sea of salt water (Lavańa), of sugar-cane juice (Ikshu), of wine (Surá), of clarified butter (Sarpi), of curds (Dadhi), of milk (Dugdha), and of fresh water (Jala). Jambu-dwípa is in the centre of all these: and in the centre of this continent is the golden mountain Meru…The capital of Brahma is enclosed by the river Ganges, which, issuing from the foot of Vishńu, and washing the lunar orb, falls here from the skies…” Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Agni Purana 212.33-35 “…Obeisance to the mount Meru, the representative of Vishnu on earth. Salutation unto the mountain which forms the main stay of the earth. I make obeisance to the mountain situate at the centre of the earth…” Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Harivamsha Purana 3.34.4 “Containing the earth within four boundaries, the Lord created the great ocean. At the centre of the earth, the golden mountain, meru was installed.” Tr. Desiraju Hanumanta Rao</p>
<p>Padma Purana VII.2.10-17 “…At the centre of the earth he produced the great mountain (viz. Meru) with jewelled peaks…” Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana I.2.21.13-16 “…The extent of the earth towards all the sides (quarters) from the middle of the Meru is remembered as one crore and eightynine lakhs (of Yojanas)…” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 2.4.87-93 “…In this manner the seven island continents are encompassed successively by the seven oceans, and each ocean and continent is respectively of twice the extent of that which precedes it…” Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Following verses shows that Mount Meru is in the middle of the earth with land surrounding it and the land is separated by oceans,</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.34.37 “From the unmanifest the great lotus of the earth is evolved. Its pericarp is the four-cornered Meru that is five times great.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 123.27-28 “Thus the seven dvipas are surrounded by the seven oceans…” Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, Edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>Linga Purana I.46.1 “The Earth consists of seven continents. It is full of rivers and mountains. It is surrounded by seven oceans all round and embellished by them.” Tr. Board of Scholars, Edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.34.46 “The four famous great continents are stationed on the petals. The powerful Meru is stationed on the pericarp.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Similar thing is mentioned in Mahabharata,</p>
<p>Mahabharata 6.6.18-21 “Besides Meru are situated, O lord, these four islands, viz., Bhadraswa, and Ketumala, and Jamvudwipa otherwise called Bharata, and Uttar-Kuru which is the abode of persons who have achieved the merit of righteousness. The bird Sumukha, the son of Suparna, beholding that all the birds on Meru were of golden plumage, reflected that he should leave that mountain inasmuch as there was no difference between the good, middling, and bad birds. The foremost of luminaries, the sun, always circumambulates Meru” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.34.56 “That Meru, the purifier of living beings, is encircled by worlds. Four islands are established on its different sides.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.50.68-70 “The entire earth is known as fifty crores (of Yojanas) in extent. From the middle of Meru on all four sides is half of it. Half the extent of the earth is stated in terms of Yojanas. The extent of the earth towards all the sides (quarters) from the middle of Meru is said to be eleven crores and eighty nine lakhs (of Yojanas) and fifty thousand.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana I.2.15.12-13 “Jambudvipa is immense and glorious with huge zones all round. It is encircled by nine worlds that evolve a number of living beings. It is surrounded on all sides by the briny sea the extent of which is equal to that of Jambudvipa itself.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Padma Purana 1.19.166-171 &#8220;&#8230;O you creator of the worlds, you are the protector and creator of us and (also) of the worlds. This flat world will be elevated by your favour&#8230;&#8221; Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p>The above verse mentions Vishnu’s boar avatar Varaha lifting up the “Flat world”, almost all ancient Hindu temples depict Varaha holding personified earth or Bhudevi and not flat or spherical earth. Many Hindus have falsely presented idols of Varaha from the 21<sup>st</sup> century as ancient ones where Varaha is depicted as holding up spherical earth, but all those false information has been debunked <a href="https://www.vishvasnews.com/english/viral/fact-check-this-varaha-statue-is-not-thousand-years-old-viral-claim-is-misleading/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">here<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. However, there are plenty of pictures from the medieval period depicting Varaha holding up flat earth. Though there are many pictures from the 17<sup>th</sup> to 19<sup>th</sup> century, I am reproducing a few pictures here,</p>

Idol of Varaha depicts it holding flat earth by its tusks at Adi Varaha Temple, Mathura. Though the date of this idol is unknown, it is believed to be the oldest Varaha temple. And finds mention in Varaha Purana chapter 163 stating that the idol was created by Sage Kapila.</p>

<h1><a id="post-6594-9"></a>Earth is immovable</h1>
<p>There are chapters in Puranas about movements of planets. It mentions revolution of all planets of our solar system like Venus, Mercury, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn and even satellite and star like Moon and Sun but nowhere mentions the movement of the Earth. Which proves that the Earth according to Hinduism is stationary.</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana 2.3.52.8 &#8220;The earth overwhelmed by the ocean began to quake though its name is Acala (immovable). There was a break and hindrance in the penance and abstract meditation of the ascetics.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Mahabharata, Anushasana Parva 12, Section 62, verse 2 &#8220;Bhishma said, &#8216;Of all kinds of gifts, the gift of earth has been said to be the first (in point of merit). Earth is immovable and indestructible&#8230;&#8221; Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Vamana Purana 8.26 &#8220;I bow down to the Worshipful Lord Visnu who raised the immovable earth with one single tusk, who sustains everything, and who sleeps absorbing the entire universe in Him.&#8221; Tr. Ananada Swarup Gupta</p>
<p>Mahabharata 13.62.2 “…Earth is immovable and indestructible…” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Mahabharata 5.76.7-8 “Behold, O Krishna, these the firmament and the earth which are immovable, immense, and infinite, and which are the refuge of, and in which are born these countless creatures.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.35.11; Linga Purana I.49.25b-27 “Meru has four great ranges (legs) in all the four quarters. Held by them, the earth with her seven continents does not move.” Tr. G.V. tagare</p>
<p>Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Krishna Janma Khanda 87.99-104 …Vrinda, so saying, remained there like the immoveable earth….” Tr. Various Sanskrit Scholars, Edited by B.D. Basu.</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 6.44.1 “The heavens have stood still, the earth has stood still, all creatures have stood still. The trees that sleep erect have stood still: may this disease of thine stand still!” Tr. Maurice Bloomfield</p>

<p>Brahmanda Purana 1.2.21.87-88 “Everyday the sun traverses those (zones) in due order. Just as the outer rim of the potter’s wheel comes back quickly (i.e. revolves), so also the sun functions quickly during his Souther transit. Hence, he traverses a major portion of the Earth in the course of a shorter period.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana I.2.23.44-45 “Thus the sun traverses the quarters by means of his swift chariot with one wheel. The horses are splendid but they do not have the usual place (? Akramaih). In the course of a day and night, the sun traverses the earth consisting of the seven continents and oceans by means of his chariot with a single wheel.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 126.41-46 “The Sun in course of one single day and night goes swiftly over the world consisting of the seven oceans and the seven islands, seating in His one-wheeled chariot and drawn by seven horses. The seven horses yoked to the Sun’s chariot are no other than the seven chhandas metres); they can assume forms at their will; they go as they like…Ascending on such a chariot the Sun travels the earth in course of one day (24 hours.) The horses were yoked at the beginning of Kalpa and carry on the Sun toll the end of the Great Dissolution (Maha Pralaya). Thus He goes on round and round, day and night, surrounded by the Valakhillya Munis…” Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, Edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 128.71-73 “The Sun moves lowest down of all the planets. Above Him the Moon travels. The stars travel above the Moon; above Moon, travels Mercury; above Mercury, travels Venus; above Venus, travels Mars; above Mars, travels Jupiter; above Jupiter, travels Saturn.” Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, Edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.52.43-44 “Thus the Sun moves ahead quickly in his celestial sphere by means of his single-wheeled chariot dragged by the unimpaired gentle horses. In the course of a day and night he traverses over the world of seven continents and oceans by means of his single wheeled chariot dragged by the seven horses.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.50.142 “Within a short time, therefore, the sun traverses the extensive earth. Within twelve Muhurtas it traverses quickly from the south to the north.” Tr. G.V. tagare</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana I.2.23.44-45 “Thus the sun traverses the quarters by means of his swift chariot with one wheel. The horses are splendid but they do not have the usual place (? Akramaih). In the course of a day and night, the sun traverses th earth consisting of the seven continenents and oceans by means of his chariot with a single wheel.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Linga Purana Section I.54.9-12 “…Similarly when the sucker of waters (i.e. the sun) moves about in the middle of Puskara the mountain to the north of Manasa, he traverses a thirtieth part of the earth in a Muhurta (48 mts). Understand this number in yojanas travelled in a Muhurta. The speed of the noble souled sun per Muhurta is three million one hundred and fifty thousand yojanas…” Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.50.119-121; Matsya Purana 124.40-60 “When the sun passes through the middle of the sky, it traverses one thirtieth of the diameter of the earth in a Muhurta (forty eight minutes). In regard to the distance traversed in Yojanas, know that it is three million one hundred and fifty thousand in full. This is the distance traverses by the sun in one Muhurta.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 5.22.5 “The sun-god, who is Nārāyaṇa, or Viṣṇu, the soul of all the worlds, is situated in outer space between the upper and lower portions of the universe. Passing through twelve months on the wheel of time, the sun comes in touch with twelve different signs of the zodiac…” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 5.22.7 “The sun-god has three speeds — slow, fast and moderate. The time he takes to travel entirely around the spheres of heaven, earth<br />
and space at these three speeds is referred to, by learned scholars, by the five names Saṁvatsara, Parivatsara, Iḍāvatsara, Anuvatsara and Vatsara.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana 8:7:2:5 …having once revolved round these worlds, that sun would not pass by them. Let him lay down the two last alongside the two first by reaching over them: he thus causes that sun to pass by these worlds; and hence that sun revolves incessantly round these worlds again and again (from left) to right.</p>
<p>Varaha Purana 26.8 “From its lustre arose twelve suns, and the principal one among these now revolves round the world.” Tr. Vankitasubramonia Iyer, Edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Mahabharata 6.6.7-16 “…This (the land where we are) is in the Varsha that is called after Bharata…Besides Meru are situated, O lord, these four islands, viz., Bhadraswa, and Ketumala, and Jamvudwipa otherwise called Bharata, and Uttar-Kuru…The foremost of luminaries, the sun, always circumambulates Meru, as also the moon with (his) attendant constellation, and the Wind-god too…” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Mount Meru is in the centre of the world.</p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.35.9 “The gold-handed, all-beholding luminary travels between the two regions of heaven and earth, dispels diseases, and this, verily, is known as the sun, and it finally overspreads the sky, extending from the dark interspace to the celestial region” Tr. SatyaPrakash Saraswati.</p>
<p>Nirukta 7.23 The sun having first revolved towards the northern hemisphere, a person holds a polished (piece of) white copper, or crystal, focusing the sun-rays in a place where there is some dry cow-dung, without touching it… Now (had VaisVauara been the sun), there would have occurred expressions relating to VaisVanara in those same hymns and shares which are assigned to celestial deities, i.e. Savitr, [Surya], Pusan, Visnu, and [the VisVedevas.] And they would have praised him by (attributing to him) the functions of the sun, as thou risest, thou settest, thou revolvest, &amp;c.</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 13.2.6 “Hail to thy rapid car whereon, O Sūrya, thou circlest in a moment both the limits…[44] The suppliant&#8217;s way, filling the earth, the Mighty circleth the world with eye that none deceiveth…” Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.50.60 “Revolving all round, the Sun illuminates and protects the three worlds. Hence on account of illumination and protection, he is called ‘Ravi’. The root av means ‘illumination’ (and protection.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Following verses shows movements of the Sun,</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana I.2.21.35-36 “Understand the movement of the sun during the southern transit, as he goes to that quarter. His movement is above all the guardians of the quarters. During this southern transit, the sun rushes forward like an arrow that is discharged. He revolved always, taking the circle of luminaries with him.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana 1.2.21.45-46 “The sun revolves rapidly like the whirling firebrand. Moving about, the sun traverses the revolving constellations. Thus the sun thereby moves to the south among the four quarters. The sun rises and sets again and again.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 125.50-58 …The success of the sun’s chariot is due to the conjunction (with Dhruva). Thus this divine solar chariot moves about in the heaven. The pins of the yoke and axle are on its south. The pair of reins of the yoke and the wheel of this aerial chariot revolve round and round in all directions like the potter’s wheel…</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 5.22.6 “Thus the time the sun takes to rotate through half of outer space is called an ayana, or its period of movement [in the north or in the south].” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.51.68-69 “With that the lord Sun moves quickly in the heaven. There are two reins of the chariot tied to the tips of the pole and the axle. Propelled by Dhruva the chariot moves in the sky in a circular fashion.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.50.92-93 “Understand the solar movement when the sun reaches south during the southern transit all round above the guardians of the worlds. In his transit to the south, the sun moves fast like a discharged arrow. It takes the group of luminary bodies with it and revolves always.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.50.151-4 “During the northern transit, the movement of the moon (?) is slow during day and fast during night. During the southern transit the sun’s movement is dast during day and slow during night. Dividing nights and days thus by its special diverse movements, the sun traverses the path by its even (regular) and uneven (irregular) movement.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Many verses are clearly saying that the sun travels around the earth so there is no way for apologists to defend these verses. Also read categories like Sun moves in a chariot pulled by Seven Horses, Speed of Sun moving around the Earth which proves that the Sun indeed revolves around the earth as per Hinduism.</p>

<h1><a id="post-6594-11"></a>Sun moves in a chariot pulled by seven horses</h1>
<p>Sun travelling in a horse pulled by seven horses is quite similar to Greek mythology&#8217;s Sun god <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helios" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Helios<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. Indian Prime Minister from the Hindu nationalist party said that, <a href="http://www.hindustantimes.com/india/india-can-lead-fight-against-global-warming-pm-modi/story-2IKlOQEcBApVtoKw1XCaUI.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">In our mythology we have imagined the sun god Surya riding on seven horses<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. This has basis in Hindu scriptures which says,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.50.8; 1.50.1 O, Bright sun, a chariot named harit with seven horses takes you to sky</p>
<p>Mahabharata book 13.158.20-22 …the sun possessed of a thousand rays… He it is that constitutes the wheel of the year, having three naves and seven horses to drag it…He is the sun, the dispeller of all darkness.</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 5.21.12-19 “Thus the chariot of the sun-god, which is trayimaya, or worshiped by the words om bhur bhuvah svah, travels through the four residences…My dear King, the carriage of the sun-god’s chariot is estimated to be 3,600,000 yojanas [28,800,000 miles] long and one-fourth as wide [900,000 yojanas, or 7,200,000 miles]. The chariot’s horses, which are named after Gayatri and other Vedic meters, are harnessed by Arunadeva to a yoke that is also 900,000 yojanas wide. This chariot continuously carries the sun-god. Although Arunadeva sits in front of the sun-god and is engaged in driving the chariot and controlling the horses, he looks backward toward the sun-god…My dear King, in his orbit through Bhu-mandala [Earth], the sun-god traverses a distance of 95,100,000 yojanas [760,800,000 miles] at the speed of 2,000 yojanas and two krosas [16,004 miles] in a moment.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana I.2.23.50 “…The lord of the day (i.e. the sun) thus revolves and wanders by means of horses that gallop and that are as swift as birds.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Linga Purana I.55.81-82 “Thus the sun, the harbinger of the day moves ahead quickly in a single wheeled chariot drawn by seven green imperishable horses. He whirls day and night in his chariot which has a single wheel. He traverses in heaven over the seven continents and oceans with the help of seven groups.” Tr. Board of Scholars, Edited by J.L.

<p>Devi Bhagwatam 8.15.40-45 “…The seat of the Sun on his chariot measures 36 Lakh Yoyanas wide. The Yuga measures in length one fourth of the above dimensions, that of his seat. The Chariot is moved by seven horses, consisting of the seven Chhandas, Gâyatrî, etc., driven by Aruna. The horses carry the Sun for the happiness of all. Though the charioteer sits in front of the Sun, his face is turned towards the west. He does his work as a charioteer in that state…” Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>It&#8217;s possibly inspired by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trundholm_sun_chariot" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Trundholm Sun Chariot<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> commonly found in the European mythologies. Some apologists tries to defend this by saying that seven horses mentioned here are not actually horses but seven rays. In many Hindu scriptures the Sun is described as of having a thousand rays not 7 rays and none of the Puranas or the Mahabharat explains seven horses as seven rays, so this proves that its apologists concocted explanation which has no basis. If seven horses are described as seven rays then does that mean the Moon too emits ten rays as Hindu scriptures describes moon moving in a chariot pulled by 10 horses. Sun is described in Hindu scriptures including the Vedas as of having 1000 rays not 7 rays, these 7 horses’ names are different than the names of rays of sun given in Hindu scriptures. Hindu scriptures clearly mentions that the seven horses are seven Vedic metres who have assumed the shape of horses. Some also explain it by saying that one wheel of the chariot signifies day or year, five spokes in it signifies five seasons etc. which is true to an extent but the one wheel represents year and five spokes of the chariot represents five seasons, the chariot is not a metaphor. Just as in the Tricolor (Indian flag) the saffron, white and green represents courage and sacrifice, peace and truth, and faith and chivalry respectively, the Ashoka Chakra in the middle represents the eternal wheel of law so the wheel of the chariot and its spokes too represent year and seasons in the same manner. Hindu scriptures even gives the size of Sun’s chariot, how will apologists explain that? If it is symbolic then why Hindu scriptures mentioned the size of chariot? And why do they say that Sun moves around in his chariot? Hindu scriptures also mentions chariot of moon what does it signify? Also check above topic especially Brahmanda Purana I.2.23.44-45 and Vayu Purana I.52.43-44 which clearly states about Sun revolving around the earth in a chariot pulled by horses and even has a charioteer in front. Logically speaking does the Sun rotates or revolves through rays if horses means rays? Before speaking about 7 horses of the sun, the Mahabharata verse mentions 1000 rays of the sun which makes it pretty clear that 7 horses aren’t really rays, moreover if seven horses of the sun means 7 rays of the sun then what does 10 horses of the moon means? Hindu text mentions 10 horses of the moon also, does that mean moon also emits 10 types of rays?</p>

<h1><a id="post-6594-12"></a>Even the Moon moves around the earth in a chariot pulled by horses</h1>
<p>Brahmanda Purana 1.2.23.50-51 “He is served by Gandharvas and groups of celestial damsels by means of sons and dances. The lord of the day (i.e. the sun) thus revolves and wanders by means of horses that gallop and that are as swift as birds. The chariot of Soma (the Moon) has three wheels. His horses have the lustre of Kunda (white jasmine) flowers. They are ten in number and they are yoked to the left as well as to the right. The moon traverses by means of this.” Tr. Board of Scholars, Edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.52.50-51 “The chariot of the Moon has three wheels. The horses are tied in pairs on either side. The chariot along with the horses and the charioteer has come out of the womb of the waters. The three wheels have a hundred spokes. Excellent white horses have been yoked thereto. They are ten in number. They are slender and divine. They are unimpeded and have the velocity of the mind. They are yoked but once (in the beginning of the Kalpa) and they travels till the end of the Yugas.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>

<h1><a id="post-6594-13"></a>Speed of Sun moving around the Earth</h1>
<p>Linga Purana Section I.54.9-12 “…Similarly when the sucker of waters (i.e. the sun) moves about in the middle of Puskara the mountain to the north of Manasa, he traverses a thirtieth part of the earth in a Muhurta (48 mts). Understand this number in yojanas travelled in a Muhurta. The speed of the noble souled sun per Muhurta is three million one hundred and fifty thousand yojanas…” Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.50.119-121 “When the sun passes through the middle of the sky, it traverses one thirtieth of the diameter of the earth in a Muhurta (forty eight minutes). In regard to the distance traversed in Yojanas, know that it is three million one hundred and fifty thousand in full. This is the distance traverses by the sun in one Muhurta.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>1 Muhurta = 48 minutes</p>
<p>1 Yojana = 8 miles (as per Hindu translators of Puranas)</p>
<p>3,150,000 Yojana*8 miles = 25,200,000</p>
<p>25,200,000/48 = 525,000 i.e. speed in one minute</p>
<p>525,000*60 = 31,500,000 miles per hour</p>
<p>According to modern science,<br />
“The Sun’s orbital speed around the Galaxy: ~200 km/s (720,000 km/h, 450,000 mph) The speed of the ground beneath your feet, as a result of the Earth’s rotation: 1000 km/h (600 mph) at the latitude of Sheffield (53 degrees); it goes up to 1670 km/h (1000 mph) at the equator.”<br />

<p>The orbital speed of the sun given in Vayu Purana is 31,500,000 mph and the orbital speed of the sun according to science is 450,000 mph which is nowhere close to the speed given in Puranas. Brahmanda Purana mentions a different speed, so let’s have a look at that too,</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana I.2.21.60-65 “…Thus, when the sun traverses the middle of the sky, it passes through parts of the earth in the course of a Muhurta as it were (?) Understand the number of Yojanas here in the course of a Muhurta. It is one hundred and eightyone thousand Yojanas. This is the speed of the sun in a Muhurta.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>181,000*8 = 1,448,000 miles</p>
<p>1,448,000/48 = 30,166 in a minute</p>
<p>30,166*60= 1,810,000 mph</p>
<p>This speed given is also not correct, the speed given in Srimad Bhagavata (Bhagavad Purana) is different so let’s evaluate its authenticity as well,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 5.21.12 “Thus the chariot of the sun-god, which is trayīmaya, or worshiped by the words om bhūr bhuvaḥ svaḥ, travels through the four residences mentioned above at a speed of 3,400,800 yojanas [27,206,400 miles] in a muhūrta.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>mph already given hence,</p>
<p>27,206,400/48 (1 Muhurta) = 566,800</p>
<p>566,800*60= 34,008,000 mph</p>
<p>Whereas the orbital speed of the sun is 450,000 mph.</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 5.21.19 “My dear King, in his orbit through Bhū-maṇḍala, the sun-god traverses a distance of 95,100,000 yojanas [760,800,000 miles] at the speed of 2,000 yojanas and two krośas [16,004 miles] in a moment.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>

<h1><a id="post-6594-14"></a>Moon travels faster than the Sun</h1>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 5.22.8 “Above the rays of the sunshine by a distance of 100,000 yojanas [800,000 miles] is the moon, which travels at a speed faster than that of the sun. In two lunar fortnights the moon travels through the equivalent of a saṁvatsara of the sun, in two and a quarter days it passes through a month of the sun, and in one day it passes through a fortnight of the sun.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>It says that the Moon travels faster than the Sun.</p>
<p>“The Moon orbits Earth at a speed of 2,288 miles per hour (3,683 kilometers per hour). During this time it travels a distance of 1,423,000 miles (2,290,000 kilometers).”</p>

<h1><a id="post-6594-16"></a>Moon has water</h1>
<p>Vayu Purana I.53.57 “The orb of the Moon is of solid water and the orb of the Sun is of solid refulgence.” Tr. G.V. Tagare, Edited by G.P Bhatt</p>
<p>Another Vayu Purana may be saying the same,</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.53.84-86 “Thus the abodes and their resident deities are mentioned. The abode of the thousand rayed Sun is full of fire and sparkling. The abode of the thousand rayed Moon is full of water and sparkling white. The abode of the five rayed charming planet Budha is dark in color.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Linga Purana I.52.3 “The storehouse of water in the sky which is called Soma (moon) is the support of all living beings. To Devas, it is the receptacle of nectar.” Tr. Board of Scholars, Edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana I.2.23.78-79 “The divine spheres of the sun and the moon are sparkling and white. They are of the form (or full of) of fire and water. They move about in the firmament. They resemble auspicious round pots. The sphere of the moon is remembered to be consisting of dense water. The white and brilliantly sparkling sphere of the sun is composed of dense fiery splendour.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Hinduism also says that Moon is born from waters,</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 126.48 “The Moon has been born from waters along with His chariot, horses and the charioteer. That chariot is decorated with fine garlands and yoked with excellent white horses, rests on three wheels.” Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, Edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p><a href="#top">top</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1><a id="post-6594-17"></a>How Full Moon occurs</h1>
<p>According to Hinduism, the Sun fills the moon with a nectar which lasts until 33330 Devas drinks it and turns it dark. The nectar is described as sweet like honey and consisting of the essence of the watery juice. It is the food of the Devas which makes them immortal. Seems this is the Soma Ras.</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.52.60-66 “Beginning with the second day in the dark half and ending with the fourteenth day Devas drink the watery wine, the nectar of the Moon that is essentially made up of water and that by nature consists of tasty essence. By the brilliance of the Sun the nectar is collected and prepared in the course of a fortnight. On the full moon night Devas, Pitrs and the sages attend the Moon facing the Sun. The digits being drunk decline gradually in the dark half and become refilled in the bright half. When days pass on gradually Devas drink the moon for half a month until the new moon day and go away. On the new moon day Pitrs resort to the Moon. When the fifteenth part of the digits is left over in the later part of the day, that part is used up by the groups of Pitrs. The remaining digit is drunk by Pitrs during the period of two Kalas. From the lunar rays the nectar of Svadha comes out on the new moon night. They drink the nectar and remain content for a month. They attain immortality.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 126.53-60 “…in the dark fortnight, the Moon wanes daily from the second day till the Chaturdasi tithi (the fourteenth day after the full Moon) when the Devas drink up the soft and excellent nectar of the Moon, sweet like honey and consisting of the essence of the watery juice. For half the month the nectar becomes stored up in the Moon by the Sun’s ray, so that the Devas would be able to drink it; and the quantity of this nectar becomes maximum on the full moon night when the Devas adore the Moon for another supply of the same, gathered from the Sun’s radiance in course of a fortnight.” Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, Edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 126.61-70 “…From the beginning of the dark fortnight the Moon turns black, wanes and becomes dull; His digits decline owing to His nectar being drunk up day by day. 33330 Devas drink the lunar ambrosia. The Moon thus declines during the dark fortnight and waxes until He becomes complete in the bright fortnight. Thus, drinking the nectar, the Devas, at the end of the fortnight, go away elsewhere on the Amasvasya (dark) night when the Pitris come to Him. When the still small portion of the 15th part of the Moon is left, they drink that in the afternoon on the next day for a brief period of two kalas and go away after the completion of this dark fortnight…” Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, Edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 2.12.1-9 “The radiant sun supplies the moon, when reduced by the draughts of the gods to a single Kalá, with a single ray; and in the same proportion as the ruler of the night was exhausted by the celestials, it is replenished by the sun, the plunderer of the waters: for the gods, Maitreya, drink the nectar and ambrosia accumulated in the moon during half the month, and from this being their food they are immortal. Thirty-six thousand three hundred and thirty-three divinities drink the lunar ambrosia. When two digits remain, the moon enters the orbit of the sun, and abides in the ray called Amá; whence the period is termed Amávásya. In that orbit the moon is immersed for a day and night in the water; thence it enters the branches and shoots of the trees; and thence goes to the sun.” Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>

<p>Vayu Purana I.53.61-62 “…The diameter of the Sun is nine thousand Yojanas. The girth of the Sun is three times its diameter. The width of the Moon is twice that of the Sun.”Tr. G.V. Tagare, Edited by G.P Bhatt</p>

<p>Matsya Purana 123.57-58 “The diameter of the Sun is nine thousand yojanas and its circumference is three times that (2700 yojanas). The diameter of the Moon is twice the diameter of the Sun; its circumference is thrice its diameter.” Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, edited by B.D. Basu</p>

<p>Another scientific blunder, there is no need to provide proof but still for your ease let me present the size of the sun and moon as per science,</p>
<p>Size of the Sun</p>
<p>“The sun is nearly a perfect sphere. Its equatorial diameter and its polar diameter differ by only 6.2 miles (10 km). The mean radius of the sun is 432,450 miles (696,000 kilometers), which makes its diameter about 864,938 miles (1.392 million km). You could line up 109 Earths across the face of the sun. The sun’s circumference is about 2,713,406 miles (4,366,813 km).”</p>

<p>Size of the Moon</p>
<p>“The moon’s mean radius is 1,079.6 miles (1,737.5 kilometers). Double those figures to get its diameter: 2,159.2 miles<br />
(3,475 km). The moon’s equatorial circumference is 6,783.5 miles (10,917 km).</p>
<p>The moon’s surface area is about 14.6 million square miles (38 million square kilometers), which is less than the total surface area of the continent of Asia (17.2 million sq mi or 44.5 million sq km).”</p>

<p>Both the Sun and the Moon revolves around the Earth as per Hinduism and since the moon appears bigger to the naked eye than the sun so the Rishis may have thought that moon must be bigger in size than the sun.</p>
<p>Swami Prabhupada the founder of ISKCON stated that moon is farther than the sun and also considered moon landing to be an hoax,</p>
<p>“Another my challenge is that moon is beyond the sun. First planet is sun, and then moon. So if the sun is 93,000,000 miles and moon is above the sun 1,600,000, then how they can go to the moon planet in four days? It requires seven and a half months. That is my challenge.”<br />

<p>Brahmanda Purana I.2.21.12 “…The entire Earth is remembered as fifty crores (of Yojanas) in extent.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 2.4.18 “…Such, Maitreya, is the earth, which with its continents, mountains, oceans, and exterior shell, is fifty crores (five hundred millions) of Yojanas in extent…” Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>500000000*8 = 4000000000 miles</p>
<p>And this number is nowhere close to the number proved by modern science, this number doesn’t match with either Earth’s radius or diameter.</p>
<p>“The radius of Earth at the equator is 3,963 miles (6,378 kilometers), according to NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center. However, Earth is not quite a sphere. The planet’s rotation causes it to bulge at the equator. Earth’s polar radius is 3,949 miles (6,356 km) — a difference of 14 miles (22 km).</p>
<p>Using those measurements, the equatorial circumference of Earth is about 24,900 miles (40,070 km). However, from pole-to-pole — the meridional circumference — Earth is only 24,812 miles (39,931 km) around. This shape, caused by the flattening at the poles, is called an oblate spheroid.”<br />

<p>Brahmanda Purana I.2.21.7 “The extent of the disc of the sun is nine thousand Yojanas. Its girth is three times the extent.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>The same book gives contradictory numbers, let’s evaluate both numbers,</p>
<p>9 crores of Yojanas is the circumference of the Sun as per Brahmana Purana,</p>
<p>90,000,000*8= 720,000,000 miles</p>
<p>9,45,00000*8= 756,000,000 miles</p>

<p>The numbers are again nowhere close. Also the diameter given below in Srimad Bhagavatam is inaccurate.</p>
<p>Size of the Moon,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 5.24.2 “The sun globe, which is a source of heat, extends for 10,000 yojanas [80,000 miles]. The moon extends for 20,000 yojanas [160,000 miles], and Rāhu extends for 30,000 yojanas [240,000 miles]…” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 8.18.1-9 “…So the sphere of the Moon extends upto the twelve thousand Yoyanas…” Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Diameter of Moon given in Srimad Bhagavatam</p>
<p>160,000 miles</p>
<p>Diameter of Moon given in Devi Bhagavatam</p>
<p>12,000*8= 96,000 miles</p>
<p>“The moon’s mean radius is 1,079.6 miles (1,737.5 kilometers). Double those figures to get its diameter: 2,159.2 miles<br />
(3,475 km). The moon’s equatorial circumference is 6,783.5 miles (10,917 km).<br />
The moon’s surface area is about 14.6 million square miles (38 million square kilometers), which is less than the total surface area of the continent of Asia (17.2 million sq mi or 44.5 million sq km).”<br />

<p>Size of Venus, Jupiter, Mars and Saturn. The size is given in ratios and not Yojanas and one can easily find the error in this when it says that Jupiter is less than Venus when Jupiter is the biggest planet of our solar system,</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana I.2.23.104-6; Matsya Purana 128.64-65 “The diameter and extent of the sphere of Bhargava (the Venus) it laid down as one sixteenth of that of the moon. Brhaspati (the Jupiter) should be known as one-fourth less than the Venus (i.e. three fourth of its size). The Mars and Saturn are remembered to be three fourths of Jupiter in extent. In diameter and extent, Mercury is three-fourths of either of them.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>The mean radius of moon in kilometres is 1737 divided by 16 is 108 kilometres, so Brahmanda and Matsya Purana are saying that the mean radius of Venus is 108 km when the actual mean radius of Venus is much bigger than the moon, the mean radius of Venus is 6051 km. Linga Purana gives different sizes of planets, I will just present the verse to you.</p>
<p>Linga Purana I.57.13-15 “The diameter, the circumference and the distance in yojanas of Bhargava (Venus) is a sixteenth part of that of the moon. Brhaspati (Jupiter) is of three-fourths of the size of Venus. Mars and Saturn are three-fourths of the size of Brhaspati. Budha (Mercury) is three-fourths of their size in extent and circumference.” Tr. Board of Scholars, Edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>The contradictions in these two verses proves that they were written on imaginations and whims and has no scientific basis.</p>

<h1><a id="post-6594-22"></a>What causes hoarfrost/dew drops?</h1>
<p>Hinduism says that four elephants of the four quarters spraying water from their huge trunks causes hoarfrost. Or it may be referring to a cloud who could take shape of any. But I am sure that it talks about the elephants that’s holding up the earth because the 43rd verse states that “Elephants, mountains and clouds along with serpents belong to one and the same family” had it been a type of cloud then this verse wouldn’t have separated elephants from clouds and also the Brahmanda Purana makes it more clear.</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.51.45-47 “During Hemanta (early winter) Parjanya and the elephants of the quarters born of chilliness shower snow (drops) for making the corn flourish…The elephants of the quarters spray all round drops of water from the Ganga by means of their huge trunks. That (spray of water) is called the hoarfrost.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 2.9.16-18 “…the water, although that of the Gangá of the sky, is scattered, by the elephants of the quarters, not by the rays of the sun: it is only when such rain falls, and the sun is in the even asterisms, that it is distributed by his beams.” Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana I.2.22.47-52a “Smoke is conducive to development of all of them without any distinction. The most excellent among them is Parjanya. The Elephants of the quarters are four in number (Although) these are separate, the source of origin of elephants, mountains, clouds and serpents is the same and water is remembered as that origin. On being directed to make the plants and trees flourish, Parjanya and the Diggajas (Elephants of the quarters) showers snowdrops during Hemanta (early winter), born of cool virility. …With their huge trunks, the elephants of the quarters receive the waters oozing from the Ganga and scatter them in the form of water spray. That is remembered as dew drops.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>

<h1><a id="post-6594-23"></a>Sun emits different types of rays which are responsible for changes in Season</h1>
<p>As the Earth spins on its axis, producing night and day, it also moves about the Sun in an elliptical (elongated circle) orbit that requires 365 1/4 days to complete. The Earth’s axis is tilted at 23.5 degrees and is why we have seasons. When the Earth’s axis points towards the Sun, it is summer for that hemisphere. When the Earth’s axis points away, winter can be expected.</p>
<p>But according to Vedic Science we have seasons because the sun emits different types and specific number of rays and changes them to cause different seasons.</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana 1.2.24.32-33 “During Vasanta (spring) and Grisma (summer), the sun blazes by means of three hundred rays. During the rainy season and autumn he showers (rain) by means of four hundred rays. During Hemanta (early winter) and Sisira (later winter), he scatters snow by means of three hundred rays.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Linga Purana I.59.41-45 “…The thousand rays of the sun serve the purpose of the world. Reaching the earth they assume different forms by emitting snow, rain and heat…” Tr. Board of Scholars, Edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.52.36 “In accordance with the seasons, the Sun changes his rays, releasing heat in the summer, mist and fog in the winter and rain during the rainy season and demarcates day and night. He (thus) propitiates Devas, Pitrs and human beings.” Tr. G.V. Tagare, Edited by G.P Bhatt</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.53.25-27; Linga Purana I.59.31a-31b “During the spring and the summer he blazes with the three hundred rays. During rains and autumn he generates rain by the four (hundred rays). The Sun creates mist and fog by means of the three (hundred rays) during early and late winter. He deposits energy on the medicinal herbs. By means of Svadha he propitiates Pitrs. By means of nectar of three varieties he bestows immorality. Thus thousand rays of the Sun achieve the purpose of the worlds. They differ according to the season by exuding water, chilliness and heat.” Tr. G.V. Tagare, Edited by G.P Bhatt</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 128.24-25 “During spring and hot weather the sun imparts heat by his three hundred rays; during the rainy season and autumn causes rain by his four hundred rays; during the dewy and winter season imparts cold by his three hundred rays.” Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, Edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana also says that Sun moves in medium speed to make day and night equal in Autumn and Spring seasons,</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana I.2.21.142 “During the time in between the Autumn and the Spring, the sun proceeds with a medium speed and he resorts to its eastern peak.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>

<h1><a id="post-6594-24"></a>Moon causes rain</h1>
<p>Hindu scriptures correctly says that the sun takes up the water through rays but also makes an unscientific claim that the water is transferred to moon which then sends it to clouds (perhaps to Abhra clouds) that causes rain, some also say that the cloud named Abhra doesn’t cause rainfall while Linga Purana I.54.39-40 states that Abhra means ‘that which showers water’.</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana I.2.22.13-21 “…the sun takes away the water of the entire world, O excellent Brahmanas. The moon transmits the entire water drunk by the sun. The torrential currents of water (Downpour of rain) functions through Nadis (vein like vessels) accompanied by the wind. The water that oozes out of the moon remains in the food (i.e. plants and food crops). The water that has fallen down from the moon, from the sky, is conducive to the welfare of all the worlds. The entire universe has the moon as its support. This has been truthfully recounted. The Usna (hot virility) oozes out of the sun, and the Sita (chill virility) functions from the moon.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Linga Purana Section I.54.29-33 “The waters drunk by the sun penetrates the moon gradually and from the moon they drip down to the clouds. On being tossed about by the wind, the cluster of clouds causes shower on the earth…” Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.51.14-15 “The water drunk in by the sun gets transferred to the moon from the solar fire. Through the Nadis (tubular veins) full of wind the activity of sustaining the worlds begins. What exudes from the moon, the sun receives at its tips. When the wind blows the clouds let it shower on the earth.” Tr. G.V. Tagare, Edited by G.P Bhatt</p>
<p>Aitareya Brahmana Book 8, Para 28 “…The rain having rained enters into the moon…” Tr. Arthur Berriedale Keith</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 2.9.8-18 “…The sun with his scorching rays absorbs the moisture of the earth, and with them nourishes the moon. The moon communicates, through tubes of air, its dews to the clouds, which, being composed of smoke, fire, and wind (or vapour), can retain the waters with which they are charged: they are therefore called Abhras, because their contents are not dispersed When however they are broken to pieces by the wind, then watery stores descend, bland, and freed front every impurity by the sweetening process of time…” Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Linga Purana mentions strange water cycle,</p>
<p>Linga Purana I.54.65-68 “There is neither increase nor decrease of water, if we consider it duly. The wind presided over by Dhruva withdraws the rain. It falls off the planet sun and spreads through the sphere of the stars. At the close of the movement, it re-enters the sun and is presided over by Dhruva.” Tr. Board of Scholars, Edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Dhurva means Pole Star.</p>

<h1><a id="post-6594-25"></a>Unique way to cause rain</h1>

<p>Yajur Veda 2.16 “We perform the yajna for Vasus, Rudras and Adityas…The desired oblation (Ahuti) reaches the space, comes in contact with air and the light of that sun. It thence brings down rain for us…” Tr. Devi Chand</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 3.49 “The oblation full of cooked articles put into the fire, goes up to the sky. And returns there from full of rain.” Tr. Devi Chand</p>

<h1><a id="post-6594-26"></a>What causes Earthquakes and who lifts the Earth?</h1>
<p>Valmiki Ramayana says that four elephants are holding up the earth and if the easterly elephant namely Viruupaaksha moves its trunk then earthquakes occurs on earth,</p>
<p>Valmiki Ramayana 1.40.13-22 “While digging the earth there they beheld a mountain similar easterly elephant named Viruupaaksha, which is bearing the eastern side of earth’s surface on its head. Oh, Rama, the legatee of Raghu, that great easterly elephant Viruupaaksha is bearing the entire eastern earth along with its mountains and forests on its head. On certain occasions, oh, Rama of Kakutstha, when that great-elephant moves its head desiring respite in tiresomeness then earthquakes will occur on earth. After splitting the eastern direction then they split opened the southern direction, and even in southern direction they beheld an elephant that is similar to a very great mountain, and that is sustaining southerly side of earth on its head, and on seeing that mammoth elephant of venerable character, namely Mahapadma, they went into an inordinate astonishment. Even in the westerly direction those great mighty sons of Sagara beheld an infinite and mountain similar elephant of western direction, called Sumanasa. In the northern direction, oh, Rama, they beheld Bhadra, a snow-white elephant with an auspicious body bearing northern side of this earth.” Tr. Shri Desiraju Hanumanta Rao</p>
<p>6th century Indian astronomer named Varahamihira also writes about this,</p>
<p>क्षितिकंम्पमाहुरेके बृहदन्तर्जलनिवासिसत्वकृतम् ।<br />
भूभारखिन्नदिग्गजविश्रामसमुद्भवं चान्ये ॥१॥<br />
Brihatsamhita 32.1 “Some hold that an earth-quake is caused by huge animals living in the midst of the ocean, while others opine that it is the result of the rest that is availed of by the elephants of the quarters tired by the weight of the earth.” Tr. Panditbhushan V. Subrahmanya Shastri &amp; Vidwan M. Ramkrishna Bhat</p>
<p>I quoted it to show that elephants holding up the earth is literal and not simile and this view was widely held by Hindus even in the 6th century. Vishnu Purana says that Vishnu in the form of a snake named Shesha is holding up the world and the earth trembles if he yawns,</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 2.5.20-25 “…Śesha bears the entire world, like a diadem, upon his head, and he is the foundation on which the seven Pátálas rest. His power, his glory, his form, his nature, cannot be described, cannot he comprehended by the gods themselves. Who shall recount his might, who wears this whole earth, like a garland of flowers, tinged of a purple dye by the radiance of the jewels of his crests. When Ananta, his eyes rolling with intoxication, yawns, then earth, with all her woods, and mountains, and seas, and rivers, trembles…” Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Shiva Purana says that earthquakes occurs when Shesha stretches himself,<br />
Shiva Purana, Uma Samhita 5, chapter 15, verses 18-21 “Holding the sphere of the earth on his back, Sesa, the lord of Bhutas stands at the root of Patala. He is worshipped for his endless attributes. The power of his virility cannot be adequately described even by the ambitious gods nor can his form be known…With his eyes rolling due to inebriation when Sesa stretches himself, the earth quakes along with all its mountains, oceans and forests.” Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam and Devi Bhagavatam also says that four elephants are holding up the universe,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 5.20.39 “On the top of Lokāloka Mountain are the four gaja-patis, the best of elephants, which were established in the four directions by Lord Brahmā, the supreme spiritual master of the entire universe. The names of those elephants are Ṛṣabha, Puṣkaracūḍa, Vāmana and Aparājita. They are responsible for maintaining the planetary systems of the universe.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 8.14.1-29 “…The self-born Brahmâ has placed very big elephants on all sides of it. Hear their names. These are Risabha, Puspachûda, Vâmana, and Aparâjita. These four elephants are said to hold all the Lokas in their respective positions. The Bhagavân Hari gives strength to these elephants and to Indra and others who are reckoned to be His Vibhûtis (powers)…” Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam also says that Vishnu in the form of a dolphin or Gigantic porpoise is holding up the universe or earth,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 5.23.4 “Some persons describe this system of heavenly luminaries as being supported by the mystical Yogic powers of Lord Vasudeva who has assumed the form of a Gangetic porpoise.” Tr. G.V. Tagare, Edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Mahabharata and Puranas says that a snake named Shesha is holding up the Earth and that’s the reason snakes are found in the ground,</p>
<p>Mahabharata 3.202.12-13 “…then lay in Yoga sleep on the wide hood of the Snake Sesha of immeasurable energy, and the Creator of the Universe, that highly-blessed and holy Hari, knowing no deterioration, lay on the hood of that Snake encircling the whole Earth…” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 5.25.2 “Śukadeva Gosvāmī continued: This great universe, situated on one of Lord Anantadeva’s thousands of hoods, appears just like a white mustard seed. It is infinitesimal compared to the hood of Lord Ananta.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Mahabharata describes how Adishesha held the earth, I am quoting some excerpts from the section,</p>
<p>Mahabharata1.36.17-25 “Then Sesha replied, ‘O divine Grandsire, this is the boon desired by me; viz., may my heart always delight in virtue and in blessed ascetic penances, O Lord of all!’ Brahman said, ‘O Sesha, I am exceedingly gratified with this thy self-denial and love of peace. But, at my command, let this act be done by thee for the good of my creatures. Bear thou, O Sesha, properly and well this Earth so unsteady with her mountains and forests, her seas and towns and retreats, so that she may be steady.’ Sesha said, ‘O divine Lord of all creatures, O bestower of boons, O lord of the Earth, lord of every created thing, lord of the universe, I will, even as thou sayest hold the Earth steady. Therefore, O lord of all creatures, place her on my head.’ Brahman said, ‘O best of snakes, go underneath the Earth. She will herself give thee a crevice to pass through. And, O Sesha, by holding the Earth, thou shalt certainly do what is prized by me very greatly…Then the elder brother of the king of the snakes, entering a hole, passed to the other side of the Earth, and holding her, supported with his head that goddess with her belt of seas passing all round.’ Brahman said, ‘O Sesha, O best of snakes, thou art the god Dharma, because alone, with thy huge body, thou supportest the Earth with everything on her, even as I myself, or Valavit (Indra), can…The snake, Sesha, the lord Ananta, of great prowess, lives underneath the Earth, alone supporting the world at the command of Brahman. And the illustrious Grandsire, the best of the immortals, then gave unto Ananta the bird of fair feathers, viz., the son of Vinata, for Ananta’s help.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Swami Prabhupada wrote,</p>
<p>“The incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead known as Śeṣa or Ananta has unlimited strength, fame, wealth, knowledge, beauty and renunciation. As described in this verse, Ananta’s strength is so great that the innumerable universes rest on His hoods. He has the bodily features of a snake with thousands of hoods, and since His strength is unlimited, all the universes resting on His hoods feel no heavier than mustard seeds. We can just imagine how insignificant a mustard seed is on the hood of a serpent. In this connection, the reader is referred to Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta, Ādi-līlā, Chapter Five, verses 117-125. There it is stated that Lord Viṣṇu’s incarnation as the serpentine Ananta Śeṣa Nāga supports all the universes on His hoods. By our calculation, a universe may be very, very heavy, but because the Lord is ananta (unlimited), He feels the weight to be no heavier than a mustard seed.” <strong>Swami Prabhupada 5.17.21</strong> <a href="https://www.vedabase.com/en/sb/5/17/21" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">https://www.vedabase.com/en/sb/5/17/21<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>Vishnu Purana book 2, chapter 5 states that Sesha is a form of Vishnu but Mahabharata says that Sesha is a form of Shiva,</p>
<p>Mahabharata 13.14.151 “…Mahadeva is the soul of all creatures. He pervades all things. He is the speaker of all discourses (on duties and rituals)…He it is that assumes the form of Sesha who sustains the world on his head…”</p>
<p>It’s not just elephant, snake or dolphin that is holding up the earth, Hindu scriptures also says that Vishnu in the form of a boar is holding up the earth and also saving it from sinking in waters. The following topic is also related to this one.</p>

<p>Scientists are spending billions of dollars to find water on other planets but Vishnu’s avatar Varaha found water below the earth some 3000 years ago and also saved the earth from sinking into that water. The story of Varaha lifting up the earth in Puranas may have taken inspiration from Brahmanas,</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana 14:1:2:11 “Then (earth) torn up by a boar (he takes), with (Vâg. S. XXXVII, 5), &#8216;Only thus large was she in the beginning,&#8217;&#8211;for, indeed, only so large was this earth in the beginning, of the size of a span. A boar, called Emûsha, raised her up, and he was her lord Pragâpati: with that mate, his heart&#8217;s delight, he thus supplies and completes him 1;&#8211;&#8216;may I this day compass for you Makha&#8217;s head on the Earth&#8217;s place of divine worship: for Makha thee! for Makha&#8217;s head thee!&#8217; the import of this is the same as before.” Tr. Julius Eggeling</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, VayaviyaSamhita 7, Section I.11.31 “The he lifted the Earth sunk under water and held it on his curved fangs. He rose up from the nether worlds.” Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Harivamsha Purana 3.35.1 “(O janamejaya!) The earth which was installed on the top surface of the water body, did not sink, like a huge ship, due to its vast body.” Tr. Desiraju Hanumant Rao</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.50.7 “Waters lie within the earth and the earth is established over waters. The sky is above, the earth is below (it) and again waters are underneath.” Tr. G.V. Tagare, Edited by G.P Bhatt</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana I.I.5.10 On seeing that the earth had sunk into the water he thought- ”What form shall I assume and uplift the earth?”[15] Assuming this inimitable form of a boar, Hari entered the nether worlds for uplifting the earth.</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 3.13.31 “Lord Boar very easily took the earth on His tusks and got it out of the water. Thus He appeared very splendid. Then, His anger glowing like the Sudarśana wheel, He immediately killed the demon [Hiraṇyākṣa], although he tried to fight with the Lord.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 8.2.34-38 “…He came up from the Rasâtala and placed the earth on the waters. He then went away to His Vaikuntha abode…” Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 8.2.11-20 “The ocean was very much agitated with the fierce striking of the hairs of the Boar, when He entered into the waters, and spoke thus :– “O Deva ! O Thou, the destroyer of the afflictions of your refuges! Protect me.” Hearing the words of the ocean, the God Hari tore asunder all the aquatic animals and went down beneath the waters. Searching violently hither and thither, He knew the earth by her smell. At once the Bhagavân Hari, the Lord of all, went to Her and rescued the earth by raising Her up on his big teeth, the Earth that was the abode of all the beings. When the Bhagavân, the Lord of all the sacrifices, came up with the Earth on the top of His teeth, He looked beautiful like the elephant of a quarter taking out by the root and holding a thousand petalled lotus upon his tusks.” Tr. Swami Vijnananada</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 1.4.45-48 “The supreme being thus eulogized, upholding the earth, raised it quickly, and placed it on the summit of the ocean, where it floats like a mighty vessel, and from its expansive surface does not sink beneath the waters. Then, having levelled the earth, the great eternal deity divided it into portions, by mountains…” Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Harivamsa Purana 1.40.6 “We have heard that sage Krishna-dwaipAyana described this great boar incarnation before the twice-born ones when they assembled at a sacrifice, and detailed as to how that enemy-eradicator, Vishnu, incarnating himself as a boar, saved the earth sunk in the ocean with his tusks; now I would like to hear at length the various deeds performed by the intelligent slayer of enemies hari in his incarnation of boar.” Tr. Desiraju Hanumanta Rao</p>
<p>I remember, when I had posted a meme on my Facebook account about Varaha lifting up the Earth from waters, a Hindu tried to explain it by saying that the water mentioned in Purana is not actually water and later gave a lame explanation. Those who try to give “water” a metaphorical meaning should read following verses which refutes their claim,</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.6.10-27 ”Observing that the earth was overflowed with waters on all sides, (he thought to himself), ”Oh, what great form should I assume and uplift the earth”? He thought of the form of a Boar charmingly comfortable in sporting about in waters…It had a girth of ten and a height of a hundred Yojanas. It resembled a dark blue cloud in complexion. It grunted like the rumbling of thunder-clouds…Assuming this large immeasurable form of a boar, Visnu entered the nether regions in order to lift up the earth…. [25-27] Holding the Earth in his hands he brought it to its place. The supporter of the Earth at first mentally supported the earth and then released it. Over the flood of waters, the Earth floated like an immense boat. Due to the activities of the lord, it did not sink. With a desire to set up the universe, the lord lifted up the Earth. Then, he, the lotus-eyed lord, decided to divide the Earth. He levelled the Earth and created the mountains on it.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>

<h1><a id="post-6594-28"></a>Distance between Planets</h1>
<p>Brahma Purana 21.5-9 “O brahmins, the disc of the sun is stationed a hundred thousand Yojanas away from the earth. The disc of the moon is stationed a hundred thousand Yojanas away from the sun. Full hundred thousand Yojanas above the moon, the entire sphere of the stars shines. O brahmins, mercury (Budha) is two hundred thousand Yojanas above the sphere of stars…Saturn (Sauri) is stationed two hundred thousand Yojanas above Jupiter…” Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>The above verse says that the sun is a hundred thousand Yojanas away from the earth, so let’s do the calculation now,</p>
<p>1 Yojana = 8 miles</p>
<p>100,000*8= 800,000 miles</p>
<p>Distance between Earth and the Sun as per science</p>
<p>“149,600,000 kilometers (km) or 92,900,000 miles”<br />

<p>The verse also says that the Saturn is stationed two hundred thousand Yojanas “ABOVE” Jupiter.</p>
<p>200,000*8= 1,600,000 miles</p>
<p>“The distance between Saturn and Jupiter is 4.32 AU. That’s approximately 646,270,000 km or 401,592,178 miles.”<br />

<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 5.22.8 “Similarly the Moon is observed to be a hundred thousand Yojanas above the rays (orb) of the Sun. As it is faster in velocity (than the sun), it goes ahead (of the Sun). It covers in two fortnights the circuit made by the Sun in one (complete) year; in two days and a quarter of that distance which the Sun traverses in a month; and in one day the distance the Sun requires a fortnight to cover.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>The distance between Moon and Sun mentioned in Srimad Bhagavatam is same as mentioned in Brahma Purana 21.5-9, so now let’s calculate the distance,</p>
<p>100,000*8= 800,000 miles</p>
<p>“The moon is 93205678.8356 miles away from the sun which is 150 million kilometres.”<br />

<p>Distance between Planets,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 5.22.14-17 “Situated 1,600,000 miles above Mercury, or 8,800,000 miles above earth, is the planet Mars. If this planet does not travel in a crooked way, it crosses through each sign of the zodiac in three fortnights and in this way travels through all twelve, one after another. It almost always creates unfavorable conditions in respect to rainfall and other influences. Situated 1,600,000 miles above Mars, or 10,400,000 miles above earth, is the planet Jupiter, which travels through one sign of the zodiac within the period of a Parivatsara. If its movement is not curved, the planet Jupiter is very favorable to the brāhmaṇas of the universe. Situated 1,600,000 miles above Jupiter, or 12,000,000 miles above earth, is the planet Saturn, which passes through one sign of the zodiac in thirty months and covers the entire zodiac circle in thirty Anuvatsaras. This planet is always very inauspicious for the universal situation. Situated 8,800,000 miles above Saturn, or 20,800,000 miles above earth, are the seven saintly sages, who are always thinking of the well-being of the inhabitants of the universe. They circumambulate the supreme abode of Lord Viṣṇu, known as Dhruvaloka, the polestar.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Above verse says that Mercury is 1,600,000 miles above Mars while according to science, The distance between Mercury and Mars is 1.14 AU. That’s approximately 170,030,000 km or 105,651,744 miles. It also says that Earth is 8,800,000 miles away from Mars while Earth is 0.52 AU away from Mars. That’s approximately 78,340,000 km or 48,678,219 miles.<br />

<p>It also makes the claim that “Situated 1,600,000 miles above Mars, or 10,400,000 miles above earth, is the planet Jupiter”</p>
<p>While as per science the distance between Mars and Jupiter is 3.68 AU. That’s approximately 550,390,000 km or 342,012,346 miles. And the distance between Earth and Jupiter is 4.2 AU. That’s approximately 628,730,000 km or 390,674,710 miles.<br />

<p>It then makes claim that “Situated 1,600,000 miles above Jupiter, or 12,000,000 miles above earth, is the planet Saturn”</p>
<p>While the fact is, The distance between Saturn and Jupiter is 4.32 AU. That’s approximately 646,270,000 km or 401,592,178 miles and the distance between Saturn and Earth is 8.52 AU. That’s approximately 1,275,000,000 km or 792,248,270 miles.</p>

<p>Following verses from Srimad Bhagavatam 5.22.12-13 are related to this subject. It makes the claim that Mercury is 1,600,000 miles above Venus or 7,200,000 miles above earth. While the distance between Mercury and Venus is 0.34 AU. That’s approximately 50,290,000 km or 31,248,757 miles. And the distance between Mercury and Earth is 0.61 AU. That’s approximately 91,691,000 km or 56,974,146 miles.<br />

<h1><a id="post-6594-29"></a>Sun, Venus and Mercury has same Orbits</h1>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 5.22.12 “Some 1,600,000 miles above this group of stars is the planet Venus, which moves at almost exactly the same pace as the sun according to swift, slow and moderate movements. Sometimes Venus moves behind the sun, sometimes in front of the sun and sometimes along with it. Venus nullifies the influence of planets that are obstacles to rainfall. Consequently its presence causes rainfall, and it is therefore considered very favorable for all living beings within this universe. This has been accepted by learned scholars.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 5.22.13 “Mercury is described to be similar to Venus, in that it moves sometimes behind the sun, sometimes in front of the sun and sometimes along with it. It is 1,600,000 miles above Venus, or 7,200,000 miles above earth. Mercury, which is the son of the moon, is almost always very auspicious for the inhabitants of the universe, but when it does not move along with the sun, it forbodes cyclones, dust, irregular rainfall, and waterless clouds. In this way it creates fearful conditions due to inadequate or excessive rainfall.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>

<h1><a id="post-6594-31"></a>Planets move propelled by the rope of wind</h1>
<p>Hinduism says that planets move due to wind as Hinduism believes that there is air in space,</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 128.14 “All these stars are tied to Dhruva: and they move on propelled by the wind. The Moon and the Sun move on in the celestial firmament, prompted by currents of strong wind. They glide on tied to the Dhruva. Their motions round the pole are brought about by these ropes made of wind.” Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, Edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>Linga Purana I.57.7 “The stars and the luminaries, urged by the circular gusts of wind, move like fire brands. Since the wind bears the luminaries, it is called Pravaha.” Tr. Board of Scholars, Edited by J.L. Shastri</p>

<h1><a id="post-6594-33"></a>Sun and Moon dipping in water</h1>
<p>Vamana Purana 16.53 “Burnt by the fire of the eyes of Siva, the restless Surya immersed in the Asi and reaching Varuna, he had a dip in it as freely as he like.” Tr. Ananda Swarup Gupta</p>
<p>Rig Veda 7.55.7, Atharva Veda 4.5.1 The Bull [Vushab/Sun] who hath a thousand horns, who rises up from out the sea…</p>
<p>Kausitaki Brahmana 18.9 Him who yonder gives heat they seek by these pressings to obtain; the rising by the morning pressing, (the sun) in the middle (of his course) by the midday pressing, (the sun) as he sets by the third pressing. He, having entered the waters, becomes Varuna.</p>
<p>Aitareya Brahma Book 4, Chapter 20, verse 13 “…This (Aditya, the sun) is ‘the swan sitting in light’…he is ‘born from the waters’ (abja), for in the morning he comes out of the waters, and in the evening he enters the waters.” Tr. Martin Haug</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 2.12.8-9 “whence the period is termed Amávásya. In that orbit the moon is immersed for a day and night in the water; thence it enters the branches and shoots of the trees; and thence goes to the sun.” Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 13.2.4 “Victorious, inspired, and brightly shining, whom seven strong tawny-coloured coursers carry, Whom Atri lifted from the flood to heaven, thus men behold thee as thy course thou runnest.” Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.72.7 “When, O ye Gods, like Yatis, ye caused all existing things to grow, Then ye brought Sūrya forward who was lying hidden in the sea.” Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>Hinduism also says that the sun enters fire while setting, I don’t understand this verse so I leave it to the readers to understand it.</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.50.112-3 “When the sun sets, the brilliance of the sun partially enters fire. Hence fire shines more brilliantly at night, even from a distance. When the sun rises again, the brilliance of fire enters the sun. The sun rises again, the brilliance of fire enters the sun. This together with the brillaince left in the sun at the time of sunset, makes it all the more brilliant. So the sun blazes during the day.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>

<h1><a id="post-6594-34"></a>How Eclipse occurs</h1>
<p>According to Vedic mythology a demon covers the Sun which causes solar eclipse.</p>
<p>Rig Veda 5.40.5-6 O Sūrya, when the Asura’s descendant Svarbhanu, pierced thee through and through with darkness, All creatures looked like one who is bewildered, who knoweth not the place where he is standing. What time thou smotest down Svarbhanu’s magic that spread itself beneath the sky, O Indra, By his fourth sacred prayer Atri disoovered Sūrya concealed in gloom that stayed his function.</p>
<p>Following verses may have taken inspiration from the above Vedic verse. A demon named Rahu which is a star according to Hinduism causes Solar and Lunar eclipses.</p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 8.18.1-9 “…The Asura Râhu thus covers his rays. So the sphere of the Moon extends upto the twelve thousand Yoyanas. Râhu covers the field of the thirteen thousand Yoyanas. So he covers both the Sun and the Moon. Desire to take the vengeance of the previous enmity, he covers them during the time of Parva (the festivals). This planet wants to cover them from a distance. Hearing this, the Bhagavân Visnu hurls His Sudars’an Chakra against Râhu. This Chakra (disc) is encircled with the fiery flames and is very terrible. When all the quarters were filled with its violent flames, Râhu became instantly alarmed and fled away from the distance. O Devarsi! This is known as the eclipse known amongst the mortals…” Tr. Swami Vijananda</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 5.24.1-3 “Śrī Śukadeva Gosvāmī said: My dear King, some historians, the speakers of the Purāṇas, say that 10,000 yojanas [80,000 miles] below the sun is the planet known as Rāhu, which moves like one of the stars. The presiding deity of that planet, who is the son of Siṁhikā, is the most abominable of all asuras, but although he is completely unfit to assume the position of a demigod or planetary deity, he has achieved that position by the grace of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Later I shall speak further about him. Rāhu tried to create dissension between the sun and moon by interposing himself between them. Rāhu is inimical toward both the sun and the moon, and therefore he always tries to cover the sunshine and moonshine on the dark-moon day and full-moon night…After hearing from the sun and moon demigods about Rāhu’s attack, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Viṣṇu, engages His disc, known as the Sudarśana cakra, to protect them. The Sudarśana cakra is the Lord’s most beloved devotee and is favored by the Lord. The intense heat of its effulgence, meant for killing non-Vaiṣṇavas, is unbearable to Rāhu, and he therefore flees in fear of it. During the time Rāhu disturbs the sun or moon, there occurs what people commonly know as an eclipse.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Swami Prabhupada writes on Srimad Bhagavatam 5.24.2-3 “As stated herein, the sun extends for 10,000 yojanas, and the moon extends for twice that, or 20,000 yojanas. The word dvādaśa should be understood to mean twice as much as ten, or twenty. In the opinion of Vijayadhvaja, the extent of Rāhu should be twice that of the moon, or 40,000 yojanas. However to reconcile this apparent contradiction to the text of the Bhāgavatam, Vijayadhvaja cites the following quotation concerning Rāhu; rāhu-soma-ravīṇāṁ tu maṇḍalā dvi-guṇoktitām. This means that Rāhu is twice as large as the moon, which is twice as large as the sun. This is the conclusion of the commentator Vijayadhvaja. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Viṣṇu, is always the protector of His devotees, who are also known as demigods. The controlling demigods are most obedient to Lord Viṣṇu, although they also want material sense enjoyment, and that is why they are called demigods, or almost godly. Although Rāhu attempts to attack both the sun and the moon, they are protected by Lord Viṣṇu. Being very afraid of Lord Viṣṇu’s cakra, Rāhu cannot stay in front of the sun or moon for more than a muhūrta (forty-eight minutes). The phenomenon that occurs when Rāhu blocks the light of the sun or moon is called an eclipse. The attempt of the scientists of this earth to go to the moon is as demoniac as Rāhu’s attack. Of course. their attempts will be failures because no one can enter the moon or sun so easily. Like the attack of Rāhu, such attempts will certainly be failures.” <strong>Swami Prabhupada on Srimad Bhagavatam 5.24.2-3<br />

<h1> How mountains were formed</h1>
<p>Brahmanda Purana 1.2.7.9b-11 &#8220;As the previous creation was being burned formerly by the Samvartaka fire, the mountains of that period had been melted by that fire. They were then scattered by the wind. Due to chillness, they became solidified. Wherever the (molten rocks) were split there arose mountain. They are called Acalas (not-moving or immobile)&#8230;&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Vayu Purana 7- &#8220;On seeing the earth fully engulfed in waters, he entered the waters after assuming the form of a Boar. After lifting up the earth from the waters, he deposited the waters of the oceans in the oceans, of the rivers in the rivers and of the earth on the earth. Then he collected the mountains. When the previous creation was being burnt by the Samvartaka, fire of dissolution, the mountains lay destroyed and (scattered) all over the earth. In that one vast ocean, the (solidified) waters tossed by wind got collected together due to cold. Wherever they were (thus) stuck (heaped) together, there they became immovable. The mountains are called Acalas because they become motionless after being dried up and solidified&#8230;&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare, edited by G.P. Bhatt</p>
<h1>What are the stars?</h1>
<p>Virtuous men become stars,</p>
<p>Black Yajur Veda 5.4.1.3 “…these are the lights of the sky; verily he wins them; the Naksatras are the lights of the doers of good deeds…” Tr. Arthur Berriedale Keith</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana 6:5:4:8 “May the divine women, with unclipped wings, dear to all the gods, bake thee, Aṅgiras-like, O fire-pan, in the lap of the earth!&#8217; for of old the divine women, with unclipped wings, dear to all the gods, did bake it, like Aṅgiras, in the lap of the earth; and with their help he now bakes it. But, surely, these are the stars,&#8211;the women (gani) are indeed the stars, for these are the lights of those righteous men (gana) who go to the celestial world: it is by means of the stars that he thus bakes it.” Tr. Julius Eggeling</p>
<h1><a id="post-6594-37"></a>Sky/Heaven is supported by pillars</h1>
<p>Rig Veda 6.72.2 O lords of resplendence and bliss, you bestow light to the dawns; you upraise the sun with his splendour; you prop up the sky with the supporting pillar of the firmament; you spread out the earth, the mother of all. Tr. Svami Satya Prakash Saraswati</p>
<p>Rig Veda 6.47.5 “This very same exilir of devotional love finds the wavy sea of brilliant colours in fore-front of the dawns, whose dwelling is in firmament. This might exilir sustains the heavens up with a mighty pillar, the sender of rains, the leader of the winds.” Tr. Svami Satya Prakash Saraswati</p>
<p>Rig Veda 8.41.10 “In his successive functions, he emits his bright rays (during day) or turns them dark (during the night). He measures out the eternal abode, and supports with the pillar of the firmament, both heaven and the earth. May all our adversities vanish” Tr. Svami Satya Prakash Saraswati</p>
<p>What supports the Sky?</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana 3.3.4.2. He then makes (the sacrificer) say, after touching (the Soma), ‘The bull hath propped the sky, the welkin.’ For, when the gods were spreading the sacrifice, they were afraid of an attack on the part of the Asura-Rakshas. Now by what he says, ‘The bull hath propped the sky, the welkin…</p>

<p>You may have heard a lot of Hindus saying that Hinduism is a very peaceful and tolerant religion (or the way of life as they say). Hindus say that unlike other religions (hinting at Islam and Christianity) you will not be punished or put into hell for rejecting the Hindu faith or blaspheming the religion. I was reading the book The Land of the Lingam by Arthur Miles, I read only the first few pages but I found one very interesting observation by Arthur Miles, he wrote,</p>
<p>&#8220;Ask any Hindu to explain his religion, and he will wander off into a labyrinth of words from which nothing will extricate him but the end of your endurance. If you comment on his belief, he will tell you that you do not understand. &#8216;You do not understand&#8217; is always the last word of the Hindu.&#8221;</p>
<p><span id="more-2672"></span></p>
<p>Hindus will first claim that Hinduism is a very tolerant religion and when you show any violent verse from any Hindu scripture he would be startled to read the verse and try to escape the argument, on failing to explain any verse he will claim that Hindus don&#8217;t behead people for the difference in faith. Hindus would very comfortably call Muslims terrorists or being terrorist sympathizers but they turn a blind eye when it comes to Hindu terrorists. Leave aside condemning Hindu terrorism, Hindus don&#8217;t even consider Hindu terror organizations to be terrorists, they call them patriots and social workers and they outrightly deny the existence of Hindu terrorism. No community on the earth glorifies terrorism except the Hindu community. I recommend them to go through <a href="https://vedkabhed.wordpress.com/2013/10/06/how-peaceful-are-hindus/" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">How peaceful are Hindus<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> to know about the violence perpetrated by Hindus. According to the <a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/around-3-400-communal-riots-took-place-from-2016-2020-centre-101648611989880.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Central Government<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, MoS home affairs Nityanand Rai, India witnessed 3,399 cases of communal or religious rioting during the period 2016-2020. India is probably the only country in the world that faces such a large number of communal clashes probably because Hindus are majority in India. There is no communal violence in Mayalsia, Indonesia where Hindus are minority with a Muslim majority population. These two countries are perfect examples because those states have religious diversity like India. Hindus boast about India being a secular state which is the home of over 90% of all Hindus in the world. It&#8217;s quite funny that on the one hand, they boast about India&#8217;s secularism only to portray themselves as champions of secularism which is only for image building, and on the other hand, they dream of establishing Hindu Rashtra (State) via ethnic cleansing or subjugation of minorities. India is secular not because Hindus are majority but because of people like Mahatma Gandhi, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, and Dr. B.R. Ambedkar and all these persons are hated by Hindu extremists, they even want to build Nathuram Godse temple the assassin of Mahatma Gandhi. If majority of Hindus had really been secular, then the right wing would not have thrived in India. Hindu leaders giving hate speech against minorities gets full support from Hindus and no case will be lodged against them. Some Hindu leaders talk about killing Muslims and Christian, some vandalize Mosques and Churches, some talks about raping minority women, some leaders who killed Muslims in riots gets Z+ security, people are lynched for eating beef, some are shot dead for expressing their views on Hinduism, a Hindu leader talks about demolishing Mosques, another one talks about finishing off Islam and Christianity from India by 2022. All these are happening in a secular India, imagine what would&#8217;ve happened to minorities if India had been a Hindu state. Dr. B.R Ambedkar had rightly said,</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p>&#8220;The Hindus claim to be a very tolerant people. In my opinion this is a mistake. On many occasions they can be intolerant and if on some occasions they are tolerant that is because they are too weak to oppose or too indifferent to oppose.&#8221; <a href="http://ccnmtl.columbia.edu/projects/mmt/ambedkar/web/section_11.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #0000ff;">Source</span></strong><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p></blockquote>
<p>When a Muslim man was lynched on rumors that he ate beef, a magazine belonging to a Hindu terror outfit justified the killing by saying that <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Vedas-say-kill-those-who-slaughter-cows-Panchjanya/articleshow/49445823.cms" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Vedas say kill those who slaughter cows<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. The way Hinduism treats its own Shudras reveals whether it is peaceful or violent, not to speak of what it says about other religions, <a href="http://www.thecitizen.in/index.php/OldNewsPage/?Id=1465" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">every 18 minutes a crime is committed against a Dalit<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> and all these have scriptural sanctions. Some Hindus also say that they don&#8217;t use verses from their scripture to justify the killing of non-Hindus. That&#8217;s true because they would&#8217;ve cited verses only if they were familiar with their scriptures. Common Hindus don&#8217;t cite verses from Hindu scriptures because they have never read them. Surely they don&#8217;t cite their scriptures but violence perpetrated on minorities by Hindus is surely inspired by their religion. You will find hundreds of Hindu scholars spewing venom against non Hindus but you will hardly find any who try to foster the relationship between Hindus and non-Hindus. Hindu scholars spewing venom in their Dharm Sansads only proved that Hinduism is violent because Hindu scholars are well acquainted with their texts. Why were people lynched for eating beef and transporting cows if Hindus don&#8217;t believe in their scriptures? Why atrocities against Dalits is rampant if Hindus don&#8217;t get inspiration from their scriptures? When you show something from Hindu scriptures, the Hindu would quickly reply that &#8216;Our religion is not like Islam and Christianity dependent on one book, We believe in whatever we want to and reject whatever we want to, we don&#8217;t need scriptures.&#8217; If Hindus don&#8217;t require Hindu scriptures, then on what basis Babri mosque was demolished? Because it was believed to be the birthplace of a mythological figure called Rama mentioned in Ramayana for which there is no archaeological evidence to prove that he ever existed. Do Hindus directly get revelation from God on how to perform Puja and all, that they don&#8217;t need Hindu scriptures? Well, this is one of the tricks used by Hindus in argument as Hindu scriptures are fallible, they can&#8217;t be defended, Hindus would resort to many such tricks to find an easy route to escape.</p>
<p>When you talk about violence in India, Hindu fanatics will never talk about that rather he will start his whataboutery. And then shamelessly accuse others of being violent. <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/amnesty-annual-report-condemns-growing-intolerance-in-india/" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Amnesty International annual report condemns growing intolerance in India<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, <a href="http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/intolerance-in-india-rose-in-2015-says-uscirf/articleshow/52084719.cms" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">USCIRF report shows religious intolerance rose in India in the year 2015<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. Instead of correcting themselves and stop supporting Hindu hate mongers, Hindus will rather say that &#8216;You first see what&#8217;s happening in so and so country, go and condemn that first&#8217; or else will tell you that &#8216;if you are so uncomfortable in India then leave and go to some other country&#8217;. Such is their hypocrisy. They suddenly develop love for the world when communal violence in India is discussed. If violence is perpetrated by some non-Hindu even in a country far away from India then Hindus will view it as an act of barbarism, religious bigotry and will blame the culprit&#8217;s religion but if the same kind of incident is perpetrated by Hindus then Hindus view it as an act of bravery and would applaud the act, and they would start whataboutery to divert the topic. They would be overwhelmed to hear that a particular number of Muslims have been killed in a particular country but will find no problem going to Christian and Muslim countries to earn their bread and butter. Hindus will insult other religions even if any crime like theft and murder is committed by a non-Hindu, they would drag religion even in such stray crimes (which has nothing to do with religion) but they would never ever say a word against Hinduism when Hindu priests are caught in rape and murder cases, when Dalit is killed, when there is honour killing due to inter-caste marriage, when there is an attack on minority, etc.</p>
<p>Hindus leave no stone unturned in calling other religions violent but are unaware of their own religion. All such violence is inspired by their religious text. Without reading any scripture Hindus would conclude that Hinduism is peaceful, promotes the idea of universal brotherhood and that other religions like Buddhism and Jainism are also accepted. Hindus claim that you can even be an atheist and attain salvation, you will not be put in hell for rejecting Hinduism, etc. All these claims of Hindus shall be refuted in this article. Read the entire article for better understanding as some verses dealing with the same subject are posted in different categories.<a id="top"></a></p>

<h2><a id="intolerance-within-Hinduism"></a>Intolerance within Hindu caste and sect</h2>
<p>Hinduism is perhaps the only religion that divides its believers into castes and sects. There is birth-based discrimination. Hinduism says that people responsible for a mixture of caste will be put into hell fire, Shudra kings in the Kali Yuga will be slain by Kalki avatar, Shudra who takes up the duty of Brahmin will be punished, etc.,</p>
<p>Brahma Purana 106.121 &#8220;There is a hell named Gudapaka. It is full of boiling eddies of treacle and molasses. A man responsible for the mixture in castes is thrown into it. He is burnt therein.&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Some scriptures also say that Kalki will kill Shudra kings and all those people born of mixed castes,</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana 1.2.31.77-84 &#8220;In the previous Svayambhuva Manvantara, he had been born of a part of Madhava (Visnu). For a full period of twenty years, he wandered over the Earth taking with him an army along with horses, chariots and elephants. Surrounded by hundreds and thousands of Brahmanas wielding weapons, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">he killed all the Mlecchas all round along with those kings, the heretics born of Sudra women</span>. The lord exterminates those heretics. Everywhere he kills all those who are not scrupulously religious. The lord who was strong and who annihilated all the Mlecchas <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">slew these also People who were born of parents of different castes, those who depended on them</span>, the Udicyas (Notherners), Madhya Desyas (Persons of middle lands), Parvatiyas (Mountain-dweller), Pracyas (Easterners), Praticyas (Westerners), those who talk about on the ridges of the Vindya mountains, Daksinatyas (Southerners), Dravidas along with Simhalas (Ceylonese), Gandhara, Paradas, Pahlavas, Yavanas, Sakas, Tusaras. Barbaras, Cinas (Chinese), Sulikas, Daradas, Khasas, Lampa-karas, Katakas and different tribes of Kiratas. The powerful lord wielding the discuss slew all these barbarous people.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 11.4.22 &#8220;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">In his incarnation as Buddha, He shall bewilder</span> by his arguments of ahimsa (non-injury) the Daityas performing sacrifices, though not entitled to the performance thereof. Then in the Kali Yuga, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">incarnating himself as Kalki He shall slay the Sudra kings</span>.&#8221; Tr. J.M. Sanyal</p>
<p>Shudras cannot even drink the milk of tawny cow,</p>
<p>Varaha Purana 112.19-21 &#8220;Those (Sudras) who drink (the milk of) Kapila make their forefathers eat the filth in the earth for long. Note what happens to the Sudras who feed on the milk, ghee and butter of the Kapila cows. They go to the terrible hell called Raurava.&#8221; Tr. Venkitasubramonia Iyer</p>
<p>Inter-mingling of Shudras and Brahmanas is evil of Kali Yuga,</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana 1.2.31.41 &#8220;Alliances and associations of the Sudras and Antyayonis (lowest born) with Brahmanas take place in the Kali Yuga, in regard to bed, seats and food stuffs.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Kurma Purana I.30.6 &#8220;In Kaliyuga, the Sudras will have close association with the Brahmanas by the use of spells and incantations as well as through the sharing of beds, seats and food.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Intolerance towards Shudras is briefly explained in articles <a href="https://vedkabhed.wordpress.com/2015/06/05/caste-system-in-hinduism/" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Caste system in Hinduism<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> and <a href="https://vedkabhed.wordpress.com/2015/05/01/manu-smriti-and-untouchables/" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Manu Smriti and Untouchables<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>.</p>

<h3><a id="intolerance-sects"></a>Intolerance towards sects</h3>
<p>Hinduism also has sects. Other than dividing people into castes Hinduism also sanctions sects. At present time there are many sects of Hinduism like Lingayat, Arya Samaj, ISKCON, etc. There are mainly two sects in Hinduism Shaivism and Vaishnavism. Shaivites are followers of Shiva and Vaishnavites are followers of Vishnu and his avatars. Shaivite Puranas do recognize Vishnu and his avatars as Gods and Vaishnavite Puranas also recognize Shiva as God. But Shaivite scriptures hail Shiva as the Supreme God and depict Vishnu as a weak god while Vaishnavite scriptures call Vishnu as the Supreme God and humiliate Shiva. There have also been some clashes between these two groups,</p>
<p><a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/on-the-eve-of-kumbh-a-conflict-between-priests-and-sadhus/" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/on-the-eve-of-kumbh-a-conflict-between-priests-and-sadhus/<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>A similar clash happened in the 19<sup>th</sup> century also,</p>
<p>&#8220;At the Kumbh Mela at Ujjain in 1826, a combined army of Vaishnavite warrior-sadhus and Maratha soldiers inflicted a harsh military defeat on the Shaivite sadhus, and ended up plundering their temples and monasteries. Later, while the British put an end to the regular bouts of violence between the warrior-sadhus Shaivites and Vaishnavites, they made separate arrangements for both orders at the Kumbh Melas at Allahabad and Hardwar to prevent bloodshed over which sadhu order should have precedence in bathing in the Ganga.&#8221; The Radical Humanist, Volume 67, by Manabendra Nath Roy, p.13 also mentioned by Yoginder Sikand <a href="http://www.islamicvoice.com/january.98/FEAT1.HTM" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">http://www.islamicvoice.com/january.98/FEAT1.HTM<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>Visit by naga sadhus at Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams leads to ‘suddhi’<br />
<a href="http://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/current-affairs/160717/visit-by-naga-sadhus-leads-to-suddhi.html" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">http://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/current-affairs/160717/visit-by-naga-sadhus-leads-to-suddhi.html<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>In Tamil Nadu two groups of Vaishnavite Hindus namely Vadakalai and Thenkalai fought each after a dispute over whether to hold prayer in Sanskrit or Tamil <a href="https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/vadakalai-and-thenkalai-iyengars-come-blows-again-over-sanskrit-vs-tamil-prayer-102453" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/vadakalai-and-thenkalai-iyengars-come-blows-again-over-sanskrit-vs-tamil-prayer-102453<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>Although both these sects co-exist today but there seems to have a tiff between them in the scriptures. There is a battle of supremacy in both Shaivite and Vaishnavite scriptures. Shaivite scriptures show that Vishnu and his avatars worshiped Shiva,</p>
<p>Linga Purana Section I, 98.159-162 &#8220;Suta said: Thus he eulogised the bull-bannered lord with his thousand names. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The lord (i.e. Visnu) bathed Siva and worshipped him with lotus flowers. In order to test Visnu</span>, Mahesvara the lord of the worlds hid one of the lotus flowers intended for the worship. Visnu from whom the flowers was taken away thought thus, &#8216;What is this?&#8217; <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">After realising thee loss of the flower Visnu plucked out his eye and devoutly worshipped the preceptor of the universe</span>, the support of all beings. He worshipped him repeating the last name of the lord.&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a Linga Purana story to show Shiva&#8217;s superiority over Vishnu. Another story shows that the Sudarshana Chakra (Discus) which Vishnu wielded was actually given by Shiva as a boon to Vishnu after Vishnu rigorously worshiped Shiva,</p>
<p>Linga Purana Section I.98.1-3 &#8220;The sages said: O Suta, how was the discus Sudarsana acquired from Mahesvara, the lord of Devas, by lord Visnu? It behoves you to recount it. Suta said: A terrible fight ensued between Devas and the leading Asuras causing destruction to all living beings. On being pierced and hit by lances, iron clubs, javelins and arrows of bent knots Devas became extremely terrified and fled. [18-26] <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Lord Visnu said: O Devas, I shall approach lord Siva now along with all the eternal Devas and shall carry out your task in full</span>. O Devas, after acquiring the discus, formerly made by the slayer of the Tripuras in order to kill Jalandhara, I shall kill all the six thousand eight hundred great Asuras and Daityas beginning with Dhundhu&#8230;Suta said: After saying this to the excellent Devas, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Visnu, the excellent one among Devas, remembered lord Siva worshipped him</span>. On the splendid summit of the Himavan he duly installed the Linga that resembled the mountain Meru. It had been made by Visvakarman. Repeating the hymn called Tvarita-Rudra and the Rudrasukta he bathed the Linga and worshipped it with scents. It was charming in its flame-like form. He eulogised Rudra; worshipped him in the fire and bowed down to him. Repeating the thousand names in order he worshipped lord Siva&#8230; [169-170] <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Glancing lovingly at Visnu who stood aside with palms joined in reverence, Sankara, Mahadeva said </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">smilingly. O Visnu, the task of Devas has been well understood by me. I shall give you the splendid discuss Sudarsana</span>.&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>This is how Shaivite Purana shows Shiva as the supreme god. Another Shaivite scripture says that,</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Kotirudrasamhita 4.27.35-42 &#8220;Gautama said:- You are evil-minded desiring to put me in distress as I am a devotee of Siva. Hence you shall be averse to the Vedas always. Henceforth your faith in the rites of the Vedas, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">particularly with reference to the path of Siva yielding salvation shall cease to exist&#8230;fall, ye all, deep into the hell</span>&#8230;You will not have Siva as your sole deity. You will be considering the matchless Siva on a par with other gods&#8230;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">All your descendants-sons, grandsons and other, O brahmins, shall be non-Saivites. You shall stay certainly in hell along with your sons.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</span></p>
<p>These verses are implying that being a Shaivite alone can bring you salvation and being non-Shaivite will lead you to hell. A story also shows that Vaishnavite were averse to Shiva,</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Rudrasamhita 2, Parvatikhanda III.33.5-6 &#8220;Now, a certain brahmin professing Vaisnava cult came here and spoke very critically about Siva. Ever since, the mother of Parvati has gone out of sense. Hence she does not wish her daughter&#8217;s marriage with Siva.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Another verse from Shiva Purana says that only those sons who are Shaivite shall receive the inheritance,</p>
<p>Shiva Purana Vayaviyasamhita 6, section II.39.58-60 &#8220;&#8230;The descendant shall propitiate devotees. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Only a devotee of Siva shall inherit his wealth</span>. If his children are not initiated in Saivite cult the wealth shall be handed over the Siva. No child shall take it.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Contrary to those Shaivite verses other Puranas (mostly Vaishnavite) praise Vaishnavism and hail Vishnu as the supreme god, Sage Narada said,</p>
<p>Garuda Purana I.99.6-7 &#8220;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The following should not be entertained</span>. A sickly person, a person deficient in limbs or having additional appendages, a one-eyed man, son of a widow after remarriage, a fallen sinner like Avakirna and those who do not conform to conventions, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">and a a-Vaisnava (non-believer in Visnu). These are not worthy of being invited for Sraddha</span>. They (the deserving brahmins) shall be invited the day before when they shall observe celibacy.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Skanda Purana II.ii.10.120-1 &#8220;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">(As opposed to these) Avaisnavas (&#8216;non-devotees of Visnu&#8217;) hate auspicious conduct of (other) men</span>. They themselves indulge in evil conduct and evil thoughts in the minds. They are undisturbed even if great misfortune befalls them. They take delight in sexual enjoyment. Those Avaisnavas are inebriated. They do not resort to the Lord even for a moment, although he is the cause of supreme happiness and is present in the lotus of the heart. They always cover up the names of Hari by means of aimless, worthless and futile network of words&#8230;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Indeed those devoid of devotion to Visnu are human brutes</span>.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">One who blasphemes a Vaisnava cannot be protected by anyone. Even if a person is as strong as Lord Siva</span>, if he blasphemes a Vaisnava, he is sure to be destroyed. This is the verdict of all sastras. If one does not care for the verdict of the sastras and dares blaspheme a Vaisnava, he suffers life after life because of this.&#8221; <strong>Chaitanya Bhagavata Madhya 22 by Vrindavana Dasa Thakura, Tr. Swami Prabhupada</strong></p>
<p>A Purana even says that one should not reside in a kingdom where the king is not a Vaishnavite,</p>
<p>Skanda Purana II.v.11.23-24 &#8220;Bharadvaja said: Well asked, O highly fortunate one, since you are a devotee of Visnu. The earth that you protect, O king, is blessed. The subjects (governed by you) are good (blessed). One shall not stay in that kingdom where the king is not a Vaisnava. Better to stay in a forest or in a Tirtha but not in a realm where there are no Vaisnavas.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Vaishnavite scripture suggests that sage Bhrigu was a Vaishnavite, sage Bhrigu curses followers of Shiva in the following way at a particular incident,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 4.2.28-29 &#8220;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">One who takes a vow to satisfy Lord Śiva or who follows such principles will certainly become an atheist and be diverted from transcendental scriptural injunctions</span>. Those who vow to worship Lord Śiva are so foolish that they imitate him by keeping long hair on their heads. When initiated into worship of Lord Śiva, they prefer to live on wine, flesh and other such things. Bhṛgu Muni continued: Since you blaspheme the Vedas and the brāhmaṇas, who are followers of the Vedic principles, it is understood that you have already taken shelter of the doctrine of atheism.&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p><strong>Swami Prabhupada writes:</strong> &#8220;It is sometimes seen that devotees of Lord Śiva imitate the characteristics of Lord Śiva. For example, Lord Śiva drank an ocean of poison, so some of the followers of Lord Śiva imitate him and try to take intoxicants like gāñjā (marijuana). Here the curse is that if someone follows such principles he must become an infidel and turn against the principles of Vedic regulation. It is said that such devotees of Lord Śiva will be sac-chāstra-paripanthinaḥ, which means &#8220;opposed to the conclusion of śāstra, or scripture.&#8217;…&#8221; <strong>Swami Prabhupada on Srimad Bhagavatam 4.2.28 </strong><a href="http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_4.2.28" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right"><span style="color: #000000;">http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_4.2.28</span><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>Swami Prabhupada also writes,</p>
<p>&#8220;Lord Śiva&#8217;s symptoms of austerity are not exactly those of a Vaiṣṇava. Lord Śiva is certainly the number one Vaiṣṇava, but he exhibits a feature for a particular class of men who cannot follow the Vaiṣṇava principles. The Śaivites, the devotees of Lord Śiva, generally dress like Lord Śiva, and sometimes they indulge in smoking and taking intoxicants. Such practices are never accepted by the followers of Vaiṣṇava rituals.&#8221; <strong>Swami Prabhupada on Srimad Bhagavatam 4.6.36. </strong><a href="http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_4.6.36" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_4.6.36<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>Many Hindus were offended when a guy impersonated Shiva in the movie P.K and ran fearing his life, Hindus who were offended by this attacked theatres and called for a boycott of the film and upcoming films of the lead actor. I am wondering if they will tear and burn up this scripture in which Shiva is depicted in such a humiliating way. The story says that a fight between Shiva and Krishna erupted and Krishna defeated Shiva. Shiva was so scared of Krishna&#8217;s fiery that he ran away in fear and hid in a mountain.</p>
<p>Skanda Purana II.ii.12.14-18 &#8220;&#8230;Nila mountain is in the third Yojana (i.e. 3X12 Kms.). This is the holy spot of the Lord of Gauri named Ekamrakavana. Not far off, O king, is the place where, being afraid, he sought refuge. Indradyumna said: Why was the Lord of Gauri (Siva) frightened? With whom did he seek refuge?&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a Shaivite Purana but according to the translator, this is invented by Vaishnavites to show Krishna&#8217;s superiority. The translator Ganesh Vasudeo Tagare wrote,</p>
<p>&#8220;A Vaisnavite twist to show the inferiority of Siva to Visnu. The fight between Siva and Visnu for one king of Kasi (Kasiraja) and the subsequent defeat of Siva and his praise of Visnu and Siva&#8217;s departure from Varanis to Ekamra Vana (vv50-79)-all this is invented to show Visnu&#8217;s superiority.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although Skanda Purana is a Shaivite Purana but it may have also been composed by Vaishnavites that&#8217;s why there are many verses praising Vishnu and ridiculing Shiva as G.V. Tagare rightly points out. The war between Shiva and Krishna/Vishnu is explained briefly in <a href="#fighting-eachother" class="broken_link">God fighting each other</a> category. Shiva helps his devotee to fight Krishna/Vishnu and he is humiliated in the following way,</p>
<p>Skanda Purana II.ii.12.81-85a &#8220;Mahadeva said: O lord of Devas&#8230;carrying out your behest will be the cause of my welfare, O lord of the worlds. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">On account of my stupidity, I Lord, I had been arrogant. There, O Lord, your own blessing is the cause of my fickleness</span>. Since you command me, O Lord of Devas, to proceed to Purusottama, I shall carry out your behest reverently and proceed to the auspicious holy place that bestows salvation. Do a favour to me and promise that you alone will protect and sustain my sacred region Purusottama&#8230;&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>This is also explained in<a href="#fighting-eachother" class="broken_link"> Gods fighting each other</a> category. Just like this verse, Vishnu is also ridiculed in a Shaivite Purana,</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Satarudra Samhita 3.23.13-16 &#8220;When his pride fell off, Visnu was dejected, and dispirited. He then realised that Siva was sporting about in the form of a bull. Then on realising that Siva himself had come in the form of a Bull, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Visnu spoke in a shrill voice with drooping shoulders and palms joined in reverence</span>. Visnu said: O lord of the gods, O ocean of mercy, O lord Siva, I had been deluded by your Maya and my mind had been confused. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">O lord, I fought with you, Siva. Taking pity on me, O lord, let this offence be excused</span>.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>This verse is also explained in <a href="#fighting-eachother" class="broken_link">Gods fighting each other</a> category.</p>

<h3><a id="kapalika"></a>Kapalika</h3>
<p>Kapalika was Shaivite sect. The Aghori Sadhus are an offshoot of this sect. Followers of Kapalika sect used human skull as a begging bowl and also used to eat food from it, they applied ashes from crematorium and had many such weird practices. Kapalika sect has gone extinct but we can get a sense of their belief from Aghoris which is an offshoot of Kapalika. You can understand it better by looking at the following graph taken from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kapalika" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Wikipedia<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shiva is said to be a Kapalin himself,</p>
<p>Skanda Purana V.iii.214.2-3 &#8220;The lord wandered over the earth as a Kapalin (holder of a skull) wearing patched garments. He was surrounded by Pisacas, Raksasas, Dakinis, and Yoginis. He assumed the form of Bhairava and resorted to a cremation ground where he performed an elaborate penance causing freedom from fear to all the three worlds&#8230;&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Shiva Purana Ruda-Samhita 2, Satikhanda section II.27.22 &#8220;Daksa, the evil-minded, did not invite Siva for that sacrifice, deciding that He was not worthy of taking part in the sacrifice because he was a Kapalin.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>In Varaha Purana 97.1 Shiva is infuriated when Brahma calls him Kapalin. I have mentioned this verse in <a href="#fighting-eachother" class="broken_link"><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #0000ff;">Gods fighting each other</span></a> category.</p>
<p>Kapalikas are praised,</p>
<p>Skanda Purana I.iii.(P).8.76-80 &#8220;May the eminent sages staying in them protect the system of the worship of Siva. The devotees of Siva and the Pasupatas shall beg for alms (for their sustenance). Let these and the others of Yogic power and practice, as well as the Kapalikas always protect this holy spot. All the kings of past, present and future shall protect this spot without any disobedience to their commands&#8230;&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Rishi Upamanyu praises Kapalins,</p>
<p>Shiva Purana Vayaviyasamhita 6, Section II, 31.173-4 &#8220;[Upamanya said] The followers of Siva who adhere to the philosophical path, those who perform <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">the Pasupata rites those who observe holy rites and the Saivite holy men such as Kapalikas</span>-all these are adherents and executors of Siva&#8217;s behests. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">They shall be worshipped by me at the behest of Siva. May these bless me</span>. Let them praise the successful holy rite.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Kapalika Vrata prescribed by Shiva in general,</p>
<p>Skanda Purana V.i.6.84-94 &#8220;&#8230;[Shiva said] O sinless Devas, since I came over here it is called Mahakalavana. To you also who wished to perform austerities, it is Mahakalavana (forest of great opportunity). This secret holy shrine will become renowned in the world with this twin name. It is a secret forest. It is the cremation ground. It is the greatest and most majestic of all holy spots. This Kalavrtacarya (performace of Kapala Vrata) has been proclaimed by me. The devotee embellished with Kapala Vrata should take food in the Kapala (skull). The Kapala should always be held in the hand. He should be contented with the alms thus received in the course of his Vrata. He should (outwardly) adopt terrific features and reside in the cremation ground&#8230;He should adorn all limbs with holy ash&#8230; Formerly I too had adopted the Kapala Vrata and practised it. Kapala is the greatest of all secrets, holy and destructive of sins…[96] If out of delusion any man hates this Mahavrata, he will be overpowered by sins. Even after hundreds and crores of births, he is not rid of that sin. Hence no one should hate or violate it&#8230;&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Kapalika sect and other Shaivite sects are condemned in Vaishnavite Purana and Shaktism and even say that Shiva created these sects to delude people,</p>
<p>Srimad Devi Bhagavatam 7.39.21-30 &#8220;…The S&#8217;âstras that are extant, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">as contrary to the S&#8217;rutis and Smritis, are all Tâmasa S&#8217;âstras</span>, Mahâdeva has framed these Vâma, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Kâpâlak, Kaulaks, Bhairava</span> and such like S&#8217;astras for fascinating the people; else he has no object in framing them…&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Varaha Purana 174.42-42 &#8220;The Brahmana said: He who dies with the food given by a Sudra within him, becomes ghost. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">By mere contact of, not to say sitting together or eating with, Nagas (a naked sect), Kapalikas or Pasandas, one becomes a ghost</span>.&#8221; Tr. Venkitasubramonia Iyer, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Kurma Purana II.39.56-62 &#8220;Indeed the holy Pasupata vow has been formerly designed by me for the achievement of liberation. It is the greatest of all secrets. It is the subtlest essence of the Vedas. One who performs Pasupataa vow, shall be quiescent; he must have perfect self-control; he should dust his body with sacred ashes; he should observe celibacy and remain naked. Or he should wear a loin-cloth or a single garment; he should be silent and engaged in the study of Vedas. The scholar shall meditate on Siva as Pasupati. Sruti states that this Pasupata Yoga should be resorted by the seekers of liberation; that those who maintain Pasupata rite should be free from desire&#8230;There are other scriptures opposed to the Vedic view. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">They have been propounded by me alone and they are very fascinating in this world. Those cults are Vama, Pasupata</span>, the Soma cult, the Lakura (Lakula) and the Bhairava and such other cults which are opposed to Veda should not be resorted to.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Kurma Purana II.16.15 &#8220;One should not even verbally revere and honour the heretics, those who indulge in wrong actions, those who perform black magic, the Pancaratras and the Pasupatas.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>There is another Shaivite sect called Nakula which is also condemned in Vaishnavite Purana. A story in Kurma Purana says that Shiva urged Vishnu to create scriptures for deluding the sinners, on being urged by Shiva, Vishnu creates it and he then urges Shiva to also create some deluding cults. Urged by Vishnu, Shiva creates some sects which include Kapalika, Pasupata, and Nakula as mentioned in this Vaishnavite Purana in an effort to declare these Shaivite sects as deceitful and heretic sects,</p>
<p>Kurma Purana I.16.117-9 &#8220;Hence, O bull-bannered lord, we shall compose scriptures for deluding the sinners and for saving those who are out of the pale of the Vedas.&#8217; Thus addressed by Visnu, the slayer of Mura, Rudra composed deluding Scriptures and Kesava too did the same, on being urged by Siva. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">They were the treatises of the cults of Kapala, Nakula, Vama, Bhairava, both of Western and Eastern variety. Pancaratra, Pasupata and thousands of other cults as well</span>.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Ganesh Vasudeo Tagare writes &#8220;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The list shows what sects were regarded as being out of the pale of Vedic religion in KP. Out of these, Kapalas, or Kapalikas whether Brahminic or non-Brahminic</span>, ate and drank in human skulls, wore garlands of skulls and indulged in horrid practices of wine-drinking, in sexual orgies and living in unclean manner (S.N. Dasgupta Ind. Phil. V.P.2, 3). <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Nakulas are the followers of Nakula or Lakulisa, a semi-historical founder of a sect of Saivism. In the Vayu P.23.2.17-23 and the LO.I.24, he is said to be an incarnation of Siva</span> in a cemetry and Kayavarohana in Bhrgu ksetra, in Dabhoi Tehsil in Gujarat. Vama is a general term for the (Sakta?) observers of socially disapproved practices, the group being designated as Five Ma-karas. Bhairavas are also Saivites who worshipped Bhairava form of Siva. Bhairava-worship has been very popular among the masses in Maharashtra. Pancaratras, the Vasudeva worshippers who were later accommodated by the followers of Veda, held the famous Catur-vyuha (the four manifestations of Vasudeva) doctrine and had their own way of worship, are quite famous. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Pasupatas are the followers of system founded by Umapati Srikantha (or Siva) and they are mentioned in Mbh. Santi. 337.62</span>&#8230;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kurma Purana II.39.56-62 &#8220;Indeed the holy Pasupata vow has been formerly designed by me for the achievement of liberation. It is the greatest of all secrets. It is the subtlest essence of the Vedas. One who performs Pasupataa vow, shall be quiescent; he must have perfect self-control; he should dust his body with sacred ashes; he should observe celibacy and remain naked.

Those cults are Vama, Pasupata, the Soma cult, the Lakura (Lakula) and the Bhairava and such other cults which are opposed to Veda should not be resorted to</span>.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Just like Vaishvanite distortion of the Shaivite Skanda Purana II.ii.12.14-18, a Linga Purana verse may have also been twisted by Vaishnavite where Indra says,</p>
<p>Linga Purana Section I.40.38-39 &#8220;People overwhelmed by misery will never see the maximum span of life of hundred years. In Kali all the Vedas will not be available. Yajnas perish afflicted by people of no virtue. Ochre-robed and naked anchorites will be wandering and many Kapalikas (ascetics holding skulls as their begging bowls) will infest the territories.&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Vayu Purana a Vaishnavite Purana condemns Kapalikas and other religions also,</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.58.64-66 &#8220;Yajnas are forsaken when Dharma receives a setback. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">There will be many types of heretics like wearers of ochre-coloured robes (Buddhists), Jainas and Kapalikas (skull bearing mendicants)</span>. There will be sellers of the Vedas and the sacred places. Heretics antagonistic to the discipline and arrangement of different castes and stages of life will be born. When Kali Yuga sets in, the Vedas will not be studied. Sudras will be experts and authorities in the affairs of Dharma.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Shaivite Puranas says Shiva was a Kapalika, and he recommended the Kapalika Vrata, Kapalikas are praised in Shaivite Puranas but Vaishnavite Puranas says that Shiva created Kapalika and other Shaivite sects to delude the sinners. It&#8217;s clear proof that Vaishnavite text wants to demonize Shaivite sects. Shaivite sects are even called heretic sects in Vaishnavite Puranas. Read verses in <a href="#intolerance-buddhists">Intolerance towards Buddhism</a> and <a href="#intolerance-jainism" class="broken_link">Jainism</a> category in which Kapalika sect are condemned by Vaishnavite Puranas. The worship of Shivlingam is condemned in Vedas. Shiva was the local deity of India who was later assimilated in the Vedic religion by Aryans.

<h3><a id="others"></a>Others</h3>
<p>There is a conflict between Hindu sects, one sect accuses the other of not following Vedas properly,</p>
<p>Swami Prabhupada the founder of ISKCON and also a follower of Gaudiya Vaishnavism writes on Arya Samaj,</p>
<p>&#8220;Those who are Āryans strictly follow the Vedic principles, but in this age of Kali a community has sprung up known as the ārya-samāja, which is ignorant of the import of the Vedas in the paramparā system. Their leaders decry all bona fide ācāryas, and they pose themselves as the real followers of the Vedic principles. These ācāryas who do not follow the Vedic principles are presently known as the ārya-samājas…&#8221; <strong>Swami Prabhupada on Srimad Bhagavatam 5.15.1</strong> <a href="http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_5.15.1" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_5.15.1<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>Swami Prabhupada on Ramakrishna mission,</p>
<p>&#8220;So you take any means, the Ramakrishna Mission also says like that. Yata mata tata patha. &#8220;You can worship brahma-varcasa, you can worship Devī-māyā; you can worship Vasūn; you can worship Rudra; you can worship anyone; ultimately, you become one with the Supreme.&#8221; Most misguiding. Here it is&#8230; But if you want this particular thing, then you worship this. In the Bhagavad-gītā also, it is confirmed, yānti deva-vratā devān pitṟn yānti pitṛ-vratāḥ (BG 9.25).<br />
You will find, rascal gurus, they are preaching like that, that &#8220;Whatever you do, it is all right.&#8221; There is a big mission, they say also that yata mat tata patha. &#8220;Whatever you have manufactured, the way of salvation, that&#8217;s all right.&#8221;<br />

<p>Founder of Arya Samaj Swami Dayanand Saraswati writes on Puranik (orthodox) Hindus who worship idols. Puranik Hindus constitute the majority of the Hindu population,</p>
<p>&#8220;Fie on you! O you senseless, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">idiotic author of the Bhagvat Puranana. What a shameless creature you were!</span> You did not feel a bit of shame or hesitation in writing such falsehood! You became so utterly blind.&#8221; <strong>by Swami Dayanand Saraswati, Satyarth Prakash, Ch 11, page 407, Tr. Chiranjiva Bhardwaja</strong> <a href="http://satyarthprakash.in/english/chapter-eleven/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">http://satyarthprakash.in/english/chapter-eleven/<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>He also wrote,</p>
<p>&#8220;A Shaiva is really one who worships Shiva &#8211; the All merciful Being; a Vaishnava is one who worships Vishnu &#8211; the All-pervading God. A Ganpata is one who worships Ganpati &#8211; The Lord of Hosts i.e., (of the Universe); Bhagvata is one who sits at the feet of the muses. A Saurka is one who is the devotee of the All-pervading God, the Soul of the Universe &#8211; animate and inanimate. Thus Rudra, shiva, Vishnu, Ganapati, Surya, connote God, and Bhagvati connotes truthful speech. These various Puranic texts were invented owing to the wrong interpretation of the Vedic texts (quoted above)… likewise the Shivites, Shaktas, Vaishnavites and the like revile one another, because they are ignorant of the true meanings of the words Shiva, Rudra, Vishnu, etc., which, as is set forth in the first chapter of this book, are the different names of the Immutable God Who is Self-existent, All-wise and Blissful. These men of little understanding do not use their brains and never give the least thought to the matter, otherwise they will soon find out that all such terms as Shiva, Rudra, and Vishnu connote One Supreme, Incomparable&lt; Omniscient God, the Controller of the universe, on account of His possessing multitudinous attributes. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Would not the wrath of God descend on such people</span>?&#8221; By Swami Dayanand Saraswati, Satyarth Prakash, Ch 11, page 366-7, Tr. Chiranjiva Bhardwaja</p>
<p>Clashes between Hindu sects still exist. A clash broke out between Arya Samajis and followers of Sant Rampal because Arya Samajis who abuse other religions were offended by the &#8216;Derogatory&#8217; remarks made on Dayanand Saraswati by Sant Rampal. Another clash had erupted between these two groups over the handling of Ashram.</p>

<h2><a id="intolerance-towards-religions"></a>Intolerance towards other religions</h2>
<p>Now this one is really an interesting topic that would expose those Hindus who claim that Hinduism tolerates other religions. Hindus claim that Buddhism and Jainism are sects of Hinduism. And that both share the same values and teachings. It&#8217;s quite funny to hear from Hindus that Hinduism tolerates other religions when it doesn&#8217;t even tolerate its own Shudra. Shudras are not even considered Aryas, they are called Anaryas (Non-Aryans), non-Hindus in Hindu scripture, and works of scholars are called with slang terms like Maleccha (Barbarian/foreigner), Yavana who are considered to be viler than Chandalas, etc. Can such religion really preach tolerance?</p>

We will be considered winners even if 20 lakh of their population is killed.” Anand Swaroop, head of a body named the Shankaracharya Parishad sought to threaten hotels in Haridwar against holding Christmas celebrations on 25 December, he also vowed not to allow Eid celebrations, “It’s a norm since 1915 that non-Hindu religious functions cannot be held in Haridwar, acknowledged as a pilgrimage city of Hindus. We have written to nearly 300 hotels that they should not entertain Christmas celebrations at their places on 25 December. If they do, they will have to face the consequences.” Seer Sindhu Sagar called on “rich Hindu villagers” to “buy all Muslim properties and keep the village free of the minority population”. “Harass them to the extent that they are forced to sell off their houses. I have arrested more than 10 Muslims on false charges under the SC/ST Act.” Swami Prabodhanand said, “Just like Myanmar, the police, the army and every Hindu must pick up arms and organise a cleansing [of Muslims…We have no other choice.” Another speaker, Sadhvi Annapurna or Pooja Shakun Pandey <a href="https://twitter.com/zoo_bear/status/1473581283242491904" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">repeated<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> the call for genocide: “If you want to finish off their population then we are ready to kill them.

<p>I have mentioned only those Hindu scholars who made it to the news, there are many more Hindu scholars who comment against Islam and Muslims on social media, and they pass Islamophobic remarks in their religious events. So much is the hatred for Muslims by Hindu scholars because this is what Hinduism teaches them. This is not something new, Hindus have been giving hate speeches and persecuting non-Hindus for centuries, this hatred was directed towards Buddhism and Jainism in ancient India when Buddhism and Jainism flourished in India and the responsibility of giving hate speeches against them was taken up by Hindu scholars like Adi Shankaracharya, Kumarila Bhatta, Basava, etc., and now they are targeting Muslims because Islam is the second-largest religion in India so Hindus want to wipe out the Muslim community in India.</p>

<h2><a id="intolerance-buddhists"></a>Intolerance towards Buddhists</h2>
<p>In the 2nd century BC, <a href="https://scroll.in/article/774518/a-brief-history-of-religious-intolerance-in-india" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Patanjali<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> tells us that the relationship between Brahmins and Buddhists is like that between the snake and the mongoose. <a href="https://vedkabhed.wordpress.com/2014/05/14/mulshankar-on-jainism-and-buddhism/" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Swami Dayanand Saraswati<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> criticized Buddhism in his book Satyarth Prakash, Adi Shankaracharya criticized Buddhist scriptures and used abhorrent words for Buddha,</p>
<p>Brahma Sutra 2.2.32 &#8220;To be brief, from every point of view that this Buddhist doctrine may be examined for finding out some justification, it breaks down like a well sunk in sand; and we do not find any least logic here. Hence also all behaviour based on the Buddhist scripture is unjustifiable. Moreover, Buddha exposed his own incoherence in talk when he instructed the three mutually contradictory theories of the existence of eternal objects, existence of consciousness, and absolute nihilism; or he showed his malevolence towards all creatures, acting under the delusion that these creatures would get confused by imbibing contradictory views. The idea is that the Buddhist view should be abjured in every way by all those who desire the highest good.&#8221; Tr. Swami Gambhirananda</p>
<p>Jaimini wrote about Buddhist scriptures,</p>
<p>Purva Mimansa Sutra of Jaimini, Pada 3, verse 14, Adhikarana VII (b) &#8220;With regard to the non-Vedic scriptures of the Bauddha, &amp;c., the Purvapaksa is that, &#8216;inasmuch as these are as much scriptures of actions as the Veda, their authoritative character cannot be denied. The eternal and authoritative character of these scriptures can be proved by the same arguments that have been put forward in support of the eternality of the Veda.&#8217;<br />
The Siddhanta is that, inasmuch as these other scriptures are acknowledged to have been the work of human authors, they cannot be accepted to be possessed of infallible authority. They they are not eternal is proved by their having been compiled by human authors; and also by the absence in those so called &#8216;scriptures&#8217; of all regularity; that is to say, they are found to be full of incorrect words and phrases&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Pandit Ganganath Jha</p>
<p>Kumarila Bhatta wrote about Buddhist scriptures,</p>
<p>Tantra Vartika, Adhyaya 1, Pada III, Adhi (7d) &#8220;&#8230;Thus, then, we conclude that on account of their being composed of incorrect words and expressions, the scriptures of the Bauddha, &amp;c., can never be held to be either a Veda, or an eternal scripture&#8230;Nor can these scriptures be held to be eternal, because there is a clean remembrance of their authors (Buddha, and others) And hence in matters relating to Dharma, which is amenable only to an eternal scriptures (as proved under Sutra I-1-2), we cannot admit of the independent authority of the Bauddha scriptures.&#8221; Tr. Pandit Ganganath Jha</p>
<p>Hindus claim that Buddhism is part of Hinduism. That Buddha was an avatar of Vishnu. An Indologist said that Buddha was considered an avatar of Vishnu only to convert the Buddhists to Hinduism. A Dalit scholar writes,</p>
<p>&#8220;Declaring the Buddha as ninth avatara of Vishnu, by the Brahmanic Puranas, was meant to cause confusion in the minds of people with the result that Buddhism came to be treated as a &#8220;heretical&#8221; and &#8220;aesthetic&#8221; branch of Brahmanism&#8221; <a href="http://www.ambedkar.org/books/dob15.htm" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">http://www.ambedkar.org/books/dob15.htm<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>As per Hindu texts and scholars. Buddha rejected Vedas and established anti-Vedic philosophy to stop the animal sacrifice. Some Hindu scholars say that people during Buddha&#8217;s time were engaged in animal sacrifice because they lived on the wrong interpretation of Vedas and that the Vedas do not sanction animal killing. My question is if people during Buddha&#8217;s time misinterpreted the Vedas then why the avatar of Vishnu establish anti-Vedic, atheistic philosophy? Why didn&#8217;t he just revive the Vedas? Why wasn&#8217;t he born as the revivalist of Hinduism?</p>
<p>Hindus would very happily tell you that Buddha was an avatar of Vishnu but they will never tell you the truth about this avatar. According to Hindu scriptures, Vishnu didn&#8217;t incarnate as Buddha to guide people to the right path or to teach them Vedas, Vishnu incarnated as Buddha to delude people by establishing a false religion called Buddhism. Hindu scripture says that to delude the sinners and demons and to defeat the demons Vishnu incarnated as Buddha and made all the demons accept Buddhism who would continue to spread this religion. Hindu text explicitly says that Buddhism is a false religion,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 2.7.37 &#8220;Asuras, the enemies of the celestials, became proficient in the knowledge of the Vedas, and having got made by Mayadanaba (an Asura of that name) and invisible city of velocity, engaged themselves in the destruction of the people. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Thereupon the glorious God incarnated Himself as Buddha, and with a view to bring about a confusion of their understanding and to create avarice in them taught them many false religions</span> in the guise of a Pashanda (one setting the true religious texts at naught).&#8221; Tr. J.M. Sanyal</p>
<p>Padma Purana VI.252.108-115 &#8220;&#8230;The glorious one, taking up the form of Buddha, deluded his enemies. Those who were deluded by that teaching gave up all religious practices&#8230;.&#8221; Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p>Garuda Purana 3.15.26 &#8220;Then in Kali age, the Lord was born in the Kikata [modern Bihar] as Buddha. He deluded the asuras and flouted the Vedas.&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Agni Purana 16.1-5 &#8220;Agni said:- I will now describe the Buddha incarnation&#8230;Formerly in the war between gods and demons the former were defeated by the latter. Saying &#8216;Save us, Save us!&#8217; they sought refuge with Iswara. Being incarnation of illusion and infatuation he was born as the son of Suddhodana. He infatuated the Daityas and made them relinquish the religion of the Veda. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">They then became followers of Buddha and induced others to forsake Vedic religion</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">He became Arhata and afterwards made others Arhatas</span>. Divorced from Vedic religion they became all Pashandinas [Irreligious people]. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">They committed (sinful) deeds capable of taking one to hell and received (gifts) from degraded persons</span>&#8230;&#8221; Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>It&#8217;s mentioned in Bhagavad Purana,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 1.3.24 &#8220;Then, in the beginning of Kali-yuga, the Lord will appear as Lord Buddha, the son of Añjanā, in the province of Gayā, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">just for the purpose of deluding those who are envious of the faithful theist</span>.&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 4.19.24-25 &#8220;In this way while carrying away the hose with the intention of interrupting Prthu&#8217;s sacrificce, Indra assumed and abandoned deceitful disguise of <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">nude ascetics (Digamabara Jainas), red-robed ascetics (Buddhists)</span> and others (such as Kapalakas). Minds of men, through their misapprehension (of the true teachings of the Vedas), <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">are </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">generally attracted to these pseudo-religious sects as the true religion</span>, as they are charmingly presented with excellent eloquence.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 4.19.23-25 &#8220;All the forms that Indra assumed for the purpose of stealing the sacrificial horse in disguised form are therefore considered to be vile and generally adopted by persons known as Pashandas. The guises so assumed and cast off by Indra for the purpose of stealing the horse with a view to thwarting the performance of Prithu&#8217;s sacrifice have been the cause of unreligious creeds as professed by Jainas, Buddhas, and Kapalikas. Although such forms faith differ widely from the true religion or truth, they attracted the attention of the people. Such creeds in view of their intelligent arguments prove apparently charming to weak minds.&#8221; Tr. J.N. Sanyal</p>
<p>Ironically, verse 14 of this chapter states that Indra assumed the form of a Hindu saint, but that form is not listed here among Pashandas (Heretics), these verses also dub Jainism, Buddhism, and Kapalika sect as false religions. The Sanskrit word mentioned here for Buddhists is rakta pata which means red-robed, As Buddhist monks don red robes, it&#8217;s an expression used in Hindu scriptures to refer to Buddhists, Sanskrit word for Jain is Nagna which means naked referring to Digambara Jains. Upadharmesu is translated as towards false religions. The above verses are trying to say that Buddhism and Jainism are false religions and people are attracted to these sects as true religions. Gautama Rishi curses the Brahmins who oppressed him in the following way,</p>
<p>Srimad Devi Bhagavatam 12.9.63-81 &#8220;O vile Brâhma<span style="text-decoration: underline;">n</span>as! You will be always averse to see the festivals of S&#8217;iva, to worship S&#8217;iva, to Rudrâk<span style="text-decoration: underline;">s</span>a, to the Bel leaves, and to the holy Bha<span style="text-decoration: underline;">s</span>ma (ashes). You will be wholly indifferent to practise the right ways of living as presented in the Vedas and Smritis, to preserve your conduct good and to observe the path of knowledge to Advaita Jñânam, to practise restraint of senses and continence, to the daily practices of Sandhyâ Bandanam, to performing the Agnihotra ceremonies, to the study of the Vedas according to one&#8217;s own S&#8217;âkhâ or to the daily studies thereof as to teach those things or to give, as gifts, cows, etc., or to perform the S&#8217;râddhas of the fathers, etc., or to perform Krichchra Chândrâya<span style="text-decoration: underline;">n</span>a and other penances.

<p>Why Gautam Rishi is cursing Brahmins is not the topic of this discussion but the way he is cursing them is very important, he curses them to follow Bauddha (Buddhist) scriptures, and he curses them to sell father, mother, sister, brother, daughters, and even wives. So following Buddhist, Jain and Kapalika scriptures are considered so worst in the sight of Gautama Rishi that he compares it to selling mother and daughter. The following verses show that they would enter hell because they embraced the heretic philosophy like Buddhism, Jainism and Kapalika,</p>
<p>Srimad Devi Bhagavatam 12.9.91-100 &#8220;…Some of them began to mark on their bodies various heretical signs, e.g., Taptamûdrâ, etc.; some became Kâpâlikas; some became Kaulas; <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">some Bauddhas and some Jainas</span>. Many of them, though learned, became lewd and addicted to other&#8217;s wives and engaged themselves in vain and bad disputations. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">For these, they will have to go again surely to the Kumbhîpâka hell</span>…&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Hindu scriptures even consider Buddhist worship places to be equivalent to cremation ground, place inhabited by wicked men, etc.,</p>
<p>Kurma Purana II.11.48-49 &#8220;The following places are also to be avoided for Yogic Practice: places where vermins abound, cremation ground, dilapidated cowpen, the quadrangle or place where four roads meet, a crowded noisy place or <span style="text-decoration: underline;">where there is an ant-hill or a Caitya (Buddhist place of worship)</span>, an unauspicious place full of wicked men, and places where mosquitoes are in plenty. Nor should one practice Yoga when the body is ailing or when the mind is dispirited.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana says that the Asuras (Demons) created Buddhism and Jainism,</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana 2.3.14.38b &#8220;Formerly, in the battle between the Devas and the Asuras, the Asuras were defeated. They created the heretics like Vrddhasravakis, Nirgranthas, (nude Jainas), Sakyas (Buddhists), Jivaskas and Karpatas.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Another verse calls them heretics who will flourish in the Kali Yuga,</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana 1.2.31.65 &#8220;After the advent of the Kali age, many types of heretics crop up. They may be Buddhists wearing ochre-coloured robes, Jainas, Kapalikas and others who sell the Vedas. Still others are those who sell holy centres of pilgrimage.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Rama in Valmiki Ramayana says that Buddhists are thieves and should be punished like a theif,</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">यथा</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;">हि</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;">चोरः</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;">स</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;">तथा</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;">हि</span> <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">बुद्ध</span></strong> |<br />
स्तथागतं नास्तिकमत्र विध्हि |<br />
तस्माद्धि यः शङ्क्यतमःप्रजानाम् |<br />
न नास्ति केनाभिमुखो बुधः स्यात्</p>
<p>Ramayana of Valmiki, Ayodhya Kanda II.109 &#8220;I blame this act of my father&#8217;s, viz.,-that he took (for his priest) one of perverse understanding, who rangeth by help of such an intellect-who is frightfully atheistic, and who hat swerved from the path of righteousness. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">As a thief is, so is a Buddha</span>, and know that in this matter, an atheist is in a like predicament. Therefore, such an one, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">when capable of being punished like a thief for the good of the people, should be punished like a thief</span>; and let no <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Brahmana ever speak with an atheist</span>.&#8221; Tr. Manmath Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Yatha hi chor = As a theif<br />
Sa tatha hi Buddhah = so is Buddha/Buddhist</p>
<p>Ralph T.H. Griffith has also translated it as Buddhist. The reason why I translated the Sanskrit version word by word is that Hindu scholars are deliberately distorting the translation. Hari Prasad Shastri translates it as Charvaka school, and another one translates it as atheistic way even when there is a clear mention of the word Buddha which is translated into English as Buddha or Buddhist. Buddha in Sanskrit means intellectual so here it is surely not condemning &#8216;Intellectual&#8217; and also it makes no sense at all. Jabali was persuading Rama to follow atheistic philosophy and Buddhism is also considered atheistic philosophy so by keeping all these in mind the word Buddhah here refers to Buddha/Buddhist, it’s true that Ramayana may not have been composed when Buddhism was founded, this seems to be a later interpolation added by Rishis. Other Hindu scriptures say that one should avoid seeing Buddhists and the very sight of a Buddhist monk even in a dream is a bad sign,</p>
<p>Narada Purana I.15.49-53 &#8220;There is no expiation anywhere to those persons who intimately associate themselves with Sudra women, whose bodies are nourished with the food of the Sudras and <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">who indulge themselves in denouncing the Vedas</span>. There is no expiation here or hereafter to those who find fault with stories of saintly people. Even through hundreds of expiations, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">it is impossible to see the redemption of that Brahmana who enters a Buddhistic shrine</span>, even in a great emergency. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The Buddhistic are heretics, as they are the revilers of the Vedas. Hence, a Brahmana shall not even look at them</span>, since they are excluded from righteous holy rites. A Brahmana may enter a Buddhist shrine knowingly or unknowingly. If he enters knowingly, there is no redemption at all. This is the decision of the scriptures.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>The Yajnavalkya Smriti says that the very sight of a monk with red robes and shaven head (referring to Buddhists), even in a dream, is a bad sign. [Yajnavalkya SmritiI/272-273]

<h3><a id="shraddha"></a>Buddhists and Jains seeing Shraddha invalidates it</h3>
<p>Forget about participation of Buddhists and Jains in a Hindu ritual, the Hindu ritual becomes void if it is merely sighted by a Buddhist or a Jain, they must not be present at Hindu rituals as per Hindu texts.</p>
<p>Kurma Purana II.21.32-33 &#8220;That Sraddha wherein the wicked Tamasikas such as old Sravakas (Buddhists), Jainas, knowers of Pancaratra, followers of Kapalika and Pasupata sects, atheists, and others like them eat food offered to gods, does not bestow excellent benefit here and hereafter.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Ganesh Vasudeo Tagare explains the word Nagnas &#8220;The explanation in VV.35 ff below shows that the term Nagna includes Jainas, Buddhists, Jivakas (i.e. Ajivakas, the followers of Mankhali Gosala) and such other sects who do not follow Brahminism. It includes also apostate Brahmanas, atheists and the committers of gross sins (Mahapatakas)&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Usana Samita 4.23-30 &#8220;The following are disqualified to be present at a Sraddha ceremony…The <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Sramanas (Bouddha ascetics)</span>; Nirgoodas, (a class of naked mendicants); <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">those, who, know the doctrines of the</span> Pancharatra; <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Jinas</span>; the Kapalikas, the Pasupatas; if these and similar other heretics, wicked souls pervaded by the quality of Tammas, partake of the Havi, the Sraddha does not become successful, and it does not yield fruits in the next world.&#8221; Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana 2.3.14.34 &#8220;The Nagnas (naked) and other persons must not see the well-arranged Sraddha rite. The Sraddha viewed by these do not reach the Pitrs or the Pitamahas (grandfathers).&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare.</p>
<p>Vayu Purana Part 2, 16.24 &#8221;The naked and similar (apostates and non-Vedic sects) people should not see the Sraddha rite. This is the rule. Such Sraddhas as are seen by these, do not reach Pitrs or Pitamahas.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Ganesh Vasudeo Tagare writes: &#8221;As explain below (vv.26ff), those who do not have the protective covering of the Vedas. The text not only includes non-Vedic sects like Jains and Buddhists but includes apostate Brahmins, atheists, committer of gross sins (maha-patakas).</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana 2.3.15.59-62 &#8220;&#8230;One should avoid persons with tonsured head, persons, with matter hair and persons with ochre robes in the Sraddha rite.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare<br />
Kurma Purana II.22.34-35 &#8220;The following shall be shunned and kept at a great distance from Sraddhas viz. one who is deficient in any limb, a fallen one, a leper, one with running sores, an atheist, a cock, a pig, and a dog. One shall avoid a loathsome fellow, an unclean fellow, the naked one, the intoxicated one, the rogue, a women in her monthly course, the blue-garmented, the ochre-garmented and the heretic.&#8221; Tr.

<h3><a id="shiva-incarnates"></a>Shiva incarnates to stop Buddhism</h3>
<p>You may have heard the proverb &#8220;Diamond cuts diamond (Loha Lohe ko kat ta hai)&#8217;. Hindu scripture says the same about stopping Buddhism. According to Hindu scriptures and scholars, Shiva incarnated on earth and established a false philosophy (Advaita Vedanta) just to stop another false philosophy called Buddhism. Hindu scholars consider Adi Shankaracharya to be an incarnation of Shiva as Adi Shankaracharya had successfully stopped Buddhism and even persecuted Buddhists and Jains and established objectionable philosophy (Advaita Vedanta) for which he was sometimes considered crypto-Buddhist by some Hindu scholars. It&#8217;s mentioned in Padma Purana wherein Shiva says,</p>
<p>Padma Purana 6.236.5-7 &#8220;&#8230;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Visnu of the form of Buddha proclaimed the false Buddhist doctrine</span> and those of the naked and wearing dark blue garments for the destruction of the demons. The doctrine of Maya (illusion) is a wicked doctrine and said to be pseudo-Buddhist. I myself, of the form of a Brahmana, proclaimed it in Kali (age).&#8221; Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p>A verse in Kurma Purana may also be talking about this,</p>
<p>Kurma Purana I.30.31-32a &#8220;Persons practising vows not sanctioned by the Vedas, of wicked behaviour and of futile efforts, will be deluding all other people by exhibiting the fruits thereof. Their minds are enveloped and vitiated with ignorance and these base people follow feline tricks. [33b-36] Sankara, Nilalohita, will take up incarnations for the establishing the Srauta (Vedic) and Smarata (belonging to the Smrtis) rites, with a desire for the welfare of his devotees. He will teach his disciples the knowledge pertaining to the Brahman. Those who resort to the essence of Vedantas (Upanishads) and follow the holy rites indicated in the Vedas and such of those holy rites as are pointed out with special reference to the people of all castes, serve him in whatever manner they can. They overcome defects or sins of Kali Age and attain the greatest region.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Swami Prabhupada wrote,</p>
<p>&#8220;In this regard, it is stated in the Padma Purana that Lord Siva appeared as a brahmana in the age of Kali to preach the Mayavada philosophy, which is nothing but a type of Buddhist philosophy. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">It is stated in Padma Purana: Lord Siva, speaking to Parvati-devi, foretold that he would spread the Mayavada philosophy in the guise of a sannyasi brahmana just to eradicate Buddhist philosophy</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">This sannyasi was Sripada Sankaracarya. In order to overcome the effects of Buddhist philosophy and spread Vedanta philosophy, Sripada Sankaracarya had to make some compromise with the Buddhist philosophy, and as such he preached the philosophy of monism, for it was required at that time</span>. Otherwise there was no need for his preaching Mayavada philosophy. At the present moment there is no need for Mayavada philosophy or Buddhist philosophy, and Lord Caitanya rejected both of them. This Krishna consciousness movement is spreading the philosophy of Lord Caitanya and rejecting the philosophy of both classes of Mayavadi. Strictly speaking, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">both Buddhist philosophy and Sankara&#8217;s philosophy are but different types of Mayavada dealing on the platform of material existence</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Neither of these philosophies has spiritual significance</span>. There is spiritual significance only after one accepts the philosophy of Bhagavad-gita, which culminates in surrendering unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Generally people worship Lord Siva for some material benefit, and although they cannot see him personally, they derive great material profit by worshiping him.&#8221; <strong>Swami Prabhupada on Srimad Bhagavatam 4.24.17</strong><br />
<a href="http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_4.24.17" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_4.24.17<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>He also wrote,</p>
<p>&#8220;Lord Chaitanya admitted that Sankaracharya was an incarnation of Lord Shiva, and Lord Shiva is one of the greatest devotees, a Mahajan of the Bhagwat school. There are twelve great authorities on devotional service, and Lord Shiva is one of them. Then, why did he adopt the process of Mayavadi philosophy? The answer is given in the Padma Purana, where there is a statement by Lord Shiva as follows: &#8220;The Mayavadi philosophy is veiled Buddhist philosophy.&#8221; In other words, the void philosophy of Buddha is more or less repeated in the Mayavadi philosophy of impersonalism, althouth the Mayavadi philosophy claims to be directed by the Vedic conclusions. Lord Shiva thus admits that this philosophy was manufactured by him in the Age of Kali as a Brahmin boy to mislead the atheist class of men: &#8220;Actually, the Supreme Personality of Godhead has His transcendental Body, but I describe the Supreme as impersonal. Similarly, I have explained the Vedanta Sutra also on the same principles of Mayavadi philosophy.&#8221; <strong>Teachings of Lord Chaitanya (1968) </strong><a href="http://vanisource.org/wiki/TLC_19_%281968%29" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">http://vanisource.org/wiki/TLC_19_%281968%29<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>Madhavacharya wrote that Devas went to Shiva and complained about the prevalence of Buddhists and Kapalikas and requests him to re-establish the Vedic religion, Shiva accepts their requests and tells them that he will incarnate as Adi Shankaracharya, his son will incarnate as Kumarila Bhatta and Indra will incarnate as King Sudhanva. Kumarila Bhatta with the help of King Sudhanva had persecuted Jains and Buddhists,</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;The Devas once resorted to Siva, the Lord of the Silver Mountain, for seeking a favour, just as they appraoch the Icy Moon&#8230;They addressed Him thus with folded palms: &#8216;In days of yore, it was to favour us that <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Lord Vishnu incarnated Himself as the Buddha and diverted unrighteous men from contaminating the Vedic path, by preaching a new religion for them. But today, the country is filled with the heterodox followers of that religion</span>, as night is by darkness. They are indulging in carping criticism of the Veda, declaring it to be just a fraudulent means of livelihood for a few, and condemning its teachings on the duties of Varnas and Ashramas as mere superstitions. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">As people have given up the orthodox Vedic path and become heretics</span>, there is none to do the daily devotional acts like Sandhya, or to take to the life of rununciation&#8230;The followers of the cults of Siva and Vishnu bear on themselves the emblems of the Linga and the Chakra, but they too have given up Vedic rituaals, just as evil men abandon mercy&#8230;Therefore, for the protection of the world and for the happiness of the good and holy ones, Thou shouldst deign to eradicate the world of these vicious and perverse men and their practices, and re-establish the Vedic religion on firm ground.&#8217; When the Devas had completed their submission, the great God Siva said: &#8216;Taking a human body, I shall secure what is good for you. I shall establish the Dharma, conquering all the leaders of the perverse paths. I shall produce a commentary on the Brahma Sutras, setting forth the true teachings of the Vedas. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">I shall do this, taking the form of a great Sannyasin, Sankara by name</span>, accompanied by four disciples who would be like the luminous sun dispelling the darkness of ignorance conjured up the acceptance of duality&#8230;God Siva cast his lvoing glance, so rare for any one to get, on his son Shanmukha (also called Skanda and Subrahmanya)&#8230;Siva, the great God having matted locks, spoke thus to His son: &#8216;Dear one! Hear my words that are meant for the blessing of the world&#8230;And I have now promised to the Devas, as you know very well, that I shall undertake to rejuvenate the gnostic teachings which form the ultimate purport of the Veda. Now, you have to do your part of the work, and that iss the revival of the ritualistic section of Brahma (the Veda) condified by Jaimini, and thereby gain the reputed name of Subrahmanya (promoted of Brhamanya), <span style="text-decoration: underline;">besides the commonly known name of Kumarila Bhatta</span>, the preacher of the Vedic Karma-Kanda. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">In order to refute and confute the Buddhists who are attacking the the Vedic teachings and to establish the Vedic way of life</span>, you have to be born in the world. For your help, Brahma will be born as the scholar Mandana, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">while Indra will become the king Sudhanva</span> for the very same purpose.&#8221; <strong>Shankara Digvijaya 1.27-56, by Madhavacharya, Tr.

<h3><a id="kalki-buddhists"></a>Kalki avatar a murderer of Buddhists</h3>
<p>As per Kalki Purana, the final avatar of Vishnu takes birth on the earth, plunders nearby tribes to support his father&#8217;s horse sacrifice, kills many people and exterminates almost every tribe and also persecutes Buddhists. What is the crime of Buddhists that they deserve to die at the hands of Kalki avatar? Because they are Buddhists, they are heretics, because they don’t follow Vedic religion. I am using Kalki Purana which is translated and edited by ISKCON scholars Bhumipati Das and Purnaprajna Das and the translation is published as &#8216;Sri Kalki Purana&#8217;.</p>
<p>Sri Kalki Purana 13.39-44 &#8220;Lord Kalki appeared to flourish, being surrounded by all these family members. Once, Lord Kalki&#8217;s father, Visnuyasa, who was on the level of Lord Brahma, decided to perform a horse sacrifice. Understanding the intention of His father, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Lord Kalki said: My dear father, I will go out and defeat all other kings in battle and thus bring you sufficient wealth so that you can conduct the horse sacrifice properly</span>. Lord Kalki, who was certainly capable of conquering all other kings, offered His obeisances to his father and <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">then set out with his army to first conquer Kikatapura. Most of the inhabitants of this city were Buddhists, who never offered oblations to their forefathers, nor worshiped the demigods</span>&#8230;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">They did not deignate themselves or their families in terms of caste, and thus there was no conception of high or low birth</span>. As far as earning wealth, marriage, or eating were concerned, they had no sense of discrimination. The people of that city were interested only in eating, drinking, and making merry. When the ruler of that city, who was named Jina, head that Lord Kalki had come to fight, He quickly gathered an army consisting of one aksauhini.&#8221; Tr. Bhumipati Das edited by Purnaprajna Das</p>
<p>Sri Kalki Purana 16.1 &#8220;Suta Gosvami said. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">After killing the Buddhists and mlecchas of Kikatapura, Lord Kalki took their wealth</span> and returned to His capital, along with His vast army&#8221; Tr. Bhumipati Das edited by Purnaprajna Das</p>
<p>This proves that his sole purpose for killing Buddhists of Kitaka was to plunder them. Kalki born to Vishnuyasa is also mentioned in Agni Purana chapter 16.</p>
<p>Sri Kalki Purana 3.10 &#8220;Thereafter, You will set out to conquer the entire world and in the course of that conquest, You will defeat many sinful kings who are representatives of Kali. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">You will also annihilate many followers of Buddhism</span> and finally, You will entrust the responsibility of ruling the world to Devapi and Maru.&#8221; Tr. Bhumipati Das, edited by Purnaprajna Das</p>
<p>Sri Kalki Purana 10.30 &#8220;Recently, You appeared as Lord Kalki in order to eliminate the dynasty of Kali by destroying the Buddhists, atheists, and mlecchas, thereby protecting the true path of religion. What more can we say about your causeless mercy?&#8221; Tr. Bhumipati Das edited by Purnaprajna Das</p>
<p>Sri Kalki Purana 20.25 &#8220;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">You will be happy to learn that I have already defeated the Buddhists residing at Kikata-desa</span>. My mission is to destroy all the miscreants who are envious of you and other Vaisnavas. You can now wander fearlessly over the earth because I am just about to set out on a tour to conquer all the kings of the world.&#8221; Tr. Bhumipati Das, edited by Purnaprajna Das</p>
<p>Sri Kalki Purana 14.11 &#8220;Although Lord Kalki&#8217;s wonderful horse had been injured by Jina&#8217;s trident, he soon regained his composure and began roaming over the battlefield, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">jumping fiercely while angrily attacking hundreds and thousands of Buddhist soldiers</span>. In this way, Lord Kalki&#8217;s horse killed many sinful men. [13] <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Within a short period of time, Gargya and his associates killed six thousand Buddhist warriors</span>. Bhargya killed ten million enemy soldiers with the help of his army, and Visala killed twenty five thousand.&#8221; Tr. Bhumipati Das edited by Purnaprajna Das</p>
<p>The translator Bhumipati Das explains why verses in Kalki Purana are in the past tense when it predicts the advent of the Kalki avatar,</p>
<p>&#8220;Among the upa-puranas or sub Puranas, the Kalki Purana is most sacred and widely respected. At the end of Kali-yuga, the Supreme Lord, Hari, will incarnate as Lord Kalki and kill all the mlecchas, yavanas, atheists, and Buddhists of the world that defy the Vedic authority. The pastimes of Lord Kalki are subject matter of this literature, which is presented in story form. Exalted personalities can see everything, past, present, and future. For this reason, there is no fault in narrating these future events as if they had already occurred. The Kalki Purana consists of thirty-five chapters.&#8221; <strong>by Bhumipati Das in Introduction of book Sri Kalki Purana, Published by Jai Nitai Press</strong></p>

<h2><a id="intolerance-jainism"></a>Intolerance towards Jainism</h2>
<p>Just like Buddhism, the Jain religion is also declared a false and a heretic religion in Hindu scriptures. Swami Dayanand Saraswati wrote,</p>
<p>&#8220;When the people of Aryavarta gave up the study of the Vediclore which alone enables one to discriminate between right and wrong, ignorance spread over the land and many sects sprang up, the Jain religion, whose teachings are opposed to science, took root in the country…&#8221; <strong>By Swami Dayanand Saraswati, Satyarth Prakash, Ch 12, p.499, Tr.

<p>&#8216;<span style="color: #ff0000;">&#8216;What a nice trap have the Jainees set to attract fools</span> who would like nothing better than to be placed in the way of attaining salvation without having to do (righteous) deeds. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">We do not think that there exists a religion more idiotic than this</span>.&#8221; <strong>by Swami Dayanand Saraswati, Satyarth Prakash, Ch 12, page 559, Tr. Chiranjiva Bhardwaja </strong>http://satyarthprakash.in/english/category/satyarthprakash/page/5/</p>
<p>Both Jainism and Hinduism recognises Rishabhdeva or Rishabhnatha as Tirthankara (first teacher). But Hinduism doesn&#8217;t believe Tirthankara to be a Jain or as the founder of Jainism. Hindu scriptures say that Rishabhdeva was a Hindu god and avatar.</p>
<p>Linga Purana I.24.43-47 says that Shiva will incarnate as Rsabha</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 1.3.13 Says that Rishabhdeva was the eighth incarnation of Vishnu</p>
<p><strong>Swami Prabhupada wrote:</strong> &#8220;…Jains refer to Lord Ṛṣabhadeva as their original preceptor. If such people are serious followers of Ṛṣabhadeva, they must also take His instructions…&#8221; <strong>On Srimad Bhagvatam 5.6.12 </strong>http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_5.6.12</p>
<p>He means to say that Jains don&#8217;t follow what Rishabhdeva preached. There are different versions regarding the founder of Jainism in Hindu scriptures. Some Hindu scripture says that a King named Arhat was the founder, some say Jina was the founder, some say Brihaspati in Shukracharya&#8217;s guise founded Jainism, and some say Vishnu created an illusory form namely Arhat to delude people. Jains are referred to in Hindu scriptures as Arhat, Jina, Jaina and also Jain. A story from Padma Purana alone is enough to give the image of how Jainism is viewed in Hinduism. Let me present the verses first,</p>
<p>Padma Purana II.37.4-11 [Suta said] I shall tell (you) <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">all the sinful conduct of Vena</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">When he a noble king knowing righteousness was ruling</span>, a man, having put on a guise, naked, of a huge body, with his head clean-shaved, of a great lustre, holding under his armpit a broom of peacock&#8217;s feathers, and a drinking-pot made of cocoa-nut in his hand reciting (texts containing) wrong doctrines, vilifying the Vedic religion, came (there). He quickly came to (the place) where Vena was (seated). <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The sinner entered the court of that Vena</span>. Seeing him having arrived (there) Vena asked him a question: &#8216;Who are you, taking up such a form&#8230;What is your faith? Tell me (all this). What is your Veda (i.e. which Veda do you follow)? What are your practices&#8230;What are the real characteristics of your faith? Tell me all that and the truth before me.&#8221; Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p>Padma Purana II.37.12a-21 &#8220;Hearing those words of Vena <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">the sinful man</span> said these words. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The sinful man said</span>: In vain you are ruling. You are a great fool, there is no doubt about it. I am all-in-all of Dharma (i.e. religious practices). I am most adored by gods. I am knowledge&#8230;I am Dharma (i.e. religious practices)&#8230;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Know me to be the chief Jaina saint</span>, having body of true religion. The meditating sages, intent on (obtaining) knowledge, run to me only. Vena said: What kind of acts (do you do)? What is your doctrine? What are your practices? Tell (all this to me). <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The sinful man said: (That is my faith) where Arhats are the gods</span>, and Nirgrantha is looked upon as the preceptor&#8230;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The best worship is that of a Jaina mendicant, and the best meditation is that of an Arhat. This way of life is seen in the Jaina faith</span>. I have told you all this i.e. the characteristics of my faith&#8230;.&#8221; Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p>King Vena was surprised looking at this Jain saint so he asked him about his faith and practices. The Jain saint also criticizes the animal slaughter sanctioned by the Vedas. I have not added those verses here as it would&#8217;ve made the passage very long, I tried to make it as short as possible, we shall read it in Meat consumption in Hinduism article. So the Jain saint explains his beliefs and also criticizes the Vedic religion. Now read how the Jain religion is viewed by Hindu sages who addressed king Vena in the following way,</p>
<p>Padma Purana II.38.25-30 &#8220;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">When Kali (yuga) sets in, all men, deluded by sins, will act after having resorted to the Jaina faith</span>. Men will abandon Vedic practices, and will commit sins. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">There is no doubt that the Jaina faith is the root of sin</span>. O best king, the fall of those men, who are heaps of sins, brought about by this great delusion. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Govinda (i.e. Visnu), destroyer of all sins, will be (appearing) for their destruction and for nothing else</span>. Taking the form of his liking he will restrain (them) from sins. When sins will have thus accumulated, he, the god will be (appearing) as Kalki for the destruction of the Mlecchas; there is no doubt about it. Give up the behavior of (i.e. proper for) Kali (yuga) and resort to merit. Heave truthfully; become the guardian of your subjects.&#8221; Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p>On being advised by the Jain saint, King Vena embraces Jainism,</p>
<p>Padma Purana II.38.1-5a &#8220;Suta said: Vena, thus advised by <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">that very sinful Jina, and deluded by him, attained to a sinful attitude</span>. Abandoning the Vedic faith and rites of a truthful conduct, he saluted the feet of <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">that very wicked one</span>. There was cessation of good sacrifices, and also of that Vedas. Religious practices full of holy scriptures (i.e. as told in the holy scriptures) did not proceed at that time. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">As a result of (bad) rule</span>, the world became full of all sins. When that king ruled, there were no sacrifices, no (recitation of) the Vedas, no excellent purport of the holy texts, no charity and no study, O brahmanas.&#8221; Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p>So according to Hindu texts, King Vena was a righteous and noble king but as soon as he embraced Jainism he started ruling badly. This shows that whoever is against Hinduism (or is a non-Hindu) is demonized in Hindu scriptures. The verse also says that deluded by sins people will resort to Jainism. And have you noticed how the Jain saint is addressed here? He is addressed in these verses as &#8216;the wicked one&#8217; and &#8216;the sinful man&#8217;. It means whoever is not an Arya cannot be righteous, all non-Hindus are wicked and sinful. We find mention of King Vena in other scriptures also but they don&#8217;t mention that he had embraced Jainism. He has also been demonized in those scriptures as a bad ruler probably because he left the Vedic religion and embraced Jainism.</p>
<p>Also, read Srimad Bhagavatam 4.14.30-35 in the <a href="#blasphemy" class="broken_link"><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #0000ff;">Blasphemy </span></a>category where Brahmins killed King Vena for blaspheming Vishnu. Bhagavad Purana insults Jainism in the following way,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 5.6.9 &#8220;Śukadeva Gosvāmī continued speaking to Mahārāja Parīkṣit: My dear King, the King of Koṅka, Veṅka and Kuṭaka whose name was Arhat, heard of the activities of Ṛṣabhadeva and, imitating Ṛṣabhadeva&#8217;s principles, introduced a new system of religion. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Taking advantage of Kali-yuga, the age of sinful activity, King Arhat, being bewildered, gave up the Vedic principles</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">, which are free from risk, and </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">concocted a new system of religion opposed to the Vedas</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">. </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">That was the beginning of the Jain dharma</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">. Many other so-called religions followed this atheistic system</span>.&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Swami Prabhupada wrote &#8220;The followers of King Arhat went under the name Jains&#8221; <a href="http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_5.6.10" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_5.6.10<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>He also wrote,</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;the King of Koṅka and Veṅka acted like a paramahaṁsa and imitated Lord Ṛṣabhadeva. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">He introduced a system of religion and took advantage of the fallen condition of the people </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">in this age of Kali</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">It is said in Vedic literatures that people in this age will be more inclined to accept anyone as the Supreme Lord and accept any religious system opposed to Vedic principles</span>. The people in this age are described as mandāḥ sumanda-matayaḥ. Generally they have no spiritual culture, and therefore they are very fallen. Due to this, they will accept any religious system. Due to their misfortune. they forget the Vedic principles. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Following non-Vedic principles in this age, they think themselves the Supreme Lord and thus spread the cult of atheism all over the world</span>.&#8221; <strong>Swami Prabhupada on Srimad Bhagavatam 5.6.9</strong> <a href="http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_5.6.9" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_5.6.9<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>So the founder of Jainism was bewildered and taking advantage of Kali Yuga he established the false religion called Jainism. It also says that Jainism is opposed to the Vedas. Kurma Purana lists Jaina texts in ignorant scriptures,</p>
<p>Kurma Purana I.12.261 &#8220;<span style="color: #ff0000;">Those various scriptures which are contrary to Srutis and Smrtis seen in this world, are based on Tamo-guna or ignorance</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Belief in them or practising in accordance with them is a Tamasa activity</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">They i.e. those contrary to Vedas are the cults of Kapala, Bhairava, (v.1. Pancaratras), Yamala, Vama, and Arhata </span>and others similar to these also. In another incarnation of mine, these scriptures having been promulgated by me to delude the people who themselves try to <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">mislead other persons by propagating their false scriptures</span>.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Ganesh Vasudeo Tagare wrote,</p>
<p>Pasupatism: KP. records two forms of Pasupatism, one approved by Vedic tradition and the other condemned so much that sect is not only classed with non-Vedic heretic sects like Vama (&#8216;left hand&#8217; type of Tantrism) and <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Arhata (Jainas) created for the delusion of non-believers (KP.I.12.261-62)</span> but <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the believers are prohibited from even speaking with those heretics (KP.II.16.15)</span>&#8230;&#8221; Ganesha Vasudeo Tagare, Introduction (V) Religious Sects in the KP, p.xxxiv</p>
<p>A verse in Vishnu Purana says that the demons embraced Buddhism and Jainism which are false doctrines and it is prohibited to converse with them, eat in their house, meet them, etc., the entire chapter is important. If possible you can read the entire chapter available at sacred-texts.com. The passages are long though I have presented certain points only,</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 3.18.1-3 &#8220;PARÁŚARA.&#8211;After this, the great delusion, having proceeded to earth, beheld the Daityas engaged in ascetic penances upon the banks of the Narmadá river ; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">and approaching them in the semblance of a naked mendicant, with his head shaven, and carrying a bunch of peacock&#8217;s feathers</span>&#8230;[7-14] By such persuasions, and by many specious arguments, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">did this delusive being mislead the Daityas from the tenets of the Vedas</span>&#8230;might be the duty of those who go naked, or who go clothed in much raiment: and so the Daityas were seduced from their proper duties by the repeated lessons of their illusory preceptor, maintaining the equal truth of contradictory tenets; <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">and they were called Arhatas</span>, from the phrase he had employed of <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">&#8220;Ye are worthy (Arhatha) of this great doctrine;&#8221; that is, of the false doctrines which he persuaded them to embrace</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The foes of the gods being thus induced to apostatize from the religion of the Vedas</span>, by the delusive person sent by Vishńu, became in their turn teachers of the same heresies, and perverted others; and these, again, communicating their principles to others, by whom they were still further disseminated, the Vedas were in a short time deserted by most of the Daitya race&#8230;[18-26] In this manner, exclaiming to them, &#8220;Know!&#8221; (Budhyadwam), and they replying, &#8220;It is known&#8221; (Budhyate), <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">these Daityas were induced by the arch deceiver to deviate from their religious duties (and become Bauddhas)</span>&#8230;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The delusions of the false teacher paused not with the conversion of the Daityas to the Jaina and Bauddha heresies</span>, but with various erroneous tenets he prevailed upon others to apostatize, until the whole were led astray, and deserted the doctrines and observances inculcated by the three Vedas. Some then spake evil of the sacred books; some blasphemed the gods; some treated sacrifices and other devotional ceremonies with scorn; and others calumniated the Brahmans&#8230;&#8221;The precepts,&#8221; they cried, &#8220;that lead to the injury of animal life (as in sacrifices) are highly reprehensible&#8230;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">If an animal slaughtered in religious worship is thereby raised to heaven, would it not be expedient for a man who institutes a sacrifice to kill his own father for a victim?</span>&#8230;[42-45] <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Let not a man associate, in residence, sitting, or society, with him whose person or whose house has been blasted by the sighs of the gods, progenitors, and spirits. Conversation, interchange of civilities, or association with a man who for a twelvemonth has not discharged his religious duties, is productive of equality of guilt; and the person who eats in the house of such a man, or sits down with him, or sleeps on the same couch with him, becomes like him instantaneously</span>&#8230; [102-4] These, Maitreya, are the persons called naked, the meaning of which term you desired to have explained. Their very looks vitiate the performance of an ancestral oblation; speaking to then destroys religious merit for a whole day. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">These are the unrighteous heretics to whom a man must not give shelter, and speaking to whom effaces whatever merit he may that day have obtained</span>.&#8221; Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>This chapter of Vishnu Purana is explained briefly in Punishment for Apostasy under the sub-category <a href="#examples" class="broken_link"><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #0000ff;">Examples</span></a>. Skanda Purana also says that demons embraced Buddhism,</p>
<p>Skanda Purana VII.I.119.46-50 &#8220;&#8230;the Daitya warriors became furious. They rushed thereat roaring like rumbling clouds. When they were killed, they shouted &#8216;Ha! Ha!&#8217; some of the Asuras entered the sea. A few Danavas went over the mountains. Some of them had tonsured their heads and they stayed within forests as rogues. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Some of them adopted the Vrata of the Nirgranthas (nude sages or Digambara Jainas) and preached sermons on the pious activities of merciful nature</span>. Some of them became afraid of (the goddess) for their lives. They resorted to the life of heretics. They were fools engaged in arguments and disputations about basic or original causes. They had no cleanliness and they did not crave for anything. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">They are indeed seen even today in the world of Ksapanakas (Buddhist monks)</span>. Others are Bhindakas excluded from the scriptures of Saiva cult.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>A story in Devi Bhagavatam says that Brihaspati deceived the demons by assuming the form of Sukracharya and preached Jain religion to them and the demons rejected the real Sukracharya who later cursed the demons for not recognizing him, thus the motive of Brihaspati was accomplished as the demons were cursed and could be easily be defeated by Indra, so Brihaspati went to Indra and informed him about this. It shows that demons were the first to embrace Jainism.</p>
<p>Srimad Devi Bhagavatam 4.13.44-58 &#8220;Vyâsa said:&#8211; Please hear what the disguised Brihaspatî in the shape of S&#8217;ukrâchârya did afterwards. The demons were made to understand clearly by Brihaspatî; and then they took him for S&#8217;ukrâchârya and placed implicit faith on him and began to think of him and him alone. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The Daityas, enchanted and deceived by the magic of Brihaspatî, took now his refuge for acquiring the knowledge from him, since they mistook him for S&#8217;ukrâchârya</span>. Who is there that is not enchanted by the idea of gaining something? On the other hand, when the term of ten years was over, S&#8217;ukrâchârya, the real Guru of the Daityas, ceased enjoying Jayantî and began to remember his disciples, the Daityas. He now began to think that &#8220;My disciples, the Daityas, are expecting every instant my return; and I would now go and see them, bewildered with fear. They are my devotees and I ought to do such that they might not be afraid of the Devas.&#8221; And then he exclaimed to Jayantî, &#8220;O beautiful one! Let my sons take the shelter of the Gods; your term of ten years is today over; I now go therefore, to see my disciples; soon I will again come to you.&#8221; &#8220;Be it so&#8221;, replied Jayantî, the best of those who know religion, &#8220;you can go where you like; I am not to destroy your Dharma.&#8221; Hearing these words, S&#8217;ukrâchârya went hurriedly to the Demons and saw the Devaguru Brihaspatî sitting before them in the guise of S&#8217;ukrâchârya. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">He was explaining to them the Jaina doctrines, compiled by himself and finding fault with the act of envy, taking revenge and killing and cursing the sacrifices, etc</span>. He was telling them &#8220;O Enemies of Gods! Truly, I am telling you words that will, no doubt, prove good to you. Non-killing is the highest virtue; even the enemies ought never to be killed. It is the Brâhmanas, addicted to enjoyments and pleasures of the senses, who want to satisfy their tastes and pleasures that are found in the Veda&#8217;s injunctions to kill animals; but there is no virtue higher than non-killing animals.&#8221; O king! S&#8217;ukrâchârya was perfectly astonished to hear Brihaspatî, the Guru of the Devas, speaking against the Vedas and began to think that Brihaspatî is certainly my enemy. My disciples have been duped by this cheat; there is no doubt in this.&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Srimad Devi Bhagavatam 4.13.59-62 &#8220;Fie to Avarice! It is the seed of sin; very strong and the veritable gate to hell; Brihaspatî, even, the Guru of the Devas, is speaking lies, bound under the influence of this heinous avarice! Oh! What wonder is this that the Guru of the Devas, who is the promulgator of all the religious S&#8217;âstras and whose word is accepted as the final decision, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">is now expounding the doctrines of atheists</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">When Brihaspatî can become the expounder of atheistic doctrines</span>, impelled by covetousness what to speak of those whose minds are not pure and whose intelligence is not sharp? <span style="text-decoration: underline;">This Deva Guru, though a Brâhmin, is acting today like a rogue, wanting to take away all and is deceiving my disciples the Daityas</span>, who have been confounded by his magic.&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Srimad Devi Bhagavatam 4.14.16-19 &#8220;Vyâsa said:&#8211; Thus saying S&#8217;ukrâchârya hurriedly went away, infuriated with anger. Brihaspatî was glad and remained there with his mind calm. Brihaspatî then knowing the Daityas cursed by S&#8217;ukrâchârya, assumed his real appearance, left that place, and hurriedly returned to Indra. He began to say &#8220;I have undoubtedly succeeded in my undertaking; the Daityas have been cursed and left by me too. They are now helpless; so, O Good Suras! I have made them cursed, you would better now try to fight with them.&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>The founder of Virashaivism, Basava (initially a Shaiva Brahmin), was the chief minister of the Kalachuri king Bijjala, a staunch Jain with his capital at Kalyana in modern day Karnataka. The Basava Purana, a long hagiography dedicated to Basava narrates that not only did he successfully plot a regicide, but also sanctified violence against Jains, in rather gruesome ways such as putting “a sharp spear on the skulls of Jains&#8221;. Such an ideology fell in line with Virashaivism’s idea of opposing the caste system and ostentatious rituals, tenets that made the new religion popular with the masses in no time. Being the religion dominating Karnataka in the early medieval era, Jainism took the greatest hit and saw a sharp fall in its following.</p>
<p>Apart from vying for political patronage, the Lingayats (followers of Virashaivism) also started appropriating and converting Jaina basadis (shrines) into Virashaiva temples, an act that not only signified Virashaiva strength, but was also a practical necessity for a nascent religion with not enough resources to build a new temple from scratch.</p>
<p>Basava&#8217;s anniversary is celebrated across India mainly in Karnataka on the pretext that he was a social reformer let&#8217;s have a look at what Basava Purana the sacred text of Lingayat says about Jainism. Basava is regarded as the incarnation of Nandi, The Basava Purana II.32 says that Narada reported to Siva that, while other religions were flourishing, the Saiva faith was with few exceptions dying out among the Brahmins and so decaying among other castes also; Siva then asked Nandin to become incarnate as the Virasaiva saint Basavanna to preach Virasaivism in keeping with orthodox dharma.</p>
<p>Jains in Basava Purana are called two-legged beasts, animals, dogs, etc, so much is the love for Jains from one of the biggest reformers of Hinduism. The following verses show how Jains were persecuted and Vasadis (Jain Shrines) were destroyed by devotees of Basava while Basava didn&#8217;t stop it and instead Basava praised his devotee for carrying out the persection,</p>
<p>Basava Purana, chapter VI &#8220;O Jain, is it appropriate for me to cut off my head and get it right back? No, I will cut it off now and walk the streets of this town for seven days and then get it back. Can you even watch me do that? <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Not only that, I will tear down all the Jain vasadis in Kalyana so that there will not even be one left for a sample. Furthermore, I will smash all the idols of Jina</span>. This is my vow. Is there any reason why I should not subject you <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">two-legged beasts</span></strong> to this?&#8221; he said. The Jains agreed to his proposal. They all gathered together and sat on one side and watched. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">On the other side sat Basava with the devotees in attendance</span></strong>. Bijjala and his ministers were also there, along with all the people of the city young and old alike&#8230;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Basava praised him</span>; the devotees cheered him on..For seven days, Ekanta Ramayya strode though the city. Then he went and stood in front of the temple gate and cried out, &#8216;Come on now, you Jains, you have seen my vow!&#8221;&#8230;  The Jains gave him an acknowledgement of his victory, written by the king. And they all come and bowed down before the assembly of devotion. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">On each person&#8217;s face the devotees impressed the marks of Siva</span>. With cries and roars, the heroic assembly of mahesvara rose up. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">They quickly destroyed all the Jain vasadis and broke the heads of all the Jina idols. When they were finished, there was not a trace of a Jain vasadi or a Jina idol in all of Kalyana. In a fury, the devotees harassed and killed every known Jain and smashed them all into the ground</span>. The devotees of Black Throat responded by praising the peerless courage of Ekanta Ramayya. Meanwhile, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Basava worshipped Ekanta Ramayya</span> as if he were Sangamesa&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Velcheru Narayana Rao</p>
<p>Basava Purana Chapter VI &#8220;Therefore, it is not within your capacity to know our Lingadeva&#8217;s power. Ramanatha is everything, but yet the nondevotees are not capable of gaining him. Don&#8217;t say that this has never been proven! If you simply ask me to, I will give you visible evidence. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">It is well known there are seven hundred Jain vasadis in Potlaceruvu, and I am going to have them all destroyed. You are mere animals</span>. What more can I say to you?&#8221; Tr. Velcheru Narayana Rao</p>
<p>Some Jains tried to kill Tirunavakarisa in unsuccessful attempts and they were scared that he would kill them so they converted to Shaivism but this didn&#8217;t stop Tirunavakarisa, he destroyed many Jain shrines and broke the idols of Jains.</p>
<p>Basava Purana Chapter VI &#8220;&#8230;When the Jains were unable to kill him by any means whatsoever, they began to be afraid that he would kill them. So those who had been tormenting him asked him for refuge, and he protected them. He wiped out their old marks and gave them rudraksa, ashes, and the rest of the five marks. In a rage, he destroyed all the Jain images and wrecked all the Jain vasadis. &#8216;For doing so, Tirunavakarisa became known as the destroyer of the Jains&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Velcheru Narayana Rao</p>
<p>Nowadays many Hindus try to bring Jains and Buddhists within the Hindu fold so as to increase the numbers in population and also claims that Hinduism believes all religion to be true but a story from Basava Purana says how Pilla Narayana converted 2000 Buddhists and drove away the Buddhist saint,</p>
<p>Basava Purana Chapter VI &#8220;There was a Buddhist guru who was attended by two thousand disciples. Pilla Nayanaru drove the guru away and converted the two thousand Buddhists into devotees of Siva.&#8221; Tr. Velcheru Narayana Rao</p>

<h3><a id="Shudras-Buddhism"></a>Shudras will embrace Buddhism and Jainism</h3>
<p>Hindu scriptures predicted that some Shudras will embrace Buddhism and Jainism,</p>
<p>Kurma Purana I.30.13 &#8220;When the close of Yuga is imminent, Sudras calling themselves Jinas (subduers of sense organs) will perform holy rites by shaving off their heads, wearing ochre robes and black antelope skins and keeping their teeth white.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Vayu Purana Part I.58.59 &#8220;When the close of Yuga is imminent, Sudras exhibiting their white teeth, with clean shaven heads and wearing ohcrecoloured robes will perform sacred rites, proclaiming that they have conquered the sense organs.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare, edited by G.P. Bhatt</p>
<p>G.V. Tagare writes &#8220;Probably a reference to Buddhist monks, as Buddhism prevailed all over India at the time of these Puranas.&#8221;</p>
<p>G.V. Tagare explains the word Jina in the footnote as &#8220;This refers to Buddhist Bhiksus. The term &#8216;Jina&#8217; means &#8216;the subduer of sense organs&#8217; and is applied to the Buddha, Jainas (especially Digambaras) are mentioned in V.16 below.&#8221;</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 5.6.11 &#8220;Believing in the blind tradition the new way of life chosen by them but which is unsupporter by the Vedas, they of their own accord will fall into dark abymsalhell.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Harivamsa Purana 3.3.17 &#8220;Shudras with white teeth, anjan in eyes, shaven head and wearing ochre clothes will earn their livelihood, following the dharma of shakyabuddha.&#8221; Tr. A. Purushothaman and A. Harindranath</p>
<p>Narada Purana I.41.54-55 &#8220;The Sudras will not serve the twice-born. Assuming the airs of heretics, the base-born assume and practice holy rites of the Brahmanas. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The Sudras will clothe themselves in ochre-robes</span>; they will have matted hair; they will smear ashes all over their bodies. Thus equipped and employing deceptive arguments, they will begin to expatiate on Dharma. [58-] Occupying excellent seats, Sudras will expatiate on Dharma-religious duties-to Brahmans who habitually destroy Dharma. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">These and many other heretics such as nude ascetics (Digambaras), red-roled mendicants, will roam about; most of whom will be decrying the Vedas</span>. [71] After the advent of the Kali age, Sudras and outcastes will become kings and the Brahmans will be engaged in rendering service to them. They will be begging for alms&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>

<p>Manu Smriti 2.10-11 &#8220;The Veda is called the S&#8217;ruti, and the Dharma S&#8217;astra is called the Smriti.

<p>Hindu scholar Medhatithi the commentator of Manu Smriti wrote on this verse,</p>

<p>Vishnu Purana narrates the story of a Hindu king named Satadhanu who on account of his conversation with heretics was reborn as a dog, it explicitly considers conversing with non-Hindus as a grave sin leading to severe punishments,</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 3.18.48-50 &#8220;Men fall into hell who converse with one who takes his food without offering a portion to the gods, the sages, the manes, spirits, and guests. Let therefore a prudent person carefully avoid the conversation, or the contact, and the like, of those heretics who are rendered impure by their desertion of the three Vedas…[56-63] On one occasion, when they had fasted on the full moon of Kártika, and had bathed in the Bhagirathí, they beheld, as they came up from the water, a heretic approach them, who was the friend of the Rájá&#8217;s military preceptor. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The Rájá, out of respect to the latter, entered into conversation with the heretic</span>; but not so did the princess; reflecting that she was observing a fast, she turned from him, and cast her eyes up to the sun. On their arrival at home, the husband and wife, as usual, performed the worship of Vishńu, agreeably to the ritual. After a time the Rájá, triumphant over his enemies, died; and the princess ascended the funeral pile of her husband. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">In consequence of the fault committed by Śatadhanu, by speaking to an infidel when he was engaged in a solemn fast, he was born again as a dog</span>…[74-81] &#8220;Dost thou not remember, oh king, the circumstance of conversing with a heretic, which I called to thy recollection when thou wast a dog…she exclaimed, &#8220;recollect yourself: away with this uncouth form, to which the sin of conversing with a heretic has condemned you…<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Such, Maitreya, is the sin of conversing with a heretic, and such are the expiatory effects of bathing after the solemn sacrifice of a horse</span>, as I have narrated them to you. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Let therefore a man carefully avoid the discourse or contact of an unbeliever</span>, especially at seasons of devotion, and when engaged in the performance of religious rites preparatory to a sacrifice…[103-4] <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Men, indeed, fall into hell as the consequence of only conversing with those who unprofitably assume the twisted hair, and shaven crown; with those who feed without offering food to gods, spirits, and guests; and those who are excluded from the presentation of cakes, and libations of water, to the manes</span>.&#8221; Tr.

<p>Heretics here refer to Buddhists and Jains, reading the entire chapter of Vishnu Purana will help understand this better.</p>

<h2><a id="persecution"></a>Persecution of Buddhists and Jains</h2>
<p>Hindu scriptures spewing venom against Buddhists and Jains and calling their faith as false religions resulted in persecution of Buddhists and Jains by Hindus. There was no large-scale persecution at once but there was a systematic ethnic cleansing of Buddhists and Jains in India that annihilated them. Even Hindu scholars agree that Buddhism and Jainism were prevalent religions in India, but their population has been reduced to a miniscule population due to the persecution, Swami Vivekandanda wrote,</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">And such was his heart that he burnt to death lots of Buddhist monks &#8212; by defeating them in argument! And the Buddhists, too, were foolish enough to burn themselves to death</span>, simply because they were worsted in argument! <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">What can you call such an action on Shankara&#8217;s part except fanaticism?</span> But look at Buddha&#8217;s heart! Ever ready to give his own life to save the life of even a kid &#8212; what to speak of &#8220;[(Sanskrit)]&#8211; for the welfare of the many, for the happiness of the many&#8221;!

<p>Swami Prabhupada the founder of ISKCON wrote,</p>
<p>&#8220;The exact word used in Sanskrit is <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">nāstika, which refers to one who does not believe in the Vedas</span> but manufactures some concocted system of religion. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu has said that the followers of the Buddhist system of religion are nāstikas</span>. In order to establish his doctrine of nonviolence, Lord Buddha flatly refused to believe in the Vedas, and thus, later on, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Śaṅkarācārya stopped this system of religion in India and forced it to go outside India</span>.&#8221; <strong>Swami Prabhupada on Srimad Bhagavatam 4.2.30</strong><br />

<p>Swami Apurvanand, an author from Vivekananda&#8217;s tradition, describes, on the authority of an ancient text &#8220;Shankara Vijay&#8221; by Anandagiri, how Dharmapala, a Bouddha Aacharya of Nalanda Boudha Vidyapitha was defeated in &#8216;shastrartha&#8217; i.e. interpreting old existing texts, without trying to elucidate new principles, by Kumarila Bhatta. Kumarila, an uncle of Buddhist scholar Dharmakirti, being defeated and humiliated by Dharmakirti, decided to study Buddhist shastras as he thought &#8216;it is always necessary to study the enemy before attacking it&#8217; and joined Nalanda in the guise of a disciple of Dharmapala, in order to acquire enough knowledge of Buddhism so as to defeat Buddha&#8217;s doctrine. After studying Buddhism for some time, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">he challenged his guru Dharmapala, defeated him in &#8216;shastrartha&#8217;, and saw his guru embrace &#8216;tushanal&#8217; i.e. a funeral pyre made up of hay and dry wood. Dharmapala declared before being burnt alive</span>, &#8220;I am defeated by brilliance of Kumarila, but still I believe in supremacy of Buddha&#8217;s doctrine, I am not deviated at all from Buddha, His Dhamma or His Sangha, and <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">so I would renounce my life rather than renounce Buddhism</span>&#8220;. This is an account from a Brahmanic book and not from a Buddhist one. Shastrartha, Swamiji tells us, involved scholarship i.e.. an ability to quote from ancient texts, literary acumen, ability to debate and argue without cause, without logic, demonstration of so called yogic powers etc. [Swami Apurvananda, &#8220;Aacharya Shankara&#8221; 2nd edition. 1989, (Marathi translation of Bengali book), Ramakrishna Matha, Dhantoli, Nagpur, p. 94 ff.] <a href="http://www.ambedkar.org/research/Holi__A_Festival_To_Commomorate_Bahujan_Burning.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">http://www.ambedkar.org/research/Holi__A_Festival_To_Commomorate_Bahujan_Burning.htm<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>Swami Dayanand Saraswati the founder of Arya Samaj wrote,</p>
<p>&#8220;About 2,200 years ago Shankaracharya, a Braahmana of Dravid (Southern India), studied Grammar and all other Shaastras- books on Logic, Philosophy, Metaphysics, Theology, etc. &#8211; during student life, and seeing the religious degradation of his country began to soliloquies thus:- &#8220;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">What a pity! The true theistic Vedic religion has disappeared, whilst the atheistic Jain religion has prevailed to the great detriment of the people. This (i.e., the Jain religion) must be put down somehow</span>.&#8221; Shankarcharya had not only read the Shaastras but also the Jain scriptures. He was also a powerful debater&#8230;He began to think as to what was the best method of overthrowing Jainism. At last he came to the conclusion that preaching and holding discussions with the Jainis were the best methods to put down Jainism. With this object in view he went to Ujjain (in Central India). King Sudhanwa then ruled there&#8230;He went to the king and said &#8220;You have read the Jain books as well as Sanskrit, and also believe in the Jain Religion. I, therefore ask you to arrange a discussion between the exponents of the Jain religion and myself on the condition that the vanquished party should embrace the religion of the victor and that you should also accept his faith&#8230;For ten years he toured all over the country, refuted Jainism and advocated the Vedic religion. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">All the broken images that are now-a-days dug out of the earth were broken in the time of Shankar</span>, whilst those that are found whole here and there under the ground had been buried by the Jainis for fear of their being broken (by those who had renounced Jainism)&#8230;At that time this country was very rich, and its people were also patriotic. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Shankar, King Sudhanwa and other kings had not had the Jain temples pulled down as they intended to establish schools therein to teach the Vedas and other Shaastras</span>.&#8221; <strong>Satyarth Prakash, by Swami Dayanand Sasarwati, Ch 11, page 345-7, Tr. Chiranjiva Bhardwaja </strong><a href="http://www.aryasamajjamnagar.org/chaptereleven.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">http://www.aryasamajjamnagar.org/chaptereleven.htm<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>As per Dayanand, Shankaracharya and Sudhanva did not demolish Jain temples because they had intended to use them for the teaching of the Vedas. This means if they had infrastructure they would&#8217;ve demolished it. This is clear proof of how non-Hindu worship places were appropriated by Hindus. Swami Dayanand writes that Jainism had once prevailed in India,</p>
<p>&#8220;The Jainees differ from them. Mahavira and Gautama Gandharas (lords of hosts) are called Buddhas by the Buddhists, while they have been named Ganthara and Kinavara by the Jainees. Raja Shiva Prashad whose forefathers have been Jaiinees for generations together writes in their Chapter of his book called Itihas Timirnashak that Jina lived altogether about 1,000 years before Swami Shankarcharya. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The Buddhist or the Jain religion prevailed in the whole of Bharatavarsha (India)</span>. He then adds the following footnote. &#8220;By the term Bauddha (Buddhist religion) we mean that anti-Vedic religion which prevailed in all India from the time of Gandhar Mahavir, or Gautama Swami to that of Swami Shankar&#8221;<strong> Satyarth Prakash, by Swami Dayanand, Ch 12, p.524, Tr. Chiranjiva Bhardwaja</strong><br />

<p>Madhavacharya also wrote that Buddhism and Jainism dominated India,</p>
<p>&#8220;The land became full of Buddhists, and the adherents of the Vedas dwindled. So I planned to overcome these Buddhists and re-establish the dominance of the Vedic religion. Their leaders, along with the disciples, have been going about converting all kings to their faith and instigating them to reject the Vedas&#8230;[Kumarila said] I recognise you as an incarnation of Guha born for the eradication of Buddhists.&#8221; <strong>Sankara Dig Vijaya 7.77-106, by Madhavacharya, Tr. Swami Tapasyanand</strong></p>
<p>He also wrote about ending Buddhism and Jainism,</p>
<p>&#8220;Thus did the king, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">whom Skanda (Kumarila) converted, free the country from the menace of Buddhists and Jains</span>, just as the obstacles in the path of Yoga are eradicated by a wise sage. And simultaneously, just as the light of the rising sun obliterates the darkness of night, the preachings of the Vedic truth by that Brahmana sage reversed the pace of the ignorance produced by the heretical teachings. When the elephants of Jaina and Buddhist heretics disappeared because of the roaming lion of Kumarila, the tree of Vedic wisdom began to spread everywhere with luxuriant foliage. As the fire-born Kumarila was thus resuscitating the Vedic path of Karma, Lord Siva condescended to be born in order to save the world floundering in the ocean of transmigratory existence.&#8221; <strong>Sankara Dig Vijaya 1.95-98, by Madhavacharya, Tr. Swami Tapasyanand</strong></p>
<p>There is a story mentioned in Skanda Purana about a king who embraced Jainism. And was later forced to reconvert to Hinduism by the Brahmins. The text depicts Jainism negatively. Kumarapala (1143-1172 A.D) was a Shaivite king and he was converted to Jainism by the Jain saint named Acharya Hemachandra. King Kumarapala stopped appeasing the Brahmins, he forbade animal slaughter which was part of Vedic Yajna (sacrifices), and he took away their authority and possessions so they went away from the kingdom and resided elsewhere. Kumarapala stripping the Brahmins off their authority is what irked the Brahmins and was the main cause of all these things. Then another king who was the father-in-law of Kumarapala summoned them and inquired about everything and told them to go to Kumarpala and to ask him to return their possession. Kumarapala refused and criticized the Vedic sacrifices that includes slaughtering animals and all. This angered the Brahmins, so after praying to Hanuman they received a talisman that was hair (purportedly of Hanuman) and threw it in the palace which burnt everything, the Jain mendicants fled for their lives.</p>
<p>Skanda Purana III.ii.36.46-62 &#8220;&#8230;They came to the brave king Ama stationed in Kanyakubja, who was surrounded by heretics. After arriving at the city of Kanyakubja, O king, they stayed for a few days on the banks of Ganga. Those Modha Brahmanas became tired. The king was informed by spies and they were brought to his presence&#8230;Even as the Brahmanas were standing, he asked all of them,&#8217;O Brahmanas, tell (it now) why you have come. What is the matter?&#8217; The Brahmanas said: O king, we have come here from Dharmaranya to you. (It is) your son-in-law Kumarapala (Kumbhipala in v43) by whom the edict of authority of the Brahmanas, which was wonderful, has been destroyed. He has done so, because he follows the Jaina cult and has been instigated by Indrasuri&#8230;On hearing the words of the Brahmanas, the king, spoke to them: &#8216;You all may go quickly and at my behest say to King Kumarapala: Return the settlement of the Brahmanas to them.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Skanda Purana III.ii.36.34-38 &#8220;On hearing this straight from his preceptor, the powerful ruler of Kanyakubja named Ama continued to rule the kingdom. He became an emperor and was keen in protecting the subjects. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Due to the advent of Kali, the subjects became inclined to commit sins. Inciting by Ksapanas (Buddhist mendicants) and following their instructions</span>, the subjects gave up their Vaisnava cult and adopted the Buddhist way of life. [46] All the different castes were converted to Jaina cult. Brahmanas were not honoured. No religious rites like Santika and Paustika were performed. No one ever used to perform charity. Time passed like this.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>People committing sins embraced Buddhism and Jainism. So people embracing other religions like Buddhism and Jainism is seen negatively here, it says that people were inclined to commit sins and the very next line talks about those people converting to Buddhism and Jainism.</p>
<p>King Kumarapala replied to them,</p>
<p>Skanda Purana III.ii.36.62 &#8220;[Kumarapala said] O Brahmanas, I shall not abide and honour the Royal Charter issued by Rama. I disown the Brahmanas who indulge in violence and kill animals in Yajna. There is no question of my having any respect for and devotion to these killers.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Kumarapala had embraced the Jain religion. And then this happened,</p>
<p>Skanda Purana III.ii.38.14-24 &#8220;[The king said] May all of you go where Rama and Hanuman are staying. Rama will give everything. What for did you come here, O Brahmanas? I will never give. I will never give even a Varatika (a cowrie); no village and no means of livelihood. Go wherever it pleases you. On hearing the terrible words, the Brahmanas were excited with anger. They said, &#8216;Well, suffer the anger of Rama and Hanuman now.&#8217; After saying this, they threw down the packet of hair from the left armpit given by Hanuman in the abode of the kind. The excellent Brahmanas then retired. When the group of the Brahmanas departed, the whole place was ablaze with columns of flames. Everything became full of flames of fire. All the royal paraphernalia got enveloped in fire: the umbrellas, the chowries, the treasury rooms, the arsenals etc. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The queens, the princes, the elephants and many horses, the vehicles and conveyances of all sorts all were completely burning</span>&#8230;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Seeing everything burnt down, the naked Jaina mendicants, trembling again and again, took in their hands their pots, auspicious sticks, red blankets and without shoes or sandals fled away to ten directions</span>.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>For the fear of being killed by the Brahmins&#8217; talisman the King Kumarpala as well as his subjects who had resorted to Jainism reverted to Vaishnavite Hinduism and the authority of Brahmins was reinstated by the king,</p>
<p>Skanda Purana III.ii.38.30-48 &#8220;The king ran on foot here and there alone and lamenting enquired, &#8216;Where are the Brahmanas?&#8217; On hearing from the people, the king went to that place where the Brahmanas (were resting). O king after going there suddenly, he caught hold immediately of the feet of the Brahmanas. The king fell down unconscious. Repeating the name of the son of Dasaratha, &#8216;Rama, Rama&#8217;, the king with deep humility spoke these words to the Brahmanas: &#8216;I am the servant of the servant of that Rama and of Brahmanas. I had become blind through the darkness of ignorance&#8230;Whatever you desire, I shall grant it. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Devotion to Brahmanas as well as to Rama should (will) always be engaged in by me</span>. I shall never do anything other than these, O Brahmanas.&#8217; On that occasion, O king, the Brahmanas became merciful. In order to quell the curse, they threw the other packet. When the hairs were thrown, the army regained life. The quarters became clear and pure&#8230;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">As before, the common people became obedient to Brahmanas. Excepting the Visnu cult, they did not know (i.e. recognize) any other religious belief</span>. A new letter of authority legally binding as before was issued. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Heretics were banished, duly making the scripture hold good. Those outside the pale of the Vedas including the good, the middling and the lowly disappeared</span>&#8230;&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Now I shall ask all those Hindus who say that Buddhism and Jainism are accepted in Hinduism if so then why did people converting to Jainism irked the Brahmins? Why do Hindu scriptures talk so negatively about Jainism? Hemchandra also died after he lost a debate as Brahmins had made it a custom to burn Buddhists and Jain scholars after defeating them in debates. There is a different version that Kumarpala embraced Shaivism, eminent historian Romila Thapar wrote,</p>
<p>&#8220;A sixteenth century text narrates that Hemachandra was defeated in a debate and sentenced to death whereupon Kumarapala reconverted to Shaivism.&#8221; <strong>Somnath: The many voices of a history, by Romila Thapar, p.116, Published by Penguin books, 2008.</strong></p>
<p>Romila Thapar cited the reference of Gadadhara, Sampradaya Pradipa, quoted in A.K. Majumdar, Chalukyas of Gujarat, p.329 ff.</p>
<p>Kumarapala&#8217;s nephew and also his successor Ajayapala is said to have demolished many Jain temples, Romila Thapar wrote,</p>
<p>&#8220;It is strange that the brahmans did not ask Hanuman for a talisman against the Turks. Kumarapala&#8217;s successor, Ajayapla, is said to have desecrated Jaina temples and looted others and supported the Shaiva religion. His son, also a zealous Shaiva, worshipped at the Somanatha.&#8221;- <strong>Somnath: The many voices of a history, by Romila Thapar, p.116, Published by Penguin books, 2008</strong></p>
<p>Another historian wrote,</p>
<p>&#8220;However, Ajaypala, nephew and successor of Kumarpala was a Saivite. He subjucated Jains. Mihirakula ended the Gupta kingdom c. 480 CE. He was considered as an opponent by the Jains because he created policies to subjucate Jainism.&#8221; Glasenapp 1999, p. 52, as mentioned in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Jainism" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Jainism<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>&#8220;According to the Prabandhachintarnani Ajayapala destroyed the Jain temples built by his uncle. He showed no favour to Ambada and Kumzirapala&#8217;s other Jain ministers&#8221; <strong>Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency: pt. 1.

<p>Hindus have started a new trend of blaming Muslims, Hindus are blaming Muslims for the caste system, They say that Sati Pratha was also due to Muslims despite the fact that their scriptures encourage Sati Pratha, They also claim that child marriage in India is also because of Muslims even when Swami Vivekananda refuted this claim, they blame foreigners for almost every evil of their religion. And they also blame Muslims for the fall of Buddhism in India. It&#8217;s true that some Muslim conquerors may have been cruel towards Buddhists like the demolition of Nalanda but this cannot be taken as Muslims annihilated Buddhists, do Hindus mean to say that the demolition of Nalanda annihilated Buddhists from India? An important question is If Muslims wiped out Buddhism from India then why did they spare Hinduism? Hindus have their answer ready, they claim that Hindus defended the religion. But who really defended it? Even Hindu rulers who are considered &#8216;brave warriors&#8217; by Hindutvadis were defeated by Muslims. Prithviraj Chauhan couldn&#8217;t fight the army of Muhammad Ghori so he had to make an alliance with neighboring Rajpur kings and lost the second battle, Maharana Pratap lost the war against Mughal in which the commander was a Rajput, Shivaji was captured by Mughals and escaped and never had the courage to fight in a war and resorted to guerilla tactics. His son Sambhaji was executed by the Mughals, Marathas lost the third Panipat war, and Rana Sanga lost to Babur. Muslims reached Deccan India within the 13<sup>th</sup> century and ruled till Britishers invaded India. So Hindu rulers should have repelled the Muslim invasion if they were so powerful, but they failed to do so which proves that Muslim rulers overpowered them. Now, these same Hindus spread false information that the Hindu population in Pakistan and Bangladesh has declined in the last 70 years. Imagine if the Hindu population can decline without the government&#8217;s support in 70 years then what could&#8217;ve been done in 800 years by Muslim rulers.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">So why didn&#8217;t Muslim rulers annihilate Hindus like they annihilated Buddhists?</span></p>
<p>The answer is, that Muslims didn&#8217;t annihilate Buddhists and Jains but Hindus did! Buddhism was on its deathbed when Muslims arrived in India. This was because of the systematic persecution of Buddhists and Jains by Hindu rulers and scholars. Genocide of Buddhists and Jains started many centuries before Muslims arrived in India. Pushyamitra Sunga (185 BC-149 BC) had persecuted thousands of Buddhist monks and demolished many Stupas and Viharas. Hindus love to quote Dr. B.R. Ambedkar on this issue. Dr. Ambedkar wrote articles on the persecution of Buddhists by Hindus but Hindus prefer to quote the last line wherein he blames Muslim invaders for <span style="text-decoration: underline;">giving a death blow to Buddhism in India</span>. Vinay Lal a Professor of History and Asian American Studies at UCLA wrote,</p>
<p>&#8220;On this view, Buddhism found competition in Islam for converts among low-caste Hindus. Even Ambedkar, whose animosity towards Hinduism is palpable, was nonetheless firmly of the view that Islam dealt Buddhism a death blow. As he was to put it, &#8220;brahmanism beaten and battered by the Muslim invaders could look to the rulers for support and sustenance and get it. Buddhism beaten and battered by the Muslim invaders had no such hope. It was uncared for orphan and it withered in the cold blast of the native rulers and was consumed in the fire lit up by the conquerors.&#8221; Ambedkar was quite certain that this was &#8220;the greatest disaster that befell the religion of Buddha in India.&#8221; We thus find Ambekdar embracing the &#8220;sword of Islam thesis&#8221;: &#8220;The sword of Islam fell heavily upon the priestly class. It perished or it fled outside India. Nobody remained alive to keep the flame of Buddhism burning.&#8221; [3] There are, of course, many problems with this view. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The &#8220;sword of Islam&#8221; thesis remains controversial, at best, and many reputable historians are inclined to dismiss it outright</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Islam was, moreover, a late entrant into India, and Buddhism was showing unmistakable signs of its decline long before Islam became established in the Gangetic plains, central India, and the northern end of present-day Andhra and Karnataka</span>.&#8221; &#8211; Buddhism&#8217;s Disappearance from India, by Vinay Lal <a href="https://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/southasia/Religions/paths/BuddhismDisappear.doc" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">https://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/southasia/Religions/paths/BuddhismDisappear.doc<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>As Vinay Lal rightly pointed out, Buddhism had already declined long before the advent of Muslims in India hence Muslim rulers cannot be blamed for the disappearance of Buddhism in India. As Hindu fanatics are very fond of quoting one line of Dr. Ambedkar out of context, Let me quote some passages on the persecution of Buddhists and Jains written by Dr. Ambedkar&#8217;s followers,</p>
<p>&#8220;Formerly a feudatory of Chalukya, Dantidurga was the founder of Rastrakuta dynasty, a strong, aggresive and militant supporter of Brahmanism. Cave XV at Ellora called Dasavtara, which has a long undated inscription of Dantidurga carved on its entrance, was originally a Buddhist Vihara, which was converted to Brrahmanic Temple, by chiseling out Buddhist images. [Yazdani G., &#8216;Early History of Deccan&#8217;, Oxford Univ. Press, 1960, p.731]
<p>&#8220;Damodarvarman, who is regarded predecessor of Attivarman, was devotee of Samyak Sambuddha. The Kapoteswara temple at Chezarla of fourth century was a originally a chaitya hall later converted into a brahmanic temple. He is described as son of king who performed Hiranyagarbha mahadana. Attivarman, worshiper of Sambhu, performed this mahadana. [D. C. Sarkar, &#8216;Classical age&#8217; p.202 ff.]
<p>&#8220;For it was in the Dark Age that religious persecution began in India. Monasteries were demolished, monks were banished, and books were burnt: and wherever the Rajputs became rulers, Buddhist edifices went down and Hindu temples arose. By the end of the 10th century, Buddhism was practically stamped out from India, and the work of destruction was completed by the Muslims who succeeded the Rajputs as masters of India.&#8221; [Epochs of Indian History, by R. C. Dutt]

<p>&#8220;&#8230; Under his (Sankara&#8217;s) very supervision, the Buddhist, their statues and monument at Nagarjunakonda were destroyed. A.H. Longhurst, who conducted excavations at Nagarjunkonda, has recorded it in his invaluable book: &#8216;Memoir of the Archaeological Survey of India&#8217; No.54, The Buddhist Antiquities of Nagarjunkonda, by A.H.Longhurst, Delhi, 1938, p.6.</p>
<p>&#8220;The ruthless manner in which all the buildings at Nagarjunakonda have been destroyed is simply appalling and cannot represent the work of treasure seekers alone as so many of the pillars, statues, and sculptures have been wantonly smashed to pieces. Had there been a town close at hand a Amaravati, one can understand the site being used as a quarry by modern builders as was so often done in India. But this never occurred at Nagarjunakonda as there are no towns and no cart roads in or out of the valley. Local tradition relates that the great Hindu philosopher and teacher Shankaracharya of medieval times came to Nagarjunakonda with a host of followers and destroyed the Buddhist monument. Be this as it may, the fact remains that the cultivated lands in the valley on which ruined buildings stand represent a religious grant made to Shankaracharya and it was only with the sanction of the present religious Head of the followers of the great teacher that I was to conduct the excavations. This same Brahmin pontiff, who resides at Pushpagiri in the Guntur District, also owns the Srisailam temple in the Nallamalais, which no doubt was acquired in the same manner as it seems to have been a Buddhist site originally.&#8221; [Bhagwan K.S.: 1986: 14]

<p>Historians discover a Jain inscription at Quilashpur<br />
Speaking on this discovery, Mr Reddy said, “Stones one foot tall and two feet wide were used for the construction of this wall. During the Kakatiya rule, Jainism was opposed and Shaivism came to prominence. As result, all the Jain temples, basadis, inscriptions etc., were destroyed. Remnants of these temples can still be seen at several places within the perimeter of this village. These remnants were used for the construction of this fort. Along with this inscription, several stones with Jain symbols are also found on the wall.”<br />

They also killed a number of vastly learned monks. But most of them fled to other countries.

<p>Buddhist religious scriptures such as the Asokavadana allege that the first Shunga king Pusyamitra (an orthodox Brahmin) was hostile towards Buddhists and persecuted the Buddhist faith. Buddhist wrote that he &#8221;destroyed monasteries and killed monks&#8221; 84000 Buddhists stupas which had been built by Asoka were destroyed (R. Thaper), and 100 gold coins were offered for the head of each Buddhist monk. In addition Buddhist dources allege that a large number of Buddhist monasteries (Viharas) were converted to Hindu temples, in such places as Nalanda, Bodhgaya, Sarnath, or Mathura. More overt forms of Hindu hostility to Buddhism also played a role&#8230;There were episodes of Hindu persecution of Buddhists starting in the 6th century. Furthermore, the Buddha was described as an incarnation of the god Vishnu, who came to earth to delude demons (or people depending on the text) into denying the authority of the Vedas, in order to lead them to Hell. Shankara, the great Hindu philosopher and reformer, described the Buddha as an enemy of the people{17}.- Light from the East: Eastern Wisdom for the Modern West pg 192, By Harry Oldmeadow</p>
<p>&#8220;84,000 Buddhist stupas which had been built by Ashoka were &#8220;destroyed&#8221; (R. Thaper), and 100 gold coins were offered for the head of each Buddhist monk (Indian Historical Quarterly Vol. XXII, p.81 ff cited in Hars.407, also Divyavadana, p.429-434)</p>
<p>There is also archaeological evidence to prove that Buddhist worship place were destroyed by Pushyamitra Sunga, the Deorkothar Stupa was destroyed by Pushyamitra Sunga which P.K. Mishra (Archaeological Survey of India) discovered Deorkothar in 1982 with Ajit Singh and returned to excavate the site in 1999. <a href="http://archive.archaeology.org/online/news/deorkothar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">http://archive.archaeology.org/online/news/deorkothar/<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>&#8220;The Buddhist accounts are unanimous in representing Pushyamitra Sunga as a persecutor of Buddhism. His persecution started in Magadha where it is said he tried unsuccessfully to destroy the famous Kukkutarama monastery in Ptaliaputra. He went up to Sakala to execute his policy of persecution. There he offered a reward of 100 dinaras for the head of every Buddhist monk. The Buddhist account further tell us that his policy involved him in a war with a Yaksha named Krimisa and ultimately brought about his death at a place called Sthulakostha. This evidence cannot be completely discarded.&#8221; A Comprehensive History of India, Volume 2, p.364, K.

<p>&#8220;The Sungas: Following the Mauryans, Pusymitra Sunga is linked in legend with the persecution of Buddhists and a resurgence of Hinduism that forced Buddhism outwards to Kashmir, Gandhara and Bactria.

<p>A 15<sup>th</sup> century Lama named Taranatha wrote that many of the Buddhist worship places were restored by another king after the reign of Pushyamitra,</p>
<p>&#8220;It is clear that when he was residing at Sri Parvata these damages were done by the Brahman king Pusyamitra. So this appears to be the begining of the decline (of the Doctorine).<br />
After that, king Phanicandra was ruling in Magadha. During this time, in Gauda of Bhangala in the east, there was the king Gauda Vardhana with great power and wealth. He rebuilt the monasteries previously damaged and thus helped the centres to increase.&#8221; Tāranātha&#8217;s History of Buddhism in India By Tāranātha, Ch 16, p.121, Motilal Banarsidass Publ., 1990</p>
<p>Some Hindus instead of condemning what Pushyamitra did, start defending him just because he was a Hindu. The only reference they furnish is Sanchi and Barhut stupas inscriptions which say &#8216;During the supremacy of Shungas&#8217;. They attribute these to Pushyamitra and cite them as an example of his secularism, but according to historians these were built by his successors,</p>
<p>&#8220;Buddhist stupa at Sanchi, India. (Mark Weiss) destroyed by Pushyamitra and then restored by his successor, Agnimitra. Similarly, N.N. Ghosh (1945) writes that the gateway of Bharhut was built not during the reign of Pushyamitra but by his successors, who followed a more tolerant policy toward Buddhism as compared to Pushyamitra, a leader of Brahmanic reaction. The destruction and burning of the great monastery of Ghositarama at Kaushambi in the second century BC is also attributed to the Sungas. For instance, J.S. Negi (1958) notes that G.R. Sharma, who was responsible for most of the excavation work at Kaushambi, was inclined to connect this phenomenon with the persecution of Buddhism by Pushuamitra.&#8221; Popular Controversies in World History: Investigating History&#8217;s Intriguing Questions [4 volumes]: Investigating History&#8217;s Intriguing Questions, p.97, by Steven L. Danver, ABC-CLIO, 22-Dec-2010</p>
<p>&#8220;Who was responsible for the wanton destruction of the original brick stupa of Ashoka and when precisely the great work of reconstruction was carried out is not known, but it seems probable that the author of the former was Pushyamitra, the first of the Shunga kings (184-148 BC), who was notorious for his hostility to Buddhism, and that the restoration was affected by Agnimitra or his immediate successor.&#8221; in John Marshall, A Guide to Sanchi, p. 38. Calcutta: Superintendent, Government Printing (1918).</p>
<p>No matter how much Hindutvadis defend Pushyamitr Sunga, Buddhist sources and archaeological evidence proves that he indeed persecuted Buddhists and destroyed their worship places. Another persecutor of Buddhists was Shaivite king Mihirakulu,</p>
<p>&#8220;The extensive landed property put at the disposal of the Buddhist institutions by emperor Kanisha, was confiscated by the new oppressive regimes to strengthen the Brahminic hegemony. The persecution of the Buddhists and destruction of their institutions began in the sixth century by the tyrant Mihirakulu were on a mass scale.&#8221; A social history of India By S. N. Sadasivan p.238, APH Publishing, 01-Jan-2000</p>
<p>&#8220;A patron of Shaivism (worship of the Hindu god Shiva), Mihirakula is recorded in Buddhist tradition as having been uncouth and extremely cruel.&#8221; <a href="http://www.britannica.com/biography/Mihirakula" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">http://www.britannica.com/biography/Mihirakula<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>&#8220;The greatest of royal persecutors of Buddhism in India was the Huna tryant Mihirakulu (Mahiragula). His sacrilegious acts against Buddhism are recorded by Kalhana and corroborated by Hsun-tsang and the Manjusrimulakalpa. The Kashmir historian compares Mihirakula with Yama, the god of death, for the former&#8217;s atrocities. At one place Kalhana remarks: &#8216;One&#8217;s tongue would become polluted if one attempted to record his cruelties and evil deeds in detail. From this authority we learn that Mihirakula patronized brahmanas, worshipped Siva, and erected a temple of Siva, called Mihiresvara in Srinagara.&#8221; Studies in the Buddhistic Culture of India During the 7th and 8th Centuries A.D, By Lal Mani Joshi, p.320, Motilal Banarsidass Publ., 1977</p>

<p>Some historians say that Hindus taking advantage of the chaos of invasion burned Nalanda.

Hindus blame Muslims for the destruction of Nalanda University but they remain mum on destruction of Nalanda by Hindu kings.

<p>The author Hasmukh Dhirajlal Sankalia was an Indian Sanskrit scholar and archaeologist specialising in proto- and ancient Indian history. Mihirakula had not just demolished Buddhist Nalanda but had also uprooted Bodh Gaya tree under which Buddha used to meditate, but we rarely see Hindu radicals talking about these historical events as these don’t suit their vested interests. The destruction of Nalanda University by Hindu king Mihirakula is also mentioned in the book The Journal of the Bihar and Orissa Research Society, vol. 14, part 1, p.8-9, Published by the Bihar and Orissa Research Society, 1928, Printed by the Supreintendent, Government Printing, Bihar and Orissa. It is also worth noting that no modern books mention these atrocities by Hindu kings in the ancient period.</p>

<p><strong>Persecution of Jain at the hands of Basava Lingayat (Shaivite sub-sect) founder.</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;At the turn of the 12th century, followers of a revolutionary religious movement, Virashaivism (literally, heroic Shaivism), employed architectural reuse among other things to signal their triumph over Jainism, a rival religion.<br />
The founder of Virashaivism, Basava (initially a Shaiva Brahmin), was the chief minister of the Kalachuri king Bijjala, a staunch Jain with his capital at Kalyana in modern day Karnataka. The Basava Purana, a long hagiography dedicated to Basava narrates that not only did he successfully plot a regicide, but also sanctified violence against Jains, in rather gruesome ways such as putting “a sharp spear on the skulls of Jains&#8221;. Such an ideology fell in line with Virashaivism’s idea of opposing the caste system and ostentatious rituals, tenets that made the new religion popular with the masses in no time. Being the religion dominating Karnataka in the early medieval era, Jainism took the greatest hit and saw a sharp fall in its following.<br />
Apart from vying for political patronage, the Lingayats (followers of Virashaivism) also started appropriating and converting Jaina basadis (shrines) into Virashaiva temples, an act that not only signified Virashaiva strength, but was also a practical necessity for a nascent religion with not enough resources to build a new temple from scratch.<br />
Accordingly, as Julia Hegewald argues in her paper on temple conversions in Karnataka, the Lingayats appropriated and reused the Doddappa Temple at Adargunchi, Karnataka. Built sometime between 10th and 11th centuries, the temple today is fronted by a stone sculpture of the bull Nandi (Shiva’s vehicle) and houses a massive black stone statue of a Jina, placed alongside a Shiva linga (phallus, the form in which Lingayats worship Shiva).<br />
Save the image of the Jina, the entire temple was extensively rebuilt during the Virashaiva takeover of the basadi. Instead of destroying/mutilating the Jina statue, it was retained and painted with parallel white lines on the forehead, arms, shoulders and chest, an imitation in paint of the sacred white ash the Virashaivas often smear themselves with. The idea was to retain the statue as a “sign of domination and control” thereby sending a clear signal of Virashaiva’s triumph over Jainism.<br />
Another interesting example of such a reuse comes from the Megudi temple at Hallur, Karnataka. Here, as opposed to Aadargunchi, the temple was converted in situ, sans any extensive rebuilding.<br />
Constructed between the 7th and 9th centuries, the Megudi temple was reused as a Virashaiva shrine sometime in the 12th century. Here the Jina idol was uprooted from garbagriha, smeared with sacred Virashaiva ash, and placed in the central aisle that now leads to the sanctum sanctorum housing the Shiva linga. Such a placement of uprooted idol ensured that every devotee approaching the inner chamber would see the displaced Jina and be aware of the Virashaiva “annexation” of the temple.<br />
To further bolster the “conquered image” of the temple, two sculptures of the Jina adorning the main entrance have also been significantly disfigured even though all the other sculptures, inside and outside the temple, have been kept intact. Appropriations, as glaring as the above mentioned examples, must have inspired significant awe in the newly converted followers of Virashaivism and deep anxiety in the Jains.</p>

<p>&#8220;Scholars agreed that the inner first and second galleries, which contain narrative panels depicting Hindu scences, might have been carved at a later time possibly during the reign of Jayavarman VIII (r. 1243-1295) who was a bigoted Hindu king to have reputedly converted the Bayon into a Hindu temple and also damaged many other Buddhist buildings.&#8221; Roveda 1998: 131-150 as mentioned in Buddhist Architecture, By Le Huu Phuoc, p.263, Grafikol, 2010</p>

<p>&#8220;Not only theoretically did the Hindus attack Buddhism, but the hundreds of Buddhist monks were slaughtered, their temples destroyed and &#8221;the massacre of thousands of Bhuddist families was ordered by the sixth century c.e, Hindu king&#8221; Mihirakulu.[Heritage of Kashmir pg 58 by Muhammad Amin Pandit ]&#8221; Numerous Buddhist temples were taken over by the Brahmins, the most prominent being the shrine of Pas Pahar atop the Takht i Sulaiman overlooking the Dal Lake in Srinagar, Which was renamed the Shankaracharya temple and was dedicated to Jyesteswara or Shiva. The HIndu King Nara is said to have burnt down thousands of (Buddhist) Viharas [Islamic culture in Kashmir p.43, By G.M.D. Sofi]. Brahmanical hostility against the Buddhists persisted even in the period of Muslim rule. Thus, we learn that Udayagiri, the Brahmin Prime minister of Sultan Shahabuddin suggested to the king that to overcome his fiscal crisis he should loot the Buddhist temples and melt their idols to make coins. The King, however, responded with &#8221;indignation at this suggestion.&#8221;[Islamic culture in Kashmir p.139, By G.M.D. Sofi] But on the other hand, Muslim rulers allowed religious freedom and some of them even collected &#8221;books on the puranas, logic and Mimansa from different parts of India at considerable expense. These books were placed at the disposal of the scholars.

<p>&#8220;Shri K. R. Srinivasan has confirmed that what is now known as Anantasayangudi cave temple in Undavali was a temple of Vishnukundin times and originally a Buddhist temple which was converted to a Vishnu temple. [p. 33 and 81, &#8216;Temples of South India&#8217;] <a href="http://www.ambedkar.org/research/Rajput_Period_Was_Dark_Age_Of_India.htm" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">http://www.ambedkar.org/research/Rajput_Period_Was_Dark_Age_Of_India.htm<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>&#8220;Buddhist shrines were converted into Brahmincal ones, and Brahmincal legends called Kshetra Puranas, were engrafted on the Buddhist legends, and found a place in the Brahmanda and Skanda Puranas. Gayu, Bhuvaneswari, Sanchi, Puri, all come under the same category. Coming to Southern India, we have the well known places Tirupati and Conjeceram abaring in the same fate, the Buddhist phase of Tirupati having been an image of Padmapani, the Padma (lotus) being now covered by a Kavaeha (Sheath), while the image itself is passing by the name of Srinivasn. This fact was first known about 1850 to the employes in the inner part of the temple, when some parts of the Kaveha haing become too much loosened, had to undergo repairs. The real nature was at once discovered. But the matter was kept a profounf secret. Now are the Saiva temples of Conjeveram any way better; Conheveram, which had during the time of Hioun Thsand so many as 10000 Buddhist Bhikshus and about 100 Sangharanas, had its Sangharamas converted in the course of three following centuries into Saiva temples during the reign of Saiva kings. Even to day, a Jaina Buddhist temple is seen in a village two miles off, but which once formed part of it with a number of Jains living there and a large number of Buddhist statues are scattered about in the Saiva temples. The history of Indian temples architecture shows that most of these temples the exceptions are very few have undergone three stages: first, they were Buddhistic, then they became Saivite, ad lastly they were Vaishnava temples.&#8221; The Theosophist May 1891 to September 1891 By H.

<p>&#8220;According to Dr. Jayaprakash, a number of Buddha statues have been discovered at places like Ambalapuzha, Karunagapalli, Pallickal, Bharanikkavu, Mavelikara and Neelamperur in Kerala. &#8216;They are either in the form of smashed pieces or thrown away from viharas. Lord Ayyappa of Sabarimala and Lord Padmanabha at Thiruvananthapuram are the proxy images of Buddha being worshipped as Vishnu. Hundreds of Buddhists were killed on the banks of Aluva river. The term &#8216;Aluva&#8217; was derived from &#8216;Alawai&#8217; which means &#8216;Trisul&#8217;, a weapon used by Hindu fanatics to stab Buddhists. Similarly, on the banks of the Vaigai river in Tamilnadu, thousands of Buddhists were killed by the Vaishnava Saint, Sambanthar. Thevaram, a Tamil book, documents this brutal extermination of Buddhism.&#8217; <a href="http://www.milligazette.com/Archives/15042001/Art06.htm" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">http://www.milligazette.com/Archives/15042001/Art06.htm<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">HINDU KINGS PLUNDERING HINDU TEMPLES</span></strong></p>
<p>Muslim rulers like Mahmud Ghazni looting Somnath is seen as religious extremism but what will Hindutvadis call this?</p>
<p>&#8220;There are instances of Hindu rulers destroying temples in order to loot their wealth, such as Harshadeva of Kashmir, who defiled and looted temples and even had a special officer whose function was to seize the icons of tribal shine, and in Bodhgaya a Buddhist Vihara was destroyed by Sasanka in the 6th C to build a Hindu temple which still exists.&#8221; Sampradayikta Virodhi Andolan, Black Sunday. December 1992 p.2 as mentioned in Religion und Gewalt: Konflikte, Rituale, Deutungen (1500-1800), edited by Kaspar von Greyerz, Kim Siebenhüner, p.72, Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 2006</p>
<p>Harsha, a ruler of Kashmir (1089-1111AD), plundered all the temples in his own kingdom, barring four, in order to replenish his treasury, and not a word of protest was uttered. He destroyed both Hindu and Buddhist temples, and is credited with creating an office of &#8220;devotpaatana-nayaka&#8221;, destroyer of gods. Reference &#8221; Rajatarangini&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;The plunder of temples was carried out by kings irrespective of their religion. Temples were repositories of wealth. An ideological fig leaf was taken from religion to justify the desecration. Temples were plundered by the Marathas in Tipu&#8217;s Sultante. The Shirangapatanam temple was destroyed by the Maratha armies and was repaired by Tipu Sultan. Attacking the temple was also a way of Humiliting the other kings&#8230; Temples were also looted by ing Harsha of kashmir in the 11th century. A mention of this is found in Kalhan&#8217;s book Rajtarangini, which syas that he appointed a special officer to uproot the golden idols from the temples. This offiver was designated as devotpatan naya&#8217;s (officer who uproots the Gods). Parmar Kings (Shubharvarnman a.d 1193-1210) destroyed Jain temples in Cambay and Dabhoi in addition to plundering temples in his own kingdom.&#8221; Communal Politics: Fact versus Myth, p.52, By Ram Puniyani</p>

<h2><a id="zoroastrianism"></a>Intolerance towards Zoroastrianism</h2>
<p>There is no direct reference made to Zoroastrianism in Hindu scriptures. But in the Vedas, the Asuras are depicted as villains, in Zoroastrian text Ahura is god and in the Vedas Asuras are demons. In Vedas, Devas are gods while in Zoroastrian text Daevas are demons. Zoroastrian text also speaks about the Aryan country. This suggests that Vedic religion and Zoroastrianism are approximate of the same age and there was a war between Aryans and Zoroastrians. Vedas speaks about killing the Asuras, and Zoroastrian texts also speak about killing Daevas by thousands. Zoroastrian text speaks of several Daevas but not all those Daevas are mentioned in Vedas. Daeva in Zoroastrianism may mean all evils and not just the Aryans. Only a few Devas (Vedic gods) like Mitra, Yama, Indra, etc., can be found in both Vedas and Zoroastrian texts, but these gods are viewed as heroes in the Zoroastrian text who sided with the Zoroastrians against Aryans. I won&#8217;t indulge further on this topic as it is related to the Aryan invasion/migration and a separate article would be appropriate to discus this.</p>
<p>As the proverb goes &#8216;History is written by the victors&#8217;. Learning about Asuras and Devas in Vedas would be one-sided we have to look at the other side also to get a better understanding of what really may have happened. Asuras are demonized and depicted like villains in the Vedas, but are the Devas depicted as heroes in Zoroastrian texts? Let&#8217;s have a look at some Zoroastrian verses,</p>
<p>Ushtavad Gatha, Yasna 44 verse 20 &#8220;I ask Thee, O Mazda, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">How it is possible for the Daevas to become kind severance, the persons who fight for their selfish ends and for satisfying their wishes. The have flung all earth to hatred and anger</span> with the help of Kavis, Karapans and Usikhsh (2). Would they ever strive to cause the advance and security of the world through Asha and bring about peace and love for all.&#8221; Tr. Mobed Firouz Azargoshasb</p>
<p>Ahunuvaita Gatha Yasna 30 Verse 6 &#8220;The followers of Daeva (or Devil worshippers) did not choose the right path, because they were in doubt and were deceived. Hence, they did not choose the right path but followed the worst thought, the devil or anger, which is the cause of all evil deeds, so as to destroy the mental life of the people.&#8221; Tr. Mobed Firouz Azargoshasb</p>
<p>Yasna 12.4 &#8220;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">I reject the authority of the Daevas, the wicked, no-good, lawless, evil-knowing, the most druj-like of beings, the foulest of beings, the most damaging of beings</span>. I reject the Daevas and their comrades, I reject the yatu and their comrades; <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">I reject any who harm beings</span>. I reject them with my thoughts, words, and deeds. I reject them publicly. Even as I reject the [evil authorities], so too do I reject the hostile followers of the druj.&#8221; Tr. J.H. Peterson</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Daevas were oppressors</span></strong></p>
<p>Frawardin Yasht 13.57 &#8220;We worship the good, strong, beneficent Fravashis of the faithful, who showed their paths to the stars, the moon, the sun, and the endless lights, that had stood before for a long time in the same place, without moving forwards, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">through the oppression of the Daevas and the assaults of the Daevas</span>.&#8221; Tr. James Darmesteter</p>
<p>Frawardin Yasht 13.130 &#8220;We worship the Fravashi of the holy Yima, the son of Vivanghant; the valiant Yima, who had flocks at his wish; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">to stand against the oppression caused by the Daevas</span>, against the drought that destroys pastures, and against death that creeps unseen.&#8221; Tr. James Darmesteter</p>
<p>Aban Yasht 5.58 &#8220;They begged of her a boon, saying: &#8220;Grant us this, O good, most beneficent Ardvi Sura Anahita! that we may overcome the valiant warrior Tusa, and that we may smite of the Aryan people their fifties and their hundreds, their hundreds and their thousands, their thousands and their tens of thousands, their tens of thousands and their myriads of myriads.&#8221; Tr. James Darmesteter</p>
<p>Warharan Yasht 14.60 &#8220;That I may be as constantly victorious as any one of all the Aryans; that I may smite this army, that I may smite down this army, that I may cut in pieces this army that is coming behind me.&#8221; Tr. James Darmesteter</p>

<h2><a id="dasyus"></a>Intolerance towards Dasyus</h2>
<p>When you read the Vedas you will find that there were other tribes also in the Vedic period who followed different religions and customs. And many times Aryans used to attack them mainly for the purpose of plundering them which is evident from the plunder and massacre of Kikata and Panis tribes which I have mentioned in <a href="https://vedkabhed.wordpress.com/2014/05/15/killing-infidels-in-vedas/" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Killing infidels in Vedas<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> article. Yaska Acharya defines Dasyu as,</p>
<p>Nirukta 7.23 Dasyu (demon) is derived from (the root) das, meaning to lay waste.</p>
<p>Swami Dayanand Saraswati defines Dasyu as wicked one. Veda says that the Dasyus followed a different religion, they did not sacrifice, and they are also called godless. Maybe they had atheistic philosophies like Buddhists. Veda explicitly commands the Aryans to kill and plunder Dasyus because of the difference in faith. I have used Hindi translations by Pandit Ram Govind Trivedi and Shri Ram Sharma Acharya,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.105.8 Grind off our sins: with song <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">will we conquer the men who sing no hymns</span>: Not easily art thou pleased with prayerless sacrifice.<br />

<p>Dasyus not offering oblation to Vedic gods, not sacrificing, being riteless, without worship and rituals are emphasized, the difference in faith is emphasized in the Vedas which means that one of the main reasons for killing Dasyus was their religion.</p>

<h2><a id="gods-murderers"></a>Hindu gods are murderers</h2>
<p>Hindu gods killed many innocent people. Hindu gods are said to have taken birth on earth in flesh and bone to guide people, a god was engaged in a lecherous activity, and another one was engaged in getting back his wife for over a decade. I really don&#8217;t know what message they left for humanity. Hindu gods are depicted wielding weapons with fierce facial expressions. Many times innocent blood was shed with those weapons. Here are some stories about Hindu gods killing innocent people, I will start with Vishnu and his avatars. Let&#8217;s have a look at the words of the demon,</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">VISHNU</span></strong></p>
<p>Matsya Purana 178.6-22 &#8221;He is my enemy. He is the destroyer of my elders, He lived in the oceans, destroyed the demons Madhu and Kaitabha. It can be said that as long as he lives, the war between us will not end. There will be a most fearful fight between Him and me. He has killed many demons in this battle. He is very cruel. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">He has not shown His clemency even to the children and the woman of the demons killed</span>. He is shameless. He is Visnu. He is the heaven of the Devas. He sleeps on the Sesa serpent&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, Edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>Demons in Hindu scriptures don&#8217;t necessarily mean beings with monstrous looks. Some non-Vedic tribes were considered demons in Hindu scriptures. We read here that Vishnu killed women and children of the enemy demons. Vishnu on being urged by Indra is said to have beheaded the wife of sage Bhrigu and Bhrigu cursed Vishnu to take incarnations on earth.</p>
<p>Valmiki Ramayana, Uttara Kanda, chapter 51. &#8220;Learn, O king, what happened formerly during the conflict between the Devas and Asuras. The Daityas, whom the Suras threatened, took refuge with the consort of Bhrigu and she, having given them a haven, they dwelt there in safety. Seeing them thus succoured, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">the Chief of the gods, enraged with his sharp-edged discus severed the head of Bhrigu&#8217;s wife</span>. Beholding the murder of his consort, Bhrigu, in his wrath, instantly cursed Vishnu, the destroyer of enemy hosts, saying:- &#8216;Since in thine insensate fury, thou has slain my spouse, who should never have died thus, thou shalt take birth in the world of men, O Janardana, and there thou shall live separated from thy consort for many years.&#8221; Tr. Hari Prasad Shastri</p>
<p>Matsya Purana Part I, 47.101-105 &#8220;At that, both Indra and Visnu were overcome with fear and began to contrive some means of escape. Visnu said to Indra:- &#8216;How shall we escape from her?&#8217; Indra replied:- &#8216;Lord! kill her before she consumed me. I am solely protected by you, destroy her soon without delay.&#8217; Visnu thought over the great sin of killing a woman, in spite of that, he took up his Sudarsana Chakra to free Himself from that impending calamity. Trembling with fear, on thinking over the consequences of her anger and being afraid of the consequences of His own wrath, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">He severed her head with His Chakra</span>. The sage Bhrigu then cursed Visnu for killing his wife.&#8221; Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>As per Brahmanda Purana 2.3.72.139-140 Vishnu pierced her head with his weapon and cut it into three parts. The context of this story is that. There was a battle between demons and Devas. Demons suffered a huge loss at the hands of the Devas and only a few demons survived so they wanted to take shelter and Shukra asked the Daityas to take refuge in his father&#8217;s house till he gets a boon from Shiva to defeat the Devas. So Daityas took shelter with the wife of sage Bhrigu who assured them safety. But Indra and Vishnu arrived there to kill Daityas but Shukra&#8217;s mother resisted the attack as she possessed powers and was going to burn up Indra and Vishnu so Indra asked Vishnu to kill her and Vishnu beheads her with his Sudarshan Chakra, Bhrigu arrived at the house and finds his wife killed by Vishnu and he curses Vishnu. As per Devi Bhagavatam Vishnu resurrects Bhrigu&#8217;s wife but as per Matsya Purana 1.47.108-111 Bhrigu resurrects his own wife. Vishnu and Indra could&#8217;ve fled from the spot or paralyzed her but they killed her. There&#8217;s a verse in Bhagavad Purana which says that Vishnu&#8217;s Sudarshan Chakra causes miscarriages of demons&#8217; wives,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 5.24.15 When the Sudarśana disc enters those provinces, the pregnant wives of the demons all have miscarriages due to fear of its effulgence.&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">VAMANA</span></strong></p>
<p>There was an Asura king named Mahabali who was a just and noble king. But to secure the kingship of Devas, Vamana avatar of Vishnu killed him and sent him to the lower world. This is mentioned in Srimad Bhagavatam Canto  8 chapters 18-20</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PARASHURAMA</span></strong></p>
<p>Parashurama was the sixth avatar of Vishnu. He is said to have beheaded his own mother Renuka as well as his brothers on the command of his father Jamadagni. Parashurama&#8217;s name in Mahabharata also appears as Rama, so do not confuse this Rama with Rama the killer of Ravana,</p>
<p>Mahabharata Vana Parva 3.116.13-14 &#8220;And then Rama, the slayer of hostile heroes, came to the hermitage, last of all. Him the mighty-armed Jamadagni, of great austerities, addressed, saying, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">&#8216;Kill this wicked mother of thine, without compunction, O my son.&#8217; Thereupon Rama immediately took up an axe and therewith severed his mother&#8217;s head</span>.&#8221; Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>The context of the story is that Renuka went to bathe and on her return, she happened to see King Chitraratha of Martikavata copulating with his wives, she was inspired with desire, and when she returned to the hermitage her husband Jamdagni came to know about it so he ordered his sons to kill her, they refused but Parshurama on the command of his father beheaded his mother. Jamadagni also told Parashurama to kill his brothers as they refused his command and Parashurama obeying his father&#8217;s command killed his brothers as well. But on Parashurama&#8217;s request to Jamadagni, his mother Renuka and brothers were brought back to life and Parashurama also requested that his mother and brothers shall not remember anything.</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 9.16.6 &#8220;Jamadagni then ordered his youngest son, Paraśurāma, to kill his brothers, who had disobeyed this order, and his mother, who had mentally committed adultery. Lord Paraśurāma, knowing the power of his father, who was practiced in meditation and austerity, killed his mother and brothers immediately.&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana 2.3.23.65 has an indirect reference to Parashurama&#8217;s killing of his own mother.</p>
<p>What was the sin of Renuka? That she was sexually aroused seeing the sexual intercourse of a king! Surely what she did was sinful but not so much that she deserved to be beheaded by her son the sixth incarnation of Vishnu. And Hindu god Parashurama also beheaded his mother without any hesitation.</p>
<p>Parashurama annihilated the entire Kshatriya race because his father was killed by Kartavirya Arjuna who belonged to the Kshatriya caste. He is said to have killed Kshatriyas twenty-one times,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 9.16.10 &#8220;Once when Paraśurāma left the āśrama for the forest with Vasumān and his other brothers, the sons of Kārtavīryārjuna took the opportunity to approach Jamadagni&#8217;s residence to seek vengeance for their grudge. The sons of Kārtavīryārjuna were determined to commit sinful deeds. Therefore when they saw Jamadagni sitting by the side of the fire to perform yajña and meditating upon the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is praised by the best of selected prayers, they took the opportunity to kill him. With pitiable prayers, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Reṇukā, the mother of Paraśurāma and wife of Jamadagni, begged for the life of her husband. But the sons of Kārtavīryārjuna, being devoid of the qualities of kṣatriyas, were so cruel that despite her prayers they forcibly cut off his head and took it away</span>.&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 9.16.16 Thus lamenting, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Lord Paraśurāma entrusted his father&#8217;s dead body to his brothers and personally took up his axe, having decided to put an end to all the kṣatriyas on the surface of the world</span>. [18-19] With the blood of the bodies of these sons, Lord Paraśurāma created a ghastly river, which brought great fear to the kings who had no respect for brahminical culture. Because the kṣatriyas, the men of power in government, were performing sinful activities, Lord Paraśurāma, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">on the plea of retaliating for the murder of his father, rid all the kṣatriyas from the face of the earth twenty-one times</span>. Indeed, in the place known as Samanta-pañcaka he created nine lakes filled with their blood.&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Brahma Purana 104.110-111 &#8220;The Earth where crores of Ksatriyas remained scattered about, the Earth that is adorned by the mountains Meru and Mandara was rid of Ksatriyas twentyone times by the lord. After making the Earth devoid of Ksatriyas, Parasurama of great fame performed a horse sacrifice in order to dispel his sins.&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Mahabharata Adi Parva 1.2.1-7 &#8220;The Rishis said, &#8216;O son of Suta, we wish to hear a full and circumstantial account of the place mentioned by you as Samanta-panchaya.'&#8221;Sauti said, &#8216;Listen, O ye Brahmanas, to the sacred descriptions I utter O ye best of men, ye deserve to hear of the place known as Samanta-panchaka. In the interval between the Treta and Dwapara Yugas, Rama (the son of Jamadagni) great among all who have borne arms, urged by impatience of wrongs, repeatedly smote the noble race of Kshatriyas. And when that fiery meteor, by his own valour, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">annihilated the entire tribe of the Kshatriyas, he formed at Samanta-panchaka five lakes of blood</span>. We are told that his reason being overpowered by anger he offered oblations of blood to the manes of his ancestors, standing in the midst of the sanguine waters of those lakes. It was then that his forefathers of whom Richika was the first having arrived there addressed him thus, &#8216;O Rama, O blessed Rama, O offspring of Bhrigu, we have been gratified with the reverence thou hast shown for thy ancestors and with thy valour …&#8221; Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Parashurama burned up the entire city along with the inhabitants</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana 2.3.46.20-26 &#8220;A battle took place once again between Rama and the kings, wherein the infuriated sage of high intellect, killed a hundred kings. After killing Surasena and others along with their armies and vehicles, he made the entire group of Ksatriyas fall on the ground in a moment. The kings who survived, whose wishes had been frustrated and whose vehicles and armies has been killed fled in all directions. After routing the armies, killing the enemies and winning the battle, Rama killed hundreds of kings and heroes by means of the fire from his excellent arrows. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Overwhelmed with fury and desirous of burning the entire city</span>, Bhargava discharged a missile that had a lustre similar to that of Kalagni (the fire of world-destruction). <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The fire from that missile burned the city along with elephants, horses and men</span>. The flames enveloped the clusters of the entire rampart-wall of the city.  On seeing the city being burned and desirous of saving his own life, Prince Virihotra became frightened and fled quickly for the sake of life.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>How is it possible that all the Kshatriyas in the world were engaged in sinful activities? As I said earlier, everything Hindu gods didn&#8217;t like is demonized in Hindu scriptures. Parashurama killed all Kshatriyas to avenge his father&#8217;s murder by a few Kshatriya.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">KRISHNA</span></strong></p>
<p>Krishna beheaded a washerman just because he refused to give him clothes and spoke rudely,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 10.41.36-37 &#8220;Fools, get out of here quickly! Don&#8217;t beg like this if You want to stay alive. When someone is too bold, the King&#8217;s men arrest him and kill him and take all his property. As the washerman thus spoke brazenly, the son of Devaki became angry, and <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">then merely with His fingertips He separated the man&#8217;s head from his body</span>.&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The slaughter of </span><span style="color: #000000;">the </span><span style="color: #000000;">washerman is summarized in Bravaivarta Purana, Krishna Janma Khanda 132.62-75 and also mentioned in Agni Purana 12.23. Krishna and Balrama visited the city Mathura. And a washerman was passing by so they asked him</span><span style="color: #000000;"> to give them</span><span style="color: #000000;"> some clothes that belonged to the King. From the words of the washerman</span><span style="color: #000000;">,</span><span style="color: #000000;"> it appears that he thought Krishna and Balram</span><span style="color: #000000;">a to be wanderers. So he plainly</span><span style="color: #000000;"> refused </span><span style="color: #000000;">to give clothes. This story sounds</span><span style="color: #000000;"> same </span><span style="color: #000000;">as</span><span style="color: #000000;"> the crimes we read where thieves kill people to take their possessions. After beheading the washerman Krishna and Balrama took the clothes.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Krishna couldn&#8217;t bear criticism. He beheaded King Shishupala just because he abused him. Pandavas were performing sacrifice at Indraprastha where Shishupala was also present and he was beheaded there.</span></p>
<p>Padma Purana VI.252.13-20 &#8220;All those, protected by Krsna, having saluted and praised Krsna, went to their respective countries. Then, going to Indraprastha with the two (i.e. Bhima and Arjuna), Krsna made Yudhisthira perform the Rajasuya sacrifice. There, after the sacrifice was over, the chief honour was given to Krsna with the consent of Bhisma. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">There </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Sisupala spoke many abusive words to Krsna. Krsna too cut off his head with the Sudarsana (disc)</span>&#8230;&#8221; Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 10.74.39-44 &#8220;Upon hearing such intolerable blasphemy of the Lord, several members of the assembly covered their ears and walked out, angrily cursing the King of Cedi. Anyone who fails to immediately leave the place where he hears criticism of the Supreme Lord or His faithful devotee will certainly fall down, bereft of his pious credit. Then the sons of Pāṇḍu became furious, and together with the warriors of the Matsya, Kaikaya and Sṛñjaya clans, they rose up from their seats with weapons poised, ready to kill Śiśupāla. Undaunted, Śiśupāla then took up his sword and shield in the midst of all the assembled kings, O Bhārata, and hurled insults at those who sided with Lord Kṛṣṇa. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">At that point the Supreme Lord stood up and checked His devotees. He then angrily sent forth His razor-sharp disc and severed the head of His enemy</span> as he was attacking. When Śiśupāla was thus killed, a great roar and howl went up from the crowd. Taking advantage of that disturbance, the few kings who were supporters of Śiśupāla quickly left the assembly out of fear for their lives.&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>As you may know that Krishna was killed accidentally by a hunter named Jara. Although Jara murdered Krishna and can&#8217;t be called innocent but this contradicts modern Hindus&#8217; statement that Krishna was very merciful. Even after begging for mercy Krishna took revenge and killed Jara but awarded him entry to heaven,</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 5.37.60-69 “Respecting the words of the Brahman, the imprecation of Durvásas, the illustrious Krishńa sat engaged in thought, resting his foot upon his knee. Then came there a hunter, named Jará, whose arrow was tipped with a blade made of the piece of iron of the club, which had not been reduced to powder; and beholding from a distance the foot of Krishńa, he mistook it for part of a deer, and shooting his arrow, lodged it in the sole. Approaching his mark, he saw the four-armed king, and, falling at his feet, repeatedly besought his forgiveness, exclaiming, “I have done this deed unwittingly, thinking I was aiming at a deer! Have pity upon me, who am consumed by my crime; for thou art able to consume me!” Bhagavat replied, “Fear not thou in the least. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Go, hunter, through my favour, to heaven, the abode of the gods.” As soon as he had thus spoken, a celestial car appeared, and the hunter, ascending it, forthwith proceeded to heaven</span>.” Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-size: 12pt;">Balrama</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Balarama is sometime</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">s</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> conside</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">red an avatar of Vishnu. As per </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Hindu text</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">s</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">, Balarama was addicted to gambling. Balarama is said to have played dice with Rukmi the brother</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">-in-</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">law of Krishna. It is said that Rukmi wanted to avenge the elopement of his sister Rukmini by Krishna so he challenged Balarama the brother of Krishna in the game of dice who accepted it without hesitation though he wasn’t an expert at it. Balarama lost many bets to Rukmi but won the final bet which was very big. Then an argument ensued between Rukmi and </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Balarama that Balarama had cheated him (Rukmi) and that Rukmi is the real winner. Balarama couldn’t tolerate this so he killed Rukmi for such </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">a </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">petty argument,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Vishnu Purana 5.23</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">.10-28</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> “After the wedding had been solemnized, several of the kings, headed by him of Kalinga, said to Rukmin, “This wielder of the ploughshare is ignorant of the dice, which may be converted into his misfortune: why may we not contend with him, and beat him, in play?” The potent Rukmin replied to them, and said, “So let it be:” and he engaged Balaráma at a game of dice in the palace. Balaráma soon lost to Rukmin a thousand Nishkas: he then staked and lost another thousand; and then pledged ten thousand, which Rukmin, who was well skilled in gambling, also won. At this the king of Kalinga laughed aloud, and the weak and exulting Rukmin grinned, and said, “Baladeva is losing, for he knows nothing of the game; although, blinded by a vain passion for play, he thinks he understands the dice.” Halayudha, galled by the broad laughter of the Kalinga prince, and the contemptuous speech of Rukmin, was exceedingly angry, and, overcome with passion, increased his stake to ten millions of Nishkas. Rukmin accepted the challenge, and therefore threw the dice. Baladeva won, and cried aloud, “The stake is mine.” But Rukmin called out as loudly, that he was the winner. “Tell no lies, Bala,” said he: “the stake is yours; that is true; but I did not agree to it: although this be won by you, yet still I am the winner.” A deep voice was then heard in the sky, inflaming still more the anger of the high-spirited Baladeva, saying, “Bala has rightly won the whole sum, and Rukmin speaks falsely: although he did not accept the pledge in words, he did so by his acts (having cast the dice).” </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000; font-size: 12pt;">Balaráma thus excited, his eyes red with rage, started up, and struck Rukmin with the board on which the game was played, and killed him</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">… When Krishńa heard that Rukmin had been killed by his brother, he made no remark, being afraid of Rukminí on the one hand, and of Bala on the other…”</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> Tr.

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">RAMA</span></strong></p>
<p>Rama beheaded a Shudra named Shambuka because that Shudra was practicing penance that may have included chanting some Vedic Mantras.</p>
<p>Ramayana of Valmiki, Uttara Kanda 7, Chapters 75-76 &#8221;On this that Prince born of Raghu approached the one who had given himself up to rigorous practices and said:- &#8221;Blessed art thou, O Ascetic, who art faithful to thy vows! <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">From what caste art thou sprung</span>, O Thou who hast grown old in mortification and who art established in heroism. I am interested in this matter, I Rama, the son of Dasaratha. What purpose hast thou in view? Is it heaven or some other object? What boon dost thou seek by means of this hard penance? I wish to know what thou desirest in performing these austerities, O Ascetic. May prosperity attend thee! <span style="color: #ff0000;">Art thou a brahmin? Art thou an invincible Kshatriya? Art thou a Vaishya, one of the third caste or art thou a Shudra</span>? Answer me truthfully!&#8221;&#8230;Hearing the words of Rama of imperishable exploits, that ascetic, his head still hanging downwards, answered:- <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">&#8221;O Rama, I was born of a Shudra alliance and I am performing this rigorous penance in order to acquire the status of a God in this body</span>. I am not telling a lie, O Rama, I wish to attain the Celestial Region. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Know that I am a Shudra and my name is Shambuka</span>.&#8221; <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">As he was yet speaking, Raghava, drawing his brilliant and stainless sword from its scabbard, cut off his head</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Shudra being slain</span>, all the Gods and their leaders with Agni&#8217;s followers, cried out, &#8221;Well done! Well done!&#8221; overwhelming Rama with praise, and a rain of celestial flowers of divine fragrance fell on all sides, scattered by Vayu.&#8221; Tr. Hari Prasad Shastri</p>
<p>Ramayana of Valmiki, Uttara Kanda 7, Chapters 75-76 &#8220;O Kakutstha be happy! This very day that child has received new life and has been restored to his parents. The child was resuscited at the instant that the head of the Shudra fell.&#8221; Tr. Hari Prasad Shastri</p>
<p>A Brahmin boy died in Ram&#8217;s kingdom so Rama went out to find the cause of this death signifying that there must be some unrighteous thing going on that led to the death of this boy. So Rama found Shambuka who was hanging upside down from a tree performing vigorous penance. Ram asked his caste and reason for his penance and beheaded him. Some apologists say that Rama beheaded Shambuka because Shambuka was performing penance to acquire a boon for an evil purpose. If Shambuka was slain for that then why wasn&#8217;t Ravana beheaded too? Is that because Ravana was a Brahmin and Shambuka was a Shuda? Shambuka in this passage clearly said that he is performing penance to acquire the status of God in his body. He wasn&#8217;t performing it with some evil intention. If he was lying and Rama already knew his intention then why did he first enquired and then beheaded him? Why didn&#8217;t he just go there and behead him? Rama asked Shambuka&#8217;s caste, Shambuka reiterated that he is a Shudra. Shudra caste is emphasized here which means that Rama beheaded him because a Shudra should not perform such penance.</p>
<p>Lakshmana on the command of Rama is said to have cut off the nose and ears of Ravana&#8217;s sister Shurpanakha who had approached Rama expressing her love for him.</p>
<p>Valmiki Ramayana, Aranya Kanda 3.18.20-21 &#8220;She is freakish, knavish and overtly ruttish, oh, tigerly man, it will be apt of you to deface this paunchy demoness&#8221; Thus Rama said to Lakshmana. Thus said to that mighty Lakshmana he infuriately drew sword and chopped off her ears and nose before the very eyes of Rama.&#8221; Tr. Desi Raju Hanumanth Rao</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 10.47.17 &#8221;He is so very wily that in his incarnation as Rama, he had killed the king of monkeys, (Vali) like a hunter. Also, being brought under the control of his wife he cut off the nose of a woman Shurpanakha by name, who had come to him being stricken with amorous desire.&#8221; Tr. J.M. Sanyal</p>
<p>Also mentioned in Agni Purana 7.5</p>
<p>In the next life, Shurpanakha is incarnated as Kubja the hunchback woman and Rama as Krishna and these two had an illicit relationship which I have mentioned in <a href="https://vedkabhed.wordpress.com/2014/12/27/hinduism-and-lust/" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Hinduism and Lust<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> article.</p>
<p>Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Krishna Janma Khanda 115.93-102 &#8220;Kubja, in her previous birth, was the sister of the wicked Ravana. Her name was Surpanakha. Actuated by lust, she desired the society of Rama. Lakshamana, the chief of the pious men, cut off her nose&#8230;.&#8221; Tr. Various Sanskrit Scholars, Edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>It is said that Shurpanakha was going to kill Sita. There is another version that says that when Shurpanakha approached Rama, he asked her to go to Lakshman and then Lakshman cut off her nose and ears. But the story in Ramayana seems more authentic. Lakshman cutting off the nose and ears of Ravan&#8217;s sister is what provoked Ravana to revenge. It&#8217;s quite funny that Ravana is demonized despite being a Brahmin and Shiva&#8217;s ardent devotee just because he abducted Ram&#8217;s wife Sita. But Hindu gods raping and abducting women doesn&#8217;t make them villains. I say Shurpanakha was lucky enough to have only her ears and nose cut off. There is a story of another woman being deformed by Lakshmana who approached Lakshamana to express her love,</p>
<p>Valmiki Ramayana Aranya Kanda 3.69.15-17 &#8220;Closeting Soumitri in her embrace she told him this sentence, &#8220;I am Ayomukhi, by my name&#8230; you won me by your heroic personality, by that way, none can win me over&#8230; thus, you alone are my lover&#8230; oh, hero, oh, my husband&#8230; you will romance with me on mountaintops, in rivers, and on sandy isles, till the end of this life&#8230;&#8221; So is the love prattle of that demoness Ayomukhi. When said that way that enemy-suppressor <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Lakshmana became furious, and upraising his sword he sheared off her nose, one ear, and one of her breasts</span>.&#8221; Tr. Desi Raju Hanumanth Rao</p>
<p>Now some people may say that this is the same story with variations in names. The name of the woman here is Ayomukhi whereas in the same Valmiki Ramayana Surpanakha appears to be the name of Ravana&#8217;s sister. So the same variation cannot occur in the same text. Shurpanakha expressed her love for Rama while Ayomukhi expressed her love for Lakshmana, also there is no mention of cutting up Shurpanakha&#8217;s breast but this story does. Most important of all, the mutilation of Ayomukhi occurred after Sita was abducted while Shurpanakha&#8217;s mutilation happened before Ravana abducted Sita. Poor lady Ayomukhi&#8217;s ears, nose and breast were cut off by the cruel Lakshman just because she expressed her love.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">HANUMAN</span></strong></p>
<p>In the Valmiki Ramayana Hanuman is said to have burnt up Lanka along with its inhabitants. The word demon is used to describe the people of Lanka. As you may know, Non-Hindus were considered demons, just go to Sri Lanka and let’s see whether you find humans or demons there. The verses also show that the Lankans amassed great wealth,</p>
<p>Valmiki Ramayana Sundara Khanda 5, Sarga 54, Verses 24- “The demons, who were running hither and thither to protect their houses and who lost their spirits and abundant wealth, created a tumultuous nose, saying &#8220;Alas! The fire-god has come really in a form of this monkey! <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Some women crying and carrying their suckling&#8217;s</span> with their hair dishevelled, fell down from their houses, which were enveloped with fire, and shone like flashes of lightning falling from clouds in the sky. As the fire does not get satisfied with any amount of firewood and straw fed to it, Hanuma was not wearied in killing any number of demons. The earth was not then wearied in receiving the number of demons killed by Hanuma (in her lap).” Tr. K.M.K. Murthy</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">KALKI</span></strong></p>
<p>According to Hindu texts, Kalki avatar kills Shudra kings, Buddhists and heretics, he also plunders them,</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.58.76-83 &#8220;He will be called Pramiti. He was born of a part of Visnu formerly in the Svayambhuva Manvantara. He wandered over the earth for full twenty years. He led an army consisting of cavalry, chariots and elephants. He was surrounded by hundreds and thousands of Brahmanas armed with weapons. He killed Mlecchas in thousands. He went everywhere. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">After killing the kings born of Sudra women, he exterminated the heretics</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">He killed thousands of persons who were not religious and righteous. He killed those born of mixed castes as well as those who depended on them</span>. He killed the Udicyas (northerners), Madya Desyas (people of the Middle Land), mountain-dwellers, easterners, westerners, dwellers in Vindhya and Aparanta. He killed the southerners, Dravidas, Simhalas, Gandharas, Paradas, Pahlavas, Yavanas, Tusaras, Barbaras, Cinas, Sulikas, Daradas, Khasas, Lampakas, Ketas, and the different tribes of Kratas.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare, edited by G.P. Bhatt</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana 1.2.31.88-90 &#8220;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Annihilating every thing by his ruthless activity, he made only seeds to remain on the earth</span>. He managed to subdue the Vrsala who were generally sinful, by making them angry with one another on sudden provocations. Thereafter, in the region between the Ganga and the Yamuna, he established his camp of rest along with his followers. Thereafter, when the Kalpa elapsed, he went back to his eternal abode along with his army after exterminating Mleccha kings by thousands.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 144.51-59 &#8220;King Pramati of the Bhrigu family and Chandramasa gotra was born at the end of Svayambhuva Manu in the Sandhyamsa period, to inflict proper punishment on the sinners. That king travelled all over the earth for 30 years and collected arms and ammunitions, elephants, horses and chariots and marched with a vast army consisting of horses and elephants and accompanied by 100,00 Brahmana soldiers armed with various kinds of weapons, against the Mlecchas and destroyed them. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">After killing all the Sudra kings he annihilated all the hypocrites</span>. After destroying all the sinners and subduing the people living in the North, central regions, the mountaineers, the inhabitants in the East and West, the residents on the Vindhyas, the Deccanis, the Dravidians, the Singhalese, the inhabitants of the Mleccha countries (Kabul and Kandhara), the Paradas, the Pahlavas, the Yavanas, the Sakas, the Tusaras, the Svetas, the Pulindas, the Barbaras, the Khasas, the Lampakas, the Andhrakas, the Daradas, the Ifalikas, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">he exterminated the Sudras</span>. King Pramati was born of Visnu&#8217;s part in Manu&#8217;s family and was famous as Chandramasa.&#8221; Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>This is also mentioned in Brahmanda Purana 1.2.31.77-80 and Vayu Purana I.58.76-83 which I have mentioned in <a href="#intolerance-within-Hinduism" class="broken_link">Intolerance within caste and sects</a> category and it is also mentioned in Linga Purana Section I.40.50-56. It would have been comprehensible if the verse said that Kalki (Pramati) killed the sinners and wrongdoers but killing people born of mixed castes, and kings born to Shudra mothers is casteist. And saying that all people living in the north, south, east and west are all wrong doesn&#8217;t make any sense either, some of the tribes mentioned are traceable.</p>
<p>Kalki avatar annihilating humans and subduing low castes,</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana 2.3.73.111-116 &#8220;The lord Visnu who had been born in the previous birth as a powerful one, Pramiti by name, will be born in the Gotra of Candramas when the Kaliyuga is complete. Thus these ten incarnations of the lord are remembered. he accepts different wombs in the three worlds partially, adopting at different periods of time, different physical bodies, and different purposes for the manifestations. He will be born in the twenty-fifth Kalpa. For twenty-five years he will be exterminating the living beings and all human beings (?). With this cruel act, he will render the Earth left with only the seeds. He will subdue Vrsalas (low caste people) and almost those evil-doers. Thereafter, Kalki will become contented along with his army. Those who are not killed in this action, those who achieve something, will become deluded suddenly and fight with one another.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Do read Kalki Purana 13.39-44 and Kalki Purana 16.1 which I have already mentioned in this article in <a href="#kalki-buddhists">Kalki avatar a murderer of Buddhists</a> category. Let me once against quote them for you,</p>
<p>Sri Kalki Purana 16.1 &#8220;Suta Gosvami said. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">After killing the Buddhists and mlecchas of Kikatapura, Lord Kalki took their wealth</span> and returned to His capital, along with His vast army&#8221; Tr. Bhumipati Das edited by Purnaprajna Das</p>
<p>Sri Kalki Purana 13.39-44 &#8220;Lord Kalki appeared to flourish, being surrounded by all these family members. Once, Lord Kalki&#8217;s father, Visnuyasa, who was on the level of Lord Brahma, decided to perform a horse sacrifice. Understanding the intention of His father, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Lord Kalki said: My dear father, I will go out and defeat all other kings in battle and thus bring you sufficient wealth</span> so that you can conduct the horse sacrifice properly. Lord Kalki, who was certainly capable of conquering all other kings, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">offered His obeisances to his father and then set out with his army to first conquer Kikatapura</span>…&#8221; Tr. Bhumipati Das edited by Purnaprajna Das</p>
<p>It proves that his primary aim was to plunder people. If you are conversant with Indian history you might be knowing that Kikata is present-day Bihar. And Bihar was once dominated by Buddhists, some historians even say that Bihar is the corrupted word for Vihar which means a Buddhist temple or monastery. Buddhism might have been the prevalent religion in Kikata (Bihar) when Kalki Purana was written so the composer wrote all these fairy tales keeping that in mind or else they may have written it based on the prediction of Kali Yuga in Hindu scriptures which says that people will become heretics (Jains, Buddhists). Also, these verses of plundering Kikata may have been inspired by the Vedic verses in which Vedic gods plunders Kikata tribe just because they didn&#8217;t offer any oblation to them.

<p>Shiva burned up Tripura (Three cities) along with women and children. Tripura was a city inhabited by Asuras. Shiva with the help of other gods like Agni, Vishnu, Ashvinkumar, Yama, Kala, Ghandarvas, Brahma burned the city as well as its inhabitants. It&#8217;s not objectionable if Devas had killed combatant Asuras but they killed non-combatant Asuras along with their children and women. Your heart may tremble reading the following verses,</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 188.1 &#8220;Marakandeya said:- Hear from me, Yudhisthira! what you have asked me to explain. The spot on the banks of the Narmada where the Lord is enshrined is renowned as Mahesvara in all the three worlds and at the very same place He devised His plans of annihilating Tripura. [6-15] &#8230;In that way, Siva waited for thousands of years after making such preparations. When the three Puras (cities) fell in one line the Lord let out His arrow on Tripura when the inmates of Tripura became helpless and many kind of destructive omens occurred there&#8230;Then the wind Sambartaka that blows at the close of a cycle commenced&#8230;It produced fire on account of which the trees of Tripura began to crumble down. There was chaos everywhere. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">All the gardens were burnt down in an instant</span>&#8230;[25-40] <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The pleasure gardens smiling with lotus beds were also burnt down along with the swans and cranes</span>&#8230;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The fire of the Lord&#8217;s fury burnt down quite unsparingly several children, cows, birds, horses, women, and many people sleeping as well as awake</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The nymph like beauties of Tripura fell down burnt with their young ones hugged to their breasts.</span> Some ladies wearing garlands of pearl and gold fell down on the ground consumed by flames and suffocated by smoke. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Some beauties seeing their Lord lying on the ground jumped down from the upper storey of their mansion and were instantly eaten up by the flames</span>&#8230;Some ladies of the cloudy hue wearing garlands and armlets, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">some fair-complexioned beauties giving milk to their dear little ones were also consumed by fire</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Some ladies seeing their children eaten up by the fire sent forth shrilling wails</span>. Some ladies wearing diamond and emerald necklaces and shining like the moon <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">with their children in their lap, fell down on the ground after being charred</span>. Some moon faced beauties waking up from their sleep found their mansion on fire and began to <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">lament on realizing their children being burnt</span>. Some ladies adorned with golden ornaments fell down on the ground holding their consumed children in their arms&#8230; [41-48] Some overcome by the fury of the fire with their hands folded and uplifted began to pray as follows:- <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">&#8216;Agni! if thou art angry with the male population hostile to thee; what is the fault of the women confined in the houses like so many domesticated Kokilas pent up in cages</span>&#8230;[51-53]&#8230;Hearing such speech of the ladies the Agni said &#8216;I am not consuming you of my own will. I have been born to cause destruction. I have no mercy. I make my way everywhere freely through the glory of Siva&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Rudrasamhita 2, Yuddha Khanda 5.10.35 &#8220;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Other Asuraas too, children and old men were completely burnt out</span>, O Vyasa, at the bidding of Siva and speedily reduced to ashes. Just as the universe is burnt at the end of a Kalpa so also every thing and everyone there, whether woman or man or vehicles, was reduced to ashes by that fire.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Only those who worshipped Shiva and Ganesh were not burnt and all those who opposed God and whose activities were destructive (read not worshipping Shiva) were burnt including children, women and old people.</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 140.59-69 &#8220;The women folk in the amorous embraces of their lords in their residences and pleasure groves, were also reduced to ashes. No women could go away elsewhere. They were also consumed by fire in the company of their lords. Some of them cried out with folded hands and with tears in their eyes &#8216;O Agni! I am the wife of another; O Thou, the holy witness of all the things in the three worlds! You ought not to touch me. O Deva! my husband and myself are asleep; <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">I have not done any thing vicious and sinful</span>; therefore, go away by another path leaving my home with my beloved. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">One woman holding her infant stood, facing the fire and said &#8216;Agni! I have obtained this infant after great privations and it does not behove thee to burn this darling of mine</span></strong>&#8216;. Some of the women folk threw themselves into the waters of the ocean after forsaking their husbands. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Many of the women shivered under the destructive influence of fire and exclaimed with bewildering excitement, &#8216;O, father! O, husband! O, mother! O, maternal uncle! etc</span>. &#8216;As the heat emanating from the houses withers the lotuses springing in the ponds thereof, so consumed the fire at Tripura the lotus-like faces of those women along with their bodies&#8230;There was a great uproar when the women flew with their jingling ornaments and cried out in great consternation, on account of the fire produced form the destructive arrow of Siva.&#8221; Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>Other verses show that Devas were engaged in annihilating all of the Asuras, verses from Matsya Purana prove that, non-combatant Asuras including children, women and old people were also burned to death,</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 148.1-7 &#8220;Tarakasura said:- &#8216;Hearken, O, valiant Asuras! every one should direct his intelligence to his well being. Danavas! <span style="text-decoration: underline;">all the Devas are the annihilators of our race</span>. They are our ancient enemies. Our family religion is, therefore to establish firmly our eternal enmity with them. Today we shall certainly make a move to check the advance of the Devas and conquer them by the strength of our arms. But I do not consider it proper to fight with the Devas without practising austerities, I shall, therefore, first practise severe austerities; then we will conquer the Devas and enjoy the three worlds&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>The following verses describe the Tripura city,</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 140.53-57 &#8220;The arrow burnt the three cities as fire burns heaps of straw&#8230;The Tripura fort looked then like a good family brought to ruin by a wicked son. Afterwards, the houses of Tripura looking like the peaks of Sumera, Mandarachala and Kailasa, the beautiful places with gateways and perforated works and balconies, the pleasure rendezvous full of lovely ponds, the abodes of demons decorated with banners, buntings and wreaths of gold were eaten up by the thousand tongue fire.&#8221; Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>From the above verses as well as verses from Matsya Purana 188.1 we get to know that the Asuras were much more civilized than the Devas, the city of the enemies is described in such a beautiful manner. It shows the civilization of the Asuras who had lofty buildings, lovely palaces beautifully decorated with wreaths of gold, gardens with beautiful ponds, Asura women wearing necklaces of diamonds and gold, etc. After reading these things do you really think they were demons? A woman in this verse clearly says, &#8220;&#8216;Agni! if thou art angry with the male population hostile to thee; what is the fault of the women confined in the houses like so many domesticated Kokilas pent up in cages&#8221; But this didn&#8217;t stop cruel Agni from consuming them.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">INDRA</span></strong></p>
<p>Indra doesn&#8217;t deserve to be called a God. Even the most lecherous person&#8217;s actions on earth cannot be compared to the evils done by Indra. Indra lusted after other&#8217;s wives, raped women, committed adultery, consumed alcoholic drinks and even killed innocent people. Indra entered the womb of Diti and cut off the fetus into nine parts to kill the baby,</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Shiva Purana, Rudra Samhita 2, Parvati K</span><span style="color: #000000;">handa 3, Ch 14, verses </span><span style="color: #000000;">8-14 &#8221;My son Marici begot Kasyapa who married thirteen daughters of Daksa. The eldest of them Diti bore two sons: Hiranyakasipu the elder and Hiranyaksa the younger. When these two began to harass the gods, Visnu assumed the forms of Man lion and Boar and killed them. Then gods became fearless and happy. The distressed Diti sought refuge in Kasyapa and serving him with devotion and observing the sacred rites she conceived. On coming to know of it, </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Indra entered her womb forcibly and cut it off many a time with his thunderbolt</span><span style="color: #000000;">. By the power of her sacred rites, the child in the womb did not die as she was sleeping at that time, by a stroke of good luck. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">They were cut into seven pieces and so she had seven sons. These sons became gods by the name of Maruts</span><span style="color: #000000;">.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">This is also mentioned in Vayu Purana 6.102-3; Agni Purana 19.19-20; Valmiki Ramayana Bala Kandam 1.46 and as per Brahmanda Purana 2.3.5.68 Indra entered the belly through the vaginal passage. I am posting the summary of this story by Desi Raju Hanumanth Rao so you can understand the context,</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Diti seeks for a son to kill Indra because Indra and other gods have killed her sons in the battle after churning Milk Ocean. But Indra, being her stepson arrives at her place of asceticism, with view to destroy that Indra-killer. On a fateful day when Diti failed to maintain the procedure of vow, Indra enters her womb and dissects the foetus into seven fragments, which later become sapta marut gaNa-s, The Seven Wind-gods.&#8221;</p>
<p>Indra killed a Muni Trisira/Vishwarupa who was meditating,</p>
<p>Srimad Devi Bhagavatam 6.2.1-11. &#8220;Vyâsa said:- The extremely covetous Indra, then, mounted on his Airâvata elephant and determined to kill the Muni. He went to him and saw him immersed in deep Samâdhi, firmly seated in his posture and with his speech controlled. At that time, a halo of light emanated from his body and he looked like a second Sun and a blazing fire. Indra became very sad and dejected when he saw that. Indra then thought within himself thus :&#8211; &#8220;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Oh! Can I slay this Muni, free from any vicious inclinations, and endowed with the power of Tapas, blazing like a fire</span>! This is quite against the Dharma. But, Alas! He wants to usurp my position; how can I, then, neglect such an enemy?&#8221; Thus cogitating, Indra hurled at the Muni his swift going, infallible thunderbolt, the Muni remaining engaged in his penance and shining like the Sun and Moon. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The ascetic, struck </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">thus, fell on the ground and died</span>, like a mountain peak struck by thunder falling on the ground and presenting a wondrous sight. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Indra became very glad when he killed the Muni</span>…&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Also mentioned in Mahabharata Udyog Parva 5, section 9; Satapatha Brahmana 1.6.3.1-2. Muni Trisira/Vishwarupa had three heads for which he was called Trisira. He dedicated one head to the recitation of Vedas, one head for eating and one for observing the surroundings. Indra was afraid that Muni Trisira/Vishwarupa may replace Indra from his Indraship due to the rigid penance. So at first, he sent several Apsaras like Urvashi, Menaka, Rambha, Ghritachi and Tilottama who tried to interrupt Muni Trisira&#8217;s penance by singing and dancing in front of him and even seducing him but in vain. So at last Indra decided to kill him. But even after killing Muni Trisira with a thunderbolt, Indra thought that Trisira was alive so he asked a woodcutter named Taksa to cut off the heads of the Muni with his axe,</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Srimad </span><span style="color: #000000;">Devi Bhagavatam 6.2.1-14. &#8220;…Indra, then, went back soon to his own abode; on the other hand, the high-souled Muni, though killed, looked as it were, living by the lustre of his own body. </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Indra, then, seeing him lying like a living man thought that the Muni might get alive and so became very sad</span><span style="color: #000000;">. While he was thus arguing in his mind, he saw before him a wood cutter named Taksa and began to speak to him for his own selfish ends thus &#8220;</span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">O Artisan! Cut all the heads of this Muni and keep my word; this highly lustrous Muni is looking as it were alive; therefore, if you sever his heads</span><span style="color: #000000;">, he cannot be alive.&#8221; Taksa then cursed him and spoke thus. &#8220;O King of the Devas! The neck of this Muni is very big and therefore cannot be severed; my axe is not at all fit for this work. Specially I cannot do such a blameable act. You have done a very heinous crime, quite against the law of the good persons; I fear sin; I will not be able to cut the heads of a dead man. This Muni is lying dead; what use is there in severing his head again? O Pâkas&#8217;âsana! The killer of the demon Pâka! Why do you fear in this?&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The woodcutter was first reluctant but Indra convinced him and lured him with a share in </span><span style="color: #000000;">the </span><span style="color: #000000;">sacrifice and then the woodcutter cut off three heads of Trisira,</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Srimad </span><span style="color: #000000;">Devi Bhagavatam 6.2.21 &#8220;</span>Vyâsa said:&#8211; O King! That Tak<span style="text-decoration: underline;">s</span>â became very glad when he heard thus from Indra and struck off the heads of the Muni with his very strong axe.&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">So Vishwakarma the father of Trisira created a son Vritra to avenge the death of his son,</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Srimad </span><span style="color: #000000;">Devi Bhagavatam 6.2.21-53 &#8220;When Vis&#8217;vakarmâ heard that his virtuous son had been killed, he became very angry (in his mind) and </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">said that as Indra had killed his qualified son engaged in asceticism without any offence, he would create another son to kill Indra.</span> <span style="color: #000000;">Let the Devas see his strength and power of Tapasyâ and let Indra, too, reap the far-reaching effects of his own Karma. Thus saying, Vis&#8217;vakarmâ distressed with anger, offered oblations in the sacrificial Fire, reciting Mantram from the Atharvan Vedas, with the object of producing a son. When Homa was performed for eight nights consecutively, a man quickly came out of that burning fire, as if he was the Incarnate of Fire itself…Father! Of what avail is that to his father when he is not able to remove his sorrows!&#8221; O Father! Shall I drink the ocean or crumble the mountains to dust or shall I obstruct the passage of the rising Sun or shall I kill </span><span style="color: #000000;">Indra, Yama, or the other host of Devas or shall I root out the earth and throw it with all beings into the ocean?&#8221; </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">O King! Hearing thus the sweet words of his son, Vis&#8217;vakarmâ gladly told his mountain-like son &#8220;</span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">O my Son! You are capable to save me from troubles (Vrijina) hence you are named Vritra</span><span style="color: #000000;">. O highly Fortunate One! Your brother, named Tris&#8217;irâ, was a gre</span>at ascetic; his three faces were all very strong. He was thoroughly conversant with the Vedas and the Vedangâs and well versed in all the other knowledges. He remained always engaged in practising asceticism, surprising to the three worlds. Indra killed my qualified son with his thunderbolt; that wicked soul severed the three heads without any offence. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Therefore, O Best of beings! Kill that vicious, shameless, deceitful, wicked Indra</span> guilty of the sin of Brahmahattyâ…&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Indra slaying Vritra is praised in Vedas and many Puranas also. But in the Vedas, it is in metaphor. Wherein Indra means Sun and Vritra means cloud. It could be possible that Vedic verses were composed praising the killing of Vritra by Indra. Vritra was born to avenge the murder of his brother and still, Indra is praised in Vedas. But Vritra seems to be a kind-hearted man who entered into a truce with Indra. But the vicious Indra decided to kill him in a deceitful way. Indra sent Rambha to seduce Vritra so that he may be distracted and that will help Indra to kill Vritra. Indra&#8217;s plan was successful, Vritra fell into this trap and was killed with Indra&#8217;s thunderbolt. The following verse shows that they had entered into a truce,</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Srimad </span><span style="color: #000000;">Devi Bhagavatam 6.1.1-12 &#8220;…</span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The powerful Vritra entered into a treaty and kept himself</span><span style="color: #000000;"> peaceful when Indra and Visnu violated truth and treacherously killed him by Jalaphena (the watery foams)&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Rig Veda and Mahabharata show that Indra sought the help of Vishnu who advised him to befriend Vritra and thus making it easier for Indra to kill Vritra,</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Rig Veda 6.20.2 Even as the power of Dyaus, to thee, O Indra, all Asura sway was by the Gods entrusted, When thou, Impetuous! </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">leagued with Viṣṇu, slewest Vṛtra</span><span style="color: #000000;"> the Dragon who enclosed the waters. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Mahabharata 5.10</span><span style="color: #000000;">.1-43</span><span style="color: #000000;"> &#8220;Indra said, This whole indestructible universe, O gods, hath been pervaded by Vritra. There is nothing that can be equal to the task of opposing him. I was capable of yore, but now I am incapable. What good betide you, can I do? I believe him to be unapproachable. Powerful and magnanimous, possessing immeasurable strength in fight, he would be able to swallow up all the three worlds with the gods, the Asuras, and the men. Therefore, hear ye dwellers of heaven, this is my resolution. Proceeding to the abode of Vishnu, in company with that high-souled Being must we consult, and ascertain the means of slaying this ruthless wretch.&#8217; &#8220;Salya continued, &#8216;Indra having thus spoken, the gods with that host of Rishis repaired to the mighty god Vishnu to place themselves under the-protection of that protector of all. And afflicted with the dread of Vritra, they said unto the Supreme Lord of the deities. Thou hadst in former times covered the three worlds with three steps. Thou hadst procured the ambrosial food, O Vishnu, and destroyed the Asuras in battle. Thou didst bind the great Asura Vali and hadst raised Indra to the throne of heaven. Thou art the lord of the gods, and this entire universe is pervaded by thee. Thou art the God, the mighty Deity, saluted by all persons. Be thou the refuge of all the celestials </span><span style="color: #000000;">together with Indra, O best of gods. The whole universe, O slayer of Asuras, hath been pervaded by Vritra. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">And Vishnu said, &#8216;I am no doubt bound to do what is for your good</span><span style="color: #000000;">. I shall, therefore, tell you of a contrivance whereby he may be annihilated. </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Do ye with the Rishis and the Gandharvas repair to the place where Vritra that bearer of a universal form is and adopt towards him a conciliatory policy</span><span style="color: #000000;">.</span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;"> You will thus succeed in overthrowing him</span><span style="color: #000000;">. By virtue of my power, victory, ye gods, will be won by Indra, for, remaining invisible, I shall enter into his thunderbolt, that best of weapons. O foremost of gods, depart ye with the Rishis and the Gandharvas. Let there be no delay in effecting a peace between Indra and Vritra.&#8217;&#8230;If I do not kill Vritra, this great and mighty Asura of gigantic frame, </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">even by deceit</span><span style="color: #000000;">, it will not go well with me.&#8217; And as Indra thought of all this, bearing Vishnu in mind he beheld at that instant in the sea a mass of froth as large as a hill. And he said, &#8216;This is neither dry, nor wet, nor is it a weapon; let me hurl it at Vritra. Without doubt, he will die immediately.&#8217; And he threw at Vritra that mass of froth blended with the thunderbolt. </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">And Vishnu, having entered within that froth, put an end to the life of Vritra</span><span style="color: #000000;">. And when Vritra was killed, the cardinal points were free from gloom; and there also blew a pleasant breeze; and all beings were much pleased&#8230;&#8221; Tr. K.M. Ganguli</span></p>
<p>The following verses from Padma Purana have a slightly different version that exhibits how Indra killed him,</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Padma Purana II.24.34-43 &#8220;</span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">He thought of a stratagem to kill him. He sent Rambha (after telling her:) &#8221;With this or that trick, delude the great demon</span><span style="color: #000000;">. O auspicious one, do that to delude the great demon, so that by killing him I shall get happiness.&#8221;&#8230;[44b-51] very wise Vrtra, confiding (in Indra) in all matters, and knowing Indra to be a great friend, was not afraid of him. Moving (i.e. he moved) in the great auspicious forest&#8230;Vrtra, having come there, saw that Rambha, with charming, large eyes with his mind full of sexual desire.&#8221; Tr. N.A. Deshpande</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Padma Purana II.25.11-20 &#8220;[Vrtra said] O you beautiful lady, I have sought your shelter. Protect me form the (disturbance caused by) sexual desire. O you of large eyes, resort to me, who am, O dear one, distressed by sexual desire. Rambha said: There is no doubt that today I shall submit myself to you; O hero, you should do whatever I tell you to do&#8230;Having thus established a relation with her, the very powerful best demon enjoyed in that very meritorious forest. The great demon was very much stupefied by her singing, dancing, charming smile and sexual intercourse (with her). She said to that noble and best demon: &#8216;(Please) drink wine; (please) drink madhu-madhavi (a kind of intoxicating drink)&#8230; </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #000000;">But that respectable lady Rambha lovingly gave wine to him against his will</span><span style="color: #000000;">. Due to civility for her he drink wine at that time. </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">When he was extremely stupefied by the wine, and lost his senses, just then Indra struck him with his thunderbolt</span><span style="color: #000000;">. Then that killer of Vrtra (i.e. Indra) was tainted with such sins as killing a brahmana.&#8221; Tr. N.A. Deshpande</span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s mentioned in Shastra that Indra gave part of the Brahmin-slaughter sin to women,</p>
<p>Vasistha Dharma Shastra 5.7. For it has been declared in the Veda, &#8216;When Indra had slain (Vritra) the three-headed son of Tvashtri, he was seized by Sin, and he considered himself to be tainted with exceedingly great guilt. All beings cried out against him (saying to him), &#8216;O thou slayer of a learned Brâhmana! O thou slayer of a learned Brâhmana!&#8217; <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">He ran to the </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">women for protection (and said to them), &#8216;Take upon yourselves the third part of this my guilt (caused by) the murder of a learned Brâhmana</span>.&#8217; They answered, &#8221;What shall we have (for doing thy wish)?&#8217; He replied, &#8216;Choose a boon.&#8217; They said, &#8216;Let us obtain offspring (if our husbands approach us) during the proper season, at pleasure let us dwell (with our husbands until (our children) are born.&#8217; He answered, &#8216;So be it.&#8217; (Then) they took upon themselves (the third part of his guilt). <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">That guilt of Brâhmana-murder appears every month as the menstrual flow</span>. Therefore let him not eat the food of a woman in her courses; (for) such a one has put on the shape of the guilt of Brâhmana-murder.</p>
<p>Violating treaties was no big deal for Indra. A demon named Namuchi had entered into a peace treaty with Indra for fear of being killed. But Indra violated the treaty and killed him,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 8.14.13 13 With waters&#8217; foam thou torest off, Indra, the head of Namuci, Subduing all contending hosts.</p>
<p>Mahabharata 9.43.32-46 &#8220;Vaishampayana said, &#8220;Listen to that history, O ruler of men! Hear of those occurrences as they happened! Hear how Vasava, in days of yore, broke his treaty with Namuchi! The Asura Namuchi, from fear of Vasava, had entered a ray of the Sun. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Indra then made friends with Namuchi and entered into a covenant with him</span>, saying, &#8216;O foremost of Asuras, I shall not slay thee, O friend, with anything that is wet or with anything that is dry! I shall not slay thee in the night or in the day! I swear this to thee by truth. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Having made this covenant, the lord Indra one day beheld a fog. He then, O king, cut off Namuchi&#8217;s head, using the foam of water (as his weapon). </span>The severed head of Namuchi thereupon pursued Indra from behind, saying unto him from a near point these words, &#8216;O slayer of a friend, O wretch!&#8217; Urged on incessantly by that head, Indra repaired to the Grandsire and informed him, in grief, of what had occurred. The Supreme Lord of the universe said unto him, &#8216;Performing a sacrifice, bathe with due rites, O chief of the celestials, in Aruna, that tirtha which saveth from the fear of sin!&#8221; Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Indra and Namuchi having entered into a peace treaty and Indra violating it and killing Namuchi is also mentioned in Panchavimsha Brahmana 12.6.8-9. Mahabharata and Panchavimsha Brahmana has the same version of the story which makes it authentic but there is another version mentioned in Brahma Purana which says that Indra fled the battlefield and Namuchi chased him and he was killed there,</p>
<p>Brahma Purana: Gautami-Mahatmya 54.33-40 &#8220;Brahma said: Formerly, there was a very powerful leader of Daityas named Namuci. His enmity towards Indra was terrible. It caused hairs to stand on end. Once Namuci, the heroic leader of Daityas, saw Indra abandoning the battle and going off. Then he pursued him. On seeing him coming <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Indra became overwhelmed with fear</span>. Leaving off Airavata, Indra entered the foam of water. The thunderbolt-armed Indra instantly killed his enemy through the foam&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>

The Brahmana on the stake was not noticed by her. The chaste lady faltered and slipped down against the knees of the Brahmana on the stake. Due to the fall of the faltering lady much pain was caused to the sage&#8230;The sages said: Moving about at will, you appear to be unaware of other people&#8217;s distress and pain.

<h3><a id="war-tactics"></a>War tactics and courage of Hindu gods</h3>
<p>Hindu gods are depicted as brave warriors but these brave warriors were sometimes scared of their enemies and even fled the battlefield. Being gods they also used war tactics same as human beings do. The following verses show how Vishnu, Shiva and Brahma were defeated by a Danava and they fled in fear,</p>
<p>Srimad Devi Bhagavatam 5.7.4-11. &#8220;Seeing the Dânava, Vâsudeva Hari raised his discus in anger and attacked him with great force to kill him. Just when Hari struck the Dânava violently with his Chakra, the powerful Dânava quitted immediately his lion-form, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">assumed the buffalo form and struck Hari with his two horns. Vâsudeva, thus pierced in his breast with the horns, became confounded and fled away</span> as best as he could till he reached his own abode, Vaikuntha. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Seeing Hari thus fleeing away, S&#8217;ankara, too, thought him invulnerable and fled to his Kailâs&#8217;a mountain with fear. Brahmâ, too, fled to his own abode with terror</span>; but the powerful Vâsava took patience and remained steady in the battle. Varuna taking his S&#8217;akti waited patiently for battle. Yama, too, with his staff remained there ready to fight. Kuvera, the Lord of the Yaksas, remained very busy in close fighting with the Dânavas; Fire, taking S&#8217;akti, also waited. The Sun and Moon, the Lord of the stars, both remained in firm resolve to fight with Mahisa, the lord of the Dânavas&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Rama killing Bali.</p>
<p>Rama killed Bali while Bali was busy fighting Hanuman. That too Rama shot an arrow by hiding behind a tree. Rama killing Bali is mentioned in Valmiki Ramayana, Kishkindha Kanda, Ch 16.</p>
<p>Krishna and Balrama vs Yavana army,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 10.52.5-8 &#8220;The Lord again returned to the city of Mathura which was still besieged by the Yavana army. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">He annihilated the Yavana army and carried of their wealth as spoils to Dvaraka</span>. While the wealth was being transported on the backs of men and oxen under the direction of the Imperishable Lord, Jarasandha, commanding an army of twentythree aksauhinis arrived on the scence. Observing their violent onrush of inimical forced, Balarama and Krsna, the descendants of Madhu <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">adopted the human way of life and quickly began to run, Oh king. Though dauntless, they left the vast treasure (the spoils from the Yavana army) and similating terrified cowards, they ran for many yojanas on foot</span>, tender like lotuspetals.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 10.52.10-12 &#8220;Apparently exhausted after fleeing a long distance, the two Lords climbed a high mountain named Pravarṣaṇa, upon which Lord Indra showers incessant rain. Although he knew They were hiding on the mountain, Jarāsandha could find no trace of Them. Therefore, O King, he placed firewood on all sides and set the mountain ablaze. The two of Them then suddenly jumped from the burning mountain, which was eleven yojanas high, and fell to the ground.&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Vishnu beheads the demons by assuming the form of a woman,</p>
<p>Agni Purana 3.11-15 &#8220;Taking ambrosia from his hands the Daityas gave half of it to the gods and went away with the other half. Vishnu, the root of creation, then assumed the form of a (beautiful) damsel. Beholding her endued with beauty, the Daityas, overcome with fascination, said &#8216;Be our wife, take this ambrosia, O fair one and make us partake of it.&#8217; Saying &#8216;So be it&#8217; Hari took it from them and made the celestials drink of it. Assuming the form of the moon Rahu drank up the portion offered to the sun and moon and therefore his head was severed off his head by his enemy Hari. He then said to Hari, the giver of boon. &#8216;By thy mercy I have attained immortality.&#8221; Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>

<h3><a id="enemy"></a>Mercilessly killing the enemy</h3>
<p>Hindu gods mercilessly killed their enemies. They beheaded them, peeled out the skin, cut off all the limbs, cut them into pieces, burned them, etc.</p>
<p>Srimad Devi Bhagavatam 5.26.62-65 &#8220;Vyâsa said:&#8211; O King! Hearing thus the words of Ambikâ, Kâlikâ spoke to Her again:&#8211; &#8220;In this war-sacrifice there is this axe which is like a sacrificial post; I will offer these two as victims to Thy sacrifice. Thus no act of envy will be committed (i.e., killing in a sacrifice is not considered as envy).&#8221; Thus saying, the Kâlikâ Devî cut off their heads with great force and gladly drank their blood. Thus seeing the two Asuras killed, Ambikâ said gladly:&#8211; Thou hast done the service to the gods; so I will give Thee an excellent boon. O Kâlikâ! As Thou hast killed Chanda and Munda, henceforth Thou wilt be renowned in this world as Châmundâ.&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Agni Purana 234.8-16 &#8220;Now I shall describe the measures of illusion to be practised by a king in frightening away the hearts of a hostile army, to show that the God is on the side of his countrymen&#8230;Similarly the quarters of the enemy should be denuded with showers of simulated blood, and a similar severed head of the adversary should be exhibited at the terrace of the palace.&#8221; Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 8.10.57 &#8220;Thereafter, two very powerful demons named Mālī and Sumālī were killed by the Supreme Lord, who severed their heads with His disc. Then Mālyavān, another demon, attacked the Lord. With his sharp club, the demon, who was roaring like a lion, attacked Garuḍa, the lord of the birds, who are born from eggs. But the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the original person, used His disc to cut off the head of that enemy also.&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Srimad Devi Bhagavatam 5.14.40-56 &#8220;…Mahâ Mâyâ then, became very angry and began to hurl arrows after arrows so incessantly that all the armours of all the Dânavas became pierced and were cut down to pieces…&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Rudrasamhita 2, Yuddha Khanda section V, 55.30 &#8220;At the bidding of Siva, lord Krsna, the destroyer of heroic enemies, chopped off several arms of Bana by means of Sudarsana.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 10.59.14 &#8220;The Lord severed the heads, thighs, arms, legs and armor of these opponents led by Pīṭha and sent them all to the abode of Yamarāja. Narakāsura, the son of the earth, could not contain his fury when he saw the fate of his military leaders. Thus he went out of the citadel with elephants born from the Milk Ocean who were exuding mada from their foreheads out of excitement.&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Skanda Purana I.iii(P).11.27 &#8220;Then, the Goddess who tormented Mahisa, cut off his head with a sharp-edged sword and stood on his head and danced.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Valmiki Ramayana Aranya Kanda, 26.13-15 &#8220;Neverthless, as Dushana rushed upon him, Rama cut off both his arms with his arrows, and that mace, loosed from his grasp, fell forward on the field like unto the banner of Indra, Whilst Dushana, bereft of it, his arms severed, sank to the earth like a mighty elephant that, stripped of its tusks, succumbs.&#8221; Tr. Hari Prasad Shastri</p>
<p>Mahabharata Vana Parva 3.202.35 &#8220;Markandeya continued, &#8216;Then Govinda began to reflect but uncovered space found he none and when he could not discover any spot that was uncovered on earth or in the sky, that foremost Deity then beheld his thighs to be absolutely uncovered. And there, O king, the illustrious Deity cut off the heads of Madhu and Kaitabha with his keenedged discus!'&#8221; Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>

<p>Devi Bhagavatam 5.30.37-64. &#8220;Vyâsa said :&#8211; O King! Thus saying the Chandikâ Devî instantly cut off the head of Nis&#8217;umbha by Her axe with great caution. The head thus severed from the body by the blow of the Devî, the headless Demon began to roam there with great force with club in his hand.

<h2><a id="fighting-eachother"></a>Gods fighting each other</h2>
<p>Other than killing innocent people, Hindu gods were also engaged in fighting each other. Several questions arise when reading stories of gods fighting each other. Which god is right when two gods fight each other? Are Hindu gods so stupid not to understand right and wrong that they have to become physical with each other? What example are they leaving for human beings by fighting with each other? Can&#8217;t Hindu gods forgive the other to give an example to their creation? Or can&#8217;t they settle the matter through talks?</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SHIVA VS YAMA</span></strong></p>
<p>Brahma Purana 35.11 &#8220;Obeisance to one who annhilated the god of Death&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Jagdish Lal Shastri writes, &#8220;Annihilated the god of death. Siva gave Mrkandu a boon that a pious son would be born to him but he would live only for sixteen years. The child was born and named Markandeya. He was educated in Vedas and Sastras. When the hour of his death arrived, the boy embraced the linga idol of Siva. When Yama, the god of death came to fetch him, the angry Siva arose out of the idol and killed Yama. At the request of gods Yama was revived to life but Markandeya was granted youth for ever.&#8221;</p>
<p>Brahma Purana: Gautami-Mahatmya 24.9-21 &#8220;Brahma said: Then Mrtyu with the noose in his hand entered the place where that brahmin was worshipping Siva. The brahmin was not at all aware of either Yama&#8217;s servants or Mrtyu himself&#8230;Then Mrtyu thew up the noose against Sveta. O great sages, Nandin then became angry. Nandin hit Mrtyu with the baton given by Siva. Mrtyu fell on the ground. Then the messengers saw that Mrtyu was struck down. They intimated the incident to Yama. Then Dharma whose vehicle is buffalo and who controls all addressed his attendants and associates&#8230;&#8217;Hurry up, hurry up&#8217;, said Yama to them and himself proceeded ahead, surrounded by these and others, to the place where Sveta the excellent brahmin was worshipping Siva&#8230;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Karttikeya pierced the servants of Yama by means of his javelin.

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SHIVA&#8217;S VIRABHADRA VS GODS</span></strong></p>
<p>Daksha organized a Yajna and invited all gods and sages except for his son in law Shiva and spoke ill of Shiva. So Shiva&#8217;s wife asks him to destroy the sacrifice of Daksha. On being requested Shiva creates a form called Virabhadra. Virabhadra then goes to the place and destroys everything, kicks and beats up the sages, paralyses some Devas and kills some, cuts off Agni&#8217;s tongue, plucks out eyes of Bhaga and does many more violent things and finally beheads Daksha,</p>
<p>Kurma Purana I.15.35-42 &#8220;Sri Devi said: O Sankara, Daksa who had been my father in the previous birth is performing a Yajna after censuring your status and your own self&#8230;Please destroy that sacrifice immediately&#8230;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Thus implored by the goddess, the great Lord, the Lord of Devas, created Rudra immediately with a desire to destroy the Yajna of Daksa</span>. He was highly infuriated. He had a thousand heads, a thousand eyes and huge arms, a thousand in number. He was invincible. He resembled the fire at the close of the Yugas. He was terrible due to his curved fangs. He could not be seen (directly) due to his glaring brilliance. He held a conch and a discus. He had a staff in his hand. He roared loudly. He held a horn in his hand and was beautified with Bhasma (ashes). <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">He became famous as Virabhadra</span>&#8230;Siva spoke to him thus: &#8216;O Ganesvara (leader of the attendants). Blessings unto you. After censuring me, Daksa is performing a Yajna, at Gangadvara, (near the source of the river Ganga). Destroy that sacrifice of Daksa.&#8217; <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Then the sacrifice of Daksa was destroyed by Virabhadra playfully like a single lion released from bondage</span>&#8230; [59b-67a] The leaders of Ganas became infuriated. They uprooted the sacrificial posts and threw them here and there. The Ganesvaras, all of whom were terrible ones, took the sacrificial horse along with the Prastotr and Hotr (the priests) and hurled them into the currents of Ganga. Even <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Virabhadra whose mind was ablaze with wrath, paralysed the hand of Indra</span> as he raised it to strike and did the same to other gods. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Sportively he plucked out the eyes of Bhaga by the tip of his finger nails. Hitting with his fist he felled down the teeth of Pusan</span>. The mighty leader of Ganas sportively and smilingly kicked Lord Moon with the big toe of his leg. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">O excellent sages, he cut off the pair of hands of fire and playfully plucked out his tongue</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Then he kicked sages on their heads. The mighty one then pierced Visnu, who had been coming thither on his Garuda with sharp arrows after stunning Sudarsana</span>. The powerful Garuda stared at the Gana and suddenly hit him with his wings and roared like the ocean.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Also mentioned in Linga Purana Section I, 82.98-103; Varaha Purana chapter 21. After Daksha was beheaded a goat&#8217;s head was fixed and was resurrected as mentioned in Devi Bhagavatam 7.30.39-50, as per Linga Purana Section I.82.98-103 Saraswati&#8217;s lips and nose were also cut off. This story mentioned in Linga Purana is more violent,</p>
<p>Linga Purana Section I.100.15-19 &#8220;&#8230;Virabhadra of great splendour and undistressed soul made the hands of Indra and other Devas stunned as they raised them. He uprooted the eyes of Bhaga sportively with the tip of his finger. With his fist he hit the teeth of Pusan and made them fall. He kicked the moon with the toe of his foot. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">He cut off the head of lord Indra. After cutting off the hands of Agni and after uprooting his tongue</span> sportively he kicked him on his head with his leg. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">He cut off the staff of Yama</span>. He hit lord Isana a guardian of the quarters of great strength by means of his trident. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Without any difficulty he killed thirty three Devas thus</span>. Sportingly he killed three thousand three hundred and thirty three Devas along with the three leading Devas. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">He killed the leading sages too</span>. This lord killed those Devas who stood in readiness for fighting. Lord Rudra hit them with his fist, swords, arrows and other things. Then Visnu of great splendour and intensified strength lifted up his discus, and fought with Rudra. A terrible fight ensured between them. It made hairs to stand on end.&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Rudra Samhita 2, Satikhanda Section 2.1.32-34 &#8220;They worked a great havoc there. Virabhadra chastised everyone and spared none. After defeating Visnu and the Devas with strenuous effort, the chief of Ganas cut off the head of Daksa and consigned it to the sacrificial fire. Working great havoc he destroyed the sacrifice. Then he came back to the mountain and bowed to Lord Siva&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>There is another story that may talk about a different event but it looks like it&#8217;s about this same event,</p>
<p>Skanda Purana V.ii.64.19b-25 &#8220;The share of Sambhu was not appropriated by Brahma in his sacrifice. Mahadeva is the annihilator of the universe. (But,) O king, he (too) was deluded by his sense-organs and he became angry with Suras (Devas). The Suras are the Vibhutis (empowered parts) of Siva. All the three worlds are solely intended for his sport. Yet, by him the bow was strung well for the sake of a share! The teeth of Pusan were shattered. Divakara (the Sun) was made unconscious. The eyes of Bhaga were plucked and the god of Yajna in the form of an antelope was hit. The Devas turned into Pasus (animals). The sages were denied the Vedas. The Dharmasastras of the sages were taken away by the all powerful Lord&#8230;&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SHIVA VS GANESHA</span></strong></p>
<p>Shiva Purana Rudrasamhita 2, Kumara Khanda IV.13.15-20 &#8220;Once when Parvati was taking her bath, Sadasiva rebuked Nandin and came into the inner apartment. The mother of the universe, seeing the untimely arrival of Siva in the midst of her bath and toilet stood up. The beautiful lady was very shy then&#8230;At the time when the incident occurred, Parvati, the great Maya, the great goddess, thought as follows. &#8216;There must be a servant of my own who will be expert in his duties. He must not stray from my behest even a speck.&#8217; Thinking thus the goddess created a person with all the characteristics, out of the dirt from her body. [30-37] Thus placing her son at the doorway, Parvati began to take bath with her friends, unworried. O excellent sage, at this very moment Siva who is eagerly indulgent and an expert in various divine sports came near the door. Not knowing that he was lord Siva, the consort of Parvati, Ganesa said &#8216;O sir, without my mother&#8217;s permission you shall not go in now. My mother has entered the bath. Where are you going now? Go away&#8217; saying thus, he took up his staff to ward him off. On seeing him Siva said &#8216;O foolish fellow, whom are you forbidding? O wicked knave, don&#8217;t you know me? I am Siva, none else&#8217;. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Thereupon Ganesa beat Siva with the staff</span>. Siva expert in various sports became infuriated&#8230;When lord Siva tried to enter the house, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Ganesa became infuriated, O brahmin, and struck him with his staff once again</span>.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Shiva Purana Rudra Samhita 4, Kumarakhanda IV, 16.7-8 O sage, after fighting for a long time along with the army and seeing him terrific, even Siva was greatly surprised. Thinking withing himself &#8221;He has to be killed only by deception and not otherwise&#8221; he stayed in the midst of the army. [11-12] Then Ganesa the heoioc son of Sakti following the course of heroes, at first worshipped (i.e., struck) Visnu with his staff, Visnu who confers happiness to all. &#8221;I shall cause him delusion. Then let him be killed by you, O lord. Without deception he cannot be killed. He is of Tamasika nature and inaccessible.&#8221; [29-35] After remembering the lotus like feet of Siva, Visnu took up his discus and split the iron club by means of discus. Ganesa hurled the piece of iron club at Visnu which was caught by the bird Garuda and rendered futile. Thus for a long time the two heroes Visnu and Ganesa fought with each other. Again the foremost among heroes, the son of Parvati took up his staff of unrivalled power remembering Siva and struck Visnu with it. Struck with that unbearable blow he fell on the ground. But he got up, quickly and fought with Parvati&#8217;s son. Securing this opportunity, </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">the Trident-bearing deity came there and cut off his head with his trident</span><span style="color: #000000;">. O Narada, when the head of Ganesa was cut off, the armies of the gods and the Ganas stood still.&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">What kind of gods are these? One (Ganesha) doesn&#8217;t know his own father, the other (Shiva) who is considered The destroyer couldn&#8217;t kill Ganesha, so with the help of Vishnu he beheads a child that too by using deception.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #000000;">SHIVA VS BRAHMA</span></strong></p>
<p>Varaha Purana 97.1-7 &#8220;Varaha said: O Earth, now listen to the origin of Rudra Vrata, by knowing which one gets freed from all sins. The red-eyed and tawny coloured Rudra who was created by Brahma in his third birth, was borne by him in pleasure on his shoulder. When he was thus on the shoulder, the fifth head of Brahma told Rudra the Atharvan mantra by which release is obtained. &#8216;O Kapalin, Rudra, Babhru, Bhava, Kairata, Suvrata, my valiant and broad-eyed son, do protect this world&#8217;. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">When Rudra was thus addressed by the names which he would be getting in future he was angry at the word &#8216;Kapala&#8217; used and clipped off that (fifth) head</span>. The head was clipped off by the nail in the left thumb, but it got to the hand.&#8221; Tr. Venkitasubramonia Iyer, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>All Puranas are unanimous that Shiva beheaded Brahma but there is variation as to why he beheaded him, above verses say that Shiva was infuriated when Brahma called him Kapala but Kurma Purana II.31.1-32 says that Brahma and Shiva were quarreling over supremacy and Shiva found Brahma arrogant so he in anger cut off the head of Brahma. There are a few other versions. Shiva beheading Brahma is also mentioned in Skanda Purana V.iii.173.1-5; Brahma Purana: Gautami-Mahatmya 43.19-23; Shiva Purana, Vayaviyasamhita 6, Section I, 30.19</p>
<p>There is a story in Shiva Purana which says that Shiva was going to kill Brahma because Brahma watched his wife lustfully and even discharged semen,</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Rudrasamhita 2, Satikhanda 2.19.43- &#8220;Lord Siva said:- O patriarch Daksa what has just been requested by Visnu my great devotee and agreed to by me shall be done here. &#8216;O lord, whoever stares at Sati lustfully shall be killed by you.&#8217; I Shall make these words of Visnu true by killing Brahma. Why did Brahma stare at Sati lustfully? Moreover he has committed a sin by discharging his semen. Hence I shall kill him.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Brahma begs for mercy and at last, Vishnu acts as a mediator and pacifies Shiva and urges him not to kill Brahma and Shiva agrees. Another version of the story is mentioned in Vamana Purana,</p>
<p>Vamana Purana 2.35-37 &#8220;Discerning forthwith the faces resembling the Sun, the face of Brahman remarked thus, &#8216;Bubbles are formed when water is disturbed, Is there any valour in them&#8217;? The great Sankara who was enraged to hear this severed with the tip of his nail the head of Brahman which had spoken to him rudely. Thus chopped, the head fell on the left paml of Sankara himself and never dropped down from his hand.&#8221; Tr. Anand Swarup Gupta</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SHIVA VS AURVA</span></strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s not actually a fight. Shiva burns up the hermitage of sage Aurva for which Aurva curses him.</p>
<p>Varaha Purana 147.9-14 &#8220;Then in that famous tirtha known as Goniskramana, lord Siva came near him. Aurva was then going to the river Ganga to gather lotus flowers. Knowing him thus out of the hermitage, Siva entered it. It was auspicios, beautiful and full of fruits and flowers. But it was soon reduced to ashes by the heat of the halo of Siva. After burning that hermitage, Siva quickly returned to (his abdode in) the Himalayas. [19-] From that moment Siva, although he is the lord of the world, began to be tormented by great heat, and he told Parvati: &#8216;Seeing the penance of Aurva, the gods were afraid and they told me: &#8216;The heat of the penance of this Aurva affects the whole world. But he does not desire anything. How can we remedy thiss?&#8217; When told thus, I caste my eye on his hermitage. In a moment it was burnt down, and we returned. Being sorry and angry at this, Aurva cursed me, and that has resulted in this torment of mine.&#8221; Tr. Venkitasubramonia Iyer, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">KRISHNA VS SHIVA</span></strong></p>
<p>Aniruddh the grandson of Krishna fell in love with Uma the daughter of Banasura. So he followed her to her palace and was captured by Banasura&#8217;s men. Aniruddha didn&#8217;t return home for months and Sage Narada informed that Aniruddha has been captured by Banasura. So the battle between Krishna and Banasura ensued. Banasura was a devotee of Shiva and several other Shiva&#8217;s followers were harassed by Krishna so Shiva decided to help Banasura in the battle. Kartikeya son of Shiva also helped him. Banasura along with Shiva were overpowered by Krishna so Shiva requested Krishna not to kill Banasura so Krishna only cuts off the hands of Banasura.</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 10.63.12-14 &#8220;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Lord Śiva, wielder of the trident, shot various weapons at Lord Kṛṣṇa</span>, wielder of Śārṅga. But Lord Kṛṣṇa was not in the least perplexed: He neutralized all these weapons with appropriate counterweapons. Lord Kṛṣṇa counteracted a brahmāstra with another brahmāstra, a wind weapon with a mountain weapon, a fire weapon with a rain weapon, and Lord Śiva&#8217;s personal pāśupatāstra weapon with His own personal weapon, the nārāyaṇāstra. After bewildering Lord Śiva by making him yawn with a yawning weapon, Lord Kṛṣṇa proceeded to strike down Bāṇāsura&#8217;s army with His sword, club and arrows.&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 10.63.22 &#8220;After Lord Śiva&#8217;s followers had been driven away, the Śiva-jvara, who had three heads and three feet, pressed forward to attack Lord Kṛṣṇa. As the Śiva-jvara approached, he seemed to burn everything in the ten directions. Seeing this personified weapon approach, Lord Nārāyaṇa then released His own personified fever weapon, the Viṣṇu-jvara. The Śiva-jvara and Viṣṇu-jvara thus battled each other. The Śiva-jvara, overwhelmed by the strength of the Viṣṇu-jvara, cried out in pain. But finding no refuge, the frightened Śiva-jvara approached Lord Kṛṣṇa, the master of the senses, hoping to attain His shelter. Thus with joined palms he began to praise the Lord. The Śiva-jvara said: I bow down to You of unlimited potencies, the Supreme Lord, the Supersoul of all beings. You possess pure and complete consciousness and are the cause of cosmic creation, maintenance and dissolution. Perfectly peaceful, You are the Absolute Truth to whom the Vedas indirectly refer.&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SHIVA VS VISHNU</span></strong></p>
<p>There is another battle between Shiva and Krishna. And in this battle, Shiva helps Kasiraja and is defeated by Krishna. But in Skanda Purana it is a battle between Shiva and Vishnu. The discus of Krishna manifests itself as Vishnu. The story is that a King named Paundraka claims to be Vasudeva, this angers Krishna and he prepares for a battle against the imposter Vasudeva (Paundraka). King Paundraka is helped by his friend who is also a king of Kasi named Kasiraja. Since Kasiraja was a devotee of Shiva he propitiates Shiva for help in the battle against Krishna and Shiva agrees to help him,</p>
<p>Skanda Purana II.ii.12.14-18 &#8220;&#8230;Nila mountain is in the third Yojana (i.e. 3X12 Kms.). This is the holy spot of the Lord of Gauri named Ekamrakavana. Not far off, O king, is the place where, being afraid, he sought refuge. Indradyumna said: Why was the Lord of Gauri (Siva) frightened? With whom did he seek refuge?&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Skanda Purana II.ii.12.45-57 &#8220;O king, many king ruled over that city. Formerly in Dvapara Yuga, there was a king there (commonly) called Kasiraja. By means of severe penance he propitiated Lord Sambhu with this aim in his mind: &#8216;I will excel in war Acyuta (Krsna), the conquerer of kings, the chief of whom is Jaraasandha.&#8217; The Pinaka-bearing Lord (Siva) who was propitiated, granted him that boon: &#8216;O suppressor of enemies, you will conquer the Slayer of Kamsa in battle. For your sake I shall fight seated on my Bull, along with (my attendants) Pramathas&#8230;That Lord (Krsna) who is the immanent soul (of all), knew the incident of that sort, and sent his Discus for killing Kasiraja. The infuriated Discus that was very fierce in appearance, had the refulgence of a thousand suns. It knew the power of the mind of Visnu. It cut off the head of Kasiraja and burned to ash his army as well as that city. On seeing that extremely violent action Pasupati (Siva) became furious. Surrounded by his Ganas and seated on his Bull, the Pinaka-bearing Lord rushed at it. Then Sambhu looked at the Sudarsana Discus at the outset and discharged his Pasupata missile in front of it, like an ominous calamity. Formerly Sambhu had secured a boon from Visnu who had been pleased by his devotion: &#8216;On being remembered by you I shall invigorate your missile. But if you go against me, it will become lustreless (and ineffective.&#8217; When this Pasupata missile which was (usually) terrible, became futile and when Varanis was burned, the Bull-bannered Lord became afraid. Then he eulogized the Primordial Purusottama, the cause of all the worlds.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Skanda Purana II.ii.12.65-77 &#8220;When (the Lord) who burned the Tripuras eulogized thus, Adhoksaja (Visnu) manifested himself after casting off the form of the Discus. His face (indicated that he was) delighted. The glorious Lord held the conch, the discus and the iron club. He was seated on Garuda as if on a lotus seat&#8230;Though he was an ocean of mercy, he spoke the husband of Girija (who was) firghteneed, as if he waas angry with him. Sri Bhagavan said: How has such an evil-mindedness beset you at this time? O Sambhu, for the sake of an insect (i.e. an insignificant) king, you have come to fight with me! How many examples of my power have not been known to you, O Durjati (Siva). It is true that your Pasupati missile cannot be vanquished by Suras and Asuras. The Discus is a form of my anger. I t cannot spare even you&#8230;Now if you wish to sport about with Gauri here for a long time, if you wish that this city of Varanasi should stay for a long time (do as follows). On the shore of the Southern Sea there is a holy spot well known after my name, viz. Sripurusottama. It is adorned by Nila mountain&#8230;O annihilator of Tripuras, stay there fearlessly along with Parvati.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Skanda Purana II.ii.12.80-83 &#8220;Narada said: On being told thus by Vasudeva the Three-eyed Lord bent down his head. With palms joined in reverence he spoke to the slayer of Madhu: Mahadeva said: O Lord of Devas, O Lord of the universe, O Lord, O dispeller of the agony of those who bow down (to you) carrying out your behest will be the cause of my welfare, O Lord of the worlds. On account of my stupidity, O Lord, I had been arrogant. There, O Lord, your own blessing is the cause of my fickleness. Since you command me, O Lord of Devas, to proceed to Purusottama, I shall carry out your behest reverently and proceed to the auspicious holy place that bestows salvation&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Krishna beheads Kasiraja with his Sudarshan Chakra as mentioned in Srimad Bhagavatam 10.66.22.</p>
<p>There was another battle between Shiva and Vishnu. Where Shiva kills Vishnu&#8217;s three sons in the form of a bull for creating havoc and Vishnu fights Shiva and is defeated by that Bull, Vishnu wasn&#8217;t aware that the bull was actually Shiva,</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Satarudra Samhita 3, chapter 23, verses 3-12 &#8220;Then the bull attacked Visnu&#8217;s sons wielding their bows for fighting, deluded by Siva&#8217;s Maya and proud of their great strenght and exploit. O excellent sage, the sons of Visnu becamame furious. Those heroes roared loudly and rushed against Siva. Rudra in that form of a bull was furious at those sons of Visnu who rushed at him. He kicked them with his hoofs and tore them with his horns. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">When their limbs were split by Rudra, they swooned and lost their lives. They were immediately destroyed</span>. When they were killed Visnu the foremost of the strong came out shouting loudly and hastened towards Siva<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">. On Seeing Siva in the form of the bull going along after killing his sons, Visnu hit him with divine arrows and missiles</span>. Then the infuriated Siva, the highly powerful one in the form of a bull stood like a mountain and caught hold of all those milssiles of Visnu&#8230;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The lord leaped up suddenly and kicked the infuriated Visnu who was deluded and could not realise him. The lord then tore him with his horns</span>. Unable to bear the onslaught, Visnu deluded by Maya was exhausted and utterly shattered.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Satarudra Samhita 3, chapter 23, verses 13-16 &#8220;When his pride fell off, Visnu was dejected, and dispirited. He then realised that Siva was sporting about in the form of a bull. Then on realising that Siva himself had come in the form of a Bull, Visnu spoke in a shrill voice with drooping shoulders and palms joined in reverence. Visnu said: O lord of the gods, O ocean of mercy, O lord Siva, I had been deluded by your Maya and my mind had been confused. O lord, I fought with you, Siva. Taking pity on me, O lord, let this offence be excused.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SHIVA&#8217;S VIRABHADRA VS VISHNU&#8217;S NARASIMHA</span></strong></p>
<p>The story of Vishnu’s Narasimha avatar killing Hiranyakashipu with his claws by placing him on his lap is well known. This story ends with the killing of Hiranyakaship in Vaishnavite Puranas, however, it has an addition in Shaivite Puranas which says that this avatar of Vishnu was killed by Shiva’s Sharaba form and this story can be found only in Shaivite Puranas to show Shiva as superior to Vishnu. The summary of the story is that fiery Narasimha didn’t just stop after killing Hiranyakaship, Narasimha created havoc on the earth and was going to annihilate the universe. Gods propitiated “The Destroyer” Shiva to stop it and save the world. Hence, Shiva sent his Virabhadra form to pacify Narasimha avatar. Virabhadra praised Narasimha and requested him to stop the annihilation of the universe as “The Destroyer” is only Shiva but all in vain. Sweet words of Narasimha instead infuriated Narasimha and he held the Virabhadra form. Thence Virabhadra form disappeared with a change in environment marking the advent of the most fierce form of Shiva known as Sharaba. This form is explained in the following way,</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Satarudrasamhita 3, chapter 12, verses 2-11 &#8220;Nandisvara said: Thus admonished by Virabhadra, the Man-lion became furious. He roared and began to seize him with force. In the meantime, the splendour of Siva rose up unbearably enveloping the sky all around. It was terrible and cause for imminent fear. Then in a trice the form of Virabhhadra became invisible&#8230;Even as all the gods stood watching with the auspicious shouts of victory, Lord Siva became manifest in the form the Annihilator. He had a thousand hands and wore matted hair. His head was adorned with wings and beak. His body was fierce and fully developed. His fangs were very sharp. Adamantine claws were his weapons. His neck was black in colour. He had a huge arms and four legs. He was blazing like fire. His voice was resonant and terrible like the rumbling sound of the clouds that gather at the end of a Yuga. His three eyes were as wide and blazing as the fire of the evil spirit of great fury. His fangs and lips were clearly visible. He was producing a hissing sound of Humkara. Siva of such a form appeared in sight.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>The following verses show Virabhadra’s attempt to calm Narasimha which further infuriated Narasimha,</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Satarudrasamhita 3, chapter 11, verses 25-27 &#8220;[Virabhadra says] O lord Narasimha, O soul of the universe, subdue this extremely terrible body yourself in my presence. Nandisvara said; Urged thus with quiet peaceful words of Virabhadra, the arrogant man-lion assumed a more terrible anger&#8230;The Man-lion said: Go back the way you have come from. Do not speak offending words. I am now going to annihilate the universe of the mobile and immobile beings.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>The following verses show how he killed Narasimha and skinned him to wear it as a garment.</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Satarudrasamhita 3, chapter 12, verses 12-36 &#8220;At his very vision Visnu lost his strength and exploit. He assumed a lustre of the flickering glow-worm beneath the sun. Fluttering with his wings, and tearing the navel and legs he bound the legs of the Man-lion with his tail and his hands with his own hands. He struck his chest, caught hold of Visnu. It expanded in the sky along with the gods and sages. Like a vulture seizing a serpent he fearlessly caught hold of Visnu, lifted him up and fell him to the ground. At the time of flight he was excessively oppressed being hit with the wings. Then Lord Siva took Visnu and flew him. All the gods followed him eulogising him with the words of obeisance. Brahma and other sages bowed to him with reverence and love. Being led thus Visnu was helpless. His face was pallid and sorrowful. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">With palms joined in reverence he eulogised Lord Siva with prayers of simple words</span>. After eulogising Mrda with the hundred and eight names of the lord, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Nrsimha requested lord Sarabha again. &#8216;O great lord, whenever my ignorant mind becomes defiled by arrogance, it shall be removed by you alone&#8217;</span> Nandisvara said: Thus saying with love to Siva, the Man-lion turned submissive and bowed to him. Visnu was utterly defeated and came to the end of his life&#8230;Lord Virabhadra, the leader of the Ganas, of great strength, peeled off the hide of the Man-lion and went to the mountain taking it with him. From that time Siva began to wear the hide of the Man-lion. His head was the leading bead in his necklace of skulls.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Linga Purana says that only bones were left with a face but Shiva Purana says that Virabhadra/Sharabha used Narasimha’s head as bead in his necklace of skulls. Sharabha killing Narasimha is also mentioned in other verses. Brahma says in Skanda Purana,<br />
Skanda Purana I.iii(U).16.17 &#8220;If you had not killed Nrhari (Man-lion) by assuming the form of Sarabha (i.e. a fabulous eight footed animal) alone, he would have destroyed the universe like Hiranyakasipu.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">INDRA VS SHIVA</span></strong></p>
<p>Mahabharata, Drona Parva 7, Section 202, Verses 82-84 &#8220;When the triple city began to burn, the goddess Durga went to see the sight, with a child on her lap having only five clumps of hair on its head. Uma then asked the gods who that child was. The malevolent Indra then tried to strike him with the thunder-bolt. Thereupon the all-powerful Lord of all the worlds, possessed of the six excellent qualities the Bhagas, smilingly paralysed the arm of the enraged Indra wielding the thunder bolt.&#8221; Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">MARUTS VS INDRA</span></strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.170.2 The Maruts are thy brothers. Why, O Indra, wouldst thou take our lives? Agree with them in friendly wise, and do not slay us in the fight.</p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.171.6 Do thou, O Indra, guard the conquering Heroes, and rid thee of thy wrath against the Maruts…</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">KRISHNA VS INDRA</span></strong></p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 5.30.51-68 &#8220;&#8230;and Indra accordingly, attended by the army of the celestials, marched to attack Hari, in defence of the Parijata tree. The gods were armed with clubs, swords, maces, and darts; and Indra wielded the thunderbolt. As soon as Govinda saw the king of the gods advancing against him on his elephant, attended by the immortals, he blew his shell so that the sound filled all the regions, and he showered smilingly myriads of arrows upon his assailants&#8230;The son of Devaki thew his mace at the club of Yama, and cast it broken upon the ground: he cut in bits the litter of the lord of the sun: he severed Agni into a hundred parts with his arrows, and scattered the Vasus through the realms of space: with his discus he cut off the points of tridents of Rudras, and cast themselves upon the earth: and with the shafts shot from his bow he dispersed the Sadhyas, Visvas, Maruts, and Gandharbas, like fleeces of cotton from the pods of the wings and nails, and bit and bruised and scratched the deities who opposed his lord&#8230;When all other weapons had been cut to pieces, Indra stood armed with his thunderbolt, and Krshna with the discus Sudarsana. Beholding them thus prepared to fight, all the people of the three spheres exclaimed, &#8216;Alas! alas!&#8217; Indra launched his bolt, but in vain, for Hari caught and arrested it&#8230;&#8221; Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>H.H. Wilson summarizes this as,</p>
<p>&#8220;Krishńa restores her earrings to Adití, and is praised by her: he visits the gardens of Indra, and at the desire of Satyabhámá carries off the Párijáta tree. Śachí excites Indra to its rescue. Conflict between the gods and Krishńa, who defeats them. Satyabhámá derides them. They praise Krishńa.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">VISHNU VS LAKSHMI</span></strong></p>
<p>Now, this is a good lesson to all married men, do not provoke your wife and do not talk about other women, she can even behead you. Lakshmi beheads Vishnu using a curse because Vishnu laughed at her unnecessarily,</p>
<p>Srimad Devi Bhagavatam 1.5.74-86 &#8220;Does anything take place in this world without any cause? <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Now hear why Hari&#8217;s head was cut off</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Once on a time, seeing the beautiful face of His dear wife Laksmî Devî, Hari laughed in presence of Her</span>. At this Laksmî Devî came to understand that &#8220;He has seen surely something ugly in my face and therefore He laughed; otherwise why my Husband would laugh at seeing me. But what reason can there be as to see ugliness in my face after so long a time. And why shall <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">He laugh without seeing something ugly, without any cause. Or it may be, He has made some other beautiful woman as my co-wife</span>&#8220;. Thus arguing variously in her mind, Mahâ Laksmî gradually got angry and Tamo guna slowly possessed Her. Then, by turn of Fate, in order that god&#8217;s work might be completed, very fierce Tamas Sakti entered into Her body. She got very angry and slowly said:&#8211; &#8220;Let Thy head fall off&#8221;. Thus, owing to feminine nature and the destiny of Bhagvan, Laksmî cursed without any thought of good or bad, causing Her own suffering. By the Tâmasî S&#8217;akti possessing Her, she thought that a co-wife would be more painful than Her widowhood and thus She cursed Him. Falsehood, vain boldness, craftiness, stupidity, impatience, over-greediness, impurity, and harshness are the natural qualities of women. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Owing to that curse, the head of Vasudeva has fallen into the salt ocean</span>. Now I will fix the head on His body as before…&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">VISHNU VS GODS</span></strong></p>
<p>Gods accidentally or deliberately cut off the head of Vishnu. Vishnu slept placing his head at the end of a bow. Gods created white ants and made a deal with them and made them gnaw the bowstring. When they did so it cut off the head of Vishnu,</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana 14.1.1.6-9 Now he who is this Vishnu is the sacrifice; and he who is this sacrifice is yonder Âditya (the sun). But, indeed, Vishnu was unable to control that (love of) glory of his; and so even now not every one can control that (love of) glory of his. Taking his bow, together with three arrows, he stepped forth. He stood, resting his head on the end of the bow. Not daring to attack him, the gods sat themselves down all around him. Then the ants said&#8211;these ants (vamrî), doubtless, were that (kind called) &#8216;upadîkâ &#8216;&#8211;&#8216;What would ye give to him who should gnaw the bowstring?&#8217;&#8211;&#8216;We would give him the (constant) enjoyment of food, and he would find water even in the desert: so we would give him every enjoyment of food.&#8217;&#8211;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">&#8216;So be it,&#8217; they said. Having gone nigh unto him, they gnawed his bowstring. When it was cut, the ends of the bow, springing asunder, cut off Vishnu&#8217;s head</span>.</p>
<p>Srimad Devi Bhagavatam 1.5.23-36 &#8220;Brahmâ said :&#8211; We will give you, too, share in this our Yajña (sacrifice); so hear me; do our work and rouse Visnu from His sleep. During the time of performing Homa whatever ghee will fall outside the Homa-Kund (the sacrificial pit) will fall to your share; so be quick and do this. Sûta said:&#8211; Thus ordered by Brahmâ, the Vamrî insect soon ate away the fore end of the bow that rested on the ground. Immediately the string gave way and the bow went up; the other end became free and a terrible sound took place. The Devas bcame afraid; the whole universe got agitated; the earth trembled. The sea became swollen; the aquatic animals became startled; violent wind blew; the mountains shook; ominous meteors fell. The quarters assumed a terrific aspect; the Sun went down the horizon. In that time of distress the Devas became anxious what evil might come down. O ascetics! while the Devas were thus cogitating, the head with crown on it of the Devadeva Visnu vanished away ; no body knew where it fell. When the awful darkness disappeared, Brahmâ and Mahâdeva saw the disfigured body of Visnu with its head off. Seeing that headless figure of Visnu they were greatly surprised; they were drowned in the ocean of cares and, overwhelmed with grief, began to weep aloud…&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">INDRA VS ARJUNA</span></strong></p>
<p>Although Arjuna wasn&#8217;t a god but his adviser was Krishna so the story can be mentioned here. Actually, it was not a battle between Arjun and Indra but between Arjuna and Ashwasena but Indra decided to fight noticing that his friend&#8217;s son Ashwasena was going to get killed by Arjuna,</p>
<p>Mahabharata Adi Parva 1.229 &#8220;But Aswasena, the mighty son of Takshaka, was there. He made great efforts to escape from that fire; but confined by Arjuna&#8217;s shafts he succeeded not in finding a way. It was then that his mother, the daughter of a snake, determined to save him by swallowing him first. His mother first swallowed his head and then was swallowing his tail. And desirous of saving her son, the sea-snake rose (up from the earth) while still employed in swallowing her son&#8217;s tail. But Arjuna as soon as he beheld her escaping, severed her head from her body by means of a sharp and keen-edged arrow. Indra saw all this, and desiring to save his friend&#8217;s son, the wielder of the thunderbolt, by raising a violent wind, deprived Arjuna of consciousness.&#8221; Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">INDRA VS SAGARA&#8217;S SONS</span></strong></p>
<p>Indra uses his tactics to kill the sons of king Sagara,</p>
<p>As per the story mentioned in Srimad Bhagavatam 9.8. There was a king named Sagara who was the ancestor of Hindu god Ram. He had 60,000 sons. Instructed by sage Aurva, King Sagara performed Ashvamedha sacrifice but Indra stole the horse and left it in sage Kapila&#8217;s Ashram. Indra made Sagara&#8217;s sons lose their intelligence and disrespected the sage. As the sage was meditating and as soon as he opened his eyes the sons of Sagara were burned with the fire emanating from their own bodies</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">INDRA VS VISHWARUPA</span></strong></p>
<p>This is another version of Indra killing Vishwarupa. Geeta Kasturi summarizes the story as,</p>
<p>&#8220;The story goes that rishi Vishvarupa was very fond of his mother. She was from the family of asuras. Prompted by the affection for her, he used to give a portion of the sacrificial oblations secretly to the asuras. Indra detected the treachery of the rishi and cut off the three heads of Vishvarupa.&#8221;</p>
<p>This story iss mentioned in Srimad Bhagavatam (Bhagavad Purana) and Devi Bhagavatam,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 6.9.4 &#8220;Indra, the king of gods, noticed his contempt and faithlessness to gods and his sham righteousness. Being afraid (lest Asuras should be powerful) he immediately cut down (Visvarupa&#8217;s) heads in wrath.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Srimad Devi Bhagavaram 3.12.25 verses says that Vishwarupa would utter Mantras beneficial to gods when they were present and in the absence of gods he would pray for the welfare of Daityas.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">INDRA VS MUNI DADHYAM</span></strong></p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 7.36.28. “O Best of Mountains! It is very difficult to acquire Brahma Jñâna. Hear a story. A Muni named Dadhyam of Atharvana family went to Indra and prayed to him to give Brahma Jñâna. Indra said: &#8220;I would give you Brahma-Jñâna, but if you impart it to any other body, I would sever your head.&#8221; Dadhyarna agreed to this and Indra gave him the Brahma-Jñâna. After a few days, the two As&#8217;vins came to the Muni and prayed for Brahma Vidyâ, The Muni said:&#8211; &#8220;If I give you the Brahma-Vidyi, Indra, will cut off my head.&#8221; Hearing this the two As&#8217;vins said:&#8211; &#8220;We will cut your head and keep it elsewhere and we will attach the head of a horse to your body. Instruct us with the mouth of this horse and when Indra will cut off your this mouth, we will replace your former head.&#8221; When they said so, the Muni gave them the Brahma-Vidyâ. Indra cut off his head by his thunderbolt. When the horse-head of the Muni was cut off, the two physicians of the Devas replaced his original head. This is widely known in all the Vedas.” Tr.

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">VASHISHTHA VS VISHWAMITRA</span></strong></p>
<p>Vishwamitra came to the hermitage of sage Vashishtha. Vashishtha had a genie of the lamp-like cow perhaps known as Kamdhenu who would grant all desires. Vishwamitra became very excited about the cow so he wanted to obtain it and he asked Vasishtha for it and said that in return he would give him many cows. But Vasishtha refused so Vishwamitra became angry and wanted to take it away by force. Vishwamitra&#8217;s sons were killed by Vashistha and to avenge it Vishwamitra started performing austerities in the forest in order to obtain a boon from Shiva. Vrishadwaja (appellation of Shiva) decided to bestow a boon. Vishwamitra asks him to confer the science of archery with all its mysteries and mantras as well as its virtues and also weapons. Then Vishvamitra goes to Vasishtha&#8217;s hermitage and attacks him</p>
<p>Ramayana of Valmiki, Bala Kanda 1.55.5-7 &#8220;And seeing the army annihilated by the high-souled Vasishtha, the hundred sons of Vicwamitra, equipped with various weapons, rushed in high ire against that best of mantra-reciting ones. Thereupon, uttering a roar, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">that might ascetic consumed them quite. And in a moment, Vicwamitra&#8217;s sons together with horse and car and foot were reduced to ashes by the high-souled Vasishtha</span>.&#8221; Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Vishwamitra instigated Rakshasas to kill Vashishtha&#8217;s son and Vashishtha&#8217;s sons were also killed. And in grief, Vashishtha&#8217;s tried to commit suicide by jumping from a mountain but he fell on a heap of cotton, then he torched the forest and entered it but it didn&#8217;t burn him and then he tied a weight to his neck and drowned himself in the waters but even that didn&#8217;t kill him. He came to know that his daughter in law is pregnant so he gave up the idea of committing suicide,</p>
<p>Mahabharata Adi Parva 1.178.41-49 &#8220;Beholding Saktri thus slain and devoured, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Viswamitra repeatedly urged that Rakshasa (who was within the monarch) against the other sons of Vasishtha. Like a wrathful lion devouring small animals, that Rakshasa soon devoured the other sons of the illustrious Vasishtha that were junior to Saktri in age</span>. But Vasishtha, learning that all his sons had been caused to be slain by Viswamitra, patiently bore his grief like the great mountain that bears the earth. That best of Munis, that foremost of intelligent men, was resolved rather to sacrifice his own life than exterminate (in anger) the race of Kusikas. The illustrious Rishi threw himself down from the summit of Meru, but he descended on the stony ground as though on a heap of cotton. And, O son of Pandu, when the illustrious one found that death did not result from that fall, he kindled a huge fire in the forest and entered it with alacrity. But that fire, though burning brightly, consumed him not. O slayer of foes, that blazing fire seemed to him cool. Then the great Muni under the influence of grief, beholding the sea, tied a stony weight to his neck and threw himself into its waters. But the waves soon cast him ashore. At last when that Brahmana of rigid vows succeeded not in killing himself by any means, he returned, in distress of heart, to his asylum.&#8221; Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>

<h2><a id="sins-hell"></a>Sins leading to hell</h2>
<p>Hinduism too has the concept of heaven and hell but unlike Abrahamic religions, Hinduism has temporary heaven and hell. The reason I am mentioning it here is because it refutes the claim of deceitful Hindus on the internet who claims that &#8216;You are free to do anything, you will not be put into hell for doing this or that thing&#8217;. Hinduism lists several sins that could lead one to hell, I am mentioning some of them like not worshiping Shivling leads one to hell, who doesn’t observe Yajnas, those who don’t follow the path laid down by Vedas, etc.,</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Vidyeshvara Samhita 1, chapter 19, verse 26 &#8220;If a brahmin does not worship the earthen phallic image he shall fall in the terrible hell with a terrible trident pierced through his body.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>

A person who does not maintain his parents, chaste wife, spiritual guide, and widowed sister, and widowed daughter goes to hell. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">If a Ksatriya, Vais&#8217;ya or Sudra male has no faith in Hari or a Brahmin and if a youthful woman has no faith in her husband, then these wretches undoubtedly suffer the torments of hell</span>&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Rajendra Nath Sen</p>
<p>Skanda Purana III.ii.18.156-7 &#8220;She creates obstacles for a foolish one who does not worship. He will have to witness death of the couple, destruction of wealth, great fear, pain, sickness and incidents of arson. For this reason, O Brahmanas, an intelligent devotee should worship Matangi.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 9.35.1-44 &#8220;…<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">If any Brâhmana does not worship with devotion the phallic emblem of S&#8217;iva, he goes to the dreadful S&#8217;ûlaprota Kunda for that heinous sin</span>.

<p>Narada Purana I.15.130b-131a &#8220;Those who have ceased to perform the rites and the yajnas for Pitrs (manes) and Devas, those who stay outside the part of the Vedas, are notorious as heretics. They undergo all sorts of tortures.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Narada Purana I.15.89 &#8220;Those who have abandoned the five great sacrifices go to the hell Lalabhaksa. One who abandons worship goes to the hell Raurava. [96b-97] The person who abandons his religious duties is called a heretic by learned men. He and a person who associates with him are great sinners. They fall into hells in a serial order, in the course of thousand and millions of kalpas.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Skanda Purana II.iv.6.26 &#8220;Those foolish persons who revile noble-souled Vaisnavas, fall into hell named Maharaurava along with their manes.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana: Lalit-Mahatmya 33.84-86 &#8220;The glorious Maharudra who holds the trident is served by other Rudras, the chief among whom is Hiranyabahu. He is accompanied by those Rudranis too. With the tip of his trident, he pierces those persons who have neglected visiting Lalita, who are haughty, and who are repoached by elderly people. He burns them by means of fierce fires originating from his eyes. He destroys their wives, children and servants, He is the great hero who obediently carries out the behest of Lalitha.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Brahma Purana 106.33-38-41 &#8220;Yama&#8217;s servants said: You have not performed sacrifices at the proper time. You have not offered gifts to the brahmins. Moreover, when something was offered to brahmins you had actively prevented it. The time for the reaping of the fruits of that sin has arrived, O base men, your assets were not burnt by fire nor did they perish in water. They had not been seized by kings or robbers. Where are they now? Why were they not handed over to brahmins&#8230;On hearing the words of Yama&#8217;s servants they lose their taste therein. They are afflicted by hunger and thirst (all the more). Thereafter they are tortured by the servants of Yama with terrible weapons. The ruthless emissaries of Yama attack them from the rear with iron clubs, iron-rods, javelins, tomaras, pattisas, bhindipalas and parighas. They are bit and pierced by arrows, axes and maces. The sinners are attacked from the front by lions, tigers etc. and are eaten up by them.&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Varaha Purana 134.61-64 &#8220;Varaha said: O Earth, I shall tell you what happens to the man who offers forbidden flower for me&#8230;Fools alone dare to offer me like this and they fall into the hell called Raurava, and then, because of their ignorance, undergo a lot of suffering.

<p>Shiva Purana, Uma Samhita 5.10.19-20 &#8220;If men, out of greed, pluck and sniff at flowers of the temple parks, or wear them on their heads, their heads are covered with iron spikes and their noses are filled with plenty of acid and other things.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Linga Purana Section II.18.60-62 &#8220;&#8230;The lord said thus:-&#8216;O excellent-faced lady, a person who applies Bhasman is on a par with my son Ganesa. What is repugnant to them should be eschewed. A householder who is devoid of Brahman (Vedic knowledge) and who does not wear the caste mark Tripundra falls into the depths of hell. All his holy rites of worship, charitable gifts and holy ablutions are in vain like the Homa performed in the ashes.&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Vayu Purana Section II.21.59-61 &#8220;Brhaspati said: The man who after hearing this explanation of the procedure of Sraddhas, becomes malicious, is an atheist enveloped in darkness. He will drown himself in the terrible hell. He who has perfectly controlled his mind, finds all his great ailments terminated. He who is not mindful of the Asramas (stages of life) stated in the Vedas attains the Kumbhika hell. He attains the status of a thief and gets his tongue cut. Those who censure Yoga become lumps of clay in the ocean and decay as long as earth exists. Hence, this is the Dharma (virtue) intended in the Sraddha that it should be performed by a man with faith (in it.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare, edited by G.P. Bhatt</p>

<p>Shiva Purana Vayaviyasamhita 6, Section II, 41.38 &#8220;This excellent gem of Sivapurana, should not be mentioned to those who do not know the Vedas, nor should it be imparted to a disciple who is not a devotee of Siva nor to an atheist.

<h3><a id="hinduism-salvation"></a>Hinduism is the only way to salvation</h3>
<p>Contrary to the much hype by Hindus. One should worship a Deva, believe in the Vedas, and sacrifice to the gods in order to attain salvation, if he doesn&#8217;t then he keeps taking rebirth and is also put in hell in between the cycles of birth as punishment. Attaining heaven is the main aim of Abrahamic religions but attaining salvation is the main aim of Hinduism. It&#8217;s mentioned in the Vedas,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 9.73.9 &#8220;The thread of the cosmic sacrifice, spread over the ultraphychic filter, extends as if, by its act up to the tip of venerable Lord&#8217;s tongue; the prudent devotees attain it; <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">but he who is incompetent and faithless shall sink into the pit of hell</span>, even whilst he is in this world.&#8221; Tr. Svami Satya Prakash Saraswati</p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.164.39 &#8220;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">They are atheists and of weak intellect, and continually remain sunk in the depths of misery and pain who do not believe in, know</span>, and commune with, Him who is Resplendent, All-glorious, All-Holy, All-knowledge, sustainer of the sun, the earth and other planets, Who pervades all like ether, is the Lord of all and is above all devatas. It is by the knowledge and contemplation of God alone that all men attain true happiness.&#8221; Tr. Dr. Chiranjiva Bhardwaja, as mentioned in the book Satyarth Prakash, By Swami Dayanand Saraswati, Ch 7, page 203.</p>
<p>Krishna said,</p>
<p>Gita 9.3 &#8220;Those who are not faithful in this devotional service cannot attain Me, O conqueror of enemies. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Therefore they return to the path of birth and death in this material world</span>.&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 11.21.1 &#8220;The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Those who give up these methods for achieving Me</span>, which consist of devotional service, analytic philosophy and regulated execution of prescribed duties, and instead, being moved by the material senses, cultivate insignificant sense gratification, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">certainly undergo the continual cycle of material existence</span>.&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>He also said,</p>
<p>Gita 8.11-13 &#8220;Persons who are learned in the Vedas, who utter oṁ-kāra, and who are great sages in the renounced order enter into Brahman. Desiring such perfection, one practices celibacy. I shall now brieﬂy explain to you this process by which one may attain salvation. The yogic situation is that of detachment from all sensual engagements. Closing all the doors of the senses and ﬁxing the mind on the heart and the life air at the top of the head, one establishes himself in yoga. After being situated in this yoga practice and vibrating the sacred syllable oṁ, the supreme combination of letters, if one thinks of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and quits his body, he will certainly reach the spiritual planets.&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Gita 4.40 &#8220;The ignorant fool, one without faith in Vedic scriptures, and one afflicted by inner doubt and uncertainty is ruined and for one afflicted by doubt and uncertainty there is no happiness in this world nor the next.&#8221;</p>
<p>Brahma Purana 65.71-73 &#8220;Thus O brahmins is the greatest abode of Visnu endowed with all enjoyable pleasures and attributes. It is conducive to the pleasures of everyone. It is holy and full of mysteries. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Atheists and profligates do not go there</span>. Nor do the following go there viz.-the ungrateful and those who are of uncontrollable sense-organs. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The devotees of Visnu who worship Vasudeva the preceptor of the universe with devotion, go to the world of Visnu</span>.&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Skanda Purana II.ii.26.28-33 &#8220;&#8230;One who installs the idol of Hari in accordance with the injunctions in the Mansion does not get involved in the bondage of physical bodies. He goes to the great region of Visnu.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Narada Purana I.41.106 &#8220;It is only through the repetition of the names of Hari that redemption is attained by the people who commit sins, who are beyond the pale of Vedic path and who are wanting in mental purity.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 7.1.32 &#8220;Somehow or other, one must consider the form of Kṛṣṇa very seriously. Then, by one of the five different processes mentioned above, one can return home, back to Godhead. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Atheists like King Vena, however, being unable to think of Kṛṣṇa&#8217;s form in any of these five ways, cannot attain salvation</span>. Therefore, one must somehow think of Kṛṣṇa, whether in a friendly way or inimically.&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 5.26.3 &#8220;…And for one who acts impiously and ignorantly because of atheism, the resultant hellish life is the worst. Because of ignorance, every living entity has been carried by various desires into thousands of different hellish planets since time immemorial. I shall try to describe them as far as possible.&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagvatam 6.1.40 &#8220;The Yamadūtas replied: That which is prescribed in the Vedas constitutes dharma, the religious principles, and the opposite of that is irreligion. The Vedas are directly the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Nārāyaṇa, and are self-born. This we have heard from Yamarāja.&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Srimad Devi Bhagavatam 6.6.29-32. &#8220;The Munis said:&#8211; &#8220;O King! All the creatures certainly enjoy the fruits of their Karmas, whether good or bad; how then, can persons, of perverted intellect, obtain peace when they do mischief to others. The treacherous persons certainly go to hell and suffer miseries always. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The slayers of Brâhmanas and the drunkards may get liberation; but never the faithless</span> and those who go against their friends get off free; <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">these will have to suffer undoubtedly in the hells</span>.&#8221; Tr.

<p>Srimad Devi Bhagavatam 6.11.57-65. &#8220;Vyâsa said:&#8211; O King! There is only one path and none other which can save a man from the sin of this Kâlî; and that is this:&#8211; The Jîvas must meditate on the lotus-feet of the Highest Devî for the purification of all their faults and sins. O King! There is so much strength in Her sin-destroying Name, that the amount of sin in this world falls much less in proportion to that. Where, then, is the cause of fear? Her Name, uttered at random, even in an unconscious state, bestows so much unspeakable results that even Hari, Hara and others have not the capacity to know that.&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>

<h2><a id="atheism"></a>Atheism</h2>
<p>This is a very important topic for discussion. Hindus claim that you can even be an atheist and attain salvation. I don&#8217;t really know what is the basis of this claim. They should furnish references showing that even an atheist who doesn&#8217;t believe in god and Veda, who never sacrificed for Devas or worshipped them can go to heaven temporarily and attain salvation. I am not challenging them but asking for educational purposes. Buddhism and Jainism are condemned in Hindu scriptures because of their atheistic doctrines then how can Hindus claim that you can be an atheist? Why do Hindu scriptures lay stress on the atheistic doctrines of Buddhism and Jainism while condemning them and rejecting them as false religions? Now they cite Mimamsa philosophy to support their argument, such atheistic doctrines are later entrants to Hinduism probably to counter Buddhism. Do they even know what Mimamsa is? Mimamsa has both theistic and atheistic doctrines, it rejects a personal god but believes in the authority of the Vedas. Now you tell me, is there any atheist on the face of this earth who claims the Vedas to be authoritative? Atheism is strongly condemned in Hindu scriptures, Vedas even call for the death of godless atheists. Buddha is criticized for rejecting the Vedas so how can Hindus claim this? If they want to prove that Atheists can attain salvation then they should furnish references showing that a man who doesn&#8217;t believe in god, in Vedas, in Brahmins, who doesn&#8217;t worship and who doesn&#8217;t sacrifice can attain salvation. That&#8217;s it. No need for further discussion. Hindu scholars have also translated the word Nastika as an infidel. Nastika in Sanskrit is literally translated as Atheist. But in Vedic (Hindu scriptures) terminology an atheist doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean the one who doesn&#8217;t believe in god, but it has several meanings like a non-Hindu is also considered to be an atheist, a censurer of Vedas is also considered an atheist, etc, let me present some sources,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 9.13.9 “O Pavamamas, driving off the godless, looking on the light, Sit in the place of sacrifice.” Tr. Ralph. T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>Rig Veda 7.6.3 “The foolish, faithless, rudely-speaking niggards, without belief or sacrifice or worship,— Far far sway hath Agni chased those Dasytis, and, in the cast, hath turned the godless westward.” Tr. Ralph. T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>Kurma Purana II.24.10 &#8220;He who is one who maintains sacrificial fires but does not wish to perform sacrifice to the lord by means of meditation, is a confused person. He should not be conversed with. What more (need be said) that man is an atheist.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Varaha Purana 58.5-6 &#8220;Visnu should be considered as Rudra and Laksmi as Gauri. He who speaks of difference between them is lowly (Adhama) and should be considered an atheist outside the field of dharma.&#8221; Tr. Venkitasubramonia Iyer, J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 4.2.30 &#8220;Bhṛgu Muni continued: Since you blaspheme the Vedas and the brāhmaṇas, who are followers of the Vedic principles, it is understood that you have already taken shelter of the doctrine of atheism.&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>&#8220;The &#8216;infidel&#8217; is one who has no religion, his son is &#8216;the son of an infidel&#8217;. <strong>Vijnanesvara in Mitakshara on Yajnavalkya Smriti verse 244</strong></p>
<p>Swami Prabhupada wrote, &#8220;…An atheist is called a demon, and it is a fact that even a person born of good parents can turn into a demon by bad association…&#8221; <strong>Swami Prabhupada on Srimad Bhagavatam 3.3.6</strong><br />

<p>Swami Prabhupada also wrote, &#8220;Bhṛgu Muni, in cursing Nandīśvara, said that not only would they be degraded as atheists because of this curse, but they had already fallen to the standard of atheism because they had blasphemed the Vedas, which are the source of human civilization. Human civilization is based on the qualitative divisions of social order, namely the intelligent class, the martial class, the productive class and the laborer class. The Vedas provide the right direction for advancing in spiritual cultivation and economic development and regulating the principle of sense gratification, so that ultimately one may be liberated from material contamination to his real state of spiritual identification (ahaṁ brahmāsmi). As long as one is in the contamination of material existence, one changes bodies from the aquatics up to the position of Brahmā, but the human form of life is the highest perfectional life in the material world. The Vedas give directions by which to elevate oneself in the next life. The Vedas are the mother for such instructions, and the brāhmaṇas, or persons who are in knowledge of the Vedas, are the father. Thus if one blasphemes the Vedas and brāhmaṇas, naturally one goes down to the status of atheism. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The exact word used in Sanskrit is nāstika, which refers to one who does not believe in the Vedas but manufactures some concocted system of religion</span>…&#8221; <strong>Swami Prabhupada on Srimad Bhagavatam 4.2.30 </strong>http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_4.2.30</p>
<p><strong>He also wrote</strong>, &#8220;The Buddhists are called atheists because they have no respect for the Vedas, but those who defy the Vedic conclusions, as above mentioned, under the pretense of being followers of the Vedas, are verily more dangerous than the Buddhists.&#8221; <a href="http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_Introduction" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_Introduction<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 4.2.30 &#8220;By blaspheming the principles of the Vedas, which are the pure and supreme path of the saintly persons, certainly you followers of Bhūtapati, Lord Śiva, will descend to the standard of atheism without a doubt.&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>

<p>Kurma Purana II.19.31-32 &#8220;If any Brahmana does not practise his duty either due to atheism or due to lethargy, he falls into the terrible hells and is reborn as a crow. There is no other way for liberation excepting performance of the duties of one&#8217;s own Asrama (stage of life). Hence one should perform the holy rites for the satisfaction of Paramesthin (god Brahma).&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 3.17.5-7 “PARÁŚARA.&#8211;The Rig, Yajur, and Sáma Vedas constitute the triple covering of the several castes, and the sinner who throws this off is said to be naked (or apostate). The three Vedas are the raiment of all the orders of men, and when that is discarded they are left bare. On this subject hear what I heard my grandfather, the pious Vaśisht́ha, relate to the magnanimous Bhíshma.” Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Skanda Purana V.ii.67.23-31 &#8220;&#8230;[Isvara said] a voice issued from the firmament as uttered by me in compassion: &#8216;Do not say anything out of the way. The immutable Srutis should not be censured. The Puranas spoken by Brahma, the creator of the worlds, cannot be otherwise. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The atheists who censure the Puranas and Dharmasastras fall into the terrible hell and remain there till all living beings are annihilated</span>.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Narasima Purana 53.15-16 &#8220;&#8230;I salute god Kesava the supreme intuitive, who protects the godly persons who are religion abiding by killing the wicked and atheists through his incarnation in varied forms and in every age&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Joshi K.L. Shastri and Bindiya Trivedi</p>
<p>Atheists are condemned in Hindu scriptures,</p>
<p>Brahma Purana 46.60-61 &#8220;This hymn is conducive to wealth. It dispels sins. It is auspicious. It bestows worldly pleasures and salvation. It is a rare esoteric secret. It is sacred. It should not be imparted to any one and everyone. It should not be imparted to an atheist, a fool, an ungrateful person, an arrogant or to one of wicked intellect. It should never be handed over to a knave.&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Brahma Purana 60.16 &#8220;O excellent Brahmins, the knowledge of the purana should not be imparted to an atheist&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Kurma Purana II.26.67 &#8220;A person who knows Dharma should not offer even water to an atheist or a heretic or to a sceptic or to a person who does not know the Vedas.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Brahmanda purana 2.3.14.43 &#8220;One shall discard the very sight of these viz-the Brahman slayer, the ungrateful one, the atheist, the defiled of the preceptor&#8217;s bed, the robber and the ruthless person.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Kurma Purana II.21.43-44 &#8220;The following are defilers of rows:- an ungrateful person, a back-biter, a ruthless person, an atheist, person who censures the Vedas, a person injuring friends and a cheat. All these should not be fed (in a Sraddha). They cannot be given any gift in holy rites&#8230;&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Brahma Purana 137.52-53 &#8220;Thus, O excellent sages, the great Liberation, the essences, has been recounted by me. On realising it one does not return. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">It should not be imparted to an atheist or to a person who is not a devotee</span>. O brahmins, it should not be imparted to an evil-minded person nor to a person who has no faith and who is averse to everything good.&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>

<p>Rig Veda 1.33.4 &#8220;&#8230;As atheistic un-righteous persons who revile God are ruined by His Powers or germs are destroyed by the rays of the sun, in the same manner, you should endeavour to put an end to the lives of those wicked persons who forcibly take away and enjoy other&#8217;s articles and who do not perform Yajnas and other noble deeds who are utterly selfish.&#8221; Tr. Acharya Dharma Deva Vidya Martanda</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t use some of these Vedic verses in the article Killing infidels in Vedas. Just look at what Muni Ved Vyasa says in Mahabharata,</p>
<p>Mahabharata Santi Parva 12.34-35 &#8220;[Vyasa said] I shall now mention other acts that men should not do, viz., acts that are interdicted by both the world and the Vedas. Listen to me with concentrated attention. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The rejection of one&#8217;s own creed, the practice of other people&#8217;s creed</span>, assisting at the sacrifice or the religious rites of one that is not worthy of such assistance…<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">these all have been pronounced by persons conversant with duty to be acts that no one should do</span>.&#8221; Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Other Mahabharata verses show how infidels are roasted in hell,</p>
<p>Mahabharata, Santi Parva 12.181.4-5 &#8220;Those that are virtuous in their acts, and possessed of faith, and that have their senses under control, become born as affluent men and repeatedly sport in festivities and heaven and happiness. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Unbelievers, with their arms manacled, are sent to regions rendered inaccessible by carnivorous beasts and elephants and full of terrors in consequence of snakes and robbers</span>. What more need be said of them?&#8221; Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Mahabharata, Santi Parva 12.323 &#8220;They that are unbelievers have to pass, with groping hands, through regions infested by beasts of prey and elephants and pathless tracts teeming with snakes and robbers and other causes of fear. What more need be said of these?&#8221; Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 3.9.4 &#8220;&#8230;we offer obeisance to you (a gracious) Lord who is spurned by the atheists (like Mimamsakas, Sankhyas etc.) and believers in false logic and who therefore deserve (stay in) Hell.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Buddhists beware you will go</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;">to hell</span></strong>,</p>
<p>Srimad Devi Bhagavatam 11.1.25-37 &#8220;…<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Whatever goes clearly against the Vedas can in no way be accepted as a proof. In matters concerning Dharma, the Vedas is the Sole Proof</span>. Therefore that which is not against the Vedas can be taken as proof; otherwise not. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Whoever acts Dharma according to other proofs than what is ordained in the Vedas, goes to the hell in the abode of Yama to get his lesson</span>. So the Dharma that is by all means to be accepted as such, is what is stated in the Vedas. The Smritis, the Purâ<span style="text-decoration: underline;">n</span>as, or the Tantra S&#8217;âstras can be taken also as authoritative when they are not conflicting to Vedas. Any other S&#8217;âstras can be taken as authoritative when it is fundamentally coincident with the Vedas. Else it can never be accepted. Those who do injury to others even by the blade of a Kus&#8217;a grass used as a weapon, go to hell with their heads downwards and their feet upwards. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Those that follow their own sweet free will, that take up any sort of dress (e. g. Bauddhas)</span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">those that follow the philosophical doctrines called Pâs&#8217;upatas, and the other hermits and saints and persons that take up other vows contrary to the religions of the Vedas, for example, the Vaikhânasa followers, those who brand their bodies by the hot Mudrâs, at the places of pilgrimages, e. g. Dvârkâ, etc., </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">they go to hell with their bodies scorched by red hot brands (Tapta Mudrâs)</span>. So persons should act according to the excellent religions commanded by the Vedas…&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Padma Purana VI.253.36-39 &#8220;That devotee of Visnu, who does not practise the acts prescribed in the Srutis and Smrtis, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">becomes a heretic, and would stay in the Raurava hell</span>. Therefore, a man should offer to the lord of the world a worship fit for his caste&#8230;&#8221; Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p>Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Krishna Janma Khanda 75.62-77 &#8220;&#8230;A Brahmin who does not worship Visnu is like a Chandal; and one who adopts the tenets of Bama (name of Gouri, Laksmi or Saraswati) goes to hell&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Rajendra Nath Sen</p>
<p>Narada Purana, Uttarabhaga 21.38 &#8220;These persons are to be punished and given capital punishment- he who eschews Visnu the foremost among the gods and worships any other deity&#8230;&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Skanda Purana VII.I.3.144 &#8220;Thus the foolish ones will say, others will laugh. The non-beleivers, the people destined to fall into hell, get their minds overwhelmed by sins. At the advent of Kali Age, they will never gain Siddhi.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Krisna Janma Khanda 75.73-82 &#8220;&#8230;Even the worship of Siva&#8217;s male organ for one time after having constructed it with clay or cow dung and sand secures dwelling in heaven for a hundred ages: and whoever worships a hundred such organs obtains the desired meed; and whoever worships a hundred thousand such organs attains the position of S&#8217;iva, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">but one who does not worship S&#8217;va goes to hell. Those who slander or calumniate the venerable, and most lovely S&#8217;iva dwell in hell as long as Brahma exists and suffer endless torments</span>.&#8221; Tr. Rajendra Nath Sen.</p>
<p>Linga Purana Section II.11.35-37 &#8220;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">If people forsake Linga and begin to worship other deities they will go to the Raurava hell along with the king</span>, their ruler. If a king ceases to be a devotee of Siva and becomes attached to other Devas, it is like the behaviour of a young woman who discarding her husband revels among her paramours.&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Kurma Purana I.12.259-61 &#8220;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The hells such as Tamisra and others were created beneath the earth by god Brahma for those people who do not practise the duties prescribed in my Dharma</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">There is no scripture other than the Vedas which lays down what is Dharma</span>. A person who takes delight in other things (not sanctioned by the Vedas), should not even talked to by twice-born persons viz. Brahmanas, Ksatriyas and Vaisyas. Those various scriptures which are contrary to Srutis and Smrtis seen in this world, are based on Tamo-guna or ignorance. Belief in them or practising in accordance with them is a Tamasa activity.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Padma Purana V.96.49b-76a &#8220;Yama said: Those men who are averse to religion through their deeds mind and words, and <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">who are without (i.e. who do not have) devotion to Visnu, go to hell</span>. Those men who look upon Brahma, Sankara and Visnu as different (from one another), and who are detached from knowledge about Visnu, go to hell&#8230;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">A man who worships what should not be worshipped, and does not worship what should be worshipped, and is disinterested in the knowledge about Visnu, suffers in many hells</span>&#8230;Those who, when proper time has come, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">do not devoutly offer sraddha through atheism or greed or delusion are roasted in hell&#8230;and who is inclined to atheism, would live in the abode of hell</span>&#8230;Those who, even after seeing the door of (the temple of) the lord or (even after hearing) his name or the sacred text (even after seeing) his attendants, do not salute etc. become the residents of hell&#8230;.&#8221; Tr.

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Who becomes an infidel?</span></strong></p>
<p>As you may know, whatever we are today is because of the deeds of our past lives as per Hinduism. A person is born as a Shudra or a Chandala because he committed theft in his previous life etc. So what makes one non-Hindu?</p>
<p>Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Krishna Janma Khanda 85.159-169 &#8220;&#8230;One the days of the five important festivals, a man must abstain from woman, oil, fish and flesh. The great fool who violates this rule must go to the hell called &#8216;the tooth of thunder or adamant.&#8217; <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">That sinner after having lived there in great pain turns into an infidel for seven births</span> and a chandal for seven births. <span style="color: #ff0000;">A wretch who does not bow to a Brahmin or an idol remains impure all his life and is afterwards born as an infidel</span>.&#8221; Tr.

<h2><a id="punishment-apostasy"></a>Punishment for Apostasy</h2>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 5.26.14-15 &#8220;He who bears malice towards his parents, Brahmanas and the Vedas is hurled into the hell called Kalasutra. It is a plain of a copper-sheet ten thousand Yojanas in area. The sheet of copper is heated by fire from below and the Sun from above&#8230;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">They (servants of Yama) throw in the hell called Arispatravana (a forest of trees with sword-like leaves) a person who, while in this world, abandons his Vedic way of life even when there was no calamity and embraces a heretic sect. They strike him with a whip. And while he runs hither and thither (to avoid whipping), all the limbs of his body are cut down by the two-edged sword-like leaves of the palm trees thereof</span>. Crying with exceuciating pain, &#8216;Alas! I am killed&#8217;, he falls in a swoon at every step. A renegade from one&#8217;s faith he reaps the fruit (punishment) suitable for the sin of embracing a heretic creed.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Other translators have translated similarly.</p>
<p><strong>Manmath Nath Dutt translates it as</strong> &#8220;&#8230;He that, when no danger threatens, forsakes the path of the Veda and follows that of a heretic, is thrown by the servants of Yama into the hell named Asipatravana, and is lashed by them. The sinner, sore afflicted, rusheth about hither and thither. The leaves of the palmyra palm growing in the wood have two sharp edges like that of swords, and these teat his body grievously. Then the wreth, suffering greatly, exclaims: &#8216;Ah! I am undone&#8217;; and stumbles at every step on account of the severe torment he undegoes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Srimad Devi Bhagavatam 8.22.2-52 &#8220;…The man who, getting even a trifling wealth and food-stuff, does not perform the five Mahâ Yajñâs and gives not a share of that to the Devas and feeds his own belly with that like a crow, is taken by the ferocious Yamadûtas to the worst Krimibhojana Naraka for his sinful deeds. This hell is one lakh Yoyanas wide and is the reservoir of worms. It causes terror to the inhabitants of the hell. That sinner assumes the form of an insect and is eaten up on return by the insects and thus passes his time there.

<h3><a id="examples"></a>Examples</h3>
<p>There are some examples where demons devoted to Devas were killed soon after they left the Vedic religion and embraced other religions like Buddhism and Jainism. There is a story of the sons of Raji being killed by Indra after Brihaspati deludes them to leave the Vedic religion and converts them to Jainism.</p>
<p>Matysa Purana 24.47-49 &#8220;&#8230;<span style="color: #ff0000;">Brihaspati then went and deluded the other sons of Raji with </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">false philosophy and established the Jina religion</span> opposed to the Vedas, though himself a knower of the Vedas and <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Indra on finding the sons of Brihaspati propagating a religion different from the Vedas based on a show of reason only killed them with his mighty thunderbolt</span>.&#8221; Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>Rig Veda 8.85.15 might be related to this verse.</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 4.19.6-7 &#8220;…replied Vrihaspati, &#8220;I had been applied to by you before, I could have done anything for you that you wished; as it is, I will endeavour and restore you in a few days to your sovereignty.&#8221; So saying, he commenced a sacrifice for the purpose of increasing the might of Indra, and of leading the sons of Raji into error, and so effecting their downfall. Misled by their mental fascination, the princes became enemies of the Brahmans, regardless of their duties, and contemners of the precepts of the Vedas; and thus devoid of morality and religion, they were slain by Indra, who by the assistance of the priest of the gods resumed his place in heaven…&#8221; Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 9.17.15 &#8220;Brhaspati, then offered oblations to fire (with malevolent purpose against the sons of Raji and made them stray from the path of religion) and Indra slew them once and all as they swerved from the path (of righteousness) and not a single son (of Raji) survived.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Also mentioned in Vishnu Purana book 4 chapter 9 which H.H. Wilson summarizes as &#8220;Descendants of Raji, son of Áyus: Indra resigns his throne to him: claimed after his death by his sons, who apostatize from the religion of the Vedas, and are destroyed by Indra. Descendants of Pratíkshatra, son of Kshatravriddha.&#8221;</p>
<p>A story in Shiva Purana goes like this,</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Rudra Samhita 2, Yuddhakanda 5, chapter 4, verses 1 &#8220;[Sanathkumara said] For causing obstacles in their virtuous activities, Visnu of great brilliance, created a Purusa* born of himself. [9-12] <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Let your name be Arihat</span>. You will have other auspicious names too. I shall assign to you a place afterwards. Now hear with reverence what is relevant to the context. O you who wield Maya, create a deceptive sacred text of sixteen hundred thousand verses, contrary to Srutis and Smritis wherein Varnas and Asramas shall be eschewed. Let that holy text be in Apabramsa language&#8230;I shall bestow on you the ability to create it. Different kinds of magic arts shall be subsevient to you. [18-20] O ascetic, no doubt, Vedic and Smarta rites flourish and shine there. But these shall certainly be exploded through this Vidya. O you shaven head, you shall go there for destroying the residents of the three cities. Revealing the Tamasika rites, destroy the three cities. After that, O great one, you shall go to the desert region and stay there carrying on your own duties and activities till the advent of the Kali age. When the Kali age begins let your Dharma be revealed. You shall then continue to do so by means of disciples and disciple&#8217;s disciples.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Rudrasamhita 2, Yuddha Khanda 5, chapter 10, verse 29 &#8220;Since they had refrained from the worship of Siva, hundreds of Asuras were burnt by the fire generated by the arrow. They cried &#8216;Ha Ha&#8217; in distress.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>This story is about the burning of Tripura. This is about Jina (Jain) religion. As per this story, the residents of Tripura followed the Vedic religion and they couldn&#8217;t be killed so Vishnu created an illusory form and named him Arihat and when the residents abandoned the Vedic religion, they were burnt alive. The translator Jagdish Lal Shastri writes on the footnote of Shiva Purana, Rudra Samhita 2, Yuddhakanda 5.4.1,</p>
<p>&#8220;*According to the present context Visnu created a delusive teacher called Mayamoha who created a Mayasastra of sixteen lakhs of slokas in Apabhramsa, preaching Jina Dharma for misguiding the Asuras. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mayamoha created four sorts of preachers for the propagation of Jina Dharma</span>. He preached non-violence, forbade Srauta and Smarta rituals, discarded Varnasrama system, created an order for women that resulted in leaving their home and leading the life of nuns. In some versions, the role is assigned to Brhaspati, the preceptor of the Gods who in the guise of their preceptor Sukra deludes the Asuras&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana also has a similar story wherein demons were killed after they abandoned the Vedic religion and embraced Jainism and Buddhism. H.H. Wilson writes on chapter 4.17-18</p>
<p>&#8220;Of heretics, or those who reject the authority of the Vedas: their origin, as described by Vaśisht́ha to Bhíshma: the gods, defeated by the Daityas, praise Vishńu: an illusory being, or Buddha, produced from his body.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Buddha goes to the earth, and teaches the Daityas to contemn the Vedas: his sceptical doctrines: his prohibition of animal sacrifices. Meaning of the term Bauddha. Jainas and Bauddhas; their tenets. The Daityas lose their power, and are overcome by the gods. Meaning of the term Nagna. Consequences of neglect of duty. Story of Śatadhanu and his wife Śaivyá. Communion with heretics to be shunned.&#8221;</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 3.17.35-44 &#8220;…Upon the conclusion of their prayers, the gods beheld the sovereign deity Hari, armed with the shell, the discus, and the mace, riding on Garud́a. Prostrating themselves before him, they addressed him, and said, &#8220;Have compassion upon us, O lord, and protect us, who have come to thee for succour from the Daityas. They have seized upon the three worlds, and appropriated the offerings which are our portion, taking care not to transgress the precepts of the Veda. Although we, as well as they, are parts of thee, of whom all beings consist, yet we behold the world impressed by the ignorance of unity, with the belief of its separate existence. Engaged in the duties of their respective orders, and following the paths prescribed by holy writ, practising also religious penance, it is impossible for us to destroy them. Do thou, whose wisdom is immeasurable, instruct us in some device by which we may be able to exterminate the enemies of the gods.&#8221; <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #000000;">When the mighty Vishńu heard their request, he emitted from his body an illusory form</span>, which he gave to the gods, and thus spake <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">This deceptive vision shall wholly beguile the Daityas, so that, being led astray from the path of the Vedas, they may be put to death; for all gods, demons, or others, who shall be opposed to the authority of the Veda, shall perish by my might</span>, whilst exercised for the preservation of the world. Go then, and fear not: let this delusive vision precede you; it shall this day be of great service unto you, oh gods!&#8221; Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 3.18.1-11 &#8220;PARÁŚARA.&#8211;After this, the great delusion, having proceeded to earth, beheld the Daityas engaged in ascetic penances upon the banks of the Narmadá river; and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">approaching them in the semblance of a naked mendicant, with his head shaven, and carrying a bunch of peacock&#8217;s feathers</span>, he thus addressed them in gentle accents: &#8220;Ho, lords of the Daitya race! wherefor is it that you practise these acts of penance? is it with a view to recompense in this world, or in another?&#8221; &#8220;Sage,&#8221; replied the Daityas, &#8220;we pursue these devotions to obtain a reward hereafter; why should you make such an inquiry?&#8221; &#8220;If you are desirous of final emancipation,&#8221; answered the seeming ascetic, &#8220;attend to my words, for you are worthy of a revelation which is the door to ultimate felicity. The duties that I will teach you are the secret path to liberation; there are none beyond or superior to them: by following them you shall obtain either heaven or exemption from future existence. You, mighty beings, are deserving of such lofty doctrine.&#8221; By such persuasions, and by many specious arguments, did this delusive being mislead the Daityas from the tenets of the Vedas…&#8221; Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>This is a reference to Digambara Jains. Jain saints still carry peacock feathers with their heads shaven and roam naked.</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 3.18.7-14 &#8220;…might be the duty of those who go naked, or who go clothed in much raiment: and so the Daityas were seduced from their proper duties by the repeated lessons of their illusory preceptor, maintaining the equal truth of contradictory tenets; and they were called Arhatas, from the phrase he had employed of &#8220;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Ye are worthy (Arhatha) of this great doctrine;&#8221; that is, of the false doctrines which he persuaded them to embrace</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The foes of the gods being thus induced to apostatize from the religion of the Vedas</span>, by the delusive person sent by Vishńu, became in their turn teachers of the same heresies, and perverted others; and these, again, communicating their principles to others, by whom they were still further disseminated, the Vedas were in a short time deserted by most of the Daitya race…&#8221; Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>And then reference to Buddhist monks is made,</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 3.18.14-26 &#8220;…<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Then the same deluder, putting on garments of a red colour</span>, assuming a benevolent aspect, and speaking in soft and agreeable tones, addressed others of the same family, and said to them, &#8220;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">If; mighty demons, you cherish a desire either for heaven or for final repose, desist from the iniquitous massacre of animals (for sacrifice)</span>, and hear from me what you should do. Know that all that exists is composed of discriminative knowledge. Understand my words, for they have been uttered by the wise. This world subsists without support, and engaged in the pursuit of error, which it mistakes for knowledge, as well as vitiated by passion and the rest, revolves in the straits of existence.&#8221; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">In this manner, exclaiming to them, &#8220;Know!&#8221; (Budhyadwam), and they replying, &#8220;It is known&#8221; (Budhyate), these Daityas were induced by the arch deceiver to deviate from their religious duties (and become Bauddhas)</span>, by his repeated arguments and variously urged persuasions, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">When they had abandoned their own faith, they persuaded others to do the same</span>, and the heresy spread, and many deserted the practices enjoined by the Vedas and the laws. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The delusions of the false teacher paused not with the conversion of the Daityas to the Jaina and Bauddha heresies, but with various erroneous tenets he prevailed upon others to apostatize</span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">until the whole were led astray, and deserted the doctrines and observances inculcated by the three Vedas</span>. Some then spake evil of the sacred books; some blasphemed the gods; some treated sacrifices and other devotional ceremonies with scorn; and others calumniated the Brahmans. &#8220;The precepts,&#8221; they cried, &#8220;that lead to the injury of animal life (as in sacrifices) are highly reprehensible. To say that casting butter into flame is productive of reward, is mere childishness. If Indra, after having obtained godhead by multiplied rites, is fed upon the wood used as fuel in holy fire, he is lower than a brute, which feeds at least upon leaves. If an animal slaughtered in religious worship is thereby raised to heaven, would it not be expedient for a man who institutes a sacrifice to kill his own father for a victim…&#8221; Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 3.18.30-36 &#8220;…By such and similar lessons the Daityas were perverted, so that not one of them admitted the authority of the Vedas. When the Daityas had thus declined from the path of the holy writings, the deities took courage, and gathered together for battle. Hostilities accordingly were renewed, but the demons were now defeated and slain by the gods, who had adhered to the righteous path. The armour of religion, which had formerly protected the Daityas, had been discarded by them, and upon its abandonment followed their destruction. Thus, Maitreya, you are to understand that those who have seceded from their original belief are said to be naked, because they have thrown off the garment of the Vedas…&#8221; Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 3.18.49-50 &#8220;…Let therefore a prudent person carefully avoid the conversation, or the contact, and the like, of those heretics who are rendered impure by their desertion of the three Vedas. The ancestral rite, although performed with zeal and faith, pleases neither gods nor progenitors if it be looked upon by apostates…&#8221; Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Killing those who left Shaivite Hinduism and embraced Buddhism</span></p>
<p>Shiva Purana, RudraSamhita 2, Yuddha Khanda section 5, chapter 6, verses 28 &#8220;O lord, favourably disposed towards your devotees, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">those Asuras have resorted to Buddha&#8217;s religion</span> and philosophy, thanks to our good fortune and hence they have eschewed all Vedic sacred rites.[36-37] Shiva said:- But the great Asuras are my firm devotees. They shall be killed only by me, for they have been forced to abandon their excellent virtue under false persuasion. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Let Visnu or any one else slay them now that they have been made to abandon their Dharma</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The Asuras of the three cities have become devoid of devotion to me</span>.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>So demons couldn&#8217;t be killed because they followed the Vedic path. If demons committed sins then why weren&#8217;t they killed? Why was there a need to convert them to Buddhism and Jainism? Does being a Hindu makes one immune to all sins? If demons got power from the Vedic religion then why didn&#8217;t Hindu gods from whom the religion emanates stop it? Vishnu in Vishnu Purana 3.17.42-44 clearly says that those being led astray from the path of the Vedas shall be put to death. This one sentence of Vishnu is enough to prove the point that they were killed only because of their apostatizing from Vedic religion. Vishnu Purana book 3 chapter 18 even says that those Daityas who embraced Buddhism and Jainism and also persuaded others to do the same were led astray, meaning they followed the false religion.</p>

<h2><a id="blasphemy"></a>Blasphemy</h2>
<p>Seems like Hindu gods didn&#8217;t like to hear criticism. There are references to the punishment of blasphemers in this world and hereafter for censuring gods, Vedas, Puranas, and even for censuring Brahmins. Krishna said,</p>
<p>Gita 16.18-20 &#8220;Bewildered by false ego, strength, pride, lust and anger, the demons become envious of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is situated in their own bodies and in the bodies of others, and <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">blaspheme against the real religion</span>. Those who are envious and mischievous, who are the lowest among men, I perpetually cast into the ocean of material existence, into various demoniac species of life. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Attaining repeated birth amongst the species of demoniac life</span>.&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Gita 9.11-12 &#8220;Fools deride Me when I descend in the human form. They do not know My transcendental nature as the Supreme Lord of all that be. Those who are thus bewildered are attracted by demonic and atheistic views. In that deluded condition, their hopes for liberation, their fruitive activities, and their culture of knowledge are all defeated.&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Kurma Purana I.16.168b-170a &#8220;Those who consider Visnu as the unmanifest Atman and who are endowed with faith, but who worship Isana with a different vision (i.e. regard him as different from Visnu) are not my beloved ones. Those deluded persons who hate the creator of the world are roasted and cooked in Raurava and other hells and are not released there from even after hundreds and crores of kalpas.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Krishna Janma Khanda 40.116-141 &#8220;&#8230;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">A sinner who slanders Brahma, the creator of the world, the goddess Durga who is the best of female deities, Laksmi, Saraswati, Sita, Tulsi, Ganga, the Vedas, the mother of the Vedas, a vow, devotion, mystic formula pertaining to worship of the spiritual guide who gives formula will dwell in the hell called the &#8216;Blind well&#8217; for half the period of the longevity allotted to Brahma, where bitten by snakes he will scream dreadfully</span>.

He dwells there with his feet upwards and face downwards surrounded by snakes. There, bitten by fearful snakes, he screams horribly and oppressed by hunger, he consumes saliva, ordure and urine. Then the fearful myrmidons of Yama in anger thrust torches into his mouth, chastise him in the morning, noon and evening, storm and thunder. He is then very much frightened and with the torments caused by beating he is rendered thirsty and drinks urine to quench his thrust.&#8221; Tr. Rajendra Nath Sen.</p>
<p>Padma Purana IV.17.14-18 &#8220;Formerly in Tretayuga there was a sinful brahmana by name Sudarsana. O best brahmana, on the day of (i.e. sacred to) Visnu he would always eat (food, i.e. would not observe a fast). He always censured the sacred texts and always condemned the vows&#8230;O brahmana, when once the time of death arrived, he died. The messengers of Yama came (to his place), and binding him they took him to Yama&#8217;s abode&#8230;[22-28] Suta said: O brahmana, then, by Yama&#8217;s order his terrible messengers threw him into faeces (where he remained) for more than a hundred ages of Manu. Freed from there he became (i.e. was born as) a village pig on the earth. For a long time he would remain in hell due to his having eaten food on the day of (i.e. sacred to) Visnu&#8230;&#8221; Tr.

<p>Skanda Purana IV.ii.75.&#8221;A deluded fool engaged in censuring Siva, a censurer of Saivite scriptures- there is no expiation for him. No such redemption is seen in any scripture by anyone. He who performs the act of censuring Siva should be known as a soul-killer, a murderer of the three worlds. He is baser than the basest. He should not be talked to. Those who are engaged in censuring Siva in the midst of the devotees of Siva, fall into the terrible hell as long as the Sun and the Moon (shine).&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>

Therefore I shall no longer bear this unworthy body, which has been received from you, who have blasphemed Lord Śiva. If someone has taken food which is poisonous, the best treatment is to vomit.&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Swami Prabhupada wrote &#8220;The answer to that argument is that Satī was not vilifying but defending. If possible she should have cut out Dakṣa&#8217;s tongue because he blasphemed Lord Śiva. In other words, since Lord Śiva is the protector of religion, a person who vilifies him should be killed at once, and after killing such a person, one should give up one&#8217;s life. That is the process, but because Dakṣa happened to be the father of Satī, she decided not to kill him but to give up her own life in order to compensate for the great sin she had committed by hearing blasphemy of Lord Śiva. The instruction set forth here in Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam is that one should not tolerate at any cost the activities of a person who vilifies or blasphemes an authority. If one is a brāhmaṇa he should not give up his body because by doing so he would be responsible for killing a brāhmaṇa…&#8221; <strong>Swami Prabhupada on Srimad Bhagavatam 4.4.17</strong> <a href="http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_4.4.17" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_4.4.17<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>Brahmins killed a King named Vena for blasphemeing Vishnu,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 4.14.30-35 &#8220;My dear Vidura, all good fortune unto you. The foolish King, who thought himself very learned, thus insulted the great sages, and the sages, being broken hearted by the King&#8217;s words, became very angry at him. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">All the great saintly sages immediately cried: Kill him! Kill him</span>! He is the most dreadful, sinful person. If he lives, he will certainly turn the whole world into ashes in no time. The saintly sages continued: This impious, impudent man does not deserve to sit on the throne at all. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">He is so shameless that he even dared insult the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Viṣṇu. But for King Vena, </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">who is simply inauspicious, who would blaspheme the Supreme Personality of Godhead</span>, by whose mercy one is awarded all kinds of fortune and opulence? The great sages, thus manifesting their covert anger, immediately decided to kill the King. King Vena was already as good as dead due to his blasphemy against the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus without using any weapons, the sages killed King Vena simply by high-sounding words. After all the sages returned to their respective hermitages, the mother of King Vena, Sunīthā, became very much aggrieved because of her son&#8217;s death. She decided to preserve the dead body of her son by the application of certain ingredients and by chanting mantras [mantra-yogena].&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>This is the same King Vena who embraced Jainism.</p>
<p>Some foolish minorities in India blame politicians for communal clashes, saying that they do it for elections. It&#8217;s somehow true, but Hindus don&#8217;t think like that. I haven&#8217;t seen any Hindu blaming politicians for communal clashes rather he will directly abuse the religion and blame the entire community. When dealing with the saffronized textbook, minorities say that Britishers deliberately distorted history as part of their Divide and Rule policy. But Hindus don&#8217;t say that. It were not politicians or Britishers who commanded Hindu rulers like Pushyamitra, Kinnara, Shashanka, Chola kings, etc to kill Jains and Buddhists, it were not politicians or the Britshers who ordered Hindu scholars like Adi Shankaracharya and Kumarila Bhatta to insult Jainism and Buddhism and persecute their followers, from the persecution of Buddhists and Jains, killing nearly a million Muslims in post-Independce riots, 1984 Anti-Sikh riots, pulling down the mosque, numerous riots where Muslims were targeted, anti-Christian Kandhamal riots, vandalization of Churches and Mosques, numerous hate speeches against minorities by Hindu leaders, there is something common. All these drew inspiration from the hate preached by their religion. I may sound like a Hindutvadi because I am speaking in their language that&#8217;s because I am responding to them in the language they understand the most.</p>
