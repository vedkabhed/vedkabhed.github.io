<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">Allegations against islam can be found here: http://agniveer.com/1184/muslim-wife-concubine/<br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: mediumblue;">I would like to quote a hadith of Prophet peace be upon him which alone can refute the claims of agniveer, and a sane man will never see agniveer`s false research again.</span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: mediumblue;">Mad’ee Karib al Khindi r.a said that the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم </span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: mediumblue;">قام في الناس فحمد الله وأثنى عليه ثم قال إن الله يوصيكم بالنساء خيرا إن الله يوصيكم بالنساء خيرا ، فإنهن أمهاتكم وبناتكم وخالاتكم</span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: mediumblue;">stood amongst the people and praised Allaah and exalted Him and saidIndeed Allah advices you in the strongest possible terms to be good to women, Indeed Allah advices you in the strongest possible terms to be good to woman, Indeed they are your mothers your daughters, your sisters, your paternal aunt and your maternal aunt.[Silsilah Ahadeeth as Saheehah no. 2871]</span><br>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><em><span style="color: red;">Agniveer stated</span><br>
<span style="color: red;">Zakir Naik and co is fooling the women by claiming equal rights for them as compared to men. However in reality, muslim women are suppressed severely under the barbaric laws of Quran and Hadith. To show, how false and stupid, the claims of equality for women (in marital life) in Islam are, we analyse Quran and authentic Hadith. Its clearly evident from the scriptures, that the founder of Islam was too busy to offer luxuries to his army-men comprised of males to have bothered to even think of women above status of animals. </span></em><br>

<strong>Some of his words from 11 minutes 40 seconds-onward are:</strong><br>
“I was very disrespectful to women … you know how people say Muslims oppress their women, before I became a muslim I used to oppress women and many of the rappers, we oppress the women to our song to our music and we are teaching the whole generation to grow up and have no respect for your mother anymore, have no respect for your sister anymore … when i read the religion of Islam and the life of prophet Muhammad (Peace be upon him) and he said those are best of all the Muslims who are best to their wives and once wife of the Prophet Ayesha(r.a) she asks the prophet Muhammad(s.a.w) who have more rights over the women, he said the husband… she say who have more right over the man, he say the mother … So, this is the first time I see the importance of women in society and it started to change me and the more that I read the more I was able to recognize a life that was living”.</p>

</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: blue;">I’ll provide a short reply. This is a wrong translation provided by him. The correct one is as follows:</span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: blue;">“Men are the protectors and maintainers of women, because Allah has made one of them to excel the other, and because they spend (to support them) from their means. Therefore the righteous women are devoutly obedient (to Allah and to their husbands), and guard in the husbands absence what Allah orders them to guard (e.g. their chastity, their husbands property, etc.). As to those women on whose part you see ill conduct, admonish them (first), (next), refuse to share their beds, (and last) beat them (lightly, if it is useful), but if they return to obedience, seek not against them means (of annoyance). Surely, Allah is Ever Most High, Most Great. [004:034, Muhammad Al-Hilali &amp; Muhsin Khan] </span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: blue;">It is mentioned in Sahih Muslim, narrated from Jaabir that the <strong>Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said in his Farewell Sermon:</strong><br>
“Fear Allah concerning women! Verily you have taken them on the security of Allah, and intercourse with them has been made lawful unto you by words of Allah. You too have rights over them, and that they should not allow anyone to sit on your bed whom you do not like. But if they do that, you can chastise them but not severely (another hadith says but without causing injury or leaving a mark.). Their rights upon you are that you should provide them with food and clothing in a fitting manner” (Narrated by Muslim, 1218, Tirmidhi, 1163, and Ibn Maajah, 1851)</span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: blue;">We ask the author, whether any non Muslim husband would permit his wife to allow any other person whom he does not like on their bed? See the beauty of Islam.Even then it says, admonish them (first), (next), refuse to share their beds (In refusing to share the bed, even the husband is deprived), (and last) beat them lightly, if it is useful. Their rights upon you are that you should provide them with food and clothing in a fitting manner” Subhan’Allah</span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: blue;">All this is for our good because Allah says “O you who believe! Ward off yourselves and your families against a Fire (Hell) whose fuel is men and stones” [al-Tahreem 66:6]</span></span></p>
<p>Regarding his comment</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="http://theindianmuslim.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/062315_1645_7.png" alt=""><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: red;"><em>b. What should a woman do if she finds her husband disloyal or ill conducive?</em></span><br>

</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: blue;">Reply<br>
Allah says: “If a wife fears cruelty or desertion on her husband’s part, there is no blame on them if they arrange an amicable settlement between themselves; and such settlement is best; even though men’s souls are swayed by greed. But if ye do good and practice self-restraint, God is well-acquainted with all that ye do. (The Noble Quran, 4:128)”</span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: blue;"><strong>i) It’s an <span style="text-decoration: underline;">order</span> to the Husband that he should love his wife</strong><br>
Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “No believing man should hate a believing woman. If he dislikes one of her characteristics, he may be pleased with another.” Narrated by Muslim (1469) from Abu Hurayrah. </span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: blue;"><strong>ii)</strong> According to a report narrated by Musnad Ahmad (2/524), it was said: ” من أعول يا رسول الله ؟ قال : امرأتك ممن تعول<br>
For whom am I responsible, O <strong>Messenger of Allaah?” He said, “Your wife is one of those for whom you are responsible.”</strong></span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: blue;"><strong>iii)</strong> Another hadith says Anas (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:<br>
“Allaah will ask everyone who has been given responsibility about whatever he was responsible for, until He asks a man about his family.” (Authenticated by Ibn Hibaan in Al Ihsan hadeeth no: 1562, Authenticated by Shaykh Al Albani in As Saheeha hadeeth no: 1636).</span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: blue;"><strong>iv)</strong> Lastly Shaykh Salih Al Munajjid said in Islamqa fatwa no: 2083 states:<br>
If it is the husband who is mistreating his wife, that does not mean that she should remain oppressed or that her hands are tied. She has the right – just as the husband has – to warn and advise him, and to remind him to fear Allaah. If that does not work, she can seek the help of wise people among his relatives and her own, and they can advise him. If this does not work, then the matter can be taken to a qaadi (Muslim judge) who can force him to do the right thing – and Allaah is above them all.(end)</span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: blue;">v) It is narrated that the women of the Sahaabah used to argue and debate with them, and indeed this is the way in which the Mothers of the Believers [i.e., the Prophet’s wives] used to act with our Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), as ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab said to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “We Quraysh used to control our women, but when we came to the Ansaar we found that they were a people who were controlled by their women. So our women started to adopt the ways of the Ansaari women. I got angry with my wife and she argued with me and I did not like her arguing with me. <strong>She said, ‘Why do you object to me arguing with you? By Allaah, the wives of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) argue with him…'”</strong> Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 4895; Muslim, 1479.</span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: blue;"><strong>Al-Haafiz ibn Hajar said – discussing the lessons to be learned from this hadeeth –</strong><br>
“This indicates that <strong>being harsh with women is something blameworthy, </strong>because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) adopted the way of the Ansaar with their women and forsook the way of his people.” Fath al-Baari, 9/291</span><br>

<span style="color: blue;"><strong>vi)</strong><br>
<strong>Woman beating in Hindu Scriptures</strong><br>
Brihadaranyak Upanishad says</span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: blue;">6. Now, if a man sees himself (his reflection) in water, he should recite the following mantra: “May the gods bestow on me vigour, manhood, fame, wealth and merit.” In praise of the wife who will bear him a son: She (his wife) has put on the soiled clothes of impurity; she is, verily, loveliness among women. Therefore when she has removed the clothes of impurity and appears beautiful, he should approach her and speak to her.</span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: blue;">7. If she does not willingly yield her body to him, he should buy her with presents. If she is still unyielding, he should strike her with a stick or with his hand and overcome her, repeating the following mantra: “With power and glory I take away your glory.” Thus she becomes discredited.</span><br>
</span></p>

Why does the Quran call women a tilth for man? by Waqar Akbar Cheema: http://letmeturnthetables.blogspot.com/2008/06/why-quran-calls-women-tilth-for-men.html</span></span></p>
<p><strong>Examples from Hindu Scriptures</strong><br>
Mr. Agniveer if you are calling this vulgarity, I am afraid you are condemning your own books. Even Manu Smriti refers women as tilths and men as seeds in Chapter 4, Sholkas 49-56. Also read what Yajurveda has to say as per Swami Dayanand Saraswati.</p>

<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><br>
<span style="color: blue;">Let us understand the above hadith with the help of another hadith</span></span></p>
<p>AbuHuraira reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) having said this: Two are the types of the denizens of Hell whom I did not see: people having flogs like the tails of the ox with them and they would be beating people, and the women who would be dressed but appear to be naked, who would be inclined (to evil) and make their husbands incline towards it. [Sahih Muslim Book #024, Hadith #5310]
</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><br>
<span style="color: blue;">Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr said: what the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) meant was women who wear clothes made of light fabric which describes and does not cover. They are clothed in name but naked in reality.</span> Transmitted by al-Suyooti in Tanweer al-Hawaalik, 3/103.<br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: blue;">Shaykh Abdul Aziz Bin Baz May Allah be please with him commented “kaasiyat ‘aariyaat (translated above as “dressed but appear to be naked” may have another meaning, which is that they are enjoying the blessings of Allaah, but they do not give thanks for them and they do not obey the commands of Allaah or heed His prohibitions, even though Allaah has bestowed upon them wealth and other blessings.</span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: blue;">The hadeeth is also explained in a different manner, which is that they wear clothes that do not cover them, because they are too thin or too short, so they do not serve the purpose of clothes, hence they are described as naked, and because the clothes they wear do not cover their ‘awrah.</span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: blue;">Maa’ilaat (literally “deviant”) means they turn away from chastity and righteousness, i.e., they commit sins and evil deeds like those who do immoral actions, or they fall short in doing the obligatory duties, prayer etc.</span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: blue;">Mumeelaat means they turn others away, i.e., they call people to evil and corruption, so by their words and actions they lead others into immorality and sin, and they commit immoral actions because of their lack of faith or the weakness of their faith. The point of this saheeh hadeeth is to warn against oppression and all kinds of corruption from men and women.</span> Majmoo’ Fataawa wa Maqaalaat Mutanawwi’ah li’l-Shaykh Ibn Baaz, 6/355<br>

This is the complete hadith:</span></span></p>
<p>Narrated ‘Aisha: We set out with the Prophet with the intention of performing Hajj only. The Prophet reached Mecca and performed Tawaf of the Ka’ba and between Safa and Marwa and did not finish the Ihram, because he had the Hadi with him. His companions and his wives performed Tawaf (of the Ka’ba and between Safa and Marwa), and those who had no Hadi with them finished their Ihram. I got the menses and performed all the ceremonies of Hajj. So, when the Night of Hasba (night of departure) came, I said, “O Allah’s Apostle! All your companions are returning with Hajj and ‘Umra except me.” He asked me, “Didn’t you perform Tawaf of the Ka’ba (Umra) when you reached Mecca?” I said, “No.” He said, “Go to Tan’im with your brother ‘Abdur-Rahman, and assume Ihram for ‘Umra and I will wait for you at such and such a place.” So I went with ‘Abdur-Rahman to Tan’im and assumed Ihram for ‘Umra. Then Safiya bint Huyay got menses. The Prophet said, ” ‘Aqra Halqa! You will detain us! Didn’t you perform Tawaf-al-Ifada on the Day of Nahr (slaughtering)?” She said, “Yes, I did.” He said, “Then there is no harm, depart.” So I met the Prophet when he was ascending the heights towards Mecca and I was descending, or vice-versa [Bukhari Kitab al Hajj no: 815]

<span style="color: blue;"><strong>In Summary</strong>, this is a type of statements that is said in form of duaa that Arabs uses but do not mean it to happen. It is similar when Arabs praise someone and says, “May Allah fight him, how brave he is!”.

Hudhayfah came to Salman and Salman said: ‘O Hudhayfah, the Messenger of Allah ﴿would sometimes be angry and would speak accordingly, and would sometimes be pleased and would speak accordingly. I know that the Messenger of Allah ﴾ addressed us and said: (Any man of my Ummah whom I have insulted or cursed when I was angry — for I am a man from among the sons of Adam, and I get angry just as you do.<strong> But Allah has sent me as a Mercy to the Worlds, <span style="color: red;">so I will make that my anger﴾ into blessings for him on the Day of Resurrection.”<span style="color: blue;">) </span></span></strong>This was also recorded by Abu Dawud from Ahmad bin Yunus from Za’idah.(end quote from Tafsir Ibn Katheer 21: 107)</span></span></p>
<p>Prophet peace be upon him said “<strong> “I have been sent as a blessing, not a curse.”</strong></p>

</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: blue;"><strong>Sukainah the daughter of Shaikh al-Albaani said,</strong> “I asked my father, may Allaah have mercy on him, ‘How does the female who has the excuse accorded to her by the Sharee’ah [i.e., menses] perform worship on the Night of Decree?’ </span><br>
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: blue;">So he answered me, saying, ‘By supplicating, remembering Allaah [dhikr] and reciting the Quraan, and there is no problem in her doing that. And I think that you are sure about the fact that it is not disliked for the menstruating woman to recite the Quraan. So this is the way out from one angle.</span><br>
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: blue;">And from another, it is fitting for the Muslim in such circumstances, whether he is male or female, to emulate the Prophet عليه السلام who said, ‘Seize the benefit of five before five: your youth before you become old, and your health before you become ill …’ [Saheeh at-Targheeb wat-Tarheeb, no. 3355]. For what reason [did he say this?] Because in Sahih al-Bukhari it has been reported that, <strong>‘When a slave [a believer] falls ill or travels, then he will get written to his accounts [the reward] similar to that which he used to get for his good deeds practised at home and in good health [as if he is doing them on his journey and in illness].’</strong> [Bukhaari 2996]</span><br>
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: blue;">So it is upon such a woman to seize the opportunity of benefitting from her time when she is clean and is able to stand during the last ten nights, or at least the odd nights, or at the very least the day or night of the twenty-seventh.</span><br>
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: blue;">For indeed when Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, knows that His female servant used to do that when she was able to stand in prayer then suddenly comes into a state where she is excused, <strong>He records for her what used to be written for her when she was in a state of purity.</strong></span><br>
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: blue;">This is a very important point. Its fruits are that the Muslim should strive as was just explained: that he should always spend his time in obedience as much as he is able to. <strong>Such that when his obedience increases and the worship then passes him by [due to him becoming ill or travelling, the reward] is still written for him even if he is not able to actually perform it.'”</strong></span><br>
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: blue;"><strong>Source: </strong>http://shaikhalbaani.wordpress.com/2011/07/09/how-does-a-menstruating-woman-worship-during-the-night-of-decree/</span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: blue;">She will be rewarded for not praying during their periods. Allah says “Whoever works righteousness, whether male or female, while he (or she) is a true believer (of Islamic Monotheism) verily, to him We will give a good life (in this world with respect, contentment and lawful provision), and We shall pay them certainly a reward in proportion to the best of what they used to do (i.e. Paradise in the Hereafter).” [016:097]</span></span></p>
<p>And following command (that do not pray in periods) of Allah and his Prophet peace be upon him is righteousness and in result of Righteousness she will surely be rewarded.</p>

هَذَا الْحُكْم ـ أي عدم قضاء الصلاة ـ مُتَّفَق عَلَيْهِ أَجْمَع الْمُسْلِمُونَ عَلَى أَنَّ الْحَائِض وَالنُّفَسَاء لا تَجِب عَلَيْهِمَا الصَّلاة وَلا الصَّوْم فِي الْحَال , وَأَجْمَعُوا عَلَى أَنَّهُ لا يَجِب عَلَيْهِمَا قَضَاء الصَّلَاة , وَأَجْمَعُوا عَلَى أَنَّهُ يَجِب عَلَيْهِمَا قَضَاء الصَّوْم ، قَالَ الْعُلَمَاء : وَالْفَرْق بَيْنهمَا أَنَّ الصَّلاة كَثِيرَة مُتَكَرِّرَة فَيَشُقّ قَضَاؤُهَا بِخِلافِ الصَّوْم .<br>
“This ruling – i.e., that prayers should not be made up) is agreed upon by all the Muslims, that menstruating women and women who bleed following childbirth do not have to pray or fast at the times when prayers or fasts are due; they are unanimously agreed that they do not have to make up the prayers, and they are unanimously agreed that they do have to make up the fasts. The scholars said, the difference between them is that the prayers are many and are repeated, so it would be difficult to make them up, unlike the fasts.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: blue;"><strong>Shaykh Salman al Odha said:</strong><br>
These are matters of Islamic Law. A woman is neither sinful nor blameworthy because of the prayers and fasts that she misses. She, in fact, receives blessings by obeying Allah and abstaining from those acts while she is menstruating. Her testimony as a witness is half that of men only in matters wherein she is generally less versed than men. In other matters wherein women have particular knowledge, like fosterage and virginity, the testimony of a woman is accepted but not that of a man.</span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: blue;">Allah’s Messenger (peace be upon him) attested to the perfect character of four women: Mary, Âsiyah the wife of Pharaoh, Fâtimah, and Khadîjah. He definitely did not mean that these women did not go through menstruation. He was referring to their good character, strength of intellect, and soundness of opinion (end)</span><br>

Sharah Sahih Muslim an-Nawawi says: “This is to be understood as referring to voluntary and recommended fasts for which there is no specific time. It is understood as meaning that this is prohibited, as our companions stated. The reason for that is that the husband has the right to intimacy with his wife on all days, and his right is to be implemented immediately, and cannot be deferred because of voluntary acts of worship or because of an obligatory deed that may be done at any time.” Sharh Muslim, 7/115. </span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: blue;"><strong>Islam QA Fatwa no: 66621 says</strong></span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: blue;">The husband has to fear Allaah with regard to his wife, and not burden her with more than she can bear. Many men keep their womenfolk busy all day with cooking, and at night with making sweets, so the woman’s days and nights are wasted and she cannot make the most of her fasting days or her nights by doing acts of worship. One of the wife’s rights over her husband is that she should have a share of the worship of this month. So he should not prevent her from reading Qur’aan, or praying qiyaam. There should be understanding between them so that there will not be any conflict between his rights and her worship of her Lord. This, of course, has to do with naafil acts of worship; with regard to obligatory acts of worship, the husband has no right to stop his wife doing them.</span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: blue;">The way of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) with his wives was to encourage them to worship and obey Allaah, especially in the last ten days of Ramadaan.</span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: blue;">It was narrated that ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) said: “When the (last) ten nights began, the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) would tighten his waist-wrapper (i.e., strive hard in worship or refrain from intimacy with his wives), stay awake at night and wake his family.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (1920) and Muslim (1174).</span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: blue;">If both, husband and wife, understand their rights and duties, they will avoid difficulties and arguments in most cases. If they understand that such occasions will only recur a few times during their lives, this should make them keener to make the most of the days and nights of Ramadaan.(end quote)</span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: blue;"><strong>Comment: </strong>In short, this is only for voluntary (Nafal) fasts and only when the husband is staying with the wife. Obeying the husband is obligatory as far as husband is not saying something which goes against Islamic law. Women will get more rewards in obeying the husband. Secondly most husbands do not prevent their wives from fasting the nawafil fasts. When a woman gets her husband’s permission for voluntary fasting she attains a lot of blessings. When a woman obeys her husband she shows the true spirit of Islamic marriage.</span><br>

<p><span style="color: #454545; font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;"><strong>Also men are not allowed to do non-obligatory Ibadah  if the rights of wives are not fulfilled, same is the case with women if the rights of husband are not fulfilled it is not allowed for her to do non obligatory ibadah. </strong><br>

<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: purple;"><strong>Comment:</strong> Agniveer should read the Veda before attacking Islam. One can compare the Islamic teachings and the teachings of Hinduism. According to Islam, both husband and wife have similar rights but a Husband has to be more responsible because he has to feed her, clother her, provide for her, etc, on the other hand Hinduism says her heart is like the heart of a HYENA? And hence we can not befriend them</span>?</span></p>

The Prophet said: If one of you marries a woman or buys a slave, he should say: “O Allah, I ask Thee for the good in her, and in the disposition Thou hast given her; I take refuge in Thee from the evil in her, and in the disposition Thou hast given her.” When he buys a camel, he should take hold of the top of its hump and say the same kind of thing.

<span style="color: red;"><em>Comments-</em></span><br>
<span style="color: red;"><em>So, according to Islam, marrying a woman is equivalent to buy a slave! Really, Mullahs rightly say that muslims should treat their slaves the way they treat their wives. Muhammad discovered the best way to do so by degrading wife to the level of slave!</em></span><br>

</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: blue;">Jabir reported that ‘Abdullah b. Ubayy b. Salul used to say to his slavegirl: Go and fetch something for us by committing prostitution. </span><br>
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: blue;">It was in this connection that Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, revealed this verse:</span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: blue;">“And compel not your slave-girls to prostitution when they desire to keep chaste in order to seek the frail goods of this world’s life, and whoever compels them, then surely after their compulsion Allah is Forgiving, Merciful” (xxiv. 33).</span><br>
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: blue;">[Sahih Muslim Book 43, Number 7180 Chapter 4: COMPEL NOT YOUR SLAVE-GIRLS TO PROSTITUTION]</span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><br>
<span style="color: blue;">Ibn e Kathir says<br>
Among the people of the Jahiliyyah, there were some who, if he had a slave-girl, he would send her out to commit Zina and would charge money for that, which he would take from her every time. When Islam came, Allah forbade the believers to do that. The reason why this Ayah was revealed, according to the reports of a number of earlier and later scholars of Tafsir, had to do with `Abdullah bin Ubayy bin Salul. He had slave-girls whom he used to force into prostitution so that he could take their earnings and because he wanted them to have children which would enhance his status, or so he claimed.</span>(Commentary of Ibne Kathir 24:24)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: purple;"><strong>Comment: </strong>The word ‘force’ is used because the slaves were forced to make money, However the ayah does not say that if they do not desire chastity then you are free to force them into prostitution.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: purple;">Prostitution is prohibited. The Prophet peace be upon him said</span>:<br>

<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: blue;">‘Abd-Allaah ibn Maghfal reported that there was a woman who had been a prostitute during the days of ignorance (before Islam). A man passed by her, or she passed by him, and he touched her. She said: “Stop it!. Allaah has done away with shirk and had brought Islam.” So he left her alone and went away. </span>(Reported by al-Haakim, who said this hadeeth is saheeh according to the conditions of Muslim, although they did not report it).</span></p>

<span style="color: red;">a. Great, so by swearing four times, man can make woman undergo punishments starting from lashes to stoning to death.</span><br>
<span style="color: red;">b. But what will happen if wife too swears 8 times (since testimony of one man is equal to testimonies of 2 women) that she has not committed sin? In this balanced situation, who will be accused of telling lie?</span></em><br>

Let us go throught the context of The Noble Qur’an – An-Nur 24:4-9<br>
[024:004] And those who launch a charge against chaste women, and produce not four witnesses (to support their allegations),- flog them with eighty stripes; and reject their evidence ever after: for such men are wicked transgressors;-<br>
[024:005] Unless they repent thereafter and mend (their conduct); for God is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.<br>
[024:006] And for those who launch a charge against their spouses, and have (in support) no evidence but their own,- their solitary evidence (can be received) if they bear witness four times (with an oath) by God that they are solemnly telling the truth;<br>
[024:007] And the fifth (oath) (should be) that they solemnly invoke the curse of God on themselves if they tell a lie.<br>
[024:008] But it would avert the punishment from the wife, if she bears witness four times (with an oath) By God, that (her husband) is telling a lie;<br>
[024:009] And the fifth (oath) should be that she solemnly invokes the wrath of God on herself if (her accuser) is telling the truth.<br>
Allah also says<br>
[024:023] Those who slander chaste women, indiscreet but believing, are cursed in this life and in the Hereafter: for them is a grievous Penalty,-<br>
[024:024] On the Day when their tongues, their hands, and their feet will bear witness against them as to their actions.</span></span></p>
<p>The Prophet said: “Avoid the seven great destructive sins.” They (the people) asked, “O Allah’s Messenger! What are they?” He said,<br>
<span style="color: blue;">“To join partners in worship with Allah,<br>
to practise sorcery;<br>
to kill the life which Allah has forbidden except for a just cause (according to Islamic law);<br>
to eat up Riba’ (usury);<br>
to eat up the property of an orphan;<br>
to show one’s back to the enemy and fleeing from the battle-field at the time of fighting and<br>
to accuse chaste women who never even think of anything touching their chastity and are good believers.” </span>(Hadith Bukhari 8:840, Narrated Abu Huraira:)</p>
<p><span style="color: blue;">Brother Bassam Zawadi rightly said<br>
According to the judgment of the Glorious Quran, if a man accuses his wife of committing adultery, the wife can nullify the accusation as her testimony is accepted, consequently, the wife will not be punished. However, if the accuser is not her husband, then he has to bring four witnesses. If not, he will receive eighty lashes and his testimony will be rejected forever. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: blue;">Look at how the Quran uplifts the woman!</span><br>

No where does the hadith say “their decisions will not be comparable to a man’s” </span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: blue;">If women are deficient then why did the sahaba ask help from the mother of the believers??? Not only this, but there are evidences where women correct the Sahaba including Umar bin Al Khattab (RA). Umar (RA) was amongst the most knowledgeable sahaba and he was khalifatul Muslimeen (Caliph of the muslims)</span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><br>
<span style="color: blue;">In fact  the Prophet peace be upon him would take advice from his wives</span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><br>
<span style="color: blue;"><strong>a) Umm Salma, the wife of the Prophet (peace be upon him) advised the Prophet (Peace be upon him)</strong><br>
It is mentioned in Sealed Nectar: When the peace treaty had been concluded, the Prophet (Peace be upon him) ordered his Companions to slaughter their sacrificial animals, but they were too depressed to do that. The Prophet (Peace be upon him) gave instructions in this regard three times but with negative response. He told his wife Umm Salamah about this attitude of his Companions. She advised that he himself take the initiative, slaughter his animal and have his head shaved. Seeing that, the Muslims, with rended hearts, started to slaughter their animals and shave their heads. They even almost killed one another because of their distress. The Prophet (Peace be upon him) prayed three times for those who shaved their heads and once for those who cut their hair… </span>(Sealed Nectar by Shaykh Safi ur Rahman Egnlish translation page 155)<br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>Comment: </strong>How beautiful was the advice of Umm Salmah (RA)! The Prophet peace be upon him never said, “Oh, you are a woman and you’re deficient. Rather, he follower her advice!”</span><br>
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: blue;"><strong>b) The Prophet (peace be upon him) himself, sought his wife, Zainab (RA)’s advice.</strong></span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: blue;">It is mentioned in Bukhari Aisha further said: Allah’s Apostle also asked Zainab bint Jahsh about my case. He said, “O Zainab! What have you seen?” She replied, “O Allah’s Apostle! I protect my hearing and my sight (by refraining from telling lies). I know nothing but good (about Aisha).” Of all the wives of Allah’s Apostle, it was Zainab who aspired to receive from him the same favor as I used to receive, yet, Allah saved her (from telling lies) because of her piety. </span>[Bukhari Book <a title="#60" href="http://www.searchtruth.com/book_display.php?book=60&amp;translator=1&amp;start=0&amp;number=274" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right"><span style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline;">#60</span><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, Hadith <a title="#274" href="http://www.searchtruth.com/book_display.php?book=60&amp;translator=1&amp;start=0&amp;number=274" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right"><span style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline;">#274</span><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>] (end quote)<br>

But they forget that in Quran [24:6], Allah has said that even if man has no witness, if he swears 4 times, it will be sufficient proof of him to be truthful.

But if they do that, you can chastise them but not severely(another hadith says but without causing injury or leaving a mark.). Their rights upon you are that you should provide them with food and clothing in a fitting manner” (Narrated by Muslim, 1218)</p>
<p><span style="color: blue;">We ask the author, whether any non Muslim husband would permit his wife to allow any other person whom he does not like on their bed? Look at the beauty of Islam.Even then it says, admonish them (first), (next), refuse to share their beds (In refusing to share the bed, even the husband is deprived), (and last) beat them lightly, if it is useful. Their rights upon you are that you should provide them with food and clothing in a fitting manner” and even then the Islamic Scholars says that It is better not to hit. Mentioned in Sharah Muslim 15/84</span></p>

<span style="color: blue;">Here is the complete hadith </span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: blue;">Muhammad b. Qais said (to the people): Should I not narrate to you (a hadith of the Holy Prophet) on my authority and on the authority of my mother? We thought that he meant the mother who had given him birth. He (Muhammad b. Qais) then reported that it was ‘A’isha who had narrated this: Should I not narrate to you about myself and about the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him)? We said: Yes. She said: When it was my turn for Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) to spend the night with me, he turned his side, put on his mantle and took off his shoes and placed them near his feet, and spread the corner of his shawl on his bed and then lay down till he thought that I had gone to sleep. He took hold of his mantle slowly and put on the shoes slowly, and opened the door and went out and then closed it lightly. I covered my head, put on my veil and tightened my waist wrapper, and then went out following his steps till he reached Baqi’. He stood there and he stood for a long time. He then lifted his hands three times, and then returned and I also returned He hastened his steps and I also hastened my steps. He ran and I too ran. He came (to the house) and I also came (to the house). I, however, preceded him and I entered (the house), and as I lay down in the bed, he (the Holy Prophet) entered the (house), and said: Why is it, O ‘A’isha, that you are out of breath? I said: There is nothing. He said: Tell me or the Subtle and the Aware would inform me. I said: Messenger of Allah, may my father and mother be ransom for you, and then I told him (the whole story). He said: Was it the darkness (of your shadow) that I saw in front of me? I said: Yes. He struck me on the chest which caused me pain, and then said: Did you think that Allah and His Apostle would deal unjustly with you? She said: Whatsoever the people conceal, Allah will know it. He said: Gabriel came to me when you saw me. He called me and he concealed it from you. I responded to his call, but I too concealed it from you (for he did not come to you), as you were not fully dressed. I thought that you had gone to sleep, and I did not like to awaken you, fearing that you may be frightened. He (Gabriel) said: Your Lord has commanded you to go to the inhabitants of Baqi’ (to those lying in the graves) and beg pardon for them. I said: Messenger of Allah, how should I pray for them (How should I beg forgiveness for them)? He said: Say, Peace be upon the inhabitants of this city (graveyard) from among the Believers and the Muslims, and may Allah have mercy on those who have gone ahead of us, and those who come later on, and we shall, God willing, join you</span>.(end) [MUSLIM Book 004, Number 2127]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue;">My Friend and Brother Dr Asif replied; “AS A DOCTOR I ANALYSED THIS HADITH. THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE HOME OF AISHA R.A. &amp; JANNATUL BAQI IS QUITE LONG.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: blue;">NOW SEE THE BOLD PART OF HADITH IN BLUE,</span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><br>
<span style="color: blue;">AS AISHA R.A WAS AFRAID THAT PROPHET (peace be upon him) WILL COME TO KNOW SHE WAS FALLOWING HER, SO IN ORDER TO AVOID THIS SHE CAME RUNNING BACK TO HOME, IT IS A NATURAL PHYSIOLOGICAL PHENOMENON THAT WHEN A PERSON RUNS FOR A DISTANCE MORE THAN 100 meters, THE BODY RESPONDS WITH HYPERVENTILATION.</span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><br>
<span style="color: blue;">THE PERSON’S BREATHING IS FASTER, THE HEART RATE INCREASES &amp; BLOOD PRESSURE INCREASES. IN SUCH A CONDITION IF YOU GIVE A SLIGHT PUSH ON THE CHEST, THE PERSON WILL FEEL PAIN. YOU MAY EXPERIMENT IT YOURSELF TO FIND OUT EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENS.</span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: blue;">IN THE ABOVE HADITH PROPHET SAAS JUST GAVE A PUSH TO AISHA R.A &amp; SHE FELT PAIN …..”</span></span></p>
<p>Moreover Aaishah (Radhiallahu ‘Anha) herself said: Allaah’s Messenger (Sallallahu ‘Alaihi Wa Sallam) never hit anything with his hand ever, except when fighting in the path of Allaah. Nor did he ever hit a servant or a woman.” [Recorded by Musnad Ishaq bin Rahwiy no: 698, Ibn Maajah Kitab al Nikah hadeeth no: 1984 Al-Albaanee said it is Saheeh.]

Imam Nawawi in his Sharh states that: The word “lahada” according to the lexicographers means, “to push” (dafa’a).(End quote for details see his full article)<br>

<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: blue;"><strong>This makes it clear that the Prophet (peace be upon him) neither beat his wives nor any other woman.</strong></span><br>

<p><span style="color: blue;"><strong>Authentic hadith which clears the anti-islamic claim:</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><br>
<span style="color: blue;">Muawiyah al Qarshi said I went to the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) and asked him: What do you say (command) about our wives? He replied: Give them food what you have for yourself, and clothe them by which you clothe yourself, and do not beat them, and do not revile them.</span> (Abu Dawud Book 11, Number 2139)<br>

<span style="color: red;">Comments- One can draw several conclusions from this hadith</span><br>
<span style="color: red;">a. Keeping slaves for sexual desires is justified in Islam.</span><br>
<span style="color: red;">b. Beating slaves is permissible as per Muhammad.</span><br>
<span style="color: red;">c. Wife should not be beaten as severely as a slave can be. (Thanks for Allah and Muhammad Ji for this mercy!)</span></em><br>

</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><br>
<span style="color: blue;">Dr. Hatem al-Haj states in his article ‘Concubines &amp; Slavery The Islamic Position’</span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><br>
<span style="color: blue;">And for one who humiliates his slave by beating him or slapping him, the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said,<br>
“من لَطَمَ مَمْلُوآَهُ أو ضَرَبَهُ فَكَفَّارَتُهُ أَنْ يُعْتِقَهُ”<br>
“He who slaps his slave or beats him, there is no expiation for this but to free him.</span>” (reported by Muslim).<br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><br>
<span style="color: blue;">Because of the aforementioned examples of the divine and prophetic instructions regarding slavery, no other nation or religious group in the world treated slaves better than the Muslims did, and here are the testimonies of the non-Muslim historians and leaders regarding this very fact:</span> (quotations from <a title="http://www.alislam" href="http://www.alislam/" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline;">http://www.alislam</span><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. org/slavery/)<br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>i)</strong> On the attitude of Muslim master with his slaves, <strong>Will Durant says</strong>, “…he handled them with a genial humanity that made their lot no worse – perhaps better, as more secure – than that of a factory worker in nineteenth-century Europe.” <a title="http://www.alislam.org/slavery/3.htm#r21" href="http://www.alislam.org/slavery/3.htm" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline;">http://www.alislam.org/slavery/3.htm#r21</span><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, Hurgronje C., Mohammedanism,(N.Y., 1916), p.128 as quoted by W. Durant, The Story of Civilization, vol.IV (N.Y., 1950), p. 209.<br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">ii) At the end of the 18th century, <strong>Mouradgea d’Ohsson</strong> (a main source of information for the Western writers on the Ottoman empire) declared: “There is perhaps no nation where the captives, the slaves, the very toilers in the galleys are better provided for or treated with more kindness than among the Muhammedans. ” <a title="http://www.alislam" href="http://www.alislam/" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline;">http://www.alislam</span><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. org/slavery/3.htm#r22, As quoted in The Encyclopaedia of Islam, vol.I, p. 35.<br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>iii) P. L Riviere writes: </strong>“A master was enjoined to make his slave share the bounties he received from God. It must be recognised that, in this respect, the Islamic teaching acknowledged such a respect for human personality and showed a sense of equality which is searched for in vain in ancient civilization” http://www.al-islam.org/slavery/3.htm#r23, Riviere P.L., Revue Bleaue (June 1939).<br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>iv) Napoleon Bonaparte</strong> is recorded as saying about the condition of slaves in Muslim countries: “The slave inherits his master’s property and marries his daughter. The majority of the Pashas had been slaves. Many of the grand viziers, all the Mamelukes, Ali Ben Mourad Beg, had been slaves. They began their lives by performing the most menial services in the houses of their masters and were subsequently raised in status for their merit or by favour. In the West, on the contrary, the slave has always been below the position of the domestic servants; he occupies the lowest rug. The Romans emancipated their slaves, but the emancipated were never considered as equal to the free-born. The ideas of the East and West are so different that it took a long time to make the Egyptians understand that all the army was not composed of slaves belonging to the Sultan al-Kabir. ” http://www.al-islam.org/slavery/3.htm#r25, Bonaparte et l’Islam (Paris, 1914)….<br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Dr. Hatem al-Haj further goes on</strong><br>
• The families are not disrupted in the Islamic wars.<br>
• The captives are usually returned as a show of kindness, exchanged for Muslim captives or money.<br>
• In the case they were taken as slave women, they were taken by one man.<br>
They were considered legitimate partners with rights guaranteed for them and their offspring who were treated exactly like the man’s other children.<br>
How is that like the gang raping in the battlefield by scores of soldiers?<br>
• Such women were often freed and married their masters and if not, and had a child, they had a special status and became unsellable and became free upon the death of the master.<br>
• Such women prospered.<br>
They bore and raised children who became khaleefas, sultans, princes, great leaders and scholars in the history of Islam.<br>
That is an indication on how they were treated.<br>

<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: blue;">a) Narrated Anas bin Malik: Allah’s Apostle said, “You should listen to and obey, your ruler even if he was an Ethiopian (black) slave whose head looks like a raisin.” </span>(Bukhari Book <a title="#89" href="http://www.searchtruth.com/book_display.php?book=89&amp;translator=1&amp;start=0&amp;number=256" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right"><span style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline;">#89</span><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, Hadith <a title="#256" href="http://www.searchtruth.com/book_display.php?book=89&amp;translator=1&amp;start=0&amp;number=256" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right"><span style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline;">#256</span><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>)<br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: blue;">b) Abu Dharr reported: My friend (the Holy Prophet) bade me to hear and obey (the ruler) even if he is a slave having his feet and arms cut off, and observe prayer at its prescribed time. (And further said): It you find people having observed the prayer, you in fact saved your prayer, otherwise (if you join with them) that would be a Nafl prayer for you.</span> (Muslim, Book <a title="#004" href="http://www.searchtruth.com/book_display.php?book=004&amp;translator=2&amp;start=0&amp;number=1355" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right"><span style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline;">#004</span><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, Hadith <a title="#1355" href="http://www.searchtruth.com/book_display.php?book=004&amp;translator=2&amp;start=0&amp;number=1355" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right"><span style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline;">#1355</span><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>)<br>

<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: blue;">c) Narrated Jabir bin ‘Abdullah: Umar used to say, “Abu Bakr is our chief, and he manumitted our chief,” meaning Bilal (he was a black slave and Abu baker manumitted him)</span>.

<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>Comment:</strong> When beating a SLAVE is not allowed, then how can it be allowed for a wife? The Prophet (peace be upon him) was educating Muslims and prohibiting the act of beating, because it was common for people to beat their slaves. However, Islam stopped this practice. </span><br>

<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: blue;">Reply<br>
This hadith is regarding raising children.</span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: blue;">Imam Al-Minaawi said: “For a father to discipline his child when he reaches the age of discernment means that he should raise him with the characteristics of the righteous believers and protect him from mixing with evildoers; he should teach him the Qur’aan and good manners and the language of the Arabs, let him hear the Sunnah and the sayings of the Salaf and teach him the religious rulings that he cannot do without. He should warn him then smack him if he does not pray etc. That will be better for him than giving a saa’ in charity, because if he teaches him properly, his actions will be among his ongoing charity, whereas the reward for a saa’ of charity is limited, but that will last as long as the child lives. Discipline is the nourishment of the soul, and training it for the Hereafter.</span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: blue;">“O you who believe! Ward off yourselves and your families against a Fire (Hell)…</span>” [al-Tahreem 66:6]
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: blue;">Protecting yourself and your family from it means reminding them of Hell. Discipline includes preaching, warning, threatening, smacking, detaining, giving and being kind. Disciplining one who is good and noble is different from disciplining one who is difficult and ignoble</span>.[Fayd al-Qadeer, 5/257]
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: blue;">Commentary of Ibne Kathir says under 66:6<br>
There is a Hadith that confirms the meaning of this Ayah. Ahmad, Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi recorded that Ar-Rabi` bin Sabrah said that his father said that the Messenger of Allah said,</span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: blue;">«مُرُوا الصَّبِيَّ بِالصَّلَاةِ إِذَا بَلَغَ سَبْعَ سِنِينَ، فَإِذَا بَلَغَ عَشْرَ سِنِينَ فَاضْرِبُوهُ عَلَيْهَا»</span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: blue;">(Order the children to pray when they reach the age of seven and when they reach the age of ten, discipline them for (not performing) it.) </span>This is the narration that Abu Dawud collected; At-Tirmidhi said, “This Hadith is Hasan.”<br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">Islamqa Fatwa no: 10016<br>
<span style="color: blue;">So raising children should be a balance between encouragement and warning. The most important element of all is making the environment in which the children live a good one, by providing the means whereby they may be guided; this means that their educators should be religiously committed, including their parents. </span><br>

</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: blue;">Reply<br>
The phrase “and he spends the night angry with her” refers to the cause of the angels’ curse, because this confirms that she is a sinner, which is a different matter than if he accepts her excuse and is not angry with her, or lets the matter drop. Is she to blame if he keeps her away from his bed? The answer is: no, unless she is the one who started the separation and he is keeping away from her because of it, and she did not apologize but prolonged the separation. <strong>But if he is the one who started it, and is thus treating her unfairly, then she is not to blame.</strong> In one report, instead of the words “the angels curse her until morning,” the wording is “… until she returns” – and this is a useful variant.</span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">(Adapted and abbreviated from the commentary by al-Haafiz Ibn Hijr – may Allaah have mercy on him – on this hadeeth in Fath al-Baari).<br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>Comment:</strong> Islam makes a woman the ‘Queen of the House’ and gives her the responsibility of house affairs while man is made the manager of out-of-house matters. It’s the man who is made responsible for financial matters and thus it is he who is to stay out of the home and earn for his family. So while out, he is more likely to come around any woman and this may cause some emotional upheaval within him.</span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: blue;">Holy Prophet (PBUH) said: “When one of you sees a woman, he should come to his wife, for that will repel what he feels in his heart.”</span> (Sahih Muslim, Book of Marriage, Hadith 3240)<br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><br>
<span style="color: blue;">This is a very natural and rational solution to such a situation. If a man faces such a situation and his wife is denying him , it can cause serious problems especially when it becomes frequent. It is a known fact that men have less power to control their desire. It is for this reason that the Holy Prophet (PBUH) gave such a commandment.</span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: blue;">Islam leaves no option for men and women to fulfill their desires except their spouses. The Quran says about the husband wife relation:<br>
“They are your garments and ye are their garments.”</span>{Surah Al-Baqarah 2:187}<br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: blue;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) said “None of you should fall upon his wife like an animal”</span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: blue;">Allah says: O ye who believe! Ye are forbidden to inherit women against their will. Nor should ye treat them with harshness, that ye may take away part of the dower [money given by the husband to the wife for the marriage contract] ye have given them, except where they have been guilty of open lewdness;on the contrary live with them on a footing of kindness and equity. If ye take a dislike to them it may be that ye dislike a thing, and God brings about through it a great deal of good</span> (Qu’ran An-nisa 19)<br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: blue;">It was narrated from ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “When the wife of any one of you asks for permission to go to the mosque, do not forbid her.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari</span> (4940) and Muslim (442).<br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: blue;"><strong>Shaykh Salih al Munajjid said while commenting the hadith provided by agniveer</strong><br>
At the same time, the husband must show consideration towards his wife if she is sick, pregnant or depressed, so as to maintain harmony and prevent discontent or hatred</span>.[Muharamat, Prohibitions that are taken too lightly, Chapter <a title="Not allowing one&rsquo;s husband to have marital relations for no legitimate reason" href="http://www.islam-qa.com/en/ref/books/10" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline;">Not allowing one’s husband to have marital relations for no legitimate reason</span><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, English Translation Book by Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid]
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: blue;"><strong>Al-Bahooti (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:</strong>The husband has the right to enjoy his wife at any time, so long as that does not keep her from performing obligatory duties or harm her; he does not have the right to enjoy her in that case, because that is not part of living with them honourably. But if it does not distract her from that or cause her harm, then he has the right to enjoyment. End quote from Kashshaaf al-Qinaa’ (5/189).</span><br>

<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: blue;">By the One in Whose hand is the soul of Muhammad, no woman will fulfill her duty towards her Lord unless she fulfils her duty towards her husband, and if he asks her for herself when she is sitting on a saddle, she should not refuse him</span> [Hadeeth reported by Ibn Maajah, 1843; see also Saheeh al-Jaami’, 5239, 5295]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline;">Below is an extract from the fatwa by Shaykh Salih al Munajjid in IslamQa fatwa no: 4601</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: blue;">Both husband and wife should submit themselves to the laws of Allaah, because this is where happiness lies. </span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: blue;">Allaah says “… And they (women) have rights (over their husbands as regards living expenses, etc.) similar (to those of their husbands) over them (as regards obedience and respect, etc.) to what is reasonable…”</span> [al-Baqarah 2:228]
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: #993366;">So both spouses must treat the other kindly. Marriage is based on love, not on defiance or provocation, because these usually occur between enemies, and if they happen between people who love one another, they usually cause hatred and do the couple no good.</span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: blue;">Allaah says “And among His Signs is this, that He created for you wives from among yourselves, that you may find repose in them, and He has put between you affection and mercy…” [al-Room 30:21]</span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><br>
<span style="color: blue;">‘Abd al-Rahmaan ibn ‘Awf said: “The Messenger of Allaah SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘If a woman prays her five (daily prayers), fasts her month (Ramadaan), guards her modesty and obeys her husband, it will be said to her, “Enter Paradise through whichever gate of Paradise you wish.”</span> (Reported by Imaam Ahmad, 1573; Saheeh al-Jaami’, 660).<br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: #993366;">If the wife obeys her husband and treats him well for the sake of Allaah, she will earn a great reward with Allaah. By the same token, the man has to be patient with her, treat her well, win her over and teach her what his shar’i rights over her are.</span>(end quote)<br>

<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: #993366;">We don’t consider every woman a mother or a sister because in reality they are not our mother or sisters. Yes, in religious terms, all Muslims are our brothers and Sisters, But that does not make them real sisters (Who are our mahrum i.e to whom we can not marry). If agniveer considers every girl as a mother then can we say hindus consider their wives to be their mothers before marriage? And then they wed their own mother? This is a weird concept.</span><br>

He went on trading just a few days till he came to Allah’s Apostle bearing the traces of yellow scent over his clothes. Allah’s Apostle asked him, “What is this scent?” He replied, “I have married a woman from the Ansar.” Allah’s Apostle asked, “How much Mahr have you given?” He said, “A date-stone weight of gold or a golden date-stone.” The Prophet said, “Arrange a marriage banquet even with a sheep.”</span>[Bukhari Volume 5, Book 58, Number 125]

<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: blue;">This hadith is regarding the stipulations of marriage. The Prophet (peace be upon him) is ordering the men not to leave one’s wife but to be with them. It is the right of the husband as well as the wifes to enjoy the married life. Maybe in Hinduism there are no rules and regulations regarding the life of husband and wife, that’s why agniveer finds this shameful. </span><br>

<span style="color: red;">Divorce and women rights</span><br>
<span style="color: red;">Quran contains the word divorce almost 17 times and interestingly, not even a single time, this word has been used to command women! Everywhere in Quran, Allah only talks with men about what you should do and what you should not do while divorcing women. This phenomenon of instructing one gender and ignoring other proves that Quran has no provision for women to divorce if they wish. Quran is the biggest slap on the faces of the likes of Zakir Naik, who foolishly claim Islam to be the only fair religion in <a title="terms" href="http://agniveer.com/terms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right"><span style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline;">terms</span><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> of women rights. Let’s analyze few verses from Quran and explore the dirty game behind divorce.</span><br>
<span style="color: red;">28. Divorced women shall wait concerning themselves for three monthly periods. Nor is it lawful for them to hide what Allah Hath created in their wombs, if they have faith in Allah and the Last Day. And their husbands have the better right to take them back in that period, if they wish for reconciliation. [Quran, 2:228]</span><br>
<span style="color: red;">Comments-</span><br>
<span style="color: red;">All muslim scholars use this verse to prove that Islam has provision to get a couple reunited even if they have divorced. But they forget to mention that it is the husband, who has right to take wife back and not the wife with the right to take her husband back. In fact wife is not in a picture at all while taking any decision, rather she is just an object, which can be accepted or rejected as per the convenience of husband.</span></em><br>

</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: mediumblue;"> عَنِ ابْنِ عُمَرَ رَضِيَ اللَّهُ عَنْهُمَا ، أَنَّ رَسُولَ اللهِ صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ قَالَ: إِنَّ أَعْظَمَ الذُّنُوبِ عِنْدَ اللهِ رَجُلٌ تَزَوَّجَ امْرَأَةً ، فَلَمَّا قَضَى حَاجَتَهُ مِنْهَا ، طَلَّقَهَا ، وَذَهَبَ بِمَهْرِهَا ، وَرَجُلٌ اسْتَعْمَلَ رَجُلاً ، فَذَهَبَ بِأُجْرَتِهِ ، وَآخَرُ يَقْتُلُ دَابَّةً عَبَثًا.</span><br>
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: mediumblue;">Narrated by Ibn Umar ra that Prophet peace be upon him said:<strong> It is one of the GREATEST SIN in the sight of Allah </strong>that a man marries a woman and when he finish his needs from her, he divorce her and do not giver her  Mahr [Mustadrak al Haakim 2/198, alAlbani ra authenticated in Silsilah as-Saheeha no. 999]</span><br>
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: navy; font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">This answer his false claim but see <span style="color: blue;"><strong>commentary of Ibne Kathir</strong></span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: blue;">This Ayah contains a command from Allah that the divorced woman, whose marriage was consummated and who still has menstruation periods, should wait for three (menstrual) periods (Quru’) after the divorce and then remarry if she wishes.(he went on and said) Hence, the husband who divorces his wife can take her back, providing she is still in her `Iddah (time spent before a divorced woman or a widow can remarry) and that his aim, by taking her back, is righteous and for the purpose of bringing things back to normal. However, this ruling applies where the husband is eligible to take his divorced wife back. We should mention that (when this Ayah 2:228 was revealed), the ruling that made the divorce thrice and specified when the husband is ineligible to take his divorced wife back, had not been revealed yet. Previously, the man used to divorce his wife and then take her back even if he had divorced her a hundred separate times. Thereafter, Allah revealed the following Ayah (2:229) that made the divorce only thrice. So there was now a reversible divorce and an irreversible final divorce.</span>(end quote)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>Comment:</strong> Islam made the divorce thrice to prevent husbands to irritate their wives again and again. Secondly, little knowledge is always harmul. There is something like khula in Islam. If a Woman does not like her Husband she can leave him or if the marriage is against her will she can leave her husband.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: blue;"><strong>Proof:1 </strong>Allah says: “If a wife fears cruelty or desertion on her husband’s part, there is no blame on them if they arrange an amicable settlement between themselves; and such settlement is best; even though men’s souls are swayed by greed. But if ye do good and practise self-restraint, God is well-acquainted with all that ye do. </span>(The Noble Quran, 4:128)”<br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: blue;"><strong>Proof 2:</strong> Narrated Al-Qasim: A woman from the offspring of Ja’far was afraid lest her guardian marry her (to somebody) against her will. So she sent for two elderly men from the Ansar, ‘AbdurRahman and Mujammi’, the two sons of Jariya, and they said to her, “Don’t be afraid, for Khansa’ bint Khidam was given by her father in marriage against her will, then the Prophet cancelled that marriage.”</span> (Bukhari Book #86, Hadith #99)<br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: blue;"><strong>Proof 3: </strong>Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas: A virgin came to the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) and mentioned that her father had married her against her will, so the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) allowed her to exercise her choice. </span>(Abu Dawud Book #11, Hadith #2091) (It is mentioned in Awn Al Mabood Commentary of Abu Dawud “This hadith is powerful Hasan”)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>Comment:</strong> The lie of agniveer is exposed when he said “she is just an object which can be accepted and rejected”</span></p>

<span style="color: red;">Comments-</span><br>
<span style="color: red;">One can see the status of woman in Islam, which is no more than a football, nothing to decide for herself, roaming around as per the directions given by men and bound to undergo such inhumane customs. Hadiths and tafseers make amply clear that mere marriage to another husband does not suffice. The wife must have sexual relation with new husband, and only then can she think of returning to original husband after giving the new husband divorce!</span></em><br>

<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: blue;">This is already proven that Woman can decide regarding her husband that to live with him or to leave him with valid reasons, Keeping a side his bad comments let us see the main theme of his accusation, he quoted 2:230, In Islam marriage is not the game of toys, so that you can give divorce and marry again, give divorce and marry again, i already quoted Ibne Kathir “Previously, the man used to divorce his wife and then take her back even if he had divorced her a hundred separate times.

<span style="color: blue;">2ndly There is no Divorce in intense Anger, Proof for this is Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “There is no divorce and no freeing of slaves when it is done by force or in a state of intense anger.” </span>(Narrated by Ibn Maajah, 2046; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in al-Irwa’, 2047)</span></p>

<span style="color: #993366;"><strong>Comment:</strong> In Islam the criteria is divorce is beautiful, a divorce will happen in three months, after that if she wants to marry again then with mutual consent they(husband and wife) can marry agin, if divorce happens again and after idda(prescribed period) both decide to marry again, they can marry gain but after that if they divorce third time then Qur`an says it is final you can not marry again unless woman marries other person (without making plan before marriage that I will divorce you after spending a night) and if he divorce her again by chance then she can marry previous husband again. see detail article here:</span><br>

<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: blue;">Reply<br>
This is full ayah<br>
(231. And when you have divorced women and they have fulfilled the term of their prescribed period, either take them back on a reasonable basis or set them free on a reasonable basis. But do not take them back to hurt them, and whoever does that, then he has wronged himself. And treat not the verses (Laws) of Allah in jest, but remember Allah’s favors on you (i.e., Islam), and that which He has sent down to you of the Book (i.e., the Qur’an) and Al-Hikmah (the Prophet’s Sunnah ـ legal ways ـ Islamic jurisprudence) whereby He instructs you. And fear Allah, and know that Allah is All-Aware of everything).<br>
<strong>Ibne Kathir Commented: </strong>This is a command from Allah to men that when one of them divorces his wife with a reversible divorce, he should treat her kindly. So when her term of `Iddah (waiting period) nears its end, he either takes her back in a way that is better, including having witnesses that he has taken her back, and he lives with her with kindness. Or, he should release her after her `Iddah finishes and then kindly asks her to depart from his house, without disputing, fighting with her or using foul words. </span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: blue;">Allah then said: (But do not take them back to hurt them,)<br>
Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Masruq, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak, Ar-Rabi` and Muqatil bin Hayyan said that a man used to divorce his wife, and when her `Iddah came near its end, he would take her back to harm her and to stop her from marrying someone else. He then divorced her and she would begin her `Iddah and when her `Iddah term neared its end, he would take her back again, so that the term of `Iddah would be prolonged for her. After that, Allah prohibited this practice. Allah has also threatened those who indulge in such practices, when He said;<br>
(…and whoever does that, then he has wronged himself.) meaning, by defying Allah’s commandments</span>.(end quoted)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;">Comment: Agniveer said who are men to take them back and set her free? The answer is simple i.e. he is husband of wife. Again why agniveer creating fight between husband and wife? When Quran is at its best that do not harm women and do not take them back so that you(men) may harm them(women), live with them honourably etc. Regarding husband and wife rights see the answer to introduction of agniveer at start of this article.</span></p>

<span style="color: red;">a. According to this verse, child will remain with father and not with mother after divorce.</span><br>
<span style="color: red;">b. Mother can keep her baby only for two years [after divorce], that too with the permission of his father. One should not think that this 2 year program is because of sympathy for mother. In fact, this is the period, in which, a child needs breast feeding for his/her growth. So mother is paid for this two year program and once, 2 years are over, mother is set free to go anywhere!</span></em><br>

This is the full verse [002:233] The mothers shall give suck to their children for two whole years, (that is) for those (parents) who desire to complete the term of suckling, but the father of the child shall bear the cost of the mothers food and clothing on a reasonable basis. No person shall have a burden laid on him greater than he can bear. No mother shall be treated unfairly on account of her child, nor father on account of his child. And on the (fathers) heir is incumbent the like of that (which was incumbent on the father). If they both decide on weaning, by mutual consent, and after due consultation, there is no sin on them. And if you decide on a foster suckling-mother for your children, there is no sin on you, provided you pay (the mother) what you agreed (to give her) on reasonable basis. And fear Allah and know that Allah is All-Seer of what you do.)</span> Muhammad Al-Hilali &amp; Muhsin Khan<br>
<span style="color: blue;"><strong>Ibne Kathir Commented: </strong>Ad-Dahhak commented, “If the husband divorces his wife, with whom he had a child, and she suckles that child, he is required to provide for the mother’s expenses and clothes within reason.”</span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: blue;"><strong>Allah said:</strong> (No mother shall be treated unfairly on account of her child,) meaning, the mother should not decline to rear her child to harm its father. The mother does not have the right to refrain from suckling the child after giving birth, unless she suckles him/her the milk that is necessary for his/her survival. Later on, she is allowed to give up custody of the child as long as she does not do that intending to harm the father. In addition, the father is not allowed to take the child from his mother to harm the mother. This is why Allah said:<br>
(…nor father on account of his child.) meaning, by taking the child from its mother intending to harm the mother. This is the Tafsir of Mujahid, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak, Az-Zuhri, As-Suddi, Ath-Thawri and Ibn Zayd, and others on this Ayah.</span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: blue;"><strong>Allah then said: </strong>(And on the (father’s) heir is incumbent the like of that (which was incumbent on the father).) meaning, by refraining from harming the relative (of the father, i.e., his infant), as Mujahid, Ash-Sha`bi and Ad-Dahhak stated.(end quote)</span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: blue;"><strong>Ibne Kathir went on and said</strong><br>
(And if you decide on a foster suckling-mother for your children, there is no sin on you, provided you pay (the mother) what you agreed (to give her) on a reasonable basis.) meaning, if the mother and the father both agree that the father assumes custody of the child due to a circumstance that compels her or allows him to do so, then there is no sin in this case. Hence, the mother is allowed to give up the child and the father is allowed to assume custody of the child. The father should kindly give the mother her expenses for the previous period (during which she reared and suckled the child), and he should seek other women to suckle his child for monetary compensation.</span>(end quote)<br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>Comment:</strong> One can see commentary of agniveer and commentary of Qur`an by sahaba and students of sahaba. By the way he left this very famous hadith, let me quote for him<br>
A Mother has 3 times more right over her children then the father<br>
Proof: Saheeh Muslim Book 032, Number 6180:.Abu Huraira reported that a person came to Allah, ‘s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and said: Who among the people is most deserving of a fine treatment from my hand? He said: Your mother. He again said: Then who (is the next one)? He said: Again it is your mother (who deserves the best treatment from you). He said: Then who (is the next one)? He (the Holy Prophet) said: Again, it is your mother. He (again) said: Then who? Thereupon he said: Then it is your father</span><br>

So what is the point in quoting this verse? See translation by Muhammad Al-Hilali &amp; Muhsin Khan [002:236] There is no sin on you, if you divorce women while yet you have not touched (had sexual relation with) them, nor appointed unto them their Mahr (bridal money given by the husband to his wife at the time of marriage). But bestow on them ( a suitable gift), the rich according to his means, and the poor according to his means, a gift of reasonable amount is a duty on the doers of good.</span><br>

<span style="color: red;">a. Another hadith exposing the equal rights of women. Man can divorce a woman by saying “Talaaq”, three times and wife cannot do anything but to go somewhere else in that case. If she is pregnant, she can be appointed by her husband as feeding machine for the coming baby. However, if husband does not want to feed his baby by his/her mother, she will be set free whenever husband wishes!</span><br>
<span style="color: red;">b. On the other hand, if a woman wants to divorce her husband, she has to prove in the Islamic court with all the evidences and proofs that she has genuine reasons for her desire.</span><br>
<span style="color: red;">c. Most of the times, woman fails to get divorce as per her wish, since her testimony is considered half than that of man. And if man does not want to give divorce, there is hardly any chance of getting it. In addition to this, woman is abused by her husband, physically and mentally in reply to the attempts made by her against his will. And needless to say, the everlasting fire of hell is ready for her for not satisfying husband!</span></em><br>

</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: mediumblue;">‘Indeed it has reached me that from the evil hidden sins which Allaah has made Haraam, which are not clearly mentioned in the Qur’aan, are that a man marries a woman and when his companion becomes old and she has  stayed with him for a long time, and has produced all that her womb can, then he divorces her without any reason to do so.’</span><br>
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: mediumblue;">Shaykh Albaani mentions:</span><br>
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: mediumblue;">‘It is collected by Tabarani in ‘al-Mu’jam al-Kabeer’, Ibn ‘Aasakir in ‘Tareekh Dimishq’. And this Isnad is Saheeh.’ [Silsilah Saheehah No.2871]</span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><br>
<span style="color: blue;">Shaykh Salih Al Munajjid said</span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: blue;">Many women hasten to demand a divorce from their husbands for the least little argument, or if their husbands do not give them what they want of money. Some women may be egged on by troublemakers among their relatives or neighbours to challenge their husbands with provocative words such as: “If you were a real man, you would divorce me!” The dire results of divorce are well known: breakdown of the family and children roaming the streets. A person may come to regret divorce when it is too late. For all these reasons and others, the Sharee’ah wisely prohibited such actions. Thawbaan (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Any woman who asks her husband for a divorce with no sound reason will be deprived of smelling the fragrance of Paradise.” </span>(Reported by Ahmad, 5.277; see also Saheeh al-Jaami’, 2703).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">‘<span style="color: blue;">Uqbah ibn ‘Aamir (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Woman who ask for divorce and women who contend unnecessarily with their husbands are hypocrites.”<span style="color: black;">(Reported by al-Tabaraani in al-Kabeer, 17/339; see also Saheeh al-Jaami’, 1934)<span style="color: blue;">. But if there is a sound reason, such as the husband abandoning prayer, drinking or taking drugs, or forcing his wife to do something haraam, or oppressing her and making her suffer by denying her the rights granted to her by Islaam, and he does not listen to advice to mend his ways, then in this case there is nothing wrong with a woman seeking divorce for her own sake and for the sake of her religion.</span>[Muharamat Prohibi</span>tions that are taken too lightly, Chapter Asking one’s husband for a divorce for no legitimate reason, English Translation Book by Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid]</span><br>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><em><span style="color: red;">Agniveer stated:</span><br>
<span style="color: red;">Islam and Hijab</span><br>
<span style="color: red;">As per Islamic scriptures, women should have hijab – cover their entire body except parts of face. Likes of Zakir Naik argue that this is to protect chastity of Muslim women. We have already seen how Islam prevents their chastity and dignity in last few articles. One agrees that nudity and reckless display of body to attract attention is as abhorrent as caging a woman in such clothes that deprive her of Vitamic D and make Muslim women patients of bone deficiencies. However, the reason behind such restrictions was not any concern for modesty of women from those who permit sex-slaves and polygamy. The real reason is provided in Al-Tabari and hadiths.</span><br>
<span style="color: red;">Muhammad once went to his (adopted!) son’s home and saw his daughter-in-law (Zainab) in nude. This afflicted his heart and he forced Zaid, his son, to divorce Zainab and then married her. (In fact he did not even marry. He just kept her with him and claimed that their marriage happened in sky!). This opened a Pandora’s box. He was now scared that other men may also see his wives’ in revealing clothes and may run after them. So once, after he heard some news about his wives going for toilet in open, he immediately revealed Ayats that Muslim women should cover themselves completely.</span><br>
<span style="color: red;">Had this Ayat been revealed before Muhammad saw Zainab in nude, it would have saved the man from such a big disgrace of getting physical with one’s own daughter-in-law!</span><br>
<span style="color: red;">And that has made matters worse for Muslim women! They cannot trust anyone as brothers or fatherly figures. They are at mercy of their husbands who can divorce them at will. Even the Qazi cannot force a husband from divorcing his wife, if he has decided so. And once the husband divorces, even father-in-law can marry the isolated woman, or keep her as a sex-slave!</span></em><br>

According to him there was a law that a woman or a man could have sexual intercourse with eleven persons. If no child was born from the one, then a woman could go to another. If even then she was unable to beget a child, then she could go to the third and so on till she had intercourse with eleven men </span>(Dayanand’s commentary on Rig Veda, 10/85/45).<br>

<span style="color: red;">Addendum:</span><br>
<span style="color: red;">If one looks at the Vedic concept of marriage, amply reflected (though not fully) in Hindu Marriage laws:</span><br>
<span style="color: red;">a. The rights are equal for husband and wife.</span><br>
<span style="color: red;">b. If one beats her wife, and wife complains, the husband has to face jail.</span><br>
<span style="color: red;">c. Divorce is not unilateral. Both husband and wife are on same footing. A woman has rights to reject her husband if he commits adultery or indulged in nefarious acts.</span><br>
<span style="color: red;">d. Polygamy and adultery(temporary or permanent) are illegal and not acceptable.</span><br>
<span style="color: red;">e. There is no dress constraint, except that one should not wear a dress that attracts immoral attention.</span><br>
<span style="color: red;">f. Property rights are equal.</span><br>
<span style="color: red;">g. Rape cases reply primarily on victim’s witness and one is not expected to bring 2 live spectators.</span><br>
<span style="color: red;">h. Any denigration of women is against Vedas and demand strictest punishments.</span></em><br>

<span style="color: red;">Dear Sister, in case, you are indeed resolved to marry a person, make sure he converts to Hinduism, rather than you converting to Islam. </span><br>
<span style="color: red;">If indeed he loves you, he will readily agree because it is win-win situation for both partners. In case he does not, reject it. Understand that you have been a victim of love jehad. Burn the past and look ahead. It happened to you, because you ignored the tenets of our culture and were misled by fraud environment all around. But better late than never.</span></em><br>

His frustration is clear, Alhumdulillah more women are accepting Islam then men, The more Islamophobics are doing propaganda, the more women are accepting. So keep doing this act and invite women to Islam, Thank you agniveer.</span><br>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><em><span style="color: red;">Agniveer stated:</span><br>
<span style="color: red;">Dear Sister, in case, you already made a blunder and became a Muslim to marry a Muslim, not all is lost.</span><br>
<span style="color: red;">Insist your husband that both of you convert to Hinduism. This would be win-win for both of you. In case he refuses to, again understand that you have been a victim of love-jehad. Be strong, know your roots, have faith in Ishwar, take divorce from your husband and start afresh. Do so even if you have children. This will save their future.</span><br>
<span style="color: red;">In case he plans to relocate to a Muslim country, hurry up! Once you leave a non-Muslim country, the ball will no more remain in your court. You shall be doomed. In case you have already relocated, remain tactfully silent, keep him in good humor, convince him to come to India or any non-Muslim country, even for a short break. And once you are in a non-Muslim country, assert your right to dignity. Ask him to either convert or divorce. Make sure you have carried all your papers, in case you need to fight a legal battle.</span><br>
<span style="color: red;">Divorce may not be easy due to anti-women Islamic laws, but if you live in India or a non-Muslim country, you can still wriggle out through court-battles on pretext of your Fundamental Right to profess any religion. It may be a hard pill to swallow, but the only one to save you and your future generations from ignominy. Remember, dignity and self-respect are far above any short-term conveniences.</span><br>
<span style="color: red;">Welcome to Vedic dharma and live the life you aspire for – devoid of inequality and discrimination!</span></em><br>

<span style="color: red;">Dear Sister, if you have been born as a Muslim woman and have married/ about to marry a Muslim:</span><br>
<span style="color: red;">Convince your husband/ would-be to convert and become Hindus. You will find huge number of articles on agniveer.com on why you should do so. But more importantly, as a woman, you would be able to live with head held high and with dignity. You would have equal rights and no discrimination compared to men. If your husband/ would-be indeed loves you, if would be only more than happy to gift you such pride and right to live with dignity.</span><br>
<span style="color: red;">So take that bold step, and embrace the Vedic dharma. Reject the cult of the barbaric who dehumanize women!</span></em><br>

<span style="color: #993366;">It is nothing but begging, lastly I want to quote Few verses from Veda</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: #993366;">In the Vedas wherever special prayers have been made for children, they have always been for sons. Nowhere is a prayer or charm recited to be granted a daughter. For exmaple,</span><br>
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #993366; font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">1. O Bounteous Indra, make this bride blest in her sons and fortunate. Vouchsafe to her ten sons, and make her husband the eleventh man. <span style="color: black;">[Rigved Mandal 10, Sookt 85, Mantra 45]</span><br>

</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #993366; font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">2. This is thy Soma draught, O bright Âditya: take delight therein. To this mine utterance, O ye men, give credence, what good the man and wife obtain by praying: A manly son is born and gathers riches, and thrives for ever sinless in the dwelling. <span style="color: black;">[Yajurved Adhyay 8, Mantra 5]</span><br>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #993366; font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">3. Fathers, bestow on me a babe, a boy enwreathed with lotuses, so that there may be here a man. <span style="color: black;">[Yajurved Adhyay 2, Mantra 33]</span><br>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: #993366;">All prayers are for being granted a boy and none for a girl.</span><br>
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: #993366;">Speaking of marriage Swami Dayanad Saraswati says,</span><br>
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: #993366;">“In Sanskrit a daughter is called duhitri (from Du – distant, Hit – good), because the marriage of a girl to a man who comes from a distant country or distant part of the same country is productive of good.</span><br>
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: #993366;">“If the bride’s people do not live very far from her husband’s home, there is a possibility of her parents becoming poor, as whenever she visits her parents, they will have to give her something or other by the way of a present.”</span> [Satyarth Prakash Chapter 4, The advantages and disadvantages of distant and near marriages, Page 85]

However in reality, muslim women are suppressed severely under the barbaric laws of Quran and Hadith. To show, how false and stupid, the claims of equality for women (in marital life) in Islam are, we analyse Quran and authentic Hadith. Its clearly evident from the scriptures, that the founder of Islam was too busy to offer luxuries to his army-men comprised of males to have bothered to even think of women above status of animals. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReply\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Dr. Zakir actually said, is here:\r\n\r\n\r\na)\r\nMen and Women's Rights in Islam: Equal or Equally Balanced?

Islam allows having multiple partners for men, but the same is strictly prohibited for women. A man can marry up to 4 wives but if woman tries to go to second, this is considered adultery and its punishment is stoning to death for woman. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nReply\r\n\r\n\r\na) Polygamy by Asim ul Haq\r\nhttp:\/\/www.systemoflife.com\/answering-islamophobes\/answering-islam-website\/213-polygamy\r\n\r\nb) Stoning to death by Asim ul Haq\r\nhttp:\/\/www.systemoflife.com\/answering-islamophobes\/answering-islam-website\/256-stoning-to-death\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAgniveer stated\r\n1. Men are in charge of, they have authority over, women, disciplining them and keeping them in check, because of that with which God has preferred the one over the other, that is, because God has given them the advantage over women, in knowledge, reason, authority and otherwise, and because of what they expend, on them [the women], of their property.…. Therefore the righteous women are devoutly obedient…. As to those women on whose part ye fear disloyalty and ill-conduct, admonish them, refuse to share their beds, and beat them. [Quran 4:34]\r\nComments-\r\na. Who is the one appointed for keeping check over the man? Or is it that men don't do wrong?\r\nb. What should a woman do if she finds her husband disloyal or ill conducive? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI'll provide a short reply. This is a wrong translation provided by him. The correct one is as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Men are the protectors and maintainers of women, because Allah has made one of them to excel the other, and because they spend (to support them) from their means. Therefore the righteous women are devoutly obedient (to Allah and to their husbands), and guard in the husbands absence what Allah orders them to guard (e.g. their chastity, their husbands property, etc.). As to those women on whose part you see ill conduct, admonish them (first), (next), refuse to share their beds, (and last) beat them (lightly, if it is useful), but if they return to obedience, seek not against them means (of annoyance). Surely, Allah is Ever Most High, Most Great. [004:034, Muhammad Al-Hilali & Muhsin Khan] \r\n\r\n\r\nIt is mentioned in Sahih Muslim, narrated from Jaabir that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said in his Farewell Sermon:\r\n\"Fear Allah concerning women! Verily you have taken them on the security of Allah, and intercourse with them has been made lawful unto you by words of Allah. You too have rights over them, and that they should not allow anyone to sit on your bed whom you do not like. But if they do that, you can chastise them but not severely (another hadith says but without causing injury or leaving a mark.). Their rights upon you are that you should provide them with food and clothing in a fitting manner\" (Narrated by Muslim, 1218, Tirmidhi, 1163, and Ibn Maajah, 1851)\r\n\r\n\r\nWe ask the author, whether any non Muslim husband would permit his wife to allow any other person whom he does not like on their bed? See the beauty of Islam.Even then it says, admonish them (first), (next), refuse to share their beds (In refusing to share the bed, even the husband is deprived), (and last) beat them lightly, if it is useful. Their rights upon you are that you should provide them with food and clothing in a fitting manner\" Subhan'Allah\r\n\r\n\r\nAll this is for our good because Allah says \"O you who believe!

What should a woman do if she finds her husband disloyal or ill conducive?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReply\r\nAllah says: \"If a wife fears cruelty or desertion on her husband's part, there is no blame on them if they arrange an amicable settlement between themselves; and such settlement is best; even though men's souls are swayed by greed. But if ye do good and practice self-restraint, God is well-acquainted with all that ye do. (The Noble Quran, 4:128)\"\r\n\r\n\r\ni) It's an order to the Husband that he should love his wife\r\nProphet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \"No believing man should hate a believing woman. If he dislikes one of her characteristics, he may be pleased with another.\" Narrated by Muslim (1469) from Abu Hurayrah. \r\n\r\n\r\nii) According to a report narrated by Musnad Ahmad (2\/524), it was said: \" من أعول يا رسول الله ؟ قال : امرأتك ممن تعول\r\nFor whom am I responsible, O Messenger of Allaah?\" He said, \"Your wife is one of those for whom you are responsible.\"\r\n\r\n\r\niii) Another hadith says Anas (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:\r\n\"Allaah will ask everyone who has been given responsibility about whatever he was responsible for, until He asks a man about his family.\" (Authenticated by Ibn Hibaan in Al Ihsan hadeeth no: 1562, Authenticated by Shaykh Al Albani in As Saheeha hadeeth no: 1636).\r\n\r\n\r\niv) Lastly Shaykh Salih Al Munajjid said in Islamqa fatwa no: 2083 states:\r\nIf it is the husband who is mistreating his wife, that does not mean that she should remain oppressed or that her hands are tied. She has the right – just as the husband has – to warn and advise him, and to remind him to fear Allaah. If that does not work, she can seek the help of wise people among his relatives and her own, and they can advise him. If this does not work, then the matter can be taken to a qaadi (Muslim judge) who can force him to do the right thing – and Allaah is above them all.(end)\r\n\r\n\r\nv) It is narrated that the women of the Sahaabah used to argue and debate with them, and indeed this is the way in which the Mothers of the Believers [i.e., the Prophet's wives] used to act with our Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), as 'Umar ibn al-Khattaab said to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): \"We Quraysh used to control our women, but when we came to the Ansaar we found that they were a people who were controlled by their women. So our women started to adopt the ways of the Ansaari women. I got angry with my wife and she argued with me and I did not like her arguing with me. She said, 'Why do you object to me arguing with you? By Allaah, the wives of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) argue with him...'\" Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 4895; Muslim, 1479.\r\n\r\n\r\nAl-Haafiz ibn Hajar said – discussing the lessons to be learned from this hadeeth –\r\n\"This indicates that being harsh with women is something blameworthy, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) adopted the way of the Ansaar with their women and forsook the way of his people.\" Fath al-Baari, 9\/291\r\n\r\n\r\nvi) Also go through\r\n\r\na) Refuting Muhammad recommended wife beating and beat Aysha by Asim ul Haq http:\/\/www.systemoflife.com\/answering-islamophobes\/abul-kasem\/223-muhammad-recommended-wife-beating-and-also-beat-wife-ayesha\r\nb) Does Islam allow wife beating?

[Sahih Muslim Book #024, Hadith #5310]\r\n\r\n\r\nIbn 'Abd al-Barr said: what the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) meant was women who wear clothes made of light fabric which describes and does not cover. They are clothed in name but naked in reality. Transmitted by al-Suyooti in Tanweer al-Hawaalik, 3\/103.\r\n\r\n\r\nShaykh Abdul Aziz Bin Baz May Allah be please with him commented \"kaasiyat 'aariyaat (translated above as \"dressed but appear to be naked\" may have another meaning, which is that they are enjoying the blessings of Allaah, but they do not give thanks for them and they do not obey the commands of Allaah or heed His prohibitions, even though Allaah has bestowed upon them wealth and other blessings.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe hadeeth is also explained in a different manner, which is that they wear clothes that do not cover them, because they are too thin or too short, so they do not serve the purpose of clothes, hence they are described as naked, and because the clothes they wear do not cover their 'awrah.\r\n\r\n\r\nMaa'ilaat (literally \"deviant\") means they turn away from chastity and righteousness, i.e., they commit sins and evil deeds like those who do immoral actions, or they fall short in doing the obligatory duties, prayer etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nMumeelaat means they turn others away, i.e., they call people to evil and corruption, so by their words and actions they lead others into immorality and sin, and they commit immoral actions because of their lack of faith or the weakness of their faith. The point of this saheeh hadeeth is to warn against oppression and all kinds of corruption from men and women.

The Prophet reached Mecca and performed Tawaf of the Ka'ba and between Safa and Marwa and did not finish the Ihram, because he had the Hadi with him. His companions and his wives performed Tawaf (of the Ka'ba and between Safa and Marwa), and those who had no Hadi with them finished their Ihram. I got the menses and performed all the ceremonies of Hajj. So, when the Night of Hasba (night of departure) came, I said, \"O Allah's Apostle! All your companions are returning with Hajj and 'Umra except me.\" He asked me, \"Didn't you perform Tawaf of the Ka'ba (Umra) when you reached Mecca?\" I said, \"No.\" He said, \"Go to Tan'im with your brother 'Abdur-Rahman, and assume Ihram for 'Umra and I will wait for you at such and such a place.\" So I went with 'Abdur-Rahman to Tan'im and assumed Ihram for 'Umra. Then Safiya bint Huyay got menses. The Prophet said, \" 'Aqra Halqa! You will detain us! Didn't you perform Tawaf-al-Ifada on the Day of Nahr (slaughtering)?\" She said, \"Yes, I did.\" He said, \"Then there is no harm, depart.\" So I met the Prophet when he was ascending the heights towards Mecca and I was descending, or vice-versa [Bukhari Kitab al Hajj no: 815]\r\n\r\nThe words used by Prophet peace be upon him are Aqra Halqa, Islambasics Library: Dictionary says\r\nAQRA HALQA: It is just an exclamatory expression, the literal meaning of which is not meant always.

They do not invoke Allah against him but this is a form of language used and the phrase said by the Prophet in this hadeeth is known to be one of those types of statement.\r\n\r\nEven if someone is not accepting the truth; let me quote a beautiful hadith\r\n\r\n\r\nImam Ahmad recorded that 'Amr bin Abi Qurrah Al-Kindi said: \"Hudhayfah was in Al-Mada'in and he was mentioning things that the Messenger of Allah had said. Hudhayfah came to Salman and Salman said: 'O Hudhayfah, the Messenger of Allah ﴿would sometimes be angry and would speak accordingly, and would sometimes be pleased and would speak accordingly. I know that the Messenger of Allah ﴾ addressed us and said: (Any man of my Ummah whom I have insulted or cursed when I was angry -- for I am a man from among the sons of Adam, and I get angry just as you do. But Allah has sent me as a Mercy to the Worlds, so I will make that my anger﴾ into blessings for him on the Day of Resurrection.'') This was also recorded by Abu Dawud from Ahmad bin Yunus from Za'idah.(end quote from Tafsir Ibn Katheer 21: 107)\r\n\r\nProphet peace be upon him said \" \"I have been sent as a blessing, not a curse.\"\r\n\r\nPlease read about the character of the Prophet peace be upon him here: (http:\/\/islamqa.com\/en\/ref\/71184\/)\r\n\r\n\r\nProphet peace be upon him said: \"I eat as a slave eats and I sit as a slave sits.\"[Narrated by Abu Ya'laa, 8\/318,Silsilat al-Saheehah, 544.]\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us have a look at how the Vedic gods address their wives. Indra Ji is addressing Indrani ji.:\r\nDame with the lovely hands and arms, with broad hair-plaits and huge hips, Why, O thou hero's wife, art thou angry with our Vrishākapi? Supreme is Indra over all. [Atharvaved 20:126:8]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAgniveer stated\r\n6. \"And mind you, when a woman has her periods she is not allowed to pray or to fast. This is the measure of your deficiency in religion.\" [Bukhari vol 1, hadith 301]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReply\r\n\r\n\r\nSukainah the daughter of Shaikh al-Albaani said, \"I asked my father, may Allaah have mercy on him, 'How does the female who has the excuse accorded to her by the Sharee'ah [i.e., menses] perform worship on the Night of Decree?' \r\n\r\nSo he answered me, saying, 'By supplicating, remembering Allaah [dhikr] and reciting the Quraan, and there is no problem in her doing that. And I think that you are sure about the fact that it is not disliked for the menstruating woman to recite the Quraan. So this is the way out from one angle.\r\n\r\nAnd from another, it is fitting for the Muslim in such circumstances, whether he is male or female, to emulate the Prophet عليه السلام who said, 'Seize the benefit of five before five: your youth before you become old, and your health before you become ill ...' [Saheeh at-Targheeb wat-Tarheeb, no. 3355]. For what reason [did he say this?] Because in Sahih al-Bukhari it has been reported that, 'When a slave [a believer] falls ill or travels, then he will get written to his accounts [the reward] similar to that which he used to get for his good deeds practised at home and in good health [as if he is doing them on his journey and in illness].' [Bukhaari 2996]\r\n\r\nSo it is upon such a woman to seize the opportunity of benefitting from her time when she is clean and is able to stand during the last ten nights, or at least the odd nights, or at the very least the day or night of the twenty-seventh.\r\n\r\nFor indeed when Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, knows that His female servant used to do that when she was able to stand in prayer then suddenly comes into a state where she is excused, He records for her what used to be written for her when she was in a state of purity.\r\n\r\nThis is a very important point. Its fruits are that the Muslim should strive as was just explained: that he should always spend his time in obedience as much as he is able to. Such that when his obedience increases and the worship then passes him by [due to him becoming ill or travelling, the reward] is still written for him even if he is not able to actually perform it.'\"\r\n\r\nSource: http:\/\/shaikhalbaani.wordpress.com\/2011\/07\/09\/how-does-a-menstruating-woman-worship-during-the-night-of-decree\/\r\n\r\nShe will be rewarded for not praying during their periods. Allah says \"Whoever works righteousness, whether male or female, while he (or she) is a true believer (of Islamic Monotheism) verily, to him We will give a good life (in this world with respect, contentment and lawful provision), and We shall pay them certainly a reward in proportion to the best of what they used to do (i.e. Paradise in the Hereafter).\" [016:097]\r\n\r\nAnd following command (that do not pray in periods) of Allah and his Prophet peace be upon him is righteousness and in result of Righteousness she will surely be rewarded.\r\n\r\nIt is mentioned in Sharah al Muslim An-Nawawi 4\/26 : \r\nهَذَا الْحُكْم ـ أي عدم قضاء الصلاة ـ مُتَّفَق عَلَيْهِ أَجْمَع الْمُسْلِمُونَ عَلَى أَنَّ الْحَائِض وَالنُّفَسَاء لا تَجِب عَلَيْهِمَا الصَّلاة وَلا الصَّوْم فِي الْحَال , وَأَجْمَعُوا عَلَى أَنَّهُ لا يَجِب عَلَيْهِمَا قَضَاء الصَّلَاة , وَأَجْمَعُوا عَلَى أَنَّهُ يَجِب عَلَيْهِمَا قَضَاء الصَّوْم ، قَالَ الْعُلَمَاء : وَالْفَرْق بَيْنهمَا أَنَّ الصَّلاة كَثِيرَة مُتَكَرِّرَة فَيَشُقّ قَضَاؤُهَا بِخِلافِ الصَّوْم .\r\n\"This ruling – i.e., that prayers should not be made up) is agreed upon by all the Muslims, that menstruating women and women who bleed following childbirth do not have to pray or fast at the times when prayers or fasts are due; they are unanimously agreed that they do not have to make up the prayers, and they are unanimously agreed that they do have to make up the fasts. The scholars said, the difference between them is that the prayers are many and are repeated, so it would be difficult to make them up, unlike the fasts.\r\n\r\nShaykh Salman al Odha said:\r\nThese are matters of Islamic Law. A woman is neither sinful nor blameworthy because of the prayers and fasts that she misses. She, in fact, receives blessings by obeying Allah and abstaining from those acts while she is menstruating. Her testimony as a witness is half that of men only in matters wherein she is generally less versed than men. In other matters wherein women have particular knowledge, like fosterage and virginity, the testimony of a woman is accepted but not that of a man.\r\n\r\n\r\nAllah's Messenger (peace be upon him) attested to the perfect character of four women: Mary, Âsiyah the wife of Pharaoh, Fâtimah, and Khadîjah. He definitely did not mean that these women did not go through menstruation. He was referring to their good character, strength of intellect, and soundness of opinion (end)\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd on the other hand Males have to pray in a mosque and if he leaves the prayer, it is one of the biggest sins. \r\n\r\n\r\nTo understand the meaning of this hadeeth (specially deficiency) please go through this detailed reply by Scholars:\r\nhttp:\/\/truthofhinduism.com\/islam\/women-defficient-intelligence-religion-answer\/\r\n\r\n\r\nCounter Question: It is mentioned in Rigved Mandal 8, Sookt 33, Mantra 17 censures women by saying, \"Indra himself hath said, The mind of woman brooks not discipline, Her intellect hath little weight.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nComment: Agniveer should see their own scriptures rather then copy\/pasting from the internet.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAgniveer stated\r\n7. Muhammad said: No woman should observe fast when her spouse is present (in the house) but with his permission. And whatever she spends from his earnings without his sanction, for him is half the reward. (Book #005, Hadith #2238)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReply\r\nSharah Sahih Muslim an-Nawawi says: \"This is to be understood as referring to voluntary and recommended fasts for which there is no specific time. It is understood as meaning that this is prohibited, as our companions stated. The reason for that is that the husband has the right to intimacy with his wife on all days, and his right is to be implemented immediately, and cannot be deferred because of voluntary acts of worship or because of an obligatory deed that may be done at any time.\" Sharh Muslim, 7\/115. \r\n\r\n\r\nIslam QA Fatwa no: 66621 says\r\n\r\n\r\nThe husband has to fear Allaah with regard to his wife, and not burden her with more than she can bear. Many men keep their womenfolk busy all day with cooking, and at night with making sweets, so the woman's days and nights are wasted and she cannot make the most of her fasting days or her nights by doing acts of worship. One of the wife's rights over her husband is that she should have a share of the worship of this month. So he should not prevent her from reading Qur'aan, or praying qiyaam. There should be understanding between them so that there will not be any conflict between his rights and her worship of her Lord. This, of course, has to do with naafil acts of worship; with regard to obligatory acts of worship, the husband has no right to stop his wife doing them.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe way of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) with his wives was to encourage them to worship and obey Allaah, especially in the last ten days of Ramadaan.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was narrated that 'Aa'ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) said: \"When the (last) ten nights began, the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) would tighten his waist-wrapper (i.e., strive hard in worship or refrain from intimacy with his wives), stay awake at night and wake his family.\" Narrated by al-Bukhaari (1920) and Muslim (1174).\r\n\r\n\r\nIf both, husband and wife, understand their rights and duties, they will avoid difficulties and arguments in most cases. If they understand that such occasions will only recur a few times during their lives, this should make them keener to make the most of the days and nights of Ramadaan.(end quote)\r\n\r\n\r\nComment: In short, this is only for voluntary (Nafal) fasts and only when the husband is staying with the wife. Obeying the husband is obligatory as far as husband is not saying something which goes against Islamic law. Women will get more rewards in obeying the husband. Secondly most husbands do not prevent their wives from fasting the nawafil fasts. When a woman gets her husband's permission for voluntary fasting she attains a lot of blessings. When a woman obeys her husband she shows the true spirit of Islamic marriage.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAlso men are not allowed to do non-obligatory Ibadah  if the rights of wives are not fulfilled, same is the case with women if the rights of husband are not fulfilled it is not allowed for her to do non obligatory ibadah. \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nNarrated 'Abdullah bin 'amr bin Al-'As: Allah's Apostle said to me, \"O 'Abdullah! Have I not been informed that you fast during the day and offer prayers all the night.\" 'Abdullah replied, \"Yes, O Allah's Apostle!\" The Prophet said, \"Don't do that; fast for few days and then give it up for few days, offer prayers and also sleep at night, as your body has a right on you, and your wife has a right on you, and your guest has a right on you. ..(Bukhari Book #31, Hadith #196) (From the book of Abdul Hadi Abdul Khaliq Madni)\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAlso see:\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/letmeturnthetables.blogspot.com\/2009\/01\/why-are-women-required-to-seek-husbands.html\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nCounter question: It is written in Rig Veda: \"There cannot be any friendship with a woman. Her heart is like that of a hyena.\" [Rig Veda, 10\/95\/15]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nComment: Agniveer should read the Veda before attacking Islam. One can compare the Islamic teachings and the teachings of Hinduism. According to Islam, both husband and wife have similar rights but a Husband has to be more responsible because he has to feed her, clother her, provide for her, etc, on the other hand Hinduism says her heart is like the heart of a HYENA? And hence we can not befriend them?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAgniveer stated\r\n8. The Prophet said: If one of you marries a woman or buys a slave, he should say: \"O Allah, I ask Thee for the good in her, and in the disposition Thou hast given her; I take refuge in Thee from the evil in her, and in the disposition Thou hast given her.\" When he buys a camel, he should take hold of the top of its hump and say the same kind of thing. (Book #11, Hadith #2155)\r\nComments-\r\nSo, according to Islam, marrying a woman is equivalent to buy a slave! Really, Mullahs rightly say that muslims should treat their slaves the way they treat their wives. Muhammad discovered the best way to do so by degrading wife to the level of slave!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReply\r\nhttp:\/\/letmeturnthetables.blogspot.com\/2009\/01\/does-islam-equate-women-with-animals.html\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAgniveer stated\r\n9. The Prophet said: It is not permissible for a woman to present a gift (from her husband's property) except with the permission of her husband. (Book #23, Hadith #3540) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReply\r\n\r\nEven the husband is forbidden to take his wife's money without her consent. \r\n\r\nAllaah says\r\n\r\n\"and live with them honorably\" [al-Nisa' 4:19]\r\n\r\n\"And they (women) have rights (over their husbands as regards living expenses) similar (to those of their husbands) over them (as regards obedience and respect) to what is reasonable, but men have a degree (of responsibility) over them. And Allaah is All-Mighty, All-Wise\"[al-Baqarah 2:228]\r\n\r\nA husband has to take care of his wife and if he does not take care, then the wife is allowed to take money from her husband even without his permission.\r\n\r\nIt was narrated that 'Aa'ishah said: \"Hind bint 'Utbah, the wife of Abu Sufyaan, entered upon the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and said, 'O Messenger of Allaah, Abu Sufyaan is a stingy man who does not spend enough on me and my children, except for what I take from his wealth without his knowledge. Is there any sin on me for doing that?' The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, 'Take from his wealth on a reasonable basis, only what is sufficient for you and your children.'\" (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5049; Muslim, 1714)\r\n\r\nCounter question: The Krishna Yajur Veda says:\r\n\r\nWomen are without energy. They should not get a share in the property. Even to the wicked, they speak in a feeble manner. [Krishna Yajur Veda vi. 5. 8. 2]\r\n\r\nA wife has no claim to property of her husband. The wealth that she earns is not her but her husband's. [Manu Smriti Chapter 8, Sholka 416]\r\n\r\nComment: Islam allows women to take money from their husband's wealth if he does not provide for her. If a woman is working, the money she earns is solely her's and the husband has no right on it. If she wants to give it to the husband she can and if she doesn't want to do so then it remains her's. However in Hinduism that's not the case. Even if SHE earns it by working hard, her husband gets to keep it.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAgniveer stated\r\n10. Quran [24:34] \"Force not your slave-girls to whoredom (prostitution) if they desire chastity, that you may seek enjoyment of this life. [And here's the freedom-to-pimp card:] But if anyone forces them, then after such compulsion, Allah is oft-forgiving.\"\r\nComments-\r\na. It means that there is no harm in forcing the slave girls to whoredom if they don't desire chastity!\r\nb. Prostitution according to this verse becomes legal if a girl has no problem. But on the other hand, Islamic scholars claim that Islam completely prohibits prostitution. If that be so, Allah and Muhammad (PBUH) will become anti Islamic for legalizing prostitution! \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nReply \r\n\r\n\r\nLet us understand why this verse was revealed\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nJabir reported that 'Abdullah b. Ubayy b. Salul used to say to his slavegirl: Go and fetch something for us by committing prostitution. \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIt was in this connection that Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, revealed this verse:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"And compel not your slave-girls to prostitution when they desire to keep chaste in order to seek the frail goods of this world's life, and whoever compels them, then surely after their compulsion Allah is Forgiving, Merciful\" (xxiv. 33).\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n[Sahih Muslim Book 43, Number 7180 Chapter 4: COMPEL NOT YOUR SLAVE-GIRLS TO PROSTITUTION]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIbn e Kathir says\r\nAmong the people of the Jahiliyyah, there were some who, if he had a slave-girl, he would send her out to commit Zina and would charge money for that, which he would take from her every time. When Islam came, Allah forbade the believers to do that. The reason why this Ayah was revealed, according to the reports of a number of earlier and later scholars of Tafsir, had to do with `Abdullah bin Ubayy bin Salul. He had slave-girls whom he used to force into prostitution so that he could take their earnings and because he wanted them to have children which would enhance his status, or so he claimed.(Commentary of Ibne Kathir 24:24)\r\n\r\nComment: The word 'force' is used because the slaves were forced to make money, However the ayah does not say that if they do not desire chastity then you are free to force them into prostitution.\r\n\r\nProstitution is prohibited. The Prophet peace be upon him said:\r\n\r\n\r\n«مَهْرُ الْبَغِيِّ خَبِيثٌ\r\n\r\n\r\n(The earnings of a prostitute are evil, (Mishkaat al Masabeeh hadeeth no: 2763,2764,2765)\r\n\r\n\r\n'Abd-Allaah ibn Maghfal reported that there was a woman who had been a prostitute during the days of ignorance (before Islam). A man passed by her, or she passed by him, and he touched her. She said: \"Stop it!. Allaah has done away with shirk and had brought Islam.\" So he left her alone and went away. (Reported by al-Haakim, who said this hadeeth is saheeh according to the conditions of Muslim, although they did not report it).\r\n\r\nAbove ahadeeth clarify that prostitution is prohibited.\r\nCounter Question: A girl without a brother is called Abhratr and it is prohibited to marry such a girl.\r\n\r\nThe Atharva Ved says, Those maidens there, the veins, who run their course in robes of ruddy hue, must now stand quiet, reft of power, like sisters who are brotherless. [Atharva Ved Kaand 1, Sookt 17, Mantra 1]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExplaining this, Nirukt, which is the oldest Indian treatise on Etymology, Philology and Semantics, says,\r\n\r\nThey stand like women who have no brother, and whose path is obstructed with regard to procreation and the offering of the sacrificial cake. With these words the simile implies the prohibition of marrying a brotherless maiden.[Nirukt 3:4]\r\n\r\nComment: Islam has place for a prostitute who has repented and she can marry an honourable man. However, Hinduism takes away the right of a woman to marry if she does not have a brother.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSlave women to be gifted as per Vedas: Two wagon-teams, with damsels, twenty oxen, O Agni, Abhydvartin Cayamdna, The liberal Sovran, giveth me.

Quran [24:6] \"And for those who launch a charge against their wives, accusing them, but have no witnesses or evidence, except themselves; let the testimony of one of them be four testimonies, (swearing four times) by Allah that he is the one speaking the truth.\"\r\nComments-\r\na. Great, so by swearing four times, man can make woman undergo punishments starting from lashes to stoning to death.\r\nb. But what will happen if wife too swears 8 times (since testimony of one man is equal to testimonies of 2 women) that she has not committed sin? In this balanced situation, who will be accused of telling lie?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReply\r\nLet us go throught the context of The Noble Qur'an - An-Nur 24:4-9\r\n[024:004] And those who launch a charge against chaste women, and produce not four witnesses (to support their allegations),- flog them with eighty stripes; and reject their evidence ever after: for such men are wicked transgressors;-\r\n[024:005] Unless they repent thereafter and mend (their conduct); for God is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.\r\n[024:006] And for those who launch a charge against their spouses, and have (in support) no evidence but their own,- their solitary evidence (can be received) if they bear witness four times (with an oath) by God that they are solemnly telling the truth;\r\n[024:007] And the fifth (oath) (should be) that they solemnly invoke the curse of God on themselves if they tell a lie.\r\n[024:008] But it would avert the punishment from the wife, if she bears witness four times (with an oath) By God, that (her husband) is telling a lie;\r\n[024:009] And the fifth (oath) should be that she solemnly invokes the wrath of God on herself if (her accuser) is telling the truth.\r\nAllah also says\r\n[024:023] Those who slander chaste women, indiscreet but believing, are cursed in this life and in the Hereafter: for them is a grievous Penalty,-\r\n[024:024] On the Day when their tongues, their hands, and their feet will bear witness against them as to their actions.\r\n\r\nThe Prophet said: \"Avoid the seven great destructive sins.\" They (the people) asked, \"O Allah's Messenger!

Islam says that everyone's fate has already been written in a gigantic book called Lohe Mehfooz by Allah [Please refer to our article-\"Helpless Destiny in Islam\" on this website to know more].

The Prophet (Peace be upon him) gave instructions in this regard three times but with negative response. He told his wife Umm Salamah about this attitude of his Companions. She advised that he himself take the initiative, slaughter his animal and have his head shaved. Seeing that, the Muslims, with rended hearts, started to slaughter their animals and shave their heads. They even almost killed one another because of their distress. The Prophet (Peace be upon him) prayed three times for those who shaved their heads and once for those who cut their hair... (Sealed Nectar by Shaykh Safi ur Rahman Egnlish translation page 155)\r\n\r\n\r\nComment: How beautiful was the advice of Umm Salmah (RA)!

Mullahs argue that one can kill her wife according to this verse only when he produces four witnesses in his support so that there cannot be any margin of error in the decision. But they forget that in Quran [24:6], Allah has said that even if man has no witness, if he swears 4 times, it will be sufficient proof of him to be truthful.

Look at the beauty of Islam.Even then it says, admonish them (first), (next), refuse to share their beds (In refusing to share the bed, even the husband is deprived), (and last) beat them lightly, if it is useful. Their rights upon you are that you should provide them with food and clothing in a fitting manner\" and even then the Islamic Scholars says that It is better not to hit.

He replied: Give them food what you have for yourself, and clothe them by which you clothe yourself, and do not beat them, and do not revile them. (Abu Dawud Book 11, Number 2139)\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAgniveer stated\r\n\r\n20. The prophet said, \"None of you should flog his wife as he flogs a slave and then have sexual intercourse with her in the last part of the day.\" [Bukhari Vol. 7, #132]\r\nComments- One can draw several conclusions from this hadith\r\na. Keeping slaves for sexual desires is justified in Islam.\r\nb. Beating slaves is permissible as per Muhammad.\r\nc. Wife should not be beaten as severely as a slave can be. (Thanks for Allah and Muhammad Ji for this mercy!)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReply\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Hatem al-Haj states in his article 'Concubines & Slavery The Islamic Position'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd for one who humiliates his slave by beating him or slapping him, the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said,\r\n\"من لَطَمَ مَمْلُوآَهُ أو ضَرَبَهُ فَكَفَّارَتُهُ أَنْ يُعْتِقَهُ\"\r\n\"He who slaps his slave or beats him, there is no expiation for this but to free him.\" (reported by Muslim).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause of the aforementioned examples of the divine and prophetic instructions regarding slavery, no other nation or religious group in the world treated slaves better than the Muslims did, and here are the testimonies of the non-Muslim historians and leaders regarding this very fact: (quotations from http:\/\/www.alislam. org\/slavery\/)\r\n\r\n\r\ni) On the attitude of Muslim master with his slaves, Will Durant says, \"...he handled them with a genial humanity that made their lot no worse - perhaps better, as more secure - than that of a factory worker in nineteenth-century Europe.\" http:\/\/www.alislam.org\/slavery\/3.htm#r21, Hurgronje C., Mohammedanism,(N.Y., 1916), p.128 as quoted by W. Durant, The Story of Civilization, vol.IV (N.Y., 1950), p. 209.\r\n\r\n\r\nii) At the end of the 18th century, Mouradgea d'Ohsson (a main source of information for the Western writers on the Ottoman empire) declared: \"There is perhaps no nation where the captives, the slaves, the very toilers in the galleys are better provided for or treated with more kindness than among the Muhammedans. \" http:\/\/www.alislam. org\/slavery\/3.htm#r22, As quoted in The Encyclopaedia of Islam, vol.I, p. 35.\r\n\r\n\r\niii) P. L Riviere writes: \"A master was enjoined to make his slave share the bounties he received from God. It must be recognised that, in this respect, the Islamic teaching acknowledged such a respect for human personality and showed a sense of equality which is searched for in vain in ancient civilization\" http:\/\/www.al-islam.org\/slavery\/3.htm#r23, Riviere P.L., Revue Bleaue (June 1939).\r\n\r\n\r\niv) Napoleon Bonaparte is recorded as saying about the condition of slaves in Muslim countries: \"The slave inherits his master's property and marries his daughter. The majority of the Pashas had been slaves. Many of the grand viziers, all the Mamelukes, Ali Ben Mourad Beg, had been slaves. They began their lives by performing the most menial services in the houses of their masters and were subsequently raised in status for their merit or by favour. In the West, on the contrary, the slave has always been below the position of the domestic servants; he occupies the lowest rug. The Romans emancipated their slaves, but the emancipated were never considered as equal to the free-born. The ideas of the East and West are so different that it took a long time to make the Egyptians understand that all the army was not composed of slaves belonging to the Sultan al-Kabir. \" http:\/\/www.al-islam.org\/slavery\/3.htm#r25, Bonaparte et l'Islam (Paris, 1914)....\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Hatem al-Haj further goes on\r\n• The families are not disrupted in the Islamic wars.\r\n• The captives are usually returned as a show of kindness, exchanged for Muslim captives or money.\r\n• In the case they were taken as slave women, they were taken by one man.\r\nThey were considered legitimate partners with rights guaranteed for them and their offspring who were treated exactly like the man's other children.\r\nHow is that like the gang raping in the battlefield by scores of soldiers?\r\n• Such women were often freed and married their masters and if not, and had a child, they had a special status and became unsellable and became free upon the death of the master.\r\n• Such women prospered.\r\nThey bore and raised children who became khaleefas, sultans, princes, great leaders and scholars in the history of Islam.\r\nThat is an indication on how they were treated.\r\nSource: http:\/\/www.amjaonline.com\/en_d_details.php?id=285\r\n\r\n\r\nLastly A slave can be a leader:\r\n\r\n\r\na) Narrated Anas bin Malik: Allah's Apostle said, \"You should listen to and obey, your ruler even if he was an Ethiopian (black) slave whose head looks like a raisin.\" (Bukhari Book #89, Hadith #256)\r\n\r\n\r\nb) Abu Dharr reported: My friend (the Holy Prophet) bade me to hear and obey (the ruler) even if he is a slave having his feet and arms cut off, and observe prayer at its prescribed time. (And further said): It you find people having observed the prayer, you in fact saved your prayer, otherwise (if you join with them) that would be a Nafl prayer for you. (Muslim, Book #004, Hadith #1355)\r\n\r\n\r\nc) Narrated Jabir bin 'Abdullah: Umar used to say, \"Abu Bakr is our chief, and he manumitted our chief,\" meaning Bilal (he was a black slave and Abu baker manumitted him).

The Prophet (peace be upon him) was educating Muslims and prohibiting the act of beating, because it was common for people to beat their slaves. However, Islam stopped this practice. \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAgniveer stated:\r\n21. Muhammad said, \"Hang the whip up somewhere so that the people of the household might see it; it is discipline to them\" [The authentic of Al-Jami Al-Sagheer Wa Ziyadatuh, Al-Albani, vol. 2 p. 744]. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nReply\r\nThis hadith is regarding raising children.\r\n\r\n\r\nImam Al-Minaawi said: \"For a father to discipline his child when he reaches the age of discernment means that he should raise him with the characteristics of the righteous believers and protect him from mixing with evildoers; he should teach him the Qur'aan and good manners and the language of the Arabs, let him hear the Sunnah and the sayings of the Salaf and teach him the religious rulings that he cannot do without. He should warn him then smack him if he does not pray etc. That will be better for him than giving a saa' in charity, because if he teaches him properly, his actions will be among his ongoing charity, whereas the reward for a saa' of charity is limited, but that will last as long as the child lives. Discipline is the nourishment of the soul, and training it for the Hereafter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"O you who believe! Ward off yourselves and your families against a Fire (Hell)…\" [al-Tahreem 66:6]\r\n\r\n\r\nProtecting yourself and your family from it means reminding them of Hell. Discipline includes preaching, warning, threatening, smacking, detaining, giving and being kind. Disciplining one who is good and noble is different from disciplining one who is difficult and ignoble.[Fayd al-Qadeer, 5\/257]\r\n\r\n\r\nCommentary of Ibne Kathir says under 66:6\r\nThere is a Hadith that confirms the meaning of this Ayah. Ahmad, Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi recorded that Ar-Rabi` bin Sabrah said that his father said that the Messenger of Allah said,\r\n\r\n\r\n«مُرُوا الصَّبِيَّ بِالصَّلَاةِ إِذَا بَلَغَ سَبْعَ سِنِينَ، فَإِذَا بَلَغَ عَشْرَ سِنِينَ فَاضْرِبُوهُ عَلَيْهَا»\r\n\r\n\r\n(Order the children to pray when they reach the age of seven and when they reach the age of ten, discipline them for (not performing) it.) This is the narration that Abu Dawud collected; At-Tirmidhi said, \"This Hadith is Hasan.''\r\n\r\n\r\nIslamqa Fatwa no: 10016\r\nSo raising children should be a balance between encouragement and warning. The most important element of all is making the environment in which the children live a good one, by providing the means whereby they may be guided; this means that their educators should be religiously committed, including their parents. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nComment: Thus the context is clear and there is no problem in the hadeeth and Islamic law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAgniveer stated:\r\nWife, a sex slave of man! \r\n22. When a woman refuses to come to her husband's bed, angels curse her until she returns. (Bukhari, Book of Nikah 3:96)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReply\r\nThe phrase \"and he spends the night angry with her\" refers to the cause of the angels' curse, because this confirms that she is a sinner, which is a different matter than if he accepts her excuse and is not angry with her, or lets the matter drop. Is she to blame if he keeps her away from his bed? The answer is: no, unless she is the one who started the separation and he is keeping away from her because of it, and she did not apologize but prolonged the separation. But if he is the one who started it, and is thus treating her unfairly, then she is not to blame. In one report, instead of the words \"the angels curse her until morning,\" the wording is \"… until she returns\" – and this is a useful variant.\r\n\r\n\r\n(Adapted and abbreviated from the commentary by al-Haafiz Ibn Hijr – may Allaah have mercy on him – on this hadeeth in Fath al-Baari).\r\n\r\n\r\nComment: Islam makes a woman the 'Queen of the House' and gives her the responsibility of house affairs while man is made the manager of out-of-house matters. It's the man who is made responsible for financial matters and thus it is he who is to stay out of the home and earn for his family. So while out, he is more likely to come around any woman and this may cause some emotional upheaval within him.\r\n\r\n\r\nHoly Prophet (PBUH) said: \"When one of you sees a woman, he should come to his wife, for that will repel what he feels in his heart.\" (Sahih Muslim, Book of Marriage, Hadith 3240)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a very natural and rational solution to such a situation. If a man faces such a situation and his wife is denying him , it can cause serious problems especially when it becomes frequent. It is a known fact that men have less power to control their desire. It is for this reason that the Holy Prophet (PBUH) gave such a commandment.\r\n\r\n\r\nIslam leaves no option for men and women to fulfill their desires except their spouses. The Quran says about the husband wife relation:\r\n\"They are your garments and ye are their garments.\"{Surah Al-Baqarah 2:187}\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Prophet (peace be upon him) said \"None of you should fall upon his wife like an animal\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAllah says: O ye who believe! Ye are forbidden to inherit women against their will. Nor should ye treat them with harshness, that ye may take away part of the dower [money given by the husband to the wife for the marriage contract] ye have given them, except where they have been guilty of open lewdness;on the contrary live with them on a footing of kindness and equity. If ye take a dislike to them it may be that ye dislike a thing, and God brings about through it a great deal of good (Qu'ran An-nisa 19)\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was narrated from 'Abd-Allaah ibn 'Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \"When the wife of any one of you asks for permission to go to the mosque, do not forbid her.\" Narrated by al-Bukhaari (4940) and Muslim (442).\r\n\r\n\r\nShaykh Salih al Munajjid said while commenting the hadith provided by agniveer\r\nAt the same time, the husband must show consideration towards his wife if she is sick, pregnant or depressed, so as to maintain harmony and prevent discontent or hatred.[Muharamat, Prohibitions that are taken too lightly, Chapter Not allowing one's husband to have marital relations for no legitimate reason, English Translation Book by Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid]\r\n\r\n\r\nAl-Bahooti (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:The husband has the right to enjoy his wife at any time, so long as that does not keep her from performing obligatory duties or harm her; he does not have the right to enjoy her in that case, because that is not part of living with them honourably. But if it does not distract her from that or cause her harm, then he has the right to enjoyment. End quote from Kashshaaf al-Qinaa' (5\/189).\r\n\r\n\r\nComment: I don't know why Agniveer is trying to make fights between husband and wife.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAgniveer stated\r\n23. I swear to my lord, a woman cannot fulfil the obligation of her Lord until she has fulfilled the obligation of her husband, and even if he calls her for sex while she is on the back of a camel, she would never refuse him\". (See: The authentic of Ibn Dawood' collection, Al-Albani, vol. 2 p.121).\r\nComments-\r\na. Till now we were aware of just one agent of Allah for mankind, but now, every man is the agent of Allah for his wives. This is a Shirk as per Islamic belief of praising anyone other than Allah.\r\nb. Very interesting thing regarding this hadith is that it not only teaches Shirk with respect to Allah but also with respect to Prophet Muhammad by appointing the husbands as new prophets for wives! \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReply\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Ibn Dawood? This is Translation and authentic reference \r\n\r\n\r\nوالذي نفس محمد بيده لا تؤدي المرأة حق ربها حتى تؤدي حق زوجها ولو سألها نفسها وهي على قتب لم تمنعه\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the One in Whose hand is the soul of Muhammad, no woman will fulfill her duty towards her Lord unless she fulfils her duty towards her husband, and if he asks her for herself when she is sitting on a saddle, she should not refuse him [Hadeeth reported by Ibn Maajah, 1843; see also Saheeh al-Jaami', 5239, 5295]\r\n\r\nBelow is an extract from the fatwa by Shaykh Salih al Munajjid in IslamQa fatwa no: 4601\r\n\r\nBoth husband and wife should submit themselves to the laws of Allaah, because this is where happiness lies. \r\n\r\n\r\nAllaah says \"… And they (women) have rights (over their husbands as regards living expenses, etc.) similar (to those of their husbands) over them (as regards obedience and respect, etc.) to what is reasonable…\" [al-Baqarah 2:228]\r\n\r\n\r\nSo both spouses must treat the other kindly. Marriage is based on love, not on defiance or provocation, because these usually occur between enemies, and if they happen between people who love one another, they usually cause hatred and do the couple no good.\r\n\r\n\r\nAllaah says \"And among His Signs is this, that He created for you wives from among yourselves, that you may find repose in them, and He has put between you affection and mercy…\" [al-Room 30:21]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n'Abd al-Rahmaan ibn 'Awf said: \"The Messenger of Allaah SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 'If a woman prays her five (daily prayers), fasts her month (Ramadaan), guards her modesty and obeys her husband, it will be said to her, \"Enter Paradise through whichever gate of Paradise you wish.\" (Reported by Imaam Ahmad, 1573; Saheeh al-Jaami', 660).\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the wife obeys her husband and treats him well for the sake of Allaah, she will earn a great reward with Allaah. By the same token, the man has to be patient with her, treat her well, win her over and teach her what his shar'i rights over her are.(end quote)\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAgniveer stated\r\n24.

Once, Muhammad saw a woman, and so he came to his wife, Zainab, as she was tanning leather and had sexual intercourse with her. He then went to his Companions and told them: The woman advances and retires in the shape of a devil, so when one of you sees a woman, he should come to his wife, for that will repel what he feels in his heart. [Muslim, Book #008, Hadith #3240]\r\nComments-\r\na. According to Islam, wife is no more than a servant, who should be ready every time to get engaged sexually with her husband, even if she is busy with her own work.\r\nb. Does woman has same facility of going to her husband in the same manner if she sees a man?\r\nc. The solution to the problem of \"seeing the woman\" provided by Muhammad involves seeing the woman (wife) again. This will lead to an endless process of engagement of a man into sexual practices with his wife forever!\r\nd. What do muslims do when they see their mothers, sisters, or daughters? Do they still go to their wives after seeing their mothers and sisters?\r\ne. If mother and sisters are given respect and they do not fall under the category of those women, then why not consider every woman a mother or sister except your wife, as written in Vedas?\r\nf.

Yes, in religious terms, all Muslims are our brothers and Sisters, But that does not make them real sisters (Who are our mahrum i.e to whom we can not marry). If agniveer considers every girl as a mother then can we say hindus consider their wives to be their mothers before marriage? And then they wed their own mother? This is a weird concept.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAgniveer stated:\r\n26. A Muslim with two wives offered a fellow Muslim his pick between the two. Muhammad then arranged a wedding banquet. [Bukhari (58:125)]\r\nComments-\r\na. I think, equality for women in Islam means their equal distribution among men!\r\nb. Some scholars argue that this was the act of men, and we can't judge Islam through its followers, but we should judge it through Prophet. Well, Muhammad arranged the marriage banquet for this marriage and this picking process was followed under the guidance of none other than Muhammad! It shows that Muhammad was fully convinced with this act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReply:\r\n\r\n\r\nThe name of Sahabi is Abdur-Rahman bin 'Auf and he was an emigrant from Makkah and he had nothing with himself, Sad bin Ar-Rabi' who was a rich man provided him full support with money, food and he said \"The Ansar know that I am the richest of all of them, so I will divide my property into two parts between me and you, and I have two wives; see which of the two you like so that I may divorce her and you can marry her after she becomes lawful to you by her passing the prescribed period (i.e. 'Idda) of divorce. 'Abdur Rahman said, \"May Allah bless you your family (i.e. wives) for you.\" (But 'Abdur-Rahman went to the market) and did not return on that day except with some gain of dried yogurt and butter. He went on trading just a few days till he came to Allah's Apostle bearing the traces of yellow scent over his clothes. Allah's Apostle asked him, \"What is this scent?\" He replied, \"I have married a woman from the Ansar.\" Allah's Apostle asked, \"How much Mahr have you given?\" He said, \"A date-stone weight of gold or a golden date-stone.\" The Prophet said, \"Arrange a marriage banquet even with a sheep.\"[Bukhari Volume 5, Book 58, Number 125]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nComment: This hadith as agniveer claimed is regarding women but in fact it is regarding the love of a rich man with a poor man who was an emigrant of makkah. Agniveer has drawn the conclusion based on his assumption that the sahaba married one of the two wives of the other sahaba.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAgniveer stated\r\n27. The Prophet said: \"The stipulations most entitled to be abided by are those with which you are given the right to enjoy the (women's) private parts. [Bukhari (62:81)]\r\nComments-\r\nI don't want to comment on this hadith, since there is a limit to which, one can be shameless.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReply\r\n\r\n\r\nThis hadith is regarding the stipulations of marriage. The Prophet (peace be upon him) is ordering the men not to leave one's wife but to be with them. It is the right of the husband as well as the wifes to enjoy the married life. Maybe in Hinduism there are no rules and regulations regarding the life of husband and wife, that's why agniveer finds this shameful. \r\n\r\n\r\nIt is mentioned in Commentary of Bukhari by Shaykh Mohammad Dawud Raz that it is obligatory on men to fulfil the stipulations he made while marrying that hewill not marry an other woman.(end quote)\r\n\r\n\r\nHe also said: \"(Husband should) fulfil Each and every stipulation because hadith is clear except those which are aginst Qur`an and Sunnah) Commentary of Bukhari by Muhammad Dawud Raz Vol 4 page 193 checked by Shaykh Abdus Salam bastawi and Abdul Jabbar Salafi)\r\n\r\n\r\nComment: So generally this hadith is regarding stipulations.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAgniveer stated\r\nDivorce and women rights\r\nQuran contains the word divorce almost 17 times and interestingly, not even a single time, this word has been used to command women! Everywhere in Quran, Allah only talks with men about what you should do and what you should not do while divorcing women. This phenomenon of instructing one gender and ignoring other proves that Quran has no provision for women to divorce if they wish. Quran is the biggest slap on the faces of the likes of Zakir Naik, who foolishly claim Islam to be the only fair religion in terms of women rights. Let's analyze few verses from Quran and explore the dirty game behind divorce.\r\n28. Divorced women shall wait concerning themselves for three monthly periods. Nor is it lawful for them to hide what Allah Hath created in their wombs, if they have faith in Allah and the Last Day. And their husbands have the better right to take them back in that period, if they wish for reconciliation. [Quran, 2:228]\r\nComments-\r\nAll muslim scholars use this verse to prove that Islam has provision to get a couple reunited even if they have divorced. But they forget to mention that it is the husband, who has right to take wife back and not the wife with the right to take her husband back. In fact wife is not in a picture at all while taking any decision, rather she is just an object, which can be accepted or rejected as per the convenience of husband.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReply\r\n\r\n\r\nLeave aside Agniveer's bad language against Muslims let us see the hadith\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n عَنِ ابْنِ عُمَرَ رَضِيَ اللَّهُ عَنْهُمَا ، أَنَّ رَسُولَ اللهِ صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ قَالَ: إِنَّ أَعْظَمَ الذُّنُوبِ عِنْدَ اللهِ رَجُلٌ تَزَوَّجَ امْرَأَةً ، فَلَمَّا قَضَى حَاجَتَهُ مِنْهَا ، طَلَّقَهَا ، وَذَهَبَ بِمَهْرِهَا ، وَرَجُلٌ اسْتَعْمَلَ رَجُلاً ، فَذَهَبَ بِأُجْرَتِهِ ، وَآخَرُ يَقْتُلُ دَابَّةً عَبَثًا.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nNarrated by Ibn Umar ra that Prophet peace be upon him said: It is one of the GREATEST SIN in the sight of Allah that a man marries a woman and when he finish his needs from her, he divorce her and do not giver her  Mahr [Mustadrak al Haakim 2\/198, alAlbani ra authenticated in Silsilah as-Saheeha no. 999]\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThis answer his false claim but see commentary of Ibne Kathir\r\n\r\n\r\nThis Ayah contains a command from Allah that the divorced woman, whose marriage was consummated and who still has menstruation periods, should wait for three (menstrual) periods (Quru') after the divorce and then remarry if she wishes.(he went on and said) Hence, the husband who divorces his wife can take her back, providing she is still in her `Iddah (time spent before a divorced woman or a widow can remarry) and that his aim, by taking her back, is righteous and for the purpose of bringing things back to normal. However, this ruling applies where the husband is eligible to take his divorced wife back. We should mention that (when this Ayah 2:228 was revealed), the ruling that made the divorce thrice and specified when the husband is ineligible to take his divorced wife back, had not been revealed yet. Previously, the man used to divorce his wife and then take her back even if he had divorced her a hundred separate times. Thereafter, Allah revealed the following Ayah (2:229) that made the divorce only thrice. So there was now a reversible divorce and an irreversible final divorce.(end quote)\r\n\r\nComment: Islam made the divorce thrice to prevent husbands to irritate their wives again and again. Secondly, little knowledge is always harmul. There is something like khula in Islam. If a Woman does not like her Husband she can leave him or if the marriage is against her will she can leave her husband.\r\n\r\nProof:1 Allah says: \"If a wife fears cruelty or desertion on her husband's part, there is no blame on them if they arrange an amicable settlement between themselves; and such settlement is best; even though men's souls are swayed by greed. But if ye do good and practise self-restraint, God is well-acquainted with all that ye do. (The Noble Quran, 4:128)\"\r\n\r\n\r\nProof 2: Narrated Al-Qasim: A woman from the offspring of Ja'far was afraid lest her guardian marry her (to somebody) against her will. So she sent for two elderly men from the Ansar, 'AbdurRahman and Mujammi', the two sons of Jariya, and they said to her, \"Don't be afraid, for Khansa' bint Khidam was given by her father in marriage against her will, then the Prophet cancelled that marriage.\" (Bukhari Book #86, Hadith #99)\r\n\r\n\r\nProof 3: Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas: A virgin came to the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) and mentioned that her father had married her against her will, so the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) allowed her to exercise her choice. (Abu Dawud Book #11, Hadith #2091) (It is mentioned in Awn Al Mabood Commentary of Abu Dawud \"This hadith is powerful Hasan\")\r\n\r\nComment: The lie of agniveer is exposed when he said \"she is just an object which can be accepted and rejected\"\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAgniveer stated:\r\n29. So if a husband divorces his wife, He cannot, after that, remarry her until after she has married another husband and He has divorced her. [Quran, 2:230]\r\nComments-\r\nOne can see the status of woman in Islam, which is no more than a football, nothing to decide for herself, roaming around as per the directions given by men and bound to undergo such inhumane customs. Hadiths and tafseers make amply clear that mere marriage to another husband does not suffice. The wife must have sexual relation with new husband, and only then can she think of returning to original husband after giving the new husband divorce!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReply\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is already proven that Woman can decide regarding her husband that to live with him or to leave him with valid reasons, Keeping a side his bad comments let us see the main theme of his accusation, he quoted 2:230, In Islam marriage is not the game of toys, so that you can give divorce and marry again, give divorce and marry again, i already quoted Ibne Kathir \"Previously, the man used to divorce his wife and then take her back even if he had divorced her a hundred separate times. Thereafter, Allah revealed the following Ayah (2:229) that made the divorce only thrice. So there was now a reversible divorce and an irreversible final divorce\"(end quote)\r\nDivorcing women three times in one sitting is Prohibited,\r\nsee the proof \r\nMahmood bin Lubayd (ra) narrates that the Prophet (Peace be upon him) was informed that a man divorced his wife with three pronouncements all-together, at this (The Prophet) became very angry, he stood up and said: Is the book of Allah being mocked at in my presence? Until one person stood and said O Allah's Apostle should I not kill him? [Sunnan Nasai'i, Volume No. 2, Page No. 181]\r\n2ndly There is no Divorce in intense Anger, Proof for this is Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \"There is no divorce and no freeing of slaves when it is done by force or in a state of intense anger.\" (Narrated by Ibn Maajah, 2046; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in al-Irwa', 2047)\r\n\r\nand lastly Nikah at Tehleel (pre-planned\/intentional Marriage that I will marry you and then I will divorce you after one or two nights is Prohibited and adultery), see the evidences here: http:\/\/www.islamqa.com\/en\/ref\/109245\/\r\nComment: In Islam the criteria is divorce is beautiful, a divorce will happen in three months, after that if she wants to marry again then with mutual consent they(husband and wife) can marry agin, if divorce happens again and after idda(prescribed period) both decide to marry again, they can marry gain but after that if they divorce third time then Qur`an says it is final you can not marry again unless woman marries other person (without making plan before marriage that I will divorce you after spending a night) and if he divorce her again by chance then she can marry previous husband again. see detail article here:\r\nhttp:\/\/www.systemoflife.com\/articles\/general\/203-the-issue-of-triple-talaq\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAgniveer stated:\r\n30. When ye divorce women, and they fulfill the term of their ['Iddat], either take them back on equitable terms or set them free. [Quran, 2:231]\r\nComments-\r\nWho are men to take or set women free? If men and women both have been given the similar rights, why this verse only talks of man setting free the women and not vice versa?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReply\r\nThis is full ayah\r\n(231. And when you have divorced women and they have fulfilled the term of their prescribed period, either take them back on a reasonable basis or set them free on a reasonable basis. But do not take them back to hurt them, and whoever does that, then he has wronged himself. And treat not the verses (Laws) of Allah in jest, but remember Allah's favors on you (i.e., Islam), and that which He has sent down to you of the Book (i.e., the Qur'an) and Al-Hikmah (the Prophet's Sunnah ـ legal ways ـ Islamic jurisprudence) whereby He instructs you. And fear Allah, and know that Allah is All-Aware of everything).\r\nIbne Kathir Commented: This is a command from Allah to men that when one of them divorces his wife with a reversible divorce, he should treat her kindly. So when her term of `Iddah (waiting period) nears its end, he either takes her back in a way that is better, including having witnesses that he has taken her back, and he lives with her with kindness. Or, he should release her after her `Iddah finishes and then kindly asks her to depart from his house, without disputing, fighting with her or using foul words. \r\n\r\n\r\nAllah then said: (But do not take them back to hurt them,)\r\nIbn `Abbas, Mujahid, Masruq, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak, Ar-Rabi` and Muqatil bin Hayyan said that a man used to divorce his wife, and when her `Iddah came near its end, he would take her back to harm her and to stop her from marrying someone else. He then divorced her and she would begin her `Iddah and when her `Iddah term neared its end, he would take her back again, so that the term of `Iddah would be prolonged for her. After that, Allah prohibited this practice. Allah has also threatened those who indulge in such practices, when He said;\r\n(...and whoever does that, then he has wronged himself.) meaning, by defying Allah's commandments.(end quoted)\r\n\r\nComment: Agniveer said who are men to take them back and set her free? The answer is simple i.e. he is husband of wife. Again why agniveer creating fight between husband and wife? When Quran is at its best that do not harm women and do not take them back so that you(men) may harm them(women), live with them honourably etc. Regarding husband and wife rights see the answer to introduction of agniveer at start of this article.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAgniveer stated:\r\n31. The mothers shall give such to their offspring for two whole years [after divorce], if the father desires to complete the term. But he shall bear the cost of their food and clothing. [Quran, 2:233]\r\nComments-\r\na. According to this verse, child will remain with father and not with mother after divorce.\r\nb. Mother can keep her baby only for two years [after divorce], that too with the permission of his father. One should not think that this 2 year program is because of sympathy for mother. In fact, this is the period, in which, a child needs breast feeding for his\/her growth. So mother is paid for this two year program and once, 2 years are over, mother is set free to go anywhere!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReply\r\nThis is the full verse [002:233] The mothers shall give suck to their children for two whole years, (that is) for those (parents) who desire to complete the term of suckling, but the father of the child shall bear the cost of the mothers food and clothing on a reasonable basis. No person shall have a burden laid on him greater than he can bear. No mother shall be treated unfairly on account of her child, nor father on account of his child. And on the (fathers) heir is incumbent the like of that (which was incumbent on the father). If they both decide on weaning, by mutual consent, and after due consultation, there is no sin on them. And if you decide on a foster suckling-mother for your children, there is no sin on you, provided you pay (the mother) what you agreed (to give her) on reasonable basis. And fear Allah and know that Allah is All-Seer of what you do.) Muhammad Al-Hilali & Muhsin Khan\r\nIbne Kathir Commented: Ad-Dahhak commented, \"If the husband divorces his wife, with whom he had a child, and she suckles that child, he is required to provide for the mother's expenses and clothes within reason.''\r\n\r\n\r\nAllah said: (No mother shall be treated unfairly on account of her child,) meaning, the mother should not decline to rear her child to harm its father. The mother does not have the right to refrain from suckling the child after giving birth, unless she suckles him\/her the milk that is necessary for his\/her survival. Later on, she is allowed to give up custody of the child as long as she does not do that intending to harm the father. In addition, the father is not allowed to take the child from his mother to harm the mother. This is why Allah said:\r\n(...nor father on account of his child.) meaning, by taking the child from its mother intending to harm the mother. This is the Tafsir of Mujahid, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak, Az-Zuhri, As-Suddi, Ath-Thawri and Ibn Zayd, and others on this Ayah.\r\n\r\n\r\nAllah then said: (And on the (father's) heir is incumbent the like of that (which was incumbent on the father).) meaning, by refraining from harming the relative (of the father, i.e., his infant), as Mujahid, Ash-Sha`bi and Ad-Dahhak stated.(end quote)\r\n\r\n\r\nIbne Kathir went on and said\r\n(And if you decide on a foster suckling-mother for your children, there is no sin on you, provided you pay (the mother) what you agreed (to give her) on a reasonable basis.) meaning, if the mother and the father both agree that the father assumes custody of the child due to a circumstance that compels her or allows him to do so, then there is no sin in this case. Hence, the mother is allowed to give up the child and the father is allowed to assume custody of the child. The father should kindly give the mother her expenses for the previous period (during which she reared and suckled the child), and he should seek other women to suckle his child for monetary compensation.(end quote)\r\n\r\n\r\nComment: One can see commentary of agniveer and commentary of Qur`an by sahaba and students of sahaba. By the way he left this very famous hadith, let me quote for him\r\nA Mother has 3 times more right over her children then the father\r\nProof: Saheeh Muslim Book 032, Number 6180:.Abu Huraira reported that a person came to Allah, 's Messenger (may peace be upon him) and said: Who among the people is most deserving of a fine treatment from my hand? He said: Your mother. He again said: Then who (is the next one)? He said: Again it is your mother (who deserves the best treatment from you). He said: Then who (is the next one)? He (the Holy Prophet) said: Again, it is your mother. He (again) said: Then who? Thereupon he said: Then it is your father\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAgniveer stated:\r\n32. There is no blame on you if ye divorce women before consummation or the fixation of their dower. [Quran, 2:236]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReply\r\nSo what is the point in quoting this verse? See translation by Muhammad Al-Hilali & Muhsin Khan [002:236] There is no sin on you, if you divorce women while yet you have not touched (had sexual relation with) them, nor appointed unto them their Mahr (bridal money given by the husband to his wife at the time of marriage). But bestow on them ( a suitable gift), the rich according to his means, and the poor according to his means, a gift of reasonable amount is a duty on the doers of good.\r\nComment: There is nothing wrong in above ayah (or in any of the ayah)\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAgniveer stated:\r\n33. Muhammad said: If any woman asks her husband for divorce without some strong reason, the odour of Paradise will be forbidden to her. (Book #12, Hadith #2218)\r\nComments-\r\na. Another hadith exposing the equal rights of women. Man can divorce a woman by saying \"Talaaq\", three times and wife cannot do anything but to go somewhere else in that case. If she is pregnant, she can be appointed by her husband as feeding machine for the coming baby. However, if husband does not want to feed his baby by his\/her mother, she will be set free whenever husband wishes!\r\nb. On the other hand, if a woman wants to divorce her husband, she has to prove in the Islamic court with all the evidences and proofs that she has genuine reasons for her desire.\r\nc. Most of the times, woman fails to get divorce as per her wish, since her testimony is considered half than that of man. And if man does not want to give divorce, there is hardly any chance of getting it. In addition to this, woman is abused by her husband, physically and mentally in reply to the attempts made by her against his will. And needless to say, the everlasting fire of hell is ready for her for not satisfying husband!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReply\r\n\r\n\r\nThis Rule is also for men\r\n\r\n\r\n عَنِ ابْنِ عُمَرَ رَضِيَ اللَّهُ عَنْهُمَا ، أَنَّ رَسُولَ اللهِ صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ قَالَ: إِنَّ أَعْظَمَ الذُّنُوبِ عِنْدَ اللهِ رَجُلٌ تَزَوَّجَ امْرَأَةً ، فَلَمَّا قَضَى حَاجَتَهُ مِنْهَا ، طَلَّقَهَا ، وَذَهَبَ بِمَهْرِهَا ، وَرَجُلٌ اسْتَعْمَلَ رَجُلاً ، فَذَهَبَ بِأُجْرَتِهِ ، وَآخَرُ يَقْتُلُ دَابَّةً عَبَثًا.\r\n\r\n\r\nNarrated by Ibn Umar ra that Prophet peace be upon him said: It is one of the GREAT SIN in the sight of Allah that a man marries a woman and when he finish his needs from her, he divorce her and do not giver her  Mahr [Mustadrak al Haakim 2\/198, alAlbani ra authenticated in Silsilah as-Saheeha no. 999]\r\n\r\n\r\n قال  \r\n\r\n\r\nأبو سلمة ( يعني : سليمان بن سليم ) : و حدثت بهذا الحديث العلاء بن سفيان  \r\n\r\n\r\nالغساني , فقال : لقد بلغني : أن من الفواحش التي حرم الله مما بطن , مما لم  \r\n\r\n\r\nيتبين ذكرها في القرآن : أن يتزوج الرجل المرأة , فإذا تقادم صحبتها , و طال  \r\n\r\n\r\nعهدها , و نفضت ما في بطنها , طلقها من غير ريبة . قلت : و هذا إسناد صحيح متصل  \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAbu Salmah said I narrated this hadeeth to al-Ala bin Sufyaan al-Ghassanee who said:\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n'Indeed it has reached me that from the evil hidden sins which Allaah has made Haraam, which are not clearly mentioned in the Qur'aan, are that a man marries a woman and when his companion becomes old and she has  stayed with him for a long time, and has produced all that her womb can, then he divorces her without any reason to do so.'\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nShaykh Albaani mentions:\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n'It is collected by Tabarani in 'al-Mu'jam al-Kabeer', Ibn 'Aasakir in 'Tareekh Dimishq'. And this Isnad is Saheeh.' [Silsilah Saheehah No.2871]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShaykh Salih Al Munajjid said\r\n\r\n\r\nMany women hasten to demand a divorce from their husbands for the least little argument, or if their husbands do not give them what they want of money. Some women may be egged on by troublemakers among their relatives or neighbours to challenge their husbands with provocative words such as: \"If you were a real man, you would divorce me!\" The dire results of divorce are well known: breakdown of the family and children roaming the streets. A person may come to regret divorce when it is too late. For all these reasons and others, the Sharee'ah wisely prohibited such actions. Thawbaan (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \"Any woman who asks her husband for a divorce with no sound reason will be deprived of smelling the fragrance of Paradise.\" (Reported by Ahmad, 5.277; see also Saheeh al-Jaami', 2703).\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n'Uqbah ibn 'Aamir (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \"Woman who ask for divorce and women who contend unnecessarily with their husbands are hypocrites.\"(Reported by al-Tabaraani in al-Kabeer, 17\/339; see also Saheeh al-Jaami', 1934). But if there is a sound reason, such as the husband abandoning prayer, drinking or taking drugs, or forcing his wife to do something haraam, or oppressing her and making her suffer by denying her the rights granted to her by Islaam, and he does not listen to advice to mend his ways, then in this case there is nothing wrong with a woman seeking divorce for her own sake and for the sake of her religion.[Muharamat Prohibitions that are taken too lightly, Chapter Asking one's husband for a divorce for no legitimate reason, English Translation Book by Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid]\r\nComment: Again Husband and wife have to take care and listen to each other, In whole of the article Agniveer tried to create disputes between husband and wife.\r\n\r\nSee also\r\na) http:\/\/www.answering-christianity.com\/divorce_abuse.htm\r\nb) http:\/\/www.zawaj.com\/articles\/divorce_laws.html\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAgniveer stated:\r\nIslam and Hijab\r\nAs per Islamic scriptures, women should have hijab – cover their entire body except parts of face. Likes of Zakir Naik argue that this is to protect chastity of Muslim women. We have already seen how Islam prevents their chastity and dignity in last few articles. One agrees that nudity and reckless display of body to attract attention is as abhorrent as caging a woman in such clothes that deprive her of Vitamic D and make Muslim women patients of bone deficiencies. However, the reason behind such restrictions was not any concern for modesty of women from those who permit sex-slaves and polygamy. The real reason is provided in Al-Tabari and hadiths.\r\nMuhammad once went to his (adopted!) son's home and saw his daughter-in-law (Zainab) in nude. This afflicted his heart and he forced Zaid, his son, to divorce Zainab and then married her. (In fact he did not even marry. He just kept her with him and claimed that their marriage happened in sky!). This opened a Pandora's box. He was now scared that other men may also see his wives' in revealing clothes and may run after them. So once, after he heard some news about his wives going for toilet in open, he immediately revealed Ayats that Muslim women should cover themselves completely.\r\nHad this Ayat been revealed before Muhammad saw Zainab in nude, it would have saved the man from such a big disgrace of getting physical with one's own daughter-in-law!\r\nAnd that has made matters worse for Muslim women! They cannot trust anyone as brothers or fatherly figures. They are at mercy of their husbands who can divorce them at will. Even the Qazi cannot force a husband from divorcing his wife, if he has decided so. And once the husband divorces, even father-in-law can marry the isolated woman, or keep her as a sex-slave!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReply\r\nAbove is nothing but a blatant lie, I Challenge him to quote the chain of the hadeeth with authentications plus authentic reference, Otherwise he is already proven liar before and we will prove him liar again and again INSHA`ALLAH, see what actually happened regarding Marriage of Zainab Ra\r\na) http:\/\/www.systemoflife.com\/answering-islamophobes\/abul-kasem\/220-refuting-muhammad-kept-his-daughterin-law-without-marriage\r\nand regarding Vitamin argument see the reply here: b) http:\/\/islamqa.com\/en\/ref\/146329\/\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAgniveer stated:\r\nAny woman planning to marry a Muslim should know very clearly that -\r\na.

Dayanand had not only accepted the prevalence of 'Niyog' but also on the basic of 'smritis' (codes of traditional Hindu laws), discussed 'Niyog' in great detail in the language of the 'Veda mantras' (Vedic hymns). According to him there was a law that a woman or a man could have sexual intercourse with eleven persons. If no child was born from the one, then a woman could go to another. If even then she was unable to beget a child, then she could go to the third and so on till she had intercourse with eleven men (Dayanand's commentary on Rig Veda, 10\/85\/45).\r\n\r\nWoman was sometimes even forced to have sexual intercourse with men in the custom of 'Niyog'. 'Devtas, Rishis, Munis' and 'Brahmins' used to participate in 'Niyog' (see 'Mahabharata Aadi Parv; chapters 64,95,103, 104).\r\n\r\nComment: So a woman or a man could have sexual intercourse with eleven persons.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAgniveer stated:\r\n\r\nh. If she is marrying a Shia, she should also be prepared to Mutah – where her husband is permitted to marry any women for an hour, day, month etc, have sex with her to his satisfaction and then discontinue the marriage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReply:\r\nMutah is Prohibited\r\nhttp:\/\/www.systemoflife.com\/answering-islamophobes\/abul-kasem\/222-refuting-prophet-muhammad-approved-prostitution\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAgniveer stated:\r\ni. She has no rights to take divorce. She can at best request, but if the husband refuses, she has simply no options.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReply\r\nAgain see the divorce section of this article.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAgniveer stated:\r\nAnd finally after all this, Muhammad claims that he hardly sees any woman from earth in Paradise and sees Hell to be full with women!\r\nNow even the court has also come up with a ruling that a girl has to convert necessarily before marrying a Muslim. So you have no escape. If you aspire to marry a Muslim man, do only at cost of your dignity, self-respect, freedom and basic rights. Do only if you think Jehadi Love is more important than even most basic dignity of life!\r\nThink before you leap in Hell!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReply:\r\nRefutation VII: Fewer seats for women in Allah's Paradise\r\nhttp:\/\/www.systemoflife.com\/answering-islamophobes\/answering-islam-website\/211-fewer-seats-for-women-in-allahs-paradise\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAgniveer stated:\r\nAddendum:\r\nIf one looks at the Vedic concept of marriage, amply reflected (though not fully) in Hindu Marriage laws:\r\na. The rights are equal for husband and wife.\r\nb. If one beats her wife, and wife complains, the husband has to face jail.\r\nc. Divorce is not unilateral. Both husband and wife are on same footing. A woman has rights to reject her husband if he commits adultery or indulged in nefarious acts.\r\nd. Polygamy and adultery(temporary or permanent) are illegal and not acceptable.\r\ne. There is no dress constraint, except that one should not wear a dress that attracts immoral attention.\r\nf. Property rights are equal.\r\ng. Rape cases reply primarily on victim's witness and one is not expected to bring 2 live spectators.\r\nh. Any denigration of women is against Vedas and demand strictest punishments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReply:\r\nHe is talking about without evidence like an atheist who has no scripture to follow, But let us give him references of Vedas.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAgniveer stated\r\nDear Sister, in case, you are indeed resolved to marry a person, make sure he converts to Hinduism, rather than you converting to Islam. \r\nIf indeed he loves you, he will readily agree because it is win-win situation for both partners. In case he does not, reject it. Understand that you have been a victim of love jehad. Burn the past and look ahead. It happened to you, because you ignored the tenets of our culture and were misled by fraud environment all around. But better late than never.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReply\r\nHis frustration is clear, Alhumdulillah more women are accepting Islam then men, The more Islamophobics are doing propaganda, the more women are accepting. So keep doing this act and invite women to Islam, Thank you agniveer.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAgniveer stated:\r\nDear Sister, in case, you already made a blunder and became a Muslim to marry a Muslim, not all is lost.\r\nInsist your husband that both of you convert to Hinduism. This would be win-win for both of you. In case he refuses to, again understand that you have been a victim of love-jehad. Be strong, know your roots, have faith in Ishwar, take divorce from your husband and start afresh. Do so even if you have children. This will save their future.\r\nIn case he plans to relocate to a Muslim country, hurry up! Once you leave a non-Muslim country, the ball will no more remain in your court. You shall be doomed. In case you have already relocated, remain tactfully silent, keep him in good humor, convince him to come to India or any non-Muslim country, even for a short break. And once you are in a non-Muslim country, assert your right to dignity. Ask him to either convert or divorce. Make sure you have carried all your papers, in case you need to fight a legal battle.\r\nDivorce may not be easy due to anti-women Islamic laws, but if you live in India or a non-Muslim country, you can still wriggle out through court-battles on pretext of your Fundamental Right to profess any religion. It may be a hard pill to swallow, but the only one to save you and your future generations from ignominy. Remember, dignity and self-respect are far above any short-term conveniences.\r\nWelcome to Vedic dharma and live the life you aspire for – devoid of inequality and discrimination!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReply\r\nAbove is nothing more then blah blah!\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAgniveer stated:\r\nDear Sister, if you have been born as a Muslim woman and have married\/ about to marry a Muslim:\r\nConvince your husband\/ would-be to convert and become Hindus. You will find huge number of articles on agniveer.com on why you should do so. But more importantly, as a woman, you would be able to live with head held high and with dignity. You would have equal rights and no discrimination compared to men. If your husband\/ would-be indeed loves you, if would be only more than happy to gift you such pride and right to live with dignity.\r\nSo take that bold step, and embrace the Vedic dharma. Reject the cult of the barbaric who dehumanize women!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReply\r\n\r\nNo comments!\r\nIt is nothing but begging, lastly I want to quote Few verses from Veda\r\nIn the Vedas wherever special prayers have been made for children, they have always been for sons. Nowhere is a prayer or charm recited to be granted a daughter. For exmaple,\r\n\r\n1. O Bounteous Indra, make this bride blest in her sons and fortunate. Vouchsafe to her ten sons, and make her husband the eleventh man. [Rigved Mandal 10, Sookt 85, Mantra 45]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. This is thy Soma draught, O bright Âditya: take delight therein. To this mine utterance, O ye men, give credence, what good the man and wife obtain by praying: A manly son is born and gathers riches, and thrives for ever sinless in the dwelling. [Yajurved Adhyay 8, Mantra 5]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Fathers, bestow on me a babe, a boy enwreathed with lotuses, so that there may be here a man. [Yajurved Adhyay 2, Mantra 33]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll prayers are for being granted a boy and none for a girl.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of marriage Swami Dayanad Saraswati says,\r\n\r\n\"In Sanskrit a daughter is called duhitri (from Du - distant, Hit - good), because the marriage of a girl to a man who comes from a distant country or distant part of the same country is productive of good.\r\n\r\n\"If the bride's people do not live very far from her husband's home, there is a possibility of her parents becoming poor, as whenever she visits her parents, they will have to give her something or other by the way of a present.\" [Satyarth Prakash Chapter 4, The advantages and disadvantages of distant and near marriages, Page 85]\r\n\r\nSee the article by Brother Mushafiq Sultan Women and the Vedic Dharma http:\/\/www.islamhinduism.com\/responses\/answering-agniveer\/29-women-and-the-vedic-dharma\r\n\r\n\r\nInshaAllah Read more: http:\/\/www.systemoflife.com\/answering-islamophobes\/agniveer\/278-refutation-of-muslim-wife-or-concubine#ixzz3du8jo2mi\r\n","publisher":{"@id":"#Publisher","@type":"Organization","name":"VedKaBhed.Com Fast Server","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"\/wp-content\/themes\/jannah\/assets\/images\/logo@2x.png"}},"sourceOrganization":{"@id":"#Publisher"},"copyrightHolder":{"@id":"#Publisher"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"\/index.php\/2015\/06\/23\/re-agniveer-refutation-of-muslim-wife-or-concubine\/","breadcrumb":{"@id":"#Breadcrumb"}},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"vedkabhed","url":"\/author\/vedkabhed\/"}}</script>
