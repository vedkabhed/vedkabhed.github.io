</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:red;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;background-color:white;">A logical analysis of the claim of Islam being final and only revelation of Allah by Vixter – an active member of Agniveer site:</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:red;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;background-color:white;">We often hear the followers of Mian <strong><em>Zakir Naik</em></strong> claiming that Islam has not come into existence 1400 years ago, but it has been there since time memorial. They also say that Islam was not founded by Muhammad rather it is there from the day when Adam and Eve were sent down to earth. But when they are asked that if Islam has nothing to do with Muhammad, <strong>why is it necessary to believe in Muhammad and include him in the prayers alongside Allah</strong>, they run away saying Allah knows the best and Muhammad is his final messenger!</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">————————————————————————————————————————————————————————–</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>

</span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">In The Name Of Allah, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Brother Vixter (the author of the article on Agniveer), you seriously need to go through the definition and the basics of Islam.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">This is not a claim of the followers of  Zakir Naik (HafizUllah) but of all the Muslims, that Islam has been there since time immemorial.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">All the Muslims believe that Islam is not a new religion, and Prophet Muhammad (s) is the last messenger of God.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Lissan al-Arab, one of the most authoritative lexicons of the Arabic language, mentions that the word ‘Islam’ is derived from the root verb istaslama (<span style="color:black;">استسلاما<span style="color:navy;">); which means ‘to submit’ or ‘give in’ or ‘surrender’</span></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">The word <span style="color:black;">إسلام<span style="color:navy;"> Islām is derived from Arabic triconsonantal root sīn-lām-mīm (SLM [<span style="color:black;"> س ل م<span style="color:navy;"> ])., meaning “submission” (i.e. entrusting one’s wholeness to the only one and True God). “One who submits” is signified by the participle <span style="color:black;">مسلم<span style="color:navy;">, Muslim (fem. <span style="color:black;">مسلمة<span style="color:navy;">, muslimah).</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>

<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Islam has everything to do with not only Muhammad (peace be upon him), but also Jesus (peace be upon him), Moses (peace be upon him), till Adam (peace be upon him) because it is one of the most important article of faith. The basic of Islam is to believe and worship only One and True God, without associating any partners with him. To establish prayer (though the complete  manner of praying may not have been the same all throughout from the time of Adam (peace be upon him), but the most important portion- the Prostration, remained there), To pay the poor Zakat (though the minimum amount (nisaab) which a person may have had in order to pay the zakat and the rate of zakat may have differed, but the basic principle of giving in order to help the poor remained the same all throughout), and to observe the Fasts.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">It is necessary for us Muslims to believe in Muhammad (peace be upon him), because it is equally necessary for us Muslims, to believe in all the Prophets and messengers of Allah.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">We, True Muslims, don’t pray to Muhammad (peace be upon him) like we do to Allah (swt). We don’t exaggerate in praising him. We never raised him to the rank of Almighty God.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Yes, we do <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>pray For</strong></span> Muhammad (peace be upon him), but we <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>don’t pray to him</strong></span>. We ask Allah (swt) to send peace and blessings on Muhammad (peace be upon him) as well as his families like Allah blessed Abraham (peace be upon him). And likewise, we do pray for our parents, families, etc.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>

<p><span style="color:black;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;background-color:white;"> <span style="color:red;">Agniveer states:</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:red;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;background-color:white;">The above claim of Islam to be the only religion from the time memorial could have <strong>only</strong> been true only if the condition to be a good Muslim would have never changed along the time, but it did. Back then, anyone who worshipped one formless God was a Muslim (Adam, Abraham, Moses, etc), but today, not only a person must worship one formless Allah (interestingly, formless Allah has two hands as per Quran [38:75]), but must also consider prophet Mohammad as the final messenger and must believe in angels, Quran, judgment day, heaven, and hell as well in order to reserve the seat in paradise.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">————————————————————————————————————————————————————————–</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"><strong>Response:</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">You are claiming this false assumption because you are ignorant about the basics of Islam.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Insha’allah from your logic only, We will be proving Islam to be the only religion since time immemorial.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">We have already given, the basic conditions on which Islam is based and the conditions of faith, believing in which makes a person, a good Muslim.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">In none of the conditions of Islam, nor faith, is there specifically mentioned about Prophet Muhammad. Instead, it is in general mentioned to believe in all the Apostles of Allah, which include all the apostles from the time of Adam (peace be upon him) till Muhammad (peace be upon him).</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">He says that previously the Muslims used to worship the formless God ? And later on it changed?.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">And in the brackets he gave the example of (Adam, Abraham, Moses, etc).</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">So let us look to which God the first human being Worshipped ( Note : in the very same article this guy accepted that Adam was the first human being according to Muslims belief, but he made error that Muslims don’t consider him Prophet).</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Let us look at the Proofs of it, and the ignorance of that person who wrote this article.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>

<p><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">130       And who turns away from the religion of Ibrahim (Abraham) (i.e. Islamic Monotheism) except him who befools himself? Truly, We chose him in this world and verily, in the Hereafter he will be among the righteous.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">131       When his Lord said to him, “Submit (i.e. be a Muslim)!” He said, “I have submitted myself (as a Muslim) to the Lord of the ‘Alamin (mankind, jinn and all that exists).”</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">132       And this (submission to Allah, Islam) was enjoined by Ibrahim (Abraham) upon his sons and by Ya’qub (Jacob) (saying), “O my sons! Allah has chosen for you the (true) religion, then die not except in the Faith of Islam (as Muslims – Islamic Monotheism).”</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">133       Or were you witnesses when death approached Ya’qub (Jacob)? When he said unto his sons, “What will you worship after me?” They said, “We shall worship your Ilah (God – Allah), the Ilah (God) of your fathers, Ibrahim (Abraham), Isma’il (Ishmael), Ishaq (Isaac), One Ilah (God), and to Him we submit (in Islam).”</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">134       That was a nation who has passed away. They shall receive the reward of what they earned and you of what you earn. And you will not be asked of what they used to do.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">135       And they say, “Be Jews or Christians, then you will be guided.” Say (to them O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم), “Nay, (we follow) only the religion of Ibrahim (Abraham), Hanifa [Islamic Monotheism, i.e. to worship none but Allah (Alone)], and he was not of Al-Mushrikun (those who worshipped others along with Allah – see V.2:105).”</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">136       Say (O Muslims), “We believe in Allah and that which has been sent down to us and that which has been sent down to Ibrahim (Abraham), Isma’il (Ishmael), Ishaq (Isaac), Ya’qub (Jacob), and to Al-Asbat [the offspring of the twelve sons of Ya’qub (Jacob)], and that which has been given to Musa (Moses) and ‘Îsa (Jesus), and that which has been given to the Prophets from their Lord. We make no distinction between any of them, and to Him we have submitted (in Islam).”</span></p>

</span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">The condition for being a good Muslim remained the same all throughout and never changed at all, Alhamdolillah.

</span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">As far as the Jews are concerning, their faith meant believing in the Tawraat (original Torah) and following the way of Moses (peace be upon him) and believeing in Moses (peace be upon him) as the messenger of Allah and to testify to that fact until Jesus came, after which whoever continued to follow the Torah and the way of Moses, and did not leave this and follow Jesus, was doomed.

<span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">….. And had the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) believed, it would have been better for them; <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>among them are some who have faith</strong></span>, but most of them are Al-Fasiqoon (disobedient to Allah – and rebellious against Allahs Command). (<strong>Al-Qur’an 3:110</strong>)</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span>
<p><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Verily! Those who believe and those who are Jews and Christians, and Sabians, <strong>whoever believes</strong> in Allah and the Last Day and do righteous good deeds shall have their reward with their Lord, on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve . (<strong>Al-Qur’an 2:62</strong>)</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Surely, those who believe (in the Oneness of Allah, in His Messenger Muhammad SAW and all that was revealed to him from Allah), those who are the Jews and the Sabians and the Christians, – whosoever believed in Allah and the Last Day, and worked righteousness, on them shall be no fear,nor shall they grieve. (<strong>Al-Qur’an 5:69</strong>)</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>

<p><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">It almost bursts up with fury. Every time a group is cast therein (in the Hell Fire), its keeper will ask: “Did no warner come to you?” They will say: “Yes indeed; a warner did come to us, but we belied him and said: Allah never sent down anything (of revelation), you are only in great error.” (<strong>Al-Qur’an 67:8-9</strong>)</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">This proves that those who belied the warners which came to them, they are the ones, who will be thrown into the Fire. Those who believed them, they are the one’s with Faith.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Every group which believed in Allah and the Last Day, which is the appointed Day of Reckoning, and did righteous deeds at the time of their respective prophets and messengers was a believer and a Muslim. But after the coming up of new revelations and Sharee’ah (Law), if they didn’t accept them, then they are eligible for hell.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Similarly after Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was sent to both mankind and the jinn, true belief can only be in accordance with the way of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Whoever follows his way will not fear the future or grieve for what they leave behind.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">With the coming up of various Messengers, the Shariah (Islamic Law) kept on changing, not the basic message and the Aqeedah (creed) of all the messengers remained the same.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>

<p><span style="color:black;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;background-color:white;"> <span style="color:red;">Agniveer states:</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:red;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;background-color:white;">Now, if Islam really existed since time memorial, one may ask, <strong>how is this possible when the oldest Quran is less than 2000 years old?</strong> Should not the age of Quran be more than 2000 years old in order to make Islam a religion which existed since time memorial?</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:red;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;background-color:white;">In order to refute this claim, many Muslims quote the following verse from Quran, <em>“We did send messengers before thee, and appointed for them wives and children: and it was never the part of an apostle to bring <span style="text-decoration:underline;">a sign except as Allah permitted (or commanded). For each period is a Book (revealed) [Surah Rad, verse 13:38].”</span></em>This verse is saying that Allah sent revelations in every era, and revealed them to a different prophet each time. This means many revelations were sent but only four are mentioned by n<span style="text-decoration:underline;">ame: Torah (taurat), Psalms of David (zabur), Bible (injeel), and Quran.</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">————————————————————————————————————————————————————————–</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"><strong>Response:</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Islam existed since time immemorial, not a single Muslim claimed that Qur’an existed since time immemorial. Qur’an doesn’t need to make or prove that Islam is older rather Qur’an is the final revelation of Almighty Allah (swt) as We have explained and proved above that Religion was the same but Shariah keep on changing (i.e Laws) but the Creed was same of all and also all the sects agree upon this.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Note here and in the next verse from Surah Rad Chapter 13 verses 38 to 39, it refers to Luh Al Mahfuz and Decree of Allah (swt) [ Refer to Tafsir Ibn-e-Kathir ],</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">First of all again he start misquoting that Allah sent revelations in every era, first of All here Qur’an only says we sent Messengers before you.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">But we agree that Allah sent revelation with Prophet in every era as proven from other verses of Quran and also from Sunnah.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>

</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">This verse also proves that every Messenger brought the same creed that they should worship Allah alone, but only difference was in the Shariah.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Again he made a wrong point that  “This means many revelations were sent but only four are mentioned by name: Torah (taurat), Psalms of David (zabur), Bible (injeel), and Quran”</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">The correct thing what the Muslims believe is that Many revelations were sent and all revelations were not the Book, but it was the Hikmah (i.e The Sunnah which we commonly refer as Hadith) and only four books were sent and they are mentioned with name. So this is again a lame claim that only four books name are mentioned but actually only four books were sent of whom name are mentioned. And also include Sahifa-e-Ibrahim and of Musa as mentioned in</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>

</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;background-color:white;"> <span style="color:red;">Agniveer states:</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:red;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;background-color:white;">This verse is saying that Allah sent revelations in every era, and revealed them to a different prophet each time. This means many revelations were sent but only four are mentioned by name: Torah (taurat), Psalms of David (zabur), Bible (injeel), and Quran.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:red;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;background-color:white;">Now, if we examine these four scriptures closely, we will find out that <strong>all four of these books were revealed in the same geographic area.</strong> This area contains Israel, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia. One can easily see that all these countries are not far apart from each other on the map. Torah was revealed on Mount Sinai on theSinai Peninsula near Egypt, whereas Psalms and Bible were revealed in locations near or in Israel. We all know that Quran was revealed in Saudi Arabia. Now, it is common sense that anyone back then could get all this information just by simply traveling from place to place.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:red;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;background-color:white;">Moreover, Mohammad even had Jewish and Christian allies/enemies so it is common sense that he or his Arab followers could have got educated through them. Besides, naturally we learn about other religions by meeting and debating their followers. So from the above arguments, it is quite evident that the authors of the Quran borrowed all their concepts from the Torah and Bible. This is why there are so many similarities between Bible and the Quran. Now, we see that the recipe to make a Quran is simple. <strong>Just borrow concepts from the Torah and Bible, and add some Arab traditions, and there, your Quran is ready!</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">————————————————————————————————————————————————————————–</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"><strong>Response:</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Now in these 2 paragraphs the author wants to claim that Quran has been plagiarized from previous scriptures and etc.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">The first translation of the Bible in Arabic was written down of the Old Testament after 200 years of the demise of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), and even after more later on the New Testament was translated. Even the Bible was not in sequence as we found today, If Prophet Muhammad (s) plagiarized then why he didn’t note down the incorrect and contradictory things mentioned in the Bible ?. There are many things such as Bible says The Sun and Moon has its own light. But Quran doesn’t contain this scientific error, and Prophet Muhammad (s) was unlettered so it was impossible for him to read from anywhere, or write. And Prophet Muhammad (s) was always gathered with people around him how could he have heard or learned from somewhere? For this claim he has to provide any authentic proof of History, which unfortunately doesn’t exist because this is a fairy tale that Prophet Muhammad (s) plagiarized from the previous scriptures. And again the question arises why did the Companions of the Prophet Muhammad (s) help him to suffer a life with trials and leave a luxurious life to plagiarise.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">And the author said a Sentence that “He could have got educated through them” then he has to provide any evidence that Prophet got educated about previous scriptures from any Christian or Jew. Which he has neither provided and neither can provide, and the thing he was trying to show actually he got failed because of his no knowledge in Islam instead of hatred it is clear because in the last statement to which we answered, he is trying to show that All revelations had name, which is actually again a wrong claim and moreover, he is trying hard to prove that Veda is one of them.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">“…Bring forth your proofs, if you are truthful.” (<strong>Al-Qur’an 27:64</strong>)</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>

</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:red;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;background-color:white;">Many more questions on this theory arise when we closely analyze the facts</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:red;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;background-color:white;">1. If Allah named those four books, then <strong>why did He forget to name the revelations of India, China, Iran, South America, and other places in the world, in which more than three fourth of total population of the world lived at that time?</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">————————————————————————————————————————————————————————–</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"><strong>Response:</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Allah revealed only four Books and he named only four books, neither had he revealed any Book besides it so that he could have named it. Now the question that the revelations of India, Iran, China etc, so the answer is already mentioned above rest of the Prophet were given Hadith which is known as Wahy-e-Khufi.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"><span style="color:navy;">And here is the example from Quran,</span> </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>

</span>
<p><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">And indeed We gave Mûsa (Moses), after We had destroyed the generations of old,— the Scripture [the Taurât (Torah)] as an enlightenment for mankind, and a guidance and a mercy, that they might remember (or receive admonition).

</span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Similar is the case with other Prophets, And Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) was blessed with Book Quran and Hikmah (the Sunnah).</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>

<p><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">“For Allah hath sent down to thee the Book and wisdom and taught thee what thou knewest not (before); and great is the grace of Allah unto thee.”</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>

<p><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Allah further states in <strong>Surah baqarah chapter 2 verse 231</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">It is part of the blessing upon the believers that the Prophet taught them both the book (the Qur’an) and the Hikmah (the sunnah)</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">So it quite evident from the above proofs that all the Prophets were received revelation and Hikmah and these four were given Books which are actually named.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>

</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:red;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;background-color:white;">2. If Allah wanted to only mention four books, then <strong>why did He not mention four books that were revealed in four different corners of the world?</strong> All four books He mentioned were all revealed in same area consisting of Israel, Egypt, and Arabia.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:red;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;background-color:white;">3. More importantly, if Allah wanted to name any four books, why did He not give the name of the FIRST revelation? Logically, He should name the first, the last, and any two books in the middle eras, but that is not the case.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>

</span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Brother, are you angry and disturbed, that, Allah (swt) didn’t mention about the Vedas? It seems, so.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">There is Hikmat (Wisdom) of Allah (swt) in this too. Allah (swt) is our creator. He knows what is best for us. He will not go and do things according to what you say or think. Your or mine logic is nothing compared to the logic of our creator.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">If the revelations of the East would have been mentioned, then you would have argued why not the revelations of the West. If the first and the last and any two revelations in between would have been mentioned and still if you would not have found Vedas in it, then you would have demanded the remaining two then the remaining two, and this would have continued, until you would have demanded, the names of all revelations. Qur’an, answers and addresses only things which are important and which appeals to Human minds. It is a guide, a saviour. If Allah (swt) would have started to address every illogical unimportant question, then, the Qur’an would have been in thousands of volumes, and then also, you would have complained, that how can a divine book be so voluminous that it’s difficult for people to study?</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>

However, there are some fanatics like <strong><em>Zakir Naik</em></strong>who use their false interpretations to twist some verses of <strong><em>Vedas</em></strong> to prove Muhammad’s prophecy in them, but later on doubt <strong><em>Vedas</em></strong> to be the word of God. So, in this case, <strong><em>Zakir Naik</em></strong> falls into his own trap. (Please see the article on prophet in Vedas on this same site). Interestingly, Maulana Abdullah Tariq is the prominent speaker of Peace TV of Zakir Naik! <strong>Its up to Zakir Naik, whether he accepts Vedas to be first divine revelation like his scholar Maulana Abdullah Tariq, or announce that Maulana Abdullah Tariq is not scholar and he has committed Shirk by giving Vedas the same status as Quran.</strong> Zakir should also apologize to Muslims that he has aired the programs of a Mushrik on his own Peace TV!</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>

</span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Not only Syed Abdullah Tariq, every Muslim believes that all the previous books, save the Qur’an, were corrupted and distorted with the passage of time.

<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Thus it is proven that Muhammad (peace be upon him) was the last Prophet of God.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>

<p><span style="color:red;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;background-color:white;">2) Quran is the final message and others were not because Allah decided to reveal His knowledge in stages since the human mind evolves slowly.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:red;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;background-color:white;">Comments-a. So revelations came in stages because human mind was evolving. Can one ask, has human mind stopped evolving now? If no, then new revelation is needed. If yes, then how could most of the revolutionary inventions like electricity, trains and airplanes take place after more than 1000 years of reception of final revelation?</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>

</span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">There is nothing like this that human mind was evolving rather the Qur’an clearly states that All those Prophets which were sent previously were for that particular nation only but Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) has been sent for the whole of human kind see (<strong>Qur’an</strong><br>
<strong>21:107</strong>). And Islam didn’t come to teach you electricity or any revolutionary inventions, but rather it came to show and perfect the complete way of living life.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>

</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:red;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;background-color:white;">b. Many verses of the Quran are said to be abrogated by the new ones during the lifetime of Muhammad. If abrogated verses were imperfect, Allah becomes imperfect. If abrogated verses too have the reason of human mind’s evolution, it reflects unnatural evolution rate of Arabs because previous revelations like Injeel lasted for around 600 years, but in case of Quran, some verses were canceled within few years of their revelation!</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:red;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;background-color:white;">c. It seems human mind was evolving till Muhammad received the last abrogated verse of Quran and then all humans suddenly stopped evolving!</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>

</span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">None of the verses of Quran abrogates each other, but rather it abrogates previous Shariah, as i also explained above the Creed and Shariah.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>

<p><span style="color:red;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;background-color:white;">d. In what way, did the human mind evolve from inception till today? Back then humans knew the same basic functions of nature and life as they do today. What new laws did Allah has told us in the Quran, which are not found in previous books? This silly claim helps fanatics like Zakir Naik to add the age of older books to increase the age of Islam, but they can never tell the world about the first Islamic revelation authentically. Our prime message for everyone is to return to Vedas since Quran teaches nothing new from Vedas. Every good thing that the Quran mentions is already present in Vedas.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>

</span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">You say that Back then humans knew the same basic functions of nature and life as they do today.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">But ,According to Vedas, the earth is static and this statement is repeated several times. The following is  some of the examples:</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"><span style="color:red;">The God who made the earth stable</span> <span style="color:black;">(<strong>Yajur Ved 32/6</strong>)</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>

</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"><span style="color:red;">Prajâpati settle upon the back of Earth.</span> <span style="color:black;">(<strong>Yajur Ved 13.24</strong>)</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>

<p><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"><span style="color:red;">“The Bull has supported the sky.”</span><strong><br>
<span style="color:black;">Yajur Ved: 4: 30</span></strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>

</span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">There are many such facts mentioned in the vedas, which are unscientific. We thought of not putting all of them, as it would choke your throat as well as the topic.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">So, brother you see, with such illogical claims and unscientific facts mentioned in the Vedas, people really needed something logical and authentic. And people definitely are smarter, enough to judge the right from wrong. Which was not so earlier, and this is the reason they got fooled by the facts of the Vedas. Only a fool would desire to follow the inaccuracy of the Vedas, when he has the Qur’an.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>

</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:red;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;background-color:white;">Conclusively, we would like to say that the three Abrahamic religions follow the same mechanism. This mechanism is like a caterpillar that keeps gaining length as time progresses in the form of revelations. First, Jews introduced their Jewish scriptures, then Christians added their Bible and claimed it to be the final uncorrupted message of God. Now, Arabs added their Quran, and claimed it to be the final message of Allah since all the earlier revelations like Torah, Psalms, and Bible have been corrupted with the passage of time. Then we witnessed an offshoot of Islam, Qadiyani sect, which has its own final messenger in the form of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad Qadiyani. Today, everyone is confused, which Quran (of 6666 verses or 17000 verses…) is the final edition and which is not.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>

</span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Again he didn’t give any authentic proof that how Arabs added Quran. And he contradicts himself because he says Every good thing that Quran mentions is already present in Vedas, then Vedas is also corrupted according to him since Quran is not revelation from God according to him so  neither should the Vedas be too.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">And nobody is confused with regards to the verses in the Quran as We wrote above and it is against the verse 15:9 which is a false belief. The Practice and Saying of any Muslim doesn’t become the part of Islam neither of any Religion so don’t put this Shia theory in Islam.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>

</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:red;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;background-color:white;">Finally, if indeed Allah wanted Quran to be the final message for humans, why did He not ensure that the Quran is properly documented within lifetime of Muhammad itself? Why did he wait for at least 20 years after Muhammad’s death for the Quran to get documented? Why did he make the Caliph who got Quran documented murdered by other followers of Islam? Why Muhammad’s wife Aisha and his son-in-law Ali – two of the most prominent companions of Muhammad – bent on killing each other and the Caliph who documented the Quran? Why did he allow certain Hadiths which say that some verses of Quran were eaten by goats and some verses were uttered under influence of Satan?</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>

<p><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"><strong>Response:</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">First of All the whole Quran was written down under the guidance of Prophet Muhammad (s) in his life time, and he cross checked them by asking the writers to read out to him what they wrote. The compilation was done later on. Quran was already written down and there were memorizers of it already so whether Caliph compiled it later on it was already saved before that and killing of Caliph took place after the compilation of Quran. Does fighting amongst them has to do with the protection of Quran ? Neither Hazrat Ali nor Aisha said that we have different Quran. This is totally wrong and has no basis that some verses of Quran were eaten by goat and regarding Satan, also no references from Quran and Sunnah were provided to support such claim.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>

</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:red;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;background-color:white;">If Allah was serious enough to make Quran the only and the final word from Him, he would have ensured that thousands of copies of Quran would have been documented within Muhammad’s lifetime itself so that no confusion can ever come. The way He ensured that Vedas be memorized in 8 different methods so that they can be cross-checked anytime and inspired us to start tradition of protecting Vedas which exists even till today.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>

<p><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"><strong>Response:</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">As for the Quran it was already written down at the time of Prophet (s), but nobody knows when were Vedas written down and when it was revealed. Regarding thousand copies, if one copy was enough for that time then why there is a need for thousand of copies. Moreover, at that time only and even today, there are innumerable number of people (Huffaaz) who have memorized the Qur’an and you can also cross – check anytime. Qur’an has been protected, guarded and well preserved both in words and memory, Alhamdolillah.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Now having replied to all your illogical allegations, we would like to pose the same questions to you regarding your Vedas.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">When was actually the Vedas revealed because if it came down with the first human on earth, if not anything, then atleast the exact age would help us solve as to how old the earth is?</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span>
</li>
<li>
<span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">What does it have to say about the first humans on earth?</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span>
</li>
<li>
<span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Why were the Vedas revealed in and around the Indian subcontinent? Why not any other parts of the world?</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span>
</li>
<li>
<span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">What does Vedas say about the revelations of the remaining continents? Because since you claim that the Vedas were the oldest revelations, then it would have been really difficult to access it, because there were no means of communications at that time.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span>
</li>
<li>
<span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">What and how did the people in the remaining parts of the world live without the guidance of the Vedas as it was revealed only to a particular place?</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span>
</li>
<li>
<span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Why does the Vedas contain facts which go against established science?</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span>
</li>
<li>
<span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">If God was serious enough to make Vedas as the first and the last revelation, why did he not take the pain of presenting correct logical information in it?</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">And many more question arises, but this is not the right topic to start with.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>

Zeeshan Akhtar\n\n\n\nAgniveer states:\n\nA logical analysis of the claim of Islam being final and only revelation of Allah by Vixter – an active member of Agniveer site:\n\nWe often hear the followers of Mian Zakir Naik claiming that Islam has not come into existence 1400 years ago, but it has been there since time memorial. They also say that Islam was not founded by Muhammad rather it is there from the day when Adam and Eve were sent down to earth. But when they are asked that if Islam has nothing to do with Muhammad, why is it necessary to believe in Muhammad and include him in the prayers alongside Allah, they run away saying Allah knows the best and Muhammad is his final messenger!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResponse:\n\nIn The Name Of Allah, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful\n\n\nBrother Vixter (the author of the article on Agniveer), you seriously need to go through the definition and the basics of Islam.\n\n\nThis is not a claim of the followers of  Zakir Naik (HafizUllah) but of all the Muslims, that Islam has been there since time immemorial.\n\n\nAll the Muslims believe that Islam is not a new religion, and Prophet Muhammad (s) is the last messenger of God.\n\n\nLissan al-Arab, one of the most authoritative lexicons of the Arabic language, mentions that the word 'Islam' is derived from the root verb istaslama (استسلاما); which means 'to submit' or 'give in' or 'surrender'\n\n\nThe word إسلام Islām is derived from Arabic triconsonantal root sīn-lām-mīm (SLM [ س ل م ])., meaning \"submission\" (i.e. entrusting one's wholeness to the only one and True God). \"One who submits\" is signified by the participle مسلم, Muslim (fem. مسلمة, muslimah).\n\n\n \n\n\n\nThe Book of Faith (Kitab Al-Iman)  Muslim :: Book 1 : Hadith 6\n\n……In the meanwhile a man came there, and sat near his knees and said: Messenger of Allah, what al-lslam is? -to which he (the Holy Prophet) replied: You must not associate anything with Allah, and establish prayer, pay the poor-rate (Zakat) and observe (the fasts) of Ramadan. He said: You (have) told the truth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour claim is full of ignorance that Islam has nothing to do with Prophet Muhammad (s)  then why it is necessary to believe in him?\n\n\n \n\n\n\nThis verse of the Glorious Quran is a Proof for this :\n\nIt is not Al-Birr (piety, righteousness, and each and every act of obedience to Allâh, etc.) that you turn your faces towards east and (or) west (in prayers); but Al-Birr is (the quality of) the one who believes in Allâh, the Last Day, the Angels, the Book, the Prophets and gives his wealth, in spite of love for it, to the kinsfolk, to the orphans, and to Al-Masâkin (the poor), and to the wayfarer, and to those who ask, and to set slaves free, performs As-Salât (Iqâmat-as-Salât), and gives the Zakât, and who fulfill their covenant when they make it, and who are patient in extreme poverty and ailment (disease) and at the time of fighting (during the battles). Such are the people of the truth and they are Al Muttaqûn (pious - see V.2:2) (Al Qur'an 2:177)\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nMoreover, see this Hadith of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him)\n\n\n \n\n\n\nThe Book of Faith (Kitab Al-Iman)  Muslim :: Book 1 : Hadith 6\n\n…….He (again) said: Messenger of Allah, what al-Iman (the faith) is?\n\nHe (the Holy Prophet) said: That you affirm your faith in Allah, His angels, His Books, His meeting, His Apostles, and that you believe in Resurrection and that you believe in Qadr (Divine Decree) in all its entirety, He (the inquirer) said: You (have) told the truth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIslam has everything to do with not only Muhammad (peace be upon him), but also Jesus (peace be upon him), Moses (peace be upon him), till Adam (peace be upon him) because it is one of the most important article of faith. The basic of Islam is to believe and worship only One and True God, without associating any partners with him. To establish prayer (though the complete  manner of praying may not have been the same all throughout from the time of Adam (peace be upon him), but the most important portion- the Prostration, remained there), To pay the poor Zakat (though the minimum amount (nisaab) which a person may have had in order to pay the zakat and the rate of zakat may have differed, but the basic principle of giving in order to help the poor remained the same all throughout), and to observe the Fasts.\n\n\nIt is necessary for us Muslims to believe in Muhammad (peace be upon him), because it is equally necessary for us Muslims, to believe in all the Prophets and messengers of Allah.\n\n\nWe, True Muslims, don't pray to Muhammad (peace be upon him) like we do to Allah (swt). We don't exaggerate in praising him. We never raised him to the rank of Almighty God.\n\n\nYes, we do pray For Muhammad (peace be upon him), but we don't pray to him. We ask Allah (swt) to send peace and blessings on Muhammad (peace be upon him) as well as his families like Allah blessed Abraham (peace be upon him). And likewise, we do pray for our parents, families, etc.\n\n\nSee Similarities between Islam and Hinduism lecture by Br.Zakir Naik where he in the starting 20 minutes explained the faith of Muslims.\n\n\nHere is an online link for it too:\n\n\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=7lFZSfSplsk\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Agniveer states:\n\n\nThe above claim of Islam to be the only religion from the time memorial could have only been true only if the condition to be a good Muslim would have never changed along the time, but it did. Back then, anyone who worshipped one formless God was a Muslim (Adam, Abraham, Moses, etc), but today, not only a person must worship one formless Allah (interestingly, formless Allah has two hands as per Quran [38:75]), but must also consider prophet Mohammad as the final messenger and must believe in angels, Quran, judgment day, heaven, and hell as well in order to reserve the seat in paradise.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResponse:\n\n\nYou are claiming this false assumption because you are ignorant about the basics of Islam.\n\n\nInsha'allah from your logic only, We will be proving Islam to be the only religion since time immemorial.\n\n\nWe have already given, the basic conditions on which Islam is based and the conditions of faith, believing in which makes a person, a good Muslim.\n\n\nIn none of the conditions of Islam, nor faith, is there specifically mentioned about Prophet Muhammad. Instead, it is in general mentioned to believe in all the Apostles of Allah, which include all the apostles from the time of Adam (peace be upon him) till Muhammad (peace be upon him).\n\n\nHe says that previously the Muslims used to worship the formless God ? And later on it changed?.\n\n\nAnd in the brackets he gave the example of (Adam, Abraham, Moses, etc).\n\n\nSo let us look to which God the first human being Worshipped ( Note : in the very same article this guy accepted that Adam was the first human being according to Muslims belief, but he made error that Muslims don't consider him Prophet).\n\n\nLet us look at the Proofs of it, and the ignorance of that person who wrote this article.\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\nSurah Al-Baqarah Chapter 2\n\n\n130       And who turns away from the religion of Ibrahim (Abraham) (i.e. Islamic Monotheism) except him who befools himself? Truly, We chose him in this world and verily, in the Hereafter he will be among the righteous.\n\n\n131       When his Lord said to him, \"Submit (i.e. be a Muslim)!\" He said, \"I have submitted myself (as a Muslim) to the Lord of the 'Alamin (mankind, jinn and all that exists).\"\n\n\n132       And this (submission to Allah, Islam) was enjoined by Ibrahim (Abraham) upon his sons and by Ya'qub (Jacob) (saying), \"O my sons! Allah has chosen for you the (true) religion, then die not except in the Faith of Islam (as Muslims - Islamic Monotheism).\"\n\n\n133       Or were you witnesses when death approached Ya'qub (Jacob)? When he said unto his sons, \"What will you worship after me?\" They said, \"We shall worship your Ilah (God - Allah), the Ilah (God) of your fathers, Ibrahim (Abraham), Isma'il (Ishmael), Ishaq (Isaac), One Ilah (God), and to Him we submit (in Islam).\"\n\n\n134       That was a nation who has passed away. They shall receive the reward of what they earned and you of what you earn. And you will not be asked of what they used to do.\n\n\n135       And they say, \"Be Jews or Christians, then you will be guided.\" Say (to them O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم), \"Nay, (we follow) only the religion of Ibrahim (Abraham), Hanifa [Islamic Monotheism, i.e. to worship none but Allah (Alone)], and he was not of Al-Mushrikun (those who worshipped others along with Allah - see V.2:105).\"\n\n\n136       Say (O Muslims), \"We believe in Allah and that which has been sent down to us and that which has been sent down to Ibrahim (Abraham), Isma'il (Ishmael), Ishaq (Isaac), Ya'qub (Jacob), and to Al-Asbat [the offspring of the twelve sons of Ya'qub (Jacob)], and that which has been given to Musa (Moses) and 'Îsa (Jesus), and that which has been given to the Prophets from their Lord. We make no distinction between any of them, and to Him we have submitted (in Islam).\"\n\n\n\n\n \n\nHere Allah (swt) is clearly explaining that their Creed and Religion was same.\n\n\nThe condition for being a good Muslim remained the same all throughout and never changed at all, Alhamdolillah. These conditions were to affirm one's faith in Allah (i.e, to worship Him alone without associating any partners with Him) , His angels, His Books, His meeting, His Apostles, and that you believe in Resurrection and that you believe in Qadr (Divine Decree) in all its entirety,\n\n\nEveryone, from the time of Adam (peace be upon him) who fulfilled these conditions was a Good Muslim.\n\n\nAs far as the Jews are concerning, their faith meant believing in the Tawraat (original Torah) and following the way of Moses (peace be upon him) and believeing in Moses (peace be upon him) as the messenger of Allah and to testify to that fact until Jesus came, after which whoever continued to follow the Torah and the way of Moses, and did not leave this and follow Jesus, was doomed. Whoever denied, Moses (peace be upon him) at that time, are the ones entitled for the Hell fire.\n\n\nAs far as the Christians are concerned, their faith meant believing in the Injeel (original Gospel) and following the laws of Jesus, believeing in him to be the messenger of Allah and testifying to that fact; whoever did this was a believer whose faith was acceptable to Allah, until Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came, after which whoever did not follow Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and leave the way of Jesus and the Injeel that he had been following before, was doomed.\n\n\n \n\n\n….. And had the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) believed, it would have been better for them; among them are some who have faith, but most of them are Al-Fasiqoon (disobedient to Allah - and rebellious against Allahs Command). (Al-Qur'an 3:110)\n\n\nVerily! Those who believe and those who are Jews and Christians, and Sabians, whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day and do righteous good deeds shall have their reward with their Lord, on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve . (Al-Qur'an 2:62)\n\n\nSurely, those who believe (in the Oneness of Allah, in His Messenger Muhammad SAW and all that was revealed to him from Allah), those who are the Jews and the Sabians and the Christians, - whosoever believed in Allah and the Last Day, and worked righteousness, on them shall be no fear,nor shall they grieve. (Al-Qur'an 5:69)\n\n\nIt almost bursts up with fury. Every time a group is cast therein (in the Hell Fire), its keeper will ask: \"Did no warner come to you?\" They will say: \"Yes indeed; a warner did come to us, but we belied him and said: Allah never sent down anything (of revelation), you are only in great error.\" (Al-Qur'an 67:8-9)\n\n\n\n\n \n\nThis proves that those who belied the warners which came to them, they are the ones, who will be thrown into the Fire. Those who believed them, they are the one's with Faith.\n\n\nEvery group which believed in Allah and the Last Day, which is the appointed Day of Reckoning, and did righteous deeds at the time of their respective prophets and messengers was a believer and a Muslim. But after the coming up of new revelations and Sharee'ah (Law), if they didn't accept them, then they are eligible for hell.\n\n\nSimilarly after Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was sent to both mankind and the jinn, true belief can only be in accordance with the way of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Whoever follows his way will not fear the future or grieve for what they leave behind.\n\n\nWith the coming up of various Messengers, the Shariah (Islamic Law) kept on changing, not the basic message and the Aqeedah (creed) of all the messengers remained the same.\n\n\nRegarding Allah having hands, then this is again your ignorance. For more on this Subject see the Refutation of the Article of the same Website Agniveer \"Allah Shapeless or Limited\" http:\/\/www.systemoflife.com\/answering-islamophobes\/agniveer\/200-allah-shapeless-or-limited\n\n\n \n\n\nWell We would like to know that what you people have to say about this Vedic verses. We are providing here only one example otherwise there are many verses which talk about hands.\n\n\nRig Veda - Mandal 1 sukt 24 mantra 4\n\n\nWealth, highly lauded ere reproach hath fallen on it, which is laid,\n\n\nFree from all hatred, in thy hands\n\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Agniveer states:\n\n\nNow, if Islam really existed since time memorial, one may ask, how is this possible when the oldest Quran is less than 2000 years old? Should not the age of Quran be more than 2000 years old in order to make Islam a religion which existed since time memorial?\n\n\nIn order to refute this claim, many Muslims quote the following verse from Quran, \"We did send messengers before thee, and appointed for them wives and children: and it was never the part of an apostle to bring a sign except as Allah permitted (or commanded). For each period is a Book (revealed) [Surah Rad, verse 13:38].\"This verse is saying that Allah sent revelations in every era, and revealed them to a different prophet each time. This means many revelations were sent but only four are mentioned by name: Torah (taurat), Psalms of David (zabur), Bible (injeel), and Quran.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResponse:\n\n\nIslam existed since time immemorial, not a single Muslim claimed that Qur'an existed since time immemorial. Qur'an doesn't need to make or prove that Islam is older rather Qur'an is the final revelation of Almighty Allah (swt) as We have explained and proved above that Religion was the same but Shariah keep on changing (i.e Laws) but the Creed was same of all and also all the sects agree upon this.\n\n\nNote here and in the next verse from Surah Rad Chapter 13 verses 38 to 39, it refers to Luh Al Mahfuz and Decree of Allah (swt) [ Refer to Tafsir Ibn-e-Kathir ],\n\n\nTranslation from Dr.Mohsin :\n\n\n \n\n\nAnd indeed We sent Messengers before you (O Muhammad SAW), and made for them wives and offspring. And it was not for a Messenger to bring a sign except by Allâh's Leave. (For) every matter there is a Decree (from Allâh). (Tafsir At-Tabari). (38)\n\n\n\n\n \n\nFirst of all again he start misquoting that Allah sent revelations in every era, first of All here Qur'an only says we sent Messengers before you.\n\n\nBut we agree that Allah sent revelation with Prophet in every era as proven from other verses of Quran and also from Sunnah.\n\n\n \n\n\nAllah says: \"We sent a Messenger to every nation ordering them that they should worship Allah Alone, obey Him and make their worship purely for Him, an that they should avoid everything worshipped except Allah.\" [Al Quran Chapter an-Nahl (16): 36]\n\n\n\n\n \n\nThis verse also proves that every Messenger brought the same creed that they should worship Allah alone, but only difference was in the Shariah.\n\n\nAgain he made a wrong point that  \"This means many revelations were sent but only four are mentioned by name: Torah (taurat), Psalms of David (zabur), Bible (injeel), and Quran\"\n\n\nThe correct thing what the Muslims believe is that Many revelations were sent and all revelations were not the Book, but it was the Hikmah (i.e The Sunnah which we commonly refer as Hadith) and only four books were sent and they are mentioned with name. So this is again a lame claim that only four books name are mentioned but actually only four books were sent of whom name are mentioned. And also include Sahifa-e-Ibrahim and of Musa as mentioned in\n\n\n \n\n\n\nSurah Al-Ala Chapter 87 Verse 19\n\nصُحُفِ إِبۡرَٲهِيمَ وَمُوسَىٰ (١٩)\n\nSuhufi ibraheema wamoosa\n\nWrits\/scrolls of Ibrahim and Musa. (19)\n\n\n\n\n\n \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Agniveer states:\n\n\nThis verse is saying that Allah sent revelations in every era, and revealed them to a different prophet each time. This means many revelations were sent but only four are mentioned by name: Torah (taurat), Psalms of David (zabur), Bible (injeel), and Quran.\n\n\nNow, if we examine these four scriptures closely, we will find out that all four of these books were revealed in the same geographic area. This area contains Israel, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia. One can easily see that all these countries are not far apart from each other on the map. Torah was revealed on Mount Sinai on theSinai Peninsula near Egypt, whereas Psalms and Bible were revealed in locations near or in Israel. We all know that Quran was revealed in Saudi Arabia. Now, it is common sense that anyone back then could get all this information just by simply traveling from place to place.\n\n\nMoreover, Mohammad even had Jewish and Christian allies\/enemies so it is common sense that he or his Arab followers could have got educated through them. Besides, naturally we learn about other religions by meeting and debating their followers. So from the above arguments, it is quite evident that the authors of the Quran borrowed all their concepts from the Torah and Bible. This is why there are so many similarities between Bible and the Quran. Now, we see that the recipe to make a Quran is simple. Just borrow concepts from the Torah and Bible, and add some Arab traditions, and there, your Quran is ready!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResponse:\n\n\nNow in these 2 paragraphs the author wants to claim that Quran has been plagiarized from previous scriptures and etc.\n\n\nThe first translation of the Bible in Arabic was written down of the Old Testament after 200 years of the demise of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), and even after more later on the New Testament was translated. Even the Bible was not in sequence as we found today, If Prophet Muhammad (s) plagiarized then why he didn't note down the incorrect and contradictory things mentioned in the Bible ?. There are many things such as Bible says The Sun and Moon has its own light. But Quran doesn't contain this scientific error, and Prophet Muhammad (s) was unlettered so it was impossible for him to read from anywhere, or write. And Prophet Muhammad (s) was always gathered with people around him how could he have heard or learned from somewhere? For this claim he has to provide any authentic proof of History, which unfortunately doesn't exist because this is a fairy tale that Prophet Muhammad (s) plagiarized from the previous scriptures. And again the question arises why did the Companions of the Prophet Muhammad (s) help him to suffer a life with trials and leave a luxurious life to plagiarise.\n\n\nAnd the author said a Sentence that \"He could have got educated through them\" then he has to provide any evidence that Prophet got educated about previous scriptures from any Christian or Jew. Which he has neither provided and neither can provide, and the thing he was trying to show actually he got failed because of his no knowledge in Islam instead of hatred it is clear because in the last statement to which we answered, he is trying to show that All revelations had name, which is actually again a wrong claim and moreover, he is trying hard to prove that Veda is one of them.\n\n\n\"…Bring forth your proofs, if you are truthful.\" (Al-Qur'an 27:64)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Agniveer states:\n\n\nMany more questions on this theory arise when we closely analyze the facts\n\n\n1. If Allah named those four books, then why did He forget to name the revelations of India, China, Iran, South America, and other places in the world, in which more than three fourth of total population of the world lived at that time?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResponse:\n\n\nAllah revealed only four Books and he named only four books, neither had he revealed any Book besides it so that he could have named it. Now the question that the revelations of India, Iran, China etc, so the answer is already mentioned above rest of the Prophet were given Hadith which is known as Wahy-e-Khufi.\n\n\nAnd here is the example from Quran, \n\n\n \n\n\nSurah Al-Qassas Chapter 28 Verse 43\n\n\nAnd indeed We gave Mûsa (Moses), after We had destroyed the generations of old,— the Scripture [the Taurât (Torah)] as an enlightenment for mankind, and a guidance and a mercy, that they might remember (or receive admonition). (43)\n\n\n\n\n \n\nThus it is clear that All the Dawat of Islam that Moses gave to Pharaoh and to the people were on the Basis of Sunnah, later on he received Book Torah.\n\n\nSimilar is the case with other Prophets, And Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) was blessed with Book Quran and Hikmah (the Sunnah).\n\n\nRevealing of the Hikmah\n\n\n \n\n\nAllah states in Surah an-Nisa chapter 4 verse 113\n\n\n\"For Allah hath sent down to thee the Book and wisdom and taught thee what thou knewest not (before); and great is the grace of Allah unto thee.\"\n\n\nAllah further states in Surah baqarah chapter 2 verse 231\n\n\n\"He sent down to you the Book and Wisdom for your instruction. And fear Allah and know that Allah is well acquainted with all things.\"\n\n\n\n\n \n\nIt is part of the blessing upon the believers that the Prophet taught them both the book (the Qur'an) and the Hikmah (the sunnah)\n\n\nSo it quite evident from the above proofs that all the Prophets were received revelation and Hikmah and these four were given Books which are actually named.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Agniveer states:\n\n\n2. If Allah wanted to only mention four books, then why did He not mention four books that were revealed in four different corners of the world? All four books He mentioned were all revealed in same area consisting of Israel, Egypt, and Arabia.\n\n\n3. More importantly, if Allah wanted to name any four books, why did He not give the name of the FIRST revelation? Logically, He should name the first, the last, and any two books in the middle eras, but that is not the case.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResponse:\n\n\nBrother, are you angry and disturbed, that, Allah (swt) didn't mention about the Vedas? It seems, so.\n\n\nThere is Hikmat (Wisdom) of Allah (swt) in this too. Allah (swt) is our creator. He knows what is best for us. He will not go and do things according to what you say or think. Your or mine logic is nothing compared to the logic of our creator.\n\n\nIf the revelations of the East would have been mentioned, then you would have argued why not the revelations of the West. If the first and the last and any two revelations in between would have been mentioned and still if you would not have found Vedas in it, then you would have demanded the remaining two then the remaining two, and this would have continued, until you would have demanded, the names of all revelations. Qur'an, answers and addresses only things which are important and which appeals to Human minds. It is a guide, a saviour. If Allah (swt) would have started to address every illogical unimportant question, then, the Qur'an would have been in thousands of volumes, and then also, you would have complained, that how can a divine book be so voluminous that it's difficult for people to study?\n\n\n \n\n\nAnd if the truth had been in accordance with their desires, verily, the heavens and the earth, and whosoever is therein would have been corrupted! Nay, We have brought them their reminder, but they turn away from their reminder. Qur'an 23:71\n\n\n\"…Man is ever hasty…\" Qur'an 17:11\n\n\n\"…Man is ever ungrateful…\" Qur'an 17:67\n\n\nAnd indeed We have put forth every kind of example in this Quran, for mankind. But, man is ever more quarrelsome than anything. Qur'an 18:54\n\n\nMan is created of haste, I will show you My Ayat (torments, proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.).So ask Me not to hasten (them).\n\n\nAnd they say: \"When will this promise (come to pass), if you are truthful.\"\n\n\nIf only those who disbelieved knew (the time) when they will not be able to ward off the Fire from their faces, nor from their backs; and they will not be helped.\n\n\nNay, it (the Fire or the Day of Resurrection) will come upon them all of a sudden and will perplex them, and they will have no power to avert it, nor will they get respite. Qur'an 21:37-40\n\n\n\n\n \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Agniveer states:\n\n\n4. Many Muslims claim Torah to be the first revelation of Islam, but then question comes, if Torah was revealed to Moses (Musa), then what revelations were revealed to the previous prophets that came before Moses like Abraham (Ibraheem), Noah (Nuh), and Adam??\n\n\n5. If there were no revelations given to them, then how can they be considered as prophets?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResponse:\n\n\nNo Muslim claims that Torah is the first revelation from Allah (swt). Regarding revelations to different prophets, it has already been answered Alhamdolillah. See answers to your question number 1,2,3.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Agniveer states:\n\n\n6. If Adam was the first prophet of Islam, then he should have got the first revelation from Allah, but Muslims consider Adam to be the first human created, not a messenger, then, question arises, why is he considered a prophet in the first place?\n\n\n7. If Adam was not given any revelation, how were the people, who lived in the era of Adam or a bit later, guided in the absence of any revelation?\n\n\n8. If Allah can give the name of the first prophet, why cannot He give the name of the first revelation, which is equally important?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResponse:\n\n\nAdam (peace be upon him) was the first of the Prophets, as it says in the hadeeth narrated by Ibn Hibbaan in his Saheeh, that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was asked about Adam – was he a Prophet? He said, \"yes, a Prophet to whom Allah spoke.\" But he was not an Apostle, because of the hadeeth about intercession which says:\n\n\n \n\n\n\nThe Book of Faith (Kitab Al-Iman) Muslim :: Book 1 : Hadith 378\n\nThey would come to Noah and would say: O Noah, thou art the first of the Apostles (sent) on the earth , and Allah named thee as a\" Grateful Servant,\" intercede for us with thy Lord.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nEvery Prophet was in someway or the other a messenger, because a Prophet is also commanded to call people, convey the Message and judge among the people. But not all prophets were Apostles. There is very little difference between the two.\n\n\nIbn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) says:\n\n\n \n\n\n\"A Prophet (Nabi) is one to whom Allah reveals (yanbi'uhu) something, and he passes on what Allah reveals to him. If he is sent with a Sharee'ah (Law) to convey a message from Allah to those communities of people who go against the commandments of Allah then he is an Apostle.\n\n\nBut if he follows a sharee'ah that came before him, and is not himself sent to anyone to convey the message from Allah to them, then he is a Prophet and not an Apostle…\" (al-Nubuwwaat, p. 255).\n\n\n\n\n \n\nApostle is one who is sent to a disbelieving nation with a new Sharee'ah (Law), and the Prophet is one who is sent to a believing people with the sharee'ah of the Messenger who came before him, to teach them and judge between them.\n\n\nThus, Adam (peace be upon him) was the first Prophet & Messenger of Allah, but he didn't bring any Sharee'ah (Law) as at that time people were not disbelievers, but believers.\n\n\nNoah (peace be upon him) was the Fist Prophet, Messenger and Apostle of Allah who came with a new Sharee'ah (Law).\n\n\nImaam Ibn Katheer (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his Tafseer (1\/256, ed. by Abu Ishaaq al-Juwayni), commenting on the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): فَتَلَقَّىٰٓ ءَادَمُ مِن رَّبِّهِۦ كَلِمَـٰتٍ۬ فَتَابَ عَلَيۡهِ‌ۚ إِنَّهُ ۥ هُوَ ٱلتَّوَّابُ ٱلرَّحِيمُ (٣٧)\n\n\n\"And He taught Adam all the names (of everything)…\" [al-Baqarah 2:31]\n\n\nThe words فَتَابَ عَلَيۡهِ‌ۚ  are Proof that Adam (a.s) was the Prophet and he also received revelation from God.\n\n\n\"The correct view is that Allah taught him the names of all things, what they are, and their qualities, right down to the noiseless fart, i.e., the names and qualities of all things, great and small.\n\n\n \n\n\n\nProphetic Commentary on the Qur'an (Tafseer of the Prophet (pbuh)) Sahih Bukhari :: Volume 6 :: Book 60 :: Hadith 3\n\nNarrated Anas: The Prophet said, \"On the Day of Resurrection the Believers will assemble and say, 'Let us ask somebody to intercede for us with our Lord.' So they will go to Adam and say, 'You are the father of all the people, and Allah created you with His Own Hands, and ordered the angels to prostrate to you, and taught you the names of all things; so please intercede for us with your Lord, so that He may relieve us from this place of ours.' Adam will say, 'I am not fit for this (i.e. intercession for you).' Then Adam will remember his sin and feel ashamed thereof. He will say, 'Go to Noah, for he was the first Apostle, Allah sent to the inhabitants of the earth.' They will go to him and Noah will say, 'I am not fit for this undertaking.'\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nThis Hadith clearly explains what were revealed to Adam (peace be upon him) and that Noah (peace be upon him) was the first Apostle of Allah who came with a new Sharee'ah.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAgniveer states:\n\n--This is the biggest proof that modern Quran is not from Allah, otherwise Allah would definitely give us the answers to these questions.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResponse:\n\n\nAll your big, bigger and biggest proofs were illogical. Those were points which would seem logical only to an illogical biased person.\n\n\nAnd there is nothing like The Glorious Quran, The only scripture to have survived the Test of Times.\n\n\nSee again answer to your question number 2,3. Still if you are not satisfied, then go through all the answers again and again.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Agniveer states:\n\n\nSome sensible Muslims like Syed Abdullah Tariq have accepted Vedas to be the first divine revelation while debating with Arya Samaj scholar Pandit Mahendra Pal Arya. However, there are some fanatics like Zakir Naikwho use their false interpretations to twist some verses of Vedas to prove Muhammad's prophecy in them, but later on doubt Vedas to be the word of God. So, in this case, Zakir Naik falls into his own trap. (Please see the article on prophet in Vedas on this same site). Interestingly, Maulana Abdullah Tariq is the prominent speaker of Peace TV of Zakir Naik! Its up to Zakir Naik, whether he accepts Vedas to be first divine revelation like his scholar Maulana Abdullah Tariq, or announce that Maulana Abdullah Tariq is not scholar and he has committed Shirk by giving Vedas the same status as Quran. Zakir should also apologize to Muslims that he has aired the programs of a Mushrik on his own Peace TV!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResponse:\n\n\nEven if Syed Abdullah Tariq has accepted Vedas to be the first divine revelation while debating with Arya Samaj scholar Pandit Mahendra Pal Arya, then I indeed feel that he was quite sensible and intelligent enough to fool you all in front of your face and you didn't even realize that.\n\n\nNot only Syed Abdullah Tariq, every Muslim believes that all the previous books, save the Qur'an, were corrupted and distorted with the passage of time. When Syed Abdullah Tariq said that Vedas were the first revelation, he was indirectly confirming and telling you all that, Vedas have corrupted because all previous revealed revelations have been distorted.\n\n\nThis is called Hikmat, brother. An intelligent reply.\n\n\nSo, stop boasting that Syed Abdullah Tariq accepted Vedas to be the first revelation, because, then you will be making a fool of yourself.\n\n\nWe don't twist the verses of any scriptures. The part which matches with the Qur'an, we agree that it is correct. The part which doesn't match, we reject. Because Qur'an is the Furqan, the criterion for any sensible person to judge right from wrong.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Agniveer states:\n\n\n1) Quran is sent because all earlier revelations have been corrupted by men over time and Quran is unchanged till now and will remain so forever.\n\n\nComments- a. Shia Muslims claim that original Quran was comprised of some 17000 verses. But now only small part of it is available. Sunnis destine Shia for hell for their claim and call them Kafirs. Vice versa is also seen. Can anyone tell, whose Quran is the final and why?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResponse:\n\n\nIf Shias claim such a thing then they are belying Allah's word, as Allah promises to guard the Qur'an from corruption.\n\n\n \n\n\n\nSurah Al-Hijr Chapter 15:9\n\n\"We have revealed this Dhikr and we will surely guard it from corruption\".\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nSo whatever any sect or a Muslim says, their saying will be accepted as far as it is in accordance with Quran and Sunnah.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Agniveer states:\n\n\nb. Khoza Muslims claim that Aaga Khan was also divine like Muhammad and he also got revelations.\n\n\nc. Qadiyanis even refuse to accept Muhammad as their final prophet! They say that Mirza Ghulam Ahmad Qadiyani is the final prophet of Islam. He was also supposed to get Allah's message on regular basis!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResponse:\n\n\nWill the practices\/social customs of Hindus be considered as a Proof for the religion? Similarly this is against the Quran and Sunnah, Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) was the last Messenger of God and it is agreed upon from Salaf to Khalaf.\n\n\n \n\n\n\nSurah Ahzab Chapter 33 Verse 40:\n\nMuhammad is not the father of any man among you, but he is the messenger of Allah and the Seal of the Prophets; and Allah is ever Aware of all things.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nImam Qurtubi (rah) the Muffasir of 671 Hijri writes by quoting Muffasir Ibn-e-Atiya (541 H):\n\n\nقال ابن عطية: هذه الألفاظ عند جماعة علماء الأمّة خَلَفاً وسلَفاً متلقّاةً على العموم التام مقتضية نصًّا أنه لا نبيّ بعده صلى الله عليه وسلم\n\n\nAmongst one Jammah of Ulema-e-Salaf to Khalaf these wordings are on their Generality and are clear on this and proves that there is no Prophet after Prophet Muhammad (s).\n\n\nImam Ibn-e-Jarir Tabari Commentator of the Quran of (310 H) writes :\n\n\nبكسر التاء من خاتـم النبـيـين، بـمعنى أنه ختـم النبـيـين\n\n\nFrom the Kasra of Taa the meaning of Khatim-ul-Nabiyin that Prophet Muhammad (s) has finised the coming of Prophets.\n\n\n \n\n\n\nSahih Bukhari\n\n(1) Narrated Abu Huraira: Allah's Apostle said, \"The Hour will not be established (1) till two big groups fight each other whereupon there will be a great number of casualties on both sides and they will be following one and the same religious doctrine, (2) till about thirty Dajjals (liars) appear, and each one of them will claim that he is Allah's Apostle.  (Book #88, Hadith #237)\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nThus it is proven that Muhammad (peace be upon him) was the last Prophet of God.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Agniveer states:\n\n\n2) Quran is the final message and others were not because Allah decided to reveal His knowledge in stages since the human mind evolves slowly.\n\n\nComments-a. So revelations came in stages because human mind was evolving. Can one ask, has human mind stopped evolving now? If no, then new revelation is needed. If yes, then how could most of the revolutionary inventions like electricity, trains and airplanes take place after more than 1000 years of reception of final revelation?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResponse:\n\n\nThere is nothing like this that human mind was evolving rather the Qur'an clearly states that All those Prophets which were sent previously were for that particular nation only but Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) has been sent for the whole of human kind see (Qur'an\n21:107). And Islam didn't come to teach you electricity or any revolutionary inventions, but rather it came to show and perfect the complete way of living life.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Agniveer states:\n\n\nb. Many verses of the Quran are said to be abrogated by the new ones during the lifetime of Muhammad. If abrogated verses were imperfect, Allah becomes imperfect. If abrogated verses too have the reason of human mind's evolution, it reflects unnatural evolution rate of Arabs because previous revelations like Injeel lasted for around 600 years, but in case of Quran, some verses were canceled within few years of their revelation!\n\n\nc. It seems human mind was evolving till Muhammad received the last abrogated verse of Quran and then all humans suddenly stopped evolving!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResponse:\n\n\nNone of the verses of Quran abrogates each other, but rather it abrogates previous Shariah, as i also explained above the Creed and Shariah.\n\n\nFor more about Theory of Abrogation read here :\n\n\nhttp:\/\/www.scribd.com\/doc\/8145615\/The-Theory-of-AbrogationFAQ-by-Dr-Zakir-Naik\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Agniveer states:\n\n\nd. In what way, did the human mind evolve from inception till today? Back then humans knew the same basic functions of nature and life as they do today. What new laws did Allah has told us in the Quran, which are not found in previous books? This silly claim helps fanatics like Zakir Naik to add the age of older books to increase the age of Islam, but they can never tell the world about the first Islamic revelation authentically. Our prime message for everyone is to return to Vedas since Quran teaches nothing new from Vedas. Every good thing that the Quran mentions is already present in Vedas.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResponse:\n\n\nThat's a whole new topic brother.\n\n\nYou say that Back then humans knew the same basic functions of nature and life as they do today.\n\n\nBut ,According to Vedas, the earth is static and this statement is repeated several times. The following is  some of the examples:\n\n\nThe God who made the earth stable (Yajur Ved 32\/6)\n\n\n\n\n\nPrajâpati settle upon the back of Earth. (Yajur Ved 13.24)\n\n\n\n\n\nVedas say The Bull has supported the Sky\n\n\n\"The Bull has supported the sky.\"\nYajur Ved: 4: 30\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are many such facts mentioned in the vedas, which are unscientific. We thought of not putting all of them, as it would choke your throat as well as the topic.\n\n\nSo, brother you see, with such illogical claims and unscientific facts mentioned in the Vedas, people really needed something logical and authentic. And people definitely are smarter, enough to judge the right from wrong. Which was not so earlier, and this is the reason they got fooled by the facts of the Vedas. Only a fool would desire to follow the inaccuracy of the Vedas, when he has the Qur'an.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Agniveer states:\n\n\nConclusively, we would like to say that the three Abrahamic religions follow the same mechanism. This mechanism is like a caterpillar that keeps gaining length as time progresses in the form of revelations. First, Jews introduced their Jewish scriptures, then Christians added their Bible and claimed it to be the final uncorrupted message of God. Now, Arabs added their Quran, and claimed it to be the final message of Allah since all the earlier revelations like Torah, Psalms, and Bible have been corrupted with the passage of time. Then we witnessed an offshoot of Islam, Qadiyani sect, which has its own final messenger in the form of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad Qadiyani. Today, everyone is confused, which Quran (of 6666 verses or 17000 verses…) is the final edition and which is not.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResponse:\n\n\nAgain he didn't give any authentic proof that how Arabs added Quran. And he contradicts himself because he says Every good thing that Quran mentions is already present in Vedas, then Vedas is also corrupted according to him since Quran is not revelation from God according to him so  neither should the Vedas be too.\n\n\nAnd nobody is confused with regards to the verses in the Quran as We wrote above and it is against the verse 15:9 which is a false belief. The Practice and Saying of any Muslim doesn't become the part of Islam neither of any Religion so don't put this Shia theory in Islam.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Agniveer states:\n\n\nFinally, if indeed Allah wanted Quran to be the final message for humans, why did He not ensure that the Quran is properly documented within lifetime of Muhammad itself? Why did he wait for at least 20 years after Muhammad's death for the Quran to get documented? Why did he make the Caliph who got Quran documented murdered by other followers of Islam? Why Muhammad's wife Aisha and his son-in-law Ali – two of the most prominent companions of Muhammad – bent on killing each other and the Caliph who documented the Quran? Why did he allow certain Hadiths which say that some verses of Quran were eaten by goats and some verses were uttered under influence of Satan?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResponse:\n\n\nFirst of All the whole Quran was written down under the guidance of Prophet Muhammad (s) in his life time, and he cross checked them by asking the writers to read out to him what they wrote. The compilation was done later on. Quran was already written down and there were memorizers of it already so whether Caliph compiled it later on it was already saved before that and killing of Caliph took place after the compilation of Quran. Does fighting amongst them has to do with the protection of Quran ? Neither Hazrat Ali nor Aisha said that we have different Quran. This is totally wrong and has no basis that some verses of Quran were eaten by goat and regarding Satan, also no references from Quran and Sunnah were provided to support such claim.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Agniveer states:\n\n\nIf Allah was serious enough to make Quran the only and the final word from Him, he would have ensured that thousands of copies of Quran would have been documented within Muhammad's lifetime itself so that no confusion can ever come. The way He ensured that Vedas be memorized in 8 different methods so that they can be cross-checked anytime and inspired us to start tradition of protecting Vedas which exists even till today.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResponse:\n\n\nAs for the Quran it was already written down at the time of Prophet (s), but nobody knows when were Vedas written down and when it was revealed. Regarding thousand copies, if one copy was enough for that time then why there is a need for thousand of copies. Moreover, at that time only and even today, there are innumerable number of people (Huffaaz) who have memorized the Qur'an and you can also cross – check anytime. Qur'an has been protected, guarded and well preserved both in words and memory, Alhamdolillah.\n\n\nNow having replied to all your illogical allegations, we would like to pose the same questions to you regarding your Vedas.\n\n\n\tWhen was actually the Vedas revealed because if it came down with the first human on earth, if not anything, then atleast the exact age would help us solve as to how old the earth is?\n\n\tWhat does it have to say about the first humans on earth?\n\n\tWhy were the Vedas revealed in and around the Indian subcontinent? Why not any other parts of the world?\n\n\tWhat does Vedas say about the revelations of the remaining continents? Because since you claim that the Vedas were the oldest revelations, then it would have been really difficult to access it, because there were no means of communications at that time.\n\n\tWhat and how did the people in the remaining parts of the world live without the guidance of the Vedas as it was revealed only to a particular place?\n\n\tWhy does the Vedas contain facts which go against established science?\n\n\tIf God was serious enough to make Vedas as the first and the last revelation, why did he not take the pain of presenting correct logical information in it?\n\n\nAnd many more question arises, but this is not the right topic to start with.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMay Allah (swt) protect us from such unbiasness and enlighten us with the real wisdom which did not have any versions following it – the Qur'an.\n\n\nMay Allah (swt) give hidaya (guidance) to every people and bring them closer to the truth.\n\n\n \n\n\nFinally few verses from the Glorious Qur'an Chapter 74 verses 49-56:\n\n\n49. Then what is wrong with them (i.e. the disbelievers) that they turn away from (receiving) admonition?\n\n\n50. As if they were frightened (wild) donkeys.\n\n\n51. Fleeing from a hunter, or a lion, or a beast of prey.\n\n\n52. Nay, everyone of them desires that he should be given pages spread out (coming from Allah with a writing that Islam is the right religion, and Muhammad SAW has come with the truth from Allah the Lord of the heavens and earth, etc.).\n\n\n53. Nay! But they fear not the Hereafter (from Allahs punishment).\n\n\n54. Nay, verily, this (Quran) is an admonition,\n\n\n55. So whosoever will (let him read it), and receive admonition (from it)!\n\n\n56. And they will not receive admonition unless Allah wills; He (Allah) is the One, deserving that mankind should be afraid of, and should be dutiful to Him, and should not take any Ilah (God) along with Him, and He is the One Who forgives (sins).\n\n\n\n\n \n\nWa akhiru dawa na Anilhamdu lillahi Rabbilalamin.\n\n\nInshaAllah Read more: http:\/\/www.systemoflife.com\/answering-islamophobes\/agniveer\/216-was-islam-a-revelation-of-allah#ixzz3duDGf9Im\n","publisher":{"@id":"#Publisher","@type":"Organization","name":"VedKaBhed.Com Fast Server","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"\/wp-content\/themes\/jannah\/assets\/images\/logo@2x.png"}},"sourceOrganization":{"@id":"#Publisher"},"copyrightHolder":{"@id":"#Publisher"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"\/index.php\/2015\/06\/23\/was-islam-a-revelation-of-allah\/","breadcrumb":{"@id":"#Breadcrumb"}},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"vedkabhed","url":"\/author\/vedkabhed\/"}}</script>
