Same is repeated in Al Imran 47 , Surate Nahal 40 and Surate Yaasin 82.\n1 a. Now a doubt is that who is 'him' in above verses. Whom does Allah says 'Kun'? The thing that was not present so far? What is the logic of addressing something that was not there in first place?\n<\/p> <p>Response: <\/p>\n<p>Surah Baqarah ,117﴿وَإِذَا قَضَى أَمْرًا فَإِنَّمَا يَقُولُ لَهُ كُنْ فَيَكُونُ  (When He decrees a matter, He only says to it : \"Be! ـ and it is.)\n<\/p>\n<p>Now we will see the word to word translation to it:\nWhen: وَإِذَا\nDecreed or judge: قَضَىٰ\nMatter: أَمْرًا\n(He) says to it: فَإِنَّمَا يَقُولُ\nTo be: لَهُ كُنْ\nAnd it is: فَيَكُونُ\n(Similar words in all ayah)\nSo, there is no him but it, in the mentioned verse.\n<\/p>\n<p>Allah says, \"And to Allâh belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth, and Allâh has power over all things.\"(3:189)\nThus, demonstrating His perfect complete ability and tremendous authority; if He decides a matter, He merely orders it to, 'Be' and it comes into existence. So exalted &amp; glorified is Allah.\n\"Know you not that Allâh is able to do all things?\" (2:106). <\/p> <p>Agniveer state\n1 b. Further, what is the need of even saying 'Kun'? Can't Allah bypass this redundant step and directly create what He wants to create?\n<\/p> <p>Response:\nThe answer is that Allah is not actually addressing anything but He is telling Mohammad (sal lallaho alaihi vassal lam) &amp; all after him, that, Allah carries out what He wishes or intend to. It is the explanation of His divine will.\nAl-Quran is not an allegorical interpretation (or an indirect speech) like other scriptures, which include human narrations. This is the example of speech in First person.\n<\/p> <p>Agniveer argues,\n1 c. Further, if this is the method of creation, why has this method suddenly stopped now? Why we do not hear 'Kun' anymore? What is the proof that this is the method of creation? Is there anything beyond blind belief that can justify such crazy concepts?\n<\/p> <p>Response:\nHow do you know that this method is been stopped?\nDoes anyone have heard 'Kun' before?\nSo do you think that like humans who have made god by their own hands, Allah should also make each &amp; every creation by His hand (note that there is no similarity between His &amp; our hand).\n<\/p>\n<p>http://www.systemoflife.com/answering-islamophobes/agniveer/200-allah-shapeless-or-limited\n<\/p> <p>2 a. Now one may ask how can one count days when there was no sun and hence no concept of day and night?\n<\/p> <p>Response:\nPrimarily, who had made the concept of day &amp; night? Does day &amp; night depends on clock?\nAllah says in Qur'an in Surah Anbiya, Ch. No. 21, Verse No. 33, (the translation to which is) 'It is Allah who has created the night and the day, the sun and the moon, each one rotating about its own axis.'\nNow, would anyone tell what the condition at poles is?\nThere is continuous light (or day) for 6 months &amp; continuous darkness (or night) for 6 months. So how can one calculate the duration of these? Even if there is sun, no one can count days (except by clock).\nMuslims believe for Allah it is all possible, since He is its Creator. (Not sure of the beliefs of hindus).\nAs for quoting from tafseer Husaini, it's the kind suggestion to all islamophobes to quote from authentic tafseer.\n<\/p> <p>agniveer state\n2b. Does that mean that even 'Kun' is said by Allah with patience over 6 days?\n2c. Also, when no one was present, and time is a relative concept, how shall one decide if creation in 6 days is an act of hurry or patience?\n<\/p> <p>Response:\nThe logic with which Agniveer argues, itself cancels. His point 2c contradicts 2b and seems to be stupidity.\nMoreover, Quran doesn't claim to either of the arguments. It's the author which is claiming, so he/she should be answerable.\n<\/p> <p>Agniveer states\n3. Interestingly, Surate Hum Sijda states that Allah made earth in 2 days, then took 4 days to make food, and then the seven skies were made in 2 days.\nThe total comes to 8 days. Now different scholars argue differently to prove that 8 days in this Surat is equal to 6 days in Surate Yunas. They keep fighting over this mathematical discrepancy, but that is not the subject of this article.\n<\/p> <p>Response:\nThis is a blatant lie.\nNo where in the Surat As-Sajda, does it is mentioned.\nIn As-Sajda, verse 4,\nAllâh it is He Who has created the heavens and the earth, and all that is between them in six Days. Then He Istawâ (rose over) the Throne (in a manner that suits His Majesty). You (mankind) have none, besides Him, as a Walî (protector or helper etc.) or an intercessor. Will you not then remember (or be admonished)?\nWhere does 8 days been mentioned? Agniveer must have checked before publishing on web. No where does in Quran, Allah mentions 8 days.\n<\/p> <p>3 a. Why suddenly Allah thought of creation, all of sudden? If creation is a power of Allah, why did he not execute this power earlier? Why was he not showing this power for infinite time and then showed for a while, and will stop forever after that? Is it that Allah's powers also keep changing like his mood and he was unable to create earlier? That means there is a supreme reality that controls even Allah. Or is he simply whimsical? Or imperfect? That seems so if we believe in modern Quran.\n<\/p> <p>Response:\nThe counter question can be posed that, then, why He EVER created? Why He Ever executed His power of creation?\nNothing controls Allah. He execute His will as suits His majesty. We do not say like hindus that, creation &amp; dissolution is continous process and Ishwar do not creates.\n<\/p>\n<p>Allah says in Al-Quran,:\n<\/p> \"But you cannot will, unless Allâh wills. Verily, Allâh is Ever All-Knowing, All-Wise.\"(76:30) \"And you will not, unless (it be) that Allâh wills, the Lord of the 'Alamîn (mankind, jinns and all that exists)\".(81:29) \"And even if We had sent down unto them angels, and the dead had spoken unto them, and We had gathered together all things before their very eyes, they would not have believed, unless Allâh willed, but most of them behave ignorantly.\" (6:111) \"And whomsoever Allâh wills to guide, He opens his breast to Islâm, and whomsoever He wills to send astray, He makes his breast closed and constricted, as if he is climbing up to the sky. Thus Allâh puts the wrath on those who believe not.\" (6:125) <p>How can something happen in His kingdom that He does not will? No belief is further astray than the belief that Allah wills a non-believer to believe, but He does not believe and his will prevails over the will of Allah. Far exalted is Allah above what these people allege.\nNow, some people may say that if Allah had willed we would have not done bad.\n<\/p>\n<p>This is mentioned in Quran,\n<\/p> Those who took partners (in worship) with Allâh will say: \"If Allâh had willed, we would not have taken partners (in worship) with Him, nor would our fathers, and we would not have forbidden anything (against His Will).\" (6:148) And they said: \"If it had been the Will of the Most Beneficent (Allâh), we should not have worshipped them (false deities).\" (43:20) <p>To which Allah says,\n<\/p> Likewise belied those who were before them, (they argued falsely with Allâh's Messengers), till they tasted of Our Wrath. Say: \"Have you any knowledge (proof) that you can produce before us? Verily, you follow nothing but guess and you do nothing but lie.\" (6:148) \"They have no knowledge whatsoever of that. They do nothing but lie!\" (43:20) <p>They fail to realize that if Allah Has willed, they could also have a worst situation. But Allah is all Merciful.\n \n<\/p>\n<p>Tafseer Ibn Katheer mentions in Surah Yaseen under ayah 67, that, Allah says,\n(And if it had been Our will, We would surely have wiped out their eyes, so that they would struggle for the path, how then would they see) 'Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn 'Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, explained it: \"Allah says, 'If We willed, We could have misguided them all away from true guidance, so how could they be guided'' And on one occasion he said, \"'We could have blinded them.'''\nAl-Hasan Al-Basri said, \"If Allah willed, He could have covered their eyes and made them blind, stumbling about.'' Mujahid, Abu Salih, Qatadah and As-Suddi said, \"So that they would struggle for the path, i.e., the right way.'' Ibn Zayd said, \"The meaning of path here is the truth -- 'How could they see when We have covered their eyes'''\nAl-'Awfi reported that Ibn 'Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him said: (how then would they see) \"They would not see the truth.\"\n(And if it had been Our will, We could have transformed them in their places.) Al-'Awfi reported that Ibn 'Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said; \"'We could have destroyed them.'' As-Suddi said, \"'We could have changed their form.'' Abu Salih said, \"'We could have turned them to stone.'' Al-Hasan Al-Basri and Qatadah said, \"'We could have caused them to sit on their feet.''\n<\/p> Allah says: (Then they would have been unable to go forward) meaning, move to the front; (nor they could have turned back.) meaning, move backwards. They would have remained static, unable to move forwards or backwards. <p>Whatever Allah wills happen &amp; whatever He does not will, does not happen.\nThus we believe what is been revealed to Prophet Mohammad (sal lal laho alaihi vasl lam). Quran is the only scripture, without human narration, &amp; which is unchanged from the day it's been revealed &amp; will continue to be as it is.\n<\/p> Allah says in Al-Quran, Surah Hijr, ayah 9 (the translation to which is), \"We have, without doubt, sent down the Message; and We will assuredly guard it (from corruption).\" <p>Agniveer sates\n \n<\/p>\n<p>b. Surate Room 10 says that Allah creates the Creation first, will do so again and then you shall return.Thus, powers of Allah would be waste and useless before and after this Creation for infinite time?\n<\/p> <p>Response:\nSurah Ar-Room!\nThe prediction made in the initial verses of this Surah is one of the most outstanding evidences of the Quran's being the Word of Allah and the Prophet Muhammad (sal lallaho alaihi vassal lam) being a true Messenger of Allah.\nThe verse which is been talked about is 11th &amp; not 10th.\n<\/p>\n<p>The tafseer (Ibn Kathir) of verses 11 &amp; 27,\n(And He it is Who originates the creation, then He will repeat it; and this is easier for Him.) Ibn Abi Talhah reported that Ibn 'Abbas said, \"This means it is easier for Him.'' Mujahid said: \"Repeating it is easier for Him than originating it, and originating it is easy for Him.'' This was also the view of 'Ikrimah and others.\nAl-Bukhari recorded that Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, said that the Prophet said: (Allah says; \"The son of Adam denied Me, and he had no right to do so. And he reviled Me, and he had no right to do so. As for his denying Me, it is his saying: 'He will not remake me as He originated me' -- while originating the creation is not easier for Me than re-creating him. As for his reviling Me, it is his saying: 'Allah has taken to Himself a son,' while I am the One, the Self-Sufficient Master; I beget not, nor was I begotten, and there is none comparable to Me.'')\nThe ayah talks about the creation, then recreation (after death when they will resurrect). Then the believers would dwell in heaven forever &amp; non-believers would burn in hell.\n<\/p> Allah says in Surah Al-Mulk, ayah 1 &amp; 2, \"Blessed is He in Whose Hand is the dominion, and He is Able to do all things. Who has created death and life, that He may test you which of you is best in deed. And He is the All-Mighty, the Oft-Forgiving.\" Allay says, \"And Allâh is Able to do everything\", (18:45); \"Nor is Allah to be frustrated by anything whatever in the heavens or on earth: for He is All-Knowing. All-Powerful\", (35:44); \"His Throne doth extend over the heavens and the earth, and He feeleth no fatigue in guarding and preserving them for He is the Most High, the Supreme (in glory)\", (2:255). <p>Agniveer states that, These anomalies do not remain in Vedic concept of creation.\n<\/p> <p>Response:\nNow seeing Quran without any error, lets for now only see what agniveer claims to 'as per vedas' (for which he didn't gave any reference...only stating 'satyarth prakash'..giving impression of it being most holier &amp; authentic then actual vedas):\n<\/p> <p>a.Creation and dissolution is a never-beginning never-ending process executed by shapeless and omnipresent Ishwar.\nb. Soul, Nature and Ishwar were always present and shall remain so. Thus Ishwar did not create Adam. He simply used existing matter to create universe, its various structures, and then integrated souls with various organic forms.\n<\/p> <p>Response:\nSoul, Nature &amp; Ishwar—Is it trinity?\nMost hindus thought that trinity is Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesh..\nSo Adam was either created instantaneously or spontaneously?\n<\/p>\n<p>Existing matter?? Who created this? Where it come from? It can be only possible if there is any other God than Ishwar of Hinduism!\n\"\nAnyhow, matter, souls and God are equally eternal and uncreate. God cannot create any more matter nor can He destroy any. Also He cannot create any new souls nor can He kill any that exist. \" If God creates new souls, the material out of which He creates them will be exhausted: for however much a treasure may be, it will sooner or later run out, if there be nothing but drawings upon it and no putting in it\" this is mentioned in sayarthaprakash even swami ji says that souls are immaterial,\"\n<\/p>\n<p>But the way he speaks of their creation out of material which could become exhausted if always drawn up and not added to, it would appear as if he believed them to be material after all. Also when Dayanand says that God is Almighty, that \"God stands in need of nobody's least help in doing His work of creation, preservation and destruction\", and, \"He accomplishes all His work out of His own infinite power\" is to be understood under the proviso that God's infinite power is powerless to create anything without having an abundant supply of matter ready to hand and a large supply of ready-made souls. God's work of creation is like that of a potter. He takes the dead matter, fashions forms out of them and puts the souls into those forms.\n<\/p> Allah says, \"He is the First (nothing is before Him) and the Last (nothing is after Him), the Most High (nothing is above Him) and the Most Near (nothing is nearer than Him). And He is the All-Knower of every thing.\" (57:3) <p>So hindu brothers come to real Ishwar, i.e., Allah.\n<\/p> <p>c. Ishwar does not do all this instantaneously. On contrary, it does so through its unchangeable laws which take their own time to complete.\n<\/p> <p>Response:\nBut previous point tells that Iswar did not create Adam? Then how was he created? It's a clear contradiction.\nWhat are these 'unchangeable laws' which agniveer is quoting? How much is this \"own time\"?\nSo according to Vedas, creation &amp; dissolution is the instantaneous process, without having Ishwar any major role?\nNote: There are enormous anamolies in Vedas, but it's just the refutation of what agniveer quoted in his article. <\/p>\n<p>Conclusion:\nThere is no role of Ishwar in Hinduism in making universe. Ishwar of Hinduism got everything prepared beforehand...means he didn't created anything.\nSo, one should follow Quran, the final revelation of Allah and not the contradictory scriptures.\nMuslims do not believe in spontaneous generation. Everything exists by the mercy of Allah.\n<\/p> Allah says in Quran, Surah Al-Araaf, Ayaah 54, (the translation to which is) \"Indeed, your Lord is Allah, Who created the heavens and the earth in Six Days, and then He rose over (Istawa) the Throne. He brings the night as a cover over the day, seeking it rapidly, and (He created) the sun, the moon, the stars subjected to His command. Surely, His is the creation and commandment. Blessed is Allah, the Lord of all that exists!\" <p>It is mentioned in Tafseer Ibn Katheer under this ayah, that:\nImam Ahmad recorded Abu Hurayrah saying: 'Allah's Messenger told me: \"Allah created the dust on Sunday, and He created the mountains on Sunday, and He created the trees on Monday, and He created the unpleasant things on Tuesday and He created the light on Wednesday and He spread the creatures through out it on Thursday and He created Adam after 'Asr on Friday. He was the last created during the last hour of Friday, between 'Asr and the night.\"\n<\/p>\n<p>As for Allah's statement,\n(and then He rose over (Istawa) the Throne) the people had several conflicting opinions over its meaning. However, we follow the way that our righteous predecessors took in this regard, such as Malik, Al-Awza'i, Ath-Thawri, Al-Layth bin Sa'd, Ash-Shafi'i, Ahmad, Ishaq bin Rahwayh and the rest of the scholars of Islam, in past and present times. Surely, we accept the apparent meaning of, Al-Istawa, without discussing its true essence, equating it (with the attributes of the creation), or altering or denying it (in any way or form). We also believe that the meaning that comes to those who equate Allah with the creation is to be rejected, for nothing is similar to Allah,\n(There is nothing like Him, and He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer.) (42:11).\n<\/p>\n<p>\nIndeed, we assert and affirm what the Imams said, such as Nu'aym bin Hammad Al-Khuza'i, the teacher of Imam Al-Bukhari, who said, \"Whoever likens Allah with His creation, will have committed Kufr. Whoever denies what Allah has described Himself with, will have committed Kufr. Certainly, there is no resemblance (of Allah with the creation) in what Allah and His Messenger have described Him with. Whoever attests to Allah's attributes that the plain Ayat and authentic Hadiths have mentioned, in the manner that suits Allah's majesty, all the while rejecting all shortcomings from Him, will have taken the path of guidance.''\n<\/p> <p>Part II: Creation of Human\n \n<\/p> <p>Agniveer SATES\nSurate Hazar 27 details process of creation of Human or Adam.\nIt says that Allah created Adam with clay using His two hands. And then He puffed\nHis soul into Adam\nNow this clay was created from nowhere by Allah by saying 'Kun'. Thus human or Adam does not have his own individual identity. It is made of clay (invention of Allah) and even its soul or Rooh is that of Allah. As we shall see further, this soul of Allah is corrupted and evil as per Quran. So really it is Allah who is evil, if modern Quran is to be believed.\n<\/p> <p>Response:\nIt is Surah Hijr &amp; not hazar.\nIt is mentioned in Tafseer Ibn Katheer, that, Allah says in Quran, Surah Al-Hijr, Ayah 28 &amp; 29,\nAnd (remember) when your Lord said to the angels: \"I am going to create a man (Adam) from dried (sounding) clay of altered mud. ''\n\"So, when I have fashioned him completely and breathed into him (Adam) of My spirit (the soul which I created for him,) then fall down, prostrating yourselves before him.''\nIt is already been mentioned that Allah created dust (alterd mud)...from which he created Adam.\nAnd Allah breathed the rooh (which was created for Adam) into him. Allah addressed it as 'My' to show that it was His creation.\nThe mud &amp; the soul was created for Adam. So this soul is not the soul of Allah as agniveer claims. So his statement falls.\n<\/p> <p>Agniveer states\nAs we already discussed in chapter of destiny, even the actions of Adam are pre-decided by Allah. Yet Allah goes a step ahead and states in Surate Ibrahim 27 that: In reality human is criminal and kafir because this tendency of crime and Kufra has been provided by Allah!\n<\/p> <p>Response:\nDoes islamophobe agniveer is out of his mind?\n<\/p> Allah says in Surah Ibrahim, Ayah 27, <p>\"Allah will establish in strength those who believe, with the word that stands firm, in this world and in the Hereafter; but Allah will leave, to stray, those who do wrong: Allah doeth what He willeth.\"\n<\/p>\n<p>Where are those verses which agniveer quoted? He is just fooling around.\n<\/p>\n<p>Though, for a sake of his argument, read this hadith in the reply:\nNarrated By 'Ali : While we were in a funeral procession in Baqi Al-Gharqad, Allah's Apostle came and sat down, and we sat around him. He had a small stick in his hand and he bent his head and started scraping the ground with it. He then said, \"There is none among you, and no created soul but has his place written for him either in Paradise or in the Hell-Fire, and also has his happy or miserable fate (in the Hereafter) written for him.\" A man said, \"O Allah's Apostle! Shall we depend upon what is written for us and give up doing (good) deeds? For whoever among us is destined to be fortunate (in the Hereafter), will join the fortunate peoples and whoever among us is destined to be miserable will do such deeds as are characteristic of the people who are destined to misery.\" The Prophet said, \"Those who are destined to be happy (in the Hereafter) will find it easy and pleasant to do the deeds characteristic of those destined to happiness, while those who are to be among the miserable (in the Hereafter), will find it easy to do the deeds characteristic of those destined to misery.\" Then he recited: 'As for him who gives (in charity) and keeps his duty to Allah and believes in the Best reward from Allah, We will make smooth for him the path of ease. But he who is a greedy miser and thinks himself self sufficient, and gives the lie to the Best reward from Allah we will make smooth for him the path for evil.' (Quran, 92.5-10).\n(Bukhari, Volume 6, Hadith Number 473).\n<\/p>\n<p>We will discuss more about the predestination (Qadr), in footnote to this article.\n<\/p>\n<p>Agniveer then indeed does a great blasphemy by saying:\n<\/p> <p>Now the big doubt is that if Allah is so perfect, pure and noble, why did so many defects come in what was purely created by Him and from Himself? And why is soul of humans, which is actually soul of Allah criminal? And if that be so, how can a criminal Kafir Allah be benevolent and loving?\n<\/p> <p>Response:\nThe soul of human is not that of Allah (but His creation)..See the explanation before.\nAgain this is the matter of Qadr, which couldn't be discussed here itself (being it to be vast topic altogether). A brief report is been presented in conclusion of this part.\nMay Allah guide &amp; forgive him.\n<\/p>\n<p>Now see the vedic concept of creation as given by agniveer.\n(Lets not get into details of verses of Vedas, let for now only focus on satyarth prakash, which agniveer quotes, for he view it as more holier than Vedas.)\n<\/p>\n<p>\na. Soul is an unborn and undying entity.\nMeans in Hinduism, soul can be supposed to be God. And why not, it is the part of trinity after all. So soul is parallel to God according to hinduism!\n<\/p>\n<p>b. It takes birth in various life-forms including humans as per its level of ignorance/ knowledge.\nBirth? Soul was supposed to be unborn &amp; undying entity or more simply God!\nLevel of ignorance/knowledge of souls or humans?\nIf it is human then how come he had any when he is inanimate. May be author meant 'of souls', so lets have a benefit of doubt for him.\n<\/p>\n<p>d. Based on the acts we perform, we develop tendencies or sanskaars which are attached to soul.\nBut soul was supposed to be having its 'level of ignorance/knowledge'.\nNow its very confusing, what is important, whether it is \"acts we perform\" which get attached to souls as \"tendencies or sanskaars\" or soul's own \"level of ignorance/knowledge\".\n<\/p>\n<p>e. Even after we die, we take a new birth as per these sanskaars and continue our journey forever.\nDo we continue our journey in the same physical body or it's the journey of soul?\nIf its Yoni concept (which is most popular) then it means same soul travels from cockroaches to lizard to eagle to cat to tiger to human? So when human dies, then what he/she becomes?\nSo the soul's 'level of ignorance/knowledge' is been overcome by 'acts we perform' or 'sanskaars'. The acts of cockroaches becomes the sanskaars or tendencies (tendency to live on garbage) and so on.\n<\/p>\n<p>f. Soul has limited potential for knowledge and hence is prone to ignorance. This ignorance causes difference in personalities. When ignorance is eradicated beyond a threshold through our efforts, we obtain ultimate bliss or Moksha.\nSo finally, according to hinduism, Ishwar is idle. Every matter is been controlled by soul itself. And why not according to them it is part of trinity! They have ridiculed themselves.\nMay Allah guide us all.\n<\/p>\n<p>Conclusion:\nAccording to Hinduism, Adam was created spontaneously from the unknowingly available pre-existing matter (may be it was the part of trinity!).\nMuslim believe, indeed it is Allah who Has created Adam.\n<\/p>\n<p>Allah says,\n\"Is then He Who creates like one that creates not? Will ye not receive admonition?\nIf ye would count up the favours of Allah, never would ye be able to number them: for Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.\" (16:17-18)\n<\/p> Allah is the One Who independently and exclusively creates and controls all things, and have no partner, associate or advisor in that. There is no concept of trinity in Islam. <p>There are two types of Will. One is concerned with something that Allah does Himself; the other is concerned with something that He wants someone else to do. Command is concerned with the second, not the first. It is clear that His creation of their acts, or the acts of other creatures, something different from His Enjoining upon them the laws that will secure their well being and save them from misery.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nWhen, for example, He commands Pharoah, Abu Lahab, or anyone else to believe in Him, He explains to them what course to them would be beneficial and what course would be harmful to them. But this does not mean that He will also help them carry out His commands. On the contrary, when He creates any act of theirs or helps them to effect it, it may involve something harmful to them. To be sure, all that He creates has a purpose. But it is not necessary that that what He has commanded man to do and what is good for them when they carry it out should also be good for Allah when He Himself does it or makes them to do it. The two aspects, the creative and the prescriptive, are not one.\n<\/p>\n<p>It happens that sometimes we ask a person to do or not to do something and our intention is nothing but to do Him good, which we even explains to hem; nevertheless we do not want to help him to do it. It is not necessary that if it is good for me to advice someone to do something for his good it would also be good for me to help him do it. It may even be in my best interest to oppose the act. The two aspects are quite different: to do advise someone sincerely to do something is one thing, and to do it oneself is another. Therefore, if it is possible to distinguish between these two aspects in the human context, it is much more and correct to make that distinction in the divine context.\n<\/p>\n<p>If Allah commands someone to do something and helps him carry it out, He will be both creating it and commanding it. It will be the object of His creative will as well as His perspective will. But if He does not help in the performance of the act, it will only be the object of His command, not of creation. It will be wise not to create it; it may even be wiser to create its opposite. Obviously, the creation of one of the contraries rules out the creation of the other. For example, if He creates an illness that leads a person to submit to Him, repent for his sins and seek His forgiveness, softens his heart, lower his vanity, do away with his arrogance and rebellion, that would be in contradiction to the creation of health which would not lead to all these good consequences.\nIt is been discussed more later in Footnote to the article.\n<\/p>\n<p>Allah says in Quran,\n<\/p> \"Allah doth wish to make clear to you and to show you the ordinances of those before you; and (He doth wish to) turn to you (In Mercy): And Allah is All-knowing, All-wise.\" (4:26) \"Allah doth not wish to place you in a difficulty, but to make you clean, and to complete his favour to you, that ye may be grateful.\"(5:6) Say: \"If the ocean were ink (wherewith to write out) the words of my Lord, sooner would the ocean be exhausted than would the words of my Lord, even if we added another ocean like it, for its aid.\" (18:109) \"Lord of the Throne of Glory, Doer (without let) of all that He intends.\"(85:15-16) That is our Lord. \"..Thus Allah does whatever he wills.\" (3:40). <p>Allah is knowledgeable of everything, Most Wise about His creation, and He makes the wisest decisions, and He teaches and deprives whom He wills from knowledge. Verily, Allah's wisdom and justice in all matters is perfect.\n<\/p> <p>\n<p>Part III : Story of Satan\n<\/p> <p>Agniveer states Ayah 34-36 of Surah Baqarah, and argues that,\nSurate Bakar 34 states that Allah ordered angels to bow to Adam and they did\nso. But Satan refused and showed pride because Satan was a Kafir.\nBut the question is that since Satan was also created by Allah, why did Allah make\nhim a Kafir and not a saint?\nWhen Satan was created by Allah then why he was expelled? Why Adam &amp; Eve was given paradise? Destiny of satan? Etc..\n<\/p> <p>Response:\nAllah says in Surah Baqarah, ayah 34-36\n<\/p> \"And behold, We said to the angels: \"Bow down to Adam\" and they bowed down. Not so Iblis: he refused and was haughty: He was of those who reject Faith.\" We said: \"O Adam! dwell thou and thy wife in the Garden; and eat of the bountiful things therein as (where and when) ye will; but approach not this tree, or ye run into harm and transgression.\" Then did Satan make them slip from the (garden), and get them out of the state (of felicity) in which they had been. We said: \"Get ye down, all (ye people), with enmity between yourselves. On earth will be your dwelling-place and your means of livelihood - for a time.\" <p>Tafseer of these ayah is enough to refute any claim made by agniveer or his/her type (had he consulted it before!).\n<\/p>\n<p>\nIbn Katheer mentions under tafseer of this ayah,\nThis Ayah mentions the great honor that Allah granted Adam, and Allah reminded Adam's offspring of this fact. Allah commanded the angels to prostrate before Adam, as this Ayah and many Hadiths testify..\nIblis was among Those ordered to prostrate before Adam, although He was not an Angel.\nWhen Allah commanded the angels to prostrate before Adam, Iblis was included in this command. Although Iblis was not an angel, he was trying - and pretending - to imitate the angels' behavior and deeds, and this is why he was also included in the command to the angels to prostrate before Adam. Satan was criticized for defying that command.\nSimilarly, Muhammad bin Ishaq reported that Ibn 'Abbas said, \"Before he undertook the path of sin, Iblis was with the angels and was called 'Azazil.' He was among the residents of the earth and was one of the most active worshippers and knowledgeable persons among the angels. This fact caused him to be arrogant.\nQatadah commented on Allah's statement,\n(And (remember) when We said to the angels: \"Prostrate yourselves before Adam.'')\n\"The obedience was for Allah and the prostration was before Adam. Allah honored Adam and commanded the angels to prostrate before him.'' Some people said that this prostration was just a prostration of greeting, peace and honor. <\/p>\n<p>The practice of prostrating was allowed for previous nations, but was repealed for ours. Mu'adh said to the Prophet , \"I visited Ash-Sham and found that they used to prostatebefore their priests and scholars. You, O Messenger of Allah, are more deserving of prostration.'' The Prophet said, \"No. If I was to command any human to prostrate before another human, I would command the wife to prostrate before her husband because of the enormity of his right on her.\"\n<\/p>\n<p>The following is recorded in the Sahih,\n(No person who has the weight of a mustard seed of arrogance in his heart shall enter Paradise.)\nIblis had disbelief, arrogance, and rebellion, all of which caused him to be expelled from the holy presence of Allah, and His mercy.\nThen human was honoured again when Allah allowed Adam &amp; Eve to live and eat wherever and whatever they wished in Paradise.\n<\/p>\n<p>Allah's statement to Adam,\n(but come not near this tree) is a test for Adam. There are conflicting opinions over the nature of the tree mentioned here. Imam Abu Ja'far bin Jarir said, \"The correct opinion is that Allah forbade Adam and his wife from eating from a certain tree in Paradise, but they ate from it. We do not know which tree that was, because Allah has not mentioned anything in the Qur'an or the authentic Sunnah about the nature of this tree. It was said that it was barley, grape, or a fig tree. Yet, this is knowledge that does not bring any benefit, just as being ignorant in its nature does no harm. Allah knows best.''\n<\/p>\n<p>\nHeaven was the honour given to Adam &amp; Eve, for they were excellent of the creations of Allah, which is evident since Allah ordered angels to honour His creation (Adam) by prostrating.\n<\/p>\n<p>Allah gives to those whom He wills. Its already been discussed in part I.\nThe Ishwar of arya samajis do not have this divine will. They do according to knowledge of souls! <\/p> <p>Agniveer states\nb. Why did Allah make Satan enemy of Adam?\nc. Who is the primary source of sin of Satan when Satan, his actions and his destiny have been designed by Allah himself and no one else?\nd. By the way, what is meant by 'going close to a tree'? How close is 'going close'. One mm, one cm, one inch or what? Because if creation in one second can be hurry, and in 6 days be patience, then one mm may be far off and one nm be too close?\n(That was merely a digression for those who correlate Islam with science) <\/p> <p>Response:\nSatan was created itself to test human being. So Allah has warned whole humanity beforehand.\nTo train or test the soldiers, they are been exposed to hard practice sessions including mock drill (with all real dangers); so would anyone ask why these drills are been designed? Obviously, to test the soldiers.\nTo get much better insight into the purpose of creation of Iblis, see footnote in this article.\nWell, if anyone has fever he's been told to not to go near cold water. Then how close is this going? It means that one must refrain from drinking it.\n<\/p> <p>Agniveer states: \n3. Surat Swad 75-81 explain the story of Satan's curse.\n(then he quotes the poor translation of the verses).\nAllah said: O Satan, why do you refuse to bow to whom I myself have created with\nboth my hands. Were you arrogant or exalted?\nSatan said: I am exalted because you made me with Fire but made Adam with clay.\nAllah said: You are wretched and you should get out of the sky. You shall be\ncondemned till Day of Judgment.\nSatan said: O Allah, give me some concession.\nAllah agreed. Then Satan promised that by grace of Allah he shall mislead them all\nexcept the chosen ones of Allah till doomsday.\n<\/p>\n<p>Now again several questions come in mind:\na. Why Allah got angry with Satan when Satan used his power that was gifted by Allah himself?\nb. Why was Satan created to be arrogant? Or was it mistake of Allah? (Allah is kind and pure after all!)\n<\/p> <p>Response:\nThese verses itself cleared everything.\nSurah Saad, Ayah 75-84\n<\/p>\n<p>Tafseer Ibn Katheer mentions under this ayah,\nAllah mentions this story in Surat Al-Baqarah, at the beginning of Surat Al-A'raf, in Surat Al-Hijr, Al-Isra', Al-Kahf and here. Before creating Adam, peace be upon him, Allah told the angels that He was going to create a human being from sounding clay of altered smooth black mud. He told them that when He finished creating and forming him, they were to prostrate to him as a sign of honor and respect, and out of obedience to the command of Allah, may He be exalted. All of the angels obeyed this command except for Iblis, who was not one of them. He was one of the Jinn, and his nature betrayed him at his time of greatest need. He refused to prostrate to Adam, and he disputed with his Lord about him, claiming that he was better than Adam, because he was created from fire while Adam was created from clay, and fire was better than clay, or so he said. He made a mistake by doing this, and he went against the command of Allah, thus committing the sin of disbelief. So Allah exiled him, humiliated him, and cast him out of His mercy and His sacred Presence, and called him \"Iblis'' symbolizing that he had Ablasa min Ar-Rahmah (despaired of mercy) -- that there was no hope for him of mercy. He cast him down from the heavens, disgraced and rejected, to the earth. Iblis asked Allah to give him a reprieve until the Day of Resurrection, so the Forbearing One, Who does not hasten to punish those who disobey Him, gave him a reprieve. When he knew that he was safe from destruction until the Day of Resurrection, he rebelled and transgressed.\n(Allah) said: \"O Iblis! What prevents thee from prostrating thyself to one whom I have created with my hands? Art thou haughty? Or art thou one of the high (and mighty) ones?\"\n<\/p>\n<p>Iblis ﴾said: \"By Your might, then I will surely mislead them all, except Your true servants amongst them).''\nFor which, (Allah) said: \"Then it is just and fitting- and I say what is just and fitting.\n(Surah Saad, ayah 84)\n<\/p> This means that Iblis knew for what purpose it was created. Iblis knew that there would be day of Recompense (then too it is inclined to be on wrong path)...and this is the sign of disbeliever. <p>That's why Allah said, \"That I will certainly fill Hell with thee and those that follow thee,- every one.\" (Surah Saad, ayah 84)\n<\/p> See, even with these warning, if someone, do not want to correct himself, then what could be done? <p>Entire passage speaks about Satan's refusal in bowing to Prophet Adam (AS), just because of his arrogance. Allah (SWT) did order Satan to do something, which he was too arrogant to do and that is why Satan went astray. Indeed, that is not the doing of Allah (SWT) but the doing of his own arrogance.\n<\/p>\n<p>If the owner of a restaurant orders his workers to cook, and one of them refuses (because he is arrogant) but the owner keeps persisting, then rejects him, whose fault is that? Is it the owner's fault or the worker who did not perform his duty? This scenario speaks for itself in showing that Allah (SWT) did not lead Satan astray, but it was his own arrogance that led him astray, just like in the scenario I mentioned, it is not the restaurant owner who led the cook off track but his own arrogance.\n<\/p> <p>c. Why will sons of Adams be cursed for arrogance of Satan? What is their fault?\n<\/p> <p>\nResponse:\nNo where, did Allah said that the sons of Adam would suffer for the arrogance of Iblis. Is agniveer dreaming?\n<\/p>\n<p>Infact Allah says in Surah Al-Anaam, Ayah 164, \"No person earns any (sin) except against himself (only), and no bearer of burdens shall bear the burden of another. Then unto your Lord is your return, so He will tell you that wherein you have been differing.\"\n<\/p>\n<p>And in Sural Al-Isra, ayah 15, that, \"Whoever goes right, then he goes right only for the benefit of his ownself. And whoever goes astray, then he goes astray to his own loss. No one laden with burdens can bear another's burden. And We never punish until We have sent a Messenger (to give warning).\"\n<\/p>\n<p>And in Sural Faatir, ayah 35, that, \"And no bearer of burdens shall bear another's burden,\"\nAnd in Surah Az-Zumar, ayah 7 and in Surah An-Najm, Ayah 38.\n<\/p> <p>Agniveer states,\nd. Even the chosen ones are pre-decided by Allah. So where is the scope for others to do good? They are merely stooges in this great conspiracy between Allah and Satan!\n<\/p> <p>Response:\nIf any teacher loves you and says that since you are a bright student you are going to top in coming examination, then will you not study?\nAs is evident by many authentic hadeeth, we should not depend on what is been written, but we have to do our best at our level.\nThere is a very famous idiom, \"God help those who help themselves\".\nWe would discuss later in the footnote the matter of Qadr, in detail.\n<\/p> <p>Agniveer states,\ne. Finally, Allah himself says that bow to none other then Allah. Hence, if Satan refused to counter this order of Allah to bow only to Him, Allah should ideally have rewarded him. How would poor Satan know that the Allah who is asking him to bow to Adam is the real Allah or a fake Allah?\n(After all if Allah can do anything, it can also create a fake Allah and fool Satan! It can also create another Allah who can kill previous Allah! Thus poor Satan had to pay the price of being loyal to his original father!)\n<\/p> <p>Response:\nThis bowing is not that of reverence, as been previously shown. It was just an order.\nFor example, every parent tells their children to wake early at morning, but if a child is ill, then his/her parent them self ask him/her to sleep. So it means that they are fake parents? Actually, the order depends on what is good for the addressee. One should not weigh everything on a same balance.\n<\/p> <p>4. Allah goes a step ahead and warns humans in Surate Bakar 168-169 that they should not follow Satan. He is their enemy and will guide them to evil and shameful acts.\nNow Allah is the greatest villain here.\na. He should not have created Satan in first place.\nb. If he had to create Satan, he should have not made him enemy of humans.\nc. If Satan had to become our enemy as per Allah's will but did a mistake, Allah should not have allowed him the chance to misguide humans. Allah could have simply pardoned him but what was the point of giving him permission to misguide poor humans made out of mud?\nd. And if all the above was necessary, he should have at least given humans multiple births so that they get ample time to learn Arabic, mug up Quran, analyze Quran, and then practice avoiding Satan.\ne. Finally, he should not have tested and punished Satan for his loyalty to original order of Allah.\n<\/p> <p>Response:\nAllah is Ar-Rahman Ar-Raheem.\n\"O mankind! Eat of that which is lawful and good on the earth, and follow not the footsteps of Shaitân (Satan). Verily, he is to you an open enemy.\nFor he commands you what is evil and shameful, and that ye should say of Allah that of which ye have no knowledge.\" (2:168-169)\n<\/p> Which test taker would tell you the clue of answering? Which examiner would warn you against the common mistakes? Which scrutinizer will tell you about the difficulties of examination when you are on it? Alhumdulillah. It is none but Allah (the Glorified &amp; Exalted is He). For more logical explanation of the purpose of creation of satan read the footnote of the article. <p>Agniveer states,\n5. In Surate Aaraf 16,17,18 Allah Miyan warns that He shall fill Hell with those who follow Satan.\nAnd argues that,\nAgain,\na. If Allah can do anything by saying 'Kun', why did he not make Satan a saint?\nb. Why did he allow Satan the permission to misguide people, if Satan was a villain.\n<\/p> <p>Response:\nWhat Allah wills happen and what He does not will, does not happen. Purpose of creation of satan is been discussed in footnote.\n<\/p> <p>c. If Allah has already decided to fill the Hell, written down everything in book called Lohe Mahfooz, and is now merely following the same, what is the fault of Kafirs except that Allah is whimsical?\n<\/p> <p>Response:\nThose who do not want to put any effort, come up with these excuses. It's like saying, that the food is been destined to be eaten, so it would fly &amp; would directly come into our mouth!\nFor for-ordainment (Qadr) refer footnote to the article.\n<\/p> <p>d. If Allah created such a defective Satan, who would be nuisance for whole world forever, how can Allah be perfect and expert.\nYet Allah falsely claims in Surate Nahal 9 that I am extremely perfect!\n<\/p> <p>Response:\nOnly, Allah who Creates, provides sustenance, Test, Forgive, Punish, could be Perfect.\nTruly, Ishwar of arya samajis cannot be perfect, since his power is limited. He cannot create, cannot test, cannot forgive, cannot punish. It seems that his existence is useless!\n<\/p> <p>Agniveer states,\n6. Surate Hazar Ayat 9 clarifies even further. Satan says that he shall misguide everyone because Allah misguided Satan.\n<\/p> <p>Response:\nAgniveer is out of his/her mind. No where in Quran did Allah said that He (Himself) misguided satan, leave alone 15:9.\n<\/p> <p>And Allah gives the permission to misguide! He states in Surate Mariyam 84 that don't you see that I have sent Satan to misguide Kafirs by agitating them?\nThis means it was a conspiracy between Allah and Satan. Kafirs are merely guinea pigs suffering in this sinister game.\n<\/p> <p>Response:\nIt is been returned in Tafseer Ibn Katheer under, ayah 84 of Surah Maryam,\n<\/p>\n<p>Concerning Allah's statement,\n(See you not that We have sent the Shayatin against the disbelievers to push them to do evil.) 'Ali bin Abi Talhah said that Ibn 'Abbas said, \"They will lead them astray with temptation.'' Al-'Awfi said that Ibn 'Abbas said, \"They will incite them against Muhammad and his Companions.'' Qatadah said, \"They will harass them and disturb them until they disobey Allah.'' Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd said, \"This is similar to Allah's statement,\n(And whosoever turns away blindly from the remembrance of the Most Gracious, We appoint for him a Shaytan to be a companion for him.)'' (43:36)\n<\/p> This means that whosoever is bent upon disbelieve, satan would incite him more. (That's what bad friends do). <p>Agniveer then states the vedic story of satan,\n3. As per Vedas, the only Satan is our own ignorance. We can curb it through open-mindedness, rationality and efforts.\n<\/p> <p>Response:\nBut previously, agniveer said that soul take birth with its level of ignorance/knowledge.\nSo it means that every soul has satan or a level of satan! He also claims that soul is undying entity (remember he had claimed that it takes Birth too!). Then what actually is soul? Is it eternal satan?\nTo make it easy for us to understand, take the analogy of poison. Allah created poison as well as its cure. Likewise, He created Satan but even told us the cure, which is servitude to Allah by following the path of His Prophets.\n<\/p>\n<p>For agniveer to say that God is powerless before Satan just because He granted him respite is illogical. There are billions of people who do not believe in the Vedas and consider them a source of Idol worship, but still God provides them food, air, water, etc to survive. If we reverse the question on you that is your Ishwar helpless against them, what would you say?\n<\/p>\n<p>Let us now turn to the Vedas on the question of evil. agniveer has not even understood his own Vedas properly as will be clear very soon.\n<\/p>\n<p>The Yajur Veda mentions in Chapter 30 how Ishwar created various professions of the sinner and the saints. For example, it says\n<\/p> <p>The Mantras are saying, that like a Brahmin who has been created for Preisthood, Ishwar has also created the harlot for pastime and Kama (erotic love), thus giving legitimacy to it. For all jobs He has created the people, according to these mantras of the Vedas. According to the Hindu conception, the harlot has been made a harlot depending on her deeds in the previous birth. Why will an omnipotent Ishwar (?) create or allow such a profession, which is a source of misguidance for millions? <\/p>\n<p>From these professions, the good and the evil, mentioned in this chapter of Yajur Veda, there can be three reasons why evil professions exist:\n<\/p>\n<p>1. Either God does not want to stop evil, or\n<\/p>\n<p>2. He wants to stop evil but is unable to stop it,or\n<\/p>\n<p>3. There is some wisdom in allowing them for some time\n<\/p> Now I leave it to agniveer to answer these questions. When they will respond only then do they deserve to ask us. <p>4. Ishwar has no villainous role to play in this. Ishwar simply provides us the best situations to eradicate our ignorance depending upon our current level of ignorance and direction of our efforts. He continuously manages this optimization process.\n<\/p> <p>Response:\nDo their Ishwar has ANY role to play?\nHow these best situations are been provided? What are their sources?\nEradicating ignorance by the ignorance?\nSo pessimistic religion they have made for themselves!\n<\/p>\n<p>Conclusion:\n \n<\/p> Agniveer is not aware of the principles and teachings of Islam, and then too, he is following his whim &amp; ego to malign Islam. His all claims have been refuted. Moreover, Agniveer try to represent Hinduism as a worshipper of formless single God, but, he believes soul &amp; nature to be present as eternally as Ishwar. For him, Ishwar does not create anything &amp; just take rest and so, universe and human have been created spontaneously (happens by own-'creation and dissolution process'). Muslims believe in Al-Quran, the final &amp; perfect word of Allah, in which Allah says, <p>\"Verily, We have created all things with Qadar (Divine Preordainments of all things before their creation, as written in the Book of Decrees Al-Lauh Al-Mahfûz).\" (54:49)\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\"Glory be to Him, Who has created all the pairs of that which the earth produces, as well as of their own (human) kind (male and female), and of that which they know not.\" (36:36)\n\"And Who has created all the pairs and has appointed for you ships and cattle on which you ride.\" (43:12)\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\"Should not He Who has created know? And He is the Most Kind and Courteous (to His slaves) All-Aware (of everything).\"(67:14)\n<\/p>\n<p>\"And with Him are the keys of the Ghaib (all that is hidden), none knows them but He. And He knows whatever there is in (or on) the earth and in the sea; not a leaf falls, but he knows it. There is not a grain in the darkness of the earth nor anything fresh or dry, but is written in a Clear Record. It is He, Who takes your souls by night (when you are asleep), and has knowledge of all that you have done by day, then he raises (wakes) you up again that a term appointed (your life period) be fulfilled, then in the end unto Him will be your return. Then He will inform you what you used to do.\" (6:59-60)\n<\/p> It's a kind request to hindu brothers and sisters, that they should return to the truth. Having seen the absurd philosophy of making soul and nature as eternal as ishwar, Arya samajis are left with two options: <p>2.Accept openly that they are atheist. Reason being that they do not consider God to be able to do all things. They have doubts of His power and their belief set partners with Him.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n3.Accept Islam and become our brother and sister. They will have equal rights. Accept the control of Allah over all things and accept the Mohammad as the seal of Prophets and the last &amp; final revelation Al-Quran.\n<\/p>\n<p>Thus,\n\"Truth has (now) arrived, and Falsehood perished: for Falsehood is (by its nature) bound to perish.\" (17:81)\n<\/p> <p>\n<p>\n<p> Footnotes\n<\/p>\n<p>Qadr and creation of Iblis\nAbout Qadr, Al-Qurtubi quoted Ibn Abdul_barr who said, \"If anyone asks for reasons in order to increase his knowledge, remove his ignorance or gain insight into the religion, there is no harm in that. But whoever asks in a spirit of defiance and not for the sake of learning or gaining insight, which is forbidden, no matter how little or much he should ask.\"\n<\/p>\n<p>\nA discussion for the understanding of Qadr, without getting into too much discussion as it is difficult or impossible for man to understand the wisdom that lies behind Allah's creation or His command:\nFore-ordainment (Qadr) is a secret that Allah Has not disclosed to any of His creatures. He creates and destroys, makes poor and makes rich, gives death and gives life, misleads and guides. Ali (raziAllah anhu) said. \"Qadr is Allah's secret, so do not try to uncover it.\"\nAhl as-Sunnah wa al-Jamah believe that everything is according to Allah's ordainment and measure. Allah says, \"Verily, all things have We created in proportion and measure.\"(54:49); and, \"It is He who created all things, and ordered them in due proportions.\" (25:2)\nAllah wills and decrees infidelity from the disbelievers. He is not pleased with it or nor does He like it, but that is His will with respect to creation (and allowing that thing), but He is not pleased with it as a way of life.\n<\/p>\n<p>In his prayers, the Prophet Mohammad (sal lallaho alaihi vassal lam) used to say, \"O Allah, I seek refuge in Your pleasure from Your anger, and I seek refuge in your forgiveness from your punishment, and I seek refuge in You from You.\"\n<\/p>\n<p>\nConsider how the Prophet Mohammad (sal lallaho alaihi vassal lam) used to seek refuge in the attribute of pleasure from the attribute of anger, and from the action of forgiveness from the action of punishment. The first is for an attribute and the second for the consequences of an attribute. Then he tied them all together with His essence. He is in fact saying: \"What I seek refuge from happens by your decree &amp; will, and what I seek refuge in is your pleasure and forgiveness, that also depend on Your decree &amp; will. If You like to be kind to Your servant, you may forgive him. If You will to be angry to Him, You may punish him. Save me, therefore, from what You do not like and guard me against it. This will also be by not like and guard me against it. This will also be by Your will. Hence, the desirable and the undesirable both are by Your decree and will. Thus I seek refuge in You from You, in Your power, might nad mercy, from what Your power, might, justice and wisdom will do. I am not seeking refuge in anyone else from anyone else, nor am I seeking refuge in You from anything caused by anyone else. It is all caused by You.\"\n<\/p>\n<p>One may ask: How is it that Allah decrees something yet He does not like it or approve of it? How can He will and create something and, at the same time, dislike and hate it?\nThen, know that will is of two kinds: one which is willed because and for itself, and the other which is willed because and for something else. The thing that is willed for itself is sought &amp; loved for itself and for what it brings about it good. As for the thing which is willed because and for something else, it itself is not the goal of what is willed; it has no real benefit to it from itself, but is a means to the actual goal and will. Therefore, it is disliked by the willer from the point of view of its existence in itself; but what it leads to is the thing that is actually willed. It is similar to the medicine which is disliked though the one who takes it knows that it contains his cure. People often do things that they do not like in the hope that they will produce desired results, even if the results are probable and they cannot be certain about them.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nBut about the One Who has nothing hidden from Him? Allah may dislike something, but this does not counter His willing that thing for another purpose as it will be a cause for something that is beloved to Him. For example, Allah created Iblis. He is the being of wickedness in ways of life, actions, beliefs and volitions. He is the cause of many human beings' unhappiness and for their actions that are displeasing to Allah. At the same time, though, he is a means for many things that Allah will love to bestow on His creatures. Therefore, his existence is more beloved to Allah than his non-existence.\n<\/p>\n<p>Reasons:\nBy creating Iblis, Allah demonstrates to His servants His ability to create opposites and contraries. He has created a being who is the most wicked and the cause of every wickedness. Yet, at the same time, He created his opposite, the angel Gabriel. Gabriel is on of the most noble of all creatures and a source of every good. Blessed be the Creator of the latter and the former. Similarly, this power of Allah's demonstrated in His creation of night &amp; day, disease &amp; cure, right &amp; wrong, good &amp; evil. This is a part of the detailed evidence of His perfect power, absolute authority, dominion and rule, for He has created those opposites. They are set up against one another. He has used them for meeting His goals. If the world were devoid of these opposites, we would not have witnessed the faultless wisdom. The absolute power and the perfect rule He has over all things.\n<\/p>\n<p>Allah says, \"And of everything We have created pairs, that you may remember (the Grace of Allâh).\" (51:49)\n<\/p>\n<p>Secondly, Iblis makes possible the manifestation of such names of Allah as show that He forbears, forgives, overlooks and forgoes the violations of His rights, and sets sinner free. If He had not created things which He detests but which makes possible, the manifestation of these names, these benefits and wisdom would have been lost. The Prophet Mohammad (sal lallaho alaihi vassal lam) referred to this points when he said, \"If you do not sin, Allah will remove you and put in your place a people who will sin and then ask Him to forgive them, that He may forgive them.\" (Muslim, At-Tawbah, 2749; At-Tirmidhi, Ad-Da'wat, 2526)\n<\/p>\n<p>Thirdly, Iblis makes possible the manifestation of the wisdom and knowledge of the One who is wise &amp; knowing, Who places things in their proper places, and nothing in the wrong place, as is dictated by His wisdom and knowledge. He knows to whom He should give His message. He knows who are fit for it and who will receive it gratefully and who are not fit for it. If desirable causes were removed because they produced evil consequences, the good things that outweigh these evils would have never been realized. Look at the sun, the moon and the wind. They produce good as well as evil but their good greatly outweighs their evil.\n<\/p>\n<p>Fourthly, if Iblis had not been created, a number of things by which men affirm their servitude to Allah would have not occurred. The act of worship in Jihad is one of the most beloved acts of worship to Allah. If all the people were believers, that act of worship would be nullified as well as its consequences of having loyally and enmity for the sake of Allah. Similarly, the worship in the acts of commanding good and eradicating evil, in having patience, in going against one's desires, in sacrificing out of love for Allah, in repentance and asking forgiveness, in seeking refuge in Allah from being overtaken by his enemy, and being protected from the evil one's plot, and so on, are all part of the wisdom that the human mind would not have been able to discover (if it had not been for the creation of Iblis).\n<\/p>\n<p>\nOne cannot have an outcome without a cause, a consequence without having an antecedent. To achieve those good things, require the cause (creation of Iblis). When one experience evil whisperings and insinuations and tries to suppress them, one is fighting with satan, and that is certainly a sign of faith.\n<\/p>\n<p>If one asks why Allah did not promote and strengthen the thing (with goodness) when He created it, the response is that His wisdom did not require it. It required only its creation. Its creation is good; evil enters into it because it has not been promoted and strengthened. One may ask then: why is it that Allah did not promote everything He created? This question is invalid. It assumes that the wise course is to pull all existing things on the same level. This is wrong. On the contrary, wisdom requires disparity between things, as it is apparent in this world. Disparity, it should be clear, does not rise from the creation of different varieties of things; rather, it arises from the absence of certain things that are not the object of creation. As for creation itself, there is no disparity.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nWe believe in all of these things, and we are certain that everything comes from Allah. His decision is never reversed, His command is never resisted, His will is never frustrated.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nNow it should be clear for those who wish to seek truth.\n<\/p>\n<p>Finally, knowledge is of two types: one existent (or accessible) in creation and one inaccessible in creation. To deny the knowledge that is existent is infidelity; to claim the knowledge that is inaccessible is also infidelity. Faith is not confirmed until a person accepts the knowledge that is existent and abandons seeking the knowledge which is inaccessible.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nInshaAllah Read more: http://www.systemoflife.com/answering-islamophobes/agniveer/219-creation-of-universe-human-and-shaitan#ixzz3duCSfxPi\n<\/p>\n","name":"Creation of Universe, Human, and Shaitan - VedKaBhed.Com Fast Server","@id":"/index.php/2015/06/23/creation-of-universe-human-and-shaitan/#richSnippet","isPartOf":{"@id":"/index.php/2015/06/23/creation-of-universe-human-and-shaitan/#webpage"},"image":{"@id":"http://theindianmuslim.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/062315_1700_creationofu1.png"},"inLanguage":"en-US","mainEntityOfPage":{"@id":"/index.php/2015/06/23/creation-of-universe-human-and-shaitan/#webpage"}}]}</script>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><em><span style="color:red;">Agniveer states:Surate Bakar 117 states that whenever Allah wants to do anything, He says to him, “Kun” and it just happens. Same is repeated in Al Imran 47 , Surate Nahal 40 and Surate Yaasin 82.</span><br>
<span style="color:red;">1 a. Now a doubt is that who is ‘him’ in above verses. Whom does Allah says ‘Kun’? The thing that was not present so far? What is the logic of addressing something that was not there in first place?<br>
</span></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="http://theindianmuslim.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/062315_1700_creationofu2.png" alt=""><span style="color:red;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><em><br>
</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;"><strong>Response: </strong></span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;">Surah Baqarah ,117﴿وَإِذَا قَضَى أَمْرًا فَإِنَّمَا يَقُولُ لَهُ كُنْ فَيَكُونُ  (When He decrees a matter, He only says to it : “Be! ـ and it is.)</span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;">Now we will see the word to word translation to it:<br>
When: وَإِذَا<br>
Decreed or judge: قَضَىٰ<br>
Matter: أَمْرًا<br>
(He) says to it: فَإِنَّمَا يَقُولُ<br>
To be: لَهُ كُنْ<br>
And it is: فَيَكُونُ<br>
(Similar words in all ayah)<br>
So, there is no him but it, in the mentioned verse.</span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;">Allah says, “And to Allâh belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth, and Allâh has power over all things.”(3:189)<br>
Thus, demonstrating His perfect complete ability and tremendous authority; if He decides a matter, He merely orders it to, ‘Be’ and it comes into existence. So exalted &amp; glorified is Allah.<br>
“Know you not that Allâh is able to do all things?” (2:106). </span><br>

<span style="color:red;">1 b. Further, what is the need of even saying ‘Kun’? Can’t Allah bypass this redundant step and directly create what He wants to create?</span></em><br>
</span></p>

</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;"><strong>Response:</strong><br>
The answer is that Allah is not actually addressing anything but He is telling Mohammad (sal lallaho alaihi vassal lam) &amp; all after him, that, Allah carries out what He wishes or intend to. It is the explanation of His divine will.<br>
Al-Quran is not an allegorical interpretation (or an indirect speech) like other scriptures, which include human narrations. This is the example of speech in First person.</span><br>
</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:red;"><em>Agniveer argues,</em></span><br>
<span style="color:red;"><em>1 c. Further, if this is the method of creation, why has this method suddenly stopped now? Why we do not hear ‘Kun’ anymore?

</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><strong>Response:</strong><br>
How do you know that this method is been stopped?<br>
Does anyone have heard ‘Kun’ before?<br>
So do you think that like humans who have made god by their own hands, Allah should also make each &amp; every creation by His hand (note that there is no similarity between His &amp; our hand).<br>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:red;"><em>2 a. Now one may ask how can one count days when there was no sun and hence no concept of day and night?</em></span><br>
</span></p>

</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;"><strong>Response:</strong><br>
Primarily, who had made the concept of day &amp; night? Does day &amp; night depends on clock?<br>
Allah says in Qur’an in Surah Anbiya, Ch. No. 21, Verse No. 33, (the translation to which is) ‘It is Allah who has created the night and the day, the sun and the moon, each one rotating about its own axis.’<br>
Now, would anyone tell what the condition at poles is?<br>
There is continuous light (or day) for 6 months &amp; continuous darkness (or night) for 6 months. So how can one calculate the duration of these? Even if there is sun, no one can count days (except by clock).<br>
Muslims believe for Allah it is all possible, since He is its Creator. (Not sure of the beliefs of hindus).<br>
As for quoting from tafseer Husaini, it’s the kind suggestion to all islamophobes to quote from authentic tafseer.</span><br>

</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:red;"><em>agniveer state</em><br>
<em>2b. Does that mean that even ‘Kun’ is said by Allah with patience over 6 days?</em><br>
<em>2c. Also, when no one was present, and time is a relative concept, how shall one decide if creation in 6 days is an act of hurry or patience?</em></span><br>

</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;"><strong>Response:</strong><br>
The logic with which Agniveer argues, itself cancels. His point 2c contradicts 2b and seems to be stupidity.<br>
Moreover, Quran doesn’t claim to either of the arguments. It’s the author which is claiming, so he/she should be answerable.</span><br>
</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:red;"><em>Agniveer states</em></span><br>
<span style="color:red;"><em>3. Interestingly, Surate Hum Sijda states that Allah made earth in 2 days, then took 4 days to make food, and then the seven skies were made in 2 days.</em></span><br>
<span style="color:red;"><em>The total comes to 8 days. Now different scholars argue differently to prove that 8 days in this Surat is equal to 6 days in Surate Yunas. They keep fighting over this mathematical discrepancy, but that is not the subject of this article.</em></span><br>
</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="http://theindianmuslim.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/062315_1700_creationofu12.png" alt=""><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;"><strong>Response:</strong><br>
This is a blatant lie.<br>
No where in the Surat As-Sajda, does it is mentioned.<br>
In As-Sajda, verse 4,<br>
Allâh it is He Who has created the heavens and the earth, and all that is between them in six Days. Then He Istawâ (rose over) the Throne (in a manner that suits His Majesty). You (mankind) have none, besides Him, as a Walî (protector or helper etc.) or an intercessor. Will you not then remember (or be admonished)?<br>
Where does 8 days been mentioned? Agniveer must have checked before publishing on web. No where does in Quran, Allah mentions 8 days.</span><br>

</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:red;"><em>3 a. Why suddenly Allah thought of creation, all of sudden? If creation is a power of Allah, why did he not execute this power earlier? Why was he not showing this power for infinite time and then showed for a while, and will stop forever after that? Is it that Allah’s powers also keep changing like his mood and he was unable to create earlier? That means there is a supreme reality that controls even Allah. Or is he simply whimsical? Or imperfect? That seems so if we believe in modern Quran.</em></span><br>
</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="http://theindianmuslim.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/062315_1700_creationofu14.png" alt=""><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;"><strong>Response:</strong><br>
The counter question can be posed that, then, why He EVER created? Why He Ever executed His power of creation?<br>
Nothing controls Allah. He execute His will as suits His majesty. We do not say like hindus that, creation &amp; dissolution is continous process and Ishwar do not creates.</span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;"><strong>Allah says in Al-Quran,:</strong></span><br>
</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;">“But you cannot will, unless Allâh wills. Verily, Allâh is Ever All-Knowing, All-Wise.”(76:30)</span><br>
</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;">“And you will not, unless (it be) that Allâh wills, the Lord of the ‘Alamîn (mankind, jinns and all that exists)”.(81:29)</span><br>
</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;">“And even if We had sent down unto them angels, and the dead had spoken unto them, and We had gathered together all things before their very eyes, they would not have believed, unless Allâh willed, but most of them behave ignorantly.” (6:111)</span><br>
</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;">“And whomsoever Allâh wills to guide, He opens his breast to Islâm, and whomsoever He wills to send astray, He makes his breast closed and constricted, as if he is climbing up to the sky. Thus Allâh puts the wrath on those who believe not.” (6:125) </span><br>
</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;">How can something happen in His kingdom that He does not will? No belief is further astray than the belief that Allah wills a non-believer to believe, but He does not believe and his will prevails over the will of Allah. Far exalted is Allah above what these people allege.<br>
Now, some people may say that if Allah had willed we would have not done bad.</span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;"><strong>This is mentioned in Quran,</strong></span><br>
</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;">Those who took partners (in worship) with Allâh will say: “If Allâh had willed, we would not have taken partners (in worship) with Him, nor would our fathers, and we would not have forbidden anything (against His Will).” (6:148)</span><br>
</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;">And they said: “If it had been the Will of the Most Beneficent (Allâh), we should not have worshipped them (false deities).” (43:20)</span><br>
</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;"><strong>To which Allah says,</strong></span><br>
</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;">Likewise belied those who were before them, (they argued falsely with Allâh’s Messengers), till they tasted of Our Wrath. Say: “Have you any knowledge (proof) that you can produce before us? Verily, you follow nothing but guess and you do nothing but lie.” (6:148)</span><br>
</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;">“They have no knowledge whatsoever of that. They do nothing but lie!” (43:20)</span><br>
</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;">They fail to realize that if Allah Has willed, they could also have a worst situation. But Allah is all Merciful.<br>
<strong> </strong></span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;"><strong>Tafseer Ibn Katheer mentions in Surah Yaseen under ayah 67, that, Allah says,</strong><br>
(And if it had been Our will, We would surely have wiped out their eyes, so that they would struggle for the path, how then would they see) ‘Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn ‘Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, explained it: “Allah says, ‘If We willed, We could have misguided them all away from true guidance, so how could they be guided” And on one occasion he said, “‘We could have blinded them.”’<br>
Al-Hasan Al-Basri said, “If Allah willed, He could have covered their eyes and made them blind, stumbling about.” Mujahid, Abu Salih, Qatadah and As-Suddi said, “So that they would struggle for the path, i.e., the right way.” Ibn Zayd said, “The meaning of path here is the truth — ‘How could they see when We have covered their eyes”’<br>
Al-‘Awfi reported that Ibn ‘Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him said: (how then would they see) “They would not see the truth.”<br>
(And if it had been Our will, We could have transformed them in their places.) Al-‘Awfi reported that Ibn ‘Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said; “‘We could have destroyed them.” As-Suddi said, “‘We could have changed their form.” Abu Salih said, “‘We could have turned them to stone.” Al-Hasan Al-Basri and Qatadah said, “‘We could have caused them to sit on their feet.”</span><br>
</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;">Allah says: (Then they would have been unable to go forward) meaning, move to the front; (nor they could have turned back.) meaning, move backwards. They would have remained static, unable to move forwards or backwards.</span><br>
</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;">Whatever Allah wills happen &amp; whatever He does not will, does not happen.<br>
Thus we believe what is been revealed to Prophet Mohammad (sal lal laho alaihi vasl lam). Quran is the only scripture, without human narration, &amp; which is unchanged from the day it’s been revealed &amp; will continue to be as it is.</span><br>
</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;">Allah says in Al-Quran, Surah Hijr, ayah 9 (the translation to which is), “We have, without doubt, sent down the Message; and We will assuredly guard it (from corruption).”</span><br>
</span></li>

<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;"><strong>Response:</strong><br>
Surah Ar-Room!<br>
The prediction made in the initial verses of this Surah is one of the most outstanding evidences of the Quran’s being the Word of Allah and the Prophet Muhammad (sal lallaho alaihi vassal lam) being a true Messenger of Allah.<br>
The verse which is been talked about is 11th &amp; not 10th.</span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;"><strong>The tafseer (Ibn Kathir) of verses 11 &amp; 27,</strong><br>
(And He it is Who originates the creation, then He will repeat it; and this is easier for Him.) Ibn Abi Talhah reported that Ibn ‘Abbas said, “This means it is easier for Him.” Mujahid said: “Repeating it is easier for Him than originating it, and originating it is easy for Him.” This was also the view of ‘Ikrimah and others.<br>
Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, said that the Prophet said: (Allah says; “The son of Adam denied Me, and he had no right to do so. And he reviled Me, and he had no right to do so. As for his denying Me, it is his saying: ‘He will not remake me as He originated me’ — while originating the creation is not easier for Me than re-creating him. As for his reviling Me, it is his saying: ‘Allah has taken to Himself a son,’ while I am the One, the Self-Sufficient Master; I beget not, nor was I begotten, and there is none comparable to Me.”)<br>
The ayah talks about the creation, then recreation (after death when they will resurrect). Then the believers would dwell in heaven forever &amp; non-believers would burn in hell.</span><br>
</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;">Allah says in Surah Al-Mulk, ayah 1 &amp; 2, “Blessed is He in Whose Hand is the dominion, and He is Able to do all things. Who has created death and life, that He may test you which of you is best in deed. And He is the All-Mighty, the Oft-Forgiving.”</span><br>
</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;">Allay says, “And Allâh is Able to do everything”, (18:45); </span><br>

<li><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;">“Nor is Allah to be frustrated by anything whatever in the heavens or on earth: for He is All-Knowing. All-Powerful”, (35:44); </span><br>
</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;">“His Throne doth extend over the heavens and the earth, and He feeleth no fatigue in guarding and preserving them for He is the Most High, the Supreme (in glory)”, (2:255).</span><br>

<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;"><strong>Response:</strong><br>
Now seeing Quran without any error, lets for now only see what agniveer claims to ‘as per vedas’ (for which he didn’t gave any reference…only stating ‘satyarth prakash’..giving impression of it being most holier &amp; authentic then actual vedas):</span><br>
</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="http://theindianmuslim.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/062315_1700_creationofu19.png" alt=""><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:red;"><em>a.Creation and dissolution is a never-beginning never-ending process executed by shapeless and omnipresent Ishwar.</em></span><br>
<span style="color:red;"><em>b. Soul, Nature and Ishwar were always present and shall remain so. Thus Ishwar did not create Adam. He simply used existing matter to create universe, its various structures, and then integrated souls with various organic forms.</em></span><br>
</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="http://theindianmuslim.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/062315_1700_creationofu20.png" alt=""><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><strong>Response:</strong><br>
Soul, Nature &amp; Ishwar—Is it trinity?<br>
Most hindus thought that trinity is Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesh..<br>
So Adam was either created instantaneously or spontaneously?<br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;">Existing matter?? Who created this? Where it come from? It can be only possible if there is any other God than Ishwar of Hinduism!<br>
”<br>
Anyhow, matter, souls and God are equally eternal and uncreate. God cannot create any more matter nor can He destroy any. Also He cannot create any new souls nor can He kill any that exist. ” If God creates new souls, the material out of which He creates them will be exhausted: for however much a treasure may be, it will sooner or later run out, if there be nothing but drawings upon it and no putting in it” this is mentioned in sayarthaprakash even swami ji says that souls are immaterial,”</span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;">But the way he speaks of their creation out of material which could become exhausted if always drawn up and not added to, it would appear as if he believed them to be material after all. Also when Dayanand says that God is Almighty, that “God stands in need of nobody’s least help in doing His work of creation, preservation and destruction”, and, “He accomplishes all His work out of His own infinite power” is to be understood under the proviso that God’s infinite power is powerless to create anything without having an abundant supply of matter ready to hand and a large supply of ready-made souls. God’s work of creation is like that of a potter. He takes the dead matter, fashions forms out of them and puts the souls into those forms.</span><br>
</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;">Allah says, “He is the First (nothing is before Him) and the Last (nothing is after Him), the Most High (nothing is above Him) and the Most Near (nothing is nearer than Him). And He is the All-Knower of every thing.” (57:3)</span><br>
</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;"><strong>So hindu brothers come to real Ishwar, i.e., Allah.</strong></span><br>

</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:red;"><em>c. Ishwar does not do all this instantaneously. On contrary, it does so through its unchangeable laws which take their own time to complete.</em></span><br>

</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;"><strong>Response:</strong><br>
But previous point tells that Iswar did not create Adam? Then how was he created? It’s a clear contradiction.<br>
What are these ‘unchangeable laws’ which agniveer is quoting? How much is this “own time”?<br>
So according to Vedas, creation &amp; dissolution is the instantaneous process, without having Ishwar any major role?<br>
Note: There are enormous anamolies in Vedas, but it’s just the refutation of what agniveer quoted in his article. </span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;"><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br>
There is no role of Ishwar in Hinduism in making universe. Ishwar of Hinduism got everything prepared beforehand…means he didn’t created anything.<br>
So, one should follow Quran, the final revelation of Allah and not the contradictory scriptures.<br>
Muslims do not believe in spontaneous generation. Everything exists by the mercy of Allah.</span><br>
</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;">Allah says in Quran, Surah Al-Araaf, Ayaah 54, (the translation to which is) “Indeed, your Lord is Allah, Who created the heavens and the earth in Six Days, and then He rose over (Istawa) the Throne. He brings the night as a cover over the day, seeking it rapidly, and (He created) the sun, the moon, the stars subjected to His command. Surely, His is the creation and commandment. Blessed is Allah, the Lord of all that exists!”</span><br>
</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;"><strong>It is mentioned in Tafseer Ibn Katheer under this ayah, that:</strong><br>
Imam Ahmad recorded Abu Hurayrah saying: ‘Allah’s Messenger told me: “Allah created the dust on Sunday, and He created the mountains on Sunday, and He created the trees on Monday, and He created the unpleasant things on Tuesday and He created the light on Wednesday and He spread the creatures through out it on Thursday and He created Adam after ‘Asr on Friday. He was the last created during the last hour of Friday, between ‘Asr and the night.”</span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;">As for Allah’s statement,<br>
(and then He rose over (Istawa) the Throne) the people had several conflicting opinions over its meaning. However, we follow the way that our righteous predecessors took in this regard, such as Malik, Al-Awza’i, Ath-Thawri, Al-Layth bin Sa’d, Ash-Shafi’i, Ahmad, Ishaq bin Rahwayh and the rest of the scholars of Islam, in past and present times. Surely, we accept the apparent meaning of, Al-Istawa, without discussing its true essence, equating it (with the attributes of the creation), or altering or denying it (in any way or form). We also believe that the meaning that comes to those who equate Allah with the creation is to be rejected, for nothing is similar to Allah,<br>
(There is nothing like Him, and He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer.) (42:11).</span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;"><br>
Indeed, we assert and affirm what the Imams said, such as Nu’aym bin Hammad Al-Khuza’i, the teacher of Imam Al-Bukhari, who said, “Whoever likens Allah with His creation, will have committed Kufr. Whoever denies what Allah has described Himself with, will have committed Kufr. Certainly, there is no resemblance (of Allah with the creation) in what Allah and His Messenger have described Him with. Whoever attests to Allah’s attributes that the plain Ayat and authentic Hadiths have mentioned, in the manner that suits Allah’s majesty, all the while rejecting all shortcomings from Him, will have taken the path of guidance.”</span><br>

<span style="color:red;"><em>It says that Allah created Adam with clay using His two hands. And then He puffed</em></span><br>
<span style="color:red;"><em>His soul into Adam</em></span><br>
<span style="color:red;"><em>Now this clay was created from nowhere by Allah by saying ‘Kun’. Thus human or Adam does not have his own individual identity. It is made of clay (invention of Allah) and even its soul or Rooh is that of Allah. As we shall see further, this soul of Allah is corrupted and evil as per Quran. So really it is Allah who is evil, if modern Quran is to be believed.</em></span><br>

</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;"><strong>Response:</strong><br>
It is Surah Hijr &amp; not hazar.<br>
It is mentioned in Tafseer Ibn Katheer, that, Allah says in Quran, Surah Al-Hijr, Ayah 28 &amp; 29,<br>
And (remember) when your Lord said to the angels: “I am going to create a man (Adam) from dried (sounding) clay of altered mud. ”<br>
“So, when I have fashioned him completely and breathed into him (Adam) of My spirit (the soul which I created for him,) then fall down, prostrating yourselves before him.”<br>
It is already been mentioned that Allah created dust (alterd mud)…from which he created Adam.<br>
And Allah breathed the rooh (which was created for Adam) into him. Allah addressed it as ‘My’ to show that it was His creation.<br>
The mud &amp; the soul was created for Adam. So this soul is not the soul of Allah as agniveer claims. So his statement falls.</span><br>

<span style="color:navy;">Does islamophobe agniveer is out of his mind?</span><br>
</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;">Allah says in Surah Ibrahim, Ayah 27,</span><br>
</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;">“Allah will establish in strength those who believe, with the word that stands firm, in this world and in the Hereafter; but Allah will leave, to stray, those who do wrong: Allah doeth what He willeth.”</span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;"><strong>Where are those verses which agniveer quoted? He is just fooling around.</strong></span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;"><strong>Though, for a sake of his argument, read this hadith in the reply:</strong><br>
Narrated By ‘Ali : While we were in a funeral procession in Baqi Al-Gharqad, Allah’s Apostle came and sat down, and we sat around him. He had a small stick in his hand and he bent his head and started scraping the ground with it. He then said, “There is none among you, and no created soul but has his place written for him either in Paradise or in the Hell-Fire, and also has his happy or miserable fate (in the Hereafter) written for him.” A man said, “O Allah’s Apostle! Shall we depend upon what is written for us and give up doing (good) deeds? For whoever among us is destined to be fortunate (in the Hereafter), will join the fortunate peoples and whoever among us is destined to be miserable will do such deeds as are characteristic of the people who are destined to misery.” The Prophet said, “Those who are destined to be happy (in the Hereafter) will find it easy and pleasant to do the deeds characteristic of those destined to happiness, while those who are to be among the miserable (in the Hereafter), will find it easy to do the deeds characteristic of those destined to misery.” Then he recited: ‘As for him who gives (in charity) and keeps his duty to Allah and believes in the Best reward from Allah, We will make smooth for him the path of ease. But he who is a greedy miser and thinks himself self sufficient, and gives the lie to the Best reward from Allah we will make smooth for him the path for evil.’ (Quran, 92.5-10).<br>

<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;">We will discuss more about the predestination (Qadr), in footnote to this article.</span><br>

<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:red;"><em>Now the big doubt is that if Allah is so perfect, pure and noble, why did so many defects come in what was purely created by Him and from Himself?

</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><strong>Response:</strong><br>
The soul of human is not that of Allah (but His creation)..See the explanation before.<br>
Again this is the matter of Qadr, which couldn’t be discussed here itself (being it to be vast topic altogether). A brief report is been presented in conclusion of this part.<br>
May Allah guide &amp; forgive him.<br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;">Now see the vedic concept of creation as given by agniveer.<br>
(Lets not get into details of verses of Vedas, let for now only focus on satyarth prakash, which agniveer quotes, for he view it as more holier than Vedas.)</span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
<span style="color:red;"><em>a. Soul is an unborn and undying entity.</em><span style="color:navy;"><br>
Means in Hinduism, soul can be supposed to be God. And why not, it is the part of trinity after all. So soul is parallel to God according to hinduism!</span><br>
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:red;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><em>b. It takes birth in various life-forms including humans as per its level of ignorance/ knowledge.</em><span style="color:navy;"><br>
Birth? Soul was supposed to be unborn &amp; undying entity or more simply God!<br>
Level of ignorance/knowledge of souls or humans?<br>
If it is human then how come he had any when he is inanimate. May be author meant ‘of souls’, so lets have a benefit of doubt for him.</span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:red;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><em>d. Based on the acts we perform, we develop tendencies or sanskaars which are attached to soul.</em><span style="color:navy;"><br>
But soul was supposed to be having its ‘level of ignorance/knowledge’.<br>
Now its very confusing, what is important, whether it is “acts we perform” which get attached to souls as “tendencies or sanskaars” or soul’s own “level of ignorance/knowledge”.</span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:red;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><em>e. Even after we die, we take a new birth as per these sanskaars and continue our journey forever.</em><span style="color:navy;"><br>
Do we continue our journey in the same physical body or it’s the journey of soul?<br>
If its Yoni concept (which is most popular) then it means same soul travels from cockroaches to lizard to eagle to cat to tiger to human? So when human dies, then what he/she becomes?<br>
So the soul’s ‘level of ignorance/knowledge’ is been overcome by ‘acts we perform’ or ‘sanskaars’. The acts of cockroaches becomes the sanskaars or tendencies (tendency to live on garbage) and so on.</span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:red;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><em>f. Soul has limited potential for knowledge and hence is prone to ignorance. This ignorance causes difference in personalities. When ignorance is eradicated beyond a threshold through our efforts, we obtain ultimate bliss or Moksha.</em><span style="color:navy;"><br>
So finally, according to hinduism, Ishwar is idle. Every matter is been controlled by soul itself. And why not according to them it is part of trinity! They have ridiculed themselves.<br>
May Allah guide us all.</span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;"><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br>
According to Hinduism, Adam was created spontaneously from the unknowingly available pre-existing matter (may be it was the part of trinity!).<br>
Muslim believe, indeed it is Allah who Has created Adam.</span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;">Allah says,<br>
“Is then He Who creates like one that creates not? Will ye not receive admonition?<br>
If ye would count up the favours of Allah, never would ye be able to number them: for Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.” (16:17-18)</span><br>
</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;">Allah is the One Who independently and exclusively creates and controls all things, and have no partner, associate or advisor in that. There is no concept of trinity in Islam.</span><br>
</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;"><strong>There are two types of Will.</strong> One is concerned with something that Allah does Himself; the other is concerned with something that He wants someone else to do. Command is concerned with the second, not the first. It is clear that His creation of their acts, or the acts of other creatures, something different from His Enjoining upon them the laws that will secure their well being and save them from misery.</span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;"><br>
When, for example, He commands Pharoah, Abu Lahab, or anyone else to believe in Him, He explains to them what course to them would be beneficial and what course would be harmful to them. But this does not mean that He will also help them carry out His commands. On the contrary, when He creates any act of theirs or helps them to effect it, it may involve something harmful to them. To be sure, all that He creates has a purpose. But it is not necessary that that what He has commanded man to do and what is good for them when they carry it out should also be good for Allah when He Himself does it or makes them to do it. The two aspects, the creative and the prescriptive, are not one.</span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;">It happens that sometimes we ask a person to do or not to do something and our intention is nothing but to do Him good, which we even explains to hem; nevertheless we do not want to help him to do it. It is not necessary that if it is good for me to advice someone to do something for his good it would also be good for me to help him do it. It may even be in my best interest to oppose the act. The two aspects are quite different: to do advise someone sincerely to do something is one thing, and to do it oneself is another. Therefore, if it is possible to distinguish between these two aspects in the human context, it is much more and correct to make that distinction in the divine context.</span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;">If Allah commands someone to do something and helps him carry it out, He will be both creating it and commanding it. It will be the object of His creative will as well as His perspective will. But if He does not help in the performance of the act, it will only be the object of His command, not of creation. It will be wise not to create it; it may even be wiser to create its opposite. Obviously, the creation of one of the contraries rules out the creation of the other. For example, if He creates an illness that leads a person to submit to Him, repent for his sins and seek His forgiveness, softens his heart, lower his vanity, do away with his arrogance and rebellion, that would be in contradiction to the creation of health which would not lead to all these good consequences.<br>

<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;">Allah says in Quran,</span><br>

</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;"><strong>Response:</strong><br>
Allah says in Surah Baqarah, ayah 34-36</span><br>
</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;">“And behold, We said to the angels: “Bow down to Adam” and they bowed down. Not so Iblis: he refused and was haughty: He was of those who reject Faith.”</span><br>
</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;">We said: “O Adam! dwell thou and thy wife in the Garden; and eat of the bountiful things therein as (where and when) ye will; but approach not this tree, or ye run into harm and transgression.”</span><br>
</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;">Then did Satan make them slip from the (garden), and get them out of the state (of felicity) in which they had been. We said: “Get ye down, all (ye people), with enmity between yourselves. On earth will be your dwelling-place and your means of livelihood – for a time.”</span><br>
</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;"><strong>Tafseer of these ayah is enough to refute any claim made by agniveer or his/her type (had he consulted it before!).</strong></span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;"><br>
<strong>Ibn Katheer mentions under tafseer of this ayah,</strong><br>
This Ayah mentions the great honor that Allah granted Adam, and Allah reminded Adam’s offspring of this fact. Allah commanded the angels to prostrate before Adam, as this Ayah and many Hadiths testify..<br>
Iblis was among Those ordered to prostrate before Adam, although He was not an Angel.<br>
When Allah commanded the angels to prostrate before Adam, Iblis was included in this command. Although Iblis was not an angel, he was trying – and pretending – to imitate the angels’ behavior and deeds, and this is why he was also included in the command to the angels to prostrate before Adam. Satan was criticized for defying that command.<br>
Similarly, Muhammad bin Ishaq reported that Ibn ‘Abbas said, “Before he undertook the path of sin, Iblis was with the angels and was called ‘Azazil.’ He was among the residents of the earth and was one of the most active worshippers and knowledgeable persons among the angels. This fact caused him to be arrogant.<br>
Qatadah commented on Allah’s statement,<br>
(And (remember) when We said to the angels: “Prostrate yourselves before Adam.”)<br>
“The obedience was for Allah and the prostration was before Adam. Allah honored Adam and commanded the angels to prostrate before him.” Some people said that this prostration was just a prostration of greeting, peace and honor.<br>
[It should be noted that now, no prostration is been allowed, which is mentioned in tafseer further,]</span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;">The practice of prostrating was allowed for previous nations, but was repealed for ours. Mu’adh said to the Prophet , “I visited Ash-Sham and found that they used to prostatebefore their priests and scholars. You, O Messenger of Allah, are more deserving of prostration.” The Prophet said, “No. If I was to command any human to prostrate before another human, I would command the wife to prostrate before her husband because of the enormity of his right on her.”</span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;"><strong>The following is recorded in the Sahih,</strong><br>
(No person who has the weight of a mustard seed of arrogance in his heart shall enter Paradise.)<br>
Iblis had disbelief, arrogance, and rebellion, all of which caused him to be expelled from the holy presence of Allah, and His mercy.<br>
Then human was honoured again when Allah allowed Adam &amp; Eve to live and eat wherever and whatever they wished in Paradise.</span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;">Allah’s statement to Adam,<br>
(but come not near this tree) is a test for Adam. There are conflicting opinions over the nature of the tree mentioned here. Imam Abu Ja’far bin Jarir said, “The correct opinion is that Allah forbade Adam and his wife from eating from a certain tree in Paradise, but they ate from it. We do not know which tree that was, because Allah has not mentioned anything in the Qur’an or the authentic Sunnah about the nature of this tree. It was said that it was barley, grape, or a fig tree. Yet, this is knowledge that does not bring any benefit, just as being ignorant in its nature does no harm. Allah knows best.”</span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;"><br>
Heaven was the honour given to Adam &amp; Eve, for they were excellent of the creations of Allah, which is evident since Allah ordered angels to honour His creation (Adam) by prostrating.</span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;">Allah gives to those whom He wills. Its already been discussed in part I.<br>
The Ishwar of arya samajis do not have this divine will. They do according to knowledge of souls! </span><br>

<em>d. By the way, what is meant by ‘going close to a tree’? How close is ‘going close’. One mm, one cm, one inch or what? Because if creation in one second can be hurry, and in 6 days be patience, then one mm may be far off and one nm be too close?</em><br>

</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;"><strong>Response:</strong><br>
Satan was created itself to test human being. So Allah has warned whole humanity beforehand.<br>
To train or test the soldiers, they are been exposed to hard practice sessions including mock drill (with all real dangers); so would anyone ask why these drills are been designed? Obviously, to test the soldiers.<br>
To get much better insight into the purpose of creation of Iblis, see footnote in this article.<br>
Well, if anyone has fever he’s been told to not to go near cold water. Then how close is this going? It means that one must refrain from drinking it.</span><br>

<span style="color:red;"><em>3. Surat Swad 75-81 explain the story of Satan’s curse.</em></span><br>
<span style="color:red;"><em>(then he quotes the poor translation of the verses).</em></span><br>

<span style="color:red;"><em>Satan said: I am exalted because you made me with Fire but made Adam with clay.</em></span><br>

</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;"><strong>Response:</strong><br>
These verses itself cleared everything.<br>
Surah Saad, Ayah 75-84</span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;"><strong>Tafseer Ibn Katheer mentions under this ayah,</strong><br>
Allah mentions this story in Surat Al-Baqarah, at the beginning of Surat Al-A’raf, in Surat Al-Hijr, Al-Isra’, Al-Kahf and here. Before creating Adam, peace be upon him, Allah told the angels that He was going to create a human being from sounding clay of altered smooth black mud. He told them that when He finished creating and forming him, they were to prostrate to him as a sign of honor and respect, and out of obedience to the command of Allah, may He be exalted. All of the angels obeyed this command except for Iblis, who was not one of them. He was one of the Jinn, and his nature betrayed him at his time of greatest need. He refused to prostrate to Adam, and he disputed with his Lord about him, claiming that he was better than Adam, because he was created from fire while Adam was created from clay, and fire was better than clay, or so he said. He made a mistake by doing this, and he went against the command of Allah, thus committing the sin of disbelief. So Allah exiled him, humiliated him, and cast him out of His mercy and His sacred Presence, and called him “Iblis” symbolizing that he had Ablasa min Ar-Rahmah (despaired of mercy) — that there was no hope for him of mercy. He cast him down from the heavens, disgraced and rejected, to the earth. Iblis asked Allah to give him a reprieve until the Day of Resurrection, so the Forbearing One, Who does not hasten to punish those who disobey Him, gave him a reprieve. When he knew that he was safe from destruction until the Day of Resurrection, he rebelled and transgressed.<br>
(Allah) said: “O Iblis! What prevents thee from prostrating thyself to one whom I have created with my hands? Art thou haughty? Or art thou one of the high (and mighty) ones?”</span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;">Iblis ﴾said: “By Your might, then I will surely mislead them all, except Your true servants amongst them).”<br>
For which, (Allah) said: “Then it is just and fitting- and I say what is just and fitting.<br>
(Surah Saad, ayah 84)</span><br>
</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;">This means that Iblis knew for what purpose it was created.</span><br>
</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;">Iblis knew that there would be day of Recompense (then too it is inclined to be on wrong path)…and this is the sign of disbeliever.</span><br>
</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;">That’s why Allah said, “That I will certainly fill Hell with thee and those that follow thee,- every one.” (Surah Saad, ayah 84)</span><br>
</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;">See, even with these warning, if someone, do not want to correct himself, then what could be done?</span><br>
</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;">Entire passage speaks about Satan’s refusal in bowing to Prophet Adam (AS), just because of his arrogance. Allah (SWT) did order Satan to do something, which he was too arrogant to do and that is why Satan went astray. Indeed, that is not the doing of Allah (SWT) but the doing of his own arrogance.</span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;">If the owner of a restaurant orders his workers to cook, and one of them refuses (because he is arrogant) but the owner keeps persisting, then rejects him, whose fault is that? Is it the owner’s fault or the worker who did not perform his duty? This scenario speaks for itself in showing that Allah (SWT) did not lead Satan astray, but it was his own arrogance that led him astray, just like in the scenario I mentioned, it is not the restaurant owner who led the cook off track but his own arrogance.</span><br>

</span></p>

</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
<strong>Response:</strong><br>
No where, did Allah said that the sons of Adam would suffer for the arrogance of Iblis. Is agniveer dreaming?<br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;">Infact Allah says in Surah Al-Anaam, Ayah 164, “No person earns any (sin) except against himself (only), and no bearer of burdens shall bear the burden of another. Then unto your Lord is your return, so He will tell you that wherein you have been differing.”</span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;">And in Sural Al-Isra, ayah 15, that, “Whoever goes right, then he goes right only for the benefit of his ownself. And whoever goes astray, then he goes astray to his own loss. No one laden with burdens can bear another’s burden. And We never punish until We have sent a Messenger (to give warning).”</span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;">And in Sural Faatir, ayah 35, that, “And no bearer of burdens shall bear another’s burden,”<br>
And in Surah Az-Zumar, ayah 7 and in Surah An-Najm, Ayah 38.</span><br>

If any teacher loves you and says that since you are a bright student you are going to top in coming examination, then will you not study?<br>
As is evident by many authentic hadeeth, we should not depend on what is been written, but we have to do our best at our level.<br>
There is a very famous idiom, “God help those who help themselves”.<br>
We would discuss later in the footnote the matter of Qadr, in detail.<br>

<span style="color:red;"><em>e. Finally, Allah himself says that bow to none other then Allah. Hence, if Satan refused to counter this order of Allah to bow only to Him, Allah should ideally have rewarded him.

<span style="color:red;"><em>(After all if Allah can do anything, it can also create a fake Allah and fool Satan! It can also create another Allah who can kill previous Allah! Thus poor Satan had to pay the price of being loyal to his original father!)</em></span><br>

</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;"><strong>Response:</strong><br>
This bowing is not that of reverence, as been previously shown. It was just an order.<br>
For example, every parent tells their children to wake early at morning, but if a child is ill, then his/her parent them self ask him/her to sleep. So it means that they are fake parents? Actually, the order depends on what is good for the addressee. One should not weigh everything on a same balance.</span><br>

Allah goes a step ahead and warns humans in Surate Bakar 168-169 that they should not follow Satan. He is their enemy and will guide them to evil and shameful acts.</em></span><br>

<span style="color:red;"><em>a. He should not have created Satan in first place.</em></span><br>
<span style="color:red;"><em>b. If he had to create Satan, he should have not made him enemy of humans.</em></span><br>
<span style="color:red;"><em>c. If Satan had to become our enemy as per Allah’s will but did a mistake, Allah should not have allowed him the chance to misguide humans.

<span style="color:red;"><em>d. And if all the above was necessary, he should have at least given humans multiple births so that they get ample time to learn Arabic, mug up Quran, analyze Quran, and then practice avoiding Satan.</em></span><br>

<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><strong>Response:</strong><br>
Only, Allah who Creates, provides sustenance, Test, Forgive, Punish, could be Perfect.<br>
Truly, Ishwar of arya samajis cannot be perfect, since his power is limited. He cannot create, cannot test, cannot forgive, cannot punish. It seems that his existence is useless!<br>

</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;"><strong>Response:</strong><br>
Agniveer is out of his/her mind. No where in Quran did Allah said that He (Himself) misguided satan, leave alone 15:9.</span><br>

</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;"><strong>Response:</strong><br>
It is been returned in Tafseer Ibn Katheer under, ayah 84 of Surah Maryam,</span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;">Concerning Allah’s statement,<br>
(See you not that We have sent the Shayatin against the disbelievers to push them to do evil.) ‘Ali bin Abi Talhah said that Ibn ‘Abbas said, “They will lead them astray with temptation.” Al-‘Awfi said that Ibn ‘Abbas said, “They will incite them against Muhammad and his Companions.” Qatadah said, “They will harass them and disturb them until they disobey Allah.” Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd said, “This is similar to Allah’s statement,<br>
(And whosoever turns away blindly from the remembrance of the Most Gracious, We appoint for him a Shaytan to be a companion for him.)” (43:36)</span><br>
</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;">This means that whosoever is bent upon disbelieve, satan would incite him more. (That’s what bad friends do).</span><br>
</span></li>
</ul>

</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:red;"><em>Agniveer then states the vedic story of satan,<br>
3. As per Vedas, the only Satan is our own ignorance. We can curb it through open-mindedness, rationality and efforts.</em></span><br>
</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="http://theindianmuslim.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/062315_1700_creationofu54.png" alt=""><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><strong>Response:</strong><br>
But previously, agniveer said that soul take birth with its level of ignorance/knowledge.<br>
So it means that every soul has satan or a level of satan! He also claims that soul is undying entity (remember he had claimed that it takes Birth too!). Then what actually is soul? Is it eternal satan?<br>
To make it easy for us to understand, take the analogy of poison. Allah created poison as well as its cure. Likewise, He created Satan but even told us the cure, which is servitude to Allah by following the path of His Prophets.<br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;">For agniveer to say that God is powerless before Satan just because He granted him respite is illogical. There are billions of people who do not believe in the Vedas and consider them a source of Idol worship, but still God provides them food, air, water, etc to survive. If we reverse the question on you that is your Ishwar helpless against them, what would you say?</span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;">Let us now turn to the Vedas on the question of evil. agniveer has not even understood his own Vedas properly as will be clear very soon.</span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;">The Yajur Veda mentions in Chapter 30 how Ishwar created various professions of the sinner and the saints. For example, it says</span><br>
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="http://theindianmuslim.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/062315_1700_creationofu55.png" alt=""><img decoding="async" src="http://theindianmuslim.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/062315_1700_creationofu56.png" alt=""><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;">The Mantras are saying, that like a Brahmin who has been created for Preisthood, Ishwar has also created the harlot for pastime and Kama (erotic love), thus giving legitimacy to it. For all jobs He has created the people, according to these mantras of the Vedas. According to the Hindu conception, the harlot has been made a harlot depending on her deeds in the previous birth. Why will an omnipotent Ishwar (?) create or allow such a profession, which is a source of misguidance for millions? </span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;">From these professions, the good and the evil, mentioned in this chapter of Yajur Veda, there can be three reasons why evil professions exist:</span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;">1. Either God does not want to stop evil, or</span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;">2. He wants to stop evil but is unable to stop it,or</span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;">3. There is some wisdom in allowing them for some time</span><br>
</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;">Now I leave it to agniveer to answer these questions. When they will respond only then do they deserve to ask us.</span><br>
</span></li>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:red;"><em>4. Ishwar has no villainous role to play in this. Ishwar simply provides us the best situations to eradicate our ignorance depending upon our current level of ignorance and direction of our efforts. He continuously manages this optimization process.</em></span><br>

</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><strong>Response:</strong><br>
Do their Ishwar has ANY role to play?<br>
How these best situations are been provided? What are their sources?<br>
Eradicating ignorance by the ignorance?<br>
So pessimistic religion they have made for themselves!<br>
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:navy;font-size:18pt;"><strong>Conclusion:</strong></span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
<span style="color:navy;"> </span><br>
</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;">Agniveer is not aware of the principles and teachings of Islam, and then too, he is following his whim &amp; ego to malign Islam. His all claims have been refuted.</span><br>
</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;">Moreover, Agniveer try to represent Hinduism as a worshipper of formless single God, but, he believes soul &amp; nature to be present as eternally as Ishwar. For him, Ishwar does not create anything &amp; just take rest and so, universe and human have been created spontaneously (happens by own-‘creation and dissolution process’).</span><br>
</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;">Muslims believe in Al-Quran, the final &amp; perfect word of Allah, in which Allah says,</span><br>
</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;">“Verily, We have created all things with Qadar (Divine Preordainments of all things before their creation, as written in the Book of Decrees Al-Lauh Al-Mahfûz).” (54:49)</span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;"><br>
“Glory be to Him, Who has created all the pairs of that which the earth produces, as well as of their own (human) kind (male and female), and of that which they know not.” (36:36)<br>
“And Who has created all the pairs and has appointed for you ships and cattle on which you ride.” (43:12)</span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;"><br>
“Should not He Who has created know? And He is the Most Kind and Courteous (to His slaves) All-Aware (of everything).”(67:14)</span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;">“And with Him are the keys of the Ghaib (all that is hidden), none knows them but He. And He knows whatever there is in (or on) the earth and in the sea; not a leaf falls, but he knows it. There is not a grain in the darkness of the earth nor anything fresh or dry, but is written in a Clear Record. It is He, Who takes your souls by night (when you are asleep), and has knowledge of all that you have done by day, then he raises (wakes) you up again that a term appointed (your life period) be fulfilled, then in the end unto Him will be your return. Then He will inform you what you used to do.” (6:59-60)</span><br>
</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;">It’s a kind request to hindu brothers and sisters, that they should return to the truth.</span><br>
</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;">Having seen the absurd philosophy of making soul and nature as eternal as ishwar, Arya samajis are left with two options:</span><br>
</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;">2.Accept openly that they are atheist. Reason being that they do not consider God to be able to do all things. They have doubts of His power and their belief set partners with Him.</span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;"><br>
3.Accept Islam and become our brother and sister. They will have equal rights. Accept the control of Allah over all things and accept the Mohammad as the seal of Prophets and the last &amp; final revelation Al-Quran.</span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;">Thus,<br>
“<strong>Truth has (now) arrived, and Falsehood perished: for Falsehood is (by its nature) bound to perish</strong>.” (17:81)</span><br>

</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;"><strong>Qadr and creation of Iblis</strong><br>
About Qadr, Al-Qurtubi quoted Ibn Abdul_barr who said, “If anyone asks for reasons in order to increase his knowledge, remove his ignorance or gain insight into the religion, there is no harm in that. But whoever asks in a spirit of defiance and not for the sake of learning or gaining insight, which is forbidden, no matter how little or much he should ask.”</span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;"><br>
A discussion for the understanding of Qadr, without getting into too much discussion as it is difficult or impossible for man to understand the wisdom that lies behind Allah’s creation or His command:<br>
Fore-ordainment (Qadr) is a secret that Allah Has not disclosed to any of His creatures. He creates and destroys, makes poor and makes rich, gives death and gives life, misleads and guides. Ali (raziAllah anhu) said. “Qadr is Allah’s secret, so do not try to uncover it.”<br>
Ahl as-Sunnah wa al-Jamah believe that everything is according to Allah’s ordainment and measure. Allah says, “Verily, all things have We created in proportion and measure.”(54:49); and, “It is He who created all things, and ordered them in due proportions.” (25:2)<br>
Allah wills and decrees infidelity from the disbelievers. He is not pleased with it or nor does He like it, but that is His will with respect to creation (and allowing that thing), but He is not pleased with it as a way of life.</span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;">In his prayers, the Prophet Mohammad (sal lallaho alaihi vassal lam) used to say, “O Allah, I seek refuge in Your pleasure from Your anger, and I seek refuge in your forgiveness from your punishment, and I seek refuge in You from You.”</span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;"><br>
Consider how the Prophet Mohammad (sal lallaho alaihi vassal lam) used to seek refuge in the attribute of pleasure from the attribute of anger, and from the action of forgiveness from the action of punishment. The first is for an attribute and the second for the consequences of an attribute. Then he tied them all together with His essence. He is in fact saying: “What I seek refuge from happens by your decree &amp; will, and what I seek refuge in is your pleasure and forgiveness, that also depend on Your decree &amp; will. If You like to be kind to Your servant, you may forgive him. If You will to be angry to Him, You may punish him. Save me, therefore, from what You do not like and guard me against it. This will also be by not like and guard me against it. This will also be by Your will. Hence, the desirable and the undesirable both are by Your decree and will. Thus I seek refuge in You from You, in Your power, might nad mercy, from what Your power, might, justice and wisdom will do. I am not seeking refuge in anyone else from anyone else, nor am I seeking refuge in You from anything caused by anyone else. It is all caused by You.”</span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;">One may ask: How is it that Allah decrees something yet He does not like it or approve of it? How can He will and create something and, at the same time, dislike and hate it?<br>
Then, know that will is of two kinds: one which is willed because and for itself, and the other which is willed because and for something else. The thing that is willed for itself is sought &amp; loved for itself and for what it brings about it good. As for the thing which is willed because and for something else, it itself is not the goal of what is willed; it has no real benefit to it from itself, but is a means to the actual goal and will. Therefore, it is disliked by the willer from the point of view of its existence in itself; but what it leads to is the thing that is actually willed. It is similar to the medicine which is disliked though the one who takes it knows that it contains his cure. People often do things that they do not like in the hope that they will produce desired results, even if the results are probable and they cannot be certain about them.</span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;"><br>
But about the One Who has nothing hidden from Him? Allah may dislike something, but this does not counter His willing that thing for another purpose as it will be a cause for something that is beloved to Him. For example, Allah created Iblis. He is the being of wickedness in ways of life, actions, beliefs and volitions. He is the cause of many human beings’ unhappiness and for their actions that are displeasing to Allah. At the same time, though, he is a means for many things that Allah will love to bestow on His creatures. Therefore, his existence is more beloved to Allah than his non-existence.</span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;"><strong>Reasons:</strong><br>
By creating Iblis, Allah demonstrates to His servants His ability to create opposites and contraries. He has created a being who is the most wicked and the cause of every wickedness. Yet, at the same time, He created his opposite, the angel Gabriel. Gabriel is on of the most noble of all creatures and a source of every good. Blessed be the Creator of the latter and the former. Similarly, this power of Allah’s demonstrated in His creation of night &amp; day, disease &amp; cure, right &amp; wrong, good &amp; evil. This is a part of the detailed evidence of His perfect power, absolute authority, dominion and rule, for He has created those opposites. They are set up against one another. He has used them for meeting His goals. If the world were devoid of these opposites, we would not have witnessed the faultless wisdom. The absolute power and the perfect rule He has over all things.</span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;"><strong>Allah says</strong>, “And of everything We have created pairs, that you may remember (the Grace of Allâh).” (51:49)</span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;"><strong>Secondly,</strong> Iblis makes possible the manifestation of such names of Allah as show that He forbears, forgives, overlooks and forgoes the violations of His rights, and sets sinner free. If He had not created things which He detests but which makes possible, the manifestation of these names, these benefits and wisdom would have been lost. The Prophet Mohammad (sal lallaho alaihi vassal lam) referred to this points when he said, “If you do not sin, Allah will remove you and put in your place a people who will sin and then ask Him to forgive them, that He may forgive them.” (Muslim, At-Tawbah, 2749; At-Tirmidhi, Ad-Da’wat, 2526)</span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;"><strong>Thirdly,</strong> Iblis makes possible the manifestation of the wisdom and knowledge of the One who is wise &amp; knowing, Who places things in their proper places, and nothing in the wrong place, as is dictated by His wisdom and knowledge. He knows to whom He should give His message. He knows who are fit for it and who will receive it gratefully and who are not fit for it. If desirable causes were removed because they produced evil consequences, the good things that outweigh these evils would have never been realized. Look at the sun, the moon and the wind. They produce good as well as evil but their good greatly outweighs their evil.</span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;"><strong>Fourthly,</strong> if Iblis had not been created, a number of things by which men affirm their servitude to Allah would have not occurred. The act of worship in Jihad is one of the most beloved acts of worship to Allah. If all the people were believers, that act of worship would be nullified as well as its consequences of having loyally and enmity for the sake of Allah. Similarly, the worship in the acts of commanding good and eradicating evil, in having patience, in going against one’s desires, in sacrificing out of love for Allah, in repentance and asking forgiveness, in seeking refuge in Allah from being overtaken by his enemy, and being protected from the evil one’s plot, and so on, are all part of the wisdom that the human mind would not have been able to discover (if it had not been for the creation of Iblis).</span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;"><br>
One cannot have an outcome without a cause, a consequence without having an antecedent. To achieve those good things, require the cause (creation of Iblis). When one experience evil whisperings and insinuations and tries to suppress them, one is fighting with satan, and that is certainly a sign of faith.</span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;">If one asks why Allah did not promote and strengthen the thing (with goodness) when He created it, the response is that His wisdom did not require it. It required only its creation. Its creation is good; evil enters into it because it has not been promoted and strengthened. One may ask then: why is it that Allah did not promote everything He created? This question is invalid. It assumes that the wise course is to pull all existing things on the same level. This is wrong. On the contrary, wisdom requires disparity between things, as it is apparent in this world. Disparity, it should be clear, does not rise from the creation of different varieties of things; rather, it arises from the absence of certain things that are not the object of creation. As for creation itself, there is no disparity.</span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;"><br>
We believe in all of these things, and we are certain that everything comes from Allah. His decision is never reversed, His command is never resisted, His will is never frustrated.</span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;"><br>
Now it should be clear for those who wish to seek truth.</span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:navy;"><strong>Finally,</strong> knowledge is of two types: one existent (or accessible) in creation and one inaccessible in creation. To deny the knowledge that is existent is infidelity; to claim the knowledge that is inaccessible is also infidelity. Faith is not confirmed until a person accepts the knowledge that is existent and abandons seeking the knowledge which is inaccessible.</span><br>

This Article is in reply to the article in Anti Islamic website agniveer","copyrightYear":"2015","articleSection":"Rebuttal: Religion","articleBody":" \nAssalaamu 'alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barkatahu to our Muslim Ummah and a Warm Welcome to all Seekers of True Knowledge.\n\nThis Article is in reply to the article in Anti Islamic website agniveer.com with title, \n\n Creation of Universe, Human and Shaytan\n\nArticle is available here:\nhttp:\/\/agniveer.com\/956\/islam-creation-human-and-satan\/\n\nRefutation by Brothers Ahmed Mobeen & Neer\n\n\nThe article is in three parts: Creation of Universe, creation of Human & story of satan.\n\n\nThe italic red text indicates the statements of Agniveer.\n\nI: Creation of Universe\n\n \n\n\n\nAgniveer states:Surate Bakar 117 states that whenever Allah wants to do anything, He says to him, \"Kun\" and it just happens. Same is repeated in Al Imran 47 , Surate Nahal 40 and Surate Yaasin 82.\n1 a. Now a doubt is that who is 'him' in above verses. Whom does Allah says 'Kun'? The thing that was not present so far? What is the logic of addressing something that was not there in first place?\n\n\n\nResponse: \n\n\nSurah Baqarah ,117﴿وَإِذَا قَضَى أَمْرًا فَإِنَّمَا يَقُولُ لَهُ كُنْ فَيَكُونُ  (When He decrees a matter, He only says to it : \"Be! ـ and it is.)\n\n\nNow we will see the word to word translation to it:\nWhen: وَإِذَا\nDecreed or judge: قَضَىٰ\nMatter: أَمْرًا\n(He) says to it: فَإِنَّمَا يَقُولُ\nTo be: لَهُ كُنْ\nAnd it is: فَيَكُونُ\n(Similar words in all ayah)\nSo, there is no him but it, in the mentioned verse.\n\n\nAllah says, \"And to Allâh belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth, and Allâh has power over all things.\"(3:189)\nThus, demonstrating His perfect complete ability and tremendous authority; if He decides a matter, He merely orders it to, 'Be' and it comes into existence. So exalted & glorified is Allah.\n\"Know you not that Allâh is able to do all things?\" (2:106). \n\n\n \n\n\n\nAgniveer state\n1 b. Further, what is the need of even saying 'Kun'? Can't Allah bypass this redundant step and directly create what He wants to create?\n\n\n\n\nResponse:\nThe answer is that Allah is not actually addressing anything but He is telling Mohammad (sal lallaho alaihi vassal lam) & all after him, that, Allah carries out what He wishes or intend to. It is the explanation of His divine will.\nAl-Quran is not an allegorical interpretation (or an indirect speech) like other scriptures, which include human narrations. This is the example of speech in First person.\n\n\n\n\nAgniveer argues,\n1 c. Further, if this is the method of creation, why has this method suddenly stopped now? Why we do not hear 'Kun' anymore? What is the proof that this is the method of creation? Is there anything beyond blind belief that can justify such crazy concepts?\n\n\n\n\nResponse:\nHow do you know that this method is been stopped?\nDoes anyone have heard 'Kun' before?\nSo do you think that like humans who have made god by their own hands, Allah should also make each & every creation by His hand (note that there is no similarity between His & our hand).\n\n\nhttp:\/\/www.systemoflife.com\/answering-islamophobes\/agniveer\/200-allah-shapeless-or-limited\n\n\n \n\n\n\n2 a. Now one may ask how can one count days when there was no sun and hence no concept of day and night?\n\n\n\n\nResponse:\nPrimarily, who had made the concept of day & night? Does day & night depends on clock?\nAllah says in Qur'an in Surah Anbiya, Ch. No. 21, Verse No. 33, (the translation to which is) 'It is Allah who has created the night and the day, the sun and the moon, each one rotating about its own axis.'\nNow, would anyone tell what the condition at poles is?\nThere is continuous light (or day) for 6 months & continuous darkness (or night) for 6 months. So how can one calculate the duration of these? Even if there is sun, no one can count days (except by clock).\nMuslims believe for Allah it is all possible, since He is its Creator. (Not sure of the beliefs of hindus).\nAs for quoting from tafseer Husaini, it's the kind suggestion to all islamophobes to quote from authentic tafseer.\n\n\n\n\nagniveer state\n2b. Does that mean that even 'Kun' is said by Allah with patience over 6 days?\n2c. Also, when no one was present, and time is a relative concept, how shall one decide if creation in 6 days is an act of hurry or patience?\n\n\n\n\nResponse:\nThe logic with which Agniveer argues, itself cancels. His point 2c contradicts 2b and seems to be stupidity.\nMoreover, Quran doesn't claim to either of the arguments. It's the author which is claiming, so he\/she should be answerable.\n\n\n\n\nAgniveer states\n3. Interestingly, Surate Hum Sijda states that Allah made earth in 2 days, then took 4 days to make food, and then the seven skies were made in 2 days.\nThe total comes to 8 days. Now different scholars argue differently to prove that 8 days in this Surat is equal to 6 days in Surate Yunas. They keep fighting over this mathematical discrepancy, but that is not the subject of this article.\n\n\n\n\nResponse:\nThis is a blatant lie.\nNo where in the Surat As-Sajda, does it is mentioned.\nIn As-Sajda, verse 4,\nAllâh it is He Who has created the heavens and the earth, and all that is between them in six Days. Then He Istawâ (rose over) the Throne (in a manner that suits His Majesty). You (mankind) have none, besides Him, as a Walî (protector or helper etc.) or an intercessor. Will you not then remember (or be admonished)?\nWhere does 8 days been mentioned? Agniveer must have checked before publishing on web. No where does in Quran, Allah mentions 8 days.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n3 a. Why suddenly Allah thought of creation, all of sudden? If creation is a power of Allah, why did he not execute this power earlier? Why was he not showing this power for infinite time and then showed for a while, and will stop forever after that? Is it that Allah's powers also keep changing like his mood and he was unable to create earlier? That means there is a supreme reality that controls even Allah. Or is he simply whimsical? Or imperfect? That seems so if we believe in modern Quran.\n\n\n\n\nResponse:\nThe counter question can be posed that, then, why He EVER created? Why He Ever executed His power of creation?\nNothing controls Allah. He execute His will as suits His majesty. We do not say like hindus that, creation & dissolution is continous process and Ishwar do not creates.\n\n\nAllah says in Al-Quran,:\n\n\n\t\"But you cannot will, unless Allâh wills. Verily, Allâh is Ever All-Knowing, All-Wise.\"(76:30)\n\n\t\"And you will not, unless (it be) that Allâh wills, the Lord of the 'Alamîn (mankind, jinns and all that exists)\".(81:29)\n\n\t\"And even if We had sent down unto them angels, and the dead had spoken unto them, and We had gathered together all things before their very eyes, they would not have believed, unless Allâh willed, but most of them behave ignorantly.\" (6:111)\n\n\t\"And whomsoever Allâh wills to guide, He opens his breast to Islâm, and whomsoever He wills to send astray, He makes his breast closed and constricted, as if he is climbing up to the sky. Thus Allâh puts the wrath on those who believe not.\" (6:125) \n\n\nHow can something happen in His kingdom that He does not will? No belief is further astray than the belief that Allah wills a non-believer to believe, but He does not believe and his will prevails over the will of Allah. Far exalted is Allah above what these people allege.\nNow, some people may say that if Allah had willed we would have not done bad.\n\n\nThis is mentioned in Quran,\n\n\n\tThose who took partners (in worship) with Allâh will say: \"If Allâh had willed, we would not have taken partners (in worship) with Him, nor would our fathers, and we would not have forbidden anything (against His Will).\" (6:148)\n\n\tAnd they said: \"If it had been the Will of the Most Beneficent (Allâh), we should not have worshipped them (false deities).\" (43:20)\n\n\nTo which Allah says,\n\n\n\tLikewise belied those who were before them, (they argued falsely with Allâh's Messengers), till they tasted of Our Wrath. Say: \"Have you any knowledge (proof) that you can produce before us? Verily, you follow nothing but guess and you do nothing but lie.\" (6:148)\n\n\t\"They have no knowledge whatsoever of that. They do nothing but lie!\" (43:20)\n\n\nThey fail to realize that if Allah Has willed, they could also have a worst situation. But Allah is all Merciful.\n \n\n\nTafseer Ibn Katheer mentions in Surah Yaseen under ayah 67, that, Allah says,\n(And if it had been Our will, We would surely have wiped out their eyes, so that they would struggle for the path, how then would they see) 'Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn 'Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, explained it: \"Allah says, 'If We willed, We could have misguided them all away from true guidance, so how could they be guided'' And on one occasion he said, \"'We could have blinded them.'''\nAl-Hasan Al-Basri said, \"If Allah willed, He could have covered their eyes and made them blind, stumbling about.'' Mujahid, Abu Salih, Qatadah and As-Suddi said, \"So that they would struggle for the path, i.e., the right way.'' Ibn Zayd said, \"The meaning of path here is the truth -- 'How could they see when We have covered their eyes'''\nAl-'Awfi reported that Ibn 'Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him said: (how then would they see) \"They would not see the truth.\"\n(And if it had been Our will, We could have transformed them in their places.) Al-'Awfi reported that Ibn 'Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said; \"'We could have destroyed them.'' As-Suddi said, \"'We could have changed their form.'' Abu Salih said, \"'We could have turned them to stone.'' Al-Hasan Al-Basri and Qatadah said, \"'We could have caused them to sit on their feet.''\n\n\n\tAllah says: (Then they would have been unable to go forward) meaning, move to the front; (nor they could have turned back.) meaning, move backwards. They would have remained static, unable to move forwards or backwards.\n\n\nWhatever Allah wills happen & whatever He does not will, does not happen.\nThus we believe what is been revealed to Prophet Mohammad (sal lal laho alaihi vasl lam). Quran is the only scripture, without human narration, & which is unchanged from the day it's been revealed & will continue to be as it is.\n\n\n\tAllah says in Al-Quran, Surah Hijr, ayah 9 (the translation to which is), \"We have, without doubt, sent down the Message; and We will assuredly guard it (from corruption).\"\n\n\n\n\nAgniveer sates\n \n\nb. Surate Room 10 says that Allah creates the Creation first, will do so again and then you shall return.Thus, powers of Allah would be waste and useless before and after this Creation for infinite time?\n\n\n\n\nResponse:\nSurah Ar-Room!\nThe prediction made in the initial verses of this Surah is one of the most outstanding evidences of the Quran's being the Word of Allah and the Prophet Muhammad (sal lallaho alaihi vassal lam) being a true Messenger of Allah.\nThe verse which is been talked about is 11th & not 10th.\n\n\nThe tafseer (Ibn Kathir) of verses 11 & 27,\n(And He it is Who originates the creation, then He will repeat it; and this is easier for Him.) Ibn Abi Talhah reported that Ibn 'Abbas said, \"This means it is easier for Him.'' Mujahid said: \"Repeating it is easier for Him than originating it, and originating it is easy for Him.'' This was also the view of 'Ikrimah and others.\nAl-Bukhari recorded that Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, said that the Prophet said: (Allah says; \"The son of Adam denied Me, and he had no right to do so. And he reviled Me, and he had no right to do so. As for his denying Me, it is his saying: 'He will not remake me as He originated me' -- while originating the creation is not easier for Me than re-creating him. As for his reviling Me, it is his saying: 'Allah has taken to Himself a son,' while I am the One, the Self-Sufficient Master; I beget not, nor was I begotten, and there is none comparable to Me.'')\nThe ayah talks about the creation, then recreation (after death when they will resurrect). Then the believers would dwell in heaven forever & non-believers would burn in hell.\n\n\n\tAllah says in Surah Al-Mulk, ayah 1 & 2, \"Blessed is He in Whose Hand is the dominion, and He is Able to do all things. Who has created death and life, that He may test you which of you is best in deed. And He is the All-Mighty, the Oft-Forgiving.\"\n\n\tAllay says, \"And Allâh is Able to do everything\", (18:45); \n\n\t\"Nor is Allah to be frustrated by anything whatever in the heavens or on earth: for He is All-Knowing. All-Powerful\", (35:44); \n\n\t\"His Throne doth extend over the heavens and the earth, and He feeleth no fatigue in guarding and preserving them for He is the Most High, the Supreme (in glory)\", (2:255).\n\n\n \n\n\n\nAgniveer states that, These anomalies do not remain in Vedic concept of creation.\n\n\n\n\nResponse:\nNow seeing Quran without any error, lets for now only see what agniveer claims to 'as per vedas' (for which he didn't gave any reference...only stating 'satyarth prakash'..giving impression of it being most holier & authentic then actual vedas):\n\n\n\n\na.Creation and dissolution is a never-beginning never-ending process executed by shapeless and omnipresent Ishwar.\nb. Soul, Nature and Ishwar were always present and shall remain so. Thus Ishwar did not create Adam. He simply used existing matter to create universe, its various structures, and then integrated souls with various organic forms.\n\n\n\n\nResponse:\nSoul, Nature & Ishwar—Is it trinity?\nMost hindus thought that trinity is Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesh..\nSo Adam was either created instantaneously or spontaneously?\n\n\nExisting matter?? Who created this? Where it come from? It can be only possible if there is any other God than Ishwar of Hinduism!\n\"\nAnyhow, matter, souls and God are equally eternal and uncreate. God cannot create any more matter nor can He destroy any. Also He cannot create any new souls nor can He kill any that exist. \" If God creates new souls, the material out of which He creates them will be exhausted: for however much a treasure may be, it will sooner or later run out, if there be nothing but drawings upon it and no putting in it\" this is mentioned in sayarthaprakash even swami ji says that souls are immaterial,\"\n\n\nBut the way he speaks of their creation out of material which could become exhausted if always drawn up and not added to, it would appear as if he believed them to be material after all. Also when Dayanand says that God is Almighty, that \"God stands in need of nobody's least help in doing His work of creation, preservation and destruction\", and, \"He accomplishes all His work out of His own infinite power\" is to be understood under the proviso that God's infinite power is powerless to create anything without having an abundant supply of matter ready to hand and a large supply of ready-made souls. God's work of creation is like that of a potter. He takes the dead matter, fashions forms out of them and puts the souls into those forms.\n\n\n\tAllah says, \"He is the First (nothing is before Him) and the Last (nothing is after Him), the Most High (nothing is above Him) and the Most Near (nothing is nearer than Him). And He is the All-Knower of every thing.\" (57:3)\n\n\nSo hindu brothers come to real Ishwar, i.e., Allah.\n\n\n \n\n\n\nc. Ishwar does not do all this instantaneously. On contrary, it does so through its unchangeable laws which take their own time to complete.\n\n\n\n\nResponse:\nBut previous point tells that Iswar did not create Adam? Then how was he created? It's a clear contradiction.\nWhat are these 'unchangeable laws' which agniveer is quoting? How much is this \"own time\"?\nSo according to Vedas, creation & dissolution is the instantaneous process, without having Ishwar any major role?\nNote: There are enormous anamolies in Vedas, but it's just the refutation of what agniveer quoted in his article. \n\n\nConclusion:\nThere is no role of Ishwar in Hinduism in making universe. Ishwar of Hinduism got everything prepared beforehand...means he didn't created anything.\nSo, one should follow Quran, the final revelation of Allah and not the contradictory scriptures.\nMuslims do not believe in spontaneous generation. Everything exists by the mercy of Allah.\n\n\n\tAllah says in Quran, Surah Al-Araaf, Ayaah 54, (the translation to which is) \"Indeed, your Lord is Allah, Who created the heavens and the earth in Six Days, and then He rose over (Istawa) the Throne. He brings the night as a cover over the day, seeking it rapidly, and (He created) the sun, the moon, the stars subjected to His command. Surely, His is the creation and commandment. Blessed is Allah, the Lord of all that exists!\"\n\n\nIt is mentioned in Tafseer Ibn Katheer under this ayah, that:\nImam Ahmad recorded Abu Hurayrah saying: 'Allah's Messenger told me: \"Allah created the dust on Sunday, and He created the mountains on Sunday, and He created the trees on Monday, and He created the unpleasant things on Tuesday and He created the light on Wednesday and He spread the creatures through out it on Thursday and He created Adam after 'Asr on Friday. He was the last created during the last hour of Friday, between 'Asr and the night.\"\n\n\nAs for Allah's statement,\n(and then He rose over (Istawa) the Throne) the people had several conflicting opinions over its meaning. However, we follow the way that our righteous predecessors took in this regard, such as Malik, Al-Awza'i, Ath-Thawri, Al-Layth bin Sa'd, Ash-Shafi'i, Ahmad, Ishaq bin Rahwayh and the rest of the scholars of Islam, in past and present times. Surely, we accept the apparent meaning of, Al-Istawa, without discussing its true essence, equating it (with the attributes of the creation), or altering or denying it (in any way or form). We also believe that the meaning that comes to those who equate Allah with the creation is to be rejected, for nothing is similar to Allah,\n(There is nothing like Him, and He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer.) (42:11).\n\n\n\nIndeed, we assert and affirm what the Imams said, such as Nu'aym bin Hammad Al-Khuza'i, the teacher of Imam Al-Bukhari, who said, \"Whoever likens Allah with His creation, will have committed Kufr. Whoever denies what Allah has described Himself with, will have committed Kufr. Certainly, there is no resemblance (of Allah with the creation) in what Allah and His Messenger have described Him with. Whoever attests to Allah's attributes that the plain Ayat and authentic Hadiths have mentioned, in the manner that suits Allah's majesty, all the while rejecting all shortcomings from Him, will have taken the path of guidance.''\n\n\n \nPart II: Creation of Human\n \n\n\n\nAgniveer SATES\nSurate Hazar 27 details process of creation of Human or Adam.\nIt says that Allah created Adam with clay using His two hands. And then He puffed\nHis soul into Adam\nNow this clay was created from nowhere by Allah by saying 'Kun'. Thus human or Adam does not have his own individual identity. It is made of clay (invention of Allah) and even its soul or Rooh is that of Allah. As we shall see further, this soul of Allah is corrupted and evil as per Quran. So really it is Allah who is evil, if modern Quran is to be believed.\n\n\n\n\nResponse:\nIt is Surah Hijr & not hazar.\nIt is mentioned in Tafseer Ibn Katheer, that, Allah says in Quran, Surah Al-Hijr, Ayah 28 & 29,\nAnd (remember) when your Lord said to the angels: \"I am going to create a man (Adam) from dried (sounding) clay of altered mud. ''\n\"So, when I have fashioned him completely and breathed into him (Adam) of My spirit (the soul which I created for him,) then fall down, prostrating yourselves before him.''\nIt is already been mentioned that Allah created dust (alterd mud)...from which he created Adam.\nAnd Allah breathed the rooh (which was created for Adam) into him. Allah addressed it as 'My' to show that it was His creation.\nThe mud & the soul was created for Adam. So this soul is not the soul of Allah as agniveer claims. So his statement falls.\n\n\n \n\n\n\nAgniveer states\nAs we already discussed in chapter of destiny, even the actions of Adam are pre-decided by Allah. Yet Allah goes a step ahead and states in Surate Ibrahim 27 that: In reality human is criminal and kafir because this tendency of crime and Kufra has been provided by Allah!\n\n\n\n\nResponse:\nDoes islamophobe agniveer is out of his mind?\n\n\n\tAllah says in Surah Ibrahim, Ayah 27,\n\n\n\"Allah will establish in strength those who believe, with the word that stands firm, in this world and in the Hereafter; but Allah will leave, to stray, those who do wrong: Allah doeth what He willeth.\"\n\n\nWhere are those verses which agniveer quoted? He is just fooling around.\n\n\nThough, for a sake of his argument, read this hadith in the reply:\nNarrated By 'Ali : While we were in a funeral procession in Baqi Al-Gharqad, Allah's Apostle came and sat down, and we sat around him. He had a small stick in his hand and he bent his head and started scraping the ground with it. He then said, \"There is none among you, and no created soul but has his place written for him either in Paradise or in the Hell-Fire, and also has his happy or miserable fate (in the Hereafter) written for him.\" A man said, \"O Allah's Apostle! Shall we depend upon what is written for us and give up doing (good) deeds? For whoever among us is destined to be fortunate (in the Hereafter), will join the fortunate peoples and whoever among us is destined to be miserable will do such deeds as are characteristic of the people who are destined to misery.\" The Prophet said, \"Those who are destined to be happy (in the Hereafter) will find it easy and pleasant to do the deeds characteristic of those destined to happiness, while those who are to be among the miserable (in the Hereafter), will find it easy to do the deeds characteristic of those destined to misery.\" Then he recited: 'As for him who gives (in charity) and keeps his duty to Allah and believes in the Best reward from Allah, We will make smooth for him the path of ease. But he who is a greedy miser and thinks himself self sufficient, and gives the lie to the Best reward from Allah we will make smooth for him the path for evil.' (Quran, 92.5-10).\n(Bukhari, Volume 6, Hadith Number 473).\n\n\nWe will discuss more about the predestination (Qadr), in footnote to this article.\n\n\nAgniveer then indeed does a great blasphemy by saying:\n\n\n\n\n\nNow the big doubt is that if Allah is so perfect, pure and noble, why did so many defects come in what was purely created by Him and from Himself? And why is soul of humans, which is actually soul of Allah criminal? And if that be so, how can a criminal Kafir Allah be benevolent and loving?\n\n\n\n\n\nResponse:\nThe soul of human is not that of Allah (but His creation)..See the explanation before.\nAgain this is the matter of Qadr, which couldn't be discussed here itself (being it to be vast topic altogether). A brief report is been presented in conclusion of this part.\nMay Allah guide & forgive him.\n\n\nNow see the vedic concept of creation as given by agniveer.\n(Lets not get into details of verses of Vedas, let for now only focus on satyarth prakash, which agniveer quotes, for he view it as more holier than Vedas.)\n\n\n\na. Soul is an unborn and undying entity.\nMeans in Hinduism, soul can be supposed to be God. And why not, it is the part of trinity after all. So soul is parallel to God according to hinduism!\n\n\nb. It takes birth in various life-forms including humans as per its level of ignorance\/ knowledge.\nBirth? Soul was supposed to be unborn & undying entity or more simply God!\nLevel of ignorance\/knowledge of souls or humans?\nIf it is human then how come he had any when he is inanimate. May be author meant 'of souls', so lets have a benefit of doubt for him.\n\n\nd. Based on the acts we perform, we develop tendencies or sanskaars which are attached to soul.\nBut soul was supposed to be having its 'level of ignorance\/knowledge'.\nNow its very confusing, what is important, whether it is \"acts we perform\" which get attached to souls as \"tendencies or sanskaars\" or soul's own \"level of ignorance\/knowledge\".\n\n\ne. Even after we die, we take a new birth as per these sanskaars and continue our journey forever.\nDo we continue our journey in the same physical body or it's the journey of soul?\nIf its Yoni concept (which is most popular) then it means same soul travels from cockroaches to lizard to eagle to cat to tiger to human? So when human dies, then what he\/she becomes?\nSo the soul's 'level of ignorance\/knowledge' is been overcome by 'acts we perform' or 'sanskaars'. The acts of cockroaches becomes the sanskaars or tendencies (tendency to live on garbage) and so on.\n\n\nf. Soul has limited potential for knowledge and hence is prone to ignorance. This ignorance causes difference in personalities. When ignorance is eradicated beyond a threshold through our efforts, we obtain ultimate bliss or Moksha.\nSo finally, according to hinduism, Ishwar is idle. Every matter is been controlled by soul itself. And why not according to them it is part of trinity! They have ridiculed themselves.\nMay Allah guide us all.\n\n\nConclusion:\nAccording to Hinduism, Adam was created spontaneously from the unknowingly available pre-existing matter (may be it was the part of trinity!).\nMuslim believe, indeed it is Allah who Has created Adam.\n\n\nAllah says,\n\"Is then He Who creates like one that creates not? Will ye not receive admonition?\nIf ye would count up the favours of Allah, never would ye be able to number them: for Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.\" (16:17-18)\n\n\n\tAllah is the One Who independently and exclusively creates and controls all things, and have no partner, associate or advisor in that. There is no concept of trinity in Islam.\n\n\nThere are two types of Will. One is concerned with something that Allah does Himself; the other is concerned with something that He wants someone else to do. Command is concerned with the second, not the first. It is clear that His creation of their acts, or the acts of other creatures, something different from His Enjoining upon them the laws that will secure their well being and save them from misery.\n\n\n\nWhen, for example, He commands Pharoah, Abu Lahab, or anyone else to believe in Him, He explains to them what course to them would be beneficial and what course would be harmful to them. But this does not mean that He will also help them carry out His commands. On the contrary, when He creates any act of theirs or helps them to effect it, it may involve something harmful to them. To be sure, all that He creates has a purpose. But it is not necessary that that what He has commanded man to do and what is good for them when they carry it out should also be good for Allah when He Himself does it or makes them to do it. The two aspects, the creative and the prescriptive, are not one.\n\n\nIt happens that sometimes we ask a person to do or not to do something and our intention is nothing but to do Him good, which we even explains to hem; nevertheless we do not want to help him to do it. It is not necessary that if it is good for me to advice someone to do something for his good it would also be good for me to help him do it. It may even be in my best interest to oppose the act. The two aspects are quite different: to do advise someone sincerely to do something is one thing, and to do it oneself is another. Therefore, if it is possible to distinguish between these two aspects in the human context, it is much more and correct to make that distinction in the divine context.\n\n\nIf Allah commands someone to do something and helps him carry it out, He will be both creating it and commanding it. It will be the object of His creative will as well as His perspective will. But if He does not help in the performance of the act, it will only be the object of His command, not of creation. It will be wise not to create it; it may even be wiser to create its opposite. Obviously, the creation of one of the contraries rules out the creation of the other. For example, if He creates an illness that leads a person to submit to Him, repent for his sins and seek His forgiveness, softens his heart, lower his vanity, do away with his arrogance and rebellion, that would be in contradiction to the creation of health which would not lead to all these good consequences.\nIt is been discussed more later in Footnote to the article.\n\n\nAllah says in Quran,\n\n\n\t\"Allah doth wish to make clear to you and to show you the ordinances of those before you; and (He doth wish to) turn to you (In Mercy): And Allah is All-knowing, All-wise.\" (4:26)\n\n\t\"Allah doth not wish to place you in a difficulty, but to make you clean, and to complete his favour to you, that ye may be grateful.\"(5:6)\n\n\tSay: \"If the ocean were ink (wherewith to write out) the words of my Lord, sooner would the ocean be exhausted than would the words of my Lord, even if we added another ocean like it, for its aid.\" (18:109)\n\n\t\"Lord of the Throne of Glory, Doer (without let) of all that He intends.\"(85:15-16)\n\n\tThat is our Lord. \"..Thus Allah does whatever he wills.\" (3:40).\n\n\nAllah is knowledgeable of everything, Most Wise about His creation, and He makes the wisest decisions, and He teaches and deprives whom He wills from knowledge. Verily, Allah's wisdom and justice in all matters is perfect.\n\n\n \n\n\nPart III : Story of Satan\n\n\n\nAgniveer states Ayah 34-36 of Surah Baqarah, and argues that,\nSurate Bakar 34 states that Allah ordered angels to bow to Adam and they did\nso. But Satan refused and showed pride because Satan was a Kafir.\nBut the question is that since Satan was also created by Allah, why did Allah make\nhim a Kafir and not a saint?\nWhen Satan was created by Allah then why he was expelled? Why Adam & Eve was given paradise? Destiny of satan? Etc..\n\n\n\n\nResponse:\nAllah says in Surah Baqarah, ayah 34-36\n\n\n\t\"And behold, We said to the angels: \"Bow down to Adam\" and they bowed down. Not so Iblis: he refused and was haughty: He was of those who reject Faith.\"\n\n\tWe said: \"O Adam! dwell thou and thy wife in the Garden; and eat of the bountiful things therein as (where and when) ye will; but approach not this tree, or ye run into harm and transgression.\"\n\n\tThen did Satan make them slip from the (garden), and get them out of the state (of felicity) in which they had been. We said: \"Get ye down, all (ye people), with enmity between yourselves. On earth will be your dwelling-place and your means of livelihood - for a time.\"\n\n\nTafseer of these ayah is enough to refute any claim made by agniveer or his\/her type (had he consulted it before!).\n\n\n\nIbn Katheer mentions under tafseer of this ayah,\nThis Ayah mentions the great honor that Allah granted Adam, and Allah reminded Adam's offspring of this fact. Allah commanded the angels to prostrate before Adam, as this Ayah and many Hadiths testify..\nIblis was among Those ordered to prostrate before Adam, although He was not an Angel.\nWhen Allah commanded the angels to prostrate before Adam, Iblis was included in this command. Although Iblis was not an angel, he was trying - and pretending - to imitate the angels' behavior and deeds, and this is why he was also included in the command to the angels to prostrate before Adam. Satan was criticized for defying that command.\nSimilarly, Muhammad bin Ishaq reported that Ibn 'Abbas said, \"Before he undertook the path of sin, Iblis was with the angels and was called 'Azazil.' He was among the residents of the earth and was one of the most active worshippers and knowledgeable persons among the angels. This fact caused him to be arrogant.\nQatadah commented on Allah's statement,\n(And (remember) when We said to the angels: \"Prostrate yourselves before Adam.'')\n\"The obedience was for Allah and the prostration was before Adam. Allah honored Adam and commanded the angels to prostrate before him.'' Some people said that this prostration was just a prostration of greeting, peace and honor.\n[It should be noted that now, no prostration is been allowed, which is mentioned in tafseer further,]\n\n\nThe practice of prostrating was allowed for previous nations, but was repealed for ours. Mu'adh said to the Prophet , \"I visited Ash-Sham and found that they used to prostatebefore their priests and scholars. You, O Messenger of Allah, are more deserving of prostration.'' The Prophet said, \"No. If I was to command any human to prostrate before another human, I would command the wife to prostrate before her husband because of the enormity of his right on her.\"\n\n\nThe following is recorded in the Sahih,\n(No person who has the weight of a mustard seed of arrogance in his heart shall enter Paradise.)\nIblis had disbelief, arrogance, and rebellion, all of which caused him to be expelled from the holy presence of Allah, and His mercy.\nThen human was honoured again when Allah allowed Adam & Eve to live and eat wherever and whatever they wished in Paradise.\n\n\nAllah's statement to Adam,\n(but come not near this tree) is a test for Adam. There are conflicting opinions over the nature of the tree mentioned here. Imam Abu Ja'far bin Jarir said, \"The correct opinion is that Allah forbade Adam and his wife from eating from a certain tree in Paradise, but they ate from it. We do not know which tree that was, because Allah has not mentioned anything in the Qur'an or the authentic Sunnah about the nature of this tree. It was said that it was barley, grape, or a fig tree. Yet, this is knowledge that does not bring any benefit, just as being ignorant in its nature does no harm. Allah knows best.''\n\n\n\nHeaven was the honour given to Adam & Eve, for they were excellent of the creations of Allah, which is evident since Allah ordered angels to honour His creation (Adam) by prostrating.\n\n\nAllah gives to those whom He wills. Its already been discussed in part I.\nThe Ishwar of arya samajis do not have this divine will. They do according to knowledge of souls! \n\n\n \n\n\n\nAgniveer states\nb. Why did Allah make Satan enemy of Adam?\nc. Who is the primary source of sin of Satan when Satan, his actions and his destiny have been designed by Allah himself and no one else?\nd. By the way, what is meant by 'going close to a tree'? How close is 'going close'. One mm, one cm, one inch or what? Because if creation in one second can be hurry, and in 6 days be patience, then one mm may be far off and one nm be too close?\n(That was merely a digression for those who correlate Islam with science) \n\n\n\n\nResponse:\nSatan was created itself to test human being. So Allah has warned whole humanity beforehand.\nTo train or test the soldiers, they are been exposed to hard practice sessions including mock drill (with all real dangers); so would anyone ask why these drills are been designed? Obviously, to test the soldiers.\nTo get much better insight into the purpose of creation of Iblis, see footnote in this article.\nWell, if anyone has fever he's been told to not to go near cold water. Then how close is this going? It means that one must refrain from drinking it.\n\n\n \n\n\n\nAgniveer states: \n3. Surat Swad 75-81 explain the story of Satan's curse.\n(then he quotes the poor translation of the verses).\nAllah said: O Satan, why do you refuse to bow to whom I myself have created with\nboth my hands. Were you arrogant or exalted?\nSatan said: I am exalted because you made me with Fire but made Adam with clay.\nAllah said: You are wretched and you should get out of the sky. You shall be\ncondemned till Day of Judgment.\nSatan said: O Allah, give me some concession.\nAllah agreed. Then Satan promised that by grace of Allah he shall mislead them all\nexcept the chosen ones of Allah till doomsday.\n\nNow again several questions come in mind:\na. Why Allah got angry with Satan when Satan used his power that was gifted by Allah himself?\nb. Why was Satan created to be arrogant? Or was it mistake of Allah? (Allah is kind and pure after all!)\n\n\n\n\nResponse:\nThese verses itself cleared everything.\nSurah Saad, Ayah 75-84\n\n\nTafseer Ibn Katheer mentions under this ayah,\nAllah mentions this story in Surat Al-Baqarah, at the beginning of Surat Al-A'raf, in Surat Al-Hijr, Al-Isra', Al-Kahf and here. Before creating Adam, peace be upon him, Allah told the angels that He was going to create a human being from sounding clay of altered smooth black mud. He told them that when He finished creating and forming him, they were to prostrate to him as a sign of honor and respect, and out of obedience to the command of Allah, may He be exalted. All of the angels obeyed this command except for Iblis, who was not one of them. He was one of the Jinn, and his nature betrayed him at his time of greatest need. He refused to prostrate to Adam, and he disputed with his Lord about him, claiming that he was better than Adam, because he was created from fire while Adam was created from clay, and fire was better than clay, or so he said. He made a mistake by doing this, and he went against the command of Allah, thus committing the sin of disbelief. So Allah exiled him, humiliated him, and cast him out of His mercy and His sacred Presence, and called him \"Iblis'' symbolizing that he had Ablasa min Ar-Rahmah (despaired of mercy) -- that there was no hope for him of mercy. He cast him down from the heavens, disgraced and rejected, to the earth. Iblis asked Allah to give him a reprieve until the Day of Resurrection, so the Forbearing One, Who does not hasten to punish those who disobey Him, gave him a reprieve. When he knew that he was safe from destruction until the Day of Resurrection, he rebelled and transgressed.\n(Allah) said: \"O Iblis! What prevents thee from prostrating thyself to one whom I have created with my hands? Art thou haughty? Or art thou one of the high (and mighty) ones?\"\n\n\nIblis ﴾said: \"By Your might, then I will surely mislead them all, except Your true servants amongst them).''\nFor which, (Allah) said: \"Then it is just and fitting- and I say what is just and fitting.\n(Surah Saad, ayah 84)\n\n\n\tThis means that Iblis knew for what purpose it was created.\n\n\tIblis knew that there would be day of Recompense (then too it is inclined to be on wrong path)...and this is the sign of disbeliever.\n\n\nThat's why Allah said, \"That I will certainly fill Hell with thee and those that follow thee,- every one.\" (Surah Saad, ayah 84)\n\n\n\tSee, even with these warning, if someone, do not want to correct himself, then what could be done?\n\n\nEntire passage speaks about Satan's refusal in bowing to Prophet Adam (AS), just because of his arrogance. Allah (SWT) did order Satan to do something, which he was too arrogant to do and that is why Satan went astray. Indeed, that is not the doing of Allah (SWT) but the doing of his own arrogance.\n\n\nIf the owner of a restaurant orders his workers to cook, and one of them refuses (because he is arrogant) but the owner keeps persisting, then rejects him, whose fault is that? Is it the owner's fault or the worker who did not perform his duty? This scenario speaks for itself in showing that Allah (SWT) did not lead Satan astray, but it was his own arrogance that led him astray, just like in the scenario I mentioned, it is not the restaurant owner who led the cook off track but his own arrogance.\n\n\n\n\nc. Why will sons of Adams be cursed for arrogance of Satan? What is their fault?\n\n\n\n\n\nResponse:\nNo where, did Allah said that the sons of Adam would suffer for the arrogance of Iblis. Is agniveer dreaming?\n\n\nInfact Allah says in Surah Al-Anaam, Ayah 164, \"No person earns any (sin) except against himself (only), and no bearer of burdens shall bear the burden of another. Then unto your Lord is your return, so He will tell you that wherein you have been differing.\"\n\n\nAnd in Sural Al-Isra, ayah 15, that, \"Whoever goes right, then he goes right only for the benefit of his ownself. And whoever goes astray, then he goes astray to his own loss. No one laden with burdens can bear another's burden. And We never punish until We have sent a Messenger (to give warning).\"\n\n\nAnd in Sural Faatir, ayah 35, that, \"And no bearer of burdens shall bear another's burden,\"\nAnd in Surah Az-Zumar, ayah 7 and in Surah An-Najm, Ayah 38.\n\n\n\n\nAgniveer states,\nd. Even the chosen ones are pre-decided by Allah. So where is the scope for others to do good? They are merely stooges in this great conspiracy between Allah and Satan!\n\n\n\n\nResponse:\nIf any teacher loves you and says that since you are a bright student you are going to top in coming examination, then will you not study?\nAs is evident by many authentic hadeeth, we should not depend on what is been written, but we have to do our best at our level.\nThere is a very famous idiom, \"God help those who help themselves\".\nWe would discuss later in the footnote the matter of Qadr, in detail.\n\n\n\n\nAgniveer states,\ne. Finally, Allah himself says that bow to none other then Allah. Hence, if Satan refused to counter this order of Allah to bow only to Him, Allah should ideally have rewarded him. How would poor Satan know that the Allah who is asking him to bow to Adam is the real Allah or a fake Allah?\n(After all if Allah can do anything, it can also create a fake Allah and fool Satan! It can also create another Allah who can kill previous Allah! Thus poor Satan had to pay the price of being loyal to his original father!)\n\n\n\n\nResponse:\nThis bowing is not that of reverence, as been previously shown. It was just an order.\nFor example, every parent tells their children to wake early at morning, but if a child is ill, then his\/her parent them self ask him\/her to sleep. So it means that they are fake parents? Actually, the order depends on what is good for the addressee. One should not weigh everything on a same balance.\n\n\n\n\n4. Allah goes a step ahead and warns humans in Surate Bakar 168-169 that they should not follow Satan. He is their enemy and will guide them to evil and shameful acts.\nNow Allah is the greatest villain here.\na. He should not have created Satan in first place.\nb. If he had to create Satan, he should have not made him enemy of humans.\nc. If Satan had to become our enemy as per Allah's will but did a mistake, Allah should not have allowed him the chance to misguide humans. Allah could have simply pardoned him but what was the point of giving him permission to misguide poor humans made out of mud?\nd. And if all the above was necessary, he should have at least given humans multiple births so that they get ample time to learn Arabic, mug up Quran, analyze Quran, and then practice avoiding Satan.\ne. Finally, he should not have tested and punished Satan for his loyalty to original order of Allah.\n\n\n\n\nResponse:\nAllah is Ar-Rahman Ar-Raheem.\n\"O mankind! Eat of that which is lawful and good on the earth, and follow not the footsteps of Shaitân (Satan). Verily, he is to you an open enemy.\nFor he commands you what is evil and shameful, and that ye should say of Allah that of which ye have no knowledge.\" (2:168-169)\n\n\n\tWhich test taker would tell you the clue of answering? Which examiner would warn you against the common mistakes? Which scrutinizer will tell you about the difficulties of examination when you are on it?\n\n\tAlhumdulillah. It is none but Allah (the Glorified & Exalted is He).\n\n\tFor more logical explanation of the purpose of creation of satan read the footnote of the article.\n\n\n\n\nAgniveer states,\n5. In Surate Aaraf 16,17,18 Allah Miyan warns that He shall fill Hell with those who follow Satan.\nAnd argues that,\nAgain,\na. If Allah can do anything by saying 'Kun', why did he not make Satan a saint?\nb. Why did he allow Satan the permission to misguide people, if Satan was a villain.\n\n\n\n\nResponse:\nWhat Allah wills happen and what He does not will, does not happen. Purpose of creation of satan is been discussed in footnote.\n\n\n \n\n\n\nc. If Allah has already decided to fill the Hell, written down everything in book called Lohe Mahfooz, and is now merely following the same, what is the fault of Kafirs except that Allah is whimsical?\n\n\n\n\nResponse:\nThose who do not want to put any effort, come up with these excuses. It's like saying, that the food is been destined to be eaten, so it would fly & would directly come into our mouth!\nFor for-ordainment (Qadr) refer footnote to the article.\n\n\n\n\nd. If Allah created such a defective Satan, who would be nuisance for whole world forever, how can Allah be perfect and expert.\nYet Allah falsely claims in Surate Nahal 9 that I am extremely perfect!\n\n\n\n\nResponse:\nOnly, Allah who Creates, provides sustenance, Test, Forgive, Punish, could be Perfect.\nTruly, Ishwar of arya samajis cannot be perfect, since his power is limited. He cannot create, cannot test, cannot forgive, cannot punish. It seems that his existence is useless!\n\n\n \n\n\n\nAgniveer states,\n6. Surate Hazar Ayat 9 clarifies even further. Satan says that he shall misguide everyone because Allah misguided Satan.\n\n\n\n\nResponse:\nAgniveer is out of his\/her mind. No where in Quran did Allah said that He (Himself) misguided satan, leave alone 15:9.\n\n\n\n\nAnd Allah gives the permission to misguide! He states in Surate Mariyam 84 that don't you see that I have sent Satan to misguide Kafirs by agitating them?\nThis means it was a conspiracy between Allah and Satan. Kafirs are merely guinea pigs suffering in this sinister game.\n\n\n\n\nResponse:\nIt is been returned in Tafseer Ibn Katheer under, ayah 84 of Surah Maryam,\n\n\nConcerning Allah's statement,\n(See you not that We have sent the Shayatin against the disbelievers to push them to do evil.) 'Ali bin Abi Talhah said that Ibn 'Abbas said, \"They will lead them astray with temptation.'' Al-'Awfi said that Ibn 'Abbas said, \"They will incite them against Muhammad and his Companions.'' Qatadah said, \"They will harass them and disturb them until they disobey Allah.'' Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd said, \"This is similar to Allah's statement,\n(And whosoever turns away blindly from the remembrance of the Most Gracious, We appoint for him a Shaytan to be a companion for him.)'' (43:36)\n\n\n\tThis means that whosoever is bent upon disbelieve, satan would incite him more. (That's what bad friends do).\n\n\n \n\n\n\nAgniveer then states the vedic story of satan,\n3. As per Vedas, the only Satan is our own ignorance. We can curb it through open-mindedness, rationality and efforts.\n\n\n\n\nResponse:\nBut previously, agniveer said that soul take birth with its level of ignorance\/knowledge.\nSo it means that every soul has satan or a level of satan! He also claims that soul is undying entity (remember he had claimed that it takes Birth too!). Then what actually is soul? Is it eternal satan?\nTo make it easy for us to understand, take the analogy of poison. Allah created poison as well as its cure. Likewise, He created Satan but even told us the cure, which is servitude to Allah by following the path of His Prophets.\n\n\nFor agniveer to say that God is powerless before Satan just because He granted him respite is illogical. There are billions of people who do not believe in the Vedas and consider them a source of Idol worship, but still God provides them food, air, water, etc to survive. If we reverse the question on you that is your Ishwar helpless against them, what would you say?\n\n\nLet us now turn to the Vedas on the question of evil. agniveer has not even understood his own Vedas properly as will be clear very soon.\n\n\nThe Yajur Veda mentions in Chapter 30 how Ishwar created various professions of the sinner and the saints. For example, it says\n\n\n \n\n\nThe Mantras are saying, that like a Brahmin who has been created for Preisthood, Ishwar has also created the harlot for pastime and Kama (erotic love), thus giving legitimacy to it. For all jobs He has created the people, according to these mantras of the Vedas. According to the Hindu conception, the harlot has been made a harlot depending on her deeds in the previous birth. Why will an omnipotent Ishwar (?) create or allow such a profession, which is a source of misguidance for millions? \n\n\nFrom these professions, the good and the evil, mentioned in this chapter of Yajur Veda, there can be three reasons why evil professions exist:\n\n\n1. Either God does not want to stop evil, or\n\n\n2. He wants to stop evil but is unable to stop it,or\n\n\n3. There is some wisdom in allowing them for some time\n\n\n\tNow I leave it to agniveer to answer these questions. When they will respond only then do they deserve to ask us.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n4. Ishwar has no villainous role to play in this. Ishwar simply provides us the best situations to eradicate our ignorance depending upon our current level of ignorance and direction of our efforts. He continuously manages this optimization process.\n\n\n\n\nResponse:\nDo their Ishwar has ANY role to play?\nHow these best situations are been provided? What are their sources?\nEradicating ignorance by the ignorance?\nSo pessimistic religion they have made for themselves!\n\nConclusion:\n \n\n\n\n\tAgniveer is not aware of the principles and teachings of Islam, and then too, he is following his whim & ego to malign Islam. His all claims have been refuted.\n\n\tMoreover, Agniveer try to represent Hinduism as a worshipper of formless single God, but, he believes soul & nature to be present as eternally as Ishwar. For him, Ishwar does not create anything & just take rest and so, universe and human have been created spontaneously (happens by own-'creation and dissolution process').\n\n\tMuslims believe in Al-Quran, the final & perfect word of Allah, in which Allah says,\n\n\n\"Verily, We have created all things with Qadar (Divine Preordainments of all things before their creation, as written in the Book of Decrees Al-Lauh Al-Mahfûz).\" (54:49)\n\n\n\n\"Glory be to Him, Who has created all the pairs of that which the earth produces, as well as of their own (human) kind (male and female), and of that which they know not.\" (36:36)\n\"And Who has created all the pairs and has appointed for you ships and cattle on which you ride.\" (43:12)\n\n\n\n\"Should not He Who has created know? And He is the Most Kind and Courteous (to His slaves) All-Aware (of everything).\"(67:14)\n\n\n\"And with Him are the keys of the Ghaib (all that is hidden), none knows them but He. And He knows whatever there is in (or on) the earth and in the sea; not a leaf falls, but he knows it. There is not a grain in the darkness of the earth nor anything fresh or dry, but is written in a Clear Record. It is He, Who takes your souls by night (when you are asleep), and has knowledge of all that you have done by day, then he raises (wakes) you up again that a term appointed (your life period) be fulfilled, then in the end unto Him will be your return. Then He will inform you what you used to do.\" (6:59-60)\n\n\n\tIt's a kind request to hindu brothers and sisters, that they should return to the truth.\n\n\tHaving seen the absurd philosophy of making soul and nature as eternal as ishwar, Arya samajis are left with two options:\n\n\n2.Accept openly that they are atheist. Reason being that they do not consider God to be able to do all things. They have doubts of His power and their belief set partners with Him.\n\n\n\n3.Accept Islam and become our brother and sister. They will have equal rights. Accept the control of Allah over all things and accept the Mohammad as the seal of Prophets and the last & final revelation Al-Quran.\n\n\nThus,\n\"Truth has (now) arrived, and Falsehood perished: for Falsehood is (by its nature) bound to perish.\" (17:81)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n Footnotes\n\nQadr and creation of Iblis\nAbout Qadr, Al-Qurtubi quoted Ibn Abdul_barr who said, \"If anyone asks for reasons in order to increase his knowledge, remove his ignorance or gain insight into the religion, there is no harm in that. But whoever asks in a spirit of defiance and not for the sake of learning or gaining insight, which is forbidden, no matter how little or much he should ask.\"\n\n\n\nA discussion for the understanding of Qadr, without getting into too much discussion as it is difficult or impossible for man to understand the wisdom that lies behind Allah's creation or His command:\nFore-ordainment (Qadr) is a secret that Allah Has not disclosed to any of His creatures. He creates and destroys, makes poor and makes rich, gives death and gives life, misleads and guides. Ali (raziAllah anhu) said. \"Qadr is Allah's secret, so do not try to uncover it.\"\nAhl as-Sunnah wa al-Jamah believe that everything is according to Allah's ordainment and measure. Allah says, \"Verily, all things have We created in proportion and measure.\"(54:49); and, \"It is He who created all things, and ordered them in due proportions.\" (25:2)\nAllah wills and decrees infidelity from the disbelievers. He is not pleased with it or nor does He like it, but that is His will with respect to creation (and allowing that thing), but He is not pleased with it as a way of life.\n\n\nIn his prayers, the Prophet Mohammad (sal lallaho alaihi vassal lam) used to say, \"O Allah, I seek refuge in Your pleasure from Your anger, and I seek refuge in your forgiveness from your punishment, and I seek refuge in You from You.\"\n\n\n\nConsider how the Prophet Mohammad (sal lallaho alaihi vassal lam) used to seek refuge in the attribute of pleasure from the attribute of anger, and from the action of forgiveness from the action of punishment. The first is for an attribute and the second for the consequences of an attribute. Then he tied them all together with His essence. He is in fact saying: \"What I seek refuge from happens by your decree & will, and what I seek refuge in is your pleasure and forgiveness, that also depend on Your decree & will. If You like to be kind to Your servant, you may forgive him. If You will to be angry to Him, You may punish him. Save me, therefore, from what You do not like and guard me against it. This will also be by not like and guard me against it. This will also be by Your will. Hence, the desirable and the undesirable both are by Your decree and will. Thus I seek refuge in You from You, in Your power, might nad mercy, from what Your power, might, justice and wisdom will do. I am not seeking refuge in anyone else from anyone else, nor am I seeking refuge in You from anything caused by anyone else. It is all caused by You.\"\n\n\nOne may ask: How is it that Allah decrees something yet He does not like it or approve of it? How can He will and create something and, at the same time, dislike and hate it?\nThen, know that will is of two kinds: one which is willed because and for itself, and the other which is willed because and for something else. The thing that is willed for itself is sought & loved for itself and for what it brings about it good. As for the thing which is willed because and for something else, it itself is not the goal of what is willed; it has no real benefit to it from itself, but is a means to the actual goal and will. Therefore, it is disliked by the willer from the point of view of its existence in itself; but what it leads to is the thing that is actually willed. It is similar to the medicine which is disliked though the one who takes it knows that it contains his cure. People often do things that they do not like in the hope that they will produce desired results, even if the results are probable and they cannot be certain about them.\n\n\n\nBut about the One Who has nothing hidden from Him? Allah may dislike something, but this does not counter His willing that thing for another purpose as it will be a cause for something that is beloved to Him. For example, Allah created Iblis. He is the being of wickedness in ways of life, actions, beliefs and volitions. He is the cause of many human beings' unhappiness and for their actions that are displeasing to Allah. At the same time, though, he is a means for many things that Allah will love to bestow on His creatures. Therefore, his existence is more beloved to Allah than his non-existence.\n\n\nReasons:\nBy creating Iblis, Allah demonstrates to His servants His ability to create opposites and contraries. He has created a being who is the most wicked and the cause of every wickedness. Yet, at the same time, He created his opposite, the angel Gabriel. Gabriel is on of the most noble of all creatures and a source of every good. Blessed be the Creator of the latter and the former. Similarly, this power of Allah's demonstrated in His creation of night & day, disease & cure, right & wrong, good & evil. This is a part of the detailed evidence of His perfect power, absolute authority, dominion and rule, for He has created those opposites. They are set up against one another. He has used them for meeting His goals. If the world were devoid of these opposites, we would not have witnessed the faultless wisdom. The absolute power and the perfect rule He has over all things.\n\n\nAllah says, \"And of everything We have created pairs, that you may remember (the Grace of Allâh).\" (51:49)\n\n\nSecondly, Iblis makes possible the manifestation of such names of Allah as show that He forbears, forgives, overlooks and forgoes the violations of His rights, and sets sinner free. If He had not created things which He detests but which makes possible, the manifestation of these names, these benefits and wisdom would have been lost. The Prophet Mohammad (sal lallaho alaihi vassal lam) referred to this points when he said, \"If you do not sin, Allah will remove you and put in your place a people who will sin and then ask Him to forgive them, that He may forgive them.\" (Muslim, At-Tawbah, 2749; At-Tirmidhi, Ad-Da'wat, 2526)\n\n\nThirdly, Iblis makes possible the manifestation of the wisdom and knowledge of the One who is wise & knowing, Who places things in their proper places, and nothing in the wrong place, as is dictated by His wisdom and knowledge. He knows to whom He should give His message. He knows who are fit for it and who will receive it gratefully and who are not fit for it. If desirable causes were removed because they produced evil consequences, the good things that outweigh these evils would have never been realized. Look at the sun, the moon and the wind. They produce good as well as evil but their good greatly outweighs their evil.\n\n\nFourthly, if Iblis had not been created, a number of things by which men affirm their servitude to Allah would have not occurred. The act of worship in Jihad is one of the most beloved acts of worship to Allah. If all the people were believers, that act of worship would be nullified as well as its consequences of having loyally and enmity for the sake of Allah. Similarly, the worship in the acts of commanding good and eradicating evil, in having patience, in going against one's desires, in sacrificing out of love for Allah, in repentance and asking forgiveness, in seeking refuge in Allah from being overtaken by his enemy, and being protected from the evil one's plot, and so on, are all part of the wisdom that the human mind would not have been able to discover (if it had not been for the creation of Iblis).\n\n\n\nOne cannot have an outcome without a cause, a consequence without having an antecedent. To achieve those good things, require the cause (creation of Iblis). When one experience evil whisperings and insinuations and tries to suppress them, one is fighting with satan, and that is certainly a sign of faith.\n\n\nIf one asks why Allah did not promote and strengthen the thing (with goodness) when He created it, the response is that His wisdom did not require it. It required only its creation. Its creation is good; evil enters into it because it has not been promoted and strengthened. One may ask then: why is it that Allah did not promote everything He created? This question is invalid. It assumes that the wise course is to pull all existing things on the same level. This is wrong. On the contrary, wisdom requires disparity between things, as it is apparent in this world. Disparity, it should be clear, does not rise from the creation of different varieties of things; rather, it arises from the absence of certain things that are not the object of creation. As for creation itself, there is no disparity.\n\n\n\nWe believe in all of these things, and we are certain that everything comes from Allah. His decision is never reversed, His command is never resisted, His will is never frustrated.\n\n\n\nNow it should be clear for those who wish to seek truth.\n\n\nFinally, knowledge is of two types: one existent (or accessible) in creation and one inaccessible in creation. To deny the knowledge that is existent is infidelity; to claim the knowledge that is inaccessible is also infidelity. Faith is not confirmed until a person accepts the knowledge that is existent and abandons seeking the knowledge which is inaccessible.\n\n\nInshaAllah Read more: http:\/\/www.systemoflife.com\/answering-islamophobes\/agniveer\/219-creation-of-universe-human-and-shaitan#ixzz3duCSfxPi\n","publisher":{"@id":"#Publisher","@type":"Organization","name":"VedKaBhed.Com Fast Server","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"\/wp-content\/themes\/jannah\/assets\/images\/logo@2x.png"}},"sourceOrganization":{"@id":"#Publisher"},"copyrightHolder":{"@id":"#Publisher"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"\/index.php\/2015\/06\/23\/creation-of-universe-human-and-shaitan\/","breadcrumb":{"@id":"#Breadcrumb"}},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"vedkabhed","url":"\/author\/vedkabhed\/"}}</script>
