Majority of us fail to understand the apparent confusion of so many religions, all seemingly claiming to be best. Religion has become the prime pretext for all the violence, terrorism, fights and havoc all around the world. Religion seems to be the primary theme governing the world politics and society, yet most of us do not know what exactly it is all about. Most of us simply know the names of major religions – Hinduism, Islam, Christianity, Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism, Bahai etc and keep hearing how basically all teach the same good things and how all religions are equal. We also keep hearing lot of irrational stuff from all religions and hence tend to believe somewhere deep inside that it should not be taken so seriously.\n<\/p>\n<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n<\/p>\n<p>Response:\n<\/p>\n<p>How much biased Agniveer is, is quite apparent if one goes completely through his articles.\n<\/p>\n<p>This portion of Agniveer is very well answered in the First Part of this article :http://www.systemoflife.com/answering-islamophobes/agniveer/224-religion-demystified-part-1-demystifying-religion-in-true-sense and Insha'allah all the hypothesis written here by Agniveer will be answered.\n<\/p>\n<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n<\/p>\n<p>Agniveer writes about Islam:\n<\/p>\n<p>Religions of Visionaries\n<\/p>\n<p>The other extreme is the cult of the 'visionaries' who see bit too much for normal people like you and me to appreciate and cross-verify even a small sample set of their 'visions'.\n<\/p>\n<p>This is the foundation of all Arabic religions like Judaism, Christianity or Islam. They are claimed to be founded by their respective Prophet(s) who saw things we could not see and told people what they should do to enjoy life after death and save themselves from troubles after death. Arab is a desert area that is known for mirage and hence it becomes confusing at times to ascertain if the prophets of these Arabic religions were having visions or mirage.\n<\/p>\n<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n<\/p>\n<p>Response:\n<\/p>\n<p>Agniveer again shows his biasness and ignorance by claiming that Islam has been founded by a Prophet who saw things we could not see.\n<\/p>\n<p>The religion of Islam is the Religion which our God chose for us. No prophet founded it. It existed since time immemorial as is apparent from the First Part of this article: http://www.systemoflife.com/answering-islamophobes/agniveer/224-religion-demystified-part-1-demystifying-religion-in-true-sense\n<\/p>\n<p>Also go through\nhttp://www.systemoflife.com/answering-islamophobes/agniveer\n<\/p>\n<p>Well as regards to Prophets having mirage, then Agniveer should be well aware that 'mirage is caused due to Reflection produced by bending of light rays coming from an already present object'. A mirage is a naturally occurring optical phenomenon in which light rays are bent to produce a displaced image of distant objects or the sky. <\/p>\n<p>Mirage is different from illusions. Things seen in Mirage do really exist, though not at that place but somewhere near that place, the reflection of which is seen as mirage. If that thing does not exist, then it's mirage is not possible. Mirages are not illusions.\n<\/p>\n<p>So Agniveer wanted to prove by referring to Prophets having mirage that the Prophets description about miracles, Hell, heaven etc were 'mirage' which Agniveer thought were illusions and not true.  But unfortunately, even if it was mirage (which is not the true case) then also the revelations and phenomenon and miracles were true, because mirage occurs only if that thing is present in reality.\n<\/p>\n<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n<\/p>\n<p>Agniveer disagrees with:\n<\/p>\n<p>Following are the salient beliefs of these religions:\n<\/p>\n<p>a. There is one God/Allah/Jehovah who created this world in 6/7/8 etc days and himself sits on some throne on 4th sky/ 7th sky/ Heaven etc.\n<\/p>\n<p>b. We all are created by this God\n<\/p>\n<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n<\/p>\n<p>Response:\n<\/p>\n<p>Yes there is only One God who is our creator and the only one worthy to be thanked and worshipped. (See the Qur'an Chapter 112 verse 1-4)\n<\/p>\n<p>The Qur'an mentions in several places that Allah created the heavens and the earth in six \"ayam\" (aeons) and then Istawa (rose over) the Throne (in a manner that suits His Majesty). One such verse is:\n<\/p>\n<p>The Qur'an Surah Hadid Chapter 57 verse 4:\n<\/p>\n<p>He it is Who created the heavens and the earth in six \"ayam\" (aeons) and then Istawa (rose over) the Throne (in a manner that suits His Majesty). He knows what goes into the earth and what comes forth from it, what descends from the heaven and what ascends thereto. And He is with you (by His Knowledge) wheresoever you may be. And Allah is the All-Seer of what you do.\n<\/p>\n<p>The correct meaning in this verse is \"aeons\" for the Arabic term \"ayam,\" which shows that heavens where created in 6 aeons, 6 long periods of time. Science does not contradict this at all, due to the fact there Science says it COULD have been created in 6 aeons.\n<\/p>\n<p>Allah is above the throne as\nSurah Hadid 57:4\nsays, and it also symbolic that he has authority and rose over the throne, the throne of authority, signifying that he is the One and only creator of everything. Allah is LITERALLY above the throne, which no-one can imagine or see and which is nothing like us.\n<\/p>\n<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n<\/p>\n<p>Agniveer disagrees with Islamic concept that:\n<\/p>\n<p>c. We all are being tested by the God.\n<\/p>\n<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n<\/p>\n<p>Response:\n<\/p>\n<p>Kindly Note:\nIn the Article 'Understanding Vedic God' , Agniveer writes under the heading <\/p>\n<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------\n<\/p>\n<p>Q: Should we worship Ishwar or not? Why? After all He never forgives!\n<\/p>\n<p>A: Ishwar should be worshipped and He alone should be worshipped.\n<\/p>\n<p>It is true that by worship of Ishwar, you will not receive any shortcut pass certificate when you have actually failed. Only lazy and cheaters desire such unscrupulous means to success.\n<\/p>\n<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------\n<\/p>\n<p>Just see and read the phrase \"will not receive any shortcut pass certificate when you have actually failed.\" Just ask yourself, will you get a pass certificate or will you fail without undergoing or giving any Test?\n<\/p> Qur'an 67:2 - Allah has created death and life, that He may test you which of you is best in deed. Qur'an 2:155 - And certainly, We shall test you with something of fear, hunger, loss of wealth, lives and fruits, but give glad tidings to As-Sabirin (the patient ones, etc.). Qur'an 3:140 - If a wound (and killing) has touched you, be sure a similar wound (and killing) has touched the others. And so are the days (good and not so good), We give to men by turns, that Allah may test those who believe, and that He may take martyrs from among you. Qur'an 5:48 - If Allah willed, He would have made you one nation, but that (He) may test you in what He has given you; so strive as in a race in good deeds. The return of you (all) is to Allah; then He will inform you about that in which you used to differ. Qur'an 18:7 - Verily! We have made that which is on earth as an adornment for it, in order that We may test them (mankind) as to which of them are best in deeds. Qur'an 29:2 - Do people think that they will be left alone because they say: \"We believe,\" and will not be tested. <p>Even Agniveer knows that this life is a test for the Hereafter and according to our deeds we will be judged in the hereafter and will either be given a pass certificate or fail.\n<\/p>\n<p>Agniveer tries hard to hide these truth which are quite apparent but still they show outwardly that they don't believe it in order to deviate people from coming and knowing their inborn actual religion of submitting oneself to our creator.\n<\/p>\n<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n<\/p>\n<p>Agniveer claims:\n<\/p>\n<p>d. God sends his Prophet(s) to guide the less privileged people. Only by following the most latest prophet can one go to Heaven, else he or she shall go to Hell which is place for torture. Review God must be crazy! to analyze this.\n<\/p>\n<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n<\/p>\n<p>Response:\n<\/p>\n<p>God sent Prophets to every nation, not only to guide and warn the less privileged people but also the privileged ones.\n<\/p>\n<p>By saying 'Only by following the most latest prophet can one go to Heaven' Agniveer wanted to say that the diffenet prophets preached different things.\n<\/p>\n<p>This has been already answered in the First Part of this article under the heading: Did different Prophets/Messengers preach different things?\n<\/p>\n<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n<\/p>\n<p>Agniveer claims:\n<\/p>\n<p>e. There is no way one can question these prophets. Questioning them is like insulting God and hence dispatches us to Hell.\n<\/p>\n<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n<\/p>\n<p>Response:\n<\/p>\n<p>Again a blatant misconception/misinformation showing the biasness of Agniveer. Nowhere does the Qur'an or any authentic Ahadith says that questioning the prophet is like insulting God and will make us eligible for Hell.\n<\/p>\n<p>On the Contrary Islam encourages questioning, questions related to faith, Qur'an etc.\n<\/p>\n<p>Islam forbids useless questions which were asked to the prophet (pbuh) like `who is my father?' `Where is my camel?' etc.\n<\/p>\n<p>People used to ask such useless questions to the Messenger of Allah to mock him.\n<\/p>\n<p>Allah said in\nChapter 5 verse 101,\n<\/p>\n<p>O you who believe! Ask not about things which, if made plain to you, may cause you trouble. But if you ask about them while the Quran is being revealed, they will be made plain to you. Allah has forgiven that, and Allah is Oft Forgiving, Most Forbearing.\n<\/p>\n<p>This Ayah refers to good conduct that Allah is teaching His believing servants, by forbidding them from asking about useless things. Since if they get the answers they sought, they might be troublesome for them and difficult on their ears. Al-Bukhari recorded that Anas bin Malik said, \"The Messenger of Allah gave a speech unlike anything I heard before. In this speech, he said,\n<\/p>\n<p>«لَو تَعْلَمُونَ مَا أَعْلَمُ، لَضَحِكْتُمْ قَلِيلًا، وَلَبَكَيْتُمْ كَثِيرًا»\n<\/p>\n<p>(If you but know what I know, you will laugh little and cry a lot.) The companions of Allah's Messenger covered their faces and the sound of crying was coming out of their chests. A man asked, `Who is my father' The Prophet said, `So-and-so'. This Ayah was later revealed,\n<\/p>\n<p>﴿لاَ تَسْأَلُواْ عَنْ أَشْيَآءَ﴾\n<\/p>\n<p>(Ask not about things...).'' Muslim, Ahmad, At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasa'i recorded this Hadith.\n<\/p>\n<p>Anas bin Malik narrated that once, the people were questioning the Messenger of Allah until they made him angry. So he ascended the Minbar and said,\n<\/p>\n<p>«لَا تَسْأَلُونِي الْيَوْمَ عَنْ شَيْءٍ إِلَّا بَيَّنْتُهُ لَكُم»\n<\/p>\n<p>(You will not ask me about anything today but I will explain it to you.) So the Companions of the Messenger of Allah feared that it was the commencement of a momentous event, and I looked to my right and left and found only people who covered their faces, crying. An argumentative man who was said to be the son of someone other than his true father asked, \"O Allah's Messenger! Who is my father The Prophet said, `Your father is Hudhafah.'' `Umar stood up (when he saw anger on the Prophet's face) and said, \"We accept Allah as our Lord, Islam as our religion and Muhammad as our Messenger, I seek refuge with Allah from the evil of the Fitan (trials in life and religion).'' The Messenger of Allah said,\n<\/p>\n<p>«لَمْ أَرَ فِي الْخَيْرِ وَالشَّرِّ كَالْيَومِ قَطُّ، صُوِّرَتْ لِي الجَنَّةُ وَالنَّارُ حَتَّى رَأَيْتُهُمَا دُونَ الْحَائِط»\n<\/p>\n<p>(I have never witnessed both goodness and evil like I have today. Paradise and the Fire were shown to me and I saw them before that wall.) This Hadith was recorded in the Two Sahihs from Sa`id. Al-Bukhari recorded that Ibn `Abbas said, \"Some people used to question the Messenger of Allah to mock him. One of them would ask, `Who is my father,' while another would ask, `Where is my camel,' when he lost his camel. Allah sent down this Ayah about them.\n<\/p>\n<p>People used to question the Messenger of Allah to mock him, like `who is my father?' `Where is my camel?' etc.\n<\/p>\n<p>Such Useless questioning is prohibited in Islam. This verse of the Qur'an prohibits useless questions, and simultaneously encourages questioning about the verses of the Qur'an being revealed.\n<\/p>\n<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n<\/p>\n<p>Agniveer claims:\n<\/p>\n<p>f. Heaven and Hell are eternal. This life is the only life. \n<\/p>\n<p>i. These cults believe that one day world will come to an end when people would be taken out from their graves and brought to a court where God will be judge and their respective prophet would be the lawyer. He shall take variety of evidences and then decide who shall go to Hell and who shall go to Heaven. And then Heaven or Hell will be eternal.\n<\/p>\n<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n<\/p>\n<p>No big deal in that. It is quite logical. Yes this life is the only life. A person if he wants to improve, has to improve within this lifetime. If not, he will have to bear the punishment.\n<\/p>\n<p>Now a days we find Hindu terrorists reigning supreme be it LTTE or any other group. I think this is because they think, that they have countless umber of lives and chances to improve. Let's enjoy this life and we will improve in the next life. Let's propagate false notions about various religions and degrade the inborn religion, Islam, hiding behind the bush, because we have many births to improve ourselves. We will not be questioned. We are not being tested.\n<\/p>\n<p>I think that this is the reason Priests like Swami Nityananda and many much more swamis have started their business of Sex-trading.\n<\/p>\n<p>It's really pathetic!\n<\/p>\n<p>The concept of 'this life being the only life' and the result being 'Hell or Heaven' is more logical rather than the concept of the cycle of birth and rebirth as propounded by the Hindus.\n<\/p>\n<p>If a class 10th student is told by his father that if he is doesn't pass in the first attempt then he will be compelled to discontinue his studies. Then, how he will study? He will put all his efforts to pass exam in his first attempt itself. On contrary, those who think they have many attempts will put less effort.\n<\/p>\n<p>Hell is eternal for only disbelievers. Any believer, after being punished for his sins in the Hell, will eventually at some point of time, be made dwellers of Heaven.\n<\/p>\n<p>Every nation lays down certain rules and regulations for it's citizens to follow. If one follows the basic regulations, then he is eligible to enjoy all the rights of the nation.\n<\/p>\n<p>If he violates certain regulations, then he commits a crime. He has to go through the penalty for sometime and after that he is free to enjoy the rights of that nation.\n<\/p>\n<p>If he violates all the basic regulations since the beginning and even after knowing his fault that he is going against the nation's conduct, he violates the law just to serve his vain desires, then he is eligible for strict punishment only and can never enjoy the rights of the nation.\n<\/p>\n<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n<\/p>\n<p>Agniveer claims:\n<\/p>\n<p>g. Judaism considers Moses as the final Prophet, Christians consider Jesus and Muslims consider Muhammad as final one. Each of them brought his own final edition of God's message. The fight among them is related to this controversy. Further, each of them is divided into huge number of sects which have there own different versions/ interpretations of the final book. \n<\/p>\n<p>h. Muhammad being most pragmatic put an end to this Prophet business by claiming to be the Final Prophet till the world comes to an end. But some sects of Islam, claim to have new Prophets who only add upon existing message of Muhammad. The most prominent of these cults is Qadiyanis who consider Mirza Ghulam Ahmed to be final prophet. That is why other cults call Qadiyanis as Kafirs (non-Muslims) and hate them.\n<\/p>\n<p>(Ironically, Zakir Naik has copied all his work from Qadiyani literature word by word, letter by letter, and promotes their Qadiyani specific views to claim popularity as expert of comparative religions. That is why this creates suspicion that he is actually a Qadiyani in disguise. Refer Dr Zakir Naik's fraud exposed on this site.)\n<\/p>\n<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n<\/p>\n<p>Response:\n<\/p>\n<p>There are several Ayat testifying to the fact that Allah alone is the One Who guides and misguides, and similarly several authentic Ahadith and verse in the Qur'an (Surah Ahzab Chapter 33 verse 40) that Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) is the last of all messengers and apostle, contrary to the belief of the Qadiyani sect. They rely on their unclear understanding of an Ayat, thus avoiding what is clear and contradicts their desires. Theirs is the method of the people who follow their lust, desire and wickedness. An authentic Hadith narrated,\n<\/p>\n<p>«إِذَا رَأَيْتُمُ الَّذِينَ يَتَّبِعُونَ مَا تَشَابَهَ مِنْهُ فَأُولئِكَ الَّذِينَ سَمَّى اللهُ فَاحْذَرُوهُمْ»\n<\/p>\n<p>(When you see those who follow what is not so clear in it (the Qur'an), then they are those whom Allah has mentioned (refer to 3:7). Hence, avoid them.)\n<\/p>\n<p>The Prophet was referring to Allah's statement,\n<\/p>\n<p>﴿فَأَمَّا الَّذِينَ فى قُلُوبِهِمْ زَيْغٌ فَيَتَّبِعُونَ مَا تَشَـبَهَ مِنْهُ ابْتِغَآءَ الْفِتْنَةِ وَابْتِغَآءَ تَأْوِيلِهِ﴾\n<\/p>\n<p>(So as for those in whose hearts there is a deviation (from the truth) they follow that which is not entirely clear thereof, seeking Al-Fitnah (polytheism and trials), and seeking for its hidden meanings)(3:7).\n<\/p>\n<p>Verily, no innovator in the religion could ever rely on any authentic evidence in the Qur'an that testifies to his innovation. The Qur'an came to distinguish between truth and falsehood, and guidance and misguidance. The Qur'an does not contain any discrepancies or contradictions, because it is a revelation from the Most Wise, Worthy of all praise.\n<\/p>\n<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n<\/p>\n<p>Agniveer claims: \n<\/p>\n<p>j. The entire fight in West today is on following:\n<\/p>\n<p>- Which of the cults of Islam is the true cult of God? Shia, Sunni, Qadiyani etc.\n<\/p>\n<p>- Which is true religion? Judaism, Christianity or Islam? \n<\/p>\n<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n<\/p>\n<p>Response:\n<\/p>\n<p>As explained earlier, Islam is the true and pure religion, from our Only Creator. It has no divisions. Those who have divided the religion or derived any New religion out of it, is surely going against the Qur'an and is diverting from true guidance. A true Muslim is the One following the Qur'an and the authentic sayings and guidance of the Messengers. There are many who claim to follow these but their practices and beliefs clearly contradicts the Qur'an.\n<\/p>\n<p>Allah says in the\nQur'an in Chapter 6 verse 159: Verily, those who divide their religion and break up into sects (all kinds of religious sects), you (O Muhammad SAW) have no concern in them in the least. Their affair is only with Allah, Who then will tell them what they used to do.\n<\/p>\n<p>Qur'an 3: 103 - And hold fast, all of you together, to the Rope of Allah (i.e. this Quran), and be not divided among yourselves,\n<\/p>\n<p>Surely those who deny the verses of the Qur'an, then whoever he might be, is not on true guidance.\n<\/p>\n<p>Allah says in\nThe Qur'an in\nChapter 3 verse 73\n<\/p>\n<p>﴿قُلْ إِنَّ الْهُدَى هُدَى اللَّهِ﴾\n<\/p>\n<p>(Say: (O Prophet) \"Verily, right guidance is the guidance of Allah.'')\n<\/p> Qur'an Chapter 3 verse 101: …And whoever holds firmly to Allah, (i.e. follows Islam Allahs Religion, and obeys all that Allah has ordered, practically), then he is indeed guided to a Right Path. Qur'an Chapter 3 verse 103:  And hold fast, all of you together, to the Rope of Allah (i.e. this Quran), and be not divided among yourselves, and remember Allah's Favour on you,… Qur'an Chapter 3 verse 105: And be not as those who divided and differed among themselves after the clear proofs had come to them. It is they for whom there is an awful torment. <p>It is hard to see that among the options given for one in the West to select the True Religion, Agniveer didn't mention Hinduism. I guess, he agrees that Hinduism is actually teachings of men, not of the Almighty God and the Western people knows this fact that they cannot be fooled with illogical Hinduism.\n<\/p>\n<p>Allah says in\nThe Qur'an\nChapter 3 verse 19\n<\/p>\n<p>Truly, the religion with Allah is (submitting your will to Allah) Islam. Those who were given the Scripture (Jews and Christians) did not differ except, out of mutual jealousy, after knowledge had come to them. And whoever disbelieves in the Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, signs, revelations, etc.) of Allah, then surely, Allah is Swift in calling to account.\n<\/p> Qur'an 12:40 - \"….Allah has commanded that you worship none but Him (i.e. His Monotheism), that is the (true) straight religion, but most men know not. Qur'an 30:30 - So set you (O Muhammad SAW) your face towards the religion of pure Islamic Monotheism Hanifa (worship none but Allah Alone) Allahs Fitrah (i.e. Allahs Islamic Monotheism), with which He has created mankind. No change let there be in Khalqillah (i.e. the Religion of Allah Islamic Monotheism), that is the straight religion, but most of men know not. (Tafsir AtTabaree, Vol 21, Page 41) Qur'an 98:5 - And they were commanded not, but that they should worship Allah, and worship none but Him\nAlone (abstaining from ascribing partners to Him), and perform As-Salat (Iqamat-as-Salat) and give\nZakat: and that is the right religion. <p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n<\/p>\n<p>Agniveer claims:\n<\/p>\n<p>k. Jews (follower of Judaism) do not fight much because they consider themselves to be privileged ones having message of God. They thus do not get into competition of expanding their population base. There fight is restricted to unfriendly neighbors 9Arab countries) whose religious books term Jews as worst of the lot. But for Islam and Christianity, one of the most important performance metric set by God to qualify for Heaven is the number of people they can bring into their respective folds.\n<\/p>\n<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n<\/p>\n<p>Response:\n<\/p>\n<p>This clearly exposes the Biasness of Agniveer and it's hatred towards Islam. But, he needs to learn again the A,B,C,D 's ….. of Islam, then open up his biased mouth to comment.\n<\/p>\n<p>We Muslims, are commanded to inform others of the Truth of Islam, their inborn religion. We have no authority to convert them or guide them, but only to convey the message. Even Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) and all the previous Messengers (peace be upon them all) had no authority to convert any one.\n<\/p>\n<p>The messenger's duty is only to convey the message and this is mentioned in several places in the Qur'an. I am only giving examples of few,\n<\/p> (your duty is only to convey and on Us is the reckoning)\nQur'an 13:40 The Messenger's duty is only to convey in a clear way) \nQur'an 24:54 (So remind them -- you are only one who reminds. You are not a dictator over them.)\nQur'an 88:21-22 <p>Allah said in\nChapter 2 verse 256,\n<\/p>\n<p>﴿لاَ إِكْرَاهَ فِى الدِّينِ﴾\n<\/p>\n<p>(There is no compulsion in religion), meaning, \"Do not force anyone to become Muslim, for Islam is plain and clear, and its proofs and evidence are plain and clear. Therefore, there is no need to force anyone to embrace Islam. Rather, whoever Allah directs to Islam, opens his heart for it and enlightens his mind, will embrace Islam with certainty. Whoever Allah blinds his heart and seals his hearing and sight, then he will not benefit from being forced to embrace Islam.''\n<\/p>\n<p>If we convey the message and the seeker of Truth realizes that Islam is the ultimate truth, then this is not called converting. It is called serving mankind by telling them the truth and every service done to any animate thing is a performance metric for us Muslims and we get rewarded for that with good deeds.\n<\/p>\n<p>Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) had said: \"There is a reward for serving any animate (living being)\" <\/p> <p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n<\/p>\n<p>Agniveer claims:\n<\/p>\n<p>l. Each of these religions claims to be religion of peace. However the only rider is that this peace is for believers only. Non-believers are not tolerated in them. The level of tolerance has reduced chronologically. Thus Jews keep to themselves, but Christians allow use of sword and deceit to convert people. Islam goes a step further ahead by claiming that those who fight in path of promoting Allah and die become the recipient of best facilities in Heaven.\n<\/p>\n<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n<\/p>\n<p>Response:\n<\/p>\n<p>Islam is the most tolerant of all religion which orders a believer to respect, love, and care for the unbelievers, those who have done nothing like attacking or cheating the Muslim Ummah.\n<\/p>\n<p>Only at times of war, when the disbelievers have cheated, then only Muslims are commanded to fight the disbelievers, but if they demand peace, reconciliation, then Muslims are ordered to be tolerant to them even at times of war.\n<\/p>\n<p>Allah forbids unnecessary attacking or hurting the disbelievers. Moreover, even if the unbelievers attack you, and during the course of war, demand your protection, then Muslims are commanded to give them protection and to take them to a secure place.\n<\/p>\n<p>Allah says in The Qur'an Chapter 9 verse 5:\n<\/p>\n<p>And if anyone of the Mushrikoon (polytheists, idolaters, pagans, disbelievers in the Oneness of Allah) seeks your protection then grant him protection, so that he may hear the Word of Allah (the Qur'an), and then escort him to where he can be secure, that is because they are men who know not.\n<\/p>\n<p>How much more tolerant can one be?\n<\/p>\n<p>Allah says in\nThe Qur'an Chapter 60 verse 8:\n<\/p>\n<p>Allah does not forbid you to deal justly and kindly with those who fought not against you on account of religion and did not drive you out of your homes. Verily, Allah loves those who deal with equity.\n<\/p>\n<p>Imam Ahmad recorded that Asma' bint Abu Bakr said, \"My mother, who was an idolatress at the time, came to me during the Treaty of Peace, the Prophet conducted with the Quraysh. I came to the Prophet and said, `O Allah's Messenger! My mother came visiting, desiring something from me, should I treat her with good relations' The Prophet said,\n<\/p>\n<p>«نَعَمْ صِلِي أُمَّك»\n<\/p>\n<p>(Yes. Keep good relation with your mother.)'' The Two Sahihs recorded this Hadith. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin Zubayr said, \"Qutaylah came visiting her daughter, Asma' bint Abi Bakr, with some gifts, such as Dibab, cheese and clarified (cooking) butter, and she was an idolatress at that time. Asma' refused to accept her mother's gifts and did not let her enter her house. `A'ishah asked the Prophet about his verdict and Allah sent down the Ayah,\n60:8\n(Allah does not forbid you with those who fought not against you on account of religion) until the end of the Ayah. Allah's Messenger ordered Asma' to accept her mother's gifts and to let her enter her house.''\n<\/p>\n<p>Islam is Alhamdolillah the Most tolerant of all religions, because it is the Only religion (the religion of submitting yourself to Almighty God) which our Creator chose for us.\n<\/p>\n<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n<\/p>\n<p>Agniveer claims:\n<\/p>\n<p>n. Existence of miracles is supposed to be greatest proofs of validity of these religions. It is a different matter that the evidence, description and testimony of these miracles are restricted to their respective books only. Some of the miracles are Moses splitting the Red Sea, Jesus reviving back to life after crucification, Virgin Mary giving birth to Jesus, Muhammad splitting the moon, Muhammad traveling to 7th sky on a girl-faced donkey (Buraq) through Miraj Travels in a night, Muhammad having revelations coming from an angel called Gabriel etc.\n<\/p>\n<p>One has to blindly believe in all this to escape Hell and achieve Heaven.\n<\/p>\n<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n<\/p>\n<p>Response:\n<\/p>\n<p>Again the illiteracy of Agniveer is prominent when he claims that One has to blindly believe in all this to escape Hell and achieve Heaven.\n<\/p>\n<p>Allah shows signs everywhere about the truth of Islam being the only religion of Our Creator. Among the six articles of faith there is not one which says that we have to believe in these miracles, even though these are true, to go to Heaven.\n<\/p> Moses (pbuh) did split the Red Sea with Allah's permission. Jesus (pbuh) was born miraculously without any male intervention, but by Allah's permission. Jesus (pbuh) was not crucified. He has been raised up alive and will come before the Day of Judgment. Muhammad (pbuh) did split the moon. Muhammad (pbuh) did go for Miraj, but not on a girl-faced donkey and neither through Miraj travels (which Agniveer falsely says without any proof. Agniveer's lies are quite evident) Not only Muhammad (pbuh), every prophet of Allah received revelations. <p>All these were Signs, rather than miracles. In the description of these events, The Qur'an does not use the technical Arabic word for miracle\nالمعجزات (Muadjiza) literally meaning \"that by means of which confounds, overwhelms, his opponents\". It rather uses the term 'Ayah' (literally meaning sign).\n<\/p>\n<p>Though these are Signs performed with Allah's permission, It is not an article of faith to believe in them to attain Paradise.\n<\/p>\n<p>But a believer believes that Allah can show us any signs if He wills.\n<\/p>\n<p>The Qur'an itself is a miracle. Moreover, there are numerous scientific miracles also mentioned in the Qur'an.\n<\/p>\n<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n<\/p>\n<p>Agniveer claims:\n<\/p>\n<p>o. These religions are silent on status of animals and insects – whether they have soul, will they go to Heaven/hell, in what form etc.\n<\/p>\n<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n<\/p>\n<p> Response:\n<\/p>\n<p>Islam is never silent on any issues if it is an important matter or a matter of concern, because it is the only universal religion not bounded to any specific types of people, region etc.\n<\/p>\n<p>One verse from the Word of Our Creator, the\nQur'an Chapter 6 verse 38\nanswers your queries and reminds that Allah never neglects anything:\n<\/p>\n<p>There is not a moving (living) creature on earth, nor a bird that flies with its two wings, but are communities like you. We have neglected nothing in the Book, then unto their Lord they (all) shall be gathered.\n<\/p>\n<p>Allah's statement,\n<\/p>\n<p>﴿مَّا فَرَّطْنَا فِى الكِتَـبِ مِن شَىْءٍ﴾\n<\/p>\n<p>(We have neglected nothing in the Book,) means, the knowledge about all things is with Allah, and He never forgets any of His creatures, nor their sustenance, nor their affairs, whether these creatures live in the sea or on land. In another Ayah, Allah said;\n<\/p>\n<p>﴿وَمَا مِن دَآبَّةٍ فِي الاٌّرْضِ إِلاَّ عَلَى اللَّهِ رِزْقُهَا وَيَعْلَمُ مُسْتَقَرَّهَا وَمُسْتَوْدَعَهَا كُلٌّ فِى كِتَابٍ مُّبِينٍ ﴾\n<\/p>\n<p>(And no moving creature is there on earth but its provision is due from Allah. And He knows its dwelling place and its deposit (in the uterus, grave, etc.). All is in a Clear Book.) ﴿11:6﴾, there is a record of their names, numbers, movements, and lack of movement.\n<\/p>\n<p>﴾Ibn Abi Hatim reported that Ibn `Abbas said about the\nQur'an Chapter 6 ayah 38,\n<\/p>\n<p>﴿ثُمَّ إِلَى رَبِّهِمْ يُحْشَرُونَ﴾\n<\/p>\n<p>(then unto their Lord they (all) shall be gathered.) \"Death gathers them.'' It was also said that the Day of Resurrection gathers them, for in another Ayah, Allah said;\n<\/p>\n<p>﴿وَإِذَا الْوُحُوشُ حُشِرَتْ ﴾\n<\/p>\n<p>(And when the wild beasts shall be gathered together.) ﴿81:5﴾ `Abdur-Razzaq recorded that Abu Hurayrah said about Allah's statement,\n<\/p>\n<p>﴿إِلاَّ أُمَمٌ أَمْثَـلُكُمْ مَّا فَرَّطْنَا فِى الكِتَـبِ مِن شَىْءٍ ثُمَّ إِلَى رَبِّهِمْ يُحْشَرُونَ﴾\n<\/p>\n<p>(but are Umam like you. We have neglected nothing in the Book, then unto their Lord they (all) shall be gathered.) \"All creatures will be gathered on the Day of Resurrection, the beasts, birds and all others.\n<\/p>\n<p>The Qur'an applies the word \"Muslim\" not only to humans but also to animals and the inanimate world. \"The divine will manifests itself in the form of laws both in human society and in the world of nature.\" In Islamic terminology, for example, a bee is a Muslim precisely because it lives and dies obeying the sharia that God has prescribed for the community of bees, just as a person is a Muslim by virtue of the fact that he or she submits to the revealed sharia ordained for humans in the Qur'an and Sunnah.\n<\/p>\n<p>This fact is very much clear by the verse of the Qur'an Chapter 22 verse 18\nwhere Allah says,\n<\/p>\n<p>See you not that to Allah prostrates whoever is in the heavens and whoever is on the earth, and the sun, and the moon, and the stars, and the mountains, and the trees, and Ad-Dawab (moving living creatures, beasts, etc.), and many of mankind? But there are many (men) on whom the punishment is justified. And whomsoever Allah disgraces, none can honour him. Verily! Allah does what He wills.\n<\/p>\n<p>Animals and other living things were created by Allah, the Lord of the Universe. They have their own independent existences and modes of living.  (55:10)\n<\/p>\n<p>Allah says in\nThe Qur'an in 3:185, 21:35 and 29:57\n<\/p>\n<p>\"Every soul shall have a taste of death in the end to us shall you be brought back.\"\n<\/p>\n<p>It is quite clear from the above verse that anything which has a soul will die. We know that plants die, we know that animals die, so they all have souls. And all of them will be returned to Allah and assembled together on the day of Judgment.\n<\/p>\n<p>Many passages from the Qur'an and Ahadith state that all animals are endowed with spirit and mind and \"…there is ample evidence in the Qur'an to suggest that animals' consciousness of spirit and mind is of a degree higher than mere instinct and intuition. We are told in the Qur'an that animals have a cognizance of their Creator and, hence, they pay their obeisance to Him by adoration and worship: Seest thou not that it is Allah Whose praises are celebrated by all beings in the heavens and on earth, and by the birds with extended wings? Each one knows its prayer and psalm, And Allah is aware of what they do. (Qur'an 24:41).\n<\/p>\n<p>It is worth noting the statement that 'each one knows its prayer and psalm'. The execution of a voluntary act, performed consciously and intentionally, requires a faculty higher than that of instinct and intuition. Lest some people should doubt that animals could have such a faculty, the following verse points out that it is human ignorance that prevents them from understanding this phenomenon: The seven heavens and the earth and all things therein declare His glory. There is not a thing but celebrates His adoration; and yet ye mankind! ye understand not how do they declare His glory…(Qur'an 17:44).\n<\/p>\n<p>For more visit:\nhttp://islamictreasure.wordpress.com/2010/10/31/animals-in-islam/\n<\/p>\n<p>There will be animals in Paradise insha'allah.\n<\/p>\n<p>Go through this:\nhttp://www.islam-qa.com/en/ref/14404/animals%20in%20paradise\n<\/p>\n<p>For more details and to see all stupid claims of Agniveer about Islamic paradise being answered and his knowledge being exposed, kindly visit:\n<\/p>\n<p>http://truthofhinduism.com/rebuttals/answering-agniveer/rebuttal-to-allegationmisconception-superstitions-about-islamic-paradise/\n<\/p>\n<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n<\/p>\n<p>Agniveer claims:\n<\/p>\n<p>q. Muslim countries are most rigid on religious beliefs. If one questions Quran in Islamic country, as per Sharia, he is liable to be killed. Muslim clerics can still tolerate questioning of Allah, but if their Prophet is questioned, they start proclaiming fatwa of death for the questioner. Thus unlike Jew or Christian people, most Muslims live in fear of adverse eventualities if they question Islam. Many other start rationalizing this and most others are brainwashed to believe that Islam alone is best, regardless of whether they know Arabic, have ever understood Quran or can critically examine Islam.\n<\/p>\n<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n<\/p>\n<p> Response:\n<\/p>\n<p>Wrong again !\n<\/p>\n<p>No sensible Person will question against the Qur'an. If in doubt, one can surely question and ask the people and learned men who knows as is mentioned in the Qur'an 16:43.\n<\/p>\n<p>Qur'an forbids unnecessary useless questions as already discussed earlier in answer to point (e).\n<\/p>\n<p>Again a lie that Muslim clerics can tolerate questioning of Allah, but not of Prophet. I don't know how biased a person like Agniveer can be. He is claiming to be unbiased and on the other hand giving information about Hinduism in the disguise of Islam.\n<\/p>\n<p>See again answer to point (e).\n<\/p>\n<p>If anyone starts examining the Qur'an critically then Insha'allah he/she will accept Islam, leave aside questioning as had been the case with many reverts to Islam. This is the reason Arya Samajis like Agniveer, and all those who are biased and bent on deviating people from the truth , don't read or critically examine the Qur'an as a whole, because if they do so, they will insha'allah accept Islam.\n<\/p>\n<p>But as is obvious, Agniveer's mission in this birth life and all his supposed cycles, is to hinder people from the Truth.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nInshaAllah Read more: http://www.systemoflife.com/answering-islamophobes/agniveer/225-religion-demystified-part-2-refuting-the-false-and-wrong-informations-given-by-agniveer#ixzz3duGQGT5F\n<\/p>\n","name":"Religion Demystified - Refuting false lies of Agniveer Part 2 - VedKaBhed.Com Fast Server","@id":"/index.php/2015/06/23/religion-demystified-refuting-false-lies-of-agniveer-part-2/#richSnippet","isPartOf":{"@id":"/index.php/2015/06/23/religion-demystified-refuting-false-lies-of-agniveer-part-2/#webpage"},"inLanguage":"en-US","mainEntityOfPage":{"@id":"/index.php/2015/06/23/religion-demystified-refuting-false-lies-of-agniveer-part-2/#webpage"}}]}</script>

</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:red;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"><em>The purpose of this article is to present an unbiased layman view of religions as of today. Majority of us fail to understand the apparent confusion of so many religions, all seemingly claiming to be best. Religion has become the prime pretext for all the violence, terrorism, fights and havoc all around the world. Religion seems to be the primary theme governing the world politics and society, yet most of us do not know what exactly it is all about. Most of us simply know the names of major religions – <strong>Hinduism</strong>, Islam, Christianity, Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism, Bahai etc and keep hearing how basically all teach the same good things and how all religions are equal. We also keep hearing lot of irrational stuff from all religions and hence tend to believe somewhere deep inside that it should not be taken so seriously.</em></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>

</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">How much biased Agniveer is, is quite apparent if one goes completely through his articles.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">This portion of Agniveer is very well answered in the First Part of this article <a title=":" href="http://www.systemoflife.com/answering-islamophobes/agniveer/224-religion-demystified-part-1-demystifying-religion-in-true-sense" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="color:blue;text-decoration:underline;">:</span><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></span><span style="color:blue;"><a href="/2015/06/23/religion-demystified-demystifying-religion-in-true-sense-part-1/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;text-decoration:underline;">http://www.systemoflife.com/answering-islamophobes/agniveer/224-religion-demystified-part-1-demystifying-religion-in-true-sense</span></a><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"> and Insha’allah all the hypothesis written here by Agniveer will be answered.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>

<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Agniveer again shows his biasness and ignorance by claiming that Islam has been founded by a Prophet who saw things we could not see.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">The religion of Islam is the Religion which our God chose for us. No prophet founded it. It existed since time immemorial as is apparent from the First Part of this article: </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><a href="/2015/06/23/religion-demystified-demystifying-religion-in-true-sense-part-1/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="color:blue;text-decoration:underline;">http://www.systemoflife.com/answering-islamophobes/agniveer/224-religion-demystified-part-1-demystifying-religion-in-true-sense</span></a><br>

</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Well as regards to Prophets having mirage, then Agniveer should be well aware that ‘mirage is caused due to Reflection produced by bending of light rays coming from an already present object’. A mirage is a naturally occurring optical phenomenon in which light rays are bent to produce a displaced image of distant objects or the sky. </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Mirage is different from illusions. Things seen in Mirage do really exist, though not at that place but somewhere near that place, the reflection of which is seen as mirage. If that thing does not exist, then it’s mirage is not possible. Mirages are not illusions.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">So Agniveer wanted to prove by referring to Prophets having mirage that the Prophets description about miracles, Hell, heaven etc were ‘mirage’ which Agniveer thought were illusions and not true.  But unfortunately, even if it was mirage (which is not the true case) then also the revelations and phenomenon and miracles were true, because mirage occurs only if that thing is present in reality.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>

</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:red;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"><em>a. There is one God/Allah/Jehovah who created this world in 6/7/8 etc days and himself sits on some throne on 4th sky/ 7th sky/ Heaven etc.</em></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>

<p><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"><strong>Response:</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"><span style="color:#333399;">Yes there is only One God who is our creator and the only one worthy to be thanked and worshipped.</span> (See the <strong>Qur’an Chapter 112 verse 1-4</strong>)</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"><span style="color:#333399;">The Qur’an mentions in several places that Allah created the heavens and the earth in six</span> “ayam” (aeons) <span style="color:#333399;">and then Istawa (rose over) the Throne (in a manner that suits His Majesty). One such verse is:</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"><strong>The Qur’an Surah Hadid Chapter 57 verse 4</strong>:</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">He it is Who created the heavens and the earth in six “ayam” (aeons) and then Istawa (rose over) the Throne (in a manner that suits His Majesty). He knows what goes into the earth and what comes forth from it, what descends from the heaven and what ascends thereto. And He is with you (by His Knowledge) wheresoever you may be. And Allah is the All-Seer of what you do.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"><span style="color:#333399;">The correct meaning in this verse is</span> “aeons” <span style="color:#333399;">for the Arabic term</span> “ayam,”<span style="color:#333399;"> which shows that heavens where created in 6 aeons, 6 long periods of time. Science does not contradict this at all, due to the fact there Science says it COULD have been created in 6 aeons.</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"><span style="color:#333399;">Allah is above the throne as</span><br>
<strong>Surah Hadid 57:4</strong><br>
<span style="color:#333399;">says, and it also symbolic that he has authority and rose over the throne, the throne of authority, signifying that he is the One and only creator of everything. Allah is LITERALLY above the throne, which no-one can imagine or see and which is nothing like us.</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">A: Ishwar should be worshipped and He alone should be worshipped.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">It is true that by worship of Ishwar, you will not receive any shortcut pass certificate when you have actually failed.

</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color:black;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"><strong>Qur’an 67:2</strong> – <span style="color:#333399;">Allah has created death and life, that He may test you which of you is best in deed.</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color:black;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"><strong>Qur’an 2:155</strong> – <span style="color:#333399;">And certainly, We shall test you with something of fear, hunger, loss of wealth, lives and fruits, but give glad tidings to As-Sabirin (the patient ones, etc.).</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color:black;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"><strong>Qur’an 3:140</strong> –<span style="color:#333399;"> If a wound (and killing) has touched you, be sure a similar wound (and killing) has touched the others. And so are the days (good and not so good), We give to men by turns, that Allah may test those who believe, and that He may take martyrs from among you.</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color:black;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"><strong>Qur’an 5:48</strong> – <span style="color:#333399;">If Allah willed, He would have made you one nation, but that (He) may test you in what He has given you; so strive as in a race in good deeds. The return of you (all) is to Allah; then He will inform you about that in which you used to differ.</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color:black;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"><strong>Qur’an 18:7</strong> – <span style="color:#333399;">Verily! We have made that which is on earth as an adornment for it, in order that We may test them (mankind) as to which of them are best in deeds.</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color:black;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"><strong>Qur’an 29:2</strong> – <span style="color:#333399;">Do people think that they will be left alone because they say: “We believe,” and will not be tested.</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Even Agniveer knows that this life is a test for the Hereafter and according to our deeds we will be judged in the hereafter and will either be given a pass certificate or fail.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Agniveer tries hard to hide these truth which are quite apparent but still they show outwardly that they don’t believe it in order to deviate people from coming and knowing their inborn actual religion of submitting oneself to our creator.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>

<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Again a blatant misconception/misinformation showing the biasness of Agniveer. Nowhere does the Qur’an or any authentic Ahadith says that questioning the prophet is like insulting God and will make us eligible for Hell.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">On the Contrary Islam encourages questioning, questions related to faith, Qur’an etc.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Islam forbids useless questions which were asked to the prophet (pbuh) like <strong>`who is my father?’ `Where is my camel?</strong>‘<strong> etc.</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">People used to ask such useless questions to the Messenger of Allah to mock him<strong>.</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Allah said in<span style="color:black;"><br>
<strong>Chapter 5 verse 101</strong>,</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">O you who believe! Ask not about things which, if made plain to you, may cause you trouble. But if you ask about them while the Quran is being revealed, they will be made plain to you. Allah has forgiven that, and Allah is Oft Forgiving, Most Forbearing.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">This Ayah refers to good conduct that Allah is teaching His believing servants, by forbidding them from asking about useless things. Since if they get the answers they sought, they might be troublesome for them and difficult on their ears. Al-Bukhari recorded that Anas bin Malik said, “The Messenger of Allah gave a speech unlike anything I heard before. In this speech, he said,</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">«لَو تَعْلَمُونَ مَا أَعْلَمُ، لَضَحِكْتُمْ قَلِيلًا، وَلَبَكَيْتُمْ كَثِيرًا»</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">(If you but know what I know, you will laugh little and cry a lot.) The companions of Allah’s Messenger covered their faces and the sound of crying was coming out of their chests. A man asked, `Who is my father’ The Prophet said, `So-and-so’. This Ayah was later revealed,</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">﴿لاَ تَسْأَلُواْ عَنْ أَشْيَآءَ﴾</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">(Ask not about things…).” Muslim, Ahmad, At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasa’i recorded this Hadith.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Anas bin Malik narrated that once, the people were questioning the Messenger of Allah until they made him angry. So he ascended the Minbar and said,</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">«لَا تَسْأَلُونِي الْيَوْمَ عَنْ شَيْءٍ إِلَّا بَيَّنْتُهُ لَكُم»</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">(You will not ask me about anything today but I will explain it to you.) So the Companions of the Messenger of Allah feared that it was the commencement of a momentous event, and I looked to my right and left and found only people who covered their faces, crying. An argumentative man who was said to be the son of someone other than his true father asked, “O Allah’s Messenger! Who is my father The Prophet said, `Your father is Hudhafah.” `Umar stood up (when he saw anger on the Prophet’s face) and said, “We accept Allah as our Lord, Islam as our religion and Muhammad as our Messenger, I seek refuge with Allah from the evil of the Fitan (trials in life and religion).” The Messenger of Allah said,</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">«لَمْ أَرَ فِي الْخَيْرِ وَالشَّرِّ كَالْيَومِ قَطُّ، صُوِّرَتْ لِي الجَنَّةُ وَالنَّارُ حَتَّى رَأَيْتُهُمَا دُونَ الْحَائِط»</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">(I have never witnessed both goodness and evil like I have today. Paradise and the Fire were shown to me and I saw them before that wall.) This Hadith was recorded in the Two Sahihs from Sa`id. Al-Bukhari recorded that Ibn `Abbas said, “Some people used to question the Messenger of Allah to mock him. One of them would ask, `Who is my father,’ while another would ask, `Where is my camel,’ when he lost his camel. Allah sent down this Ayah about them.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">People used to question the Messenger of Allah to mock him, like `who is my father?’ `Where is my camel?’ etc.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"><strong>Such Useless questioning is prohibited in Islam. This verse of the Qur’an prohibits useless questions, and simultaneously encourages questioning about the verses of the Qur’an being revealed.</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>

<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">No big deal in that. It is quite logical. Yes this life is the only life. A person if he wants to improve, has to improve within this lifetime. If not, he will have to bear the punishment.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>

<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Now a days we find Hindu terrorists reigning supreme be it LTTE or any other group. I think this is because they think, that they have countless umber of lives and chances to improve. Let’s enjoy this life and we will improve in the next life. Let’s propagate false notions about various religions and degrade the inborn religion, Islam, hiding behind the bush, because we have many births to improve ourselves. We will not be questioned. We are not being tested.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>

</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">The concept of ‘this life being the only life’ and the result being ‘Hell or Heaven’ is more logical rather than the concept of the cycle of birth and rebirth as propounded by the Hindus.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>

<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">If a class 10th student is told by his father that if he is doesn’t pass in the first attempt then he will be compelled to discontinue his studies. Then, how he will study? He will put all his efforts to pass exam in his first attempt itself. On contrary, those who think they have many attempts will put less effort.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Hell is eternal for only disbelievers.

<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">If he violates certain regulations, then he commits a crime.

<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">If he violates all the basic regulations since the beginning and even after knowing his fault that he is going against the nation’s conduct, he violates the law just to serve his vain desires, then he is eligible for strict punishment only and can never enjoy the rights of the nation.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>

</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">As explained earlier, Islam is the true and pure religion, from our Only Creator. It has no divisions. Those who have divided the religion or derived any New religion out of it, is surely going against the Qur’an and is diverting from true guidance. A true Muslim is the One following the Qur’an and the authentic sayings and guidance of the Messengers. There are many who claim to follow these but their practices and beliefs clearly contradicts the Qur’an.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Allah says in the<span style="color:black;"><br>
<strong>Qur’an in Chapter 6 verse 159</strong>: <span style="color:#333399;">Verily, those who divide their religion and break up into sects (all kinds of religious sects), you (O Muhammad SAW) have no concern in them in the least. Their affair is only with Allah, Who then will tell them what they used to do.</span></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>

</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Surely those who deny the verses of the Qur’an, then whoever he might be, is not on true guidance.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>

</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Truly, the religion with Allah is (submitting your will to Allah) Islam. Those who were given the Scripture (Jews and Christians) did not differ except, out of mutual jealousy, after knowledge had come to them. And whoever disbelieves in the Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, signs, revelations, etc.) of Allah, then surely, Allah is Swift in calling to account.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>

</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">And if anyone of the Mushrikoon (polytheists, idolaters, pagans, disbelievers in the Oneness of Allah) seeks your protection then grant him protection, so that he may hear the Word of Allah (the Qur’an), and then escort him to where he can be secure, that is because they are men who know not.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">How much more tolerant can one be?</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Allah says in<span style="color:black;"><br>
<strong>The Qur’an Chapter 60 verse 8</strong>:</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Allah does not forbid you to deal justly and kindly with those who fought not against you on account of religion and did not drive you out of your homes. Verily, Allah loves those who deal with equity.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Imam Ahmad recorded that Asma’ bint Abu Bakr said, “My mother, who was an idolatress at the time, came to me during the Treaty of Peace, the Prophet conducted with the Quraysh. I came to the Prophet and said, `O Allah’s Messenger! My mother came visiting, desiring something from me, should I treat her with good relations’ The Prophet said,</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:right;"><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">«نَعَمْ صِلِي أُمَّك»</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">(Yes. Keep good relation with your mother.)” The Two Sahihs recorded this Hadith. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin Zubayr said, “Qutaylah came visiting her daughter, Asma’ bint Abi Bakr, with some gifts, such as Dibab, cheese and clarified (cooking) butter, and she was an idolatress at that time. Asma’ refused to accept her mother’s gifts and did not let her enter her house. `A’ishah asked the Prophet about his verdict and Allah sent down the Ayah,<span style="color:black;"><br>
<strong>60:8</strong><br>
<span style="color:#333399;">(Allah does not forbid you with those who fought not against you on account of religion) until the end of the Ayah. Allah’s Messenger ordered Asma’ to accept her mother’s gifts and to let her enter her house.”</span></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Islam is Alhamdolillah the Most tolerant of all religions, because it is the Only religion (the religion of submitting yourself to Almighty God) which our Creator chose for us.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>

</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Again the illiteracy of Agniveer is prominent when he claims that One has to blindly believe in all this to escape Hell and achieve Heaven.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Allah shows signs everywhere about the truth of Islam being the only religion of Our Creator. Among the six articles of faith there is not one which says that we have to believe in these miracles, even though these are true, to go to Heaven.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Moses (pbuh) did split the Red Sea with Allah’s permission.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span>
</li>
<li>
<span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Jesus (pbuh) was born miraculously without any male intervention, but by Allah’s permission.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span>
</li>
<li>
<span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Jesus (pbuh) was not crucified. He has been raised up alive and will come before the Day of Judgment.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span>
</li>
<li>
<span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Muhammad (pbuh) did split the moon.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span>
</li>
<li>
<span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Muhammad (pbuh) did go for Miraj, but not on a girl-faced donkey and neither through Miraj travels (which Agniveer falsely says without any proof. Agniveer’s lies are quite evident)</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span>
</li>
<li>
<span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Not only Muhammad (pbuh), every prophet of Allah received revelations.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">All these were Signs, rather than miracles. In the description of these events, The Qur’an does not use the technical Arabic word for miracle<span style="color:black;"><br>
<strong>المعجزات</strong> (Muadjiza)<span style="color:#333399;"> literally meaning “that by means of which [the Prophet] confounds, overwhelms, his opponents”. It rather uses the term ‘Ayah’ (literally meaning sign).</span></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Though these are Signs performed with Allah’s permission, It is not an article of faith to believe in them to attain Paradise.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">But a believer believes that Allah can show us any signs if He wills.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">The Qur’an itself is a miracle. Moreover, there are numerous scientific miracles also mentioned in the Qur’an.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>

</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Islam is never silent on any issues if it is an important matter or a matter of concern, because it is the only universal religion not bounded to any specific types of people, region etc.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">One verse from the Word of Our Creator, the<span style="color:black;"><br>
<strong>Qur’an Chapter 6 verse 38</strong><br>
<span style="color:#333399;">answers your queries and reminds that Allah never neglects anything:</span></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">There is not a moving (living) creature on earth, nor a bird that flies with its two wings, but are communities like you. We have neglected nothing in the Book, then unto their Lord they (all) shall be gathered.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Allah’s statement,</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">﴿مَّا فَرَّطْنَا فِى الكِتَـبِ مِن شَىْءٍ﴾</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">(We have neglected nothing in the Book,) means, the knowledge about all things is with Allah, and He never forgets any of His creatures, nor their sustenance, nor their affairs, whether these creatures live in the sea or on land. In another Ayah, Allah said;</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">﴿وَمَا مِن دَآبَّةٍ فِي الاٌّرْضِ إِلاَّ عَلَى اللَّهِ رِزْقُهَا وَيَعْلَمُ مُسْتَقَرَّهَا وَمُسْتَوْدَعَهَا كُلٌّ فِى كِتَابٍ مُّبِينٍ ﴾</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">(And no moving creature is there on earth but its provision is due from Allah. And He knows its dwelling place and its deposit (in the uterus, grave, etc.). All is in a Clear Book.) ﴿<span style="color:black;"><strong>11:6</strong><span style="color:#333399;">﴾, there is a record of their names, numbers, movements, and lack of movement.</span></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">﴾Ibn Abi Hatim reported that Ibn `Abbas said about the<span style="color:black;"><br>
<strong>Qur’an Chapter 6 ayah 38</strong>,</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">﴿ثُمَّ إِلَى رَبِّهِمْ يُحْشَرُونَ﴾</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">(then unto their Lord they (all) shall be gathered.) “Death gathers them.” It was also said that the Day of Resurrection gathers them, for in another Ayah, Allah said;</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">﴿وَإِذَا الْوُحُوشُ حُشِرَتْ ﴾</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">(And when the wild beasts shall be gathered together.) ﴿<span style="color:black;"><strong>81:5</strong><span style="color:#333399;">﴾ `Abdur-Razzaq recorded that Abu Hurayrah said about Allah’s statement,</span></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">﴿إِلاَّ أُمَمٌ أَمْثَـلُكُمْ مَّا فَرَّطْنَا فِى الكِتَـبِ مِن شَىْءٍ ثُمَّ إِلَى رَبِّهِمْ يُحْشَرُونَ﴾</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">(but are Umam like you. We have neglected nothing in the Book, then unto their Lord they (all) shall be gathered.) “All creatures will be gathered on the Day of Resurrection, the beasts, birds and all others.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">The Qur’an applies the word “<span style="color:black;"><strong>Muslim</strong><span style="color:#333399;">” not only to humans but also to animals and the inanimate world. “The divine will manifests itself in the form of laws both in human society and in the world of nature.” In Islamic terminology, for example, a bee is a Muslim precisely because it lives and dies obeying the sharia that God has prescribed for the community of bees, just as a person is a Muslim by virtue of the fact that he or she submits to the revealed sharia ordained for humans in the Qur’an and Sunnah.</span></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">This fact is very much clear by the verse of the <span style="color:black;"><strong>Qur’an Chapter 22 verse 18</strong><br>
<span style="color:#333399;">where Allah says,</span></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">See you not that to Allah prostrates whoever is in the heavens and whoever is on the earth, and the sun, and the moon, and the stars, and the mountains, and the trees, and Ad-Dawab (moving living creatures, beasts, etc.), and many of mankind? But there are many (men) on whom the punishment is justified. And whomsoever Allah disgraces, none can honour him. Verily! Allah does what He wills.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Animals and other living things were created by Allah, the Lord of the Universe. They have their own independent existences and modes of living.  <span style="color:black;">(<strong>55:10</strong>)</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Allah says in<strong><br>
<span style="color:black;">The Qur’an in 3:185, 21:35 and 29:57</span></strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">“Every soul shall have a taste of death in the end to us shall you be brought back.”</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">It is quite clear from the above verse that anything which has a soul will die. We know that plants die, we know that animals die, so they all have souls. And all of them will be returned to Allah and assembled together on the day of Judgment.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Many passages from the Qur’an and Ahadith state that all animals are endowed with spirit and mind and “…there is ample evidence in the Qur’an to suggest that animals’ consciousness of spirit and mind is of a degree higher than mere instinct and intuition. We are told in the Qur’an that animals have a cognizance of their Creator and, hence, they pay their obeisance to Him by adoration and worship: Seest thou not that it is Allah Whose praises are celebrated by all beings in the heavens and on earth, and by the birds with extended wings? Each one knows its prayer and psalm, And Allah is aware of what they do.<span style="color:black;"> (<strong>Qur’an 24:41</strong>).</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">It is worth noting the statement that ‘each one knows its prayer and psalm’. The execution of a voluntary act, performed consciously and intentionally, requires a faculty higher than that of instinct and intuition. Lest some people should doubt that animals could have such a faculty, the following verse points out that it is human ignorance that prevents them from understanding this phenomenon: The seven heavens and the earth and all things therein declare His glory. There is not a thing but celebrates His adoration; and yet ye mankind! ye understand not how do they declare His glory…<span style="color:black;">(<strong>Qur’an 17:44</strong>).</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>

<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">But as is obvious, Agniveer’s mission in this birth life and all his supposed cycles, is to hinder people from the Truth.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>

Zeeshan Akhtar assisted by Brother Neer\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nThe artice is divided into 3 sections:\n\n\n(Part 1) Demystifying Religion in True sense\n\n\n(Part 2) Refuting the false and wrong informations given by Agniveer about Islam in his article.\n\n\n(Part 3) Response to points raised about Eastern religion and Miscellaneous Religions\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPART 2:\n\nRefuting the false and wrong informations given by Agniveer about Islam in his article.\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAgniveer states:\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe purpose of this article is to present an unbiased layman view of religions as of today. Majority of us fail to understand the apparent confusion of so many religions, all seemingly claiming to be best. Religion has become the prime pretext for all the violence, terrorism, fights and havoc all around the world. Religion seems to be the primary theme governing the world politics and society, yet most of us do not know what exactly it is all about. Most of us simply know the names of major religions – Hinduism, Islam, Christianity, Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism, Bahai etc and keep hearing how basically all teach the same good things and how all religions are equal. We also keep hearing lot of irrational stuff from all religions and hence tend to believe somewhere deep inside that it should not be taken so seriously.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResponse:\n\n\nHow much biased Agniveer is, is quite apparent if one goes completely through his articles.\n\n\nThis portion of Agniveer is very well answered in the First Part of this article :http:\/\/www.systemoflife.com\/answering-islamophobes\/agniveer\/224-religion-demystified-part-1-demystifying-religion-in-true-sense and Insha'allah all the hypothesis written here by Agniveer will be answered.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAgniveer writes about Islam:\n\nReligions of Visionaries\n\nThe other extreme is the cult of the 'visionaries' who see bit too much for normal people like you and me to appreciate and cross-verify even a small sample set of their 'visions'.\n\nThis is the foundation of all Arabic religions like Judaism, Christianity or Islam. They are claimed to be founded by their respective Prophet(s) who saw things we could not see and told people what they should do to enjoy life after death and save themselves from troubles after death. Arab is a desert area that is known for mirage and hence it becomes confusing at times to ascertain if the prophets of these Arabic religions were having visions or mirage.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResponse:\n\n\nAgniveer again shows his biasness and ignorance by claiming that Islam has been founded by a Prophet who saw things we could not see.\n\n\nThe religion of Islam is the Religion which our God chose for us. No prophet founded it. It existed since time immemorial as is apparent from the First Part of this article: http:\/\/www.systemoflife.com\/answering-islamophobes\/agniveer\/224-religion-demystified-part-1-demystifying-religion-in-true-sense\n\n\nAlso go through\nhttp:\/\/www.systemoflife.com\/answering-islamophobes\/agniveer\n\n\nWell as regards to Prophets having mirage, then Agniveer should be well aware that 'mirage is caused due to Reflection produced by bending of light rays coming from an already present object'. A mirage is a naturally occurring optical phenomenon in which light rays are bent to produce a displaced image of distant objects or the sky. \n\n\nMirage is different from illusions. Things seen in Mirage do really exist, though not at that place but somewhere near that place, the reflection of which is seen as mirage. If that thing does not exist, then it's mirage is not possible. Mirages are not illusions.\n\n\nSo Agniveer wanted to prove by referring to Prophets having mirage that the Prophets description about miracles, Hell, heaven etc were 'mirage' which Agniveer thought were illusions and not true.  But unfortunately, even if it was mirage (which is not the true case) then also the revelations and phenomenon and miracles were true, because mirage occurs only if that thing is present in reality.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAgniveer disagrees with:\n\nFollowing are the salient beliefs of these religions:\n\na. There is one God\/Allah\/Jehovah who created this world in 6\/7\/8 etc days and himself sits on some throne on 4th sky\/ 7th sky\/ Heaven etc.\n\nb. We all are created by this God\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResponse:\n\n\nYes there is only One God who is our creator and the only one worthy to be thanked and worshipped. (See the Qur'an Chapter 112 verse 1-4)\n\n\nThe Qur'an mentions in several places that Allah created the heavens and the earth in six \"ayam\" (aeons) and then Istawa (rose over) the Throne (in a manner that suits His Majesty). One such verse is:\n\n\nThe Qur'an Surah Hadid Chapter 57 verse 4:\n\n\nHe it is Who created the heavens and the earth in six \"ayam\" (aeons) and then Istawa (rose over) the Throne (in a manner that suits His Majesty). He knows what goes into the earth and what comes forth from it, what descends from the heaven and what ascends thereto. And He is with you (by His Knowledge) wheresoever you may be. And Allah is the All-Seer of what you do.\n\n\nThe correct meaning in this verse is \"aeons\" for the Arabic term \"ayam,\" which shows that heavens where created in 6 aeons, 6 long periods of time. Science does not contradict this at all, due to the fact there Science says it COULD have been created in 6 aeons.\n\n\nAllah is above the throne as\nSurah Hadid 57:4\nsays, and it also symbolic that he has authority and rose over the throne, the throne of authority, signifying that he is the One and only creator of everything. Allah is LITERALLY above the throne, which no-one can imagine or see and which is nothing like us.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAgniveer disagrees with Islamic concept that:\n\nc. We all are being tested by the God.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResponse:\n\n\nKindly Note:\nIn the Article 'Understanding Vedic God' , Agniveer writes under the heading \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQ: Should we worship Ishwar or not? Why? After all He never forgives!\n\nA: Ishwar should be worshipped and He alone should be worshipped.\n\nIt is true that by worship of Ishwar, you will not receive any shortcut pass certificate when you have actually failed. Only lazy and cheaters desire such unscrupulous means to success.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJust see and read the phrase \"will not receive any shortcut pass certificate when you have actually failed.\" Just ask yourself, will you get a pass certificate or will you fail without undergoing or giving any Test?\n\n\n\n \tQur'an 67:2 - Allah has created death and life, that He may test you which of you is best in deed.\n\n \tQur'an 2:155 - And certainly, We shall test you with something of fear, hunger, loss of wealth, lives and fruits, but give glad tidings to As-Sabirin (the patient ones, etc.).\n\n \tQur'an 3:140 - If a wound (and killing) has touched you, be sure a similar wound (and killing) has touched the others. And so are the days (good and not so good), We give to men by turns, that Allah may test those who believe, and that He may take martyrs from among you.\n\n \tQur'an 5:48 - If Allah willed, He would have made you one nation, but that (He) may test you in what He has given you; so strive as in a race in good deeds. The return of you (all) is to Allah; then He will inform you about that in which you used to differ.\n\n \tQur'an 18:7 - Verily! We have made that which is on earth as an adornment for it, in order that We may test them (mankind) as to which of them are best in deeds.\n\n \tQur'an 29:2 - Do people think that they will be left alone because they say: \"We believe,\" and will not be tested.\n\n\nEven Agniveer knows that this life is a test for the Hereafter and according to our deeds we will be judged in the hereafter and will either be given a pass certificate or fail.\n\n\nAgniveer tries hard to hide these truth which are quite apparent but still they show outwardly that they don't believe it in order to deviate people from coming and knowing their inborn actual religion of submitting oneself to our creator.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAgniveer claims:\n\nd. God sends his Prophet(s) to guide the less privileged people. Only by following the most latest prophet can one go to Heaven, else he or she shall go to Hell which is place for torture. Review God must be crazy! to analyze this.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResponse:\n\n\nGod sent Prophets to every nation, not only to guide and warn the less privileged people but also the privileged ones.\n\n\nBy saying 'Only by following the most latest prophet can one go to Heaven' Agniveer wanted to say that the diffenet prophets preached different things.\n\n\nThis has been already answered in the First Part of this article under the heading: Did different Prophets\/Messengers preach different things?\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAgniveer claims:\n\ne. There is no way one can question these prophets. Questioning them is like insulting God and hence dispatches us to Hell.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResponse:\n\n\nAgain a blatant misconception\/misinformation showing the biasness of Agniveer. Nowhere does the Qur'an or any authentic Ahadith says that questioning the prophet is like insulting God and will make us eligible for Hell.\n\n\nOn the Contrary Islam encourages questioning, questions related to faith, Qur'an etc.\n\n\nIslam forbids useless questions which were asked to the prophet (pbuh) like `who is my father?' `Where is my camel?' etc.\n\n\nPeople used to ask such useless questions to the Messenger of Allah to mock him.\n\n\nAllah said in\nChapter 5 verse 101,\n\n\nO you who believe! Ask not about things which, if made plain to you, may cause you trouble. But if you ask about them while the Quran is being revealed, they will be made plain to you. Allah has forgiven that, and Allah is Oft Forgiving, Most Forbearing.\n\n\nThis Ayah refers to good conduct that Allah is teaching His believing servants, by forbidding them from asking about useless things. Since if they get the answers they sought, they might be troublesome for them and difficult on their ears. Al-Bukhari recorded that Anas bin Malik said, \"The Messenger of Allah gave a speech unlike anything I heard before. In this speech, he said,\n\n\n«لَو تَعْلَمُونَ مَا أَعْلَمُ، لَضَحِكْتُمْ قَلِيلًا، وَلَبَكَيْتُمْ كَثِيرًا»\n\n\n(If you but know what I know, you will laugh little and cry a lot.) The companions of Allah's Messenger covered their faces and the sound of crying was coming out of their chests. A man asked, `Who is my father' The Prophet said, `So-and-so'. This Ayah was later revealed,\n\n\n﴿لاَ تَسْأَلُواْ عَنْ أَشْيَآءَ﴾\n\n\n(Ask not about things...).'' Muslim, Ahmad, At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasa'i recorded this Hadith.\n\n\nAnas bin Malik narrated that once, the people were questioning the Messenger of Allah until they made him angry. So he ascended the Minbar and said,\n\n\n«لَا تَسْأَلُونِي الْيَوْمَ عَنْ شَيْءٍ إِلَّا بَيَّنْتُهُ لَكُم»\n\n\n(You will not ask me about anything today but I will explain it to you.) So the Companions of the Messenger of Allah feared that it was the commencement of a momentous event, and I looked to my right and left and found only people who covered their faces, crying. An argumentative man who was said to be the son of someone other than his true father asked, \"O Allah's Messenger! Who is my father The Prophet said, `Your father is Hudhafah.'' `Umar stood up (when he saw anger on the Prophet's face) and said, \"We accept Allah as our Lord, Islam as our religion and Muhammad as our Messenger, I seek refuge with Allah from the evil of the Fitan (trials in life and religion).'' The Messenger of Allah said,\n\n\n«لَمْ أَرَ فِي الْخَيْرِ وَالشَّرِّ كَالْيَومِ قَطُّ، صُوِّرَتْ لِي الجَنَّةُ وَالنَّارُ حَتَّى رَأَيْتُهُمَا دُونَ الْحَائِط»\n\n\n(I have never witnessed both goodness and evil like I have today. Paradise and the Fire were shown to me and I saw them before that wall.) This Hadith was recorded in the Two Sahihs from Sa`id. Al-Bukhari recorded that Ibn `Abbas said, \"Some people used to question the Messenger of Allah to mock him. One of them would ask, `Who is my father,' while another would ask, `Where is my camel,' when he lost his camel. Allah sent down this Ayah about them.\n\n\nPeople used to question the Messenger of Allah to mock him, like `who is my father?' `Where is my camel?' etc.\n\n\nSuch Useless questioning is prohibited in Islam. This verse of the Qur'an prohibits useless questions, and simultaneously encourages questioning about the verses of the Qur'an being revealed.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAgniveer claims:\n\nf. Heaven and Hell are eternal. This life is the only life. \n\ni. These cults believe that one day world will come to an end when people would be taken out from their graves and brought to a court where God will be judge and their respective prophet would be the lawyer. He shall take variety of evidences and then decide who shall go to Hell and who shall go to Heaven. And then Heaven or Hell will be eternal.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNo big deal in that. It is quite logical. Yes this life is the only life. A person if he wants to improve, has to improve within this lifetime. If not, he will have to bear the punishment.\n\n\nNow a days we find Hindu terrorists reigning supreme be it LTTE or any other group. I think this is because they think, that they have countless umber of lives and chances to improve. Let's enjoy this life and we will improve in the next life. Let's propagate false notions about various religions and degrade the inborn religion, Islam, hiding behind the bush, because we have many births to improve ourselves. We will not be questioned. We are not being tested.\n\n\nI think that this is the reason Priests like Swami Nityananda and many much more swamis have started their business of Sex-trading.\n\n\nIt's really pathetic!\n\n\nThe concept of 'this life being the only life' and the result being 'Hell or Heaven' is more logical rather than the concept of the cycle of birth and rebirth as propounded by the Hindus.\n\n\nIf a class 10th student is told by his father that if he is doesn't pass in the first attempt then he will be compelled to discontinue his studies. Then, how he will study? He will put all his efforts to pass exam in his first attempt itself. On contrary, those who think they have many attempts will put less effort.\n\n\nHell is eternal for only disbelievers. Any believer, after being punished for his sins in the Hell, will eventually at some point of time, be made dwellers of Heaven.\n\n\nEvery nation lays down certain rules and regulations for it's citizens to follow. If one follows the basic regulations, then he is eligible to enjoy all the rights of the nation.\n\n\nIf he violates certain regulations, then he commits a crime. He has to go through the penalty for sometime and after that he is free to enjoy the rights of that nation.\n\n\nIf he violates all the basic regulations since the beginning and even after knowing his fault that he is going against the nation's conduct, he violates the law just to serve his vain desires, then he is eligible for strict punishment only and can never enjoy the rights of the nation.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAgniveer claims:\n\ng. Judaism considers Moses as the final Prophet, Christians consider Jesus and Muslims consider Muhammad as final one. Each of them brought his own final edition of God's message. The fight among them is related to this controversy. Further, each of them is divided into huge number of sects which have there own different versions\/ interpretations of the final book. \n\nh. Muhammad being most pragmatic put an end to this Prophet business by claiming to be the Final Prophet till the world comes to an end. But some sects of Islam, claim to have new Prophets who only add upon existing message of Muhammad. The most prominent of these cults is Qadiyanis who consider Mirza Ghulam Ahmed to be final prophet. That is why other cults call Qadiyanis as Kafirs (non-Muslims) and hate them.\n\n(Ironically, Zakir Naik has copied all his work from Qadiyani literature word by word, letter by letter, and promotes their Qadiyani specific views to claim popularity as expert of comparative religions. That is why this creates suspicion that he is actually a Qadiyani in disguise. Refer Dr Zakir Naik's fraud exposed on this site.)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResponse:\n\n\nThere are several Ayat testifying to the fact that Allah alone is the One Who guides and misguides, and similarly several authentic Ahadith and verse in the Qur'an (Surah Ahzab Chapter 33 verse 40) that Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) is the last of all messengers and apostle, contrary to the belief of the Qadiyani sect. They rely on their unclear understanding of an Ayat, thus avoiding what is clear and contradicts their desires. Theirs is the method of the people who follow their lust, desire and wickedness. An authentic Hadith narrated,\n\n\n«إِذَا رَأَيْتُمُ الَّذِينَ يَتَّبِعُونَ مَا تَشَابَهَ مِنْهُ فَأُولئِكَ الَّذِينَ سَمَّى اللهُ فَاحْذَرُوهُمْ»\n\n\n(When you see those who follow what is not so clear in it (the Qur'an), then they are those whom Allah has mentioned (refer to 3:7). Hence, avoid them.)\n\n\nThe Prophet was referring to Allah's statement,\n\n\n﴿فَأَمَّا الَّذِينَ فى قُلُوبِهِمْ زَيْغٌ فَيَتَّبِعُونَ مَا تَشَـبَهَ مِنْهُ ابْتِغَآءَ الْفِتْنَةِ وَابْتِغَآءَ تَأْوِيلِهِ﴾\n\n\n(So as for those in whose hearts there is a deviation (from the truth) they follow that which is not entirely clear thereof, seeking Al-Fitnah (polytheism and trials), and seeking for its hidden meanings)(3:7).\n\n\nVerily, no innovator in the religion could ever rely on any authentic evidence in the Qur'an that testifies to his innovation. The Qur'an came to distinguish between truth and falsehood, and guidance and misguidance. The Qur'an does not contain any discrepancies or contradictions, because it is a revelation from the Most Wise, Worthy of all praise.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAgniveer claims: \n\nj. The entire fight in West today is on following:\n\n- Which of the cults of Islam is the true cult of God? Shia, Sunni, Qadiyani etc.\n\n- Which is true religion? Judaism, Christianity or Islam? \n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResponse:\n\n\nAs explained earlier, Islam is the true and pure religion, from our Only Creator. It has no divisions. Those who have divided the religion or derived any New religion out of it, is surely going against the Qur'an and is diverting from true guidance. A true Muslim is the One following the Qur'an and the authentic sayings and guidance of the Messengers. There are many who claim to follow these but their practices and beliefs clearly contradicts the Qur'an.\n\n\nAllah says in the\nQur'an in Chapter 6 verse 159: Verily, those who divide their religion and break up into sects (all kinds of religious sects), you (O Muhammad SAW) have no concern in them in the least. Their affair is only with Allah, Who then will tell them what they used to do.\n\n\nQur'an 3: 103 - And hold fast, all of you together, to the Rope of Allah (i.e. this Quran), and be not divided among yourselves,\n\n\nSurely those who deny the verses of the Qur'an, then whoever he might be, is not on true guidance.\n\n\nAllah says in\nThe Qur'an in\nChapter 3 verse 73\n\n\n﴿قُلْ إِنَّ الْهُدَى هُدَى اللَّهِ﴾\n\n\n(Say: (O Prophet) \"Verily, right guidance is the guidance of Allah.'')\n\n\n \tQur'an Chapter 3 verse 101: …And whoever holds firmly to Allah, (i.e. follows Islam Allahs Religion, and obeys all that Allah has ordered, practically), then he is indeed guided to a Right Path.\n\n \tQur'an Chapter 3 verse 103:  And hold fast, all of you together, to the Rope of Allah (i.e. this Quran), and be not divided among yourselves, and remember Allah's Favour on you,…\n\n \tQur'an Chapter 3 verse 105: And be not as those who divided and differed among themselves after the clear proofs had come to them. It is they for whom there is an awful torment.\n\n\nIt is hard to see that among the options given for one in the West to select the True Religion, Agniveer didn't mention Hinduism. I guess, he agrees that Hinduism is actually teachings of men, not of the Almighty God and the Western people knows this fact that they cannot be fooled with illogical Hinduism.\n\n\nAllah says in\nThe Qur'an\nChapter 3 verse 19\n\n\nTruly, the religion with Allah is (submitting your will to Allah) Islam. Those who were given the Scripture (Jews and Christians) did not differ except, out of mutual jealousy, after knowledge had come to them. And whoever disbelieves in the Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, signs, revelations, etc.) of Allah, then surely, Allah is Swift in calling to account.\n\n\n \tQur'an 12:40 - \"….Allah has commanded that you worship none but Him (i.e. His Monotheism), that is the (true) straight religion, but most men know not.\n\n \tQur'an 30:30 - So set you (O Muhammad SAW) your face towards the religion of pure Islamic Monotheism Hanifa (worship none but Allah Alone) Allahs Fitrah (i.e. Allahs Islamic Monotheism), with which He has created mankind. No change let there be in Khalqillah (i.e. the Religion of Allah Islamic Monotheism), that is the straight religion, but most of men know not. (Tafsir AtTabaree, Vol 21, Page 41)\n\n \tQur'an 98:5 - And they were commanded not, but that they should worship Allah, and worship none but Him\nAlone (abstaining from ascribing partners to Him), and perform As-Salat (Iqamat-as-Salat) and give\nZakat: and that is the right religion.\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAgniveer claims:\n\nk. Jews (follower of Judaism) do not fight much because they consider themselves to be privileged ones having message of God. They thus do not get into competition of expanding their population base. There fight is restricted to unfriendly neighbors 9Arab countries) whose religious books term Jews as worst of the lot. But for Islam and Christianity, one of the most important performance metric set by God to qualify for Heaven is the number of people they can bring into their respective folds.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResponse:\n\n\nThis clearly exposes the Biasness of Agniveer and it's hatred towards Islam. But, he needs to learn again the A,B,C,D 's ….. of Islam, then open up his biased mouth to comment.\n\n\nWe Muslims, are commanded to inform others of the Truth of Islam, their inborn religion. We have no authority to convert them or guide them, but only to convey the message. Even Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) and all the previous Messengers (peace be upon them all) had no authority to convert any one.\n\n\nThe messenger's duty is only to convey the message and this is mentioned in several places in the Qur'an. I am only giving examples of few,\n\n\n \t(your duty is only to convey and on Us is the reckoning)\nQur'an 13:40\n\n \tThe Messenger's duty is only to convey in a clear way) \nQur'an 24:54\n\n \t(So remind them -- you are only one who reminds. You are not a dictator over them.)\nQur'an 88:21-22\n\n\nAllah said in\nChapter 2 verse 256,\n\n\n﴿لاَ إِكْرَاهَ فِى الدِّينِ﴾\n\n\n(There is no compulsion in religion), meaning, \"Do not force anyone to become Muslim, for Islam is plain and clear, and its proofs and evidence are plain and clear. Therefore, there is no need to force anyone to embrace Islam. Rather, whoever Allah directs to Islam, opens his heart for it and enlightens his mind, will embrace Islam with certainty. Whoever Allah blinds his heart and seals his hearing and sight, then he will not benefit from being forced to embrace Islam.''\n\n\nIf we convey the message and the seeker of Truth realizes that Islam is the ultimate truth, then this is not called converting. It is called serving mankind by telling them the truth and every service done to any animate thing is a performance metric for us Muslims and we get rewarded for that with good deeds.\n\n\nProphet Muhammad (pbuh) had said: \"There is a reward for serving any animate (living being)\" [Bukhari :: Volume 8 :: Book 73 :: Hadith 38]\n\n\n \n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAgniveer claims:\n\nl. Each of these religions claims to be religion of peace. However the only rider is that this peace is for believers only. Non-believers are not tolerated in them. The level of tolerance has reduced chronologically. Thus Jews keep to themselves, but Christians allow use of sword and deceit to convert people. Islam goes a step further ahead by claiming that those who fight in path of promoting Allah and die become the recipient of best facilities in Heaven.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResponse:\n\n\nIslam is the most tolerant of all religion which orders a believer to respect, love, and care for the unbelievers, those who have done nothing like attacking or cheating the Muslim Ummah.\n\n\nOnly at times of war, when the disbelievers have cheated, then only Muslims are commanded to fight the disbelievers, but if they demand peace, reconciliation, then Muslims are ordered to be tolerant to them even at times of war.\n\n\nAllah forbids unnecessary attacking or hurting the disbelievers. Moreover, even if the unbelievers attack you, and during the course of war, demand your protection, then Muslims are commanded to give them protection and to take them to a secure place.\n\n\nAllah says in The Qur'an Chapter 9 verse 5:\n\n\nAnd if anyone of the Mushrikoon (polytheists, idolaters, pagans, disbelievers in the Oneness of Allah) seeks your protection then grant him protection, so that he may hear the Word of Allah (the Qur'an), and then escort him to where he can be secure, that is because they are men who know not.\n\n\nHow much more tolerant can one be?\n\n\nAllah says in\nThe Qur'an Chapter 60 verse 8:\n\n\nAllah does not forbid you to deal justly and kindly with those who fought not against you on account of religion and did not drive you out of your homes. Verily, Allah loves those who deal with equity.\n\n\nImam Ahmad recorded that Asma' bint Abu Bakr said, \"My mother, who was an idolatress at the time, came to me during the Treaty of Peace, the Prophet conducted with the Quraysh. I came to the Prophet and said, `O Allah's Messenger! My mother came visiting, desiring something from me, should I treat her with good relations' The Prophet said,\n\n«نَعَمْ صِلِي أُمَّك»\n\n(Yes. Keep good relation with your mother.)'' The Two Sahihs recorded this Hadith. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin Zubayr said, \"Qutaylah came visiting her daughter, Asma' bint Abi Bakr, with some gifts, such as Dibab, cheese and clarified (cooking) butter, and she was an idolatress at that time. Asma' refused to accept her mother's gifts and did not let her enter her house. `A'ishah asked the Prophet about his verdict and Allah sent down the Ayah,\n60:8\n(Allah does not forbid you with those who fought not against you on account of religion) until the end of the Ayah. Allah's Messenger ordered Asma' to accept her mother's gifts and to let her enter her house.''\n\n\nIslam is Alhamdolillah the Most tolerant of all religions, because it is the Only religion (the religion of submitting yourself to Almighty God) which our Creator chose for us.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAgniveer claims:\n\nn. Existence of miracles is supposed to be greatest proofs of validity of these religions. It is a different matter that the evidence, description and testimony of these miracles are restricted to their respective books only. Some of the miracles are Moses splitting the Red Sea, Jesus reviving back to life after crucification, Virgin Mary giving birth to Jesus, Muhammad splitting the moon, Muhammad traveling to 7th sky on a girl-faced donkey (Buraq) through Miraj Travels in a night, Muhammad having revelations coming from an angel called Gabriel etc.\n\nOne has to blindly believe in all this to escape Hell and achieve Heaven.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResponse:\n\n\nAgain the illiteracy of Agniveer is prominent when he claims that One has to blindly believe in all this to escape Hell and achieve Heaven.\n\n\nAllah shows signs everywhere about the truth of Islam being the only religion of Our Creator. Among the six articles of faith there is not one which says that we have to believe in these miracles, even though these are true, to go to Heaven.\n\n\n \n\n \tMoses (pbuh) did split the Red Sea with Allah's permission.\n\n \tJesus (pbuh) was born miraculously without any male intervention, but by Allah's permission.\n\n \tJesus (pbuh) was not crucified. He has been raised up alive and will come before the Day of Judgment.\n\n \tMuhammad (pbuh) did split the moon.\n\n \tMuhammad (pbuh) did go for Miraj, but not on a girl-faced donkey and neither through Miraj travels (which Agniveer falsely says without any proof. Agniveer's lies are quite evident)\n\n \tNot only Muhammad (pbuh), every prophet of Allah received revelations.\n\n\n \n\nAll these were Signs, rather than miracles. In the description of these events, The Qur'an does not use the technical Arabic word for miracle\nالمعجزات (Muadjiza) literally meaning \"that by means of which [the Prophet] confounds, overwhelms, his opponents\". It rather uses the term 'Ayah' (literally meaning sign).\n\n\nThough these are Signs performed with Allah's permission, It is not an article of faith to believe in them to attain Paradise.\n\n\nBut a believer believes that Allah can show us any signs if He wills.\n\n\nThe Qur'an itself is a miracle. Moreover, there are numerous scientific miracles also mentioned in the Qur'an.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAgniveer claims:\n\no. These religions are silent on status of animals and insects – whether they have soul, will they go to Heaven\/hell, in what form etc.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Response:\n\n\nIslam is never silent on any issues if it is an important matter or a matter of concern, because it is the only universal religion not bounded to any specific types of people, region etc.\n\n\nOne verse from the Word of Our Creator, the\nQur'an Chapter 6 verse 38\nanswers your queries and reminds that Allah never neglects anything:\n\n\nThere is not a moving (living) creature on earth, nor a bird that flies with its two wings, but are communities like you. We have neglected nothing in the Book, then unto their Lord they (all) shall be gathered.\n\n\nAllah's statement,\n\n\n﴿مَّا فَرَّطْنَا فِى الكِتَـبِ مِن شَىْءٍ﴾\n\n\n(We have neglected nothing in the Book,) means, the knowledge about all things is with Allah, and He never forgets any of His creatures, nor their sustenance, nor their affairs, whether these creatures live in the sea or on land. In another Ayah, Allah said;\n\n\n﴿وَمَا مِن دَآبَّةٍ فِي الاٌّرْضِ إِلاَّ عَلَى اللَّهِ رِزْقُهَا وَيَعْلَمُ مُسْتَقَرَّهَا وَمُسْتَوْدَعَهَا كُلٌّ فِى كِتَابٍ مُّبِينٍ ﴾\n\n\n(And no moving creature is there on earth but its provision is due from Allah. And He knows its dwelling place and its deposit (in the uterus, grave, etc.). All is in a Clear Book.) ﴿11:6﴾, there is a record of their names, numbers, movements, and lack of movement.\n\n\n﴾Ibn Abi Hatim reported that Ibn `Abbas said about the\nQur'an Chapter 6 ayah 38,\n\n\n﴿ثُمَّ إِلَى رَبِّهِمْ يُحْشَرُونَ﴾\n\n\n(then unto their Lord they (all) shall be gathered.) \"Death gathers them.'' It was also said that the Day of Resurrection gathers them, for in another Ayah, Allah said;\n\n\n﴿وَإِذَا الْوُحُوشُ حُشِرَتْ ﴾\n\n\n(And when the wild beasts shall be gathered together.) ﴿81:5﴾ `Abdur-Razzaq recorded that Abu Hurayrah said about Allah's statement,\n\n\n﴿إِلاَّ أُمَمٌ أَمْثَـلُكُمْ مَّا فَرَّطْنَا فِى الكِتَـبِ مِن شَىْءٍ ثُمَّ إِلَى رَبِّهِمْ يُحْشَرُونَ﴾\n\n\n(but are Umam like you. We have neglected nothing in the Book, then unto their Lord they (all) shall be gathered.) \"All creatures will be gathered on the Day of Resurrection, the beasts, birds and all others.\n\n\nThe Qur'an applies the word \"Muslim\" not only to humans but also to animals and the inanimate world. \"The divine will manifests itself in the form of laws both in human society and in the world of nature.\" In Islamic terminology, for example, a bee is a Muslim precisely because it lives and dies obeying the sharia that God has prescribed for the community of bees, just as a person is a Muslim by virtue of the fact that he or she submits to the revealed sharia ordained for humans in the Qur'an and Sunnah.\n\n\nThis fact is very much clear by the verse of the Qur'an Chapter 22 verse 18\nwhere Allah says,\n\n\nSee you not that to Allah prostrates whoever is in the heavens and whoever is on the earth, and the sun, and the moon, and the stars, and the mountains, and the trees, and Ad-Dawab (moving living creatures, beasts, etc.), and many of mankind? But there are many (men) on whom the punishment is justified. And whomsoever Allah disgraces, none can honour him. Verily! Allah does what He wills.\n\n\nAnimals and other living things were created by Allah, the Lord of the Universe. They have their own independent existences and modes of living.  (55:10)\n\n\nAllah says in\nThe Qur'an in 3:185, 21:35 and 29:57\n\n\n\"Every soul shall have a taste of death in the end to us shall you be brought back.\"\n\n\nIt is quite clear from the above verse that anything which has a soul will die. We know that plants die, we know that animals die, so they all have souls. And all of them will be returned to Allah and assembled together on the day of Judgment.\n\n\nMany passages from the Qur'an and Ahadith state that all animals are endowed with spirit and mind and \"…there is ample evidence in the Qur'an to suggest that animals' consciousness of spirit and mind is of a degree higher than mere instinct and intuition. We are told in the Qur'an that animals have a cognizance of their Creator and, hence, they pay their obeisance to Him by adoration and worship: Seest thou not that it is Allah Whose praises are celebrated by all beings in the heavens and on earth, and by the birds with extended wings? Each one knows its prayer and psalm, And Allah is aware of what they do. (Qur'an 24:41).\n\n\nIt is worth noting the statement that 'each one knows its prayer and psalm'. The execution of a voluntary act, performed consciously and intentionally, requires a faculty higher than that of instinct and intuition. Lest some people should doubt that animals could have such a faculty, the following verse points out that it is human ignorance that prevents them from understanding this phenomenon: The seven heavens and the earth and all things therein declare His glory. There is not a thing but celebrates His adoration; and yet ye mankind! ye understand not how do they declare His glory…(Qur'an 17:44).\n\n\nFor more visit:\nhttp:\/\/islamictreasure.wordpress.com\/2010\/10\/31\/animals-in-islam\/\n\n\nThere will be animals in Paradise insha'allah.\n\n\nGo through this:\nhttp:\/\/www.islam-qa.com\/en\/ref\/14404\/animals%20in%20paradise\n\n\nFor more details and to see all stupid claims of Agniveer about Islamic paradise being answered and his knowledge being exposed, kindly visit:\n\n\nhttp:\/\/truthofhinduism.com\/rebuttals\/answering-agniveer\/rebuttal-to-allegationmisconception-superstitions-about-islamic-paradise\/\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAgniveer claims:\n\nq. Muslim countries are most rigid on religious beliefs. If one questions Quran in Islamic country, as per Sharia, he is liable to be killed. Muslim clerics can still tolerate questioning of Allah, but if their Prophet is questioned, they start proclaiming fatwa of death for the questioner. Thus unlike Jew or Christian people, most Muslims live in fear of adverse eventualities if they question Islam. Many other start rationalizing this and most others are brainwashed to believe that Islam alone is best, regardless of whether they know Arabic, have ever understood Quran or can critically examine Islam.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Response:\n\n\nWrong again !\n\n\nNo sensible Person will question against the Qur'an. If in doubt, one can surely question and ask the people and learned men who knows as is mentioned in the Qur'an 16:43.\n\n\nQur'an forbids unnecessary useless questions as already discussed earlier in answer to point (e).\n\n\nAgain a lie that Muslim clerics can tolerate questioning of Allah, but not of Prophet. I don't know how biased a person like Agniveer can be. He is claiming to be unbiased and on the other hand giving information about Hinduism in the disguise of Islam.\n\n\nSee again answer to point (e).\n\n\nIf anyone starts examining the Qur'an critically then Insha'allah he\/she will accept Islam, leave aside questioning as had been the case with many reverts to Islam. This is the reason Arya Samajis like Agniveer, and all those who are biased and bent on deviating people from the truth , don't read or critically examine the Qur'an as a whole, because if they do so, they will insha'allah accept Islam.\n\n\nBut as is obvious, Agniveer's mission in this birth life and all his supposed cycles, is to hinder people from the Truth.\n\n\nInshaAllah Read more: http:\/\/www.systemoflife.com\/answering-islamophobes\/agniveer\/225-religion-demystified-part-2-refuting-the-false-and-wrong-informations-given-by-agniveer#ixzz3duGQGT5F\n","publisher":{"@id":"#Publisher","@type":"Organization","name":"VedKaBhed.Com Fast Server","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"\/wp-content\/themes\/jannah\/assets\/images\/logo@2x.png"}},"sourceOrganization":{"@id":"#Publisher"},"copyrightHolder":{"@id":"#Publisher"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"\/index.php\/2015\/06\/23\/religion-demystified-refuting-false-lies-of-agniveer-part-2\/","breadcrumb":{"@id":"#Breadcrumb"}},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"vedkabhed","url":"\/author\/vedkabhed\/"}}</script>
