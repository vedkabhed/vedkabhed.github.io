<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:black;">Written by Abd al Muhsin al Ilaahbaad al Hindy<br>
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:black;"><strong>Quote: To explore the practical aspects of Islam further, we shall now review what Islam – through Hadiths (practical handbooks of Islam, belief in which is necessary to secure Heaven) instruct on hygienic practices. The choice is readers’ whether they want to embrace this practicality or pray to remain impractical forever! I believe Islamic Research Foundation can shed some light on these areas of research which baffle the sensibility of any civilized human being.</strong></span><br>
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:black;"><strong>(Most of these Hadiths explain everything themselves, we shall only comment in very few places, wherever necessary. As usual, they are lifted straight from Islamic sources with no modifications)</strong></span><br>
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> <span id="more-595"></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:black;">Well, his<em>(Agniveer)</em> epilogue , is quite deceiving to be concise, he claims to provide unmodified Islamic information<em>(claims mainly Hadeeth)</em> , which is pretty false, as throught out the article he, has many times not provided any quote ,but just cited a reference, and on it has built his concocted and far-fetched, irrational views and claims.Also , his quotation from inauthentic,fabricated sources will be evident later , in this article, Inshaa’Allah.Also we’ll see the so-called <em>“impracticality”</em> of Islam, and have a brief look at the <em>“practicality”</em> of Vedic Dharma<em>(Hinduism).</em> This article will try and shed light on the various issues.</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:black;">Lastly I would have used both Scriptures from the Orthodox Hindus and from the Protestant Hindus<em>(so-called Arya Samajis)</em><br>
<span style="text-decoration:underline;">For instance , Manu Smriti/Manava Dharma Shastra<em>(with few interpolations)</em> is authoritative to Protestant Hindus , and Other Puranas,Smirits (Vishnu,Gautama..etc) are authoritative and holy according Orthodox Hindus, and Yajurveda Translation used is , of Protestant Hindu Interpretation</span>.I’ve tried to create a balance by using scriptures from both the camps , so as to shed some light for any Truth Seeker and also our general reader.Also , in quotes are the words of Agniveer, and elsewhere its stated as cited.</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:black;">Finally, I would like to ask people who are genuinely interested in Islam to browse through this website to learn about Islam –</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p><a href="http:/www.islamreligion.com/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="color:blue;font-family:Times New Roman;text-decoration:underline;">www.islamreligion.com</span></a><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:black;"><strong>Now coming back to the topic and to proceed:</strong></span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:black;">Firstly the article is too caddish and impertinent which is the usual manner of Islamophobes like Agniveer and his loony-toon company , also this article hardly needs a refutation , as these so-called arguments prove nothing but the evil, deceiving, lying face of Protestant Hindus <em>[the self-claimed “Noble” (Arya) Samajis]</em>.Again as we all know that he is<em>(Agniveer)</em> “big” plagiarist this article to is adapted and mostly copied from Abul Qasems’ <em>(an Islamophobe)</em> useless articles.</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:black;"><span style="font-size:12pt;">In the whole article Agniveer seems to be obsessed by the fact that Prophet Muhammad <em>(Sallal lahu Alayhi wa Sallam )</em>was Noblest Human ever and his followers held him so high that they even took his sweat and used it with perfumes as it had beautiful and very good fragrance and this indeed was a miracle , which people during his time witnessed.I think Agniveer is quite obsessed with the High rank Prophet Muhammad <em>(Salall lahu alayhi wa Sallam)</em> was provided by the Allâh</span> Almighty<em>(One True God)</em> and the reverence, people had for him.</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:black;">Now scrutinizing the article a bit exposes Agniveer and his deception ! I wonder who can he fool? As every Muslim knows , the importance Islam lays on Hygiene cleanliness , and purity. Agniveer and his article are only helpful to the blind followers like Protestant Hindus <em>(so-called Arya Samajis)</em> knowing the fact that hardly they know truth and nor they try to seek it.</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:black;"><strong>Quote: 1.Muhammad ordered his followers to drink the water which he rinsed his mouth wit!h</strong></span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:black;">Sahih Bukhari (1.187)</span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:black;">Narrated Abu Juhaifa: Allah’s Apostle came to us at noon and water for ablution (cleaning body) was brought to him. After he had performed ablution, the remaining water was taken by the people and they started smearing their bodies with it (as a blessed thing). The Prophet offered two rak`at of the Zuhr prayer and then two rak`at of the `Asr prayer while a short spear (or stick) was there (as a Sutra) in front of him. Abu Musa said: The Prophet asked for a tumbler containing water and washed both his hands and face in it and then <strong>threw a mouthful of water in the tumbler and said to both of us (Abu Musa and Bilal), “Drink from the tumbler and pour some of its water on your faces and chests.”</strong></span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;font-family:Times New Roman;">The Hadeeth quoted by Agniveer is quite clear and shows the reverence the Muslims had toward the Prophet Muhammad(Sallal lahu Alayhi wa Sallam).Now Agniveer exposes his sheer deception when he says<span style="color:red;"> “Muhammad ordered his followers to drink the water which he rinsed his mouth with”</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;font-family:Times New Roman;">The Hadeeth is clear that Prophet<span style="color:#666666;"> <span style="color:blue;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>“threw a mouthful of water in the tumbler”</strong></span><span style="color:#666666;"> <span style="color:black;">now , how do we throw a mouthful of water? Of course with Hands ! Nowhere does the Hadeeth talk of rinsing his mouth! Nowhere does Hadeeth say that Prophet spat the water in the tumbler, what the beloved prophet did was he threw extra water which he had in his hand, in tumbler which was a mouthful of amount , and the reasons for it are quite clear :</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:black;">1) Avoiding wastage of water and extravagant use of it.<br>
2) Arabia was and is a desert peninsula ,where people hardly had water to drink and in such times wasting water could be dangerous and regretful later.</span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:black;">Also the point should be noted that the people were very eager to use the water that Prophet Muhammad used . As this is quite noticeable from the Hadeeth. The people were eager to use the water from the tumbler which the Prophet had used for ablution. Which only proves the high esteem the Prophet of Mercy was held in by those who at first were thirsty of his blood and later embraced Islam and believe in him, this is the love the believers had for him as we all know the great miracles that were provided to him which were witnessed by these people.</span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt;"><strong>Quote: To prove his divine authority, Muhammad even let a sick boy drink the leftover water after he had performed ablution (Sahih Bukhari, 1.4.189).</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt;"><strong><br>
Another boy drank the leftover water/milk that Muhammad had drunk (Sahih Bukhari, 3.40.541, 554)As per Sahih Bukhari, Prophet’s spit after mouthwash, and water that remained after his cleaning of all body parts, had miraculous properties.</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">It’s really shameful even to see Agniveer , lying and twisting Hadeeth to deviate and fool people , above he alleges Prophet Muhammad to have <span style="color:red;">“let a sick boy”<span style="color:black;"> (Sa’ib) drink the so-called <span style="color:red;"><em>“leftover”</em><span style="color:black;"> water<em>(which was not leftover but the remaining water in the vessel from which Prophet drew some water to perform his ablution)</em> but as we read the full hadeeth the truth is crystal clear to us. Did the Prophet do so? Of course not, as the sick boy(Sa’ib) himself said<span style="font-size:12pt;"> “</span></span></span></span></span></span><span style="color:#7030a0;"><span style="font-family:Bookman Old Style;font-size:12pt;">then he(Prophet) performed ablution and I drank from the remaining water. <span style="color:#e36c0a;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">I stood behind him</span><span style="color:#7030a0;"> and saw the seal of Prophethood between his shoulders”</span></span></span><span style="color:black;font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt;">  </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:black;">The boy drank the remaining water in the vessel from which the prophet had drawn little water to perform his ablution, and while he <em>(Sa’ib the sick boy )</em>was drinking the water he was behind the Prophets back and the holy Prophet was busy praying. So what does this prove , it’s clear <span style="text-decoration:underline;">it proves that the water was not <em>“leftover”</em> but remaining water of the vessel from which Prophet had taken out some to perform his ablution</span> and while the sick boy drank the water from this vessel <span style="text-decoration:underline;">he was standing right back of Prophet and the prophet was busy praying</span>. This again proves the lying and twisting nature of Islamophobes. And anyone who reads the hadeeth in full will clearly see the deception of the claimant; hence Agniveer didn’t provide the full hadeeth, as this would expose him and his lies.</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:black;">Coming to the another two hadeeth which Agniveer has cited (i.e. Sahih Bukhari, 3.40.541, 554), both the hadeeth are quoted completely below.</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:51pt;"><span style="color:purple;font-family:Bookman Old Style;">Narrated Sahl bin Sa`d: A tumbler (full of milk or water) was brought to the Prophet who drank from it, while on his right side there was sitting a boy who was the youngest of those who were present and on his left side there were old men. The Prophet asked, “O boy, will you allow me to give it (i.e. the rest of the drink) to the old men?” The boy said, “O <span style="font-size:12pt;">Allâh</span>‘s Apostle! I will not give preference to anyone over me to drink the rest of it from which you have drunk.” So, the Prophet gave it to him<span style="font-size:10pt;">. </span></span><span style="color:black;font-family:Garamond;font-size:9pt;">– (Saheeh al Bukhari , 3:40:541)</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:black;">And ,</span><br>
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:51pt;"><span style="color:purple;font-family:Bookman Old Style;">Narrated Sahl bin Sa`d: Once a tumbler (full of milk or water)was brought to <span style="font-size:12pt;">Allâh</span>‘s Apostle who drank from it, while on his right side there was sitting a boy who was the youngest of those who were present, and on his left side there were old men. The Prophet asked, “O boy ! Do you allow me to give (the drink) to the elder people (first)?” The boy said, “I will not prefer anybody to have my share from you, O <span style="font-size:12pt;">Allâh</span>‘s Apostle!” So, he gave it to the boy.</span><span style="color:#7030a0;"> <span style="color:black;font-family:Garamond;font-size:9pt;">– (Saheeh al Bukhari , 3:40:554)</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:black;">As we can see both the Hadeeth are approximately same – ditto with same meaning with little variation in words. Now coming to the deception of Agniveer, we can see that the Hadeeth talks of a tumbler containing milk or water , which the prophet intended to give to the elder people who were seated to the left of the tumbler, so what this proves is the respect, love and mercy which prophet held for the Old and the love of kids for their Prophet. Also this Hadeeth proves how Islam bridges gap between generations and the rich and poor, the prophet gave the from the same tumbler from which drink he drank to those who were present there and the Kid was eager to take this drink as he knew the holiness of a drink by the hand of the Prophet, so did the others knew.</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:black;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Again, now we shall analyze distortion,twists and spins used by Agniveer to fool people, he wrote <span style="color:red;">“</span></span><span style="font-family:Verdana;">Another boy drank the leftover water/milk that Muhammad had drunk” </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">now again here he is trying to make the Prophet of Mercy as a <em>“tyrant”</em> asked people to consume his leftovers, but as we read that Prophet took his drink – water/milk ,from the tumbler and then passed it to other people so that they too could benefit from it, and this is what is called <strong>“Sharing”</strong>, and <strong>“love”</strong> for all people, which Islam preaches and this is totally alien to Agniveer , as it seems.</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:black;">So a question arises, <strong>“Is it wrong to share a drink from the same tumbler ?” </strong>Especially when you’re living in a Desert where one hardly has a few drops of water to drink ! </span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:black;">Concisely this hadeeth only proves , Islam and its equality and encouragement for sharing resources and increasing love between people, I am pretty sure that Agniveer will hardly contemplate this Hadeeth as these qualities are alien to him and his <strong>“Vedic Dharma.”</strong></span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;font-family:Garamond;font-size:14pt;text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Now let’s briefly see what do the <em>“Holy”</em> Dharma Shastras <em>(Hindu Law Books) </em>which the “Great” Hindu Sages like Parashar et al . conveyed to the Hindus and derived from the <em>“Holy”</em> Vedas! :::</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:51pt;"><span style="color:#f79646;"><span style="font-family:Bookman Old Style;font-size:10pt;">“<span style="color:red;"><strong>Articles of food</strong><span style="color:#f79646;"><br>

</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:51pt;"><span style="color:black;"><span style="font-family:Bookman Old Style;font-size:10pt;">“To eat a Shoodra’s food<span style="color:#f79646;">, <span style="color:red;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>to associate with him, to sit in the same place with, him, and receive knowledge by his instruction, would cause degradation</strong></span><span style="color:#f79646;"><br>
<span style="color:black;">even to one who resembles the kindled fire.”</span></span></span></span></span> <span style="color:black;font-family:Garamond;font-size:10pt;">( <strong>Parashara Smriti</strong> ,Ch 12 verse 34)</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:51pt;"><span style="color:black;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Bookman Old Style;">“When a Brahman through ignorance chances to eat any food that belongs to one of the Chandala caste, <span style="color:red;"><strong>he should <span style="text-decoration:underline;">purify </span>himself by living on half-ripe barley and <span style="text-decoration:underline;">cow’s urine</span> for ten nights. The barley should be steeped in the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">cow’s urine</span>, and one mouthful thereof should be taken day by day ; for <span style="text-decoration:underline;">ten days</span> he must live a blameless life</strong> ;<span style="color:#f79646;"> <span style="color:black;">this is the penance prescribed for him.”  </span></span></span></span><span style="font-family:Garamond;">(<strong>Parashara Smriti</strong> ,Ch 6 verses 32 – 33)</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:black;">I think these verse (laws) prove a lot of things to the Hindus, I think it also exposes their , discrimination toward , varying fractions of society<em>( the so-called Shudras)</em>. So I do not expect Agniveer to stand out for <strong>“equality”</strong>, <strong>“Sharing”</strong><br>
<strong>“Brotherly love” “Humanity”</strong> ..etc. when his <em>“great”</em> Vedic predecessors who are stilled revered by these Hindus as <em>“Sages”</em> were just the opposite, and so was their so-called <em>“great Vedic civilization”.</em></span><span style="font-size:12pt;"></span></span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:black;"><strong><em>Quote: Comment: Could not the Prophet find more civilized way of blessing and treating people than providing them his excreta?

</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:black;">Here , Agniveer tries to promulugate , that <em>“Vedic Dharma”</em> is more civilized than the Only True Religion/Way of Life – Islam, we shall Inshaa’Allah, verify these claims and scrutinize it to show the people , so that the people may see and contemplate the truth.Futher , in the article, these pompous claims are verified in the light of truth, with facts and not just talk and useless, rhetoric.Also, we shall expose the truth , about </span><br>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:black;">He<em>(Agniveer)</em> claims , Vedic Dharma conforms to the highest standard of Hygiene and considers that only wretched people use such <em>‘Jootha'(i.e. ‘dirty water’ , as written by hm)</em> !Let’s examine his claims and scrutinize it.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:black;"><strong>Is it permissible in Islam to use the leftover water</strong> ?

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:black;">What we read above is a clear statement of the Prophet , prohibiting the usage of leftover water, I guess this should totally expose those who alleged prophet of making people drink, and use leftover water.</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:black;">We see the , truth of vedic liars and their concocted claims about Islam, which only <span style="text-decoration:underline;">blind followers</span> of Vedic Dharma<em>(Hinduism)</em> and none else can accept.Now its time to scrutinise the Hindu scriptures and see how hygienic they are and what do they mean by cleanliness and purity.</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:black;">The penance for Drinking Spiritual liquor ,according to the Manu Shastra/Smriti<em>(one of the most authentic Hindu Law Book)</em>:</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff6600;"><span style="font-family:Bookman Old Style;font-size:10pt;">“A twice-born man who has (intentionally) drunk, through delusion of mind, (the spirituous liquor called) Sura shall drink that liquor boiling-hot; when his body has been completely scalded by that, he is freed from his guilt;<span style="color:#ff9900;"> <span style="color:red;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Or he may <span style="color:green;">drink<span style="color:red;"> cow’s urine</span></span></strong></span><span style="color:#ff6600;">, water, milk, clarified butter or<span style="color:#ff9900;"> <span style="color:red;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>(liquid) cowdung boiling-hot</strong></span><span style="color:#ff6600;">, until<span style="color:#ff9900;"> <span style="color:#ff6600;">he dies;” </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span style="color:black;"><span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:10pt;">( The Laws of Manu, Ch 11 verses 91-92, Translated by George Bühler)</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:black;">Here the Twice-Born man refers to any human of the first three caste of hindu caste System.So drinking of Urine, Cowdung or Ordure is praiseworthy and a way to get rid of sins, amazing isn’t it?</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:black;font-family:Times New Roman;">Another Type of Penance is Samtapana Krikkhra wherein you eat and sustain on <span style="color:green;"><strong>“Excreta”</strong><span style="color:black;"> –</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:red;"><span style="font-family:Bookman Old Style;font-size:10pt;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>“<span style="color:green;">(Subsisting on) <span style="color:red;">the urine of cows, cowdung</span></span></strong></span><span style="color:#ff6600;">, milk, sour milk (yogurt), clarified butter, and a decoction of Kusa-grass, and fasting during one (day and) night, (that is) called a Samtapana Krikkhra.”</span></span></span><span style="color:black;"> <span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:10pt;">( The Laws of Manu, Ch 11 verse 213, Translated by George Bühler)</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:black;">Also this has been promoted in Vaishnava DharmaShastra/Sutras commonly known as Vishnu Smriti –</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p style="margin-left:14pt;"><span style="color:#ff6600;"><span style="font-family:Bookman Old Style;font-size:10pt;">“A Sudra (who has eaten the food) of another Sudra , while the latter was impure, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">must bathe (in a river) and <span style="color:green;">drink</span></span><span style="color:#ff6600;"><br>
<span style="color:red;"><strong>Pankagavya</strong><span style="color:#ff6600;">.”</span></span></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:black;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><strong>Note</strong> : The <em>“Pankagavya”</em>, or five productions of a cow, consist of milk, sour milk, butter, <span style="color:red;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">urine, and cow-dung</span><span style="color:black;">.<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></span></span><span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:10pt;">– [ Vishnu Smriti Ch 22, verse 18, pg 89, Translated by Julius Jolly ,Oxford , Clarendon Press , 1880]</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:black;">So what we learn is, its not Islam that has been calling people to eat, drink and sustain on <strong>“Excreta”</strong> as alleged by ill-intentioned lying hindus , but it’s the so-called “Holy” Vedic Dharma<em>(Hinduism)</em> which calls to eating and drinking of <strong>Excreta</strong>.And there are more verses like such where hindus are ordered to eat , and drink excreta, but I guess this shall suffice the truth seeker and expose the lies against the only true way of Life , that’s Islam.Inshaa’Allah we’ll see a lot more verses on cleanliness, hygiene and purification found in Hindu Scriptures which will help us understand what these terms mean in Hinduism.</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:black;"><strong>Quote: Let us explore this Science of Islam and Hygiene from the original texts</strong>:</span><br>
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:black;">Agniveer writes about exploring Science of Islam and HYGIENE but his I mpertinent, imbecilic article proves , that he has been copying from his <strong><em>” Idols’ “</em></strong> websites that are Christian missionary and Islamophobes and he too is a wannabee Islamphobe. He hasn’t explored anything but just copied from the missionaries , now is this exploring ?</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:black;"> I would like to take this as an opportunity to educate people about Islamic stance on cleanliness, hygience, purity, manners which will surely expose the deceiving face of Islamophobes and their lying nature of Islamophobes et al.</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:black;"><span style="font-size:12pt;">Let’s see what Islam teaches of hygiene, purity and cleanliness. Islam is a religion of cleanliness and hygiene unlike other pagan and human-invented religions like Sanatan Dharma<em>(Hinduism , Protestant Hinduism et al.)</em>, Christianity…etc. Islam stressed on cleanliness and hygiene very much as Allâh</span> the Most High says:</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:green;"><span style="font-family:Garamond;"><span style="font-size:12pt;"><strong>“Truly, Allâh loves those who turn unto Him in repentance<span style="color:yellowgreen;"><br>
<span style="color:red;">and <span style="text-decoration:underline;">loves those who purify themselves </span><span style="color:green;">(by taking a bath and cleaning and washing thoroughly their private parts, bodies, for their prayers, etc.).”</span></span></span></strong><span style="color:#666666;"> </span></span><span style="color:black;font-size:9pt;">(2:222)</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:green;"><span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:12pt;"><strong>“Never stand you therein. Verily, the mosque whose foundation was laid from the first day on piety is more worthy that you stand therein (to pray). In it are men who l ove to clean and to purify themselves.<span style="color:yellowgreen;"> <span style="color:red;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">And Allâh loves those who make themselves clean and pure</span><span style="color:yellowgreen;">  <span style="color:green;">(i.e. who clean their private parts with dust (i.e. to be considered as soap) and water from urine and stools, after answering the call of nature).”</span></span></span></span></strong></span><span style="color:#666666;"><span style="font-family:Bookman Old Style;font-size:10pt;"><strong> </strong></span><span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:9pt;">(9:108)</span><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt;"><br>

<span style="color:red;"><strong>“<span style="text-decoration:underline;">O you who believe! When you rise up for prayer, wash your faces, and your hands up to the elbows, and wipe your heads (with wet hands), and (wash) your feet up to the ankles. And if you are in a state of major ritual  impurity (janaba), purify yourselves (by taking a bath)<span style="color:green;">.</span></span> <span style="color:green;">And if you are sick or on a journey, or one of you comes from the answering of call of nature, or you have had contact with women, and you find no water, then go to clean earth and wipe your faces and hands with some of it. Allâh does not want to place you in difficulty, but He wants to purify you and to perfect His grace upon you that you may give thanks.”</span></strong></span></span><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt;"> </span><span style="color:black;font-family:Garamond;font-size:9pt;">(5:6)</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:black;">These above quoted Holy Qur’anic verse state that <span style="font-size:12pt;">Allâh</span> the Most Merciful loves purity and those who purify themselves and those who are hygienic, these verses are enough to disprove any void/baseless allegations like Agniveer has alleged Islam with nonetheless as said earlier this will be taken as an opportunity to educate and teach people , about the cleanliness, purity, hygiene in Islam.Agniveer has hardly tried to research the subject or delved into Islamic literature to learn and read about Prophet Muhammad’s <em>(Sallal lahu Alayhi wa Sallam)</em> sayings and stance on cleanliness and hygiene which is clearly observable from his incoherent and deceptive article. Now we shall learn and contemplate Prophet’s words and stance on the subject.</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>

</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:black;">Purification or cleanliness is considered an inseparable part of faith in Islam and I believe this single hadeeth of the Prophet of mercy Muhammad <em>(Sallal lahu Alayhi wa Sallam)</em> rebuts all the lies concocted against him on the issue of hygiene and cleanliness, as we read above that in Islam cleanliness is half of faith , that is if you are clean and hygienic its as if you have acquitted half of faith, and as we see that this hadeeth is been recorded in Saheeh Muslim which Agniveer quotes extensively to promulgate his concocted lies , but fails to provide this hadeeth this exposes him and his false lies , agendas against Islam in full.</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:black;">Inshaa’Allah we’ll delve deep into this issue to show people the true Islamic stance on the subject.</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:black;">None of the prayers, are valid in Islam until and unless you are pefectly, pure.And as our beloved Prophet said that he disliked even taking the name of <span style="font-size:12pt;">Allâh</span> Azz wa Jall , while he was defiled or impure, this should clear all the misconceptions and concocted lies against the Prophet of mercy Muhammad <em>(Sallal lahu alayhi wa Sallam).</em></span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:black;">These Hadiths rebukes those who eat these raw legumes and threaten to exclude him from approaching the mosques. Lastly, cleanliness and pleasant appearance are of characteristics which allow relationships to strengthen amongst people. The sane human being will try to avoid people who are unkempt. Hence, the Prophet emphasized the importance of cleanliness , hygiene and purity. Similarly, there is a prohibition on eating garlic, onion, leek and food like it, before going to the mosque in order not to disturb others from the strong odor. If one insists on eating them, then he is not permitted to enter the mosque and is deprived of the congregational Prayer.</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
I. Spit three times to the left when someone questions who created Allah. (ibn Ishaq, p.270)<br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:black;">j. Prophet spat on his clothes (Bukhari 1.4.242)</span><br>
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:black;">Inshaa’Allah, these conjectures and concocted claims will be refuted in full, to proceed :</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:black;font-family:Times New Roman;">The ahadeeth <span style="color:purple;"><em>(Saheeh Muslim, Book 25, ahadeeth 5340 , 5341,5345</em>) <span style="color:black;">quoted in point (<span style="color:red;">a<span style="color:black;">) only shows , how <strong>merciful</strong>,<strong>humble</strong> and <strong>ever-helpful</strong> Prophet Muhammad was, he even helped <span style="text-decoration:underline;">people in taking care of their children</span>, ,and with regards to chewing dates to soften them, so that a newly born child can eat it then , I don’t find any reason for any criticism, infact it’s a sign of mercy and love towards children.And this was also a norm which was followed then, and this is even done throught out the world, as this helps the child chew and digest the food , easily.</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:black;">These cited ahadeeth ,are infact prooving, the Islam, and the Prophet of Mercy’s love and care towards children, and his striving to provide them , the best in his capabilities.</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:black;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Now coming to the point (<span style="color:red;">b<span style="color:black;">) where Agniveer intentionally tries to deceive people by writing <span style="color:red;">“</span></span></span></span><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt;">When Anas’s son was born, <span style="color:red;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Muhammad fed him with dates mixed with his (Muhammad’s) saliva</span> and gave him the name Abdullah.”</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:black;">Let me quote excerpt of the Hadeeth to reveal his deception :</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:17pt;"><span style="color:purple;font-family:Bookman Old Style;font-size:10pt;">I<em>(Abu Talha , father of the child)</em> brought that child to him and placed it in his lap and Allâh’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) asked Ajwa dates of Medina to be brought and softened them in his month. When these had become palatable he placed them in the mouth of that child. The child began to taste them. Then Allâh’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: See what love the Ansar have for dates. He then wiped his face and named him ‘Abdullah.”</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:black;font-family:Times New Roman;">Here again ,just as in the ahadeeth cited in point (<span style="color:red;">a<span style="color:black;">),Prophet Muhammad<em>(Sallal lahu Alayhi wa Sallam)</em> chewed the date so ,that it would be easier on the newlyborn child to consume them, nowhere does the hadeeth says that “<span style="color:red;">Muhammad fed him with dates mixed with his (Muhammad’s) saliva” <span style="color:black;">as implied by Agniveer, this is just another trick to deviate people , so its clear that Prophet Muhammad did not feed his Saliva to the child as claimed and hence he(Agniveer) made a new point for this single hadeeth just to fool people, when this hadeeth is same like the ones cited in point (<span style="color:red;">a<span style="color:black;">).</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:black;">And , Prophet Muhammad was indeed the most generous and merciful man , and this is what is well-know :</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:8pt;"><span style="color:purple;font-family:Bookman Old Style;font-size:10pt;">Abu Hurayra said, “When the Messenger of Allâh, may Allâh bless him and grant him peace, was brought new dates, he said, ‘O Allâh! Bless us in our city and in our mudd and sa’ (units of measure) , blessing upon blessing.<span style="text-decoration:underline;">‘ Then he would give one to the youngest of the children with him</span>.”</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p style="margin-left:65pt;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:black;"><span style="font-size:10pt;">–</span><span style="font-size:7pt;">          </span><span style="font-size:10pt;">[ Al-Adab al-Mufrad, no. 168]</span></span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:black;">This was our Prophet the most genrous man and the most kind too.These are the few chracterstics from him, which are enough to reveal the decption of polemics et al.</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:black;font-family:Times New Roman;">The Hadeeth <span style="color:purple;">(<em>i.e. Bukhari Vol 1, Book 4, Number 188 )</em><span style="color:#666666;"><br>
<span style="color:black;">quoted in point (<span style="color:red;">c<span style="color:black;">) is just repeated again , this was quoted earlier in the article, the hadeeth is as follow :</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left:11pt;"><span style="color:#333399;"><span style="font-family:Bookman Old Style;font-size:10pt;">Narrated Ibn Shihab: Mahmud bin Ar-Rabi’ who was the person on whose face the Prophet had ejected a mouthful of water from his family’s well while he was a boy, and ‘Urwa (on the authority of Al-Miswar and others) who testified each other, said, “Whenever the Prophet , performed ablution, his companions were nearly fighting for the remains of the water.”</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:black;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">The hadeeth just talks about prophet ejecting a mouthful amount of water on the face of the boy<em>(Mahmud)</em> from his own<em>(Mahmud)</em> family’s well, and the reasons are not<span style="font-size:12pt;"> know , most </span>probably its was the boy’s own request , hence the narrators quoted al-Miswar and others who said <span style="color:#333399;">“</span></span><span style="font-family:Bookman Old Style;">Whenever the Prophet , performed ablution, his companions were nearly fighting for the remains of the water.”</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"> As every one wanted the prophet of mercy to do something for him, and requested them to full fill their wish.And as we believe and is well-known about his miracles , this water too was of miraculous nature, unlike the usual water or dirty water. So what is apparent is that the boy himself may have request the prophet of mercy Muhammad <em>(Sallal lahu Alayhi wa Sallam)</em> to eject the water on his face so that he may be blessed.And we also learn that the water remaining in any tumbler,vessel or otherwise was fought over by the companions for its acquistion, as the Prophet was miraculous and his miracles were well know in both Muslim and non-Muslim circles.</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:black;">Now let’s have a brief look at the Hindu Scriptures and their love for hygience and cleanliness , which has been practices for centuries in India by Hindus.</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p style="margin-left:14pt;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:black;">The Upa-Purana says :</span></span><span style="color:#ff6600;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><em><br>
</em></span><span style="font-family:Bookman Old Style;font-size:10pt;">“Narayana said :—” O Narada! I am now talking of the three kinds of ashes ;<span style="color:red;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>hearing this even destroys one’s sins and brings in good fame. When a cow evacuates her dung ,just as the cow dang leaves her and is far from reaching the ground, one should catch it with one’s hand</strong></span><span style="color:#ff6600;"> and this cowdung burnt with “Sadyojatadi i.e. Brahma Mantra” becomes ashes which are called “Santika Bhasma,” i.e. <span style="color:red;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">ashes producing peace</span><span style="color:#ff6600;">. <span style="color:red;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Before the cowdung is about to reach the ground, the devotee should take it with his hand and uttering the six lettered Mantra</span><span style="color:#ff6600;">, he is to burn the cowdung. The ashes from this are called ” Paustik Bhasma<span style="color:red;">” <span style="text-decoration:underline;">i.e. ashes leading to nourishment</span>.<span style="color:#ff6600;"> If the cowdung be burned with the Mantra “Haum,” the ashes of this are called “Kamala Bhasma” i.e., <span style="color:red;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">ashes leading to the granting of desires</span><span style="color:#ff6600;">.” <sup>1</sup></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span style="color:black;font-size:9pt;"> <span style="font-family:Garamond;"><sup>– </sup> [Srimad Devi Bhagvatam,Book 11, Ch 11, pg 1081 , Translated by Swami Vijananda ,3<sup>rd</sup> Ed., Panini Office- Allahabad]</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:black;">So according to this Upa-Purana , <span style="text-decoration:underline;">hearing this text <em>(presented above) </em>destroys sins, and brings good fame</span>, also we read and learn about , <span style="text-decoration:underline;">catching cow-dung and its when various virtues when , burnt with chants<em>(vedic mantras)</em></span>, so why is it that the prophet’s used water cannot be miraculous?Also elsewhere it’s stated( in a Purana, below) –</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p style="margin-left:14pt;"><span style="color:#ff6600;"><span style="font-family:Bookman Old Style;font-size:10pt;">” The support of everything is this cow … and <span style="text-decoration:underline;">her horns are pious acts ; her hair the excellent words of the good ; <span style="color:red;"><strong>her ordure and urine are tranquillity and prosperity</strong></span></span><span style="color:#ff6600;">…”</span></span></span><span style="color:black;"><span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:9pt;"> [ Markandeya Purana, Canto 29 ,verses 7-8, pg 152, Translated by F.Eden Pargiter, Published by the Asiatic Society, 1904]</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:black;">The preceding , texts shows the reverence, and love of hindus for cow-ordure,urine and these this are infact <em>“tranquility”</em> and <em>“prosperity”</em> , so why is it that prophet’s water when fought over by his companions<em>(for it’s acquisiton) </em>, is criticised when these hindus indulge in vilest of all things and praise those<em>(dirty,filthy,natsty..etc.)</em> things?</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:black;">Also the <em>“Holy” </em>veda says : </span><br>
</span></p>

</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:black;">And the it also says :</span><br>

</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:14pt;text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Also see how Hindus are give <span style="color:green;">Protection<span style="color:black;"> and seek <span style="color:green;">Protection<span style="color:black;"> –</span></span></span></span></strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p style="margin-left:14pt;"><span style="color:#ff9900;"><span style="font-family:Bookman Old Style;font-size:10pt;">“<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>The <span style="color:red;">child<span style="color:#ff9900;"> was <span style="color:red;">thoroughly washed<span style="color:#ff9900;"> with <span style="color:red;">cow urine<span style="color:#ff9900;"> and then <span style="color:red;">smeared with the dust <span style="color:#ff9900;">raised by the movements of the cows</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></strong></span>. Then different names of the Lord were applied with cow dung on twelve different parts of His body, beginning with the forehead, as done in applying tilaka. <span style="color:red;"><strong><em>In this way, the child was given protection</em></strong><span style="color:#ff9900;">.” </span></span></span><span style="color:black;font-family:Garamond;font-size:9pt;">[ Srimad Bhagvatam , Canto 10, Ch 6, text- 20 , Translated by A.C.

</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:black;">This is the way hindus protect their children, so where’s all the talk about Hygiene and cleanliness?</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><span style="font-family:Garamond;text-decoration:underline;"><strong><span style="font-size:14pt;">Hindu Gods (great sages and people etc., to Protestant Hindu)</span><span style="font-size:14pt;"> look <span style="color:green;"><em>“Beautiful”</em><span style="color:black;"> in Cow Dung and Cow-Urine !:</span></span></span></strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#ff6600;"><span style="font-family:Bookman Old Style;font-size:10pt;">“When Krsna and Balarama, with the strength of Their legs, crawled in the muddy places created in Vraja by cow dung and cow urine… <span style="color:red;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Dressed with muddy earth mixed with cow dung and cow urine, the babies looked very beautiful</strong></span><span style="color:#ff6600;">, and when They went to Their mothers, both Yasoda and Rohini picked Them up with great affection, embraced Them and allowed Them to suck the milk flowing from their breasts.” </span></span></span> <span style="color:black;font-family:Garamond;"><span style="font-size:9pt;">[ Srimad Bhagvatam , Canto 10, Ch 8, text’s 22-23, Translated by A.C. Bhaktivedanta Prabhupada, Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International]</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:black;font-family:Times New Roman;">What, I see is various, animals according to the vedas posses various, qualities which are higher in degree to them like cow has qualities of Sun! And in the verse quoted before this verse , cows are claimed to be <span style="color:red;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>protectors</strong></span><span style="color:black;"> of the heaven and the earth! Again , it’s strange that these people talk of science.Or is it that the Hindu God<em>(Ishwar)</em> does not know the qualities of various animals and hence indulges in gross exaggeration?</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:black;">Also, <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>when cows can posses qualities of sun</strong></span>, and <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>be protectors of earth and heaven</strong></span> then ,I question whats the problem , when the prophet’s water is regarded as miraculous <em>(infact its blessedand miraculous)</em>, or blessed, they caddishly make fun of it, when he<em>(Prophet Muhammad Sallal lahu alayhi wa sallam)</em> was the final messenger of the One True Almighty God <em>(<span style="font-size:12pt;">Allâh</span>)</em>, and was blessed and given various miracles.And the creatures which the Veda exaggerate about are mere animals!<em>(Though they have their own qualitites and specialities which they are loved and respected for.)</em></span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:black;">In the Hindu Scriptures cows, horses..etc<em>.(who are mere animals)</em> and their ordure are given qualities which they don’t posses and are blatantly claimed to be <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>protectors</strong></span> of us<em>(earth and heaven)</em>. Well , this is adequate, to prove how, hygienic, practical, scientific Vedic Dharma<em>(Hinduism)</em> is<em>.</em>Also , today I have learned that people can even look good , covered in Urine and Cow Dung, not good but beautiful, it is really amazing to read these verse which shed light on the meaning of Hygiene , cleanliness and purity in Hinduism, Oh! Also Beauty!</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:black;"> It’s hilarious to read these verses , as they are proof for the human origin of these books<em>(Vedas et al.)</em>.</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:black;font-family:Times New Roman;">Now the points (<span style="color:red;">d,e,f,g<span style="color:black;">) all are quote from the book of al-Qâdî `Iyâd , that’s Ash-Shifâ’ and here’s what the Muslims Scholars have to say about the authenticity of the book.Though the book is known as good refernce for spirituality<em>(and other subjects)</em> as it contains good advises for those who seeking to increase their consciousness of <span style="font-size:12pt;">Allâh<em>(One True Almighty God)</em></span> the All-Knowledgeable and spirituality.The great Islamic Scholar on the authenticity of the hadeeth found in the book –</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:14pt;"><span style="color:#3366ff;font-family:Bookman Old Style;font-size:10pt;"><em>Imam Shams al-Dîn al-Dhahabî in his immense biographical encyclopedia entitled Siyar A`lâm al-Nubalâ’. In his biographical entry on al-Qâdî `Iyâd (20/212-216), he writes: <strong>“His writings are valuable and one of his best works would have been his book al-Shifâ’ <span style="color:red;">had it not been <span style="text-decoration:underline;">filled with fabricated hadîth</span>.<span style="color:#3366ff;">“</span></span></strong> </em></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:black;">I think this clears the fog , and we find Agniveer using inauthentic, fabricated hadeeth, to promulugate, and insinuate his lies against the Prophet of mercy Muhammad <em>(Sallal lahu Alayhi wa Sallam)</em>.The Hadeeth need to be proven first, to be authentic and the citations he has provided comes from the book , famous for fabricated, false ahadeeth.This should suffice , and I hope Agniveer, cites some authentic ahadeeth.Citing fabrications,inauthentic hadeeth, false translations…etc are common traits of Islamophobes.</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:black;font-family:Times New Roman;">The point (<span style="color:red;">h<span style="color:black;">) , is again a clear deception where Agniveer only cites the refernces and provide’s not the full hadeeth <em>(i.e Saheeh Muslim, Book 4, no. 1121)</em>, as this will expose his concoted claims and this is also one of the method used when you are quoting out of context, and indeed this is what Agniveer has done here.The Hadeeth is recorded in the <strong>“Book of Prayers”</strong>(vol. 4) of Saheeh Muslim, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">in which ahadeeth pertaining to Prayer are recorded</span>, this should clear the mist a bit, now revealing the fact that prophet Muhammad in the hadeeth was talking of spitting while in the Mosque<em>(in the hadeeth cited)</em> , the hadeeth goes like this :</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:14pt;"><span style="color:purple;font-family:Bookman Old Style;font-size:10pt;">“Messenger of Allâh (may peace be upon him) saw some sputum in the direction of the Qibla of <span style="text-decoration:underline;">the mosque</span>. He turned towards people and said: How Is it that someone amongst you stands before his Lord… So when any one of you spits, he must spit on his left side under his foot. But if he does not find (space to spit) he should do like this. Qasim (one of the narrators) spat in his cloth and then folded it and rubbed it.”</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:black;">So we see that the Prophet is talking of spitting in the mosques<em> (in those times the mosques didn’t have tiles, or stones on the floor , its was ground,sand and the land without any tiles)</em> so if anyone who wanted to spit then he should spit under his left feet as this would be absorbed and covered in the sand, and if he does not find space or the floor is tiled <em>(as its not premissible to spit)</em> he should spat in his cloth <em>(people in those day were poor and could not afford hankerchiefs, infact some were so poor that they hardly had dresses to wear, or water to drink) </em>and rub it so that it absorbs it.I think people forget that ,this was more than 1400 years , ago in a desert peninsula, where people hardly had drops of water to drink, grains to eat ,and clothes to wear.And this is well-know, still polemic’s try and concoct against truth.</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:black;font-family:Times New Roman;">Point (<span style="color:red;">i<span style="color:black;">) talks of Prophet of Mercy Muhammad’s <em>(Sallal lahu Alayhi wa Sallam) </em>saying of spitting three times to your left when some one insinuatingly and to make you doubt , questions you <span style="color:purple;"><em>“Well, it is Allâh Who created the creation, but who created Allâh?”</em><span style="color:black;"><br>
<em>(as the pagans of Arab used to ask this to Muslims )</em>. The Prophet of Mercy commanded us to say <span style="color:purple;">“I affirm my faith in <em>Allâh.”</em><span style="color:black;"><br>
<strong>Or/and</strong>, spit three times to your left to debase the evil satan which encourages humans to question such imbecilic , and irrational questions.And this spitting is not spitting but blowing a few wind/moist to your left, and this too only where one is allowed to spit , like spitting on road is prohibitted in countries like K.S.A, so you need not spit either say the <em>“Verse”(or Du’aa), </em>or blow wind<em>(spit-less)</em> to your left to show the crooked satan his foolishness and debase him , that he isn’t only worth spitting.So basically here spitting , means sputum or saliva-less air blowed from the mouth.This hadeeth only proves the hatred and dislike of Muslims and Prophet of mercy toward <em>“Falsehood”</em> and <em>“Satan”</em> .</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:black;font-family:Times New Roman;">Point (<span style="color:red;">j<span style="color:black;">) has been earlier explained and refuted and debunked it’s the same as point (<span style="color:red;">h<span style="color:black;">).</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:black;">Well, these words/comment’s of Agniveer are hilarious,gravely misleading, and highly far-fetched, I pity <em>Agniveer</em> and his contemplating, interpretive skills , I would like to know who taught these skills to him, no doubt it’s the so-called <em>“Maharishis”</em><br>
<em>(Great Seers)</em>, <em>“Mahamunis”</em>, <em>“Yogis”</em> et al. who taught him these things. And I am amused to see the height of his imagination and conjectures. Wake up ,Agniveer can you come back to reality now , out of your imaginative world?Or if it pleases you, you can live in your delusions, as it’s all about personal quest for Truth, which the hindus dislike and despise taking in, which at least hurts them and detroys them.</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:black;">Earlier , Agniveer claimed , vedic dharma<em>(Hindu Religion)</em> to be <em>“Hygienic</em>” and Islam to be otherwise<em>(which is debunked earlier)</em> , now here are few sholka’s<em>(verses)</em> from the sacred <em>“Dharma Shastra”</em><br>

</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:black;">Well, I think this verse makes it straight, so even according to the Shastras, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Saliva fallen on any body, also flies…etc. aren’t impure</span>, so why isn’t Agniveer found criticising this verse or may be he is unaware? Wasn’t he pompously claiming Vedic Dharma <em>(Hindus)</em> to be hygienic? Well, now that’s Hygienic Hindusim, anyone who’s attended elementary schooling know , the how inhygienic flies are. Flies can be quite dirty and besides contaminating food with eggs and maggots, they can also carry bacteria that cause intestinal diseases. Flies can travel from fecal material to our food very easily, carrying bacteria with them on body hairs or the sticky pads on their feet. When feeding, flies expel saliva and feces that may also contain bacteria. It has been shown that each house fly can easily carry over one million bacteria on its body. Some of the disease-causing agents shown to be transmitted by house flies to humans are: higellosis, salmonella, typhoid fever, dysentery <em>(diarrhea),</em> Escherichia coli, conjunctivitis <em>(pink eye)</em> and parasitic worms.Also we learn that Saliva , falling from mouth of anybody part doesn’t render it <em>(saliva and its owner)</em> impure, so why is Prophet’s blowing moist on left side, or spitting on cloth to avoid contanimating surrounding , been criticised? Well the anwers is ,bias Hindu minds.</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:black;font-size:14pt;"><strong><span style="font-family:Garamond;">This is Pure and Hygienic in Vedic Dharma(Hinduism)</span><span style="font-family:Old English Text MT;"> =&gt;</span></strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:black;">Also , here a nice method is been prescribed to purify the half-drunk water by Brahamans<em>(Priestly caste people),</em> that’s by pouring down it to the ground , and again now the water is recycled by the <em>“Vedic”</em> method and is pure to be consumed, so here dirty water<em>(as its been pured on the ground which has varying impurities) </em>plus half-drunk<em>(Jootha)</em> water becomes pure, and ready to consume, so this the vedic <em>“Hygiene”</em> and <em>“purity”.</em> So here we learn that saliva flying from mouth , on other is also not impure.</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>

<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><strong>3. No harm in using the water which is infected by dead dogs, menstrual cloths, and body wastes! </strong><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
Sunaan Abu Dawud, Book 1, Number 0067:<br>
Narrated Abu Sa’id al-Khudri: I heard that the people asked the Prophet of Allah (peace_be_upon_him): Water is brought for you from the well of Buda’ah. It is a well in which dead dogs, menstrual clothes and excrement of people are thrown. The Messenger of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) replied: Verily water is pure and is not defiled by anything.<br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
<em>Comments: This explains why Muslim countries are among dirtiest places in world and breed dangerous diseases.</em><br>
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">The hadeeth quoted <span style="color:purple;"><em>(Sunan Abu Dawud, Book 1, no. 67)</em></span> , is talking about a well, unlike well’s found in other parts of world, which are usually human dugged , well bricked ones, here the Hadeeth is talking of a well of Buda’ah, which are not human dug but natural , discovered by man, thesee are usually very huge wells, sought og mini lakes..etc <span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">And this is what the great Islamic Scholar al-Imam <span style="color:blue;">Muhammad Shamsul Haq al-Azeemabaadi</span> commented on this hadeeth saying :<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:right;"><span style="color:red;"><span style="font-family:Bookman Old Style;font-size:10pt;">“Basically this is implying that because the well was so huge, such a small amount of impurities will not ruin the whole well”.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span><span style="font-family:Garamond;"><span style="font-size:12pt;">– </span><span style="font-size:8pt;">[Awn al-Mabud Sharh Sunan Abu Dawud, Kitab: Al Tahara, Bab: Ma Jaa’a Fi Ba’ir Bidaa’a, Commentary on Hadith no.<span style="color:black;"> 60]</span></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">So, its clear that these wells were very huge that small amount of impurities did not make it dirty or impure just like small impurities do not make a lake impure.I also wonder, in India and other countries, people usually bathe in lakes, pond and also wash their kine<em>(like buffalos, cows…etc)</em> , wash clothes and other things and then use the same water from the lake for drinking , this has been done for thousand of years, I guess Agniveer has acknowledged this fact recently.Infactuality Hindus even throw their dead bodies in the river Ganga<em>(considered Holy according to Orthodox Hindus)</em> and then use the same water for drinking, and other throw ashes after burning the dead in rivers, lakes, ponds and then use the same water for drinking, bathing, I’m pretty sure that Agniveer has recently acknowledge and have come to know about this lately. But what of his <em>“Hygienic”</em> Vedic Dharma? <span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">According to the Dharma Shastras too large tanks, aren’t defiled by dead animals and small impurities.<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left:72pt;"><span style="color:#ff9900;"><span style="font-family:Bookman Old Style;font-size:10pt;">” For small reservoirs of water and for ponds the same mode of purification has been prescribed as for wells, O Earth <span style="color:red;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>; but large tanks (excepting Tirthas) are not defiled (by dead animals, &amp;c.)</strong></span> </span></span></span><span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:8pt;">[ ( Vishnu Smriti, Ch-23 , verse 46, pg 103, Translated by Julius Jolly ,Oxford , Clarendon Press 1880]</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">So , its clear that even according to the smritis, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">large tanks are defiles and rendered impure by dead animals and other impure stuffs</span>.This is somehat like shooting in the leg , isn’t it?<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Also it will be informational to hindus to know that their Hindu Vedic Predecessors having beign using these materials<em>(Cow hair,tail, Bones,CowDung,..etc</em>) to mark the boundaries of and lands, farms and terrorities..etc.<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#ff6600;"><span style="font-family:Bookman Old Style;font-size:10pt;">“And as he will see that through men’s ignorance of the boundaries trespasses constantly occur in the world, let him cause to be made other hidden marks for boundaries, <span style="color:red;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Stones, bones, cow’s hair, chaff, ashes, potsherds, dry cowdung, bricks, cinders, pebbles, and sand</strong></span><span style="color:#ff6600;">.”</span></span></span></span><span style="font-family:Garamond;"> <span style="font-size:9pt;">(The Laws Of Manu, Ch 8 verses 149- 150, Translated by George Bühler)</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">So does the Brihaspati Smriti states – <span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:14pt;"><span style="color:#ff6600;"><span style="font-family:Bookman Old Style;font-size:10pt;">“By such visible signs as these a boundary line should always be caused to be marked; also, by other (marks) deposited underground which the earth is not likely to destroy. <span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Dry cowdung, bones, chaff, charcoal, stones, potsherds, sand, bricks, cows tails, cotton seeds, and ashes :”</strong></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>

</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">I wonder, why does Agniveer delve into baseless claims and talks like he did in the comment <span style="color:red;">“<em>Muslim countries are among dirtiest places in world and breed dangerous diseases”</em></span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Well, I guess the above verses prove a lot otherwise! Isn’t it? We read in the above verses that the Vedic predecessors of Hindus, used to bury and throw all type of dirty things like Cow-Dung,Urine ,Cow hairs and tails, broken pots<em>(Potsherds)</em> cinders, ashes and bones on the boundaries and bury them to mark boundaries,now this is polluting the environment which they indulged in, still Agniveer alleges muslim countries of being dirty whereas its clearly proven how dirty the vedic civilisation was, which dumped all their trash on the boundaries under the pretext of marking boundaries and called it hidden marking of boundaries,also I do not understand why these trash had to be used as <em>“hidden”</em> marks? Can’t they use somethig more environment friendly and clean things which did not stink and was pure!<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">I wonder this is enough to show , who were and are dirty, Muslims or Vedic Hindus?Its clear from the preceding verses, and there are many and many such verses , but this should suffice for the Truth seeker, also I would like to request hindus to be more responsible, concerning Cleanliness of the Soceity and environment, as it seems their ancestors totally ignored it, I would be Optimistic and hope that Hindus don’t follow their Vedic Predecessors.<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>

</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt;"><br>
Sahih Bukhari, Volume 1, Book 5, Number 260:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt;"><br>
Narrated Maimuna: The Prophet took the bath of Janaba (sexual relation or wet dream). He first cleaned his private parts with his hand, and then rubbed it (that hand) on the wall and washed it. Then he performed ablution like that for the prayer, and after the bath he washed his feet.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt;"><br>
<em>Comment: The purpose behind defiling the wall needs deep research.</em></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">The hadeeth quoted is <span style="color:purple;"><em>(i.e Saheeh al-Bukhari,vol-1,Book 5, no 260)</em></span> again this is to be noted that the Hadeeth is recorded in the 5<sup>th</sup> Book that is Book of Ghusl or Bathing! All the Hadeeth quoted in this Book are related to Bathing and basically sanitary-related activiites, this does explain things.<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">What here Prophet did was use the dust on the walls <span style="text-decoration:underline;">to rub</span> and clean his hands after he had cleaned his private parts<em>(so that they are cleaned nicely)</em>, that is <span style="text-decoration:underline;">he did not just use water</span> after cleaning hs private parts but also used sand as and cleaning agent, obviosly in those days there weren’t soaps and other cleaning agents available.Again this show how much the Prophet of Mercy was carefull about hygiene and cleanliness, he after cleaning his private parts rubbed his hands with dust as <span style="text-decoration:underline;">soaps and other washing/cleaning agents weren’t available </span>in those times, and then thouroughly wash them with waters.<span style="text-decoration:underline;">The reason why he would rub his hands with dust, sand or soil is to <strong>remove the bad smell</strong> left on the hands</span><em>[this has been expalined/stated by various scholars for instance Shaykh Sayyid Sabiq in Fiqh us-Sunah – at-Taharah wa Salah]</em>, and this again proves the high standard of hygience and cleanliness the prophet followed.Conisely speaking, the reason for using dust,soil <span style="text-decoration:underline;">was to make sure</span> that the hands is thoroughly clean and that there isn’t any bad smell left on the hands which will was very hygienic and impure.<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">And with regards to the hilarious comment by Agniveer <span style="color:red;">“The purpose behind defiling the wall needs deep research.”</span>,<span style="color:red;"><br>
</span>then its quite noteworthy to point here that the preceding hadeeth <span style="color:purple;">(i.e Saheeh al-Bukhari Vo-1, Book 5 no. 259)</span> says :<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:14pt;"><span style="color:purple;font-family:Bookman Old Style;font-size:10pt;">“Then he<em>(Prophet Muhammad)</em> washed his private parts <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>and rubbed his hands on the ground</strong></span>, washed them with water…”</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">The Previous hadeeth<span style="color:purple;"><em>(no. 259)</em></span>, of the one quoted by Agniveer , quite clearly states that he rubbed <span style="text-decoration:underline;">his hands on the ground</span>. The wisdom behind using dust is quite understood I guess, and the reason why prophet Muhammad used the dust from the wall is that he did not find , dust and he used the easily available dust, as cleanliness is quite important in Islam, also a point should be noted that 1400 years ago the houses in Arabia were made of Mud , and the walls were of full of dusts, again here agniveer seems to neglect historical facts, to forward his lies.The walls of those times weren’t plastered with clay or plaster of paris and then emulsioned with colours, as its now, the walls back then were muddy, with dust and and sand on it.<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">I guess its again quite evident that Mr. Plagiarist<em>(Agniveer)</em> hasn’t done any research or exploration, but simply plagiarised from Islamophobic articles, or how is it possible that he would have missed the previous hadeeth of the one he quoted! Also its hilarious and quite funny , when Agniveer talks of <span style="color:red;">“deep research”</span>! Its quite amusing to see Agniveer deceiving his fellow folks<em>(Protestant Hindus)</em> , but I wonder how can he be so fanciful to think he could deceive Muslims?<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Now just have a brief look at Vedic Civilization and Hindu Scriptures and the standard of Hygiene it promotes , I promise Agniveer will be astounded –<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:14pt;text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Earth,Dust are always Pure and are Purifiers according to Hindu Scripture :</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Manav Dharma Shastra or Manu Samhita/Smriti or the Laws of Manu , its stated therein :<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Bookman Old Style;font-size:10pt;"><span style="color:#ff6600;">“<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Land is purified by</span> (the following) five (modes, viz.) <span style="text-decoration:underline;">by</span></span><span style="text-decoration:underline;"> <span style="color:red;">sweeping, by smearing (it with cowdung), by sprinkling (it with cows’ urine or milk), by scraping<span style="color:#ff6600;">, and by cows staying (on it during a day and night).</span></span></span> <span style="color:red;"><strong>“(Food)</strong></span> <span style="color:#ff6600;">which has been pecked at by birds, smelt at by cows, touched (with the foot), sneezed on, or defiled by hair or insects, <span style="color:red;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>becomes pure by scattering earth (over it</strong></span>)</span>. As long as the (foul) smell does not leave an (object) defiled by impure substances, and the stain caused by them (does not disappear), <span style="color:red;">so long must earth and water be applied in cleansing (inanimate) things.”</span></span></span> <span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:9pt;">– (The Laws Of Manu, Ch 5 verses 124- 126, Translated by G.Buhler)</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Now this is an amazing , thing isn’t it what great science ! Scattering earth over food purifies it if its defiled by sneeze of a human or hair or insects! This is <em>“Vedic” </em>Purification and Vedic standard of Purity Agniveer has been talking of.Well , if earth can purify food why can’t it purify body?<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">The quoted verse from the Purana and Manu Smriti and Vishnu Smritit declare dust and earth to be pure and purifier even if it may be contamnated!And the verse quoted from the Laws of Manu(manu Smriti) the last one, talks of putting earth or dust on head when settling the boundaries of terrotories, farms, lands etc. So what is this called? I think a in-depth research needs to be carried out in order to know why , puuting dirt on head is necessary while settling the boundaries of land?Well this is again shooting in the leg, isn’t it<em>(Agniveer has been shooting in his leg from the start of that article, pretty amazing to see it)</em>, I wonder if Agniveer had read what his Vedic Predecessors , especially the Sages have derived from the vedas and what the Manu Smriti said, which is considered the most authentic Dharma Shastra<em>(Hindu law books).</em> Well, we learn from the above quoted verses that Earth and dust are considered to be Pure and purifiers in Hindusim so much that they are to be scattered over the food if the food is defiled and this will render the food pure, amazing vedic science.Still , these Hindus try and concot lies against Islam and inorder to malign the Only true way of life<em>(Deen)</em> that’s Islam.<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Now coming to walls and defiling them which Mr. Plagiarist<em>(Agniveer) </em>talks of in his comment, then here are few exposures –<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>

<p><span style="color:#ff6600;font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size:10pt;"> “This Ayodhya, famed thro’ the three worlds and encircled by sacred groves, appears to-day to have been shorn of its glory and happiness. <span style="color:red;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>The walls are white and have not been smeared with cowdung for some days.</strong></span><span style="color:#ff6600;"> The brahmanas that make this city their home, are masters of the vedas and the vedanta; self-restraint, self-control and other attendant virtues crown them with glory.”</span></span></span></span></p>

</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Well, I guess the above cited sacred Ithihasa book of Ramayana shows , how vedic hindus used to smear and plaster their home with cow-dung, which is still praticed in the rural India, now this is called defiling the wall.Also the floors of hindu houses in rural India are smeared and covered ans palstered by cow-dung , this is an ancient tradition still in pratice.This is <em>“Purification”</em> according to vedic Hindus!Here are few citations which show this so-called Purification tradition in ancient Vedic India and Hindu Scriptures.<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>

<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Again quoting Manu Smriti :<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#ff6600;"><span style="font-family:Bookman Old Style;font-size:10pt;">“Grass, wood, and straw <span style="color:red;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>become pure</strong></span><span style="color:#ff6600;"> by being sprinkled (with water), <span style="color:red;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>a house by sweeping and smearing (it with cowdung or whitewash)</strong></span><span style="color:#ff6600;">, an earthen (vessel) by a second burning.”</span></span></span></span></span></span><br>

</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">So what we read and learn from the above quoted verses is that , smearing, plastering walls , floors with cow-dung is an ancient vedic tradtion which is still prevalent in rural India, and according to Hindu Scriptures purifying a house <span style="text-decoration:underline;">means smearing and flooring it with excreta, well wonderful purification , this is Vedic purification</span>, but in other parts of world its commonly known as filling you house with excreta if I am not wrong.Its really nice to see the <em>“practicality”</em> of Vedic Dharma(Hinduism) .<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>

<p><span style="font-family:Old English Text MT;font-size:14pt;"><strong>Quote :</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt;"><strong>5. Islamic perfume!</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt;"><br>
Ash Shifa (p.35) states that women collected Muhammad’s sweat, because his sweat smelled perfume. Asha Shifa continues:</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt;"><br>
The messenger of Allah slept on a rug in the house of Anas and perspired. <strong>Anas’s mother brought a long necked bottle in which to put his sweat</strong>. The Messenger of Allah asked her about this she said, “We put it in our perfume and it is the most fragrant of scents.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Here , the Book quoted is <span style="color:blue;">Ash-Shifa</span> by <span style="color:blue;">al-Qâdî `Iyâd</span>, the issue with this book has been earlier explained , this book is well-known to be filled with fabrications and false fabricated ahadeeth<em>(Narrations),</em> to say firstly.As now coming to issue of using the sweat of prophet and mixing it then its again plainly a miralce which the people duringg those times witnessed, which is historically indeniable fact.<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Now its to be noted that the people were eager to use the sweat of prophet and did so mostly without his knowledge for example its been narrated in Saheeh al-Bukhari :<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:14pt;"><span style="color:purple;"><span style="font-family:Bookman Old Style;font-size:10pt;">“Um Sulaim used to spread a leather sheet for the Prophet and he used to take a midday nap on that leather sheet at her home.” And <span style="color:red;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>“When the Prophet had slept</strong></span><span style="color:purple;">, she would take some of his sweat and hair and collect it (the sweat) in a bottle and then mix it with Suk (a kind of perfume) <span style="color:red;"><strong>while he was still sleeping</strong><span style="color:purple;">.”</span></span></span></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">So its to noted , that his fragrant sweat was used, when he was sleeping, and that this is a miracle which humans present at that time had witnessed, its again a proof how a messenger of the Almighty Allâh Azz wa Jall<em>(One True God)</em> , is blessed.<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Also , I don’t understand why does Agniveeer have problem with this, that is the love and respect the final Prophet Muhammad received from the people and the Miracles he was given by Allâh Azz wa Jall .When the human written vedas<em>(Hindu Scriptures)</em> holded as <em>“Holy”</em> by Hindus and Protestant Hindus declare Cows to be <span style="color:red;"><strong>“Protectors”</strong></span> of Earth and the Heaven.<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span><span style="font-size:8pt;"><em>(Yajurveda Ch 33 verse 19,See my refutation of Main point 2 for the full reference)</em><br>
</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">So whats the problem? Its hard to fathom that while the hindu scriptures declare cow to be <em>“protector”</em> of heaven and earth, a hindu is criticising Islam because the final Prophet for the whole Human-kind Muhammad came with miracles , and that his sweat was full of fragrance, which was used with perfume.<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">I wonder why hindus can have incoherent and irrational beliefs like <span style="text-decoration:underline;">cows being protectors of the earth and heaven</span>, and that <span style="text-decoration:underline;">cows,horses and goats possess the qualities of sun</span> and <span style="text-decoration:underline;">cow- ordure and urine are tranquillity and prosperity, and that being covered in Cow-dung and urine is beautiful </span>..etc. Then why cannot the extremely rational and coherent belief of Muslims that the Prophet of Mercy Muhammad had many Miracles and that his sweat was miraculously full of fragrance, which is also is a historical fact witnessed by people.Why cannot the God Almighty <em>(Allâh Azz wa Jall)</em> give his prophets miracles? Especially when he’s the final prophet for the guidance of Human-Kind. Or is it that according to Hindus and Protestant Hindus God is incapable of providing miracles? So is that the Hindu belief about and his capabilities God? <span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Also it would be worthy to quote Mahabharata , wherein its ordered never to have repugnance toward excreta of cow,and should take the names of cow whenever you had a bad dream.<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:14pt;"><span style="color:red;"><span style="font-family:Bookman Old Style;font-size:10pt;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>“One should never feel any <span style="color:green;">repugnance<span style="color:red;"> for the urine and the dung of the cow.</span></span></strong></span><span style="color:#ff6600;"> One should never eat the flesh of kine. As the consequence of this, one is sure to attain to great prosperity. One should always take the names of kine. One should never show any disregard for kine in any way. If evil dreams are seen, men should take the names of kine.”</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:14pt;"><span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:9pt;">– [The Mahabharata , Book 13: Anusasana Parva, <span style="color:black;">Part 2<strong><em><br>

</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Well, I would really like to know , why is it that cow’s excreta shouldn’t been shown any repugnance,whereas the miraculous sweat which was fragrant of the prophet deemed as impure ? This is again, simply the bias of an hindu which keeps them away from truth.<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:black;"><strong>Now few questions clearly arise</strong>, they are 1) <span style="text-decoration:underline;">why do Hindus deem cows as protectors</span>, and that 2) they<em> (cows)</em> possess qualities of sun as stated in Veda, also 3) why is it that babies covered in mud mixed with cow-dung and urine look beautiful and 4) why is it that none should have any repugnance and aversion for cow-dung and urine?<em> (See my refutation of Main point 2 for the full references of all.)</em></span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:black;"> I would really like to know , when cows can be protectors of earth and heaven, and then cow ordure shouldn’t been shown any aversion then , why is the so-called “Islamic Perfume” considered by these protestant Hindu ir-rationalist’s as something’s “filthy” dirty? What are the reasons for it? Well, its been recorded that his <em>(Muhammad) </em>sweat had beautiful fragrance , which is a historically true, so comparing this fragrant sweat and cow ordure, urine is like likening dust and diamond. Also, I would like to briefly educate few, about sources of Perfumes, there are many sources of perfumes, like flora (plant) sources in which bark, seeds, leaves…etc. are used to make perfumes and the sources which I would like people to learn about is <strong>Animal Sources</strong> (Fauna), it seems Agniveer is unaware that thousands of perfumes available today in various markets, have various ingredients and many have faunal sources!</span><br>
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:black;">The few ingredients (sources) used in, perfume making are:</span><br>

</span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:black;">So, we learn that perfumes are made from various sources, and “excrement” of animals is one of them, also fatty compounds expelled from sperm of whale is used to make perfumes, well these are facts should be extinguisher for Agniveer’s ignorance and bias, as he seems to be unaware of simple and well-known things, it’s also interesting to mention that many perfumes also contain alcohol.</span><br>
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:black;">It’s quite, understood that either Mr. Plagiarist <em>(Agniveer)</em> was unknown of these facts of just hypocritically playing around and maligning Islam. So when perfumes can contain such things which help make them better then why not the sweat of Muhammad which was well-known to be fragrant! Well, if sweat of the Prophet (Muhammad) is considered dirty, where as it was fragrant then what about these perfumes? So are these excrement based perfume pure and clean? If not so why don’t I see Agniveer criticising it on his hilarious and non-Scholastic website? Silence is generally considered to be affirmation. Muslims believe that the Prophets sweat was fragrant and people even mixed it with perfume and used it, certain questions arise, 1) how was prophet’s perfume fragrant? And a simple answer to it is that this was a blessing of Allah<em> (the Only One True God)</em>, and cannot the Almighty God give his messengers certain provisions like this? Why not? Well at least Allah Azz wa Jall can <em>(the Only One True God), </em>as he is omnipotent and every-Merciful. The only problem is with the perception of God of Protestant Hindus, may be their so-called God is believed to be weak who cannot grant or bless people in such a way. </span><br>
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:black;"><strong>Rationally, the use of sweat of prophet is justified. When today people use things like “excreta”, alcohol etc. then why not the sweat of the prophet which was inherently fragrant. And only a bias person can allege Islam, with regard to this.</strong></span><br>
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:18pt;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:black;">Concisely putting it, the quotation provided by Agniveer only prove the miraculous nature of the final Prophet and the irrational, illogical beliefs of Hindus and their biased nature which tends to be whimsically inclined to follow falsehood. <em>[See other sections where drinking, bathing, and using Cow Urine and Ordure are permitted in Hindu Scriptures, people will be amazed at the double-standards of Hindus]</em></span><br>

Narrated Abu Huraira: That once he was in the, company of the Prophet carrying a water pot for his ablution and for cleaning his private parts. While he was following him carrying it(i.e. the pot), the Prophet said, “Who is this?” He said, “I am Abu Huraira.” The Prophet said, “<strong>Bring me stones in order to clean my private parts</strong>, and do not bring any bones or animal dung.” Abu Huraira went on narrating: So I brought some stones, carrying them in the corner of my robe till I put them by his side and went away. When he finished, I walked with him and asked, “What about the bone and the animal dung?” He said, “They are of the food of Jinns. The delegate of Jinns of (the city of) Nasibin came to me−−and how nice those Jinns were−−and asked me for the remains of the human food. I invoked Allah for them that they would never pass by a bone or animal dung but find food on them.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>

<em>Comment: We researched a lot, but find no Islamic Research Foundation (IRF) explaing the mystery behind cleaning private parts with stones, and that too with odd number of stones only. We request our Islamic scientists to unravel the practicality behind this custom.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">The first Ahadeeth quoted is <span style="color:purple;"><em>(Saheeh al-Bukharee, vol-4,Book 1, no 162)</em></span>and the other one which is only cited but not quoted is <span style="color:purple;">(no.63) <span style="color:black;">, here I quote both the hadeeth in full.First no. 62 then 63 respectively.</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:14pt;"><span style="color:purple;font-family:Bookman Old Style;font-size:10pt;">Narrated Abu Huraira: The Prophet said, “Whoever performs ablution should clean his nose with water by putting the water in it and then blowing it out, and whoever cleans his private parts with stones should do it with odd number of stones.” </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:14pt;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">And the next hadeeth , that is no 63 –<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:14pt;"><span style="color:purple;"><span style="font-family:Bookman Old Style;font-size:10pt;">Narrated Abu Huraira: Allâh’s Apostle said, “If anyone of you performs ablution he should put water in his nose and then blow it out and whoever cleans his private parts with stones should do so with odd numbers. <span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;">And whoever wakes up from his sleep should wash his hands before putting them in the water for ablution, because nobody knows where his hands were during sleep.” </span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">The Hadeeth <span style="color:purple;">no. 63</span> is only cited and not quoted<em>(on purpose to hide the great standards of prophets hygiene)</em> , as this hadeeth clearly shows how hygienic the prophet was, it clearly lays emphasis on washing your hands before, putting them in water as while a person is asleep he doesn’t not know where his hands were, meaning he could have touched his private parts or other areas which could lead in polluting the water , hence he ordered that people should wash their hands before putting them in water.Also we see Prophet Muhammad teaching people to clean their nose thoroughly during ablution , all these facts only proove how hygienic the prophet of mercy Muhammad<em>(Sallal lahu alayhi wa sallam) </em>was.<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Now coming to the next hadeeth quoted, it is <span style="color:purple;"><em>(Saheeh al-Bukhari vol-58 Book 5, no.200)</em><br>
</span>here’s the full text of the hadeeth :<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:14pt;"><span style="color:purple;font-family:Bookman Old Style;font-size:10pt;">Narrated Abu Huraira: That once he was in the, company of the Prophet carrying a water pot for his ablution and for cleaning his private parts. While he was following him carrying it(i.e. the pot), the Prophet said, “Who is this?” He said, “I am Abu Huraira.” The Prophet said, <strong>“Bring me stones in order to clean my private parts</strong>, and do not bring any bones or animal dung.” Abu Huraira went on narrating: So I brought some stones, carrying them in the corner of my robe till I put them by his side and went away. When he finished, I walked with him and asked, “What about the bone and the animal dung?” He said, “They are of the food of Jinns. The delegate of Jinns of (the city of) Nasibin came to me–and how nice those Jinns were–and asked me for the remains of the human food. I invoked Allâh for them that they would never pass by a bone or animal dung but find food on them.” </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">All the ahadeeth quoted his this section are quite self-explanatory and easily understandable, I don’t find a reason for any problem,as for the questions raised on usage of stones then let me explain it to the people in simple terms.<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">The reason why prophet Muhammad asked for stone while Abu Hurairah was carrying a water pot is, to teach people that even without water its possible to get oneself cleaned.<span style="text-decoration:underline;">This was purely for the educative purpose</span>, as we all know that Arabia is an desert peninsula where people hardly have<em>(and had)</em> water to drink , its only at times when you have water to clean your self or use while lavation.Hence during such times when water is unavailable clean stone could be used as they will help you clean yourself after urinating and discharge of ordure.<span style="text-decoration:underline;">This showed and informed people another clean way of cleaning themselves, hence it was purely for educative purposes.</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Secondly, its to be noted that stones are only recommended to use when <strong>you don’t have water</strong> for cleansing purpose</span>.As back then there were no toilet-papers! Again we see Agniveer neglecting historical facts! So if you don’t have water and no toilet-paper or any medium of cleansing your self , what will you do? I hope you don’t come out without cleaning yourself! The only way out is using stones,pebbles…etc which are easily available.<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Again we read Agniveer in his fanciful and hilarious comments asking IRF<em>[(Islamic Research Foundation)an foundation/institute runned by few studnets of knowledge]</em> to explain the so-called mystery of cleaning private parts with stones, I think if Agniveer had used little of his brain and tried to think, or an easy way out was reasearching about it, I am pretty sure that he would have received the answer to the question he had which he now claims to be a mystery, I would like to question Agniveer whether he even knows the meaning of the word <em>“mystery”</em> ? Well, it seems Agniveer hates reserching, this is what is apparent from his articles.<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Now coming to the question of using odd number of stones then it was an <em>advice/recommendation</em> of the prophet of mercy, to the people in order to limit people in using stones , for instance he recommended using odd number of stones that is either 1,3,5..etc this was clearly done so that people only use as much they need ,like if they are able to cleanse themselves with <em>“one”</em> stone thoroughly then use one or if not one then three which is enough. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">The sublime wisdom behind this recommendation was to teach people to be frugal in every matter and limit using stone as per need,</span><br>
<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Also its noteworthy to point out that this was a recommendation, whereas a human is free to use as many number of stones he wishes , except that he shouldn’t be extravagant but be frugal.<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">And and prophet of mercy himself used varying number of stones for instance in <span style="color:purple;"><em>(Saheeh al-Bukhari vol-4 Book 1, no 157)</em></span> The Prophet said</span><span style="font-family:Bookman Old Style;font-size:10pt;"><br>
<span style="color:purple;">“Fetch for me some stones for ‘ cleaning the privates parts</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">…” <span style="text-decoration:underline;">without specifying any numbers or asking odd numbers of stones</span>.Also in another hadeeth the Prophet said to have used 2 stones for cleaning<span style="color:purple;">(no.158</span>).So this shows that using Odd numbers of stones like 1,3,5…etc is recommended as we muslims love the Pure Islamic Monotheism. <span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Now its time to learn about the so-called Vedic Hygiene and standard of Purification which Agniveer , is pompous about, and scrutinise truth.<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:14pt;text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Usage of Earth, soil for cleaning of Private Parts in Hindu Scriptures :</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left:14pt;"><span style="color:red;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">“In order to cleanse (the organs) by which urine and faeces are ejected<span style="color:#ff6600;"><strong>, <span style="color:red;">earth and water must be used</span></strong></span></span><span style="color:#ff6600;">, as they may be required, likewise in removing the (remaining ones among) twelve impurities of the body”</span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:10pt;"> -( The Laws of Manu, Ch 5 verse 134, Translated by George Bühler)</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Using of earth and water to cleanse the urinary and other defecating Organ, is prescribed by Manu Smriti in the above verse.And below is a little detailed desccription of this act of using earth to clean your private parts.<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:14pt;"><span style="color:#ff6600;"><span style="font-family:Bookman Old Style;font-size:10pt;">“He who desires to be <span style="color:red;">pure<span style="color:#ff6600;">, <span style="color:red;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>must clean the organ by one (application of) earth, the anus by (applying earth) three (times)</strong></span><span style="color:#ff6600;">, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">the (left) hand alone by (applying it) ten (times), and both (hands) by (applying it) seven (times).</span> Such is the purification ordained for <span style="color:red;"><strong>householders</strong><span style="color:#ff6600;">; (it shall be) <span style="color:red;"><strong>double for students</strong>, <strong>treble for hermits</strong><span style="color:#ff6600;">, but <span style="color:red;"><strong>quadruple for ascetics</strong><span style="color:#ff6600;">.”</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Bookman Old Style;"><br>
</span><span style="font-family:Garamond;">-( The Laws of Manu, Ch 5 verses 136-137, Translated by George Bühler)</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">So we read from the above verse that using earth/soil/sand to clean your urinary Organ and then the anus 3 times, then by left hand alone 10 times and then using <span style="text-decoration:underline;">BOTH</span> the hands seven times and this is the so-called <em>“purification”</em> and this is for householders where as students have to perform this process double time, hermits treble and ascetics quadruple times , well may I ask why is this inchorent way of “purifying” prescribed in ascending order , and what is the crime of petty students,hermits and ascetics that they have been burdened with such hectic,incoherent way of <em>“purification”</em> I am sure that the Protestant Hindus will have an scientific answer for this too!Its to be noted that here soil is applied the number of times specified, well I am sure Agniveer was unaware of this isn’t it?<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Now here’s another quote from a Upa-Purana which helps us understand the issue more clearly and gives a clear picture of purification in Vedic Dharma<em>(Hinduism)-</em><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:14pt;"><span style="color:#ff6600;"><span style="font-family:Bookman Old Style;">“Then he is to hold his genital organ with his hand and go to a river or any other watery place ; he is to fill his vessel with water then and go to some other place</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">.</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><br>
</span><span style="color:#ff6600;"><span style="font-family:Bookman Old Style;">The <span style="color:red;"><strong>Brahmana</strong><span style="color:#ff6600;"> is to use the <span style="color:red;"><strong>white earth</strong><span style="color:#ff6600;">, the <span style="color:red;"><strong>Ksattriya</strong><span style="color:#ff6600;"> is to take the <span style="color:red;"><strong>red earth</strong><span style="color:#ff6600;">, the <span style="color:red;"><strong>Vais’ya</strong><span style="color:#ff6600;"> is to use the <span style="color:red;"><strong>yellow earth</strong><span style="color:#ff6600;"> and the <span style="color:red;"><strong>Sudra</strong><span style="color:#ff6600;"> is to apply the <span style="color:red;"><strong>black earth</strong><span style="color:#ff6600;"> and with that he is to <span style="color:red;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">cleanse himself</span><span style="color:#ff6600;">. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">The earth under water, the earth of any temple, the earth of an anthill, the earth of a mouse hole, and the remmant of the earth used by another body for washing are not to bo used for cleansing purposes.</span><br>
<span style="color:red;"><strong>The earth for cleansing faeces is twice as much as that used in case of urine clearance ; in the cleansing after sexual intercourse thrice as much</strong><span style="color:#ff6600;">. In urine cleansing the earth is to applied in the organ of generation once, thrice in the hand. And in dirt clearing, twice in the organ of generation, five times in anus, ten times in the left hand and seven times in both the hands. Then apply earth four times first in the left feet and then on the right feet The house holder should clear thus : the Brahmachari is to do twice and the Yatis tour times. At every time the quantity of wet earth that is to bo taken is to be of the size of an Amalaki fruit ; never it is to be less than that. This is for the clearance in the day time. Half of these can be used in the night time… If, out of vanity or sloth, clearing be not done, for three nights, one is to fast,drinking water only, and then to repeat the Gayatri Mantra and thus be purified.”</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">What the above quote states is :<br>
</span></p>
<p style="margin-left:36pt;"><span style="font-family:Wingdings;font-size:12pt;"></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:7pt;">  </span><span style="font-family:Bookman Old Style;">A Brahmana<em>(Priestly caste ) </em>should use white earth.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>

<p style="margin-left:36pt;"><span style="font-family:Wingdings;font-size:12pt;"></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:7pt;">  </span><span style="font-family:Bookman Old Style;">A Shudra<em>(Servant , low caste)</em>should use black earth.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Bookman Old Style;"> Different type of soil/earth to be used by different caste people ,for Cleansing their private parts.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">The following types of earth/sand/soil are forbidden to use :<br>

</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">And the above quote gives a various numbers , of amount time this process is to be done and the amount of Mud/earth to be used and all the other detail , I hope this will really be helful to the hindus!.Basically this quote ,from Devi Upa-Purana and the 2 earlier quotes from Manu Smriti, clearly show the extensive use od Mud/Earth used for cleansing purpose which is prescribed in a very extravagant way.<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">I would like to query , what is the rational wisdom behind this incoherent use of earth/Mud/dirt used for cleaning purpose, that to so extensively extravagantly? I find no rational or scientific basis for such practices.I hope that Protestant Hindus clarify why their Vedic ancestors prescribed such practices and performed them.And its quite amazing to find these hindus criticising Islam and its rational concepts of purification when their own scriptures are fanciful, incoherent and irrational.<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>

<p><span style="font-family:Old English Text MT;font-size:14pt;"><strong>Quote :</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt;"><strong>7. It is permissible to eat without washing hand after coming out of privy (lavatory)!</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt;"><br>
Muslim, Book 3, Number 0725:<br>
Ibn ‘Abbas reported: The Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) came out of the privy, and he was presented with some food, and the people reminded him about ablution, but he said: Am I to say prayer that I should perform ablution ?</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>

<p><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt;"><br>
Book 3, Number 0726:<br>
Ibn ‘Abbas reported: We were with the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) and he had come out of the privy. Food was presented to him. It was said to him (by the Companions around him) : Wouldn’t you perform ablution? Upon this he said: Why, am I to say prayer that I should perform ablution ?</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt;"><br>

Ibn ‘Abbas reported: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) went to the privy and when he came back, he was presented with food. It was said to him; Messenger of Allah, wouldn’t you perform ablution. He said : Why, am I to say prayer?</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt;"><br>
Book 3, Number 0728:<br>
Ibn Abbas, reported: The Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) came out of the privy after relieving himself, and food was brought to him and he took it, and did not touch water. In another narration transmitted by Sa’id b. al-Huwairith it is like this: It was said to the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) You have not performed ablution. He said: I do not intend to say prayer that I should perform ablution.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt;"><br>
<em>Comments: This explains why many Hindus used to avoid touching Muslims till recently. This has nothing to do with their ideology, but only relates to their hygiene habits which does not require one to wash hands even after excretion. Many sanitized people may vomit even on imagining such a thing. Hindu texts, on contrary, advise for highest levels of adherence to sanitized habits, and this remains a common bond across almost all sects of Hinduism.</em></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt;"><br>
<em>But are we expecting another fatwa from IRF or Deoband that Muslims are prohibited from washing hands after lavatory, especially when they plan to have food! After all their Prophet used to do so!</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">This section or main point is the most ridiculous and hilarious of all the sections from the article , I just don’t get how fanciful and imaginative and conjecturable Agniveer is, this section will expose Agniveer and his decpetion, I would really want Hindus and protestant Hindus to see their polemics , deceptive and lying nature and its wonder they call themselves <em>“Arya-Samaj” (Noble Society)</em> but infactuality they are <em>“Anarya-Samaj”</em><br>
<em>(Ignoble Society)</em> which has always indulged in lies and deception and all the immoral acts.<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Coming to the topic Agniveer, alleges that Islam premits eating without washing hands and that too, after coming out of privy<em>(lavatory,loo)</em>, this only exposes his gross ignorance and illiteracy of Islam.All the hadeeth he quotes <span style="color:purple;"><em>(i.e.Saheeh Muslim, Book 3,Ch 30 ,nos.725,726,727,728)</em>.</span><br>
<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Let me take this as an Oppurtunity to educate Agniveer and his fellow Protestant Hindus, about Islam and expose the ridiculous allegations of Agniveer.<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Let me first explain what does the word <em>“Ablution”</em> means! <span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:14pt;"><strong>Arabic language:</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><strong><em>“Wudhoo” </em></strong>is the action and <strong><em>“Wadoo”</em></strong> the water used therefore – and it is also a verbal noun; or they are two forms of the same word, both meaning the verbal-noun and maybe both referring also to the water used.<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:14pt;text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Wudhoo(Ablution) in the Sharee’ah(Islam) :</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><strong><em>“Wudhoo”</em>(Ablution)</strong> is using clean and cleansing <em>(Tuhoor)</em><br>
<span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;"><strong>water upon certain body parts </strong></span>as Allaah Ta’aala<em>(One True Almighty God)</em> has prescribed and explained.<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">What Agniveer has done here , is to deceive people into believing that Ablution<em>(Wudhoo)</em> simply means washing hands! <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Whereas Ablution<em>(Wudhoo)</em> in Islam is a ritual cleansing of certain body parts before praying and touching or reading the noble,holy Qur’aan</span>.All the 3 ahadeeth he’s quoted refer to the ritual cleansing of certain body parts<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong><em>(in short ,hands,face,mouth,nose,forearms up to elbow,head, ears, nape and the feets)</em></strong><br>
</span>done before praying, its quite nonsensical of him to consider ritual ablution meaning washing of hands!In all the ahadeeth above the prophet is explaining the companions and people that you need not perform ablution before eating, as they thought it was necessary.<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Ritual ablution(Wudhoo) is needed when you’re to pray or touch, read the noble,holy Qur’aan.Its not mandatory to do the ritual ablution(Wudhoo) for eating, you have to wash your hands thoroughly as it was the practice of Prophet Muhammad<em>(Sallal lahu alayhi wa sallam)</em><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">It is related by <span style="color:blue;">Sunan Al-Nasa’i</span> that the <span style="color:maroon;">Prophet Muhammad</span><em> (Sallal lahu alayhi wa sallam)</em></span><span style="font-family:Arial Black;"><strong><br>
<span style="color:fuchsia;">“<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Used to wash his hands whenever he wanted to eat</span>“</span></strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">And the <span style="color:maroon;">prophet</span> also said :</span><span style="color:purple;"><span style="font-family:Bookman Old Style;"><strong> “Whoever goes to sleep <span style="color:red;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">without washing his hands</span><span style="color:purple;"> from the traces of fatty foods, exposes himself to illness and should blame no one but himself.”</span></span></strong><span style="color:#009900;"><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span><span style="font-size:8pt;">– </span></span></span><span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:8pt;">[Abu Dawud (No.3852), Al-Tirmidhi (No.1861), Ibn Majah (No.3267)]</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">So we see that the noble prophet, always <span style="text-decoration:underline;">washed his hands before and after eating</span> thoroughly and cautioned people about it.I think this debunks all the allegations and lies of Agniveer.<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Regarding the washing of hands after coming out of privy then in Islam its mandatory</span>, and earlier in this refutation there many hadeeth where prophet Muhammad himself is described rubbing hands with soil inorder to get rid of bad<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span>smell,if any<em>(as in those days soaps… etc weren’t available) </em>and then washing the hands thoroughly with water. It’s a pity that Agniveer first quotes<em>(in section or mainpoint 4)</em> Prophet Muhammad washing his hands thoroughly after relieving himself, and later in his article<em>(here in section 7)</em> healleges that its permissible in Islam if you don’t wash your hands after relieving yourself, what a pity!This confused ,self-contradictory Protestant hindu even lacks the basic skills , and here he is alleging Islam with his funny, fanciful, whims.<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Concludingly,in<span style="text-decoration:underline;"> Islam its mandatory to wash your hands before and after eating and also ,after relieving oneself.Whereas ritual ablution<em>(Wudhoo)</em> is mandatory for touching,reading the holy Qur’an and for praying.I hope the readers have understood the difference between Ablution<em>(Wudhoo)</em> and washing of hands which agniveer deceitfully implies to be same thing, how ignorant of him.Whereas the hadeeth</span><span style="color:purple;"><em>(i.e. Saheeh al-Bukharee, Volume 1, Book 5, Number 260)</em></span>,<span style="text-decoration:underline;"> which he himself quotes in <span style="color:red;">section 4 clearly distinguishes between washing of hands and Ablution.</span></span> This should be enough for any truth seeker and readers, in recognising the deception of this Protestant Hindu,Agniveer.<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Agniveer again in a hilarious manner comments <span style="color:red;">“Hindu texts, on contrary, advise for highest levels of adherence to sanitized habits, and this remains a common bond across <span style="text-decoration:underline;">almost all sects of Hinduism</span>.”</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Let’s scrutinise the claims of this confused protestant hindu, and show our readers the truth of the matter.First lets see the hindu ablution.<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:14pt;text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Here is what a Hindu is supposed to do , <span style="color:red;">if while eating</span>, impure things like <span style="color:#339966;"><em>“semen</em>“,</span><br>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">The same <span style="color:blue;">Gautama Smriti</span> also states that if a person becomes impure while holding something in his hands, he will become pure just by sipping water, without putting the material on the ground.<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>

</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">So all these texts clearly prescribe that, sipping of water without cleaning of the the impurity like urine, faeces and semen will render you pure.Also this is done while eating , I am pretty sure that anyone who hears such a thing will vomit and would feel unhealthy,forget doing this , it can only done by the so-called <em>“hygienic Hindus”</em> like the protestant hindus<em>(Arya Samajis)</em> isn’t it, this is the vedic method of purification.This sipping of water is also done by the Protestant Hindus, during Sandhya while reciting the mantra<em>(chants,verses</em>) from vedas like yajurveda..etcAnd in his comments Agniveer stated <span style="color:red;">“Hindu texts, on contrary, advise for highest levels of adherence to sanitized habits” </span>which is followed by all the sects in Hinduism <span style="text-decoration:underline;">so this is the high sanitised standard</span> which the Hindu texts advise and prescribe, I wonder if this is even seen as sanitised or not, as all around the world this will simply be labeled as filthy and unhygienic way of purification and eating habits.And this is why clean individuals like to stay away from hindus and their sacrifices and ceremonies , atleast those who didn’t knew will from now on will.There are many such verses a few which we have seen till know through out the article, but I think this will suffice any unbiased truth seeker,I hope that the truth seeker and our readers have seen a glimpse of hindu standards of hygiene and sanitation.<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>

<p><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt;"><br>
If one has seminal emission, but has to perform prayers, and finds no water, what do you do? Simple, strike ground with hands and then wipe face and palms! Refer to the SAHIH MUSLIM hadith given below:</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt;"><br>
Book 3, Number 0716:<br>
Abu Musa said to Abdullah: You have not heard the words of ‘Ammar: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) sent me on an errand and I had a seminal emission, but could find no water, and rolled myself in dust just as a beast rolls itself. I came to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) then and made a mention of that to him and he (the Holy Prophet) said: It would have been enough for you to do this. Then he struck the ground with his hands once and wiped his right hand with the <span style="color:blue;">help</span> of his left hand and the exterior of his palms and his face. ‘Abdullah said: Didn’t you see that Umar was not fully satisfied with the words of ‘Ammar only?</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt;"><br>
<em><strong>Comment: Doubt on this practical science of Hygiene –</strong> After hands have already become dirty after the emission and rubbing dust, why make face dirty now? Or is it used as a face-cleansing cream? Why not simply spare the face from seminal emission and dust?</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">The hadeeth quote by Mr.Plagiarist<em>(Agniveer) </em>is <span style="color:purple;"><em>(Saheeh Muslim,Book 3, no. 716</em>)</span> this is a huge hadeeth ,and Mr.Plagiarist has only quoted a part of it excluding the rest of the hadith this again, shows his evil intention and action of quoting out of context and misinterpreting the text.<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Here is the full hadeeth :<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:14pt;"><span style="color:purple;"><span style="font-family:Bookman Old Style;font-size:10pt;">Shaqiq reported: I was sitting in the company of Abdullah and Abu Musa when Abu Musa said: O ‘Abd al−Rahman (kunya of ‘Abdullah b. Mas’ud), <span style="color:red;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">what would you like a man to do about the prayer if he experiences a seminal emission or has sexual intercourse but <strong>does not find water for a month</strong></span><span style="color:purple;">? ‘Abdullah said: He should not perform tayammum even if he does not find water for a month. ‘Abdullah said: Then what about the verse in Sura Ma’ida:” <span style="color:#99cc00;">If you do not find water, betake yourself to clean dust”<span style="color:purple;">? ‘Abdullah said: If they were granted concession on the basis of this verse, there is a possibility that they would perform <strong>tayammum</strong> with dust on finding water very cold for themselves. Abu Musa said to Abdullah: You have not heard the words of ‘Ammar: The Messenger of Allâh (may peace be upon him) sent me on an errand and I had a seminal emission, but could find no water, and rolled myself in dust just as a beast rolls itself. I came to the Messenger of Allâh (may peace be upon him) then and made a mention of that to him and he (the Holy Prophet) said: It would have been enough for you to do thus. Then he struck the ground with his hands once and wiped his right hand with the help of his left hand and the exterior of his palms and his face. ‘Abdullah said: Didn’t you see that Umar was not fully satisfied with the words of ‘Ammar only?</span></span></span></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Firstly,its to be noted that the hadeeth is clearly <span style="text-decoration:underline;">talking of a situation when there is no water available, and that too for more than a month</span>! And here is the mercy from the Almighty Allâh Azz wa Jall<em>(One True God),</em> that Tayammum<em>(Dry Ablution)</em> is legislated for us, so as to help us be pure and even when water is unavailable.Analysing the hadeeth quoted , we find that rolling yourself up in clean dust is not permissible, and but what is permissible is the dry Ablution, and here is a brief expounding on it.<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:Garamond;"><strong>Dry Ablution in Islam :</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Literally <strong>“Tayammum”</strong> means <strong><em>“aim, purpose”</em><br>
</strong>and in Islamic law it means<strong><br>
<em>“aiming for or seeking soil (clean dust) to wipe ones face and hands with the intention of preparing oneself to pray and son on”</em></strong><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">And this dry ablution is been permitted by Allâh the most merciful in his noble Qur’aan:<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:14pt;"><span style="color:#99cc00;font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:Garamond;"><strong>“O you who believe! When you intend to offer As-Salât (the prayer), wash your faces and your hands (forearms) up to the elbows, rub (by passing wet hands over) your heads, and (wash) your feet up to the ankles. <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>If you are in a state of Janâba (i.e. after a sexual discharge), purify yourselves (bathe your whole body). But if you are ill or on a journey, or any of you comes from the Ghâ’it (toilet), or you have been in contact with women (i.e. sexual intercourse), and you <span style="color:olive;">find no water<span style="color:#99cc00;">, then perform Tayammum with clean earth and rub therewith your faces and hands. <span style="color:olive;">Allâh does not want to place you in difficulty<span style="color:#99cc00;">, but <span style="color:olive;">He wants to purify you</span></span></span></span></span></em></span><span style="color:#99cc00;">, and to complete His Favour to you that you may be thankful.”</span></strong></span></span><br>

<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">And this verse from the holy, noble Qur’aan makes it<em>(Dry Ablution)</em> pemissible for muslims to use clean dust, which is indeed a mercy for the human-kind, so as to make easy for them the spiritual and other purification.<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>

</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">We learn that striking your hands<em>(till wrist not forearm)</em> on the ground, then blowing-off the dust from the hands and then wiping your face and hands upto-elbow is know as <em>“Dry ablution</em>“, this is the method performing it.<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>

</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Dry Ablution is only permissible in certain situations</span> some are stated above in the Qur’aanic verse <span style="text-decoration:underline;">like on being ill wherein using water could severe your illness or cause death</span>, or on a <span style="text-decoration:underline;">journey where you don’t have water</span>.Or due to extreme cold weather<em>(you fear death due to it or fatal sickness)</em>Or to save water for drinking<em>(fearing you go thirsty..etc)</em> due to its unavailablitiy like Imam Ahmad said <em>“Many companions performed dry ablution to save their water for drinking”</em><br>
<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">As for the inability to use water due to an illness or an extreme cold weather, one should bear in mind that the fear for one’s health must be certain and not imaginary. The illness that entitles one to perform dry ablution as that which might add to one’s physical <em>(health related) </em>injury. However, it does not necessarily mean that it has to be a near fatal illness. When dry Ablution is done because of extreme cold weather, it is allowed only when water may not be warmed up. In present times, hot water is readily available, nonetheless even if due to some reason one is unable to find heated water or heat water for use, he may resort to dry ablution, due to the danger to life.And here is what the great Islamic Scholars has to say in regards to it.<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Garamond;"><strong>Ash-Shaykh Abd al-Azeez Ibn Bâz said :</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:14pt;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:blue;">“If you can find warm water or you are able to heat the cold water, or you can buy water from your neighbor or from someone else, then you must use that . . . <span style="text-decoration:underline;">you have to do whatever you can</span>, whether buying the water, heating it or whatever ways will enable you to do ablution<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>(Wudhoo)</em></span> as prescribed with water. If you are unable to do that and the cold is severe and is posing a danger to you, and there is no way for you to heat it or to buy some warm water from those who are around you, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">then you are excused, and dry ablution is sufficient</span> for you…”</span><br>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:14pt;text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Tayammum(dry ablution) a life saver :</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:14pt;"><span style="color:purple;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">Jâbir narrated :”We set out on a journey, and one of us was wounded by a stone on his head. [When he slept,] he had a wet dream, and so he asked his companions, ‘Do you see any concession for me to perform tayammum?’ They replied: ‘We do not see any concession since you are able to use water.’ Upon that, he took bath and died. When we came back to Allâh’s Messenger <em>(Sallal lahu alayhi wa Sallam),</em> he was informed of that. He said …It would have been enough for him to perform tayammum, or bandage his wound, wipe over the bandage and bathe the rest of his body.” </span><span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:9pt;">– (Sunan Abu Dâwud)</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">And we learn from the above hadeeth that Tayammum could have saved this persons life as in many countries<em>(cold)</em> bathing in old days was quite dangers due to cold, especially when heating measure weren’t available.<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>

<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">And <span style="font-size:12pt;">Allâh</span> the Most Merciful says in his Noble Qur’aan :</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p style="margin-left:14pt;"><span style="font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:green;font-family:Garamond;"><strong>“<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Do not <span style="color:red;">kill <span style="color:green;">yourselves</span></span></span>. Verily Allâh is All-Merciful towards you.”</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:9pt;"> – [Surah an-Nisâ´(4):29]</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Hence, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">we are to save ourselves from being extreme</span> and not be hard upon ourselves , especially when the Most Merciful himself eases difficulties for us.<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Again points which should be noted is that Islam has been revealed for all times and for all people, unlike other regional human-origin religions hence by this we realise that centuries ago in desert areas of the world like Sahara,gobi ,Arabian deserts and elsewhere , it was impossible to find water to drink(which is a fact,for instance in darfur where people don’t even have drops<em> of water to drink)</em> , forget of ablution, and in such circumstance what would a person do , if he did not get water for ablution or that water available was only sufficient for drinking or due to extreme cold like in polar regions and in siberian peninsula he was unable to perform the ablution?<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Well, Islam is the complete way of life<em>(Deen)</em>, which guides you to truth,salavation and bliss in this world and the here-after and here again Islam provides the answer, that is <em>“At-Tayammum”</em> or the Dry Ablution as Allâh Azz wa Jall<em>(One True God)</em> does not want to burden us with difficulties as he wants everyone to attain the eternal bliss of paradise.<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Now,coming to the certain objections which were implied by Mr.Playgiarist<em>(Agniveer).</em>He states few things, I would like to quote him , he wrote<em>(emphasis mine)</em><br>
<span style="color:red;">“After <span style="text-decoration:underline;">hands</span> have already become <span style="color:#99cc00;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">dirty after the emission<span style="color:red;"> and rubbing dust</span></span>, why make face dirty no<span style="color:red;">w?”</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">A short note, I wonder how did Agniveer conclude that hands had become dirty after seminal emission, I hope Agniveer knows the area from where seminal fluid gushes out or emitted as far I know its not hands!Its also to be noted that the dust which is rubbed on the hands is first blown-off and then the face is wiped, so subsequently there remains no dust on the hands or the face, which is quite evident from the above where the method of dry ablution is described.Even if there is some remanant of dust then know that it’s the clean dust which is used for purification, and dust it self is pure and indeed its widely accepted in the scientific fraternity the humans are made of dust , so if using this clean dust is dirty then the humans themselves are dirty inherently as they are made of dust and other contributing elements <span style="font-size:12pt;">like <span style="color:blue;text-decoration:underline;">iron</span>,<span style="color:blue;text-decoration:underline;">fluorine</span> ,<span style="color:blue;text-decoration:underline;">silicon</span>,<span style="color:blue;text-decoration:underline;">lead</span>,<span style="color:blue;text-decoration:underline;">copper</span> , <span style="color:blue;text-decoration:underline;">aluminum</span> and <span style="color:blue;text-decoration:underline;">zinc</span> …etc<br>
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Now coming to the other point ,from the above quote ,we learn that Agniveer holds/believes that emission of seminal fluid is dirty and so is rubbing of dust, and reason he claims so is because of his belief that dust and semen are impure and dirty, or why would a person call rubbing of dust and emission of seminal fluid as being dirty , if he believed they <span style="text-decoration:underline;">were not dirty or pure</span>,so <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>the point to be note here is that Agniveer believes that “semen” and “dust” are dirty and impure.</strong></span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">But , does his so-called high sanitised standard prescribing hindu texts believe dust and semen to be impure and dirty?Inshaa’Allah we’ll have a look at this.<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:14pt;text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Hindu Scriptures state <span style="color:green;">“Semen”</span> and <span style="color:green;">“Dust”</span> to be <span style="color:red;">Pure</span> :</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Yajurveda Samhita states <em>“Semen” </em>to pure ,<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:14pt;"><span style="font-family:Bookman Old Style;font-size:10pt;">“O’ all learned people fully realise your conduct towards different objects of the universe, know ye the electricity that maintains all beautiful objects, the aged sun, the invisible matter brought into creation, the invigorating vital airs, <span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;"><strong>pure semen</strong></span> and the noble, active suppressor of foes. Thus ye become the utilisers of all objects, and eaters of milk products.”</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Garamond;"><span style="font-size:9pt;">– (Yajurveda, Ch 8, verse 57, pg-90, Translated by Devi Chand</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">And in ,<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:14pt;"><span style="font-family:Bookman Old Style;font-size:10pt;">“May my pervading sun and its heat, my method of eating and dainty dishes, my firm rule and protector, my master and his residence, my mental contemplation and solitude, my mid-breath and strength, my action dealing with electricity and air, and water, my Pran and Udan, and Vyan, my beauty like that of the sun and moon, and of mind, my gait and walks, <span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;"><strong>my pure nature and semen</strong></span>, my spirit of investigation and milk-pot flourish through the proper use of fire.”</span><br>
<span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:9pt;">– (Yajurveda, Ch 18, verse 19, pg-194, Translated by Devi Chand)</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">We read that Yajurveda clearly declares <em>“semen”</em> to be pure which is just the opposite what Mr.Plagiarist<em>(Agniveer)</em> believes and thus according to him seminal fluid is dirty and a human becomes dirty after ejaculation<span style="color:#99cc00;"><em>(well according to Islam after ejaculation of “Sperm”or having sexual intercourse, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">bathing is mandatory</span> but if water is not found dry ablution can be done or after ejaculation of prostatic-seminal fluid it needs to be washed and ablution is to be done and again if water isn’t available dry ablution can be done)</em></span>of it , well it also noteworthy to point that while the “holy” veda declare “semen” to be pure ,where as Vishnu Smriti states semen to be impure<span style="font-size:10pt;"><br>
<em>(Ch-22 ,verse 81)</em></span> so does the most authentic and respected Manu Smriti simply states it to be impure and Vishnu Smriti also states the same in(<span style="font-size:10pt;"> (Vishnu Smriti, Ch-22 , verse 81)</span>.<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:14pt;"><span style="font-family:Bookman Old Style;font-size:10pt;">“In order to cleanse (the organs) by which urine and faeces are ejected, <span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;"><strong>earth and water</strong></span> must be used, as they may be required, likewise in removing the (remaining ones among) <span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;"><strong>twelve impurities of the body</strong></span>. Oily exudations, <span style="color:green;text-decoration:underline;"><strong>semen</strong></span>, blood, (the fatty substance of the) brain, urine, faeces, the mucus of the nose, ear-wax, phlegm, tears, the rheum of the eyes, and sweat are the twelve impurities of human (bodies).”</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>

</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Now, this is contraditory but its well known that vedas are considered<em>(amongst hindus)</em> the ultimate authority, hence usually their<em>(vedas)</em> position is accepted, another thing to note is again here , the Manu prescribes using of earth<em>(dust,soil)</em> which is considered dirty according to Agniveer.We’ll now have a brief look at whether the Hindu scriptures consider dust,earth,soil…etc as dirty or impure?<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">This has already been prove in this article<em>(treatise)</em> earlier in many places, nonetheless it will be briefly reproduced here to show our readers that dust, is considered as pure and purifying agent in Hinduism.Full references and full quotes will be avoided until a new verse is quoted, as these verses are previousily quoted completely with full references.<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>

</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:14pt;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">All the above quotes from the varios Dharma Shastras<em>(Hindu Law Books)</em> and Purana only prove that dust,earth,soil are pure and dirty according to the Vedic Dharma<em>(Hinduism).</em>Infact Markandeya Purana go to the extant that dust is not defiled even if its been contaminated by somethings impure,corrupt.Where as the Vishnu Shastra states that dust is always pure no matter what, and according to Manu Shastra dust is pure to touch and earth is the purifier of corporeal beings, well all these statements clearly contradict to what Agniveer believes.<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:14pt;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">In factuality according to Hindu Scriptures earth/soil/dust is so pure that it purifies food if scattered over it, and this dust,soil is so pure that during the settlement of boundaries its poured over the heads,see here –<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>

<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Not only this but even the YajurVeda ask people to respect persons living in sandy places, now this is what was needed , wasn’t it? A student to be dusty,respecting people living in sandy places…amazing.<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">So , its been well established that dust,soil,sand and earth are all considered as pure in Vedic Dharma<em>(Hinduism)</em>, again which is just the otherwise of what Mr.Plagiarist<em>(Agniveer</em>) believes and spreads, I wonder, if according to him anything is pure or not.<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>

</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Now , I would like our readers to have a brief look at, the prescribed ablution in the Hindu scriptures –<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:14pt;"><span style="font-family:Bookman Old Style;font-size:10pt;"><em>“</em>Another son<em><sup>* </sup></em> stationed in the borders of- the cheeks for 19 half a muhurta, O brahman, consumes every undertaking, and eulogium, and sincerity. By addresses to brahmans, by 20 praise to the gods, and by extracting roots, O brahman, <span style="color:red;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>by <span style="color:green;">ablutions <span style="color:red;">with cows’ urine</span></span></strong></span> and mustard seed, so also by worship paid to the constellations and </span>planets, and also by the observance of righteousness and the Upanishads, by repeatedly looking at weapons, and by contempt for birth Ganda-pranta-rati succumbs.”</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br>

</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">This was the remedy given to people and against, the evil child Ganda-pranta-rati<em>( the Reveller in the borders of the cheeks)</em>of Duhsaha and born on Nirmashti.This is child like other childern<em>(of Duhsaha)</em> is almost personification of physical injuries, moral vices and social offences.In this case , the child Ganda-pranta-rati is stationed in the borders of cheeks and destroyes all the eulogia,praise and other deeds,hence the remedy is provided that is <span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;"><strong>ablutions with cows’ urine!</strong></span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Ablution with filth and excreta is fair for hindus but with clean dust is objectionable, this is sarcasmm and quite biased approach which all hindus have.Also , earlier I’ve quoted many smritis which show hindu purificatory methods and penances like in <strong>Parashar Smriti</strong></span><span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:10pt;">(Ch 6 verses 32 – 33) </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">a Brahman<em>(Priestly caste man)</em> is prescribed to purify himself with sustaining on half-barley steeped in <span style="text-decoration:underline;">cow’s urine</span> for 10 nights, in case hw eat food that belongs to Chandala<em>(Outcast)</em> caste.Also in <strong>Vishnu Smriti</strong>(</span><span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:10pt;">Ch 22, verse 18)</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"> is states that a Sudra<em>(Servile or low caste man)</em> is <span style="text-decoration:underline;">bathe and drink</span> Pankagavya<em>( the five productions of a cow, consist of milk, sour milk, butter, <span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;">urine, and cow-dung</span>)</em> if he happen to eat the food of another Sudra who happened to be in impure state.And such penances and purifactory methods have also been prescribed in Manu Smriti and other scriptures, which have been already quote earlier in the article.<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Summing up, its quite strange that Agniveer’s having problem with rational purification concepts and methods in Islam<em>(like using clean dust if water not available)</em> where as his own scriptures like shastras,puranas and vedas are filled with irrational,impractical concepts of purification<em>(like ablution and bathing with cows urine an dung…etc)</em> and statements for instance,respect people living in sandy places in truth respect should given to every one whether he lives in sandy,distant,green places or anywhere else, regardless of his place of living.And still we see people like Agniveer claiming Hinduism<em>(Vedic Dharma)</em> to be practical and Islam otherwise, whereas infactuality its Islam which is practical ,as we have seen so far and Inshaa’Allah will see throughout the treatise<em>(article). </em><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br>

The choice is readers' whether they want to embrace this practicality or pray to remain impractical forever! I believe Islamic Research Foundation can shed some light on these areas of research which baffle the sensibility of any civilized human being.\n\n(Most of these Hadiths explain everything themselves, we shall only comment in very few places, wherever necessary. As usual, they are lifted straight from Islamic sources with no modifications)\n\n \nWell, his(Agniveer) epilogue , is quite deceiving to be concise, he claims to provide unmodified Islamic information(claims mainly Hadeeth) , which is pretty false, as throught out the article he, has many times not provided any quote ,but just cited a reference, and on it has built his concocted and far-fetched, irrational views and claims.Also , his quotation from inauthentic,fabricated sources will be evident later , in this article, Inshaa'Allah.Also we'll see the so-called \"impracticality\" of Islam, and have a brief look at the \"practicality\" of Vedic Dharma(Hinduism). This article will try and shed light on the various issues.\n\nLastly I would have used both Scriptures from the Orthodox Hindus and from the Protestant Hindus(so-called Arya Samajis)\nFor instance , Manu Smriti\/Manava Dharma Shastra(with few interpolations) is authoritative to Protestant Hindus , and Other Puranas,Smirits (Vishnu,Gautama..etc) are authoritative and holy according Orthodox Hindus, and Yajurveda Translation used is , of Protestant Hindu Interpretation.I've tried to create a balance by using scriptures from both the camps , so as to shed some light for any Truth Seeker and also our general reader.Also , in quotes are the words of Agniveer, and elsewhere its stated as cited.\n\nFinally, I would like to ask people who are genuinely interested in Islam to browse through this website to learn about Islam –\n\n\nwww.islamreligion.com\n\n\nNow coming back to the topic and to proceed:\n\nFirstly the article is too caddish and impertinent which is the usual manner of Islamophobes like Agniveer and his loony-toon company , also this article hardly needs a refutation , as these so-called arguments prove nothing but the evil, deceiving, lying face of Protestant Hindus [the self-claimed \"Noble\" (Arya) Samajis].Again as we all know that he is(Agniveer) \"big\" plagiarist this article to is adapted and mostly copied from Abul Qasems' (an Islamophobe) useless articles.\n\nIn the whole article Agniveer seems to be obsessed by the fact that Prophet Muhammad (Sallal lahu Alayhi wa Sallam )was Noblest Human ever and his followers held him so high that they even took his sweat and used it with perfumes as it had beautiful and very good fragrance and this indeed was a miracle , which people during his time witnessed.I think Agniveer is quite obsessed with the High rank Prophet Muhammad (Salall lahu alayhi wa Sallam) was provided by the Allâh Almighty(One True God) and the reverence, people had for him.\n\nNow scrutinizing the article a bit exposes Agniveer and his deception ! I wonder who can he fool? As every Muslim knows , the importance Islam lays on Hygiene cleanliness , and purity. Agniveer and his article are only helpful to the blind followers like Protestant Hindus (so-called Arya Samajis) knowing the fact that hardly they know truth and nor they try to seek it.\n\nQuote: 1.Muhammad ordered his followers to drink the water which he rinsed his mouth wit!h\n\nSahih Bukhari (1.187)\n\n\nNarrated Abu Juhaifa: Allah's Apostle came to us at noon and water for ablution (cleaning body) was brought to him. After he had performed ablution, the remaining water was taken by the people and they started smearing their bodies with it (as a blessed thing). The Prophet offered two rak`at of the Zuhr prayer and then two rak`at of the `Asr prayer while a short spear (or stick) was there (as a Sutra) in front of him. Abu Musa said: The Prophet asked for a tumbler containing water and washed both his hands and face in it and then threw a mouthful of water in the tumbler and said to both of us (Abu Musa and Bilal), \"Drink from the tumbler and pour some of its water on your faces and chests.\"\n\n\nThe Hadeeth quoted by Agniveer is quite clear and shows the reverence the Muslims had toward the Prophet Muhammad(Sallal lahu Alayhi wa Sallam).Now Agniveer exposes his sheer deception when he says \"Muhammad ordered his followers to drink the water which he rinsed his mouth with\"\n\n\nThe Hadeeth is clear that Prophet \"threw a mouthful of water in the tumbler\" now , how do we throw a mouthful of water? Of course with Hands ! Nowhere does the Hadeeth talk of rinsing his mouth! Nowhere does Hadeeth say that Prophet spat the water in the tumbler, what the beloved prophet did was he threw extra water which he had in his hand, in tumbler which was a mouthful of amount , and the reasons for it are quite clear :\n\n\n1) Avoiding wastage of water and extravagant use of it.\n2) Arabia was and is a desert peninsula ,where people hardly had water to drink and in such times wasting water could be dangerous and regretful later.\n\n\nAlso the point should be noted that the people were very eager to use the water that Prophet Muhammad used . As this is quite noticeable from the Hadeeth. The people were eager to use the water from the tumbler which the Prophet had used for ablution. Which only proves the high esteem the Prophet of Mercy was held in by those who at first were thirsty of his blood and later embraced Islam and believe in him, this is the love the believers had for him as we all know the great miracles that were provided to him which were witnessed by these people.\n\n\nQuote: To prove his divine authority, Muhammad even let a sick boy drink the leftover water after he had performed ablution (Sahih Bukhari, 1.4.189).\n\n\n\nAnother boy drank the leftover water\/milk that Muhammad had drunk (Sahih Bukhari, 3.40.541, 554)As per Sahih Bukhari, Prophet's spit after mouthwash, and water that remained after his cleaning of all body parts, had miraculous properties.\n\n\n \n\nIt's really shameful even to see Agniveer , lying and twisting Hadeeth to deviate and fool people , above he alleges Prophet Muhammad to have \"let a sick boy\" (Sa'ib) drink the so-called \"leftover\" water(which was not leftover but the remaining water in the vessel from which Prophet drew some water to perform his ablution) but as we read the full hadeeth the truth is crystal clear to us. Did the Prophet do so? Of course not, as the sick boy(Sa'ib) himself said \"then he(Prophet) performed ablution and I drank from the remaining water. I stood behind him and saw the seal of Prophethood between his shoulders\"  \n\n\n \nThe boy drank the remaining water in the vessel from which the prophet had drawn little water to perform his ablution, and while he (Sa'ib the sick boy )was drinking the water he was behind the Prophets back and the holy Prophet was busy praying. So what does this prove , it's clear it proves that the water was not \"leftover\" but remaining water of the vessel from which Prophet had taken out some to perform his ablution and while the sick boy drank the water from this vessel he was standing right back of Prophet and the prophet was busy praying. This again proves the lying and twisting nature of Islamophobes. And anyone who reads the hadeeth in full will clearly see the deception of the claimant; hence Agniveer didn't provide the full hadeeth, as this would expose him and his lies.\n\nComing to the another two hadeeth which Agniveer has cited (i.e. Sahih Bukhari, 3.40.541, 554), both the hadeeth are quoted completely below.\n\n\n \nNarrated Sahl bin Sa`d: A tumbler (full of milk or water) was brought to the Prophet who drank from it, while on his right side there was sitting a boy who was the youngest of those who were present and on his left side there were old men. The Prophet asked, \"O boy, will you allow me to give it (i.e. the rest of the drink) to the old men?\" The boy said, \"O Allâh's Apostle! I will not give preference to anyone over me to drink the rest of it from which you have drunk.\" So, the Prophet gave it to him. - (Saheeh al Bukhari , 3:40:541)\n\nAnd ,\n\nNarrated Sahl bin Sa`d: Once a tumbler (full of milk or water)was brought to Allâh's Apostle who drank from it, while on his right side there was sitting a boy who was the youngest of those who were present, and on his left side there were old men. The Prophet asked, \"O boy ! Do you allow me to give (the drink) to the elder people (first)?\" The boy said, \"I will not prefer anybody to have my share from you, O Allâh's Apostle!\" So, he gave it to the boy. - (Saheeh al Bukhari , 3:40:554)\n\n \nAs we can see both the Hadeeth are approximately same - ditto with same meaning with little variation in words. Now coming to the deception of Agniveer, we can see that the Hadeeth talks of a tumbler containing milk or water , which the prophet intended to give to the elder people who were seated to the left of the tumbler, so what this proves is the respect, love and mercy which prophet held for the Old and the love of kids for their Prophet. Also this Hadeeth proves how Islam bridges gap between generations and the rich and poor, the prophet gave the from the same tumbler from which drink he drank to those who were present there and the Kid was eager to take this drink as he knew the holiness of a drink by the hand of the Prophet, so did the others knew.\n\n \nAgain, now we shall analyze distortion,twists and spins used by Agniveer to fool people, he wrote \"Another boy drank the leftover water\/milk that Muhammad had drunk\" now again here he is trying to make the Prophet of Mercy as a \"tyrant\" asked people to consume his leftovers, but as we read that Prophet took his drink – water\/milk ,from the tumbler and then passed it to other people so that they too could benefit from it, and this is what is called \"Sharing\", and \"love\" for all people, which Islam preaches and this is totally alien to Agniveer , as it seems.\n\nSo a question arises, \"Is it wrong to share a drink from the same tumbler ?\" Especially when you're living in a Desert where one hardly has a few drops of water to drink ! \n\nConcisely this hadeeth only proves , Islam and its equality and encouragement for sharing resources and increasing love between people, I am pretty sure that Agniveer will hardly contemplate this Hadeeth as these qualities are alien to him and his \"Vedic Dharma.\"\n\nNow let's briefly see what do the \"Holy\" Dharma Shastras (Hindu Law Books) which the \"Great\" Hindu Sages like Parashar et al . conveyed to the Hindus and derived from the \"Holy\" Vedas! :::\n\n\n \n\"Articles of food\nwhich have been looked at by a dog, or by a person of the Chandala caste, should be thrown away.\" (Parashara Smriti, Ch 6 verse 67, Translated by KrishnaKamal Bhattacharya, Calcutta ,1887.)\n\n\"To eat a Shoodra's food, to associate with him, to sit in the same place with, him, and receive knowledge by his instruction, would cause degradation\neven to one who resembles the kindled fire.\" ( Parashara Smriti ,Ch 12 verse 34)\n\n\"When a Brahman through ignorance chances to eat any food that belongs to one of the Chandala caste, he should purify himself by living on half-ripe barley and cow's urine for ten nights. The barley should be steeped in the cow's urine, and one mouthful thereof should be taken day by day ; for ten days he must live a blameless life ; this is the penance prescribed for him.\"  (Parashara Smriti ,Ch 6 verses 32 – 33)\n\n \nI think these verse (laws) prove a lot of things to the Hindus, I think it also exposes their , discrimination toward , varying fractions of society( the so-called Shudras). So I do not expect Agniveer to stand out for \"equality\", \"Sharing\"\n\"Brotherly love\" \"Humanity\" ..etc. when his \"great\" Vedic predecessors who are stilled revered by these Hindus as \"Sages\" were just the opposite, and so was their so-called \"great Vedic civilization\".\n\n\n\nQuote: Comment: Could not the Prophet find more civilized way of blessing and treating people than providing them his excreta? Readers can decide themselves how seriously they would want to implement such water sharing practically! Vedic dharma, on contrary, conforms to highest standards of hygiene and purity and considers that only wretched people use such 'Jootha' or dirty water.\n\n\nHere , Agniveer tries to promulugate , that \"Vedic Dharma\" is more civilized than the Only True Religion\/Way of Life – Islam, we shall Inshaa'Allah, verify these claims and scrutinize it to show the people , so that the people may see and contemplate the truth.Futher , in the article, these pompous claims are verified in the light of truth, with facts and not just talk and useless, rhetoric.Also, we shall expose the truth , about \n\nthe religion, which propagates drinking, excreta and using it, and praising it , as though it's a potion of immortality.\n\nHe(Agniveer) claims , Vedic Dharma conforms to the highest standard of Hygiene and considers that only wretched people use such 'Jootha'(i.e. 'dirty water' , as written by hm) !Let's examine his claims and scrutinize it. A little , scrutiny will, reveal the truth and expose the agendas, propagandas against Islam.\n\n \n\nExposing the Lie of \"Drinking\" and \"Using\" the leftover water in Islam -\n\nIs it permissible in Islam to use the leftover water ? Or did the Prophet of Mercy Muhammad (Sallal lahu alayhi wa Sallam) permitted use of the leftover water ?\n\nWell , lets see what the Prophet of Mercy himself said about such water in the following hadeeth.\n\n \nA Man who accompanied the Prophet (Sallal lahu alayhi wa Sallam) narrated that \" The Messenger of Allâh ,forbade that a woman should wash by the water leftover by the man, or that a man should wash with the water leftover by the woman.\" [Abu Dawud, An-Nasaii and Bulughul Maram min Adillat al-Ahkam , Book 1, no. 9]\n\nWhat we read above is a clear statement of the Prophet , prohibiting the usage of leftover water, I guess this should totally expose those who alleged prophet of making people drink, and use leftover water.\n\nWe see the , truth of vedic liars and their concocted claims about Islam, which only blind followers of Vedic Dharma(Hinduism) and none else can accept.Now its time to scrutinise the Hindu scriptures and see how hygienic they are and what do they mean by cleanliness and purity.\n\nThe penance for Drinking Spiritual liquor ,according to the Manu Shastra\/Smriti(one of the most authentic Hindu Law Book):\n\n\"A twice-born man who has (intentionally) drunk, through delusion of mind, (the spirituous liquor called) Sura shall drink that liquor boiling-hot; when his body has been completely scalded by that, he is freed from his guilt; Or he may drink cow's urine, water, milk, clarified butter or (liquid) cowdung boiling-hot, until he dies;\" ( The Laws of Manu, Ch 11 verses 91-92, Translated by George Bühler)\n\nHere the Twice-Born man refers to any human of the first three caste of hindu caste System.So drinking of Urine, Cowdung or Ordure is praiseworthy and a way to get rid of sins, amazing isn't it?\n\n \n\nAnother Type of Penance is Samtapana Krikkhra wherein you eat and sustain on \"Excreta\" -\n\n\"(Subsisting on) the urine of cows, cowdung, milk, sour milk (yogurt), clarified butter, and a decoction of Kusa-grass, and fasting during one (day and) night, (that is) called a Samtapana Krikkhra.\" ( The Laws of Manu, Ch 11 verse 213, Translated by George Bühler)\n\n \nAlso this has been promoted in Vaishnava DharmaShastra\/Sutras commonly known as Vishnu Smriti –\n\n\"A Sudra (who has eaten the food) of another Sudra , while the latter was impure, must bathe (in a river) and drink\nPankagavya.\"\n\nNote : The \"Pankagavya\", or five productions of a cow, consist of milk, sour milk, butter, urine, and cow-dung.\n- [ Vishnu Smriti Ch 22, verse 18, pg 89, Translated by Julius Jolly ,Oxford , Clarendon Press , 1880]\n\nSo what we learn is, its not Islam that has been calling people to eat, drink and sustain on \"Excreta\" as alleged by ill-intentioned lying hindus , but it's the so-called \"Holy\" Vedic Dharma(Hinduism) which calls to eating and drinking of Excreta.And there are more verses like such where hindus are ordered to eat , and drink excreta, but I guess this shall suffice the truth seeker and expose the lies against the only true way of Life , that's Islam.Inshaa'Allah we'll see a lot more verses on cleanliness, hygiene and purification found in Hindu Scriptures which will help us understand what these terms mean in Hinduism.\n\n\n \n\nQuote: Let us explore this Science of Islam and Hygiene from the original texts:\n\nAgniveer writes about exploring Science of Islam and HYGIENE but his I mpertinent, imbecilic article proves , that he has been copying from his \" Idols' \" websites that are Christian missionary and Islamophobes and he too is a wannabee Islamphobe. He hasn't explored anything but just copied from the missionaries , now is this exploring ?\n\n I would like to take this as an opportunity to educate people about Islamic stance on cleanliness, hygience, purity, manners which will surely expose the deceiving face of Islamophobes and their lying nature of Islamophobes et al.\n\nLet's see what Islam teaches of hygiene, purity and cleanliness. Islam is a religion of cleanliness and hygiene unlike other pagan and human-invented religions like Sanatan Dharma(Hinduism , Protestant Hinduism et al.), Christianity…etc. Islam stressed on cleanliness and hygiene very much as Allâh the Most High says:\n\n\n \n\n\"Truly, Allâh loves those who turn unto Him in repentance\nand loves those who purify themselves (by taking a bath and cleaning and washing thoroughly their private parts, bodies, for their prayers, etc.).\" (2:222)\n\n\n\"Never stand you therein. Verily, the mosque whose foundation was laid from the first day on piety is more worthy that you stand therein (to pray). In it are men who l ove to clean and to purify themselves. And Allâh loves those who make themselves clean and pure  (i.e. who clean their private parts with dust (i.e. to be considered as soap) and water from urine and stools, after answering the call of nature).\" (9:108)\n\n\"O you who believe! When you rise up for prayer, wash your faces, and your hands up to the elbows, and wipe your heads (with wet hands), and (wash) your feet up to the ankles. And if you are in a state of major ritual  impurity (janaba), purify yourselves (by taking a bath). And if you are sick or on a journey, or one of you comes from the answering of call of nature, or you have had contact with women, and you find no water, then go to clean earth and wipe your faces and hands with some of it. Allâh does not want to place you in difficulty, but He wants to purify you and to perfect His grace upon you that you may give thanks.\" (5:6)\n\nThese above quoted Holy Qur'anic verse state that Allâh the Most Merciful loves purity and those who purify themselves and those who are hygienic, these verses are enough to disprove any void\/baseless allegations like Agniveer has alleged Islam with nonetheless as said earlier this will be taken as an opportunity to educate and teach people , about the cleanliness, purity, hygiene in Islam.Agniveer has hardly tried to research the subject or delved into Islamic literature to learn and read about Prophet Muhammad's (Sallal lahu Alayhi wa Sallam) sayings and stance on cleanliness and hygiene which is clearly observable from his incoherent and deceptive article. Now we shall learn and contemplate Prophet's words and stance on the subject.\n\nNarrated Abû Mâlik al-Hârith bin Âsim al-Ash'ari: Allâh's Messenger said,\n\"Cleanliness is half of Faith\"\n\n- [Saheeh Muslim (no. 2696), also Sahih Al- Jami' Al-Saghir (no.3957)]\n\nPurification or cleanliness is considered an inseparable part of faith in Islam and I believe this single hadeeth of the Prophet of mercy Muhammad (Sallal lahu Alayhi wa Sallam) rebuts all the lies concocted against him on the issue of hygiene and cleanliness, as we read above that in Islam cleanliness is half of faith , that is if you are clean and hygienic its as if you have acquitted half of faith, and as we see that this hadeeth is been recorded in Saheeh Muslim which Agniveer quotes extensively to promulgate his concocted lies , but fails to provide this hadeeth this exposes him and his false lies , agendas against Islam in full.\n\nInshaa'Allah we'll delve deep into this issue to show people the true Islamic stance on the subject.\n\n\n \n\nThe Prophet of mercy said –\n\n\"Allâh does not accept Prayers without purification.\" -[Muslim and Ibn ,Abu Dawud, Al-Nasa'i and Ibn Majah, Sahih Al- Jami' Al-Saghir, No.7746]  \n\n'I disliked that I should mention God's name while I am not in a state of purity.' - [Ibn Khuzaimah #206]\n\nNone of the prayers, are valid in Islam until and unless you are pefectly, pure.And as our beloved Prophet said that he disliked even taking the name of Allâh Azz wa Jall , while he was defiled or impure, this should clear all the misconceptions and concocted lies against the Prophet of mercy Muhammad (Sallal lahu alayhi wa Sallam).\n\nIn both Saheeh Al-Bukhari and Sahih Muslim, Ibn `Umar reported that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: \"Whoever has eaten garlic, should not approach our mosque\". \n\n- [Agreed upon  \nJabir Ibn `Abdullah reported that the Prophet (Peace be upon him)\nsaid: \"Whoever has eaten garlic or onion should keep away from our mosque and stay at home.\"\n\n- [Agreed upon, Al-Lu `lu' Wal Marjan (No 331-333)]\n\nAnd Al-Mughirah Ibn Shu'bah reported; \"Whoever has eaten from this malignant tree, should not approach our mosque until its smell completely vanishes.\"\n- [Ahmad, Abu Dawud and Ibn Hibban, Sahih Al- Jami' Al Saghir (No.6092)]  \n\nThese Hadiths rebukes those who eat these raw legumes and threaten to exclude him from approaching the mosques. Lastly, cleanliness and pleasant appearance are of characteristics which allow relationships to strengthen amongst people. The sane human being will try to avoid people who are unkempt. Hence, the Prophet emphasized the importance of cleanliness , hygiene and purity. Similarly, there is a prohibition on eating garlic, onion, leek and food like it, before going to the mosque in order not to disturb others from the strong odor. If one insists on eating them, then he is not permitted to enter the mosque and is deprived of the congregational Prayer.\n\nNow proving some more points relating to cleanliness and hygiene which many non-muslim still fail to implement.\n\nThe Prophet (Sallal lahu alayhi wa Sallam) said:\n\n\"None of you should urinate in still water and then perform Ghusl (bath) in it.\" - [Agreed upon, Al-Lu'lu' Wal Mrajan (No.161)]\n\n \"None of you should urinate in stagnant water and then make ablution in it.\"\n-[Ahmad, Al-Tirmidhi and Al-Nasa'i, Sahih Al-Jami' Al Saghir, (No.7594)]\n\n\n\"None of you should urinate in a bathing place.\" - - [Ahmad, Abu Dawud, Al-Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah, Al Nasa'i, Al-Hakim ,Ibn Hibban ,Sahih Al- Jami' Al-Saghir (No.7597)]\n\nCleaning oneself before going to bed:\n\n\n \n\"Whoever goes to sleep without washing his hands from the traces of fatty foods, exposes himself to illness and should blame no one but himself.\"\n- [Abu Dawud (No.3852), Al-Tirmidhi (No.1861), Ibn Majah (No.3267), Al-Mawarid (No. 1354)]\n\nThe Prophet of mercy also said :\n\n\n \n\n\"Ten acts are demands of\ntrue nature, namely: clipping the moustache, letting the beard grow, brushing the teeth with Miswak, snuffing up water in the nose, clipping the nails, washing the finger joints, plucking (shaving,removing) the hair under the armpits, shaving the pubes, and cleaning the private parts with water (after call of nature) The narrator said: I have forgotten the tenth, but it may have been rinsing the mouth.?\"\n- (Saheeh Muslim) \n\n\n \n\nThese were few of the characteristics and sayings of our beloved Prophet and these prove how hygienic he was and how Hygienic Islam needs one Humans being to be. These are enough proof for a unbiased person to recognize the true stance of Islam on the subject.\n\n\n \n\nQuote: 2. Islamic saliva and Muhammad's Tongue!\n\na. Muhammad used his saliva to soften a date, and then gave it to an infant to suck. (Sahih Muslim, 25.5340, 5341, 5345)\n\nb. When Anas's son was born, Muhammad fed him with dates mixed with his (Muhammad's) saliva and gave him the name Abdullah. (Sahih Muslim, 31.6013)\n\nc. Bukhari Volume 1, Book 4, Number 188:\n\nNarrated Ibn Shihab: Mahmud bin Ar-Rabi' who was the person on whose face the Prophet had ejected a mouthful of water from his family's well while he was a boy, and 'Urwa (on the authority of Al-Miswar and others) who testified each other, said, \"Whenever the Prophet , performed ablution, his companions were nearly fighting for the remains of the water.\"\n\n\nd. Muhammad's saliva is good for children. He used to spit into the mouth of suckling children, and his saliva would satisfy them until nightfall. (Ash Shifa, p.184)\n\n\ne. If a baby sucked Muhammad's tongue, the baby became quiet. (Ash Shifa, p.184)\n\n\nf. He gave al Hasan and al Husayn his tongue to suck. They had been weeping from thirst and upon sucking Muhammad's tongue they became quiet. (Ash Shifa, p.184)\n\n\ng. People rubbed Muhammad's spittle on their faces. (Ash Shifa, p.237)\nh. Muhammad recommended that you can spit on your cloth and then fold it and rub it. (Sahih Muslim, 4.1121)\n\n\nI. Spit three times to the left when someone questions who created Allah. (ibn Ishaq, p.270)\n\nj. Prophet spat on his clothes (Bukhari 1.4.242)\n\n\n \nInshaa'Allah, these conjectures and concocted claims will be refuted in full, to proceed :\n\nThe ahadeeth (Saheeh Muslim, Book 25, ahadeeth 5340 , 5341,5345) quoted in point (a) only shows , how merciful,humble and ever-helpful Prophet Muhammad was, he even helped people in taking care of their children, ,and with regards to chewing dates to soften them, so that a newly born child can eat it then , I don't find any reason for any criticism, infact it's a sign of mercy and love towards children.And this was also a norm which was followed then, and this is even done throught out the world, as this helps the child chew and digest the food , easily.\n\nThese cited ahadeeth ,are infact prooving, the Islam, and the Prophet of Mercy's love and care towards children, and his striving to provide them , the best in his capabilities.\n\nNow coming to the point (b) where Agniveer intentionally tries to deceive people by writing \"When Anas's son was born, Muhammad fed him with dates mixed with his (Muhammad's) saliva and gave him the name Abdullah.\"\n\n \n\nLet me quote excerpt of the Hadeeth to reveal his deception :\n\n\n \nI(Abu Talha , father of the child) brought that child to him and placed it in his lap and Allâh's Messenger (may peace be upon him) asked Ajwa dates of Medina to be brought and softened them in his month. When these had become palatable he placed them in the mouth of that child. The child began to taste them. Then Allâh's Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: See what love the Ansar have for dates. He then wiped his face and named him 'Abdullah.\"\n\n \nHere again ,just as in the ahadeeth cited in point (a),Prophet Muhammad(Sallal lahu Alayhi wa Sallam) chewed the date so ,that it would be easier on the newlyborn child to consume them, nowhere does the hadeeth says that \"Muhammad fed him with dates mixed with his (Muhammad's) saliva\" as implied by Agniveer, this is just another trick to deviate people , so its clear that Prophet Muhammad did not feed his Saliva to the child as claimed and hence he(Agniveer) made a new point for this single hadeeth just to fool people, when this hadeeth is same like the ones cited in point (a).\n\nAnd , Prophet Muhammad was indeed the most generous and merciful man , and this is what is well-know :\n\n \nAbu Hurayra said, \"When the Messenger of Allâh, may Allâh bless him and grant him peace, was brought new dates, he said, 'O Allâh! Bless us in our city and in our mudd and sa' (units of measure) , blessing upon blessing.' Then he would give one to the youngest of the children with him.\"\n\n-          [ Al-Adab al-Mufrad, no. 168]\n\nThis was our Prophet the most genrous man and the most kind too.These are the few chracterstics from him, which are enough to reveal the decption of polemics et al.\n\nThe Hadeeth (i.e. Bukhari Vol 1, Book 4, Number 188 )\nquoted in point (c) is just repeated again , this was quoted earlier in the article, the hadeeth is as follow :\n\n \nNarrated Ibn Shihab: Mahmud bin Ar-Rabi' who was the person on whose face the Prophet had ejected a mouthful of water from his family's well while he was a boy, and 'Urwa (on the authority of Al-Miswar and others) who testified each other, said, \"Whenever the Prophet , performed ablution, his companions were nearly fighting for the remains of the water.\"\n\n\nThe hadeeth just talks about prophet ejecting a mouthful amount of water on the face of the boy(Mahmud) from his own(Mahmud) family's well, and the reasons are not know , most probably its was the boy's own request , hence the narrators quoted al-Miswar and others who said \"Whenever the Prophet , performed ablution, his companions were nearly fighting for the remains of the water.\" As every one wanted the prophet of mercy to do something for him, and requested them to full fill their wish.And as we believe and is well-known about his miracles , this water too was of miraculous nature, unlike the usual water or dirty water. So what is apparent is that the boy himself may have request the prophet of mercy Muhammad (Sallal lahu Alayhi wa Sallam) to eject the water on his face so that he may be blessed.And we also learn that the water remaining in any tumbler,vessel or otherwise was fought over by the companions for its acquistion, as the Prophet was miraculous and his miracles were well know in both Muslim and non-Muslim circles.\n\nNow let's have a brief look at the Hindu Scriptures and their love for hygience and cleanliness , which has been practices for centuries in India by Hindus.\n\nThe Upa-Purana says :\n\"Narayana said :—\" O Narada! I am now talking of the three kinds of ashes ;hearing this even destroys one's sins and brings in good fame. When a cow evacuates her dung ,just as the cow dang leaves her and is far from reaching the ground, one should catch it with one's hand and this cowdung burnt with \"Sadyojatadi i.e. Brahma Mantra\" becomes ashes which are called \"Santika Bhasma,\" i.e. ashes producing peace. Before the cowdung is about to reach the ground, the devotee should take it with his hand and uttering the six lettered Mantra, he is to burn the cowdung. The ashes from this are called \" Paustik Bhasma\" i.e. ashes leading to nourishment. If the cowdung be burned with the Mantra \"Haum,\" the ashes of this are called \"Kamala Bhasma\" i.e., ashes leading to the granting of desires.\" 1 -  [Srimad Devi Bhagvatam,Book 11, Ch 11, pg 1081 , Translated by Swami Vijananda ,3rd Ed., Panini Office- Allahabad]\n\n \nSo according to this Upa-Purana , hearing this text (presented above) destroys sins, and brings good fame, also we read and learn about , catching cow-dung and its when various virtues when , burnt with chants(vedic mantras), so why is it that the prophet's used water cannot be miraculous?Also elsewhere it's stated( in a Purana, below) –\n\n\" The support of everything is this cow … and her horns are pious acts ; her hair the excellent words of the good ; her ordure and urine are tranquillity and prosperity…\" [ Markandeya Purana, Canto 29 ,verses 7-8, pg 152, Translated by F.Eden Pargiter, Published by the Asiatic Society, 1904]\n\n \nThe preceding , texts shows the reverence, and love of hindus for cow-ordure,urine and these this are infact \"tranquility\" and \"prosperity\" , so why is it that prophet's water when fought over by his companions(for it's acquisiton) , is criticised when these hindus indulge in vilest of all things and praise those(dirty,filthy,natsty..etc.) things?\n\n \nAlso the \"Holy\" veda says : \n\n\"Just as the cows and sun's rays protect the beautifying Heaven and Earth…\" -  [Yajurveda( Chapter 33, verse 19,pg 311, Translated by Devi Chand)]\n\n \n\nAnd the it also says :\n\n\"Horse, violent goat, forest cow possess the qualities of the sun. A black-necked beast, excellent amongest the beasts, has the qualities of fire.\"  [Yajurveda( Chapter 24, verse 1 ,pg 255, Translated by Devi Chand)]\n\n \n\nAlso see how Hindus are give Protection and seek Protection -\n\n\"The child was thoroughly washed with cow urine and then smeared with the dust raised by the movements of the cows. Then different names of the Lord were applied with cow dung on twelve different parts of His body, beginning with the forehead, as done in applying tilaka. In this way, the child was given protection.\" [ Srimad Bhagvatam , Canto 10, Ch 6, text- 20 , Translated by A.C. Bhaktivedanta Prabhupada, Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International]\n\n \n\nThis is the way hindus protect their children, so where's all the talk about Hygiene and cleanliness?\n\n\nHindu Gods (great sages and people etc., to Protestant Hindu) look \"Beautiful\" in Cow Dung and Cow-Urine !:\n\n\n\"When Krsna and Balarama, with the strength of Their legs, crawled in the muddy places created in Vraja by cow dung and cow urine… Dressed with muddy earth mixed with cow dung and cow urine, the babies looked very beautiful, and when They went to Their mothers, both Yasoda and Rohini picked Them up with great affection, embraced Them and allowed Them to suck the milk flowing from their breasts.\"  [ Srimad Bhagvatam , Canto 10, Ch 8, text's 22-23, Translated by A.C. Bhaktivedanta Prabhupada, Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International]\n\n\n \nWhat, I see is various, animals according to the vedas posses various, qualities which are higher in degree to them like cow has qualities of Sun! And in the verse quoted before this verse , cows are claimed to be protectors of the heaven and the earth! Again , it's strange that these people talk of science.Or is it that the Hindu God(Ishwar) does not know the qualities of various animals and hence indulges in gross exaggeration?\n\nAlso, when cows can posses qualities of sun, and be protectors of earth and heaven then ,I question whats the problem , when the prophet's water is regarded as miraculous (infact its blessedand miraculous), or blessed, they caddishly make fun of it, when he(Prophet Muhammad Sallal lahu alayhi wa sallam) was the final messenger of the One True Almighty God (Allâh), and was blessed and given various miracles.And the creatures which the Veda exaggerate about are mere animals!(Though they have their own qualitites and specialities which they are loved and respected for.)\n\n \nIn the Hindu Scriptures cows, horses..etc.(who are mere animals) and their ordure are given qualities which they don't posses and are blatantly claimed to be protectors of us(earth and heaven). Well , this is adequate, to prove how, hygienic, practical, scientific Vedic Dharma(Hinduism) is.Also , today I have learned that people can even look good , covered in Urine and Cow Dung, not good but beautiful, it is really amazing to read these verse which shed light on the meaning of Hygiene , cleanliness and purity in Hinduism, Oh! Also Beauty!\n\n It's hilarious to read these verses , as they are proof for the human origin of these books(Vedas et al.).\n\nNow the points (d,e,f,g) all are quote from the book of al-Qâdî `Iyâd , that's Ash-Shifâ' and here's what the Muslims Scholars have to say about the authenticity of the book.Though the book is known as good refernce for spirituality(and other subjects) as it contains good advises for those who seeking to increase their consciousness of Allâh(One True Almighty God) the All-Knowledgeable and spirituality.The great Islamic Scholar on the authenticity of the hadeeth found in the book –\n\nImam Shams al-Dîn al-Dhahabî in his immense biographical encyclopedia entitled Siyar A`lâm al-Nubalâ'. In his biographical entry on al-Qâdî `Iyâd (20\/212-216), he writes: \"His writings are valuable and one of his best works would have been his book al-Shifâ' had it not been filled with fabricated hadîth.\" \n\nI think this clears the fog , and we find Agniveer using inauthentic, fabricated hadeeth, to promulugate, and insinuate his lies against the Prophet of mercy Muhammad (Sallal lahu Alayhi wa Sallam).The Hadeeth need to be proven first, to be authentic and the citations he has provided comes from the book , famous for fabricated, false ahadeeth.This should suffice , and I hope Agniveer, cites some authentic ahadeeth.Citing fabrications,inauthentic hadeeth, false translations…etc are common traits of Islamophobes.\n\n \nThe point (h) , is again a clear deception where Agniveer only cites the refernces and provide's not the full hadeeth (i.e Saheeh Muslim, Book 4, no. 1121), as this will expose his concoted claims and this is also one of the method used when you are quoting out of context, and indeed this is what Agniveer has done here.The Hadeeth is recorded in the \"Book of Prayers\"(vol. 4) of Saheeh Muslim, in which ahadeeth pertaining to Prayer are recorded, this should clear the mist a bit, now revealing the fact that prophet Muhammad in the hadeeth was talking of spitting while in the Mosque(in the hadeeth cited) , the hadeeth goes like this :\n\n\"Messenger of Allâh (may peace be upon him) saw some sputum in the direction of the Qibla of the mosque. He turned towards people and said: How Is it that someone amongst you stands before his Lord… So when any one of you spits, he must spit on his left side under his foot. But if he does not find (space to spit) he should do like this. Qasim (one of the narrators) spat in his cloth and then folded it and rubbed it.\"\n\n \nSo we see that the Prophet is talking of spitting in the mosques (in those times the mosques didn't have tiles, or stones on the floor , its was ground,sand and the land without any tiles) so if anyone who wanted to spit then he should spit under his left feet as this would be absorbed and covered in the sand, and if he does not find space or the floor is tiled (as its not premissible to spit) he should spat in his cloth (people in those day were poor and could not afford hankerchiefs, infact some were so poor that they hardly had dresses to wear, or water to drink) and rub it so that it absorbs it.I think people forget that ,this was more than 1400 years , ago in a desert peninsula, where people hardly had drops of water to drink, grains to eat ,and clothes to wear.And this is well-know, still polemic's try and concoct against truth.\n\nPoint (i) talks of Prophet of Mercy Muhammad's (Sallal lahu Alayhi wa Sallam) saying of spitting three times to your left when some one insinuatingly and to make you doubt , questions you \"Well, it is Allâh Who created the creation, but who created Allâh?\"\n(as the pagans of Arab used to ask this to Muslims ). The Prophet of Mercy commanded us to say \"I affirm my faith in Allâh.\"\nOr\/and, spit three times to your left to debase the evil satan which encourages humans to question such imbecilic , and irrational questions.And this spitting is not spitting but blowing a few wind\/moist to your left, and this too only where one is allowed to spit , like spitting on road is prohibitted in countries like K.S.A, so you need not spit either say the \"Verse\"(or Du'aa), or blow wind(spit-less) to your left to show the crooked satan his foolishness and debase him , that he isn't only worth spitting.So basically here spitting , means sputum or saliva-less air blowed from the mouth.This hadeeth only proves the hatred and dislike of Muslims and Prophet of mercy toward \"Falsehood\" and \"Satan\" .\n\n \n\nPoint (j) has been earlier explained and refuted and debunked it's the same as point (h).\n\n\n \n\nQuote :\n\nComment: Some Muslim zealots justify these hadiths stating that saliva has medicinal properties. They forget that one's own saliva is good for one's own mouth and not for public sharing. The moment you get too charitable and start distributing your saliva to world around, it becomes a disgusting dirty practice that spreads disease. If indeed these hadiths are true, why don't we have drug stores in Islamic country where people sell bottles of saliva for therapeutic effects! Or maybe spit on each other while greeting!\n\n\nIn any civilized country, exchange and distribution of saliva, especially with children, is considered bit too uncivilized for obvious sanitation reasons.\n\n\nBy the way, Zakir Naik being an MBBS should work on this aspect and try to find some antidote for HIV, cancer etc. Still hairs of Prophet are preserved in some shrines!\n\n \nWell, these words\/comment's of Agniveer are hilarious,gravely misleading, and highly far-fetched, I pity Agniveer and his contemplating, interpretive skills , I would like to know who taught these skills to him, no doubt it's the so-called \"Maharishis\"\n(Great Seers), \"Mahamunis\", \"Yogis\" et al. who taught him these things. And I am amused to see the height of his imagination and conjectures. Wake up ,Agniveer can you come back to reality now , out of your imaginative world?Or if it pleases you, you can live in your delusions, as it's all about personal quest for Truth, which the hindus dislike and despise taking in, which at least hurts them and detroys them.\n\nEarlier , Agniveer claimed , vedic dharma(Hindu Religion) to be \"Hygienic\" and Islam to be otherwise(which is debunked earlier) , now here are few sholka's(verses) from the sacred \"Dharma Shastra\"\n(Hindu law books), this will open the eyes of few , scatter and expose a lot of false propagandas, Inshaa'Allah.\n\n \n\nThings which are always pure, according to Hindu Scriptures –\n\n\n \n\"Flies, saliva dropping from the mouth, a shadow, a cow, an elephant, a horse, sun-beams, dust, the earth, air, fire, and a cat are always pure. Such drops as fall from the mouth of a man upon any part of his body do not render it impure, nor do hairs of the beard that enter his mouth, nor remnants of his food adhering to his teeth.\"[ Vishnu Smriti,Ch-23 , verses 52-53,pg 104 , Translated by Julius Jolly ,Oxford , Clarendon Press , 1880]\n\n \n\nFlies , dust etc are Pure says Manav Dharma Shastra too -\n\n\" Flies, drops of water, a shadow, a cow, a horse, the rays of the sun, dust, earth, the wind, and fire one must know to be pure to the touch.\"\n- [ Laws of Manu (Manu Smriti) Chap - 5 , verse 133, Translated by George Bühler ]\n\nWell, I think this verse makes it straight, so even according to the Shastras, Saliva fallen on any body, also flies…etc. aren't impure, so why isn't Agniveer found criticising this verse or may be he is unaware? Wasn't he pompously claiming Vedic Dharma (Hindus) to be hygienic? Well, now that's Hygienic Hindusim, anyone who's attended elementary schooling know , the how inhygienic flies are. Flies can be quite dirty and besides contaminating food with eggs and maggots, they can also carry bacteria that cause intestinal diseases. Flies can travel from fecal material to our food very easily, carrying bacteria with them on body hairs or the sticky pads on their feet. When feeding, flies expel saliva and feces that may also contain bacteria. It has been shown that each house fly can easily carry over one million bacteria on its body. Some of the disease-causing agents shown to be transmitted by house flies to humans are: higellosis, salmonella, typhoid fever, dysentery (diarrhea), Escherichia coli, conjunctivitis (pink eye) and parasitic worms.Also we learn that Saliva , falling from mouth of anybody part doesn't render it (saliva and its owner) impure, so why is Prophet's blowing moist on left side, or spitting on cloth to avoid contanimating surrounding , been criticised? Well the anwers is ,bias Hindu minds.\n\n \n\nThis is Pure and Hygienic in Vedic Dharma(Hinduism) =>\n\n\n\nSo does Parashara Smriti say :\n\n\"Running water, while touching the ground, and particles of saliva, flying from each other's mouth, when a talk is held by two persons; and oily substances, that may be left, after having been partaken of as food ; these are never unclean ; so it has been said by Manu. By pouring water to the ground, the half drunk water by other brahmanas become pure\nto be consumed as per Manu.\" [ Parashar Smriti, Ch- 7 Verse- 31 , Translated by KrishnaKamal Bhattacharya, Calcutta 1887. ]\n\n \nAlso , here a nice method is been prescribed to purify the half-drunk water by Brahamans(Priestly caste people), that's by pouring down it to the ground , and again now the water is recycled by the \"Vedic\" method and is pure to be consumed, so here dirty water(as its been pured on the ground which has varying impurities) plus half-drunk(Jootha) water becomes pure, and ready to consume, so this the vedic \"Hygiene\" and \"purity\". So here we learn that saliva flying from mouth , on other is also not impure.\n\n \n\" Dust, fire, a horse, a cow, the shade, the rays of the sun and moon, the wind, the earth, drops of water, and mosquitoes and other insects inflict no contamination though they may have been in contact with what is corrupt. [ Markandeya Purana, Canto 35,verse 21,pg 182 , Translated by F.Eden Pargiter, Published by the Asiatic Society, 1904]\n\n \nNailed!right? This quote from the Purana , is sufficient proof for , the truth seeker to see , which religion preaches and guides towards cleanliness anf hygience , so according to the Purana, Mosquitos,insect,dust,cow,horse are all pure even though they may be defiled by an external contaminated , dirty thing(material ,substance), I think this should sum it up and open the eyes of many, who wish to seek and follow truth. And with regards to the hair of Prophet Muhammad (Sallal lahu alayhi wa Sallam) being preserved in a so-called shrine, then know that they are mere false claims and myths, no one today has any hair of the prophet(though they were considered miraculous as prophet himself was given miracles), this is well know amongst the Muslims and accepted by scholars, but there are some who try to make a business out of it(claims,myths),these are mere claims , and the onus to prove it is on the claimant.Produce your proof!\n\n \n\nQuote :\n\n\n3. No harm in using the water which is infected by dead dogs, menstrual cloths, and body wastes! \n\n\n\nSunaan Abu Dawud, Book 1, Number 0067:\nNarrated Abu Sa'id al-Khudri: I heard that the people asked the Prophet of Allah (peace_be_upon_him): Water is brought for you from the well of Buda'ah. It is a well in which dead dogs, menstrual clothes and excrement of people are thrown. The Messenger of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) replied: Verily water is pure and is not defiled by anything.\n\n\n\nComments: This explains why Muslim countries are among dirtiest places in world and breed dangerous diseases.\n\n\n \nThe hadeeth quoted (Sunan Abu Dawud, Book 1, no. 67) , is talking about a well, unlike well's found in other parts of world, which are usually human dugged , well bricked ones, here the Hadeeth is talking of a well of Buda'ah, which are not human dug but natural , discovered by man, thesee are usually very huge wells, sought og mini lakes..etc \n\nAnd this is what the great Islamic Scholar al-Imam Muhammad Shamsul Haq al-Azeemabaadi commented on this hadeeth saying :\n\n \n\"Basically this is implying that because the well was so huge, such a small amount of impurities will not ruin the whole well\".\n- [Awn al-Mabud Sharh Sunan Abu Dawud, Kitab: Al Tahara, Bab: Ma Jaa'a Fi Ba'ir Bidaa'a, Commentary on Hadith no. 60]\n\n \n\n \nSo, its clear that these wells were very huge that small amount of impurities did not make it dirty or impure just like small impurities do not make a lake impure.I also wonder, in India and other countries, people usually bathe in lakes, pond and also wash their kine(like buffalos, cows…etc) , wash clothes and other things and then use the same water from the lake for drinking , this has been done for thousand of years, I guess Agniveer has acknowledged this fact recently.Infactuality Hindus even throw their dead bodies in the river Ganga(considered Holy according to Orthodox Hindus) and then use the same water for drinking, and other throw ashes after burning the dead in rivers, lakes, ponds and then use the same water for drinking, bathing, I'm pretty sure that Agniveer has recently acknowledge and have come to know about this lately. But what of his \"Hygienic\" Vedic Dharma? \n\n \n\nAccording to the Dharma Shastras too large tanks, aren't defiled by dead animals and small impurities.\n\n\n \n\" For small reservoirs of water and for ponds the same mode of purification has been prescribed as for wells, O Earth ; but large tanks (excepting Tirthas) are not defiled (by dead animals, &c.) [ ( Vishnu Smriti, Ch-23 , verse 46, pg 103, Translated by Julius Jolly ,Oxford , Clarendon Press 1880]\n\n \n\nSo , its clear that even according to the smritis, large tanks are defiles and rendered impure by dead animals and other impure stuffs.This is somehat like shooting in the leg , isn't it?\n\n\n \n\nAlso it will be informational to hindus to know that their Hindu Vedic Predecessors having beign using these materials(Cow hair,tail, Bones,CowDung,..etc) to mark the boundaries of and lands, farms and terrorities..etc.\n\n\n\"And as he will see that through men's ignorance of the boundaries trespasses constantly occur in the world, let him cause to be made other hidden marks for boundaries, Stones, bones, cow's hair, chaff, ashes, potsherds, dry cowdung, bricks, cinders, pebbles, and sand.\" (The Laws Of Manu, Ch 8 verses 149- 150, Translated by George Bühler)\n\n\n \n\nSo does the Brihaspati Smriti states – \n\n\"By such visible signs as these a boundary line should always be caused to be marked; also, by other (marks) deposited underground which the earth is not likely to destroy. Dry cowdung, bones, chaff, charcoal, stones, potsherds, sand, bricks, cows tails, cotton seeds, and ashes :\"\n\n - [( The Minor Books of Law, Part-1 , Brihaspati Smriti XIX verses 4-5,pg- 351 ) Translated by Julius Jolly,Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1889 in SBE Vol-33]\n\n\n \n\nI wonder, why does Agniveer delve into baseless claims and talks like he did in the comment \"Muslim countries are among dirtiest places in world and breed dangerous diseases\"\n\nWell, I guess the above verses prove a lot otherwise! Isn't it? We read in the above verses that the Vedic predecessors of Hindus, used to bury and throw all type of dirty things like Cow-Dung,Urine ,Cow hairs and tails, broken pots(Potsherds) cinders, ashes and bones on the boundaries and bury them to mark boundaries,now this is polluting the environment which they indulged in, still Agniveer alleges muslim countries of being dirty whereas its clearly proven how dirty the vedic civilisation was, which dumped all their trash on the boundaries under the pretext of marking boundaries and called it hidden marking of boundaries,also I do not understand why these trash had to be used as \"hidden\" marks? Can't they use somethig more environment friendly and clean things which did not stink and was pure!\n\nI wonder this is enough to show , who were and are dirty, Muslims or Vedic Hindus?Its clear from the preceding verses, and there are many and many such verses , but this should suffice for the Truth seeker, also I would like to request hindus to be more responsible, concerning Cleanliness of the Soceity and environment, as it seems their ancestors totally ignored it, I would be Optimistic and hope that Hindus don't follow their Vedic Predecessors.\n\n \n\n \n\nQuote :\n\n\n4. Rub your hands on the wall after cleaning your private parts!\n\n\n\nSahih Bukhari, Volume 1, Book 5, Number 260:\nNarrated Maimuna: The Prophet took the bath of Janaba (sexual relation or wet dream). He first cleaned his private parts with his hand, and then rubbed it (that hand) on the wall and washed it. Then he performed ablution like that for the prayer, and after the bath he washed his feet.\n\n\n\nComment: The purpose behind defiling the wall needs deep research.\n\nThe hadeeth quoted is (i.e Saheeh al-Bukhari,vol-1,Book 5, no 260) again this is to be noted that the Hadeeth is recorded in the 5th Book that is Book of Ghusl or Bathing! All the Hadeeth quoted in this Book are related to Bathing and basically sanitary-related activiites, this does explain things.\n\nWhat here Prophet did was use the dust on the walls to rub and clean his hands after he had cleaned his private parts(so that they are cleaned nicely), that is he did not just use water after cleaning hs private parts but also used sand as and cleaning agent, obviosly in those days there weren't soaps and other cleaning agents available.Again this show how much the Prophet of Mercy was carefull about hygiene and cleanliness, he after cleaning his private parts rubbed his hands with dust as soaps and other washing\/cleaning agents weren't available in those times, and then thouroughly wash them with waters.The reason why he would rub his hands with dust, sand or soil is to remove the bad smell left on the hands[this has been expalined\/stated by various scholars for instance Shaykh Sayyid Sabiq in Fiqh us-Sunah – at-Taharah wa Salah], and this again proves the high standard of hygience and cleanliness the prophet followed.Conisely speaking, the reason for using dust,soil was to make sure that the hands is thoroughly clean and that there isn't any bad smell left on the hands which will was very hygienic and impure.\n\n \n\nAnd with regards to the hilarious comment by Agniveer \"The purpose behind defiling the wall needs deep research.\",\nthen its quite noteworthy to point here that the preceding hadeeth (i.e Saheeh al-Bukhari Vo-1, Book 5 no. 259) says :\n\n\n \n\"Then he(Prophet Muhammad) washed his private parts and rubbed his hands on the ground, washed them with water…\"\n\n \nThe Previous hadeeth(no. 259), of the one quoted by Agniveer , quite clearly states that he rubbed his hands on the ground. The wisdom behind using dust is quite understood I guess, and the reason why prophet Muhammad used the dust from the wall is that he did not find , dust and he used the easily available dust, as cleanliness is quite important in Islam, also a point should be noted that 1400 years ago the houses in Arabia were made of Mud , and the walls were of full of dusts, again here agniveer seems to neglect historical facts, to forward his lies.The walls of those times weren't plastered with clay or plaster of paris and then emulsioned with colours, as its now, the walls back then were muddy, with dust and and sand on it.\n\nI guess its again quite evident that Mr. Plagiarist(Agniveer) hasn't done any research or exploration, but simply plagiarised from Islamophobic articles, or how is it possible that he would have missed the previous hadeeth of the one he quoted! Also its hilarious and quite funny , when Agniveer talks of \"deep research\"! Its quite amusing to see Agniveer deceiving his fellow folks(Protestant Hindus) , but I wonder how can he be so fanciful to think he could deceive Muslims?\n\nNow just have a brief look at Vedic Civilization and Hindu Scriptures and the standard of Hygiene it promotes , I promise Agniveer will be astounded –\n\n \n\nEarth,Dust are always Pure and are Purifiers according to Hindu Scripture :\n\n\nManav Dharma Shastra or Manu Samhita\/Smriti or the Laws of Manu , its stated therein :\n\n\n\"Land is purified by (the following) five (modes, viz.) by sweeping, by smearing (it with cowdung), by sprinkling (it with cows' urine or milk), by scraping, and by cows staying (on it during a day and night). \"(Food) which has been pecked at by birds, smelt at by cows, touched (with the foot), sneezed on, or defiled by hair or insects, becomes pure by scattering earth (over it). As long as the (foul) smell does not leave an (object) defiled by impure substances, and the stain caused by them (does not disappear), so long must earth and water be applied in cleansing (inanimate) things.\" - (The Laws Of Manu, Ch 5 verses 124- 126, Translated by G.Buhler)\n\nNow this is an amazing , thing isn't it what great science ! Scattering earth over food purifies it if its defiled by sneeze of a human or hair or insects! This is \"Vedic\" Purification and Vedic standard of Purity Agniveer has been talking of.Well , if earth can purify food why can't it purify body?\n\n \nAlso the Manu Smriti lists down the \"Purifiers\",- \n\n\"The knowledge (of Brahman), austerities, fire, (holy) food, earth, (restraint of) the internal organ, water, smearing (with cowdung), the wind, sacred rites, the sun, and time are the purifiers of corporeal (beings).\"\n( The Laws of Manu, Ch 5 verse 105, Translated by George Bühler)\n\nThe above verse declares earth to be a purifier for various beings,also cowdung!\n\n\n \n\" Dust, fire, a horse, a cow, the shade, the rays of the sun and moon, the wind, the earth,…. inflict no contamination though they may have been in contact with what is corrupt.\"\n[ Markandeya Purana, Canto 35,verse 21](See my refutation to Comments of Main point 2 for full reference)\n\n\n\n\"By earth and water is purified what ought to be made pure, a river by its current, a woman whose thoughts have been impure by the menstrual secretion, a Brahmana by abandoning the world (samnyasa)\". \n( The Laws of Manu, Ch 5 verse 108, Translated by George Bühler)\n\n \n\"Flies, saliva dropping from the mouth, a shadow, a cow, an elephant, a horse, sun-beams, dust, the earth, air, fire, and a cat are always pure. Such drops as fall from the mouth of a man upon any part of his body do not render it impure, nor do hairs of the beard that enter his mouth, nor remnants of his food adherino; to his teeth.\"\n- [ Vishnu Smriti,Ch-23 , verses 52-53,pg 104 , Translated by Julius Jolly ,Oxford , Clarendon Press , 1880]\n\n\n \n\n\"Let them, putting earth on their heads, wearing chaplets (of red flowers) and red dresses, being sworn each by (the rewards for) his meritorious deeds, settle (the boundary) in accordance with the truth.\"\n-( The Laws of Manu, Ch 8 verse 256, Translated by George Bühler)\n\nThe quoted verse from the Purana and Manu Smriti and Vishnu Smritit declare dust and earth to be pure and purifier even if it may be contamnated!And the verse quoted from the Laws of Manu(manu Smriti) the last one, talks of putting earth or dust on head when settling the boundaries of terrotories, farms, lands etc. So what is this called? I think a in-depth research needs to be carried out in order to know why , puuting dirt on head is necessary while settling the boundaries of land?Well this is again shooting in the leg, isn't it(Agniveer has been shooting in his leg from the start of that article, pretty amazing to see it), I wonder if Agniveer had read what his Vedic Predecessors , especially the Sages have derived from the vedas and what the Manu Smriti said, which is considered the most authentic Dharma Shastra(Hindu law books). Well, we learn from the above quoted verses that Earth and dust are considered to be Pure and purifiers in Hindusim so much that they are to be scattered over the food if the food is defiled and this will render the food pure, amazing vedic science.Still , these Hindus try and concot lies against Islam and inorder to malign the Only true way of life(Deen) that's Islam.\n\n \n\nNow coming to walls and defiling them which Mr. Plagiarist(Agniveer) talks of in his comment, then here are few exposures -\n\n\n \n\n \"This Ayodhya, famed thro' the three worlds and encircled by sacred groves, appears to-day to have been shorn of its glory and happiness. The walls are white and have not been smeared with cowdung for some days. The brahmanas that make this city their home, are masters of the vedas and the vedanta; self-restraint, self-control and other attendant virtues crown them with glory.\"\n-          [The Ramayana of Valmeeki, vol. 2,Ch-71 , Ayodhyakanda, pg.321,Translated by C.R Sreenivasa Ayyangar , Dodson Press,1914 ]\n\nWell, I guess the above cited sacred Ithihasa book of Ramayana shows , how vedic hindus used to smear and plaster their home with cow-dung, which is still praticed in the rural India, now this is called defiling the wall.Also the floors of hindu houses in rural India are smeared and covered ans palstered by cow-dung , this is an ancient tradition still in pratice.This is \"Purification\" according to vedic Hindus!Here are few citations which show this so-called Purification tradition in ancient Vedic India and Hindu Scriptures.\n\n \n\"Let him smear a pure and secluded place with cowdung, and carefully make it sloping towards the south.\"\n-( The Laws of Manu, Ch 3 verse 20, Translated by George Bühler\n \n\n\"…The house should be washed with cow-dung and water, mixed together.\"\n- (Parashara Smriti Ch 6, Verse 47 ,Translated by KrishnaKamal Bhattacharya, Calcutta 1887.\n\nAgain quoting Manu Smriti :\n\n\n\"Grass, wood, and straw become pure by being sprinkled (with water), a house by sweeping and smearing (it with cowdung or whitewash), an earthen (vessel) by a second burning.\"\n-( The Laws of Manu, Ch 5 verse 122, Translated by George Bühler)\n\nSo what we read and learn from the above quoted verses is that , smearing, plastering walls , floors with cow-dung is an ancient vedic tradtion which is still prevalent in rural India, and according to Hindu Scriptures purifying a house means smearing and flooring it with excreta, well wonderful purification , this is Vedic purification, but in other parts of world its commonly known as filling you house with excreta if I am not wrong.Its really nice to see the \"practicality\" of Vedic Dharma(Hinduism) .\n\n \n\n \n\nQuote :\n\n\n5. Islamic perfume!\n\n\n\nAsh Shifa (p.35) states that women collected Muhammad's sweat, because his sweat smelled perfume. Asha Shifa continues:\n\n\n\nThe messenger of Allah slept on a rug in the house of Anas and perspired. Anas's mother brought a long necked bottle in which to put his sweat. The Messenger of Allah asked her about this she said, \"We put it in our perfume and it is the most fragrant of scents.\"\n\nHere , the Book quoted is Ash-Shifa by al-Qâdî `Iyâd, the issue with this book has been earlier explained , this book is well-known to be filled with fabrications and false fabricated ahadeeth(Narrations), to say firstly.As now coming to issue of using the sweat of prophet and mixing it then its again plainly a miralce which the people duringg those times witnessed, which is historically indeniable fact.\n\nNow its to be noted that the people were eager to use the sweat of prophet and did so mostly without his knowledge for example its been narrated in Saheeh al-Bukhari :\n\n\"Um Sulaim used to spread a leather sheet for the Prophet and he used to take a midday nap on that leather sheet at her home.\" And \"When the Prophet had slept, she would take some of his sweat and hair and collect it (the sweat) in a bottle and then mix it with Suk (a kind of perfume) while he was still sleeping.\"\n\nSo its to noted , that his fragrant sweat was used, when he was sleeping, and that this is a miracle which humans present at that time had witnessed, its again a proof how a messenger of the Almighty Allâh Azz wa Jall(One True God) , is blessed.\n\nAlso , I don't understand why does Agniveeer have problem with this, that is the love and respect the final Prophet Muhammad received from the people and the Miracles he was given by Allâh Azz wa Jall .When the human written vedas(Hindu Scriptures) holded as \"Holy\" by Hindus and Protestant Hindus declare Cows to be \"Protectors\" of Earth and the Heaven.\n(Yajurveda Ch 33 verse 19,See my refutation of Main point 2 for the full reference)\n\n\nSo whats the problem? Its hard to fathom that while the hindu scriptures declare cow to be \"protector\" of heaven and earth, a hindu is criticising Islam because the final Prophet for the whole Human-kind Muhammad came with miracles , and that his sweat was full of fragrance, which was used with perfume.\n\nI wonder why hindus can have incoherent and irrational beliefs like cows being protectors of the earth and heaven, and that cows,horses and goats possess the qualities of sun and cow- ordure and urine are tranquillity and prosperity, and that being covered in Cow-dung and urine is beautiful ..etc. Then why cannot the extremely rational and coherent belief of Muslims that the Prophet of Mercy Muhammad had many Miracles and that his sweat was miraculously full of fragrance, which is also is a historical fact witnessed by people.Why cannot the God Almighty (Allâh Azz wa Jall) give his prophets miracles? Especially when he's the final prophet for the guidance of Human-Kind. Or is it that according to Hindus and Protestant Hindus God is incapable of providing miracles? So is that the Hindu belief about and his capabilities God? \n\nAlso it would be worthy to quote Mahabharata , wherein its ordered never to have repugnance toward excreta of cow,and should take the names of cow whenever you had a bad dream.\n\n\"One should never feel any repugnance for the urine and the dung of the cow. One should never eat the flesh of kine. As the consequence of this, one is sure to attain to great prosperity. One should always take the names of kine. One should never show any disregard for kine in any way. If evil dreams are seen, men should take the names of kine.\"\n\n- [The Mahabharata , Book 13: Anusasana Parva, Part 2\n,Section LXXVIII , pgs 113 -114,Translated by Kisari Mohan Ganguli, 1883-1896]\n\nWell, I would really like to know , why is it that cow's excreta shouldn't been shown any repugnance,whereas the miraculous sweat which was fragrant of the prophet deemed as impure ? This is again, simply the bias of an hindu which keeps them away from truth.\n\nNow few questions clearly arise, they are 1) why do Hindus deem cows as protectors, and that 2) they (cows) possess qualities of sun as stated in Veda, also 3) why is it that babies covered in mud mixed with cow-dung and urine look beautiful and 4) why is it that none should have any repugnance and aversion for cow-dung and urine? (See my refutation of Main point 2 for the full references of all.)\n\n I would really like to know , when cows can be protectors of earth and heaven, and then cow ordure shouldn't been shown any aversion then , why is the so-called \"Islamic Perfume\" considered by these protestant Hindu ir-rationalist's as something's \"filthy\" dirty? What are the reasons for it? Well, its been recorded that his (Muhammad) sweat had beautiful fragrance , which is a historically true, so comparing this fragrant sweat and cow ordure, urine is like likening dust and diamond. Also, I would like to briefly educate few, about sources of Perfumes, there are many sources of perfumes, like flora (plant) sources in which bark, seeds, leaves…etc. are used to make perfumes and the sources which I would like people to learn about is Animal Sources (Fauna), it seems Agniveer is unaware that thousands of perfumes available today in various markets, have various ingredients and many have faunal sources!\n\nThe few ingredients (sources) used in, perfume making are:\n\n  Ambergris: Lumps of oxidized fatty compounds, whose precursors were secreted and expelled by the sperm whale. Ambergris is commonly referred to as \"amber\" in perfumery and should not be confused with yellow amber, which is used in jewelry. Because the harvesting of ambergris involves no harm to its animal source, it remains one of the few animalic fragrancing agents around which little controversy now exists.\n\n  Castoreum: Obtained from the odorous sacs of the North American beaver.\n\n  Civet: Also called Civet Musk, this is obtained from the odorous sacs of the civets, animals in the family Viverridae, related to the mongoose. The World Society for the Protection of Animals investigated African civets caught for this purpose.[12]\n\n  Hyraceum: Commonly known as \"Africa Stone\", is the petrified excrement of the Rock Hyrax.[13]\n\n  Honeycomb: From the honeycomb of the honeybee. Both beeswax and honey can be solvent extracted to produce an absolute. Beeswax is extracted with ethanol and the ethanol evaporated to produce beeswax absolute.\n\n  Musk: Originally derived from the musk sacs from the Asian musk deer, it has now been replaced by the use of synthetic musks sometimes known as \"white musk\" - [Source -http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Perfume, coloring and emphasis mine.]\n\nSo, we learn that perfumes are made from various sources, and \"excrement\" of animals is one of them, also fatty compounds expelled from sperm of whale is used to make perfumes, well these are facts should be extinguisher for Agniveer's ignorance and bias, as he seems to be unaware of simple and well-known things, it's also interesting to mention that many perfumes also contain alcohol.\n\n \nIt's quite, understood that either Mr. Plagiarist (Agniveer) was unknown of these facts of just hypocritically playing around and maligning Islam. So when perfumes can contain such things which help make them better then why not the sweat of Muhammad which was well-known to be fragrant! Well, if sweat of the Prophet (Muhammad) is considered dirty, where as it was fragrant then what about these perfumes? So are these excrement based perfume pure and clean? If not so why don't I see Agniveer criticising it on his hilarious and non-Scholastic website? Silence is generally considered to be affirmation. Muslims believe that the Prophets sweat was fragrant and people even mixed it with perfume and used it, certain questions arise, 1) how was prophet's perfume fragrant? And a simple answer to it is that this was a blessing of Allah (the Only One True God), and cannot the Almighty God give his messengers certain provisions like this? Why not? Well at least Allah Azz wa Jall can (the Only One True God), as he is omnipotent and every-Merciful. The only problem is with the perception of God of Protestant Hindus, may be their so-called God is believed to be weak who cannot grant or bless people in such a way. \n\n \nRationally, the use of sweat of prophet is justified. When today people use things like \"excreta\", alcohol etc. then why not the sweat of the prophet which was inherently fragrant. And only a bias person can allege Islam, with regard to this.\n\n \nConcisely putting it, the quotation provided by Agniveer only prove the miraculous nature of the final Prophet and the irrational, illogical beliefs of Hindus and their biased nature which tends to be whimsically inclined to follow falsehood. [See other sections where drinking, bathing, and using Cow Urine and Ordure are permitted in Hindu Scriptures, people will be amazed at the double-standards of Hindus]\n\nQuote :\n\n\n \n\n6. Clean your private parts with odd number of stones! \n\n\n\nBukhari 1.162, 163:\n\n\n\nNarrated Abu Huraira: The Prophet said, \"Whoever performs ablution should clean his nose with water by putting the water in it and then blowing it out, and whoever cleans his private parts with stones should do it with odd number of stones.\"\n\n\n\nBukhari 5.200\n\n\n\nNarrated Abu Huraira: That once he was in the, company of the Prophet carrying a water pot for his ablution and for cleaning his private parts. While he was following him carrying it(i.e. the pot), the Prophet said, \"Who is this?\" He said, \"I am Abu Huraira.\" The Prophet said, \"Bring me stones in order to clean my private parts, and do not bring any bones or animal dung.\" Abu Huraira went on narrating: So I brought some stones, carrying them in the corner of my robe till I put them by his side and went away. When he finished, I walked with him and asked, \"What about the bone and the animal dung?\" He said, \"They are of the food of Jinns. The delegate of Jinns of (the city of) Nasibin came to me−−and how nice those Jinns were−−and asked me for the remains of the human food. I invoked Allah for them that they would never pass by a bone or animal dung but find food on them.\n\n\n\nComment: We researched a lot, but find no Islamic Research Foundation (IRF) explaing the mystery behind cleaning private parts with stones, and that too with odd number of stones only. We request our Islamic scientists to unravel the practicality behind this custom.\n\n\n\n\nThe first Ahadeeth quoted is (Saheeh al-Bukharee, vol-4,Book 1, no 162)and the other one which is only cited but not quoted is (no.63) , here I quote both the hadeeth in full.First no. 62 then 63 respectively.\n\n\n \nNarrated Abu Huraira: The Prophet said, \"Whoever performs ablution should clean his nose with water by putting the water in it and then blowing it out, and whoever cleans his private parts with stones should do it with odd number of stones.\" \n\nAnd the next hadeeth , that is no 63 –\n\nNarrated Abu Huraira: Allâh's Apostle said, \"If anyone of you performs ablution he should put water in his nose and then blow it out and whoever cleans his private parts with stones should do so with odd numbers. And whoever wakes up from his sleep should wash his hands before putting them in the water for ablution, because nobody knows where his hands were during sleep.\" \n\nThe Hadeeth no. 63 is only cited and not quoted(on purpose to hide the great standards of prophets hygiene) , as this hadeeth clearly shows how hygienic the prophet was, it clearly lays emphasis on washing your hands before, putting them in water as while a person is asleep he doesn't not know where his hands were, meaning he could have touched his private parts or other areas which could lead in polluting the water , hence he ordered that people should wash their hands before putting them in water.Also we see Prophet Muhammad teaching people to clean their nose thoroughly during ablution , all these facts only proove how hygienic the prophet of mercy Muhammad(Sallal lahu alayhi wa sallam) was.\n\nNow coming to the next hadeeth quoted, it is (Saheeh al-Bukhari vol-58 Book 5, no.200)\nhere's the full text of the hadeeth :\n\nNarrated Abu Huraira: That once he was in the, company of the Prophet carrying a water pot for his ablution and for cleaning his private parts. While he was following him carrying it(i.e. the pot), the Prophet said, \"Who is this?\" He said, \"I am Abu Huraira.\" The Prophet said, \"Bring me stones in order to clean my private parts, and do not bring any bones or animal dung.\" Abu Huraira went on narrating: So I brought some stones, carrying them in the corner of my robe till I put them by his side and went away. When he finished, I walked with him and asked, \"What about the bone and the animal dung?\" He said, \"They are of the food of Jinns. The delegate of Jinns of (the city of) Nasibin came to me–and how nice those Jinns were–and asked me for the remains of the human food. I invoked Allâh for them that they would never pass by a bone or animal dung but find food on them.\" \n\nAll the ahadeeth quoted his this section are quite self-explanatory and easily understandable, I don't find a reason for any problem,as for the questions raised on usage of stones then let me explain it to the people in simple terms.\n\nThe reason why prophet Muhammad asked for stone while Abu Hurairah was carrying a water pot is, to teach people that even without water its possible to get oneself cleaned.This was purely for the educative purpose, as we all know that Arabia is an desert peninsula where people hardly have(and had) water to drink , its only at times when you have water to clean your self or use while lavation.Hence during such times when water is unavailable clean stone could be used as they will help you clean yourself after urinating and discharge of ordure.This showed and informed people another clean way of cleaning themselves, hence it was purely for educative purposes.\n\nSecondly, its to be noted that stones are only recommended to use when you don't have water for cleansing purpose.As back then there were no toilet-papers! Again we see Agniveer neglecting historical facts! So if you don't have water and no toilet-paper or any medium of cleansing your self , what will you do? I hope you don't come out without cleaning yourself! The only way out is using stones,pebbles…etc which are easily available.\n\nAgain we read Agniveer in his fanciful and hilarious comments asking IRF[(Islamic Research Foundation)an foundation\/institute runned by few studnets of knowledge] to explain the so-called mystery of cleaning private parts with stones, I think if Agniveer had used little of his brain and tried to think, or an easy way out was reasearching about it, I am pretty sure that he would have received the answer to the question he had which he now claims to be a mystery, I would like to question Agniveer whether he even knows the meaning of the word \"mystery\" ? Well, it seems Agniveer hates reserching, this is what is apparent from his articles.\n\nNow coming to the question of using odd number of stones then it was an advice\/recommendation of the prophet of mercy, to the people in order to limit people in using stones , for instance he recommended using odd number of stones that is either 1,3,5..etc this was clearly done so that people only use as much they need ,like if they are able to cleanse themselves with \"one\" stone thoroughly then use one or if not one then three which is enough. The sublime wisdom behind this recommendation was to teach people to be frugal in every matter and limit using stone as per need,\n\n\nAlso its noteworthy to point out that this was a recommendation, whereas a human is free to use as many number of stones he wishes , except that he shouldn't be extravagant but be frugal.\n\nAnd and prophet of mercy himself used varying number of stones for instance in (Saheeh al-Bukhari vol-4 Book 1, no 157) The Prophet said\n\"Fetch for me some stones for ' cleaning the privates parts…\" without specifying any numbers or asking odd numbers of stones.Also in another hadeeth the Prophet said to have used 2 stones for cleaning(no.158).So this shows that using Odd numbers of stones like 1,3,5…etc is recommended as we muslims love the Pure Islamic Monotheism. \n\nNow its time to learn about the so-called Vedic Hygiene and standard of Purification which Agniveer , is pompous about, and scrutinise truth.\n\nUsage of Earth, soil for cleaning of Private Parts in Hindu Scriptures :\n\n \n\"In order to cleanse (the organs) by which urine and faeces are ejected, earth and water must be used, as they may be required, likewise in removing the (remaining ones among) twelve impurities of the body\"\n\n -( The Laws of Manu, Ch 5 verse 134, Translated by George Bühler)\n\nUsing of earth and water to cleanse the urinary and other defecating Organ, is prescribed by Manu Smriti in the above verse.And below is a little detailed desccription of this act of using earth to clean your private parts.\n\n \n\"He who desires to be pure, must clean the organ by one (application of) earth, the anus by (applying earth) three (times), the (left) hand alone by (applying it) ten (times), and both (hands) by (applying it) seven (times). Such is the purification ordained for householders; (it shall be) double for students, treble for hermits, but quadruple for ascetics.\"\n\n\n-( The Laws of Manu, Ch 5 verses 136-137, Translated by George Bühler)\n\nSo we read from the above verse that using earth\/soil\/sand to clean your urinary Organ and then the anus 3 times, then by left hand alone 10 times and then using BOTH the hands seven times and this is the so-called \"purification\" and this is for householders where as students have to perform this process double time, hermits treble and ascetics quadruple times , well may I ask why is this inchorent way of \"purifying\" prescribed in ascending order , and what is the crime of petty students,hermits and ascetics that they have been burdened with such hectic,incoherent way of \"purification\" I am sure that the Protestant Hindus will have an scientific answer for this too!Its to be noted that here soil is applied the number of times specified, well I am sure Agniveer was unaware of this isn't it?\n\nNow here's another quote from a Upa-Purana which helps us understand the issue more clearly and gives a clear picture of purification in Vedic Dharma(Hinduism)-\n\n \n\"Then he is to hold his genital organ with his hand and go to a river or any other watery place ; he is to fill his vessel with water then and go to some other place.\nThe Brahmana is to use the white earth, the Ksattriya is to take the red earth, the Vais'ya is to use the yellow earth and the Sudra is to apply the black earth and with that he is to cleanse himself. The earth under water, the earth of any temple, the earth of an anthill, the earth of a mouse hole, and the remmant of the earth used by another body for washing are not to bo used for cleansing purposes.\nThe earth for cleansing faeces is twice as much as that used in case of urine clearance ; in the cleansing after sexual intercourse thrice as much. In urine cleansing the earth is to applied in the organ of generation once, thrice in the hand. And in dirt clearing, twice in the organ of generation, five times in anus, ten times in the left hand and seven times in both the hands. Then apply earth four times first in the left feet and then on the right feet The house holder should clear thus : the Brahmachari is to do twice and the Yatis tour times. At every time the quantity of wet earth that is to bo taken is to be of the size of an Amalaki fruit ; never it is to be less than that. This is for the clearance in the day time. Half of these can be used in the night time… If, out of vanity or sloth, clearing be not done, for three nights, one is to fast,drinking water only, and then to repeat the Gayatri Mantra and thus be purified.\"\n- [Srimad Devi Bhagvatam,Book 11, Ch 2, pgs-1060-61, Translated by Swami Vijananda ,3rd Ed., Panini Office- Allahabad]\n\n\n \n\nWhat the above quote states is :\n\n  A Brahmana(Priestly caste ) should use white earth.\n\n  A Kshatriyya(Warrior caste ) should use red earth.\n\n  A Vaisya(Business caste ) should use yellow earth.\n\n  A Shudra(Servant , low caste)should use black earth.\n\n Different type of soil\/earth to be used by different caste people ,for Cleansing their private parts.\n\n\n \n\nThe following types of earth\/sand\/soil are forbidden to use :\n\n\n \n  The earth under water, \n\n  the earth of any temple, \n\n  the earth of an anthill, \n\n  the earth of a mouse hole\n\n  and the remmant of the earth used by another body for washing.\n\n \nAnd the above quote gives a various numbers , of amount time this process is to be done and the amount of Mud\/earth to be used and all the other detail , I hope this will really be helful to the hindus!.Basically this quote ,from Devi Upa-Purana and the 2 earlier quotes from Manu Smriti, clearly show the extensive use od Mud\/Earth used for cleansing purpose which is prescribed in a very extravagant way.\n\nI would like to query , what is the rational wisdom behind this incoherent use of earth\/Mud\/dirt used for cleaning purpose, that to so extensively extravagantly? I find no rational or scientific basis for such practices.I hope that Protestant Hindus clarify why their Vedic ancestors prescribed such practices and performed them.And its quite amazing to find these hindus criticising Islam and its rational concepts of purification when their own scriptures are fanciful, incoherent and irrational.\n\n \n\nQuote :\n\n\n7.

It was said to him; Messenger of Allah, wouldn't you perform ablution. He said : Why, am I to say prayer?\n\n\n\nBook 3, Number 0728:\nIbn Abbas, reported: The Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) came out of the privy after relieving himself, and food was brought to him and he took it, and did not touch water. In another narration transmitted by Sa'id b. al-Huwairith it is like this: It was said to the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) You have not performed ablution. He said: I do not intend to say prayer that I should perform ablution.\n\n\n\nComments: This explains why many Hindus used to avoid touching Muslims till recently. This has nothing to do with their ideology, but only relates to their hygiene habits which does not require one to wash hands even after excretion. Many sanitized people may vomit even on imagining such a thing. Hindu texts, on contrary, advise for highest levels of adherence to sanitized habits, and this remains a common bond across almost all sects of Hinduism.\n\n\n\nBut are we expecting another fatwa from IRF or Deoband that Muslims are prohibited from washing hands after lavatory, especially when they plan to have food! After all their Prophet used to do so!\n\n\n\n\nThis section or main point is the most ridiculous and hilarious of all the sections from the article , I just don't get how fanciful and imaginative and conjecturable Agniveer is, this section will expose Agniveer and his decpetion, I would really want Hindus and protestant Hindus to see their polemics , deceptive and lying nature and its wonder they call themselves \"Arya-Samaj\" (Noble Society) but infactuality they are \"Anarya-Samaj\"\n(Ignoble Society) which has always indulged in lies and deception and all the immoral acts.\n\nComing to the topic Agniveer, alleges that Islam premits eating without washing hands and that too, after coming out of privy(lavatory,loo), this only exposes his gross ignorance and illiteracy of Islam.All the hadeeth he quotes (i.e.Saheeh Muslim, Book 3,Ch 30 ,nos.725,726,727,728).\n\n\nLet me take this as an Oppurtunity to educate Agniveer and his fellow Protestant Hindus, about Islam and expose the ridiculous allegations of Agniveer.\n\n \n\nLet me first explain what does the word \"Ablution\" means! \n\n\n \n\nArabic language:\n\n\n\"Wudhoo\" is the action and \"Wadoo\" the water used therefore – and it is also a verbal noun; or they are two forms of the same word, both meaning the verbal-noun and maybe both referring also to the water used.\n\n\n \n\nWudhoo(Ablution) in the Sharee'ah(Islam) :\n\n\n\"Wudhoo\"(Ablution) is using clean and cleansing (Tuhoor)\nwater upon certain body parts as Allaah Ta'aala(One True Almighty God) has prescribed and explained.\n\n\n \nWhat Agniveer has done here , is to deceive people into believing that Ablution(Wudhoo) simply means washing hands! Whereas Ablution(Wudhoo) in Islam is a ritual cleansing of certain body parts before praying and touching or reading the noble,holy Qur'aan.All the 3 ahadeeth he's quoted refer to the ritual cleansing of certain body parts(in short ,hands,face,mouth,nose,forearms up to elbow,head, ears, nape and the feets)\ndone before praying, its quite nonsensical of him to consider ritual ablution meaning washing of hands!In all the ahadeeth above the prophet is explaining the companions and people that you need not perform ablution before eating, as they thought it was necessary.\n\nRitual ablution(Wudhoo) is needed when you're to pray or touch, read the noble,holy Qur'aan.Its not mandatory to do the ritual ablution(Wudhoo) for eating, you have to wash your hands thoroughly as it was the practice of Prophet Muhammad(Sallal lahu alayhi wa sallam)\n\n\n \n\nIt is related by Sunan Al-Nasa'i that the Prophet Muhammad (Sallal lahu alayhi wa sallam)\n\"Used to wash his hands whenever he wanted to eat\"\n\n\n \n\n \n\nAnd the prophet also said : \"Whoever goes to sleep without washing his hands from the traces of fatty foods, exposes himself to illness and should blame no one but himself.\"\n- [Abu Dawud (No.3852), Al-Tirmidhi (No.1861), Ibn Majah (No.3267)]\n\n\n \n\n \nSo we see that the noble prophet, always washed his hands before and after eating thoroughly and cautioned people about it.I think this debunks all the allegations and lies of Agniveer.Regarding the washing of hands after coming out of privy then in Islam its mandatory, and earlier in this refutation there many hadeeth where prophet Muhammad himself is described rubbing hands with soil inorder to get rid of bad\nsmell,if any(as in those days soaps… etc weren't available) and then washing the hands thoroughly with water. It's a pity that Agniveer first quotes(in section or mainpoint 4) Prophet Muhammad washing his hands thoroughly after relieving himself, and later in his article(here in section 7) healleges that its permissible in Islam if you don't wash your hands after relieving yourself, what a pity!This confused ,self-contradictory Protestant hindu even lacks the basic skills , and here he is alleging Islam with his funny, fanciful, whims.\n\nConcludingly,in Islam its mandatory to wash your hands before and after eating and also ,after relieving oneself.Whereas ritual ablution(Wudhoo) is mandatory for touching,reading the holy Qur'an and for praying.I hope the readers have understood the difference between Ablution(Wudhoo) and washing of hands which agniveer deceitfully implies to be same thing, how ignorant of him.Whereas the hadeeth(i.e. Saheeh al-Bukharee, Volume 1, Book 5, Number 260), which he himself quotes in section 4 clearly distinguishes between washing of hands and Ablution. This should be enough for any truth seeker and readers, in recognising the deception of this Protestant Hindu,Agniveer.\n\nAgniveer again in a hilarious manner comments \"Hindu texts, on contrary, advise for highest levels of adherence to sanitized habits, and this remains a common bond across almost all sects of Hinduism.\"\n\n\n \n\nLet's scrutinise the claims of this confused protestant hindu, and show our readers the truth of the matter.First lets see the hindu ablution.\n\n\n \nHere is what a Hindu is supposed to do , if while eating, impure things like \"semen\",\n\"urine\",\n\"faeces\" fall on any of his limbs:\n\n \n\"When urine, faeces, or semen fall on a (limb) and when (a limb) is stained (by food) during meals (water should be sipped).\"\n- [(Gautama Smriti , Ch 1, verse 44, pg 180) Translated by George Bühler, Translated by Georg Bühler,Oxford,Clarendon Press, 1879]\n\n \nThis is the \"Vedic\" way of purification!Simply just sipping down your throat little water, renders you pure form impurity like excreta,semen.Or he may touch moist cow-dung and moist earth this alternative has been provided in the Sutras of Apastamba.See here-\n\n \n\"(Or he may touch) moist cowdung, wet herbs, or moist earth.\"\n- [(Apastamba Smriti , Prasna I, Patala 5, Khanda 16, verse 15, pg 59) Translated by Georg Bühler,Oxford,Clarendon Press, 1879]\n\n\n\nAnd this sipping of water is also prescribed in the Vashistha Smriti, \n\n\"If, while occupied with eatables, he touches any impure substance, then he shall place that thing (which he holds in his hand) on the ground, sip water and afterwards again use it.\"\n\n-          [(Vasistha Smriti, Ch 3 verse 43, pg-22,Translated by Georg Bühler,NewYork,1898)]\n\nThe same Gautama Smriti also states that if a person becomes impure while holding something in his hands, he will become pure just by sipping water, without putting the material on the ground.\n\n\"If he becomes impure while holding things in his hands, he shall (purify himself) by sipping water without laying (them on the ground).\"\n\n - [(Gautama Smriti , Ch 1, verse 28, pg 176) Translated by George Bühler, Translated by George Bühler,Oxford,Clarendon Press, 1879]\n\n \nSo all these texts clearly prescribe that, sipping of water without cleaning of the the impurity like urine, faeces and semen will render you pure.Also this is done while eating , I am pretty sure that anyone who hears such a thing will vomit and would feel unhealthy,forget doing this , it can only done by the so-called \"hygienic Hindus\" like the protestant hindus(Arya Samajis) isn't it, this is the vedic method of purification.This sipping of water is also done by the Protestant Hindus, during Sandhya while reciting the mantra(chants,verses) from vedas like yajurveda..etcAnd in his comments Agniveer stated \"Hindu texts, on contrary, advise for highest levels of adherence to sanitized habits\" which is followed by all the sects in Hinduism so this is the high sanitised standard which the Hindu texts advise and prescribe, I wonder if this is even seen as sanitised or not, as all around the world this will simply be labeled as filthy and unhygienic way of purification and eating habits.And this is why clean individuals like to stay away from hindus and their sacrifices and ceremonies , atleast those who didn't knew will from now on will.There are many such verses a few which we have seen till know through out the article, but I think this will suffice any unbiased truth seeker,I hope that the truth seeker and our readers have seen a glimpse of hindu standards of hygiene and sanitation.\n\n \n\n \n\nQuote :\n\n\n8. What to do after seminal emission?\n\n\n\nIf one has seminal emission, but has to perform prayers, and finds no water, what do you do? Simple, strike ground with hands and then wipe face and palms! Refer to the SAHIH MUSLIM hadith given below:\n\n\n\nBook 3, Number 0716:\nAbu Musa said to Abdullah: You have not heard the words of 'Ammar: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) sent me on an errand and I had a seminal emission, but could find no water, and rolled myself in dust just as a beast rolls itself. I came to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) then and made a mention of that to him and he (the Holy Prophet) said: It would have been enough for you to do this. Then he struck the ground with his hands once and wiped his right hand with the help of his left hand and the exterior of his palms and his face. 'Abdullah said: Didn't you see that Umar was not fully satisfied with the words of 'Ammar only?\n\n\n\nComment: Doubt on this practical science of Hygiene - After hands have already become dirty after the emission and rubbing dust, why make face dirty now? Or is it used as a face-cleansing cream? Why not simply spare the face from seminal emission and dust?\n\n\n\n\nThe hadeeth quote by Mr.Plagiarist(Agniveer) is (Saheeh Muslim,Book 3, no. 716) this is a huge hadeeth ,and Mr.Plagiarist has only quoted a part of it excluding the rest of the hadith this again, shows his evil intention and action of quoting out of context and misinterpreting the text.\n\n\n \n\nHere is the full hadeeth :\n\nShaqiq reported: I was sitting in the company of Abdullah and Abu Musa when Abu Musa said: O 'Abd al−Rahman (kunya of 'Abdullah b. Mas'ud), what would you like a man to do about the prayer if he experiences a seminal emission or has sexual intercourse but does not find water for a month? 'Abdullah said: He should not perform tayammum even if he does not find water for a month. 'Abdullah said: Then what about the verse in Sura Ma'ida:\" If you do not find water, betake yourself to clean dust\"? 'Abdullah said: If they were granted concession on the basis of this verse, there is a possibility that they would perform tayammum with dust on finding water very cold for themselves. Abu Musa said to Abdullah: You have not heard the words of 'Ammar: The Messenger of Allâh (may peace be upon him) sent me on an errand and I had a seminal emission, but could find no water, and rolled myself in dust just as a beast rolls itself. I came to the Messenger of Allâh (may peace be upon him) then and made a mention of that to him and he (the Holy Prophet) said: It would have been enough for you to do thus. Then he struck the ground with his hands once and wiped his right hand with the help of his left hand and the exterior of his palms and his face. 'Abdullah said: Didn't you see that Umar was not fully satisfied with the words of 'Ammar only?\n\n \n\n \nFirstly,its to be noted that the hadeeth is clearly talking of a situation when there is no water available, and that too for more than a month! And here is the mercy from the Almighty Allâh Azz wa Jall(One True God), that Tayammum(Dry Ablution) is legislated for us, so as to help us be pure and even when water is unavailable.Analysing the hadeeth quoted , we find that rolling yourself up in clean dust is not permissible, and but what is permissible is the dry Ablution, and here is a brief expounding on it.\n\n \nDry Ablution in Islam :\n\nLiterally \"Tayammum\" means \"aim, purpose\"\nand in Islamic law it means\n\"aiming for or seeking soil (clean dust) to wipe ones face and hands with the intention of preparing oneself to pray and son on\"\n\n \n\nAnd this dry ablution is been permitted by Allâh the most merciful in his noble Qur'aan:\n\n\"O you who believe! When you intend to offer As-Salât (the prayer), wash your faces and your hands (forearms) up to the elbows, rub (by passing wet hands over) your heads, and (wash) your feet up to the ankles. If you are in a state of Janâba (i.e. after a sexual discharge), purify yourselves (bathe your whole body). But if you are ill or on a journey, or any of you comes from the Ghâ'it (toilet), or you have been in contact with women (i.e. sexual intercourse), and you find no water, then perform Tayammum with clean earth and rub therewith your faces and hands. Allâh does not want to place you in difficulty, but He wants to purify you, and to complete His Favour to you that you may be thankful.\"\n- (Soorah al-Maa'idah, Ayat 6)\n\n\n\n\n \n\nAnd this verse from the holy, noble Qur'aan makes it(Dry Ablution) pemissible for muslims to use clean dust, which is indeed a mercy for the human-kind, so as to make easy for them the spiritual and other purification.\n\n\n \n\nMethod of performing Dry Ablution :\n\n\n \n\"Strike the ground with your hands,blow into them(hands) then wipe your face and hands up to elbow\"\n- (Related by Ad-Daraqutni).\n\n\"The Prophet then stroked lightly the earth with his hands and then blew off the dust and passed his hands over his face and hands.\" \n\n - (Saheeh al-Bukhari, vol-1,Bk-7,no.334)\n\n\"The Prophet (saying so) lightly stroked the earth with his hand once and blew it off, then passed his (left) hand over the back of his right hand or his (right) hand over the back of his left hand and then passed them over his face.' \" \n\n - (Saheeh al-Bukhari, vol-1,Bk-7,no.343)\n\n\n \nWe learn that striking your hands(till wrist not forearm) on the ground, then blowing-off the dust from the hands and then wiping your face and hands upto-elbow is know as \"Dry ablution\", this is the method performing it.\n\nPrerequisites\/Preconditions or Situations when Tayammum(Dry Ablution) is allowed :\n\nDry Ablution is only permissible in certain situations some are stated above in the Qur'aanic verse like on being ill wherein using water could severe your illness or cause death, or on a journey where you don't have water.Or due to extreme cold weather(you fear death due to it or fatal sickness)Or to save water for drinking(fearing you go thirsty..etc) due to its unavailablitiy like Imam Ahmad said \"Many companions performed dry ablution to save their water for drinking\"\n\n\nAs for the inability to use water due to an illness or an extreme cold weather, one should bear in mind that the fear for one's health must be certain and not imaginary. The illness that entitles one to perform dry ablution as that which might add to one's physical (health related) injury. However, it does not necessarily mean that it has to be a near fatal illness. When dry Ablution is done because of extreme cold weather, it is allowed only when water may not be warmed up. In present times, hot water is readily available, nonetheless even if due to some reason one is unable to find heated water or heat water for use, he may resort to dry ablution, due to the danger to life.And here is what the great Islamic Scholars has to say in regards to it.\n\nAsh-Shaykh Abd al-Azeez Ibn Bâz said :\n\n\"If you can find warm water or you are able to heat the cold water, or you can buy water from your neighbor or from someone else, then you must use that . . . you have to do whatever you can, whether buying the water, heating it or whatever ways will enable you to do ablution(Wudhoo) as prescribed with water. If you are unable to do that and the cold is severe and is posing a danger to you, and there is no way for you to heat it or to buy some warm water from those who are around you, then you are excused, and dry ablution is sufficient for you…\"\n- (Majmu al-Fataawa Ibn Baaz, Volume #10 – Page #199)\n\nTayammum(dry ablution) a life saver :\n\nJâbir narrated :\"We set out on a journey, and one of us was wounded by a stone on his head. [When he slept,] he had a wet dream, and so he asked his companions, 'Do you see any concession for me to perform tayammum?' They replied: 'We do not see any concession since you are able to use water.' Upon that, he took bath and died. When we came back to Allâh's Messenger (Sallal lahu alayhi wa Sallam), he was informed of that. He said …It would have been enough for him to perform tayammum, or bandage his wound, wipe over the bandage and bathe the rest of his body.\" - (Sunan Abu Dâwud)\n\n \n\nAnd we learn from the above hadeeth that Tayammum could have saved this persons life as in many countries(cold) bathing in old days was quite dangers due to cold, especially when heating measure weren't available.\n\n\n \n\nAnd Allâh the Most Merciful says in his Noble Qur'aan :\n\n\"Do not kill yourselves. Verily Allâh is All-Merciful towards you.\"\n\n - [Surah an-Nisâ´(4):29]\n\n\n \n\n \nHence, we are to save ourselves from being extreme and not be hard upon ourselves , especially when the Most Merciful himself eases difficulties for us.\n\nAgain points which should be noted is that Islam has been revealed for all times and for all people, unlike other regional human-origin religions hence by this we realise that centuries ago in desert areas of the world like Sahara,gobi ,Arabian deserts and elsewhere , it was impossible to find water to drink(which is a fact,for instance in darfur where people don't even have drops of water to drink) , forget of ablution, and in such circumstance what would a person do , if he did not get water for ablution or that water available was only sufficient for drinking or due to extreme cold like in polar regions and in siberian peninsula he was unable to perform the ablution?\n\nWell, Islam is the complete way of life(Deen), which guides you to truth,salavation and bliss in this world and the here-after and here again Islam provides the answer, that is \"At-Tayammum\" or the Dry Ablution as Allâh Azz wa Jall(One True God) does not want to burden us with difficulties as he wants everyone to attain the eternal bliss of paradise.\n\nNow,coming to the certain objections which were implied by Mr.Playgiarist(Agniveer).He states few things, I would like to quote him , he wrote(emphasis mine)\n\"After hands have already become dirty after the emission and rubbing dust, why make face dirty now?\"\n\nA short note, I wonder how did Agniveer conclude that hands had become dirty after seminal emission, I hope Agniveer knows the area from where seminal fluid gushes out or emitted as far I know its not hands!Its also to be noted that the dust which is rubbed on the hands is first blown-off and then the face is wiped, so subsequently there remains no dust on the hands or the face, which is quite evident from the above where the method of dry ablution is described.Even if there is some remanant of dust then know that it's the clean dust which is used for purification, and dust it self is pure and indeed its widely accepted in the scientific fraternity the humans are made of dust , so if using this clean dust is dirty then the humans themselves are dirty inherently as they are made of dust and other contributing elements like iron,fluorine ,silicon,lead,copper , aluminum and zinc …etc\n\nNow coming to the other point ,from the above quote ,we learn that Agniveer holds\/believes that emission of seminal fluid is dirty and so is rubbing of dust, and reason he claims so is because of his belief that dust and semen are impure and dirty, or why would a person call rubbing of dust and emission of seminal fluid as being dirty , if he believed they were not dirty or pure,so the point to be note here is that Agniveer believes that \"semen\" and \"dust\" are dirty and impure.\n\n \n\nBut , does his so-called high sanitised standard prescribing hindu texts believe dust and semen to be impure and dirty?Inshaa'Allah we'll have a look at this.\n\n\nHindu Scriptures state \"Semen\" and \"Dust\" to be Pure :\n\n\n \n\nYajurveda Samhita states \"Semen\" to pure ,\n\n\"O' all learned people fully realise your conduct towards different objects of the universe, know ye the electricity that maintains all beautiful objects, the aged sun, the invisible matter brought into creation, the invigorating vital airs, pure semen and the noble, active suppressor of foes. Thus ye become the utilisers of all objects, and eaters of milk products.\"\n- (Yajurveda, Ch 8, verse 57, pg-90, Translated by Devi Chand\n \n\nAnd in ,\n\n\"May my pervading sun and its heat, my method of eating and dainty dishes, my firm rule and protector, my master and his residence, my mental contemplation and solitude, my mid-breath and strength, my action dealing with electricity and air, and water, my Pran and Udan, and Vyan, my beauty like that of the sun and moon, and of mind, my gait and walks, my pure nature and semen, my spirit of investigation and milk-pot flourish through the proper use of fire.\"\n- (Yajurveda, Ch 18, verse 19, pg-194, Translated by Devi Chand)\n\nWe read that Yajurveda clearly declares \"semen\" to be pure which is just the opposite what Mr.Plagiarist(Agniveer) believes and thus according to him seminal fluid is dirty and a human becomes dirty after ejaculation(well according to Islam after ejaculation of \"Sperm\"or having sexual intercourse, bathing is mandatory but if water is not found dry ablution can be done or after ejaculation of prostatic-seminal fluid it needs to be washed and ablution is to be done and again if water isn't available dry ablution can be done)of it , well it also noteworthy to point that while the \"holy\" veda declare \"semen\" to be pure ,where as Vishnu Smriti states semen to be impure\n(Ch-22 ,verse 81) so does the most authentic and respected Manu Smriti simply states it to be impure and Vishnu Smriti also states the same in( (Vishnu Smriti, Ch-22 , verse 81).\n\n \n\"In order to cleanse (the organs) by which urine and faeces are ejected, earth and water must be used, as they may be required, likewise in removing the (remaining ones among) twelve impurities of the body. Oily exudations, semen, blood, (the fatty substance of the) brain, urine, faeces, the mucus of the nose, ear-wax, phlegm, tears, the rheum of the eyes, and sweat are the twelve impurities of human (bodies).\"\n\n -( The Laws of Manu, Ch 5 verse 134-135, Translated by Georg Bühler)\n\nNow, this is contraditory but its well known that vedas are considered(amongst hindus) the ultimate authority, hence usually their(vedas) position is accepted, another thing to note is again here , the Manu prescribes using of earth(dust,soil) which is considered dirty according to Agniveer.We'll now have a brief look at whether the Hindu scriptures consider dust,earth,soil…etc as dirty or impure?\n\nDust,soil,sand and earth is [always] Pure and Purifier according to Hindu Scriptures :\n\nThis has already been prove in this article(treatise) earlier in many places, nonetheless it will be briefly reproduced here to show our readers that dust, is considered as pure and purifying agent in Hinduism.Full references and full quotes will be avoided until a new verse is quoted, as these verses are previousily quoted completely with full references.\n\n \n\"…dust, the earth, air, fire, and a cat\nare always pure.\"\n\n - [(Vishnu Smriti,Ch-23 , verse 52)\n\n\"….dust, earth, the wind, and fire one must know to be\npure to the touch.\"\n\n - (Laws of Manu (Manu Smriti) Chap - 5 , verse 133)\n\n\"…earth, (restraint of) the internal organ, water…\nare the purifiers of corporeal (beings).\"\n\n - ( The Laws of Manu, Ch 5, verse 105)\n\n\"By earth and water is purified what ought to be made pure…\"\n\n - ( The Laws of Manu, Ch 5, verse 108)\n\n\" Dust, fire, a horse, a cow, the shade, the rays of the sun and moon, the wind,\nthe earth, drops of water, and\nmosquitoes and other insects\ninflict no contamination\nthough they may have been in contact with what is corrupt.\"\n\n - [ Markandeya Purana, Canto 35,verse 21]\n\n\"All mines and places of manufacture are pure excepting distilleries of spirituous liquor; continuously flowing streams of water and dust raised by the wind cannot be contaminated.\"\n\n - [( Baudhayana Smriti , Prasna I, Adhyaya 5, Khandika 9, verse 3, pg 170) Translated by Georg Buhler]\n\nAll the above quotes from the varios Dharma Shastras(Hindu Law Books) and Purana only prove that dust,earth,soil are pure and dirty according to the Vedic Dharma(Hinduism).Infact Markandeya Purana go to the extant that dust is not defiled even if its been contaminated by somethings impure,corrupt.Where as the Vishnu Shastra states that dust is always pure no matter what, and according to Manu Shastra dust is pure to touch and earth is the purifier of corporeal beings, well all these statements clearly contradict to what Agniveer believes.\n\nIn factuality according to Hindu Scriptures earth\/soil\/dust is so pure that it purifies food if scattered over it, and this dust,soil is so pure that during the settlement of boundaries its poured over the heads,see here -\n\n \n\"(Food) which has been pecked at by birds, smelt at by cows, touched (with the foot), sneezed on, or defiled by hair or insects,\nbecomes pure by scattering earth (over it)\"\n\n - (The Laws Of Manu, Ch 5 ,verses 125)\n\n \n\n \n\"That (food) which has been nibbled by a bird (except a crow or other such birds that must not be eaten or touched), smelt at by a cow, sneezed on, or defiled by (human) hair, or by insects or worms, is purified by earth scattered over it.\"\n\n - [ (Vishnu Smriti, Ch-23 , verse 38, pg- 102) Translated by Julius Jolly ,Oxford , Clarendon Press , 1880]\n\n \n\"Let them, putting earth on their heads…\nsettle (the boundary) in accordance with the truth.\"\n\n -( The Laws of Manu, Ch 8 ,verse 256)\n\n \nNot only this but the Shastras(Hindu law books) go further wherein they state that , a student(Brahmachari) will be dust and his teeth will be dirty and that he will speak truth, this is the respect for dust in the hindu scriptures which Agniveer seems to be Ignorant of.\n\n\"A Brahmana declares, ' He shall be dusty, he shall have dirty teeth, and speak the truth.' \"\n\n - [(Apastamba Smriti , Prasna I, Patala 2, Khanda 7, verse 11, pg 25) Translated by Georg Buhler]\n\n \n\nNot only this but even the YajurVeda ask people to respect persons living in sandy places, now this is what was needed , wasn't it? A student to be dusty,respecting people living in sandy places…amazing.\n\n\n \n\"Homage to him who deals in dry fruits, and to him who deals in green vegetables. Respects to him who lives in a sandy place, and to him who lives in distant places. Homage to him who is expert in the knowledge of invisible things, and to him who is expert in the kuowledge of visible things. Homage to him who is skilled in murdering, and to him who gives condign punishment.\" \n- (Yajurveda, Ch 16, verse 45, pg-174, Translated by Devi Chand)    \n\n \nSo , its been well established that dust,soil,sand and earth are all considered as pure in Vedic Dharma(Hinduism), again which is just the otherwise of what Mr.Plagiarist(Agniveer) believes and spreads, I wonder, if according to him anything is pure or not.\n\n \n\nAblution with Cows' Urine in Hindu Scripture :\n\n\nNow , I would like our readers to have a brief look at, the prescribed ablution in the Hindu scriptures -\n\n\"Another son*  stationed in the borders of- the cheeks for 19 half a muhurta, O brahman, consumes every undertaking, and eulogium, and sincerity. By addresses to brahmans, by 20 praise to the gods, and by extracting roots, O brahman, by ablutions with cows' urine and mustard seed, so also by worship paid to the constellations and planets, and also by the observance of righteousness and the Upanishads, by repeatedly looking at weapons, and by contempt for birth Ganda-pranta-rati succumbs.\"\n\n (* Ganda-pranta-rati – the Reveller in the borders of the cheeks.)\n\n - [Markandeya Purana, Canto 51, verses 20-21,pg 259, Translated by F.Eden Pargiter, Published by the Asiatic Society, 1904]\n\n \nThis was the remedy given to people and against, the evil child Ganda-pranta-rati( the Reveller in the borders of the cheeks)of Duhsaha and born on Nirmashti.This is child like other childern(of Duhsaha) is almost personification of physical injuries, moral vices and social offences.In this case , the child Ganda-pranta-rati is stationed in the borders of cheeks and destroyes all the eulogia,praise and other deeds,hence the remedy is provided that is ablutions with cows' urine!\n\n \nAblution with filth and excreta is fair for hindus but with clean dust is objectionable, this is sarcasmm and quite biased approach which all hindus have.Also , earlier I've quoted many smritis which show hindu purificatory methods and penances like in Parashar Smriti(Ch 6 verses 32 – 33) a Brahman(Priestly caste man) is prescribed to purify himself with sustaining on half-barley steeped in cow's urine for 10 nights, in case hw eat food that belongs to Chandala(Outcast) caste.Also in Vishnu Smriti(Ch 22, verse 18) is states that a Sudra(Servile or low caste man) is bathe and drink Pankagavya( the five productions of a cow, consist of milk, sour milk, butter, urine, and cow-dung) if he happen to eat the food of another Sudra who happened to be in impure state.And such penances and purifactory methods have also been prescribed in Manu Smriti and other scriptures, which have been already quote earlier in the article.\n\n \nSumming up, its quite strange that Agniveer's having problem with rational purification concepts and methods in Islam(like using clean dust if water not available) where as his own scriptures like shastras,puranas and vedas are filled with irrational,impractical concepts of purification(like ablution and bathing with cows urine an dung…etc) and statements for instance,respect people living in sandy places in truth respect should given to every one whether he lives in sandy,distant,green places or anywhere else, regardless of his place of living.And still we see people like Agniveer claiming Hinduism(Vedic Dharma) to be practical and Islam otherwise, whereas infactuality its Islam which is practical ,as we have seen so far and Inshaa'Allah will see throughout the treatise(article). \n\n \n","publisher":{"@id":"#Publisher","@type":"Organization","name":"VedKaBhed.Com Fast Server","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"\/wp-content\/themes\/jannah\/assets\/images\/logo@2x.png"}},"sourceOrganization":{"@id":"#Publisher"},"copyrightHolder":{"@id":"#Publisher"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"\/index.php\/2015\/06\/23\/rebuttal-to-agniveer-islam-and-science-of-hygeine\/","breadcrumb":{"@id":"#Breadcrumb"}},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"vedkabhed","url":"\/author\/vedkabhed\/"}}</script>
