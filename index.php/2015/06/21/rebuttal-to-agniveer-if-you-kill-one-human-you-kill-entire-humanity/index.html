<p><span style="color: #000000;">This is a rebuttal to </span><span style="color: #000000;">an</span> <span style="color: #000000;">Islamophobic Hindu who has </span><span style="color: #000000;">an </span><span style="color: #000000;">objection to Quran’s Surah Maidah</span> <span style="color: #000000;">chapter 5, </span><span style="color: #000000;">verse 32 and the name of the article is also based on this very verse.</span><span style="color: #000000;"> The Islamophobic did not stick to the topic but made many irrelevant points which shall all be refuted</span><span style="color: #000000;">. </span><span style="color: #000000;">Before we proceed, let’s read what Quran 5:32 is all about. First</span><span style="color: #000000;">,</span><span style="color: #000000;"> let’s read those </span><span style="color: #000000;">verses in context for a better understanding,</span></p>
<p><span id="more-1270"></span></p>
<p>Quran, Surah Maidah 5, verses 27-32 “And recite to them the story of the two sons of Adam in truth; when each offered a sacrifice, it was accepted from the one but not from the other. The latter said to the former: “I will surely, kill you.” The former said: “Verily, Allah accepts only from those who have Taqwa.”If you do stretch your hand against me to kill me, I shall never stretch my hand against you to kill you, for I fear Allah; the Lord of all that exists.”. “Verily, I intend to let you draw my sin on yourself as well as yours, then you will be one of the dwellers of the Fire, and that is the recompense of the wrongdoers.”) (30. So the soul of the other encouraged him and made fair-seeming to him the murder of his brother; he murdered him and became one of the losers. Then Allah sent a crow who scratched the ground to show him how to hide the dead body of his brother. He said: “Woe to me! Am I not even able to be as this crow and to hide the dead body of my brother” Then he became one of those who regretted. Because of that, We ordained for the Children of Israel that if anyone killed a person not in retaliation of murder, or (and) to spread mischief in the land – it would be as if he killed all mankind, and if anyone saved a life, it would be as if he saved the life of all mankind. And indeed, there came to them Our Messengers with Al-Bayyinat, even then after that many of them continued to exceed the limits in the land!</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>This is the story of Habil (Abel) and Qabil (Cain) the two sons of Hazrat Adam A.S. Habil’s sacrifice was accepted due to his Taqwa while Qabil’s sacrifice wasn’t. Allah describes the evil end and consequence of transgression, envy and injustice in the story of the two sons of Adam A.S, Habil and Qabil. One of them fought against the other and killed him out of envy and transgression, because of the bounty that Allah gave his brother and because the sacrifice that he sincerely offered to Allah was accepted. The murdered brother earned forgiveness for his sins and was admitted into Paradise, while the murderer failed and earned a losing deal in both the lives. Ismail Ibn Kathir further explains this story as, Such is `Isa, son of Maryam. (It is) a statement of truth.) Several scholars among the Salaf and the later generations said that Allah allowed Adam to marry his daughters to his sons because of the necessity of such action. They also said that in every pregnancy, Adam was given a twin, a male and a female, and he used to give the female of one twin, to the male of the other twin, in marriage. Habil’s sister was not beautiful while Qabil’s sister was beautiful, resulting in Qabil wanting her for himself, instead of his brother. Adam refused unless they both offer a sacrifice, and he whose sacrifice was accepted would marry Qabil’s sister. Habil’s sacrifice was accepted, while Qabil’s sacrifice was rejected, and thus what Allah told us about them occurred. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Ibn `Abbas said — that during the time of Adam — “The woman was not allowed in marriage for her male twin, but Adam was commanded to marry her to any of her other brothers. In each pregnancy, Adam was given a twin, a male and a female. A beautiful daughter was once born for Adam and another one that was not beautiful. So the twin brother of the ugly daughter said, `Marry your sister to me and I will marry my sister to you.’ He said, `No, for I have more right to my sister.’ So they both offered a sacrifice. The sacrifice of the one who offered the sheep was accepted while the sacrifice of the other ﴿the twin brother of the beautiful daughter﴾, which consisted of some produce, was not accepted. So the latter killed his brother.” This story has a better than good chain of narration.</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>So this is the context of the verse, now let’s see objections of Hinduvadi.</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">AGNIVEER WROTE:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Now Taqiah is an interesting concept used in several sects of Islam which means that it is fair to use deceit and fraud to defeat the enemy or non-Muslim.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">To know the reality, let us review what the verse actually means as per leading translations and commentaries of Quran. </span>Note that we only refer to authentic Islamic sites and books for reference and not sites of anti-Muslim kafirs <span style="color: #000000;">who are bound to burn in Hell forever! these Kafirs, we shall in any case be spending</span> eternity after Judgement Day! For now, we shall only live in company of those with whom we shall never meet in Hell because they would be enjoying virgins in Heaven while our skins are being roasted in Hell!</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">MY RESPONSE:</span></strong></p>
<p>Agniveer says ”<em>Note that we only refer to authentic Islamic sites and books for reference and not sites of anti-Muslim kafirs</em>” This is the same Agniveer who wrote in another article of his ”<em>You can find more details on abrogation from another kafir site</em>: http://www.islamreview.com/articles/quransdoctrine.shtml” and this is taken from http://agniveer.com/1728/quran-says-there-is-no-compulsion-in-religion/</p>
<p>On the one hand, he claims that he quotes from Muslim sites only and on the other hand he encourages people to learn Islam from anti-Islamic sites. Now it’s upto you people whether you want to be dependent on such deceiver.<br>
Agniveer lacks knowledge, I assume all his articles are only copy paste job that’s why he has no knowledge about Islam nor his own Vedic Dharma. Taqqiya is a Shia theology, as per this Shia concept it is permitted to conceal the faith when one’s life is in danger, in other words, its used to sustain peace and Dayanand Saraswati was the follower of DECEPTION himself, read what Dayanand wrote</p>
<p>“Now it must be understood that if it was the belief of Shankar that God and the human soul were identical and that the world was an illusion, it was not good; but if he had avowed this doctrine simply in order to refute Jainism more successfully, it was a little good.” <strong>Satyarth Prakash, by Swami Dayanand Saraswati, Chapter 11, Tr. Chiranjiva Bhardwaja</strong></p>
<p>So Agniveer is only following the words of his Guru Dayanand Saraswati who permitted lying to defame other religions and also to propagate Vedic faith. If Agniveer was being honest then he should’ve furnished reference from Quran proving his definition of Taqiyya. It’s Hinduism which allows lying and deception, read the article <a href="/index.php/2014/05/14/lying-in-hinduism/" data-wpel-link="internal">Lying in Hinduism</a> and <a href="/index.php/2015/06/25/hindu-god-is-a-cheat/" data-wpel-link="internal">Hindu god is a cheater</a> for more information. Agniveer is being Mayavi (Vedic fraud), Hindu gods like Indra and Vishnu are well known for deceit. Quran prohibits lying and deceit,</p>
[2:159] Those who conceal our revelations and guidance, after proclaiming them for the people in the scripture, are condemned by GOD; they are condemned by all the condemners.
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>According to the Qur’an every pleasure will be available in heaven, Agniveer should see about virgins in his own Vedas and immoralities promoted in his Vedas,</p>
<p><em>Atharva Veda 4:34:2 Bereft of physical bodies, pure, cleansed with the wind, brilliant, they go to a brilliant world. The fire does not cause burning in their male organ. In the world of happiness they get plenty of women.</em></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>Read the article <a href="/index.php/2014/05/15/there-is-indeed-obscenity-in-vedas/" data-wpel-link="internal">Obscenity in Vedas</a> for more information.</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Agnvieer also says Islam is the fastest</span><span style="color: #000000;">–</span><span style="color: #000000;">growing religion because of the virgins available </span><span style="color: #000000;">in</span> <span style="color: #000000;">heaven, If</span><span style="color: #000000;"> people were attracted to</span><span style="color: #000000;"> Islam due to virgins </span><span style="color: #000000;">then Hinduism would have been the fastest</span><span style="color: #000000;">–</span><span style="color: #000000;">growing religion because it</span><span style="color: #000000;"> gives </span><span style="color: #000000;">thousands of</span><span style="color: #000000;"> harlots in heaven and it even</span> <span style="color: #000000;">allows rape (only if you are a B</span><span style="color: #000000;">rahm</span><span style="color: #000000;">in), adultery, loot, murder</span><span style="color: #000000;">,</span><span style="color: #000000;"> etc., refer to </span><a href="/index.php/2014/12/27/hinduism-lust/" data-wpel-link="internal">Hinduism and Lust</a><span style="color: #000000;"> article.</span></p>

<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Now this particular verse appears in different places in different versions of Quran. We are not sure where it actually appears in first Quran that was written 20 years after Muhammad’s death. But in new versions of Quran available today, </span>it is verse 35 of Chapter 5 in some editions and verse 32 in others</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">MY RESPONSE:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Agniveer is </span><span style="color: #000000;">an expert in making bogus</span><span style="color: #000000;"> claims but cannot prove </span><span style="color: #000000;">any</span><span style="color: #000000;">. </span><span style="color: #000000;">It’s actually the Vedas which</span><span style="color: #000000;"> has </span><span style="color: #000000;">been </span><span style="color: #000000;">changed and still</span><span style="color: #000000;"> chang</span><span style="color: #000000;">es with every recent publication</span><span style="color: #000000;">.</span> <span style="color: #000000;">Interpolation in the Vedas is proved by a Hindu scholar Swami B.V. Giri</span><span style="color: #000000;"> on the basis of Hindu scriptures</span><span style="color: #000000;"> in his article </span><a href="/index.php/2014/05/14/hindu-scriptures-battle-of-supremacy/" data-wpel-link="internal">Hindu scriptures battle of supremacy</a><span style="color: #000000;">.</span> <span style="color: #000000;">Agniveer should stop being a Mayavi (Vedic fraud) and should honestly admit that his beloved books have been distorted</span><span style="color: #000000;"> and that only 6% of the original text is available today</span><span style="color: #000000;">.</span><span style="color: #000000;"> But I don’t think he will do this as he interpolates </span><span style="color: #000000;">Vedic</span><span style="color: #000000;"> verses to suit his vested interest, his translation of the Vedas doesn’t </span><span style="color: #000000;">even </span><span style="color: #000000;">match with those of other Arya Samajis which I have proved in my </span><a href="/index.php/category/hinduism/responses/" data-wpel-link="internal">Responses</a><span style="color: #000000;"> and </span><a href="/index.php/2013/06/20/the-fake-translation-saga/" data-wpel-link="internal">The Fake Translation Saga</a><span style="color: #000000;"> article.</span></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">AGNVIEER WROTE:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Sahih International</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Because of that, We decreed upon the Children of Israel that whoever kills a soul unless for a soul or for corruption [done] in the land — it is as if he had slain mankind entirely. And whoever saves one — it is as if he had saved mankind entirely. And our messengers had certainly come to them with clear proofs. Then indeed many of them, [even] after that, throughout the land, were transgressors.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Tafsir al-Jalalayn</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Because of that, which Cain did, We decreed for the Children of Israel that whoever slays a soul for other than a soul, slain, or for, other than, corruption, committed, in the land, in the way of unbelief, fornication or waylaying and the like, it shall be as if he had slain mankind altogether; and whoever saves the life of one, by refraining from slaying, it shall be as if he had saved the</span><span style="color: #000000;"> life of all mankind — Ibn ‘Abba</span><span style="color: #000000;">s said [that the above is meant] in the sense of violating and protecting its [a soul’s] sanctity [respectively]. Our messengers have already come to them, that is, to the Children of Israel, with clear proofs, miracles, but after that many of them still commit excesses in the land, overstepping the bounds through disbelief, killing and the like.</span></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Yusuf Ali</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">On that account: We ordained for the Children of Israel that if any one slew a person–unless it be for murder or for spreading mischief in the land- -it would be as if he slew the whole people: And if any one saved a life, it would be as if he saved the life of the whole people. Then although there came to them Our Apostles with Clear Signs, yet, even after that, many of them continued to commit excesses in the land.</span></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Now several points are very clear from the verse:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">a. This verse is applicable only for people of Israel, and that is why Muslims hate Jews so much!</span></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">b. The Allah of Quran did not know of world beyond Israel, or else the final message of Allah for whole world should have provided message for entire world and not only Israel! Though I appreciate the spirit of fanatics who now try to implement draconian inhuman teachings of this new Quran to entire world, as though entire world is Israel!</span></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">c. The verse provides the conditions of exception. Anyone who is corrupt can be killed. A corrupt person is not innocent as per Islam. So far so good. Even we believe that corruption should have severe punishment. But let us go a step further and see what exactly is </span><span style="color: #000000;">corruption or innocence as per Islam. Tafseer-e-Jalalayn details this — corruption includes unbelief among other variants.</span></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">So in summary, if you are not a Muslim, or you disbelieve in Allah, Rasul, Quran, Angels, Judgment Day, Heaven, Hell you are not an innocent. You are corrupt and hence this verse is no way applicable to you. If you want to be innocent or not corrupt, accept Islam. To further substantiate this definition of innocence/ corruption, let us review the following:</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;">A</span><span style="color: #000000;">) Agniveer</span> <span style="color: #000000;">is deliberately misinterpreting</span><span style="color: #000000;"> that verse and says it</span><span style="color: #000000;">‘</span><span style="color: #000000;">s applicable only for children of Israel, But that verse was not abolished, it</span><span style="color: #000000;">‘</span><span style="color: #000000;">s applicable for </span><span style="color: #000000;">the people of this time also.</span></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The writer should first prove that this verse was limited to the people of Israel and is abrogated for the Ummat of Prophet </span><span style="color: #000000;">ﷺ</span><span style="color: #000000;">. </span><span style="color: #000000;">Agniveer is ignorant of the science and Sharia of Quran and Hadiths. When Allah ment</span><span style="color: #000000;">ions </span><span style="color: #000000;">Children of Israel</span><span style="color: #000000;"> before the advent of Prophet Jesus A.S</span><span style="color: #000000;"> then it is actually talking about Muslims of that time. Those </span><span style="color: #000000;">Children of Israel</span><span style="color: #000000;"> were the Muslims of their time.</span><span style="color: #000000;"> And the Christians of Prophet Jesus A.S time were the Muslims of their time.</span><span style="color: #000000;"> So It is ordained for the Muslims</span><span style="color: #000000;"> a</span><span style="color: #000000;">n</span><span style="color: #000000;">d</span><span style="color: #000000;"> not just </span><span style="color: #000000;">limited to the people of Israel</span><span style="color: #000000;">.</span><span style="color: #000000;"> W</span><span style="color: #000000;">hat </span><span style="color: #000000;">Allah has ordained to the children of Israel is applicable for the </span><span style="color: #000000;">present </span><span style="color: #000000;">believers</span><span style="color: #000000;"> as well, </span></p>
<p>Quran 27:76-7 This Quran settles many issues for the Children of Israel; issues that they are still disputing. And most assuredly, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">it is a guide and mercy for the believers</span>.</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>Agniveer’s statement: “<em>This verse is applicable only for people of Israel</em>…” is revealing his ignorance about Islamic Juristic Laws. It’s not Veda, which can be explained by any Tom, Dick &amp; Harry. It’s Quran which only can be understood by a person who has well knowledge of Islamic theological laws &amp; Juristic Principles, or take help from reliable Islamic sources. I challenge Agniveer Group:</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><strong>“Show me a single authentic Islamic book, which testifies your bogus claim: ‘This verse is applicable only for people of Israel…!'” </strong></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>After these words, it will be better for me to clarify an Islamic juristic law, that is:</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>“When will a verse be specific for people of previous Shari’ah, and when will be generic, or applicable to all Muslims, whether previous or present?”</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>A small student of 5<sup>th</sup>/6<sup>th</sup> class of Darse Nizami (Islamic studies) will tell you that if a law of previous Shari’ah isn’t abrogated by the Shari’ah of Prophet Muhammad (Peace be upon him), it will be generic, &amp; applicable for all. And if it has been abrogated by Shari’ah of Prophet Muhammad (Peace be upon him), it will be specific for those previous people, and won’t be applicable for us.</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>Let me quote some textual evidences from authentic books of ‘Usool-Ul-Fiq’h (Principals of Jurisprudence)’, to quench thirst of thirsty:</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>1. An eminent Islamic scholar, Qur’an exegete and a theologian ‘Imam Abu al-Barakat al-Nasafi (d. 710 AH)’ writes:</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>“The Shari’ahs before (the Shari’ah of) us, are necessary for us (to act upon); only if Allah &amp; His Messenger (Peace be upon him) mention them, without any refusal (or abrogation)…!”</p>

<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>2. A reliable Indian Hanafi Jurist ‘Mulla Ahmad Jivan (d. 1130 AH)’ explains abovementioned text as follows:</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>“And if Allah didn’t mentioned it to us, but it’s found in the Law and the Gospel only, it’s not necessary for us to act upon it; because they (the Jews &amp; the Christians) fabricated the Law and the Gospel very much, and interpolated into it several things according to their own desires. Then, it’s not sure whether it’s from Allah (or others);</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>And similarly, when Allah mentions (previous Shari’ah) to us, after that abrogated it for us, directly as: ‘Don’t do so’, or indirectly as: ‘It’s consequence of their transgression’, then it’s prohibited for us to act upon it…!”</p>

<p>3. A great Hanafi Jurist ‘Imam Zayn al-Dīn Ibne Nujaym (d. 969 or 970 AH)’ writes:</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>“The Shari’ahs before (the Shari’ah of) us is necessary for us, when Allah or His Messenger (Peace be upon him) mentions it to us without any refusal (or abrogation); because it’s also Shari’ah of our Prophet (Peace be upon him)…!”</p>

<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>4. A prominent Indian jurist Imam Ahmad Raza Khan (d. 1921 CE) writes:</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>“The Shari’ah before (the Shari’ah of ours) is also applicable to us, if Allah the Almighty mentions it to us without any denial (or refusal); as evident in the books of Principles.”</p>

<p>(Brackets are from me for better explanation.)</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>Several evidences can be quoted here, but these four will be sufficient for truth lovers. Now, we can take some important points:</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>(1) If any law of previous Shari’ah is mentioned by Allah in the Quran, or by Prophet Muhammad (Peace be upon him) in the Hadith without any abrogation, it will be generic &amp; applicable for all.</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>(2) If a law of previous Shari’ah is mentioned by Allah in the Quran, or by Prophet Muhammad (Peace be upon him) in Hadith, but they abrogated it directly or indirectly, it will be specific for people of that Shari’ah only and won’t be applicable for us.</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>(3) If a law of previous Shari’ah is not mentioned by Allah in the Quran, or by Prophet Muhammad (Peace be upon him) in the Hadith, but it’s only found in the books of previous people, i.e. in the Law (Taurat) &amp; the Gospel (Injeel), it won’t be applicable for us due to concoction in their books.</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>Conclusively, I say:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Only in first condition, it will be applicable for us; and in second &amp; third won’t be. </span></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>From abovementioned explanations by Islamic Jurists, it’s as clear as sunshine that the Law of the Shari’ah of Prophets came before is applicable for us also, until it’s not abrogated by the Shari’ah of Prophet Muhammad (Peace be upon him).</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>Now, Agniveer should tell me where did he get the Islamic textual evidence which abrogated the verse under discussion, and made it specific to Israelites only?</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">B</span><span style="color: #000000;">) </span><span style="color: #000000;">Allah knows the entire universe that</span><span style="color: #000000;">’</span><span style="color: #000000;">s why he sent Messenger to every nation unlike Hinduism which is </span><span style="color: #000000;">confined</span> <span style="color: #000000;">to India itself</span><span style="color: #000000;"> despite having 330 million gods and goddesses, may</span> be their Visa for foreign tour was never approved that’s why they never went beyond India. Moreover, Vedic Dharma talks only about Aryavarta, wasn’t Ishwar aware of countries beyond Aryavarta? If only Aryavarta is special then why did he create other nations in the world?</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">C) </span><span style="color: #000000;">Tafsir</span> <span style="color: #000000;">Jalalayn is grossly mispresented by Agniveer. </span><span style="color: #000000;">First of all, we will se</span><span style="color: #000000;">e</span><span style="color: #000000;"> text of Tafseer al-Jalalayn, what does it actually say:</span></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">“….{corruption} committed {in the land} in the way of unbelief, fornication or waylaying and the like…!”</span></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In this text of Jalalayn, the ‘corruption’ is explained as Unbelief, fornication, waylaying etc as quoted by Agniveer also. But, Agniveer is trying to say that the corruption is only limited to unbelief, and its punishment will be only applicable to Non-Muslims. What a gross accusation! Perhaps, he neglected ‘fornication’, ‘waylaying’ and the likes to prove his narrow mindedness. </span></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Every intellectual person knows very well these kinds of evil indeed are from corruption; some are corruption in the Rights of Creator as Unbelief, and others are corruption in the rights of Creation as fornication, waylaying etc.</span></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Than, what’s the problem with Agniveer in accepting it? Doesn’t he accept unbelief as corruption? If yes, then he should stop spewing venom against Quran; if not, he should tell us if unbelief is appreciated according to Vedic Cult?</span></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">And according to Islam, which type of unbelief is punishable, I will clear it in fifth point of next slander’s refutation.</span> <span style="color: #000000;">In sha Allah!</span></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">And the Arabic word used in the Qur’an for corru</span><span style="color: #000000;">p</span><span style="color: #000000;">tion/corrupt is </span><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Fasad</em></span><span style="color: #000000;">, </span><span style="color: #000000;">the meaning of corruption is </span><span style="color: #000000;">all kinds of </span><span style="color: #000000;">evil, immoral, something </span><span style="color: #000000;">which has errors or unreliable,</span> <span style="color: #000000;">the </span><span style="color: #000000;">Arabic word F</span><span style="color: #000000;">asad translates into corruption, unlawful warfare, or crimes against law</span><span style="color: #000000;">. </span><span style="color: #000000;">So</span><span style="color: #000000;">its a </span><span style="color: #000000;">law against crime,</span><span style="color: #000000;"> if Agniveer does not agree with </span><span style="color: #000000;">this</span><span style="color: #000000;"> verse then he should </span><span style="color: #000000;">start living </span><span style="color: #000000;">in </span><span style="color: #000000;">a </span><span style="color: #000000;">cave </span><span style="color: #000000;">or forest</span><span style="color: #000000;"> because every </span><span style="color: #000000;">civilized nation</span><span style="color: #000000;"> p</span><span style="color: #000000;">unishes the pers</span><span style="color: #000000;">on who breaks the law.</span><span style="color: #000000;"> Now forget about waging war against god or the believers, Vedic Ishwar tells to kill person who just hates him,</span> <span style="color: #000000;">Agniveer’s most beloved books Vedas calls </span><span style="color: #000000;">for </span><span style="color: #000000;">the </span><span style="color: #000000;">death of t</span><span style="color: #000000;">he persons who oppose god, </span><span style="color: #000000;">the V</span><span style="color: #000000;">edas says to burn the enemy, to pierce rod</span><span style="color: #000000;">,</span><span style="color: #000000;"> etc</span><span style="color: #000000;">.,and no mercy is shown by Ishwar, </span></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.103.6 “To him, who is the performer of all deeds, the possessor and giver of strength, the truly powerful Lord, we offer devotional prayers. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">He a highwayman, snatches wealth from the godless exploiters</span> and gives it to honest devotees.” Tr. SatyaPrakashSaraswati</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>Rig Veda 9.13.9 “May you (O love divine), the beholder of the path of enlightenment, purifying our mind and<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">destroying the infidels who refuse to offer worship</span>, come and stay in the prime position of the eternal sacrifice.” Tr. SvamiSatya Prakash Sarasvati</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>Rig Veda 2.23.4 ”O God and learned person! you take the people to the target through the path of religion and justice and protect them. If you commit a sin, the soul or God is not infested with it. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Those who denounce the Vedas and God, you cast your anger on them</span>. Therefore, we should admire your greatness.” Tr. Acharya Dharma Deva VidyaMartanda (Arya Samaj).</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>Rig Veda 3.53.21 ”O resplendent Lord, brave and opulant, protect us this day against our foes with many and excellent defences, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">may the vile wretch who hates us fall before us; May the breath of life depart from him whom we hate</span>.” Tr.Svami Satya Prakash Sarasvati</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">So this is the reason this Arya Samaji is having </span><span style="color: #000000;">a </span><span style="color: #000000;">problem with punishing people for committing crime</span><span style="color: #000000;">s</span><span style="color: #000000;"> because his Vedas promotes murder of non Hindus</span><span style="color: #000000;"> and looting them</span><span style="color: #000000;">. </span><span style="color: #000000;">The</span><span style="color: #000000;"> Qur’an does command to kill or crucify the person who brings corruption</span><span style="color: #000000;">/mischief</span><span style="color: #000000;"> on the land but one should not forget what Holy Qur’an says </span></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
[5:33] The just retribution for those who fight GOD and His messenger, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">and commit horrendous crimes</span>, is to be killed, or crucified, or to have their hands and feet cut off on alternate sides, or to be banished from the land. This is to humiliate them in this life, then they suffer a far worse retribution in the Hereafter.
<p><span style="color: #000000;">[17:33] You shall not kill any person – for GOD has made life sacred – except in the course of justice. If one is killed unjustly, then we give his heir authority to enforce justice. Thus, he shall not exceed the limits in avenging the murder; he will be helped.</span></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">And the Qur’an does not command to fight but fighting is allowed</span><span style="color: #000000;"> only</span><span style="color: #000000;"> in self defense</span><span style="color: #000000;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">[025:068</span><span style="color: #000000;">-9</span><span style="color: #000000;">] They never implore beside GOD any other god, nor do they kill anyone – for GOD has made life sacred – except in the course of justice. Nor do they commit adultery. Those who commit these offenses will have to pay.</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;">Retribution is doubled for them on the Day of Resurrection</span><span style="color: #000000;">, and they abide therein humiliated.</span></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">This verse says who attacks a person first and kills</span><span style="color: #000000;">,</span><span style="color: #000000;"> then his punishment is doub</span><span style="color: #000000;">led on the day of resurrection.</span></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">AGNIVEER</span><span style="color: #000000;">:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">1. Refer </span></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The mullah, a very eminent one, claims very clearly that a non-Muslim is not innocent and whatever a Muslim does, including terrorism, cannot be condemned by another Muslim. That is why Zakir</span> <span style="color: #000000;">Naik never condemns Osama Bin Laden.</span></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">2. Zakir</span> <span style="color: #000000;">Naik himself answers a question stating that if non-Muslims are perturbed because they are called Kafirs, they should embrace Islam. Refer his book on Common Questions non-Muslims ask about Muslims. Whole of Quran is full of treatment to be meted out to Kafirs and the are further elaborated by Hadiths. We shall provide some excerpts here itself.</span></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">3. The very next verse from same Surah 5 (Verse 33 in Sahih</span> <span style="color: #000000;">Internationl version) explains the context of the previous verse. It says:</span></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">“Indeed, the penalty for those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger and strive upon earth [to cause] corruption is none but that they be killed or crucified or that their hands and feet be cut off from opposite sides or that they be exiled from the land. That is for them a disgrace in this world; and for them in the Hereafter is a great punishment,”</span></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The Tafseer-e-Jalalyn only elaborates upon this meaning more brutally and readers can check out for themselves from </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111119154315/http:/truthofhinduism.com/rebuttals/answering-agniveer/rebuttal-to-if-you-kill-innocent-you-kill-entire-humanity/www.quran.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right"><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #0000ff;">www.quran.com</span><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a><span style="color: #000000;">. The intent is clear — if you are corrupt (as per Islamic definition), or oppose Allah/ messsenger, you would be punished in most brutal manner. I would have wished that a book of peace would have emphasized more on forgiving and not the punishments that would be meted out if you do not yield.</span></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Thus the very verse which is cited as verse of Peace by Zakir</span> <span style="color: #000000;">Naik and ShShShahrukh Khan are actually verses of blackmail and threat.</span></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">4. </span><span style="color: #000000;">Some Muslims may argue that corruption does not include disbelief in Allah/ Muhammad but only publicly mischievous activities</span><span style="color: #000000;">. Our counter-question would be to show one single verse from entire Quran that explicitly says that non-Muslims or disbelievers are to be </span><span style="color: #000000;">treated equally and that disbelief is not the gravest crime. In fact, huge number of verses exist which claim that disbelief is the worst punishment.</span></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">5. As per fanatic version of Islam propagated by new Quran, Allah would forgive anything but not disbelief in Allah/Rasul/Quran etc. If peaceful disbelief is indeed innocence and not corruption, why would Allah punish peaceful innocents forever in Hell fire?</span></p>

Because it suits Agniveer’s narrative.</span> <a href="/index.php/2016/04/24/muslims-condemn-terrorism/" data-wpel-link="internal">Here’s a list</a><span style="color: #000000;"> of Muslim scholars who have condemned terrorism.</span><br>
<span style="color: #000000;">If Agniveer is ignorant of ‘the Letter to Baghdadi’, it’s not our mistake. Let me tell you further:</span></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">It’s an open letter to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the ISIS </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #000000;">as a theological refutation of the practices of ISIS.</span><span style="color: #000000;"> It’s signed by numerous Muslim theologians, lawmakers and community leaders.</span></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #000000;">The letter includes a technical point-by-point refutation of ISIS’s actions.</span><span style="color: #000000;"> It will tell you We Muslims unanimously condemned ISIS, and our scholars issued Fatwas against their Cruelty. But a blind can’t see. Alas! </span></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">This Letter was signed </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #000000;">by 126 Islamic Personalities of highest eminence</span><span style="color: #000000;"> on 19th</span><span style="color: #000000;"> September 2014 CE (24th Dhul-Qa</span><span style="color: #000000;">’da 1435 AH), entitled: </span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;">If </span><span style="color: #000000;">Agniveer is still wandering blindly in rebellion he should meet a psychiatrist nearby.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;">So cherry</span><span style="color: #000000;">–</span><span style="color: #000000;">picking lecture of some cleric to support your claim won’t work and isn’t wise. </span><span style="color: #000000;">And how would Agniveer justify this Hindutvadis act who is commanding all Hindus to kill non Hindus and wipe all non Hindus out of India </span><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnV4KwqUxME" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnV4KwqUxME<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;">And also</span><span style="color: #000000;"> a</span><span style="color: #000000;"> list of atrocities and hate speeches against minorities by so called Tolerant people,</span></p>

<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">2)</span></strong><span style="color: #000000;"> This is such a baseless </span><span style="color: #000000;">and </span><span style="color: #000000;">irrelevant point, We have read whether it is Quran or Vedas which is full of hatred towards disbelievers, leave aside disbelievers the Vedas even discriminates its own Shudras. Kafir is not an abusive word, It just means disbeliever. Quran doesn’t use racist, abusive words to refer to disbelievers like the Vedas and other Hindu texts does which </span><span style="color: #000000;">uses derogatory words to refer to non Hindus such as </span><span style="color: #000000;">Asura (demon used to refer to Zoroastrians), Maleccha which means Barbarians and is used to refer to foreigners </span><span style="color: #000000;">and Muslims, Achoot (Untouchable) for lower caste.</span></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">3)</span></strong><span style="color: #000000;"> I have</span><span style="color: #000000;"> already refuted this claim but let me explain those misinterpreted verses again, </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">5:33</span><span style="color: #000000;"> The just retribution for </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">those who </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">fight</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> GOD and His messenger</span><span style="color: #000000;">, </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">and commit horrendous crimes</span><span style="color: #000000;">, is to be killed, or crucified, or to have their hands and feet cut off on alternate sides, or to be banished from the land. This is to humiliate them in this life, then they suffer a far worse retribution in the Hereafter. </span></p>
<p>Just because his Vedas promotes plunder, theft, rape, murder, prostitution so he feels insecure with Quran commanding to punish criminals, any person with a sane mind would agree to what verse 5:52 is saying. Agniveer also writes that “<span style="color: #000000;"><em>I would have wished that a book of peace would have emphasized more on forgiving and not the punishments</em></span><span style="color: #000000;">.”</span><br>
<span style="color: #000000;"><br>
Well this is what happens when you do the copy paste job, the next verse says,</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">[5:34] </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Except for those who repent</span> before they fall into your power: in that case, know that Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">This verse clearly says ‘’</span><span style="color: #000000;">The just retribution </span>for those who fight GOD and His messenger<span style="color: #000000;">, </span>and commit horrendous crimes<span style="color: #000000;">, is to be killed</span><span style="color: #000000;">”</span></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Agniveer is sympathizing criminals and terrorists who </span><span style="color: #000000;">commit horrendous crimes and wage war against religion</span><span style="color: #000000;"> and its people</span><span style="color: #000000;">. Is it bad to punish those who fight</span><span style="color: #000000;"> you</span><span style="color: #000000;"> just because of your religion</span><span style="color: #000000;"> or to punish criminals? I</span><span style="color: #000000;">s it a crime to defend yourself from such criminals? </span><span style="color: #000000;">But</span><span style="color: #000000;"> why didn’t Agniveer quote the T</span><span style="color: #000000;">afsirs? Let me do it for Agniveer,</span></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Tafsir al Jalalayn</span> <span style="color: #000000;">“</span><span style="color: #000000;">Truly the only requital of those who fight against God and His Messenger, </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">by fighting against Muslims, and hasten about the earth to do corruption there</span><span style="color: #000000;">, by waylaying, is that they shall be slaughtered, or crucified, or have their hands and feet cut off on opposite sides, that is, their right hands and left feet, or be banished from the land”</span></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">So this is the context of this verse which is misinterpreted by Agniveer. </span><span style="color: #000000;">Vedas talks about killing people who just hated Ishwar, </span></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Atharva Veda 10.5.15 “…By him we attack on him who hates us and whome we abhor. We overthrow and slay him through this knowledge, through this act and through this fatal weapon.” Tr. VaidyanathShastri</span></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Athar</span><span style="color: #000000;">va</span><span style="color: #000000;"> Veda 13:1:29 May conquering Agni, conqueror of all, </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">destroy mine enemies</span><span style="color: #000000;">. Through Agni we </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">smite down in death and burn the foeman who attacketh me.</span></p>
<p>His beloved Ishwar is not so merciful that he doesn’t even forgive those who hate him, maybe it’s time for Agniveer to quit his Vedic dharm. Vedas promotes violence of all kinds, read articles <a href="/index.php/2014/05/15/killing-infidels-in-vedas/" data-wpel-link="internal">Killing infidels in Vedas</a> and <a href="/index.php/2014/01/01/vedas-and-world-peace-part-2/" data-wpel-link="internal">Vedas and world peace part 2</a>.</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">4)</span> </strong><span style="color: #000000;">The verse nowhere talks about carrying out attacks on non-Muslims for absolutely no</span><span style="color: #000000;"> reason. I notice at every step Agniveer always tries his best to prove specification of </span><span style="color: #000000;">such verses for non-Muslims. Alas!</span><span style="color: #000000;"> he fails at every moment. Let me clarify again: </span></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>This verse indicates that it is binding on the state to eliminate those who terrorise society through militancy and violence, irrespective of their faith that they claim to uphold. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Imam al-Tabari and Ibn Kathīr reported that Sa’id ibn Musayyab, Mujahid, Ata, al-Hasan al-Basri, Ibrahim al-Nakha’i and Dahhak all shared the same position. Imam al-Suyūṭī narrated the same view in “al-Durr al-Manthur”. Imam al-Qurtubi mentioned in his exegesis that this verse was revealed in connection with a group in the time of the Prophet (Peace be upon him).</span> They murdered peaceful people and plundered wealth, and in turn received a severe punishment. This verse also indicates that capital punishment is lawful. Qazi Thanaullah Usmani Panipati wrote:</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>“They [the jurists] concurred that ‘those who wage war and sow corruption in the earth’ mentioned in the verse are the brigands, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">whether they are Muslims or from the non-Muslim citizens.</span> They also agreed that the one who takes up arms for the purpose of spreading fear on the roads outside of the urban areas—as no help can reach there—is an unlawful combatant [muharib] and brigand who is subject to the rulings contained in this verse. . . . Al-BaghawÏ said, ‘Those who rebel within the urban areas are also subject to the ruling contained in this verse’.”</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Now, </span><span style="color: #000000;">who should be reliable regarding clarification of the verses, </span><span style="color: #000000;">abovementioned prominent Islamic exegetes </span><span style="color: #000000;">or Agniveer who even doesn’t</span><span style="color: #000000;"> know</span><span style="color: #000000;"> A B C D of Quranic </span><span style="color: #000000;">eloquence? </span></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Further, </span><span style="color: #000000;">Syed Abu Ala al Maududi defines the </span><span style="color: #000000;">word ‘Land’ i</span><span style="color: #000000;">n verse 5:33</span><span style="color: #000000;"> in his commentary</span><span style="color: #000000;"> as:</span></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">“</span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Here “the </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">land” refers to that country or</span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;"> territory in which the maintenance of law and order is the responsibility of the Islamic State</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">“to wage war against Allah and His Messenger” is to wage war against the righteous system of government established by the Islamic State</span>. <span style="color: #000000;">As Allah likes that such a system of government should be established, He sent His Messenger to establish an equitable system of government, which should guarantee peace and justice to human beings, animals, trees, vegetation and everything in the earth, which may enable human beings to develop to -the fullest their natural capabilities; which should exploit natural resources of the earth for the true progress and improvement of humanity and not for its destruction. It is obvious that any attempt, big or small, to undermine or overthrow such an established system, is in reality a war against Allah and His Messenger. It does not make any difference whether that mischief is created by criminals and murderers who cause disorder in the settled and peaceful society, or by armed forces who attempt to overthrow the Islamic State and establish some corrupt un-lslamic system instead. And every sovereign treats such a violation directed against his authority or against any of his officials as wa</span><span style="color: #000000;">r against himself.</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #000000;">An abstract of these alternative punishments has been given so That the judge or the ruler may exercise his discretion and award punishment according to the nature and extent of the crime</span><span style="color: #000000;">. The real object is to show that any attempt by any person residing in the Islamic State, to overthrow its government is high treason and </span><span style="color: #000000;">a most heinous crime, and that the offender is liable to be awarded any of these capital punishments according to the circumstance.</span><span style="color: #000000;">”</span></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Almost every Tafsir has described </span><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Fasad</em></span> <span style="color: #000000;">in this verse as </span><span style="color: #000000;">a</span><span style="color: #000000;">ll kinds of</span> <span style="color: #000000;">crime. </span><span style="color: #000000;">Even if I agree to </span><span style="color: #000000;">what Agniveer says then why does</span><span style="color: #000000;"> Allah prescribe different punishment</span><span style="color: #000000;">s</span><span style="color: #000000;"> for the same crime called Unbelief in Allah/Messenger? Moreover</span><span style="color: #000000;">,</span><span style="color: #000000;"> Qur’an prescribes to treat non-Muslims justly and kindly,</span></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">[060:008] </span>Allah does not forbid you to be just and righteous towards those who did not go into battle against you (over matters of faith), and did not expel you from your homes. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Deal with them justly. Allah loves those who are just</span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #000000;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">This ve</span><span style="color: #000000;">rse commands Muslim to be Just and Kind</span><span style="color: #000000;"> with those </span><span style="color: #000000;">non-Muslims </span><span style="color: #000000;">who do not fight you</span><span style="color: #000000;"> on religion</span><span style="color: #000000;"> and Allah loves the people who are just.</span></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">[006:108] </span>And insult not those whom they (disbelievers) worship besides Allah<span style="color: #000000;">, lest they insult Allah wrongfully without knowledge. Thus We have made fairseeming to each people its own doings; then to their Lord is their return and He shall then inform them of all that they used to do.</span></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">This verse says M</span><span style="color: #000000;">uslims not to </span><span style="color: #000000;">abuse the </span><span style="color: #000000;">deities of </span><span style="color: #000000;">idolators who</span><span style="color: #000000;">m they</span><span style="color: #000000;"> worship</span><span style="color: #000000;"> beside</span><span style="color: #000000;">s</span><span style="color: #000000;"> Allah.</span></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">[3:113-114] Not all of them are alike: Of the People of the Book [Jews and Christians] are a portion that stand (For the right): They rehearse the Signs of God all night long, and they prostrate themselves in adoration. They believe in God and the Last Day; they enjoin what is right, and forbid what is wrong; and they hasten (in emulation) in (all) good works: </span>They are in the ranks of the righteous.</p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;">I </span><span style="color: #000000;">can quote many such verses</span><span style="color: #000000;">, s</span><span style="color: #000000;">o Agniveer’s </span><span style="color: #000000;">(so called) </span><span style="color: #000000;">challenge has been answered</span><span style="color: #000000;">. A</span><span style="color: #000000;">gniveer has mistranslated</span><span style="color: #000000;"> Surah al Maidah verse from ”If you kill one </span><strong><span style="color: #000000;">person/soul</span></strong><span style="color: #000000;">” to ”if you kill one </span><strong><span style="color: #000000;">innocent</span></strong><span style="color: #000000;">” to make his point, he cannot even name us one translator who ha</span><span style="color: #000000;">s</span><span style="color: #000000;"> translated it has ”innocent”, The next line of this verse clarifies who is liable to be killed </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #000000;">”unless it be for murder or for spreading mischief in the land</span><span style="color: #000000;">” so a person who murders and brings corruption on the land can be killed</span><span style="color: #000000;"> by the authority</span><span style="color: #000000;">.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">5)</span></strong><span style="color: #000000;">And the verse number is? If he is making a claim then he is supposed to furnish the reference. </span><span style="color: #000000;">If Allah has given us the true path and a way to follow it we humans should do that if (s)he doesn’t do that than (s)he is going against Allah</span><span style="color: #000000;">. It is mentioned in Quran</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">[10:44] </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Verily Allah will not deal unjustly with man in aught: it is man that wrongs his own soul</span><span style="color: #008000;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">[2:281] And fear the Day when ye shall be brought back to Allah. Then shall every soul be paid what it earned, </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">and none shall be dealt with unjustly.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">[3:113-114] Not all of them are alike: Of the People of the Book [Jews and Christians] are a portion that stand (For the right): They rehearse the Signs of God all night long, and they prostrate themselves in adoration. They believe in God and the Last Day; they enjoin what is </span><span style="color: #000000;">right, and forbid what is wrong; and they hasten (in emulation) in (all) good works: </span>They are in the ranks of the righteous.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Allah forgives everything including Shirk (Disbelief in Allah) if the sinner </span><span style="color: #000000;">sincerely </span><span style="color: #000000;">repents</span><span style="color: #000000;"> before his death</span><span style="color: #000000;">.</span><span style="color: #000000;"> Even if a believer commits sins then he will be punished for his sins, that’s the reason Allah reiterates in many verses of the Quran that those who believe and do good will be admitted to paradise.</span> <span style="color: #000000;">What about the Vedic God who rejects those who does not worship him</span><span style="color: #000000;">?</span></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Rig Veda 6.44.11 “Give us not, O showerer of benefits, to the wicked. Relying upon your friendship, O Lord of riches, may we remain unharmed. Many are the boons you distribute amongst men; may you demolish those who make no libation, and root out those who present no offerings.” Tr. </span><span style="color: #000000;">Svami</span><span style="color: #000000;">Satya</span><span style="color: #000000;"> Prakash Sarasv</span><span style="color: #000000;">ati</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Rig </em></span><span style="color: #000000;">Veda 6:47:17 He loves no more the men he loved aforetime: he turns and moves away allied with others. Rejecting those who disregard his worship</span><span style="color: #000000;">.</span></p>
<p>Is Agniveer aware of punishment to Malecchas (Non Hindus) inflicted by Ved Vaani just for rejecting Vedas? If yes then he shouldn’t be questioning it.</p>
<p>Now, let me teach Agniveer some laws of Islamic Governance:</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Peaceful</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> unbelief isn’t punishable in Islamic state</span>, as Agniveer team tried their best to prove it. Alas! Success turned its face from their lies. According to Islamic Juristic Law, non-Muslims can be divided into three categories:</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>1. Dhimmī (ذِمّي)</p>
<p>2. Mustaʾmin (مُسْتَأْمِن)</p>
<p>3. Harbi (حَرْبِي‎)</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>1. Dhimmī: This term refers to non-Muslims living in an Islamic state with legal protection. Also called ‘Ahl aḏ-ḏimmah/dhimmah (أهل الذمة)’. The word literally means ‘protected person’, referring to the state’s obligation under Shari’ah to protect the individual’s life, property, and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">freedom of religion</span>, in exchange for loyalty to the state and payment of the Jizyah tax, which complemented the zakat, or obligatory alms, paid by the Muslim subjects.</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>2. Mustaʾmin: This term refers to a non-Muslim foreigner who only temporarily resides in Muslim lands (Dar al-Islam) via a short-term safe-conduct (aman mu’aqqat) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">which affords the Musta’min the protected status of Dhimmīs without having to pay the Jizyah tax.</span></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>3. Harbi: It refers to a non-Muslim, who does not live under the condition of the dhimma. Harbi is counterterm to dhimmī. In other words a person belonging to the territory of war against Islam; he is in war against Islam every moment, by any form of war. He is combatant.</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>Now the conclusive point is:</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>First &amp; Second are Mu’ahad (a person who is granted the pledge of protection by the Muslims), and third is combatant because he is in war against Islamic State.</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>Now, see the rights of Mu’ahad (Dhimmī &amp; Mustaʾmin non-Muslims) as recorded in:</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>Sahih Bukhari Hadith no. 3166, also in Ibne Maja Hadith No. 2686 &amp; 2687, Beloved Prophet Muhammad (Peace be upon him) says about the protection of Mu’ahad Non-Muslims:</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>“Whoever killed a Mu’ahad (a person who is granted the pledge of protection by the Muslims) shall not smell the fragrance of Paradise though its fragrance can be smelt at a distance of forty years (of traveling).”</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>Abu Dawud Hadith no. 2760, Nasaai Hadith no. 4747, Ahmad Hadith no. 20377 and Darimi Hadith no. 2546:</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>“Any Muslim who unjustly kills a non-Muslim with whom there is a peace treaty [mu’ahad], God will make Paradise forbidden for him.”</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>A similar Hadith, in regard to the status of the dhimmīs, is mentioned by Dr. Wahbah al-Zuḥaylī (1998) in his “ʾĀthar al-ḥarb fī l-fiqh al-Islāmī: dirāsah muqārinah”, Dār al-Fikr (Damascus), Pg. 708; Prophet Muhammad (Peace be upon him) said:</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>“Whoever wrongs one with whom a compact (treaty) has been made [a dhimmī] and lays on him a burden beyond his strength, I will be his accuser.”</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>Now all absurdities posed by Agniveer have been debunked soundly.</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Islam has retaliation only for those who are combatant non-Muslims (Harbi), and their is no strictness for non combatants</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> (Dhimmī &amp; Mustaʾmin)</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">.</span> Agniveer also won’t be kind with those combatants against his Vedic Dharm, but Agniveer will surround them and detain them, harass their regions, and cut off their supply of grass, water, food &amp; fuel, and destroy the reservoirs, city walls, &amp; trenches of combatants; because it’s taught by Dayanand Saraswati. He writes quoting Manu Smriti 7.196 as follows:</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>“Let him, if occasion arises surround the enemy and detain him, harass his country, and cut off his supply of grass, water, food, and fuel. Let him destroy the reservoirs, city walls, and trenches of his enemy, alarm him by night and adopt other measures to vanquish him.”</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
[Satyarth Prakash, Ch. 6, Pg. 187, Tr. Chiranjiva Bhardwaj]
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>These are some examples of etiquettes of war against combatants in Vedic Religion, but Agniveer is still remaining peace ambassador and proponent of love. If Muslims teach tactics against combatants, they will be terrosist. What a gross narrow-mindedness of Agniveer is!</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">AGNIVEER WROTE:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">6. To understand true character of peace in Islam, let us review the following verses from Chapter 4:92: Never should a believer kill a believer; but [If it so happens] by mistake, [Compensation is due]: If one [so] kills a believer, it is ordained that he should free a believing slave, and pay compensation to the deceased’s family,unless they remit it freely. If the deceased belonged to a people at war withyou, and he was a believer, the freeing of a believing slave [Is enough]. If he belonged to a people with whom ye have treaty of Mutual alliance, compensation should be paid to his family, and a believing slave be freed. For those who find this beyond their means, [is prescribed] a fast for two months running: by way of repentance to Allah: for Allah hath all knowledge and all wisdom.</span></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">93. If a man kills a believer intentionally, his recompense is Hell, to abide therein [For ever]: And the wrath and the curse of Allah are upon him, and a dreadful penalty is prepared for him.</span></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Very clearly, Hell is recommended only for killing a believer and not an innocent or non-believer. Further, in case of emergency, even if a believer is killed unintentionally, it is NOT as though entire humanity is killed. You can compensate by freeing a slave or paying compensation or fasting. That is why terrorists are so comfortable throwing bombs around and then compensating through fasts!</span></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">7. Islam makes it more clear in Surate</span> <span style="color: #000000;">Nisa 150, 151 that those who differentiate between Allah and Muhammad and say that they shall believe in some things but not on other, and want to have a middle path are true Kafirs. And we have prepared worst of punishments for them. Clearly disbelief is greatest corruption and the favorite verse of Zakir and Shahrukh are not going to save you!</span></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">8. Read the articles on Partiality of Allah , Islamic Jehad , Islam – Reward and Punishment and Shirk – Why Islam is fanatic to find numerous verses that ensure that a non-believer is not innocent and disbelief is greatest form of corruption or mischief. And hence as per new Quran, non-Muslims simply do not qualify to be called human beings worthy of kindness.</span></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">9. Often parrots like Zakir</span> <span style="color: #000000;">Naik claim that Jehad is misinterpreted and in fact he himself is true Jehadi. I agree that Zakir</span> <span style="color: #000000;">Naik is a true Jehadi. But so are Osama Bin Laden, Kasab and all terrorists who spread Islam through violence. Husaini clearly states that to overpower on might of Islam, Quran or Sword is Jehad. Get more details on article on Islamic Jehad.</span></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">10. Surate Imran 28 is elaborated by Jalalyn as follows: If for fear or self-defense, one has to make friends with Kafirs, there is no harm provided in heart you have hatred and jealousy with Kafirs. That is why likes of Zakir</span> <span style="color: #000000;">Naik tend to fool people (read non-Muslim kafirs) by showcasing Islam as peaceful religion and working in-hand with Bin Ladens of the world. This was also the strategy of Sufis like Chistis whose sole aim was to spread Islam by fooling Hindus and acting as spies of terrorists like Muhammad Ghauri.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">MY RESPONSE:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">6)</span></strong><span style="color: #000000;"> Agniveer is addicted of chewing chewed bones. I cleared above in point 5 of previous accusation everything but no treat for his obstinacy.</span> <span style="color: #000000;">And again he tried to follow his ignorance about Quran 4:92-93 and concluded what his desire led him to. Now again, I will have to teach Agniveer juristic law regarding 4:92-93. </span><span style="color: #000000;">Listen to me now:</span></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">There are five types of murder in Islamic Law:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Qatl-i Amad (</span><span style="color: #000000;">Wilful murder or Intentional</span><span style="color: #000000;"> Murder)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Qatl-i Shib’h-</span><span style="color: #000000;">i Amad (Murder resembling intentional</span><span style="color: #000000;"> murder)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Qatl-i Khata (Murder by mistake or unintentional murder)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Qatl-i Shib’h-i Khata (</span><span style="color: #000000;">Murder resembling unintentional murder)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Qatl bis-</span><span style="color: #000000;">sabab (Causing death to someone</span><span style="color: #000000;">)</span></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">And 4:92 is talking about 3</span><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>rd</sup></span><span style="color: #000000;"> type and its punishment, while 4:93 is talking about 1</span><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>st</sup></span><span style="color: #000000;"> type and its punishment. </span><span style="color: #000000;">Agn</span><span style="color: #000000;">iveer says ”</span><span style="color: #000000;"><em>That is why terrorists are so comfortable throwing bombs around and then compensating through fasts</em></span><span style="color: #000000;">” he should check the meanings of intentionally and unintentionally in the dictionary</span><span style="color: #000000;"> first</span><span style="color: #000000;">.</span> <span style="color: #000000;">And the funny, when Agniveer saw the word ‘Believer’ immediately </span><span style="color: #000000;">he </span><span style="color: #000000;">tried to prove it applicable to Muslims only and said: </span><span style="color: #000000;"><em>‘Very clearly, Hell is recommended only for killing a believer and not an innocent or non-believer….’</em></span><span style="color: #000000;">, </span><span style="color: #000000;">but what can I say except praising his ignorance. If Agniveer could read the verse 92 well </span><span style="color: #000000;">he would</span><span style="color: #000000;"> find in the same verse</span><span style="color: #000000;"> about Dhimmi non-Muslims</span><span style="color: #000000;">: “</span><span style="color: #000000;">If he belonged to a people with whom ye have treaty of Mutual alliance, compensation should be paid to his family, </span><span style="color: #000000;">and a believing slave be freed….”. Further, I do tell you some legal maxims about the murder of non-Muslim citizens in Islamic state:</span></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">“</span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #000000;">Muslims and non-Muslims are equal with respect to blood money and retribution; and the sanctity of the blood of Muslims and non-Muslim citizens is the same in Islamic state.</span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #000000;"> And if a muslim killed a dhimmi (a non-Muslim citizen) in Islamic state, he (muslim) will be given capital punishment by authority</span><span style="color: #000000;">.</span><span style="color: #000000;">” </span></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">[Abstracted from Hidayah, Jauharah Nayyirah, Durre Mukhtar, Raddul</span><span style="color: #000000;"> Muhtar &amp; other books of Hanafi</span><span style="color: #000000;"> jurisprudence]</span></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Agniveer should first prove that it is legit for a Muslim to kill non Muslims just because of the difference in religion rather than misinterpreting the words. Prophet</span><span style="color: #000000;">ﷺ</span><span style="color: #000000;"> clearly prohibited to kill non Muslim living in Muslim land,</span><span style="color: #000000;"> as abovementioned from Sahih Bukhari:</span></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">“Whoever killed a Mu’aha</span><span style="color: #000000;">d (a person who is granted the pledge of protection by the Muslims) shall not smell the fragrance of Paradise though its fragrance can be smelt at a distance of forty years (of traveling</span><span style="color: #000000;">).”</span></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Ismail Ibn Kathir also used this Hadith in his Tafsir</span><span style="color: #000000;"> of Quran 17:33</span><span style="color: #000000;"> under the category “</span><span style="color: #000000;">The Prohibition of Unjustified Killing</span><span style="color: #000000;">” </span><a href="http://www.qtafsir.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=949&amp;Itemid=61" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">http://www.qtafsir.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=949&amp;Itemid=61<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">So Agniveer’s claim that “</span><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Hell is recommended only for killing a believer and not an innocent or non-believer</em></span><span style="color: #000000;">” is debunked</span><span style="color: #000000;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;">Hindu terrorists are very comfortable in killing people and then repenting by drinking Panchagavya (cow urine, dung and 3 other products) and by performing Yajnas as mentioned in Yajur Veda 8.13,</span></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>

<p>So when Vedic god can forgive sins then all these fanatics have no problem in committing crimes and then asking for forgiveness like a shameless creature. When theft, plunder, rape, prostitution, murder… are all encouraged in the Vedas then I am wondering what sins is Ishwar talking about in this verse?</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>

<p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">7)</span></strong><span style="color: #000000;"> As Arya Samajis keep editing their Vedas they find it normal to distort and misinterpret other religious text also. </span><span style="color: #000000;">That verse do</span><span style="color: #000000;">es not say ”muhammad” It says </span><span style="color: #000000;">”messengers/apostles” </span></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">[004:150] Those who disbelieve in GOD and His messengers, and seek to make distinction among GOD and His messengers, and say, “We believe in some and reject some,” and wish to follow a path in between;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">[004:151] these are the real disbelievers. We have prepared for the disbelievers a shameful retribution.</span></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">It is mentioned in Tafsir ibn Abbas,</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">‘’</span><span style="color: #000000;">(Lo! those who disbelieve in Allah and His messengers) meaning Ka’b and his followers, (and seek to make distinction between Allah and His messengers) with regard to prophethood and surrender to Allah, (and say: We believe in some) Scriptures and messengers (and disbelieve in others) in other scriptures and messengers, (and seek to choose a way) a religion (in between) between disbelief and faith;’’</span></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">And what is his point by quoting this verse? Every religion has its own set of rules and beliefs, to follow Islam you must follow its teachings as well, You can’t be a Hindu and reject Vedas as Vedas prescribes death penalty to those who reject Vedas. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The topic of this article was about surah Mai’dah 32</span><span style="color: #000000;"> but Agniveer is jumping to</span><span style="color: #000000;"> other </span><span style="color: #000000;">topics.</span><span style="color: #000000;"> Does this verse command to kill disbelievers just because they do not believe in either Allah or any Messenger? It’s talking about punishment after death.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">10) </span></strong><span style="color: #000000;">Qur’an is not Vedas so Agniveer should stop misinterpreting and distorting it to suit his vested interests. </span><span style="color: #000000;">That verse does not say ”</span><span style="color: #000000;"><em>for fear or self-defense, one has to make friends with Kafirs, there is no harm provided in heart you have hatred and jealousy with Kafirs”</em></span><span style="color: #000000;">nor does the tafsir says it,</span><span style="color: #000000;"> I will post the ver</span><span style="color: #000000;">s</span><span style="color: #000000;">e first</span></p>

<p>He has even distorted the Tafsir Jalalayn, it doesn’t say anything like ‘’<span style="color: #000000;">If for fear or self-defense, one has to make friends with Kafirs, there is no harm provided in heart you have hatred and jealousy with Kafirs</span><span style="color: #000000;">’’</span></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>Let me quote the simple explanation of this verse by Maududi,<br>
“That is, “If a believer falls into the hands of the enemies of Islam and is afraid of maltreatment and high-handedness, he may conceal his Faith, and live among them as if he were one of them. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Or, if they come to know of his Faith, he may make a show of his friendship towards them to save his life</span>. In case of extreme fear, he is permitted even to disown his Faith, if he feels that he is not strong enough to endure their oppression.”</p>
<p>Now if Agniveer says that it’s wrong to lie to save your life then I can only pray for Agniveer to become sensible and regain his mental balance. It’s the problem of Hindus that they are fooled by perverted Swamis in this 21st century and were also fooled by Swamis like Dayanand, and all the tolerant Hindus had embraced Islam by Sufi Saints, Many Hindus today are blindly following their faith, Watch this video <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111119154315/http:/www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cPzCj7K7B0" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right"><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #0000ff;">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cPzCj7K7B0</span><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a><span style="color: #000000;"> in the 21st century Hindus are worshiping the girl who is suffering from a disease then just imagine </span><span style="color: #000000;">the condition of Hindus two thousand years ago.</span> <span style="color: #000000;">Agniveer is actually mentioning the tactic of Hindus</span><span style="color: #000000;"> used for</span><span style="color: #000000;"> conver</span><span style="color: #000000;">s</span><span style="color: #000000;">ion</span><span style="color: #000000;">. </span><span style="color: #000000;">The g</span><span style="color: #000000;">reatest scholar of Hinduism AdiShankaracharya lived among the Buddhists as a Buddhist just to learn their religion and to defeat them and as Swami Dayanand said if he had invented his false doctrine</span><span style="color: #000000;"> namely Advaita Vedanta</span><span style="color: #000000;"> just to malign Buddhism then it was a good thing.

<p><span style="color: #000000;">Quran only prohibits Muslims from</span><span style="color: #000000;"> befriending those non Muslims who make </span><span style="color: #000000;">a </span><span style="color: #000000;">mockery of Islam and those who fight Muslims, </span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;">5:57 </span><span style="color: #000000;">O ye who believe! take not for friends and protectors those who take your religion for a mockery or sport,- whether among those who received the Scripture before you, or among those who reject Faith; but fear ye Allah, if ye have faith (indeed).</span></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>60:1 O you who have believed, do not take My enemies and your enemies as allies, extending to them affection while they have disbelieved in what came to you of the truth, having driven out the Prophet and yourselves [only] because you believe in Allah, your Lord. If you have come out for jihad in My cause and seeking means to My approval, [take them not as friends]. You confide to them affection, but I am most knowing of what you have concealed and what you have declared. And whoever does it among you has certainly strayed from the soundness of the way.</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>60:8-9 Allah forbids you not, with regard to those who fight you not for (your) Faith nor drive you out of your homes, from dealing kindly and justly with them: for Allah loveth those who are just. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Allah only forbids you, with regard to those who fight you for (your) Faith, and drive you out of your homes</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, and support (others) in driving you out, from turning to them (for friendship and protection)</span>. It is such as turn to them (in these circumstances), that do wrong.</p>

<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The context of the verse 5:51 is that during the time of Prophet, Hypocrites lived among the Muslims pretending to be Muslims while they kept </span><span style="color: #000000;">a </span><span style="color: #000000;">good relation</span><span style="color: #000000;">ship</span><span style="color: #000000;"> with those Christians and Jews who were in war with the Mu</span><span style="color: #000000;">slims. So in such </span><span style="color: #000000;">a </span><span style="color: #000000;">case there was </span><span style="color: #000000;">a danger that betrayal of such hypocrites may cause the defeat of Muslims and also there were equal chances of either Muslim’s victory </span><span style="color: #000000;">or Christian/</span><span style="color: #000000;">Jews victory. If Muslims were defeated then those hypocrites would’ve joined those Jews and Christians openly. Muslims would definitely obey Allah’s command and </span><span style="color: #000000;">after receiving the command </span><span style="color: #000000;">they won’t make</span><span style="color: #000000;">/retain</span><span style="color: #000000;">any relationship (read friendship) with Jews and Christians but the Hypocrites would surely retain their friendship and this would have probably differentiated the hy</span><span style="color: #000000;">pocrites from the Muslims. T</span><span style="color: #000000;">his verse was revealed to differentiate the Muslims and hypocrites pretending to be Muslims. Thus it was revealed that Muslims should not take Jews and Christians as friends as they were in war with the Muslims. If you conjoin the v</span><span style="color: #000000;">erses I mentioned above then they </span><span style="color: #000000;">will be</span><span style="color: #000000;">come</span><span style="color: #000000;"> pretty clear.</span></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Verse 5:51 first prohibits Muslims from taking Jews and Christians as friends as they were in a war and</span><span style="color: #000000;"> so as</span><span style="color: #000000;">to distinguish</span><span style="color: #000000;"> the hypocrites living among Muslims. Verse 5:57 then says not to befriend those non-Muslims that make mockery of Islam, and verses 60:8-9 then forbids to befriend those </span><span style="color: #000000;">disbeliever</span><span style="color: #000000;"> who fights the Muslims. So if these verses when read together gives us the impression that it is prohibited for Muslims to befriend only those who insult Islam and fight Muslim just because of religion. </span><span style="color: #000000;">Go to the below link for scholarly explanation,</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;">Do not have the illusion of comfort that if you are a woman and have child, Jehadis would have mercy on you. In Islamic wars, women are the worst tortured. Men die but women have to face the torments of remaining alive. That is why throughout history, during Muslim wars, Hindu women preferred to commit Jauhar or have themselves killed. The ghastly practice of Sati has its origin in the Islamic view of Kafir women. So we appeal to all sensible non-Muslims to beware of fanatics like Zakir and others who emphasize on modern Quran being a book of peace. The only Muslims who are peaceful are those who do not believe in Islam, or do not take Quran seriously or have never read it. If you ever find a Muslim who </span><span style="color: #000000;">claims that he has studied the current Quran thoroughly and believes it to be final and ONLY book of Allah and completely perfect, considers that all non-muslims would go to Hell; rest assured, he is simply doing Taqiah (fraud) and can potentially be as dangerous as Osama or Zakir. Rise up to unite people against such bombs and time-bombs before its too late.</span></p>

<p>Yajur Veda 17.38 O friendly countrymen, encourage the commander of the army, and begin the battle with him, who with his physical, mental and militarystrength, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">cleaves the enemies’ families</span>, usurps their land, is armed with weapons, slay’s the foes, subdues the enemy in the battle, and conquers him.” Tr.

<p>Agniveer said: “<span style="color: #000000;"><em>The only Muslims who are peaceful are those who do not believe in Islam, or do not take Quran seriously or have never read it</em></span><span style="color: #000000;">”, this statement resembles the words uttered by any mad: </span><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The only Doctors who are specialists are those who do not believe in Medical Science, or do not take Medical Books se</em></span><span style="color: #000000;"><em>riously or have never read them.</em></span><span style="color: #000000;"><em>”</em></span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;">Or any non-Vedic says:</span> <span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The only Arya Samajis who </em></span><span style="color: #000000;"><em>are true followers of Vedas are those who do not believe in Vedic Religion, </em></span><span style="color: #000000;"><em>or do not take Vedas seriously or have never read it.” </em></span></p>

<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Further, </span><span style="color: #000000;">Had this been true then Hindus living in Muslim majority countries like Indonesia, Malaysia, Bangladesh, UAE would have been treated the same way Muslim minorities treated by Hindus in India. </span><span style="color: #000000;">G</span><span style="color: #000000;">oing by this logic, all Arya Samajis are well versed in Vedas which is why they are radical who always try to make </span><span style="color: #000000;">a </span><span style="color: #000000;">mockery of other religions but never discusses the Vedic religion with others.</span><span style="color: #000000;"> He should’ve furnished references from his beloved Vedas about non Hindus going to heaven, forget about non Hindus going to heaven.

<p><span style="color: #000000;">1. Innovative rape techniques for Jehadis:</span></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Sahih Muslim: Book 008, Number 3371:AbuSirma said to Abu Sa’id al Khadri (Allah he pleased with him): 0 Abu Sa’id, did you hear Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) mentioning al-’azl? He said: Yes, and added: We went out with Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) on the expedition to the Bi’l-Mustaliq and took captive some excellent Arab women; and we desired them, for we were suffering from the absence of our wives, (but at the same time) we also desired ransom for them. So we decided to have sexual intercourse with them but by observing ‘azl (Withdrawing the male sexual organ before emission of semen to avoid-conception). But we said: We are doing an act whereas Allah’s Messenger is amongst us; why not ask him? So we asked</span><span style="color: #000000;"> Allah’s Mes</span><span style="color: #000000;">senger (may peace be upon him), and he said: It does not matter if you do not do it, for every soul that is to be born up to the Day of Resurrection will be born.</span></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Book 008, Number 3373:Abu Sa’id al-Khudri (Allah be pleased with him) reported: We took women captives, and we wanted to do ‘azl (coitus interruptus) with them. We then asked Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) about it, and he said to us: Verily you do it, verily you do it, verily you do it, but the soul which has to be born until the Day of judgment must be born.</span></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Bukhari Volume 7, Book 62, Number 137:Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri:</span> <span style="color: #000000;">We got female captives in the war booty and we used to do coitus interruptus with them. So we asked Allah’s Apostle about it and he said, “Do you really do that?” repeating the question thrice, “There is no soul that is destined to exist but will come into existence, till the Day of Resurrection.”</span></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Comment: </span>Mohammad says to his followers to verily go ahead and rape the captive infidel women. With such evil, ridiculous teachings in Islam, how can ZakirNaik claim Islam to be practical for women rights and human rights! Or is it practical only for the rapists?</p>

<p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">MY RESPONSE:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">First of all</span><span style="color: #000000;">,</span><span style="color: #000000;"> do the Hadith says Prophet </span><span style="color: #000000;">ﷺ</span><span style="color: #000000;">command anyone to rape </span><span style="color: #000000;">sl</span><span style="color: #000000;">ave girls?</span><span style="color: #000000;"> Secondly</span><span style="color: #000000;">,</span><span style="color: #000000;"> can anyone prove the</span><span style="color: #000000;"> companions raped those slaves? Raping female slaves is haram. </span><span style="color: #000000;">I will prove Agniveer wrong with hadiths, First I will prove slaves of Muslims had more rights than any other slaves and the slaves should be treated well, </span></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Sahih Muslim:</span><span style="color: #000000;">Book 015, Number 4082: Hilal b. Yasaf reported that a person got angry and slapped his slave-girl. Thereupon Suwaid b. Muqarrin said to him: You could find no other part (to slap) but the prominent part of her face. See I was one of the seven sons of Muqarrin, and we had but only one slave-girl. </span><span style="color: #00b050;">The youngest of us slapped her, and Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) commanded us to set her free.</span></p>
<p>Book 015, Number 4086: Abu Mas’ud al-Badri reported: “I was beating my slave with a whip when I heard a voice behind me: Understand, Abu Masud; but I did not recognise the voice due to intense anger. He (Abu Mas’ud) reported: As he came near me (I found) that he was the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and he was saying: Bear in mind, Abu Mas’ud; bear in mind. Abu Mas’ud. He (Aba Maslad) said: threw the whip from my hand. Thereupon he (the Holy Prophet) said: Bear in mind, Abu Mas’ud; verily Allah has more dominance upon you than you have upon your slave. I (then) said: I would never beat my servant in future.</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Sahih Bukhari:</span><span style="color: #000000;">Volume 1, Book 2, Number 29: Narrated Al-Ma’rur: At Ar-Rabadha I met Abu Dhar who was wearing a cloak, and his slave, too, was wearing a similar one. I asked about the reason for it. He replied, “I abused a person by calling his mother with bad names.” The Prophet said to me, ‘O Abu Dhar! Did you abuse him by calling his mother with bad names You still have some characteristics of ignorance.</span>Your slaves are your brothers and Allah has put them under your command. So whoever has a brother under his command should feed him of what he eats and dress him of what he wears. Do not ask them (slaves) to do things beyond their capacity (power) and if you do so, then help them.</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Many people whose heart is filled</span><span style="color: #000000;"> by hatred and ignorance misinterprets</span><span style="color: #000000;"> Hadiths and posts Hadiths out of contexts to misguide innocent people, If Qur’an had commanded earlier to free all slaves t</span><span style="color: #000000;">hen the M</span><span style="color: #000000;">uslims would have freed them and then the neighboring tribes would have again enslaved t</span><span style="color: #000000;">hem, So first Prophet Muhammad </span><span style="color: #000000;">ﷺ</span><span style="color: #000000;">converted the people of many tribes and then Allah commanded to free slaves in the Qur’an in the following verses 2:177, 9:60, 24:33, 4:92, 5:89, 58:3, </span>90:6-13.</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Raping slaves is prohibited,</span></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">“</span><span style="color: #000000;">In our view the man who rapes a woman, regardless of whether she is a virgin or not, if she is a free woman he must pay a “dowry” like that of her peers, and </span>if she is a slave he must pay whatever has been detracted from her value. The punishment is to be carried out on the rapist and there is no punishment for the woman who has been raped, whatever the case. <span style="color: #000000;">(Imam Maalik, Al-Muwatta’, Volume 2, page 734)</span></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">“</span>If a man acquires by force a slave-girl, then has sexual intercourse with her after he acquires her by force<span style="color: #000000;">,</span> and if he is not excused by ignorance, then the slave-girl will be taken from him, he is required to pay the fine, and he will receive the punishment for illegal sexual intercourse<span style="color: #000000;">.” (Imam Al Shaafi’i, Kitaabul Umm, Volume 3, page 253)</span></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Sex with slaves is also </span><span style="color: #000000;">prohibited in the Qur’an. </span><span style="color: #000000;">A</span><span style="color: #000000;">nd there are some hadiths from Sahih M</span><span style="color: #000000;">uslim and other in which Prophet Muhammad does not command to perform Al Azl with slaves (Al Azl was permitted to perform with wives)</span><span style="color: #000000;">,</span></p>

So we said (to the Prophet ). “Shall we castrate ourselves?” </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #000000;">But the Prophet forbade us to do that and thenceforth he allowed us to marry a woman</span><span style="color: #000000;">….. </span></p>

<p>Rape is actually permitted in the Vedas and that too an innovative way of raping woman, the god Vivasvat is said to have raped his own wife by inserting his male organ in her mouth after assuming another form, it is mentioned in Rig Veda 10.17 and I have provided explanations from Nirukta and Puranas.

<p><span style="color: #000000;">Book 19, Number 4292:Ibn ‘Aun reported: I wrote to Nafi’ inquiring from him whether it was necessary to extend (to the disbelievers) an invitation to accept (Islam) before meeting them in fight. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) made a raid upon Banu</span> <span style="color: #000000;">Mustaliq while they were unaware and their cattle were having a drink at the water. </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #000000;">He killed those who fought and imprisoned others</span><span style="color: #000000;">.

<p><span style="color: #000000;">Some historians said this expedition occurred in 5 AH, and some said 6 AH. But, the 5 AH (627 CE) is more reliable. See the reason behind it:</span></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">“…The cause of the Ghazwa (battle) was the information </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #000000;">that Harith b. Abu Dhirar, the chief of Banu Mustaliq, instigated the young men of his tribe and those of the surrounding tribes against the Muslims. To confirm the news, Prophet (Peace be upon him) sent Abu Buraida b. Husayb, and he had reported about their preparations for fighting</span><span style="color: #000000;">. The Prophet (Peace be upon him) called for the assembly of the soldiers, they assembled in hundreds within no time…”</span></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">“…The Prophet (Peace be upon him) appointed Zaid b. Haritha as the caretaker of Madinah, and himself with his army left for Banu Mustaliq on Monday, Sha’ban two. The command of the advance party was given in the hand of Umar, the Great. When Harith received the news of the Prophet’s expedition, besides, the news of apprehension of a spy of his, he lost his wits. His hosts left him amidst of the adversity, he, along with a small band of his tribe’s men, remained after to bear the brunt of his misdeeds. The Prophet (Peace be upon him) continued to move forward until his army reached the spring of Muraysi. The tent of the Prophet (Peace be upon him) was erected there, and the army arrayed. The standard of Muhajireen was in the hands of Abu Bakr, and that of Ansar with Sa’ad b. Abdullah. The war code of the Muslims for the day was ‘Ya Mansoor, Amit Amit!’. For the first part of the day, the parties shoot arrows to each other and then the Prophet (Peace be upon him) ordered to attack on the enemy altogether. In a very short span of time, ten of the enemies were killed, and rest were arrested…!”</span></p>

<p>Now forget about children and women, the companions of Prophet used to forgive their defeated enemies. <span style="color: #000000;">How can Hindus clarify these verses</span><span style="color: #000000;"> of Vedas which commands to kill children and women?</span></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>Yajur Veda 17.38 “<span style="color: #ff0000;">O friendly countrymen, encourage the commander of the army</span><span style="color: #333333;">, and begin the battle with him, who with his physical, mental and militarystrength,</span><span style="color: #ff0000;"> </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">cleaves the enemies’ families</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, usurps their land</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span><span style="color: #333333;">is armed with weapons, </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">slay’s the foes</span><span style="color: #333333;">, subdues the enemy in the battle, and conquers him</span><span style="color: #333333;">.”</span><span style="color: #333333;"> Tr. Devi Chand</span></p>
<p>Yajur Veda 17.39 “May the commander of the army<span style="color: #333333;">, who, with</span><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"> </span></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">surpassing vigour pierces in the battles the families of the enemies</span><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span></strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">is pitiless</span><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">,</span></strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"> wild with anger</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span><span style="color: #333333;">unconquerable by foes, conqueror of the enemy’s forces, unequalled in fight, and victor, protect our armies.”</span><span style="color: #333333;"> Tr. Devi Chand</span></p>
<p>Atharva Veda 11.2.21 Do not covet our cattle, our men, our goats and sheep! Bend thy course elsewhere, O strong god (ugra), <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">slay the offspring of the blasphemers</span>!</p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;">Manu 11:31-33 a brahman may kill anyone he wants without asking the king and the king cannot punish him</span></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>Atharva Veda 5.20.4-5 ”Let this war-drum victorious in the battle, loudly roaring and becoming the means of seizing whatever may be seized, be seen by all. Let this war-drum utter wonderful voice and <span style="color: #ff0000;">let the army-controlling man capture the possessions of the enemies</span>. Amid the conflict of the deadly weapons <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">let the woman of enemy waked by the roar and afflicted run forward in her terror</span> hearing the resounding and far reaching voice of the wardrum, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">holding her son in her hand</span>.” Tr. VaidyanathShastri.</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>This is the reason Hindu terrorists doesn’t spare women and children in riots because this is what they are commanded to do.</p>

This is a rebuttal to an Islamophobic Hindu who has an objection to Quran’s Surah Maidah chapter 5, verse 32 and","copyrightYear":"2015","articleSection":"Rebuttal: Religion","articleBody":"Written by Sulaiman Razvi\r\n\r\nThanks to brother Muhammad Qasim al Hanafi for helping me.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nThis is a rebuttal to an Islamophobic Hindu who has an objection to Quran’s Surah Maidah chapter 5, verse 32 and the name of the article is also based on this very verse. The Islamophobic did not stick to the topic but made many irrelevant points which shall all be refuted. Before we proceed, let’s read what Quran 5:32 is all about. First, let’s read those verses in context for a better understanding,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQuran, Surah Maidah 5, verses 27-32 “And recite to them the story of the two sons of Adam in truth; when each offered a sacrifice, it was accepted from the one but not from the other. The latter said to the former: \"I will surely, kill you.'' The former said: \"Verily, Allah accepts only from those who have Taqwa.\"If you do stretch your hand against me to kill me, I shall never stretch my hand against you to kill you, for I fear Allah; the Lord of all that exists.''. \"Verily, I intend to let you draw my sin on yourself as well as yours, then you will be one of the dwellers of the Fire, and that is the recompense of the wrongdoers.'') (30. So the soul of the other encouraged him and made fair-seeming to him the murder of his brother; he murdered him and became one of the losers. Then Allah sent a crow who scratched the ground to show him how to hide the dead body of his brother. He said: \"Woe to me! Am I not even able to be as this crow and to hide the dead body of my brother'' Then he became one of those who regretted. Because of that, We ordained for the Children of Israel that if anyone killed a person not in retaliation of murder, or (and) to spread mischief in the land - it would be as if he killed all mankind, and if anyone saved a life, it would be as if he saved the life of all mankind. And indeed, there came to them Our Messengers with Al-Bayyinat, even then after that many of them continued to exceed the limits in the land!\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nThis is the story of Habil (Abel) and Qabil (Cain) the two sons of Hazrat Adam A.S. Habil’s sacrifice was accepted due to his Taqwa while Qabil’s sacrifice wasn’t. Allah describes the evil end and consequence of transgression, envy and injustice in the story of the two sons of Adam A.S, Habil and Qabil. One of them fought against the other and killed him out of envy and transgression, because of the bounty that Allah gave his brother and because the sacrifice that he sincerely offered to Allah was accepted. The murdered brother earned forgiveness for his sins and was admitted into Paradise, while the murderer failed and earned a losing deal in both the lives. Ismail Ibn Kathir further explains this story as, Such is `Isa, son of Maryam. (It is) a statement of truth.) Several scholars among the Salaf and the later generations said that Allah allowed Adam to marry his daughters to his sons because of the necessity of such action. They also said that in every pregnancy, Adam was given a twin, a male and a female, and he used to give the female of one twin, to the male of the other twin, in marriage. Habil's sister was not beautiful while Qabil's sister was beautiful, resulting in Qabil wanting her for himself, instead of his brother. Adam refused unless they both offer a sacrifice, and he whose sacrifice was accepted would marry Qabil's sister. Habil's sacrifice was accepted, while Qabil's sacrifice was rejected, and thus what Allah told us about them occurred. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Ibn `Abbas said -- that during the time of Adam -- \"The woman was not allowed in marriage for her male twin, but Adam was commanded to marry her to any of her other brothers. In each pregnancy, Adam was given a twin, a male and a female. A beautiful daughter was once born for Adam and another one that was not beautiful. So the twin brother of the ugly daughter said, `Marry your sister to me and I will marry my sister to you.' He said, `No, for I have more right to my sister.' So they both offered a sacrifice. The sacrifice of the one who offered the sheep was accepted while the sacrifice of the other ﴿the twin brother of the beautiful daughter﴾, which consisted of some produce, was not accepted. So the latter killed his brother.'' This story has a better than good chain of narration.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nSo this is the context of the verse, now let’s see objections of Hinduvadi.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nAGNIVEER WROTE:\r\n\r\nNow Taqiah is an interesting concept used in several sects of Islam which means that it is fair to use deceit and fraud to defeat the enemy or non-Muslim.\r\n\r\nTo know the reality, let us review what the verse actually means as per leading translations and commentaries of Quran. Note that we only refer to authentic Islamic sites and books for reference and not sites of anti-Muslim kafirs who are bound to burn in Hell forever! these Kafirs, we shall in any case be spending eternity after Judgement Day! For now, we shall only live in company of those with whom we shall never meet in Hell because they would be enjoying virgins in Heaven while our skins are being roasted in Hell!\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nMY RESPONSE:\r\n\r\nAgniveer says ''Note that we only refer to authentic Islamic sites and books for reference and not sites of anti-Muslim kafirs'' This is the same Agniveer who wrote in another article of his ''You can find more details on abrogation from another kafir site: http:\/\/www.islamreview.com\/articles\/quransdoctrine.shtml'' and this is taken from http:\/\/agniveer.com\/1728\/quran-says-there-is-no-compulsion-in-religion\/\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, he claims that he quotes from Muslim sites only and on the other hand he encourages people to learn Islam from anti-Islamic sites. Now it's upto you people whether you want to be dependent on such deceiver.\r\nAgniveer lacks knowledge, I assume all his articles are only copy paste job that’s why he has no knowledge about Islam nor his own Vedic Dharma. Taqqiya is a Shia theology, as per this Shia concept it is permitted to conceal the faith when one’s life is in danger, in other words, its used to sustain peace and Dayanand Saraswati was the follower of DECEPTION himself, read what Dayanand wrote\r\n\r\n“Now it must be understood that if it was the belief of Shankar that God and the human soul were identical and that the world was an illusion, it was not good; but if he had avowed this doctrine simply in order to refute Jainism more successfully, it was a little good.” Satyarth Prakash, by Swami Dayanand Saraswati, Chapter 11, Tr. Chiranjiva Bhardwaja\r\n\r\nSo Agniveer is only following the words of his Guru Dayanand Saraswati who permitted lying to defame other religions and also to propagate Vedic faith. If Agniveer was being honest then he should’ve furnished reference from Quran proving his definition of Taqiyya. It’s Hinduism which allows lying and deception, read the article Lying in Hinduism and Hindu god is a cheater for more information. Agniveer is being Mayavi (Vedic fraud), Hindu gods like Indra and Vishnu are well known for deceit. Quran prohibits lying and deceit,\r\n\r\n[2:159] Those who conceal our revelations and guidance, after proclaiming them for the people in the scripture, are condemned by GOD; they are condemned by all the condemners.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Qur'an every pleasure will be available in heaven, Agniveer should see about virgins in his own Vedas and immoralities promoted in his Vedas,\r\n\r\nAtharva Veda 4:34:2 Bereft of physical bodies, pure, cleansed with the wind, brilliant, they go to a brilliant world. The fire does not cause burning in their male organ. In the world of happiness they get plenty of women.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nRead the article Obscenity in Vedas for more information.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nAgnvieer also says Islam is the fastest-growing religion because of the virgins available in heaven, If people were attracted to Islam due to virgins then Hinduism would have been the fastest-growing religion because it gives thousands of harlots in heaven and it even allows rape (only if you are a Brahmin), adultery, loot, murder, etc., refer to Hinduism and Lust article.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nAGNVIEER WROTE:\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nNow this particular verse appears in different places in different versions of Quran. We are not sure where it actually appears in first Quran that was written 20 years after Muhammad’s death. But in new versions of Quran available today, it is verse 35 of Chapter 5 in some editions and verse 32 in others\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nMY RESPONSE:\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nAgniveer is an expert in making bogus claims but cannot prove any. It’s actually the Vedas which has been changed and still changes with every recent publication. Interpolation in the Vedas is proved by a Hindu scholar Swami B.V. Giri on the basis of Hindu scriptures in his article Hindu scriptures battle of supremacy. Agniveer should stop being a Mayavi (Vedic fraud) and should honestly admit that his beloved books have been distorted and that only 6% of the original text is available today. But I don’t think he will do this as he interpolates Vedic verses to suit his vested interest, his translation of the Vedas doesn’t even match with those of other Arya Samajis which I have proved in my Responses and The Fake Translation Saga article.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nAGNVIEER WROTE:\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nSahih International\r\n\r\nBecause of that, We decreed upon the Children of Israel that whoever kills a soul unless for a soul or for corruption [done] in the land — it is as if he had slain mankind entirely. And whoever saves one — it is as if he had saved mankind entirely. And our messengers had certainly come to them with clear proofs. Then indeed many of them, [even] after that, throughout the land, were transgressors.\r\n\r\nTafsir al-Jalalayn\r\n\r\nBecause of that, which Cain did, We decreed for the Children of Israel that whoever slays a soul for other than a soul, slain, or for, other than, corruption, committed, in the land, in the way of unbelief, fornication or waylaying and the like, it shall be as if he had slain mankind altogether; and whoever saves the life of one, by refraining from slaying, it shall be as if he had saved the life of all mankind — Ibn ‘Abbas said [that the above is meant] in the sense of violating and protecting its [a soul’s] sanctity [respectively]. Our messengers have already come to them, that is, to the Children of Israel, with clear proofs, miracles, but after that many of them still commit excesses in the land, overstepping the bounds through disbelief, killing and the like.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nYusuf Ali\r\n\r\nOn that account: We ordained for the Children of Israel that if any one slew a person–unless it be for murder or for spreading mischief in the land- -it would be as if he slew the whole people: And if any one saved a life, it would be as if he saved the life of the whole people. Then although there came to them Our Apostles with Clear Signs, yet, even after that, many of them continued to commit excesses in the land.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nNow several points are very clear from the verse:\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\na. This verse is applicable only for people of Israel, and that is why Muslims hate Jews so much!\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nb. The Allah of Quran did not know of world beyond Israel, or else the final message of Allah for whole world should have provided message for entire world and not only Israel! Though I appreciate the spirit of fanatics who now try to implement draconian inhuman teachings of this new Quran to entire world, as though entire world is Israel!\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nc. The verse provides the conditions of exception. Anyone who is corrupt can be killed. A corrupt person is not innocent as per Islam. So far so good. Even we believe that corruption should have severe punishment. But let us go a step further and see what exactly is corruption or innocence as per Islam. Tafseer-e-Jalalayn details this — corruption includes unbelief among other variants.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nSo in summary, if you are not a Muslim, or you disbelieve in Allah, Rasul, Quran, Angels, Judgment Day, Heaven, Hell you are not an innocent. You are corrupt and hence this verse is no way applicable to you. If you want to be innocent or not corrupt, accept Islam. To further substantiate this definition of innocence\/ corruption, let us review the following:\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nMY RESPONSE: \r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nA) Agniveer is deliberately misinterpreting that verse and says it's applicable only for children of Israel, But that verse was not abolished, it's applicable for the people of this time also.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nThe writer should first prove that this verse was limited to the people of Israel and is abrogated for the Ummat of Prophet ﷺ. Agniveer is ignorant of the science and Sharia of Quran and Hadiths. When Allah mentions Children of Israel before the advent of Prophet Jesus A.S then it is actually talking about Muslims of that time. Those Children of Israel were the Muslims of their time. And the Christians of Prophet Jesus A.S time were the Muslims of their time. So It is ordained for the Muslims and not just limited to the people of Israel. What Allah has ordained to the children of Israel is applicable for the present believers as well, \r\n\r\nQuran 27:76-7 This Quran settles many issues for the Children of Israel; issues that they are still disputing. And most assuredly, it is a guide and mercy for the believers.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nAgniveer’s statement: “This verse is applicable only for people of Israel...” is revealing his ignorance about Islamic Juristic Laws. It's not Veda, which can be explained by any Tom, Dick & Harry. It's Quran which only can be understood by a person who has well knowledge of Islamic theological laws & Juristic Principles, or take help from reliable Islamic sources. I challenge Agniveer Group:\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n\"Show me a single authentic Islamic book, which testifies your bogus claim: 'This verse is applicable only for people of Israel...!'\" \r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nAfter these words, it will be better for me to clarify an Islamic juristic law, that is:\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n\"When will a verse be specific for people of previous Shari'ah, and when will be generic, or applicable to all Muslims, whether previous or present?\"\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nA small student of 5th\/6th class of Darse Nizami (Islamic studies) will tell you that if a law of previous Shari'ah isn't abrogated by the Shari'ah of Prophet Muhammad (Peace be upon him), it will be generic, & applicable for all. And if it has been abrogated by Shari'ah of Prophet Muhammad (Peace be upon him), it will be specific for those previous people, and won't be applicable for us.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nLet me quote some textual evidences from authentic books of 'Usool-Ul-Fiq'h (Principals of Jurisprudence)', to quench thirst of thirsty:\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n1. An eminent Islamic scholar, Qur'an exegete and a theologian 'Imam Abu al-Barakat al-Nasafi (d. 710 AH)' writes:\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n\"The Shari'ahs before (the Shari'ah of) us, are necessary for us (to act upon); only if Allah & His Messenger (Peace be upon him) mention them, without any refusal (or abrogation)...!\"\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n[Manar al-Anwar fi Usul al-Fiqh (The Lighthouse casting Light on the Principles of Jurisprudence), Chapter: Acts of Prophet Muhammad (Peace be upon him), Pg. 220, Published by Majlis-ul-Barkaat, Mubarak Pur {Azamgarh, U.P. (India)}]\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n2. A reliable Indian Hanafi Jurist 'Mulla Ahmad Jivan (d. 1130 AH)' explains abovementioned text as follows:\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n\"And if Allah didn't mentioned it to us, but it's found in the Law and the Gospel only, it's not necessary for us to act upon it; because they (the Jews & the Christians) fabricated the Law and the Gospel very much, and interpolated into it several things according to their own desires. Then, it's not sure whether it's from Allah (or others);\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nAnd similarly, when Allah mentions (previous Shari'ah) to us, after that abrogated it for us, directly as: 'Don't do so', or indirectly as: 'It's consequence of their transgression', then it's prohibited for us to act upon it...!\"\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n[Noor-ul-Anwar (Light of lights), Chapter: Acts of Prophet Muhammad (Peace be upon him), Pg. 220, Published by Majlis-ul-Barkaat, Mubarak Pur {Azamgarh, U.P. (India)}]\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n3. A great Hanafi Jurist 'Imam Zayn al-Dīn Ibne Nujaym (d. 969 or 970 AH)' writes:\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n\"The Shari'ahs before (the Shari'ah of) us is necessary for us, when Allah or His Messenger (Peace be upon him) mentions it to us without any refusal (or abrogation); because it's also Shari'ah of our Prophet (Peace be upon him)...!\"\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n[Fat'h al-Ghaffar bi sharh al-manar (Victory of Ghaffar in annotation of lighthouse), Pg. 346, Published by Dar al-Kutub al-ilmiyyah (Beirut), First edition, 1422 AH \/ 2001 AD]\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n4. A prominent Indian jurist Imam Ahmad Raza Khan (d. 1921 CE) writes:\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n\"The Shari'ah before (the Shari'ah of ours) is also applicable to us, if Allah the Almighty mentions it to us without any denial (or refusal); as evident in the books of Principles.\"\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n[Fatawa Radhawiyyah, Vol. 14, Pg. 117, Published in Lahore]\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n(Brackets are from me for better explanation.)\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nSeveral evidences can be quoted here, but these four will be sufficient for truth lovers. Now, we can take some important points:\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n(1) If any law of previous Shari'ah is mentioned by Allah in the Quran, or by Prophet Muhammad (Peace be upon him) in the Hadith without any abrogation, it will be generic & applicable for all.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n(2) If a law of previous Shari'ah is mentioned by Allah in the Quran, or by Prophet Muhammad (Peace be upon him) in Hadith, but they abrogated it directly or indirectly, it will be specific for people of that Shari'ah only and won't be applicable for us.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n(3) If a law of previous Shari'ah is not mentioned by Allah in the Quran, or by Prophet Muhammad (Peace be upon him) in the Hadith, but it's only found in the books of previous people, i.e. in the Law (Taurat) & the Gospel (Injeel), it won't be applicable for us due to concoction in their books.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nConclusively, I say:\r\n\r\nOnly in first condition, it will be applicable for us; and in second & third won't be. \r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nFrom abovementioned explanations by Islamic Jurists, it's as clear as sunshine that the Law of the Shari'ah of Prophets came before is applicable for us also, until it's not abrogated by the Shari'ah of Prophet Muhammad (Peace be upon him).\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nNow, Agniveer should tell me where did he get the Islamic textual evidence which abrogated the verse under discussion, and made it specific to Israelites only?\r\n\r\nB) Allah knows the entire universe that’s why he sent Messenger to every nation unlike Hinduism which is confined to India itself despite having 330 million gods and goddesses, may be their Visa for foreign tour was never approved that’s why they never went beyond India. Moreover, Vedic Dharma talks only about Aryavarta, wasn’t Ishwar aware of countries beyond Aryavarta? If only Aryavarta is special then why did he create other nations in the world?\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nC) Tafsir Jalalayn is grossly mispresented by Agniveer. First of all, we will see text of Tafseer al-Jalalayn, what does it actually say:\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n\"....{corruption} committed {in the land} in the way of unbelief, fornication or waylaying and the like...!\"\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nIn this text of Jalalayn, the 'corruption' is explained as Unbelief, fornication, waylaying etc as quoted by Agniveer also. But, Agniveer is trying to say that the corruption is only limited to unbelief, and its punishment will be only applicable to Non-Muslims. What a gross accusation! Perhaps, he neglected 'fornication', 'waylaying' and the likes to prove his narrow mindedness. \r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nEvery intellectual person knows very well these kinds of evil indeed are from corruption; some are corruption in the Rights of Creator as Unbelief, and others are corruption in the rights of Creation as fornication, waylaying etc.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nThan, what's the problem with Agniveer in accepting it? Doesn't he accept unbelief as corruption? If yes, then he should stop spewing venom against Quran; if not, he should tell us if unbelief is appreciated according to Vedic Cult?\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nAnd according to Islam, which type of unbelief is punishable, I will clear it in fifth point of next slander’s refutation. In sha Allah!\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nAnd the Arabic word used in the Qur'an for corruption\/corrupt is Fasad, the meaning of corruption is all kinds of evil, immoral, something which has errors or unreliable, the Arabic word Fasad translates into corruption, unlawful warfare, or crimes against law. Soits a law against crime, if Agniveer does not agree with this verse then he should start living in a cave or forest because every civilized nation punishes the person who breaks the law. Now forget about waging war against god or the believers, Vedic Ishwar tells to kill person who just hates him, Agniveer’s most beloved books Vedas calls for the death of the persons who oppose god, the Vedas says to burn the enemy, to pierce rod, etc.,and no mercy is shown by Ishwar, \r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nRig Veda 1.103.6 “To him, who is the performer of all deeds, the possessor and giver of strength, the truly powerful Lord, we offer devotional prayers. He a highwayman, snatches wealth from the godless exploiters and gives it to honest devotees.” Tr. SatyaPrakashSaraswati\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nRig Veda 9.13.9 “May you (O love divine), the beholder of the path of enlightenment, purifying our mind anddestroying the infidels who refuse to offer worship, come and stay in the prime position of the eternal sacrifice.” Tr. SvamiSatya Prakash Sarasvati\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nRig Veda 2.23.4 ”O God and learned person! you take the people to the target through the path of religion and justice and protect them. If you commit a sin, the soul or God is not infested with it. Those who denounce the Vedas and God, you cast your anger on them. Therefore, we should admire your greatness.” Tr. Acharya Dharma Deva VidyaMartanda (Arya Samaj).\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nRig Veda 3.53.21 ”O resplendent Lord, brave and opulant, protect us this day against our foes with many and excellent defences, may the vile wretch who hates us fall before us; May the breath of life depart from him whom we hate.” Tr.Svami Satya Prakash Sarasvati\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nSo this is the reason this Arya Samaji is having a problem with punishing people for committing crimes because his Vedas promotes murder of non Hindus and looting them. The Qur'an does command to kill or crucify the person who brings corruption\/mischief on the land but one should not forget what Holy Qur'an says \r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n[5:33] The just retribution for those who fight GOD and His messenger, and commit horrendous crimes, is to be killed, or crucified, or to have their hands and feet cut off on alternate sides, or to be banished from the land. This is to humiliate them in this life, then they suffer a far worse retribution in the Hereafter.\r\n\r\n[17:33] You shall not kill any person – for GOD has made life sacred – except in the course of justice. If one is killed unjustly, then we give his heir authority to enforce justice. Thus, he shall not exceed the limits in avenging the murder; he will be helped.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nAnd the Qur'an does not command to fight but fighting is allowed only in self defense.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n[025:068-9] They never implore beside GOD any other god, nor do they kill anyone – for GOD has made life sacred – except in the course of justice. Nor do they commit adultery. Those who commit these offenses will have to pay. Retribution is doubled for them on the Day of Resurrection, and they abide therein humiliated.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nThis verse says who attacks a person first and kills, then his punishment is doubled on the day of resurrection.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nAGNIVEER:\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n1. Refer \r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nThe mullah, a very eminent one, claims very clearly that a non-Muslim is not innocent and whatever a Muslim does, including terrorism, cannot be condemned by another Muslim. That is why Zakir Naik never condemns Osama Bin Laden.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n2. Zakir Naik himself answers a question stating that if non-Muslims are perturbed because they are called Kafirs, they should embrace Islam. Refer his book on Common Questions non-Muslims ask about Muslims. Whole of Quran is full of treatment to be meted out to Kafirs and the are further elaborated by Hadiths. We shall provide some excerpts here itself.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n3. The very next verse from same Surah 5 (Verse 33 in Sahih Internationl version) explains the context of the previous verse. It says:\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n“Indeed, the penalty for those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger and strive upon earth [to cause] corruption is none but that they be killed or crucified or that their hands and feet be cut off from opposite sides or that they be exiled from the land. That is for them a disgrace in this world; and for them in the Hereafter is a great punishment,”\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nThe Tafseer-e-Jalalyn only elaborates upon this meaning more brutally and readers can check out for themselves from www.quran.com. The intent is clear — if you are corrupt (as per Islamic definition), or oppose Allah\/ messsenger, you would be punished in most brutal manner. I would have wished that a book of peace would have emphasized more on forgiving and not the punishments that would be meted out if you do not yield.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nThus the very verse which is cited as verse of Peace by Zakir Naik and ShShShahrukh Khan are actually verses of blackmail and threat.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n4. Some Muslims may argue that corruption does not include disbelief in Allah\/ Muhammad but only publicly mischievous activities. Our counter-question would be to show one single verse from entire Quran that explicitly says that non-Muslims or disbelievers are to be treated equally and that disbelief is not the gravest crime. In fact, huge number of verses exist which claim that disbelief is the worst punishment.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n5. As per fanatic version of Islam propagated by new Quran, Allah would forgive anything but not disbelief in Allah\/Rasul\/Quran etc. If peaceful disbelief is indeed innocence and not corruption, why would Allah punish peaceful innocents forever in Hell fire?\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nMY RESPONSE:\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n1)If a scholar does not base his argument on Quran, Hadiths, or views of reliable scholars then his statement carries no weight. Agniveer wrote in one of his articles ''Swamis does not represent Hinduism'' He means to say that the Hindu Swamis who devote their life to Ishwar do not represent Hinduism but Muslim movie stars and other scholars represent Islam, Agniveer is such a hypocrite. Muslim scholars do represent Islam. There are many Muslim scholars from Arab, Indian subcontinent who condemn terrorism every other day and one scholar named Sheikh Tahir ul Qadri has even issued 500 pages Fatwa against terrorism but why did this Hindu extremist use a video of a preacher like Anjem Chaudhry only? Because it suits Agniveer’s narrative. Here’s a list of Muslim scholars who have condemned terrorism.\r\nIf Agniveer is ignorant of 'the Letter to Baghdadi', it's not our mistake. Let me tell you further:\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nIt's an open letter to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the ISIS as a theological refutation of the practices of ISIS. It's signed by numerous Muslim theologians, lawmakers and community leaders.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nThe letter includes a technical point-by-point refutation of ISIS's actions. It will tell you We Muslims unanimously condemned ISIS, and our scholars issued Fatwas against their Cruelty. But a blind can't see. Alas! \r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nThis Letter was signed by 126 Islamic Personalities of highest eminence on 19th September 2014 CE (24th Dhul-Qa’da 1435 AH), entitled: \r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n\"Open Letter to Dr. Ibrahim Awwad Al-Badri, alias 'Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi', And to the fighters and followers of the self-declared 'Islamic State'\",\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nIf you want to read or download it, visit:\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/www.lettertobaghdadi.com\/\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nHuffington Post said that the open letter is \"meticulously blasting its (ISIS) ideology.\"\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nSource: https:\/\/m.huffpost.com\/us\/entry\/us_5878038?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9lbi5tLndpa2lwZWRpYS5vcmcv&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAKaQeSYOfiJBWZ_kSB-pu_V7dLQL5rnEulqCVAUb3wplhjR7il_OICkL1jkx8eMuVKEgNdL1nSkgeTOKHhJAKNnMbmAigtcSv8Vy90Iw0YhCC3DL3RMNc5gWV629rYWnfK6KVfCRjaLb4JPFbKLOhZGWEGQVxKsTbcUvQyah1WGo\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nIf Agniveer is still wandering blindly in rebellion he should meet a psychiatrist nearby.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nSo cherry-picking lecture of some cleric to support your claim won’t work and isn’t wise. And how would Agniveer justify this Hindutvadis act who is commanding all Hindus to kill non Hindus and wipe all non Hindus out of India http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=BnV4KwqUxME\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nAnd also a list of atrocities and hate speeches against minorities by so called Tolerant people,\r\n\r\n\/index.php\/2013\/10\/06\/how-peaceful-are-hindus\/\r\nWill he justify speeches of Hindu scholars like Sakshi Maharaj, Yogi Adityanath, Acharya Dharmendra, Swami Mahamandleshwar Prabhodanand Giri Maharaj, Shankaracharya Jagadguru Narendrananda Saraswati, Sadhvi Prachi, Sadhvi Balika Saraswati and so forth who openly calls for persecution of minorities and unlike the case of Anjem Chaudhry these Hindu scholars gets full support from mainstream Hindu population whereas Muslims openly condemn such fanatic preacher. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n2) This is such a baseless and irrelevant point, We have read whether it is Quran or Vedas which is full of hatred towards disbelievers, leave aside disbelievers the Vedas even discriminates its own Shudras. Kafir is not an abusive word, It just means disbeliever. Quran doesn’t use racist, abusive words to refer to disbelievers like the Vedas and other Hindu texts does which uses derogatory words to refer to non Hindus such as Asura (demon used to refer to Zoroastrians), Maleccha which means Barbarians and is used to refer to foreigners and Muslims, Achoot (Untouchable) for lower caste.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n3) I have already refuted this claim but let me explain those misinterpreted verses again, \r\n\r\n5:33 The just retribution for those who fight GOD and His messenger, and commit horrendous crimes, is to be killed, or crucified, or to have their hands and feet cut off on alternate sides, or to be banished from the land. This is to humiliate them in this life, then they suffer a far worse retribution in the Hereafter. \r\n\r\nJust because his Vedas promotes plunder, theft, rape, murder, prostitution so he feels insecure with Quran commanding to punish criminals, any person with a sane mind would agree to what verse 5:52 is saying. Agniveer also writes that “I would have wished that a book of peace would have emphasized more on forgiving and not the punishments.”\r\n\r\nWell this is what happens when you do the copy paste job, the next verse says,\r\n\r\n[5:34] Except for those who repent before they fall into your power: in that case, know that Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.\r\n\r\nThis verse clearly says ‘’The just retribution for those who fight GOD and His messenger, and commit horrendous crimes, is to be killed”\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nAgniveer is sympathizing criminals and terrorists who commit horrendous crimes and wage war against religion and its people. Is it bad to punish those who fight you just because of your religion or to punish criminals? Is it a crime to defend yourself from such criminals? But why didn’t Agniveer quote the Tafsirs? Let me do it for Agniveer,\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nTafsir al Jalalayn “Truly the only requital of those who fight against God and His Messenger, by fighting against Muslims, and hasten about the earth to do corruption there, by waylaying, is that they shall be slaughtered, or crucified, or have their hands and feet cut off on opposite sides, that is, their right hands and left feet, or be banished from the land”\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nSo this is the context of this verse which is misinterpreted by Agniveer. Vedas talks about killing people who just hated Ishwar, \r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nAtharva Veda 10.5.15 “…By him we attack on him who hates us and whome we abhor. We overthrow and slay him through this knowledge, through this act and through this fatal weapon.” Tr. VaidyanathShastri\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nAtharva Veda 13:1:29 May conquering Agni, conqueror of all, destroy mine enemies. Through Agni we smite down in death and burn the foeman who attacketh me.\r\n\r\nHis beloved Ishwar is not so merciful that he doesn’t even forgive those who hate him, maybe it’s time for Agniveer to quit his Vedic dharm. Vedas promotes violence of all kinds, read articles Killing infidels in Vedas and Vedas and world peace part 2.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n4) The verse nowhere talks about carrying out attacks on non-Muslims for absolutely no reason. I notice at every step Agniveer always tries his best to prove specification of such verses for non-Muslims. Alas! he fails at every moment. Let me clarify again: \r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nThis verse indicates that it is binding on the state to eliminate those who terrorise society through militancy and violence, irrespective of their faith that they claim to uphold. Imam al-Tabari and Ibn Kathīr reported that Sa'id ibn Musayyab, Mujahid, Ata, al-Hasan al-Basri, Ibrahim al-Nakha'i and Dahhak all shared the same position. Imam al-Suyūṭī narrated the same view in \"al-Durr al-Manthur\". Imam al-Qurtubi mentioned in his exegesis that this verse was revealed in connection with a group in the time of the Prophet (Peace be upon him). They murdered peaceful people and plundered wealth, and in turn received a severe punishment. This verse also indicates that capital punishment is lawful. Qazi Thanaullah Usmani Panipati wrote:\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n“They [the jurists] concurred that ‘those who wage war and sow corruption in the earth’ mentioned in the verse are the brigands, whether they are Muslims or from the non-Muslim citizens. They also agreed that the one who takes up arms for the purpose of spreading fear on the roads outside of the urban areas—as no help can reach there—is an unlawful combatant [muharib] and brigand who is subject to the rulings contained in this verse. . . . Al-BaghawÏ said, ‘Those who rebel within the urban areas are also subject to the ruling contained in this verse’.”\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nNow, who should be reliable regarding clarification of the verses, abovementioned prominent Islamic exegetes or Agniveer who even doesn’t know A B C D of Quranic eloquence? \r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nFurther, Syed Abu Ala al Maududi defines the word ‘Land’ in verse 5:33 in his commentary as:\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n“Here \"the land\" refers to that country or territory in which the maintenance of law and order is the responsibility of the Islamic State and \"to wage war against Allah and His Messenger\" is to wage war against the righteous system of government established by the Islamic State. As Allah likes that such a system of government should be established, He sent His Messenger to establish an equitable system of government, which should guarantee peace and justice to human beings, animals, trees, vegetation and everything in the earth, which may enable human beings to develop to -the fullest their natural capabilities; which should exploit natural resources of the earth for the true progress and improvement of humanity and not for its destruction. It is obvious that any attempt, big or small, to undermine or overthrow such an established system, is in reality a war against Allah and His Messenger. It does not make any difference whether that mischief is created by criminals and murderers who cause disorder in the settled and peaceful society, or by armed forces who attempt to overthrow the Islamic State and establish some corrupt un-lslamic system instead. And every sovereign treats such a violation directed against his authority or against any of his officials as war against himself. An abstract of these alternative punishments has been given so That the judge or the ruler may exercise his discretion and award punishment according to the nature and extent of the crime. The real object is to show that any attempt by any person residing in the Islamic State, to overthrow its government is high treason and a most heinous crime, and that the offender is liable to be awarded any of these capital punishments according to the circumstance.”\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nAlmost every Tafsir has described Fasad in this verse as all kinds of crime. Even if I agree to what Agniveer says then why does Allah prescribe different punishments for the same crime called Unbelief in Allah\/Messenger? Moreover, Qur’an prescribes to treat non-Muslims justly and kindly,\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n[060:008] Allah does not forbid you to be just and righteous towards those who did not go into battle against you (over matters of faith), and did not expel you from your homes. Deal with them justly. Allah loves those who are just.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nThis verse commands Muslim to be Just and Kind with those non-Muslims who do not fight you on religion and Allah loves the people who are just.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n[006:108] And insult not those whom they (disbelievers) worship besides Allah, lest they insult Allah wrongfully without knowledge. Thus We have made fairseeming to each people its own doings; then to their Lord is their return and He shall then inform them of all that they used to do.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nThis verse says Muslims not to abuse the deities of idolators whom they worship besides Allah.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n[3:113-114] Not all of them are alike: Of the People of the Book [Jews and Christians] are a portion that stand (For the right): They rehearse the Signs of God all night long, and they prostrate themselves in adoration. They believe in God and the Last Day; they enjoin what is right, and forbid what is wrong; and they hasten (in emulation) in (all) good works: They are in the ranks of the righteous.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nI can quote many such verses, so Agniveer’s (so called) challenge has been answered. Agniveer has mistranslated Surah al Maidah verse from ''If you kill one person\/soul'' to ''if you kill one innocent'' to make his point, he cannot even name us one translator who has translated it has ''innocent'', The next line of this verse clarifies who is liable to be killed ''unless it be for murder or for spreading mischief in the land'' so a person who murders and brings corruption on the land can be killed by the authority.\r\n\r\n5)And the verse number is? If he is making a claim then he is supposed to furnish the reference. If Allah has given us the true path and a way to follow it we humans should do that if (s)he doesn't do that than (s)he is going against Allah. It is mentioned in Quran\r\n\r\n[10:44] Verily Allah will not deal unjustly with man in aught: it is man that wrongs his own soul.\r\n\r\n[2:281] And fear the Day when ye shall be brought back to Allah. Then shall every soul be paid what it earned, and none shall be dealt with unjustly.\r\n\r\n[3:113-114] Not all of them are alike: Of the People of the Book [Jews and Christians] are a portion that stand (For the right): They rehearse the Signs of God all night long, and they prostrate themselves in adoration. They believe in God and the Last Day; they enjoin what is right, and forbid what is wrong; and they hasten (in emulation) in (all) good works: They are in the ranks of the righteous.\r\n\r\nAllah forgives everything including Shirk (Disbelief in Allah) if the sinner sincerely repents before his death. Even if a believer commits sins then he will be punished for his sins, that’s the reason Allah reiterates in many verses of the Quran that those who believe and do good will be admitted to paradise. What about the Vedic God who rejects those who does not worship him?\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nRig Veda 6.44.11 “Give us not, O showerer of benefits, to the wicked. Relying upon your friendship, O Lord of riches, may we remain unharmed. Many are the boons you distribute amongst men; may you demolish those who make no libation, and root out those who present no offerings.” Tr. SvamiSatya Prakash Sarasvati\r\n\r\nRig Veda 6:47:17 He loves no more the men he loved aforetime: he turns and moves away allied with others. Rejecting those who disregard his worship.\r\n\r\nIs Agniveer aware of punishment to Malecchas (Non Hindus) inflicted by Ved Vaani just for rejecting Vedas? If yes then he shouldn’t be questioning it.\r\n\r\nNow, let me teach Agniveer some laws of Islamic Governance:\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nPeaceful unbelief isn't punishable in Islamic state, as Agniveer team tried their best to prove it. Alas! Success turned its face from their lies. According to Islamic Juristic Law, non-Muslims can be divided into three categories:\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n1. Dhimmī (ذِمّي)\r\n\r\n2. Mustaʾmin (مُسْتَأْمِن)\r\n\r\n3. Harbi (حَرْبِي‎)\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n1. Dhimmī: This term refers to non-Muslims living in an Islamic state with legal protection. Also called 'Ahl aḏ-ḏimmah\/dhimmah (أهل الذمة)'. The word literally means 'protected person', referring to the state's obligation under Shari'ah to protect the individual's life, property, and freedom of religion, in exchange for loyalty to the state and payment of the Jizyah tax, which complemented the zakat, or obligatory alms, paid by the Muslim subjects.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n2. Mustaʾmin: This term refers to a non-Muslim foreigner who only temporarily resides in Muslim lands (Dar al-Islam) via a short-term safe-conduct (aman mu'aqqat) which affords the Musta'min the protected status of Dhimmīs without having to pay the Jizyah tax.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n3. Harbi: It refers to a non-Muslim, who does not live under the condition of the dhimma. Harbi is counterterm to dhimmī. In other words a person belonging to the territory of war against Islam; he is in war against Islam every moment, by any form of war. He is combatant.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nNow the conclusive point is:\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nFirst & Second are Mu'ahad (a person who is granted the pledge of protection by the Muslims), and third is combatant because he is in war against Islamic State.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nNow, see the rights of Mu'ahad (Dhimmī & Mustaʾmin non-Muslims) as recorded in:\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nSahih Bukhari Hadith no. 3166, also in Ibne Maja Hadith No. 2686 & 2687, Beloved Prophet Muhammad (Peace be upon him) says about the protection of Mu'ahad Non-Muslims:\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n\"Whoever killed a Mu'ahad (a person who is granted the pledge of protection by the Muslims) shall not smell the fragrance of Paradise though its fragrance can be smelt at a distance of forty years (of traveling).\"\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nAbu Dawud Hadith no. 2760, Nasaai Hadith no. 4747, Ahmad Hadith no. 20377 and Darimi Hadith no. 2546:\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n“Any Muslim who unjustly kills a non-Muslim with whom there is a peace treaty [mu’ahad], God will make Paradise forbidden for him.”\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nA similar Hadith, in regard to the status of the dhimmīs, is mentioned by Dr. Wahbah al-Zuḥaylī (1998) in his \"ʾĀthar al-ḥarb fī l-fiqh al-Islāmī: dirāsah muqārinah\", Dār al-Fikr (Damascus), Pg. 708; Prophet Muhammad (Peace be upon him) said:\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n\"Whoever wrongs one with whom a compact (treaty) has been made [a dhimmī] and lays on him a burden beyond his strength, I will be his accuser.\"\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nNow all absurdities posed by Agniveer have been debunked soundly.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nIslam has retaliation only for those who are combatant non-Muslims (Harbi), and their is no strictness for non combatants (Dhimmī & Mustaʾmin). Agniveer also won’t be kind with those combatants against his Vedic Dharm, but Agniveer will surround them and detain them, harass their regions, and cut off their supply of grass, water, food & fuel, and destroy the reservoirs, city walls, & trenches of combatants; because it’s taught by Dayanand Saraswati. He writes quoting Manu Smriti 7.196 as follows:\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n“Let him, if occasion arises surround the enemy and detain him, harass his country, and cut off his supply of grass, water, food, and fuel. Let him destroy the reservoirs, city walls, and trenches of his enemy, alarm him by night and adopt other measures to vanquish him.”\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n[Satyarth Prakash, Ch. 6, Pg. 187, Tr. Chiranjiva Bhardwaj]\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nThese are some examples of etiquettes of war against combatants in Vedic Religion, but Agniveer is still remaining peace ambassador and proponent of love. If Muslims teach tactics against combatants, they will be terrosist. What a gross narrow-mindedness of Agniveer is!\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nAGNIVEER WROTE:\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n6. To understand true character of peace in Islam, let us review the following verses from Chapter 4:92: Never should a believer kill a believer; but [If it so happens] by mistake, [Compensation is due]: If one [so] kills a believer, it is ordained that he should free a believing slave, and pay compensation to the deceased’s family,unless they remit it freely. If the deceased belonged to a people at war withyou, and he was a believer, the freeing of a believing slave [Is enough]. If he belonged to a people with whom ye have treaty of Mutual alliance, compensation should be paid to his family, and a believing slave be freed. For those who find this beyond their means, [is prescribed] a fast for two months running: by way of repentance to Allah: for Allah hath all knowledge and all wisdom.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n93. If a man kills a believer intentionally, his recompense is Hell, to abide therein [For ever]: And the wrath and the curse of Allah are upon him, and a dreadful penalty is prepared for him.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nVery clearly, Hell is recommended only for killing a believer and not an innocent or non-believer. Further, in case of emergency, even if a believer is killed unintentionally, it is NOT as though entire humanity is killed. You can compensate by freeing a slave or paying compensation or fasting. That is why terrorists are so comfortable throwing bombs around and then compensating through fasts!\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n7. Islam makes it more clear in Surate Nisa 150, 151 that those who differentiate between Allah and Muhammad and say that they shall believe in some things but not on other, and want to have a middle path are true Kafirs. And we have prepared worst of punishments for them. Clearly disbelief is greatest corruption and the favorite verse of Zakir and Shahrukh are not going to save you!\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n8. Read the articles on Partiality of Allah , Islamic Jehad , Islam – Reward and Punishment and Shirk – Why Islam is fanatic to find numerous verses that ensure that a non-believer is not innocent and disbelief is greatest form of corruption or mischief. And hence as per new Quran, non-Muslims simply do not qualify to be called human beings worthy of kindness.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n9. Often parrots like Zakir Naik claim that Jehad is misinterpreted and in fact he himself is true Jehadi. I agree that Zakir Naik is a true Jehadi. But so are Osama Bin Laden, Kasab and all terrorists who spread Islam through violence. Husaini clearly states that to overpower on might of Islam, Quran or Sword is Jehad. Get more details on article on Islamic Jehad.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n10. Surate Imran 28 is elaborated by Jalalyn as follows: If for fear or self-defense, one has to make friends with Kafirs, there is no harm provided in heart you have hatred and jealousy with Kafirs. That is why likes of Zakir Naik tend to fool people (read non-Muslim kafirs) by showcasing Islam as peaceful religion and working in-hand with Bin Ladens of the world. This was also the strategy of Sufis like Chistis whose sole aim was to spread Islam by fooling Hindus and acting as spies of terrorists like Muhammad Ghauri.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nMY RESPONSE:\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n6) Agniveer is addicted of chewing chewed bones. I cleared above in point 5 of previous accusation everything but no treat for his obstinacy. And again he tried to follow his ignorance about Quran 4:92-93 and concluded what his desire led him to. Now again, I will have to teach Agniveer juristic law regarding 4:92-93. Listen to me now:\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nThere are five types of murder in Islamic Law:\r\n\r\nQatl-i Amad (Wilful murder or Intentional Murder)\r\n\r\nQatl-i Shib’h-i Amad (Murder resembling intentional murder)\r\n\r\nQatl-i Khata (Murder by mistake or unintentional murder)\r\n\r\nQatl-i Shib’h-i Khata (Murder resembling unintentional murder)\r\n\r\nQatl bis-sabab (Causing death to someone)\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nAnd 4:92 is talking about 3rd type and its punishment, while 4:93 is talking about 1st type and its punishment. Agniveer says ''That is why terrorists are so comfortable throwing bombs around and then compensating through fasts'' he should check the meanings of intentionally and unintentionally in the dictionary first. And the funny, when Agniveer saw the word ‘Believer’ immediately he tried to prove it applicable to Muslims only and said: ‘Very clearly, Hell is recommended only for killing a believer and not an innocent or non-believer....’, but what can I say except praising his ignorance. If Agniveer could read the verse 92 well he would find in the same verse about Dhimmi non-Muslims: “If he belonged to a people with whom ye have treaty of Mutual alliance, compensation should be paid to his family, and a believing slave be freed....”. Further, I do tell you some legal maxims about the murder of non-Muslim citizens in Islamic state:\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n“Muslims and non-Muslims are equal with respect to blood money and retribution; and the sanctity of the blood of Muslims and non-Muslim citizens is the same in Islamic state. And if a muslim killed a dhimmi (a non-Muslim citizen) in Islamic state, he (muslim) will be given capital punishment by authority.” \r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n[Abstracted from Hidayah, Jauharah Nayyirah, Durre Mukhtar, Raddul Muhtar & other books of Hanafi jurisprudence]\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nAgniveer should first prove that it is legit for a Muslim to kill non Muslims just because of the difference in religion rather than misinterpreting the words. Prophetﷺ clearly prohibited to kill non Muslim living in Muslim land, as abovementioned from Sahih Bukhari:\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n\"Whoever killed a Mu'ahad (a person who is granted the pledge of protection by the Muslims) shall not smell the fragrance of Paradise though its fragrance can be smelt at a distance of forty years (of traveling).\"\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nIsmail Ibn Kathir also used this Hadith in his Tafsir of Quran 17:33 under the category “The Prohibition of Unjustified Killing” http:\/\/www.qtafsir.com\/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=949&Itemid=61\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nSo Agniveer’s claim that “Hell is recommended only for killing a believer and not an innocent or non-believer” is debunked. \r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nFor more information on verse 4:34, read Tafsir Ibn Kathir\r\nhttp:\/\/www.qtafsir.com\/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=619&Itemid=59\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more information on prohibition to kill non-Muslims, see http:\/\/www.letmeturnthetables.com\/2011\/05\/concept-of-dhimmi-in-islam.html\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHindu terrorists are very comfortable in killing people and then repenting by drinking Panchagavya (cow urine, dung and 3 other products) and by performing Yajnas as mentioned in Yajur Veda 8.13,\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nYajur Veda 8.13 “You are the redeemer from the sin committed by the generous superman; you are the saviour from the sin committed by the ordinary person; you are the redeemer from the sins committed by the forefathers; you are the redeemer from the sin committed by one’s own self; you are the redeemer from the sins begotten of sin. Whatever the sin I have committed in a state of knowledge, or I have committed in a state of ignorance (or I might commit in future), you are the saviour from all that.” Tr. Tulsi Ram\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nSo when Vedic god can forgive sins then all these fanatics have no problem in committing crimes and then asking for forgiveness like a shameless creature. When theft, plunder, rape, prostitution, murder… are all encouraged in the Vedas then I am wondering what sins is Ishwar talking about in this verse?\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n7) As Arya Samajis keep editing their Vedas they find it normal to distort and misinterpret other religious text also. That verse does not say ''muhammad'' It says ''messengers\/apostles'' \r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n[004:150] Those who disbelieve in GOD and His messengers, and seek to make distinction among GOD and His messengers, and say, \"We believe in some and reject some,\" and wish to follow a path in between;\r\n\r\n[004:151] these are the real disbelievers. We have prepared for the disbelievers a shameful retribution.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nIt is mentioned in Tafsir ibn Abbas,\r\n\r\n‘’(Lo! those who disbelieve in Allah and His messengers) meaning Ka'b and his followers, (and seek to make distinction between Allah and His messengers) with regard to prophethood and surrender to Allah, (and say: We believe in some) Scriptures and messengers (and disbelieve in others) in other scriptures and messengers, (and seek to choose a way) a religion (in between) between disbelief and faith;’’\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nAnd what is his point by quoting this verse? Every religion has its own set of rules and beliefs, to follow Islam you must follow its teachings as well, You can’t be a Hindu and reject Vedas as Vedas prescribes death penalty to those who reject Vedas. \r\n\r\nThe topic of this article was about surah Mai'dah 32 but Agniveer is jumping to other topics. Does this verse command to kill disbelievers just because they do not believe in either Allah or any Messenger? It’s talking about punishment after death.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n8) Why beg readers to read your numerous useless articles to “find numerous verses that ensure that a non-believer is not innocent and disbelief is greatest form of corruption or mischief”? If there exists such verses then he should post it here in this article. Why beat around the bush and twist verses to suit your vested interests? Most of those articles have been refuted here.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n9) Dr. Zakir Naik has answered this question many times, And as I said a Muslim who kills an innocent will be punished by Allah and Allah has ordered to punish those people who kill innocent no matter what religion they follow. If Islam is still spread by violence then I am eager to know who is forcing thousands of Americans and Europeans to embrace Islam? and Agniveer had also written ''People embrace Islam because to get Virgins'' I know this does not make any sense but I assume Agnvieer writes articles in frustration or maybe under the influence of cannabis like Swami Dayanand Saraswati did. If people want more virgin for satisfying their lust then Hinduism is the best religion for them as it promises thousands of Apsaras in heaven. Read the article Hinduism and Lust for more information. And it is not Islam which encourages to spread the religion by sword but it is Hinduism which encourages it, \r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nYajur Veda 29.39 “With military weapons let us win the Earth, with them the battle, with cannon let us win the ease-loving army of our foes. War-like weapons destroy the ambitions of the foeman. Armed with the bow may we subdue all regions.” Tr. Devi Chand\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n10) Qur’an is not Vedas so Agniveer should stop misinterpreting and distorting it to suit his vested interests. That verse does not say ''for fear or self-defense, one has to make friends with Kafirs, there is no harm provided in heart you have hatred and jealousy with Kafirs''nor does the tafsir says it, I will post the verse first\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n[3:28] Let not the Believers take the unbelievers as their patrons over against the Believers. Whoever does this is exiled from GOD. Exempted are those who are forced to do this to avoid persecution. GOD alerts you that you shall reverence Him alone. To GOD is the ultimate destiny.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nHe has even distorted the Tafsir Jalalayn, it doesn’t say anything like ‘’If for fear or self-defense, one has to make friends with Kafirs, there is no harm provided in heart you have hatred and jealousy with Kafirs’’\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nLet me quote the simple explanation of this verse by Maududi,\r\n“That is, \"If a believer falls into the hands of the enemies of Islam and is afraid of maltreatment and high-handedness, he may conceal his Faith, and live among them as if he were one of them. Or, if they come to know of his Faith, he may make a show of his friendship towards them to save his life. In case of extreme fear, he is permitted even to disown his Faith, if he feels that he is not strong enough to endure their oppression.\"\r\n\r\nNow if Agniveer says that it’s wrong to lie to save your life then I can only pray for Agniveer to become sensible and regain his mental balance. It’s the problem of Hindus that they are fooled by perverted Swamis in this 21st century and were also fooled by Swamis like Dayanand, and all the tolerant Hindus had embraced Islam by Sufi Saints, Many Hindus today are blindly following their faith, Watch this video http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=7cPzCj7K7B0 in the 21st century Hindus are worshiping the girl who is suffering from a disease then just imagine the condition of Hindus two thousand years ago. Agniveer is actually mentioning the tactic of Hindus used for conversion. The greatest scholar of Hinduism AdiShankaracharya lived among the Buddhists as a Buddhist just to learn their religion and to defeat them and as Swami Dayanand said if he had invented his false doctrine namely Advaita Vedanta just to malign Buddhism then it was a good thing. Readers can go through the article Lying in Hinduism for more information.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nQuran only prohibits Muslims from befriending those non Muslims who make a mockery of Islam and those who fight Muslims, \r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n5:57 O ye who believe! take not for friends and protectors those who take your religion for a mockery or sport,- whether among those who received the Scripture before you, or among those who reject Faith; but fear ye Allah, if ye have faith (indeed).\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n60:1 O you who have believed, do not take My enemies and your enemies as allies, extending to them affection while they have disbelieved in what came to you of the truth, having driven out the Prophet and yourselves [only] because you believe in Allah, your Lord. If you have come out for jihad in My cause and seeking means to My approval, [take them not as friends]. You confide to them affection, but I am most knowing of what you have concealed and what you have declared. And whoever does it among you has certainly strayed from the soundness of the way.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n60:8-9 Allah forbids you not, with regard to those who fight you not for (your) Faith nor drive you out of your homes, from dealing kindly and justly with them: for Allah loveth those who are just. Allah only forbids you, with regard to those who fight you for (your) Faith, and drive you out of your homes, and support (others) in driving you out, from turning to them (for friendship and protection). It is such as turn to them (in these circumstances), that do wrong.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nThe context of the verse 5:51 is that during the time of Prophet, Hypocrites lived among the Muslims pretending to be Muslims while they kept a good relationship with those Christians and Jews who were in war with the Muslims. So in such a case there was a danger that betrayal of such hypocrites may cause the defeat of Muslims and also there were equal chances of either Muslim’s victory or Christian\/Jews victory. If Muslims were defeated then those hypocrites would’ve joined those Jews and Christians openly. Muslims would definitely obey Allah’s command and after receiving the command they won’t make\/retainany relationship (read friendship) with Jews and Christians but the Hypocrites would surely retain their friendship and this would have probably differentiated the hypocrites from the Muslims. This verse was revealed to differentiate the Muslims and hypocrites pretending to be Muslims. Thus it was revealed that Muslims should not take Jews and Christians as friends as they were in war with the Muslims. If you conjoin the verses I mentioned above then they will become pretty clear.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nVerse 5:51 first prohibits Muslims from taking Jews and Christians as friends as they were in a war and so asto distinguish the hypocrites living among Muslims. Verse 5:57 then says not to befriend those non-Muslims that make mockery of Islam, and verses 60:8-9 then forbids to befriend those disbeliever who fights the Muslims. So if these verses when read together gives us the impression that it is prohibited for Muslims to befriend only those who insult Islam and fight Muslim just because of religion. Go to the below link for scholarly explanation,\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/www.answering-christianity.com\/friends.htm\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nAGNIVEER WROTE:\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nDo not have the illusion of comfort that if you are a woman and have child, Jehadis would have mercy on you. In Islamic wars, women are the worst tortured. Men die but women have to face the torments of remaining alive. That is why throughout history, during Muslim wars, Hindu women preferred to commit Jauhar or have themselves killed. The ghastly practice of Sati has its origin in the Islamic view of Kafir women. So we appeal to all sensible non-Muslims to beware of fanatics like Zakir and others who emphasize on modern Quran being a book of peace. The only Muslims who are peaceful are those who do not believe in Islam, or do not take Quran seriously or have never read it. If you ever find a Muslim who claims that he has studied the current Quran thoroughly and believes it to be final and ONLY book of Allah and completely perfect, considers that all non-muslims would go to Hell; rest assured, he is simply doing Taqiah (fraud) and can potentially be as dangerous as Osama or Zakir. Rise up to unite people against such bombs and time-bombs before its too late.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nMY RESPONSE:\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nKilling of children, women and elderly people is prohibited in Islam.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nSaheeh Bukhari Volume 004, Book 052, Hadith Number 257 Narrated By 'Abdullah : During some of the Ghazawat of the Prophet a woman was found killed.

Revati also embracing the corpse of Rama, entered the blazing pile, which was cool to her, happy in contact with her lord. Hearing these events, Ugrasena and Anakadundubhi, with Devaki and Rohini, committed themselves to the flames.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nSati is encouraged in the Hindu scriptures,\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nGaruda Purana 1.107.29 A wife who dies in the company of her husband shall remain in heaven as many years as there are hairs on his person.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nRig Veda 10:18:7 Let these women, whose husbands are worthy and are living, enter the house with ghee (applied) as collyrium (to their eyes). Let these wives first step into the pyre, tearless without any affliction and well adorned\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nRead the article Sati Pratha: The burning of widows for more information. What Agniveer means to say is that the Mughals were attracted only to married women just like the Hindu god Indra who raped other's wives, why didn’t unmarried Hindu girls commit Sati? Weren’t “Islamic invaders” interested in them? Killing women and children is actually permitted in barbaric Vedas,\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nAtharva Veda 5.20.4-5 ”Let this war-drum victorious in the battle, loudly roaring and becoming the means of seizing whatever may be seized, be seen by all. Let this war-drum utter wonderful voice and let the army-controlling man capture the possessions of the enemies. Amid the conflict of the deadly weapons let the woman of enemy waked by the roar and afflicted run forward in her terror hearing the resounding and far reaching voice of the wardrum, holding her son in her hand.” Tr. VaidyanathShastri\r\n\r\nYajur Veda 17.38 O friendly countrymen, encourage the commander of the army, and begin the battle with him, who with his physical, mental and militarystrength, cleaves the enemies’ families, usurps their land, is armed with weapons, slay’s the foes, subdues the enemy in the battle, and conquers him.” Tr. Devi Chand\r\n\r\nFor more information read Killing infidels in Vedas and Vedas and world peace part 2\r\n\r\nAgniveer said: “The only Muslims who are peaceful are those who do not believe in Islam, or do not take Quran seriously or have never read it”, this statement resembles the words uttered by any mad: “The only Doctors who are specialists are those who do not believe in Medical Science, or do not take Medical Books seriously or have never read them.”\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nOr any non-Vedic says: “The only Arya Samajis who are true followers of Vedas are those who do not believe in Vedic Religion, or do not take Vedas seriously or have never read it.” \r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nNow, intellectual readers should see this unachievable presume and guess level of Agniveer’s logic!\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nFurther, Had this been true then Hindus living in Muslim majority countries like Indonesia, Malaysia, Bangladesh, UAE would have been treated the same way Muslim minorities treated by Hindus in India. Going by this logic, all Arya Samajis are well versed in Vedas which is why they are radical who always try to make a mockery of other religions but never discusses the Vedic religion with others. He should’ve furnished references from his beloved Vedas about non Hindus going to heaven, forget about non Hindus going to heaven. Vedas do not even consider non Hindus to be humans, Hindu texts call non Hindus as demons and barbarians. \r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nAGNIVEER WROTE:\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n1. Innovative rape techniques for Jehadis:\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nSahih Muslim: Book 008, Number 3371:AbuSirma said to Abu Sa’id al Khadri (Allah he pleased with him): 0 Abu Sa’id, did you hear Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) mentioning al-’azl? He said: Yes, and added: We went out with Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) on the expedition to the Bi’l-Mustaliq and took captive some excellent Arab women; and we desired them, for we were suffering from the absence of our wives, (but at the same time) we also desired ransom for them. So we decided to have sexual intercourse with them but by observing ‘azl (Withdrawing the male sexual organ before emission of semen to avoid-conception). But we said: We are doing an act whereas Allah’s Messenger is amongst us; why not ask him? So we asked Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him), and he said: It does not matter if you do not do it, for every soul that is to be born up to the Day of Resurrection will be born.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nBook 008, Number 3373:Abu Sa’id al-Khudri (Allah be pleased with him) reported: We took women captives, and we wanted to do ‘azl (coitus interruptus) with them. We then asked Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) about it, and he said to us: Verily you do it, verily you do it, verily you do it, but the soul which has to be born until the Day of judgment must be born.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nBukhari Volume 7, Book 62, Number 137:Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri: We got female captives in the war booty and we used to do coitus interruptus with them. So we asked Allah’s Apostle about it and he said, “Do you really do that?” repeating the question thrice, “There is no soul that is destined to exist but will come into existence, till the Day of Resurrection.”\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nComment: Mohammad says to his followers to verily go ahead and rape the captive infidel women. With such evil, ridiculous teachings in Islam, how can ZakirNaik claim Islam to be practical for women rights and human rights! Or is it practical only for the rapists?\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nMY RESPONSE:\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, do the Hadith says Prophet ﷺcommand anyone to rape slave girls? Secondly, can anyone prove the companions raped those slaves? Raping female slaves is haram. I will prove Agniveer wrong with hadiths, First I will prove slaves of Muslims had more rights than any other slaves and the slaves should be treated well, \r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nSahih Muslim:Book 015, Number 4082: Hilal b. Yasaf reported that a person got angry and slapped his slave-girl. Thereupon Suwaid b. Muqarrin said to him: You could find no other part (to slap) but the prominent part of her face. See I was one of the seven sons of Muqarrin, and we had but only one slave-girl. The youngest of us slapped her, and Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) commanded us to set her free.\r\n\r\nBook 015, Number 4086: Abu Mas'ud al-Badri reported: \"I was beating my slave with a whip when I heard a voice behind me: Understand, Abu Masud; but I did not recognise the voice due to intense anger. He (Abu Mas'ud) reported: As he came near me (I found) that he was the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and he was saying: Bear in mind, Abu Mas'ud; bear in mind. Abu Mas'ud. He (Aba Maslad) said: threw the whip from my hand. Thereupon he (the Holy Prophet) said: Bear in mind, Abu Mas'ud; verily Allah has more dominance upon you than you have upon your slave. I (then) said: I would never beat my servant in future.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nSahih Bukhari:Volume 1, Book 2, Number 29: Narrated Al-Ma'rur: At Ar-Rabadha I met Abu Dhar who was wearing a cloak, and his slave, too, was wearing a similar one. I asked about the reason for it. He replied, \"I abused a person by calling his mother with bad names.\" The Prophet said to me, 'O Abu Dhar! Did you abuse him by calling his mother with bad names You still have some characteristics of ignorance.Your slaves are your brothers and Allah has put them under your command. So whoever has a brother under his command should feed him of what he eats and dress him of what he wears. Do not ask them (slaves) to do things beyond their capacity (power) and if you do so, then help them.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nMany people whose heart is filled by hatred and ignorance misinterprets Hadiths and posts Hadiths out of contexts to misguide innocent people, If Qur'an had commanded earlier to free all slaves then the Muslims would have freed them and then the neighboring tribes would have again enslaved them, So first Prophet Muhammad ﷺconverted the people of many tribes and then Allah commanded to free slaves in the Qur'an in the following verses 2:177, 9:60, 24:33, 4:92, 5:89, 58:3, 90:6-13.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nRaping slaves is prohibited,\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n“In our view the man who rapes a woman, regardless of whether she is a virgin or not, if she is a free woman he must pay a \"dowry\" like that of her peers, and if she is a slave he must pay whatever has been detracted from her value. The punishment is to be carried out on the rapist and there is no punishment for the woman who has been raped, whatever the case. (Imam Maalik, Al-Muwatta', Volume 2, page 734)\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n\"If a man acquires by force a slave-girl, then has sexual intercourse with her after he acquires her by force, and if he is not excused by ignorance, then the slave-girl will be taken from him, he is required to pay the fine, and he will receive the punishment for illegal sexual intercourse.\" (Imam Al Shaafi'i, Kitaabul Umm, Volume 3, page 253)\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nSex with slaves is also prohibited in the Qur'an. And there are some hadiths from Sahih Muslim and other in which Prophet Muhammad does not command to perform Al Azl with slaves (Al Azl was permitted to perform with wives),\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nProphet Muhammad ﷺtold his companions to marry the woman,\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nSahih BukhariVolume 6, Book 60, Number 139: Narrated Abdullah: We used to participate in the holy wars carried on by the Prophet and we had no women (wives) with us. So we said (to the Prophet ). \"Shall we castrate ourselves?\" But the Prophet forbade us to do that and thenceforth he allowed us to marry a woman….. \r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nRape is actually permitted in the Vedas and that too an innovative way of raping woman, the god Vivasvat is said to have raped his own wife by inserting his male organ in her mouth after assuming another form, it is mentioned in Rig Veda 10.17 and I have provided explanations from Nirukta and Puranas. Read the articles Obscenity in Vedas and Hinduism and Lust for more information and also read Matsya Purana verses wherein Vedic god Indra forces women of demons into prostitution after killing their husbands in a battle. What about the group sex of a woman in Veda \r\n\r\nRead Athar Veda 5:25:7-13 which talks about many men ejaculating in one woman\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nWomen is a sex object in Vedas,\r\n\r\nYajur Veda 30:6 … God has assigned woman for sexual pleasure.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nAGNIVEER WROTE:\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n2. Killing those who refuse to accept Islam\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nSahih Muslim, Chapter 1 : REGARDING PERMISSION TO MAKE A RAID, WITHOUT AN ULTIMATUM, UPON THE DISBELIEVERS WHO HAVE ALREADY BEEN INVITED TO ACCEPT ISLAM\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nBook 19, Number 4292:Ibn ‘Aun reported: I wrote to Nafi’ inquiring from him whether it was necessary to extend (to the disbelievers) an invitation to accept (Islam) before meeting them in fight. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) made a raid upon Banu Mustaliq while they were unaware and their cattle were having a drink at the water. He killed those who fought and imprisoned others. On that very day, he captured Juwairiya bint al-Harith. Nafi’ said that this tradition was related to him by Abdullah b. Umar who (himself) was among the raiding troops.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nBook 19, Number 4293:This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Ibn ‘Aun and the name of Juwairiyabint al-Harith was mentioned beyond any doubt.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nComment: Thus, if any one of us has ever been invited to accept Islam (as done through Peace TV and websites), now we can be murdered by grace of Allah without any notice! Does Osama Bin Laden need any other justification? And That is why Zakir Naik cannot criticize Osama after all this?\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nMY RESPONSE:\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nRead that hadith again it says ''He killed those who fought and imprisoned others''. No where it says that they were attacked for their refusal to accept Islam, the person only questioned whether it is necessary to extend the invitation to them for accepting Islam. Moreover the tribe Banu Mustaliq started was gathering people to attack the Muslims and Prophet killed those who conspired to kill the Muslim community. \r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nSome historians said this expedition occurred in 5 AH, and some said 6 AH. But, the 5 AH (627 CE) is more reliable. See the reason behind it:\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n\"...The cause of the Ghazwa (battle) was the information that Harith b. Abu Dhirar, the chief of Banu Mustaliq, instigated the young men of his tribe and those of the surrounding tribes against the Muslims. To confirm the news, Prophet (Peace be upon him) sent Abu Buraida b. Husayb, and he had reported about their preparations for fighting. The Prophet (Peace be upon him) called for the assembly of the soldiers, they assembled in hundreds within no time...\"\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n\"...The Prophet (Peace be upon him) appointed Zaid b. Haritha as the caretaker of Madinah, and himself with his army left for Banu Mustaliq on Monday, Sha'ban two. The command of the advance party was given in the hand of Umar, the Great. When Harith received the news of the Prophet's expedition, besides, the news of apprehension of a spy of his, he lost his wits. His hosts left him amidst of the adversity, he, along with a small band of his tribe's men, remained after to bear the brunt of his misdeeds. The Prophet (Peace be upon him) continued to move forward until his army reached the spring of Muraysi. The tent of the Prophet (Peace be upon him) was erected there, and the army arrayed. The standard of Muhajireen was in the hands of Abu Bakr, and that of Ansar with Sa'ad b. Abdullah. The war code of the Muslims for the day was 'Ya Mansoor, Amit Amit!'. For the first part of the day, the parties shoot arrows to each other and then the Prophet (Peace be upon him) ordered to attack on the enemy altogether. In a very short span of time, ten of the enemies were killed, and rest were arrested...!\"\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n[Ziya-un-Nabi (Light of the Prophet), by Pir Muhammad Karam Shah Az'hari; Vol. 3, Pg. 389, Tr.

Agniveer is being Mayavi (Vedic fraud) to the fullest, it is actually Veda which says to kill those who denounce Vedas,\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nRig Veda 2.23.4 ”O God and learned person! you take the people to the target through the path of religion and justice and protect them.

Killing Women and Children\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nSAHIH MUSLIM Chapter 9 : PERMISSIBILITY OF KILLING WOMEN AND CHILDREN IN THE NIGHT RAIDS\r\n\r\nBook 19, Number 4321:It is reported on the authority of Sa’b b. Jaththama that the Prophet of Allah (may peace be upon him), when asked about the women and children of the polytheists being killed during the night raid, said: They are from them.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nBook 19, Number 4322:It is narrated by Sa’b b. Jaththama that he said (to the Holy Prophet): Messenger of Allah, we kill the children of the polytheists during the night raids. He said: They are from them.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nBook 19, Number 4323:Sa’b b. Jaththama has narrated that the Prophet (may peace be upon him) asked: What about the children of polytheists killed by the cavalry during the night raid? He said: They are from them.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nComment: What additional gospel do terrorists need to plant bombs, hijack planes and conduct 26\/11 or 9\/11!\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nMY RESPONSE:\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nMy question to Agniveer is, did holy Prophet ordered to kill children and women? It is about women and children being killed mistakenly, That’s talking about night raid, The children and women were killed in the night by mistake when there is no sunlight. Or it could be that children also participated in the battle.The title of this chapter is “Chapter: Permissibility of killing women and children in night raids, so long as it is not done deliberately”\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nProphet forbade Killing of women and children, \r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nSahih Muslim Book 019, Number 4319: It is narrated on the authority of 'Abdullah that a woman was found killed in one of the battles fought by the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him).He disapproved of the killing of women and children.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nSahih Muslim Book 019, Number 4320: It is narrated by Ibn 'Umar that a woman was found killed in one of these battles; so theMessenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) forbade the killing of women and children.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nSahih Bukhari Volume 004, Book 052, Hadith Number 257: Narrated By 'Abdullah : During some of the Ghazawat of the Prophet a woman was found killed. Allah's Apostle disapproved the killing of women and children.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nVolume 004, Book 052, Hadith Number 258: Narrated By Ibn 'Umar : During some of the Ghazawat of Allah's Apostle a woman was found killed, so Allah's Apostle forbade the killing of women and children.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nMaliks Muwatta Section : Prohibition against Killing Women and Children in Military Expeditions. \r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nMalik’s Muwatta Book 021, Hadith Number 009: Yahya related to me from Malik from Nafi from Ibn Umar that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, saw the corpse of a woman who had been slain in one of the raids, and he disapproved of it and forbade the killing of women and children.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nNow forget about children and women, the companions of Prophet used to forgive their defeated enemies. How can Hindus clarify these verses of Vedas which commands to kill children and women?\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nYajur Veda 17.38 “O friendly countrymen, encourage the commander of the army, and begin the battle with him, who with his physical, mental and militarystrength, cleaves the enemies’ families, usurps their land, is armed with weapons, slay’s the foes, subdues the enemy in the battle, and conquers him.” Tr. Devi Chand\r\n\r\nYajur Veda 17.39 “May the commander of the army, who, with surpassing vigour pierces in the battles the families of the enemies, is pitiless, wild with anger, unconquerable by foes, conqueror of the enemy’s forces, unequalled in fight, and victor, protect our armies.” Tr. Devi Chand\r\n\r\nAtharva Veda 11.2.21 Do not covet our cattle, our men, our goats and sheep! Bend thy course elsewhere, O strong god (ugra), slay the offspring of the blasphemers!\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nManu 11:31-33 a brahman may kill anyone he wants without asking the king and the king cannot punish him\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nAtharva Veda 5.20.4-5 ”Let this war-drum victorious in the battle, loudly roaring and becoming the means of seizing whatever may be seized, be seen by all. Let this war-drum utter wonderful voice and let the army-controlling man capture the possessions of the enemies. Amid the conflict of the deadly weapons let the woman of enemy waked by the roar and afflicted run forward in her terror hearing the resounding and far reaching voice of the wardrum, holding her son in her hand.” Tr. VaidyanathShastri.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nThis is the reason Hindu terrorists doesn’t spare women and children in riots because this is what they are commanded to do.","publisher":{"@id":"#Publisher","@type":"Organization","name":"VedKaBhed.Com Fast Server","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"\/wp-content\/themes\/jannah\/assets\/images\/logo@2x.png"}},"sourceOrganization":{"@id":"#Publisher"},"copyrightHolder":{"@id":"#Publisher"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"\/index.php\/2015\/06\/21\/rebuttal-to-agniveer-if-you-kill-one-human-you-kill-entire-humanity\/","breadcrumb":{"@id":"#Breadcrumb"}},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"vedkabhed","url":"\/author\/vedkabhed\/"},"image":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/Hindu-scholars-views-Hindu-Terrorism-Hate-Speeches-1-scaled.jpeg","width":2560,"height":1485}}</script>
