Many Hindus don't even consider RSS, VHP, Bajrang Dal, Ram Sena, Sanatan Sanstha, Dharm Sena to be terrorists let alone condemning them, they consider all these terror groups to be social workers. In this article I shall mention some of the terror activities perpetrated by members of RSS, VHP, Bajrang Dal as many radical Hindus keep asking for proof of their terror activities. CIA has named VHP, Bajrang Dal as ‘religious militant organisations’ in World Factbook. The first terrorist of independent India was Nathuram Gode an alleged RSS leader who killed Mahatma Gandhi, He had close ties with RSS and Hindu Mahasabha members. As a result RSS was banned by Sardar Vallabhai Patel but the ban was lifted after RSS promised Patel that they would be away from Politics and would not contest any elections. So far RSS has been banned thrice, another time when Babri mosque was demolished.\nRight wing Hindu terror groups are immune from all criminal laws due to their political backings in fact BJP leaders gets instructions from RSS, and also due to the support it gets from huge right wing Hindu army and because of these things Hindu terror organisations are not banned. RSS, VHP, Bajrang dal has 5 million members each.<\/p>\nRSS\n<p>\nSardar Vallabhai Patel's letter to Jawaharlal Nehru\nThe Sardar's reply of September 11, 1948, was terse. While admitting that 'RSS did service to the Hindu society', he added, \"The objectionable part arose when they (RSS), burning with revenge, began attacking Mussalmans. All their speeches were full of communal poison … As a final result of that poison, the country had to suffer the sacrifice of Gandhiji … RSS men expressed joy and distributed sweets after Gandhiji's death. It became inevitable for the government to take action against the RSS.\"\nhttp://www.thehindu.com/news/national/patel-thought-rss-had-no-role-in-gandhi-killing/article7834582.ece\nYou may like to go through the following links\nhttp://thewire.in/53045/the-rss-and-gandhi-2/\nhttp://scroll.in/article/689584/how-the-sangh-parivar-systematically-attacks-the-very-idea-of-india\nhttp://www.huffingtonpost.in/2016/09/05/rss-has-shot-itself-in-the-foot-by-taking-rahul-gandhi-to-court/\n Rss workers Laxman Rajkondwar, Naresh and Himanshu who was VHP activist died making bombs in Nanded in 2006 and fake beards and skull caps were found there,\nhttp://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2008-11-23/news/28458208_1_malegaon-blast-laxman-rajkondwar-nanded\n Devendra Gupta and Sunil Joshi – have been identified in court records as “RSS pracharaks” are convicts of Ajmer Dargah blast\nhttps://scroll.in/article/831454/ajmer-blast-with-two-members-convicted-for-bombing-chisti-shrine-should-the-rss-be-banned-again\n RSS terrorist Sunil Joshi behind Samjhaura blast says former SIT chief Vikash Narain Rai\nhttp://www.thecitizen.in/index.php/NewsDetail/index/1/7875/RSS-Pracharak-Sunil-Joshi-was-100-Involved-in-Samjhauta-Blasts-Former-SIT-Chief-Rai  RSS worker Nikhil severely injured while trying to assemble bomb in Kannur, Kerala in 2014\nhttp://twocircles.net/2014sep12/1410463310.html#.V71AwKKPyV8  Two RSS men K.

It’s really unfortunate that many Hindus label entire Muslim community as terrorists but at the same time denies the existence of Hindu terrorism. Many Hindus don’t even consider RSS, VHP, Bajrang Dal, Ram Sena, Sanatan Sanstha, Dharm Sena to be terrorists let alone condemning them, they consider all these terror groups to be social workers. In this article I shall mention some of the terror activities perpetrated by members of RSS, VHP, Bajrang Dal as many radical Hindus keep asking for proof of their terror activities. <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/india/cia-names-vhp-bajrang-dal-as-religious-militant-organisations-in-world-factbook-5218249/" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">CIA has named VHP, Bajrang Dal as ‘religious militant organisations’ in World Factbook<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. The first terrorist of independent India was Nathuram Gode an alleged RSS leader who killed Mahatma Gandhi, He had close ties with RSS and Hindu Mahasabha members. As a result RSS was banned by Sardar Vallabhai Patel but the ban was lifted after RSS promised Patel that they would be away from Politics and would not contest any elections. So far RSS has been banned thrice, another time when Babri mosque was demolished.<br>
Right wing Hindu terror groups are immune from all criminal laws due to their political backings in fact BJP leaders gets instructions from RSS, and also due to the support it gets from huge right wing Hindu army and because of these things Hindu terror organisations are not banned. RSS, VHP, Bajrang dal has 5 million members each.</p>

Sardar Vallabhai Patel’s letter to Jawaharlal Nehru<br>
The Sardar’s reply of September 11, 1948, was terse. While admitting that ‘RSS did service to the Hindu society’, he added, “The objectionable part arose when they (RSS), burning with revenge, began attacking Mussalmans. All their speeches were full of communal poison … As a final result of that poison, the country had to suffer the sacrifice of Gandhiji … RSS men expressed joy and distributed sweets after Gandhiji’s death. It became inevitable for the government to take action against the RSS.”<br>

Many Hindus don't even consider RSS","copyrightYear":"2011","articleSection":"Politics,Violence","articleBody":"\r\nBy Sulaiman Razvi\r\n\r\nIt's really unfortunate that many Hindus label entire Muslim community as terrorists but at the same time denies the existence of Hindu terrorism. Many Hindus don't even consider RSS, VHP, Bajrang Dal, Ram Sena, Sanatan Sanstha, Dharm Sena to be terrorists let alone condemning them, they consider all these terror groups to be social workers. In this article I shall mention some of the terror activities perpetrated by members of RSS, VHP, Bajrang Dal as many radical Hindus keep asking for proof of their terror activities. CIA has named VHP, Bajrang Dal as ‘religious militant organisations’ in World Factbook. The first terrorist of independent India was Nathuram Gode an alleged RSS leader who killed Mahatma Gandhi, He had close ties with RSS and Hindu Mahasabha members. As a result RSS was banned by Sardar Vallabhai Patel but the ban was lifted after RSS promised Patel that they would be away from Politics and would not contest any elections. So far RSS has been banned thrice, another time when Babri mosque was demolished.\r\nRight wing Hindu terror groups are immune from all criminal laws due to their political backings in fact BJP leaders gets instructions from RSS, and also due to the support it gets from huge right wing Hindu army and because of these things Hindu terror organisations are not banned. RSS, VHP, Bajrang dal has 5 million members each.\r\nRSS\r\n\r\nSardar Vallabhai Patel's letter to Jawaharlal Nehru\r\nThe Sardar's reply of September 11, 1948, was terse. While admitting that 'RSS did service to the Hindu society', he added, \"The objectionable part arose when they (RSS), burning with revenge, began attacking Mussalmans. All their speeches were full of communal poison … As a final result of that poison, the country had to suffer the sacrifice of Gandhiji … RSS men expressed joy and distributed sweets after Gandhiji's death. It became inevitable for the government to take action against the RSS.\"\r\nhttp:\/\/www.thehindu.com\/news\/national\/patel-thought-rss-had-no-role-in-gandhi-killing\/article7834582.ece\r\nYou may like to go through the following links\r\nhttp:\/\/thewire.in\/53045\/the-rss-and-gandhi-2\/\r\nhttp:\/\/scroll.in\/article\/689584\/how-the-sangh-parivar-systematically-attacks-the-very-idea-of-india\r\nhttp:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.in\/2016\/09\/05\/rss-has-shot-itself-in-the-foot-by-taking-rahul-gandhi-to-court\/\r\n Rss workers Laxman Rajkondwar, Naresh and Himanshu who was VHP activist died making bombs in Nanded in 2006 and fake beards and skull caps were found there,\r\nhttp:\/\/articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com\/2008-11-23\/news\/28458208_1_malegaon-blast-laxman-rajkondwar-nanded\r\n Devendra Gupta and Sunil Joshi – have been identified in court records as “RSS pracharaks” are convicts of Ajmer Dargah blast\r\nhttps:\/\/scroll.in\/article\/831454\/ajmer-blast-with-two-members-convicted-for-bombing-chisti-shrine-should-the-rss-be-banned-again\r\n RSS terrorist Sunil Joshi behind Samjhaura blast says former SIT chief Vikash Narain Rai\r\nhttp:\/\/www.thecitizen.in\/index.php\/NewsDetail\/index\/1\/7875\/RSS-Pracharak-Sunil-Joshi-was-100-Involved-in-Samjhauta-Blasts-Former-SIT-Chief-Rai \r\n RSS worker Nikhil severely injured while trying to assemble bomb in Kannur, Kerala in 2014\r\nhttp:\/\/twocircles.net\/2014sep12\/1410463310.html#.V71AwKKPyV8\r\n\r\n Two RSS men K.
