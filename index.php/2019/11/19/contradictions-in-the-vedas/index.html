<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;">Do mention the blog address and name of writer when you copy this article</span></span></p>
<p>This article deals with contradictions in Vedas more particularly the Rig Veda. Contradictions in religious scriptures prove that either it is not a word of God because a god cannot make mistakes, or it is that the scripture underwent interpolations over time resulting in conflicting views within the scripture. Books like The Oriental Studies by John Muir and Vedic Mythology by Arthur Anthony Macdonell were very helpful on this topic, I have taken some points from my previous articles as well. Due to time constraints, I couldn’t write more, if God wills then I will add more contradictions in this article. And I request you to please mention the blog link when you copy this article, appreciate the hard work of writers by crediting the writer.</p>

<li><span style="color: #0070c0; text-decoration: underline;"><strong>WHAT DID THE ASHWINS DRAW FROM HOOF OF THE HORSE?</strong><br>
</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>100 Jars of Sura (wine)<br>
</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.116.7 “O Heroes, ye gave wisdom to Kakṣīvān who sprang from Pajra’s line, who sang your praises. Ye poured forth from the hoof of your strong charger a hundred jars of wine as from a strainer.” Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p><strong>100 Jars of Madhu (honey)</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.117.6 “Kakṣīvān, Pajra’s son, must laud that exploit of yours, Nāsatyas, Heroes, ye who wander! When from the hoof of your strong horse ye showered a hundred jars of honey for the people.” Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>Madhu sometime also denotes wine but that’s probably not applicable here. If it meant sweet wine then the word Sura should have also been used here which is not the case. It clearly says that Ashwins (Nasatyas) drew 100 jars of Madhu (Honey).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #0070c0;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">WHO RAISED UP THE CLOUD AND SHOWERED IT FOR RISHI GAUTAMA?</span><br>
</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><br>
Maruts<br>
</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.85.10-11 “They with their vigorous strength pushed the well up on high, and clove the cloud in twain though it was passing strong. The Maruts, bounteous Givers, sending forth their voice, in the wild joy of Soma wrought their glorious deeds. They drave the cloud transverse directed hitherward, and poured the fountain forth for thirsting Gotama…” Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p><strong>Nasatyas/Ashwins</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.116.9 “Ye lifted up the well, O ye Nasatyas, and set the base on high to open downward. Streams flowed for folk of Gotama who thirsted, like rain to bring forth thousandfold abundance.” Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #0070c0; text-decoration: underline;"><strong>WHO HEALED BLIND &amp; CRIPPLED RISHI PARAVRIK/PARAVRIJ?<br>
</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><br>
Ashwins</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.112.8 “Mighty Ones, with what powers ye gave Parāvṛj aid what time ye made the blind and lame to see and walk…” Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p><strong>Indra<br>
</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 2.15.7 “Conscious of the disappearance of the damsels, the (Rishi) Parivrij, becoming manifest, stood up; the lame man overtook (them), the blind man beheld (them): in the exhilaration of the Soma, Indra has done these (deeds).” Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Griffith’s translation is not clear hence I quoted Wilson’s translation here but Ralph T.H. Griffith writes in the footnotes of this verse, “Paravrij, here rendered ‘the outcast,’ is taken by Sayana as the name of a Rishi who was lame and blind. When some girls made sport of him he prayed to Indra and was made sound.”</p>
<p><strong>Soma</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.25.11 “This to the sage who offers gifts brings power that comes from wealth in kine.</p>
<p>This, better than the seven, hath-at your glad carouse-furthered the blind, the cripple. Thou art waxing great.” Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #0070c0;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">WHO BESTOWED IMMORTALITY ON GODS/HOW DID THE GODS ATTAIN IMMORTALITY?</span><br>
</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><br>
Rohita </strong></p>
<p>Atharva Veda 13.1.7 “Rohita made firm heaven and earth, by him the (heavenly) light was established, by him the firmament. By him the atmosphere and the spaces were measured out, through him the gods obtained immortality.” Tr. Maurice Bloomfield</p>
<p><strong>Savitar</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 4.54.2; Yajur Veda 33.54 “For thou at first producest for the holy Gods the noblest of all portions, immortality: Thereafter as a gift to men, O Savitar, thou openest existence, life succeeding life.” Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p><strong>Agni</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 6.7.4 “To thee, Immortal! when to life thou springest, all the Gods sing for joy as to their infant. They by thy mental powers were made immortal, Vaiśvānara, when thou shonest from thy Parents.” Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 4.23.6 “Through whom the Gods discovered life eternal…” Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 32.10 “He is our kin, our Father and Begetter: he knows all beings and all Ordinances, In whom the Gods obtaining life eternal have risen upward to the third high station.” Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p><strong>By drinking Soma</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 9.106.8 “Thy drops that swim in water have exalted Indra to delight: The Gods have drunk thee up for immortality.” Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p><strong>Kushtha plant regarded as immortal<br>
</strong></p>
<p>Atharva Veda 6.95.2 “There moved through heaven a golden ship, a ship with cordage wrought of gold. There Gods obtained the Kushtha plant, the flower of immortality.” Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #0070c0; text-decoration: underline;"><strong>SUN TRAVELS BY MARES OR HORSES?<br>
</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mares<br>
</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.50.9 “The Sun has yoked the seven mares that safely draw his chariot…” Tr. H.H. Wilson<span style="font-family: Segoe Print;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><strong>Horses</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 5.45.9 “Borne by his Coursers Seven may Sūrya visit the field that spreadeth wide for his long journey…” Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #0070c0;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">WHO FIRST GAVE SOMA TO INDRA?</span><br>
</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><br>
Aditi &amp; Kashyapa<br>
</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 3.48.2 “On the day on which thou wast born, thou didst drink at will the mountain-abiding nectar of this Soma plant, for thy youthful parent mother (Aditi), in the dwelling of thy great sire (Kasyapa), gave it to thee before she gave the breast.” Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Rig Veda 7.98.3 “As soon as born, Indra, thou hast drunk the Soma for thine invigoration: thy mother (Aditi) proclaimed thy greatness…” Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p><strong>Falcon Suparna<br>
</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 3.43.7 “Drink of the strong pressed out by strong ones, Indra, that which the Falcon brought thee when thou longedst…” Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>According to the story, Soma was not available to gods, the falcon Suparna was the first one to bring Soma to Vedic gods.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #0070c0; text-decoration: underline;"><strong>WHOM DID INDRA KILL AFTER DRINKING SOMA BROUGHT DOWN BY THE FALCON?<br>
</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><br>
Indra killed Vritra</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.80.2 “That exceedingly exhilarating Soma juice, which was brought by the hawk, (from heaven), when poured forth, has exhilarated thee, so that, in thy vigour, thunderer, thou hast struck Vritra from the sky, manifesting thine own sovereignty.” Tr. H.H. Willson</p>
<p><strong>Indra killed Namuchi</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 6.20.6 “And the hawk bore to Indra the exhilarating Soma, when, bruising the head of the oppressor Namuchi…” Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #0070c0;">SOMA WAS BROUGHT DOWN FOR WHOM?</span><br>
</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Verses suggesting that the Soma was brought for Indra</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 6.20.6 “And the hawk bore to Indra the exhilarating Soma, when, bruising the head of the oppressor Namuchi…” Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Rig Veda 3.43.7 “Drink of the strong pressed out by strong ones, Indra, that which the Falcon brought thee when thou longedst…” Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p><strong>Brought for Humans to perform sacrifices</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 4.26.4 “May this bird, Maruts, be pre-eminent over (other) hawks, since with a wheelless car the swift-winged bore the Soma, accepted by the gods, to Manu.” Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Humans are mentioned as Manu in above verse. Following verse states that Vedic god Agni commanded the eagle to bring down the Soma and suggests that it was brought for the Aryans for the sacrifice,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.11.4 “The hawk sent (by Agni) to the sacrifice has brought the dripping copious all-seeing (Soma) libation. When the Arya people chose the victorious Agni as the ministrant priest, then the sacred rite is celebrated.” Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>100 Castles/Cities<br>
</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 2.14.6 “Ye ministers, to him who as with thunder demolished Śambara’s hundred ancient castles…” Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>Though it is mentioned elsewhere that Indra gave the hundredth castle to Divodasa but Rig Veda 2.14.6 talks about demolishing all 100 castles.</p>
<p>Rig Veda 6.31.4 “Thou smotest to the ground the hundred castles, impregnable, of Sambara the Dasyu…” Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p><strong>90 Castles/Cities</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.130.7 “For Pūru thou hast shattered, Indra ninety forts, for Divodāsa thy boon servant with thy bolt, O Dancer, for thy worshipper. For Atithigva he, the Strong, brought Śambara from the mountain down…” Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p><strong>99 Castles/Cities<br>
</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 2.19.6 “…And Indra, for the sake of Divodasa demolished Sambara’s nine-and-ninety castles.” Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Unsure about creator<br>
</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.129.6-7 Who verily knows and who can here declare it, whence it was born and whence comes this creation? The Gods are later than this world’s production. Who knows then whence it first came into being? He, the first origin of this creation, whether he formed it all or did not form it, Whose eye controls this world in highest heaven, he verily knows it, or perhaps he knows not.</p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.185.1 “Which of these two, (Heaven and Earth), is prior, which posterior; how were they engendered; (declare), sages, who knows this? verily, you uphold the universe of itself, and the days (and nights) revovle as if they had wheels.” Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>

<p><strong>Ribhus<br>
</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 4.34.9 “Ṛbhus, who helped their Parents and the Aśvins, who formed the Milch-cow and the pair of horses, Made armour, set the heaven and earth asunder,—far- reaching Heroes, they have made good offspring.” Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p><strong>Hiranyagarba<br>
</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.121.9 “Neer may he harm us who is earth’s Begetter, nor he whose laws are sure, the heavens’ Creator, He who brought forth the great and lucid waters. What God shall we adore with our oblation?” Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Nasadiya Sukta version</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.72.1-4 Let us proclaim with a clear voice the generations of the gods (the divine company), who, when their praises are recited, look (favourably on the worshipper) in this latter age. Brahmanaspati filled these (generations of the gods) with breath as a blacksmith (his bellows) in the first age of the gods the existent was born of the non-existent. In the first age of the gods the existent was born of the non-existent; after that the quarters (of the horizon) were born, and after them the upward-growing (trees). The earth was born from the upward-growing (tree), the quarters were born from the earth; Daksha was born from Aditi, and afterwards Aditi from Daksha. – Tr. H.H Wilson</p>
<p><strong>Purusha Sukta version</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.90.8-14 “From that great general sacrifice the dripping fat was gathered up…</p>
<p>He formed the creatures of-the air, and animals both wild and tame. From it were horses born, from it all cattle with two rows of teeth: From it were generated kine, from it the goats and sheep were born…The Moon was gendered from his mind, and from his eye the Sun had birth; Indra and Agni from his mouth were born, and Vāyu from his breath. Forth from his navel came mid-air the sky was fashioned from his head Earth from his feet, and from his car the regions. Thus they formed the worlds.” Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>

<p><strong>Earth and Heaven were created by God(s)<br>
</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 4.34.9 “Ṛbhus, who helped their Parents and the Aśvins, who formed the Milch-cow and the pair of horses, Made armour, set the heaven and earth asunder,—far- reaching Heroes, they have made good offspring.” Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>This is the biggest blunder here, Veda states that Ribhus were mortals and attained godhood through their deeds (Rig Veda 4.35.8) then how come it were them who created earth and heaven? Another blunder mentioned below is that Veda are confused about who created earth and heaven, what was created first, the earth or the heaven?<strong><br>
</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.185.1 “Which of these two, (Heaven and Earth), is prior, which posterior; how were they engendered; (declare), sages, who knows this? verily, you uphold the universe of itself, and the days (and nights) revovle as if they had wheels.” Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Creation of earth and heaven is ascribed to various deities such as to Soma and Pushan (Rig Veda 2.40.1); Dhatr (Rig Veda 5.190.3); Hiranyagarbha (Rig Veda 10.121.9); Purusha (Rig Veda 10.90.14)</p>

<p>Rig Veda 10.85.3-4 One thinks, when they have brayed the plant, that he hath drunk the Soma’s juice; Of him whom Brahmans truly know as Soma no one ever tastes. Soma, secured by sheltering rules, guarded by hymns in Brhati, Thou standest listening to the stones none tastes of thee who dwells on earth.</p>
<p><strong>Even non-Aryan tribes possessed Soma</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 3.43.14 states that Kikatas brings no Soma mixed with milk to the Vedic deities which suggests that even non-Aryan Kikatas inhabiting in present day Bihar possessed Soma and tasted Soma. Moreover there are also verses stating that Soma was with the Gandharvas and there are many such verses which states Soma was drunk on earth which contradicts above verse which says that no one has ever tasted Soma on earth.</p>

<p><strong>Seven<br>
</strong></p>
<p>Rig 9.114.3 “Seven regions have their several Suns; the ministering priests are seven; Seven are the Āditya Deities…” Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p><strong>Eight<br>
</strong></p>
<p>Atharva Veda 8.9.21 “…Eight are the wombs of Aditi, eight her children…” Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p><strong>Six<br>
</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 2.27.1 “THESE hymns that drop down fatness, with the ladle I ever offer to the Kings Ādityas. May Mitra, Aryaman, and Bhaga hear us, the mighty Varuṇa Dakṣa, and Aṁśa.” Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>In later texts the number of Adityas given are twelve. But we are dealing only with the Vedas which gives varying numbers. Rig Veda 10.72.8 is much clear about number of Adityas, it states that there were total number of eight Adityas of whom Martanda died and was later brought back to life. Rig Veda 2.27.1 mentions six Adityas by their names, they are Mitra, Aryaman, Bhaga, Varuṇa, Dakṣa and Aṁśa. Atharva Veda 11.6.2 mentions all these with Vivasvan also, Rig Veda verse quoted earlier mentions Martanda as an Aditya, so now we know eight Adityas by name.</p>
<p>So let’s assume that number of Adityas given in Vedas are eight but it makes the situation more complex because apart from those eight Adityas, Veda mentions various other deities as Adityas. In Atharva Veda 13.2.29, 37 Surya is called Aditya and son of Aditi. In Atharva Veda 8.2.15 Sun &amp; Moon are called two sons of Aditi, Rig Veda 8.90.11 calls Surya (sun) as Aditya. Rig Veda 8.18.3 also mentions Savitar as Aditya but for the sake of argument lets count Savitar as sun here. Indra is considered Aditya along with Varuna in Rig Veda 7.85.4, however in Rig Veda 5.51.10 Indra is mentioned separately from Adityas.</p>

<p>Rig Veda 8.13.28 “Attendants on thy glory, let the Rudras roar assent to thee, And all the Marut companies come to the feast.” Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.92.6 “Straightway the Rudras, Maruts visiting all men, Falcons of Dyaus, home-dwellers with the Asura…” Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>Rig Veda 3.32.2 “…Knit with the prayer-fulfilling band of Maruts, yea, with the Rudras, drink till thou art sated;” Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #0070c0;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">HOW MANY RUDRAS ARE THERE?</span><br>
</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Thousands and innumerable<br>
</strong></p>
<p>Yajur Veda 16.54 “Innumerable thousands are the Rudras on the face of earth…” Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p><strong>Hundred<br>
</strong></p>
<p>Yajur Veda 21.43 “…belonging to the Hundred Rudras…” Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p><strong>Eleven<br>
</strong></p>
<p>Yajur Veda 34.47 “Come, O Nâsatyas, with the thrice eleven Gods: come…” Tr. Ralph T. H. Griffith</p>
<p>Black Yajur Veda 3.4.9.7 “…the Rudras are eleven…” Tr. Arthur Berriedale Keith</p>
<p>There is no clear mention of 11 Rudras in the Veda. However Yajur Veda verse quoted above seems to explain number of Rudras, Adityas and other group of deities. Later text like Taittriya Samhita (Black Yajur Veda) is clear on number of Rudras.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #0070c0; text-decoration: underline;"><strong>WHO WAS THE FIRST ONE TO DRINK SOMA?<br>
</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Brahman (Supreme God)<br>
</strong></p>
<p>Atharva Veda 4.6.1. The Brâhmana was the first to be born, with ten heads and ten mouths. He was the first to drink the soma; that did render poison powerless.</p>
<p><strong>Vayu<br>
</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 4.46.1 “DRINK the best draught of Soma-juice, O Vāyu, at our holy rites: For thou art he who drinketh first.” Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.134.1 Vayu, let fleet-foot coursers bring thee speedily to this our feast, to drink first of the juice we pour, to the first draught of Soma juice.</p>
<p>Rig Veda 2.11.14 …the Vayus, who drink the first libation of the Soma.</p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.135.4 … Vāyu, to taste the offerings! Drink of the pleasant-flavoured juice: the first draught is assigned to you.</p>
<p><strong>Indra<br>
</strong></p>
<p>Atharva Veda 20.99.1; Rig Veda 3.36.8 says that Indra was invited to drink Soma first. These two verses may be in a sense of Indra being invited at sacrifices to drink Soma first but contradiction can’t be ignored. Some verses states that Vayu was the first drinker and some later texts like Aitareya Brahmana elaborating this story says that there was a race between gods on who should partake Soma first, Vayu won the competition and Indra came second. But this story is in contradiction with story of falcon Suparna bringing Soma to Indra. Rig Veda states that the falcon had brought the Soma, Krishna Yajur Veda is more clear in this case wherein it states that the gods didn’t had Soma and Soma was brought by the falcon.</p>

<p><strong>Brihaspati<br>
</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 6.73.1 “Served with oblations, first-born, mountain-render, Aṅgiras’ son, Bṛhaspati, the Holy, With twice-firm path, dwelling in light, our Father, roars loudly, as a bull, to Earth and Heaven.” Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p><strong>Tvashtar<br>

</ul>
<p><strong>Maruts helped Indra kill Sambara<br>
</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 3.47.4 “Drink Soma, Indra, banded with the Maruts who, Maghavan, strengthened thee at Ahi’s slaughter, ‘Gainst Śambara, Lord of Bays! in winning cattle, and now rejoice in thee, the holy Singers.” Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p><strong>Brahmanaspati<br>
</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 2.24.2 “He who with might bowed down the things that should be bowed, and in his fury rent the holds of Sambara: Who overthrew what shook not, Brahmapaspati,-he made his way within the mountain stored with wealth.” Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p><strong>Indra<br>
</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.54.4 “The ridges of the lofty heaven thou madest shake; thou, daring, of thyself smotest through Śambara…” Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>

<li><span style="color: #0070c0; text-decoration: underline;"><strong>WHO PREPARED PATH FOR THE SUN TO TRAVEL?<br>
</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Varuna<br>
</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.24.8 “King Varuṇa hath made a spacious pathway, a pathway for the Sun wherein to travel…” Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p><strong>Several Varuna included<br>
</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 7.60.3 Your coursers rich in store of sweets have mounted: to the bright ocean Sūrya hath ascended, For whom the Ādityas make his pathway ready, Aryaman, Mitra, Varuṇa, accordant.</p>
<p><strong>Usha (Dawn)<br>
</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.113.16 “Arise! the breath, the life, again hath reached us: darkness hath passed away and light approacheth. She for the Sun hath left a path to travel we have arrived where men prolong existence.” Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p><strong>Indra<br>
</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.111.3 “Indra knows, verily, how to hear our singing, for he, victorious, made a path for Sūrya.” Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #0070c0;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">WHAT WAS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN KUTSA AND INDRA?</span><br>
</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Friends<br>
</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 4.16.10 “Come to our home resolved to slay the Dasyu: Kutsa longed eagerly to win thy friendship. Alike in form ye both sate in his dwelling the faithful Lady was in doubt between you.” Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p><strong>Enemies</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.53.10 “Thou hast protected Suśravas with succour, and Tūrvayāṇa with thine aid, O Indra. Thou madest Kutsa, Atithigva, Āyu, subject unto this King, the young, the mighty.” Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>Rig Veda 2.14.7 “Ye ministers, to him who slew a hundred thousand, and cast them down upon earth’s bosom; Who quelled the valiant men of Atithigva, Kutsa, and Āyu,—bring to him the Soma.” Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>There are also verses wherein Indra aided Kutsa in battle against Kutsa’s enemies suggesting their friendly relationship. Later texts like Brahmanas gives different story that Kutsa was the son of Indra born from his thighs. Though Veda calls Kutsa as son of Arjuna (Rig Veda 8.1.11). If that is applied here then there will be another contradiction because Veda calls Indra and Kutsa as friends so there would be contradiction in their relationship.</p>

<ul>
<li><span style="color: #0070c0; text-decoration: underline;"><strong>WHO WAS THE FIRST SACRIFICER?<br>

<p><strong>Atharvan<br>
</strong></p>
<p>Atharva Veda 19.4.1 “The first oblation that Atharvan oared, earliest sacrifice paid by Jātavedas…” Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.92.10 “For these have spread abroad the fame of human kind, the Bull Bṛhaspati and Soma’s brotherhood. Atharvan first by sacrifices made men sure: through skill the Bhṛgus were esteemed of all as Gods.” Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p><strong>Dasagvas<br>
</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 2.34.12 “They, the Daśagvas, first of all brought sacrifice: they at the break of mornings shall inspirit us…” Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Bow and Arrows</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 2.33.10 “Worthy, thou carriest thy bow and arrows, worthy, thy many hued and honoured necklace. Worthy, thou cuttest here each fiend to pieces: a mightier than thou there is not, Rudra.” Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>Rig Veda 5.42.11 “Praise him whose bow is strong and sure his arrow, him who is Lord of every balm that bealeth. Worship thou Rudra…” Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p><strong>Thunderbolt/Lightning<br>
</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 2.33.3 “Chief of all born art thou in glory, Rudra, armed with the thunder, mightiest of the mighty…” Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 11.2.26 “O’erwhelm us not with Fever or with poison, nor, Rudra! with the fire that comes from heaven. Elsewhere, and not on us, cast down this lightning.” Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>In Rig Veda 7.6.3 Griffith has translated the word Didyut as bright arrow but the correct word is lightning which is rightly translated by many other translators.</p>

Contradictions in religious scriptures prove that either it is not a word of God because a god cannot make mistakes, or it is that the scripture underwent interpolations over time resulting in conflicting views within the scripture. Books like The Oriental Studies by John Muir and Vedic Mythology by Arthur Anthony Macdonell were very helpful on this topic, I have taken some points from my previous articles as well. Due to time constraints, I couldn't write more, if God wills then I will add more contradictions in this article.

Ye poured forth from the hoof of your strong charger a hundred jars of wine as from a strainer.\" Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith\r\n\r\n100 Jars of Madhu (honey)\r\n\r\nRig Veda 1.117.6 \"Kakṣīvān, Pajra's son, must laud that exploit of yours, Nāsatyas, Heroes, ye who wander! When from the hoof of your strong horse ye showered a hundred jars of honey for the people.\" Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith\r\n\r\nMadhu sometime also denotes wine but that's probably not applicable here. If it meant sweet wine then the word Sura should have also been used here which is not the case. It clearly says that Ashwins (Nasatyas) drew 100 jars of Madhu (Honey).\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \tWHO RAISED UP THE CLOUD AND SHOWERED IT FOR RISHI GAUTAMA?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMaruts\r\n\r\n\r\nRig Veda 1.85.10-11 \"They with their vigorous strength pushed the well up on high, and clove the cloud in twain though it was passing strong. The Maruts, bounteous Givers, sending forth their voice, in the wild joy of Soma wrought their glorious deeds. They drave the cloud transverse directed hitherward, and poured the fountain forth for thirsting Gotama…\" Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith\r\n\r\nNasatyas\/Ashwins\r\n\r\nRig Veda 1.116.9 \"Ye lifted up the well, O ye Nasatyas, and set the base on high to open downward. Streams flowed for folk of Gotama who thirsted, like rain to bring forth thousandfold abundance.\" Tr. Ralph T.H.

Ralph T.H. Griffith\r\n\r\nIndra\r\n\r\n\r\nRig Veda 2.15.7 \"Conscious of the disappearance of the damsels, the (Rishi) Parivrij, becoming manifest, stood up; the lame man overtook (them), the blind man beheld (them): in the exhilaration of the Soma, Indra has done these (deeds).\" Tr. H.H. Wilson\r\n\r\nGriffith's translation is not clear hence I quoted Wilson's translation here but Ralph T.H. Griffith writes in the footnotes of this verse, \"Paravrij, here rendered 'the outcast,' is taken by Sayana as the name of a Rishi who was lame and blind.

Griffith\r\n\r\nRig Veda 10.17.1-2 \"TVASTAR prepares the bridal of his Daughter: all the world hears the tidings and assembles. But Yama's Mother, Spouse of great Vivasvān, vanished as she was carried to her dwelling. From mortal men they hid the Immortal Lady, made one like her and gave her to Vivasvān. Saranyu brought to him the Aśvin brothers, and then deserted both twinned pairs of children.\" Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith\r\n\r\nGandharva & Water nymph (Apya Yosa)\r\n\r\n\r\nRig Veda 10.10.4 \"(Yama speaks). We have not done what was done formerly; for how can we who speak truth, utter now that which is untrue? Gandharva (the sun) was in the watery (firmament), and the water was his bride. She is our common parent, hence our near affinity.\" Tr. H.H. Wilson\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \tHOW MANY SOLDIERS OF ASURA KRISHNA DID INDRA KILL?\r\n\r\n\r\nFifty thousand\r\n\r\n\r\nRig Veda 4.16.13 \"Thou hast subjugated Pipru and the mighty Mrigaya for the sake of Rijsiwan the son of Vidathin, thou hast slain the fifty thousand Krishnas; and, as old age (destroys) life, thou hast demolished the cities (of Sambara).\" Tr. H.H. Wilson\r\n\r\nTen thousand\r\n\r\nRig Veda 8.86.13 \"The swift-moving Krishna with ten thousand (demons) stood on the Amsumati; by his might Indra caught him snorting (in the water); he, benevolent to man, smote his malicious (bands).\" Tr. H.H. Wilson\r\n\r\nThis verse occurs in Rig Veda 8.85.13 of Griffith's translation.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \tWHO HAS TASTED SOMA ON EARTH?\r\n\r\n\r\nNo one has ever tasted Soma on the earth\r\n\r\n\r\nRig Veda 10.85.3-4 One thinks, when they have brayed the plant, that he hath drunk the Soma's juice; Of him whom Brahmans truly know as Soma no one ever tastes. Soma, secured by sheltering rules, guarded by hymns in Brhati, Thou standest listening to the stones none tastes of thee who dwells on earth.\r\n\r\nEven non-Aryan tribes possessed Soma\r\n\r\nRig Veda 3.43.14 states that Kikatas brings no Soma mixed with milk to the Vedic deities which suggests that even non-Aryan Kikatas inhabiting in present day Bihar possessed Soma and tasted Soma. Moreover there are also verses stating that Soma was with the Gandharvas and there are many such verses which states Soma was drunk on earth which contradicts above verse which says that no one has ever tasted Soma on earth.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \tWHERE DO THE MARUTS DWELL?\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Heaven\r\n\r\nRig Veda 5.60.6 \"Whether, O blessed Maruts, ye be dwelling in highest, midmost, or in lowest heaven…\" Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith\r\n\r\nIn the Mountains\r\n\r\n\r\nRig Veda 8.83.12 \"That vigorous band of Maruts that abidetb in the mountains, I Invoke to drink this Soma juice.\" Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \tAGNI IS REGARDED AS OF TAKEN HOW MANY BIRTHS?\r\n\r\n\r\nThree Births\r\n\r\n\r\nRig Veda 4.1.7 \"Three are those births, the true, the most exalted, eagerly longed-for, of the God, of Agni…\" Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith\r\n\r\nRig Veda 1.95.3 \"Three several places of his birth they honour, in mid-air, in the heaven, and in the waters…\" Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith\r\n\r\nTwo Births\r\n\r\nRig Veda 1.149.4 \"He, doubly born, hath spread in his effulgence through the three luminous realms, through all the regions…\" Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith\r\n\r\nRig Veda 8.43.28 \"O Agni, made by strength! be thou born in the heavens or born in floods, As such we call on thee with songs.\" Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \tHOW MANY ADITYAS ARE THERE?\r\n\r\n\r\nSeven\r\n\r\n\r\nRig 9.114.3 \"Seven regions have their several Suns; the ministering priests are seven; Seven are the Āditya Deities…\" Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith\r\n\r\nEight\r\n\r\n\r\nAtharva Veda 8.9.21 \"…Eight are the wombs of Aditi, eight her children…\" Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith\r\n\r\nSix\r\n\r\n\r\nRig Veda 2.27.1 \"THESE hymns that drop down fatness, with the ladle I ever offer to the Kings Ādityas. May Mitra, Aryaman, and Bhaga hear us, the mighty Varuṇa Dakṣa, and Aṁśa.\" Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith\r\n\r\nIn later texts the number of Adityas given are twelve. But we are dealing only with the Vedas which gives varying numbers. Rig Veda 10.72.8 is much clear about number of Adityas, it states that there were total number of eight Adityas of whom Martanda died and was later brought back to life. Rig Veda 2.27.1 mentions six Adityas by their names, they are Mitra, Aryaman, Bhaga, Varuṇa, Dakṣa and Aṁśa. Atharva Veda 11.6.2 mentions all these with Vivasvan also, Rig Veda verse quoted earlier mentions Martanda as an Aditya, so now we know eight Adityas by name.\r\n\r\nSo let's assume that number of Adityas given in Vedas are eight but it makes the situation more complex because apart from those eight Adityas, Veda mentions various other deities as Adityas. In Atharva Veda 13.2.29, 37 Surya is called Aditya and son of Aditi. In Atharva Veda 8.2.15 Sun & Moon are called two sons of Aditi, Rig Veda 8.90.11 calls Surya (sun) as Aditya. Rig Veda 8.18.3 also mentions Savitar as Aditya but for the sake of argument lets count Savitar as sun here. Indra is considered Aditya along with Varuna in Rig Veda 7.85.4, however in Rig Veda 5.51.10 Indra is mentioned separately from Adityas.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \tWHO IS THE MOTHER OF ADITYAS?\r\n\r\n\r\nMadhukasa\r\n\r\n\r\nAtharva Veda 9.1.4 \"Daughter of Vasus, mother of Ādityas, centre of Amrit breath of living creatures. The Honey-whip, gold-coloured, dropping fatness, moves as a mighty embryo 'mid mortals.\" Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith\r\n\r\nMadhukasa is translated as Honey-whip by Griffith.\r\n\r\nAditi\r\n\r\n\r\nRig Veda 10.72.8 \"Eight are the Sons of Adid who from her body sprang to life. With seven she went to meet the Gods she cast Martanda far away.\" Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \tWHO IS THE FATHER OF MADHUKASA?\r\n\r\n\r\nVasus\r\n\r\n\r\nAtharva Veda 9.1.4 \"Daughter of Vasus, mother of Ādityas, centre of Amrit breath of living creatures. The Honey-whip, gold-coloured, dropping fatness, moves as a mighty embryo 'mid mortals.\" Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith\r\n\r\nMaruts\r\n\r\n\r\nAtharva Veda 9.1.3 \"…For she, the first-born daughter of the Maruts, derives her origin from Wind and Agni…\" Tr. Ralph T.H.

Griffith\r\n\r\nAsvins yokes their car thence Usha is born\r\n\r\n\r\nRig Veda 10.39.12 \"Come on that Chariot which the Ṛbhus wrought for you, the Chariot, Aśvins, that is speedier than thought, At harnessing whereof Heaven's Daughter springs to birth.\" Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith\r\n\r\nWhen Usha (dawn) is born after Asvins yokes their car then how come Usha awakens Asvins?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \tWHO AWAKENS WHO?\r\n\r\n\r\nUsha (Dawn) awakens humans for worship\r\n\r\n\r\nRig Veda 1.113.9 \"As thou, Dawn, hast caused Agni to be kindled, and with the Sun's eye hast revealed creation. And hast awakened men to offer worship, thou hast performed, for Gods, a noble service.\" Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith\r\n\r\nRig Veda 1.124.10 Rouse up, O Wealthy One, the liberal givers; let niggard traffickers sleep on unwakened: Shine richly, Wealthy One, on those who worship, richly, glad.\" Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith\r\n\r\nWorshippers awakens Usha (Dawn)\r\n\r\n\r\nRig Veda 4.52.4 \"With praises we awaken thee, thou who art endowed with truth; thee, the baffler of animosities, the restorer of consciousness.\" Tr.

H.H. Wilson\r\n\r\n\r\nSoma\r\n\r\nRig Veda 6.9.3 This Soma, Indra, (quaffed by thee), has lighted up the unlustrous nights, and days and nights, and years: (the gods) of old have established it as the ensign of days, and it has made the dawns generated in light.\" Tr. H.H. Wilson\r\n\r\n\r\nAncient Fathers\r\n\r\n\r\nRig Veda 7.76.4 \"Those ancient sages, our ancestors, observant of truth, rejoicing together with the gods, discovered the hidden light, and reciters of sincere prayers, they generated the Dawn.\" Tr.

Griffith\r\n\r\nElsewhere it has been described as yellow coloured and golden coloured. But above verses doesn't describe colour of the thunderbolt but describes the metal.\r\n\r\nStone\r\n\r\nRig Veda 7.104.5 \"Indra and Soma, cast ye downward out of heaven your deadly darts of stone burning with fiery flame… [19] Hurl down from heaven thy bolt of stone, O Indra…\" Tr.

Griffith\r\n\r\nRig Veda 1.93.6 states that Matarisvan brought Agni from heaven, if Agni was Matarisvan then how would he bring himself from heaven? Rig Veda 3.2.13 further strengthens the argument that Agni and Matarisvan are two separate entities. Moreover Nirukta 7.26 considers Matarisvan as Vayu (air).\r\n\r\nBrihaspati\r\n\r\n\r\nRig Veda 1.190.2 \"…Bṛhaspati—for he laid out the expanses—was, at the sacrifice, vast Mātariśvan.\" Tr.

Draw nigh then to the gracious-minded Fathers where they rejoice in company with Yama. And those two dogs of thine, Yama, the watchers, four-eyed, who look on men and guard the pathway,—Entrust this man, O King, to their protection, and with prosperity and health endow him. Dark-hued, insatiate, with distended nostrils, Yama's two envoys roam among the People; May they restore to us a fair existence here and to-day, that we may see the sunlight.\" Tr. Ralph T.H.

Griffith\r\n\r\nSpokes here also signify seasons.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \tARE MARUTS SAME AS RUDRAS OR DIFFERENT ENTITIES?\r\n\r\n\r\nMaruts identified as Rudras\r\n\r\nRig Veda 1.64.2 \"They spring to birth, the lofty Ones, the Bulls of Heaven, divine, the youths of Rudra, free from spot and stain; The purifiers, shining brightly even as suns, awful of form like giants, scattering rain-drops down.\" Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith\r\n\r\nRig Veda 7.56.1-2 \"Who are these radiant men in serried rank, Rudra's young heroes borne by noble steeds? Verily no one knoweth whence they sprang: they, and they only, know each other's birth.\" Tr. Ralph T.H.

May their Sire Rudra, young and deft, and Pṛśni pouring much milk, bring fair days to the Maruts. Whether, O blessed Maruts, ye be dwelling in highest, midmost, or in lowest heaven,\r\n\r\nThence, O ye Rudras, and thou also, Agni, notice the sacrificial food we offer.\" Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith\r\n\r\nRig Veda 1.114.6 \"To him the Maruts' Father is this hymn addressed, to strengthen Rudra's might…\" Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith\r\n\r\nRig Veda 1.39.4 \"Consumers of your foes, no enemy of yours is found in heaven or on the earth: Ye Rudras, may the strength, held in this bond, be yours, to bid defiance even now.\" Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith\r\n\r\nMaruts being mentioned separately from Rudas as different entities\r\n\r\n\r\nRig Veda 8.13.28 \"Attendants on thy glory, let the Rudras roar assent to thee, And all the Marut companies come to the feast.\" Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith\r\n\r\nRig Veda 10.92.6 \"Straightway the Rudras, Maruts visiting all men, Falcons of Dyaus, home-dwellers with the Asura…\" Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith\r\n\r\nRig Veda 3.32.2 \"…Knit with the prayer-fulfilling band of Maruts, yea, with the Rudras, drink till thou art sated;\" Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \tHOW MANY RUDRAS ARE THERE?\r\n\r\n\r\nThousands and innumerable\r\n\r\n\r\nYajur Veda 16.54 \"Innumerable thousands are the Rudras on the face of earth…\" Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith\r\n\r\nHundred\r\n\r\n\r\nYajur Veda 21.43 \"…belonging to the Hundred Rudras…\" Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith\r\n\r\nEleven\r\n\r\n\r\nYajur Veda 34.47 \"Come, O Nâsatyas, with the thrice eleven Gods: come…\" Tr. Ralph T. H. Griffith\r\n\r\nBlack Yajur Veda 3.4.9.7 \"…the Rudras are eleven…\" Tr. Arthur Berriedale Keith\r\n\r\nThere is no clear mention of 11 Rudras in the Veda. However Yajur Veda verse quoted above seems to explain number of Rudras, Adityas and other group of deities. Later text like Taittriya Samhita (Black Yajur Veda) is clear on number of Rudras.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \tWHO WAS THE FIRST ONE TO DRINK SOMA?\r\n\r\n\r\nBrahman (Supreme God)\r\n\r\n\r\nAtharva Veda 4.6.1. The Brâhmana was the first to be born, with ten heads and ten mouths. He was the first to drink the soma; that did render poison powerless.\r\n\r\nVayu\r\n\r\n\r\nRig Veda 4.46.1 \"DRINK the best draught of Soma-juice, O Vāyu, at our holy rites: For thou art he who drinketh first.\" Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith\r\n\r\nRig Veda 1.134.1 Vayu, let fleet-foot coursers bring thee speedily to this our feast, to drink first of the juice we pour, to the first draught of Soma juice.\r\n\r\nRig Veda 2.11.14 …the Vayus, who drink the first libation of the Soma.\r\n\r\nRig Veda 1.135.4 … Vāyu, to taste the offerings! Drink of the pleasant-flavoured juice: the first draught is assigned to you.\r\n\r\nIndra\r\n\r\n\r\nAtharva Veda 20.99.1; Rig Veda 3.36.8 says that Indra was invited to drink Soma first. These two verses may be in a sense of Indra being invited at sacrifices to drink Soma first but contradiction can't be ignored. Some verses states that Vayu was the first drinker and some later texts like Aitareya Brahmana elaborating this story says that there was a race between gods on who should partake Soma first, Vayu won the competition and Indra came second. But this story is in contradiction with story of falcon Suparna bringing Soma to Indra. Rig Veda states that the falcon had brought the Soma, Krishna Yajur Veda is more clear in this case wherein it states that the gods didn't had Soma and Soma was brought by the falcon.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \tWHO WAS THE FIRST BORN?\r\n\r\n\r\nKama\r\n\r\n\r\nAtharva Veda 9.2.19 \"First before all sprang Kāma into being.

Griffith\r\n\r\nBrihaspati\r\n\r\n\r\nRig Veda 6.73.1 \"Served with oblations, first-born, mountain-render, Aṅgiras' son, Bṛhaspati, the Holy, With twice-firm path, dwelling in light, our Father, roars loudly, as a bull, to Earth and Heaven.\" Tr.

Griffith\r\n\r\nBrahma\r\n\r\n\r\nAtharva Veda 19.22.21 \"…Brahma was born first of all things existing…\" Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \tWHO KILLED SAMBARA?\r\n\r\n\r\nMaruts helped Indra kill Sambara\r\n\r\n\r\nRig Veda 3.47.4 \"Drink Soma, Indra, banded with the Maruts who, Maghavan, strengthened thee at Ahi's slaughter, 'Gainst Śambara, Lord of Bays! in winning cattle, and now rejoice in thee, the holy Singers.\" Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith\r\n\r\nBrahmanaspati\r\n\r\n\r\nRig Veda 2.24.2 \"He who with might bowed down the things that should be bowed, and in his fury rent the holds of Sambara: Who overthrew what shook not, Brahmapaspati,-he made his way within the mountain stored with wealth.\" Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith\r\n\r\nIndra\r\n\r\n\r\nRig Veda 1.54.4 \"The ridges of the lofty heaven thou madest shake; thou, daring, of thyself smotest through Śambara…\" Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \tWHO PREPARED PATH FOR THE SUN TO TRAVEL?\r\n\r\n\r\nVaruna\r\n\r\n\r\nRig Veda 1.24.8 \"King Varuṇa hath made a spacious pathway, a pathway for the Sun wherein to travel…\" Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith\r\n\r\nSeveral Varuna included\r\n\r\n\r\nRig Veda 7.60.3 Your coursers rich in store of sweets have mounted: to the bright ocean Sūrya hath ascended, For whom the Ādityas make his pathway ready, Aryaman, Mitra, Varuṇa, accordant.\r\n\r\nUsha (Dawn)\r\n\r\n\r\nRig Veda 1.113.16 \"Arise! the breath, the life, again hath reached us: darkness hath passed away and light approacheth. She for the Sun hath left a path to travel we have arrived where men prolong existence.\" Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith\r\n\r\nIndra\r\n\r\n\r\nRig Veda 10.111.3 \"Indra knows, verily, how to hear our singing, for he, victorious, made a path for Sūrya.\" Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \tWHAT WAS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN KUTSA AND INDRA?\r\n\r\n\r\nFriends\r\n\r\n\r\nRig Veda 4.16.10 \"Come to our home resolved to slay the Dasyu: Kutsa longed eagerly to win thy friendship. Alike in form ye both sate in his dwelling the faithful Lady was in doubt between you.\" Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith\r\n\r\nEnemies\r\n\r\nRig Veda 1.53.10 \"Thou hast protected Suśravas with succour, and Tūrvayāṇa with thine aid, O Indra. Thou madest Kutsa, Atithigva, Āyu, subject unto this King, the young, the mighty.\" Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith\r\n\r\nRig Veda 2.14.7 \"Ye ministers, to him who slew a hundred thousand, and cast them down upon earth's bosom; Who quelled the valiant men of Atithigva, Kutsa, and Āyu,—bring to him the Soma.\" Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith\r\n\r\nThere are also verses wherein Indra aided Kutsa in battle against Kutsa's enemies suggesting their friendly relationship. Later texts like Brahmanas gives different story that Kutsa was the son of Indra born from his thighs. Though Veda calls Kutsa as son of Arjuna (Rig Veda 8.1.11). If that is applied here then there will be another contradiction because Veda calls Indra and Kutsa as friends so there would be contradiction in their relationship.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \tWHO WAS THE FIRST SACRIFICER?\r\n\r\n\r\nManu\r\n\r\n\r\nRig Veda 10.63.7 \"Ye to whom Manu, by seven priests, with kindled fire, offered the first oblation with his heart and soul…\" Tr.

Griffith\r\n\r\nRig Veda 10.92.10 \"For these have spread abroad the fame of human kind, the Bull Bṛhaspati and Soma's brotherhood. Atharvan first by sacrifices made men sure: through skill the Bhṛgus were esteemed of all as Gods.\" Tr. Ralph T.H.

Griffith\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \tWHATS THE WEAPON OF RUDRA?\r\n\r\n\r\nBow and Arrows\r\n\r\nRig Veda 2.33.10 \"Worthy, thou carriest thy bow and arrows, worthy, thy many hued and honoured necklace. Worthy, thou cuttest here each fiend to pieces: a mightier than thou there is not, Rudra.\" Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith\r\n\r\nRig Veda 5.42.11 \"Praise him whose bow is strong and sure his arrow, him who is Lord of every balm that bealeth. Worship thou Rudra…\" Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith\r\n\r\nThunderbolt\/Lightning\r\n\r\n\r\nRig Veda 2.33.3 \"Chief of all born art thou in glory, Rudra, armed with the thunder, mightiest of the mighty…\" Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith\r\n\r\nAtharva Veda 11.2.26 \"O'erwhelm us not with Fever or with poison, nor, Rudra! with the fire that comes from heaven. Elsewhere, and not on us, cast down this lightning.\" Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith\r\n\r\nIn Rig Veda 7.6.3 Griffith has translated the word Didyut as bright arrow but the correct word is lightning which is rightly translated by many other translators.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \tHOW MANY HORSES DRAW CHARIOT OF THE SUN?\r\n\r\n\r\nNumerous\/Seven\r\n\r\n\r\nRig Veda 10.37.3 \"No godless man from time remotest draws thee down when thou art driving forth with winged dappled Steeds…\" Tr.
