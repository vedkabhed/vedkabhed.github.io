										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Written by Sulaiman Razvi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Qur’an states that Allah has created everything, the Bible states that God has created it, every religion whether Islam or Christianity takes a firm stand about the creator of the universe. But Vedas seems to be confused as to who created the universe. Vedas doesn’t answer who is the creator. There is no unanimous statement about who really created the universe among Hindus, some say Shiva created this entire universe, some say Vishnu or his avatars created it, some claim Brahma created it, All these stories are of Puranas and Upanishads, but we have to see only what the Vedas says about the creator because Vedas are the oldest scripture of Hinduism. Vedas also makes blunder about the process of creation. I won’t be explaining Vedic verses briefly, verses are pretty easy to understand. Readers themselves can draw conclusions after reading the verses. I am using Hindi translations of Swami Karpatri, Shri Ram Sharma and Shripad Damodar.</p>
<p><span id="more-1192"></span></p>
<p>Veda mentions different gods as the creator of the universe, Rig Veda 2.20.1; 2.13.5 says Indra created the earth, Rig Veda 10.82.1 and Yajur Veda 17.25 says Vishwakarma created the heaven and earth, Rig Veda 10.190.3 says Dhatar created the heaven, earth, sun and the moon. Atharva Veda 9.5.20 says that the breast of the God Aja became the earth, we read in Purusha Sukta that the feet of the lord became the earth, all these Vedic verses contradict each other. Atharva Veda 13.1.6 states that Rohita created the heaven and earth. A verse states that Prajapati created the universe, another verse in Yajur Veda 14.30 states that Prajapati prayed to a Divine Speech and thence earth and heaven were produced. Some also say the creation took place after the association of father and daughter mentioned in Rig Veda 10.61.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Who created living creatures?</strong></p>
<p>Vedas is confused about who created the humans or all creatures, It’s mentioned in Yajur Veda</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 14.28 With one they praised; creatures were produced…With five they praised; beings were created</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="465" height="154" class="wp-image-7269" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201.png" alt="https://truthabouthinduism.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/081514_0918_vediccontra1.png?w=625" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201.png 465w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/07/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201-300x99.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 465px) 100vw, 465px" /></p>
<p>According to scholars, Prajapati prayed to a divine speech and after that creatures were produced, So Prajapati is the creator of living beings here. Rig Veda says it were Vedic deities Indra and Varuna who created all living creatures,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rig Veda 7.82.5 O Indra-Varuna, as ye created all these creatures of the world by your surpassing might…</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="443" height="167" class="wp-image-7270" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201-1.png" alt="https://truthabouthinduism.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/081514_0918_vediccontra2.png?w=625" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201-1.png 443w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/07/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201-1-300x113.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 443px) 100vw, 443px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Atharva Vedas has another story, it says Vedic god Rohita created the creatures,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 13.1.52 Rohita made the earth to be his altar, heaven his Dakshina. Then heat he took for Agni, and with rain for molten butter he [Rohita] created every living thing [or universe].</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s analyse the Purusha Sukta. Purusha Sukta is often quoted to show the process of creation. Some Hindu scholars even say that scientists must read Purusha Sukta to know about the creation and cosmos, they say this Sukta is very unique. I can’t figure out what’s so unique about this Sukta. Later I found that its uniqueness lies in its riddles, It has so many contradictions. It’s about gods sacrificing Purusha and each of his body part becomes the creation. The word Purusha here may or may not denote Man. Purusha is literally translated as Man, but majority of scholars translates it (in this verse) as Supreme Soul (God), according to Mahidhara and Sayana it is Spirit or Man, other scholars translates it as Almighty God and Universe. If Purusha is the Almighty god then how come the Almighty God (Purusha) himself was born? Veda says,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.90.5 From him Viraj was born; again Purusa from Viraj was born…</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-7271" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201-2.png" alt="https://truthabouthinduism.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/081514_0918_vediccontra3.png?w=625" width="570" height="139" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201-2.png 418w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/07/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201-2-300x73.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 570px) 100vw, 570px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The word Viraj or Virat here is translated by some as universe. But scholars have different opinion on this word. Majority of scholars including Sayana and Mahidhara say it’s an egg. Some say it’s the egg from which the universe or Men were born, some also say it’s known as Adi Purusa. The word Viraj occurs in Atharva Veda 11.4.12 as Prana (Vital Spirit), in Atharva Veda 9.2.5 Viraj is translated as milch cow, and by Arya Samaj scholars as Splendid Speech [Goddess]. Some interpret Rig Veda 10.90.5 as, The almighty God created Viraj, and Viraj then created the Men (Purusha) or living creatures, they translate the latter word Purusha literally as Men. This is wrong since the creation of men and other living beings occurs in verses 8, 10 and 12. There is also a reference (Manu 3.195) which shows that Viraj had sons. Maharishi Manu also makes blunder about the creation which contradicts Vedas also, but on this Viraj issue he tries to make it simple saying that it was Brahma who produced Viraj, He writes</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 1.31-32 But for the sake of the prosperity of the worlds he caused the Brahmana, the Kshatriya, the Vaisya, and the Sudra to proceed from his mouth, his arms, his thighs, and his feet. Dividing his own body, the Lord became half male and half female; with that (female) he produced Virag.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So this affirms the statement of some scholars who say that Purusha is the unborn Almighty God and from him Viraj was born. But it makes the situation more complex because Vedas states in the beginning only Viraj was present and from him Purusha was born,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 19.6.9 In the beginning rose Viraj: Purusha from Viraj was born. As soon as he was born he spread westward and eastward o’er the earth.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="574" height="62" class="wp-image-7272" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201-3.png" alt="https://truthabouthinduism.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/081514_0918_vediccontra4.png?w=625" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201-3.png 574w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/07/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201-3-300x32.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 574px) 100vw, 574px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now this is senseless and as complicated as the saying ”What came first the chicken or the egg?” This is a clear contradiction, because Purusha is unborn they say and from Purusha, Viraj was born. But this verse states the In the beginning rose (Sambhavat) Viraj and from him Purusha was born. To strengthen my argument I would like to quote next two verses of Atharva Veda 19.6.9 which would also clear the mist,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 19.6.10-11 When Gods performed the sacrifice with Purusha as their offering. Spring was the butter, summer was the fuel, autumn was the gift. That sacrifice, first-born Purusha, they hallowed with the sprinkled Rains. The Deities, the Sadhyas, all the Vasus sacrificed with him.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="602" height="141" class="wp-image-7273" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201-4.png" alt="https://truthabouthinduism.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/081514_0918_vediccontra5.png?w=625" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201-4.png 602w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/07/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201-4-300x70.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So this shows that the sacrificed Purusha was born from Viraj. Purusha was the first to take birth from Viraj. So how is it possible that the Almighty God (Purusha) himself was born from an egg (Viraj)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Who was Sacrificed?</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.90.6 When Gods prepared the sacrifice with Purusa as their offering, Its oil was spring, the holy gift was autumn; summer was the wood.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="601" height="109" class="wp-image-7274" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201-5.png" alt="https://truthabouthinduism.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/081514_0918_vediccontra6.png?w=625" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201-5.png 601w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/07/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201-5-300x54.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 601px) 100vw, 601px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is mentioned in Krishna Yajur Veda,</p>
<p>Krishna Yajur Veda 6.3.5 The Sadhya gods were in this world and nothing else living. They offered Agni as a sacrifice to Agni [Fire], for they found nothing else to offer; thence indeed these creatures were born; in that he casts the fire on the fire after producing it, (it serves for) the propagation of offspring.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How the creation of universe (or of earth) took place?</strong></p>
<p>While Purusha Sukta is often quoted, The Rig Veda 10.72 hymn is often ignored by the scholars. Both have similarity and difference. The similarity is that both these Suktas talk about how the creation took place and the difference is that both these Suktas give a complete different picture about creation of universe. According to Purusha Sukta the earth was gendered from the Almighty god’s feet (Rigved 10.90.14), while the 72<sup>nd</sup> hymn states that the earth was born from a tree,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.72.1-4 Let us proclaim with a clear voice the generations of the gods (the divine company), who, when their praises are recited, look (favourably on the worshipper) in this latter age. Brahmanaspati filled these (generations of the gods) with breath as a blacksmith (his bellows) in the first age of the gods the existent was born of the non-existent. In the first age of the gods the existent was born of the non-existent; after that the quarters (of the horizon) were born, and after them the upward-growing (trees). The earth was born from the upward-growing (tree), the quarters were born from the earth; Daksha was born from Aditi, and afterwards Aditi from Daksha. – Tr. Wilson</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="467" height="277" class="wp-image-7275" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201-6.png" alt="https://truthabouthinduism.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/081514_0918_vediccontra7.png?w=625" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201-6.png 467w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/07/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201-6-300x178.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 467px) 100vw, 467px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Founder of Arya Samaj Swami Dayanand Saraswati argued against the creation of universe out of nothing. He criticized the Qur’an’s concept of creation out of nothing which is similar to this 72<sup>nd</sup> hymn of Rigved Mandal 10. Hindu scholars gave more importance to the Purusha Sukta and rejected the 72<sup>nd</sup> Sukta. Both these Suktas of the same Rig Veda are contradictory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>So who really created the universe?</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.90.6 When <strong>Gods</strong> prepared the sacrifice with Purusa as their offering, Its oil was spring, the holy gift was autumn; summer was the wood.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="494" height="90" class="wp-image-7276" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201-7.png" alt="https://truthabouthinduism.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/081514_0918_vediccontra8.png?w=625" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201-7.png 494w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/07/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201-7-300x55.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 494px) 100vw, 494px" /></p>
<p>Vedas doesn’t give the list of gods who sacrificed Purusha. But it’s mentioned in Atharva Veda 13.1.55 that Rohita brought the world which rose from the sacrifice (of Purusha). It either means that Rohita alone sacrificed Purusha or Rohita was among the gods or Rishis who sacrificed Purusha. Rohita is considered a sage in that verse. It’s mentioned in Rigved,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.129.6-7 Who verily knows and who can here declare it, whence it was born and whence comes this creation? The Gods are later than this world’s production. Who knows then whence it first came into being? He, the first origin of this creation, whether he formed it all or did not form it, Whose eye controls this world in highest heaven, <strong>he verily knows it, or perhaps he knows not</strong>.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="448" height="351" class="wp-image-7277" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201-8.png" alt="https://truthabouthinduism.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/081514_0918_vediccontra9.png?w=625" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201-8.png 448w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/07/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201-8-300x235.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 448px) 100vw, 448px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Swami Vivekananda’s English translation,</p>
<p>”[6] Who knew the way? Who there declared Whence this arose? Projection whence? <strong>For after this projection came the gods</strong>. Who therefore knew indeed, came out this whence?</p>
[7] This projection whence arose, Whether held or whether not, He the ruler in the supreme sky, of this He, O Sharman! knows, or know not He perchance”- Rig Veda 10.129.6-7, Tr. Swami Vivekananda. [Source: <a href="http://www.swamivivekananda.org.in/main/e-library/hymns/the-hymn-on-creation/" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">http://www.swamivivekananda.org.in/main/e-library/hymns/the-hymn-on-creation/<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> ]
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When Gods are later than this world’s production then who sacrificed Purusha? As we read in Purusha Sukta that it were the Gods who sacrificed Purusha. According to Vedas It was only after the sacrifice of Purusha that entire universe including this world came into existence. Manu also alludes that the Rishis were born after the creation of universe (Manu 1.34-35). So how is it possible that this creation took place without the gods? And who really sacrificed Purusha then?</p>
<p>When the Vedas which was believed by every Hindu god as highest authoritative text doesn’t have the answer about who really created the universe, then why do you believe it to be the word of god? Some may try to twist and turn these verses to hide the fallacies of Vedas, but truth will remain truth. They may deceive themselves but intellectuals will definitely find the truth. It is clear that the composer or God of Vedas is not the creator. Vedas juggles about the creator, but it’s not difficult to find the real creator of this world.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By Sulaiman Razvi</p>
<p>Hindu god allows lying on five occasions especially while enjoying a woman, Krishna said,<br />
Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Krishna Janma Khanda 98.38-44 &#8221;&#8230;Hari began to laugh and thus addressed Uddhava, using words of good import and worlds sanctioned by the Vedas, &#8221;O Uddhava, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;">untruth spoken to women or on the sporting ground</span></span>, or in an emergency which endangers life or for the good of the vows or the Brahmin is not contemptible&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Rajendra Nath Sen<br />
<span id="more-1973"></span><br />
Matysa Purana 31.16 &#8221;Sarmistha said:- &#8221;King! <span style="color: #ff0000;">there is no sin in speaking untruth at the time of indulging in sexual pleasure</span>s, on the occasion of marriage, when life is in danger, wealth is at stake, and in joke. Lying on these five occasions is venal.&#8221; Tr. Various Sanskrit Scholars, Edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>Mahabharata 8.69 &#8221;In a situation of peril to life and in marriage, falsehood becomes utterable. In a situation involving the loss of one&#8217;s entire property, falsehood becomes utterable. On an occasion of marriage, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;">or of enjoying a woman</span></span>, or when life is in danger, or when one&#8217;s entire property is about to be taken away, or for the sake of a Brahmana, falsehood may be uttered. These five kinds of falsehood have been declared to be sinless. On these occasions falsehood would become truth and truth would become falsehood.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mahabharata 1.82 &#8220;Sarmishtha then said, &#8216;It hath been said, O king, that it is not sinful to lie on the occasion of a joke, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;">in respect of women sought to be enjoyed</span></span>, on occasions of marriage, in peril of immediate death and of the loss of one&#8217;s whole fortune. Lying is excusable on these five occasions.&#8221; Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Vasishtha Samhita 16.35 (Men) may speak an untruth at the time of marriage, during dalliance, when their lives are in danger or the loss of their whole property is imminent, and for the sake of a Brâhmana; they declare that an untruth spoken in these five cases does not make (the speaker) an outcast.</p>
<p>Gautama Samhita 23.29 Some (declare, that) an untruth (spoken) at the time of marriage, during dalliance, in jest or while (one suffers severe) pain is venial.</p>
<p>So Krishna allows lying for personal benefits. No wonder why so many Hindu fanatics use lie and deceit to mock others. Many Hindus are unaware of these verses and they mock others by using their own invented lies. A verse in Rigved states that Vedic God Indra slew Sushna by Maya (deception),</p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.11.7 &#8220;Thou slewest, Indra, by stratagems, the wily Sushna: the wise have known of this thy (greatness)&#8230;&#8221; Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Swami Dayanand Saraswati the founder of Arya Samaj wrote in his commentary on this verse,</p>
<p>&#8220;God commands that highly intelligent persons should overthrow enemies by using all legitimate means consisting of persuasion (Saam), bribery (Daam), Dand (punishment) and Bhed (polarization, divide and rule, blackmail)&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>This was also Chankya Niti, Chanakya wrote,</p>
<p>Arthashastra of Kautilya Chapter 10 &#8220;&#8230;Negotiation, bribery, causing dissension, and open attack are forms of stratagem (upaya)&#8230;Offering money is bribery (upapradana). Causing fears and suspicion as well as threatening is known as sowing dissesion. Killing, harassing, and plundering is attack (danda)&#8230;&#8221; Tr. R. Shamasastry</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Swami Dayanand Saraswati also advocates lying to propagate ones faith he writes,</p>
<p>“Now it must be understood that if it was the belief of Shankar that God and the human soul were identical and that the world was an illusion, it was not good; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">but if he had avowed this doctrine simply in order to refute Jainism more successfully, it was a little good</span><strong>.</strong>” Satyarth Prakash, by Swami Dayanand Saraswati, Chapter 11, Tr. Chiranjiva Bhardwaja</p>
<p>He means if one lies just to demean others faith in order to propagate the Vedic faith then it is a good thing. Swami Prabhupada the founder of ISKCON had similar views,<br />
‘’According to Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;">Ś</span><span style="color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;">rīpāda Śaṅkarācārya preached the Māyāvāda philosophy for a particular purpose. Such a philosophy was necessary to defeat the Buddhist philosophy</span></span> of the nonexistence of the spirit soul, but it was never meant for perpetual acceptance. It was an emergency. Thus Lord Kṛṣṇa was accepted by Śaṅkarācārya as the Supreme Personality of Godhead in his commentation on Bhagavad-gītā.’’ By A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, Srimad Bhagavatam 3.4.20 <a href="http://www.vedabase.com/en/sb/3/4/20" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">http://www.vedabase.com/en/sb/3/4/20<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>Swami Prabhupada also wrote,<br />
&#8220;In this regard, it is stated in the Padma Purana that Lord Siva appeared as a brahmana in the age of Kali to preach the Mayavada philosophy, which is nothing but a type of Buddhist philosophy. It is stated in Padma Purana: Lord Siva, speaking to Parvati-devi, foretold that he would spread the Mayavada philosophy in the guise of a sannyasi brahmana just to eradicate Buddhist philosophy. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;">This sannyasi was Sripada Sankaracarya. In order to overcome the effects of Buddhist philosophy and spread Vedanta philosophy, Sripada Sankaracarya had to make some compromise with the Buddhist philosophy, and as such he preached the philosophy of monism, for it was required at that time</span></span>. Otherwise there was no need for his preaching Mayavada philosophy. At the present moment there is no need for Mayavada philosophy or Buddhist philosophy, and Lord Caitanya rejected both of them. This Krishna consciousness movement is spreading the philosophy of Lord Caitanya and rejecting the philosophy of both classes of Mayavadi. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;">Strictly speaking, both Buddhist philosophy and Sankara&#8217;s philosophy are but different types of Mayavada dealing on the platform of material existence. Neither of these philosophies has spiritual significance</span></span>. There is spiritual significance only after one accepts the philosophy of Bhagavad-gita, which culminates in surrendering unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Generally people worship Lord Siva for some material benefit, and although they cannot see him personally, they derive great material profit by worshiping him.&#8221; <strong>Swami Prabhupada on Srimad Bhagavatam 4.24.17 </strong><a href="http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_4.24.17" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_4.24.17<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>So both Swami Prabhupada and Dayanand says that it&#8217;s OK to lie and deceive to propagate ones faith. Also read <a href="/index.php/2015/06/25/hindu-god-is-a-cheat/" data-wpel-link="internal">Hindu god is a cheater</a>.</p>

<p>Pedophilia in Hinduism (<strong>Updated</strong>)</p>
<p>Written by Sulaiman Razvi</p>
<p>Hinduism considers it a sin if the girl is not married before her puberty, it even says that forefathers of the girl shall drink blood of her monthly courses if she isn’t married before puberty. Hinduism also says that marriage of a girl before puberty sanctifies 21 generations. Marriage of a Brahmin man with a Shudra girl is censured and Brahmin man marrying a Shudra is considered Vrisalapati and it is considered on par with marrying a girl whose menses has started, a man marrying a girl whose menstruation has started is also considered Vrisalapati. A girl who lives in her father’s house even after her menses begins to appear is considered a degraded girl. Smritis and Puranas says that a 30 years old man shall marry a girl of 12. Swami Prabhupada <a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/conversations/1977/feb/mayapura/february/27/1977-1?d=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">said<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, “Even an eighty-years-old man can marry a sixteen-years-old girl.” This is how Hinduism encourages paedophilia. There is also evidence from Puranas to show that it was practised at the time it was composed. Child marriage and paedophilia was more prevalent in India before the Hindu law were codified. Despite making it illegal, child marriage is still practised,</p>

<p>Sexual assault on children is on the rise in India, According to the National Crime Records Bureau a total of 12,363 cases of child rape were reported in the country during 2013 as compared to 8,541 in 2012 accounting for an increase of 44.7%. The maximum child rape cases were reported in Madhya Pradesh (2,112 cases) followed by Maharashtra (1,546 cases) and Uttar Pradesh (1,381 cases). These three states together accounted for 40.8% of the total child rape cases reported in the country.<br />
<a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Online-database-to-name-and-shame-pedophiles/articleshow/46869620.cms" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Online-database-to-name-and-shame-pedophiles/articleshow/46869620.cms<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>But as usual Hindus won’t admit evils which exists in their society or religion and rather puts the blame on Muslims. Hindus says that child marriage were introduced in India by the Muslim invaders. But this claim is refuted by their own scholar Swami Vivekananda who acknowledged that Hinduism permits paedophilia,</p>
<p>“…A girl of eight is married to a man of thirty, and the parents are jubilant over it…. And if anyone protests against it, the plea is put forward, “Our religion is being overturned.” What sort of religion have they who want to see their girls becoming mothers before they attain puberty even and offer scientific explanations for it? Many, again, lay the blame at the door of the Mohammedans. They are to blame, indeed! Just read the Grihya-Sutras through and see what is given as the marriageable age of a girl. … There it is expressly stated that a girl must be married before attaining puberty. The entire Grihya-Sutras enjoin this…” The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda, Volume 6/Epistles – Second Series/LXXI Rakhal [ <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Complete_Works_of_Swami_Vivekananda/Volume_6/Epistles_-_Second_Series/LXXI_Rakhal" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Complete_Works_of_Swami_Vivekananda/Volume_6/Epistles_-_Second_Series/LXXI_Rakhal<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> ]
<p>So now Hindus can’t deny that paedophilia is sanctioned by Hinduism and started because of Hinduism. Swami Prabhupada the founder of ISKCON wrote,</p>
<p>Swami Prabhupada writes,</p>
<p>”…As soon as a woman attains the age of puberty, she immediately becomes very much agitated by sexual desire. It is therefore the duty of the father to get his daughter married before she attains puberty…” A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada on Srimad Bhagavatam 4.25.42 [ <a href="http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_4.25.42" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_4.25.42<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> ]
<p>Another Hindu scholar Sadhguru hints at child marriage,</p>
<p>“It’s a tragic situation. We should realise that we are a society in transition. There was a time when girls would be married at 15. Now they are not married till 25 and 30. So this is the peak of their hormones. In our mindset we are in the past, but in our physical situation, we are in the present. What is causing these rapes? Humans have their needs. If you keep them suppressed, they will do something violent. We need to address this on a much larger scale – hanging rapists or putting them behind bars, that is not the solution. Yes, it needs to be done when it happens. But more importantly as a society, we need to understand why.” <a href="http://www.newindianexpress.com/education/edex/Seven-minutes-with-the-Sadhguru/2016/06/13/article3475994.ece" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">http://www.newindianexpress.com/education/edex/Seven-minutes-with-the-Sadhguru/2016/06/13/article3475994.ece <span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>Brahma Purana states that a girl should be given in marriage when she is only four years old,</p>
<p>Brahma Purana: Gautami Mahatmya 95.7 ”After the fourth year and before the completion of the tenth year the marriage of his daughter must be performed scrupulously by the father.” Tr. Board of Scholars, Edited by J.L. Shastri</p>

<h2><strong>Rama married six years old Sita</strong></h2>
<p>As per Valmiki Ramayana, Rama is said to have married Sita when she was 6 years old,</p>
<p>Valmiki Ramayana, Aranya Kanda 3, Sarga 47, Verses 3-5 “I am the daughter of noble-souled Janaka, the king of Mithila, by name I am Seetha, and the dear wife and queen of Rama, let safety betide you. On residing in the residence of Ikshvaku-s in Ayodhya for twelve years, I was in sumptuosity of all cherishes while relishing all humanly prosperities. In the thirteenth year the lordly king Dasharatha deliberated together with his imperial ministers to anoint Rama as Crown Prince of Ayodhya. When Raghava’s anointment was being organised my venerable mother-in-law known as Kaikeyi begged her husband Dasharatha for a boon. Restraining my veracious father-in-law by a good deed once done by her in his respect, Kaikeyi besought two boons from him, namely expatriation of my husband, and anointment of her son Bharata. ‘If Rama is anointed now, come what may I will not eat, sleep, or drink, and my life ends this way,’ thus Kaikeyi was adamantine, and the king and my father-in-law entreated her who is nagging with meaningful riches, but she did not make good on that entreaty. My great-resplendent husband was of twenty-five years of age at that time, and to me eighteen years are reckoned up from my birth.” Tr. Sri Desiraju Hanumantha Rao</p>
<p>If we do little maths here we understand that Sita was 18 years old when she went into exile with her husband and before the exile she had spent 12 years with her husband in the house of King Dashratha, so if we deduct the age of Sita at the time of exile (18 years of age) and number years she spent in the house of King Dasharath (i.e., 12 years) we get,<br />
18-12= 6 years old<br />
Sita after marrying at 6, lived in the palace of King Dashrath for 12 years. When she was sent to exile with her husband, she was 18 years old. The age difference between Rama and Sita was 7 years. Skanda Purana clearly states that Sita was married when she was only six years old,</p>
<p>Skanda Purana Book, III, Section 2, Chapter 30, Verses 8-9 “The bow of Isvara that was kept in the abode of Janaka, was broken. In his fifteenth year, O king, Rama married the six year old beautiful daughter of the king of Mithila, Sita who was not born of a womb. On getting Sita, Raghava became contented and happy.” Tr. Ganesh Vasudeo Tagare</p>
<p>Hindu scholars Ramswaroop Acharya Maharaj and Pandit Mahendra Pal Arya says Sita was married to Ram when she was 6 years old.</p>

<h2><strong>Krishna married eight years old Rukmini and many prepubescent girls</strong></h2>
<p>As per Puranas, Krishna is said to have married prepubescent Rukmini when she was only eight years old. Although Hindu text doesn’t mention the age of Krishna at the time of his marriage with Rukmini but the way Hindu text describes him shows that he was an adult at the time of his marriage with prepubescent Rukmini. And other Puranas also shows his sexual intercourse after marriage which is enough to prove that he was a fully grown man.</p>
<p>As per Skanda Purana when Rukmini was born an ethereal voice told her father Bhishmaka that she should be given in marriage to four-armed one born on earth. When Rukmini reached the age of eight her father became worried about her marriage and about the ethereal voice that commanded him to give his daughter in marriage to four-armed one. Then in the meantime Damaghosa visited him and told him that his son Shishupala is considered four-armed one, then the marriage was fixed but Krishna carried away Rukmini and Rukmini had also fell in love with Krishna on first sight, But while Krishna was carrying Rukmini in chariot, Rukmini’s brother Rukmi stopped Krishna and they both fought each other resulting in Rukmi’s defeat. Krishna was about to kill Rukmi but Rukmini begged to forgive her brother and Krishna forgave him, Krishna tonsured Rukmi as per Bhagvad Purana. Then Krishna called all Brahmins born to sages and marriage ceremony took place. This is the summary of the Skanda Purana story, it’s little bit different than the story mentioned in Srimad Bhagavatam where Swayamvar was arranged and it was attended by many kings, But Srimad Bhagavatm doesn’t mention the age of either Rukmini or Krishna but it does say that Rukmini had not attained puberty at the time of her marriage with Krishna. It’s mentioned in Skanda Purana,</p>
<p>Skanda Purana Book V, Section iii, Chapter 142, Verses 8-79 “…The second child born was a daughter named Rukmini. At that time an unembodied ethereal voice told him, ‘O Bhismaka, this girl should be given to a Four-armed One (born) on this earth.’… As time passed on she became a girl of eight years. The king recollected the words of the embodied being and became worried. ‘To whom shall I give this daughter? Who will be the four-armed one?’… In the meantime Damaghosa, the chieftain of Cedi came there from the excellent mountain Raivata. He entered the royal palace where King Bhismaka was present. On seeing him arrived in the abode, the king duly adored him. He was taken to the Royal Court and given a proper seat. ‘This day has dawned meritoriously. I was eager to see you. O great king, my daughter has come to the age of eight years. The ethereal voice of an unembodied being has told that she should be given to a Four-armed one.’ On hearing the words of Bhismaka, Damaghosa said thus: ‘My son is well known in all the three worlds as Four-armed One (Caturbhuja). O Bhismaka, let this girl be given to Sisupala.’ On hearing the words of Damaghosa, O king, Rumini was betrothed to Sisupala by Bhismaka. The auspicious ceremonial beginning was made by Bhismaka, O Yudhisthira. All the kinsmen and members of the family who were staying far-off countries in every direction, were invited and they duly arrived…At the time of dusk, Rukmini, the bride of seductive charms, went out of the city accomplished by her female companions for the worship of Ambika. There she saw Hari, the Lord of Devas, in the guise of a cowherd. On seeing him, she was excited by the god of Love and became completely fascinated. On seeing her, Kesava said to Sankarsana, ‘On dear brother in my view the excellent jewel of a girl should be taken away.’ On hearing the words of Kesava, Sankarsana said: ‘Go ahead, O Krsna, O mighty one. Let the jewel of a girl be seized quickly. I shall follow you closely behind causing much havoc unto all these demons. On getting the consent of Sankarsana, Kesava, the slayer of Kesin, seized the girl, immediately put her on the chariot and went off…Rukma said: O Lord Kesava, unlucky and sinful that I am, I had hit your chest with arrows. It behoves you to forgive me. Formerly Janaki was given over to you by Janaka himself. Now, O lord of Devas, Rukmini is offered unto you by me. Marry her duly in accordance with the injunctions…When Rukma went back Krsna invited excellent Brahmanas. They were the seven mental sons of Brahma…In this manner the Slayer of Madhu honoured them duly and perfectly and then grasped the hand of Rukmini in marriage.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>So this proves that Krishna married Rukmini when she was only eight years old. Srimad Bhagavatam the most authentic Purana of Krishna devotees explicitly states that she had not attained puberty,<br />
Srimad Bhagavatam Canto 10, Chapter 53, Verse 51 “Beholding that charming princess Rukmini gifted with a beautiful waist, a countenance adorned with Kundalas, not attaining the age of puberty, with a golden mekhala beautifying her waist, with rising signs of womanhood, with moving eyes as if in fear…” Tr. J.M. Sanyal</p>
<p>Another translation,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 10.53.51 “Smitten with love kindled (in their breast) by her, the illustrious warriors assembled (there) felt bewildered to behold the princess, who was possessed of a shapely (slender) waist and had not yet attained puberty, and who had a girdle of jewels thrown about her hips and in whom signs of womanhood were (just) manifesting themselves…” Tr. Gita press Publications</p>
<p>A Hindu scholar named Swami Venkatesananda wrote,</p>
<p>“After the wordhip Rukmini took part of the offerings she had made to the goddess, as a token of the goddess’s blessings. She then left the temple and was talking towards the waiting chariot. Rukmini, who was of exquisite beauty though she had not yet attained puberty, looked for Krsna among the assembled princes. These princes, who had been robbed of their senses by her great charm, had for the moment been paralysed, and stood gaping. As she was about to mount her chariot, Krsna sprang forward, grasped her hand and helped her to his own vehicle, while the princes still stood looking on helplessly. However, as Krsna’s vehicle moved towards Dvaraka, the princes, headed by Jarasandha, began to say to one another: ‘What a disgrace: while we great warriors were watching, the cowherds snatched away a princess!” <strong>The Concise Srimad Bhagavatam, By Swami Venkatesananda, page 292, Publisher SUNY Press, 1989</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other Puranic verses shows that she was engaged in child like sports,</p>
<p>Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Krishna Janma Khanda 105.1-10 “…The monarch Bhismaka observed his beautiful daughter engaged in child-like sports and increasing in splendour day by day like a digit of the moon in the midst of clouds. Considering it advisable to marry his youthful and lovely daughter…” Rajendra Nath Sen</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So all these references proves that Rukmini was a prepubescent girl of eight years old. If anyone wants to refute this claim of mine then they should furnish reference clearly showing the age of Rukmini, other tricks of twisting facts will not be accepted.</p>
<p>Another thing is that, Krishna is said to have married 16100 princesses after liberating them from a demon named Narakasur. Hindu scriptures says that Krishna died in old age.</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 5.37.15-20 states that Krishna lived over a hundred years, some Hindu scholars says that he lived up to 120 or 125. Now please read it carefully, Devi Bhagavatam 2.28.1-23; Padma Purana 1.23.91-121 and Padma Purana 1.23.74b-87a states that Krishna’s 16100 wives were abducted by bandits or fishermen and they were made prostitutes after the death of Krishna, refer my article <a href="/index.php/2018/06/20/how-krishna-died-and-what-happened-to-his-wives/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link="internal">How Krishna Died &amp; What Happened To His Wives?</a></p>
<p>Now the question is, why would anyone abduct old women for carnal purpose? There must have been many really young and beautiful girls in the city Dvaraka so why they were not abducted and instead Krishna’s wives were abducted? Obviously only young women would be abducted by perverts so Krishna’s 16100 must have been quite young when they were abducted or let’s assume that they were 30 years old when 100+ years old Krishna died. So let’s assume that Krishna had married them some 10 or 20 years before his death then that means those girls were 10 or 20 years old or perhaps less than 10 when 90+ year old Krishna married them, now such coincidence is impossible that all of 16100 princesses were of the same age there must have been a huge age gap between those princesses, some may have been under 10 when Krishna in his old age married them. So does that mean Krishna in old age married extremely youthful girls?</p>

<h2><strong>Shiva’s marriage with Parvati</strong></h2>
<p>Unlike the case of Ram and Krishna where age of brides is clearly mentioned, the case of Shiva’s is little complicated. Hindu texts does say that gods and sages fixed the marriage of Parvati with Shiva when Parvati was only eight years old. But doesn’t state her age at the time of her marriage. As per Puranas, When Sati the first wife of Shiva immolated herself, Shiva promised that he would not wed any other lady. But Sati reincarnated on earth as Parvati the daughter of king Himavat. The story has different versions in Skanda Purana, Shiva Purana and Vamana Purana. I shall mention them all. Stories in Shiva and Skanda Puranas are quite same. First I shall discuss the story mentioned in Shiva and Skanda Purana, I will try to make it as short as possible. Himavat along with Parvati went to Shiva and paid obeisance, while Shiva was meditating. Himavat asked Shiva that his daughter along with maids would serve him but Shiva refused. Sages had told Himavat that Parvati’s husband would be Shiva so Parvati started performing penance to gain Shiva as her husband. The duration of her penance is not mentioned, it could last for few months, a year or say for four years. But that doesn’t make any difference to a eight years old girl. Following verses are about when Parvati had not yet started her penance,</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Rudra Samhita, ParvatiKhanda, section III.8.51- “On hearing the story from Narada, Parvati bent down her head in bashfulness but her smile heightened the beauty of her face. On hearing the story, the lord of mountains stroked her fondly, kissed her on the head and placed her on his seat.” Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Placing a girl on seat is possible only if she is a child although previous verses clearly says that she was eight years old, it’s not possible to place on seat a full grown girl. Verses of Skanda and Shiva Purana shows that Parvati was only eight before she went to Shiva abode and later started performing her penance,</p>
<p>Skanda Purana I.i.20.1 “Lomasa said: The chaste girl grew up day by day and shone very much. Living in the house of Himalaya, she reached the age of eight years.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Rudrasamhita, Parvatikhanda, section III.11.1-2 “Brahma said:- O Narada, the daughter of the mountain, honoured in the three worlds, was brought up in the palace of Himacala. When she was eight years old, Siva distressed by Sati’s separation came to know of her birth. Keeping her wonderful memory within his heart He rejoiced much.” Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Rudrasamhita, Parvatikhanda, section III.8.4-13 “Himavat said:- O sage Narada…Please read the horoscope of my daughter and tell me about her good and bad fortune. Whose beloved wife will my fortunate daughter be? Narada said: ‘O Mena, O king of mountains, this daughter of yours has all auspicious signs…There is an abnormal line also. Listen to the indication thereof. Her husband will be a naked Yogin, without any qualities. He will be free from lust. He will have neither mother nor father. He will be indifferent to honours. His dress and manners will be inauspicious…O sage, on hearing your words, and inferring that indications reffered to Siva, Parvati’s joy knew no bounds.” Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>When Shiva was pleased with Parvati’s penance he sent seven sages to Himavat to ask Parvati’s hand in marriage,</p>
<p>Skanda Purana I.i.23.3-9 “Why have all of you come? Tell me the reason for your visit. Then the Seven Sages said: ‘We have been sent by Mahesa. We have come to you in order to see the girl. O Mountain, understand us. Show us your daughter immediately.’ Saying ‘So be it’ to the group of Sages, Parvati was brought there. Himavan, the lord of Mountains, who loved his children, placed Parvati in his lap and said laughingly. ‘This is my daughter indeed. But listen to my words again. Siva is the most excellent one among ascetics. The destroyer of Madana is devoid of attachment. How does he by whom Smara (Madana) has been made Ananga (bodiless), seek a marriage alliance? Offering the daughter in marriage to the following persons is not recommended: one who is very near (i.e. closely related), one who is very far off, one who is extremely rich one, one who is devoid of wealth, one who is unemployed and a foolish fellow. One shall not offer one’s daughter in marriage to a stupid person, to a person who is devoid of attachment, to a self-esteeming person, to a sick man and to a madcap. Hence, O excellent…” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p><strong>Ganesh Vasudeo Tagare writes on verse 5:</strong> “Evidence of child-marriage at the time of our text. Parvati who performed penance for a long time, must have been too old to sit in the lap of her father.”</p>
<p>This is a very important point. Parvati along with her father went to Shiva’s abode when she was eight years old, the duration of her penance is not mentioned so let’s assume that she performed penance for a year or let’s say for four years. Considering that her father placed her in his lap even after the penance so she must be very young girl at the time. Another point is that, When Narada and gods approached him and told him that his daughter would marry Shiva he was somehow convinced to give his eight years old daughter to Shiva without thinking about the age difference.</p>
<p>Now let’s have a look at Vamana Purana version about the marriage of Shiva and Parvati.</p>
<p>Vamana Purana 25.1 “Pulastya said Three daughters endowed with beauty and merit were born to Mena and a son named Sunabha was born as the fourth. [5-7] O sage, six years after their birth, the three daughters born to her, went out to perform penance, Gods saw those handsome girls. The austere Kutila who was as beautiful as the rays of the Moon was then taken to the heaven of Brahman by the Adityas and the Vasus. Then the gods said, ‘O Brahman, please tell us whether she will give birth to a son who will slay Mahisa.” Tr. Anand Swarup Gupta</p>
<p>Vamana Purana 25.8-27 “The great god Brahman said, ‘This austere girl is not capable of holding the semen of Sankara. Leave this poor girl.’ But then O Narada, the enraged Kutila said to Brahmana, ‘O Lord, I shall so endeavour that I hold the semen of Sankara which is very difficult to be born…She too who was called Ragavati, was brought to heaven by the gods. Offering her to Brahman, Prajapati spoke to her in the same manner. Losing her temper, she too said, ‘Truly I shall undergo penance in such a manner that the slayer of Mahisa will become associated with my name. ‘Then the austere Mena knowing, as she did, that the two daughters had already left her, prevented her third daughter from taking to penance. And she exclaimed ‘Uma (O do not practice penance).’ Her mother the brillaint daughter of the Pitrs gave her daughter the name Uma. She then went to the forest…Then Brahman said, ‘She is undoubtedly the consort of Sankara, by whose lustre indeed you have been distracted and have become lustreless…” Tr. Anand Swarup Gupta</p>
<p>So the gods tried to marry 6 years old girl to Shiva. Swami Parmeshwaranand explains it as,</p>
<p>“Three daughters named Kutila, Ragini and Parvati and a son named Sunabha were born to Himavan by his wife Mena. The three daughters went to the Himalayas for penance, to get Siva as husband. They were not even six years old then. The Devas saw them. The Adityas and the Vasus took Kutila who was doing penance, to the world of the gods. All the gods gathered together and asked Brahma. “Oh Lord, be pleased to tell us if this girl will be able to hear a son who could kill Mahisasura”. Brahma replied. “This poor girl will not be capable of bearing the radiance of Siva. So let her go away.” Kutila got angry at Brahma and said “Lord, I will try to become fit to bear the unbearable radiance of Siva. Harken, I will do penance properly and please Visnu and make Siva bow his head. I take a vow to that effect.” Brahma became angry and told Kutila, “You, wicked Kutila, you did not succumb to my words. So by my curse you will be turned to water.” Kutila having been cursed by Brahma became water and began to flood the world of Brahma. Seeing the flow of water, Brahma made cause-ways on four sides with the Vedas of Rg, Yajus, Sama and Atharva. Thus being tied up she stays in the world of Brahma. The Devas took Ragini also before Brahma and put the same question. The reply of Brahma was the same as before. She also got angry and said to Brahma. “I will do great penance so as to enable to give birth to one in my family to be the killer of Mahisasura.” Brahma cursed her also. “You are deliberately disobeying my words which even Devas won’t gainsay. So you will become the colours of the twilight.” Thus, she became the fast colours of the twilight, and her body was divided among the Pleiades. (Vamana Purana, Chapter 51).” <strong>Encyclopaedic Dictionary of Puranas, Volume 1, p.237, by Swami Parmeshwaranand, Published by Sarup &amp; Sons, 01-Jan-2001</strong></p>

<h1><strong>Hindu scriptures promoting paedophilia</strong></h1>
<p>Manu Smriti 9.94 A man, aged thirty years, shall marry a maiden of twelve who pleases him, or a man of twenty-four a girl eight years of age; if (the performance of) his duties would (otherwise) be impeded, (he must marry) sooner.</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 9.88 To a distinguished, handsome suitor (of) equal (caste) should (a father) give his daughter in accordance with the prescribed rule, though she have not attained (the proper age).</p>
<p>Parasara Smriti 7.5-6 When the twelfth year is reached by the female child, if the guardian does not give her away in marriage, her fore-fathers drink, without interruption, during each succeeding month, whatever blood is passed in her courses. The mother, and the father, and likewise the eldest brother, all these three relatives will go to hell, if before menstruation they neglect to marry the girl.</p>

My second sister, she became twelve years, and I heard my mother become so disturbed: &#8220;Oh, this girl is not being married. I shall commit suicide…And she was given to a boy, my brother-in-law, for the second marriage. Means that my brother-in-law lost his first wife, and still, he was twenty-one years old. My sister was twelve years old and brother-in-law was twenty-one. In the sastra&#8230; I do not know exactly what is that sastra, but they say that if the girl before marriage has menstruation, then the father has to eat that menstrual liquid. Means it is, mean, very strict. And if the father is not living, then the elder brother has to eat. (break) &#8230;ty of getting the girl married rests on the father. In the absence of the father, the eldest brother. The girl must be married. That is it. It is called daya, kanya-daya.”</p>
<p>Yama Samhita verse 22 “The father, who does give away [in marriage] his maiden-daughter after she has attained the twelfth year, drinks her menstrual blood, month after month.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>

<p>Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Krishna Janma Khanda 76.43-52 &#8220;&#8230;Whoever having decorated his virgin daughter aged eight years with apparel reverentially makes a gift of her to a good Brahmin, reaps the benefits of the gift of Durga.&#8221; Tr. Rajendra Nath Sen</p>
<p>Samvarta Samhita verses 66-68 “[A maiden] eight years [old] becomes Gouri; one of nine years a Rohini; and of ten years, a Kanya (maiden); and after that, a Rajasvala (a woman in menses). By seeing a maiden in menses, her mother, father and eldest brother these three go to hell. Therefore one should espouse a maiden before she has menstruated; the marriage of an eight years old maiden is most preferrable.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti 24.41. A damsel whose menses begin to appear (while she is living) at her father’s house, before she has been betrothed to a man, has to be considered as a degraded woman: by taking her (without the consent of her kinsmen) a man commits no wrong.</p>

<p>Baudhayana Dharmashastra, Prasna 4, Adhyaya 1.11 Let him give his daughter, while she still goes naked, to a man who has not broken the vow of chastity and who possesses good qualities, or even to one destitute of good qualities; let him not keep (the maiden) in (his house) after she has reached the age of puberty”</p>
<p>Vasishtha Dharmashastra 17.70 ‘Out of fear of the appearance of the menses let the father marry his daughter while she still runs about naked. For if she stays (in the house) after the age of puberty, sin falls on the father”</p>

<p>Garuda Purana chapter 95 “…”The relations of a girl incur the sin of wilfully creating a miscarriage, or of killing a foetus in the even of their failing to give her away in marriage before she has commenced to menstruate.

<p>Brahmanda Purana 2.3.19.11 “Many sons should be sought so that at least one would go to Gaya, one shall marry a girl of the Gauri type (i.e. of eight years or one who is a virgin) or one shall discharge a Nala (? lean like a red) bull.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Vayu Purana 21.12 “…It is better to wish for many sons. At least one of them will go to Gaya or marry a girl eight years old or discharge a blue ox (free to wander).’ [15] Brhaspati said: A son begot after marrying after marrying a girl of eight years sanctifies twentyone generations. Moreover, he sanctifies six generations in the family of his maternal uncle. This is remembered as the benefit (of such marriage).” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Kisari Mohan Ganguli writes,</p>
<p>“Vrishalipati literally means the husband of a Sudra woman. By actually marrying a woman of the lowest order, by marrying before the elder brother, by marrying a girl that has attained to puberty, and by certain other acts, a Brahmana comes to be regarded as a Vrishalipati.” On Mahabharata 13.126 <a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m13/m13b091.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m13/m13b091.htm<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>Vyasa Samhita 2.2-4 “…of auspicious signs, clad in silken garments, and not above eight years of age, and whose paternal ancestors to the tenth degree in the ascending line were all men of renown, should be solemnly wedded by a (twice-born) according to religious rites, if preferred in marriage. [7] The sin incidental to (an act of) procuring abortion (lie: destruction of the foetus) is committed, if through the negligence of her giver a girl menstruates before her marriage. He, who does not give away a daughter in marriage before she attains puberty, becomes degraded.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Skanda Purana VII.I.205.80-86 “If a girl, before being consecrated by marriage rites, has her menses in the house of her father, her Pitrs become fallen and that girl is called Vrsali. If a Brahmana knowingly marries that girl, they say, he is not fit for a Sraddha. He cannot be in the same row as others. He is a Vrsalipati. Gauri virgin is the best and most important. Rohini is considered as Madhyama (middling). Rajasvala should be known as the bases though equal to her (Rohini) image. When there is no menstrual flow, she is Gauri. When there is the flow she is Rohini. If the girlhood has not fully developed she is Kanya. One without breasts is Nagnika. A seven year old girl is Gauri; nine year old is Nagnika. Ten year old shall be Kanya; above that she is Rajasvala. Through breasts she spoils the family of her father and through menstrual flow, she spoils the desirable goal (salvation) and pleasures of the other worlds of her father. He who marries one with menstrual flow should be known as Vrsalipati.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 9.41.26-47 “The World-Mother never stays even for a moment in his house who eats at the house of one who marries an unmarried girl twelve years old in whom menstruation has commenced…” Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Above two verses considers the man sinful who marries a girl who started her menstruation in her father’s house which means a person should marry a girl who has not yet started her menstrual period.</p>
<p><strong>Proof that girls as young as 10 were married off</strong></p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 3.27.40 “My daughter has come to a marriageable age; I have no money. Her age has exceeded ten years; the marriageable age limit has been exceeded. Alas! What am I to do?” Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Radha the concubine and aunt of Krishna was married to Rayana at the age of 12,</p>
<p>Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Prakriti Khanda, Chapter 49, Verses 36-40 &#8220;In the Varaha-kalpa, Radhika was born in the village of Gokula in the family of a Vaisya cowherd.

Shanti Lal Nagar, edited by Acharya Ramesh Chaturvedi</p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 5.17.3-26 “The King Chandrasena, the father, was very pleased to have this beautiful daughter and gladly called her by the name of Mandodarî. This daughter began to grow daily like the phases of the Moon. When she grew ten years old, she became very handsome. The King now became anxious to have a suitable bridegroom and used to think of it everyday. The Brâhmins then told the king that there was a prince named Kambugrîva, the intelligent son of the powerful king Sudhanvâ of Madra” Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Skanda Purana III.iii.18.4-6 “When she was aged twelve years, the girl had beauty of form and all good features. A Brahmana named Padmanabha whose wife had passed away, requested for the haand of the girl. The Brahmana had plenty of wealth. He was calm and qui. He was a permanent companion of the king. So the father of the girl did not dare to refuse. He gave the daughter to him. The marriage was celebrated at midday…” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Skanda Purana VII.I.166.17-20 “…You are to behave in a manner that will give no cause to the Devas to despise me. My dear daughter, I have heard this cited in sacred scriptures. ‘If without being consecrated (in marriage) a girl discharges her menses in her father’s house the father earns the sin of Brahmana-slaying and the girl is known as a Vrsali (Sudra). Therefore, I am sending you off in the company of aged ministers. Hurry up. Choose your own husband and decide.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE</strong></p>
<p>Some Hindus have attempted to refute the above points with futile arguments, so here’s a response to those apologists. I have quoted dozens of verses, several apologists have attempted to refute only 20-30% of the article which means a large part of the article is irrefutable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Apologists’ explanation</strong>: According to Rig Veda 10.85.40-41 and Padma Purana V.118.2-15 a girl should be given in marriage only after she attains puberty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Response</strong>: The verse actually states the stages of development of a girl, it doesn’t talk about marrying off daughter only after she attains puberty, in the Atharved it’s a prayer made by a man thanking gods for bestowing riches and sons. A girl can conceive a child only after she attains puberty and that’s what it’s stating here. The apologist has quoted Padma Purana verse out of context (to buttress his RigVed claim) otherwise the verse itself would have refuted the explanation of the apologist, here are the next lines of the verse,</p>
<p>Padma Purana V.118.2-15 &#8220;When small hair appears (on the private parts), Soma enjoys a daughter. When she attains puberty, gandharvas (enjoy her); and when breasts appear (prominent), Fire (enjoys her). <u>A man should marry his daughter as long as she has not attained puberty</u>. <u>Wise men recommend a girl&#8217;s marriage when she is eight years old</u>. She should be duly given to a brahmana who is well-versed in sacred learning, possesses moral virtue, has actually studied Vedas, and has observed celibacy. This is said to be the rule regarding a daughter to be given (in marriage).” Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p>What is alluded here is that a girl should be given in marriage before she is enjoyed by gods i.e. before she attains puberty, these are Hindu god Shiva’s words. Rigved verses 36-38 indicates that the bride was already married and then she started becoming mature.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Apologists’ explanation</strong>: The translation of Valmiki Ramayana about the age of Sita is wrong, here’s the correct translation, “<em>She had been in Ikshwaku dynasty of King Dashratha for <strong><u>two years</u></strong> and got all the materialistic pleasure available for human kind.</em><em> Thereafter, in the <strong>third year</strong>, the king and lord Dasaratha consulted other kings and ministers to consecrate Rama.” </em>The word Dash here doesn’t mean 10 but mentions Dasharath, so Sita’s age at the time of her marriage was 18-2=16 not 6.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Response</strong>: The Sanskrit words mentioned in these verses are so simple that even those fluent in Hindi language can define those words. I am quoting the Sanskrit verses,</p>
<p>उषित्वा <u>द्वा दश</u> समाः इक्ष्वाकूणाम् निवेशने |<br />
भुंजाना मानुषान् भोगान् सर्व काम समृद्धिनी ||</p>
<p>तत्र <u>त्रयो दशे वर्षे</u> राज अमंत्र्यत प्रभुः |<br />
अभिषेचयितुम् रामम् समेतो राज मन्त्रिभिः || ३.४७.४-५</p>
<p>The apologist instead of explaining the verses has mischievously mistranslated his scripture. If the word Dasha here doesn’t mean Ten but rather mentions the name of Dasharath then I am eager to know how would the apologist write twelve and thirteen in Sanskrit language? The word Dva means two, Dasha means ten, Varsha means years, which is quite same for the next verse wherein the word Trayo means three. These words are so simple that I don’t find the necessity to quote any lexicon here. In Shiva Purana, Section 1 Vidyesvara Samhita, Chapter 15, verses 42-45 the same word Dva-Dash is mentioned which is translated by all scholars as Twelve. Apologists are conveniently ignoring Skanda Purana Book III, Section 2, Chapter 30, Verses 8-9 which leaves no doubt regarding the age of Sita at the time of her marriage, it explicitly mentions that Sita was 6 years old at the time of her marriage. To convince the apologist, let me quote another verse from Valmiki Ramayana about the age of Sita at the time she was wedded to Rama,</p>
<p>Valmiki Ramayana, Sundara Kanda 5, Chapter 33, Verses 13-14 “I stayed in Rama&#8217;s house there for twelve years, enjoying the worldly pleasures belonging to human kind and fulfilling all my desires. Thereafter, in the thirteenth year, King Dasaratha along with his preceptors started to perform anointment of the kingdom to Rama, a celebrity of Ikshvaku dynasty.” Tr. Desiraju Hanumantha Rao</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After calculating the years mentioned here we get the same number that Sita was 6 years old.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p><strong>Apologists’ Claim</strong>: Srimad Bhagavatam 10.53.51 is a mistranslation, the verse nowhere states that Rukmini had not attained puberty at the time of her marriage with Krishna. There’s no word for puberty here.</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Response</strong>: The Sanskrit words mentioned in this verse are Stanim (breasts) and Vyanjat (budding) which means her breasts had started budding, these words are used as idioms to state that Rukmini had not yet attained puberty, because the breasts of a girl doesn’t start budding when she is a sixteen years old girl (as apologists claim), by the time a girl reaches the age of 16 she becomes an adult. Almost all translators have translated the same.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p><strong>Apologists’ Claim</strong>: Skanda Purana Book V, Section iii, Chapter 142, Verses 8-79 cannot be used to show that Rukmini was 8 years old because the Sanskrit words mentioned here are Adashta Varsha in which the word Ada is ambiguous so it may mean anything like she has become twice the age.</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Response</strong>: Even the apologist himself is confused, or maybe he is deliberately twisting words in order to cause confusion in the minds of readers. The apologist instead of buttressing his claim with lexicons or texts is rather making assumptions. The Sanskrit words mentioned here are quite clear, words Ashta Varsha means 8 years. This claim of mine about 8 years old Rukmini been wedded to Krishna as per Skanda Purana remains uncontested. Here too I don’t find the necessity to quote lexicons to refute the pathetic claim of the apologist.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p><strong>Apologists’ explanation</strong>: As per Harivamsa Purana Visnuparva 2.59.37 Rukmini was sixteen years old when she was married to Krishna.</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Response</strong>: To my knowledge, there are no Sanskrit words in this verse that can be translated as ‘sixteen years old’, though the text describes Rukmini as an adult. Apologist can quote the Sanskrit words which translates as 16 years old.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apologists also quotes a verse from Brahmavaivarta Purana where Rukmini is described as of having attained puberty. But does that negate Skanda Purana and Bhagavad Purana verses? Does that nullify or refute verses from Skanda and Bhagavad Purana? No, rather they are to be taken as different versions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p><strong>Apologists’ explanation</strong>: The gods and sages didn’t attempt to marry off 6 years old Parvati to Shiva, the reference of Vamana Purana given is wrong.</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Response</strong>: This story is mentioned in Vamana Purana, Saromahatmya chapter 25, verses 1-27, following is the screenshot from the scripture,</p>
<p>My emphasis was not on when Parvati was married to Shiva as Hindu scriptures don’t mention the age of Parvati at the time of her marriage. The Hindu gods had already made up that 6 year old Parvati would be able to hold Shiva’s semen i.e., she would be able to conceive the child of Shiva.<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p><strong>Apologists’ explanation</strong>: Manu Smriti 9.94; Mahabharata 13.44.13 A man, aged thirty years, shall marry a maiden of ten or twelve. These verses merely tells the man to simply marry a girl younger than him, these shouldn&#8217;t be taken literally.</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Response</strong>: Apologists are playing with words to distort their Hindu texts. It’s not a commandment that a man should marry only when he is 30 years old or that a girl should be given in marriage only when she is 10 or 12 years old, and this is what Acharya Medhatithi is also alluding to. A man can marry at the age of 25 given that the girl is very much younger than him, this is already mentioned in Vishnu Purana,</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 3.10.16 “If he marry, he must select a maiden who is of a third of his age.” Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>So a 40 year old man should wed a girl who is around 13 years old, if a man is 20 years old then he must marry a girl who is one third of his age that is he must marry a 6 or 7 years old girl and this is exactly what Mahabharata and Manu Smriti states. The apologists are deliberately ignoring the age gap mentioned in Mahabharata and Manu Smriti that a 30 years old adult man should wed a prepubescent girl of 10-12 years who is one third of his age.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p><strong>Apologists’ explanation</strong>: Vishnu Smriti 24.41 makes it clear that only those girls are considered degraded who haven’t given in marriage before they started menstruating, it doesn’t say keeping a married daughter who started menstruating in father’s home is degraded. It is because a girl has to stay in father’s home after her marriage till she completes her third year after she started menstruating, as we seen earlier.</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Response</strong>: The author himself seems to be confused, he has acknowledged that “only those girls are considered degraded who haven’t given in marriage before they started menstruating”. As the apologist has admitted it, I don’t find the reason to explain it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Written by Hirday N. Patwari<br />
The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manusm%E1%B9%9Bti" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Manusmriti<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> also known as <em>Manav Dharam Shastra</em>, is the earliest metrical work on Brahminical Dharma in Hinduism. According to Hindu mythology, the Manusmriti is the word of Brahma, and it is classified as the most authoritative statement on Dharma .The scripture consists of 2690 verses, divided into 12 chapters.  It is presumed that the actual human author of this compilation used the eponym ‘Manu’, which has led the text to be associated by Hindus with the first human being and the first king in the Indian tradition.<span id="more-4827"></span><br />
<span id="more-1261"></span><br />
Although no details of this eponymous author’s life are known, it is likely that he belonged to a conservative Brahman class somewhere in Northern India. Hindu apologists consider the Manusmriti as the divine code of conduct and, accordingly, the status of women as depicted in the text has been interpreted as Hindu divine law.  While defending Manusmriti as divine code of conduct for all including women, apologists often quote the verse: <em>“yatr naryasto pojyantay, ramantay tatr devta <strong>[3/56]</strong></em> <em>(where women are provided place of honor, gods are pleased and reside there in that household)</em>, but they deliberately forget all those verses that are full of prejudice, hatred  and discrimination against women.<br />
Here are some of the ‘celebrated’ derogatory comments about women in the Manusmriti :<br />
1. “Swabhav ev narinam …..” – 2/213. It is the nature of women to seduce men in this world; for that reason the wise are never unguarded in the company of females.<br />
2. “Avidvam samlam………..” – 2/214. Women, true to their class character, are capable of leading astray men in this world, not only a fool but even a learned and wise man. Both become slaves of desire.<br />
3. “Matra swastra ………..” – 2/215. Wise people should avoid sitting alone with one’s mother, daughter or sister. Since carnal desire is always strong, it can lead to temptation.<br />
4. “Naudwahay……………..” – 3/8. One should not marry women who has have reddish hair, redundant  parts of the body [such as six fingers], one who is often sick, one without hair or having excessive hair and one who has red eyes.<br />
5. “Nraksh vraksh ………..” – 3/9. One should not marry women whose names are similar to constellations,  trees, rivers, those from a low caste, mountains, birds, snakes, slaves or those whose names inspires terror.<br />

7. “Uchayangh…………….” – 3/11. Wise men should marry only women who are free from bodily defects, with beautiful names, grace/gait like an elephant, moderate hair on the head and body, soft limbs and small teeth.<br />
8. “Shudr-aiv bharya………” – 3/12.Brahman men can marry Brahman, Kshatriya, Vaish and even Shudra women but Shudra men can marry only Shudra women.<br />
9. “Na Brahman kshatriya..” – 3/14. Although Brahman, Kshatriya and Vaish men have been allowed inter-caste marriages, even in distress they should not marry Shudra women.<br />
10. “Heenjati striyam……..” – 3/15. When twice born [dwij=Brahman, Kshatriya and Vaish] men in their folly marry low caste Shudra women, they are responsible for the degradation of their whole family. Accordingly, their children adopt all the demerits of the Shudra caste.<br />
11. “Shudram shaynam……” – 3/17. A Brahman who marries a Shudra woman, degrades himself and his whole family  ,becomes morally degenerated , loses Brahman status and his children too attain status  of shudra.<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Written by <a title="Posts by Srinivas Kakkilaya" href="http://nirmukta.com/author/kakkilaya/" rel="author noopener external" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" data-wpel-link="external">Srinivas Kakkilaya<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>The cow is, at the least, an animal domesticated by man for help in agricultural activities.[1]  Although the mighty machines now used in farming have made these animals irrelevant in agriculture, valiant attempts are being made, at least in India, to preserve the exalted position of the so called ‘second mother’ [2] or even ‘mother of the world’ [3,4].<br />
<span id="more-1761"></span><br />
<span id="more-568"></span> The stringent agitations to protect the ‘cow-mother’ [4,5] and even riots and murders of dalits for the sake of the cow,[6,7] suggest that the human life is far less important than a dead cow in this part of the world.[7] This extraordinary reverence for the cow has led to the development and marketing of many ‘products’ made from the secretions and excretions of the cow, with claims that these products may be more ‘lucrative’ than even the dairy.[8]
<strong>‘Cow Products’</strong></p>
<p id="ufgaZfF"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class=" wp-image-7216  alignleft" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/img_5f2412643d604.png" alt="" width="295" height="195" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/img_5f2412643d604.png 417w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/07/img_5f2412643d604-300x199.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 295px) 100vw, 295px" /></p>
<p>The list of ‘products’ developed from the milk and excreta of the cow is quite long. <em><a href="http://www.thereligiousproducts.com/panchagavya.html" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Panchagavya<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></em>and cow urine distillate (<em><a href="http://www.yogashram.in/June%202006.htm" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">gau arka<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></em>) are the most quoted of these preparations.<br />
<em>Panchagavy</em> is a blend of five (<em>pancha</em>) products obtained from the cow (<em>gavya</em> = from <em>gau</em>) – the dung, urine, milk, ghee and curd.[9,10] Three preparations of cow’s urine, namely <em>gau-mutra asav</em> (fermented preparation), <em>gau-arka</em> (or distillate) and <em>Ganavati </em>(or tablet) are also used as medicines.[8,11] Two US patents have also been obtained for the <em>gau -arka</em> [11] and this fact has been highlighted over and over again.<br />
Various products from the cow have been suggested as a successful remedy against more than hundred diseases, from fever to cancer.<strong>[8,11,12] </strong><em>Panchagavya</em> is most reverentially used as a ‘body and soul cleanser’, following the birth or death of a family member. It has also been suggested as a medicine and more profusely as a pesticidal spray for plants and as a soil enriching manure.[10]

<blockquote class="quote-light"><p>Very recently, panchagavya has been suggested as a remedy for chikungunya as well.[13] Cow’s urine has been used in the preparations of hair oil, shampoo, skin cream etc.[8] Preparations like soap, nasal powder, body powder, body cream, incense sticks, tooth powder etc. have been prepared from the cow dung and recommended for medical use[8]. Probably to add sanctity to the entire gamut of these ‘medications’, it has been claimed that Indian pure breed cows have <a href="http://www.yogashram.in/June%202006.htm" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">‘immunology power’<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> from 90% to 98% while the cows of mixed breed have less than 40%.[11]</blockquote>
<p><strong>The ‘evidence&#8217;:</strong><br />
Curious to know about <em>Panchagavya</em>, I asked an Ayurveda physician about its utility. She briefed me about all the virtues of the <em>gau mutra</em> (cow’s urine), <em>gau maya</em> (cow dung) and <em>Panchagavya</em>, quoting the Charaka Samhita. But how can we, living in the 21st century,  rely on an ancient text to justify the use of these excreta, I wondered. All these have been well studied by Charaka, she told me. May be, but the concept of biochemical molecules (and the modern biochemical analysers) and of microbes (and the means of isolating them) were non-existent during Charaka’s time, I countered. But the cow’s urine hasn’t changed since Charaka’s time, she averred. I was dumbstruck!<br />
Most articles on the virtues of cow’s excreta extensively quote from scriptures and the Charaka Samhita. Here are some of these arguments:</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light">
<ul>
<li>The cow is our mother and we are her children. Therefore cow urine is beneficial.[8,11]</li>
<li>Diseases are caused by imbalance of elements bile, mucous and air and cow urine balances elements.[8]</li>
<li>Amongst urines, cow urine is best.[8]</li>
<li>Ganga resides in the cow urine and it contains copper and gold salts, which are elixirs. It does not decay, older the cow urine, the more useful it is.[8]</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Recently a lot has been written about the patents for cow urine; one obtained on the basis of laboratory studies (on culture plates and cell lines) on the usefulness of cow urine distillate in enhancing the efficacy of antibiotics and anti cancer drugs, [14,15] and the other patent obtained for cow urine therapy.[16] There are reports of the use of cow’s urine therapy from Myanmar [17] and of a cow’s urine concoction used as a traditional remedy for convulsive seizures in Nigeria.[18] There have also been reports of studies on the cow’s urine distillate in gouty arthritis, lymphocyte and polymorphonuclear cells and carbon tetrachloride poisoning, all done on experimental animals in small numbers.[19-22] These results have been extrapolated freely and wild conclusions have been drawn about the ‘magical powers’ of the cow’s urine in treating almost all the diseases afflicting mankind today.[14,17] Even the Department of Animal Husbandry of the Ministry of Agriculture, Government of India, has published reports that seek to promote the marketing of cow’s urine as a therapeutic agent.[23]
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The facts:</strong></p>
<p>Faced with this blitzkrieg of marketing of cow’s urine and the real danger that cow’s urine and other products of cow’s excreta may be pushed into the throats of hapless patients, with active support from the govt., agencies., it is time we look into the facts.<br />
One need not go far to see the hypocrisy of the ‘cow urine promoters’ than have a look at the ayurveda texts themselves, extensively quoted as the primary source of support for the utility of cow’s urine as a therapeutic agent. All three major ancient texts of ayurveda, by Charaka (1<sup>st</sup>-2<sup>nd</sup> century), Susruta (3<sup>rd</sup> –4<sup>th</sup> century) and Vagbhata (7<sup>th</sup> century) mention of the therapeutic uses of beef[24,25] as well, but this fact is no where mentioned by the proponents of cow’s urine. Eating beef is a sin and drinking cow’s urine or eating its dung brings health, if these self-styled guardians of ancient Indian tradition are to be believed.</p>
<p>What about the much touted patents for cow’s urine? A patent is a set of exclusive rights granted by a state to an inventor to prevent or exclude others from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing the invention.[26] Nothing more, nothing less. A patent in itself cannot be the proof for the utility of any product. It is hardly surprising that while International patents have been registered for cow’s urine and its products, no such patent has been obtained from the Govt. of India. An Indian patent may not make enough and weighty news, but an international patent, on the other, helps to claim that even ‘foreigners’ have accepted the virtues of cow’s urine!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p id="xfXbjMs"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="300" height="215" class="size-full wp-image-7218  alignright" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/img_5f2412d2c9613.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>All the studies available in the literature about the therapeutic efficacy of cow’s excreta are small studies conducted in the labs and on animals or tissues. There are no reports of any controlled, double blind clinical studies in humans, other than some anecdotal reports and claims by the practitioners of ‘cow therapy’ and all these so called claims of research appear dubious by any scientific standards.[27] Most of these papers contradict their own claims: the claims made about the gold and copper salts in urine, for example, are not supported by the data provided by the protagonists themselves.[8,28]
<p>Urine is urine, the liquid waste that is filtered by the kidneys and excreted through the urinary system. It contains many solutes and biological products that are unnecessary for the living body and hence excreted and also some substances secreted by the urinary tract to facilitate this excretion. Chemical constituents of human and animal urine are almost alike.[28,29] For example, Urokinase is an enzyme secreted into the urine to prevent its clogging; today, it is extracted from human urine and used to dissolve clots in the coronary arteries in patients who suffer a heart attack.[30] Does this justify drinking one’s own urine in case of a heart attack? Far from it. Is cow’s urine safe for mankind? There are reports of severe adverse effects, even fatal, of drinking cow urine concoctions, further supported by experimental evidence.[31] Cow’s urine can also be a source of infectious diseases, especially leptospirosis, [32] that can spread through oral mucosa. The claim that cow’s urine and cow dung have antiseptic properties is not only baseless, but also dangerously misleading. While cow dung (and all fecal matter) is teeming with bacteria excreted from the intestines, several bacteria have been isolated from <em>Panchagavya </em>too.[33,34] Application of these bacteria-rich excreta onto wounds may lead to life threatening sepsis. Only those who are absolutely ignorant about such facts can daringly market cow’s excreta as antiseptics, but the tragedy is that some practitioners of modern medicine, blinded by their faiths in their ‘spiritual heads’ or <em>‘Mathadhipathis’</em> also appear to support such nonsense.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Conclusions:<br />
</strong><br />
It is clear that cow’s urine and other excreta are only the waste products rejected by the animal’s body and are similar to the excreta of other animals and therefore, there is absolutely no reason why the cow’s urine or other excreta should be venerable over those of humans beings or other animals.</p>
<p>The claims of the efficacy of cow’s excreta (and their products) in the treatment of almost every disease are not supported by any evidence and there are no clinical trials reported on the use of these products in human beings. With reports available about the possible adverse effects of the use of cow’s excreta, it is shocking that such products are being allowed to be not only marketed but also trumpeted, even supported by the agencies of the govt. of India, as the ‘cure-for-all’ wonder drugs.</p>
<p>Propaganda regarding the utility of cow’s excreta largely emanates from the obscurantist and Hindu fundamentalist forces and appears to be designed to condemn the ordinary human beings into ingesting cow’s excreta under the alibi of ‘treatment’ and ‘long life’. This is not surprising at all, given the several instances of the down trodden dalits forced into eating even human excreta by the same fundamentalists.[35]
<p>Eulogising the cow (and not buffalo and other cattle that are equally ‘useful’) as ‘second mother’, ‘God mother’, ‘mother of the world’ etc., largely because it provides milk,[11] (and hopefully not because of its excreta) raises a fundamental question about the concept of motherhood itself: Do we love and respect our own mothers solely because we have been breastfed and is motherhood only about milk?</p>
<p>This entire exercise of marketing the cow’s products and promising huge economic benefits (a claim not supported by any data) of keeping the cows even after they have passed the age of secreting milk  is part of the grand design to prevent the slaughtering of the cows so as to deprive the poor sections of the society from quality meat as well as some economic benefits of marketing the beef. But sustaining the livestock is proving to be very costly for the environment, with a large share of global warming attributed to the livestock.[36,37] It is time we take a rational view of all the issues involved.<br />

<p>How and where the Vedas originated are subjects of much debate amongst Hindu circles. The opinions are divergent. Some believe that the Vedas are millions of years old while others consider them to be not more than five thousand years old. When I read through the many articles written on this subject by Hindus themselves, I found that almost all of them assumed the Vedas to be eternal. Hence, the question of the origin of Vedas is never dealt with properly. Those Hindus who addressed this question trivialized it, knowing well the amount of contradictory opinions within Hindu texts. I will attempt to bring together whatever information we get from authoritative Hindu texts regarding this issue.</p>
<p><span id="more-908"></span></p>
<p><strong>Conflicting Reports</strong></p>
<p>1. <em>The Vedas were produced from deities Agni, Vayu and Surya</em></p>
<p>Chandogya Upanishad says</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="372" height="196" class="wp-image-7517" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201-1.gif" alt="https://truthabouthinduism.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/042615_0122_needediting1.gif?w=625" /></p>
<p><strong>“1. Prajapati brooded over the worlds, and from them thus brooded on he squeezed out the essences, Agni (fire) from the earth, Vayu (air) from the sky, Aditya (the sun) from heaven.</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. He brooded over these three deities, and from them thus brooded on he squeezed out the essences, the Rik verses from Agni, the Yagus verses from Vayu, the Saman verses from Aditya.” [Chandogya Upanishad- Adhyay 4, Khanda 17, Mantras1 and 2]</strong></p>
<p>The same view is expressed in Shatpath Brahman 11:5:8:1,2. This reference clearly mentions that Agni, Vayu and Aditya are not the names of any Rishis but are demi gods. Note that only three Vedas are mentioned here. There is no mention of Atharvaved. However, Gopath Brahman (1:49), which is the specific Brahman of Atharvaveda, mentions its deity to be the Moon.</p>
<p>2. <em>The Vedas are the breathings of the Great Being</em></p>
<p>Shatapath Brahman (14:5:4:10) and Brihadaranyak Upanishad (2:4:10) says,</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="387" height="149" class="wp-image-7518" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201-2.gif" alt="https://truthabouthinduism.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/042615_0122_needediting2.gif?w=625" /></p>
<p><strong>“As clouds of smoke proceed by themselves out of a lighted fire kindled with damp fuel, thus, verily, has been breathed forth from this Great Being what we have as Rig-veda, Yagur-veda, Sama-veda, Atharvangirasas, Itihasa (legends), Purana (cosmogonies), Vidya (knowledge), the Upanishads, Slokas (verses), Sutras (prose rules), Anuvyakhyanas (glosses), Vyakhyanas (commentaries)’. From him alone all these were breathed forth.”</strong></p>
<p>Mr. Agniveer has used this verse from Shatapath Brahman to prove that Vedas have emanated from God. He says,</p>
<p><strong>Shatpath Brahman 14.5.4.10 states that Ishwar, who is present even beyond the Akash/Sky created the Vedas. The way breath goes out of body and then comes in, during inception of creation, Ishwar creates the Vedas and illuminates the world, and in the phase of dissolution (Pralay), Vedas no more remain in world. However just as a sapling remains inside the seed, Vedas still remain in knowledge of Ishwar, unchanged.</strong></p>
<p>The interpretation that he tries to put on this verse is unfounded. If he uses this verse as proof of Vedic origin, then he cannot brush aside the fact that even the Puranas, Itihasas, etc are on the same level as the Vedas. He simply gives the reference and his own meaning without quoting the exact verse for fear that his own ideology might be undermined. Anyway, let us move on with other opinions.</p>
<p>3. <em>The Vedas were scraped off from Brihadaranyak Upanishadas being his hair and his mouth</em></p>
<p>Atharvaveda (10:7:20) says,</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="566" height="104" class="wp-image-7519" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201-3.gif" alt="https://truthabouthinduism.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/042615_0122_needediting3.gif?w=625" /></p>
<p><strong>“Declare who is that Skambha, from whom they cut off the Rik verses; from whom they scraped off the Yajush; of whom the Saman verses are the hairs, and the verses of Atharva and Angiras the mouth”</strong></p>
<p>4. Shvetashvatara Upanishad 6: 18 says,</p>
<p><strong>“Seeking for freedom I go for refuge to that God who is the light of his own thoughts, he who first creates Brahma and delivers the Vedas to him”</strong></p>
<p>5. Mundak Upanishad 1:1:1,2 says,</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="403" height="176" class="wp-image-7520" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201-4.gif" alt="https://truthabouthinduism.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/042615_0122_needediting4.gif?w=625" /></p>
<p><strong>“1. BRAHMA was the first of the Devas, the maker of the universe, the preserver of the world. He told the knowledge of Brahman, the foundation of all knowledge, to his eldest son Atharva.</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. Whatever Brahma told Atharvan, that knowledge of Brahman Atharvan told to Angir; he told it to Satyavaha Bharadvaga, and Bharadvaga told it in succession to Angiras.”</strong></p>
<p>Mr. Agniveer makes yet another error on this issue. He claims that Brahma learned the four Vedas from the Rishis. However, according to these references from Svetashvatara and Mundak Upanishads, Brahma was directly taught by God and he in turn taught the other Rishis.  An interesting point to be noted here is that in the same Khanda,  verse 5, Angiras calls the four Vedas as ‘lower knowledge’  (Apra) and says that God cannot be known through the Vedas.</p>
<p>From the above given passages it is clear that there is no clear understanding of the origin of Vedas. The texts mutually contradict. Numerous other Hindu texts have still more variant views about the origin of Vedas. I will summarily mention those views also:</p>
<ol>
<li>According to Taittiriya Brahman (2:39:1) ‘Vedas are the hair of Prajapati’s beard’.</li>
<li>According to Bhagavat Puran (3:12:34-37) ‘Vedas issued from the four mouths of Brahma’.</li>
<li>Vishnu Puran says that ‘Vedas were produced from Gayatri’.</li>
<li>Vishu Puran also says that ‘the Vedas are Vishnu’.</li>
<li>According to Mahabharata, Shanti Parv, ‘Saraswati was the mother of Vedas’.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Rishis as the authors of Vedas</strong></p>
<p>A Rishi is a poet of the Vedas. The meaning of the word <em>Rishi </em>(ऋषि ) as given in <em>Nirukt</em> is <em>Rishidarshanat </em>(ऋषिर्दार्शनात), which means ‘seer’. The famous quote of Yask Muni states that  यस्य वाक्य मस ऋषि, meaning <em>‘Rishi </em>is the one whose quote itself is the mantra’. This is suffient to show that Rishis were the ones who made up the mantras. This is backed up by Taittiriya Brahman (2:8:8:5) which states</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="238" height="41" class="wp-image-7521" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201-5.gif" alt="https://truthabouthinduism.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/042615_0122_needediting5.gif?w=625" /></p>
<p><strong>“Wise Rishis are the makers of mantras”</strong></p>
<p>The assumption that Vedas are eternal makes many Hindus to say that Rishis were given the Vedas. Of this there is not the slightest proof. This Rishis again and again claim to have composed the hymns themselves just as a carpenter makes objects. In some hymns they express no consciousness whatever of deriving assistance from any supernatural source.</p>
<p><strong>How many Rishis?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A.   4 Rishis</strong></p>
<p>Arya Samaj/agniveer claims that Vedas were reaveled to four Rishis, viz, Agni, Vayu, Angira and Surya. However, the reference I gave earlier from Chandogya Upanishad (4:17:1-2) disproves this assertion. This reference clearly calls these four ‘persons’ as <em>Devatas</em> or deities, and not Rishis. The imaginary Rishis of Arya Samaj are nowhere to be found in authoritative Hindu texts. If they were real Rishis we would certainly have their biographies.</p>
<p><strong>B.   414 Rishis</strong></p>
<p>Another view about the Vedic authorship is that Vedic mantras are the works of 414 Rishis, whose names are to be found in <em>Anukarmani</em>. When we read the Vedas, we find the name of a Rishi mentioned with every Sookt (hymn), who can be considered as the author of that particular Sookt. However, Arya Samaj scholars opine that these Rishis are not the ones who conjured up the mantras. Rather, they were the people who comprehended the meaning of the hymns by their meditation. This opinion is false due to the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Rishis whose names are borne at the beginning of the Sooktas, many times their names appear even inside the Sooktas. What is the name of a Rishi doing inside a Vedic Mantra? For example, Vishwamitra JI is the Rishi of the third Mandal (Book) of Rigveda. His name appears in Rigveda 3:53:7,9</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="781" height="496" class="wp-image-7522" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201-2.jpeg" alt="https://truthabouthinduism.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/042615_0122_needediting6.jpg?w=866" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201-2.jpeg 781w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201-2-300x191.jpeg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201-2-768x488.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 781px) 100vw, 781px" /></p>
<p><strong>“Bounteous are these, Angirases, Virupas: the Asura’s Heroes and the Sons of Heaven. They, giving store of wealth to Visvamitra, prolong his life through countless Soma-pressings.</strong></p>
<p><strong>8 Maghavan weareth every shape at pleasure, effecting magic changes in his body, Holy One, drinker out of season, coming thrice, in a moment, through fit prayers, from heaven.</strong></p>
<p><strong>9 The mighty sage, God-born and God-incited, who looks on men, restrained the billowy river.When Visvamitra was Sudas’s escort, then Indra through the Kusikas grew friendly.”</strong></p>
<p>Also, Rishi Kanva is the Rishi of the major part of the 8th Mandal of Rigveda. His name occurs some fifty times within the Mantras of Mandal 8.</p>
<ul>
<li>Not only the names of Rishis but also the names of their contemporary rulers and rishis appear in the Vedic Mantras. For example, Rishi Vashishtha is the Rishi of the 7th Mandal of Rigveda. This Mandal is thus also called as Vashishtha Mandal. Vashishtha was a contemporary of Rishi Vishvamitra and the <em>Purohit</em> (priest) of Raja Ramchandra. His name occurs 45 times.</li>
<li>When the Sookta bears the name of a male Rishi, the genders used in the hymn are always masculine. When the Sookta bears the name of a female Rshika, all the genders used in the Mantras of that Sookt are feminine. This phenomenon is certain proof that the Sookt has been produced by that very Rishi or Rishika. For example, see the Yama-Yami Sookt (Rigveda 10:10), where Yama and Yami both are having a dialogue.</li>
<li>Many Sooktas contain similar dialogues between a man and a woman. They have been assigned as that Sooktas Rishi and Rishika. For example, the dialogue between Indra and his wife, Indrani (Rigveda 10:86)</li>
<li>In some Sooktas, the <em>Devata </em>(deity) of one mantra is the Rishi of next mantra and vice versa. This type of Sookta is known as a dialogue between a Rishi and the Deity. Now, if the Rishi  was only a seer of the mantras, how is it possible that in a particular Sookt, the Rishi becomes a <em>Devata  </em>in one mantra and a <em>Devata </em>becomes a Rishi in another? For example see Rigveda 10:51, where a dialogue is going on between Agni Sauchik and the <em>Devata</em>. Here, in mantras 1,3,5,7 and 9 Agni Sauchik is the <em>Devata</em> while in mantras 2,4,6,and 8 he is the Rishi.</li>
<li>We may ask has Swami Dayanand Ji really understood any portion of the Vedas. If yes, then why is his name not mentioned in the Vedas?</li>
<li>Not even one Sookt in the entire Vedas bears the names of Sri Ram, Sri Krishna, Sri Vyas Ji, who are the stars of Indian literature. Does this imply they never understood the Vedas?</li>
<li>Vedas also contain the mention of the family trees, varnas (Brahmin, Kshatriya,etc) of some Rishis. If the Rishis were only seers, how come did the tales of their mutual conflicts find their way into Vedic Mantras? For example, Vedas inform us about 22 Rishis of Kanva family,  36 Rishis of Atri family, 11 Rishis of Vashishtha family, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Opinions of Rishis concerning the origin of Vedic Hymns</strong></p>
<p>As I have already said that the names of the Rishis of each hymn are found in the <em>Anukarmani</em>. It is a record of the number of verses, name and family of Rishis, names of deities, etc.</p>
<p>In later times when the Vedas were claimed to be eternal, it was pretended that these Rishis were only the ones by whom hymns “were seen” or to whom they were communicated.  However, there is no proof for this.</p>
<p>Now what is the opinion of the Rishis themselves regarding the origin of Vedas. Following points make it clear:</p>
<p><strong>[a]</strong> In the very second mantra of Rigveda is it mentioned</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="567" height="79" class="wp-image-7523" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201-6.gif" alt="https://truthabouthinduism.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/042615_0122_needediting7.gif?w=625" /></p>
<p><strong>“Worthy is Agni to be praised by living as by ancient seers. He shall bring. hitherward the gods.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>[b] </strong>Rigveda 10:54:6 ascribes the making of hymns to a Rishi</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="569" height="133" class="wp-image-7524" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201-7.gif" alt="https://truthabouthinduism.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/042615_0122_needediting8.gif?w=625" /></p>
<p><strong>“An acceptable and honorific hymn has been uttered to Indra by Brihaduktha, maker of hymns”</strong></p>
<p><strong>[c]</strong> Again it is mentioned in Rigveda 7:22:9</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="572" height="131" class="wp-image-7525" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201-8.gif" alt="https://truthabouthinduism.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/042615_0122_needediting9.gif?w=625" /></p>
<p><strong>“Among all Rsis, Indra, old and recent, who have engendered hymns as sacred singers, Even with us be thine auspicious friendships.  Preserve us evermore with blessings.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>[d]  </strong>Who prepares the hymns? Rigveda 5:2:11 says,</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="570" height="126" class="wp-image-7526" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201-9.gif" alt="https://truthabouthinduism.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/042615_0122_needediting10.gif?w=625" /></p>
<p><strong>“As a skilled craftsman makes a car, a singer I, Mighty One! this hymn for you have fashioned. If you, O Agni, God, accept it gladly, may we obtain thereby the heavenly waters.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>[e]</strong> Rigveda 4:16:21 says,</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="566" height="130" class="wp-image-7527" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201-10.gif" alt="https://truthabouthinduism.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/042615_0122_needediting11.gif?w=625" /></p>
<p><strong>“Now, Indra! lauded, glorified with praises, let power swell. high like rivers for the singer. For you a new hymn, Lord of Bays, is fashioned. May we, car-borne, through song be victors ever.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>[f]</strong> Rigveda 7:35:14</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="574" height="103" class="wp-image-7528" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201-11.gif" alt="https://truthabouthinduism.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/042615_0122_needediting12.gif?w=625" /></p>
<p><strong>“So may the Rudras, Vasus, and Adityas accept the new hymn which we now are making. May all the Holy Ones of earth and heaven, and the Cow’s offipring hear our invocation.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>[g]</strong> Rigveda 6:34:1 says,</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="563" height="104" class="wp-image-7529" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201-12.gif" alt="https://truthabouthinduism.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/042615_0122_needediting13.gif?w=625" /></p>
<p><strong>“FULL Many songs have met in you, O Indra, and many a noble thought from you proceed. Now and of old the eulogies of sages, their holy hymns and lauds, have yearned for Indra.”</strong></p>
<p>From this we come to know that instead of the hymns being eternal, or of an infinite age, they are composed by the Rishis themselves. The Rishis explicitly speak of ancient and new hymns. The Rishis entertained the idea that the gods would be more highly gratified if their praises were celebrated in new, and perhaps more elaborate and beautiful compositions, than if older prayers had been repeated.</p>
<p>Panini openly states the fact that there are old and new Brahmanas; whereas according to the doctrine of later times, the brahmanas are neither old nor new, but eternal and of divine origin. He rests his opinoin as to the difference of dates on the evidence of language. One argument of the eternity of Vedas is that sound is eternal. To any person of common sense the simple statement of this proof, is its refutation. The same argument would prove every book to be eternal.</p>
<p>Some Hindus might respond that by the new Rishis and Hymns are meant the Rishis and Hymns of the present life, while the old Rishis and Hymns are of the previous life. This view is far from logical. According to the belief of Arya Samaj, if these are the same Vedas that have always been. then classifying the Hymns into old and new is meaningless. This is because the Hymns that would be new would also be old.</p>
<p><strong>Internal evidence of the authorship of Vedas</strong></p>
<p>When a deed is produced in court, which is affirmed to have been written many hundred years ago, there are often means of judging from the document itself as to its age. Suppose, for example, it contained the names of Einstein, Gandhi or Hitler, it could at once be known that it could not be older than last century. If it were asserted that these referred to other persons of the same name who lived long before or that they were prophecies, the conclusion would be that it was an attempt to support one falsehood by another. If the Vedas are eternal, why are the names of so many persons mentioned in them who lived in comparatively recent times?</p>
<p>The hymns of the Rigveda themselves supply us with numerous data by which we can judge of the circumstances to which they owed their origin, and of the manner in which they were created. They afford us very distinct indications of the locality in which they were composed.  The Indus is the great river; the Ganges is only twice mentioned; the Sarasvati was the eastern boundary.</p>
<p>The hymns show us Aryan tribes living in a state of warfare with surrounding enemies (some of them, probably, alien in race and language), and gradually, as we may infer, forcing their way onward to the east and south. They supply us with numerous specimen of the particular sorts of prayers, viz., for protection and victory, which men circumstanced would naturally address to the gods whom they worshipped as well as of the more common applications which men in general offer up for the various blessings that constitute the sum of human welfare.</p>
<p>The following hymn to Indra, asking him to destroy the Dasyus, the aborigines, and give food and a camp with running water, bears internal evidence that it was composed at a time when the Aryans were invading India:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="575" height="602" class="wp-image-7530" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201-13.gif" alt="https://truthabouthinduism.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/042615_0122_needediting14.gif?w=625" /></p>
<p><strong>1 GLAD you: your glory has been quaffed, Lord of Bay Steeds, as ’twere the bowl’s enlivening mead.<br />
For you the Strong there is strong drink, mighty, omnipotent to win.<br />
2 Let our strong drink, most excellent, exhilarating, come to you,<br />
Victorious, Indra bringing gain, immortal conquering in fight,<br />
3 You, Hero, winner of the spoil, urgest to speed the car of man.<br />
Burn, like a vessel with the flame, the lawless Dasyu, Conqueror!<br />
4 Empowered by your own might, O Sage, you stole Sarya’s chariot wheel.<br />
You bare Kutsa with the steeds of Wind to Susna as his death.<br />
5 Most mighty is you rapturous joy, most splendid is your active power,<br />
Wherewith, foe-slaying, sending bliss, you art supreme in gaining steeds.<br />
6 As you, O Indra, to the ancient singers wast ever joy, as water to the thirsty,<br />
So unto you I sing this invocation. May we find strengthening food in full abundance.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Conclusion as to the authorship of the Vedas</strong></p>
<p>Quotations have been given from Hindu sacred books containing many different opinions as to the origin of Vedas. In opposition to these, the authorship of many of the hymns is distinctly claimed by persons whose names are given. The hymns themselves demonstrate that they were composed when the Aryans were entering India, when they had not advanced much beyond the border, and were engaged in constant wars with the natives.</p>
<p>Victory in battle was often ascribed to the virtue of a hymn. Thus in Rigveda 7:33:3,</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="586" height="104" class="wp-image-7531" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201-14.gif" alt="https://truthabouthinduism.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/042615_0122_needediting15.gif?w=625" /></p>
<p><strong>“So, verily, with these he crossed the river, in company with these he slaughtered Bheda. So in the fight with the Ten Kings, Vasisthas! did Indra help Sudas through your devotions.”</strong></p>
<p>Such hymns were considered unfailing spells, and became the sacred war-songs of the whole tribe. They were handed down from the father to son as the most valuable heirloom.</p>
<p>The legitimate conclusion is that the Vedic hymns were written by the authors whose names they bear, and they are not eternal.</p>

<p>Make sure that you read the article &#8216;<a href="/index.php/2014/01/02/origin-of-vedas-their-inspiration-and-authority/" data-wpel-link="internal">Origin of Vedas, Their Inspiration and Authority</a>&#8216; to have a better comprehension of this article.</p>
<p>After reading about the origin of Vedas, we now move on to the textual corruption of the Vedas.  A lot of claims are made by many modern Hindus about the perfect preservation of the Vedas. Mr. Agniveer too makes such high flying claims. I have analyzed this topic objectively and want to present the result before the readers.</p>
<p><span id="more-906"></span></p>
<p>Let me start by sharing with you an interesting yet ludicrous story that is mentioned in the Shanti Parv of Mahabharata; the story of the Vedas being stolen from the Creator of the Worlds by two demons, Madhu and Kaitabha. We read about this in Shanti Parv, Section 348. The two mighty Danavas (demons), having seized the Vedas, quickly dived into the ocean of waters which they saw and proceeded to its bottom. Seeing the Vedas forcibly taken away from him, Brahma Ji became filled with grief, and started wailing.  The Vedas were later recovered by Vishu Ji&#8217;s timely intervention but still it shows the insecurity of the Vedic texts from the very beginning. If Brahma Ji had memorized the Vedas, how could the Vedas have been stolen? Perhaps his memory was not that strong after all. I only shared this story to give the readers an idea of a book which according to Mr. Agniveer is the  &#8216;greatest wonder of human civilization&#8217;. Truly a wonder it is.</p>
<p><strong>What is the total number of the Vedas?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Three, Four or Five Vedas?</strong></p>
<p>One opinion is that there are three deiies, and from them originate the three Vedas or three types of mantras.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="372" height="196" class="wp-image-7494" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021.gif" alt="http://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/060218_0652_testingtext1.gif" /></p>
<p><strong>&#8220;1. Prajapati brooded over the worlds, and from them thus brooded on he squeezed out the essences, Agni (fire) from the earth, Vayu (air) from the sky, Aditya (the sun) from heaven.</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. He brooded over these three deities, and from them thus brooded on he squeezed out the essences, the Rik verses from Agni, the Yagus verses from Vayu, the Saman verses from Aditya.&#8221; [Chandogya Upanishad- Adhyay 4, Khanda 17, Mantras1 and 2]</strong></p>
<p>The same view is expressed in Shatpath Brahman 11:5:8:1,2. Note only three Vedas are spoken here. Further Manu 1:23 says,</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;But from fire, wind, and the sun he drew forth the threefold eternal Veda, called Rik, Yagus, and Saman, for the due performance of the sacrifice.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>Also see Manu 2:118, 2:118, 2:230, 9:188, where only three Vedas have been mentioned.</p>
<p>Even Swami Dayanand writes in Satyarth Prakash, Chapter 3, on the authority of Manu Smriti 3:1,</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Thus after joining the school at the age of 8 years, if a student studies the Vedas with their subsidiary subjects for 36 years, (i.e., he devotes 12 years to the study of each of the three Vedas), he completes his education at the age of 36+8=44.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>Therefore, according to Swamiji and Manu Smriti, Vedas are only 3. Is Atharvaved really a genuine Veda?</p>
<p>The popular opinion is that Vedas are four in number viz. Rigved, Yajurved, Samved and Atharvaved. Another opinion is that Vedas are five in number because Atharvaved is actually two Vedas; one is Atharvaved and the other Angirasved.</p>
<p>The divergent opinions regarding the number of Vedas do not end here. Another authoritative view which holds its place is that Vedas number 1131 as we shall see.</p>
<p><strong>1131 Vedas?</strong></p>
<p>According to the Mahabhasya of Patanjali, there were 21 Shakhas of Rigveda, 9 of Atharvaveda, 101 of Yajurveda (86 of Krishna Yajurveda and 15 of Shukla Yajurveda, according to later authorities) and a 1000 shakhas of Samaveda. All these add to give the figure 1131. All these Shakhas are considered to be Vedas. The words Shakha means a &#8216;branch&#8217; or a &#8216;limb&#8217; and refers to a particular traditional text followed, as in the phrase śākhām adhite, (&#8220;he recites a particular version of the Veda&#8221;).</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="585" height="501" class="wp-image-7495" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-37.jpeg" alt="http://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/060218_0652_testingtext2.jpg" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-37.jpeg 585w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-37-300x257.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 585px) 100vw, 585px" /></p>
<p>However, out of these 1131 Shakhas, only 11 Shakhas remain alive. As far as Rigved is concerned, only one Shakha, Shaakal Shakha alone remains alive out of the 21 that existed at one time. Another shakha that may have survived is the Bāṣhkala, although this is uncertain. Out of the 101 Shakhas of Yajurveda, only 6 are alive. In fact, Yajurveda is classified broadly into Shukla Yajurveda  (White) and Krishna Yajurveda (Black). The former is popular in North India while the later is popular in South India.  Shukla Yajurveda is also known as Vajasaneyi. The Vajasaneyi Samhita has forty chapters or adhyayas and there are two extant Shakhas of Shukla Yajurveda viz. Kanvaand Madhyandina. Krishna Yajurveda has 4 extant Shakhas viz.</p>
<ul>
<li>Taittirīya</li>
<li>Maitrayani</li>
<li>Kaṭhak</li>
<li>Kapiṣṭhala</li>
</ul>
<p>There are three surviving Shakhas out of 1000 of the text of the Samaveda Samhita:</p>
<ul>
<li>the Kauthuma Shakha is current in Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Orissa and since a few decades in Darbhanga, Bihar,</li>
<li>the Jaiminiya in the Carnatic, Tamilnadu and Kerala,</li>
<li>and the Rāṇāyanīya in the Maharastra.</li>
</ul>
<p>Out of the nine Shakhas of Atharvaveda, only two have survived</p>
<ul>
<li>Paippalāda, in regions south to Narmada river</li>
<li>Shaunakīya, in regions north to Narmada river</li>
</ul>
<p>What we know today as Rigveda, Yajurveda, Samaveda and Atharvaveda are actually Shakhas from the multitude of other Shakhas. The so called Vedas are never named as Vedas in their hymns. In other words, Rigveda is never called Rigveda in the Rigveda itself. If it be said that in other scriptures they have been called as Vedas, we can respond that so many other things have been called as Vedas also. For example, Ayurveda (Medicine), Sarpaveda (snakes), Dhanurved (weapons), Itihasaveda (History), Puranaveda (Stories). These words are based on Shatapath Brahman 13:4:3.</p>
<p>Hence, 1121 versions of Vedas have been lost. If someone will say that the Shakhas are not Vedas but only the explanations/commentaries that would be erroneous. The presently known Vedas are also Shakhas. So are these commentaries or actual Vedas? To say that Shakhas are not the Vedas will be to undermine the present Vedas (read Shakhas) also. Considering the two opposing Shakhas of Yajurveda we may ask, &#8220;Is Madhyandina Shakha (Shukla Yajurveda) the original or Taittirīya Shakha (Krishna Yajurveda)?&#8221;.</p>
<p>The above analysis makes it clear that a large portion of the Vedas has been lost.</p>
<p><strong>A topical study of the corruption of the Vedic text</strong></p>
<p><strong>Missing Verses</strong></p>
<p>After the collection and codification of Vedas, many different manuscripts gained currency amongst the Brahmin groups. The number of mantras in every manuscript continued to be changed. The current version of Rigveda was collected by Shaakal Rishi and was thus called Shaakal Samhita. It is divided into 10 Mandals (Books).</p>
<p>Nirukt 7:8 mentions the following,</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;There is a joint oblation offered to Agni and Vishnu in the ten books of the Rigveda.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>However, in the entire Rigveda, there is not a single mantra jointly praising Agni and Vishnu.  What is meant by joint oblation here? An oblation is an offering (Late Latin oblatio, from offerre, oblatum, to offer), a term, particularly in ecclesiastical usage, for a solemn offering or presentation to God. Where is an offering jointly made to Agni and Vishnu, we would like to see? This is a clear evidence that the Rigveda at the time of Yaska Muni had the joint oblation offered to Agni and Vishnu, but it is not found in today&#8217;s Rigveda, demonstrating corruption of the text.</p>
<p><strong>Corruption in recitation</strong></p>
<p>The oral tradition of the Vedas (Śrauta) consists of several pathas, &#8220;recitations&#8221; or ways of chanting the Vedic mantras.The padapatha consists of dividing the sentence into individual pada or words. The kramapatha consists of pairing two words at a time. There has been a lot of corruption in the former recitation. I will give some examples to demonstrate this.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1</strong></p>
<p>Yask Muni, the author of Nirukt and Nighantu, writes that Vaayah is one word [See Nirukt 6:28]. But in the Shaakal Shakha&#8217;s (Rigveda&#8217;s) padapatha, it has been divided and hence became meaningless. Rigveda 10:29:1 is the place which has made the mistake.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="571" height="152" class="wp-image-7496" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-1.gif" alt="http://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/060218_0652_testingtext3.gif" /></p>
<p><strong>&#8220;As sits the young bird on the tree rejoicing, ye, swift Pair, have been roused by clear laudation,…&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>Yaska himself criticizes Shakalya and says,</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Sakalya has analyzed Vaayah into Vaa and yah, then the finite verb would have had the accute accent and the sense have been incomplete.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Example 2</strong></p>
<p>Rigveda 5:39:1 goes as follows,</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="567" height="77" class="wp-image-7497" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-2.gif" alt="http://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/060218_0652_testingtext4.gif" /></p>
<p><strong>&#8220;O Indra, wielder of the thunderbolt, give us whatever excellent treasure there is. With both hands bring that wealth to us, O treasure-knower&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>Yaska says on this,</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Sakalya the author of Rigveda padapatha, does not analyze the word Mehanaa, while Gargya the author of Samaveda padapatha analyzes it into Me-iha-naa.&#8221; [Nirukt 4:4]</strong></p>
<p>Let us see what Samaveda, Book 4; Chapter 2; Decade 1; Mantra 4 does,</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="569" height="78" class="wp-image-7498" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-3.gif" alt="http://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/060218_0652_testingtext5.gif" /></p>
<p>Now there is a world of difference between <strong>Mehanaasti </strong>and <strong>Me-iha-naasti</strong>. The former means &#8216;I have wealth&#8217; and the latter means &#8216;I do not have&#8217;.</p>
<p><strong>Different versions of Rigveda</strong></p>
<p>Shaakal Rishi is called as the collector of Rigveda. He had a number of students, who later expressed many differences and compiled their own versions of Rigveda. numbering upto 21. There are major differences between the Shaakal and Baskal samhitas of Rigveda. The Śākala recension has 1,017 regular hymns, while the Bāṣkala samhita has a total of 1025 hymns.  Thus, around  some 50 mantras are missing in Śākala samhita. There are differences even over the total number of mantras.</p>
<ul>
<li>According to Anuvakanukramani Rigveda has 10,580 mantras</li>
<li>According to Gayatri Parivar Rigveda has 10,552 mantras</li>
<li>According to Sayanacharya it has 10,000 mantras</li>
<li>According to Swami Dayanand Saraswati it has 10,589 mantras</li>
</ul>
<p>As per these figures, some 500 mantras are doubtful or interpolated. However, the story does not end here. Pandit Ram Govind Trivedi, mentions another surprising fact in the preface to his Hindi translation of the Rigveda. He says,</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="595" height="166" class="wp-image-7499" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-4.gif" alt="http://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/060218_0652_testingtext6.gif" /></p>
<p>&#8220;According to one Mantra of Rigveda (Page 1403, Mantra 8), we come to know that it has 15,000 Mantras. However, when we count the total Mantras, we get 10,469 Mantras. It is possible that  like a large portion of the books of Vedic literature and Vedas were destroyed by the anti-religious, similarly,  Mantras too suffered destruction for many reasons.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Mantra he is talking about is Rigveda 10:114:8, which says,</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="565" height="106" class="wp-image-7500" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-5.gif" alt="http://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/060218_0652_testingtext7.gif" /></p>
<p><strong>GAYATRI PARIVAR TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="625" height="115" class="wp-image-7501" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-6.gif" alt="http://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/060218_0652_testingtext8.gif" /></p>
<p>According to this analysis, Vedas have easily lost about 4,500 Mantras.</p>
<p><strong>Different versions of Yajurveda</strong></p>
<p>As I said earlier, out of 101 Shaakhas of Yajurveda only 6 are extant. There are two principal texts of the Yajur-Yeda, called respectively the White and the Black, or the Vajasaneyi and Taittiriya Samhitas.</p>
<p>The Vishnu Purana gives the following explanation of their names : Vaisampayana, a pupil of the great Vyasa, was the original teacher of the Black Yajur-Veda. Yajnavalkya, one of his disciples, having displeased him, was called upon by his master to part with the knowledge which he had acquired from him. He forthwith vomited the Yajur-Yeda. The other disciples of Vaisampayana, assuming the form of partridges (tittiri), picked up from the ground its several dirtied texts. From this circumstance it received the name of Taittiriya Krishna Yajur-Veda. A more rational explanation is that Vaisampayana taught it to Yaska, who taught it to Tittiri, who also became a teacher. Yajnavalkya afterwards, by the performance of severe penances, induced the Sun to impart to him those Yajur texts which his master had not possessed. The Sun then assumed the form of a horse (Vajin), and communicated to him the desired texts. Hence the Sanhita was called Vajasaneyi, and also White (or bright) because it was revealed by the Sun.</p>
<ol>
<li>There are a lot of differences between the two versions. The first mantra of both is same despite some difference in the wording. The arrangement and wording of White Yajurveda upto Adhyay 15 is radically different from the Black Yajurveda. The mantras of the 39th Chapter of Shukla Yajurveda are not found in Krishna Yajurveda.</li>
<li>An amazing information about Shukla Yajurveda is that the last chapter (Chapter 40) is actually an Upanishad, the Ish Upanishad. As per the belief of Arya Samaj, Upanishads are not revealed scriptures. It is worth noting that while it is counted with the Upanishads, the Ish Upanishad remains non-revealed and when it is added to the Veda it become revealed.</li>
<li>The Ish Upanishad is not the only addition to this Yajurveda. A lot of Brahamanas have been inserted into the text of the Yajurveda. For example, Adhyay 24 is entirely a Brahman; Adhyay 30: verses 7 through 15 are all Brahmanas and not Mantras.</li>
</ol>
<p>Not only in the ancient period, but in recent times too there have been many changes in the Vedic texts by Swami Dayanand Saraswati and his followers.</p>
<p>Following is a list of changes that have been made.</p>
<ol>
<li>In the Yajurveda Bhasya of Dayanand Ji, Adhyay 9, Mantra 20 has been distorted by adding the word Gamyaat, which is not to be found in the text. Where did this word come from?</li>
</ol>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="531" height="657" class="wp-image-7502" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-7.gif" alt="http://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/060218_0652_testingtext9.gif" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Comparing the Yajurveda of Gayatri Parivar and Arya Samaj, there are many mantras missing in one or another of the versions. For example, the 25th Chapter of Gayatri Parivar Yajurveda has 47 mantras. Even the Yajurveda of Ralph Griffith has 47 mantras. But, the Arya Samaj version has an additional Mantra 48.</li>

<p>No one can call these interpolations and alterations to be printing errors, because the translations also have been made of the interpolations. These are examples of deliberate interpolations.</p>
<p><strong>Corruption of Samaveda</strong></p>
<p>Samaveda is heavily borrowed from the Rigveda. It consists of a collection of hymns, portions of hymns, and detached verses, all but 75 taken from the Sakala Sakha of the Rigveda, the other 75 belong to the Bashkala Sakha, to be sung, using specifically indicated melodies, called Samagana. There are differences regarding the exact number of mantras in the Samaveda. As I said earlier,  according to Patanjali&#8217;s statement, &#8220;sahasravartma samvedah&#8221; सहस्रवर्त्म<br />
समवेदः, &#8220;There are thousand branches of Samaveda&#8221;. However, only three survive:</p>
<ul>
<li>the Kauthuma Shakha is current in Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Orissa and since a few decades in Darbhanga, Bihar,</li>
<li>the Jaiminiya in the Karnatak, Tamilnadu and Kerala,</li>
<li>and the Rāṇāyanīya in the Maharastra.</li>
</ul>
<p>The total mantras in the Jaimniya Shakha is 1687. Kauthama Shakha has 1869 mantras . Thus, 182 mantras are missing fromKauthama Shakha. An analysis of both these versions reveals lots of Paath-Bhed (variant readings). Besides this, there is a difference in number of songs attributed to different branches. Shri Satvalekar in his preface to Samaveda Samhita has given the following table of songs (Samagana).</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td><strong>Songs of Jaiminiya Branch</strong></td>
<td><strong>Songs of Kauthamiya Branch</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Gramgeyo-gān:</td>
<td>1233</td>
<td>1197</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Aranyageya-gān:</td>
<td>291</td>
<td>294</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ooh-gān:</td>
<td>1802</td>

<td>Oohya-gān:</td>
<td>356</td>
<td>205</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Total</td>
<td>3681</td>
<td>2722</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>We can easily see that the Samaganas of Jaiminiya Version are 1000 more than those of Kauthamiya Version.</p>
<p><strong>Corruption in Atharvaveda</strong></p>
<p>Atharvaveda, also known as Brahmaveda is considered the youngest amongst all other Vedas. As I mentioned earlier, out of the nine versions of Atharvaveda according to Patanjali, only two are extant</p>
<ul>
<li>Paippalāda, in regions south to Narmada river</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Shaunakīya, in regions north to Narmada river</li>
</ul>
<p>Both versions have lot of differences in the words and arrangement.  Paippalada Shaakha can further be divided into two parts; Atharvaveda and Angirasveda. It is mentioned in Shatapath Brahman 13:4:3:4-8 in the context of the Ashvamedha sacrifice; after theYagya (ritual) is completed, the householders should be instructed in Rigveda of the first day. old men should be instructed in Yajurveda on the second day, handsome youths should be instructed in Atharvaveda on the third day and handsome maiden should be instructed in Angirasveda on the  fourth day. Angirasveda is attributed to Rishi Angiras who is in the fourth generation after Rishi Atharva. There is no mention of Samaveda in this reference of Shatapath Brahman.</p>
<p>Patanjali Rishi, in his Mahabhasya, has given the first mantras of all the four Vedas. In the present Atharvaved (Shaunak Shaakha) it is not the first mantra, but the 26th mantra. This means 25 mantras are extra in that Shaunak shaakha.</p>
<p>Following is an exmaple of textual corruption in the Atharvaveda.</p>
<p>Atharvaveda Khand 20 and Sookt 127 is part of the Kuntap Sooktas. In the third mantra of this Sookt there has been  an alteration. The Atharvaveda of Arya Samaj and Gayatri Parivar both have it as follows:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="365" height="67" class="wp-image-7511" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-15.gif" alt="http://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/060218_0652_testingtext18.gif" /></p>
<p>The word preceeding <strong>Maamahe</strong> is <strong>Eeshaai</strong>. However, in the Atharvaveda of Pandit Raja Ram Shashtri of Arya Samaj as well as the Atharvaveda printed in Germany, the text differs as follows:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="317" height="56" class="wp-image-7512" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-16.gif" alt="http://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/060218_0652_testingtext19.gif" /></p>
<p>Here the word preceeding <strong>Maamahe </strong>is <strong>Rishye </strong>and not <strong>Eeshaai</strong>. This makes a difference in the meaning of the mantra.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>The above analysis proves beyond the shadow of a doubt that Vedas have suffered heavy interpolations and changes. Talking strictly, even if one accusation of the above analysis stands, the entire Vedic literature will be unacceptable as a genuine inspired document.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">Written by Ibn Muhammad<br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">What, in the first place, has Hinduism to say about God and His attributes, and what kind of worship does it teach mankind?<br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">At the very threshold, we are met with the formidable difficulty that Hinduism is not one religion but many religions jumbled together under a single name. It is a hodge-podge or conglomeration of many mutually conflicting religions, and is not the child, so to say, of any one father. Those who practice it differ very much from one another in their faith and practice. Hinduism includes in it Vedism, Brahmanism, Sivaism, Vishnuism, Polytheism, Pantheism, Idolatory in is greatest forms, Tree-Worship, Serpent-Worship, Demon-Worship and so on.<br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-5644"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">It is not easy therefore to give a definition of Hinduism,  &#8220;Hinduism and its gods,&#8221; says Sir Alfred Lyall, &#8220;are a troubled sea, without shore or visible horizon, driven to and fro by the winds of boundless credulity and grotesque invention. A tangled jungle of disorderly superstitions, ghosts and demons, demi-gods and deified saints, household gods, tribe gods, local gods, universal gods, with their countless shrines and temples, and din of their disordent rites, deities who abhor a fly&#8217;s death, those who delight still in human victims, and those who would not either sacrifice or make offerings, such religious chaos&#8221;. <strong><sup>[1]</sup></strong><br />
</span></p>
<h3>The Authoritative Books not one but many</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">A further difficulty regarding Hinduism lies in the fact that all its professors have no common sacred Book or Books to depend upon for their doctrines. Some refer to Vedas as the basis of their faith. Others rest their faith on the Shrutis, a term which includes not only the four Vedas but their Brahmanas and Upanishads as well. The Mahabharata styles itself as the fifth Veda, containing the quintessense of all the rest. Other Hindus agains follow the teachings of the Puranas. The present day educated Hindus are mainly depending upon the Bhagavad Gita, a philosophical treatise, for their guidance in matters of faith. We shall therefore briefly inquire into the contents of all these books to see what they teach about God and the way in which man should worship Him.<br />
</span></p>
<h3>The Religion of the Vedas</h3>
<h4>(a) Nature Worship</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">Vedism, or the Religion of the Vedas, teaches the worship of the deified forces or phenomenon of Nature, such as Fire, the Sun, Wnd and Rain. Here is the opening verse of the Rigveda, the oldest Veda, of which the others are mere repetitions and borrowing:<br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>अग्निमीळे पुरोहितं यज्ञस्य देवं रत्वीजम |  होतारं रत्नधातमम || </strong><br />
</span></span></p>
<blockquote class="quote-light">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">&#8220;I Laud Agni, the great high priest, god, minister of sacrifice, the herald, lavishest of wealth.&#8221; [Rigveda Mandal 1: Sookt 1: Mantra 1]
</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">The whole of the Veda goes on in this strain throughout in the hymns collected for different purposes. The contrast between the opening  verse of the Rigveda which teaches Polytheism, and that of the Jewish Bible and of the Holy Qur&#8217;an which teach Monotheism, cannot fail to be noted even by the most superficial reader. Thus the Jewish Pentateuch begins,<br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>בראשית ברא אלהים את השמים ואת הארץ׃</strong><br />
</span></p>
<blockquote class="quote-light">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">&#8220;In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.&#8221; [Genesis 1:1]
</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">The Holy Qur&#8217;an strikes the key note of its whole teaching in a still more profound manner, unparalleled in other religions:<br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong><span style="font-family: Traditional Arabic;">بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> &#8211; </span><span style="font-family: Traditional Arabic;">الْحَمْدُ للَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ &#8211; الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ &#8211; مَـلِكِ يَوْمِ الدِّينِ</span></strong></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<blockquote class="quote-light">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">&#8220;In the name of Allah, the Most Compassionate, the Most Merciful. All Praise is due to Allah, Lord of the Worlds, the Most Compassionate, the Most Merciful. Master of the Day of Judgement.&#8221;[Surah Al-Fatiha 1:1-4]
</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">Thus Vedism teaches the worship of the powers of Nature.<br />
</span></p>
<h4>(b) Polytheism</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">That it teaches polytheism is also evident from the expression used in the same verse and in all the succeeding verses as well:<br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>अग्निः पूर्वेभिर्र्षिभिरीड्यो नूतनैरुत | स देवानेह वक्षति || </strong><br />
</span></span></p>
<blockquote class="quote-light">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">&#8220;He (Agni) shall bring hitherward the gods.&#8221; [Rigveda 1:1:2]
</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>अग्ने यं यज्ञमध्वरं विश्वतः परिभूरसि | स इद्देवेषु गछति ||</strong><br />
</span></span></p>
<blockquote class="quote-light">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">&#8220;Verily goes to the gods.&#8221;[verse 4]
</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>अग्निर्होता कविक्रतुः सत्यश्चित्रश्रवस्तमः | देवो देवेभिरा गमत || </strong><br />
</span></span></p>
<blockquote class="quote-light">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">&#8220;May Agni, priest, the god, come hither with the gods.&#8221; [verse 5]
</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">The number of gods in Hindu Pantheon is given as 33 in one place (Rigveda 1:34:11), which says,<br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><strong><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><br />
</span></strong></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>आ नासत्या तरिभिर एकादशैर इह देवेभिर यातम मधुपेयम अश्विना | परायुस तारिष्टं नी रपांसि मर्क्षतं सेधतं दवेषो भवतं सचाभुवा ||</strong><br />
</span></span></p>
<blockquote class="quote-light">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">&#8220;Come, O Nasatyas, with the thrice-eleven Gods; come, O ye Asvins, to the drinking of the meath. Make long our days of life, and wipe out all our sins: ward off our enemies; be with us evermore.&#8221;<br />
</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">Similarly it is mentioned in Rigveda 8:30:2,<br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>इति सतुतासो असथा रिशादसो ये सथ तरयश्च तरिंशच्च | मनोर्देवा यज्ञियासः || </strong><br />
</span></span></p>
<blockquote class="quote-light">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">&#8220;Thus be ye lauded, ye destroyers of the foe, ye Three-and-Thirty Deities, The Gods of man, the Holy Ones.&#8221;<br />
</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">In Rigeveda 10:52:6 the number is 3,339. It says,<br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>तरीणि शता तरी सहस्राण्यग्निं तरिंशच्च देवा नवचासपर्यन | औक्षन घर्तैरस्त्र्णन बर्हिरस्मा आदिद्धोतारं नयसादयन्त || </strong><br />
</span></span></p>
<blockquote class="quote-light">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">&#8220;The Deities three thousand, three hundred and thirty-nine, have served and honoured Agni, Strewn sacred grass, anointed him with butter, and seated him as Priest, the Gods&#8217; Invoker.&#8221;<br />
</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">Later Hinduism has gone still further by saying that there are no less than 33 crores of them.<br />
</span></p>
<h4>(c) Pantheism</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">Why not then say that everything is God, and God is everything? The Purusha Sukta (Rigveda 10:90) which every orthodox Brahmin is expected even now to recite daily in his prayers shows that Pantheism is also taught in the later portions of the Vedas:<br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>पुरुष एवेदं सर्वं यद भूतं यच्च भव्यम | उताम्र्तत्वस्येशानो यदन्नेनातिरोहति || </strong><br />
</span></span></p>
<blockquote class="quote-light">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">&#8220;This Purusha(i.e. Brahma or God) is all that yet has been and all that is to be.&#8221; [verse 2]
</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">The caste system which has proved the curse of India is likewise taught in the same hymn:<br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>बराह्मणो.अस्य मुखमासीद बाहू राजन्यः कर्तः | ऊरूतदस्य यद वैश्यः पद्भ्यां शूद्रो अजायत || </strong><br />
</span></span></p>
<blockquote class="quote-light">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">&#8220;The Brahmana was his (Purusha&#8217;s) mouth. Of both his arms was the Kshatriya made. His thighs became the Vaishya. From his feet the Sudra produced.&#8221;[verse 12]
</span></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Religion of the Upanishads</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">The Upanishads reject the Karma, Kanda or Salvation by means of sacrifices and other rituals taught in the four Vedas and Brahmanas, and advocate the Gnana-Kanda or the theory of Salvation by knowledge. Hence they consist of speculations about the individual souls (atma) and the Supreme soul (Param-atma), and about the relationship subsisting between them, their aim being to get rid of man&#8217;s earthly existence by absorption of the individual soul into the World Soul through correct or true knowledge. They teach that the Universe or Nature (Prakriti) is unreal or <em>Maaya</em>, that is to say, it does not really exist but it only an illusion of the mind. What really exists in the Supreme Soul or Brahman, and the individual souls are all emanations from Him and identical with Him. Only they do not know it, as Brahman has invested Himself/Itself with the <em>Maaya</em>, and they also are under the influence of the same mystic power. The individual souls can be disillusioned only by means of Correct knowledge, and as soon as this consummation is reached, they know themselves to be Brahman, and get absorbed into Him. The famous formula referring to this theory is <strong><em>&#8216;Tat tvam asi&#8217;</em></strong> </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">तत् त्वम् असि </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">meaning &#8216;That art thou&#8217;, whoever knows this &#8216;becomes the All&#8217;. Even the gods are not able to prevent him from becoming it. For he becomes their self. <em>[Brihadaranyak Upanishad 1:4:6]</em><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">This theory is known as the Vedanta, the essence of the teaching of the Vedas, and has taken an immense hold on the minds of the people and lent a deeper colour to all subsequent literature. A Christian missionary asked a Brahmin, &#8220;Who and where is Brahman?&#8221; &#8220;He is talking to you,&#8221; was the prompt reply.<br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">A Vedantist once began to dilate upon the truth of his belief in the presence of a king and vehemently maintained that the whole world was <em>Mithya</em> or unreal, imaginary: whereupon an elephant was ordered to be brought quite near to him and the man fled in terror. &#8220;Why do you run away for your life? The elephant is <em>Mithya</em>&#8221; said the king. But the Vedantist proved himself equal to the occasion and without a moment&#8217;s hesistation replied that the running away too was <em>Mithya</em>.<br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">Such is the fool&#8217;s paradise in which most of the misguided Hindus live. The expression that is often heard on their lips, and which has unfortunately recently been made famous by Dr. Zakir Naik through his televised public talks:<br />
</span></p>
<blockquote class="quote-light">
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><em>EKAM EVA ADVITIYAM</em><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">meaning &#8216;One only without a second&#8217;<br />
</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">It does not mean that they believe in the &#8216;Only One True God&#8217; but it is the Vedantic or Pantheistic formula which asserts that the only real existence of the World Soul and the identity of the individual souls within it, totally denying the existence of the phenomenal world.<br />
</span></p>
<h3>Religion of the Puranas</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">The characteristic of popular Hinduism of today is the belief in Divine incarnations, idolatory and caste. Popular Hinduism believes in the doctrine of Trimurti or Hindu Trinity as Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva, in their characteristic of the Creator, Preserver and Destroyer of the Universe.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">Vishnu Worship</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">The distinct feature of Vishnu worship is the incarnation of God. When wickedness in the world increases Vishnu is said to take upon himself the form of an animal or man in order to be able to protect the good and to punish the bad. The principle incarnations He is said to have so far assumed are those of (1) a fish, (2) a tortoise, (3) a Boar, (4) a man-lion (5) a Dwarf, (6) a Brahmin hero called Parasu Ram, (7) a Kshatriya Prince, the hero of Ramayana, (8) a shepherd Prince Krishna and (9) a Kshatriya heretic, Buddha.<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">Krishna declares:<br />
</span></h4>
<blockquote class="quote-light">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">&#8220;On an occasion of marriage, or of enjoying a woman, or when life is in danger, or when one&#8217;s entire property is about to be taken away, or for the sake of a Brahmin, falsehood may be uttered. These five kinds of falsehood have been declared to be sinless. On these occasions falsehood would become truth and truth would become falsehood.&#8221; [Mahabharata Book 8; Karna Parva; Section 69]
</span></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">Cow Worship</span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">It is natural for Indians to set a high value upon the cow on account of its utility, but the worship the Hindus pay to it is irrational and absurd to a degree. It is considered to be the most sacred of all animals. Every part of its body is considered to be inhabited by some deity or other. Even its excreta are considered to be most sacred. Its urine is looked upon as the best of all holy waters; a sin destroying liquid which sanctifies everything it touches, while nothing purifies like cow-dung. The ashes of its dung sprinkled over a sinner are able to convert him into a saint.<br />
</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Veneration of Cow in Hindu Culture</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">Present day Hindu culture is pivoted solely on the cow. Its material and spiritual concepts are both engulfed in cow worship. Such an animal worship is known as zoolatry. This is a vestide of animistic cultures among whom the worship of monkeys, sheep, elephants, cows and even snakes was prevalent. Animal worship culminated in the taking of human beings for gods so that the silhouettes were stamped on the coins and painted on the flags, and upon their honour depended the glory and honour of their realms.<br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">Among cultivators cow worship is not a strange thing. In many countries, notably, India, Iran and Egypt, it was prevalent. Among Hindus veneration of the cow is referred to in the Vedas as Puranas and in Hindu Jurisprudence and folklore. In the Vedas several verses refer to saluting and prostrating before the cow as the following sections illustrate:<br />
</span></p>
<blockquote class="quote-light">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">&#8220;Prajapati and Parameshthin are the two horns, Indra is the head, Agni the forehead, Yama the joint of the neck. King Soma is the brain, Sky is the upper jaw, Earth is the lower jaw&#8230; All worlds and all the gods are as the cow from head to foot.&#8221; [Atharvaved Kaand 9: Sookt 7]
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">&#8220;You are being created and have been created for salutations and prostrations. Salutations and prostration to you, O image of God, to your hair, to your hooves.&#8221; [Atharva 10:10]
</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">Curiously enough, the Vedic Rishis likened the chanting of their mantras (hymn) to the lowing of the cows:<br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>अभि विप्रा अनूषत गावो वत्सं न मातरः | इन्द्रं सोमस्य पीतये || </strong><br />
</span></span></p>
<blockquote class="quote-light">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">&#8220;As the cows moo in the presence of their calves so do Brahmins recite their mantras while drinking the soma juice in the presence of Indra devta.&#8221; [Rigveda 9:12:2]
</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">In old Vedic timesthe pious people picked out the grain from the cow-dung, and then ate it. They also squeezed out its water and drank it (Mahabharata). Its urine was considered a source of redemption of sins and a means of cow-dung bathed with water extracted thus. Krishna Ji revered the bull by stroking its back before mounting it. In short, in Hindu religion the cow in venerated to an extent which gods and godesses and even God Himself does not merit.<br />

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Cow-Worship and the humiliation of Man</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">It is to be noted that the sacredness of the cow as compared with the scant regard for human life has come to this that Swami Dayanand Saraswati in accordance with the Vedas, opines that the blood of thousands or hundreds of thousands of humans, may be shed to please these animals; (See his translation of Yajurveda 33:14 and Rigveda 1:121:10)<br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">In Vedic times, there lived an untouchable people in a village named Kikat, in todays Bihar. The used to rear cattle. Obviously to the Aryans this was a crime. So they invoked their god Indra to wage war against them and loot their cows.<br />

<blockquote class="quote-light">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">&#8220;O Indra, what do the cows make for you among the Kikatas. They neither yield milk for your offerings, nor do they warm the vessel of libation. Bring to us these cows, bring to us also the wealth of Pramagand (their King). O Brave one, grant us the possessions of the people of low status.&#8221; [Rigveda 3:53:14]
</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">On the basis of this clear prnouncement, non-Aryans and untouchables have no right to keep cows. Aryans and Brahmins whenever they wish can kill them and appropriate their possessions. Hindu culture thus becomes the culture of the progress, civilization and welfare of the Aryan people alone.<br />
</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Status of the Cow</h3>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">The fact remains that Hindu culture is based on the cow. Actually it is cow-worship as may be inferred from the discussion so far. As the Noble Qur&#8217;an states,<br />
</span></p>
<blockquote class="quote-light">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">&#8220;And their hearts absorbed (the worship of) the calf because of their disbelief.&#8221; [Surah Baqarah 2:93]
</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">The cow is also called mother and this is a relic of the age of ignorance. In primitive times when the mother of a young child died, the child too would die of malnutrition after two or three days. The father did not know how to save the child&#8217;s life as a substitute for the mother&#8217;s milk was not known. By chance, some wise person thought of the idea of giving goat&#8217;s milk to the child. As the goat was easier to control and milk than the cow, goat&#8217;s milk was used to save the infant&#8217;s life. Later on the cow was tamed for this purpose. From then on the polytheists began to call the cow &#8216;mata&#8217; i.e. mother. But other animals as well, such as goats, sheep, camels, supply milk as substitute for mother&#8217;s milk; yet they are never called &#8216;mother&#8217;. Strangely enough, in this age of science when so many baby-foods have been invented, none of these is called &#8216;mother&#8217;, yet wealthy and educated Hindus still apply this epithet to the cow alone.<br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">The nation which cannot differentiate between a cow&#8217;s tail and a man&#8217;s head, lives in an extreme abyss of culture. The cow is at the utmost an animal, while even the most degraded man, being still a human being, is yet far superior to a cow.<br />
</span></p>
<h3>Religion of the Gita</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">Since Mahabharata fails to serve as a handy and useful book of the essence of Hinduism, the present day educated Hindus are adopting the Bhagvat Gita as their guide.<br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">Like all the other scriptures this famous poem too fails to teach True Religion to mankind. It is a highly Philosophic poem just as ill-suited to teach Religion as Berkley&#8217;s <em>Principle of Human Knowledge </em>or Milton&#8217;s <em>Paradise Lost</em> can be. The principle of its composition is Eclecticism and tries to combine Sankhya, Yoga, and Vedanta teaching into one whole to support the Vaishnava theory of Krishna&#8217;s deification.But is does promote ideas like Polytheism and Caste. Krishna claims to be the author of the caste system in India:<br />
</span></p>
<blockquote class="quote-light">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">&#8220;The four Castes were created by me according to the appointment of qualities and works.&#8221; [Gita 4:13]
</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">The Gita does not insist on the worship of the One and Only True God but promotes belief in polytheism:<br />
</span></p>
<blockquote class="quote-light">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">&#8220;Those who worship gods go to the gods&#8221; [9:25]
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">&#8220;Worship the gods thereby; The gods shall yield thee grace.&#8221; [3:3]
</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">That there are inconsistencies in the Bhagvad Gita is admitted today even by Hindu scholars. For example at Chapter 9, stanza 29 Krishna declares that &#8216;none is hateful to me, none dear.&#8217; And yet the remarkable verses at the close of Chapter 12 contradict it, &#8216;Linked by no ties to earth, steadfast in Me, That man I love&#8217;. At Gita Chapter 5, stanza 15 it is said, that &#8216;the Lord receives the sin and merit of none.&#8217; Yet at Chapter 5, stanza 29, and again at Chapter 9, stanza 24, Krishna calls himself &#8216;the Lord and enjoyer&#8217; of all sacrifices and penances. How, it may well be asked, can the Supreme Being &#8216;enjoy&#8217; that which he does not even &#8216;receive&#8217;?<br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">The doctrine of transmigration is the basis from which the argument of Bhagvad Gita takes its start. Matter and spirit are without beginning (13:20). God (Krishna-Vishnu) is eternal, almighty, unborn, without beginning, the great Lord of the World (10:3). He is different not only from the fleeting world, but also from the changeless and indestructible energy of all beings. Vishnu is born from age to age (4:6-8). Krishna-Vishnu is wholly distinct from Brahma and Brahman is distinctly a lower deity than Krishna (11:15,37). In 12:1-7, the two classes, those who believe in a personal God Krishna-Vishnu, i.e. theists, and those who believe in Brahma ,i.e. pantheists are contrasted, and preference is given to former. In other words, final bliss is difficult of attainment for those who follow the Vedas and seek the heaven of Brahma. All external observances and duties prescribed by the Vedas are held to be mischievous and thrown overboard (7:20; 18:34,66). The Vedas and the works enjoined by them cannot win one the vision of the Divine (11:48,53). What a contempt is expressed for the Vedas in the following words: &#8220;Steady understanding does not belong to those, whose minds are drawn by that flowery talk (i.e. Vedas) which is full of ordinances of specific acts for the attainment of pleasures and power, and which promises birth as the fruit of acts- that flowery talk which those unwise ones utter, who are enamoure of Vedic words, who say there is nothing else, who are full of desires, an whose goal is heaven. The Vedas merely relate to the effects of the three qualities; do you, O Arjuna! rise above those effects of the three qualities.&#8221; (2:42-45). Thus the Vedas are being spoken of in very disparaging terms and the followers of Krishna were inimical to the Vedas.<br />
