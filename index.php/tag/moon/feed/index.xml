<p>Read new article <a href="/index.php/2019/03/29/scientific-errors-in-hinduism/" data-wpel-link="internal">Scientific Errors in Hinduism</a></p>
<p>Hindus have become very enthusiastic in finding science in their holy books after they learnt that other religious texts have scientific facts. They are reinterpreting it, they are not aware of the fact that the writers of the Vedas were ignorant of science, as a result the Vedas contain several scientific errors. Ishwar should have studied kindergarten books, I am sure Vedas would have been scientific if he did that.</p>

<p><strong>EARTH IS IMMOVABLE/FIXED</strong></p>
<p>Atharva Veda 6.77.1 &#8220;The heavens have stood, the earth has stood, all creatures have stood. The mountains have stood upon their<br />
foundation, the horses in the stable I have caused to stand.&#8221; Tr. Maurice Bloomfield</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="681" height="246" class="wp-image-7396" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021.jpeg" alt="http://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/060218_0650_testingscie1.jpg" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021.jpeg 681w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-300x108.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 681px) 100vw, 681px" /></p>
<p>Some apologists argue that that the word &#8220;Asthaat&#8221; means &#8220;steady&#8221; and not fixed or standing still, this doubt can be cleared from the following verse,</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 6.44.1 &#8220;The heavens have stood still, the earth has stood still, all creatures have stood still. The trees that sleep erect have stood still: may this disease of thine stand still!&#8221; Tr. Maurice Bloomfield <img decoding="async" width="595" height="72" class="wp-image-7397" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021.png" alt="http://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/060218_0650_testingscie2.png" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021.png 595w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-300x36.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 595px) 100vw, 595px" /></p>
<p>Above is Shripad Damodar Satvalekar&#8217;s Hindi translation and below is Kshemkarandas Trivedi&#8217;s translation,</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="556" height="138" class="wp-image-7398" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-1.png" alt="http://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/060218_0650_testingscie3.png" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-1.png 556w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-1-300x74.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 556px) 100vw, 556px" /></p>
<p>Both the Hindi verses translated by Kshemkaran Das Trivedi and Shripad Damodar Satvalekar has translated the word Asthaat as &#8220;Tehri hai&#8221; which means standing still but some people tries to twist this verse in the following way.<br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="781" height="144" class="wp-image-7399" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-1.jpeg" alt="http://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/060218_0650_testingscie4.jpg" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-1.jpeg 781w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-1-300x55.jpeg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-1-768x142.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 781px) 100vw, 781px" /></p>
<p>Scholar has cleverly translated the word &#8220;Prithvyasthaad&#8221; [Prithvi+Asthaat] as &#8220;Earth is firm&#8221; but then translates the same word as standing still [Tehra hai] when it comes it Trees and Malady. Atharva Veda 6.44.1 is a prayer to stop malady, it says that just as Earth is standing still, trees are standing still, world is standing still, the same way make this malady stand still. Now if we go with apologists definition then it would be like &#8220;Let this malady of your stand firm&#8221; and that would be illogical, isn&#8217;t it? If it&#8217;s just about firmness then why does it talk about trees? doesn&#8217;t trees shake with a gust of wind? Trees stands in its place and doesn&#8217;t move and it being compared to earth proves that earth is motionless according to Vedas.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rig Veda 10.149.1 Savitar has fixed the earth with supports ; Savitar has fastened heaven in unsupported space…</p>
<p>Nirukta 10.32 Savitar caused the earth to be fastened with supports. In the supportless atmosphere Savitar has made the heaven firm…</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 13.1.6 …Rohita with his might hath established Earth and Heaven.</p>

<p>.</p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.89.4, Sam Veda 4.1.5.8 Indra hath fixed [Stopped] the earth and heaven as with an axle…</p>
<p>Following is the Hindi translation by Pandit Ram Govind Trivedi</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="502" height="164" class="wp-image-7401" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-2.png" alt="http://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/060218_0650_testingscie6.png" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-2.png 502w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-2-300x98.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 502px) 100vw, 502px" /></p>
<p>Yajur Veda 5.16 pastures, fair to do men service. Both these worlds, Vishnu, hast thou stayed<br />
asunder, and firmly fixed the earth with pegs around it.<br />

<p>Yajur Veda 32.6 By whom the heavens are strong and earth stands firmly…</p>

<p>Above verse clearly uses the word &#8220;Drdh दृढ&#8221; which has several meaning like &#8220;Fixed, strong, firm&#8221; but mainly refers to something immovable which we shall further discuss in the article.</p>
<p>Rig Veda 3.30.4 …the heaven and <strong>earth<br />
and the mountains stands immoveable</strong>.</p>

[This verse is translated into English from Hindi Bhasya.]
<p>Rig Veda 10.173.4 4 Firm is the sky and firm the earth, and stedfast also are these hills. Stedfast is all this living world, and stedfast is this King of men.<br />

<p>An Indian scientist named Bhaskaracharya (1114-1185) wrote,</p>
<p>&#8221;As heat is an inherent property of the Sun and of Fire, as cold of the Moon, fluidity of water, and hardness of stones, and as the air is volatile, so the earth is naturally immovable. For oh! the properties existing on things are wonderful.&#8221;-Siddhanta Shiromani Goladhyaaya of Bhaskaracharya, Bhuvankosh, Shloka 5</p>
<p>Many verses clearly uses the word Drdh दृढ which means fixed but Hindus argue that it means firm, whether Drdh means fixed or firm can be better understood after reading Rig Veda 8.78.5; 10.173.4; Atharva Veda 6.88.1, 20.34.2, 19.32.9, 13.1.6-7 and Yajur Veda 1.17 which says the Earth is Fixed. The Atharva Veda 6.77.1 and 6.44.1 explicitly states that Earth is standing still (not moving). But still Hindus will argue that it doesn&#8217;t mean what it says. Then what was the logic behind Ishwar revealing so many verses on Earth&#8217;s &#8216;Stability&#8217;? It&#8217;s plain and clear, the earth is fixed according to the Vedas as proved from verses which says that Earth is standing still. Even if we accept their claim, then why does Vedas talk about Earth along with Heaven that the earth and heaven are firmly fixed? As per the Vedas both heaven and earth are immovable.</p>
<p><strong>HOW DO SKY/HEAVEN LOOKS LIKE</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.59.2 The forehead of the sky, earth&#8217;s centre, Agni became the messenger of earth and heaven. <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="73" height="73" class="wp-image-7407" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-4.jpeg" alt="http://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/060218_0650_testingscie12.jpg" /></p>

<p>Rig Veda 8.41.10 In his successive functions, he emits his  bright rays (during day) or turns them dark (during the night). He measures out the eternal abode, and supports with the pillar of the firmament, both heaven and the earth.  May all our adversities vanish&#8221; Tr. SatyaPrakash Saraswati</p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.160.4 Among the skilful Gods most skilled is he, who made the two world-halves which bring prosperity to all;Who with great wisdom measured both the regions out, and stablished them with pillars that shall ne&#8217;er decay.</p>
<p><strong>Bull is holding up the Earth </strong></p>
<p>Atharva Veda 4.11.1 The Bull supports the wide-spread earth and heaven, the Bull supports the spacious air between them. The Bull supports the sky&#8217;s six spacious regions: the universal world hath he pervaded.</p>

Those Hindus should thoroughly think about this verse, it states the 7 horses (rays according to you) TAKES the Sun, logically does the rays takes the Sun? The Sun emits rays, it does not go after the rays. So this explanation of 7 horses as 7 rays is illogical. Moreover even the scholars are not sure whether this means 7 rays or horses while few other regard 7 horses as 7 days. Veda says that Vushab (Sun or Bull) has thousand rays not seven rays. Other Hindu text affirms that the Seven Horses are actual Horses, below are the references,</p>
<p>Mahabharata book 13.158.20-22 …the sun possessed of a thousand rays… He it is that constitutes the wheel of the year, having three naves and seven horses to drag it…He is the sun, the dispeller of all darkness.</p>
<p>Bhagwad Purana (Srimad Bhagavatam) 5.21.12-19 Thus the chariot of the sun-god, which is trayimaya, or worshiped by the words om bhur bhuvah svah, travels through the four residences…My dear King, the carriage of the sun-god&#8217;s chariot is estimated to be 3,600,000 yojanas [28,800,000 miles] long and one-fourth as wide [900,000 yojanas, or 7,200,000 miles]. The chariot&#8217;s horses, which are named after Gayatri and other Vedic meters, are harnessed by Arunadeva to a yoke that is also 900,000 yojanas wide. This chariot continuously carries the sun-god. Although Arunadeva sits in front of the sun-god and is engaged in driving the chariot and controlling the horses, he looks backward toward the sun-god…My dear King, in his orbit through Bhu-mandala [Earth],<br />
the sun-god traverses a distance of 95,100,000 yojanas [760,800,000 miles] at the speed of 2,000 yojanas and two krosas [16,004 miles] in a moment.</p>
<p>Devi Bhagwatam 8.15.40-45 …The seat of the Sun on his chariot measures 36 Lakh Yoyanas wide. The Yuga measures in length one fourth of the above dimensions, that of his seat. The Chariot is moved by seven horses, consisting of the seven Chhandas, Gâyatrî, etc., driven by Aruna. The horses carry the Sun for the happiness of all. Though the charioteer sits in front of the Sun, his face is turned towards the west. He does his work as a charioteer in that state…</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana 1.2.23.50-51 &#8221;He is served by Gandharvas and groups of celestial damsels by means of sons and dances. The lord of the day (i.e. the sun) thus revolves and wanders by means of horses that gallop and that are as swift as birds. The chariot of Soma (the Moon) has three wheels. His horses have the lustre of Kunda (white jasmine) flowers. They are ten in number and they are yoked to the left as well as to the right. The moon traverses by means of this.&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, Edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>From the above passages it doesn&#8217;t sound like the horses are rays but it signifies that the Sun LITERALLY travels on a chariot dragged by seven horses. They no where says that the sun&#8217;s chariot pulled by horses is an allegorical sentence, rather they say exactly what they Vedas states. If the 7 horses of the sun are the seven rays then what are the 10 horses of the moon? Does it mean the moon emits rays of its own? with additional 3 rays?</p>
<p>The Vedas also says the Sun hides</p>
<p>Rig Veda 3.49.5 Where as a Friend with friendly men, Navagvas, with heroes, on his knees he sought the cattle.here, verily with ten Dasagvas Indra found the Sun lying hidden in the darkness.</p>

<p><strong>How Rain Occurs</strong></p>
<p>&#8221;The oblation full of cooked articles put into the fire, goes up to the sky. And returns there from full of rain.&#8221;- Yajur Veda 3.49, Tr. Devi Chand, p.43.</p>
<p>&#8221;We perform the yajna for Vasus, Rudras and Adityas&#8230;The desired oblation (Ahuti) reaches the space, comes in contact with air and the light of that sun. It thence brings down rain for us&#8230;&#8221;- Yajur Veda 2.16, Tr. Devi Chand, p.32-33.</p>
<p>It is mentioned in Brahmana,</p>
<p>Maitrayana Brahmaya 6.37 … &#8216;The oblation which is properly thrown on the fire, goes toward the sun; from the sun comes rain&#8230;&#8221; It is mentioned in Manu Smriti</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 3.76. An oblation duly thrown into the fire, reaches the sun; from the sun comes rain, from rain food, therefrom the living creatures (derive their subsistence).</p>
<p>Krishna says in Gita,<br />
Gita 3.14-15 All living bodies subsist on food grains, which are produced from rains. Rains are produced by performance of yajña [sacriﬁce], and yajña is born of prescribed duties. Regulated activities are prescribed in the Vedas, and the Vedas are directly manifested from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Consequently the all-pervading Transcendence is eternally situated in acts of sacriﬁce.</p>
<p>A Hindu scholar writes why the Sky looks blue and also how rain occurs,</p>
<p>&#8221;6. Is it not ether, then, that you see in the sky above, blue and dusty?</p>
<p>A.- No.</p>
<p>Q.- What is it then?</p>
<p>A. It is the fine particles of earth, water and Agni (in the atmosphere). The blue colour is  mainly due to the particles of water in the atmosphere that come down as rain, while the dusty appearance is due to the particles of dust which is carried up from the earth and floats about the air. It is these things that are seen and reflected in water in a mirror, and not ether.&#8221;- Satyarth Prakash, Swami Dayanand Saraswati, Ch 8, p.276, Tr. Chiranjiva Bhardwaja.</p>
<p><strong>EARTH IS FLAT</strong></p>
<p>Suppose If you were to describe that the earth is flat, how would you explain it? You might say earth has ends, earth has four corners and it is four cornered. Every sane person will give this same answer. When you see the article on scientific errors in Bible on Hindu websites, they have no problem quoting a verse from the Bible which says earth has four corners, but have they ever wondered what their scripture says about it.</p>
<p>Rig Veda 7.83.3 The ends of the earth are beheld laid waste…<br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="539" height="256" class="wp-image-7456" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-29.png" alt="http://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/060218_0651_testingscie28.png" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-29.png 539w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-29-300x142.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 539px) 100vw, 539px" /></p>
<p><strong>अंत [Anta]= End</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 8.25.18 He who hath measured with his ray the boundaries [ends] of heaven and earth..<br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="550" height="195" class="wp-image-7457" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-30.png" alt="http://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/060218_0651_testingscie29.png" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-30.png 550w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-30-300x106.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /></p>
<p>The word used in the above verse is Puthvi which means earth, some Hindus may try to escape the argument saying boundaries of Bhumi [land or earth] refers the actual boundaries of nations, but the above verse uses the term Puthvi which particularly refers to earth. The word boundary here is signifying the limits of Earth.</p>

<p><strong>Vedas explicitly states Earth is Four Cornered</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.58.3 Thy spirit, that went far away, away to the four cornered earth.<br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="526" height="37" class="wp-image-7461" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-31.png" alt="http://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/060218_0651_testingscie33.png" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-31.png 526w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-31-300x21.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 526px) 100vw, 526px" /></p>
<p>Word by Word Sansksrit translation,</p>
<p>यते [Yate] = Your</p>
<p>मन [Mann] = Spirit/Mind</p>
<p>जगाम [Jagaam] = Goes</p>
<p>दूरकम् [Durkam] = Far away</p>
<p>चतुर्भृष्टि [Chaturbhushti/Caturbhrsti] = Four Cornered</p>
<p>भूमि [Bhumi] = Earth</p>
<p>The word Chaturbhusti (also spelled Caturbhrsti) means Four cornered,</p>
<p>Monier-William&#8217;s Sanskrit dictionary also gives the same meaning</p>
<p><a href="http://sanskritdictionary.com/caturbh%E1%B9%9B%E1%B9%A3%E1%B9%ADi/78694/1" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">http://sanskritdictionary.com/caturbh%E1%B9%9B%E1%B9%A3%E1%B9%ADi/78694/1<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>Moreover the Brahmanas affirms this verse,</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahman 6.1.2.29 …Now this earth is four-cornered, for the quarters are her corners: hence the bricks are four-cornered; for all the bricks are after the manner of this earth.</p>
<p>Now, still some would argue that Rigved verse is not in literal sense and refers to earth as four cornered symbolically. If it really referred to earth as four cornered &#8221;Symbolically&#8221; then the Brahmanas would not have likened the shape of the earth with a brick. This verse from the Brahmanas could have been rejected if it was contradictory to the Vedas but both the Vedas and Brahmana says the same thing that the Earth if Four Cornered. A globe cannot have corners, These verses proves that earth is flat as per the Vedas.</p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.62.3 Ye raised the Sun to heaven by everlasting Law, and spread broad earth, the Mother…<br />

<p><strong>The Earth is stretched out</strong></p>
<p>There is no problem if the Vedas says the earth is stretched out, but after reading about the four cornered earth verses, these verses could be understood in a different manner that the earth is stretched out on all the four corners.</p>
<p>Rig Veda 3.6.5 Great are the deeds of thee, the Great, O Agni: thou by thy power hast spread out earth and heaven.<br />

<h3>Read New Article <a href="/index.php/2019/03/29/scientific-errors-in-hinduism/" data-wpel-link="internal">Scientific Errors In Hinduism</a> For More Scientific Errors</h3>
<p>Vedas contain many scientific errors. Make sure you read the articles <a href="/index.php/2014/05/14/scientific-errors-in-vedas-part-i/" data-wpel-link="internal">Scientific Errors in Vedas Part I</a> to know about the scientific errors mentioned in Vedas. In this article I will try to refute the so called scientific claim made about Vedas. I am using Hindi translation of Shri Ram Sharma (Gayatri Parivar) and I will be using Arya Samaj translation as well.</p>
<p><span id="more-273"></span></p>
<p><strong>CLAIM</strong></p>
<p>Yajur Veda 33.43 &#8221;The sun moves in its own orbit in space taking along with itself the mortal bodies like earth through force of attraction.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>From the above translation itself we can draw other meanings also for example, it implies that the Earth is following the Sun and they have same orbit. This verse is mistranslated, here is the correct translation,</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 33.43 Throughout the dusky firmament advancing, laying to rest the immortal and the mortal, Borne on his golden chariot he cometh, Savitar, God, beholding living creatures.<br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="454" height="104" class="wp-image-7777" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-123.png" alt="http://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/060218_0659_testingresp11.png" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-123.png 454w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-123-300x69.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 454px) 100vw, 454px" /></p>
<p>According to Veda the Sun moves alone it does not move taking along other planets,</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 23.10 The Sun moves single and alone…</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="576" height="74" class="wp-image-7778" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-124.png" alt="http://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/060218_0659_testingresp21.png" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-124.png 576w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-124-300x39.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px" /></p>
<p>Above two verses rather says that the Sun moves here and there.</p>
<p><strong>CLAIM: EARTH MOVES AROUND THE SUN</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.149.1</p>
<p>&#8220;The sun has tied Earth and other planets through attraction and moves them around itself as if a trainer moves newly trained horses around itself holding their reins.&#8221;</p>
<p>In this mantra,</p>
<p>Savita = Sun</p>
<p>Yantraih = through reins</p>
<p>Prithiveem = Earth</p>
<p>Aramnaat = Ties</p>
<p>Dyaam Andahat = Other planets in sky as well</p>
<p>Atoorte = Unbreakable</p>

<p>This verse is also mistranslated by the writer, the correct translation is,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.149.1 सविता यन्त्रैः पर्थिवीमरम्णादस्कम्भने सविता दयामद्रंहत अश्वमिवाधुक्षद धुनिमन्तरिक्षमतूर्तेबद्धं सविता समुद्रम</p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.149.1 SAVITAR fixed the earth with bands to bind it…</p>
<p>Maharshi Yaska writes,</p>
<p>Nirukta 10.32 &#8221;Savitr has fixed the earth with supports; Savitr has fastened heaven in unsupported space&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>This passage from Nirukta makes it more clear which translation is correct.</p>
<p>How can they claim that the earth moves around the sun according to Vedas when the Veda clearly states that the Earth is fixed and it&#8217;s the Sun which moves around the Earth. An Indian Scientist named Bhaskaracharya (1114-1185) wrote that the earth is immovable</p>
<p>&#8221;As heat is an inherent property of the Sun and of Fire, as cold of the Moon, fluidity of water, and hardness of stones, and as the air is volatile, so the earth is naturally immovable. For oh! the properties existing on things are wonderful.&#8221;-Siddhanta Shiromani Goladhyaaya of Bhaskaracharya, Bhuvankosh, Shloka 5</p>
<p><strong>CLAIM: SUN IS HOLDING UP THE EARTH</strong></p>
<p>Atharva Veda 4.11.1&#8243;The sun has held the earth and other planets&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>The writer has translated the word वृषभ (Vrishab) as SUN, but it is literally translated as Bull, the correct translation for this verse is,</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 4.11.1 The Bull supports the wide-spread earth and heaven, the Bull supports the spacious air between them.</p>

<p>Some Hindus might argue that Vrishab doesn&#8217;t mean Bull it means Sun. For the sake of the argument let&#8217;s accept it. But a Vedic verse makes an unscientific claim about Vrishab</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 4.5.1, Rig Veda 7.55.7 The Bull [Vrishab/Sun] who hath a thousand horns, who rises up from out the sea…</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="624" height="116" class="wp-image-7780" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-126.png" alt="http://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/060218_0659_testingresp41.png" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-126.png 624w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-126-300x56.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" /></p>
<p>Now let Hindus decide what does Vrishab means. It is also mentioned in Brahmana,</p>
<p>Kausitaki Brahmana 18.9 Him who yonder gives heat they seek by these pressings to obtain; the rising by the morning pressing, (the sun) in the middle (of his course) by the midday pressing, (the sun) as he sets by the third pressing. He, having entered the waters, becomes Varuna.</p>

<p>This verse is a simile. Griffith has interpreted it as &#8221;The tempest-gods, are the Maruts, the friends and helpers of Indra. The Kine, are streams of water and the beams of light which follow their effusion. The cave is the thick dark cloud which holds the imprisoned waters and which Indra cleaves asunder with his thunderbolt or lighting.&#8221;</p>
<p>Griffith correctly interpreted it as his translation is based on commentaries of classical Hindu scholars even though some Aryas criticize him for this verse. Indra here refers to the sun and Maruts means wind. Following is the Arya Samaj translation,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.6.5 &#8221;As men carry things and put them in proper places, so the sun scatters his rays with his force and attains (touches) all objects. Then he pierces them and with the winds that break down things, he places them in the middle region.&#8221; Tr Acharya Dharmadev Vidya Martanda (Arya Samaj)</p>

<p>Apadee = without legs</p>
<p>Vardhat = moves ahead</p>
<p>Shushnam Pari = Around the sun</p>
<p>Pradakshinit = revolves</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>First of all this verse isn&#8217;t addressed to Earth, it is addressed to Indra. You can read previous and next verses to understand the context of this verse. This verse is quoted out of context.</p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.22.14 When the earth which has neither hands nor feet flourished through the acts of (devotion paid to) the adorable (deities), You [Indra] slewest, turning to the right, for the welfare of every living man.</p>

<p>The writer distorted the translation as well as the meaning of this verse, it states that the Vedic god Indra after moving around the earth slew his enemies. This verse can also be interpreted as the Sun moves around the earth killing bacteria because Indra is sometime translated as Sun by scholars. The Arya Samaj commentary also doesn&#8217;t state anything like the earth moves ahead it only states that the earth devoid of hands and feet flourished and &#8216;You surrounding the earth forces the cloud to cause rain for the welfare of the people&#8221; readers can check the verses in aryasamajjamnagar.org.</p>
<p><strong>CLAIM: MOON REFLECTS SUN LIGHT</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.85.9 &#8221;Moon decided to marry. Day and Night attended its wedding. And sun gifted his daughter Sun ray to Moon.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>There is no Sanskrit word which can be translated as &#8216;Sun Ray&#8217; here, It says that Savitri gifted Surya to Soma, not sun&#8217;s rays as they have claimed,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.85.9 Soma was desirous of a bride; the two Aswins were the two groomsmen when Savitri gifted Surya, who was ripe for a husband, to Soma (endowed) with intelligence.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="514" height="77" class="wp-image-7786" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-130.png" alt="http://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/060218_0659_testingresp9.png" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-130.png 514w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-130-300x45.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 514px) 100vw, 514px" /></p>
<p>Yaska also writes,</p>
<p>Nirukta 12.8 &#8221;There is a Brahmana passage:Savitr gave Surya in marriage to King Soma, or to Prajapati.&#8221;</p>
<p>As we can see here Yaska also makes no mention about gifting sun &#8216;Rays&#8217; to Moon (Soma). It is mentioned in Aitareya Brahmana,</p>
<p>Aitareya Brahmana book 4, para 7 &#8221;Prajapati gave his daughter Surya Savritri in marriage to the king Soma. All the gods came as paranymphs. Prajapati formed according to the model of a Vahatu, i.e. things (such as turmeric powder, &amp;c. to be carried before the paranymphs)&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>So where does it say that sun gifted its rays to the moon? Moreover going by the writer&#8217;s distorted translation, how can gifting sun Ray be interpreted as &#8220;Reflection&#8221;? Because if you gift something to someone that means that gift will be with the person to whom you have presented it. Many verses of this hymn are about marriage ceremony. It doesn&#8217;t contain any scientific verse although there&#8217;s hardly any science in Vedas.</p>
<p><strong>CLAIM</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.35.9 &#8220;The sun moves in its own orbit but holding earth and other heavenly bodies in a manner that they do not collide with each other through force of attraction.</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>That verse is also mistranslated, The verse actually says the Sun moves around the Earth and Heaven,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.35.9 The golden-handed Savitar [Sun], far-seeing, goes on his way between the earth and heaven, Drives away sickness, bids the Sun approach us, and spreads the bright sky through the darksome region.</p>
<p>Following is the Arya Samaj translation,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.35.9 &#8220;The gold-handed, all-beholding luminary travels between the two regions of heaven and earth, dispels diseases, and this, verily, is known as the sun, and it finally overspreads the sky, extending from the dark interspace to the celestial region&#8221;.

<p>Following is the Arya Samaj translation,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.33.8 &#8221;As the clouds trying to cover the light of the sun and to envelop the earth, can not overcome the sun who is decorated with gold and jewels (so to speaks in the same manner, all should endeavour in such a way that the enemies may not be able to harm the commanders of their armies).&#8221; Tr.

<p><strong>CLAIM </strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.164.13</p>
<p>&#8220;Sun moves in its orbit which itself is moving. Earth and other bodies move around sun due to force of attraction, because sun is heavier than them.</p>
<p><strong>Response</strong></p>
<p>This verse is also mistranslated, The writer is forcefully putting science into his Vedas by mistranslating the verses, He should honestly admit that Vedas are unscientific if he doesn&#8217;t find any scientific verse rather than deceiving innocent people. However here is the correct translation for the verse</p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.164.13 Upon this five-spoked wheel revolving ever all living creatures rest and are dependent. Its axle, heavy-laden, is not heated: the nave from ancient time remains unbroken.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="576" height="99" class="wp-image-7787" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-131.png" alt="http://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/060218_0659_testingresp10.png" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-131.png 576w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-131-300x52.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px" /></p>
<p>This is a simile. According to some scholars the five spokes here denotes five seasons, Sayana Acharya has explained the wheel as the year and the five spokes as five seasons. Yaska also writes,</p>
<p>Nirukta 4.27 &#8220;When the five-spoked wheel began to roll. This is with reference to the five seasons. There is a Brahmana passage: There are five seasons in the year, taking the winter and the dewy season together.&#8221;</p>
<p>While according to other scholars (of Arya Samaj) the wheel is of time and the &#8216;Five&#8217; denotes the five elements of nature, here is the Arya Samaj translation,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.164.13 &#8221;All space planets and Panchabhootas abide in this five-spoked (the five spokes are the five elements) revolving wheel of Time. It&#8217;s heavily loaded axle is never heated. The Time is heavily laden (so to speak) and has God as a support (axle) and it has no wear and tear.&#8221; Tr. Acharya Dharmadev Vidya Martanda</p>

<p>Some Hindus (Arya Samajis) say that Dayanand Saraswati foresaw  airplane even before the Wright brothers invented it. This is wrong because Glider was built many centuries before the birth of Dayanand, there is lot of similarity between a glider and airplane and considering the fact wright brothers modified the glider into an airplane. The Glider dates back to 9<sup>th</sup> century which was flown by Abbas Ibn Firnas and in 1804 another innovator named George Cayle had built several models of glider. So it is incorrect to say Dayanand had foreseen the airplane as gliders were already present. Talking about the scientific knowledge Dayanand possessed, it is mentioned in his book Satyarth Prakash Chapter no 8 that Human being exists on Sun, Moon and other planets.</p>
<p>&#8221;39. What are the sun, the moon and the stars?</p>
<p>Q. Are they inhabited by man and other living creatures or not?</p>
<p>A. They are the worlds inhabited by men and other living beings&#8230;&#8221;- Satyarth Prakash, Swami Dayanand Saraswati, Ch 8, p.271, Tr. Chiranjiva Bhardwaja.</p>
<p>He also wrote that sky looks blue in color because it has water particles, and that the atmosphere has particles of earth and fire (Agni),</p>
<p>&#8221;6. Is it not ether, then, that you see in the sky above, blue and dusty? A.- No. 1.</p>
<p>What is it then?</p>
<p>A. It is the fine particles of earth, Water and Agni (in the atmosphere). The blue colour is  mainly due to the particles of water in the atmosphere that come down as rain, while the dusty appearance is due to the particles of dust which is carried up from the earth and floats about the air. It is these things that are seen and reflected in water in a mirror, and not ether.&#8221;- Satyarth Prakash, Swami Dayanand Saraswati, Ch 8, p.276, Tr. Chiranjiva Bhardwaja.</p>
<p><strong>CLAIM:</strong></p>
<p>Athara-veda 20.100.3 is astounding, it says, <strong>air is the carrier of words (sound), </strong>and we know, this is scientifically proven that sound needs medium to travel, it couldn&#8217;t travel in vacuum.  By this, it is so clear that Hindu sages knew about air particles which acts as carrier (medium) of sound. Even Rigveda 8.91.5 &amp; 1.143.5 says similar.</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>From where is he deriving all these meanings? If Vedic deities Maruts speaking means air is the carrier of words then does that mean air carries up the heaven and earth?</p>

<p>Rig Veda 3.9.1 &#8220;We as your mortal friends choose you, the divine, for our protection. You are imperishable life force auspicious, resplendent, the best guide and sinless and such take us across the miseries.&#8221; Tr. Svami Satya Prakash Saraswati</p>
<p>None of them say anything like the writer claims, it&#8217;s the distortion of the translation made by the translator. And I am only commenting on the translation.</p>
<p><strong>CLAIM:</strong></p>
<p>Doctors suggest us to drink more water in order to prevent &amp; cure heart diseases, the same solution is described in Athara-veda 6.24.1</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>This is talking about a specific waters that flows from hills of snow and meet in Sindhu. Doctors recommends drinking adequate amount of water for better health but which scientific research proves that water can <strong>cure</strong> heart disease, ruptures in eye, heels and toes? If water could cure heart disease then why do we need medicines, why don&#8217;t doctors just provide a bottle of water to the patient?</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 6.24.1-3 &#8220;Forth from the Hills of Snow they stream, and meet in Sindhu here or there. To me the sacred Waters gave the balm that heals the heart&#8217;s disease. Whatever rupture I have had that injured eyes or heels or toes. All this the Waters, skilfullest physicians, shall make well again, All Rivers who have Sindhu for your Lady, Sindhu for your Queen, Give us the balm that heals this ill: this boon let us enjoy from you.&#8221; Tr. Ralph. T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>Arya Samaj translation,<br />
Atharva Veda 6.24.1-3 &#8220;The currents of water stream from hills covered with snow and meet in the river or sea together. These pure waters certainly provide me with the medicine curing the pain of heart. These waters are most skilful physician amongst physician or most powerful medicine of all medicines. Let them remove all the rapture which injures my eyes, which injures my heels and which injures my toes. Let all the rivers which maintain the continuity of their flow always, which are in spate with mighty flow provide us with the balm that heals the ill and may we enjoy this boon from them.&#8221; Tr. Acharya Vaidyanath Shastri</p>
<p><strong>CLAIM:</strong></p>
<p>Ait Upnishad 1.1.4 says, In embryo, 1st mouth is formed then nostrils then eyes then ears then heart then umbilical cord then genetic organs. This order of development is as-it-is accepted by Modern Science.</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>First let me provide the English translation,</p>
<p>Aitareya Upanishad 1.1.4 &#8220;He brooded over Him. From Him, so brooded over, the mouth was separated out, as with an egg; form the month, the organ of speech; from speech, fire, the controlling deity of the organ. Then the nostrils were separated out; from the nostrils, the organ of breath; from breath, air, the controlling deity of the organ. Then the eyes were separated out; from the eyes, the organ of sight; from sight, the sun, the controlling deity of the organ. Then the ears were separated out; from the ears, the organ of hearing; from hearing, the quarters of space, the controlling deity of the organ. Then the skin was separated out; from the skin, hairs, the organ of touch; from the hairs, plants and trees, air the controlling deity of the organs. Then the heart was separated out; from the heart, the organ of the mind; from the mind, the moon, the controlling deity of the organ. Then the navel was separated out; from the navel, the organ of the apana; from the apana, Death, Varuna, the controlling deity of the organ. Then the virile member was separated out; from the virile member, semen, the organ of generation; from the semen, the waters, the controlling deity of the organ.&#8221;</p>
<p>The writer said that, &#8220;1st mouth is formed then nostrils then eyes then ears then heart&#8221; whereas the heart starts developing earlier than eyes and ears,</p>
<p>Week 5 &#8220;Your baby&#8217;s heart and a primitive circulatory system will form in the middle layer of cells — the mesoderm.&#8221;<br />

<p><strong>CLAIM:</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda (1.50.11) says that <strong>Sun Rays ends several diseases of body </strong>which is no more a hidden truth. We know people of European continent or those places where sun light is not as sufficient as in India (south Asia) they go for beach and spend their time so that their body can absorb enough Heat in required manner.</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a prayer made to the sun to remove diseases, it asks the sun to remove heart disease and paleness of the skin. Do any scientific research proves that the sun rays directly cures heart diseases?</p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.50.11 &#8220;Radiant with benevolent light, rising to day and mounting into the highest heaven, do thou, O Sun, remove the sickness of my heart, and the yellowness (of my body).&#8221; Tr. H.H. Wilson<br />

<p><strong>CLAIM:</strong></p>
<p>If we study Rig Veda (1.56.2), it clarifies that ancient Hindus knew about the knowledge of <strong>several jewels and treasures hidden inside sea</strong>, since long ago. Interesting point is how those sages went deep inside sea without any suit equipped with oxygen?</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>What is so &#8220;Scientific&#8221; about this? Where does it say that Rishis used to jump in sea and ocean to look for the treasure? It only talks about people thronging at seas for treasure hunting which means that marine treasure hunting existed during the time Vedas were composed, and how come this is included in Science by Hinduism article? People used to do Marine treasure Hunting in medieval period also, here is the passage taken from Wikipedia,</p>
<p>In 1643 Captain William Phips salvaged one of the sunken Spanish treasure ships forty-four years after they were wrecked on Silver Shoals. At the time, the salvages wreck was worth twelve millions dollars.[1] The Nuestra Señora de Atocha left Havana bound for Spain in 1622 and sank. Mel Fisher and his crew spent sixteen years searching for the treasure that was aboard the Nuestra Señora de Atocha. Three silver bars were found in 1973, five bronze cannons were found in 1975, and in 1980 a wooden hull weighted down by ballast stones, iron cannon balls and artifacts of 17th century Spain were found.[2] The S.S. Central America sank after running into a hurricane off the Carolina coast in 1857. In 1987 Thomas G. Thompson discovered the ship&#8217;s location. A remotely operated vehicle surfaced more than forty million dollars in gold from the sunken ship.[3] In 1782 the British Frigate Grosvenor sank in Natal Bay, East Africa, carrying treasure cargo of 2,000 silver ingots, 720 gold ingots, and jewels including the fabulous &#8220;golden peacocks&#8221; from the throne of the Great Mogul, at Delhi, India.<br />

<p><strong>CLAIM:</strong></p>
<p>Vishnu Puran  2.8.12-15 &amp; Aitareya Brahmana 2.7 says, <strong>Sun neither rises nor sets </strong>People call it &#8216;Sunrise&#8217; &amp; &#8216;Sunset&#8217; by seeing position of Sun at Morning &amp; evening.</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s read entire chapter first,</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 2.8 &#8220;…The glorious sun, Maitreya, darts like an arrow on his southern course, attended by the constellations of the Zodiac…When the sun (at midday) passes over either of the cities of the gods, on the Mánasottara mountain (at the cardinal points), his light extends to three cities and two intermediate points…From the period of his rise the sun moves with increasing rays until noon, when he proceeds towards his setting with rays diminishing…When the sun has travelled in the centre of Pushkara a thirtieth part of the circumference of the globe, his course is equal in time to one Muhúrtta; and whirling round like the circumference of the wheel of a potter, he distributes day and night upon the earth…After he has passed through these, the sun attains his equinoctial movement (the vernal equinox), when he makes the day and night of equal duration…As the circumference of a potter&#8217;s wheel revolves most rapidly, so the sun travels rapidly on his southern journey: he flies along his path with the velocity of wind, and traverses a great distance in a short time. In twelve Muhúrttas he passes through thirteen lunar asterisms and a half during the day; and during the night he passes through the same distance, only in eighteen Muhúrttas. As the centre of the potter&#8217;s wheel revolves more slowly than the circumference, so the sun in his northern path again revolves with less rapidity, and moves over a less space of the earth in a longer time, until, at the end of his northern route, the day is again eighteen Muhúrttas, and the night twelve; the sun passing through half the lunar mansions by day and by night in those periods respectively…&#8221;</p>
<p>These verses are clear about the Sun revolving around the Earth. Aren&#8217;t they? This is either a contradiction or the verse quoted by apologist is trying to clarify that the sun always exists and doesn&#8217;t disappear. I can say for sure that according to Hinduism the sun moves around the earth, apart from posting the same verse repeated in different scriptures the apologist cannot quote other verses about sun neither setting nor rising, while I can quote dozens of verses about sun revolving around the earth and the sun going here and there. The same chapter itself describes the movements of sun especially the sun revolving around the earth. Then he quotes Aitareya Brahmana which says the same, but do he know that Aitareya Brahmana says that Sun dips in water,</p>
<p>Aitareya Brahma Book 4, Chapter 20, verse 13 &#8220;&#8230;This (Aditya, the sun) is &#8216;the swan sitting in light&#8217;&#8230;he is &#8216;born from the waters&#8217; (abja), for in the morning he comes out of the waters, and in the evening he enters the waters.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>CLAIM:</strong></p>
<p>The discovery of water on Moon has been done very recently (that too was done by an Indian craft called &#8216;Chandrayaan&#8217;) but Viṣṇu Purāṇa 2.9.10 described it long ago. It talks about Water on moon&#8217;s surface &amp; role played by sun.</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>First let&#8217;s read the verse,</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana Book 2, Chapter 9 &#8220;During eight months of the year the sun attracts the waters, which are the essence of all fluids, and then pours them upon earths (during the other four months) as rain: from rain grows corn; and by corn the whole world subsists. The sun with his scorching rays absorbs the moisture of the earth, and with them nourishes the moon. The moon communicates, through tubes of air, its dews to the clouds, which, being composed of smoke, fire, and wind (or vapour), can retain the waters with which they are charged: they are therefore called Abhras, because their contents are not dispersed. When however they are broken to pieces by the wind, then watery stores descend, bland, and freed front every impurity by the sweetening process of time.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is not a scientific fact but scientific error mentioned in Vishnu Purana which says that water is transferred to the moon which then pours down to clouds and responsible for causing rain. For more information read my article <a href="/index.php/2019/03/29/scientific-errors-in-hinduism/" data-wpel-link="internal">Scientific Errors in Hinduism</a>. Following is the same verse repeated in Vayu Purana in much simpler language,</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.51.14-15 &#8220;The water drunk in by the sun gets transferred to the moon from the solar fire. Through the Nadis (tubular veins) full of wind the activity of sustaining the worlds begins. What exudes from the moon, the sun receives at its tips. When the wind blows the clouds let it shower on the earth.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare, Edited by G.P Bhatt</p>
<p><strong>CLAIM:</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 8.18.9 says that let the air be free of diseases. The noteworthy point is, those noble sages knew that even air contains diseases. In medical terms,  we call it &#8216;airborne diseases&#8217; which transmits through air.</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>The verse only prays for the wind to blow sweet and fragrant smell and drive away the enemies,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 8.18.9 &#8220;May Agni with his fires grant us happiness: may the sun beam upon us felicity: may the unoffending wind blow us happiness: (may they all drive) away our foes.&#8221; Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Rig Veda 8.18.9 &#8220;May Agni bless us with his fires, and Sūrya warm us pleasantly: May the pure Wind breathe sweet on us, and chase our foes.&#8221; Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>

<p><strong>RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>This is not a scientific fact but an error. Earth in Puranas is a flat circular disc with mount Meru in the middle and 7 islands or continents surrounding it which are separated from each other by seven oceans. You will understand it better if you read following two verses from Puranas,</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 2.2 &#8220;PARÁŚARA.–You shall hear, Maitreya, a brief account of the earth from me: a full detail I could not give you in a century. The seven great insular continents are Jambu, Plaksha, Sálmali, Kuśa, Krauncha, Śáka, and Pushkara: and they are surrounded severally by seven great seas; the sea of salt water (Lavańa), of sugar-cane juice (Ikshu), of wine (Surá), of clarified butter (Sarpi), of curds (Dadhi), of milk (Dugdha), and of fresh water (Jala). Jambu-dwípa is in the centre of all these: and in the centre of this continent is the golden mountain Meru…The capital of Brahma is enclosed by the river Ganges, which, issuing from the foot of Vishńu, and washing the lunar orb, falls here from the skies…&#8221;</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana I.2.21.13-16 &#8220;&#8230;The extent of the earth towards all the sides (quarters) from the middle of the Meru is remembered as one crore and eightynine lakhs (of Yojanas)&#8230;&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>

<p><strong>CLAIM:</strong></p>
<p>Now, something very big and nearly perfect. If we read Hanuman Chalisa (A small holy Scripture which consists only 40 verses) we get the <strong>distance between Earth and Sun</strong>. This is one of the most scientific facts you can attain.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="300" height="123" class="wp-image-7795" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2013-12-0602-1.png" alt="https://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/060218_0659_testingresp18.png?w=300" /></p>
<h3>RESPONSE:</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s ironic that now the writer is using 1 Yojana = 8 miles unit while denied knowing the exact measurement of 1 Yojana in another article. Hanuman Chalisa was written in 16<sup>th</sup> century, Puranas which are older than this has given completely different distance between earth and sun. For more information read my article <a href="/index.php/2019/03/29/scientific-errors-in-hinduism/" data-wpel-link="internal">Scientific Errors In Hinduism</a>. There are four Yugas in Hinduism, Satya, Treta, Dvapara and Kali. Each Yuga has different measurement like 4,800 Divine years (or 1,728,000 human years) of Satya Yuga, 3,600 divine years (or 1,296,000 human years) of Treta Yuga, 2,400 divine years (or 864,000 human years) of Dvapara Yuga and 1,200 divine years (or 432,000 human years) of Kali Yuga and this is as per Vishnu Purana book 1 chapter 3. Now even the divine years of Kali Yuga is just 1,200 years while the number given above is 12000 and Kali Yuga is 432,000 of human years. Swami Prabhupada writes,</p>
<p>&#8220;As aforementioned, one year of the demigods is equal to 360 years of the human beings. The duration of the Satya-yuga is therefore 4,800 × 360, or 1,728,000 years. The duration of the Tretā-yuga is 3,600 × 360, or 1,296,000 years. The duration of the Dvāpara-yuga is 2,400 × 360, or 864,000 years. And the last, the Kali-yuga, is 1,200 × 360, or 432,000 years.&#8221; <strong>Swami Prabhupada on Srimad Bhagavatam 3.11.19</strong><br />

<p>Hindu writers should provide details about the units they are mentioning. It&#8217;s ironic that Hindus are relying on this Hanuman Chalisa but turns blind eye to numerous Puranas which clearly gives wrong distance between planets.</p>
<p><strong>CLAIM:</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda (1.116.15) surprised me a lot. It is about <strong>surgery</strong>. It describes an instance where a woman who was fighting war got injured and then Ashwin brothers gave her leg of irons. This is the same method used by doctors in modern time.</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>Wilson wrote &#8220;It is only added, in the notes, that Khela was a king, of whom Agastya was the purohita; and it was through his prayers that the Aswins gave Vispala an iron leg.&#8221;</p>
<p>Svami Satya Prakash Sarasvati wrote, &#8220;According to legend, Khila was a king, of whom Agastya was a purohita, and it was through his prayers, that the Asvins gave Vispala an iron leg.</p>
<p>So which surgery restores a leg with prayers? Rig Veda 1.116.12; Satapatha Brahmana 14.1.1.20-25; Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 2.5.16-17 and Devi Bhagavatam 7.36.28 says that Asvins put a horse&#8217;s head on Muni Dadhyam&#8217;s body. Which science proves fixing animal&#8217;s head on human body?</p>
<p><strong>CLAIM:</strong></p>
<p>Rigved 1.108.1 talks about such planes (रथः- विमान) through which sages could travel to other planets (भुवनानि).</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>If such interplanetary planes existed, then where did Hindus loose the technology? And also it is about Indra and Agni not about sages.</p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.108.1 &#8220;Indra and Agni, sitting together, in your car, that wonderful car which illuminates all beings, approach, and drink of the effused Soma juice.&#8221; Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.108.1 &#8220;O resplendent self and supreme mind, sitting in this chariot of your body, you perceive all the worlds. May both of you come seated in this chariot and enjoy the essence extracted from the environments.&#8221; Tr. Svami Satya Prakash Sarasvati</p>
<p>Vedas also talks about Sun moving in a chariot, the writer may claim that it was also some sort of plane.</p>
<p><strong>CLAIM:</strong></p>
<p>If we read Rig Veda (1.127.3), we come to know that the<strong> idea of EXPLOSION (with help of heat) </strong>was invented and used long before in Vedic Periods.</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>Some Hindus also claimed that Rishis invented nuclear bombs thousands of years ago. Such things has no basis. And if you read the verse you will see that there is no explosion mentioned in the verse rather it talks about Vedic deity Agni killing his enemies,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.127.3 &#8220;Verily, that Agni, far shining with brilliant vigour, is the destroyer of foes, like a hatchet that cuts down trees: whatever is most solid and stable dissolves like water at his contact: unsparing, he sports (amidst enemies), nor desists (from their destruction), like an archer who retreats not (from battle).&#8221; Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.127.3 &#8220;Verily, that fire-divine, shining far with brilliant vigour, is the destroyer of foes. He like a hatchet cuts down trees. What is not solid and stable melts like water at his touch. Vanquishing the enemies, He stands firm and, like an archer, does not retreat.&#8221; Tr. Svami Satya Prakash Saraswati</p>
<p><strong>CLAIM:</strong></p>
<p>When we study Rig Veda (1.27.6), we come to know that Vedic sages knew something even about <strong>Water Particles</strong> (well, it&#8217;s surprising that sages even knew about those water particles which couldn&#8217;t be seen without help of Microscope).</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s not about particles but about waves,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.27.6 &#8220;Thou, Chitrabhanu, art the distributor of riches; as the waves of a river are parted by interjacent (islets). Thou ever pourest (rewards) upon the giver (of oblations).&#8221; Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.27.6 &#8220;You are the possessor of wonderful radiance. You are the dispenser of blessings like the waves of a river, parted by interjacent (islets) and you generously shower your blessings on the person who completely surrenders to you.&#8221; Tr. Svami Satya Prakash Sarasvati</p>

<p><strong>CLAIM:</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda (4.6.5) suggest us that <strong>invention of Injection</strong> was already done in Vedic era. It even suggests that people knew how to cure toxic injected in body.</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>First of all the reference is wrong, it is Atharva Veda not Rig Veda,</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 4.6.5 &#8220;I, the physician make poison ineffectual with the use of the leaf and the plaster of the Parnadhi, the medicinal plant (known as Lodhra). I remove the effect of poison by the herb Shring (known as Ajashringi) brought away from the distant place and I make the poison ineffectual by the use of Kulmala, a herb of this name.&#8221; Tr. Acharya Vaidyanath Shastri</p>
<p>Nowhere it talks about injections, if you read previous and next verses you will know that it is about a poisonous arrow.</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 4.6.6 &#8220;Let the end of the arrows be poison les, let the poison itself lose its poisonous effect, let bow made of the poison less tree, belonging to you, O man be free from the effect of poison.&#8221; Tr. Acharya Vaidyanath Shastri</p>
<p><strong>CLAIM:</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 2.15.2 is noteworthy, it says, <strong>Universe is expanding. </strong>I think, if one don&#8217;t consider Vedas as Sacred then he/she must contemplative that how this tremendous knowledge of astronomy could be attained by anyone at that time when half of the world was not even civilised?</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>Nowhere it says that the universe is expanding,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 2.15.2 &#8220;Who fixed the heaven in unsupported (space), and filled the spacious firmament, and heaven, and earth, (with light): he it is who has upheld and has made the earth renowed: in the exhilaration of the Soma, Indra has done these (deeds).&#8221; Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Rig Veda 2.15.2 &#8220;He establishes heaven in the supportless space. With His power, He fills the inter-space, heaven and earth (with His light). He has upheld and extended the wide earth. All this He does in the ecstasy of His benign bliss.&#8221; Tr. Svami Satya Prakash Sarasvati</p>

<p><strong>CLAIM:</strong></p>
<p>This is great to know that people (only of Indus civilisation) used <strong>to stop river flow to use it for their own purpose/convenience</strong> like we do it today by <strong>constructing Dam</strong>. Rig Veda (3.53.9) clearly indicates toward that.</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>Does it say that they built dams to regulate rivers? This verse is talking about Vishwamitra controlling rivers, other verses shows that he stopped rivers just by his command and since the writer included this in Science by Hinduism I would like to know how scientific is it? Following verses are from different Sukta about Vishwamitra stopping rivers just by his command,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 3.33.5 &#8220;[The sage speaks] I, the disciple of an enlightened teacher, having acquired necessary knowledge, now desirous of protection, solicit your favour and address with earnest prayer to you the rivers before me. O rivers, charged with water, rest a moment from your course at my request.&#8221; Tr. SatyaPrakash Saraswati</p>
<p>Nirukta 2.24 &#8220;The seer Visvamitra was the domestic priest of Sudas, the son of Pijavana. Visva-mitra, friend of all…He, i.e. Visvamitra, implored the rivers to become fordable. (He addressed them) in the dual as well as in the plural number.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>CLAIM:</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda (6.57.4) has revealed that <strong>rainwater</strong> <strong>contains several nutritious elements</strong> in it long before than modern science.</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>Nowhere it says that rainwater contains nutritious elements,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 6.57.4 &#8220;When showerer of Indra sends down the falling and mighty waters, there is Pushan along with him.&#8221; Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Rig Veda 6.57.4 &#8220;When the showerer, the resplendent sun of the northern solstice, sends down the streams and might water-floods, the divine nourishing sun also joins with him.&#8221; Tr. Svami Satya Prakash Sarasvati</p>

<p><strong>CLAIM:</strong></p>
<p>Rigveda 1.19.8 says that Maruts<strong> (Winds) agitate the ocean. </strong>This is scientifically accurate. We know, wind plays most crucial role in moving ocean current.</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>One doesn&#8217;t need to be a rocket scientist to understand such simple phenomenon. Moreover this is mainly addressed to Agni so writer must prove that Fire along with Wind are responsible for moving ocean current.</p>
<p><strong>CLAIM:</strong></p>
<p>Rigved 1.164.11 is one of my favourite and most surprising. It has much science stored in it. First, it tell us that <strong>Sun has one orbit.</strong> Next, to design a calender has been most tough task for any civilization. One of the perfect calender was designed by great Hindu Mathematician Aryabhata. But long before Aryabhata, the Vedas have revealed the correct division of time with respect to Sun (Solar Calendar). The verse further says that the <strong>sun wheel has 12 spokes (which is 12 months) and 720 sons (360 days + 360 nights) which is approximately a year.</strong></p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>The writer may be even more surprised to know that Hinduism says the sun moves around the earth. I know that calendar is very old but where did he get this idea of 720 sons means 360 days + 360 nights? Why it can&#8217;t be like 720 days? Following passage is taken from Wikipedia,</p>

<p><strong>CLAIM:</strong></p>
<p>Bhagvat Puran (3.11.1) discovers the atom and also defines it accurately. In modern history J.J Thomson is being credited for <strong>discovery of Atoms</strong> but they were Hindus who actually discovered it first.</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>The word Atom was coined by the Greeks and this was discovered thousands of years ago, refer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomism" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomism<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>While Brahma Sutra II.2.12-17 do not subscribe to the atomic theory of the Vaisesikas.</p>
<p><strong>CLAIM:</strong></p>
<p>Bhagvat Puran (3.6.1-7) is absolutely knowledgeable. It talks about the creation of a baby, it even mention the number <strong>23 chromosomes</strong>from each (sperm and egg).  Now it&#8217;s truly amazing that Hindus century ago knew about this biological process.</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>Does it really talk about 23 chromosomes? No! Rather it says that,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 3.6.2 &#8220;Having seen the state of his existing potencies that they were disparate and that their power of creating the universe lay dormant, the Supreme Lord of miraculous deeds bearing with him divine power called time (which has no separate existence from him) entered simultaneously the group of twenty-three principles (viz. mahat+egohood+5 subtle elements+5 gross elements+ 10 organs of senses both conative and cognitive+mind).&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Swami Prabhupada writes,<br />
&#8220;The ingredients of matter are counted as twenty-three: the total material energy, false ego, sound, touch, form, taste, smell, earth, water, fire, air, sky, eye, ear, nose, tongue, skin, hand, leg, evacuating organ, genitals, speech and mind. All are combined together by the influence of time and are again dissolved in the course of time…&#8221; <strong>Swami Prabhupada on Srimad Bhagavatam 3.6.2</strong><br />
<a href="https://www.vedabase.com/en/sb/3/6/2" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">https://www.vedabase.com/en/sb/3/6/2<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>Do our chromosome contains earth, water, fire, air, sky? If you read all six verses you will know that it no where talks about creation of a baby.</p>
<p><strong>CLAIM:</strong></p>
<p>The Bhagvat Puran (3.26.55) reveals that our <strong>ears are responsible for recognizing the directions</strong>. This is proved by modern science after 1935. So, with this we can even conclude that our sages were more advanced than what we are today.</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>The writer should provide links for his claims, he can&#8217;t just say that scientists have discovered it that&#8217;s it. Bhagavata Purana 3.26.55 is about the Supreme God taking birth from a egg who is thus called self-born and the verse says that he got sense of hearing from where came the presiding deities of directions.</p>
<p><strong>CLAIM:</strong></p>
<p>Atharva Veda 10.1.26 reveals that sages not only about <strong>Treasure but also knew about several Mineral Substance which are found deep underground.</strong></p>
<p>Now we must notice that even at that time Hindus have methods for deep mining (Because these things are found deep in Earth). And not only that but they also had great knowledge of Mineral Substance (Treasure could be seen with naked eyes but not Minerals, so it means they had knowledge of Mineral substance).</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>First of all the, either the translation or reference number is wrong, following is the Hindi translation of Atharva Veda 10.1.26 by Shri Ram Sharma,</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="602" height="130" class="wp-image-7799" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-141.png" alt="http://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/060218_0659_testingresp22.png" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-141.png 602w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-141-300x65.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></p>
<p>Atharva Veda 10.1.26 &#8220;Let this device go, let it not stay, let it pursue the makers foot as the hunter pursues the track of wounded animal prey. The enemy is the prey and this device is hunter, the prey can not humble the hunter.&#8221; Tr. Acharya Vaidyanath Shastri</p>
<p>If you read verses 18-19 you will know that it is talking about a spell,</p>
<p>Knowing about treasure under the ground is nothing surprising as people in ancient period buried their valuables under the ground.</p>
<p><strong>CLAIM:</strong></p>
<p>Atharva Veda 21.6.4 described the concept of <strong>&#8216;multi universe</strong>&#8216; long ago which is accept by Science.</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>Has he printed a new version of Atharva Veda or what? There is no 21<sup>st</sup> Kaanda in Atharva Veda there are only total number of 20 Kaandas in Atharva Veda.</p>
<p><strong>CLAIM:</strong></p>
<p>Yajurveda 3.6 &amp; Markandey Puran 78.9 clearly describes <strong>Earth shape as Spherical (like egg)  and says that it moves (turns) around Sun. </strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="300" height="195" class="wp-image-7800" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2013-12-0602-2.png" alt="https://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/060218_0659_testingresp23.png?w=300" /></p>

<p>In Yajurveda 3.6, the word used for  &#8216;Earth&#8217; is &#8216;गौ&#8217; &amp; the word used for &#8216;Sun&#8217; is &#8216;स्वरिति&#8217;, in case of confusion, readers may also refer to Satapatha Brahmana  (which is an explanation of Vedas) 2.1.4.29 where similar words are used to denote Earth &amp; Sun. Moreover, Nighantu 1.1 clearly described that &#8216;गौ&#8217; refers to &#8216;Earth&#8217; &amp; Nirukta 2.14 describes that &#8216;स्वर&#8217; refers to &#8216;Sun&#8217;.</p>
<p>Not only Hindus knew that Earth is spherical, but they even knew that Earth is not perfectly spherical. We know, the <strong>North Pole &amp; South Pole are quite flattened. </strong>This is exactly what Markandey Puran 54.12 says:</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>The Hindi translation of Arya Samaj he mentioned translated Gau as spherical earth. The earth is sometimes referred as Gau in Vedas but from where did they derive the definition &#8220;Spherical earth&#8221; from Gau? Even the writer failed to furnish any reference proving that Gau means spherical earth. Hindi translation by Shri Ram Sharma Acharya doesn&#8217;t state anything like moving earth or spherical earth,</p>

<p>Hindi translation by Swami Karpatri Maharaj also doesn&#8217;t say anything like that,</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="602" height="141" class="wp-image-7803" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-143.png" alt="http://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/060218_0659_testingresp26.png" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-143.png 602w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-143-300x70.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></p>
<p>Do he accept that the sun is revolving around the earth as the Markandeya 78.9 verse he quoted says that the Sun revolves above the world? Coming to the point, the egg described here is the source of creation and here referring to the universe and not describing the shape of the earth as egg, read the Hindi translation below,</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="516" height="393" class="wp-image-7804" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-144.png" alt="http://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/060218_0659_testingresp27.png" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-144.png 516w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-144-300x228.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 516px) 100vw, 516px" /></p>
<p>You will understand it better if you read the following verse from Markandeya Purana,</p>
<p>Markandeya Purana 46.1-2 &#8220;Adorable Sir! thou hast related to me correctly the genesis of the egg, and thou hast told me of the birth of the mighty Soul Brahma within the egg of Brahma&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Where does Markandeya Purana 58.12 says that earth is not perfectly spherical? He himself quoted the verse which only says that it is highly elevated in the middle. Does that prove that earth is oblate shaped? The irony is that if Purana says the earth is shaped like lotus, leaf of lotus then it doesn&#8217;t really describe the shape of earth but the Markandeya verse which talks about creation egg is describing the shape of earth, Oxford Press should invent a new word for this high level of hypocrisy.</p>
<p>Some also quote Rig Veda 3.5.5 to show that earth is moving as per the Vedas which is not true. There is no word which can be translated as moving hence Pandit Ram Govind Trivedi and Shri Ram Sharma Acharya has not translated it anything like that, following is the Hindi translation of Rig Veda 3.5.5 by Pandit Ram Govind Trivedi,<br />
