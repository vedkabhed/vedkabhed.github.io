										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>SCIENTIFIC ERRORS IN HINDUISM</strong></p>
<p>Written by Sulaiman Razvi</p>
<p>The Hindus claim that they were so scientifically advanced that everything was made by them. Later on the knowledge was either destroyed by Muhgals or the white people copied their ideas. As soon as something is discovered they claim that it was already mentioned in Hindu scriptures. Ironically such advanced people’s research is now limited in finding medicinal values of Cow Urine and Dung. They invented everything except for pen to note down their inventions. I will be mentioning some verses from my article <a href="http://vedkabhed.com/index.php/2014/05/14/scientific-errors-in-vedas-part-i/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Scientific Errors In Vedas<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> but without the Hindi translation as it makes the article very lengthy. This article deals with various scientific errors in Hindu scriptures including the Vedas. And I have written this according to my capability, if a scholar writes about scientific errors in Hinduism then he may find even more errors than I did. It is ridiculous to claim that Hinduism is a scientific religion, this article proves that the Rishis wrote down science of their period which is irrelevant to modern science. Some verses even start with “Scientists says” which suggests that science in Puranas was plagiarized from scientists of that time.</p>
<p>Scientific knowledge in Hindu scriptures is highly objectionable, Atharved 2.32.3 has chant to destroy pests, Atharva Veda 5.23.5 has chant to destroy worms, this is the scientific knowledge imparted by the Vedas. It is mentioned in Vishnu Purana book 5, chapter 11 that Indra was offended by the loss of his offerings, so he caused heavy rain to deluge Gokul, then Krishna held the mountain Govardhana to shelter the cowherds and their cattle. Although this can be dismissed as a miracle but the following scientific errors can’t be dismissed with the said excuse.</p>

<h1>Mountains had Wings</h1>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-6596" title="Vedic Science" src="http://vedkabhed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/word-image-2-300x220.jpeg" alt="Vedic Science" width="568" height="417" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/word-image-2-300x220.jpeg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/07/word-image-2-1024x751.jpeg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/07/word-image-2-768x563.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 568px) 100vw, 568px" /></p>
<p>Hinduism says that mountains had wings and used to fly and then Indra cut off their wings, the reason why Indra did this varies according to different Puranas, some say that their wings were becoming too large so Indra cut them off and then they became clouds, some says that Gods feared flying mountains would fall to the ground and kill</p>
<p>people so for this reason Indra cut off their wings. Mainak mountain was saved as he took shelter in Vayu Devta.</p>
<p>Valmiki Ramayana 5.1.123-5 “O son! Earlier in the Krita yuga, mountains had wings. With speed equal to that of Garuda and Vayu, they went in all directions. After that when those mountains were thus flying freely, Devas and living creatures together with sages obtained fear in the doubt that those mountains might fall down. Then the angry Devendra who performed a hundred Asvamedha rituals, cut off the wings of thousands of mountains by his weapon vajra then and there.” Tr. K.M.K Murthy</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 8.11.34 “Indra thought: Formerly, when many mountains flying in the sky with wings would fall to the ground and kill people, I cut their wings with this same thunderbolt.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 125.10-17 “…The clouds Puskarabartaka have been born from the wings (of the mountains). These wings are named Puskara and hold a huge volume of water hence these clouds are known as Puskaravarta. The valiant Indra cut down the wings of the mountains that used to fly at their will and cause ruin and destruction to the rising generation (of the universe)…” Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, Edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>Linga Purana I.54.46-48 “…The origin of the third type of clouds is from the wings of mountains chopped off by Indra.” Tr. Board of Scholars, Edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana I.2.22.41 “The wings of very powerful mountains that had increased in size and who used to go wherever as they pleased, were chopped off by Indra who wished to secure the welfare of all living beings.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Harivamsa Purana 3.40.19 “Knowing that the mountains are responsible for lack of firmness (immobility) of earth, the destroyer of strongholds (Indra), the lord, after installing the mountains at their own places, cut off their wings with his weapon, the hundred jointed (edged shataparva) Vajra.”</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.51.38 “The wings of the powerful mountains who could go as per their will and pleasure, had grown very large. Indra cut them off for the (welfare of all) living beings.” Tr. G.V. Tagare, Edited by G.P Bhatt</p>
<p>H.H. Wilson writes in the footnoes of the verse Rig Veda 2.12.2,<br />
“Yah parvatan prakupitan aramnat; the Scholiast says he quieted the mountains, going hither and thither, as long as they had wings: Indra cut them off.”</p>
<p>Swami Prabhupada also wrote,<br />
“In many descriptions in Vedic literature it is found that mountains also fly in the sky with wings. When such mountains are dead, they fall to the ground, where they stay as very large dead bodies.” <strong>Swami Prabhupada on Srimad Bhagavatam 8.11.12 </strong><br />

<p>According to Hinduism a woman conceives child after the semen mixes with her menstrual blood,</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 39.10 ”The menstrual flow of a woman suddenly develops conception as soon as it mingles itself with the semen virile of man, through the sap of the flowers of herbs.” Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, Edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>Varaha Purana 125.14 ”The generative fluid is in the female and the semen is in the male. In the womb they combine to form a being. This is due to my Maya.” Tr. Vekitasubramonia Iyer, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Following are the embryological developments mentioned in Hindu scriptures,</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana 2.3.72.42-47 “…Blood takes its origin from Rasa (a vital fluid constituent of the body) and it is said that the flesh originates from blood. The source of fat is from the flesh. It is defined that the bone originates from the fat. From the bone the pith and marrow take their origin and the origin of Semen is from the marrow. (?) Foetus originated from semen virile through its assimilative rasa bodily fluid. It is there that water is mixed initially (?). This is called the Saumya Rasi. The foetus that is solidified [lit. born of Asman, stone solid] is called the second Rasi. One should know that semen is of the nature of Soma and Menstrual blood is of the nature of fire. These two Evolutes follow Rasa…” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.14.17-22 “Then, at the time of conception, Kalana, the embryo at its first stage (in the form of a drop) is formed. In due course the Kalana develops into bubbles. Just as a lump of clay pressed by the wind in the potter’s wheel and shaped by the hands (of the potter) attains multifarious shapes, so also the foetus united with bones and impelled by the wind becomes a human body with proper forms, features and mind. The wind assembles them together. From the wind water is generated. From the water the vital breath is formed and through the vital breath the semen gets developed. Thirty three parts of blood (female contribution) and fourteen parts of the semen mixing together form only half a Pala (two karsas) and is deposited in the womb. The child in the womb is covered by the five vital breaths. From the father’s body he inherits his forms and features.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 39.14-16 “At the time of menstruation, the air draws the semen virile up, from the inside, after which it magnifies itself there; and then it develops into the embryo and assumes human or animal form (according to the kind of the womb where such development occurs)…” Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, Edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>The following excerpts from Brahma Vaivarta Purana and Skanda Purana provide details about Puranic Embryology,</p>
<p>Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Prakriti Khanda 35.121-141 “…As soon as the semen is cast into the womb it is mixed up with blood. If there is excess of blood, the issue takes the form of his mother, and if there is excess of semen, the issue takes his father’s form. The combination of the semen with the blood on even days, i.e. Sunday, Tuesday and Thursday, results in a male issue, otherwise, in a female issue…Semen and blood get united in one night. This union, followed by development from day to day. On the seventh day, the fetus takes the form of a jujube and it takes the form of a pillow in a month, the shape of a lump of flesh without hands and feet in three months and is vested with hands, legs and other members of the body in the fifth month. In the sixth month the body gets animation and consciousness, the animate body then knows the past, but like a bird in a cage, it suffers endless torments. The child in the womb occupies the most unholy place for residence, partakes of the remains of the food eaten by its mother and contemplates Hari in endless tortures. After four months of trouble the child impelled by the wind of the womb is born. But by the illusion of Hari, it forgets the past and oblivious of the quarters, time, space and the necessities…” Tr. Rajendra Nath Sen</p>
<p>Skanda Purana V.iii.159.33-53 “…when semen and blood become mixed due to the intercourse of a man and a woman, a creature is born undoubtedly…In the first month it is a phlegmatic mass with the full complement of the body ingredients. In the second month it is a lump of flesh; in the third it gets equipped with sense organs. From the element of ether it derives lightness, subtlety, sound, power of hearing, strength etc. From air the Atman obtains sense of touch, movement, digestive power and roughness. From fiery element the sense of vision, warmth, digestive capacity, colour, and illumination are obtained. It takes from watery elements chillness, fluidity, dampness and softness. From earth element it takes odour, sense of smell, weight and physical form. These are unborn Atman takes up in the third month and beings to throb. If the longing of a pregnant woman is not fulfilled, the foetus becomes defective. It may get ugliness or even death. Hence the woman should be kept pleased. In the fourth month the limbs get firmness. Blood begins to flow in the fifth month. Physical strength is obtained in the sixth month. Complexion is fixed and the nails and hairs grow at that time. In the seventh month, the foetus becomes endowed with consciousness and mind and the body has all the nails and hundreds of hairs. In the eighth month, the outer skin is fixed and the foetus becomes endowed with the power of memory. It is at this time that his sin pursues the foetus and the mother as well. Hence if the birth is premature and the child is born in the eighth month it dies invariably. Either in the ninth or the tenth month the child comes out naturally forced by the powerful winds at the time of delivery…Now it has its full complement of the limbs of the body. There are one hundred vulnerable joints with three hundred Asthas (bones?). There are seven skull pieces in the head created by the Self born Lord himself. O descendant of Bharata, there are three and half crores of hairs on the limbs. There are seventy two thousand Nadis (nerve vessels) fanning out.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Both these passages are contradicting each other. Hinduism believes that a woman becomes pregnant after semen mixes with her menstrual blood. Semen contains millions of sperm and a woman becomes pregnant when a sperm enters egg of the female and not when entire semen mixes with blood. Every Purana which talks about Embryology says that a woman becomes pregnant after her blood mixes with semen which is a scientific error. Foetus doesn’t take the form of a jujube in a week. The above verse from Brahma Vaivarta Purana says that foetus takes the shape of a lump of flesh without hands and feet in three months and is vested with hands and legs in the fifth month which is not correct because the foetus starts developing limbs in 8 weeks (2 months) and by 14th week (3 ½ month) the lower limbs are well developed, refer Mayo Clinic’c articles <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/prenatal-care/art-20045302?pg=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Link 1<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/fetal-development/art-20046151?pg=2" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Link 2<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>,</p>
<p>In this article by <a href="https://www.babycenter.com/fetal-development-week-by-week" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">babycenter.com<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> you can see pictures of foetus development week by week.</p>
<p>It also says that the baby “partakes of the remains of the food eaten by its mother” while the baby doesn’t eat food in the womb, it gets all nutrients from the umbilical cord. Now let’s move on to Skanda Purana. It says that in the third month the baby gets the power of hearing, whereas the baby begins to hear from the 18th week (4 ½ month), refer <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/fetal-development/art-20046151" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Mayo Clinic<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>‘s article. It also says that the baby obtains sense of movement, digestive power in the third month whereas this happens after the fourth month, Refer <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/fetal-development/art-20046151" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Mayo Clinic<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. Blood begins to flow in the 6th week and heart pumps about 100 pints of blood each day in 17th week (4 month &amp; 1 week) but Skanda Purana says that blood begins to flow in the fifth month, refer <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/fetal-development/art-20046151" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Mayo Clinic<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> and <a href="http://www.parents.com/pregnancy/stages/fetal-development/first-trimester-images-of-your-developing-baby/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Parents.com<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. Skanda Purana says that in the sixth month the baby grows hairs and nails and by seventh month it has all hairs and nails whereas baby’s fingernails starts forming in 10 weeks (2 months &amp; 2 weeks) and toenails appears in 14-15 (3 ½ months) weeks and develops in 17th week (4 months and 1 week), refer Mayo Clinic <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/prenatal-care/art-20045302?pg=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">link 1<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/fetal-development/art-20046151" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">link 2<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> and <a href="https://embryology.med.unsw.edu.au/embryology/index.php/Integumentary_System_-_Nail_Development" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">UNSW.edu.au<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. Hairs starts growing in 22 week (5 months &amp; 2 week) and gets a full head of hairs by 30th week (7 month &amp; 2 weeks), refer Mayo Clinic, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/fetal-development/art-20046151?pg=2" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">link 1<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> &amp; <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/fetal-development/art-20045997" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">link 2<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. Skanda Purana is bit correct about bones of baby but not precisely accurate, a new born baby has 270-350 bones. It says that baby’s skulll has 7 pieces whereas the skull of a baby consists of five main bones: two frontal bones, two parietal bones, and one occipital bone. These are joined by fibrous sutures, which allow movement that facilitates childbirth and brain growth, refer <a href="http://www.stanfordchildrens.org/en/topic/default?id=anatomy-of-the-newborn-skull-90-P01840" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Stanford Children’s Health<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> &amp; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fontanelle" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Wikipedia<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>.</p>
<p>Now let’s evaluate Embryology mentioned in Padma and Bhagavad Puranas,</p>
<p>Padma Purana II.66.22-38 …The semen with the blood (of the woman) would be (turned into) a foetus in a day. Then within five nights bubbles would be formed in the foetus. It takes the form of flesh in the five forms; neck, head, shoulder (s), spine and belly; so also hands and feet, the two sides, waists, and (the other parts of) the body; the limbs are produced one by one within two months. After three months, hundreds of sharp joints are produced (i.e. formed). Fingers etc. are produced (i.e. are formed) one by one in four months. After five months mouth, nose and ears are produced (i.e. formed). Within six months, the row of teeth, so also tongue and nails are formed, so also cavities in the ears are formed. So also are formed anus, penis, organ of generation and the male organ of generation. The joints which (are present) in the limbs, are formed within seven months. In the eight month the head with the entire body with limbs and with each limb clearly separated is formed. He is complete and endowed with five. Due to the power of the food of (i.e. eaten by) the mother and by the tastes of six kinds, fixed in the umbilical cord (i.e. the foetus) grows day by day.” Tr. N.A Deshpande</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 3.31.2-5 “On the first night, the sperm and ovum mix, and on the fifth night the mixture ferments into a bubble. On the tenth night it develops into a form like a plum, and after that, it gradually turns into a lump of flesh or an egg, as the case may be. In the course of a month, a head is formed, and at the end of two months the hands, feet and other limbs take shape. By the end of three months, the nails, fingers, toes, body hair, bones and skin appear, as do the organ of generation and the other apertures in the body, namely the eyes, nostrils, ears, mouth and anus. Within four months from the date of conception, the seven essential ingredients of the body, namely chyle, blood, flesh, fat, bone, marrow and semen, come into existence. At the end of five months, hunger and thirst make themselves felt, and at the end of six months, the fetus, enclosed by the amnion, begins to move on the right side of the abdomen. Deriving its nutrition from the food and drink taken by the mother, the fetus grows and remains in that abominable residence of stools and urine, which is the breeding place of all kinds of worms.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam says a head is formed in a month whereas head develops in 7<sup>th</sup> week (1 month &amp; 3 weeks) refer <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/prenatal-care/art-20045302?pg=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Mayo Clinic’s article<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. It says by the end of third month (i.e. on 3<sup>rd</sup> month) nails appear whereas baby’s fingernails starts forming in 10 weeks (2 months &amp; 2 weeks) and toenails appears in 14-15 weeks (around 3 ½ months) and develops in 17th week (4 months and 1 week), refer Mayo Clinic <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/prenatal-care/art-20045302?pg=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">link 1<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/fetal-development/art-20046151" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">link 2<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. Srimad Bhagavatam says that fingers, nostrils, toes, reproductive organ appears in third month whereas it occurs much early than that, fingers starts forming at 8<sup>th</sup> week (2 months), nostrils form at 7-8 week (around 2 months), toes forms at 9<sup>th</sup> week (2 month &amp; 1 week), genitals develops on 11<sup>th</sup> week (2 months &amp; 3 week), refer <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/prenatal-care/art-20045302?pg=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Mayo Clinic’s article<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>.</p>
<p>Now let’s evaluate Padma Purana. Padma Purana says fingers are formed in 4 months which is contrary to what is mentioned in Srimad Bhagavatam which says they are formed in 3 months but in reality this occurs much earlier than that, reference is already given above. It says after five months nose, ears are produced whereas ears starts developing much earlier than that i.e. in 8<sup>th</sup> week (2 months) and baby may begin to hear by 18<sup>th</sup> week (4 months &amp; 2 weeks), refer <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/prenatal-care/art-20045302?pg=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Link 1<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/fetal-development/art-20046151?pg=2" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Link 2<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. And nose is formed in 2<sup>nd</sup> month (week 8) refer <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/prenatal-care/art-20045302?pg=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Mayo Clinic<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. It says nails are formed in 6<sup>th</sup> month whereas baby’s fingernails starts forming in 10 weeks (2 months &amp; 2 weeks) and toenails appears in 14-15 weeks and develops in 17th week (4 months and 1 week), refer Mayo Clinic <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/prenatal-care/art-20045302?pg=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">link 1<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/fetal-development/art-20046151" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">link 2<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> and <a href="https://embryology.med.unsw.edu.au/embryology/index.php/Integumentary_System_-_Nail_Development" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">UNSW.edu.au<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. Padma Purana says that reproductive organs are formed in 6th month which is contrary to what is mentioned in Srimad Bhagavatam which says that reproductive organ is formed in 3 months which are both contradictory. Organ of generation develops on 11<sup>th</sup> week (2 months &amp; 3 week), refer <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/prenatal-care/art-20045302?pg=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Mayo Clinic’s article<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>.</p>

<h1><a id="post-6594-3"></a>Semen is produced?</h1>
<p>These verses even says that bone is produced from fat,</p>
<p>Brahma Purana 70.49 “Fat is produced from flesh; bone is produced from fat; marrow is generated from bone and semen is produced from marrow.” Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Also mentioned in Brahmanda Purana 2.3.72.44</p>
<p>Harivamsa Purana 1.40.48-56 “The distillate of various foods, rasa, vital-juice, produces blood, and flesh is produced from that blood; fat comes from flesh and bones from that fat; bones generate marrow and marrow generates seminal fluid, from which pregnancy occurs; hence, rasa, vital-fluid is substratum of all… Water is the primary principle of that rasa, vital-fluid, and this belongs to the soma, the moon, or, the nectarean principle of the moon, in the somatology – Greek – soma -atos ‘body’ and its formation… heat resides in the second half, say in menstrual blood… hence, the being of living beings is a compound of coolness and heatedness of the moon and fire. Thus the essence of all juice, the seminal fluid, is created by an excess of phlegm; blood is created by an excess billious matter. The seat of phlegm is the heart and the seat of bile is the navel. The heart, which is in the body, is known as the seat of the mind. The fire exists behind the cavity of the navel – jaThara agni – is none other than huta-ashana, the devourer of oblations, whose life-spirit is madhu-sUdana. Mind is known as prajApati, the phlegm as soma and the bile as agni. Thus the whole world is a commixture of heat and cold. Where a conception takes place, as is the formation of a cloud, the air enters there accompanied by the Absolute… It then creates the various limbs and nourishes them. Inside the body the vital air divides itself into five kinds of airs, namely prANa, apAna, samAna, samAna and vyAna, and gradually assumes proportions.” Tr. Desiraju Hanumant Rao</p>
<p>Vayu Purana II.35.45-46 ”From flesh fat is produced and bone is developed from fat. Pith and marrow are developed from bone and semen virile is generated from marrow; foetus is developed from semen through assimilative activity of Rasa bodily fluid (or through the activity rooted in sexual pleasure).” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>

<h1><a id="post-6594-4"></a>Conceiving pregnancy at will without intercourse</h1>
<p>Hinduism says that sexual intercourse wasn’t needed to conceive birth in ancient period and offspring were begotten by flat of the will and in the succeeding Yuga women conceived pregnancies just by touch,</p>
<p>Mahabharata 12.207.38-40 “…Sexual congress, O chief of the Bharatas, was then not necessary for perpetuating the species. In those days offspring were begotten by flat of the will. In the age that followed, viz., Treta, children were begotten by touch alone. The people of that age even, O monarch, were above the necessity of sexual congress. It was in the next age, viz., Dwapara, that the practice of sexual congress originated, O king, to prevail among men. In the Kali age, O monarch, men have come to marry and live in pairs…” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Vayu Purana II.2.45 ”The creation of the earlier ones was due to thought, sight, and touch. Thenceforth, the subjects in this world were born of sexual intercourse.” Tr. G.V. Tagare, edited by G.P. Bhatt</p>
<p>Seer Urva is said to have created a son named Aurva with his mental ability,</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 175.43-44 ”…If one has the seed of asceticism within him, he can create a son from his mind…The ascetics ought to beget progeny out of the embryo created by their mind, and your address to me is bereft of dharma, and is like the speech of those who are not good. By the power of my innerself, I shall create a son, without the help of a woman, after illumining my mind with the glory of asceticism. I shall create such a son out of my soul, who would be ready to consume the creation. Afterwards the sage Urva, absorbed in his asceticism, throwing his thighs into the fire rubbed them with a kusu grass. Then the son in the form of Fire, desirous of consuming the universe, was produced from his thigh, by its own force without the help of any firewood. In such a way the fearful Aurva was begotten from the thigh of the seer Urva.” Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, Edited by B.D. Basu</p>

<h1><a id="post-6594-5"></a>Conceiving pregnancy by drinking semen</h1>
<p>Hinduism also says that a woman can become pregnant by drinking semen. It even says that animals can become pregnant after drinking human semen,</p>
<p>Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Brahma Kanda 20.33-46 “…At that time, Menaka was passing by that way, At the sight of her thigh and breast the semen of the saint was discharged. Thereupon the woman Kalavati drank it cheerfully, went to her husband, bowed to him and told him everything about, her pregnancy…” Tr. Rajendra Nath Sen</p>
<p>Varaha Purana 95.20-21 “Finding the water fragrant (with it), Mahismati told her friends that she would drink it. She then drank the water containing the emission of the sage. As a result she conceived and in due time brought forth, a son named Mahisa, intelligent and valiant.” Tr. Venkitaasubramonia Iyer, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Skanda Purana III.iii.19.64 The semen virile of the royal sage Yupaketu fell into water. It is said that a harlot drank that water together with the semen and became pregnant” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Skanda Purana V.iii.5.27-37 “…O excellent king, Paramesthin Rudra sported about with Uma in the vast expanse of sea-like water. A splendid girl was born out of the sweat of Uma due to her delight. When Sarva’s chest pressed against the breasts of Uma, a great girl of lotus-like eyes issued forth from the sweat…” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 4.2.13-17 “Yuvanaswa had no son, at which he was deeply grieved. Whilst residing in the vicinage of the holy Munis, he inspired them with pity for his childless condition, and they instituted a religious rite to procure him progeny. One night during its performance the sages having placed a vessel of consecrated water upon the altar had retired to repose. It was past midnight, when the king awoke, exceedingly thirsty; and unwilling to disturb any of the holy inmates of the dwelling, he looked about for something to drink. In his search he came to the water in the jar, which had been sanctified and endowed with prolific efficacy by sacred texts, and he drank it. When the Munis rose, and found that the water had been drunk, they inquired who had taken it, and said, “The queen that has drunk this water shall give birth to a mighty and valiant son.” “It was I,” exclaimed the Raja, “who unwittingly drank the water!” and accordingly in the belly of Yuvanaswa was conceived a child, and it grew, and in due time it ripped open the right side of the Raja, and was born, and the Raja, did not die&#8230;&#8221; Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Animals becoming pregnant,</p>
<p>Skanda Purana III.iii.19.65 “After drinking the semen of Sage Vibhandaka together with water, a female deer became pregnant and gave birth to Rsyasrnga.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Mahabharata 1.3.17 “…The Rishi thus addressed, answered Janamejaya, ‘O Janamejaya, this my son, deep in ascetic devotions, accomplished in the study of the Vedas, and endued with the full force of my asceticism, is born of (the womb of) a she-snake that had drunk my vital fluid…” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 5.2.27-31 “…Vyasa said :– O king! Hearing thus the sweet words of Fire, Rambha quitted the hold of his hairs and said :– O Lord of the Devas! If thou art pleased, grant my desired boon that a son be born unto me, who will destroy the forces of my enemy and who will conquer the three worlds. And that son be invincible in every way by the Devas, Danavas and men, very powerful, assuming forms at will, and respected by all. The Fire [Agni] said :– O highly Fortunate! You will get your son, as you desire; therefore desist now from your attempting suicide. O highly fortunate Rambha! With any female of whichever species, you will co-habit, you will get a son, more powerful than you; there is no doubt in this. Vyasa said :– O king! Hearing thus the sweet words of the Fire as desired, Rambha, the chief of the Danavas, went, surrounded by Yaksas, to a beautiful place, adorned with picturesque sceneries; when one lovely she-buffalo, who was very maddened with passion, fell to the sight of Rambha. And he desired to have sexual intercourse with her, in preference to other women. The she-buffallo, too, gladly yielded to his purpose and Rambha had sexual intercourse with her, impelled as it were by the destiny. The she-buffalo became pregnant with his semen virile…” Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>

<p>Earth according to Vedas is four cornered,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.58.3 Thy spirit, that went far away, away to the four cornered earth…</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana says the same,</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahman 6.1.2.29 …Now this earth is four-cornered, for the quarters are her corners: hence the bricks are four-cornered; for all the bricks are after the manner of this earth.</p>

<p>Rig Veda 8.6.5 &#8220;His might is manifest, for Indra folds and unfolds both heaven and earth, as (one spreads or rolls up) a skin.&#8221; Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Rig Veda 6.8.3 “Wonderful Mitra propped the heaven and earth apart, and covered and concealed the darkness with his light. He made the two bowls part asunder like two skins. Vaiśvānara put forth all his creative power.” Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>One can Google how a hide (skin of animal) is stretched and spread. Some Puranas describes the earth as lotus shaped,</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 2.12.36 “From the waters, which are the body of Vishnu, was produced the lotus shaped earth, with its seas and mountains.” Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.34.44 “The lotus that was fashioned by Visnu grew from his umbilicus. The earth along with the forests and the trees was evolved in the shape of a lotus.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam describes the planetary system or the earth as lotus shaped and Jambudvipa (Which is supposed to where we live) in the shape of leaf of a lotus flower,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 5.16.5 “The planetary system known as Bhū-maṇḍala resembles a lotus flower, and its seven islands resemble the whorl of that flower. The length and breadth of the island known as Jambūdvīpa, which is situated in the middle of the whorl, are one million yojanas [eight million miles]. Jambūdvīpa is round like the leaf of a lotus flower.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Markandeya Purana 156.22 also mentions Earth as a lotus. Puranas says that Vishnu flattened the Earth,</p>
<p>Padma Purana 1.3.55 “The beginningless supreme being, then having flattened the earth, piled the mountains on it according to (its) divisions.” Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 1.4.45-48 “The supreme being thus eulogized, upholding the earth, raised it quickly, and placed it on the summit of the ocean, where it floats like a mighty vessel, and from its expansive surface does not sink beneath the waters. Then, having levelled the earth, the great eternal deity divided it into portions, by mountains…” Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Kurma Purana I.6.25 “He levelled the earth and gathered the mountains together on it…” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Shiva Purana VayaviyaSamhita 7, Section I.11.34-35; Vayu Purana I.6.27 “The Boar brought the earth to its own place. It then assumed his natural form and fixed it there. He levelled the earth, fixed the mountains and set up the four worlds on the earth as before.” Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Veda says that the Earth is stretched or spread out. Hindus often uses such verses against other religions, wondering what they will have to say about these,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 3.6.5 Great are the deeds of thee, the Great, O Agni: thou by thy power hast spread out earth and heaven.</p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.62.3 Ye raised the Sun to heaven by everlasting Law, and spread broad earth, the Mother</p>

<p>Some translates words like Gau, Bhu Mandala as globe which is misleading, they try to insert their own definitions while according to Hinduism, the Earth is four-cornered, lotus shaped, shaped like a leaf of a lotus flower etc, but the idea of Earth as a flat circular disk is emphasised in the Puranas. Puranas describes the earth as a flat disc of enormous size. In its centre was Mount Meru, round which sun, moon and stars revolved. Around Meru were continents or regions (Dvipa), separated from the central peak by oceans, and named according to the great trees which stood on their shores opposite Meru. According to some Puranas there are Saptadvipas (four regions/continents/islands) in the world and as per some there are Chaturdvipa (four Dvipas) including Jambduvipa. Below the earth are seven levels of hell and above the earth is heaven, the earth is established on waters. This is the description of earth given in Hindu scriptures. The verses are not clear, but if you search Jambudvipa on Google then you will find stuff related to Earth as a Flat Circular disc also if you imagine the Earth as described in Puranas then you will get a flat circular earth.</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 2.2.4-36 “PARÁŚARA.–You shall hear, Maitreya, a brief account of the earth from me: a full detail I could not give you in a century. The seven great insular continents are Jambu, Plaksha, Sálmali, Kuśa, Krauncha, Śáka, and Pushkara: and they are surrounded severally by seven great seas; the sea of salt water (Lavańa), of sugar-cane juice (Ikshu), of wine (Surá), of clarified butter (Sarpi), of curds (Dadhi), of milk (Dugdha), and of fresh water (Jala). Jambu-dwípa is in the centre of all these: and in the centre of this continent is the golden mountain Meru…The capital of Brahma is enclosed by the river Ganges, which, issuing from the foot of Vishńu, and washing the lunar orb, falls here from the skies…” Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Agni Purana 212.33-35 “…Obeisance to the mount Meru, the representative of Vishnu on earth. Salutation unto the mountain which forms the main stay of the earth. I make obeisance to the mountain situate at the centre of the earth…” Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Harivamsha Purana 3.34.4 “Containing the earth within four boundaries, the Lord created the great ocean. At the centre of the earth, the golden mountain, meru was installed.” Tr. Desiraju Hanumanta Rao</p>
<p>Padma Purana VII.2.10-17 “…At the centre of the earth he produced the great mountain (viz. Meru) with jewelled peaks…” Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana I.2.21.13-16 “…The extent of the earth towards all the sides (quarters) from the middle of the Meru is remembered as one crore and eightynine lakhs (of Yojanas)…” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 2.4.87-93 “…In this manner the seven island continents are encompassed successively by the seven oceans, and each ocean and continent is respectively of twice the extent of that which precedes it…” Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Following verses shows that Mount Meru is in the middle of the earth with land surrounding it and the land is separated by oceans,</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.34.37 “From the unmanifest the great lotus of the earth is evolved. Its pericarp is the four-cornered Meru that is five times great.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 123.27-28 “Thus the seven dvipas are surrounded by the seven oceans…” Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, Edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>Linga Purana I.46.1 “The Earth consists of seven continents. It is full of rivers and mountains. It is surrounded by seven oceans all round and embellished by them.” Tr. Board of Scholars, Edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.34.46 “The four famous great continents are stationed on the petals. The powerful Meru is stationed on the pericarp.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Similar thing is mentioned in Mahabharata,</p>
<p>Mahabharata 6.6.18-21 “Besides Meru are situated, O lord, these four islands, viz., Bhadraswa, and Ketumala, and Jamvudwipa otherwise called Bharata, and Uttar-Kuru which is the abode of persons who have achieved the merit of righteousness. The bird Sumukha, the son of Suparna, beholding that all the birds on Meru were of golden plumage, reflected that he should leave that mountain inasmuch as there was no difference between the good, middling, and bad birds. The foremost of luminaries, the sun, always circumambulates Meru” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.34.56 “That Meru, the purifier of living beings, is encircled by worlds. Four islands are established on its different sides.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.50.68-70 “The entire earth is known as fifty crores (of Yojanas) in extent. From the middle of Meru on all four sides is half of it. Half the extent of the earth is stated in terms of Yojanas. The extent of the earth towards all the sides (quarters) from the middle of Meru is said to be eleven crores and eighty nine lakhs (of Yojanas) and fifty thousand.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana I.2.15.12-13 “Jambudvipa is immense and glorious with huge zones all round. It is encircled by nine worlds that evolve a number of living beings. It is surrounded on all sides by the briny sea the extent of which is equal to that of Jambudvipa itself.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>

<p>Padma Purana 1.19.166-171 &#8220;&#8230;O you creator of the worlds, you are the protector and creator of us and (also) of the worlds. This flat world will be elevated by your favour&#8230;&#8221; Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p>The above verse mentions Vishnu’s boar avatar Varaha lifting up the “Flat world”, almost all ancient Hindu temples depict Varaha holding personified earth or Bhudevi and not flat or spherical earth. Many Hindus have falsely presented idols of Varaha from the 21<sup>st</sup> century as ancient ones where Varaha is depicted as holding up spherical earth, but all those false information has been debunked <a href="https://www.vishvasnews.com/english/viral/fact-check-this-varaha-statue-is-not-thousand-years-old-viral-claim-is-misleading/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">here<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. However, there are plenty of pictures from the medieval period depicting Varaha holding up flat earth. Though there are many pictures from the 17<sup>th</sup> to 19<sup>th</sup> century, I am reproducing a few pictures here,</p>

Idol of Varaha depicts it holding flat earth by its tusks at Adi Varaha Temple, Mathura. Though the date of this idol is unknown, it is believed to be the oldest Varaha temple. And finds mention in Varaha Purana chapter 163 stating that the idol was created by Sage Kapila.</p>

<h1><a id="post-6594-9"></a>Earth is immovable</h1>
<p>There are chapters in Puranas about movements of planets. It mentions revolution of all planets of our solar system like Venus, Mercury, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn and even satellite and star like Moon and Sun but nowhere mentions the movement of the Earth. Which proves that the Earth according to Hinduism is stationary.</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana 2.3.52.8 &#8220;The earth overwhelmed by the ocean began to quake though its name is Acala (immovable). There was a break and hindrance in the penance and abstract meditation of the ascetics.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Mahabharata, Anushasana Parva 12, Section 62, verse 2 &#8220;Bhishma said, &#8216;Of all kinds of gifts, the gift of earth has been said to be the first (in point of merit). Earth is immovable and indestructible&#8230;&#8221; Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Vamana Purana 8.26 &#8220;I bow down to the Worshipful Lord Visnu who raised the immovable earth with one single tusk, who sustains everything, and who sleeps absorbing the entire universe in Him.&#8221; Tr. Ananada Swarup Gupta</p>
<p>Mahabharata 13.62.2 “…Earth is immovable and indestructible…” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Mahabharata 5.76.7-8 “Behold, O Krishna, these the firmament and the earth which are immovable, immense, and infinite, and which are the refuge of, and in which are born these countless creatures.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.35.11; Linga Purana I.49.25b-27 “Meru has four great ranges (legs) in all the four quarters. Held by them, the earth with her seven continents does not move.” Tr. G.V. tagare</p>

<p>Brahmanda Purana 1.2.21.87-88 “Everyday the sun traverses those (zones) in due order. Just as the outer rim of the potter’s wheel comes back quickly (i.e. revolves), so also the sun functions quickly during his Souther transit. Hence, he traverses a major portion of the Earth in the course of a shorter period.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana I.2.23.44-45 “Thus the sun traverses the quarters by means of his swift chariot with one wheel. The horses are splendid but they do not have the usual place (? Akramaih).

<p>Matsya Purana 126.41-46 “The Sun in course of one single day and night goes swiftly over the world consisting of the seven oceans and the seven islands, seating in His one-wheeled chariot and drawn by seven horses. The seven horses yoked to the Sun’s chariot are no other than the seven chhandas metres); they can assume forms at their will; they go as they like…Ascending on such a chariot the Sun travels the earth in course of one day (24 hours.) The horses were yoked at the beginning of Kalpa and carry on the Sun toll the end of the Great Dissolution (Maha Pralaya). Thus He goes on round and round, day and night, surrounded by the Valakhillya Munis…” Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, Edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 128.71-73 “The Sun moves lowest down of all the planets. Above Him the Moon travels.

Taluqdar of Oudh, Edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.52.43-44 “Thus the Sun moves ahead quickly in his celestial sphere by means of his single-wheeled chariot dragged by the unimpaired gentle horses.

<p>Vayu Purana I.50.119-121; Matsya Purana 124.40-60 “When the sun passes through the middle of the sky, it traverses one thirtieth of the diameter of the earth in a Muhurta (forty eight minutes). In regard to the distance traversed in Yojanas, know that it is three million one hundred and fifty thousand in full. This is the distance traverses by the sun in one Muhurta.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 5.22.5 “The sun-god, who is Nārāyaṇa, or Viṣṇu, the soul of all the worlds, is situated in outer space between the upper and lower portions of the universe. Passing through twelve months on the wheel of time, the sun comes in touch with twelve different signs of the zodiac…” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 5.22.7 “The sun-god has three speeds — slow, fast and moderate. The time he takes to travel entirely around the spheres of heaven, earth<br />
and space at these three speeds is referred to, by learned scholars, by the five names Saṁvatsara, Parivatsara, Iḍāvatsara, Anuvatsara and Vatsara.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana 8:7:2:5 …having once revolved round these worlds, that sun would not pass by them. Let him lay down the two last alongside the two first by reaching over them: he thus causes that sun to pass by these worlds; and hence that sun revolves incessantly round these worlds again and again (from left) to right.</p>
<p>Varaha Purana 26.8 “From its lustre arose twelve suns, and the principal one among these now revolves round the world.” Tr. Vankitasubramonia Iyer, Edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Mahabharata 6.6.7-16 “…This (the land where we are) is in the Varsha that is called after Bharata…Besides Meru are situated, O lord, these four islands, viz., Bhadraswa, and Ketumala, and Jamvudwipa otherwise called Bharata, and Uttar-Kuru…The foremost of luminaries, the sun, always circumambulates Meru, as also the moon with (his) attendant constellation, and the Wind-god too…” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Mount Meru is in the centre of the world.</p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.35.9 “The gold-handed, all-beholding luminary travels between the two regions of heaven and earth, dispels diseases, and this, verily, is known as the sun, and it finally overspreads the sky, extending from the dark interspace to the celestial region” Tr. SatyaPrakash Saraswati.</p>
<p>Nirukta 7.23 The sun having first revolved towards the northern hemisphere, a person holds a polished (piece of) white copper, or crystal, focusing the sun-rays in a place where there is some dry cow-dung, without touching it… Now (had VaisVauara been the sun), there would have occurred expressions relating to VaisVanara in those same hymns and shares which are assigned to celestial deities, i.e. Savitr, [Surya], Pusan, Visnu, and [the VisVedevas.] And they would have praised him by (attributing to him) the functions of the sun, as thou risest, thou settest, thou revolvest, &amp;c.</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 13.2.6 “Hail to thy rapid car whereon, O Sūrya, thou circlest in a moment both the limits…[44] The suppliant&#8217;s way, filling the earth, the Mighty circleth the world with eye that none deceiveth…” Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.50.60 “Revolving all round, the Sun illuminates and protects the three worlds. Hence on account of illumination and protection, he is called ‘Ravi’. The root av means ‘illumination’ (and protection.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Following verses shows movements of the Sun,</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana I.2.21.35-36 “Understand the movement of the sun during the southern transit, as he goes to that quarter. His movement is above all the guardians of the quarters. During this southern transit, the sun rushes forward like an arrow that is discharged. He revolved always, taking the circle of luminaries with him.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana 1.2.21.45-46 “The sun revolves rapidly like the whirling firebrand. Moving about, the sun traverses the revolving constellations. Thus the sun thereby moves to the south among the four quarters. The sun rises and sets again and again.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 125.50-58 …The success of the sun’s chariot is due to the conjunction (with Dhruva). Thus this divine solar chariot moves about in the heaven. The pins of the yoke and axle are on its south. The pair of reins of the yoke and the wheel of this aerial chariot revolve round and round in all directions like the potter’s wheel…</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 5.22.6 “Thus the time the sun takes to rotate through half of outer space is called an ayana, or its period of movement [in the north or in the south].” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.51.68-69 “With that the lord Sun moves quickly in the heaven. There are two reins of the chariot tied to the tips of the pole and the axle. Propelled by Dhruva the chariot moves in the sky in a circular fashion.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.50.92-93 “Understand the solar movement when the sun reaches south during the southern transit all round above the guardians of the worlds. In his transit to the south, the sun moves fast like a discharged arrow. It takes the group of luminary bodies with it and revolves always.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.50.151-4 “During the northern transit, the movement of the moon (?) is slow during day and fast during night. During the southern transit the sun’s movement is dast during day and slow during night. Dividing nights and days thus by its special diverse movements, the sun traverses the path by its even (regular) and uneven (irregular) movement.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Many verses are clearly saying that the sun travels around the earth so there is no way for apologists to defend these verses. Also read categories like Sun moves in a chariot pulled by Seven Horses, Speed of Sun moving around the Earth which proves that the Sun indeed revolves around the earth as per Hinduism.</p>

<h1><a id="post-6594-11"></a>Sun moves in a chariot pulled by seven horses</h1>
<p>Sun travelling in a horse pulled by seven horses is quite similar to Greek mythology&#8217;s Sun god <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helios" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Helios<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. Indian Prime Minister from the Hindu nationalist party said that, <a href="http://www.hindustantimes.com/india/india-can-lead-fight-against-global-warming-pm-modi/story-2IKlOQEcBApVtoKw1XCaUI.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">In our mythology we have imagined the sun god Surya riding on seven horses<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. This has basis in Hindu scriptures which says,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.50.8; 1.50.1 O, Bright sun, a chariot named harit with seven horses takes you to sky</p>
<p>Mahabharata book 13.158.20-22 …the sun possessed of a thousand rays… He it is that constitutes the wheel of the year, having three naves and seven horses to drag it…He is the sun, the dispeller of all darkness.</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 5.21.12-19 “Thus the chariot of the sun-god, which is trayimaya, or worshiped by the words om bhur bhuvah svah, travels through the four residences…My dear King, the carriage of the sun-god’s chariot is estimated to be 3,600,000 yojanas [28,800,000 miles] long and one-fourth as wide [900,000 yojanas, or 7,200,000 miles]. The chariot’s horses, which are named after Gayatri and other Vedic meters, are harnessed by Arunadeva to a yoke that is also 900,000 yojanas wide. This chariot continuously carries the sun-god. Although Arunadeva sits in front of the sun-god and is engaged in driving the chariot and controlling the horses, he looks backward toward the sun-god…My dear King, in his orbit through Bhu-mandala [Earth], the sun-god traverses a distance of 95,100,000 yojanas [760,800,000 miles] at the speed of 2,000 yojanas and two krosas [16,004 miles] in a moment.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana I.2.23.50 “…The lord of the day (i.e. the sun) thus revolves and wanders by means of horses that gallop and that are as swift as birds.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Linga Purana I.55.81-82 “Thus the sun, the harbinger of the day moves ahead quickly in a single wheeled chariot drawn by seven green imperishable horses. He whirls day and night in his chariot which has a single wheel. He traverses in heaven over the seven continents and oceans with the help of seven groups.” Tr. Board of Scholars, Edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Devi Bhagwatam 8.15.40-45 “…The seat of the Sun on his chariot measures 36 Lakh Yoyanas wide. The Yuga measures in length one fourth of the above dimensions, that of his seat. The Chariot is moved by seven horses, consisting of the seven Chhandas, Gâyatrî, etc., driven by Aruna. The horses carry the Sun for the happiness of all. Though the charioteer sits in front of the Sun, his face is turned towards the west. He does his work as a charioteer in that state…” Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>It&#8217;s possibly inspired by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trundholm_sun_chariot" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Trundholm Sun Chariot<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> commonly found in the European mythologies. Some apologists tries to defend this by saying that seven horses mentioned here are not actually horses but seven rays. In many Hindu scriptures the Sun is described as of having a thousand rays not 7 rays and none of the Puranas or the Mahabharat explains seven horses as seven rays, so this proves that its apologists concocted explanation which has no basis. If seven horses are described as seven rays then does that mean the Moon too emits ten rays as Hindu scriptures describes moon moving in a chariot pulled by 10 horses. Sun is described in Hindu scriptures including the Vedas as of having 1000 rays not 7 rays, these 7 horses’ names are different than the names of rays of sun given in Hindu scriptures. Hindu scriptures clearly mentions that the seven horses are seven Vedic metres who have assumed the shape of horses. Some also explain it by saying that one wheel of the chariot signifies day or year, five spokes in it signifies five seasons etc. which is true to an extent but the one wheel represents year and five spokes of the chariot represents five seasons, the chariot is not a metaphor. Just as in the Tricolor (Indian flag) the saffron, white and green represents courage and sacrifice, peace and truth, and faith and chivalry respectively, the Ashoka Chakra in the middle represents the eternal wheel of law so the wheel of the chariot and its spokes too represent year and seasons in the same manner. Hindu scriptures even gives the size of Sun’s chariot, how will apologists explain that? If it is symbolic then why Hindu scriptures mentioned the size of chariot? And why do they say that Sun moves around in his chariot? Hindu scriptures also mentions chariot of moon what does it signify? Also check above topic especially Brahmanda Purana I.2.23.44-45 and Vayu Purana I.52.43-44 which clearly states about Sun revolving around the earth in a chariot pulled by horses and even has a charioteer in front. Logically speaking does the Sun rotates or revolves through rays if horses means rays? Before speaking about 7 horses of the sun, the Mahabharata verse mentions 1000 rays of the sun which makes it pretty clear that 7 horses aren’t really rays, moreover if seven horses of the sun means 7 rays of the sun then what does 10 horses of the moon means? Hindu text mentions 10 horses of the moon also, does that mean moon also emits 10 types of rays?</p>

<h1><a id="post-6594-12"></a>Even the Moon moves around the earth in a chariot pulled by horses</h1>
<p>Brahmanda Purana 1.2.23.50-51 “He is served by Gandharvas and groups of celestial damsels by means of sons and dances. The lord of the day (i.e. the sun) thus revolves and wanders by means of horses that gallop and that are as swift as birds. The chariot of Soma (the Moon) has three wheels. His horses have the lustre of Kunda (white jasmine) flowers. They are ten in number and they are yoked to the left as well as to the right. The moon traverses by means of this.” Tr. Board of Scholars, Edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.52.50-51 “The chariot of the Moon has three wheels. The horses are tied in pairs on either side. The chariot along with the horses and the charioteer has come out of the womb of the waters. The three wheels have a hundred spokes. Excellent white horses have been yoked thereto. They are ten in number. They are slender and divine. They are unimpeded and have the velocity of the mind. They are yoked but once (in the beginning of the Kalpa) and they travels till the end of the Yugas.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>

<h1><a id="post-6594-13"></a>Speed of Sun moving around the Earth</h1>
<p>Linga Purana Section I.54.9-12 “…Similarly when the sucker of waters (i.e. the sun) moves about in the middle of Puskara the mountain to the north of Manasa, he traverses a thirtieth part of the earth in a Muhurta (48 mts). Understand this number in yojanas travelled in a Muhurta. The speed of the noble souled sun per Muhurta is three million one hundred and fifty thousand yojanas…” Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.50.119-121 “When the sun passes through the middle of the sky, it traverses one thirtieth of the diameter of the earth in a Muhurta (forty eight minutes). In regard to the distance traversed in Yojanas, know that it is three million one hundred and fifty thousand in full. This is the distance traverses by the sun in one Muhurta.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>1 Muhurta = 48 minutes</p>
<p>1 Yojana = 8 miles (as per Hindu translators of Puranas)</p>
<p>3,150,000 Yojana*8 miles = 25,200,000</p>
<p>25,200,000/48 = 525,000 i.e. speed in one minute</p>
<p>525,000*60 = 31,500,000 miles per hour</p>
<p>According to modern science,<br />
“The Sun’s orbital speed around the Galaxy: ~200 km/s (720,000 km/h, 450,000 mph) The speed of the ground beneath your feet, as a result of the Earth’s rotation: 1000 km/h (600 mph) at the latitude of Sheffield (53 degrees); it goes up to 1670 km/h (1000 mph) at the equator.”<br />

<p>The orbital speed of the sun given in Vayu Purana is 31,500,000 mph and the orbital speed of the sun according to science is 450,000 mph which is nowhere close to the speed given in Puranas. Brahmanda Purana mentions a different speed, so let’s have a look at that too,</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana I.2.21.60-65 “…Thus, when the sun traverses the middle of the sky, it passes through parts of the earth in the course of a Muhurta as it were (?) Understand the number of Yojanas here in the course of a Muhurta. It is one hundred and eightyone thousand Yojanas. This is the speed of the sun in a Muhurta.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>181,000*8 = 1,448,000 miles</p>
<p>1,448,000/48 = 30,166 in a minute</p>
<p>30,166*60= 1,810,000 mph</p>
<p>This speed given is also not correct, the speed given in Srimad Bhagavata (Bhagavad Purana) is different so let’s evaluate its authenticity as well,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 5.21.12 “Thus the chariot of the sun-god, which is trayīmaya, or worshiped by the words om bhūr bhuvaḥ svaḥ, travels through the four residences mentioned above at a speed of 3,400,800 yojanas [27,206,400 miles] in a muhūrta.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>mph already given hence,</p>
<p>27,206,400/48 (1 Muhurta) = 566,800</p>
<p>566,800*60= 34,008,000 mph</p>
<p>Whereas the orbital speed of the sun is 450,000 mph.</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 5.21.19 “My dear King, in his orbit through Bhū-maṇḍala, the sun-god traverses a distance of 95,100,000 yojanas [760,800,000 miles] at the speed of 2,000 yojanas and two krośas [16,004 miles] in a moment.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>

<h1><a id="post-6594-14"></a>Moon travels faster than the Sun</h1>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 5.22.8 “Above the rays of the sunshine by a distance of 100,000 yojanas [800,000 miles] is the moon, which travels at a speed faster than that of the sun. In two lunar fortnights the moon travels through the equivalent of a saṁvatsara of the sun, in two and a quarter days it passes through a month of the sun, and in one day it passes through a fortnight of the sun.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>It says that the Moon travels faster than the Sun.</p>
<p>“The Moon orbits Earth at a speed of 2,288 miles per hour (3,683 kilometers per hour). During this time it travels a distance of 1,423,000 miles (2,290,000 kilometers).”</p>

<h1><a id="post-6594-16"></a>Moon has water</h1>
<p>Vayu Purana I.53.57 “The orb of the Moon is of solid water and the orb of the Sun is of solid refulgence.” Tr. G.V. Tagare, Edited by G.P Bhatt</p>
<p>Another Vayu Purana may be saying the same,</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.53.84-86 “Thus the abodes and their resident deities are mentioned. The abode of the thousand rayed Sun is full of fire and sparkling. The abode of the thousand rayed Moon is full of water and sparkling white. The abode of the five rayed charming planet Budha is dark in color.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Linga Purana I.52.3 “The storehouse of water in the sky which is called Soma (moon) is the support of all living beings. To Devas, it is the receptacle of nectar.” Tr. Board of Scholars, Edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana I.2.23.78-79 “The divine spheres of the sun and the moon are sparkling and white. They are of the form (or full of) of fire and water. They move about in the firmament. They resemble auspicious round pots. The sphere of the moon is remembered to be consisting of dense water. The white and brilliantly sparkling sphere of the sun is composed of dense fiery splendour.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Hinduism also says that Moon is born from waters,</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 126.48 “The Moon has been born from waters along with His chariot, horses and the charioteer. That chariot is decorated with fine garlands and yoked with excellent white horses, rests on three wheels.” Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, Edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p><a href="#top">top</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1><a id="post-6594-17"></a>How Full Moon occurs</h1>
<p>According to Hinduism, the Sun fills the moon with a nectar which lasts until 33330 Devas drinks it and turns it dark. The nectar is described as sweet like honey and consisting of the essence of the watery juice. It is the food of the Devas which makes them immortal. Seems this is the Soma Ras.</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.52.60-66 “Beginning with the second day in the dark half and ending with the fourteenth day Devas drink the watery wine, the nectar of the Moon that is essentially made up of water and that by nature consists of tasty essence. By the brilliance of the Sun the nectar is collected and prepared in the course of a fortnight. On the full moon night Devas, Pitrs and the sages attend the Moon facing the Sun. The digits being drunk decline gradually in the dark half and become refilled in the bright half. When days pass on gradually Devas drink the moon for half a month until the new moon day and go away. On the new moon day Pitrs resort to the Moon. When the fifteenth part of the digits is left over in the later part of the day, that part is used up by the groups of Pitrs. The remaining digit is drunk by Pitrs during the period of two Kalas. From the lunar rays the nectar of Svadha comes out on the new moon night. They drink the nectar and remain content for a month. They attain immortality.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 126.53-60 “…in the dark fortnight, the Moon wanes daily from the second day till the Chaturdasi tithi (the fourteenth day after the full Moon) when the Devas drink up the soft and excellent nectar of the Moon, sweet like honey and consisting of the essence of the watery juice. For half the month the nectar becomes stored up in the Moon by the Sun’s ray, so that the Devas would be able to drink it; and the quantity of this nectar becomes maximum on the full moon night when the Devas adore the Moon for another supply of the same, gathered from the Sun’s radiance in course of a fortnight.” Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, Edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 126.61-70 “…From the beginning of the dark fortnight the Moon turns black, wanes and becomes dull; His digits decline owing to His nectar being drunk up day by day. 33330 Devas drink the lunar ambrosia. The Moon thus declines during the dark fortnight and waxes until He becomes complete in the bright fortnight. Thus, drinking the nectar, the Devas, at the end of the fortnight, go away elsewhere on the Amasvasya (dark) night when the Pitris come to Him. When the still small portion of the 15th part of the Moon is left, they drink that in the afternoon on the next day for a brief period of two kalas and go away after the completion of this dark fortnight…” Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, Edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 2.12.1-9 “The radiant sun supplies the moon, when reduced by the draughts of the gods to a single Kalá, with a single ray; and in the same proportion as the ruler of the night was exhausted by the celestials, it is replenished by the sun, the plunderer of the waters: for the gods, Maitreya, drink the nectar and ambrosia accumulated in the moon during half the month, and from this being their food they are immortal. Thirty-six thousand three hundred and thirty-three divinities drink the lunar ambrosia. When two digits remain, the moon enters the orbit of the sun, and abides in the ray called Amá; whence the period is termed Amávásya. In that orbit the moon is immersed for a day and night in the water; thence it enters the branches and shoots of the trees; and thence goes to the sun.” Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>

<p>Vayu Purana I.53.61-62 “…The diameter of the Sun is nine thousand Yojanas. The girth of the Sun is three times its diameter. The width of the Moon is twice that of the Sun.”Tr. G.V. Tagare, Edited by G.P Bhatt</p>

<p>Matsya Purana 123.57-58 “The diameter of the Sun is nine thousand yojanas and its circumference is three times that (2700 yojanas). The diameter of the Moon is twice the diameter of the Sun; its circumference is thrice its diameter.” Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, edited by B.D. Basu</p>

<p>Another scientific blunder, there is no need to provide proof but still for your ease let me present the size of the sun and moon as per science,</p>
<p>Size of the Sun</p>
<p>“The sun is nearly a perfect sphere. Its equatorial diameter and its polar diameter differ by only 6.2 miles (10 km). The mean radius of the sun is 432,450 miles (696,000 kilometers), which makes its diameter about 864,938 miles (1.392 million km). You could line up 109 Earths across the face of the sun. The sun’s circumference is about 2,713,406 miles (4,366,813 km).”</p>

<p>Size of the Moon</p>
<p>“The moon’s mean radius is 1,079.6 miles (1,737.5 kilometers). Double those figures to get its diameter: 2,159.2 miles<br />
(3,475 km). The moon’s equatorial circumference is 6,783.5 miles (10,917 km).</p>
<p>The moon’s surface area is about 14.6 million square miles (38 million square kilometers), which is less than the total surface area of the continent of Asia (17.2 million sq mi or 44.5 million sq km).”</p>

<p>Both the Sun and the Moon revolves around the Earth as per Hinduism and since the moon appears bigger to the naked eye than the sun so the Rishis may have thought that moon must be bigger in size than the sun.</p>
<p>Swami Prabhupada the founder of ISKCON stated that moon is farther than the sun and also considered moon landing to be an hoax,</p>
<p>“Another my challenge is that moon is beyond the sun. First planet is sun, and then moon. So if the sun is 93,000,000 miles and moon is above the sun 1,600,000, then how they can go to the moon planet in four days? It requires seven and a half months. That is my challenge.”<br />

<p>Size of the Earth,</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana I.2.21.12 “…The entire Earth is remembered as fifty crores (of Yojanas) in extent.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 2.4.18 “…Such, Maitreya, is the earth, which with its continents, mountains, oceans, and exterior shell, is fifty crores (five hundred millions) of Yojanas in extent…” Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>500000000*8 = 4000000000 miles</p>
<p>And this number is nowhere close to the number proved by modern science, this number doesn’t match with either Earth’s radius or diameter.</p>
<p>“The radius of Earth at the equator is 3,963 miles (6,378 kilometers), according to NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center. However, Earth is not quite a sphere. The planet’s rotation causes it to bulge at the equator. Earth’s polar radius is 3,949 miles (6,356 km) — a difference of 14 miles (22 km).</p>
<p>Using those measurements, the equatorial circumference of Earth is about 24,900 miles (40,070 km). However, from pole-to-pole — the meridional circumference — Earth is only 24,812 miles (39,931 km) around. This shape, caused by the flattening at the poles, is called an oblate spheroid.”<br />

<p>Brahmanda Purana I.2.21.69 “The circumference of the sun is estimated to be nine crores of Yojanas as well as fortyfive hundred thousands (i.e. 9,45,00000 Yojanas).” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana I.2.21.7 “The extent of the disc of the sun is nine thousand Yojanas. Its girth is three times the extent.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>The same book gives contradictory numbers, let’s evaluate both numbers,</p>
<p>9 crores of Yojanas is the circumference of the Sun as per Brahmana Purana,</p>
<p>90,000,000*8= 720,000,000 miles</p>
<p>9,45,00000*8= 756,000,000 miles</p>
<p>As per the second verse,</p>

<p>Size of Venus, Jupiter, Mars and Saturn. The size is given in ratios and not Yojanas and one can easily find the error in this when it says that Jupiter is less than Venus when Jupiter is the biggest planet of our solar system,</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana I.2.23.104-6; Matsya Purana 128.64-65 “The diameter and extent of the sphere of Bhargava (the Venus) it laid down as one sixteenth of that of the moon. Brhaspati (the Jupiter) should be known as one-fourth less than the Venus (i.e. three fourth of its size). The Mars and Saturn are remembered to be three fourths of Jupiter in extent. In diameter and extent, Mercury is three-fourths of either of them.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>The mean radius of moon in kilometres is 1737 divided by 16 is 108 kilometres, so Brahmanda and Matsya Purana are saying that the mean radius of Venus is 108 km when the actual mean radius of Venus is much bigger than the moon, the mean radius of Venus is 6051 km. Linga Purana gives different sizes of planets, I will just present the verse to you.</p>
<p>Linga Purana I.57.13-15 “The diameter, the circumference and the distance in yojanas of Bhargava (Venus) is a sixteenth part of that of the moon. Brhaspati (Jupiter) is of three-fourths of the size of Venus. Mars and Saturn are three-fourths of the size of Brhaspati. Budha (Mercury) is three-fourths of their size in extent and circumference.” Tr. Board of Scholars, Edited by J.L. Shastri</p>

<p>Swami Prabhupada the founder of ISKCON writes on the next verse i.e., 13<sup>th</sup> verse,</p>
<p>“From the descriptions in this verse, we can make an educated guess about the nature of the flames on the moon. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><u>Like the sun, the moon must also be full of flames because without flames there cannot be illumination</u></span>. The flames on the moon, however, unlike those on the sun, must be mild and pleasing. This is our conviction. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><u>The modern theory that the moon is full of dust is not accepted in the verses of Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</u></span>. In regard to this verse, Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura says, suśaṣpāṇi sukomala-śikhās teṣāṁ rociṣā: the kuśa grass illuminates all directions, but its flames are very mild and pleasing. This gives some idea of the flames existing on the moon.” Swami Prabhupada on Srimad Bhagavatam 5.20.13<br />

<h1><a id="post-6594-22"></a>What causes hoarfrost/dew drops?</h1>
<p>Hinduism says that four elephants of the four quarters spraying water from their huge trunks causes hoarfrost. Or it may be referring to a cloud who could take shape of any. But I am sure that it talks about the elephants that’s holding up the earth because the 43rd verse states that “Elephants, mountains and clouds along with serpents belong to one and the same family” had it been a type of cloud then this verse wouldn’t have separated elephants from clouds and also the Brahmanda Purana makes it more clear.</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.51.45-47 “During Hemanta (early winter) Parjanya and the elephants of the quarters born of chilliness shower snow (drops) for making the corn flourish…The elephants of the quarters spray all round drops of water from the Ganga by means of their huge trunks. That (spray of water) is called the hoarfrost.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 2.9.16-18 “…the water, although that of the Gangá of the sky, is scattered, by the elephants of the quarters, not by the rays of the sun: it is only when such rain falls, and the sun is in the even asterisms, that it is distributed by his beams.” Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana I.2.22.47-52a “Smoke is conducive to development of all of them without any distinction. The most excellent among them is Parjanya. The Elephants of the quarters are four in number (Although) these are separate, the source of origin of elephants, mountains, clouds and serpents is the same and water is remembered as that origin. On being directed to make the plants and trees flourish, Parjanya and the Diggajas (Elephants of the quarters) showers snowdrops during Hemanta (early winter), born of cool virility. …With their huge trunks, the elephants of the quarters receive the waters oozing from the Ganga and scatter them in the form of water spray. That is remembered as dew drops.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>

<h1><a id="post-6594-23"></a>Sun emits different types of rays which are responsible for changes in Season</h1>
<p>As the Earth spins on its axis, producing night and day, it also moves about the Sun in an elliptical (elongated circle) orbit that requires 365 1/4 days to complete. The Earth’s axis is tilted at 23.5 degrees and is why we have seasons. When the Earth’s axis points towards the Sun, it is summer for that hemisphere. When the Earth’s axis points away, winter can be expected.</p>
<p>But according to Vedic Science we have seasons because the sun emits different types and specific number of rays and changes them to cause different seasons.</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana 1.2.24.32-33 “During Vasanta (spring) and Grisma (summer), the sun blazes by means of three hundred rays. During the rainy season and autumn he showers (rain) by means of four hundred rays. During Hemanta (early winter) and Sisira (later winter), he scatters snow by means of three hundred rays.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Linga Purana I.59.41-45 “…The thousand rays of the sun serve the purpose of the world. Reaching the earth they assume different forms by emitting snow, rain and heat…” Tr. Board of Scholars, Edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.52.36 “In accordance with the seasons, the Sun changes his rays, releasing heat in the summer, mist and fog in the winter and rain during the rainy season and demarcates day and night. He (thus) propitiates Devas, Pitrs and human beings.” Tr. G.V. Tagare, Edited by G.P Bhatt</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.53.25-27; Linga Purana I.59.31a-31b “During the spring and the summer he blazes with the three hundred rays. During rains and autumn he generates rain by the four (hundred rays). The Sun creates mist and fog by means of the three (hundred rays) during early and late winter. He deposits energy on the medicinal herbs. By means of Svadha he propitiates Pitrs. By means of nectar of three varieties he bestows immorality. Thus thousand rays of the Sun achieve the purpose of the worlds. They differ according to the season by exuding water, chilliness and heat.” Tr. G.V. Tagare, Edited by G.P Bhatt</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 128.24-25 “During spring and hot weather the sun imparts heat by his three hundred rays; during the rainy season and autumn causes rain by his four hundred rays; during the dewy and winter season imparts cold by his three hundred rays.” Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, Edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana also says that Sun moves in medium speed to make day and night equal in Autumn and Spring seasons,</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana I.2.21.142 “During the time in between the Autumn and the Spring, the sun proceeds with a medium speed and he resorts to its eastern peak.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>

<h1><a id="post-6594-24"></a>Moon causes rain</h1>
<p>Hindu scriptures correctly says that the sun takes up the water through rays but also makes an unscientific claim that the water is transferred to moon which then sends it to clouds (perhaps to Abhra clouds) that causes rain, some also say that the cloud named Abhra doesn’t cause rainfall while Linga Purana I.54.39-40 states that Abhra means ‘that which showers water’.</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana I.2.22.13-21 “…the sun takes away the water of the entire world, O excellent Brahmanas. The moon transmits the entire water drunk by the sun. The torrential currents of water (Downpour of rain) functions through Nadis (vein like vessels) accompanied by the wind. The water that oozes out of the moon remains in the food (i.e. plants and food crops). The water that has fallen down from the moon, from the sky, is conducive to the welfare of all the worlds. The entire universe has the moon as its support. This has been truthfully recounted. The Usna (hot virility) oozes out of the sun, and the Sita (chill virility) functions from the moon.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Linga Purana Section I.54.29-33 “The waters drunk by the sun penetrates the moon gradually and from the moon they drip down to the clouds. On being tossed about by the wind, the cluster of clouds causes shower on the earth…” Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.51.14-15 “The water drunk in by the sun gets transferred to the moon from the solar fire. Through the Nadis (tubular veins) full of wind the activity of sustaining the worlds begins. What exudes from the moon, the sun receives at its tips. When the wind blows the clouds let it shower on the earth.” Tr. G.V. Tagare, Edited by G.P Bhatt</p>
<p>Aitareya Brahmana Book 8, Para 28 “…The rain having rained enters into the moon…” Tr. Arthur Berriedale Keith</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 2.9.8-18 “…The sun with his scorching rays absorbs the moisture of the earth, and with them nourishes the moon. The moon communicates, through tubes of air, its dews to the clouds, which, being composed of smoke, fire, and wind (or vapour), can retain the waters with which they are charged: they are therefore called Abhras, because their contents are not dispersed When however they are broken to pieces by the wind, then watery stores descend, bland, and freed front every impurity by the sweetening process of time…” Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Linga Purana mentions strange water cycle,</p>
<p>Linga Purana I.54.65-68 “There is neither increase nor decrease of water, if we consider it duly. The wind presided over by Dhruva withdraws the rain. It falls off the planet sun and spreads through the sphere of the stars. At the close of the movement, it re-enters the sun and is presided over by Dhruva.” Tr. Board of Scholars, Edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Dhurva means Pole Star.</p>

<h1><a id="post-6594-25"></a>Unique way to cause rain</h1>
<p>A Hindu MP of India was ridiculed for saying that <a href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/smoke-from-yajna-goes-up-rainfall-comes-down-bjp-mps-formula-to-check-drought/1/666277.html" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Smoke from Yajna goes up, rainfall comes down<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. But what people may not be knowing is that he said this on the basis of Hindu scriptures, so those making fun of this statement should also make fun of Hindu scriptures which promotes such unscientific things,</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 2.16 “We perform the yajna for Vasus, Rudras and Adityas…The desired oblation (Ahuti) reaches the space, comes in contact with air and the light of that sun. It thence brings down rain for us…” Tr. Devi Chand</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 3.49 “The oblation full of cooked articles put into the fire, goes up to the sky. And returns there from full of rain.” Tr. Devi Chand</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 3.76. An oblation duly thrown into the fire, reaches the sun; from the sun comes rain, from rain food, therefrom the living creatures (derive their subsistence).</p>
<p>Maitrayana Brahmana 6.37 … ‘The oblation which is properly thrown on the fire, goes toward the sun; from the sun comes rain…”</p>

<h1><a id="post-6594-26"></a>What causes Earthquakes and who lifts the Earth?</h1>
<p>Valmiki Ramayana says that four elephants are holding up the earth and if the easterly elephant namely Viruupaaksha moves its trunk then earthquakes occurs on earth,</p>
<p>Valmiki Ramayana 1.40.13-22 “While digging the earth there they beheld a mountain similar easterly elephant named Viruupaaksha, which is bearing the eastern side of earth’s surface on its head. Oh, Rama, the legatee of Raghu, that great easterly elephant Viruupaaksha is bearing the entire eastern earth along with its mountains and forests on its head. On certain occasions, oh, Rama of Kakutstha, when that great-elephant moves its head desiring respite in tiresomeness then earthquakes will occur on earth. After splitting the eastern direction then they split opened the southern direction, and even in southern direction they beheld an elephant that is similar to a very great mountain, and that is sustaining southerly side of earth on its head, and on seeing that mammoth elephant of venerable character, namely Mahapadma, they went into an inordinate astonishment. Even in the westerly direction those great mighty sons of Sagara beheld an infinite and mountain similar elephant of western direction, called Sumanasa. In the northern direction, oh, Rama, they beheld Bhadra, a snow-white elephant with an auspicious body bearing northern side of this earth.” Tr. Shri Desiraju Hanumanta Rao</p>
<p>6th century Indian astronomer named Varahamihira also writes about this,</p>
<p>क्षितिकंम्पमाहुरेके बृहदन्तर्जलनिवासिसत्वकृतम् ।<br />
भूभारखिन्नदिग्गजविश्रामसमुद्भवं चान्ये ॥१॥<br />
Brihatsamhita 32.1 “Some hold that an earth-quake is caused by huge animals living in the midst of the ocean, while others opine that it is the result of the rest that is availed of by the elephants of the quarters tired by the weight of the earth.” Tr. Panditbhushan V. Subrahmanya Shastri &amp; Vidwan M. Ramkrishna Bhat</p>
<p>I quoted it to show that elephants holding up the earth is literal and not simile and this view was widely held by Hindus even in the 6th century. Vishnu Purana says that Vishnu in the form of a snake named Shesha is holding up the world and the earth trembles if he yawns,</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 2.5.20-25 “…Śesha bears the entire world, like a diadem, upon his head, and he is the foundation on which the seven Pátálas rest. His power, his glory, his form, his nature, cannot be described, cannot he comprehended by the gods themselves. Who shall recount his might, who wears this whole earth, like a garland of flowers, tinged of a purple dye by the radiance of the jewels of his crests. When Ananta, his eyes rolling with intoxication, yawns, then earth, with all her woods, and mountains, and seas, and rivers, trembles…” Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Shiva Purana says that earthquakes occurs when Shesha stretches himself,<br />
Shiva Purana, Uma Samhita 5, chapter 15, verses 18-21 “Holding the sphere of the earth on his back, Sesa, the lord of Bhutas stands at the root of Patala. He is worshipped for his endless attributes. The power of his virility cannot be adequately described even by the ambitious gods nor can his form be known…With his eyes rolling due to inebriation when Sesa stretches himself, the earth quakes along with all its mountains, oceans and forests.” Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam and Devi Bhagavatam also says that four elephants are holding up the universe,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 5.20.39 “On the top of Lokāloka Mountain are the four gaja-patis, the best of elephants, which were established in the four directions by Lord Brahmā, the supreme spiritual master of the entire universe. The names of those elephants are Ṛṣabha, Puṣkaracūḍa, Vāmana and Aparājita. They are responsible for maintaining the planetary systems of the universe.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 8.14.1-29 “…The self-born Brahmâ has placed very big elephants on all sides of it. Hear their names. These are Risabha, Puspachûda, Vâmana, and Aparâjita. These four elephants are said to hold all the Lokas in their respective positions. The Bhagavân Hari gives strength to these elephants and to Indra and others who are reckoned to be His Vibhûtis (powers)…” Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam also says that Vishnu in the form of a dolphin or Gigantic porpoise is holding up the universe or earth,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 5.23.4 “Some persons describe this system of heavenly luminaries as being supported by the mystical Yogic powers of Lord Vasudeva who has assumed the form of a Gangetic porpoise.” Tr. G.V. Tagare, Edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Mahabharata and Puranas says that a snake named Shesha is holding up the Earth and that’s the reason snakes are found in the ground,</p>
<p>Mahabharata 3.202.12-13 “…then lay in Yoga sleep on the wide hood of the Snake Sesha of immeasurable energy, and the Creator of the Universe, that highly-blessed and holy Hari, knowing no deterioration, lay on the hood of that Snake encircling the whole Earth…” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 5.25.2 “Śukadeva Gosvāmī continued: This great universe, situated on one of Lord Anantadeva’s thousands of hoods, appears just like a white mustard seed. It is infinitesimal compared to the hood of Lord Ananta.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Mahabharata describes how Adishesha held the earth, I am quoting some excerpts from the section,</p>
<p>Mahabharata1.36.17-25 “Then Sesha replied, ‘O divine Grandsire, this is the boon desired by me; viz., may my heart always delight in virtue and in blessed ascetic penances, O Lord of all!’ Brahman said, ‘O Sesha, I am exceedingly gratified with this thy self-denial and love of peace. But, at my command, let this act be done by thee for the good of my creatures. Bear thou, O Sesha, properly and well this Earth so unsteady with her mountains and forests, her seas and towns and retreats, so that she may be steady.’ Sesha said, ‘O divine Lord of all creatures, O bestower of boons, O lord of the Earth, lord of every created thing, lord of the universe, I will, even as thou sayest hold the Earth steady. Therefore, O lord of all creatures, place her on my head.’ Brahman said, ‘O best of snakes, go underneath the Earth. She will herself give thee a crevice to pass through. And, O Sesha, by holding the Earth, thou shalt certainly do what is prized by me very greatly…Then the elder brother of the king of the snakes, entering a hole, passed to the other side of the Earth, and holding her, supported with his head that goddess with her belt of seas passing all round.’ Brahman said, ‘O Sesha, O best of snakes, thou art the god Dharma, because alone, with thy huge body, thou supportest the Earth with everything on her, even as I myself, or Valavit (Indra), can…The snake, Sesha, the lord Ananta, of great prowess, lives underneath the Earth, alone supporting the world at the command of Brahman. And the illustrious Grandsire, the best of the immortals, then gave unto Ananta the bird of fair feathers, viz., the son of Vinata, for Ananta’s help.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Swami Prabhupada wrote,</p>
<p>“The incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead known as Śeṣa or Ananta has unlimited strength, fame, wealth, knowledge, beauty and renunciation. As described in this verse, Ananta’s strength is so great that the innumerable universes rest on His hoods. He has the bodily features of a snake with thousands of hoods, and since His strength is unlimited, all the universes resting on His hoods feel no heavier than mustard seeds. We can just imagine how insignificant a mustard seed is on the hood of a serpent. In this connection, the reader is referred to Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta, Ādi-līlā, Chapter Five, verses 117-125. There it is stated that Lord Viṣṇu’s incarnation as the serpentine Ananta Śeṣa Nāga supports all the universes on His hoods. By our calculation, a universe may be very, very heavy, but because the Lord is ananta (unlimited), He feels the weight to be no heavier than a mustard seed.” <strong>Swami Prabhupada 5.17.21</strong> <a href="https://www.vedabase.com/en/sb/5/17/21" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">https://www.vedabase.com/en/sb/5/17/21<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>Vishnu Purana book 2, chapter 5 states that Sesha is a form of Vishnu but Mahabharata says that Sesha is a form of Shiva,</p>
<p>Mahabharata 13.14.151 “…Mahadeva is the soul of all creatures. He pervades all things. He is the speaker of all discourses (on duties and rituals)…He it is that assumes the form of Sesha who sustains the world on his head…”</p>
<p>It’s not just elephant, snake or dolphin that is holding up the earth, Hindu scriptures also says that Vishnu in the form of a boar is holding up the earth and also saving it from sinking in waters. The following topic is also related to this one.</p>
<p><a href="#top">top</a></p>

<h1><a id="post-6594-27"></a>Earth established on waters</h1>

<p>Scientists are spending billions of dollars to find water on other planets but Vishnu’s avatar Varaha found water below the earth some 3000 years ago and also saved the earth from sinking into that water. The story of Varaha lifting up the earth in Puranas may have taken inspiration from Brahmanas,</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana 14:1:2:11 “Then (earth) torn up by a boar (he takes), with (Vâg. S. XXXVII, 5), &#8216;Only thus large was she in the beginning,&#8217;&#8211;for, indeed, only so large was this earth in the beginning, of the size of a span. A boar, called Emûsha, raised her up, and he was her lord Pragâpati: with that mate, his heart&#8217;s delight, he thus supplies and completes him 1;&#8211;&#8216;may I this day compass for you Makha&#8217;s head on the Earth&#8217;s place of divine worship: for Makha thee! for Makha&#8217;s head thee!&#8217; the import of this is the same as before.” Tr. Julius Eggeling</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, VayaviyaSamhita 7, Section I.11.31 “The he lifted the Earth sunk under water and held it on his curved fangs. He rose up from the nether worlds.” Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Harivamsha Purana 3.35.1 “(O janamejaya!) The earth which was installed on the top surface of the water body, did not sink, like a huge ship, due to its vast body.” Tr. Desiraju Hanumant Rao</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.50.7 “Waters lie within the earth and the earth is established over waters. The sky is above, the earth is below (it) and again waters are underneath.” Tr. G.V. Tagare, Edited by G.P Bhatt</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana I.I.5.10 On seeing that the earth had sunk into the water he thought- ”What form shall I assume and uplift the earth?”[15] Assuming this inimitable form of a boar, Hari entered the nether worlds for uplifting the earth.</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 3.13.31 “Lord Boar very easily took the earth on His tusks and got it out of the water. Thus He appeared very splendid. Then, His anger glowing like the Sudarśana wheel, He immediately killed the demon [Hiraṇyākṣa], although he tried to fight with the Lord.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 8.2.34-38 “…He came up from the Rasâtala and placed the earth on the waters. He then went away to His Vaikuntha abode…” Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 8.2.11-20 “The ocean was very much agitated with the fierce striking of the hairs of the Boar, when He entered into the waters, and spoke thus :– “O Deva ! O Thou, the destroyer of the afflictions of your refuges! Protect me.” Hearing the words of the ocean, the God Hari tore asunder all the aquatic animals and went down beneath the waters. Searching violently hither and thither, He knew the earth by her smell. At once the Bhagavân Hari, the Lord of all, went to Her and rescued the earth by raising Her up on his big teeth, the Earth that was the abode of all the beings. When the Bhagavân, the Lord of all the sacrifices, came up with the Earth on the top of His teeth, He looked beautiful like the elephant of a quarter taking out by the root and holding a thousand petalled lotus upon his tusks.” Tr. Swami Vijnananada</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 1.4.45-48 “The supreme being thus eulogized, upholding the earth, raised it quickly, and placed it on the summit of the ocean, where it floats like a mighty vessel, and from its expansive surface does not sink beneath the waters. Then, having levelled the earth, the great eternal deity divided it into portions, by mountains…” Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Harivamsa Purana 1.40.6 “We have heard that sage Krishna-dwaipAyana described this great boar incarnation before the twice-born ones when they assembled at a sacrifice, and detailed as to how that enemy-eradicator, Vishnu, incarnating himself as a boar, saved the earth sunk in the ocean with his tusks; now I would like to hear at length the various deeds performed by the intelligent slayer of enemies hari in his incarnation of boar.” Tr. Desiraju Hanumanta Rao</p>
<p>I remember, when I had posted a meme on my Facebook account about Varaha lifting up the Earth from waters, a Hindu tried to explain it by saying that the water mentioned in Purana is not actually water and later gave a lame explanation. Those who try to give “water” a metaphorical meaning should read following verses which refutes their claim,</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.6.10-27 ”Observing that the earth was overflowed with waters on all sides, (he thought to himself), ”Oh, what great form should I assume and uplift the earth”? He thought of the form of a Boar charmingly comfortable in sporting about in waters…It had a girth of ten and a height of a hundred Yojanas. It resembled a dark blue cloud in complexion. It grunted like the rumbling of thunder-clouds…Assuming this large immeasurable form of a boar, Visnu entered the nether regions in order to lift up the earth…. [25-27] Holding the Earth in his hands he brought it to its place. The supporter of the Earth at first mentally supported the earth and then released it. Over the flood of waters, the Earth floated like an immense boat. Due to the activities of the lord, it did not sink. With a desire to set up the universe, the lord lifted up the Earth. Then, he, the lotus-eyed lord, decided to divide the Earth. He levelled the Earth and created the mountains on it.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>

<h1><a id="post-6594-28"></a>Distance between Planets</h1>
<p>Brahma Purana 21.5-9 “O brahmins, the disc of the sun is stationed a hundred thousand Yojanas away from the earth. The disc of the moon is stationed a hundred thousand Yojanas away from the sun. Full hundred thousand Yojanas above the moon, the entire sphere of the stars shines. O brahmins, mercury (Budha) is two hundred thousand Yojanas above the sphere of stars…Saturn (Sauri) is stationed two hundred thousand Yojanas above Jupiter…” Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>The above verse says that the sun is a hundred thousand Yojanas away from the earth, so let’s do the calculation now,</p>
<p>1 Yojana = 8 miles</p>
<p>100,000*8= 800,000 miles</p>
<p>Distance between Earth and the Sun as per science</p>

<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 5.22.8 “Similarly the Moon is observed to be a hundred thousand Yojanas above the rays (orb) of the Sun. As it is faster in velocity (than the sun), it goes ahead (of the Sun). It covers in two fortnights the circuit made by the Sun in one (complete) year; in two days and a quarter of that distance which the Sun traverses in a month; and in one day the distance the Sun requires a fortnight to cover.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>The distance between Moon and Sun mentioned in Srimad Bhagavatam is same as mentioned in Brahma Purana 21.5-9, so now let’s calculate the distance,</p>
<p>100,000*8= 800,000 miles</p>
<p>“The moon is 93205678.8356 miles away from the sun which is 150 million kilometres.”<br />

<p>Distance between Planets,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 5.22.14-17 “Situated 1,600,000 miles above Mercury, or 8,800,000 miles above earth, is the planet Mars. If this planet does not travel in a crooked way, it crosses through each sign of the zodiac in three fortnights and in this way travels through all twelve, one after another. It almost always creates unfavorable conditions in respect to rainfall and other influences. Situated 1,600,000 miles above Mars, or 10,400,000 miles above earth, is the planet Jupiter, which travels through one sign of the zodiac within the period of a Parivatsara. If its movement is not curved, the planet Jupiter is very favorable to the brāhmaṇas of the universe. Situated 1,600,000 miles above Jupiter, or 12,000,000 miles above earth, is the planet Saturn, which passes through one sign of the zodiac in thirty months and covers the entire zodiac circle in thirty Anuvatsaras. This planet is always very inauspicious for the universal situation. Situated 8,800,000 miles above Saturn, or 20,800,000 miles above earth, are the seven saintly sages, who are always thinking of the well-being of the inhabitants of the universe. They circumambulate the supreme abode of Lord Viṣṇu, known as Dhruvaloka, the polestar.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Above verse says that Mercury is 1,600,000 miles above Mars while according to science, The distance between Mercury and Mars is 1.14 AU. That’s approximately 170,030,000 km or 105,651,744 miles. It also says that Earth is 8,800,000 miles away from Mars while Earth is 0.52 AU away from Mars. That’s approximately 78,340,000 km or 48,678,219 miles.<br />

<p>It also makes the claim that “Situated 1,600,000 miles above Mars, or 10,400,000 miles above earth, is the planet Jupiter”</p>
<p>While as per science the distance between Mars and Jupiter is 3.68 AU. That’s approximately 550,390,000 km or 342,012,346 miles. And the distance between Earth and Jupiter is 4.2 AU. That’s approximately 628,730,000 km or 390,674,710 miles.<br />

<p>It then makes claim that “Situated 1,600,000 miles above Jupiter, or 12,000,000 miles above earth, is the planet Saturn”</p>
<p>While the fact is, The distance between Saturn and Jupiter is 4.32 AU. That’s approximately 646,270,000 km or 401,592,178 miles and the distance between Saturn and Earth is 8.52 AU. That’s approximately 1,275,000,000 km or 792,248,270 miles.</p>

<p>Following verses from Srimad Bhagavatam 5.22.12-13 are related to this subject. It makes the claim that Mercury is 1,600,000 miles above Venus or 7,200,000 miles above earth. While the distance between Mercury and Venus is 0.34 AU. That’s approximately 50,290,000 km or 31,248,757 miles. And the distance between Mercury and Earth is 0.61 AU. That’s approximately 91,691,000 km or 56,974,146 miles.<br />

<h1><a id="post-6594-29"></a>Sun, Venus and Mercury has same Orbits</h1>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 5.22.12 “Some 1,600,000 miles above this group of stars is the planet Venus, which moves at almost exactly the same pace as the sun according to swift, slow and moderate movements. Sometimes Venus moves behind the sun, sometimes in front of the sun and sometimes along with it. Venus nullifies the influence of planets that are obstacles to rainfall. Consequently its presence causes rainfall, and it is therefore considered very favorable for all living beings within this universe. This has been accepted by learned scholars.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 5.22.13 “Mercury is described to be similar to Venus, in that it moves sometimes behind the sun, sometimes in front of the sun and sometimes along with it. It is 1,600,000 miles above Venus, or 7,200,000 miles above earth. Mercury, which is the son of the moon, is almost always very auspicious for the inhabitants of the universe, but when it does not move along with the sun, it forbodes cyclones, dust, irregular rainfall, and waterless clouds. In this way it creates fearful conditions due to inadequate or excessive rainfall.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>

<h1><a id="post-6594-31"></a>Planets move propelled by the rope of wind</h1>
<p>Hinduism says that planets move due to wind as Hinduism believes that there is air in space,</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 128.14 “All these stars are tied to Dhruva: and they move on propelled by the wind. The Moon and the Sun move on in the celestial firmament, prompted by currents of strong wind. They glide on tied to the Dhruva. Their motions round the pole are brought about by these ropes made of wind.” Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, Edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>Linga Purana I.57.7 “The stars and the luminaries, urged by the circular gusts of wind, move like fire brands. Since the wind bears the luminaries, it is called Pravaha.” Tr. Board of Scholars, Edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p><a href="#top">top</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1><a id="post-6594-32"></a>Wind stars from Sun</h1>
<p>Vayu Purana I.51.53 “The wind starts from the planet sun and traverses the entire stellar zone. At the end of the day it enters the sun encompassed by Dhruva.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p><a href="#top">top</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1><a id="post-6594-33"></a>Sun and Moon dipping in water</h1>
<p>Vamana Purana 16.53 “Burnt by the fire of the eyes of Siva, the restless Surya immersed in the Asi and reaching Varuna, he had a dip in it as freely as he like.” Tr. Ananda Swarup Gupta</p>
<p>Rig Veda 7.55.7, Atharva Veda 4.5.1 The Bull [Vushab/Sun] who hath a thousand horns, who rises up from out the sea…</p>
<p>Kausitaki Brahmana 18.9 Him who yonder gives heat they seek by these pressings to obtain; the rising by the morning pressing, (the sun) in the middle (of his course) by the midday pressing, (the sun) as he sets by the third pressing. He, having entered the waters, becomes Varuna.</p>
<p>Aitareya Brahma Book 4, Chapter 20, verse 13 “…This (Aditya, the sun) is ‘the swan sitting in light’…he is ‘born from the waters’ (abja), for in the morning he comes out of the waters, and in the evening he enters the waters.” Tr. Martin Haug</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 2.12.8-9 “whence the period is termed Amávásya. In that orbit the moon is immersed for a day and night in the water; thence it enters the branches and shoots of the trees; and thence goes to the sun.” Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 13.2.4 “Victorious, inspired, and brightly shining, whom seven strong tawny-coloured coursers carry, Whom Atri lifted from the flood to heaven, thus men behold thee as thy course thou runnest.” Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.72.7 “When, O ye Gods, like Yatis, ye caused all existing things to grow, Then ye brought Sūrya forward who was lying hidden in the sea.” Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>Hinduism also says that the sun enters fire while setting, I don’t understand this verse so I leave it to the readers to understand it.</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.50.112-3 “When the sun sets, the brilliance of the sun partially enters fire. Hence fire shines more brilliantly at night, even from a distance. When the sun rises again, the brilliance of fire enters the sun. The sun rises again, the brilliance of fire enters the sun. This together with the brillaince left in the sun at the time of sunset, makes it all the more brilliant. So the sun blazes during the day.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>

<h1><a id="post-6594-34"></a>How Eclipse occurs</h1>
<p>According to Vedic mythology a demon covers the Sun which causes solar eclipse.</p>
<p>Rig Veda 5.40.5-6 O Sūrya, when the Asura’s descendant Svarbhanu, pierced thee through and through with darkness, All creatures looked like one who is bewildered, who knoweth not the place where he is standing. What time thou smotest down Svarbhanu’s magic that spread itself beneath the sky, O Indra, By his fourth sacred prayer Atri disoovered Sūrya concealed in gloom that stayed his function.</p>
<p>Following verses may have taken inspiration from the above Vedic verse. A demon named Rahu which is a star according to Hinduism causes Solar and Lunar eclipses.</p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 8.18.1-9 “…The Asura Râhu thus covers his rays. So the sphere of the Moon extends upto the twelve thousand Yoyanas. Râhu covers the field of the thirteen thousand Yoyanas. So he covers both the Sun and the Moon. Desire to take the vengeance of the previous enmity, he covers them during the time of Parva (the festivals). This planet wants to cover them from a distance. Hearing this, the Bhagavân Visnu hurls His Sudars’an Chakra against Râhu. This Chakra (disc) is encircled with the fiery flames and is very terrible. When all the quarters were filled with its violent flames, Râhu became instantly alarmed and fled away from the distance. O Devarsi! This is known as the eclipse known amongst the mortals…” Tr. Swami Vijananda</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 5.24.1-3 “Śrī Śukadeva Gosvāmī said: My dear King, some historians, the speakers of the Purāṇas, say that 10,000 yojanas [80,000 miles] below the sun is the planet known as Rāhu, which moves like one of the stars. The presiding deity of that planet, who is the son of Siṁhikā, is the most abominable of all asuras, but although he is completely unfit to assume the position of a demigod or planetary deity, he has achieved that position by the grace of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Later I shall speak further about him. Rāhu tried to create dissension between the sun and moon by interposing himself between them. Rāhu is inimical toward both the sun and the moon, and therefore he always tries to cover the sunshine and moonshine on the dark-moon day and full-moon night…After hearing from the sun and moon demigods about Rāhu’s attack, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Viṣṇu, engages His disc, known as the Sudarśana cakra, to protect them. The Sudarśana cakra is the Lord’s most beloved devotee and is favored by the Lord. The intense heat of its effulgence, meant for killing non-Vaiṣṇavas, is unbearable to Rāhu, and he therefore flees in fear of it. During the time Rāhu disturbs the sun or moon, there occurs what people commonly know as an eclipse.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Swami Prabhupada writes on Srimad Bhagavatam 5.24.2-3 “As stated herein, the sun extends for 10,000 yojanas, and the moon extends for twice that, or 20,000 yojanas. The word dvādaśa should be understood to mean twice as much as ten, or twenty. In the opinion of Vijayadhvaja, the extent of Rāhu should be twice that of the moon, or 40,000 yojanas. However to reconcile this apparent contradiction to the text of the Bhāgavatam, Vijayadhvaja cites the following quotation concerning Rāhu; rāhu-soma-ravīṇāṁ tu maṇḍalā dvi-guṇoktitām. This means that Rāhu is twice as large as the moon, which is twice as large as the sun. This is the conclusion of the commentator Vijayadhvaja. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Viṣṇu, is always the protector of His devotees, who are also known as demigods. The controlling demigods are most obedient to Lord Viṣṇu, although they also want material sense enjoyment, and that is why they are called demigods, or almost godly. Although Rāhu attempts to attack both the sun and the moon, they are protected by Lord Viṣṇu. Being very afraid of Lord Viṣṇu’s cakra, Rāhu cannot stay in front of the sun or moon for more than a muhūrta (forty-eight minutes). The phenomenon that occurs when Rāhu blocks the light of the sun or moon is called an eclipse. The attempt of the scientists of this earth to go to the moon is as demoniac as Rāhu’s attack. Of course. their attempts will be failures because no one can enter the moon or sun so easily. Like the attack of Rāhu, such attempts will certainly be failures.” <strong>Swami Prabhupada on Srimad Bhagavatam 5.24.2-3<br />

<p>Linga Purana I.54.39-40 “…The cloud originating from sacrificial smoke is conducive to the welfare of the twice born. The cloud originating from the smoke of the forest fires, is conducive to the welfare of the forests.” Tr. Board of Scholars, Edited by J.L. Shastri</p>

<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 8.12.32-33 “While running after her, the semen of Siva of unfailing procreative capacity, went on escaping like that of a big bull leader of a herd pursuing a fecundable cow or as that of a rutting leader elephant running after a fertilizable she-elephant. Oh ruler of the earth! The various places on earth where the seed of that great souled god fell, became the areas of silver and gold ores. Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>

<h1> How mountains were formed</h1>
<p>Brahmanda Purana 1.2.7.9b-11 &#8220;As the previous creation was being burned formerly by the Samvartaka fire, the mountains of that period had been melted by that fire. They were then scattered by the wind. Due to chillness, they became solidified. Wherever the (molten rocks) were split there arose mountain. They are called Acalas (not-moving or immobile)&#8230;&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Vayu Purana 7- &#8220;On seeing the earth fully engulfed in waters, he entered the waters after assuming the form of a Boar. After lifting up the earth from the waters, he deposited the waters of the oceans in the oceans, of the rivers in the rivers and of the earth on the earth. Then he collected the mountains. When the previous creation was being burnt by the Samvartaka, fire of dissolution, the mountains lay destroyed and (scattered) all over the earth. In that one vast ocean, the (solidified) waters tossed by wind got collected together due to cold. Wherever they were (thus) stuck (heaped) together, there they became immovable. The mountains are called Acalas because they become motionless after being dried up and solidified&#8230;&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare, edited by G.P. Bhatt</p>
<h1>What are the stars?</h1>
<p>Virtuous men become stars,</p>
<p>Black Yajur Veda 5.4.1.3 “…these are the lights of the sky; verily he wins them; the Naksatras are the lights of the doers of good deeds…” Tr. Arthur Berriedale Keith</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana 6:5:4:8 “May the divine women, with unclipped wings, dear to all the gods, bake thee, Aṅgiras-like, O fire-pan, in the lap of the earth!&#8217; for of old the divine women, with unclipped wings, dear to all the gods, did bake it, like Aṅgiras, in the lap of the earth; and with their help he now bakes it. But, surely, these are the stars,&#8211;the women (gani) are indeed the stars, for these are the lights of those righteous men (gana) who go to the celestial world: it is by means of the stars that he thus bakes it.” Tr. Julius Eggeling</p>
<h1><a id="post-6594-37"></a>Sky/Heaven is supported by pillars</h1>
<p>Rig Veda 6.72.2 O lords of resplendence and bliss, you bestow light to the dawns; you upraise the sun with his splendour; you prop up the sky with the supporting pillar of the firmament; you spread out the earth, the mother of all. Tr. Svami Satya Prakash Saraswati</p>
<p>Rig Veda 6.47.5 “This very same exilir of devotional love finds the wavy sea of brilliant colours in fore-front of the dawns, whose dwelling is in firmament. This might exilir sustains the heavens up with a mighty pillar, the sender of rains, the leader of the winds.” Tr. Svami Satya Prakash Saraswati</p>
<p>Rig Veda 8.41.10 “In his successive functions, he emits his bright rays (during day) or turns them dark (during the night). He measures out the eternal abode, and supports with the pillar of the firmament, both heaven and the earth. May all our adversities vanish” Tr. Svami Satya Prakash Saraswati</p>
<p>What supports the Sky?</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana 3.3.4.2. He then makes (the sacrificer) say, after touching (the Soma), ‘The bull hath propped the sky, the welkin.’ For, when the gods were spreading the sacrifice, they were afraid of an attack on the part of the Asura-Rakshas. Now by what he says, ‘The bull hath propped the sky, the welkin…</p>

<p>Read the new article <a href="/index.php/2014/12/27/hinduism-lust/" data-wpel-link="internal">Hinduism and Lust</a> for obscenity in other Hindu sciptures</p>
<p>This article is not intended to offend Hindus, I have written this article only for those Hindus who thinks only Hinduism is a pure religion free from obscenity and all other religions are full of obscenities. Such people are perverts that’s why they only look for sex related things in other religions, their minds are filled with lust.</p>
<p>Sexuality was not a secret thing in Vedic period as it is evident from Hindu places of worship like Khajuraho, Ajanta, Ellora temples and scriptures like Kama Sutra and various other Hindu texts which openly spoke or showed pornography.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.indiatimes.com/culture/who-we-are/14-temples-in-india-where-you-get-a-lot-more-than-just-the-traditional-prasad-231878.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">http://www.indiatimes.com/culture/who-we-are/14-temples-in-india-where-you-get-a-lot-more-than-just-the-traditional-prasad-231878.html<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>It was only in recent times when Hinduism was influenced by other religions that it took shelter in modesty. Despite such facts some Hindu fanatics do not hesitate mocking other religions especially other religious personalities. I am reproducing some verses from Vedas, which is the oldest text of Hinduism.</p>
<p><span id="more-5660"></span></p>
<p><strong>SEX POSITIONS IN VEDAS</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.110.5 Spacious doors remain wide open like beautiful wives for their husbands. O divine doors, great and all-impellers, be easy of access to the gods.<br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="510" height="199" class="wp-image-7366" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2014-05-rig-.png" alt="https://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/rig-veda-10-110-5.png?w=510&amp;h=199" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2014-05-rig-.png 510w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2014-05-rig--300x117.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 510px) 100vw, 510px" /></p>
<p>Yaska Acharya explains this verse as</p>
<p>Nirukta 8.10 ”Having spaciousness, make yourself wide open as exceedingly beautiful wives do their thighs for their husbands in sexual intercourse. The thighs are the most beautiful parts (of the body)…” Tr. Lakshman Swarup</p>
<p>The next verse is even more obscene,</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 19.88 ‘‘Just as a wife, the recipient of semen, at the time of cohabitation keeps her head opposite to the head of the husband, and her face opposite to that of his, so should both husband and wife perform together their domestic duties. A husband is a protector like a physician. He lives happily like a child, and with tranquillity produces progeny with penis keen with ardour.” Tr. Devi Chand (Arya Samaj)</p>
<p>Following is the Arya Samaj Hindi translation with commentary</p>

<p>A verse in Atharva reads as follows,</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 14.2.38 “O Men, you are the strengtheners. You inspire into this lady well-wisher of you and your family the spirit of procreating children. This woman is such an entity in whom the men sow semen-seed, who desiring progeny spread her thigh towards her husband and in whom the husband like you and us thrust organ with the desire of children. O happy bride-groom mount over thigh of your wife and touch with hand, in a joyus spirit your wife. You both delighted with joy procreate children…”” Tr. Acharya Vaidyanath Shastri (Arya Samaj)</p>
<p>Another verse reads as,</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 14.2.71 ”O bride, I am Amah and you are Saa I am Saman and you are Rik and I am sun and you earth. Let both of us unite together and procreate progeny.” Tr. Vaidyanath Shastri (Arya Samaj)</p>
<p>As per Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 6.4.20-22 this verse should be recited before sexual intercourse after embracing each other. The passage from Brihadaranyaka Upanishad which is a commentary on this verse also tells a sex position in obscene manner, for more information readers are requested to go through the article <a href="/index.php/2014/12/27/hinduism-and-lust/" data-wpel-link="internal">Hinduism and Lust</a></p>
<p><strong>TRANSGENDERISM/HOMOSEXUALITY IN VEDAS</strong></p>
<p>We read in newspaper about some Hindu scholars condemning homosexuality. But do they have any evidence that prohibits homosexuality in Hinduism? Hindu scholars fail to furnish any reference from authoritative text like Vedas which condemns homosexuality but still some try to term homosexuality as irreligious act. Fortunately there are some Hindu scholars like Shri Shri Ravishankar who honestly accept such facts, below are two snapshots of his tweets<br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="406" height="429" class="wp-image-7368" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2014-05-homo.jpeg" alt="https://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/homosexuality-shiva-vishnu-ravishankar.jpg?w=406&amp;h=429" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2014-05-homo.jpeg 406w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2014-05-homo-284x300.jpeg 284w" sizes="(max-width: 406px) 100vw, 406px" /></p>

<p>Although we are aware of the homosexual act of Vishnu and Shiva but homosexuality/transgenderism is present in Vedas too. In Veda Indra transformed himself into a woman,</p>
<p>अददा अर्भां महते वचस्यवे कक्षीवते वर्चयामिन्द्र सुन्वते |<br />
मेनाभवो वर्षणश्वस्य सुक्रतो विश्वेत ता ते सवनेषु परवाच्या ||</p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.51.13 To old Kaksivin, Soma-presser, skilled in song, O Indra, thou didst give the youthful Vrcaya. Thou [Indra], very wise, was wife [Mena] of Vrisanaiva; those deeds of thine must all be told at Soma feasts.</p>
<p>Griffith has translated the word Mena as daughter/child but according to Brahmana, Purana and lexicons the word Mena denotes wife, woman, or female of any animal. Griffith wrote, &#8220;Mena: according to a later legend, Indra became, himself, the daughter of King Vrishanasva.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yaska Acharya gives the following meaning for Mena (also spelled Menah),<br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="300" height="46" class="wp-image-7369" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2014-05-niru.jpeg" alt="https://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/nirukta-3-21.jpg?w=300&amp;h=46" /></p>
<p>Nirukta 3.21 ”Menah and Gnah are (synonyms) of Women.” Tr. Lakshman Swarup</p>
<p>”मेना Mena – Wife, female”- Cappeller’s Sanskrit English Dictionary</p>
<p>It is also confirmed in Satapatha Brahmana that Indra became the wife of Vrishanasva,</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana 3.3.4.18. ‘Come, O Indra!’ Indra is the deity of the sacrifice: therefore he says, ‘Come, O Indra!’ ‘Come, O lord of the bay steeds! Ram of Medhatithi ! Wife of Vrishanasva ! Bestriding buffalo! Lover of Ahalya’ Thereby he wishes him joy in those affairs of his.</p>
<p>Baudhayana Srauta Sutra XIX.10 &#8220;&#8230;Indra, do thou come. Thou with the tawny seeds come, Ram of Medhatithi. Mena of Vrsanasva. Buffalo leaping down. Lover of Ahalya. Brahmana of Kusika&#8217;s clan. Thou that callest thyself Gautama&#8230;&#8221; Tr. C.G. Kashikar</p>
<p>Maitrayani Samhita 2.5.5 ”When Indra became Vrishanasva’s Mena [or wife] he was seized by Nirrti, Calamity. When he chased it away, that Calamity became a castrated animal. Whoever thinks he is seized by Calamity, Darkness, he should sacrifice this castrated animal to Indra.”-Tr. Feller.</p>
<p>Indra is considered the wife of Vrishanasva in Satapatha Brahama, as we all know Indra lusted after Ahalya thus he is also called the lover of Ahalya in the Satapatha Brahmana. From major sources like Satapatha Brahmana, Baudhayana Srauta Sutra, and Maitrayani it is proved that Indra indeed became the wife of Vrishnasva. Another transgender story is mentioned in the Atharva Veda where Indra assumed the form of a woman to have sex with an Asuri named Vilistenga.</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 7.38.2 This Herb wherewith the Asuri drew Indra downward from the Gods, With this same Herb I draw thee close that I may be most dear to thee.</p>
<p>Kathaka Samhita 13.5 &#8220;Indra desired the Danavi Vilistenga. He went to the Asuras and became a woman among women and a man among men. He thought he was seized by Nirrti (the goddess of Calamity or Misfortune). He saw (as a sacrificial offering) this castrated animal consecrated to Indra and to Nirrti. In that form in which he went about (i.e. castrated), such an animal he offered in sacrifice.&#8221; Tr. Danielle Feller</p>
<p>This story is further elaborated in Brhaddevata. According to Shaunaka Rishi, Indra after transforming himself into a woman had sex with a Danavi which can be considered Lesbianism.</p>
<p>Brhaddevata VI.76-76 &#8220;In &#8216;Downward&#8217; (adhah: viii.33.19) a girl addressed Indra (who appeared) with the characteristics of a woman&#8217; for the chastiser of Paka (Indra) made love to that Danava maiden, the eldest sister of Vyamsa, by reason of his (Indra&#8217;s youthful desire (yuva-kamya)&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Arthur Anthony Macdonnel</p>
<p>Arthur Anthony Macdonnel wrote in the footnotes,</p>
<p>&#8220;That is, this stanza is addressed by a Danavi to Indra who has assumed the form of a woman. According to Sayana on RV. viii.33.19 this stanza is addressed to Asanga Playogi when he was a woman (cp. above, vi.41). And has assumed the disguise of a woman because Vyamsa was his enemy.&#8221;</p>
<p>There is another transgender story mentioned in Rig Veda which says that Asanga son of Playoga had become a woman after he was cursed by gods,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 8.33.19 Cast down thine eyes and look not up. More closely set thy feet. Let none See what thy garment veils, for thou, a Brahman, hast become a dame.<br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="106" class="wp-image-7370" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2014-05-rig-1-1.png" alt="https://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/rig-veda-8-33-19.png?w=500&amp;h=105" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2014-05-rig-1-1.png 500w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2014-05-rig-1-1-300x64.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is elaborated in later texts as,</p>
<p>Brhaddevata of Shaunaka VI.41 &#8220;The seer turned that Asanga, who had been a woman, into a man (again)&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Arthur Anthony Macdonnel</p>
<p>Sankhayana Srauta Sutra XVI.11.16-18 &#8220;The sixth is that relating to Medhatithi, how Asanga, the son of Plyoga, being a woman became a man&#8230;&#8221; Tr. W. Caland</p>
<p><strong>Rape</strong></p>
<p>There’s a verse in Rig Veda which reads as,</p>
<p>यः सत्राहा विचर्षणिरिन्द्रं तं हूमहे वयम |<br />
सहस्रमुष्क तुविन्र्म्ण सत्पते भवा समत्सु नो वर्धे ||</p>
<p>yaḥ satrāhā vicarṣaṇirindraṃ taṃ hūmahe vayam |<br />
sahasramuṣka tuvinṛmṇa satpate bhavā samatsu no vṛdhe ||</p>
<p>Rig Veda 6.46.3 “We invoke that Indra who is the destroyer of mighty foes, the supervisor (of all things): do thou, the many-organed, the protector of the good, the distributor of wealth, be unto us (the insurer of) success in combats.” Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>The Sanskrit word mentioned here to describe Indra is Sahastra+Mushka which means thousand vaginas/testicles. Some translators including Griffith has translated this word as “thousand powers” but I do not agree with it since the word Mushka ( मुष्क ) clearly means Vagina/Testicles, Mushka here definitely means vagina because there is evidence from other Hindu text to support “thousand vagina” definition. Whether the word Mushka means Vagina or testicle is not an issue but a Vedic god described as being with “A Thousand Testicles” in holy scripture is surely obscene. One can check the meaning of Mushka ( मुष्क ) in V.S Apte’s dictionary available online <a href="http://dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/contextualize.pl?p.4.apte.2383229" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">uchicago.edu<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> and also from another online dictionary <a href="http://spokensanskrit.org/index.php?mode=3&amp;script=hk&amp;tran_input=mushka&amp;direct=au" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Spokensanskrit.de<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. The story as mentioned in Skanda Purana V.iii.136.2-16; Brahma Purana, Gautami-Mahatmya 16.59 states that Indra was cursed by Sage Gautama to be with one thousand Vaginas all over the body as Indra had raped Sage Gautam’s wife Ahalya which I have explained briefly in <a href="/index.php/2014/12/27/hinduism-and-lust/" data-wpel-link="internal">Hinduism and Lust</a> article. Sayana interprets the word Sahasra Mushka as Sahasra-Shepha (thousand penises),</p>

<p>Maharshi Yaska mentions a strange story about the birth of Asvins (the twin horsemen). Which is a elaboration of Rig Veda Mandal 10, hymn 17. The story says Saranyu was unwilling to have sex with Vivasvat and ran away but Vivasvat chased her and raped her. Yaska writes,</p>
<p>Nirukta 12.10 ”Saranyu daughter of Tvastr bore twins, Yama and Yami, to Vivasvat the sun. She having substituted another lady of similar appearance, and having assumed the shape of a mare, ran away. He, Vivasvat, the sun, having also assumed the shape of a horse, pursued her, and joined her. Thence the Asvins were born. Manu was born from the lady of similar appearance.” Tr. Lakshman Swarup</p>
<p>This story of Vivasvat raping his wife by inserting penis in her mouth is further elaborated in Brahma Purana 4.42-43; Shiva Purana, UmaSamhita 5.35.32-34; Matsya Purana 11.34-37 and Brahmanda Purana 2.3.59.74-76 which I have mentioned in <a href="/index.php/2014/12/27/hinduism-and-lust/" data-wpel-link="internal">Hinduism and Lust</a> article under Oral Sex category. The question is how sun god was aroused seeing his wife who was in the form of a mare? It must have been that Vedic god Vivaswat was sexually attracted towards animals that’s the reason he raped his wife whilst she was in the form of a mare. But Vedas also has mention of bestiality.</p>
<p><strong>SEX WITH ANIMALS</strong></p>
<p>Some protestant Hindus proudly promote Vedas as philosophical, free from all vulgarities. But in reality there is no limit for Vulgarity in Vedas. It even promotes sex with animals let alone adultery and pornography. Sex with animals in Hinduism is not a vulgar thing, Ancient Hindu temples like Khajuraho, Ajanta, Ellora clearly depicts men and girls having sex with animals.</p>
<p><strong>ASHVAMEDHA YAJNA </strong></p>
<p>Read the article <a href="/index.php/2018/05/14/ashvamedha-yajna-the-obscene-ritual/" data-wpel-link="internal">Ashvamedha Yajna The Obscene</a> for more evidence</p>
<p>Ashvamedha Yajna is a ritual performed by Queens (particularly by chief queen) for fertility and also to gain power in the kingdom. The Ashvamedha Yajna includes slaughtering the horse, then follows the obscene Queen’s intercourse with the horse, then the horse is cut into pieces and cooked. However some Hindus due to extreme obscenity reject these facts and are giving their personal interpretations. They even deny the fact that Horse was slaughtered during the ritual, I request the readers to go through the article <a href="/index.php/2018/01/01/meat-consumption-in-hinduism/" data-wpel-link="internal">Meat Consumption in Hinduism</a>.</p>
<p>It is mentioned both in Krishna and Yajur Veda, but the this sacrifice mentioned in Krishna Yajur Veda is obscure because the author has omitted those verses,</p>
<p>Krishna Yajur Veda 7.4.19 The wicked horse is sleeping. O fair one, clad in fair raiment in the world of heaven be ye two covered ….{…several verses omitted from original translation…} <a href="http://sacred-texts.com/hin/yv/yv07.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Sacred-texts.com<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>It is mentioned in Shukla Yajur Veda,</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 23.19-21 All wife of the host reciting three mantras go round the horse. While praying, they say: ‘O horse, you are, protector of the community on the basis of good qualities, you are, protector or treasure of happiness. O horse, you become my husband’. After the animal is purified by the priest, the principal wife sleeps near the horse and says: ‘O Horse, I extract the semen worth conception and you release the semen worth conception. The horse and principal wife spread two legs each. Then the Ardhvaryu(priest) orders to cover the oblation place, raise canopy etc. After this, the principal wife of the host pulls penis of the horse and puts it in her vagina and says: “This horse may release semen in me. Then the host, while praying to the horse says: “O horse, please throw semen on the upper part of the anus of my wife. Expand your penis and insert it in the vagina because after insertion, this penis makes women happy and lively.</p>
<p><strong>LICENTIOUS ACT OF VEDIC GODS</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 7.33.11 Born of their love for Urvasi, Vasistha thou, priest, art son of Varuna and Mitra; And as a fallen drop, in heavenly fervour, all the Gods laid thee on a lotus-blossorn.<br />

<p>Above is Pundit Ram Govind Trivedi’s Hindi translation. Yaska Acharya writes on this verse,</p>
<p>Nirukta 5.13 “Urvashi is (the name of) a naiad, (so called because) she pervades wide regions (uru + as- to pervade ‘), or she pervades by means of thighs [Sexual Intercourse] …On seeing her, the seminal fluid of Mitra and Varuna fell down. Tr. Lakshman Swarup</p>
<p>It is mentioned in Bhagwad Purana/Srimad Bhagavatam (ISKCON translation)</p>
<p>Bhagavad Purana (Srimad Bhagavatam) 6.18.6 Upon seeing Urvaśī, the celestial society girl, both Mitra and Varuṇa discharged semen, which they preserved in an earthen pot. The two sons Agastya and Vasiṣṭha later appeared from that pot, and they are therefore the common sons of Mitra and Varuṇa. Mitra begot three sons in the womb of his wife, whose name was Revatī. Their names were Utsarga, Ariṣṭa and Pippala.</p>
<p>Bhagavad Purana (Srimad Bhagavatam) 9.13.6 After saying this, Mahārāja Nimi, who was expert in the science of spiritual knowledge, gave up his body. Vasiṣṭha, the great-grandfather, gave up his body also, but through the semen discharged by Mitra and Varuṇa when they saw Urvaśī, he was born again.</p>
<p>Brhaddevata V.149-150 &#8220;Of these two Adityas, when they saw the nymph Urvasi at a sacrificial session, the semen was effused. It fell into a jar containing water that stood overnight. Now at the same moment two vigorous ascetics, the seers Agastya and Vasistha, there came into being.&#8221; Tr. Arthu Anthony Macdonnel</p>
<p><strong>VEDIC GODS HAVING SEX WITH THE SAME WOMAN AND IMPREGNATING HER</strong></p>
<p>”Pushan, inspire her who is most auspicious, in whom men may sow seed, who most affectionate. may be devoted to us, and in whom animated by desire we may beget progeny. (The Gandharvas) gave Surya to thee, Agni, with her bridal ornaments ; do thou, Agni, give (us) husbands our wife back again with male offspring. Agni gave the wife back again with life and splendour; may he who is her husband enjoying long life live a hundred years. Soma first obtained the bride;the Gandharva obtained her next ; Agni was thy third husband ; thy fourth (husband) is born of man. Soma gave her to the Gandharva; the Gandharva gave her to Agni ; Agni has given her to me and wealth and sons.” Rig Veda 10.85.37-41, Tr. Wilson [See below for Arya Samaj translation]
<p>This is also mentioned in Atharva Veda,</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 14.2.3-4 She was the wife of Soma first: next the Gandharva was thy lord. Agni was the third husband: now one born of woman is thy fourth. Soma to the Gandharva, and to Agni the Gandharva gave. Now, Agni hath bestowed on me riches and sons and this my bride.</p>
<p>It is mentioned in Agni Purana,</p>
<p>Agni Purana 165.19-20 ”The gods first enjoy the women, then the Moon-god, after them the Gandharvas, subsequently the Fire-god, and last of all the mortals; and hence they can never be polluted.” Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Atri Samhita 1.190 “Women were first enjoyed by the Celestials; then by the moon, the Gandharvas and the Fires. Afterwards came men to enjoy them. They are never affected by any sin.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Arya Samaji scholar named Vaidyanath Shastri tries to link 4th verse of Atharved to Niyoga, another scholar named Kshemkarandas Trivedi explains 4th verse in terms of Niyoga, Another proof is that Swami Dayanand Saraswati had also used a verse from the same hymn, He used Atharva Veda 14.2.18 as well as verses from Rig Veda 10.85 hymn as evidence for Niyoga. Pandit Jaydev Sharma endorsed Dayanand Saraswati’s views and commenting on 4th verse he makes a mention of the passage written by Dayanand. Swami Dayanand Saraswati wrote,</p>
<p>‘’A. ~ “O woman! Thy first husband with whom thou art united by marriage is named Soma, called so because he was a chaste bachelor (before marriage). Thy second husband with whom thou art connected by Niyoga is named Gaandharva, called so because he had already lived with another woman (to whom he had been united by marriage). Thy third husband, (by Niyoga) is named Agni (fire), called so because he so very passionate. All thy other husbands from the fourth to the eleventh are called men.’’ <strong>Satyarth Prakash, Ch 4, p.136, by Swami Dayanand Saraswati, Tr. Chiranjiva Bhardwaja</strong>.</p>
<p>The fact that Arya Samaj scholars are trying to link these verses to Niyoga proves that sex is involved hence also proves that Vedic deities had sex with the same woman and impregnated her. Still some people may regard this as allegorical to escape but explanation from Agni Purana and Swami Dayanand is enough to prove the point. This verse can also be used to prove Polyandry. They try their level best to hide these vulgar things, example is the passage by Dayanand who tries to turn the names of Vedic deities to normal men. The verses I quoted above are perhaps not related to Niyoga but Dayanand Saraswati tries to justify the filthy act of gods by linking it to Niyoga (Which is also a filth).</p>
<p><strong>ADULTERY AND PROSTITUTION IN VEDA</strong></p>
<p>Swami Parmeshwaranand writes</p>
<p>”Jara [Lover] is always explained as Upapati (paramour) by Sayana. There is hardly any reference in the Rig Veda which might suggest that a lover was looked down upon or was considered morally wrong or corrupt. Sayana also does not consider loving sinful.”</p>
<p>As Swami Parmeshwaranand said Jara, which is translated as Lover, Paramour and Gallant wasn’t considered wrong, in fact Vedas promotes adultery, Maharishi Manu writes,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 5.56 There is no sin in eating meat, in (drinking) spirituous liquor, and in carnal intercourse, for that is the natural way of created beings, but abstention brings great rewards</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rig Veda mentions story of Apala the daughter of Atri who suffered from skin-disease. She was married but her husband had left her. Indra was attracted to her, she chewed Soma plant which was then drunk by Indra from her mouth. To cure her, Indra dragged her through the wide hole of his chariot, the narrower hole of the cart, and the small hole of the yoke, and she cast off three skins. The first skin became a hedgehog, the second an alligator, and the third a chameleon.</p>
<p>Rig Veda 8.80.1-7 &#8220;A young woman going to the water found Soma in the path; as she carried it home she said, I will press thee for Indra, I will press thee for Sakra. Thou who goest from house to house a hero bright in thy splendour, drink this Soma pressed by my teeth, together with fried grains of barley, the karambha, cakes, and hymns&#8230;May (Indra) repeatedly make us powerful, may he do abundantly for us, may he repeatedly make us very rich; often hated by our husband and forced to leave him, may we be united to Indra. These three places, do thou cause them all to grow, my father&#8217;s (bald) head, his (barren) field, and my body. This field which is our (father&#8217;s), and this my body, and the head of my father, do thou make all these bear a crop. Thrice, Satakratu, didst thou purify Apala, in the hole of the chariot, in the hole of the cart, and in the hole of the yoke, and thou didst make her with a skin resplendent like the sun.&#8221; Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Shaunaka wrote on these verses,</p>
<p>Brhaddevata VI.99-106 &#8220;There was once a girl Apala, daughter of Atri, who suffered from skin-disease. With her Indra fell in love, having seen her in the lonely hermitage of her father. Now by penance she became aware of all Indra&#8217;s intentions. Taking a water-pot she went to fetch water. Seeing Soma at the edge of the water, she praised him with a stanza in the forest. This matter is related in the (stanza) &#8216;A maiden to the water&#8217; (kanya vah: viii.91.1). She pressed Soma in her mouth: and having pressed it she invoked Indra with the (stanza), &#8216;Thou that goest&#8217; (asau ya esi: viii.91.2); and Indra drank it from her mouth, after he had eaten cakes and meal from her house. And she praised him with stanzas, but with a triplet (viii.91.4-6) she addressed him (saying), &#8216;Make me, O Sakraa, to have abundant hair, (and) to be faultless-limbed, (and) fair-skinned.&#8217; Indra passing (praksipya) her through the carriage aperture (between the body of the car and the yoke, drew her forth three times. Then she became fair-skinned. Her first skin which was cast off became a porcupine (salyaka), but the next became an alligator (godha), and the last a chameleon (krkalasa).&#8221; Tr. Arthu Anthony Macdonnel</p>
<p>There are numerous verses which praises adultery,</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 5.5.3 Thou clingest close to every tree, as a fond damsel clasps her love.<br />

<p>Rig Veda 3.52.3 ”Relish, O illustrious Lord, our delicious roasted corn and butter. Derive enjoyment from our praises, as a lover from his beloved.” Tr. SatyaPrakash Saraswati (Arya Samaj)</p>
<p>Wilson’s translation for this verse,</p>
<p>”Eat, Indra, our (offered) cakes and butter; derive enjoyment from our praises, as a lover from his mistress.”</p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.134.3 ”…O Vayu, come and wake up and energise life like a lover who wakes up and impassions a sleeping beauty…” Tr. Tulsi Ram (Arya Samaj)</p>
<p>Rig Veda 3.33.10 Yea, we will listen to thy words, O singer. With wain and car from far away thou comest. Low, like a nursing mother, will I bend me, and yield me as a maiden to her lover.</p>
<p>Maharishi Yaska writes,</p>
<p>Nirukta 2.27 “We bend down for thy sake, as a nursing mother for her son, or as a maiden bends herself to embrace her lover.” Tr. Lakshman Swarup</p>
<p>Verses from Rig Veda 6.75.4, 9.96.23 and 9.101.14 likens the meeting of lovers to Hindu gods, But what’s more interesting is that the Vedic heroes are considered Maiden’s lovers. However Agni being maiden’s lover is regarded by some as allegorical, but still this doesn’t disapprove the existence of illicit relationship and it promotes adultery,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.66.4 Yama, indeed, is what is born, Yama, what shall be born; he [Agni] is the maidens’ lover, the matrons’ lord.</p>
<p>सेनेव सर्ष्टामं दधात्यस्तुर्न दिद्युत तवेषप्रतीका |<br />
यमो ह जातो यमो जनित्वं जारः कनीनां पतिर्जनीनाम ||<br />

<p>These verses clearly shows that adultery wasn’t deemed morally wrong, this is why there are numerous verses praising adultery but no where prohibits it. Prostitution was also prevalent in the Vedic period. It is still prevalent in some temples especially in south India where girls are forced to become Devdasi. Devdasi actually means slave or servant of god but they are sexually tortured by the Brahmins, these licentious priests sanction <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacred_prostitution" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Sacred Prostitution<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, which is also known as Temple prostitution. However looking in the Vedas one can find the origins of prostitution.</p>

Rig Veda 1.167.4 Far off the brilliant, never-weary Maruts cling to the Sadharani as a joint possession…</p>
<p>The Sanskrit word used here is Sadharani (after separating the words) referring to common woman, public woman or prostitute.</p>
<p>“Sadharani or Samanya (common), synonyms for prostitute, distinguish her as a woman possessed by not one man; this is the desideratum”- (Bhattacharji 1987, 33). [<a href="https://digital.library.txstate.edu/bitstream/handle/10877/4716/SOHAL-THESIS-2013.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Source<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>]
<p>Monier Williams translates it as ”Common to all”. Wilson also translates it as common woman or it may also be referring to a common wife like Draupadi.</p>
<p>Temple prostitution or sacred prostitution is still prevalent in many parts of India,<br />
As per Theguardian.com’s 2011 report “The National Commission for Women estimate that there are 48,358 Devadasis currently in India.”</p>

<p>And as per TheHindu.com</p>
<p>Quoting the National Commission for Women, the authority says there are 2.5 lakh “Devadasi” girls who have been dedicated to Yellamma and Khandoba temples on Maharastra-Karnataka border. This includes 16,624 from Andhra Pradesh, 22,941 from Karnataka and 2,479 from Maharastra. The Devadasi system is prevalent in 10 districts of north Karnataka and 14 districts in Andhra Pradesh.</p>

<p>As per Vedas everyone is born with a destined profession including prostitution based on their past deeds, it is mentioned that</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 30.5 ”For Brahman (Priesthood) he binds a Brahman to the stake… for Kama [Sex] a harlot…”</p>
<p>Some people try to explain this verse by misquoting it, they translate it as,</p>
<p>” May the Lord (of world as well as country) give due reward or punishment to various people – Brahmin for promotion of wisdom…”</p>
<p>I am reproducing two Hindi translations by Shri Ram Sharma Acharya and Swami Karpatri Maharaj<br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-7376" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2014-05-yaju-1.png" alt="https://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/yajur-veda-30-5-ram-sharma.png?w=506&amp;h=81" width="568" height="92" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2014-05-yaju-1.png 506w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2014-05-yaju-1-300x49.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 568px) 100vw, 568px" /></p>
<p>Swami Karpatri Maharaj’s Hindi translation<br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-7377" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2014-05-yaju-2.png" alt="https://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/yajur-veda-30-5-karpatri.png?w=496&amp;h=157" width="562" height="179" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2014-05-yaju-2.png 496w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2014-05-yaju-2-300x96.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px" /></p>
<p>Word by Word translation,</p>
<p>Brahmane Brahmanam = For priesthood (he binds) a Brahmin.</p>
<p>Kshatriya Rayanam = For a Kshatriya Rajanya (Kingdom, Governance).</p>
<p>Tapse Shudram = For penance a Shudra.</p>
<p>Tamse taskaram = For darkness a robber.</p>
<p>Narkaya Virhanam = For hell a homicide.</p>
<p>Paapmane Klibam = For misfortune/Sin a eunuch.</p>
<p>Akrayayo Ayogum = For venality a Ayogu</p>
<p>Kamaya Punscalum = For desire a Harlot</p>
<p>Atikrushtaya Magadham = For excessive noise a Magadha</p>
<p>The writer can do us a favor by quoting the Sanskrit words which he translated as ”May the lord give due reward or punishment to various people”. Some also try to explain it by adding these two words ”Cast aside” before harlot, I request them too to show which Sanskrit words are translated into ”Cast aside”. Those Hindus are leaving an example of how religious scripture undergoes corruption, they are adding their own words. That verse doesn’t have any Sanskrit words which can be translated as ”may lord give reward or punishment” or ”Cast aside”. Now they may argue that it is mentioned in Yajur Veda 30.3 and this verse is in continuity. If it so then why didn’t they mention it before? First of all if the verse is in continuity then why is the 4<sup>th</sup> verse omitted, Why have they jumped from 3<sup>rd</sup> to 5<sup>th</sup> verse when they claim that Vedas were arranged chronologically. Does that mean Rishis made a blunder in arranging these verses here? Moreover the deities of verses 3 and 5 are different so how can it be in continuity? The 3<sup>rd</sup> verse doesn’t state anything like ”May the lord give due reward or punishment”, it says</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 30.3 Savitar, God, send far away all troubles and calamities [from us], And send us only what is good.<br />

<p>It is further mentioned</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 30.20 For Pastime a harlot; for Laughter a jester; for Lust a woman with spotty skin…<br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="488" height="130" class="wp-image-7380" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2014-05-yaju-5.png" alt="https://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/yajur-veda-30-20.png?w=488&amp;h=130" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2014-05-yaju-5.png 488w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2014-05-yaju-5-300x80.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 488px) 100vw, 488px" /></p>
<p>It may not be a sin to become prostitute as Ishwar himself has assigned these professions to humans. There is no free will to choose the profession you desire, For Brahman Ishwar binds priesthood and for prostitutes he binds Kama (lust, desire, sexuality), Ishwar even says that he has created Woman for Lust. How can we consider Ishwar to be God after reading such verses. Is women created for mere sexual enjoyment in Vedas? Yaska Acharya also writes in his book,</p>
<p>Nirukta 4.15 “Kanya (maiden) is (so called because) she is an object of love…” Tr. Lakshman Swarup</p>
<p>Look at the phrase used here ”Object of love”, which clearly implies that Women in Hinduism is nothing more than a Sex object.</p>
<p><strong>Sex Slaves</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 6.27.8 Two wagon-teams, with damsels, twenty oxen, O Agni, Abhydvartin Cayamana, The liberal Sovran, giveth me. This guerdon of Prthu’s seed is hard to win from others.<br />

<p>These female slaves were given after a battle. This was a battle between Vedic god and Asuras, read previous verses for more information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Women in Paradise</strong></p>
<p>Ishwar has arranged thousands of Virgins for Brahmins not just on the earth but in the paradise too,</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 4.34.2 ”The persons firm in their faith, purified, cleansed with their sacerdotal acts and pure in their conscience attain the state of splendid purity. The all-pervading Divinity does not burn or deprive of their organ of enjoyment and generation and in the state of Svarga they have many women, one for each one as his wife.” Tr Vaidyanath Shastri (Arya Samaj)<br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="522" height="121" class="wp-image-7383" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2014-05-atha.gif" alt="https://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/atharva-veda-4-34-2.gif?w=522&amp;h=121" /></p>
<p>There is no word after Strenaam, but Vaidyanath Shastri tries to create monogamy in heaven by adding his own words ”one for each one as his wife”. But Panini in Ashtadhyayi 4.1.87 has interpreted the word Strenaam as ‘Collection of Females’, so in heaven they get plenty of women not just one woman or wife (as claimed by Vaidyanath) which is evident from the Hindi translation by Shri Ram Sharma Acharya also. Another Hindu scholar named M.R. Rajesh translates it as,</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 4.34.2 ”Bereft of physical bodies, pure, cleansed with the wind, brilliant, they go to a brilliant world. The fire does not cause burning in their male organ. In the world of happiness they get plenty of women.” Tr. M.R. Rajesh</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>NIYOG PRATHA</strong></p>
<p>Niyog Pratha is the ugly practice where the wife copulates with other men to beget children, it is also a license for Brahmins to enjoy numerous women as Vedic law permits them to copulate with any women they desire if they are unable to control their passion. Following verse is taken as a proof for Niyoga from the Vedas,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.40.2 Where are ye, Aśvins, in the evening, where at morn? Where is your haltingplace, where rest ye for the night? Who brings you homeward, as the widow bedward draws her husband’s brother, as the bride attracts the groom?</p>
<p>Yaska explains this verse as,</p>
<p>Nirukta 3.15 ”Where do you remain at night, and where during the day? Where do you obtain the necessities of life, and where do you dwell? Who puts you to bed as a widow her husband’s brother? From what (root) is Devara derived ? (He is)so called (because) he is the second husband…” Tr. Lakshman Swarup</p>
<p>The one who is to contract Niyoga with the widow is known as Appointed Husband or Devar. The brother of the deceased is most preferred in the case of Niyoga, after that Sapinda (Close relatives) and Niyoga with high caste Brahmins is also preferable as a widow can’t contract Niyoga with lower caste. It is recommended to contract Niyoga with higher caste men only as they are said to be so called ‘Intellectuals’. Above verse from Vedas as well as Nirukta talks about Niyoga. Arya Samaji scholar named Chiranjiva Bhardvaja explains the word Devar (in Niyoga sense) in the amendment of his translation in the 4th chapter of Satyarth Prakash,</p>
<p>”*Q. ~ Supposing the deceased husband of a widow had no younger brother, with whom should she contract Niyoga?<br />
A. ~ With her devar, but the word devar does not mean what you think. For the Nirukta says “The second husband by Niyoga of a widow, be he the younger brother of her deceased husband or his elder brother, or of a man of her won Class or of a higher Class, is called Devar.” <strong>explanation by Dr. Chiranjiva Bhardwaja, page 134, Ch 4, Satyarth Prakash.</strong></p>
<p>Some Hindus especially Aryas are shying away from this topic and even defying their guru Swami Dayanand Saraswati (Mulshankar) who immensely supported Niyoga. Stalwarts of Arya Samaj viewed Niyoga as legit and that it is sanctioned by the Vedas. Rig Veda hymn 10 of chapter 10 endorses Niyoga (as per Arya Samaj translation), Following is the snapshot of the header from their website<br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="492" height="292" class="wp-image-7384" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2014-05-niyo.png" alt="https://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/niyoga-arya-samaj.png?w=492&amp;h=292" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2014-05-niyo.png 492w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2014-05-niyo-300x178.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 492px) 100vw, 492px" /></p>
<p>It states,</p>
<p>”This hymn is a dialogue between Yama and Yami i.e. between husband and wife. The husband on being impotent allows his wife to contract Niyoga…” [Source: <a href="http://aryasamajjamnagar.org/rugveda_v5/pages/p464.gif" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">http://aryasamajjamnagar.org/rugveda_v5/pages/p464.gif ]<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>It is mentioned in Rigved,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.40.2 ”O man and woman (connected by Niyoga), just as a widow, cohabits with her husband by Niyoga and produces children for him, and a wife cohabits with her husband by marriage and produces children for him, likewise (it may be asked) where both of you were during the day and during the night, and where you slept, who you are, and what your native place is.” taken from the book Satyarth Prakash, Ch 4, p.134,  Tr. Chiranjiva Bhardwaj (Arya Samaj)</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 14.2.18 “Do thou O woman that givest no pain to thy husband or Devar (husband by Niyoga), art kind to animals in this Order of householders, walk assiduously in the path of righteousness and justice, art well-versed in all the Shastras, hast children and grandchildren, givest birth to valiant the brave boys, desirest a second husband (by Niyoga), and bestoweth happiness on all, accept a man of they choice as thy husband or Devar , and always perform the Homa which is the duty of every householder.” taken from the book Satyarth Prakash, Ch 4, p.135, Tr. Chiranjiva Bhardwaja (Arya Samaj),</p>
<p>What’s more uglier is that Rishis created this practice to legitimize their desire. It enables a Brahmin to have sex with numerous women. Mulshankar (Dayanand) writes in his book,</p>
<p>”Those, however, who cannot control their passions may beget children by having recourse to Niyoga”- Satyarth Prakash, by Swami Dayanand Saraswati, Ch 4, page 130, Tr. Chiranjiva Bhardwaja.</p>
<p>For more evidence of Niyoga from other Hindu scriptures read the article <a href="/index.php/2014/12/27/hinduism-and-lust/" data-wpel-link="internal">Hinduism and Lust</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>BRIDE SELLING IN VEDA</strong></p>
<p>When the bridegroom was crippled, mentally unstable or lacked qualification then he purchased the bride from father with huge amount,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.109.2 &#8220;O Indra and Agni (Electricity and fire or father and Acharya) I have heard that you are more munificent givers than an un-worthy son-in-law or the brother of the bride&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Acharya Dharma Deva Vidya Martanda (Arya Samaj)</p>
<p>Nirukta 6.9 &#8220;I have heard that you are more liberal indeed than a would be son-in-law, i.e. one whose son-in-lawship is not quite complete. It is well known that the people in the south apply the term vijamata to the husband of a purchased maiden. By this is meant a bridegroom, whose relationship is not complete as it were&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Lakshman Sarup</p>
<p>This type of marriage is permissible in later texts where it is known as Asura/Manusha form of marriage. Refer the article <a href="/index.php/2014/12/27/hinduism-and-lust/" data-wpel-link="internal">Hinduism and Lust</a> for more information.</p>
<p><strong>INCEST IN VEDAS</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 6.55.4 Pushan, who driveth goats for steeds, the strong and Mighty, who is called His Sister’s lover, will we laud.</p>
<p>Yaska Acharya explains this as,</p>
<p>Nirukta 3.16 ”The author calls dawn his sister, from companionship, or drawing the juices. Or else this human lover may have been meant; the enjoyment in that case will refer to the woman, derived from (the root) bhaj (to enjoy)” Tr. Lakshman Swarup</p>
<p>Nowadays some defensive Hindus try to turn every obscene verse into metaphor to find a easy route to escape, but according to Yaska Acharya this refers to a human lover. Agni is also described as his sister’s lover,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.3.3 ”Attendant on the Blessed Dame the Blessed hath come: the Lover followeth his Sister. Agni, far-spreading with conspicuous lustre…”</p>
<p>Leave aside brother sister relationship, Vedas even promote Son-Mother incest,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 6.55.5 ”I glorify Pushan, the husband of his mother:may the gallant of his sister hear us ; may the brother of Indra be our friend.” Tr. Wilson</p>
<p>As we have already seen, it talks about a human lover (Nirukta 3.16). Vedas speak of brother sister’s incest in several hymns including the Rig Veda 10.10 and Atharva Veda 18.1.8 which is a dialogue between Yama and Yami. But I find no reference of Ishwar prohibiting it. Yami in Rigved 10.10.5; Atharved 18.1.5 says that Tvashtar made them husband and wife in the womb of their mothers only, though Yama rebukes her saying it has not been done before. Veda also allows incest between father and daughter, it is mentioned in Rig Veda</p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.61.5-7 “(Rudra), the benefactor of man, whose eager virile energy was developed, drew it back when disseminated (for the generation of offspring)again the irresistible (Rudra) concentrates (the energy) which was communicated to his maiden daughter. When the deed was done in mid-heaven in the proximity of the father working his will, and the daughter coming together, they let the seed fall slightly; it was poured upon the high place of sacrifice. When the father united with the daughter, then associating with the earth, he sprinkled it with the effusion[Semen]: then the thoughtful gods begot Brahma : they fabricated the lord of the hearth (of sacrifice) ; the defender of sacred rites.” Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>

<p>Some scholars say Rig Veda 10.61.5-7 verses are about the creation of universe after the union of father with his daughter. This is supported by Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, Upanishad also permits sex with daughter, its mentioned in Brihadaranyaka Upanishad that men were born after God had intercourse with his daughter,</p>
<p>Birhadaranyaka Upanishad 1.4.3 ”He was not at all  happy.  Therefore people (still)  are not happy when alone.  He desired a mate. He became as big as man and wife embracing each other. He parted this very body into two. From that came husband and wife. Therefore, said Yajnavalkya, this  (body) is one-half of oneself, like one of the two halves  of a split pea. Therefore this  space is indeed filled by the wife.  He was united with her.  From that men were born.” Tr. Swami Madhavananda</p>
<p>AdiShankara Acharya writes on this verse,</p>
<p>‘’He, the Viraj called Manu, was united with her, his daughter called Satarupa, whom he conceived of as his wife. From that union men were born.’’ by Shankara on Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 1.4.3, Shankara Bhashya, p.101, Tr. Swami Madhavananda.</p>
<p>Hindus argue that this incest is merely allegorical and thus shouldn’t be taken literally. It maybe allegorical but it does not negate the fact that incest is permitted by the Vedas after all many such verses are used by Hindus to prove their points. Was Ishwar short on words that he used such vulgar words in ‘Holy’ Vedas? Why have a lengthy discussion on this incest issue? Hindus just have to provide a verse from Vedas wherein Ishwar (God) prohibits incest, That’s it. No need to waste time and energy in lengthy discussions, If there is not a single verse in Vedas that prohibits incest then why defend it? on the other hand there are several Vedic verses that promotes incest.</p>
<p>My other question is that if incest was considered a serious offense then how could Ishwar inspire such incestuous verses so easily?</p>
<p>Wasn’t Ishwar aware of the fact that this could be used to justify incest? Inspiration of such incestuous verses only signifies that incest wasn’t considered a taboo.</p>
<p>Hindus are requested to prove incest is prohibited in Vedas, Quote a single verse wherein Ishwar (Aum) prohibits brother-sister, father-daughter, mother-son incest, if you can’t then you shouldn’t be defending it. And why does Ishwar have to inspire verses in such obscene language? Why can’t he reveal in some nice poetry. The composer of these verses must be a pervert that’s why there are these kind of obscene verses.</p>
<p>I’m sure no one can ever prove that. Now let’s have a look at some unholy words used by Ishwar in the so called ”Holy” Vedas.</p>
<h3><strong>Men only with Long Penis can impregnate women</strong>,</h3>
<p>Atharva Veda 20.126.17; Rig Veda 10.86.16-17 ”He whose organ [Penis] even in dream and even before cohabitation discharges genitive fluid may not be capable of having progeny. He whose long-shaped organ enters deep in the womb straight may be capable of having progeny. Almighty God is rarest of all and supreme over all. Tr. Vaidyanath Shastri (Arya Samaj)</p>
<p>Following is the Hindi translation of Rig Veda 10.86.16-17 by Pandit Ram Govind Trivedi (Puranik Hindu),<br />

<p><strong>Rishi Bhauma asking for his share of women,</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 9.67.12 This Soma juice, O glowing God, flows like pure oil, effused for thee: He shall give us our share of maids.</p>
<h3><strong>Stretching the Vagina</strong></h3>
<p>”O pregnant woman; I the physician and surgeon open your organ; Stretch the mouth of the womb; separate the embryo from arteries adjacent to it…”- Atharva Veda hymn 1.11.5, Tr. Vaidyanath Shastri (Arya Samaj)</p>
<p>Even if Ishwar wanted to convey a message, it would have been better for him to use some decent words, not words like only long penis penetrating deep into vagina can impregnate or I am stretching the labia of vagina. Now let’s see some more vulgar words used by Ishwar.</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 20.9 ”May my memory, navel, knowledge, anus, my wife’s productive womb [Yoni/Vagina], my testicles the givers of pleasure through cohabitation<strong>, </strong>my sovereignty and penis flourish…” Tr. Devi Chand (Arya Samaj)</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 19.76 ‘‘The generative organ [Penis] releases urine, but when it enters the womb [Vagina], it releases semen…” Tr. Devi Chand</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 5.25.1 ‘The phallus of man which sows the seminal fluid, lays in the female organ as feather on a shaft, the seed of embryo which is drawn from limb to limb and from cloud and heavenly region.’ Tr. Vaidyanath Shastri (Arya Samaj)</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 8.10 ”…O’ master of a devoted wife, full of prowess and semen, thou art the progenitor of offspring. Impregnate semen in me…” Tr. Devi Chand (Arya Samaj)</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 5.25.8 ”Says wife to her husband at the time of pregnation ceremony [Sexual intercourse]— O husband! please rise up, put forth your manly strength, lay the germ of embryo in the womb…” Tr. Vaidyanath Shastri (Arya Samaj)</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 19.87 ‘‘A husband full of semen like a pitcher, enjoyer, progenitor of children…” Tr. Devi Chand (Arya Samaj)</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 19.84 ”Those learned persons get progeny, who chase afar folly and ill intention, generate near at hand, by milk and medicinal juices, through generative organ, pure, disease-destroying, children-producing semen…” Tr. Chand (Arya Samaj)</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 12.3.29 ”…Let these drops mingle with these rices as woman sees her husband and embraces him for cohabitation” Tr. Vaidyanath Shastri(Arya samaj)</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 12.93 ”O married man, God has created the various herbs, whose king is Soma, that overspread the earth. With their aid, grant semen for this woman, and spread the knowledge of these medicines unto all.” Tr. Devi Chand (Arya Samaj)</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 6.101.1 ”O man! be strong through practice of continee, gain vitality through vital air, strengthen your body and invigorate extensively your limbs, so that the genitive organ of yours develop in proportion to your body and with that you attend your wife in sexual function.” Tr. Vaidyanath Shastri</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 6.101.2-3 “O man of medical science! extend the organ of the importent man like the bow with medicine through which the physicians make the debilitated man strong and stimulant and through which the ailing man excitant. I, the physician extend the potential power of your organ of generation like the bow-string on its arch, O feeble one! and you like the lion pouncing on dear enjoy the sex with your wife without being subject of any agony and discomfiture.” Tr. Acharya Vaidyanath Shastri (Arya Samaj)</p>
<p>Indra the Testicle breaker</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 6.138.2. “Turn him into a eunuch that wears his hair dressed, and into one that wears a hood! Then Indra with a pair of stones shall break his testicles both!” Tr. Maurice Bloomfield</p>
<p>Following is the Hindi translation by Shripad Damodar Satvalekar (Arya Samaj)<br />

<p>Atharva Veda 14.1.36 &#8220;Let Ashvinau, Prana and Apana adorn this bride with that sheen or splendour by whatever are filled these Akshas, the organs of body, by whatever is endowed the Sura woman having good bodily strength, by whatever is in the thigh of the woman having great sexual appetite.&#8221; Tr. Acharya Vaidyanath Shastra (Arya Samaj)</p>
<p><strong>Mahanagni (Great naked woman)</strong></p>
<p>Mahanagni is mentioned in <a href="https://sacred-texts.com/hin/av/av20136.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Atharva Veda Kanda 20, Adhyaya 136<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, but due to obscenity of the hymn about size of sexual organ and &#8216;Big Naked Woman&#8217; Griffith translated them in Latin.</p>
<p>Brhaddevata i.55 &#8220;&#8230;the harlot (mahanagni: AC. XX.136.5) would be a lascivious verse&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Arthur Anthony Macdonell</p>
<p>Swami Parmeshwarananda wrote,</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;the Vedic religion had developed the concept of the &#8216;Great naked woman&#8217;, the Mahanagni, as early as the period of the Atharvaveda (AV) some hymns from which are known to form part of the Khila hymns of the Rgveda. At one place in the AV, Mahanagni (another reading is Mahanaghni, but only at this place) is alluded to in the mantras in the context of marriage; and the gods Asvins are invoked to protect the bride by their powers by which they got sprinkled the genitals of Mahanagni (AV XIV.4, 36 yena mahanaghnya jaghanam&#8230;abhy&#8217; asicyanta.<br />
In the same context we have some ritual-detail; for, along with the genital of Mahanaghni, wine and the dice are also referred to have been sprinkled (Ibid. yena va sura yena aksa abhy&#8217; asicyanta). This will indicate that the sprinkling of the genitals of the Mahanagani, together with the wine and the dice probably formed some sort of a ritual; and, very probably, it was done for prosperity; it is the ritual-belief of the propitation of this naked goddess that further entered the ritual of marriage, as a charm for the happy married life for the bride. However, the propitation of Mahanagni is not exclusively associated with marriage, it was a much wider practice, and was extended to the ritual of marriage&#8230;Mahanaangi is told that &#8216;he&#8217; is roaring, being unsatisfied; she should be easy, and lift her thighs (RV-Khila V.22.6; AV XX.136.5 with variant reading). Mahanagni strides over the mortar and says, &#8216;As do they pound you, so do they mine&#8217; (RV ib. 7=AV ib. 6). Mahanagni rinses the &#8216;cock&#8217; with the wooden peg (TV ib.8=AV ib.10 mahannagni krakravakum samyaya pari-dhavati); and now, the singer says that he does not know, &#8216;the beast carries the woman by head!&#8217; (AV ib.10 ayam na vidma, yo mrgah sirsna harati dhaninkam; RV 8 has it as, &#8216;This bamboo-stic (tajanam) we do not know; the woman dhanaka) becomes &#8216;endowed with the head&#8217; (? sirsna bhavati dhanaka). Mahanagni says, &#8216;Well is the membrum virile entered; of the &#8216;tree having such fruit&#8217; may we gainbasket after basket&#8217; (AV ib.9=RV ib.5, with the difference that in RV at ab we have &#8216;the organ of the horse has entered&#8217;).<br />
Then we have references to the male partner of Mahanagni, who is called Mahanagna. This is what is said: &#8216;Mahanagni runs after Mahanagna, who runs (or, &#8216;rinses&#8217; Mahanagna who &#8216;rinses&#8217; her, dhavantam anu dhavati &#8216;where the sense seems to be twofold, including the sexual); (and says), &#8216;These his cows, protected them; &#8216;enjoy&#8217; me, &#8216;eat the moist one&#8217; (AV ib. 11 = RV ib. 9)&#8217;, where the sense is clear, and the eating of the &#8216;moist one&#8217;, is to be understood with &#8216;enjoy me&#8217; (yabha mam, adhhy, odanam), the whole concept being of the sexual acct as a charm for the protection of the cows&#8230;&#8221; <strong>Encyclopaedic Dictionary of Vedic Terms, Volume 1, page 355-6, by Swami Parmeshwaranand, Published by Sarup &amp; Sons, 2000</strong></p>
<p>Yajur Veda 6.14 ‘‘O disciple, through various sermons, I enjoin upon thee to purify thy voice, thy breath, thy eye, thy ear, thy navel, thy penis, thy anus ; and all thy dealings.” Tr. Devi Chand (Arya Samaj)</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 21.55 ”…just as God, the Dispeller of misery, like pleasure-giving water and semen-virile, invests in this world the soul…” Tr. Devi Chand (Arya Samaj)</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 25.1 ”…Acquire the knowledge of oozing semen from testicles…” Tr. Devi Chand (Arya Samaj)</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 6.72.1-2 “…so He makes the genital organ endowed with vigour of yours endowed with vigour, O man! in proportion to the stature of the one limb with other limb. As the genital organ of male made stout with the power of vital air, becomes capable of impregnation and as proportionate is the organ of well-developed man so great stout proportionately be your organ, O man of house hold life.” Tr. Acharya Vaidyanath Shastri (Arya Samaj)</p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.126.6-7 “She, who, when her desires are assented to, clings as tenaciously as a female weael, and who is ripe for enjoyment, yields me infinite delight. Approach me, (husband); deem me not immature: I am covered with down like a ewe of the Gandharins.” Tr. Wilson<br />

<p>Atharva Veda 14.1.22 ”You attain a long life, not short of hundred years obeying the rules of disciplined cohabitation without spoiling the semen in vain and according to the law of Dharma play your role accompanied by sons, grandsons…” Tr. Vaidyanath Shastri</p>
<p>Here Ishwar is asking husband and wife to have disciplined sex i.e., they should have sex just like Ishwar has prescribed them.  It is considered a sin if semen is spoiled i.e., one should not let semen fall on earth the proper place for depositing semen is Vagina only (as per Hindu texts and scholars), it is mentioned in Upanishad,</p>
<p>Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 6.4.4-5 ”Having known this, Uddalaka the son of Aruna, Naka the son of Mudgala and Kumaraharita said: ”Many mortals, brahmins only in name, perform the sexual act without knowledge of what has been said and depart from this world impotent and without merit.” Even if this much semen of one asleep or of one awake is spilled, He should touch it and repeat the following mantra: ”Whatever semen of mine has split on earth, whatever flowed to plants, whatever to water, I reclaim it.” With these words he should take the semen with his ring finger and thumb and rub it between his breasts or eyebrows, repeating the following mantra: ”Let the semen return to me, let Vigour come to me again, let glow and good fortune come to me again. May the deities who dwell in the sacrificial fire put the semen back in its proper place.” Tr. Swami Nikhilanda</p>
<p>‘If a virgin girl is married to suitable man he can tell her any thing of sexual nature that would not be treated obscene. That will be taken only as the science of sex.- Vaidyanath Shastri (Arya Samaj) on Atharva Veda book 20, hymn 133, Vol 2, p.716, Published by Arya Pratinidhi Sabha, New Delhi-2, 2003 Reprint.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following verse says that Vedic god Varuna had become impotent whose virility was restored by Gandharva via a herb and it also has many obscene words,</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 4.4.1-7 “This is that herbacious plant which is dug out from the earth by a physician for the use of the man whose potency is lost. We also dig out that remedial plant which stimulates the nerves and organ. Let the dawn be stimulant, let the sun be stimulant, let our words be stimulant and let the remedial plant which is the protective force for creatures and which is most effective, be stimulant to impotent nerve with its might energy. O man! let this herb make your nerve so stronger and more stimulant that in spite of impotency your strong body and nerve be active like him who is under the fever of passion…O physician, O nourisher, O enlightened woman, O protector of knowledge! You all by your restorative efforts make the organ of the impotent man strong like the bow. O man! I, the physician by the proper remedial treatment make your genital organ strong like a bow-string tight on its bow-ends. Let you be free from agony for ever and step on in your house-hold life. O physician! You are the expert of body and limbs. Please restore into the impotent man that power which horse, ass, the goat, ram and possess in them.” Tr. Acharya Vaidyanath Shastri (Arya Samaj)</p>
<p>Acharya Vaidyanath Shastri’s translation is not clear, following is the much more clear English translation of Maurice Bloomfield</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 4.4.1-7 “1. Thee, the plant, which the Gandharva dug up for Varuna, when his virility had decayed, thee, that causest strength, we dig up. Ushas (Aurora), Sûrya, (the sun), and this charm of mine; the bull Pragâpati (the lord of creatures) shall with his lusty fire arouse him! This herb shall make thee so very full of lusty strength, that thou shalt, when thou art excited, exhale heat as a thing on fire! The fire of the plants, and the essence of the bulls shall arouse him! Do thou, O Indra, controller of bodies, place the lusty force of men into this person! Thou (O herb) art the first-born sap of the waters and also of the plants. Moreover thou art the brother of Soma, and the lusty force of the antelope buck! Now, O Agni, now, O Savitar, now, O goddess Sarasvatî, now, O Brahmanaspati, do thou stiffen the pasas as a bow! I stiffen thy pasas as a bowstring upon the bow. Embrace thou (women) as the antelope buck the gazelle with ever unfailing (strength)! The strength of the horse, the mule, the goat and the ram, moreover the strength of the bull bestow upon him, O controller of bodies (Indra)!</p>
<p>Pasas means penis, Acharya Vaidyanath has also translated words like penis as genital organ to make it look less obscene.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 25.26 ”This perishable body made of earth, the home of all organs is created for the enjoyment of the soul. God, for the excellent enjoyment of this active soul, grants this enjoyable object.” Tr. Devi Chand (Arya Samaj)</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 25.7 ”…Strengthen scrotum with the testicles. Examine the strength of a horse from his penis. Produce progeny with semen. Digest meals with the force,Strengthen your belly by free discharge of digested food through anus.” Tr. Devi Chand (Arya Samaj)</p>
<p>Can Hindus or Aryas read these verses in front of their parents, elders or other people? Can god really use such vulgar language in the Holy Book? This might be the reason why Aryas are ill mannered, always uses foul language, and perhaps this is why they look only for porn in other scriptures. What is the wisdom behind revealing such obscene words like ”penis releases urine but when it enters the womb [Yoni] it releases semen” weren’t Aryans aware of cohabitation that Ishwar had to inspire it? The sentence of Yajur Veda 25.7 is useless now as Horses are not required. If horse’s strength was examined by his penis then how did the Aryas examine the strength of Humans? the next line says ‘Produce progeny with semen” as if people produce progeny from cooking oil. Why give such vulgar unnecessary knowledge? Such book which is no different than a porn literature can never be the word of God. Hindus should study these verses carefully instead of blindly following their scholars.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Written by Ibn Muhammad</p>
<p>Islam is being severely attacked, bashed, mocked by a certain dedicated team in cyberspace. A large number of these ‘Islam Haters’ happen to be Hindu fanatics. Obviously, their sole agenda is to create aversion in the minds of common people against Islam. Their full time job is to prove that the Islam promotes violence and terrorism. Some of these people are zealous evangelists of Vedas and claim that Vedas are the only books promoting peace. They claim that once everyone accepts the Vedas, peace and prosperity would been seen everywhere. How true is this claim? For those of you who have been conditioned to believe that Vedas promote peace, this article might change your perception of the Vedic Dharma.</p>
<p>According to Hindus, in Satyug, people were pious and upright, who did not know fighting. The use of lethal weapons was unknown. It was like Heaven on Earth. Hindus also tell us that Vedas are from the beginning of the world. Combining these two beliefs, it follows that Vedas must have nothing corcerning warfare, killing, plunder, etc. However, if Vedas do speak about warfare and killing, there are two only two choices for Hindus; accept that Vedas are not from the beginning of the world, but were written much later or accept that Vedas introduced killing and warfare in the world.</p>
<p><span id="more-850"></span></p>
<p><strong>The Warrior Gods of Vedas</strong></p>
<p>The Vedic gods are always depicted as being busy in war and destroying the enemies. Let us see god Indra</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="651" height="290" class="wp-image-7337" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-i1-wp-com-www-islamhinduism-com-images-sto.gif" alt="https://i1.wp.com/www.islamhinduism.com/images/stories/rig_10_48_6to7.gif" /></p>
<p><strong>“These, breathing loud in fury, two and two, who caused Indra to bring his bolt of thunder to the fray, The challengers, I struck with deadly weapon down: firm stand what words the God speaks to his worshippers. This One by stronger might I conquered singly; yea, also two: shall three prevail against me? Like many sheaves upon the floor I thrash them. How can my foes, the Indraless, revile me?” [Rigveda 10:48:6-7]</strong></p>
<p>Indra Ji cannot tolerate anyone opposing him and whoever is guilty of opposing him will be crushed like sawdust.</p>
<p>Indra Ji was invoked by the Aryans to loot the cows of non Aryan tribes and Indra Ji did not disappoint the Aryans. In Vedic times, there lived an untouchable people in a village named Kikat, in todays Bihar. The used to rear cattle. Obviously to the Aryans this was a crime. So they invoked their god Indra to wage war against them and loot their cows.</p>
<p><strong>“O Indra, what do the cows make for you among the Kikatas. They neither yield milk for your offerings, nor do they warm the vessel of libation. Bring to us these cows, bring to us also the wealth of Pramagand (their King). O Brave one, grant us the possessions of the people of low status.” [Rigveda 3:53:14]</strong></p>
<p>On the basis of this clear pronouncement, non-Aryans and untouchables have no right to keep cows. Aryans and Brahmins whenever they wish can kill them and appropriate their possessions. Hindu culture thus becomes the culture of the progress, civilization and welfare of the Aryan people alone.</p>
<p>Indra Ji is very ruthless against his opponents. He can go to any extent to ruin them, even kidnapping women. Rigveda 5:30:7-9 mentions the following</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="671" height="405" class="wp-image-7338" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-i0-wp-com-www-islamhinduism-com-images-sto.gif" alt="https://i0.wp.com/www.islamhinduism.com/images/stories/rig_5_30_8.gif" /></p>
<p><strong>7 Thou, Maghavan, from the first didst scatter foemen, speeding, while joying in the milk, the Giver. There, seeking man’s prosperity, thou torest away the head of Namuci the Dasa.</strong></p>
<p><strong>8 Pounding the head of Namuci the Dasa, me, too thou madest thine associate, Indra! Yea, and the rolling stone that is in heaven both worlds, as on a car, brought to the Maruts.</strong></p>
<p><strong>9 Women for weapons hath the Dasa taken, What injury can his feeble armies To me? Well he distinguished his two different voices, and Indra then advanced to fight the Dasyu.</strong></p>
<p>Indra Ji is given many epithets like <em>Vajradhaari, vṛtrahan, Dasyuhan, </em>etc. How can peace prevail in the world when these kinds of prejudiced teachings are there in the Vedas?</p>
<p>Vedic wars were mainly fought to gain cattle and other booty, as is clearly mentioned in Rigveda 6:26:1-2</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="643" height="280" class="wp-image-7339" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-i0-wp-com-www-islamhinduism-com-images-sto-1.gif" alt="https://i0.wp.com/www.islamhinduism.com/images/stories/rig_6_26_1.gif" /></p>
<p><strong>1. O INDRA, hear us. Raining down the Soma, we call on thee to win us mighty valour. Give us strong succour on the day of trial, when the tribes gather on the field of battle.</strong></p>
<p><strong>2 The warrior, son of warrior sire, invokes thee, to gain great strength that may be won as booty: To thee, the brave man’s Lord, the fiends’ subduer, he looks when fighting hand to hand for cattle.</strong></p>
<p>Like Indra, other deities are also of a warrior mentality. Again and again prayers are made to them to obtain the wealth of the enemies and conquer their territories.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Inhumane Principles of Vedic Warfare with special reference to Arya Samaj</strong></p>
<p>Now see the extreme sadist mentality of Vedic followers, who fought wars to gain cows and wealth. Their are specific prayers in the Vedas about conquering the foes and gaining their wealth. The conquered people were later humiliated in the most abusive ways. For example, Rigveda 10:166 says,</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="649" height="629" class="wp-image-7340" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-i1-wp-com-www-islamhinduism-com-images-sto-1.gif" alt="https://i1.wp.com/www.islamhinduism.com/images/stories/rig_10_166.gif" /></p>
<p><strong>“1. MAKE me a bull among my peers, make me my rivals, conqueror: Make me the slayer of my foes, a sovran ruler, lord of kine</strong></p>
<p><strong>2 I am my rivals’ slayer, like Indra unwounded and unhurt, And all these enemies of mine are vanquished and beneath my feet.</strong></p>
<p><strong>3 Here, verily, I bind you fast, as the two bow-ends with the string. Press down these men, O Lord of Speech, that they may humbly speak to me.</strong></p>
<p><strong>4 Hither I came as conqueror with mighty all-effecting power, And I have mastered all your thought, your synod, and your holy work.</strong></p>
<p><strong>5 May I be highest, having gained your strength in war, your skill in peace my feet have trodden on your heads. Speak to me from beneath my feet, as frogs from out the water croak, as frogs from out the water croak.”</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>BURN THE ENEMIES ALIVE<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Yajurveda Chapter 13; Mantra 12 says</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="523" height="273" class="wp-image-7341" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-i2-wp-com-www-islamhinduism-com-images-sto.gif" alt="https://i2.wp.com/www.islamhinduism.com/images/stories/yajur_13_12.gif" /></p>
<p><strong>“O King, make progress in thy duty of administration, extend happiness to the religious. O terrible chastiser, burn down the irreligious foes. O splendid person, humiliate and consume utterly like dried up stubble, him, who encourages our foe.”</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>BURN THE KITCHENS/KITCHEN GARDENS OF THE ENEMIES<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Yajurveda Chapter 13; Mantra 13 says</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="516" height="325" class="wp-image-7342" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-i1-wp-com-www-islamhinduism-com-images-sto-2.gif" alt="https://i1.wp.com/www.islamhinduism.com/images/stories/yajur_13_13.gif" /></p>
<p><strong>“O King, rise high, punish the wicked foes righteously, manifest the objects prepared by our steady scholars, enhance pleasures. Destroy the kitchens and other places of plundering of the vigorous enemies. Kill the foes. I settle you with fire’s ardour.”</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>PUT YOUR ENEMIES IN THE JAWS OF FEROCIOUS ANIMALS<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Yajurveda Chapter 15; Mantra 15 says</p>
<p><strong>“…Let injurious animals like Lions and others that eat fresh and grass be destroyed.  Let murderous crowds of men that destroy others like a powerful weapon, be killed.  Let virtuous rulers protect us from those animals, and make us comfortable.  In the jaws of these animals we place the ferocious man whom we hate and who hates us.“</strong></p>
<p>I am sure that our society will not allow Vedic followers to kill the Lions. A person who has common sense, will never accept this unscientific teaching.  Lions by nature, eat flesh.  This verse wants to make them herbivorous. If this teaching is implemented, Lions will become extinct.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>WHO ARE THE ENEMIES?<br />
</strong></p>
<p>But there is still one thing unclear. Who are the enemies whose inhumane killing is being encouraged in the above mantras? Well, let the Vedas answer for themselves.</p>
<p>Atharvaved 12:5:62 says,</p>
<p><strong>“Rend, rend to bits, rend through and through, scorch and consume and burn to dust, the one who rejects the Vedas.”</strong></p>
<p>I do not think the above verse leaves any ambiguity as to who the enemies mentioned in the Vedas are. The mantra speaks for itself. It also prescribes the most gruesome forms of slaughter of those who disbelieve in the Vedas.</p>
<p>The same Sookt (hymn) also commands the following in mantras 65-71,</p>
<p><strong>65) So, O Goddess, do thou from him, the Brāhmans’ tyrant,  criminal, niggard, blasphemer of the Gods,  66) With hundred-knotted thunderbolt, sharpened and edged with razor-blades, 67)Strike off the shoulders and the head. 68) Snatch thou the hair from off his head, and from his body strip the skin: 69) Tear out his sinews, cause his flesh to fall in pieces from his frame. 70) Crush thou his bones together, strike and beat the marrow out of him. 71) Dislocate all his limbs and joints.</strong></p>
<p>I wonder what type of mindset would have written this horrendous stuff? This extreme sadist mentality which relishes in instructing such horrible torture deserves to be banned forever before it is put to practice.  One can imagine what would have happened at the time when such teachings would have been enforced thousands of years back. These teachings were recently put into effect when innocent Muslims were burnt alive and tortured in the Indian State of Gujrat, Christians were burnt alive in many places of India especially in Orrisa. Jains and Buddhists in ancient times and Muslims, Christians and Sikhs in recent times have been made the experimental mice of these teachings.</p>
<p>Also supportig the idea that the enemies mentioned in the Vedas in fact refer to people of other religions, we have the following prayer made in Atharvaved 20:93:1.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="537" height="255" class="wp-image-7343" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-i1-wp-com-www-islamhinduism-com-images-sto-3.gif" alt="https://i1.wp.com/www.islamhinduism.com/images/stories/atharva_20_93_1.gif" /></p>
<p><strong>May our hymns give you great delight. Display your bounty, Thunderer. Drive off the enemies of the Vedas.”</strong></p>
<p>The next mantra mentions</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="477" height="216" class="wp-image-7344" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-i2-wp-com-www-islamhinduism-com-images-sto-1.gif" alt="https://i2.wp.com/www.islamhinduism.com/images/stories/atharva_20_93_2.gif" /></p>
<p><strong>“Crush with your foot the niggard churls who bring no gifts. Mighty are you: There is not one to equal you.”</strong></p>
<p>The above mantras also make the identity of the enemy clear. The enemies are those who do not pray to the Vedic gods and bring them no gifts. The same is mentioned in Rigveda 8:53:1-2.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>PLUNDER THE ENEMIES WEALTH<br />
</strong></p>
<p>As has been said before that Vedic wars were motivated to a great extent by capturing more wealth, I will now provide even more evidence for this.</p>
<p><strong>“Handless be these our enemies! We enervate their languid limbs. So let us part among ourselves, in hundreds, Indra! all their wealth.” [Atharvaved 6:66:3]</strong></p>
<p>Rigveda 1:7:4 mentions,</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="473" height="298" class="wp-image-7345" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-i2-wp-com-www-islamhinduism-com-images-sto-2.gif" alt="https://i2.wp.com/www.islamhinduism.com/images/stories/rig_1_7_4.gif" /></p>
<p><strong>“Help us, O Indra, in the frays, yea, frays, where thousand spoils are gained, With awful aids, O awful One.”</strong></p>
<p>In Rigveda 10:84:2 it is said,</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="475" height="315" class="wp-image-7346" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-i2-wp-com-www-islamhinduism-com-images-sto-3.gif" alt="https://i2.wp.com/www.islamhinduism.com/images/stories/rig_10_84_2.gif" /></p>
<p><strong>Flashing like fire, be thou, O conquering Manyu, invoked, O Victor, as our army’s leader. Slay thou our foes, distribute their possessions: show forth thy vigour, scatter those who hate us.</strong></p>
<p>At many places such prayers are made to destroy the enemies and gain their wealth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>BOOTY OF WAR<br />
</strong></p>
<p>What constitutes the booty of war in the Vedic religion? Maharishi Manu describes the war booty on the basis of the Vedas.</p>
<p><strong>“Chariots and horses, elephants, parasols, money, grain, cattle, women, all sorts of (marketable) goods and valueless metals belong to him who takes them (singly) conquering (the possessor).”</strong></p>
<p><strong>“A text of the Veda (declares) that (the soldiers) shall present a choice portion (of this booty) to the king; what has not been taken singly, must be distributed by the king among all the soldiers.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Manu Smriti 7:96-97]</strong></p>
<p>Women also are considered part of the war booty in the above passages and are to be divided like other objects.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>No Universal Brotherhood in the Vedas<br />
</strong></p>
<p>The texts of the Vedas and other Hindu scriptures clearly show that they do not regard non-Aryans races as brothers, nor did they wish any good to the non-worshippers of the Aryan gods. They only wished their extirpation and their annihilation. Out of a large number of passages bearing on this subject, I quote the following:</p>
<p><strong>“He who dwells fixed in the atmosphere, smiting the blasphemers of the god that do not sacrifice, to him be reverence with ten sakvarî-stanzas!” [Atharvaved 11:2:23]</strong></p>
<p>The texts of the Vedas seem to leave no doubt that they recognize a distinction between the tribe to which the authors of the hymns belonged and a hostile people who observed different rites, and were regarded with contempt and hatred by the superior race. Their is no doubt that in many passages of the Rigveda the words <em>Dasa </em>and <em>Dasyu</em> are applied to the aboriginal tribes of India. Let us see what Maharishi Manu says,</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="372" height="59" class="wp-image-7347" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-i2-wp-com-www-islamhinduism-com-images-sto-4.gif" alt="https://i2.wp.com/www.islamhinduism.com/images/stories/manu_10_45.gif" /></p>
<p><strong>“All those tribes in this world, which are excluded from (the community of) those born from the mouth, the arms, the thighs, and the feet (of Brahman), are called Dasyus, whether they speak the language of the Mlecchas or that of the Aryans. [Manu 10:45]</strong></p>
<p>The distinction between Aryas and Dasyus is not on the basis of character but on the basis nationality as is clearly demarcated by Manu Smriti 2:21-23.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="363" height="175" class="wp-image-7348" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-i1-wp-com-www-islamhinduism-com-images-sto-4.gif" alt="https://i1.wp.com/www.islamhinduism.com/images/stories/manu_2_21-23.gif" /></p>
<p><strong>“21. That (country) which (lies) between the Himavat and the Vindhya (mountains) to the east of Prayaga and to the west of Vinasana (the place where the river Sarasvati disappears) is called Madhyadesa (the central region).</strong></p>
<p><strong>22. But (the tract) between those two mountains (just mentioned), which (extends) as far as the eastern and the western oceans, the wise call Aryavarta (the country of the Aryans).</strong></p>
<p><strong>23. That land where the black antelope naturally roams, one must know to be fit for the performance of sacrifices; (the tract) different from that (is) the country of the Mlecchas (barbarians).”</strong></p>
<p>Only Aryavarta aka India is the place where noble people are found and the rest of the world is filled with evil people. Thus as per the Vedic worldview, Aryas as called Aryas (Noble) because they belong to the Aryavarta and Mlecchas and Dasyus are called so not because they are evil but because they are foreigners.</p>
<p>So, Vedas give the following solution to deal with the Dasyus who do not share the faith of the Aryas.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="619" height="113" class="wp-image-7349" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-i2-wp-com-www-islamhinduism-com-images-sto-5.gif" alt="https://i2.wp.com/www.islamhinduism.com/images/stories/rig_1_176_4.gif" /></p>
<p><strong>“Slay everyone who pours no gift, who, hard to reach, delights thee not. Bestow on us what wealth he hath: this even the worshipper awaits.” [Rigveda 1:176:4]</strong></p>
<p>What language could be stronger against one’s enemies than this?  This is sheer bigotry. The quotations already made sufficiently illustrate the hatred of the Aryans for the other religions. For more of this bigotry you can see Rigveda 8:2:18, 8:45:23, 8:51:12, 8:53:1,2.</p>
<p>As far as we have seen, there is no trace to be found in the hymns of the Vedas about the brotherhood of man.  On the other hand, there is abundant evidence of an intense hostility cherished towards the non Aryan tribes.</p>
<p>There was also not the very best of feelings even among the Rishis towards one another. There are unmistakable references in the hymns to a deadly feud between Rishi Vashishtha and Rishi Vishvamitra and of a curse laid on the former by the latter. The details of these feuds will be dealt with in another article.</p>
<p>This article is an attempt to refute the Vedic propagandists who are so eager to malign Islam and yet choose to turn a blind eye to their own scriptures. I can only remind them of this wise saying of Jesus Christ (peace be upon him),</p>
<p><strong>“Judge not, that you be not judged. For with the judgment you pronounce you will be judged, and with the measure you use it will be measured to you.  Why do you see the speck that is in your brother’s eye, but do not notice the log that is in your own eye? ” [Mark 7:1]</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Written by Sulaiman Razvi</p>
<p>Vulgarity in Vedas is already discussed in the article <a href="/index.php/2014/05/15/there-is-indeed-obscenity-in-vedas/" data-wpel-link="internal">Obscenity in Vedas</a>. In this article, I shall deal with vulgarities in other Hindu scriptures. Hindus&#8217; favourite topic to discuss is sexuality. Hindu fanatics enjoy a lot mocking others religions with fake references and the only solution to this seems to be showing some facts about their gods and sages from their own books. As I said in the article Obscenity in Vedas, I have no intention to mock Hindu religious personalities or hurt the sentiments of Hindus. Their vilification of other religions doesn’t seem to end and it looks like just a refutation to Hindu fanatics isn’t enough, Hinduism has to be decoded to show those fanatics what they follow. Hindu fanatics just by watching epic movies like Mahabharata and Ramayana on television start believing Hinduism to be the most decent religion and are under the impression that Hindu gods were the greatest being on earth. As far as my knowledge is concerned, Hindus started writing against Islam from the 19<sup>th</sup> century onwards, Muslim scholars at that time only refuted those Islamophobic books but they didn’t expose Hinduism, this was like encouragement to Hindus. Filth of every kind is found in Hinduism whether it is rape, bride/daughter selling, pedophilia, sodomy, homosexuality, molestation, prostitution, a pornographic book like Kamasutra, or obscene idols on temples in spite of all these Hindus have the audacity to point fingers at others. Can you imagine how Hindus would have made fun of other religions if they had even 10% of the filth found in Hinduism?</p>
<p><span id="more-1854"></span><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1" height="1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8868 " src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/img_62a73ae93c061.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>As a matter of fact, Hindu gods were no different from present Swamis and other Hindu priests who are caught in rape and murder cases. The shameless act of their gods is well preserved in their own scriptures. If a religion can be blamed for terrorism only because of its few followers, then why Hinduism shouldn’t be blamed for the rapists&#8217; Swamis who are caught in large numbers? After all, Swamis are representatives of the Hindu religion, then why spare them? Rape and Murder have become like eligibility to become Swami. I was embarrassed to write this article because many verses are so obscene that they cannot be discussed openly. Nowadays Hindus are very actively insulting other religions on the internet, this compelled me to write this article.<br />
<span id="top"></span></p>
<h2><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Description of Women</span></h2>
<p>Hindu texts’ description of Women is an insult to all women. It insults women in the following way,</p>
<p>Mahabharata 13.40 “Bhishma said, ‘It is even so as thou sayest, O thou of mighty arms. There is nothing untrue in all this that thou sayest, O thou of Kuru’s race, on the subject of women. In this connection I shall recite to thee the old history of how in days of yore the high-souled Vipula had succeeded in restraining women within the bounds laid down for them. I shall also tell thee, O king, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">how women were created by the Grandsire Brahman and the object for which they were created by Him. There is no creature more sinful, O son, than women. Woman is a blazing fire. She is the illusion</span>, O king, that the Daitya Maya created. She is the sharp edge of the razor. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">She is poison. She is a snake</span>. She is fire. She is, verily, all these united together. It has been heard by us that all persons of the human race are characterised by righteousness, and that they, in course of natural progress and improvement, attain to the status of deities. This circumstance alarmed the deities. They, therefore, O chastiser of foes, assembled together and repaired to the presence of the Grandsire. Informing Him of what was in their minds, they stood silent in his presence, with downcast eyes. <span style="color: #ff0000;">The puissant Grand sire having ascertained what was in the hearts of the deities, created women</span>, with the aid of an Atharvan rite. In a former creation, O son of Kunti, women were all virtuous. Those, however, that sprang from this creation by Brahman with the aid of an illusion became sinful. The grandsire bestowed upon them the desire of enjoyment, all kinds of carnal pleasure. Tempted by the desire of enjoyment, they began to pursue persons of the other sex. The puissant lord of the deities created Wrath as the companion of Lust. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Persons of the male sex, yielding to the power of Lust and Wrath, sought the companionship of women. Women have no especial acts prescribed for them. Even this is the ordinance that was laid down</span>. The Sruti declares that women are endued with senses the most powerful, that they have no scriptures to follow, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">and that they are living lies</span>.” Tr. Kisari Mohan Ganguli</p>
<p>This passage from Mahabharata shows that in the beginning all men were righteous and due to their righteousness they were going to attain the status of Deity. But Hindu gods were afraid and wondered how to stop them and for this reason they created women. Although the creator of the universe Brahma himself lusted after his own daughter. This shows that women have no especial acts prescribed and are created only to make men fall from righteousness. The next passage is from Srimad Bhagavatam which is also known as Bhagvad Purana,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 9.14.36-38 ”Urvasi said: My dear King, you are a man, a hero. Don’t be impatient and give up your life. Be sober and don’t allow the senses to overcome you like foxes. Don’t let the foxes eat you. In other words, you should not be controlled by your senses. Rather, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">you should know that the heart of a woman is like that of a fox</span>. There is no use making friendship with women. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Women as a class are merciless and cunning</span>. They cannot tolerate even a slight offense. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">For their own pleasure they can do anything irreligious</span>, and therefore they do not fear killing even a faithful husband or brother. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Women are very easily seduced by men</span>…” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>The description of women given by another Apsara to a Sage named Narada is also an insult, I won’t highlight those ugly words,</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, UmaSamhita 5.24.16-36 ”There is none more sinning and more sinful than women. Women are at the root of all sins…Women usually do not observe the limitations of conventional decency. If at all they stand by them with their husbands it is because no man makes advances to them or because they are afraid of their husbands…They carry on their dalliances with any man ugly or beautiful…Even women of noble families aspire for the life of lascivious women who in their prime of youth adorned with lovable ornaments and beautiful wearing garments move about frivolously…Women become desperate when they do not get men…women are not satiated with the number of men they cohabit with. O excellent sage, there is another secret of all women that immediately on seeing a man their vaginal passage begins to exude slimy secretions. On seeing a man fresh and clean from his bath with his body perfumed with sweet scents, the vaginal passage of women begins to exude like water dripping from a leather bag…on hearing her words Narada was satisfied in his mind. Considering it to be the truth.” Tr. Board of Scholars, Edited by Jagdish Lal Shastri</p>
<p>The entire chapter 24 of Shiva Purana is dedicated in insulting women. Had this been the personal views of Apsara there wouldn’t be an entire chapter for this and even Sage Narada considered it to be truth and was satisfied by her words. The founder of ISKCON Swami Prabhupada writes,</p>
<p>”<span style="color: #ff0000;">The heavenly pleasure for the conditioned soul is sexual pleasure</span>, and this pleasure is tasted by the genitals. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The woman is the object of sexual pleasure</span>, and both the sense perception of sexual pleasure and the woman are controlled by the Prajapati, who is under the control of the Lord’s genitals…” A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada on Srimad Bhagavatam 2.10.26 [ <a href="http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_2.10.26" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_2.10.26<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> ]
<p>Mahabharata 5.39.67 ”The fruits of the Vedas are ceremonies performed before the (homa) fire; the fruits of an acquaintance with the scriptures are goodness of disposition and conduct. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The fruits of women are the pleasures of intercourse and offspring</span>.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>I shall not indulge further in what Hindu scriptures say about women. An entire book can be written on this issue. As for now, these references will suffice. So in short women are like sly foxes, cunning, poisonous snakes, sex-maniac, bad luck, destitute of knowledge and intelligence, can’t inherit property… But are an object of lust and a child production factory.

<p>Swami Prabhupada the founder of ISKCON writes,</p>
<p><strong>”…</strong>In this regard, the word vikhyātam is very significant. A man is always famous for his aggression toward a beautiful woman, <span style="color: #ff0000;">and such aggression is sometimes considered rape</span>. Although rape is not legally allowed, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">it is a fact that a woman likes a man who is very expert at rape</span>.” A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada on Srimad Bhagavatam 4.25.41 [ <a href="http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_4.25.41" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_4.25.41<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> ]
<p>Readers are requested to read the commentary on next verse also after going to the above given link. Swami Prabhupada also writes,</p>
<p>”Both man and woman desire one another; that is the basic principle of material existence. Women in general always keep themselves beautiful so that they can be attractive to their lusty husbands. When a lusty husband comes before his wife, the wife takes advantage of his aggressive activities and enjoys life. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Generally when a woman is attacked by a man-whether her husband or some other man—she enjoys the attack, being too lusty</span>…”A.C.

<p>Is it really true that women enjoy being raped? And does she really like rapists? What made such a great scholar like Swami Prabhupada utter this? Well, actually almost every Hindu god raped women, Below are some references. Almost every rapist Hindu scholar claims to be an incarnation of Krishna,</p>

<p>Matsya Purana not only allows sex with a prostitute and concubine, but also allows gang rape of a concubine/prostitute, the fine is her payment.</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 227.142-6 &#8220;&#8230;a twice born indulging with a whore should be made to pay her wages&#8230;If a man after bringing a harlot does not indulge with her, the king should make him pay her twice as much and should levy a similar amount of fine for himself. Dharma will not thereby be upset. If a number of people forcibly indulge with a concubine, the king should make each one of them pay her double the amount of her wages.&#8221; Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>VISHNU</strong></p>
<p>Vishnu is said to have raped Tulsi/Vrinda by assuming the guise of her husband. What can be more disgusting than a god raping a chaste lady? And much worse is the celebration of this rape as a festival, yes you read it right. Hindus proudly celebrate the rape of Vrinda by Vishnu as a festival called Tulsi Vivah.</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Rudra Samhita 2, Yudha Khanda 5, Ch 23.38-45 ”On seeing her husband, Vrnda too was delighted. She forgot her sorrow. She considered everything a dream. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Delighted in the heart and with all the dormant passions kindled up, </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">she sported with him</span><span style="color: #ff0000;"> for many days in the middle of that forest</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Once at the end of the sexual intercourse she realised that it was Visnu. Vrnda rebuked him angrily and spoke thus. Vrnda said:—Fie on this misdeed of Visnu in outraging the modesty of another man’s wife</span>. I have now realised you as the wielder of illusion, <span style="color: #ff0000;">appearing in the guise of an ascetic</span>. Sanatkumara said:—O Vyasa, saying thus in great anger she showed her brilliant powers as a staunch <span style="color: #ff0000;">chaste lady by cursing Visnu</span>. “O base foe of the Daityas, defiler of other people’s virtue, O wicked one, take this curse from me, greater in force than all persons. The two persons whom you made to appear in front of me shall become Raksasas and abduct your wife. You will be distressed on account of separation from your wife roaming about with Sesa ‘lord of snakes’ who posed as your disciple here. You will seek the help of monkeys in the forest.” Tr. Board of Scholars, Edited by Jagdish Lal Shastri</p>
<p>This story is also supported by Skanda Purana II.iv.21-10-24, Shiva Purana, Rudra Samhita 2, Yudha Khanda 5, Ch 41 verses 1-35, Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Prakriti Khanda 21.18-31 and also mentioned in Devi Bhagavatam 9.24.14-22 with a slight variation, readers can check Devi Bhagavatam verses which are available online at <a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/db/bk09ch24.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Sacred-texts.com<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. I will avoid posting the same story from different scriptures as I don’t want to flood this article with several passages. The variation of this story is in only in names, the name of Tulasi also appears as Vrinda and her husband Shankachuda’s name is replaced by Jalandhar.</p>
<p>This poor lady named Vrinda/Tulasi was a devotee of Vishnu, it must have been so disheartening for her to be raped by the man whom she worshipped so devotedly every day. As per Shiva Purana, Rudra Samhita section 5, Ch 41.3-5 Vishnu assumed the form of her husband and raped her on the behest of Shiva. It was Shiva who ordered such a heinous act. This was done with an intention to kill her husband on the battlefield, it is said that her husband Shankachuda/Jalandhar couldn’t be killed unless the chastity of his wife is outraged. Shiva is part of Trimurti and is considered the Destroyer but Shiva the so-called Destroyer couldn’t destroy Jalandhar/Shankachuda so he commanded Vishnu to go and rape Vrinda/Tulsi. She cursed Vishnu to become a rock and that in his next incarnation (as Rama) his wife (Sita) will be kidnapped by a demon and he will have to seek the help of monkeys (Hanuman/VanarSena). As per this story, Ravana made no mistake by kidnapping Sita the wife of Rama, as this was already destined to happen. And was a result of Ram’s past deeds (rape of Vrinda/Tulasi).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>INDRA</strong></p>
<p>Indra was quite popular among gods and sages for ravishing others’ wives and had done this to Ahalya by assuming the form of her husband Sage Gautama,</p>
<p>Skanda Purana V.iii.136.2-16 ”There was a Brahmana named Gautama who was like another Brahma. He was endowed with truthfulness and piety. He was engrossed in the Vanaprastha stage of life. His blessed wife named Ahalya was very famous in all the three worlds as a woman endowed with beauty and prime of youth. Satakratu [Indra], the king of Devas, was infatuated by the exceptional beauty of Ahalya. The Slayer of Bala, therefore, tempted her. ”O beautiful lady of uncensured features, resort to me, the king of Devas, Sport about with me. You shall be one honoured in all the three worlds. What will you do with this Brahmana who has become lean and emaciated due to his over-zealousness for purity and conventional rites and austerities and Vedic studies! O lady of beautiful eyes, you must be rather undergoing sufferings now.”…<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Getting an opportunity, he assumed the excellent guise of the sage and carnally delighted Ahalya who believed (that he was Gautama) in the inner apartment</span>. Within a moment thereafter, O descendant of Bharata, the excellent sage hurriedly entered the apartment. On seeing Gautama come Purandara became terrified and he went out. Seeing him he thought (knew) that it was Sakra. So Gautama became highly enraged and he cursed Devendra: ”Since you could not control your senses, be one with a thousand vaginal apertures.” On being cursed thus, Devendra was instantly covered with a thousand vaginal apertures.” Tr. Ganesh Vasudeo Tagare</p>
<p>This story is also mentioned in Brahma Purana, Gautami-Mahatmya Part IV.16.39-44 and Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Krishna Janma Khanda chapter 61. When Indra saw sage Gautama going out with his disciples, he took it as an opportunity and raped Ahalya by assuming Gautama’s form and Ahalya wasn’t aware of this, As per Brahma Purana Gautami-Mahatmya part IV.16.51 she asked Indra ‘who are you’ and she suddenly got up from the bed. When Gautama caught Indra’s licentious act he cursed Indra as well as his wife Ahalya. The curse on Indra by Gautama is quite funny. As a result of the curse, Indra lost his testicles and penis and also had one thousand marks of vagina all over his body,</p>
<p>Brahma Purana, Gautami-Mahatmya 16.59 Gautama said:- ”Sin has been committed by you due to your passion for the vagina. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Hence become a person with a thousand vaginas in your body</span>”. Tr. Board of Scholars, Edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Mahabharata 12.343.19-57 ”In consequence of his </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">licentious assault on Ahalya</span><span style="color: #000000;">, Indra was cursed by Gautama, her husband, through which Indra got a green beard on his face. Through that curse of Kausika </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Indra lost, also, his own testicles</span><span style="color: #000000;">, which loss was afterwards (through the kindness of the other deities) made up by the substitution of the testicles of a ram.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</span></p>
<p>This is also mentioned in,</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana 1.2.27.23 ”Formerly, the penis of Indra along with his scrotum, O sage conversant with virtue, was made to fall down on the earth by the infuriated sage Gautama.” Tr. Ganesh Vasudeo Tagare</p>
<p>Swami Prabhupada wrote,</p>
<p>”…Once he [Indra] raped the wife of Gautama Muni by using his disappearing art, and similarly by becoming invisible he stole the horse of Maharaja Prthu….” A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada on Srimad Bhagawatam 4.24.5 [ <a href="http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_4.24.5" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_4.24.5<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> ]
<p>Indra somehow got the scrotum of a ram fixed in his body, and the marks of thousand vaginas were later turned into thousand visions.</p>
<p>Brahma Vaivarta Purana mentioned the rape of Rambha by Indra. Rambha was the daughter of Sucandara and wife of King Janamejaya. King Janamejaya had planned to perform Ashvamedha Yajna but Indra stole the sacrificial horse, Indra raped queen Rambha in the stable after which she committed suicide due to the assault by Vedic Devta Indra. Indra wasn’t remorseful but he feared consequences by king Janamejaya and fled to Indralok. This seems to be another version of the story mentioned in Harivamsa Purana Bhavishya Parva 3.5.11-13 which I discussed in <a href="/index.php/2018/05/14/ashvamedha-yajna-the-obscene-ritual/" data-wpel-link="internal">Ashvamedha Yajna</a> article.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Krishna Janma Khanda, chapter 14, verses 45-51 &#8220;&#8230;now I am going to narrate the story of Rambha to you, Rambha was born in the land of Bharata as daughter of Sucandara&#8230;the king Sucandra gave away his daughter in marriage to Janamejaya along with several riches&#8230;The king enjoyed her company at several places. Once the king started and Asvamedha sacrifice. At that point of time Indra stole away the sacrificial horse and concealed himself in the royal palaces. Thinking that the Sacrificial horse would be quite beautiful she went to the stable alone playfully. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><u>On reaching the horse, Indra appeared on the scene and forcibly enjoyed her company. He had sex with her in spite of her objecting to it</u></span>. After the performance, Indra was fainted and he lost the senses about the day or night. The beautiful ladies coming in touch with Indra ended her life and Indra getting terrified from the king went back to the heaven.&#8221; Tr. Shanti Lal Nagar, edited by Acharya Ramesh Chaturvedi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>SHIVA</strong></p>
<p>Bhagavad Purana states that Shiva tried to force himself on a naked woman,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 8.12.26-30 ”<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The beautiful woman was already naked</span>, and when She saw Lord Siva coming toward Her, She became extremely bashful. Thus She kept smiling, but She hid Herself among the trees and did not stand in one place. His senses being agitated, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Lord Siva, victimized by lusty desires, began to follow Her</span>, just as a lusty elephant follows a she-elephant. After following Her with great speed, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Lord Siva caught Her by the braid of Her hair and dragged Her near him</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Although She was unwilling, he embraced Her with his arms</span>. Being embraced by Lord Siva like a female elephant embraced by a male, the woman, whose hair was scattered, swirled like a snake. O King, this woman, who had large, high hips, was a woman of yogamaya presented by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">She released Herself somehow or other from the fond embrace of Lord Siva’s arms and ran away</span>.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>This is sexual harassment and if a man does this in the present age he would surely be put behind the bars for an attempt to rape. The above verses are explained briefly in the LGBT section. This is Shiva’s rape of Vishnu (Mohini).</p>
<p><strong>SOMA</strong></p>
<p>Soma is said to have raped Brihaspati’s wife Tara,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 9.14.4 ”After conquering the three worlds [the upper, middle and lower planetary systems], Soma, the moon-god, performed a great sacrifice known as the Rājasūya-yajña. Because he was very much puffed up, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">he forcibly kidnapped Bṛhaspati’s wife, whose name was Tara”</span>. Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Krishna Janma Khanda 80.9-19 ”[Tara to Soma]…And if you commit rape with me, you will surely be guilty of woman slaughter. But when the Moon, without minding her words was about to commit rape with her, the dispassionate chaste woman cursed him thus…<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">In spite of the curse however, the Moon, held her and associated with her</span>. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Afterwards, holding the sorrowful, weeping wife of the Guru in his lap, he left that place</span>.” Tr. Rajendra Nath Sen</p>
<p>It is also mentioned in Brahmanda Purana 2.3.72.29. Brihaspati is considered the Guru of all Gods. Soma without thinking about violating the bed of the guru raped the preceptor’s wife. But Brihaspati was not an angel, he too had raped a woman.</p>
<p><strong>BRIHASPATI</strong></p>
<p>Brihaspati the Guru of all Gods raped his own pregnant sister-in-law named Mamata. A man with what kind of heart would do that?</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 49.17-28 ”Suta said:- Brihaspati, whilst staying on Earth, one day saw the wife of his brother, Usija, who was big with child, and addressed her thus:- ”Dress thyself well and let us enjoy.” She, being thus addressed, replied to Brihaspati thus:- ”The embryo in my womb is mature and is already reciting the Vedas. Thy seed will also not be fruitless and thy proposal is sinful.” Hearing which, Brihaspati said:- ”I need not to be taught morality by thee, O sweet one.” <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">After saying that, he carried out his desire by force</span>…” Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, Edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>This rape is also mentioned in Vayu Purana Part 2, 37.140 and  <a href="http://sacred-texts.com/hin/m01/m01105.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Mahabharata Adi Parva 1.104<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> but the translator K.M. Ganguli has translated those particular lines of Mahabharata into Latin language. This story of Mamata’s rape is also mentioned in Srimad Bhagavatam,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 9.20.36 ”When the demigod named Bṛhaspati was attracted by his brother’s wife, Mamata, who at that time was pregnant, he desired to have sexual relations with her. The son within her womb forbade this, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">but Bṛhaspati cursed him and forcibly discharged semen into the womb of Mamata</span>.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>The rape of Mamata is also mentioned in Brahmanda Purana 2.3.74.37-42. It was like a battle of rape going on between Hindu gods like Soma, Indra, and Brihaspati. All of them raped women which is also mentioned in Purana in one single passage,</p>
<p>Srimad Devi Bhagavatam 4.15.59-64 ”Look! <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The Moon stole away per force knowingly the wife of Brihaspati; Indra, knowing what is religion stole away the wife of Gautama; Brihaspati enjoyed forcibly the wife of his younger</span>; and also he outraged his elder brother’s wife in her pregnant state and cursed the boy in the womb…” Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p><strong>VARUNA</strong></p>
<p>Varuna is the god of water. He is praised in several hymns of the Vedas. A story mentioned in the Mahabharata tells us Varuna’s rape of Bhadra another wife of Utathya,</p>
<p>Mahabharata 13.154.10-17 ”…’Hear now, O king, the story of Utathya who was born in the race of Angiras. The daughter of Soma, named Bhadra, came to be regarded as unrivalled in beauty. Her sire Soma regarded Utathya to be the fittest of husbands for her…the handsome <span style="color: #ff0000;">Varuna had, from a long time before, coveted the girl</span>. Coming to the woods where Utathya dwelt, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Varuna stole away the girl when she had plunged into the Yamuna for a bath. Abducting her</span> thus, the Lord of the waters took her to his own abode…There, within that palace, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">the Lord of waters; O king, sported with the damsel. A little while after, the fact of the ravishment of his wife was reported to Utathya</span>…” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p><strong>SURYA</strong></p>
<p>Surya is the Sun-God and several hymns of Vedas are dedicated to him. He raped the virgin Kunti. Kunti was just examining her mystic power and the sun god appeared before her and was smitten with passion after seeing young and beautiful Kunti and then raped her.</p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 2.6.13-35 ”…Surya Deva said :– “O Kunti! What for you called me, by virtue of the Mantra? Calling me, why do you not worship me, standing before you? O beautiful blue one! <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Seeing you, I have become passionate; so come to me. By means of the mantra, you have made me your subservient so take me for intercourse</span>.” Hearing this, Kunti said:– “O Witness of all! O knower of Dharma! <span style="color: #ff0000;">You know that I am a virgin girl</span>. O Suvrata! I bow down to you; I am a family daughter; <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">so do not speak ill to me</span>.” Surya then said :– “If I go away in vain, I will be an object of great shame, and, no doubt, will be laughed amongst the gods; So, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">O Kunti! If you do not satisfy me, I will immediately curse you</span></strong> and the Brahmin who has given you this mantra. O Beautiful one! If you satisfy me, your virginity will remain; no body will come to know and there will be born a son to you, exactly like me.” <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Thus saying Surya Deva enjoyed the bashful Kunti</span>, with her mind attracted towards him; He granted her the desired boons and went away. <span style="color: #ff0000;">The beautiful Kunti became pregnant and began to remain in a house, under great secrecy</span>. Only the dear nurse knew that; her mother or any other person was quite unaware of the fact. In time, a very beautiful son like the second Sun and Kartikeya, decked with a lovely Kavacha coat of mail and two ear-rings, was born there.” Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Their conversation is mentioned in detail in Srimad Bhagavatam,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 9.24.33-36 As soon as Kunti called for the demigod of the sun, he immediately appeared before her, and she was very much surprised. She told the sun-god, “<span style="color: #ff0000;">I was simply examining the effectiveness of this mystic power. I am sorry I have called you unnecessarily. Please return and excuse me</span>.” The sun-god said: O beautiful Pritha, your meeting with the demigods cannot be fruitless. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Therefore, let me place my seed in your womb so that you may bear a son</span>. I shall arrange to keep your virginity intact, since you are still an unmarried girl. After saying this, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">the sun-god discharged his semen into the womb of Pritha</span> and then returned to the celestial kingdom. Immediately thereafter, from Kunti a child was born, who was like a second sun-god. Because Kunti feared people’s criticisms, with great difficulty she had to give up her affection for her child. Unwillingly, she packed the child in a basket and let it float down the waters of the river. O Maharaja Parikshit, your great-grandfather the pious and chivalrous King Pandu later married Kunti.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>This son was later known as Karna. Kunti somehow tried to resist the rape by warning him not to do this, by telling him that she is from a good family, that she was only examining her powers, she is a virgin but all in vain. When Surya thought his sweet words are not going to seduce Kunti he threatened to curse her as a last resort. Poor Kunti had no choice but to get raped by the sun god. Surya devoid of any morality didn’t even care about rape and adultery, He just wanted to relieve his desire forcefully and went away but the poor Kunti had to pay the price for this act. As Kunti was not ready for all these things, she had to abandon her illegitimate child to avoid a bad name for her family and embarrassment. Kunti later married King Pandu. And after her marriage, the Sun god again had sex with Kunti but this time it was consensual sex which is explained in the Niyoga Section. The series of rape by the sun god doesn’t end her, He is said to have raped his own wife. He assumed another form and approached her. She tried to resist the rape but the Sun god successfully carried out his act. This is explained in the Oral Sex Section.</p>
<p><strong>ASHWINKUMARA</strong></p>
<p>Ashvinkumara was the son of the Sun God. He is said to have raped a Brahmin lady and impregnated her.</p>
<p>Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Brahma Kanda, 10.125-134 Saunaka was astonished at the words of Sauti and said, ‘Sir, what irony of fate led Aswinkumara, the offspring of the sun, to copulate with a Brahmin woman? Kindly narrate this incident and gratify my curiosity” Santi, the best of saints replied, ”O best of Munis, impossible are the ways of Providence . Once upon a time, this tranquil, strong offspring of the sun was enamoured of a Brahmin woman while she was going out on pilgrimage. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Though he was dissuaded by her again and again he </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">forcibly took her to a grove, ravished and impregnated her</span>. The lady, bewildered with shame and fear caused her own miscarriage…” Tr. Rajendra Nath Sen</p>
<p>Like father like son. Modern-day examples of Surya and Ashvinkumara are Asaram and his son Sai Narayana who are both convicted of raping women. Had these father-son duo (Asaram-Narayan) existed in the Vedic period they would have been worshiped by the people.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">BRAHMA</span></strong></p>
<p>Brahma the creator is said to have raped his own daughter Saraswati. It is explained in detail in the article <a href="/index.php/2016/05/05/brahmas-incestuous-relationship-with-his-daughter/" data-wpel-link="internal">Brahma’s incestuous relationship with his daughter</a> Saraswati.</p>
<p><strong>RAPE AND ABDUCTION ARE LEGITIMIZED</strong></p>

<p>The Hindu scripture lists several forms of marriage, one of them is known as Rakshasa marriage. Rape and abduction of females are legitimized under this form of marriage. Maharshi Manu explains Rakshasa marriage in the following way,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 3.33 The forcible abduction of a maiden from her home, while she cries out and weeps, after (her kinsmen) have been slain or wounded and (their houses) broken open, is called the Rakshasa rite.</p>
<p>Swami Prabhupada writes,</p>
<p>”…There are other kinds of marriage, such as gāndharva marriage and marriage by love, which are also accepted as marriage. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Even if one is forcibly kidnapped and later on accepted as a wife, that is also accepted</span>…” A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada on Srimad Bhagawatam 3.22.15 [ <a href="http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_3.22.15" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_3.22.15<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> ]
<p>This form of marriage is permitted for the Kshatriya caste,</p>
<p>Manu 3.24 “The four forms (of Marriage) the seers have ordained as proper for Brahmanas; only the Rakshasa form as proper for Kshatriyas, and the A’sura form as proper for Vais’yas and S’udras.” Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>It is also mentioned in Mahabharata,</p>
<p>Mahabharata 1.73.8-11 ”…There are, in all, eight kinds of marriages. These are Brahma, Daiva, Arsha, Prajapatya, Asura, Gandharva, Rakshasa, and Paisacha, the eighth. Manu, the son of the self-create, hath spoken of the appropriateness of all these forms according to their order. Know, O faultless one, that the first four of these are fit for Brahmanas, and the first six for Kshatriyas. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">As regards kings, even the Rakshasa form is permissible</span>. The Asura form is permitted to Vaisyas and Sudras. Of the first five the three are proper, the other two being improper. The Paisacha and the Asura forms should never be practised. These are the institutes of religion, and one should act according to them. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The Gandharva and the Rakshasa form are consistent with the practices of Kshatriyas</span>…” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Brihadarayaka Upanishad also promotes rape,</p>
<p>Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 6.4.7 ”If she does not willingly yield her body to him, he should buy her with presents. If she is still unyielding, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">he should strike her with a stick or with his hand and overcome her</span>, repeating the following mantra: “With power and glory I take away your glory.” Thus she becomes discredited.” Tr. Swami Nikhilananda</p>
<p>As far as enjoying numerous women is concerned, the Brahmins exclusively enjoy this right through Niyoga. Which we have already read in the article <a href="https://vedkabhed.wordpress.com/2014/05/15/there-is-indeed-obscenity-in-vedas/" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Obscenity in Vedas<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>.</p>
<p>Hinduism blames the victim in the case of rape, it says that by getting raped the woman incurs sin. Women have always been made to suffer in case of rape. When Ahalya was raped by Vedic god Indra, Ahalya’s husband Gautama Rishi didn’t accept Ahalya rather he cursed her. Sita too had to burn herself in Agni Pariksha because she was suspected of committing infidelity with Ravana who had abducted her. Parashar Smriti states a ritual by which a rape victim can “regain her purity.”</p>
<p>Parasara Smriti 10.25-26 “A woman forcibly ravished by a man, in captivity, as well as she, who accommodates a man on account of being physically over-powered, or out of a sense of danger to her life, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">should regain her purity by practising a Santapanam penance</span>. This is what has been enjoined by Parasara. A woman, who having been once ravished by another man, turns back with repugnance from the path of inequity, should expiate her sin by practising a Prajapatya penance, whereby she would be pure after her next monthly period.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>

<p>For people in heaven, Ishwar has arranged hundreds and thousands of Apsaras or ‘Harlot’ as per the term used by Hindus on this issue. Hindu fanatics try to make a mockery of Muslims on this issue but have they ever read what their scripture says about it? Ironically for them having wives in heaven is a lusty concept but they are okay with worshipping Krishna who had 16108 wives and numerous concubines. Hinduism states that those who die on the battlefield, those who do service to cows, and those who perform certain rituals will enjoy Apsaras in Svarga.</p>
<p>Parashara Smriti 3.28-29 <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Celestial damsels seize for themselves, and take delight with the hero</span>, whose body is wounded or cut by arrows, clubs, or maces. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Thousands of celestial damsels, rush forward in a hurry towards a hero killed in battle</span>, each proclaiming, ‘He is my lord, he is mine’.</p>
<p>Parashara Smriti 3.31 If victorious, wealth is won; <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">if death results, beautiful women fall to his share</span>; since this corporeal frame is liable to perish in an instant’s time, why should we be shy of meeting death on a field of battle?</p>
<p>Mahabharata 12.98.46-51 ”Foremost of Apsaras, numbering by thousands, go out with great speed (for receiving the spirit of the slain hero) coveting him for their lord.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Hindu fanatics should somehow make sure that their wives don’t immolate themselves in their funeral pyre. Because if the wife immolates with her husband then he can’t enjoy Virgins in heaven,</p>
<p>Srimad Devi Bhagavatam 3.15.10-13 ”<span style="color: #ff0000;">Some warriors on being slain in the battle instantly arose in a celestial car to the heavens </span>and <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">was seen addressing the celestial nymph, who came already within his embrace</span>, thus “O one of beautiful thighs. Behold! how my beautiful body is lying on the earth below!” <span style="color: #ff0000;">Another warrrior thus slain got up in the heavens on a celestial car, </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">came in possession of a celestial nymph</span> and when he was sitting with her in the car, <span style="color: #ff0000;">his former wife in the earth made herself a sati and burnt herself up in the funeral pyre</span>, thus got a celestial body, came up to the heavens; and <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">that chaste virtuous woman drew away perforce her own husband away from that celestial nymph</span>. Two warriors, went up, slew each other and lay down dead at the same time. They went up in the heavens at the same time and there began quarrel with each other and fight with their weapons for <span style="color: #ff0000;">one and the same celestial nymph</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Some hero got in the heavens a nymph more lovely and beautiful</span> than himself and he thus became very much attached and devoted her. He began to describe his own heroic qualities and also to copy dotedly the qualities of his lover so that she might remain faithfully attached to him.” Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>His fellow warriors enjoyed the virgins but this poor guy couldn’t because his wife immolated herself in his pyre. And took him away forcibly from the celestial nymph (Apsara).</p>
<p>Mahabharata 13.79.27 ”That man who habitually makes gifts of kine comes to be regarded as the foremost of his species. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">When thus proceeding to Heaven, he is received by a thousand celestial damsels of beautiful hips and adorned with handsome robes and ornaments</span>. These girls wait upon him there and minister to his delight. He sleeps there in peace and is awakened by the musical laughter of those gazelle-eyed damsels, the sweet notes of their Vinas, the soft strains of their Vallakis, and the melodious tinkle of their Nupuras. ” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Mahabharata 3.42.23 ”…It is through thy grace, O mountain, that Brahmanas and Kshatriyas and Vaisyas <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">attain heaven, and their anxieties gone, sport with the celestials</span>…” ” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Mahabharata 13.106.53-55 ”’…That man who, unafflicted by disease and free from every malady, observes a fast, verily acquires, at every step the merits that attach to Sacrifices. Such a man ascends to Heaven on a car drawn by swans. Endued with puissance, he enjoys every kind of happiness in heaven for a hundred years. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">A hundred Apsaras of the most beautiful features wait upon and sport with him</span>…” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Padma Purana VII.9.99b-104 ”I shall tell you about the abode of him whose dead body is seen on the sandy bank of Ganga heated by the rays of the sun: with his entire body smeared with divine fragrant substances and sandal <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">he always sports with divine damsels in heaven</span>.” Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Vidyeshwara Samhita 1, 24.66-70 ”He who wears Tripundra raises a thousand predecessors and a thousand successors in his family. In this life he will enjoy all wordly pleasures… He will assume then a divine auspicious body endowed with eight accomplishments. He will travel by a divine aerial chariot attended by celestial gods… <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">finally reach Brahma’s region where he will sport with a hundred virgins</span>.” Tr.

<p>Skanda Purana V.iii.198.115-117 ”The man who has become pure (by taking bath) and who has observed fast shall keep awake in the night on the fourteenth lunar day in the dark half.

<p>Brahma Purana 65.4-5 ”Brahma said:- O sages, listen all of you, even as I speak about that highest region which is wished for by the devotees. It is blessed, holy land and destructive of the world. It is most excellent of all the worlds. it is named (Visnu-loka) after the name of Visnu. It is a sacred abode full of mysteries. It is honoured and worshipped by the three worlds.[18-29] In that city of Visnu, worshipped by all, people walk about in divine aerial chariots…<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">They are adorned by the celestial maidens</span>…<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The people sport about with the various young women of Gandharvas</span> and the group of celestial clans. The young women look very splendid with their faces as charming as the moon. Their breasts are plump and lifted up. Their waists are beautiful and elegant. Some are dark in complexion and some fair. Their gait is like that of elephants in their rut…As long as the heaven stands alongwith the moon and stars, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">they dally with the celestial nymphs</span>.

<p>Swami Prabhupada wrote</p>
<p>“People in general are not very intelligent, and due to their ignorance they are most attached to the fruitive activities recommended in the karma-kāṇḍa portions of the Vedas. They do not want anything more than sense gratificatory proposals for enjoying life in heaven, where wine and women are available and material opulence is very common…They are generally sensual, and they do not want anything other than the heavenly pleasures of life. It is understood that there are gardens called nandana-kānana in which there is good opportunity for association with angelic, beautiful women and having a profuse supply of somarasa wine. Such bodily happiness is certainly sensual; therefore there are those who are purely attached to material, temporary happiness, as lords of the material world.” <strong>Swami Prabhupada on Gita 2.42-43</strong><br />
vanisource.org/wiki/BG_2.42-43_(1972)</p>
<p><strong>Who are the Apsaras (Nymphs/Heavenly Virgins)?</strong></p>
<p>Srimad Devi Bhagavatam 9.1.96-143 ”…those that are sprung from Tamo Guna are recognised as worst and belonging to the unknown families. They are very scurrilous, cheats, ruining their families, fond of their own free ways, quarrelsome and no seconds are found equal to them. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Such women become prostitutes in this world and Apsaras in the Heavens</span>…” Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>In other words, Ishwar provides the Dvijas (Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaisyas) with numerous prostitutes in heaven. Especially for those who are slain on the battlefield. After reading these verses will Hindu fanatics post these verses on their social media accounts?</p>

<h2><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Gods and Rishis Lusting after Women</span></h2>
<p>Gods and Rishis lusted after women. They were aroused by seeing young girls even in their old stricken age. How can I forget to mention Indra in this list after all he frequently lusted after others&#8217; wives, I am not saying this but a Sage himself had said it,</p>
<p><strong>INDRA</strong></p>
<p>Mahabharata 13.40.13-18 ”…The Creator himself is incapable of restraining them within the limits that are proper: what need then be said of men? This, O chief of men, I heard in former days, viz., how Vipula had succeeded in protecting his preceptor’s spouse in ancient times. <span style="color: #ff0000;">There was in days of yore a highly blessed Rishi of the name of Devasarman of great celebrity. He had a wife, Ruchi </span>by name, who was unequalled on earth for beauty. Her loveliness intoxicated every beholder among the deities and Gandharvas and Danavas. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The chastiser of Paka, viz., Indra, the slayer of Vritra, O monarch, was in particular enamoured of her and coveted her person</span>. The great ascetic Devasarman was fully cognisant of the disposition of women. He, therefore, to the best of his power and energy, protected her (from every kind of evil influence). <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The Rishi knew that Indra was restrained by no scruples in the matter of seeking the companionship of other people’s wives. It was for this reason that he used to protect his spouse, putting forth all his power</span>…” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>So now I am free from all the allegations that I am using bad words against Indra, as the Rishi himself has described the truth about Indra.</p>
<p>Indra in old age had lusted after another lady named Sukala and tried to make sexual advances to her, but she in anger insulted him,</p>
<p>Padma Purana II.58.25-28a ”Sukala said:- Well being to you. I am protected by the magnanimous sons of my husband, and by companions; so I am not at all alone. From whom (then) do I have fear? I am protected by brave men everywhere. I do not have much time to talk. I am engaged in my duty towards him. O you very intelligent one, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">why do you not feel ashamed of dallying with me while your eyes are trickling (i.e. while you are old)</span>. Who are you that you have come here, and are not afraid even of death?” Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p>Indra addressed Ahalya the wife of Sage Gautama in the following way,</p>
<p>Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Krishna Janma Khanda 61.22-41 ”…What an indescribable asceticism the great devotee Gautama had practiced by virtue of which he luckily secured the possession of a very beautiful wife! By the worship of the eternal goddess of Nature, (Parvati) who is the emblem of the spell of Visnu and by the adoration of Kamala, he was undoubtedly secured a wife like Kamala having looks of a lotus, who is a woman of the first four classes (Padmini), of slender waist, huge buttocks, hard breast; of the colour of heated gold, of fine teeth and soft and pure complexion, the touch of whose body is agreeably warm in winter and delightfully cool in summer. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Fair one, Cupid versed in sexual science or the lustful moon-god alone knows how to cohabit with a damsel like you</span>. How can Gautama resourceful only in meditations know that? <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">In sexual science I am a past-master, and on this score I am always eulogised by the above named clever individuals and by the celestial whores Urvasi</span> etc. O nymph possessing an excellent face, I shall make Sachi your maid-servant…” Tr. Rajendra Nath Sen</p>
<p><strong>VISHNU</strong></p>
<p>Narada Purana, Uttarabhaga 28.35-37 “Visnu whom people meditate upon and truly remember, who is called Yogamurti (Embodiment of Yoga) and who is eternal, was enamoured of courtesans…” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p><strong>SHIVA</strong></p>
<p>Shiva shamelessly went to the pine forest and seduced the wives of sages, He went to the pine forest in Bhikshatana form, readers can Google the image of Bhikshatana which is fully nude with a snake tied around his waist,</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Kotirudra Samhita 4.12.8-13 ”Once the leading Brahmin devotees of Siva engrossed in the meditation of Siva went into the forest for bringing sacrificial twigs. In the meantime Siva himself assuming a very hideous form came there in order to test their devotion. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">He was very brilliant but stark naked</span>. He had smeared ashes all over his body as the sole ornament. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Standing there and holding his penis he began to show all sorts of vicious tricks</span>. It was with a mind to do something pleasing to the forest-dwellers that Siva, favourite of the devotees, came to the forest at his will. The wives of the sages were extremely frightened at this sight. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The other women excited and surprised approached the lord</span>. Some embraced him. Others held his hands. The women were engrossed in struggling with one another. ” Tr. Board of Scholars, Edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Skanda Purana V.iii.38.23-38 ”…One lady who was over proud of her beauty and youthful form forgot to breast-feed her son lying on her lap. On seeing Mahadeva, another lady became struck by the arrows of Kama. She pressed down her protruding breasts with her arms…” Tr. Ganesh Vasudeo Tagare</p>
<p>Previous verses of Shiva Purana tell us that Shiva went there to test them. As far as my opinion on this issue is concerned, Shiva actually wanted to enjoy sages’ wives on the pretext of the test, just like Krishna stole the clothes of Gopis to watch them naked and later gave a lame reason for this. In the Skanda Purana I.i.34.116-129, Parvati the wife of Shiva says that Shiva went to Daruvanam forest nude only to seduce women of sages on the pretext of begging alms, Parvati had denuded Shiva in front of gods and their servants after Shiva lost the bet in the game of dice,</p>
<p>Skanda Purana, Part 1, Mahesvarakhanda book 1, Kedarkhanda section 1, chapter 34, verses 11-129 “After saying thus, Parvati, the goddess, beloved of Sankara, became furious. She held Sankara by the hand. The lady of slender limbs took away the serpent Vasuki from his neck. Similarly she removed many other ornaments also. The infuriated lady hurriedly took away the ornaments of Sambhu. His crescent moon and his excellent elephant hide removed. The serpents Kambala and Asvatara tha thad been worn by Mahesa as ornaments were removed by the great goddess laughingly with tricky words. Even his loincloth was taken away laughingly with the utterance of tricky words. At that time the Ganas and the friends (of Parvati) felt embarrassed and ashamed. (The friends and others) turned their faces away. Bhrngi of great oenance, Candi, Munda, Mahaloman, Mahodara and many other Ganas became miserable. On seeing them in that plight, Mahesa became ashamed. Sankara who became angry spoke these words to Parvati: ‘All these sages are laughing satirically. Similarly Brahma, Visnu and these Devas, Indra and others all of them laughing (at me)…On being told thus by Sambhu, the Yogin, Parvati, the chaste lady of charming face, laughed and spoke these words: ‘<span style="text-decoration: underline;">What have you to do with a loincloth</span>? You are a sage of sanctified soul. (Some time back) <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">you wandered through Daruvana with the cardinal points alone for your garment (i.e. you were naked). Under the pretext of begging for alms, the wives of the sages were enchanted</span>. While you were going, you were greatly adored by them. Your loincloth fell down (penis?) there…” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>It is proved that the purpose of Shiva going to the pine forest in a nude state was only to enjoy sages’ wives. For the sake of the argument let’s accept that Shiva’s motive was really to test them. My question is, Is it befitting for a god to hold his erected penis in hand and appear fully naked before chaste women? Imagine someone doing this to your mother, sister, or daughter, you will start beating the guy and this is what the Rishis did, yes you read it right. Shiva was beaten up severely by the Rishis and even his penis was cut off,</p>
<p>Kurma Purana II.38.52 ”The sages said: A certain highly brilliant person has entered the holy Daruvana along with his wife, who was very beautiful in all her limbs. But he was naked. The lordly person fascinated our entire women and daughters, with his charming personality. While his beloved defiled our sons. We heaped various imprecations and curses on him but they were defied and set at nought. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">He was beaten soundly by us</span>. His Linga was struck down.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>This story of Shiva being beaten up is supported by Brahmanda Purana,</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana I.2.27.45 ”<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">He [Shiva] was scolded and beaten</span>. His Linga (?penis) was taken out. It is to alleviate his anger that we have sought refuge in you.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>For a brief explanation of this Linga story read the article <a href="/index.php/2014/05/15/analysis-of-lingam/" data-wpel-link="internal">What</a> is Shivling? Shiva surely deserved to be beaten up for doing this vulgar act. But this wasn’t the full stop of his shameless act, he did this again and was again beaten up,</p>
<p>Skanda Purana V.i.26.71-72”After the Manvantara came to a close and Vaivasvata Manvantara arrived again, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Mahesvara entered the sacrificial hall of Brahma with the same guise of and insance person with erected penis</span>. [75-77b] Other asked him whether it was one of his Vratas and if so by whom was it demonstrated. They continued: ”<span style="color: #ff0000;">There are women here</span>. How is it that this has been committed by you…You are worthy of being killed by us today.” <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">On being hit and hurt by the Brahmanas</span>, thus, Sankara, the great holy Lord, smiled and told all those Brahmanas: ”Why do you hit me-a lunatic who has lost his senses? Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>What else can be said about such a person? I don’t have any words to describe such a shameless deed.</p>
<p><strong>VISHWAKARMA</strong></p>
<p>Vishwakarma was enamored of an Apsara named Ghirtachi who was going for pilgrimage. He invited her for having sex, but she refused. He even tried to rape her, but she resisted the rape just by warning him about the consequences.</p>
<p>Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Brahma Khanda, 10.24-31 Sauti answered, ‘O best of saints, once upon a time the celestial nymph Ghritachi, being extremely excited with passion put on a lovely dress and proceeded in the direction of Puskara for pilgrimage iin the mean time, Viswakarma cheefully arrived there from the solar region and suddenly observed the sportive damsel. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">As soon as he saw her, he was pierced with the darts of Cupid</span>. Having lost all control over his will he demanded carnal intercourse from that nymph…” Tr. Rajendra Nath Sen</p>
<p><strong>ASHWINS</strong></p>
<p>Ashwins lusted after the wife of old Rishi Chyavana named Sukanya. They tried to seduce her but all in vain so at last, they gave her an offer that they will rejuvenate her old husband and in return, she will have to marry one of them. After consulting with her husband she agreed. So Ashwins told Chyavan to enter the water so he entered the water. Ashwins were playing tricks here and they too entered the water and when three of them (two Ashwin brothers and Chyavana) came out of the water all of them had the same appearance. Rishi Chyvana was rejuvenated. Ashwins made the same appearance in order to disflower Sukanya. This story of Rishi Chyavana been rejuvenated is also mentioned in Rig Veda, Nirukta, several Puranas, and Pancavimsa Brahmana.</p>
<p>Mahabharata 3.123.1-9 “Lomasa said, ‘Once on a time, O king, those celestials, namely the twin Aswins, happened to behold Sukanya, when she had (just) bathed, and when her person was bare. And seeing that one of excellent limbs, and like unto the daughter of the lord of celestials, the nose-born Aswins neared her, and addressed her, saying, ‘O thou of shapely thighs, whose daughter art thou? And what doest thou in this wood? O auspicious one, O thou of excellent grace, we desire to know this, do thou therefore tell us.’ Thereupon she replied bashfully unto those foremost of celestials. ‘Know me as Sarayati’s daughter, and Chyavana’s wife…O thou of luminous smiles? O divinely beautiful damsel, do thou, forsaking Chyavana accept one of us for husband. It behoveth thee not to spend thy youth fruitlessly…” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p><strong>SEVERAL GODS LUSTING AFTER URJA THE DAUGHTER OF MOON GOD</strong></p>
<p>Brahma Purana 110.13-15 ”When the holy god Moon did not see his daughter Urja, he was upset. Where she may have gone? He thought to himself. The Soma came to know the facts. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">He knew that manes were after her, that they were sexually inclined to her </span>and had accepted by the virtue of their penance. The moon was overcome with anger.” Tr. Board of Scholars, Edited by J.L. Shastri’</p>
<p><strong>RISHIS</strong></p>
<p>A sage named Chyavana was attracted to a Princess named Sukanya,</p>
<p>Mahabharata 3.122.1-11 “Lomasa said, ‘A son was born to the great saint Bhrigu, Chyavana by name…Now after the lapse of a long space of time, that ruler of earth, Saryati by name, for amusement visited this pleasant and excellent lake. With him were four thousand females, espoused by him, O son of Bharata’s race! <span style="text-decoration: underline;">there was also his only daughter endued with beautiful brows, named Sukanya</span>. She surrounded by her maids, and decked out with jewels fit for the celestials, while walking about, approached the anthill where Bhrigu’s son was seated. And surrounded by her maids, she began to amuse herself there, viewing the beautiful scenery, and looking at the lofty trees of the wood. And she was handsome and in the prime of her youth; and she was amorous and bent on frolicking. And she began to break the twigs of the forest trees bearing blossoms. And Bhrigu’s son endued with intelligence beheld her wandering like lightning, without her maids, and wearing a single piece of cloth and decked with ornaments. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">And seeing her in the lone forest, that ascetic of exceeding effulgence was inspired with desire</span>. And that regenerate Rishi possessing ascetic energy, who had a low voice, called the auspicious one,–but she heard him not.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>This is also mentioned in Srimad Bhagavatam 9.3. The Princess named Sukanya accidentally harmed Rishi Chyavana who had assumed the form of an earth worm. He was going to curse her, but then the king who was the father of Sukanya urged Chyavana not to curse his daughter then Chyavana agreed on one condition that he should give his daughter to him in marriage as he was sexually aroused seeing her.</p>
<p>There is a story of another sage named Pippalada who was very old and had also threatened to curse the king if he doesn’t give his daughter to him, unlike Chyavana he wasn’t harmed at all by the Princess. He became lustful after seeing the beautiful daughter of the king even in his old stricken age,</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Satarudra Samhita 3.25.2-14 ”Once while going to the river Pushpabhadra for his ablution, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">the great sage saw the beautiful youthful maiden Padma, a part of Siva herself. Desirious of getting her</span>, the sage traversing the world and an expert in following the established conventions went to the abode of king Anaranya, her father…<span style="color: #ff0000;">The sage repeated the request, saying ”Give me your daughter devoutly. </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Otherwise I will reduce everything to ashes along with you</span>.”…Then the king was much frightened and he lamented again and again. <span style="color: #ff0000;">He gave his daughter Padma, fully bedecked in ornaments to the old sage</span>. After marrying her Padma, the daughter of the king and part of Siva, the sage Pippalada joyously took her to his hermitage… <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Then the excellent sage Pippalada, a part of Siva, became a young man by means of his divine sport and sported with that young lady</span>. Ten noble sons, all of them great sons, were born to the sage.” Tr. Board of Scholars, Edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Another Sage named Suci was attracted to the wife of a Rakshasa,</p>
<p>Skanda Purana III.i.11.44-56 ”There was a sage named Suci in that forest. He was engaged in penance and meditation. He was devoted to the study of the Vedas. That lady of excellent complexion went to his hermitage. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">On seeing her the sage became afflicted with erotic passion and he lost all his steadiness and composure</span>. Approaching the beautiful lady, the excellent sage spoke thus: Suci said:- O young lady, welcome to you. O lady of bright smiles, whose wife are you? What is the task for which you have come to this extremely dreadful forest? You are excessively tired. Stay within this hut of mine. On being told thus, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">that lady of beautiful buttocks</span> replied to the sage: ”O sage, I am the wife of a Raksasa named Trivakra. I am Susila by name. I have come to this forest with a desire to gather some flowers. I have no son, O sage. My husband eagerly wishers for a son and hence I have been urged by him, ‘Propititate sage Suci and get a son from him.’ On being directed by my husband thus, I have approached you. Beget a son of me, O sage. Take pity on me.” On being told thus sage Suci spoke to her thus: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">O Susila, I am highly delighted now on seeing you</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fulfil the ocean of the wishes of mine</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">After saying thus the sage sported with her for three days</span>. Then the delighted sage said to Susila of beautiful features: ”<span style="color: #ff0000;">You will have in your womb a very powerful son</span> named Kapalabharana.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>A sage Vedasiras ejaculated seeing an Apsara Suci, not to confuse this Suci as Sage Suci,</p>
<p>Skanda Purana IV.ii.59.19-21 “Formerly there was a sage of great penance named Vedasiras, born in the family of Bhrgu. It was as though he was another embodied form of the Vedas. While that sage was performing the penance, Suci, the most excellent one of the celestial damsels, endowed with beauty and well-shaped limbs came into his view. Merely at her sight the mind of the sage became extremely agitated. He had an emission of semen immediately. The excellent celestial damsel became frightened.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>The sage said that semen should not go waste hence she must swallow it. So she swallowed the semen and became pregnant with a baby girl and the sage named her Dhutapapa.</p>
<p>Leave aside those Rishis getting aroused on seeing beautiful girls, an old sage named Saubhari was aroused just by seeing the sexual intercourse of fishes,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 9.6.39-43 ”Saubhari Ṛṣi was engaged in austerity, deep in the water of the river Yamuna, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">when he saw a pair of fish engaged in sexual affairs. Thus he perceived the pleasure of sex life</span>, and induced by this desire he went to King Mandhata and begged for one of the King’s daughters. In response to this request, the King said, “O brahmaṇa, any of my daughters may accept any husband according to her personal selection.” Saubhari Muni thought: <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">I am now feeble because of old age</span>. My hair has become grey, my skin is slack, and my head always trembles. Besides, I am a yogi. Therefore women do not like me. Since the King has thus rejected me, I shall reform my body in such a way as to be desirable even to celestial women, what to speak of the daughters of worldly kings. Thereafter, when Saubhari Muni became quite a young and beautiful person, the messenger of the palace took him inside the residential quarters of the princesses, which were extremely opulent. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">All fifty princesses then accepted him as their husband, although he was only one man</span>.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>When the Sages possessing mystic powers can do these things then why can’t a normal Brahmin do the same?</p>
<p>Brahma Purana 120.120-122. ”The Siddha roamed over the earth as he pleased. The excellent lady Urvasi went to Varanasi and took her bath in the waters of Matsyodari assuming her divine form. This foolish Brahman too had gone to the river Matsyodari. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">On seeing Urvasi bathing there he was overwhelmed by passionate love that agitated him too much</span>.” Tr. Board of Scholars, Edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>An old-aged Brahmin was so aroused that he ordered his sons to get a woman to satisfy him,</p>
<p>Padma Purana II.1.28-30 ”Having ordered the glorious one, devoted to this father, the brahmana (i.e. Sivasarman), thinking of the second son, called (him viz.) Vedasarman (and said to him): <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">”Go by my order; being stuperfied by passion of love (i.e. sex) I cannot stand without a woman (by my side).</span>” He presented, by means of his magical power, a woman full of all charm (before Vedasarman). (He told him:0 ”O boy, determined for me, bring this woman to me.” Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p>A sage named Ruru also lusted after a youthful girl,</p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 2.8.24-49 ”…the chief <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Apsara Menaka held sexual intercourse with Visvavasu Gandharva</span> on the banks of a river and became pregnant. She went out from that place to the hermitage of Sthulakes’a on the river bank and gave birth to a very beautiful daughter. Seeing this girl quite an orphan and very beautiful, the Muni Sthulakes’a began to rear up her and named her Pramadvara. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">This all-auspicious girl Pramadvara attained youth in due course when the Muni Ruru saw her and became smitten with passion</span>.” Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>

<h2><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Bizarre Birth</span></h2>
<p>The prime minister of India Narender Modi said that there must have been some plastic surgeon who fixed the head of an elephant to Ganesha and started the practice of plastic surgery. Well, there were many more ‘Scientific’ techniques used by Hindu gods and sages to procreate children. We only know about test-tube babies and surrogate babies, but there were many kinds of babies especially pot babies in ancient India.</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 3.20.23 ”<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Lord Brahmā then gave birth to the demons from his buttocks</span>, and they were very fond of sex. Because they were too lustful, they approached him for copulation.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Forget buttocks, babies can be born from male organs too,</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Rudra Samhita 2, Yudha Khanda 5, Ch 14.1”It is by repeating this mantra that Sukra came out of the belly of <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Siva through the penis</span>, like the powerful semen.” Tr. Board of Scholars, Edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana I.2.8.25 Since the lord [Brahma] created the Asuras at night from his loins through the vital breaths, and as they were born during the night, they are invincible during the night.</p>
<p>Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Brahma Khanda 5.56-66 ”…<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Thereafter, from the private parts of Krisna, a mighty being</span> of tawny colour with his companions came out and inasmuch as they emanated from his private parts they are known by the name of Guhyas, but the best and the mightiest of them is called Kuvera…” Tr. Rajendra Nath Sen</p>
<p>Drinking semen can also lead to pregnancy,</p>
<p>Mahabharata 1.3 ”…The Rishi thus addressed, answered Janamejaya, ‘O Janamejaya, this my son, deep in ascetic devotions, accomplished in the study of the Vedas, and endued with the full force of my asceticism, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">is born of (the womb of) a she-snake that had drunk my vital fluid</span>…” Tr.

<p>Varaha Purana 95.20-21 ”Finding the water fragrant (with it), Mahismati told her friends that she would drink it. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">She then drank the water containing the emission of the sage. As a result she conceived</span> and in due time brought forth, a son named Mahisa, intelligent and valiant.” Tr. Venkitaasubramonia Iyer, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Skanda Purana III.iii.19.64 The semen virile of the royal sage Yupaketu fell into water. It is said that a harlot drank that water together with the semen and became pregnant” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Skanda Purana V.iii.5.27-37 ”…O excellent king, Paramesthin Rudra sported about with Uma in the vast expanse of sea-like water. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">A splendid girl was born out of the sweat of Uma due</span> to her delight. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">When Sarva’s chest pressed against the breasts of Uma, a great girl of lotus-like eyes issued forth from the sweat</span>…” Tr.

<p>Vishnu Purana 4.2.13-17 “Yuvanaswa had no son, at which he was deeply grieved. Whilst residing in the vicinage of the holy Munis, he inspired them with pity for his childless condition, and they instituted a religious rite to procure him progeny. One night during its performance the sages having placed a vessel of consecrated water upon the altar had retired to repose. It was past midnight, when the king awoke, exceedingly thirsty; and unwilling to disturb any of the holy inmates of the dwelling, he looked about for something to drink. In his search he came to the water in the jar, which had been sanctified and endowed with prolific efficacy by sacred texts, and he drank it. When the Munis rose, and found that the water had been drunk, they inquired who had taken it, and said, “The queen that has drunk this water shall give birth to a mighty and valiant son.” “It was I,” exclaimed the Raja, “who unwittingly drank the water!” <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">and accordingly in the belly of Yuvanaswa was </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">conceived a child, and it grew, and in due time it ripped open the right side of the Raja, and was born</span>, and the Raja, did not die…” Tr.

<h2><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Gods and Rishis Ejaculating</span></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1557" height="1713" class="wp-image-8859 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Kama-Baba-Rishis-ejaculated.jpeg" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Kama-Baba-Rishis-ejaculated.jpeg 1557w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Kama-Baba-Rishis-ejaculated-273x300.jpeg 273w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Kama-Baba-Rishis-ejaculated-768x845.jpeg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Kama-Baba-Rishis-ejaculated-1396x1536.jpeg 1396w" sizes="(max-width: 1557px) 100vw, 1557px" /></p>
<p>We hear from Hindus about how pious Rishis were, that they practiced celibacy and didn’t even marry. This is not true, Gods had many wives and almost all Rishis were married and had children. Leave aside marriage, Rishis even in their old stricken age were so sexually aroused that just a sight of a beautiful girl resulted in emission of semen. Some of the Sages include seven main Rishis like Bhardvaja, Kratu, Vasista, Gautama, etc. I will start by mentioning stories of Gods and later of Rishis,</p>
<p><strong>SHIVA</strong></p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 8.12.32-33 “Just as a maddened bull elephant follows a female elephant who is able to conceive pregnancy, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Lord Siva followed the beautiful woman and discharged semen</span>, even though his discharge of semen never goes in vain. O King, where so ever on the surface of the globe <span style="color: #ff0000;">fell the semen of the great personality of Lord Siva, mines of gold and silver later appeared</span>.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Shiva is considered the ascetic god, I wonder what kind of asceticism is this? Due to this emission of Shiva’s semen, the monkey god Hanuman was also born which is explained in Adultery Section. Shiva was so maddened about Mohini that he followed her in a fully nude state and even ejaculated. It is said that this happened before Parvati the wife of Shiva and her head was lowered in shame because her husband was lusting after another woman in her presence. This chapter of Srimad Bhagavatam is briefly explained in the LGBT Section.</p>
<p><strong>BRAHMA</strong></p>
<p>Brahma ejaculated seeing the face of Shiva’s wife,</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Rudra Samhita 2, Sati Khanda 2, chapter 19, verses 26-28 ”Then, O sage, afflicted by the cupid and delighted in the heart of hearts, I [Brahma] lifted her veil and stared into the face of Sati. I looked at the face of Sati many a time. I was helpless in curbing the onset of a sensuous organism. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Four drops of my semen virile got displaced and fell on the ground</span> like drops of dew as a result of staring into her face.”, Tr. Board of Scholars, Edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>This story is also supported by Brahma Purana Gautami-Mahatmya 3.15. As we all know Brahma was an old man, he is sometimes considered the grandfather. But this grandfather couldn’t even resist his lust for his granddaughter. He discharged semen after seeing the face of Sati the wife of Shiva. Shiva came to know about this and he was so agitated that he was about to kill Brahma. But Brahma later repented and begged for forgiveness. Then Shiva forgave Brahma. Isn’t it ironic that Shiva became angry just because Brahma ejaculated on seeing his wife but Shiva had no problem at all commanding Vishnu to rape the chaste lady named Vrinda (Tulsi)? As we have already read that even Shiva ejaculated on seeing Mohini (Vishnu), Shiva even tried to seduce sages’ wives after appearing naked, and as per Mahabharata, he had sex with wives and daughters of Rishis in the Daruvanam forest. When Shiva can do all these shameless things then why get angry when someone else does the same thing with your wife? Hindu gods did the same act, again and again, they did not consider it to be wrong. Brahma is said to have ejaculated on seeing the wives of gods, Apsaras, and other women,</p>
<p>Vayu Purana, Part 2, 4.29-31 ”The brilliantly shining goddess Earth, the quarters, the intermediate quarters, the Lords of quarters, the celestial virgins, the wives of Devas, the mothers and Ayu all these were present there in embodied form in front of the Lord (Brahma) who was performing the Yajna assuming the form of Varuna. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">On seeing the ladies, the semen virile of Svayambhu fell</span> on the ground…” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Brahma Khanda 11-20 ”This Khma who wields the following arrows, namely, killing. stupifying, soporific, emaciating and maddening, experimentally discharged the arrrows on all and, at the desire of the Supreme Being every one was excited with lust. To crown all, the great anchorite, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Brahma looked with wistful eyes at Rati and immediately his semen was discharged</span>…” Tr. Rajendra Nath Sen</p>
<p>Brahma is said to have ejaculated seeing Amogha the wife of sage Santanu,</p>
<p>Padma Purana Section 1 Sṛṣṭi-khaṇḍa, Chapter 55, verses 16b-18a. “<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The grandsire of all the worlds, after seeing Amoghā, ejaculated</span>. From that is said to be the rise of Lauhitya. It purifies all people. It is full of all sacred places; resorting to which a man goes to the healthy world of Brahmā.” Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p>This story is further elaborated in the Niyoga section. Brahma had again ejaculated on seeing a nymph,</p>
<p>Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Krishna Janma Khanda 131.2-10 Subsequently at that place nymphs who had sprung out of the body of Visnu and who were the digits of Visnu began to dance and chant Visnu’s hymns in a melodious tone. <span style="color: #ff0000;">The paternal grandfather Brahma, observing their hard buttocks, thick spherical breasts</span> and smiling lotus faces, was excited with passion. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">He could not control his heart; his semen was discharged</span>; and out of shame he concealed it on the ground with his cloth. O Saunaka, after the music was over, he threw the semen along with the cloth rendered hot by lust into the sea of milk.” Tr. Rajendra Nath Sen</p>
<p>Is it befitting for gods to watch semi-naked and full-naked girls dancing? This gathering was also attended by Agni and he is also said to have discharged his semen and tried to hide it similarly.</p>
<p><strong>AGNI</strong></p>
<p>Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Krishna Janma Khanda 131.34-38 Once upon a time, all the gods having assembled in the council of the gods, the celestial whores busied themselves with dancing and singing. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">On that occasion, the fire-god (having seen Rambha with graceful buttocks), was excited with passion and discharged his semen</span>…” Tr. Rajendra Nath Sen</p>
<p>Rambha was an Apsara (Nymph) she was also the concubine of the King of Gods Indra. What can be said about such gods who are so lecherous?</p>
<p><strong>MITRA AND VARUNA</strong></p>
<p>Mitra and Varuna are said to have ejaculated on seeing Apsara Urvashi,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 6.18.6 ”<span style="color: #ff0000;">Upon seeing Urvasi, the celestial society girl, both Mitra and Varuṇa discharged semen</span>, which they preserved in an earthen pot. The two sons Agastya and Vasiṣṭha later appeared from that pot, and they are therefore the common sons of Mitra and Varuṇa. Mitra begot three sons in the womb of his wife, whose name was Revatī. Their names were Utsarga, Ariṣṭa and Pippala.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>This story is also supported by Rig Veda 7.33.1 and Nirukta 5.13. All these gods and Rishis had such a unique technique of begetting sons from a pot. Now it may help Hindu fanatics who say Science in ancient India was at its peak and Ganesha’s head was really fixed by a plastic surgeon, they can claim that pot babies were actually test-tube babies.</p>
<p><strong>RISHIS</strong></p>
<p>When gods can do such acts then why can’t sages do the same? Rishi Bhardvaja is said to have ejaculated on seeing an Apsara (nymph) named Ghritachi, the old Rishi Bhardwaja went to Ganga to perform ablutions, and the nymph Ghritaci too had gone there to perform holy rites which includes dipping into Ganges river, Seeing her wet body and disheveled dress the Rishi was aroused and out of desire his semen came out,</p>
<p>Mahabharata 1.131.1-9 “Vaisampayana said, ‘There dwelt at the source of the Ganga, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">a great sage named Bharadwaja</span>, ceaselessly observing the most rigid vows. One day, of old, intending to celebrate the Agnihotra sacrifice he went along with many great Rishis to the Ganga to perform his ablutions. Arrived at the bank of the stream, he saw Ghritachi herself, that Apsara endued with youth and beauty, who had gone there a little before. With an expression of pride in her countenance, mixed with a voluptuous languor of attitude, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the damsel rose from the water after her ablutions were over. And as she was gently treading on the bank,</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">her attire which was loose became disordered. Seeing her attire disordered, the sage was smitten with burning desire. The next moment his vital fluid came out</span>, in consequence of the violence of his emotion. The Rishi immediately held it in a vessel called a Drona. Then, O king, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Drona sprang from the fluid thus preserved in that vessel by the wise Bharadwaja</span>. And the child thus born studied all the Vedas and their branches.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>This story is also mentioned in Mahabharata 1.168. Another Rishi named Vyasa had ejaculated on seeing Ghritachi but this didn’t occur at the Ganges river,</p>
<p>Srimad Devi Bhagavatam 1.14.1-70 ”…<span style="color: #ff0000;">The Muni Vyasa </span>Deva tried his best and exerted his power of patience to its utmost, <span style="color: #ff0000;">but failed to control his restless mind to enjoy the woman</span>. Though he was very energetic, and he tried repeatedly to control his heart, <span style="color: #ff0000;">enchanted with the beautiful form of Ghritachi</span>, yet he could not, as due to a state of things pre-ordained by God, control his mind. At this state, when he was rubbing the fire sticks to get the sacred fire, the two pieces of wood used in kindling the fire, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">his seed (semen) fell upon the Arani</span> (the two pieces of wood used in kindling the sacred fire). But he did not take any notice of that, and he went on rubbing the firesticks when arose from that Arana the wonderfully beautiful form of S’uka deva<span style="color: #ff0000;">, looking like a second Vyasa. This boy, born of Arana fuel</span>, looked there brilliant like the blazing fire of the sacrificial place, whereon oblations of ghee are poured… ” Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>This story is also mentioned in Narada Purana II.58.19-27 and Mahabharata 12.325. A Rishi named Vibhandaka had also discharged his semen when he spotted a beautiful woman near a lake,</p>
<p>Mahabharata 3.110.34-35 ”And that son of Kasyapa, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Vibhandaka, having proceeded to a big lake</span>, devoted himself to the practice of penances. And that same saint, comparable to a god, laboured for a long period. And once while he was washing his mouth in the waters, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">he beheld the celestial nymph Urvasi–whereupon came out his seminal fluid</span>.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>There is a story of another sage named Mankana who was the son of Kashyap, He ejaculated seeing Apsara Rambha while both were taking bath,</p>
<p>Vamana Purana, Satomahatmya 17.2-5 “Lomaharsana said The sage Mankana was the mind-born son of Kasyapa. He was ready to bathe with his valkala in his hand. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">There came Rambha taking good, bright and charming other Apsarases and began to take their bath by his side. At this due to excitement of passion his semen dropped in the water</span>. The great sage collected that semen in a jar. That semen in the jar became differentiated into seven portions. Out of them were born seven Rsis who are known as the Marut hosts.” Tr. Anand Swarup Gupta</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">A Rishi named Vibhandaka had also discharged his semen when he spotted a beautiful woman near a lake,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Mahabharata 3.110.34-35 “And that son of Kasyapa, Vibhandaka, having proceeded to a big lake, devoted himself to the practice of penances. And that same saint, comparable to a god, laboured for a long period. And once while he was washing his mouth in the waters, </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000; font-size: 12pt;">he beheld the celestial nymph Urvasi–whereupon came out his seminal fluid</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</span></p>
<p>This proves that women who go to Banaras (Vanarasi) for pilgrimage are not safe from the lustful Hindu priests. The Hindu priests would have no problem watching lustfully the wet bodies of women as they are aware of what their greatest Rishis did. There is another version of this story mentioned in Mahabharata,</p>
<p>Mahabharata 9.38 “Listen now to a great feat of Mankanaka, who had from his youth led the life of a brahmacari. While employed in performing his ablutions in the river, <span style="color: #ff0000;">he beheld </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">(one day), O Bharata, a woman of faultless limbs</span> and fair brows, bathing in the river at will, her person uncovered. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">At this sight, O monarch, the vital seed of the Rishi fell unto the Sarasvati</span>. The great ascetic took it up and placed it within his earthen pot. Kept within that vessel, the fluid became divided into seven parts. From those seven portions were born seven Rishis from whom sprang the (nine and forty) Maruts.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Just like Rishi Mankanaka another Rishi named Dadhica had emitted his semen into the river Sarasvati after seeing Apsara Alambusa,</p>
<p>Mahabharata 9.51.5-9 “In days of yore, O monarch, there was an intelligent sage of great ascetic merit. He was celebrated by the name of Dadhica. Possessing a complete control over his senses, he led the life of a brahmacari…At last the chastiser of Paka, for tempting the sage, despatched unto him the exceedingly beautiful and celestial apsara, by name Alambusa. Thither where on the banks of the Sarasvati the high souled sage was engaged in the act of gratifying the gods, the celestial damsel named above, O monarch, made her appearance. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Beholding that damsel of beautiful limbs, the vital seed of that ascetic of cleansed soul came out</span>.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>There is a story mentioned about a father and his son who were archers, they were descendants of Rishi,</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 50.10 “<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">At the sight of a nymph, Satyadhriti cast his seed </span>in a pool of water, out of which, one son and a daughter were born.” Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, Edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>Like Father like Son,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 9.21.35 “The son of Satananda was Satyadhṛti, who was expert in archery, and the <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">son of Satyadhṛti was Saradvan</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">When Saradvan met Urvasi, he discharged semen</span>, which fell on a clump of sara grass. From this semen were born two all-auspicious babies, one male and the other female.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>This is also mentioned in Vayu Purana,</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Vayu Purana 37.196-8 &#8220;&#8230;Ahalya bore Satananda the excellent sage to Saradvata. His son was Satyadhrti of great fame. He was a master of the science of archery. On seeing an Apsaras (celestial damsel) in front, the semen virile of Satyadhrti was emitted in the bush of Sara grass and twins were born.&#8221; G.V Tagare</span></p>
<p>Kratus had also done this act,</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Rudra Samhita 2, Sati Khanda 2, Ch 3, verse 51-55 ”From the drops of sweat that fell from Daksa’s body, a splendid woman endowed with good qualities was born. She was of slender body with symmetrical hips. Her waist was well shaped; small curly hairs embellished it. She was soft in body with fine teeth. She had a shining golden complexion. In her body, she was perfect. Her face shone like the full moon and full blown lotus. Her name was Rati. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">She was capable of captivating even the sages</span>. Excepting Kratu, Vasistha, Pulastya and Angiras the six viz. Marici and others successfully curbed their senses and their activities. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">O excellent sage, the semen virile of the four Kratu and others fell on the ground</span> from which other types of manes were born.” Tr. Board of Scholars, Edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>A sage named Suparsva had emitted his semen after he spotted a Rakshasi girl,</p>
<p>Varaha Purana 95.18-20 ”There a young and beautiful Raksasa girl by name Indumati, bathing naked, was seen by this sage. Then he had an emission which he dropped in a stony crevice at the river (and it got mixed with water).” Tr. Venitasubramonia Iyer, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>A Sudra woman named Kalavati wife of Drumila went to Kashyapa Rishi for contracting Niyoga. But Kashyap Rishi didn’t contract Niyoga with her as he feared that he may lose his status if he engages in sexual intercourse with a Shudra woman. But an Apsara was passing by, seeing the Apsara the Rishi ejaculated,</p>
<p>Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Brahma Kanda 20.33-46 ”…At that time, Menaka was passing by that way, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">At the sight of her thigh and breast the semen of the saint was discharged</span>. Thereupon the woman Kalavati drank it cheerfully, went to her husband, bowed to him and told him everything about, her pregnancy…” Tr. Rajendra Nath Sen</p>
<p>Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Brahma Khanda 20.12-20 ”Santi replied, At Kanauj one Drumila had a barren wife named Kalavati devoted to her husband. She was barren through the faults of her husband. By the command of her husband she once upon a time went to Kasyapa Muni who dwelt in a forest…. [21-32] The Muni addressed her thus ‘Who are you in this solitary forest? Whose wife are you? Why have you come here… ”O best of the twice born aint I he daughter of a cow herd, the wife of Drumila. By the command of my husband. I have come to you as I desire to have a son. Kindly impregnate me. You should not slight a woman who has come to you voluntarily…” Tr. Rajendra Nath Sen</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Rishi Devarata was sitting on the bank of a river in a forest named Kamyaka, seeing naked Apsara Menaka the Rishi ejaculated, </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Skanda Purana VI.29.36-47 &#8220;In the meanwhile, at the advent of spring season, Meanaka, the excellent Apsara (celestial woman), happened to come to the mortal world. In course of her wandering, she reached the excellent forest named Kamyaka&#8230;It was there </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">that the tiger among sages, remembered as Devarata, stayed&#8230;Once he was sitting on the bank of the river. The celestial damsel of excellent complexion was distressed due to the heat of the sun. Even as the sage was watching she disrobed herself revealing her exquisitely divine features and entered the water. On seeing the lady of excellent limbs diving into the water expanse, instantly the leading sage involuntarily discharged his semen. In the meantime an extremely thirsty doe came there. The water of the river with which the semen of the sage had got mixed was completely drunk up by her. By the power of the sage whose semen could never be futile, the doe conceived a human foetus&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Ganesh Vasudeo Tagare</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Devas sending Apsaras to seduce Rishis</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Gods were a</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">lways afraid of sages, that the sages</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> may attain the status of god</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">hood</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> or higher than that through their penances thus few Gods </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">especially Indra </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">sent Apsaras to seduce them and to interrupt their penance. A sage named Kandu was seduced by an Apsara named Pramlocha. And both of them enjoyed each other for hundreds of years, </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Vishnu Purana 1.50.11-15 “…There was formerly (said Soma) a sage named Kandu, eminent in holy wisdom, who practised pious austerities on the lovely borders of the Gomati river. The king of the gods sent the nymph Pramlocha to disturb his penance, and the sweet-smiling damsel diverted the sage from his devotions. They lived together, in the valley of Mandara, </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000; font-size: 12pt;">for a hundred and fifty years; during which, the mind of the Muni was wholly given up to enjoyment</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">…” Tr. H.H. Wilson</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">This is also mentioned in Srimad Bhagavatam 4.30.13.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><br />
A sage named Devadutta was pe</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">r</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">forming penance and Indra feared that the sage may replace h</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">im from his status so to stop the sage’</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">s penance he sent a</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">n Apsara to interrupt the</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> penance,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Varaha Purana 145.29-35 “Hearing that music beautiful with the Pancama svara the mind of the sage became perturbed. Kamadeva tirelessly shot his arrows again on him…Hit by the arrows of Kamadeva, the great sage appraoched her with a smile. She too looked at him amorously but with shyness. Attracting the mind of the sage with her irresistible charms, she continued to play the ball unmindful of flowers falling from her dishevelling hair. At that time the Malaya wind blew off her garment freeing it from its knot and the girdle holding it…[40-1] The he held that smiling damsel by the right hand. He embraced her and gave her delight. Day and night he enjoyed with her every pleasure helped by the power he had acquired by his penence.” Tr. Venkitasubramonia Iyer, edited by J.L. Shastri</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Vishwamitra was performing penance for a very long time, Indra being afraid that Vishwamitra may replace him as the king of god ordered Menaka to seduce Vishwamitra and interrupt his penance, Indra also ordered Maruts (i.e., winds) to help Menaka in the task, Menaka was successful in seducing Vishwamitra and their sexual union gave birth to a </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">daughter named Shakuntala. Shakuntala was abandoned and she was raised by Kanwa hence she came to be regarded as the daughter of Kanwa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Mahabharata, Adi Parva 1, Section 71, verses 20-26 “Viswamitra, of old, having been engaged in the austerest penances alarmed Indra, the chief of the celestials, who thought that the mighty ascetic of blazing energy would, by his penances, hurl him down from his high seat in heaven.&#8217; Indra, thus alarmed, summoned Menaka and told her, &#8216;Thou, O Menaka, art the first of celestial Apsaras. Therefore, O amiable one, do me this service. Hear what I say. This great ascetic Viswamitra like unto the Sun in splendour, is engaged in the most severe of penances. My heart is trembling with fear. Indeed, O slender-waisted Menaka, this is thy business. Thou must see that Viswamitra of soul rapt in contemplation and engaged in the austerest penances, who might hurl me down from my seat. Go and tempt him and frustrating his continued austerities accomplish my good. Win him away from his penances, O beautiful one, by tempting him with thy beauty, youth, agreeableness, arts, smiles and speech.” Tr. Kisari Mohan Ganguli</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Mahabharata, Adi Parva 1, section 72, verses 1-10 “Kanwa continued, &#8216;And Sakra, thus addressed by her, then commanded him who could approach every place (viz., the god of the wind) to be present with Menaka at the time she would be before the Rishi. And the timid and beautiful Menaka then entered the retreat and saw there Viswamitra who had burnt, by his penances, all his sins, and was engaged still in ascetic penances. And saluting the Rishi, she then began to sport before him. And just at that time Marut robbed her of her garments that were white as the Moon. And she thereupon ran, as if in great bashfulness, to catch hold of her attire, and as if she was exceedingly annoyed with Marut. And she did all this before the very eyes of Viswamitra who was endued with energy like that of fire. And Viswamitra saw her in that attitude. And beholding her divested of her robes, he saw that she was of faultless feature. And that best of Munis saw that she was exceedingly handsome, with no marks of age on her person. And beholding her beauty and accomplishments that bull amongst Rishis was possessed with lust and made a sign that he desired her companionship. And he invited her accordingly, and she also of faultless features expressed her acceptance of the invitation. And they then passed a long time there in each other&#8217;s company. And sporting with each other, just as they pleased, for a long time as if it were only a single day, the Rishi begat on Menaka a daughter named Sakuntala. And Menaka (as her conception advanced) went to the banks of the river Malini coursing along a valley of the charming mountains of Himavat. And there she gave birth to that daughter.

<h2><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Adultery/Fornication with Women</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Gods and Rishis had illicit relationship</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">s</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> with several women. Gods and sages had no problem committing adultery with several women, As we read the words of Indra who calls himself ‘Master in Sexual Science’, Shiva and Krishna were also considered ‘Lusty’.

<p><strong>VISHNU</strong></p>
<p>Vishnu as well as his Mohini avatar addresses Brahma in the following way,</p>
<p>Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Krishna Janma Khanda 33.1-11 ”…Then Mohini ridiculed him saying ”O Lord, a being who, allured only by hints from a woman, drags her to his side and enjoys her society is regarded as the best person. Whoever having clearly perceived the intentions of a woman commits sexual intercourse with a woman after he is entreated by her to do so is regarded as the second best. And a wretch who being entreated by a passionate woman fails to commit sexual intercourse with her even in solitude does not deserve to be called a man but a eunuch…” Tr. Rajendra Nath Sen</p>
<p>Brahma Vaivarata Purana, Krishna Janma Khanda, 33.47-63 “Hari smiled when he heard all this and addressed him with words, delightful, substantial, truthful and beneficial to the world thus: “O Brahma, you are conversant with the Vedas. You are chief of the spiritual guides of the learned; and yet you have performed and act which cannot be committed by a murderer. Why did you subdue your passions? Nay, even in India, if a woman excited with passion accidently appears before a man and desires his company, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">the latter, even if dispassionate, should not reject her offer</span>. If he rejects her offer, he is defrauded in several ways in this world and goes to hell in the next world…” Tr. Rajendra Nath Sen</p>
<p>A Hindu Purana proves how lecherous Hindu gods were, not to confuse Srimad Devi Bhagavatam as Srimad Bhagavatam (Bhagavad Purana),</p>
<p>Srimad Devi Bhagavatam 4.13.11-13. “O Giver of honour! When all the Devas, Vas’istha, Vâmadeva, Vis’vamitrâ, Brihaspatî  and other ascetic Munis get themselves overpowered by lust and anger, when their intelligence gets destroyed by covetousness and avarice, when they are addicted to vices and are expert in fraud, pre-text and trickery, then what fate, alas! can you expect of Dharma and what help is there of any religious persons! Alas! lndra, Agni, Moon, and Brahmâ when these get overpowered by the strong influence of lust, are in illicit love with others’ wives, where is the goodness and virtuous behavior in this Trilokî?” Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p><strong>KRISHNA</strong></p>
<p>Hindu apologists are masters of deceit and lies, they invent lies in such a clean manner that it deceives the gullible people. One such deceit is in defending the acts of Krishna. They say Krishna and Gopis were playing together when they were kids and in the play, Krishna and Gopis circumambulated the fire hence those 16008 Gopis accidentally became the wives of Krishna. Another rebuttal made by apologists is that, those 16008 girls belonged to a lower caste and were captured by a demon when Krishna defeated the Demon he married them to uplift their status.</p>
<p>All these explanations are wrong, the second explanation is true to an extent. Krishna did liberate girls from a demon and later married them, but those were only sixteen thousand and one hundred (16,100) girls and were all royal Princesses belonging to the Kshatriya caste.</p>
<p>Linga Purana section 1.69.82 “The excessively strong one, of unequalled exploit, Krsna took up sixteen thousand one hundred girls for his own pleasure.” Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 10.59.33 ”There Lord Kṛṣṇa saw <span style="color: #ff0000;">sixteen thousand </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">royal maidens</span>, whom Bhauma had taken by force from various kings.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 10.59.42 ”Then the imperishable Supreme Personality, assuming a separate form for each bride, duly married all the princesses simultaneously, each in her own palace.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Swami Prabhupada writes,</p>
<p>”<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">There were 16,100 beautiful girls who were daughters of many kings</span> and were forcibly stolen by Bhaumasura, who kept them captive for his carnal desire. These girls prayed piteously to Lord Kṛṣṇa for their deliverance, and the merciful Lord, called by their fervent prayer, released them all by fighting and killing Bhaumāsura. All these captive princesses were then accepted by the Lord as His wives…” A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada on Srimad Bhagavatam 1.10.29 [ <a href="http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_1.10.29" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_1.10.29<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> ]
<p>So those were 16,100 Princess and later Krishna married additional 8 wives on various occasions,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 10.58.55 Lord Devakī-suta, the chief of the Yadus, then took His dowry and Satyā to Dvārakā and continued to live there happily.</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 10.58.56 Bhadrā was a princess of the Kaikeya kingdom and the daughter of Lord Kṛṣṇa’s paternal aunt Śrutakīrti. The Lord married Bhadrā when her brothers, headed by Santardana, offered her to Him.</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 10.58.57 Then the Lord married Lakṣmaṇā, the daughter of the King of Madra. Kṛṣṇa appeared alone at her svayaṁvara ceremony and took her away, just as Garuḍa once stole the demigods’ nectar.</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 10.58.58 Lord Kṛṣṇa also acquired thousands of other wives equal to these when He killed Bhaumāsura and freed the beautiful maidens the demon was holding captive.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 10.58.31 My dear King, Lord Kṛṣṇa forcibly took away Princess Mitravindā, the daughter of His aunt Rājādhidevī, before the eyes of the rival kings. Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 1.10.29 ”The children of these ladies are Pradyumna, Sāmba, Amba, etc. Ladies like Rukmiṇī, Satyabhāmā and Jāmbavatī were forcibly taken away by Him from their svayaṁvara ceremonies after He defeated many powerful kings, headed by Śiśupāla. And other ladies were also forcibly taken away by Him after He killed Bhaumāsura and thousands of his assistants. All of these ladies are glorious.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Srimad Devi Bhagavatam 4.24.41-42 ”Afterwards He [Krishna] brought also Jâmbavatî, Satyabhâmâ, Mitravindâ, Kâlindî, Lak<span style="text-decoration: underline;">s</span>manâ, Bhadrâ, and auspicious Nâgnajitî (the daughter of the king Nagnajit) <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">on various occasions and married them. O Lord of the earth! These eight women were the best and most beautiful of S’rî Krisna’s wives</span>.” Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Krishna married Rukmini after abducting her in a Rakshasa form of marriage which is described in Hindu scriptures as Rukmini herself wanted this to happen and later when Rukmi the brother of Rukmini came to know about it he fought Krishna to get back his sister,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 10.54.32-33 “<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Seeing Lord Kṛṣṇa ready to kill her brother, saintly Rukmiṇī was filled with alarm</span>. She fell at her husband’s feet and piteously spoke as follows. Śrī Rukmiṇī said: O controller of all mystic power, immeasurable one, Lord of lords, master of the universe! O all auspicious and mighty-armed one, please do not kill my brother” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 10.54.35 “Lord Kṛṣṇa tied up the evil-doer with a strip of cloth. He then proceeded to disfigure Rukmī by comically shaving him, leaving parts of his mustache and hair. By that time the Yadu heroes had crushed the extraordinary army of their opponents, just as elephants crush a lotus flower.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 4.24.40 “At the marriage ceremony of S’is’upâla, at the palace of the king of Vidarbha, Janârdan Visnu carried away by force Rukminî, the bride elect from the Svayambara assembly (where  the husband is self elected by the bride herself) and <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">afterwards married her according to the rule called Râkhsasa Vidhi </span>(one of the eight forms of marriage in Hindu Law in which a girl is forcibly seized and carried away after the defeat or destruction of her relatives in battle).” Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Krishna had also beaten up Mitravinda’s brother before marrying her,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 10.83.12 “Śrī Mitravindā said: At my svayaṁvara ceremony He came forward, defeated all the kings present — including my brothers, who dared insult Him — and took me away just as a lion removes his prey from amidst a pack of dogs. Thus Lord Kṛṣṇa, the shelter of the goddess of fortune, brought me to His capital city. May I be allowed to serve Him by washing His feet, life after life.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Krishna also beat Jambavati’s father before marrying her, Jambavati after fighting Krishna for 27 days presented his daughter to Krishna,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 10.83.10 “Śrī Jāmbavatī said: Unaware that Lord Kṛṣṇa was none other than his own master and worshipable Deity, the husband of Goddess Sītā, my father fought with Him for twenty-seven days. When my father finally came to his senses and recognized the Lord, he took hold of His feet and presented Him with both me and the Syamantaka jewel as tokens of his reverence. I am simply the Lord’s maidservant.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Krishna married 16,100 princesses after liberating them from a demon and he also married eight other princesses on various occasions. Apart from 16,108 wives, Krishna had several hundred or thousands of concubines/girlfriends, they were mostly Gopis the milk-maids. Among all, Krishna’s favourite girlfriend was Radha who was his maternal aunt, it is uncertain whether Krishna married her or not but many major sources don’t speak anything about their marriage. Several verses from Purana show that his concubines/girlfriends known as Gopis (milk-maids) had husbands and even children,</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 5.13.55-61 “The Gopis repeatedly exclaimed, “Bravo, Krishna!” to his song. When leading, they followed him; when returning, they encountered him; and, whether he went forwards or backwards, they ever attended on his steps. Whilst frolicking thus with the Gopis, they considered every instant without him a myriad of years; and, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">prohibited in vain by husbands</span>, fathers, brothers, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">they went forth at night to sport with Krishnna</span>, the object of their affection…” Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Gopis addresses Balrama the elder brother of Krishna after Krishna abandoned them,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 10.65.11-12 “For Kṛṣṇa’s sake, O descendant of Dāśārha, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">we abandoned our mothers, fathers, brothers, husbands, children</span> and sisters, even though these family relations are difficult to give up. But now, O Lord, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">that same Kṛṣṇa has suddenly abandoned us and gone away</span>, breaking off all affectionate ties with us. And yet how could any woman fail to trust His promises?” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>So this proves that those Gopis were already married and even had children. This shows that apart from 16,108 wives he had illicit relationship with Gopis. I wonder what kind of married woman would leave her husband and children to become a concubine? It may have been that they were forced into concubinage by Krishna. He not just had illicit relations with Gopis but with other independent women too, Krishna had sex with a hunchback woman in her own house,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 10.48.6-7 ”Calling forward His beloved, who was anxious and shy at the prospect of this new contact, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">the Lord pulled her by her bangled hands onto the bed. Thus He enjoyed with that beautiful girl</span>, whose only trace of piety was her having offered ointment to the Lord. — Simply by smelling the fragrance of Kṛṣṇa’s lotus feet, Trivakra cleansed away the burning lust Cupid had aroused in her breasts, chest and eyes. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">With her two arms she embraced between her breasts her lover, Śrī Kṛṣṇa</span>, the personification of bliss, and thus she gave up her long-standing distress.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Krishna Janma Khanda 72.56-69 ”…So saying, Krishna, the asylum of fortune, held the licentious woman to his breast. Made her naked, associated with her and kissed her. Then the hump-backed woman, while relishing the initial sexual intercourse, dragged Krisna to her arms like Kamala and kissed his cheek. Both the pair were particularly proficient in matters relating to sexual intercourse from which they did not desist for a moment. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The intercourse took several forms</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Then Lord Krisna lacerated the rising breast and the loins of the woman with the strokes of his keen nails and her lips with the bite of his teeth</span>. Later on, at day-break, when he passed the semen, the beautiful hump-backed woman in the excess of her enjoyments fainted…” Tr. Rajendra Nath Sen</p>
<p>He had committed fornication with an independent woman named Naradi,</p>
<p>Narada Purana, Uttarabhaga 80.31-32 “When the messengers returned, Naradi was called by the lover of cowherdesses. After bowing down to the lord, she went near him bashfully. The man of taste (Lord Krsna) embraced her, had the sportful dalliance with her and then dismissed her. Gradually she came once again to the lake Puspasaras.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Krishna’s act with Radha</p>
<p>Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Krishna Janma Khanda 127.1-21 ”…Lord Krisna dragged her to his beast and kissed her lips (upper and lower), the chin and both the sides of her cheek. Radha also kissed the handsome lunar face of Krisna and with both her hands pressed Krisna, the Lord of her life, to her bosom. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Lord Krisna committed the desired act of sexual intercourse in sixteen ways as prescribed by the sexual science</span> and calculated to please both man and wife. He lacerated the whole constitution of Radha with marks of nail and bit her lips whereby there was a thrill of raptures in his body and he experienced a feeling of lassitude…” Tr. Rajendra Nath Sen</p>
<p><strong>Sex with other Concubines</strong></p>
<p>Let me show you how this vulgar act of Krishna is praised in the Hindu scripture. And how he used to fornicate with them,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 10.33.16-17 ”In this way Lord Kṛṣṇa, the original Lord Nārāyaṇa, master of the goddess of fortune, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">took pleasure in the company of the young women of Vraja by embracing them, caressing them</span> and glancing lovingly at them as He smiled His broad, playful smiles. It was just as if a child were playing with his own reflection.— Their senses overwhelmed by the joy of having His physical association, <span style="color: #ff0000;">the gopis could not prevent their hair, their dresses and the cloths covering their breasts from becoming disheveled</span>. Their garlands and ornaments scattered, O hero of the Kuru dynasty.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 10.29.45-46 ”Sri Kṛṣṇa went with the gopis to the bank of the Yamuna, where the sand was cooling and the wind, enlivened by the river’s waves, bore the fragrance of lotuses. There Kṛṣṇa threw His arms around the gopīs and embraced them. <span style="color: #ff0000;">He aroused Cupid in the beautiful young ladies of Vraja by touching their hands, hair, </span><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">thighs, belts and </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">breasts</span></strong>, by playfully scratching them with His fingernails, and also by joking with them, glancing at them and laughing with them. In this way the Lord enjoyed His pastimes.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Skanda Purana II.iii.4.17 ”With the tip of his nail with which he had pierced the neck of hyena, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">he pinched the breasts of the cowherd lasses</span>. He has been sportingly given many form by young women. Let this Sesa (?) be for (i.e. bring about) calmness and peace.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Krishna Janma Khanda 46.61-71 ”…On the other hand Siva was also engaged in the sexual act.” Saint Narayana said, ‘Lord Krishna having said so to the glancing, smiling Radha went along with her to the sandal forest…O saint, Radha and the Lord of the sphere became paralysed through the pleasure of sexual intercourse and being intimately associated with one another, they spent their time there…” Tr. Rajendra Nath Sen</p>
<p>Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Krishna Janma Khanda 69.1-11 ”…Lord Krisna who was anxious to enjoy the taste of the Rasa <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">copulated with the clever Radha according to the measure supplied by sixty-four practical arts</span> in the sphere of the Rasa.’ At that time the loins and the spherical breast of Radha were lacerated with the injuries inflicted by the nails of Krisna; the vermillion-mark on the partings of her hairs on the head was obliterated; and her chignon was relaxed. Later on, the naked Radha thrilling with raptures and fainting with the excess of pleasure was harboured by the goddess of sleep.” Tr. Rajendra Nath Sen</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 3.3.21 ”The Lord enjoyed His pastimes, both in this world and in other worlds [higher planets], specifically in the association of the Yadu dynasty. At leisure hours offered by night, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">He enjoyed the friendship of conjugal love with women</span>.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 10.30.33-34 <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Certainly Kṛṣṇa sat down here with His girlfriend</span></p>
<p>to arrange Her hair. <span style="color: #ff0000;">The lusty boy </span>must have made a crown for that lusty girl out of the flowers He had collected. — [Śukadeva Gosvāmī continued:] <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Lord Kṛṣṇa enjoyed with that gopī, although He enjoys only within, being self-satisfied</span> and complete in Himself. Thus by contrast He showed the wretchedness of ordinary lusty men and hardhearted women.<br />
Kurma Purana 1.26.14-16 ”A certain fawn eyed damsel, fascinated by passionate love, approached Krsna and kissed his lotus like face. Catching hold of the hand of Govinda, the first cause of the wordls, a certain girl who was deluded by his Maya, took him to her own house. Assuming multifarious forms sportively, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">the lotus-eyed Lord Krsna fulfilled their desires</span>.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Krishna Janma Khanda 105.1-10 <span style="color: #ff0000;">”He put on her forehead a beautiful mark of vermillion and painted lines of cosmetics on her breast</span>. He also painted the members of her lotus feet with lac dye and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">then with his nails constructed an artificial lotus on her loins and breast</span>. Then Krisna got up and along with Radha went to the local lovely pond fall of water…” Tr. Rajendra Nath Sen</p>
<p>Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Krishna Janma Khanda 52.20-28 ”…There Krisna assumed several forms at once and the sametime and indulged with the cow-herdesses in the sport which enchants licentious people. He held in his embrace the passionate Radha and went up to the temple of lust constructed by the Viswa-Karma. Afterwards at that place he slept with Radha on a bed redolent of the Champaka and annointed her with sandal, aloe, musk and saffron. The lustful Krisna versed in sexual science sported with the licentious Radha in several ways.” Tr. Rajendra Nath Sen</p>
<p>Brahma Vairvarta Purana, Krishna Janma Khanda 29.1-10 ”…Some passionate milk-maid said to Krishna, the lord of her life, ”Krisna, wrap me in your yellow dress.” Someone said to Krisna, the Lord of the universe, ”Lord, apply vermillion to my forehead.” Someone arrived there soon and said, ”Lord, arrange the lock of my hair and bind my chignon.” Some milk-maid bent on her toilet deputed Krisna to fetch sandal foliage for her ear-rings. Someone by mysterious signs explained to him what was passing in her heart and with a face beaming with smiles looked at him soliciting sexual intercourse. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Some milk-maids dragged him by force, snatched from his flute, took away his yellow dress, made him naked and smiled</span></strong>. Some dignified girl said to the conqueror of Madhu, ”Lord, paint the nails of my feet with lac-dye.” Someone said affectionately to him, ”O Lord of my life, paint my cheek and breast with lines of cosmetics of various colours.” Tr. Rajendra Nath Sen</p>
<p>It is mentioned in Brahma Vaivarta Purana Krishna Janma Khanda 53.16-27 that Krishna did all those things mentioned above which the Gopis demanded. He did these shameless act with the milk maids who had husbands and children. It doesn’t behove for a god to act in this manner. The above verse from Brahma Vaivart Purana shows that he was denuded by those milk maids and instead of being embarrassed and feeling guilty he smiled like a shameless person. Can such person be considered a god?</p>
<p><strong>Krishan’s grandson Pradumyna</strong></p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Rudra Samhita 2, Yuddha Khanda section 5, Ch 52, verses 50-53 “Then taking leave of her friend, and knowing him to be the grandson of Ksna, Citralekha got ready to go to Dvaraka with the velocity of the mind…Then in the park of the <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">harem the son of Pradyumna was seen by her playing with women and drinking wine</span>. He was dark complexioned but beautiful in every limb, smiling in the prime of youth.” Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p><strong>SHIVA</strong></p>
<p>In the Mahabharata, Shiva is said to have fornicated with wives and daughters of Rishis,</p>
<p>Mahabharata 13.14.157 “He sports with the daughters and wives of the Rishis. His hair is long and erect. He is perfectly nude for he has the horizon for his dress. He has terrible eyes.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>As per a story from Shiva Purana, Shiva is said to have assumed the form of a merchant to test a prostitute, Shiva had fornicated with the prostitute named Mahananda, I wonder if it was really a test or if he wanted to enjoy on the pretext of the test?</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Satarudra Samhita 3, Chapter 26, verses 1-31 &#8220;O dear sage, listen to me. I shall tell you about Vaiśyanātha, the incarnation of Śiva, the supreme soul that yields great bliss. Formerly, in Nandigrāma there was a prostitute known as Mahānandā. She was very beautiful and a devotee of Śiva. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Once Śiva assumed the form of a merchant</span> and visited her house to test her. He had assumed the auspicious form of a devotee&#8230;The beautiful prostitute worshipped and welcomed the visitor with great joy. She made him sit with great respect&#8230;.<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">During the night she had her sexual union with the merchant</span> who behaved like a libertine. She then went to sleep on the couch brilliant with a soft bed.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Shiva in order “to test” the devotion of a couple, went to their house as a Brahmin guest, the husband Sudarshana had advised his wife to treat their guests well as guests are equivalent to Shiva. Finding that Sudarshana was not in the house, Shiva had sex with the wife of Sudarshana, meanwhile, Sudarshana arrived at his home but Shiva brazenly and shamelessly told him that he is having sex with Sudarshana’s wife, Sudarshana instead of rebuking Shiva was “delighted” and went away.</p>
<p>Linga Purana, Section I, chapter 29, verses 46-64 &#8220;Formerly, a householder known as Sudarsana, vowed to conquer the God of Death. He said to his chaste wife. &#8216;O lady of good holy rites, fine eye-brows and good fortune, listine to what I say, assiduously. Never should you dishonour the guests who visit your gouse. Since everyone of the guests is the Pinaka bearing lord, you should dedicate even your self to the guest and adore him&#8230;O excellent brahmins, in order to test their devotion, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Dharma himself assumed the form of a brahmin</span> and came to the house of the sage&#8230;Dharma disguised as a brahmin said &#8216;O gentle lady where has your noble husband Sudarsana gone? O noble lady, enough of this cooked rice and other eatable! <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">I say, you should dedicate yourself (to me)</span>&#8216; Remembering what had been previously mentioned by her husband that chaste lady full of bashfulness and with closed eyes, began to move (towards him)&#8230;all the same, she made up her mind to dedicate herself to Dharma there itself at the behest of her own husband. In the meantime, Sudarsana, the husband of that lady, came to the threshold and called to her &#8216;Come, come, O gentle lady? Where have you been?&#8217; It was the guest himself who replied to him. &#8216;O Sudarsana, O highly blessed one, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">I am now engaged in sexual intercourse with this wife of yours</span>. What should be done here may kindly be mentioned. O leading brahmin, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">the sexual intercourse is concluded</span>. O excellent brahmin, I am satisfied.&#8217; <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Sudarsana the noble brahmin then said in great delight:- &#8216;O excellent brahmin, enjoy her as you please. I shall go away now</span>.&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edied by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Padma Purana I.56.1-10 states that Shiva saw some beautiful Gandharis, Kinnaras and humans and wanted to have sex with them, he cast a spell on them which dragged them into the sky, where he had sex with them, meanwhile Parvati saw all that and became angry, she assumed a form and assaulted those women, as a result, their faces were disfigured, she also cursed them due to which they became Chandalas.</p>
<p>Padma Purana, Sṛṣṭi-khaṇḍa 1, chapter 56, verses 1-10 &#8220;Formerly, Śarva (i.e. Śaṅkara), having seen youthful and beautiful women of Gandharvas, Kinnaras and human beings, and with <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">his mind set on them</span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">pretended to be intent on practising penance</span>, and with a spell dragged them far away into the sky. Then the great lord, the conqueror of the god of love, having fashioned a very delightful cottage, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">sported (there) with them</span>. In the meanwhile, Gaurī’s mind became excited. By means of meditation she saw the lord of the world, sporting with women. Knowing his intention she became angry. Then taking the form of Kṣemaṅkarī[1], she entered (the sky), and saw, far away in a lonely region of the sky, Hara (i.e. Śiva), whose lustre was like that of the god of love, who was in the midst of beautiful women, who, the best man, was bright, who, having again and again embraced the women, was sporting with them, who was kissing them excessively, and who was tormented by the passion of love. Seeing this, Kṣemaṅkarī, came down&#8230; Dragging them (by seizing) their hair, she angrily kicked them by her foot. All the women reached (i.e. fell on) the ground, and suddenly their faces were disfigured. With their bodies scorched by Umā’s, curse they came under the sway of Mlecchas. Those women, widows or with their husbands alive are known as Cāṇḍāla. Even now they would experience the curse given by Umā.&#8221; Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p><strong>VISHNU</strong></p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Satarudra Samhita 3, 22.45-46 In the meantime Visnu saw those damsels born of nectar sprays who were haughty due to their divine beauty and whose faces resembled the full moon. Fascinated by the cupid’s arrow <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Visnu attained highest pleasure only there. He began to indulge in sexual dalliance with those women</span> of exquisite beauty…” Tr. Board of Scholars, Edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p><strong>KARTIKKEYA</strong></p>
<p>Kartikkeya was the son of Shiva. His mother Parvati told him to enjoy his life as wished. He took advantage of this and started committing adultery with the wives of gods. Many heaven dwellers tried to stop him but he didn’t so they requested Parvati to do something. Urged by those people Parvati changed the appearance of women as herself whom Kartikkeya was approaching, so at last this stopped Kartikeya from committing adultery,</p>
<p>Brahma Purana: Gautami Mahatmya 11.2-5 “When the asura Taraka was killed and the three worlds became quiet and normal, Parvati spoke to her eldest son Karttikeya with great pleasure: ‘By my consent and the grace of your father, be delighted in your mind. Enjoy as you please the worldly pleasures in the three worlds, which are dear to your mind.’ Thus addressed by his mother, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Visakha (Karttikeya) the beloved of gods, sported about as be pleased with the wives of gods. The wives of gods also sported about. While the wives of gods were being enjoyed</span>, O Narada, the heaven-dwellers were not able to prevent Karrtikeya.” Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p><strong>INDRA</strong></p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 9.40.13-25 ”Nârâyana said :– In ancient days<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">, Indra the Lord of the three worlds, intoxicated with wine and becoming lustful and shameless, began to enjoy Rambhâ</span> in a lonely grove. After having enjoyed her, he became attracted to her; his mind being wholly drawn to her, he remained there in that forest, his mind becoming very passionate.” Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p><strong>OTHERS</strong></p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 8.5.1-31 “Here the Devas live always with numerous hordes of women and have their free amorous, dealings with them, to their heart’s contents and they hear the sweet songs sung by the Gandharbas and Kinnaras, the Upa Devatâs about their own glorious deeds.” Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>There are two versions on the birth of the monkey god Hanuman, it is said that his biological father was the wind god Vayu and other version shows he was actually Shiva’s incarnation born from Shiva’s sperm,</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana 2.3.7.223-227 ”…Kesari married the daughter of Kunjara named Anjana. That lady of great purity and good fortune went to a park named Pumsavana. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Vayu (the wind-god) made advances to the lady who was proud of her youth.</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Hanuman was born of her union with Vayu</span> the (source of) life into the entire universe…” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>This is also mentioned in Valmiki Ramayana,</p>
<p>Valmiki Ramayana Kishkindha Kanda 4, Sarga 66, Verses 17-18 “On listening the words of Anjana the Air-god spoke this in reply, ‘oh, high-hipped one, I don’t dishonour you, hence let there be no fear in your heart, for I am the all-permeating Air-god. By which reason I embraced you and impregnate myself within you, by that reason you are impregnated in a supersensory manner, thereby you will beget a valiant son endowed with intellect.” Tr. K.M.K. Murthy</p>
<p>It is mentioned in Shiva Purana that after Shiva emitted his semen, the semen was taken via leaf and poured into the ears of Anjani by the sages. Later Hanuman was born as a reincarnation of Shiva</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Sataruda Samhita 3.20.3-7 ”Once lord Siva of wonderfu sports saw Visnu in the form of an enchantress with glittering qualities. As if hit by the arrows of Cupid, Siva let fall his semen dislodged from its seat, for Rama’s work. Eagerly urged by him mentally for Rama’s work the seven celestial sages retained that semen in a leaf. For Rama’s work that semen was poured through the ears of Anjani, the daughter of Gautama, by those sages. In due course Siva was born of it in the form of a monkey named Hanumat. He had great strength and exploit.” Tr. Board of Scholars, Edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p><strong>DATTATREYA AND LAKSHMI</strong></p>
<p>Purana obscurely states that Dattatreya had sex with Lakshmi,</p>
<p>Markandeya Purana 18.23-32 “Thus exhorted the gods then went to <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Dattatreya’s hermitage, and they beheld the high-souled Muni, attended by Lakshmi</span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">hymned by Gandharvas and engrossed in quaffing spirituous liquor</span>…Daddatreya addressed the prostrate gods, ‘What desire ye of me, that ye do me this obeisance…<span style="text-decoration: underline;">I am drinking strong drink</span>, I have remnants of food in my mouth, nor I subdued my senses. How is it, O gods, ye seek for victory over your enemies even from me?’ <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The gods spoke. Thou art sinless</span>, O lord of the world; no stain hast thou, into whose heart, purified by the ablution of learning, has entered the light of knowledge. True is this, o gods! all learning have I, who am impartial in view: <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">but by reason of association with this woman</span> I am now impure after eating. For commerce with women when continually pursued tends to depravity. Thus addressed, the gods then spoke again. This woman, O sinless brahman! is the mother of the world; she is not depraved…”</p>
<p>Lakshmi was present there and then he tells the gods that he had copulation with this woman (i.e. Lakshmi), Padma Purana tells us that Dattatreya had sex with Lakshmi though it doesn’t mention Lakshmi but the above verse attests to this statement,</p>
<p>Padma Purana II.103.110-113 “Atri’s son Dattatreya, the high-souled brahmana, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">the great sage, with his eyes red due to (having drunk) spirituous liquor, was sporting with a woman</span>. The virtuous one, intoxicated by wine, having seated a young, auspicious woman, best of all women, on his lap, sang, danced and heavily drank liquor…” Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p><strong>MITRA</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Vishnu created Urvashi and made her head of all Apsaras, Mitra had sexual relationship with him. This story seems to be another version of Mitra-Varuna ejaculating on seeing Urvashi.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Matsya Purana 61.25-26 &#8220;This is the nymph Urvasi, O Devas! and I have created her to become the head of all Apsaras. Then the God Mitra called her, and asked her to enjoy with Him, which she accepted.&#8221; Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, edited by B.D. Basu</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> </span></p>
<p><strong>RISHIS</strong></p>
<p>Aniruddha the grandson of Krishna had fornicated with Uma the daughter of Bana,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 10.62.22 “When Usa beheld Him, the most beautiful of men, her face lit up with joy. She took the son of Pradyumna to her private quarters, which men were forbidden even to see, and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">there enjoyed with Him</span>.” Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">An Apsara named Somada served Muni Chuli, who satisfied with her service asked her wishes, she told him that she wishes for a son but that she is unmarried and doesn’t wish to get married and requests the Muni to bestow a son, the Muni through his so called power of mind impregnated her,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Valmiki Ramayana, Bala Kanda 1, Sarga 33, verses 13-18 &#8220;Even she is obedient in his respect, and dedicating herself in ministering to him she stayed there righteously. After some time that sage Chuli has become satisfied with her service&#8230;Perceiving that the sage is contented that female celestial Somada who is aware of making good sentences is highly delighted and spoke with her melodious voice to that pedantic sage. I am unmarried and nobody&#8217;s wife, safe you be, and as I took shelter under your kindness it will be apt of you to endow me a son with your faculty of asceticism.&#8217; So said Somada to sage Cuulii. That Brahma-sage Cuuli benignantly bestowed her with a unique and Brahma-like son who is renowned as Brahmadatta, as well as his own brainchild.&#8221; Tr. Desiraju Hanumanta Rao</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The sage Gautama who cursed Indra for ravishing his wife had too ejaculated on seeing Saradvati after having sex with her,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Shiva Purana, UmaSamhita 5, chapter 4, verses 32-33 ”The sage Gautama had his mind deluded by Siva’s Maya. On seeing Saradvati in the nude </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000; font-size: 12pt;">he was excited and he indulged in sexual intercourse with her. He collected the semen emitted in a wooden bowl</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">.” Tr. Board of Scholars, Edited by J.L. Shastri</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Rishi Medhavin commit</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">s</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> adultery with Apsara Manjugosha in the forest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Padma Purana VI.46.9-24 &#8220;A celestial nymph known as Manjughosa started to infatuate an excellent sage named Medhavin, best among sages, who was a celibate and lived there&#8230;Having seen the best sage staying there, that Manjugosha was overpowered by Cupid (i.e. passion of love) and she sang gently. That best sage, having seen her singing like that, with her bracelets jingling and her anklets and girdle tinkling, was forcibly deluded by Cupid with his army. That beautiful woman Manjughosa, seeing that sage like that, approached him and deluded him with feminine conquettish gestures; and keeping her lute down (on the ground) she embraced that lord of sages, as a creeper would encircle a tree shaking due to the velocity of the wind. That best sage, Medhavin, too rejoiced with her. Seeing in that (forest) only her excellent body, his auspicious nature left him, and he was influenced by the nature of Cupid. The lover did not know (i.e. care for) night or day, while rejoicing with her.&#8221; Tr. N.A Deshpande</span></p>
<p>Apart from committing adultery, the gods were also fond of stealing the garments of women. The below section also includes Gods and Rishis committing adultery.</p>

<p>Hindu gods were also fond of stealing the garments of women to watch their naked bodies. This is venerated on temples through idols, there are idols of this shameless act by their Bhagwans in temples. Hindus boldly hang the portrait of Krishna stealing the clothes of Gopis while the Gopis coming out of the water in a fully nude state. However Krishna was not the only God who did this, several other gods did this act too,</p>
<p>Mahabharata 1.72.1-9 “Kanwa continued, ‘And Sakra, thus addressed by her, then commanded him who could approach every place (viz., the god of the wind) to be present with Menaka at the time she would be before the Rishi. And the timid and beautiful Menaka then entered the retreat and saw there Viswamitra who had burnt, by his penances, all his sins, and was engaged still in ascetic penances. And saluting the Rishi, <span style="color: #ff0000;">she then began to sport before him. </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">And just at that time Marut robbed her of her garments that were white as the Moon</span>. And she thereupon ran, as if in great bashfulness, to catch hold of her attire, and as if she was exceedingly annoyed with Marut. And she did all this before the very eyes of Viswamitra who was endued with energy like that of fire. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">And Viswamitra saw her in that attitude</span>. And beholding her divested of her robes, he saw that she was of faultless feature. And that best of Munis saw that she was exceedingly handsome, with no marks of age on her person. And beholding her beauty and accomplishments that bull amongst Rishis was possessed with lust and made a sign that he desired her companionship. And he invited her accordingly, and she also of faultless features expressed her acceptance of the invitation. And they then passed a long time there in each other’s company. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">And sporting with each other, just as they pleased, for a long time as if it were only a single day, the Rishi begat on Menaka a daughter named Sakuntala</span>.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Krishna stole the garments of Gopis just to enjoy watching their naked bodies and later gave a lame excuse,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 10.22.16-17 “The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: If you girls are actually My maidservants, and if you will really do what I say, then come here with your innocent smiles and <span style="color: #ff0000;">let each girl pick out her clothes</span>. If you don’t do what I say, I won’t give them back to you. And even if the king becomes angry, what can he do? <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Then, shivering from the painful cold, all the young girls rose up out of the water, covering their pubic area with their hands</span>.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Krishna had done a similar act to his aunt Radha in front of all the Gopis,</p>
<p>Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Krishna Janma Khanda 28.117-132 …<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Hari snatched away the cloth of Radha and thus denuded her</span>. Then he tore her wreath and loosened her chignon…Hari embraced the naked Radha, sank into the water and after having played therein got up again along with her. Then Krishna after having displayed the abashed, naked Radha to the cowherdesses threw her again at a distance into the water….Then Radha dragged Hari and gave him a push whereupon the Lord of the universe was immersed in deep water at a distance. But shortly afterwards he emerged from the liquid with a smile, <span style="color: #ff0000;">kissed and embraced the naked Radha, again and again</span>…After the play was over, the naked Lord and Radha both came to the coast and demanded their clothes from one another….” Tr. Rajendra Nath Sen</p>
<p>For fun, Indra blew the garments of girls taking bath,</p>
<p>Matysa Purana 27.3-5 ”…Accepting the request of the Devas, the Maghavan, along with them, set out on his mission and, in the way, he came across a group of women in the forest. He saw those damsels bathing and enjoying themselves, as they do in they do in the pleasure-garden of Kuvera. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Then Indra, in the form of a gust of wind, blew away and mixed up their garments</span>. At that, all the maidens, hastily coming out of water, dressed themselves with the clothes as they found them.” Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, Edited by B.D. Basu</p>

<h2><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Dancing Girls</span></h2>
<p>The gods were no different from present-day lecherous people, they had the habit of fornicating with women, drinking liquor, and even watching girls dancing. We have already seen an instance of the assembly of gods where the Apsaras were dancing.</p>
<p>As per Ramayana of Valmiki, Uttarakhanda 7, Sarga 42, Verses 18-23 Rama the so called Maryada Purshottom (ideal man) is said to have made his wife Sita drink wine and then enjoyed the dance of women. I have mentioned this in <a href="/index.php/2019/04/11/intoxicant-consumption-in-hinduism/" data-wpel-link="internal">Intoxicant Consumption in Hinduism </a>article.</p>
<p>Below are some verses from Srimad Bhagavatam about Krishna dancing with Gopis.</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 10.33.2 ”There on the Yamuna’s banks Lord Govinda then began the pastime of the rasa dance in the company of those jewels among women, the faithful gopis, who joyfully linked their arms together. [7-8] As the gopis sang in praise of Krishna, their feet danced, their hands gestured, and their eyebrows moved with playful smiles. With their braids and belts tied tight, their waists bending, their faces perspiring, the garments on their breasts moving this way and that, and their earrings swinging on their cheeks, Lord Krishna’s young consorts shone like streaks of lightning in a mass of clouds. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Eager to enjoy conjugal love</span>, their throats colored with various pigments, the gopis sang loudly and danced. They were overjoyed by Krishna’s touch, and they sang songs that filled the entire universe. [10-12] When one gopi grew tired from the rasa dance, She turned to Krishna, standing at Her side holding a baton, and grasped His shoulder with Her arm. The dancing had loosened Her bracelets and the flowers in Her hair. Upon the shoulder of one gopi Krishna placed His arm, whose natural blue-lotus fragrance was mixed with that of the sandalwood pulp anointing it. As the gopi relished that fragrance, her bodily hair stood on end in jubilation, and she kissed His arm. Next to Krishna’s cheek one gopi put her own, beautified by the effulgence of her earrings, which glittered as she danced. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Krishna then carefully gave her the betel nut He was chewing</span>. [17-18] Their senses overwhelmed by the joy of having His physical association, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the gopis could not prevent their hair, their dresses and the cloths covering their breasts from becoming disheveled</span>. Their garlands and ornaments scattered, O hero of the Kuru dynasty. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The wives of the demigods, observing Krishna’s playful activities from their airplanes, were entranced and became agitated with lust</span>. Indeed, even the moon and his entourage, the stars, became astonished. [22] <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Lord Krishna’s garland had been crushed during His conjugal dalliance with the gopis and colored vermilion by the kunkuma powder on their breasts</span>…” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Other gods also enjoyed dance of women and nymphs,</p>
<p>Skanda Purana V.iii.172.1-2 ”Sri Markandeya said: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Then all the sages and Devas with Indra at their head came to the meritorious hermitage</span> of Mandavya on the banks of Narmada. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The courtesans began to dance to the tunes of the songs of the celestial damsels</span>. Lights shone and conchs and Dundubhi drums were sounded.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Brahma Khanda 13.1-10 ”…Having tasted the pleasures of a kingdom for some time in the company of his wives, once upon a time, singing the eulogies of Hari, he suddenly came to Brahma at the shrine of the Puskara. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">At that time Brahma was witnessing the dance of a celestial nymph called Rambha along with other gods</span>. Suddenly he (Upavarhana) became impatient at the sight of her thigh (beautiful like plantain) and hard, spehrical rising breast exposed by the wind. His semen was discharged…” Tr. Rajendra Nath Sen</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana 2.3.31.22-23 &#8220;There he saw Brahma of unmeasured prowess, seated on a beautiful throne set with gems and jewels. He was adorned with ornaments set with gems and jewels. He was surrounded by leading Siddhas and sages engaged in meditation. He was gaily and smilingly watching the dance of Vidyadhara damsels.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Skanda Purana I.iii (P).12.81-83 &#8220;Surrounded and accompanied by sages and Devas and in accompaniment to the songs of the music party of Tumbura interspersed with the continuous dances of the celestial damsels, the Bull-emblemed Lord was seen there seated on his bull. Siva, the receptacle of sympathy, the enemy of the god of Love and great on account of his fortitude, gracefully approached Siva who was standing with the head bent low. Dispelling her bashfulness he placed her on his lap and became delighted. Accompanied by Lalita, his beloved, and surrounded by the assembly of Suras and leading sages, he witnessed the graceful dances of the celestial damsels to the accompaniment of music He repeatedly witnessed this with great eagerness.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Skanda Purana III.i.28.72-76 &#8220;Once, accompanied by all the immortal ones, the Slayer of Bala and Vrtra (i.e. Indra) was engaged in witnessing the dance of the celestial damsels in his court. King Puruavas too had come then to the court of Devas in order to witness the dance of the womenfol of Suras, the heaven-dwellers&#8230;&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Skanda Purana III.iii.2.98a &#8220;Rambha, Ghrtaci, Menaa, Purvacittti, Tilottama, Urvasi and other celestial damsels dance before Sambhu.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>

<h2><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Sex Life</span></h2>
<p>Many gods especially Krishna’s sex life is highly praised in the Hindu scripture. Here is how they had sex with their wives,</p>
<p><strong>KRISHNA</strong></p>
<p><strong>Krishna with his Wives</strong></p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 10.90.10-11 <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Under the drenched clothing of the queens, their thighs and breasts would become visible</span>. The flowers tied in their large braids would scatter as they sprayed water on their consort, and on the plea of trying to take away His syringe, they would embrace Him. <span style="color: #ff0000;">By His touch their lusty feelings would increase</span>, causing their faces to beam with smiles. Thus Lord Kṛṣṇa’s queens shone with resplendent beauty. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Lord Kṛṣṇa’s </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">flower garland would become smeared with kuṅkuma from their breasts</span>, and His abundant locks of hair would become disheveled as a result of His absorption in the game. As the Lord repeatedly sprayed His young consorts and they sprayed Him in turn, He enjoyed Himself like the king of elephants enjoying in the company of his bevy of she-elephants.</p>
<p>Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Krishna Janma Khanda 112.34-46 ”O Narada, later on, Lord Krisna in due order by turns committed sexual intercourse on the auspicious day prescribed by the Vedas with seven women, viz., Kalindi, Satyabhama, Satya, NagnaJiti, sati, Jambavati and Laksmana. In course of time, each of these seven women bore ten sons and one daughter…” Tr. Rajendra Nath Sen</p>
<p><strong>SHIVA</strong></p>
<p>Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Krishna Janma Khanda 46.30-44 ”At that time, Parvati (who is the direct emblem of energy) and the powerful Sankara were not in the least exhausted by the above act…At that time they slept on a bed covered with flowers and with their heart animated with joy and with their bodies thrilling with raptures, they were pierced with the darts of Cupid, fainted and thus passed their days<span style="text-decoration: underline;">. Both of them who were expert in sexual science were rendered stark-naked through excess of pleasure</span>; and their bodies were marked with the injuries inflicted by teeth and nails. The sandal-paste, aloe-paste and musk of their bodies and the vermillion on the forehead of Parvati disappeared; the garland of both were torn and the chignon of Gauri was relaxed. O fair one, at the time of intercourse her anklet, bracelet, anklet and earrings continued to resound…The earth being overloaded with the energy of Siva, the supporter of the world, was about to be rent asunder and quaked along with mountains, forests and oceans…” Tr. Rajendra Nath Sen</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Rudra Samhitra 2, Sati Khanda 2, 21.19-24 ”Sometimes Siva would become invisible through his Maya and suddenly embrace her when she would become terrified and agitated. Sometime with musk <span style="text-decoration: underline;">he would make marks like bees on her breasts</span> that resembled the buds of a golden lotus. Sometimes he would take the necklace off her <span style="text-decoration: underline;">breasts and press them with his hands</span>…Even as she was looking on, sometimes <span style="text-decoration: underline;">he would come to her lofty breasts saying with laughter, this dark spot ”Kalika” on your breasts</span> is your companion of the same colour as it contains the same letter as are found in your name ‘Kalika’.” Tr. Board of Scholars, Edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 6.17.7 ”Lord Śiva, whose hair is matted on his head, has certainly undergone great austerities and penances. Indeed, he is the president in the assembly of strict followers of Vedic principles. Nonetheless<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">, he is seated with his wife on his lap in the midst of saintly persons and is embracing her</span> as if he were a shameless, ordinary human being.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Rudra Samhita 2, Kumara Khanda 4, 1.24 ”For a thousand years according to the calculation of the gods, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Siva the Yogin has been engaged in sexual dalliance</span>. He does not desist from it.” Tr. Board of Scholars, Edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Skanda Purana I.iii(P).13.11-12”On hearing these words of the Goddess, Sambhu, the Lord of Sonacala, the bestower of boons, granted everything desired by her as a boon. He was desirous of having sexual intercourse with her. Out of eagerness Siva asked her to applied the fascinated musk (to herself).” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Once Shiva was so much aroused that he repeatedly told Nandi to bring Parvati, he also told that Parvati should dress herself properly. Shiva couldn’t even wait till she prepared her toilet and sent Nandin again and again. So some girls especially Uma the daughter of Bana thought it would be nice idea to assume the form of Parvati and copulate with Shiva, she was very desirous of cohabiting with Shiva because previously she had seen Shiva and Parvati engaged in intercourse. So she tried to assume the form of Parvati and approach Shiva but Parvati learnt about it and stopped her, Parvati later told her that a person will come in her dream and rape her and he will be her future husband. And that guy was the grandson of Krishna named Anirudha. There is little variation in the story, it is uncertain whether Parvati told this to Uma when Uma saw Shiva and Parvati copulating or when Uma was going to assume the form of Parvati when Shiva was aroused.</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Rudra Samhita 2, Yudha Khanda 5, 51.35-43 ”Then being glanced at by Kama who was not vanquished, the crescent-crested <span style="color: #ff0000;">lord Siva highly indulgent in sports spoke to Nandin</span>. Go and quickly from this forest and tell the dark complexioned Parvati everything and bring her here from Kailasa after she has bedecked herself… O excellent sage, then, at his importunity, Parvati, devoted to her husband, began to bedeck herself ardently…Siva who was extremely agitated told Nandin again. ”Dear, go again and fetch Parvati from there”. ”Yes, sir”, said he. He went to Parvati of sweet appearance and said: ”Your lord wishes to see you beautifully and gorgeously dressed. O goddess, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Siva is eagerly waiting for various sports</span>. O daughter of the mountain, please go <span style="color: #ff0000;">since the lord is distressed with passion</span>.”[61-62] Then the goddess Parvati bedecked herself zealously and went to Siva. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">She then sported with him</span>. O sage, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">at the end of the dalliance Lord Siva vanished</span> from the place accompanied by his wife, the Ganas and the gods.” Tr. Board of Scholars, Edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p><strong>VISHNU</strong></p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 9.14.4-23 ”…Ganga Devi was very much overpowered with enjoyment in her first intercourse with Narayana; so much so that She remained motionless…” Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p><strong>RISHIS</strong></p>
<p>Mahabharata 3.97.14-15 “…After a considerable time, O king, the illustrious Rishi one day beheld Lopamudra, blazing in ascetic splendour come up after the bath in her season. And pleased with the girl, for her services, her purity, and self control, as also with her grace and beauty, he summoned her for marital intercourse…” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p><strong>MANSAROVAR A HONEYMOON SPOT IN ANCIENT INDIA</strong></p>
<p>Indian government spends crores of rupees for Hindu pilgrims as a subsidy to travel to Mansarovar. But this pilgrimage site namely Mansarovar was more like a honeymoon spot used by Hindu gods and sages,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 3.23.39-40 ”In that aerial mansion he traveled to the pleasure valleys of Mount Meru, which were rendered all the more beautiful by cool, gentle, fragrant breezes that stimulated passion. In these valleys, the treasurer of the gods, Kuvera, surrounded by beautiful women and praised by the Siddhas, generally enjoys pleasure. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Kardama Muni also, surrounded by the beautiful damsels and his wife, went there and enjoyed for many, many years</span>. Satisfied by his wife, he enjoyed in that aerial mansion not only on Mount Meru but in different gardens known as Vaiśrambhaka, Surasana, Nandana, Puṣpabhadraka and Caitrarathya, and by the <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Mānasa-sarovara Lake</span>.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Mahabharata 1.157.22-31 ”…Hidimva sported with the Pandava and studied to make him happy. So also, in inaccessible regions of forests, and on mountain-breasts overgrown with blossoming trees on lakes resplendent with lotuses and lilies, islands of rivers and their pebbly banks, on sylvan streams with beautiful banks and mountain-currents, in picturesque woods with blossoming trees and creepers in Himalayan bowers, and various caves, on crystal pools smiling with lotuses, on sea-shores shining with gold and pearls, in beautiful towns and fine gardens, in woods sacred to the gods and on hill-sides, in the regions of Guhyakasand ascetics, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">on the banks of Manasarovara abounding</span> with fruits and flowers of every season Hidimva, assuming the handsomest form, sported with Bhima and studied to make him happy. Endued with the speed of the mind, <span style="color: #ff0000;">she sported with Bhima in all these regions, till in time, she conceived and brought forth a mighty son begotten upon her by the Pandava</span>…” Tr.

<h2><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Sex Slaves</span></h2>
<p>There is a story mentioned in Matsya Purana which tells us how the Devas used to capture women of non-Hindus (considered demons here) and forced them into prostitution. Can the Hindu digest these verses and show them to others so that everyone may know what Hinduism is really about? The verses are pretty clear and are self-explanatory s so I won’t be explaining or summarizing them,</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 71.26-30 ”Once upon a time thousands and thousands of the demons (Danavas, Asuras, Daityas and Raksasas) were killed in the war between the Devas and the demons. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Indra told their numberless widows and those women who were forcibly seized and enjoyed</span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">to lead the life of prostitutes and remain devoted to the kings and the Devas</span>. Indra continued, ‘You should look upon, with equal eye, the kings your masters and on Sudra. All of you will attain prosperity, according to your fate. <span style="color: #ff0000;">You should satisfy those who </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">would come to you with adequate sum of money to enjoy your company</span>, even if they be poor. ” Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, Edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>Indra told the widows of Demons (Non-Hindus) how they should lead their prostitution life,</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 71.44-45 ”That Brahmana should be well fed and be devoutly looked upon as cupid, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">for the sake of sexual enjoyment</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Each and every desire of that Brahmana should be satisfied by the woman devote</span>. She should, with all heart and soul and with a smile on her face, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">yield herself up to him</span>.” Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, Edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 71.56-59 <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">“</span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Henceforth, any Brahmana coming to them for the sake of sexual enjoyment on a Sunday, should be respected and honoured</span>. If with the consent of that Brahmana, another handsome person come to them, these women should, with love and affection and to the best of their ability, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">perform all the fiftyeight kinds of observances of Love, favourite of man and gods, which would lead to pregnancy</span> and which is not harmful to their soul’s welfare. ” Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, Edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>Bhishma had also taken women captives with him,</p>
<p>Mahabharata 1.102 ”Bhishma cut off, with his arrows, on the field of battle, bows, and flagstaffs, and coats of mail, and human heads by hundreds and thousands…Then that foremost of all wielders of weapons having vanquished in battle all those monarchs, pursued his way towards the capital of the Bharatas, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">taking those maidens with him</span>.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Hinduism clearly sanctions slavery, readers can go through the article <a href="/index.php/2014/01/01/slavery-in-hinduism/" data-wpel-link="internal">Slavery in Hinduism</a>. As discussed in this article in the Rape category under the sub-category Rape and Abduction is legitimized, that Hinduism permits Rakshasa form of marriage for the Kshatriya caste, It can be considered rape because it is done after the family of the girl is slain and she is forcibly taken away, Mahabharata 13.44 says that bridegroom may forcibly take away the girl he likes to marry even after killing or beheading the girl’s kinsmen and Manu Smriti 3.33 says that sometimes the girl forcibly taken away may cry and weep and this is permitted in Mahabharata 1.73.</p>
<p>Many Hindu scriptures speak about female slaves and having sexual relation with them,</p>
<p>Narada Smriti 12.78 “<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Intercourse is permitted with a wanton woman, who belongs to another than the Brahman caste, or a prostitute, or a female slave</span>, or a female not restrained by her master (nishakasini), if these women belong to a lower caste than oneself; but with a woman of superior caste, intercourse is prohibited.” Tr. Julius Jolly</p>
<p>Katyayana Smriti verse 723 “When a master has sexual intercourse with his female slave and the latter then gives birth to a son, the master looking to the seed (which was his own) should make the female slave free from slavery together with her progeny.” Tr. P.V. Kane</p>
<p>Agni Purana 211.37-43 ”…By making the gift of a female slave to one of the foremost of the Brahmanas, a man becomes an inmate of the region of the Apasaras (nymphs)…” Tr. Manmath Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Hinduism also levies custom duties on importing female slaves,</p>
<p>Agni Purana 223.23-29 ”…Duties payable on importing female slaves into the country should be determined with a due regard to the country imported from and the time of the import. The duties payable on animals and gold shall be a fifth and sixth part of the original value, while a sixth part of their value should be paid as the kings dues on importing articles of perfumery, cereals, flowers, roots…” Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Krishna also gave many females slaves,</p>
<p>Mahabharata 4.72.19-26 ”…And Krishna gave unto each of the illustrious sons of Pandu numerous female slaves, and gems and robes…” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Krishna’s father Vasudeva also had over a thousand concubines,</p>
<p>Mahabharata 16.7.37-38 ”The Brahmanas and Kshatriyas, and Vaisyas, and wealthy Sudras, set out, keeping before them the 16,000 women that had formed Vasudeva’s harem, and Vajra, the grandson of the intelligent Krishna.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Hindu god Rama’s father named Dasharath also had many concubines, I am reproducing the passage where Dashrath’s organizes Ashvamedha Yajna,</p>
<p>Valmiki Ramayan, Bala Kanda 1.14.35 ”Thus, the officiating priests of the ritual, namely hota, adhwaryu and udgaata have received in their hand the Crowned Queen, the neglected wife, and <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">a concubine</span> of the king, next as a symbolic donation in the ritual by the performer, the king.” Tr. Shri Desiraju Hanumanth Rao</p>
<p>Hindu scriptures on concubines of Kings,</p>
<p>Natya Shastra 34.26-29 I shall now describe the classes and function of women who live in the harem and have dealings with the king. They are the chief queen (maha-devi), other queens (devi), his high born wives (sramini), ordinary wives (sthayini), concubines (bhogini) craft women (silpakarini), acresses (natakiya), dancers (nartaki), maids in constant attenance (ancarika), maids of special work (paricarka), maids in constant movement (sancarika), maids for running errands (presana-carika), Mahattaris (matron), old dames (sthavira). Ayuktikas and (overseer), Pratiharis (usher), maidens (kumari).</p>
<p>Natya Shastra 34.40 Concubines (bhogini) to a king are known as well-behaved, gentle [in manners], not very hanghty, and they are indifferent [to rivals], modest, affectionate but not held in high honor.</p>
<p>It’s mentioned in Narada Purana,</p>
<p>Narada Purana 35.43 “A son born of a virgin girl is called ‘Kanina’, and that born of pregnant before marriage is called ‘Sahodhaka’. One purchased by price is called ‘Krita’, ‘Punarbhava’ is two-fold.” Tr. Anand Swarup Gupta</p>
<p>Maharshi Manu on types of Slaves,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 8.415 ”A captive of war, a slave for maintenance, the son of a female slave, one purchased for money, a slave obtained as a present, a hereditary one, and one condemned to slavery for any offence, these are the seven kinds of slave (lit., sources of slavery)” Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Female slaves can’t perform the rites of a wife,</p>
<p>Baudhyana Dharma Sutra, Prasna 1, Adhyaya 11, Kandika 21 Now they quote also (the following verse): ‘It is declared that a female who has been purchased for money is not a wife. She cannot (assist) at sacrifices offered to the gods or the manes. Kasyapa has stated that she is a slave.</p>
<p>What does that mean? It means a female slave can do other works of a wife (like carnal pleasure) but not the sacrificial rites of the wife.</p>
<p><a href="#top">top</a></p>
<h2><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Bride selling</span></h2>
<p>Leave aside this purchasing of female slaves, Hinduism even brings a kind of marriage into slavery. As we know there are many forms of marriage in Hinduism, one of them is Manusha rite commonly known as Asura form of marriage. Vasistha explains it as,</p>
<p>Vasistha Dharma Shastra 1.35-36 “If, after making a bargain (with the father, a suitor) <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">marries (a damsel) purchased for money, that (is called) the Manusha-rite</span>. The purchase (of a wife) is mentioned in the following passage of the Veda, ‘Therefore one hundred (cows) besides a chariot should be given to the father of the bride.” Tr. Georg Buhler</p>
<p>Gautama Dharma Shastra 4.11-15 “If those who have (authority over) a female are propitiated by money, (that is) an Asura wedding&#8230;The first four (rites) are lawful; Some say, (the first) six.” Tr. George Buhler</p>
<p>Baudhayana Dharma Shastra Prasna I, Adhyaya 11, Kandika 20 (I, II, 20), Verses 7-8 &#8220;(If the bridegroom receives the maiden) after gladdening (the parents) by money, (that is) the rite of the Asuras (asura). (If the maiden is wedded) after being forcibly abducted, (that is) the rite of the Rakshasas (rakshasa). [12] <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Among these the sixth and the seventh agree with the law of Kshatriyas</span>. For power is their attribute.&#8221; Tr. George Buhler</p>
<p>Baudhayana permits Asura (Manusha) form of marriage for Kshatriya whereas Manu Smriti prohibits it for Kshatriya and permits them for Vaishyas and Shudras and in some cases for Brahmanas also.</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 3.20-24 “Now listen to (the) brief (description of) the following eight marriage-rites used by the four castes (varna) which partly secure benefits and partly produce evil both in this life and after death. (They are) the rite of Brahman (Brahma), that of the gods (Daiva), that of the Rishis (Arsha), that of Pragapati (Pragapatya), that of the Asuras (Asura), that of the Gandharvas (Gandharva), that of the Rhashasas (Rakshasa), and that of the Pisakas (Paisaka). Which is lawful for each caste (varna) and which are the virtues or faults of each (rite), all this I will declare to you, as well as their good and evil results with respect to the offspring. One may know that the first six according to the order (followed above) are lawful for a Brahmana, the four last for a Kshatriya, and the same four, excepting the Rakshasa rite, for a Vaisya and a Sudra. The sages state that the first four are approved (in the case) of a Brahmana, one, the Rakshasa (rite in the case) of a Kshatriya, and the Asura (marriage in that) of a Vaisya and of a Sudra.” Tr. George Buhler</p>
<p>One may get confused when one reads 25<sup>th</sup> verse of this chapter, but according to Medhatithi that law is laid down only for the Kshatriyas. He also states that several forms of marriage are permitted but specific forms are superior. In case one is not able to find a bride to perform marriage in the superior form then he may recourse to other options or forms of marriage. He also states that Asura marriage which is a purchase of the bride for money from the father of the bride is specifically allowed for the Vaishya and Shudra castes and also allowed for Brahmana as an option. It is also mentioned in Narada Purana 26.15-18 that on failing to get a bride in acceptable forms of marriage a Brahmana may adopt any of the eight forms of marriage.</p>
<p><strong>Acharya Medhatithi writes on Manu Smriti 3.24-25</strong>, &#8220;&#8230;For the Vaishya and the Shudra, it is the &#8216;Asura&#8217; alone. Among those that have been sanctioned (before) and prohibited now, there is to be option; so that one may have recourse to the optional forms only when those that have been sanctioned absolutely in all cases are not possible&#8230;[25] The law laid down in this verse pertains to the Ksattriya and the rest, not to the Brahmana&#8230;The conclusion on this point is as follows :- For the Brahmana there are six forms of marriage; of these the &#8216;Brahma&#8217; is the best of all; inferior to that are the &#8216;Daira&#8217; and the &#8216;Prajapatya;&#8217; inferior to these is the Arsa, then the &#8216;Gandharva,&#8217; then the Asura&#8230;As regards the &#8216;Asura&#8217; form, since it has been specifically prescribed for the Vaishya and the Shudra, it implies the exclusion of the Brahmana and the Ksattriya from it. And yet we have the distinct injunction of six forms as permitted for the Brahmana (in 23 above). From all which it follows that there is option; but it is an option with the restriction that one is to recourse to the second option only in the event of the first option being impossible&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Ganganath Jha</p>
<p>Garuda Purana permits Asura marriage for the Vaishyas,</p>
<p>Garuda Purana I.95.10-11 &#8220;In the Asura form of marriage, money is taken&#8230;The first four types of marriage are recommended for brahmins; the Gandharva and the Raksasa type for kings; the Asura type for vaisyas and the despicable last type for the sudras.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti 24.24 and Asvalayana Grihya Sutra 1.6.6 also mentions Asura marriage. Bhishma also talks about prevalence of these forms of marriages,</p>
<p>Mahabharata Adi Parva 1, Section 116, Verses 8-10 &#8220;Bhishma said:- The wise have said that after inviting an accomplished man, a maiden may be bestowed on him decked with ornaments and accompanied with valuable presents as much as lie in the power of the bestower to give. Others may bestow their daughters by accepting a couple of kine. Some again may bestow their daughters by taking a fixed sum, and some again take away maidens by force. Some marry with the consent of the maidens and some by dragging them into consent&#8230;&#8221; Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Skanda Purana also states that Asura form of marriage was prevalent among Kshatriyas and Vaishyas,</p>
<p>Skanda Purana IV.i.38.7 &#8220;Generally speaking, the marriages of the types of Gandharva, Asura and Raksasa are in vogue among Ksatriyas and Vaisyas&#8230;&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>This will be an eye opener for some Hindus, because those poor Hindu used to say Marriage in Hinduism is a very spiritualistic matter and very unique compared to other religions. Is that the ‘Uniqueness’ they talk about? Purchasing a wife like a one purchases a commodity.</p>

<h2><span style="font-size: 16pt;">LGBT</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">LGBT stands for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">,</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> and Transgender. To be precise Hinduism sanctions Transgenderism and Lesbianism. Many gods committed transgenderism. Which has compelled Hindu scholars to accept LGBT. The most famous story about LGBT in Hinduism is that of Shiva and Vishnu. Here is a verse from Skanda Purana which is addressed to Shiva,</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">SHIVA AND VISHNU</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Skanda Purana I.iii(U).20.32-33 ”Be victorious, O Lord, whose head is adorned with Ganga and the crescent moon, O Lord, who have fascinated the minds of the wives of all sages by means of your handsome features. Be victorious, O Lord, who are possessed of the glory of the god of Love due to the close contact of the daughter of the Mountain. Be victorious, O Lord, </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000; font-size: 12pt;">who are an expert in the repetition of the (sexual) play over the body of Naranaya</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> adopted by means of Maya (?).” Tr. G.V. Tagare</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Narayana and Hari are the synonyms of Vishnu, Hara, Sankara, Shambhu are synonyms of Shiva’s name. This verse shows that Shiva had sex with Vishnu. As per story mentioned in Srimad Bhagavatam, Vishnu assumed the form of a beautiful woman, This form of Vishnu is known as Mohini. He assumed this form to lure and defeat the demons. Later on Shiva requested Vishnu to assume the form which is pleasing to the lusty people, Shiva wanted to see his Mohini form. Thus requested by Shiva, Vishnu assumed the form of Mohini. Shiva despite knowing that it was Vishnu just couldn’t resist his desire and followed Vishnu in front of his wife and even discharged semen out of desire. Both Mohini and Shiva were naked and Shiva forcefully embraced Vishnu (Mohini).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Agni Purana 3.17-20 He [Vishnu] was then requested by Hara to show (this form) unto him. The Divine Hari then displayed his female form unto Rudra. Overpowered by his (Vishnu’s) illusory power, </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-size: 12pt;">Shambhu, renouncing Gouri</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">, longed for that damsel. </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-size: 12pt;">He became naked and looked like a maniac</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">. He held the woman by the hair and she, releasing her hairs, ran away. He too followed her. </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-size: 12pt;">Wherever dropped Hara’s seminal fluid</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> there sprang up fields of his phallic emblem and gold.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The story mentioned in Srimad Bhagavatam will briefly explain this,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Srimad Bhagavatam 8.12.15-16 ”The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: When the demons took away the jug of nectar, I assumed the form of a beautiful woman to bewilder them by directly cheating them and thus to act in the interest of the demigods. O best of the demigods, </span><span style="color: #ff0000; font-size: 12pt;">I shall now show you My form that is very much appreciated by those who are lusty</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">. Since you want to see that form, I shall reveal it in your presence. [19] Because the ball was falling down and bouncing up, as She played with it Her breasts trembled, and because of the weight of those breasts and Her heavy flower garlands, Her waist appeared to be all but breaking at every step, as Her two soft feet, which were reddish like coral, moved here and there. [21] As She played with the ball, the sari covering Her body became loose, and Her hair scattered. She tried to bind Her hair with Her beautiful left hand, and at the same time She played with the ball by striking it with Her right hand. This was so attractive that the Supreme Lord [Vishnu], by His internal potency, in this way captivated everyone. [24-26] Thus Lord Śiva saw the woman, every part of whose body was beautifully formed, and the beautiful woman also looked at him. Therefore, thinking that She was attracted to him, Lord Śiva became very much attracted to Her. Lord Śiva, his good sense taken away by the woman because of lusty desires to enjoy with Her</span><span style="color: #ff0000; font-size: 12pt;">, became so mad for Her that even in the presence of Bhavānī [Shiva’s wife] he did not hesitate to approach Her</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">. The beautiful woman was already naked, and when She saw Lord Śiva coming toward Her, She became extremely bashful. Thus She kept smiling, but She hid Herself among the trees and did not stand in one place. [28-32] After following Her with great speed, Lord Śiva caught Her by the braid of Her hair and dragged Her near him. Although She was unwilling, he embraced Her with his arms. Being embraced by Lord Śiva like a female elephant embraced by a male, the woman, whose hair was scattered, swirled like a snake. O King, this woman, who had large, high hips, was a woman of yoga-māyā presented by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. She released Herself somehow or other from the fond embrace of Lord Śiva’s arms and ran away. As if harassed by an enemy in the form of lusty desires, Lord Śiva followed the path of Lord Viṣṇu, who acts very wonderfully and who had taken the form of Mohinī. Just as a maddened bull elephant follows a female elephant who is able to </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">conceive pregnancy, Lord Śiva followed the beautiful woman and discharged semen, even though his discharge of semen never goes in vain.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">As per Brahmanda Purana a son was born to Shiva-Vishnu known as Shasta.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Brahmanda Purana Lalita Mihatmya 6.7-9 “The second form appeared when the churning for the sake of Nectar was being carried out. That form fascinated Sarva (Siva). It cannot be comprehended by the mind or expressed through words. On seeing it, even isa (god Siva) became charmed and enchanted although he is omniscient. When prohibited by her, he left off Parvati all of a sudden and he indulged in sexual intercourse with her (i.e. Mohini). He begot of her (the son) Sasta, the supressor of Asuras.” Tr. G.V. Tagare </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Shasta is popularly known as </span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayyappan" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right"><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #0000ff; font-size: 12pt;">Ayyappa</span><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> in south India. He is also known by the name Hari-Hara. As he was born from Hari (Vishnu) and Hara (Shiva).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Apologists try to give lame explanation for this homosexual act, they say that Shiva did not have sex (read rape) with Vishnu but with Mohini who was a woman. For the sake of the argument even if I accept this to be true then does that mean it is permissible to have sex with a transgender? As Vishnu transforme</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">d himself into a woman and in this </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">modern </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">age</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> it’s possible for a man to become woman after going through some surgeries. Moreover this is not a avatar of Vishnu its just his form, when you search the meaning of Avatar on Google you will find the following meaning </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">”</span><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-size: 12pt;">a manifestation of a deity or released soul in </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000; font-size: 12pt;">bodily form on earth</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">; an incarnate divine teacher” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Some examples are Krishna and Ram, the two avatars of Vishnu who had taken birth on the earth through human parents. But unlike these two Mohini didn’t took birth on earth. Gods like Shiva assumed forms of beggar and other people to carry on their so called test on people, so Hindus don’t say ”so and so beggar tested those people” but they say “Shiva assumed the form to test them” similarly Mohini was Vishnu itself this is why some Hindu </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">scholars permits homosexuality on the basis that Shiva and Vishnu were engaged in this act,</span><br />

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">SHIVA AND AGNI</span></strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2466" height="2129" class="wp-image-8862 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Shiva-agni-homosexuality.jpeg" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Shiva-agni-homosexuality.jpeg 2466w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Shiva-agni-homosexuality-300x259.jpeg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Shiva-agni-homosexuality-768x663.jpeg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Shiva-agni-homosexuality-1536x1326.jpeg 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Shiva-agni-homosexuality-2048x1768.jpeg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2466px) 100vw, 2466px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">There is one more story of LGBT of Shiva. Where Shiva ejaculated his semen into the mouth of the fire god Agn</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">i, after Agni interrupted his </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">sexual dalliance</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> of Shiva with his wife</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">. The context of this story is that all the gods were frightened by a demon named Taraka who was causing trouble on earth, no god could defeat him except Shiva. But Shiva was engaged in sexual intercourse with his wife for a very long time. All the gods waited for it to finish, but Shiva did not stop that. So at last the gods sent Agni to summon Shiva to kill the demon </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Taraka. Agni went to the palace after assuming the form of a bird and interrupted their intercourse. Shiva in anger ejaculated the semen in Agni’s mouth,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Brahma Purana, Gautami-Mahatmya 58.16-24 ”At the instance of Devas the fire-god assumed the form of a parrot and went to the place where the lord of the worlds was sporting with Uma…The lord of Devas called the fire-god moving about in front of him, in the form of a bird and said, ”O Agni, you have been recognised through various ways. Do not speak anything. Open your mouth. Take this in and carry it with you.” After saying this </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000; font-size: 12pt;">lord Sambhu discharged a great deal of semen into the mouth of fire-god</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">. With this semen within him Agni could not at all go. Utterly tired, Agni sat down on the bank of Ganga. He then discharged a greater portion </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000; font-size: 12pt;">of that semen into Krttikas wherefrom Karttika was born</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">. </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000; font-size: 12pt;">The remaining portion of the semen of Sambhu that had been within his body, Agni split into two and deposited into his beloved wife Svaha</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> who was particularly eager to have a child.” Tr. Board of Scholars, Edited by J.L. Shastri </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">This is also mentioned in Mahabharata 9.44.6-11 with a slight variation. Kartikkeya is considered the son of Shiva and Agni as per Vamana Purana as the semen was swallowed by Agni,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Vamana Purana 31.26-28 “O Brahman, in the meantime Brahman said to Agni ‘How old and grown up is your son, Guha now’? Hearing his words, and not knowing his son, Agni said to Brahman, I do not know who is Guha,’ Being pleased, the Lord said, ‘You drank the semen of Sankara in the past, so a child, the lord of the three worlds has been born in the thickest of reeds.” Tr. Anand Swarup Gupta</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">As per another version, the sages’ wives who were bathing in the river were also impregnated as Agni had deposited a portion of the semen in the river.

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">KRISHNA AND ARJUNA</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">According to Tamil versions of the Mahabharata, the god Krishna – an incarnation of Vishnu – also took the form of Mohini and married Aravan. This was in order to give Aravan the chance to experience love before his death, as he had volunteered to be sacrificed. Krishna remained in mourning in the Mohini form for some time after Aravan’s death. This marriage and death of Aravan are commemorated annually in a rite known as Thali, during which Hijra (Indian “third gender”) take on the role of Krishna-Mohini and “marry” Aravan in a mass-wedding, followed by an 18-day festival. The festival ends with a ritual burial of Aravan, while the Hirjas mourn in Tamil style: by beating their chests in ritual dances, breaking their bangles and changing into white mourning clothes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">According to Padma Purana Krishna is said to have </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">been in a </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">relationship with Arjuna. Arjuna was desirous of knowing the secrets of Vrindavan or the Ras Leela you can say. So he prayed to a goddess named Tripura who fu</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">lfilled his</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> desire by turning Arjuna into a woman</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">. Arjuna became a woman after he </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">dipped into a lake. This form of Arjun has been called as Arjuni and Arjuniya in the Padma Purana. Arjuni went to Krishna who then had sex with Arjuna,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Padma Purana Patalakhanda 5, Chapter 74, Verses 61-74a “Then having heard the words, when Arjuna plunged into the water of the lake…The charmingly smiling one got up and on seeing around, was confused. He instantly saw himself (to be turned into) a wonderful, excellent lady, who had a slim, fair, charming body like the rays of pure gold…” Tr. N.A Deshpande</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Padma Purana Patalakhanda 5, Chapter 74, Verses 177b-196a “…Arjuniya, having seen in confusion on the left side of the pleasing goddess Radhika, propitiating and offering a tambula to him of a bright smile, was overcome with the passion of love. </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000; font-size: 12pt;">Then, Srikrsna, who knew everything, knowing her to be like that, seized her hand, and he the lord, the great master of magical art secretly sported with her in the entire pleasure-forest</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">. Then putting his sport-like arm on her should and coming to Sarada, said to her: ‘Bathe quickly this slim-bodied lady of a gentle smile, fatigued due to sport, in this western lake.’ Then that goddess Sarada (took her) to the western lake, (and) said to her, ‘Take bath’. The fatigued one did like that. </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000; font-size: 12pt;">She who got to the interior of the water, again turned into Arjuna</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> and got up at the place where the lord of gods and the chief of the beautiful Vaikuntha stood. Seeing Arjuna dejected and broken-minded, Krsna kindly touched him with his hand and put him (back) to his nature.” Tr. N.A Deshpande </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Arjuna the biggest devotee of Krishna is said to have transformed himself into a eunuch,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Mahabharata 4.45.13-14 “</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">…Indeed, thou seemest to me to be Mahadeva, or Indra, or the chief of the Gandharvas, dwelling in the guise only of one of the third sex.’ “Arjuna said, ‘I tell thee truly that I am only observing this vow for a whole year agreeable to the behest of my elder brother. O thou of mighty arms, I am not truly one of the neuter sex, but I have adopted this vow of eunuchism from subservience to another’s will and from desire of religious merit. O prince, know me now to have completed my vow…” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">KRISHNA AND NARADA</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Krishna also had sex with Narada Muni in the same way,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Padma Purana, Patalakhanda 5, Chapter 75, Verses 24b-32a “Narada said: This is a great secret, the secret of secrets. Formerly Brahma told me that secret about Vrndavana (when I had said to him): ‘O lord of gods, O father, tell me the secret of Vrndavana.’ Hearing this desire (of mine), he remained silent for a moment. Then he said to me: ‘O child, go to Maha (i.e. great) Visnu, my lord. Undoubtedly I must also go there with you.’ Saying so, and taking me (with him) he went to the abode of Visnu. He told Maha Visnu what I had said to him. Hearing that Maha Visnu himself ordered the self-born one (i.e. Brahma). ‘By my order, you take the sage Narada, and arrange for his bath in the lake called Amrta.’ Having entered the Amrta lake, I took bath there. Just at that moment I was (i.e. I found myself) near women, beyond (i.e. on the other side of) the lake (I was) turned into a woman, endowed with all (good) charachteristics…” Tr. N.A. Deshpande</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Padma Purana, Patalakhanda 5, Chapter 75, Verses 39B-53 “With them, (we) went where the eternal Krsna remained. The lord, who was merely of the form of the Good, the Intelligence and the Joy, and o that of a woman, and whose heart was delighted due to the women, again and again said to me: ‘Come along O dear one, O beloved, embrace me devoutly.’ O you best brahmana, </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000; font-size: 12pt;">there only he enjoyed (with me) for a year</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">. Then that best lover said to that goddess Radhika: ‘This was my natural form there, which had taken the form of Narada. Take her to the Amrta lake, and arrange for her bath.’…After that goddess Radhika took me to the lake, waited there, and went (back) near the feet of the Moon in the form of Krsna. </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000; font-size: 12pt;">Then immediately after plunging (into the lake) I came (back) as Narada</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">…” Tr. N.A. Deshpande </span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">NARADA AND KING TALADHVAJA</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Sage Narada had </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">a </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">relationship with a King named Taladhvaja as per the version available in Srimad Devi Bhagavatam,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Srimad Devi Bhagavatam Book 6, Chapter 28, Verses 37-54 “…O Nârada! Look! Look! How clear crystal-like is the water of this pool like the heart of a saint; see how it smells also fragrantly in contact with the lotuses on it.” When the Bhagavân spoke thus to me; I kept my lute and deer skin aside and gladly went to the edge of the tank. Washing then my hands and feet I tied my hair lock and, taking Kus’a grass, I performed my Âchaman and, purifying myself, began to bathe myself in that tank. While I was bathing, Hari was looking at me; by the time I took a dip, I saw that I quitted my male form and got a beautiful female form. Hari took away, then, my deer skin and lute and mounting on Garuda went away in a moment to His own residence. Getting the female form and decorated with excellent ornaments, my memory of my previous male form vanished at once; I forgot all about my famous lute and forgot also Jagannâtha, the Deva of the Devas. </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000; font-size: 12pt;">I then came out of the tank in that enchanting woman form</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">, saw the pool of water filled with clear limpid water and adorned with lotuses. Seeing that, I began to think :– “What is this?” and I became very much </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">astonished. While I was thus meditating in my woman form, a king, named Tâladhvaja, came there, all on a sudden, on a chariot, accompanied by numerous elephants and horses. The King looked like a second Cupid…” Tr. Swami Vijnananda</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Srimad Devi Bhagavatam Book 6, Chapter 29, Verses 13-20. “</span><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-size: 12pt;">The King then began to sport with me amorously according to the rules of the Kâma S’âstra in various ways and with great enjoyments and pleasures</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">. He then left all his kingly duties and state affairs and he began to remain day and night with me deeply immersed in amorous sports; so much his mind was merged in me in these plays that he could not notice the long time that passed away in the interval. He used to drink the Vâru</span><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-size: 12pt;">n</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">î wine and, forsaking all the state affairs, began to enjoy me in nice gardens, beautiful lakes, lovely palaces, beautified houses, excellent mountains and enviable forests and became completely subservient to me. O Dvaipâyana! Being incessantly engaged with the King in amorous sports and remaining obedient to him, my previous body, male ideas, or the birth of Muni, nothing whatsoever came in my memory. I remained always attached to him…” Tr. Swami Vijnananda</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Srimad Devi Bhagavatam Book 6, Chapter 30, Verses 1-14. Nârada said :– O Best of Munis! The King was greatly astonished to see me dip in the tank in a female figure and get up from the tank in a male figure and thought, “Where is my dearest wife? And how is this Nârada Muni suddenly come here!” The King, not seeing his wife, lamented very much and cried frequently, “O my dear Wife! Where have you gone, leaving me here thus. Without you, O One of spacious hips! My life, palace and kingdom, all, are quite useless…” Tr. Swami Vijnananda</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">BUDHA (SON OF SOMA) AND KING</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Another form of LGBT is also found in Srimad Bhagavatam. Some sages went to the abode of Shiva but as soon as they spotted Shiva and Parvati engaged in sexual intercourse they immediately went away. To please Parvati, Shiva said that anyone coming near his area shall become a woman. A king accident</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">al</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">ly stepped into that area and became a woman, later (s)he had sex with the son of moon god Soma named Budha,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Vayu Purana, Part 2.23.15-18 …He who is revered in the three worlds is famous as Sudyumna. He has attained the form of a lady. That noble lady returned to her father after securing the boon. After getting an opportunate moment, she was invited for love making (sexual intercourse) by Budha (the planet mercury). From Budha, the son of Soma, Puruavas, the son of Ila was born. After giving birth to the son born of Budha, she became Suyumna again. Sudyumna had three sons, all extremely virtuous” Tr. G.V. Tagare</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Srimad Bhagavatam 9.1.30-35 ”When the goddess Ambikā saw the great saintly persons, she was very much ashamed because at that time she was naked. She immediately got up from the lap of her husband and tried to cover her breast. Seeing Lord Śiva and Pārvatī engaged in sexual affairs, all the great saintly persons immediately desisted from going further and departed for the āśrama of Nara-Nārāyaṇa. Thereupon, just to please his wife, Lord Śiva said, “Any male entering this place shall immediately become a female!” Since that </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">time, no male had entered that forest. But now King Sudyumna, having been transformed into a female, began to walk with his associates from one forest to another. </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000; font-size: 12pt;">Sudyumna had been transformed into the best of beautiful women who excite sexual desire</span> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">and was surrounded by other women. Upon seeing this beautiful woman loitering near his āśrama, </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000; font-size: 12pt;">Budha, the son of the moon, immediately desired to enjoy her</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">. </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000; font-size: 12pt;">The beautiful woman also desired to accept Budha</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">, the son of the king of the moon, as her husband. </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000; font-size: 12pt;">Thus Budha begot in her womb a son named Purūravā</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">This is also mentioned in Matsya Purana 11.50 and Brahmanda Purana 2.3.60.15-17. </span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">MITRA AND VARUNA</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Shatapatha Brahmana also promotes Homosexuality, it is about the homosexual act of the Vedic gods Mitra-Varuna,</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><br />

<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">There’s a story of King Dilipa</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> the ancestor of Rama</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> in a Bengali Ramayana called Krittvasa Ramayana. In this Ramayana it is stated that King Dilip died without having any son. His kingdom had become kingless, the gods were worried so Shiva ordered King Dilipa’s two wives to have sex with each other like a man. One of the wife conceived a son who was later known as Bhagiratha. There are two versions in the Krittvasa Ramayana, I am mentioning only one, the second version names the two queens as Chandra and Mala.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Krittvasa Ramayana, Adi Kanda “Dilipa ruled like Indra, the king of the gods, but was sad as he did not have a son. Leaving behind his two wives in the city of Ayodhya, Dilipa went in search of the Ganga….On his death the city of Ayodhya was kingless…Riding his bull, Shiva went to Dilipa’s two queens and said to them: ‘By my blessings, one of you will have a son.’ Hearing Shiva’s words, the two women said: ‘We are widows, how can we have a child?’ Shankara replied: ‘You two have intercourse with one another. By my blessings one of you will have a lovely child.’ Having bestowed this boon, the god who destroys the three worlds went his way. The two wives of Dilipa took bath. They lived together in extreme love. After days, one of them menstruated. Both of them knew one another’s intentions and enjoyed love play, and one of them conceived….” Tr. Kumkum Roy</span><br />

<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">There is another version mentioned in </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">the </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Bengali version of Padma Purana,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Padma Purana, Svarga Khanda 16.6-24 “King Dilipa had no son, and after a long time, he died. His two wives were constantly sad. They went to the hermitage of the sage Vasistha and said to him, ‘The dynastic line descended from King Sagara has been broken, and the kingdom has been attacked by enemies. Tell us what to do.’ When he heard this, the great sage thought deeply about the matter, and when he had made his decision he said to the two queens, ‘This human dynasty will not be terminated. A noble son will be born to the two of you, fine ladies with beautiful eyes. I will make a supreme effort on your behalf.’ When he had said this, Vasistha cooked up a consecrated pot of rice and milk (caru) that was infused with all good qualities, using the proper ritual for one who wished to have a son. Then he said to the two noble women, ‘One of you must eat this consecrated pot of rice and milk, and the other must have intercourse with her in the manner of a man.’ When the women heard this, they did what the great sage had told them to do. The eldest queen became pregnant, and after the usual time brought forth a son. But since the boy had been born without any semen of a man, he was born without any bones, and was just like a ball (pinda) of flesh. The two queens named him Bhaghiratha…” Tr.

<h2><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Niyoga</span></h2>
<p>Niyog Pratga is the Vedic practice where the childless or sonless widow sleeps with another man and conceives the child, but the child would be considered the son of the deceased father and not his biological father. The Brother of the deceased person is preferred to contract Niyog with the widow after that close relatives were given preferences. Niyoga is sanctioned by Hindu scriptures. Swami Vivekananda writes about Niyoga,</p>
<p>“…Another cause was instrumental in bringing this about — the change in the system of marriage. The earliest system was a matriarchal one; that is, one in which the mother was the centre, and in which the girls acceded to her station. This led to the curious system of the Polianders [polyandrous], where five and six brothers often married one wife. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Even the Vedas contain a trace of it in the provision, that when a man died without leaving any children, his widow was permitted to live with another man, until she became a mother; but the children she bore did not belong to their father, but to her dead husband</span>…” By Swami Vivekananda, Ideals of Womanhood,(<em>BrooklynStandard Union</em>, January 21,1895) <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Complete_Works_of_Swami_Vivekananda/Volume_2/Reports_in_American_Newspapers/Ideals_of_Womanhood" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Complete_Works_of_Swami_Vivekananda/Volume_2/Reports_in_American_Newspapers/Ideals_of_Womanhood<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>It is mentioned in Shastras,</p>
<p>Gautama Dharma Shastra 18.4-6 “A woman whose husband is dead and who desires offspring (may bear a son) to her brother-in-law… (On failure of a brother-in-law she may obtain offspring) by (cohabiting with) a Sapinda, a Sagotra, a Samanapravara, or one who belongs to the same caste.” Tr. Georg Buhler</p>
<p>Baudhyana Dharma Shastra Prasna II, Adhyaya 2, Kandika 4, verses 7-9 “widow shall avoid during a year (the use of) honey, meat spirituous liquor, and salt, and sleep on the ground. Maudgalya (declares that she shall do so) during six months. After (the expiration of) that (time) she may, with the permission of her Gurus, bear a son to her brother in law, in case she has no son.” Tr. Georg Buhler</p>
<p>It is mentioned in Puranas,</p>
<p>Garuda Purana chapter 95 ”The younger brother of a husband, may go unto a childless wife of his elder brother for the purpose of begetting an offspring on her person with the permission of his elders, first had and obtained in that behalf, and with his body annointed with clarified butter.” Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Another version of this Purana translated by J.L. Shastri is given below,</p>
<p>Garuda Purana I.95.16-17 “For producing a son and a heir in the family the brother-in-law or a cousin or a person of the same clan can have intercourse with an issueless widow till she conceives. If he touches her after that he becomes degraded. The son born thus is the legitimate son of the deceased husband.” Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Kurma Purana 2.22.98 ”…a son born of the Niyoga rite should perform Sraddha to his progenitor as well as the dead husband of his mother. Then he shall be the true heir. If a son is born out of the semen virile without the sanction of Niyoga, the son should offer Pindas to the progenitor. However, he may perform Sraddha to the Ksetrin (mother’s husbands).” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>It is mentioned in Vishnu Smriti,</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti 15.1-3 Now there are twelve kinds of sons. The first is the son of the body, viz. he who is begotten (by the husband) himself on his own lawfully wedded wife. The second is the son begotten on a wife, viz. one begotten by a kinsman allied by funeral oblations, or by a member of the highest caste, on an appointed (wife or widow).</p>
<p>It is mentioned in Yajnavalkya Smriti,</p>
<p>Yajnavalkya Smriti, Book 1 Achara Adhyaya, chapter 3, verse 68 ”The younger brother of the husband, a Sapinda or a Sagotra, being anointed with clarified butter, and with the permission of the Guru, may go to a sonless widows, when in season, with the desire of raising a son.” Tr. R.B.S. Chandra Vidyarnava</p>
<p>Maharshi Manu writes,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 9.190 “Let the widow of a deceased, sonless man get a son procreated on her person by a man of her husband’s Gotra (i.e., his younger brother, or a Sapinda relation), and let the entire estate of that deceased person be invested in that son.” Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Vasistha Dharma Shastra 17.56 “After the completion of six months she shall bathe, and offer a funeral oblation to her husband. (Then) her father or her brother shall assemble the Gurus who taught or sacrificed (for the deceased) and his relatives, and shall appoint her (to raise issue to her deceased husband)…Let him approach (the widow) in the muhuarta sacred to Pragapati (behaving) like a husband, without (amorously) dallying with her, and without abusing or ill-treating her.”</p>
<p>Katyayana Smriti verse 859 “When a person begets a fruit (a son) with the consent of the owner of the field (husband of the wife), both of them are entitled to the fruit (the son), since a fruit is not produced in the absence of one (of the two).” Tr. P.V. Kane</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 9.59 ”In the absence of a son, a woman wishing to obtain a progeny, shall lie down under an appointment, with a younger brother, or with a Sapinda relation, of her husband for the procreation of a son.” Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 3.173 ”He, who, otherwise than under an appointment of begetting a son on her, visits the widow of his deceased elder brother, out of passion, is called the husband of a deceased elder brother’s widow.” Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Niyoga in Manu is obscure. There are a couple of stories that prove Niyoga existed in the Vedic period, Niyoga was perhaps also used to satisfy the desire which is evident from the story of Muni Vyasa and maidservant. Sage Vasistha the common son of Mitra-Varuna had contracted Niyoga with the wife of a King,</p>
<p>Mahabharata 1.179.33-47 ”…O best of Brahmanas, I desire to obtain from thee that by which, O foremost of all that are conversant with the Vedas, I may be freed from the debt I owe to the race of Ikshvaku! O best of men, <span style="color: #ff0000;">it behoveth thee to grant me, for the perpetuation of Ikshvaku’s race, a desirable son</span> possessing beauty and accomplishments and good behaviour.’ “The Gandharva continued, ‘Thus addressed, Vasishtha, that best of Brahmanas devoted to truth replied unto that mighty bowman of a monarch, saying, <span style="color: #ff0000;">‘I will give you</span>…After the royal sage had entered his capital, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">the queen, at the king’s command, approached Vasishtha. The great Rishi, making a covenant with her, united himself with her according to the high ordinance</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">And after a little while, when the queen conceived</span>, that best of Rishis, receiving the reverential salutations of the king, went back to his asylum. The queen bore the embryo in her womb for a long time. When she saw that she did not bring forth anything, she tore open her womb by a piece of stone. It was then that at the twelfth year (of the conception) was born Asmaka, that bull amongst men, that royal sage who founded (the city of) Paudanya.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>This story is also mentioned in Srimad Bhagavatam 9.9 and Narada Purana,</p>
<p>Narada Purana, Uttarabhaga 28.32 “O Brahmana, the activities of the Lord are beyond human scrutiny though he abides by the favourably Dharma. Vyasa the son of Parasara, is himself the classifier of the Vedas. He was a man of truthful vision. His very form is worthy of being worshipped. (But) he was born of the semen virile of one who destroyed the virginity (of a woman). Hence he is called a Kanina (son of an unmarried girl). Moreover, he had sexual intercourse with the wives of his younger brothers.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Satyavati requested Vyasa who was born of her from Parasara, to have sons from the queens of his younger brother Vicitravirya as mentioned in Mahabharata Adi Parva section 104 &amp; 105</p>
<p>This king was cursed thus he couldn’t impregnate his wife and requested Vasistha to impregnate her. But why did Vasistha do that when he could have just discharged semen in a pot and given birth to a son just like he was born or else he could have used his mystic power to remove the curse. Another sage named Dirghatama had done a similar act with the wife of King Bali named Sudeshana but the King wasn’t cursed,</p>
<p>Mahabharata 1.104.37-47 ”The virtuous Vali, ever devoted to truth, then learning who the man was that was thus saved by him, <span style="color: #ff0000;">chose him for raising up offspring</span>. And Vali said, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">‘O illustrious one, it behoveth thee to raise upon my wife a few sons</span> that shall be virtuous and wise.’ Thus addressed, the <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Rishi endued with great energy, expressed his willingness</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. Thereupon king Vali sent his wife Sudeshna unto him</span>. But the queen knowing that the latter was blind and old went not unto him, she sent unto him her nurse. And upon that Sudra woman the virtuous Rishi of passions under full control begat eleven children of whom Kakshivat was the eldest…Thy unfortunate queen Sudeshna, seeing me blind and old, insulted me by not coming herself but sending unto me, instead, her nurse.’ The king then pacified that best of Rishis and sent unto him his queen Sudeshna. The Rishi by merely touching her person said to her, ‘Thou shalt have five children…” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Let me show you the ugly side of this Rishi Dirghatama,</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 48.67-76 ”After that, King Bali appeased that sage and was furious with his wife; and sent her again well-dressed, after her toilet, to the sage, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">when the seer said. ”O. Devi! Cast off your bashfulness and then lick the whole of my body with your tongue</span>, after rubbing it with salt, curds and honey; you will then attain your wish and get sons.” The queen followed the directions of the seer, but omitted to lick the hind private parts. When the sage said; ”O, blessed one! Your eldest son will be without that part of the body which you have omitted to lick.” The queen said:- ”Sire! It is not worthy of you to bless me with such an offspring. Be pleased at my devotion and show your mercy to me.” Dirghatama said:- ”O, Blessed one, through your fault this will happen exactly as I have told you and this son of yours will not delight you in any way, but your grandson will; he will, however, not feel the necessity of the missing part of his body.” Then the sage, touching her abdomen, said, ”<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">O, queen because you have licked all parts of my body </span>except the privates, your sons will be like the full moon, and, in all you will be blessed with five sons of Divine beauty who will be most illustrious, renowned, righteous and performers of sacrifices.” Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, Edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>Why does the Rishi need to do this shameless act? We read in scriptures that gods and sages possess mystic power and are capable to do anything. Even if the king is impotent or infertile then why doesn’t he use the spells mentioned in the Vedas for fertility? If the Virility spells in the Vedas are useless then why keep them in the Vedas just tear them and throw them away. Why corrupt the society with such vulgar Vedic Hindu practices?</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Brahma had gone to sage Santanu’s house, however</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">,</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> Santanu was not present at that time and Brahma was welcomed by Santanu’s wife Amogha, seeing the beautiful wife of sage Santanu, Brahma ejaculated on </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">their </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">seat and left the house. When sage Santanu came to of all this, instead of becoming furious, he asked his wife Amogha to drink Brahma’s semen in order to conceive a son, as commanded by her husband, Amogha d</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">rank the semen and was impregnated</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Padma Purana Section 1 Sṛṣṭi-khaṇḍa, Chapter 55, verses 19b-30a “There was a well-known sage, Śantanu by name, who was honoured by gods and whose lustre was like that of the lotus-born one (i.e. Brahmā). (His) beautiful and youthful (wife) was known as Amoghā. Once Brahmā went to her house to meet her husband (Śantanu). At that time, the best sage (i.e. Śantanu) had gone to the forest for (collecting) flowers etc… Seeing that woman of a spotless body, the Creator was overpowered with the passion of love&#8230;</span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000; font-size: 12pt;">The semen of the supreme soul, Brahmā, fell on the bedstead</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">. Then Brahmā, being afflicted and distressed, quickly left. Then the sage came home, and saw (Brahmā’s) semen on the seat. He asked the beautiful woman (his wife): “Who had come here?” Then that brāhmaṇa understood it by means of meditation. “</span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000; font-size: 12pt;">O good woman, please preserve by my order the very important semen of Brahmā. A son, who alone will purify all the worlds, will be born (to you)</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">. Our desire which is all auspicious will (now) be fulfilled.” Then the chaste, illustrious woman, obeying his order, drank, for the birth of a son, the semen of Brahmā, the supreme soul.” Tr. N.A. Deshpande</span></p>
<p>A sage named Angira had also contracted Niyoga with the wife of Rathitara,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 9.6.2-3 “<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Rathītara had no sons, and therefore he requested the great sage Aṅgirā to beget sons for him</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Because of this request, Aṅgirā begot sons in the womb of Rathītara’s wife</span>. All these sons were born with brahminical prowess.— Having been born from the womb of Rathītara’s wife, all these sons were known as the dynasty of Rathītara, but because they were born from the semen of Aṅgirā, they were also known as the dynasty of Aṅgirā. Among all the progeny of Rathītara, these sons were the most prominent because, owing to their birth, they were considered brāhmaṇas.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>King Pandu was also born of Niyoga. After his marriage, he urged his wife Kunti to contract Niyoga with other men and beget offspring. Pandu’s biological father was Muni Vyasa,</p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 6.25.1-10 ”Vyasa said :– OKing! The mother became astonished to hear me. Becoming very anxious for a son, she began to speak to me. O Child! <span style="color: #ff0000;">The wife of your brother, the daughter Ambalika of Kasiraj, is a widow</span>; she is very sorrowful; she is endowed with all auspicious signs and endowed with all good qualities; <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">better cohabit with that beautiful young wife and get a child according to the tradition of the S’istas</span>…Seeing me an ascetic with matted hairs on my head and void of every love sentiment, perspiration came on her face; her body turned pale and her mind void of any love towards me. When I saw that lady trembling and pale beside me, I angrily spoke :– “O One of beautiful waist! When you have turned out pale, considering your own beauty, let your son be of a pale colour.” Thus saying <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">I spent there that night with Ambalika. After enjoying her</span> I took farewell from my mother and went to my place.” Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>It is also mentioned in Mahabharata Adi Parva 106. Muni Vyasa was appointed to cohabit with the princess but at first, the princess sent a maid. Despite knowing that it was a maidservant Muni Vyasa enjoyed her. Vyasa speaks about it in the following way,</p>
<p>Srimad Devi Bhagvatam 6.25.11-21 ”<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ambika sent to me a maid-servant of Vichitravîrya</span>, full of youth and beauty, and adorned with various ornaments and clothings. That maid-servant of beautiful hairs and of a swan-like gait adorned with garlands and red sandal-paste, came to me with many enchanting gestures and making me take my seat on the cot, became herself merged in love sentiments. O Muni! <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">I became pleased with her gestures and amorous sports and passed the night, full of love towards her and played and cohabited with her</span>.” Tr. Vijnananda</p>
<p>The story of Muni Vyasa cohabiting with the maid servant is also mentioned in Srimad Devi Bhagavatam 2.6.1-12. King Pandu was afflicted with a curse and thus couldn’t approach his wife for sexual intercourse. But he did not hesitate in ordering his wife to cohabit with other men,</p>
<p>Mahabharata 1.120.26-41 “Hearing these words of the ascetics, Pandu, remembering the loss of his procreative powers owing to the curse of the deer, began to reflect deeply. <span style="color: #ff0000;">And calling his wedded wife the excellent Kunti, unto him, he told her in private, ‘Strive thou to raise offspring at this time of distress</span>… <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The religious institutes mention six kinds of sons that are heirs and kinsmen</span>, and six other kinds that are not heirs but kinsmen. I shall speak of them presently. O Pritha, listen to me. They are: 1st, the son begotten by one’s own self upon his wedded wife; <span style="color: #ff0000;">2nd, the son begotten upon one’s wife by an accomplished person from motives of kindness</span>; <span style="color: #ff0000;">3rd, the son begotten upon one’s wife by a person for pecuniary consideration</span>; 4th, the son begotten upon the wife after the husband’s death; 5th, the maiden-born son; 6th, the son born of an unchaste wife; 7th, the son given; 8th, the son bought for a consideration; 9th, the son self-given; 10th, the son received with a pregnant bride; 11th, the brother’s son; and 12th, the son begotten upon a wife of lower caste. On failure of offspring of a prior class, the mother should desire to have offspring of the next class<span style="color: #ff0000;">. In times of distress, men solicit offspring from accomplished younger brothers</span>. <span style="color: #ff0000;">The self-born Manu hath said that men failing to have legitimate offspring of their own may have offspring begotten upon their wives by others</span>, for sons confer the highest religious merit. Therefore, O Kunti, being destitute myself of the power of procreation, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">I command thee to raise good offspring through some person who is either equal or superior to me</span></strong>. O Kunti, listen to the history of the daughter of Saradandayana who was appointed by her lord to raise offspring. That warrior-dame, when her monthly season arrived, bathed duly and in the night went out and waited on a spot where four roads met. She did not wait long when a Brahmana crowned with ascetic success came there. The daughter of Saradandayana solicited him for offspring. After pouring libations of clarified butter on the fire (in the performance of the sacrifice known by the name of <em>Punsavana</em>) she brought forth three sons that were mighty car-warriors and of whom Durjaya was the eldest, begotten upon her by that Brahmana. O thou of good fortune, do thou follow that warrior-dame’s example at my command, and speedily raise offspring out of the seed of some Brahmana of high ascetic merit.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>King Pandu also ordered his wife Kunti to conceive children with the Sun god Surya,</p>
<p>Mahabharata 1.123.1-9 “Vaisampayana said, ‘O Janamejaya, when Gandhari’s conception had been a full year old, it was then that Kunti summoned the eternal god of justice to obtain offspring from him. And she offered without loss of time, sacrifices unto the god and began to duly repeat the formula that Durvasa had imparted to her some time before. Then the god, overpowered by her incantations, arrived at the spot where Kunti was seated in his car resplendent as the Sun. Smiling, he asked, ‘O Kunti, what am I to give thee?’ And Kunti too smiling in her turn, replied, ‘Thou must even give me offspring.’ <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Then the handsome Kunti was united (in intercourse) with the god of justice</span> in his spiritual form and obtained from him a son devoted to the good of all creatures. And she brought his excellent child, who lived to acquire a great fame…<span style="text-decoration: underline;">And this first child of Pandu shall be known by the name of Yudhishthira</span>. Possessed of prowess and honesty of disposition, he shall be a famous king, known throughout the three worlds.”</p>
<p>Not to confuse this consensual sex with the rape. When Surya raped Kunti a son named Karna was born, see Devi Bhagavatam 2.6.36-48 and it happened before her marriage. While the above one happened after her marriage to King Pandu and a son name Yuddhishtira was born. So both these are two different stories. As Hindu scripture permits Niyoga, King Pandu had no problem with it at all. He kept on asking (or forcing) his wife to contract Niyoga with many men, finally, the distressed Kunti resisted it and addressed Pandu in the following way,</p>
<p>Mahabharata 1.123.75-77 “The celebrated Pandu, tempted by the desire of having more children wished to speak again unto his wedded wife (for invoking some other god). But Kunti addressed him, saying, ‘The wise do not sanction a fourth delivery even in a season of distress. The woman having intercourse with four different men is called a Swairini (heanton), while she having intercourse with five becometh a harlot. Therefore, O learned one, as thou art well-acquainted with the scripture on this subject, why dost thou, beguiled by desire of offspring, tell me so in seeming forgetfulness of the ordinance?&#8217;” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>This is just a reason given by Kunti to stop her husband from violating her by other men. Vedic law permits a woman to cohabit with up to 11 men to beget children. When Parashurama the sixth avatar of Vishnu annihilated Kshatriya men 21 times, the female Kshatriyas went to Brahmins to contract Niyoga and begat progeny who was Kshatriyas as the law of Niyoga is that the son belongs to the deceased father but not to the biological father who contracted Niyoga. Kshatriya women contracted Niyoga with Brahmin twenty-one times,</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana 2.3.46.29-33 “After killing all the Ksatriyas on the surface of the Earth, Rama became calm…Ksatriya kings were begotten of the widowed wives of those Ksatriyas by Brahmanas. Again he (Rama) killed hundreds and thousands of such kings. In two years, Rama made the Earth devoid of Ksatriyas once again…<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Again, O king, enlightened Ksatriyas </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">were procreated by the Brahmanas</span>. Rama killed them entirely like the god of death, the destroyer of the Earth.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Mahabharata 1.104.4-7 “And the illustrious scion of Bhrigu’s race, by means of his swift arrows annihilated the Kshatriya tribe one and twenty times. “And when the earth was thus deprived of Kshatriyas by the great Rishi, the Kshatriya ladies all over the land had offspring raised by Brahmanas skilled in the Vedas. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">It has been said in the Vedas that the sons so raised belongeth to him that had married the mother</span>. And the Kshatriya ladies went in unto the Brahamanas not lustfully but from motives of virtue. Indeed, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">it was thus that the Kshatriya race was revived</span>.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>

<h2><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Bestiality</span></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="443" height="326" class="wp-image-8863 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Picture-11-326h.jpeg" alt="https://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/bestiality-gods-khajuraho-temple-ashvamedha.jpg?w=443&amp;h=326" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Picture-11-326h.jpeg 443w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Picture-11-326h-300x221.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 443px) 100vw, 443px" /></p>
<p>Hinduism also allows Bestiality i.e. sex with animals. As I already mentioned, Shiva had raped Agni whilst Agni was in the form of a bird which is a case of bestiality, let me quote that passage again,</p>
<p>Brahma Purana, Gautami-Mahatmya 58.16-24 ”At the instance of Devas the <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">fire-god assumed the form of a parrot</span> and went to the place where the lord of the worlds was sporting with Uma…The lord of Devas called the fire-god moving about in front of him, in the form of a bird and said, ”O Agni, you have been recognised through various ways. Do not speak anything. Open your mouth. Take this in and carry it with you.” <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">After saying this lord Sambhu discharged a great deal of semen into the mouth of fire-god</span>. With this semen within him Agni could not at all go. Utterly tired, Agni sat down on the bank of Ganga. He then discharged a greater portion of that semen into Krttikas wherefrom Karttika was born. The remaining portion of the semen of Sambhu that had been within his body, Agni split into two and deposited into his beloved wife Svaha who was particularly eager to have a child.” Tr. Board of Scholars, Edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>A passage from Mahabharata shows that a Rishi named Kindama used to have sex with other deer as he was uncomfortable having sex with humans,</p>
<p>Mahabharata 1.118.5-38 “Vaisampayana said, ‘O king, one day Pandu, while roaming about in the woods (on the southern slopes of the Himavat) that teemed with deer and wild animals of fierce disposition, saw a large deer, that seemed to be the leader of a herd, serving his mate. Beholding the animals, the monarch pierced them both with five of his sharp and swift arrows winged with golden feathers. O monarch, <span style="color: #ff0000;">that was no deer that Pandu struck at, but a Rishi’s son of great ascetic merit who was enjoying his mate in the form of a deer</span>. Pierced by Pandu, while engaged in the act of intercourse, he fell down to the ground, uttering cries that were of a man and began to weep bitterly…[Rishi in deer form said] The time of sexual intercourse is agreeable to every creature and productive of good to all. O king [Pandu], <span style="color: #ff0000;">with this my mate I was engaged in the gratification of my sexual desire</span>. But that effort of mine hath been rendered futile by thee…I am, O king [Pandu], a Muni who liveth on fruits and roots, though disguised as a deer…<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">I was engaged in sexual intercourse with this deer, because my feelings of modesty did not permit me to indulge in such an act in human society</span>. In the form of a deer I rove in the deep woods in the company of other deer. Thou hast slain me without knowing that I am a Brahmana, the sin of having slain a Brahmana shall not, therefore, be thine. But senseless man, as you have killed me, disguised as a deer, at such a time, thy fate shall certainly be even like mine. When, approaching thy wife lustfully, thou wilt unite with her even as I had done with mine… Tr. Kisari Mohan Ganguli</p>
<p>Rishi Kindama was able to have sex with deer, I wonder how he was sexually attracted to deers? Maharshi Manu writes that many sages were born after sages had cast their semen in animals,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 10.72 ”Since through their excellent energies (potency), seeds, cast in the wombs of beasts (by the holy sages), fructified in the shapes of human beings, who became honoured and commendable Rishis in life; the seed is commended (as of greater importance in an act of fecundation).” Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-8864 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Bestiality-Complete-Untitled.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Ved Vyasa was attracted to Apsara Ghritachi even after she had assumed the form of a parrot,</p>
<p>Narada Purana II.58.18-25 “After having obtained that excellent boon from the Lord, Vyasa, the son of Satyavati, was one day engaged in churning the sacrificial sticks, with the desire of making a fire (for sacrificial purpose). At that time, the illustrious sage happened to see a heavenly damsel called Ghrtaci who, in consequence of her brilliant splendour, possessed excellent beauty. Seeing that celestial damsel, in that forest, the great sage Vyasa became instantly passionately enamoured of her. After making Vyasa deeply agitated with passion, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">the most beautiful Ghrtaci, transforming herself into a she-parrot, approached him. Even after seeing the celestial lady disguised in another form, he was overcome with cupid (passionate love) who spread in every part of his body</span>…Due to the inevitablity of Destiny (lit.what was to happen) the heart of the sage was fascinated by the (beautiful) form (of Ghrtaci). With the desire to do this (viz. the kindling of fire) while he was suppressing his passion with special efforts, all of sudden his semen fell on the churning sticks. It was thus that the great ascetic Suka was born, while Vyasa continued the churning of sacrificial sticks.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>There is another version of this story Devi Bhagavatam 1.14.1-70.</p>
<p>A demon named Rambha was a devotee of the fire god Agni. Not to confuse this demon Rambha as the Apsara named Rambha. He was desirous of having progeny. Agni accepted his prayer and said that he should immediately copulate with any specie and he will get a progeny.</p>
<p>Srimad Devi Bhagavatam 5.2.27-31 ”…Vyasa said :– O king! Hearing thus the sweet words of Fire, Rambha quitted the hold of his hairs and said :– O Lord of the Devas! If thou art pleased, grant my desired boon that a son be born unto me, who will destroy the forces of my enemy and who will conquer the three worlds. And that son be invincible in every way by the Devas, Danavas and men, very powerful, assuming forms at will, and respected by all. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The Fire</span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;"> said</span> :– O highly Fortunate! You will get your son, as you desire; therefore desist now from your attempting suicide. O highly fortunate Rambha! <span style="color: #ff0000;">With any female of whichever species, you will co-habit, you will get a son</span>, more powerful than you; there is no doubt in this. Vyasa said :– O king! Hearing thus the sweet words of the Fire as desired, Rambha, the chief of the Danavas, went, surrounded by Yaksas, to a beautiful place, adorned with picturesque sceneries; when one lovely she-buffalo, who was very maddened with passion, fell to the sight of Rambha. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">And he desired to have sexual intercourse with her, in preference to other women. The she-buffallo, too, gladly yielded to his purpose and Rambha had sexual intercourse with her</span>, impelled as it were by the destiny. The she-buffalo became pregnant with his semen virile…” Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Why does a Vedic god Agni command his devotee to have sex with ‘any specie’? The word of god becomes the command and can be taken as permissibility. The excerpts from Manu Smriti itself are enough to prove bestiality was practiced in the Vedic period.</p>
<p>There’s a story in Vishnu Purana about King Satadhanu who had taken birth as a dog due to committing the ‘sin’ of speaking with an infidel. His wife after taking rebirth as the daughter of Kasi recognized her husband and married him while he was still a dog,</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 3.18.64-67 “With the eye of divine intelligence she knew that her own husband had been regenerate as a dog, and going once to the city of Vaidiśá she saw the dog, and recognised her former lord in him. Knowing that the animal was her husband, she placed upon his neck the bridal garland, accompanying it with the marriage rites and prayers…” Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Hinduism also encourages Ashwamedha Yagna, let’s not go into details of this ritual. This ritual was performed by the king and his wives and also had the involvement of priests to chant Mantras. This ritual involved killing the horse, the chief queen would then place the penis of the dead horse in her vagina, and she would ask the dead horse to release semen in her. This ritual was done in front of the king and priests. Ram’s mother Kaushalya is said to have spent a night with the dead horse.

<p><a href="#top">top</a></p>
<h2><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Sex Positions</span></h2>
<p>Why the word of god has to explain sex position? It’s not porn literature after all. We have already read in the article Obscenity in Veda how the Vedas talk about sex positions. When Vedas the highest authoritative text can teach such vulgar things then why can’t other Hindu scriptures?</p>
<p>Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 6.4.9-10 ”If a man desires his wife with the thought: ”May she enjoy love with me.” <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Then, after inserting the member in her, joining mouth to mouth and stroking her organ</span>, he should utter the following mantra ”O semen, you have been produced from my every limb…Bring this women under my control, like a deer pierced by a poisoned arrow.” Now, the wife whome he desires with the thought: ”May she not conceive”- <span style="text-decoration: underline;">after inserting the member in her and joining mouth to mouth, she should inhale and exhale</span>, repeating the following mantra: ”with power, with semen, I reclaim the semen from you.” Thus she comes to be without semen.” Tr. Swami Nikhilananda</p>
<p>There is another verse in Brihadaranyaka Upanishad which is based on Vedas,</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 14.2.71 ”O bride, I am Amah and you are Saa I am Saman and you are Rik and I am sun and you earth. Let both of us unite together and procreate progeny.” Tr. Vaidyanath Shastri (Arya Samaj)</p>
<p>Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 6.4.20-22 Then he embraces her, repeating the following mantra: I am the vital breath and you are speech. You are speech and I am the vital breath. I am Saman and you are Rig; I am heaven and you are earth. Come, let us strive together so that we may have a male child.” <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Then he spreads apart her thighs, repeating the following mantra: “Spread yourselves apart, Heaven and Earth.” Inserting the member in her and joining mouth to mouth</span>, he strokes her three times from head to foot, repeating the following mantra:” Let Vishnu make the womb capable of bearing a son! Let Tvashtra shape the various limbs of the child! Let Prajapati pour in the semen! Let Dhatra support the embryo! O Sinivali, make her conceive; O goddess whose glory is widespread, make her conceive! May the two Atvins, garlanded with lotuses, support the embryo! “Let the two Atvins chum the womb with the two golden arani sticks! I am placing a seed in your womb to be delivered in the tenth month. As the earth has fire in its womb, as heaven is pregnant with the sun, as the quarters are impregnated by air, so I am impregnating you by placing this seed in your womb.” After the reciting of the mantra, he utters his own name and that of his wife and places the seed.” Tr. Swami Nikhilananda</p>
<p>The Padma Purana also shows vulgarity,</p>
<p>Padma Purana II.53.98-109 ”…O messenger, the organs of generation of the male and also of the female throb. Then the male and the female, being inflamed with passion, unite. The body (of the male) is rubbed with the body (of the female). Due to coitus a momentary pleasure is produced…” Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p>Padma Purana V.100.59b-77 ”…O king, there is the itching for sex in all beings. The penis of the man expands, so also the vulva of the woman. The woman and the man, getting mad, are then united. Due to rubbing of one body with another, there is a momentary pleasure…” Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p><a href="#top">top</a></p>
<h2><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Oral Sex</span></h2>
<p>There is a story of the sun god raping his wife by inserting his male organ into her mouth,</p>
<p>Brahma Purana 4.42-43 “The Lord assumed the form of a horse and approached her as she grazed about fearlessly in the form of a mare. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">It was in her mouth that he had his sexual intercourse</span>, as she began fidgeting due to her suspicion that he might be a person other than her own husband. She let out the semen of Vivasvat through her nostrils.” Tr. Board of Scholars, Edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>This is also mentioned in Shiva Purana,</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, UmaSamhita 5.35.32-34 ”He assumed the form of a horse and approached her for sexual indulgence with her who could not be overwhelmed by any living being due to her lustre and observance of restraint. O sage, in the course of the sexual activity <span style="color: #ff0000;">she suspected him to be another man</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Hence she received the semen through the mouth into the nostril</span>. Thence were born the twin gods Asvins, the foremost among physicians.” Tr. Board of Scholars, Edited by Jagdish Lal Shastri</p>
<p>This story is also mentioned in Matsya Purana 11.34-37 and Brahmanda Purana 2.3.59.74-76. This is also mentioned in Nirukta and Vedas although it doesn’t give much detail like the above verses. Kama Sutra also speaks about oral sex, although I shouldn’t quote Kama Sutra here but as evident, other Hindu scriptures are no less than Kama Sutra and I find no difference between them,</p>
<p>Kama Sutra 2.9 When, holding the man’s lingam with his hand, and placing it between his lips, the eunuch moves about his mouth, it is called the ‘nominal congress’. When, covering the end of the lingam with his fingers collected together like the bud of a plant or flower, the eunuch presses the sides of it with his lips, using his teeth also, it is called ‘biting the sides’. When, being desired to proceed, the eunuch presses the end of the lingam with his lips closed together, and kisses it as if he were drawing it out, it is called the ‘outside pressing’. When, being asked to go on, he puts the lingam further into his mouth, and presses it with his lips and then takes it out, it is called the ‘inside pressing’. When, holding the lingam in his hand, the eunuch kisses it as if he were kissing the lower lip, it is called ‘kissing’. When, after kissing it, he touches it with his tongue everywhere, and passes the tongue over the end of it, it is called ‘rubbing’. When, in the same way, he puts the half of it into his mouth, and forcibly kisses and sucks it, this is called ‘sucking a mango fruit’. And lastly, when, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">with the consent of the man, the eunuch puts the whole lingam into his mouth, and presses it to the very end, as if he were going to swallow it up, it is called ‘swallowing up</span>‘.</p>

<h2><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Masturbation</span></h2>
<p>The Padma Purana clearly shows how a woman masturbates, but why the word of god should do that?</p>
<p>Padma Purana V.112.23a-33a “On the death of the husband before (her death) she should not enter fire (with the thought) ‘In my widowhood, all this wealth will be useful for my religious merit.’ Resolving like this with (i.e. in) her mind, when widowhood has come, she, when she gets and itching of the vulva (i.e. has a desire for sex) by day or at night, she said (i.e. would say), after having gone to a lonely place and after having uncovered (i.e. taken off) her garment, to her vulva these words, through grief, and with her hand on her generative organ: ”O vulva, what have you done? What sin have you committed? Or is it the sin of the penis due to having got into you? Or is it the sin of the doer due to avoiding service like me?” Even then when the itch is produced, she would put her finger (into her vulva); and due to the feeling of the itch she would do strange movements after that. Having rubbed it with her hands, having struck it and having expanded it, she, being extremely pained, repeatedly shook her feet. She, after having embraced the (piece of) wood of the cot, and pressed her breasts (against it) as she liked, became sad due to peculiar disposition of her mind…” Tr. Board of Scholars; G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Mahabharata 3.224.7 “Markandeya continued, ‘Then Agni, filled with great joy and delight, married Swaha in the guise of Siva, and that lady joyfully cohabiting with him, held the semen virile in her hands.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Kama Sutra 5.6 The women of the royal harem cannot see or meet any men on account of their being strictly guarded, neither do they have their desires satisfied, because their only husband is common to many wives. For this reason among themselves they give pleasure to each other in various ways as now described. Having dressed the daughters of their nurses, or their female friends, or their female attendants, like men, they accomplish their object by means of bulbs, roots, and fruits having the form of the lingam, or they lie down upon the statue of a male figure, in which the lingam is visible and erect.</p>

<h2><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Open/Group Sex</span></h2>
<p>Many Hindu gods and sages used to have sex in the open mostly in the forest without any hesitation. Many times their act was seen by other people also. One such story is of Indra copulating with Paulomi and this act was seen by a sage named Anga,</p>
<p><strong>INDRA</strong></p>
<p>Padma Purana II.30.76-85 ”O brahmanas, once the brahmana, the very lustrous and vigorous son of Atri went to the Nandana (garden); there is saw Indra, Pakasasana. He saw Indra, who was accompanied by hosts of celestial nymphs and Gandharvas and Kinnaras…who was adorned with all ornaments, <span style="color: #ff0000;">who was engaged in sexual sports</span>, who possessed an unlimited prowess…By his side he saw the blessed virtuous Paulomi, charming and auspicious, glorious with beauty, lustre and penance, shining with good fortune and chastity. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">With her that Indra enjoyed in the Nandana forest. Seeing his sport</span>, the best brahmana Anga (thought): ‘Lucky is the king of gods who is surrounded by such (beings). Oh, (great) is the power of his penance, due to which he has obtained such a great (i.e. high) position.” Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p>Another act of Indra,</p>
<p>Mahabharata 3.115.17 ”…And the mighty ruler of the Haihaya tribe placing himself on his celestial car, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">affronted Indra, while that deity was enjoying himself with Sachi, his queen</span>. Then, O Bharata’s son, the blessed and the revered god (Vishhnu) held a consultation with Indra…” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p><strong>SHIVA</strong></p>
<p>Shiva was an ascetic by name only. He did many shameless acts, Rishis spotted Shiva and his wife having sex and they also saw Shiva’s wife topless,</p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 1.12.1-53 ”…Once on a time, Sanaka and other Risis went to this forest to pay a visit to Sankara, illuminating the ten quarters by their holy aura. But then <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Bhagavan Sankara was in amorous dealings with Sankari</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The beautiful Devi Ambika was then naked and sitting on the lap of Sankara</span> and therefore became very much ashamed at their sight…” Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>This is also mentioned in Brahmanda Purana 2.3.60.24-26a, But this didn’t stop Shiva from cohabiting in the open. He once again cohabited in a forest and was seen by the sage Bhrigu who later cursed him,</p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 4.20.36-37 “O King! When Mahadeva [Shiva], being infatuated with Kama, went into the forest of Bhrigu and <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">becoming naked, began to copulate</span>, the ascetic Bhrigu, seeing him in that state, exclaimed “O You are very shameless” and cursed Him thus :– Let your penis drop off just now. Mahadeva, then to satisfy his thirst for passion, began to drink the water of the lake Amrita Vapi, dug by the Danavas.” Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Once Uma the daughter of demon Bana observed the act between Shiva and Parvati and was struck with passion,</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 5.32.11-13 “PARASARA.–<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Usha, the daughter of Bana, having seen Parvati sporting with her lord, Sambhu</span>, was inspired with a wish for similar dalliance…” Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>There is a story in Skanda Purana although it’s not about Shiva or his wife having open sex but about his wife’s breasts seen by demons when her upper garments were tossed while playing with a ball,</p>
<p>Skanda Purana IV.ii.65.26-27 “The brilliance of her body was completely revealed as the upper cloth over her breasts was tossed about. The lotus like palms of the goddess became excessively red as she continuously beat the springing ball. Her eyebrows seemed to dance as her eyes closely followed the ball. Mrdani, the beautiful mother of the universe, was playing thus and she was seen by the Ditijas (demons) named Vidala and Utpala who happened to go through the firmament…” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p><strong>VISHNU</strong></p>
<p>Narada Muni went to Sveta Dipa the residence of Vishnu where he spotted Vishnu having sex with his wife and also saw the breasts of Vishnu’s wife Lakshmi,</p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 6.28.1-11 ”…<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Thus the Bhagavan Narayana was playing in amorous movements with the daughter of the ocean</span>, fully capable to give one delight and enjoyment. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Seeing me</span>, the lovely Devi Kamala, dear to Vasudeva, full of youth and beauty, decorated with ornaments, endowed with all auspicious signs, superior to all the women, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">went away at once (to another room)</span> from the presence of Janardana. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The breast of Laksmi Devi was becoming visible even through the cloth thrown over it</span>…” Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Vishnu’s avatar Krishna had also done a similar act with his girlfriend Viraja, His aunt cum concubine Radha was enraged because of that. Viraja due to Radha’s fear committed suicide,</p>
<p>Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Prakriti Khanda 49.1-9 ”…Once upon a time, Lord Krisna, well decked was sporting with a cow herdess named Viraja on a part of the Sata Sringa mountain situatied in Vrindavana at the Goloka…Their sexual intercourse was interminable Krisna and Viraja both expert in sexual intercourse enjoyed the pleasures of that intercourse. For one Manwantra according to the calculation of the residents of the Goloka, free from death and birth their intercourse lasted. Four female messengers of Radha went and informed Radha of the matter. Radha was thereupon highly incensed and threw down the garland from her breast…She ascended,, with millions of her beloved female companions…This car was faster in speed than the mind. Sudama, the friend of Krisna as soon as he perceived the approach of Radha, warned Krisna and ran away with his associates. Afraid of forfeiting the love of his beloved Radha, Krishna left the chaste Viraja and disappeared. Viraja, too, through Radha’s fear, committed suicide…” Tr. Rajendra Nath Sen</p>
<p><strong>RISHIS AND OTHERS</strong></p>
<p>An old sage named Parasara became passionate after he saw a girl named Satyavati on the boat and wanted to have sex right on the boat before everyone,</p>
<p>Mahabharata 1.63.69-84 “…While engaged in this vocation, Satyavati was seen one day by the great Rishi Parasara, in course of his wanderings. As she was gifted with great beauty, an object of desire even with an anchorite, and of graceful smiles, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">the wise sage, as soon as he beheld her, desired to have her</span>. And that bull amongst Munis addressed the daughter of Vasu of celestial beauty and tapering thighs, saying, ‘Accept my embraces, O blessed one!’ <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Satyavati replied, ‘O holy one, behold the Rishis standing on either bank of the river. Seen by them, how can I grant thy wish</span>?’ “Thus addressed by her, the ascetic thereupon created a fog (which existed not before and) which enveloped the whole region in darkness. And the maiden, beholding the fog that was created by the great Rishi wondered much. And the helpless one became suffused with the blushes of bashfulness…”<span style="text-decoration: underline;">And Satyavati gratified with having obtained the excellent boon in consequence of which she became sweet-scented</span> and her virginity remained unsullied <span style="color: #ff0000;">conceived through Parasara’s embraces. And she brought forth the very day, on an island in the Yamuna, the child begot upon her by Parasara</span>…” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>This is also mentioned in Shiva Purana Umasamhita 44.23. The poor girl named Satyavati couldn’t openly refuse as she was afraid that the Rishi may curse her. So she tried many other things given below,</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Umasamhita 5.14.18-25 ”Afflicted with lust the sage caught hold of the lass. Tremblingly the lass spoke to the merciful sage. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">”O great sage, I have foul smell and black complexion</span>…<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Afflicted by lust the sage caught hold of her again. On seeing him bent upon seizing her she said again</span>. ”It is mentioned in the Vedas that sexual intercourse shall be indulged in at night; not during the day…Hence please wait till the night falls. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Now all the men will see us and so shall my father who stands at the other bank</span>.” On hearing the words uttered by her, the leader sage immediately created a screen of snow, thanks to his strength of his merit.” Tr. Board of Scholars, Edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>As far as my opinion is concerned I consider this to be no different from prostitution. In prostitution, money is exchanged for illicit sex and here the Rishi offered her pleasant smell and beautiful form. This old Rishi was so aroused that he didn’t care about her foul smell or her ugly appearance, he held her hand and wanted to have sex right on the boat, he didn’t even care about other people standing on the other side of the shore. All he wanted was carnal satisfaction. Who knows the people on the other side may have seen this act but turned a blind eye because this was such a disgusting act.</p>
<p>A Rakshasa king spotted a Rishi having sex with his wife,</p>
<p>Narada Purana I.9.52 “Moving about on the banks of the Narmada, that Raksasa (king) who frightened all the world, happened to see a certain sage engaged in amorous sports with his beloved.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>On seeing Gandharvas making love a sage became very passionate,</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Rudra Samhita 2, Parvati Khanda 4, 34.9-10 ”The Gandharva was an expert in the science of erotics. He was in the company of a woman. He was therefore completely submerged in the ocean of pleasure, <span style="color: #ff0000;">sexual dalliance and was lusty</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">On seeing him the great sage became very lustful</span>. He lost interest in penance and began to think of acquiring a wife.” Tr. Board of Scholars, Edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>King of Gandharva had also copulated in open and was seen by a Brahmin woman,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 9.16.2-3 Once when Reṇukā, the wife of Jamadagni, went to the bank of the Ganges to get water, she saw the King of the Gandharvas, decorated with a garland of lotuses and sporting in the Ganges with celestial women [Apsarās]. She had gone to bring water from the Ganges, but when she saw Citraratha, the King of the Gandharvas, sporting with the celestial girls, she was somewhat inclined toward him and failed to remember that the time for the fire sacrifice was passing.</p>
<p><strong>GROUP SEX</strong></p>
<p>What else can be more disgusting than this? Balrama the elder brother of Krishna went to the Gopis which were abandoned by Krishna, they addressed him in the following way,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 10.65.11-12 “For Kṛṣṇa’s sake, O descendant of Dāśārha, we abandoned our mothers, fathers, brothers, husbands, children and sisters, even though these family relations are difficult to give up. But now, O Lord, that same Kṛṣṇa has suddenly abandoned us and gone away, breaking off all affectionate ties with us. And yet how could any woman fail to trust His promises?” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Balrama followed the footsteps of his younger brother Krishna. Balrama had sex with all of them instead of telling them to lead a chaste life,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 10.65.17-18 ”Lord Balarama, the Personality of Godhead, resided there for the two months of Madhu and Mādhava, and during the nights <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">He gave His cowherd girlfriends conjugal pleasure</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">In the company of numerous women, Lord Balarama enjoyed in a garden</span> by the Yamunā River. This garden was bathed in the rays of the full moon and caressed by breezes bearing the fragrance of night-blooming lotuses.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Swami Prabhupada tries his level best to show that these Gopis were different from those enjoyed by Krishna. But Srimad Bhagavatam10.65.9-10 clearly tells that those Gopis who were enjoyed by Balrama were the same Gopis that Krishna had enjoyed. Balrama like his brother Krishna was not ashamed at all copulating with numerous women at the same time. Another passage from Srimad Bhavatam shows that Apsaras also have a group sex,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 4.6.25 ”My dear Kṣattā, Vidura, the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">celestial damsels come down to those rivers in their airplanes with their husbands, and after sexual enjoyment</span>, they enter the water and enjoy sprinkling their husbands with water.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>As per the story mentioned in Srimad Bhagavatam a sage named Kardama divided himself into 9 men and impregnated his wife with 9 discharges,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 3.23.47 ”The powerful Kardama Muni was the knower of everyone’s heart, and he could grant whatever one desired. Knowing the spiritual soul, he regarded her as half of his body. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Dividing himself into nine forms, he impregnated Devahuti with nine discharges of semen</span>.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p><a href="#top">top</a></p>
<h2><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Immorality</span></h2>
<p>Hinduism has many more immoral things prescribed in the scripture. When Shiva’s wife died, he held her dead body and kissed her frequently which can be considered Necrophilia,</p>
<p>Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Krishna Janma Khanda 43.1-24 ”…Lamenting thus and afflicted with grief, he held the dead body of his beloved wife to his breast and kissed and embraced it again and again. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Siva pressed his lips to the lips of his beloved</span> and embracing her repeatedly swooned again” Tr. Rajendra Nath Sen</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Padma Purana 1.31.123-127 states that Shiva offered his testicles to a hungry Shivaduti as food, </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Padma Purana, Srsti Khanda section 1, chapter 31, verses 123-127 &#8220;Thus addressed Maheśvara, the god of gods, told them in the vicinity of Pārvatī about their food: “I have accomplished the food prepared in many ways. All that is exhausted. And no other (kind of </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">food) is seen here&#8230;. I shall give you as food which has never been tasted before by anyone. Below my navel are these two circular long and fruit-like testicles. Even with this food you will have great satisfaction.” Tr. N.A. Deshpande</span></p>
<p>Vishnu exchanged his wives, he gave his wives to Shiva and Brahma,</p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 9.6.45-67 “…Now go in full Amsas to Brahmâ and become His wife. Let Gangâ go also in Her fullness to S&#8217;iva. Let Padmâ remain with Me. Padmâ is of a peaceful nature, void of anger, devoted to Me and of a Sâttvika nature&#8230;” Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Also mentioned in Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Prakriti Khanda, Chapter 6, Verse 13-60</p>
<p>It is mentioned in Shastra that if a younger brother gets married before his elder brother is married then he should give his wife to the elder brother and later take her back after his elder brother has copulated with his wife,</p>
<p>Vasistha Dharma Shastra 20.8-10 Now he who has taken a wife before his elder brother shall perform a Krikkhra penance and an Atikrikkra penance, give (his wife) to that (elder brother), marry again, and take (back) the same (woman whome he wedded first). The husband of a younger sister married before her elder sister shall perform a Krikkhra penance during twelve days, marry and take to him that (elder sister). The husband of an elder sister married after the younger one shall perform a Krikkhra penance and an Atikrikkhra penance, give (his wife) to that (husband of the younger sister and marry again).</p>
<p>This is also mentioned in Mahabharata,</p>
<p>Mahabharata 12.165.67-70 “If a younger brother weds before his elder brother, then the younger brother, the elder brother and the woman that is married, all three, in consequence of such wedding, become fallen. All of them should observe the vows prescribed for a person who has neglected his sacrificial fire, or practise the vow of Chandrayana for a month, or some other painful vow, for cleansing themselves of their sin. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The younger brother, wedding, should give his wife unto his unmarried elder brother</span>. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Afterwards, having obtained the permission of the elder brother, the younger brother may take back his wife</span>.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Manu Smriti censures the marriage of a younger brother while the elder brother remains single,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 3.171-2 He must be considered as a Parivettri who marries or begins the performance of the Agnihotra before his elder brother, but the latter as a Parivitti. The elder brother who marries after the younger, the younger brother who marries before the elder, the female with whom such a marriage is contracted, he who gives her away, and the sacrificing priest, as the fifth, all fall into hell.</p>
<p>A story in Skanda Purana goes like this,</p>
<p>Skanda Purana I.i.21.112-115 “On being rebuked thus by Rati, the excellent sage Narada himself hurriedly went to Sambara, the leading Daitya. He intimated to the king of Daityas that Madana had been burned by Rudra who had become furious. Then he continued: ‘His wife is a noble-minded lady. Bring her here, O highly fortunate one. Make her your wife, O mighty one. Among all those beautiful ladies who have been brought by you, that Rati, the wife of Madana, will be the most beautiful one.’ On hearing these words of the celestial sage of sanctified soul, he went to that place where the highly splendid lady was staying.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Rati insults Sage Narada for his overtures. Sage Narada takes revenge by instigating Sambara, king of Daityas, to abduct Rati and marry her. He abducts her but couldn’t marry her as he is unable to touch her as Rati decreed that he would be reduced to ashes if he touches her so he makes her the chief of his kitchen under the name of Mayavati. Such was the character of the Hindu sage that he instigated a Daitya king to abduct and marry her just because she insulted him.</p>
<p>Ravana describes the beauty of Sita,<br />
Valmiki Ramayana, Aranya Kanda 3.46.16-20 “While standing before her then Ravana eyed at the auspicious wife of Rama, whose lips and teeth are fine, visage is shiny like a full moon, and who is presently tortured by her tearful lamentation and sitting in the straw-cottage, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">and he approached that lotus-petal eyed Vaidehi who is dressed in ochry silks</span>, as that night-walker is gladdened at his heart for her solitude. Glittering like the glitter of gold, silkened in ochry silks, you are like a lotus-tendril garlanded with divine lotuses as your ensemble, who are you?” Thus Ravanan started addressing Seetha. “Oh, rosy faced one, are you the personified numen of Respect, Renown or Resplendence, or the Felicitous Lakshmi herself, or oh, curvaceous one, are you a nymphal Apsara, or the numen of Benefactress, or a self-motivated woman, or Rati Devi, the consort of Manmatha, the Love God. “Your hips are beamy, thighs burly akin to elephant’s trunks, <span style="color: #ff0000;">and these two breasts of yours that are ornamented with best jewellery are rotund, rubbing and bumping each other, and they are swinging up and up, their nipples are brawny and jutting out, and they are smoothish like palm-fruits, thus they are covetable for they are beautiful</span>.” Tr. Shri Desi Raju Hanumantha Rao</p>
<p>Sita was wearing a silk saree so it’s possible that her breasts and nipples were visible through that saree or it could be that she had denuded herself.</p>
<p><strong>BLACK MAGIC</strong></p>
<p>Hinduism teaches extremely obscene black magic spells and techniques.</p>
<p>Khadira Grihya Sutras 1.4.15-16. At the time of her courses <span style="text-decoration: underline;">he should touch with his right hand her secret parts with (the verse)</span>, ‘May Vishnu make thy womb ready’ (MB. I, 4, 6). When (that verse) is finished, he should cohabit with her, with (the verse), ‘Give conception’ (l.l. 7).</p>
<p>Narada Purana III.84.32-35 “In the north-eastern corner he shall duly worship Vighnaraja accompanied by his beloved. He is shining with goad and noose in his hands. His fingers are engaged in touching the beloved’s private parts. He is naked and holds a skull filled with wine. With the tusk he is holding a bowl that shines and from which jewels roll down. He shall worship Pusti who is also naked. Her features resembles saffron. She is unfettered in her intoxicated gestures and movements. With one hand, she holds a red lotus and with the other she touches penis. She is pink in colour. She has embraced her lover. The two treasures are to be worshipped…” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Narada Purana III.84.24-26 “He who meditates on the vaginal passage of a woman splashed with the menstrual blood and repeats the mantra ten thousand times, shall certainly fascinate and captivate the people by means of sweet poesy. The devotee shall meditate on Kali as follows: She is stationed on the chest of Shiva who is on the Yantra with fifteen corners. She is engaged in amorous battle with lord Mahakala and is smiling sweetly. The devotee himself shall perform sexual intercourse. even as he does so he shall repeat the mantra a thousand times. [29] While during the day, the devotee should take sacrificial meals and during the night while engaged in sexual intercourse he should repeat the mantra a hundred thousand times. He shall thereby become a king” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p><strong>Technique to secure the love of Husband</strong></p>
<p>Agni Purana 302.7-18 ”…The above Mantra sacred to the goddess Chamunda, should be deemed as the best of charms. A wife, should wash her vagina with the expressed juice of the drugs known as the Triphala, whereby she would be able to win her husband’s affections for good. Similarly a wife should apply over her private parts, a paste composed of Ashvagandha, barley, turmeric, camphor, Pippali, the eight sorts of grain known as the Ashtadhanya, Vrihati, and twenty black pepper, who would thereby retain the affection of her husband for the last day of her life…” Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Below is the verse telling how to secure the love of husband and how to stop him from going to other women,</p>
<p>Garuda Purana, Dhanvantari Samhita 203. ”…A plaster composed of Samdhava, Krishna Lavanam, galls of fishes, and sugar pasted together with honey and clarified butter may be applied by a woman to her own private parts before sharing the bed of a man. The man, who will know her thus, will never visit any other woman in his life…” Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Agni Purana 313.15-23 ”…The same Mantra, repeated by a man or a wife at the time of sexual intercourse, would captivate his or her mind forever. A man, fondly looking at the nudity of a woman, or touching her while repeating the Mantra, is sure to enthrall her mind for good…” Tr. M.N Dutt</p>
<p>Hindu scriptures has such techniques for men also,</p>
<p>Garuda Purana Ch 208 ”O thou supreme deity, O thou beloved of Parvati, let a man, during an act of sexual congress, take his own seed, and smear the left leg of the woman therewith with this left hand, whereby he is sure to bring her under his control. O thou supreme deity, the application of a plaster composed of pigeon’s dung and rock-salt pasted together with honey by a man, before an act of coitus, to his own reproductive organ, enables him to bring the woman under his control. Take five red flowers of different species, and Privangu, equal in weight with these flowers; and paste them together. The plastering of his reproductive organ with this paste, before an act of sexual union, gives a man the power of fascinating the woman.” Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Demons suck the blood of menstruating women,</p>
<p>Garuda Purana 2.22.61-62 ”[Ghosts said] We lick up the urine mixed with semen from the vaginal passage of the widow having illicit intercourse with her paramour. Dear friend, I am ashamed to tell you about the food we take. O pious brahmana, we lick up the menstrual blood from the generative organ of a woman.” J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Giving breasts to Brahmana to suck before son. A woman insisted a Brahmana to suck her breasts and he did it,</p>
<p>Skanda Purana V.iii.20.47-48 Sri Devi said:- If a righteous son well-known all over the world is to be born to me, I will first breast-feed a Brahmana and then alone my son. O great sage, such a son has been born to me. O eminent Brahmana, if you wish to be alive suck the breasts.” Tr. G.V. tagare</p>
<p>The above verses may sound decent after reading Narada Purana verses. The Narada Purana contains many absurd black magic spells,</p>
<p>Narada Purana III.84.22-24 ”In the cremation ground the devotee shall sit naked on the chest of a corpse.

<p>In ancient India Brother and sister used to marry each other, says Swami Chandermoli<br />

<p>As per Brihadaranyaka Upanishad all creatures were born after God raped his own daughter,</p>
<p>Birhadaranyaka Upanishad 1.4.3-4 “He was not at all happy. Therefore people (still) are not happy when alone. He desired a mate. He became as big as man and wife embracing each other. He parted this very body into two. From that came husband and wife. Therefore, said Yajnavalkya, this (body) is one-half of oneself, like one of the two halves of a split pea. Therefore this space is indeed filled by the wife. He was united with her. From that men were born. She thought, ‘How can he be united with me after producing me from himself? Well, let me hide myself.’ She became a cow, the other became a bull and was united with her; from that cows were born. The one became a mare, the other a stallion; the one became she-ass, the other became a he-ass and was united with her; from that one hoofed animals were born. The one became a ewe, the other became a ram and was united with her; from that goats and sheep were born. Thus did he project everything that exists in pairs, down to the ants.” Tr. Swami Madhavananda</p>
<p>Adi Shankaracharya wrote on this verse,</p>
<p>‘’He, the Viraj called Manu, was united with her, his daughter called Satarupa, whom he conceived of as his wife. From that union men were born.’’ by Shankara on Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 1.4.3, Shankara Bhashya, p.101, Tr. Swami Madhavananda.</p>
<p>Manu and his daughter Ida incest,</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana 1:8:1:7-10 &#8220;Being desirous of offspring, he engaged in worshipping and austerities. During this time he also performed a pâka-sacrifice: he offered up in the waters clarified butter, sour milk, whey, and curds. Thence a woman was produced in a year: becoming quite solid she rose; clarified butter gathered in her footprint. Mitra and Varuna met her. They said to her, &#8216;Who art thou?&#8217; &#8216;Manu&#8217;s daughter,&#8217; she replied. &#8216;Say (thou art) ours,&#8217; they said. &#8216;No,&#8217; she said, &#8216;I am (the daughter) of him who begat me.&#8217; They desired to have a share in her. She either agreed or did not agree, but passed by them. She came to Manu. Manu said to her, &#8216;Who art thou?&#8217; &#8216;Thy daughter,&#8217; she replied. &#8216;How, illustrious one, (art thou) my daughter?&#8217; he asked. She replied, &#8216;Those offerings (of) clarified butter, sour milk, whey, and curds, which thou madest in the waters, with them thou hast begotten me. I am the blessing (benediction): make use of me at the sacrifice! If thou wilt make use of me at the sacrifice, thou wilt become rich in offspring and cattle. Whatever blessing thou shalt invoke through me, all that shall be granted to thee!&#8217; He accordingly made use of her (as the benediction) in the middle of the sacrifice; for what is intermediate between the fore-offerings and the after-offerings, is the middle of the sacrifice. With her he went on worshipping and performing austerities, wishing for offspring. Through her he generated this race, which is this race of Manu; and whatever blessing he invoked through her, all that was granted to him. Now this (daughter of Manu) is essentially the same as the Idâ&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Julius Eggeling</p>
<p>Krishna’s son by Rukmini was Pradumnya. When he was seven days old he was carried away by an Asura prince named Samvara and was entrusted to the care of his childless wife Mayavati (Harivamsa, Visnu Parva, 104, 6-7). When Pradumnya grew up into manhood Mayavati one day offered her love to him. He was at first shocked at this unseemly behaviour having been under the impression that she was his mother. Knowing from her the fact of this birth in the Yadava family he killed Samvara and married her (Vishnu Purana 5.27; Srimad Bhagavatam 10.55).</p>
<p>Another wife of Pradumnya was Rukmavati, who was the daughter of his maternal uncle Rukmi (Srimad Bhagatan 10.61). Here is again a case of marriage within the prohibited degree.</p>
<p>Pradumnya’s son Aniruddha similarly married his maternal uncle’s daughter, Rochna, who was the grand-daughter of Rukmi (Srimad Bhagavatam 10.61).</p>
<p>Samba was the son of Krishna born to his wife Jambavati. Krishna’s sixteen thousand wives were sexually aroused seeing their step son Samba. So Krishna in anger cursed his son.</p>
<p>Varaha Purana 177.2-31 “When Krsna was living there with his wives and sons, once Narada stepped in…But Narada took Krsna aside and spoke to him in private. ‘I have to tell you something in secret. Please liten. Your son Samba is young, eloquent and handsome is longed by all the women here. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The Supreme God gave you these sixteen hundred divine women for your pleasure. Their minds get agitated (with love) when they see Samba, and this (scandal) has spread even in Brahmaloka</span>…By calling Samba and all this multitute of women and seating them here, I shall show you whether what I say is true or false…Then Samba entered with folded hands and waited to know the command (of Krsna). Seeing the exceptionally handsome Samba, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">all those noble women felt agitated in mind even when Krsna was watching them</span>. Then Krsna asked these beloved women of his to get up and go to their homes and they did so… Looking at Narada, Krsna bent down his face in shame. He then told Narada in detail about the nature of women and their conduct leading to sin. ‘They have no consideration of time, of secrecy of what they do. Still they pass to be virtous. Women irrespective of their age, whether they be girls, teenagers, middle-aged or advanced in age, get their passion excited at the sight of a handsome man. O great sage, this is natural to them… A chariot does not move, ‘ (he said), ‘with a single wheel alone. It is only with the response of men do women get excited with passion. They get gratified by the looks of men. Seeing (your other son) Pradyumna, they become highly shy. But by seeing Samba, they become stricken with passion and the sandal paste and such other things (on his body) act as additional excitants. So Samba must be held responsible for ruining your women and you cannot obliterate the scandal that has reached even Satyaloka…Krsna then cursed Samba to become ugly and immediately he became a leper. Foul smelling blood began to ooze from his body which became full of wounds.” Tr. Venkitasubramonia Iyer, J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Skanda Purana VII.I.101.1-38 “At this very juncture (came) venerable sage Narada…In the court of his wandering at will, he always used to come to Dvaravati to pay a visit to Vasudeva. As he came on quickly all the Yadava youths beginning with Pradyumna remained with their heads (politely) bent down…but Samba due to the inevitability of the curse, slighted the noble souled Narada as usual. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Being very proud of his youth and handsome features he was forever indulgent in sexual dalliance and liquor</span>. On seeing him impolite and rude, Narada thought thus: Today I shall try to curb this impolite one…After thinking thus, he spoke to Vasudeva: O most excellent one among Devas, here there are sixteen thousand women. O my Lord, their emotional fondness for Samba is much…On hearing these words from Narada, Kesava began to think. What has thus been mentioned by Narada may have some truth in it…Narada went away as he came. A few days thereafter, he returned to Dvaraka. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">On that day the Lord was engaged in drinking liquor after enjoying aquatic sports along with all the members of his Antahpura (inner apartment)…Staying there the Lord drank the liquor of great auspicious flavour</span>. In the meantime, fully aware that the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">women were inebriated due to liquor</span>, Narada spoke to Samba: ‘O princely youth, do come and stand here. The Lord calls you. It is not proper on my part to stay on there.’ Urged by Narada…Samba entered quickly and bowed down to his father. He took the seat pointed out by Visnu with natural feeling. In the meantime those women there who were deficient in self control became highly agitated as soon as they saw Samba. As they were staying within the Antahpura so long, they had not seen him before. The liquor had its own effect in making them forget everything. Further they were naturally devoid of self control. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Hence their loins became moistened. On seeing an excellent man, the excellent organ of generation of women becomes moistened and dump</span> even if they are observing celibacy or are Yoginis…After sending Samba in, Narada also came hurriedly closely on the heels of Samba. On seeing the sage coming with pleasant manners, all those women suddenly got up; they were tipsy. Even as Vasudeva was watching, when they got up suddenly their valuable garments got torn and fell down into the pots (of liquor). The clothes clinging to their loins (underwear) also fell separately. On seeing it Hari became angry, he cursed those women: O women, since your minds strayed elsewhere unmindful of me, you will not get into the regions occupied by your husband at the close of your life. Slipping down from the world of your husband as well as from the path of heaven, you will have no refuge and will fall into the clutches of robbers. As a result of this defect and curse, those women, at the time of Krsna’s heavenward departure, were abducted by robbers belonging to Pancanada even as Arjuna was looking on.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>There is another version of this story,</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 70.2- “Siva said:- There will be 16,000 wives of Krisna in the Yuga mentioned before. When once, in the spring time, those ladies, having decorated themselves with ornaments, would be drinking together on the banks of a pond studded with full budded lotus flowers, dancing with the wind and resounding with the melodious notes of the cuckoo and musical tunes of the big black bee, they will see Lord Samba, beautiful like Cupid, having eyes handsome like those of a gazelle, and wearing the garlands of malati, passing by. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">They will cast on him amorous glances, their hearts being fired with lustful feelings and they being targets of the arrows of Cupid</span>. Lord Krishna will come to know all that with his mental vision, and will curse them as follows: ‘Because you cherished the desire of amorous pastime during my absence, all of you will be taken away by bandits.” Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>During the propagation of living beings, Manu sprang from the lower half of Brahma and Satarupa from the left-hand side of Brahma’s body. And these two siblings then begat a couple of children,</p>
<p>Srimad Devi Bhagavatam 3.13.15-16 “Next Svayambhava Manu sprang from the lower half of Brahma; and the daughter named Satarupa came out of the left hand side of the Brahma’s body. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The two sons Priyavrata and Uttânapâda were born of Manu in the womb of S’atarûpâ</span> and the three daughters, very beautiful and fair complexioned, were also born of him.” Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Another version shows that when Prajapati created sons and a daughter from himself his sons were attracted to their sister and out of desire they discharged semen which Brahma preserved in a bowl</p>
<p>Kausitaki Brahmana 6.1.1-12 “P<span style="text-decoration: underline;">rajapati, being desirous of propagation, underwent penance; from him when heated were born five, Agni, Vayu, Adityaa, Candramas, and Usas as fifth</span>. He said to them, ‘Do ye also practise fervour.’ They consecrated themselves; then when they had consecrated themselves and had acquired fervour, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Usas, offspring of Prajapati, taking </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">the form of an Apsaras, came out in front of them; to her their minds inclined; they poured out seed</span>; they went to Prajapati, their father, and said, ‘We have poured out seed; let it not remain here’. Prajapati made a golden bowl, an arrow breadth in height and similar in breadth; in it he poured the seed; then arose he of a thousand eyes, of a thousand feet, with a thousand fitted (arrows).” Tr. A.B. Keith</p>
<p>Hindus view marriages with cousins as incestuous, but Krishna himself is said to have married his paternal aunt’s daughter. Mitravinda was the daughter of Rajadhidevi who was the sister of Krishna’s father Vasudeva making Mitravinda the first cousin of Krishna,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 10.58.31 “My dear King, Lord Kṛṣṇa forcibly took away Princess Mitravindā, the daughter of His aunt Rājādhidevī, before the eyes of the rival kings.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Krishna is said to have married another cousin named Bhadra,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 10.58.56 “Bhadrā was a princess of the Kaikeya kingdom and the daughter of Lord Kṛṣṇa’s paternal aunt Śrutakīrti. The Lord married Bhadrā when her brothers, headed by Santardana, offered her to Him.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 10.83.15-16 “Śrī Bhadrā said: My dear Draupadī, of his own free will my father invited his nephew Kṛṣṇa, to whom I had already dedicated my heart, and offered me to Him as His bride. My father presented me to the Lord with an akṣauhiṇi military guard and a retinue of my female companions. My ultimate perfection is this: to always be allowed to touch Lord Kṛṣṇa’s lotus feet as I wander from life to life, bound by my karma.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>I find it quite ironic that Hindus make fun of Muslims for marrying first cousin, Consanguineous marriages or marriage with cousins is prevalent among Hindus, as per National Family Health Survey 5 (NFHS-5) survey, 10.1% of Hindu women married to a blood relative. Whereas Hindus, accuse Muslims of “marrying sisters” despite the fact that a sizeable Hindu population has married their cousins, above all their Krishna is said to have married his first cousins. Some Hindus in Karnataka, Telangana, and parts of Maharashtra marry their niece.</p>
<p>Krishna also had affair with his maternal aunt Radha who was married to Rayana the brother of Yashoda who was the mother of Krishna,</p>
<p>Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Prakriti Khanda, Chapter 49, Verses 36-43 &#8220;In the Varaha-kalpa, Radhika was born in the village of Gokula in the family of a Vaisya cowherd. She was born without any human contact&#8230;After the expiry of twelve years, finding her becoming youthful, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">she was married to a trader named Rayana</span>; at the time of her marriage only a shadow of Radha was married to the trader while the real Radha herself disappeared. After the expiry of fourteen years Krsna, the lord of the universe appeared there as an infant&#8230;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">This Rayana was the real brother of Yasodha the mother of Krsna</span> who happened to be an amsa of Krsna in Gokula and was his maternal uncle in the sacred forest of Vrndavana. Brahma the creator of the universe had performed the marriage of Radha with Krsna. Radha whose lotus-like feet were beyond the sight of cowherds even in dream, the same <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Radha enjoyed the lap of lord Krsna and her shadow was very much present in the house of Rayana</span>.&#8221; Tr. Shanti Lal Nagar</p>
<p>Krishna though his &#8220;mystical powers&#8221; appeared in the dream of Gopis and his mother, after having sex with Gopis in their dreams the adult Krishna sucked the breast of his mother Yashoda. Though it was a dream but adult Krishna did this being in full consciousness,</p>
<p>Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Krishna Janma Khanda, Chapter 98, Verses 41-44 &#8220;In spite of that I shall honour your words, I shall go to Radhika, the cowherdesses and my mother Yasoda in dream. On hearing this the glorious Uddhava went back to his abode. Then lord Krsna reached Gokula which was suffering from separation. In the dream he assured Radhika and bestowed the divine knowledge on her and satisfied the cowherdesses with various types of sports. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">He sucked the breast of Yasoda</span> who was enjoying the deep sleep and asurring the cowherds and the cowherd boys variouslly, he returned to Mathura.&#8221; Tr. Shanti Lal Nagar, edited by Acharya Ramesh Chaturvedi</p>
<p>Krishna and his foster mother Yashoda were lovers says Hindu scholar Sadhguru, “Yashoda was the foster mother of Krishna. She loved him. But, this love was not merely a motherly love. It was till Krishna was an infant. Krishna grew too fast. Then, that love changed into that of a lover. She started doing Rasa with Krishna&#8230;”<br />

<p>Baudhyana permits cousin marriages for south Indian Hindus,</p>
<p>Baudhayana Dharma Shastra, Prasna I, Adhyaya 1, Kandika 2, verses 3-5 They are, to eat in the company of an uninitiated person, to eat in the company of one’s wife, to eat stale food, to marry the daughter of a maternal uncle or of a paternal aunt…He who follows (these practices) in any other country than where they prevail, commits sin.</p>
<p>A story in Mahabharata says that after Asura Ilwala killed the pitrs of Rishi Agastya, they requested Agastya to beget a son that would save them from the pit (hell). As requested by them Rishi Agastya first creates a girl with an intention of marrying her. Logically this makes her the daughter of Rishi Agastya. After creating her, Rishi Agastya gives her to a childless king who was performing penance to obtain progeny, and the king adopts the girl child who was named Lopamudra. After reaching the proper age fit to beget a child, Rishi Agastya marries her and begets a child,</p>
<p>Mahabharata 3.96.18-25 “…Agastya replied, saying, ‘Ye Pitris, I will accomplish your desire. Let this anxiety of yours be dispelled.’ And the illustrious Rishi then began to think of perpetuating his race. But he saw not a wife worthy of him on whom he himself could take his birth in the form of a son. The Rishi accordingly, taking those parts that were regarded as highly beautiful, from creatures possessing them, created therewith an excellent woman. And the Muni, endued with great ascetic merit, thereupon gave that girl created for himself to the king of the Vidharbhas who was then undergoing ascetic penances for obtaining offspring. And that blessed girl of sweet face (thus disposed of) then took her birth (in Vidarbha’s royal line) and, beautiful as the effulgent lightning, her limbs began to grow day by day…” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Mahabharata 3.97.8-9 “…And at these words of his daughter, O monarch, the king gave away Lopamudra unto the illustrious Agastya with due rites. And obtaining her as wife…” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>A sage named Yajnavalkya accidentally impregnated his own sister,</p>
<p>Skanda Purana V.iii.42.8-12 ”She attended to his needs and stayed there performing penance. On a certain occassion, she had her monthly course during the day when she took her bath. She saw a rag kept concealed and so wore it as her undergarment. In the meantime, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">at night Yajnavalkya had an erotic dream in a place where there was none. As a result of the dream, there was an emission of semen in his loin cloth</span>. It resembled a drop of blood…The poor Brahmana woke up and found the piece of cloth defiled. He thought it not worthy of being touched and so cast it off and washed himself clean in accordance with the injunctions in the Smrti texts. Bath at night has been prohibited. So the Brahmana went to sleep again. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">At midnight the woman took this cloth and covered her vaginal aperture</span>.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>She later abandoned the child,</p>
<p>Skanda Purana V.iii.42.16-24 ”O lady of auspicious Vratas, it is none of your faults nor mine. Of the foetus in your womb, fate alone is the cause. It has to be carefully preserved by you forever. It should not be destroyed. It should be awaited till the whole period is over.” The chaste lady was ashamed. Yet she said in distress, ”So be it”. She nurturted the child in the womb till the normal deliver. As soon as the child was born, the Brahmana lady came to the root of a banyan tree. Abandoning the child there she spoke thus: ”May all those living beings in all the worlds, mobile and immoble, protect this child abandoned by me.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Is it really possible that a woman conceives a child just by wearing a loin cloth in which semen was emitted? In my opinion, this sage Yajnavalkya had intercourse with her and later gave this lame excuse. The semen dries quickly and it needs to be put into the female organ to impregnate a woman, how did she conceive the child just by wearing that loin cloth. It is very doubtful.</p>

<h2><a id="Prostitution"></a><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Prostitution</span></h2>
<p>Some Hindu text prohibits prostitution but some also permit it. Devdasi means servant of god, Devdasi should dance in the temple and she is also forced into prostitution and sexually abused by the Brahmins. Although Devdasi is banned by the government but Temple prostitution or sacred prostitution is still prevalent in many parts of India,<br />
According to a report by a one-man commission headed by Justice Raghunath Rao in 2015, there are 80,000 Devdasi in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh states.<br />
<a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Devadasi-system-still-exists-in-Telangana-AP-says-report/articleshow/46337859.cms" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Devadasi-system-still-exists-in-Telangana-AP-says-report/articleshow/46337859.cms<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>As per Theguardian.com’s 2011 report “The National Commission for Women estimate that there are 48,358 Devadasis currently in India.”<br />
<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/jan/21/devadasi-india-sex-work-religion" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/jan/21/devadasi-india-sex-work-religion<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>And as per TheHindu.com “Quoting the National Commission for Women, the authority says there are 2.5 lakh “Devadasi” girls who have been dedicated to Yellamma and Khandoba temples on Maharastra-Karnataka border. This includes 16,624 from Andhra Pradesh, 22,941 from Karnataka and 2,479 from Maharastra. The Devadasi system is prevalent in 10 districts of north Karnataka and 14 districts in Andhra Pradesh.”<br />

<p>One can find the permissibility of this evil practice in Hindu scriptures,</p>
<p>Padma Purana V.113.40-46b ”Vasistha said:- O king, you have not asked enough. That is said to be holy which enables one to be more sportive, O king. He should make Siva’s temple white with whitewash on all sides. He should have women who are endowed with beauty and graceful movements, adorned with all ornaments, skilled in (singing) many good songs, and proficient in various kinds of dancing…All should be beautiful and should have graceful movements. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">All should be of firm breasts. They should be skilled in the ways of sexual love</span> and should be trustworthy…O king, he who has <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">caused women like this to dance (even) on one day, gets into a (divine) aeroplane in a year</span>.” Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p>Vijay Mallya should learn something from these verses, As Kingfisher airline has incurred a huge loss. Is it a temple or a nightclub that asks its followers to construct a temple and make girls dance before men? A story mentioned in Padma Purana shows that Krishna cursed his 16100 wives to become prostitutes (after his death) as they were enamored seeing their step-son Samba. Krishna&#8217;s wives are then instructed by sage Dalbhya Caikitayana on how to lead their life in temple prostitution. This chapter of Padma Purana is titled “The vows of Prostitutes”, the title of the chapter itself is a summary of the chapter which shows that temple prostitution is permissible in Hinduism,</p>
<p>Padma Purana 1.23.74b-87a “The Lord said: O Brahman, born from the lotus, in the same city there will be sixteen thousand wives of Vasudeva. Krsna, the universal soul, having eyes like those of a deer, the dignified scion of Yadu family, who had put the garland of Malati flowers on his head, and being adorned with his praiseworthy wives, will enjoy with them in a garden rich with flowers, and situated on the bank of a lake, in the spring season abounding in cuckoos and swarms of bees. Samba, Jambavatl’s son, adorned with all (kinds of ornaments), going along with the path nearby, really of the form of Cupid, will be longingly seen by the ladies and passion will be aroused in the hearts of them who will be tormented by the arrows of Cupid. He, the lord of the world, the omniscient master, having perceived it with his eye of contemplation, will say to them: “The evil being will kidnap you, since you have thus entertained the passion of love (for Samba) in my presence.” Then the revered lord, the cause of beings, the holder of the bow made of horn, being propitiated (by the ladies) tormented with the curse, will say this: “(You will observe) the vow, beneficial in the future, which sage Dalbhya, emancipator of the fishermen living in the north and of an unlimited (generosity of) mind will tell you.” Saying so and leaving them, the lord vanished. Then after a (long) time when the burden (on the earth as a result of the great Bharatawar) will be lightened and when the fight with clubs (among the Yadavas) will be over, when Kesava will have come back to the heaven, when the entire Yadu-family will be no more, when even Arjuna will be defeated by the thieves, when Krsna’s wives will be kidnapped and will be enjoyed by the fishermen for a hundred million years and when they will be (thus) tormented, a devout soul, Dalbhya by name, with great penance (to his credit) will come there.”</p>
<p>Padma Purana 1.23.91-121 “O revered sir, all of us have been perforce enjoyed by the evil beings; we have slipped from (i.e. erred in) our duty. You are our refuge. O brahmana, you have been formerly instructed by the intelligent Kesava. Why have we become prostitutes after having come in contact with the lord? <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">O you, whose wealth is penance, explain to us the duties of the prostitutes</span>.” I shall tell you what Dalbhya Caikitayana said to them. Dalbhya said: Formerly Narada approached you, who were proud, while (you were) sporting in the water of the Manasa lake. All of you were daughters of Agni and were the nymphs in olden days. Not saluting Narada through haughtiness you asked the sage conversant with deep and abstract meditation: “Advise us as to how Narayana will be our husband.” From him, this boon and this curse came forth (i.e. Narada gave this boon to and pronounced this curse on the ladies) in ancient days: “By giving a couple of beds with articles of gold (to a brahmana) on the twelfth day of the bright fortnight of Caitra and Vaisakha, Narayana will certainly be your husband (i.e. you will obtain Narayana as your husband); (and) since, you asked me (a question) without saluting me, due to your selfish addiction to your beauty and good fortune, you will be kidnapped by thieves and will become prostitutes.” Thus, due to the curse of Narada and also that of Kesava, all of you, deluded by passion, have become prostitutes. O you excellent ladies, listen, even now, to what I shall say. The lord of lords, the best speaker, formerly said to the hundreds and thousands of thousands of the wives of the demons, the Asuras (the evil spirits—enemies of gods), the sons of Diti and the goblins, when these (ladies) were married and enjoyed by force (by the gods), after hundreds of the Asuras and demons were killed by the gods in the war between gods and Asuras (that took place) in ancient days: “<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">O you devout and beautiful ladies, now live as prostitutes in king’s </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">residences and in temples of gods</span>; you will obtain your livelihood from the king and the master; and all of you will have good fortune as per your capacity. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">He, who enters your house with the fee should be served by you with attitude of love void of deceit</span>… At that time, he, having the five arrows as his soul (i.e. Cupid), will go (i.e. remain) near Hari. She should worship the lotus-eyed (god i.e. Visnu), followed by eulogies of Cupid. She should worship the feet (of the image of the deity saying:) ‘My salutation to Kama’; (she should worship) the shanks (saying:) ‘My salutation to Vaimohakarin’; (she should worship) the generative organ (of the image of the deity saying:) ‘My salutation to Kandarpanidhi…Having thus worshipped Govinda, the lord of the form of Ananga, the lady having made an offering with sandal, flowers and incense, and then having invited a Brahmana knowing customary observances, who has mastered the Vedas and who is without any deformity, and then having honoured him with adoration of sandal, flowers etc. she should give the brahmana rice of the measure of a prastha along with a pot of ghee, (saying:) ‘May Madhava be pleased’. <span style="color: #ff0000;">She should bear in mind that the best Brahmana, who has eaten well according to his sweet will, is Kamadeva meant for Rati. The lady should do whatever the best Brahmana desires</span>.”</p>
<p>Padma Purana 1.23.130b-142 “Then having circumambulated and allowed the best Brahmana to go, she should take all (the articles) like the bed, the seat, to the Brahmana’s house. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Since then whosoever comes to her house for sexual enjoyment should be similarly honoured on a Sunday and should always be adored. Thus till the thirteenth month arrives, she should gratify a Brahmana and then send him to his house</span>; with his permission (she may entertain) a handsome (person) till he arrives (to her residence). When she has a difficulty as a result of impurity due to child-birth or abortion or from the king or a difficulty due to divine or human (forces) or due to an eclipse, then she should offer herself according to her capacity, for fifty-eight times. This (vow) I have especially narrated to you, since this is the duty that should be always performed by the prostitutes in this world…”</p>
<p>Sage Dalbhya instructs them to lead prostitution just like Indra had commanded the wives of slain demons mentioned in Matsya Purana 71.26-59 which I have already mentioned in Sex Slaves category, readers are requested to read Matsya Purana 71.26-59 again to better understand this.  Agni Purana 211.37-43 also talks about gifting female slaves to Brahmins which I have mentioned in Sex Slaves category.</p>
<p>Krishna states what is done to women by priests in Soma sacrifice,</p>
<p>Garuda Purana 3.28.79 &#8220;Neither men nor women nor ascetics have any dread or shame in this respect. Men can copulate even with their sisters, that too at the day time, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">just as the priests do with the women at the Soma sacrifice</span>.’’ Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>There is a story of a Rishi named Galava who engaged his daughter into prostitution just to get horses, The story is very long and mentioned in three different sections of Mahabharata hence it’s not possible to mention every detail but I will post the summarized version created by Ibn Muhammad,</p>
<p>Mahabharata Udyog Parva section 115 “She is my daughter. She is extremely beautiful and virtuous. She is desired by every male in three worlds. She can charm any Sur, Asur, Aryan or non-Aryan. I offer my daughter to you. You can sell her to any king and manage to have your gurudakhshina.”</p>
<p>Mahabharata Udyog Parva, Section 116 “So, Rishi Galav, without any qualms of conscience, accepts the king’s daughter and mortgages her to Ayodhya’s king Haryashaw and in return gets 200 horses. He takes 200 horses, leaving Madhavi to bear a son to the king.”</p>
<p>Mahabharata Udyog Parva, sections 117 and 118 “The Rishi Galav then searched another buyer for Madhavi and this time it is king Divodas who gives 200 horses in the bargain. (Udyog Parv, section117). Then he takes her to king Ushinao and manages to strike a better bargain. He receives now 400 horses. (Udyog Parv, section 118).</p>
<p>There is a story mentioned in Brahma Purana that says that Devas exchanged Saraswati with the Asuras for Soma Ras</p>
<p>Brahma Purana Gautami Mahatmya 35.6-13 “…If Devas are prepared let them come there for sacrifice. Gandharvas are always fond of women. Exchange me for Soma”. ”So be it”, said Devas who firmly agreed to what was said by Sarasvati. Through the messengers they invited Devas, Yaksas, Gandharvas and Nagas severally to the sacred mountain. There-after, O sage, the name of that mountain became Devagiti. There came Devas, Gandharvas, Yaksas, Raksasas, Siddhas, sages and the eight species of inferior gods… [Indra said] Exchange the nectar-souled Soma of yours for Saraswati. [Brahma said] At the instance of Indra those Gandharvas, passionate over women, gave Soma to Devas and took Saraswati. Devas possessed Soma and Gandharvas possessed Saraswati.” Tr. Board of Scholars, Edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti states that a group must earn their livelihood by doing Mujra and public women (prostitution),</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti 16.12 “Vaidehakas must earn their livelihood by keeping [dancing girls and other public] women and profiting by what they acquire.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>

<p>Written by Sulaiman Razvi</p>
<p>Why do Hindu women cover their head especially during worship? Have you noticed that a lot of Hindu women covers their head while offering prayers, meeting their elders? Hindus say that it is done to pay respect. Although veiling is not ordained in Hinduism like in Islam but some texts suggests that covering head or veiling was also common among Hindu women in Puranik period. Hijab is mentioned in the Quran and not Niqab (face veil) although face veil is also acceptable. According to <a href="http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/many-women-have-no-say-in-marriage/article5801893.ece" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">The Hindu<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> report, 60% of women in India practice face/head covering, the highest is in Rajasthan where 96% of women practice head/face covering, in Bihar it is 91% and in Haryana &amp; Madhya Pradesh the percentage is 88% while Muslim population in these states are just 9.1%. 16.9%, 7% and 6.6% respectively. We can find examples of women covering their head or wearing veil in Hindu scriptures. Hindu goddess Parvati is said to have covered her face with a garment while meeting sage Narada,<br />
<span id="more-1107"></span></p>
<p>Padma Purana I.43.128b-133b &#8220;Joining her lotus-like hands and <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><span style="color:#ff0000;text-decoration:underline;">concealing her face the beloved of the Mountain saluted the sage</span></span>, a heap of lustre&#8230;Then the respectable daughter of the Himalaya mountain, whose mind was amazed, saw the sage Narada of wonderful form. The sage also addressed her with (these) affectionate words: &#8216;Come, O daughter&#8217;. But embracing the father, she sat on his lap. The mother said to the respectable girl: &#8216;O daughter, salute the revered sage, blessed with penance. (Thereby) you will obtain a husband of your liking&#8217;. Thus addressed by her mother, <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><span style="color:#ff0000;text-decoration:underline;">she, having covered her face with her garment</span></span> and with her slightly trembling, did not utter any word.&#8221; Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p>Sati the first wife of Hindu god Shiva is also said to have practiced veiling, Brahma said,<br />
Shiva Purana, Rudra Samhita 2, Satikhanda section II, Chapter 19, verses 26-27 &#8220;Then, O sage, afflicted by the cupid and delighted in the heart of hearts, <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><span style="color:#ff0000;text-decoration:underline;">I lifted her veil and stared into the face of Sati</span></span>. I looked at the face of Sati many a time&#8230;&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Mahabharata says that Draupadi veiled herself properly while addressing sage Narada,<br />
Mahabharata Adi Parva 1, Section 210, verses 14-16 &#8220;Hearing of the <em>Rishi&#8217;s</em> arrival Draupadi, purifying herself properly, came with a respectful attitude to where Narada was with the Pandavas. The virtuous princess of Panchala, worshipping the celestial <em>Rishi&#8217;s</em> feet, stood with joined hands before him, <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><span style="color:#ff0000;text-decoration:underline;">properly veiled</span></span>, The illustrious Narada, pronouncing various benedictions on her, commanded the princess to retire.&#8221; Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Some verses about women veiling themselves,</p>
<p>Valmiki Ramayana, Yuddha Khanda 6, Sarga 111, verses 63-64 &#8220;O Lord! Are you not indeed enraged, in seeing me on foot in this way out through the city-gate, unveiled and come on foot in the way? O lover of your consorts! <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><span style="color:#ff0000;text-decoration:underline;">Look at all your spouses, who came out, with their veils dropped off</span></span>. Why are you not getting enraged in seeing this?&#8221; Tr. K.M.K. Murthy</p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 9.18.1-26 &#8220;&#8230;O Nârada! Seeing S&#8217;ankhachûda coming near to her, Tulasî covered her face by her clothing and she&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijananda</p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 9.19.2-94 &#8220;&#8230;The king S&#8217;ankhachûda then attracted his dear Tulasî to his breast and <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><span style="color:#ff0000;text-decoration:underline;">took off the veil fully from her face</span></span> and began to look on that, next moment he kissed on her cheek and lips and gave her a pair of garments brought from the Varuna&#8217;s house&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>You may have seen pictures of Hindu goddess Sita with her head covered by her Saree or other cloth. Valmiki Ramayana, Kishkindha Kanda 4, Sarga 6, verse 11 says that Sita dropped her upper cloth (Uttariya) and jewellery while being abducted so that her husband may find her by tracing her belongings. The Sanskrit word Uttariya has several meanings like shawl, scarf, upper garment. But since she used to wear Saree, so the upper garment here refers to scarf with which she used to cover her head. Manmath Nath Dutt also translates the word Uttariya as scarf here,</p>
<p>Valmiki Ramayana, Kishkindha Kanda 4, Sarga 6, verses 11-12 &#8220;Seeing me along with my four counsellors stationed at the hill, she dropped down her scarf and her ornaments. All these, O Raghava, I have taken and kept (with me. I will bring them. It behoveth thee to recognise them.&#8221; Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>It is mentioned in Tulsi Ramayana,<br />
Ramcharitmanas Doha 116, Chaupai 1-4 &#8220;&#8230;The one who is artless in manners and has a fair and graceful form is called Lakshamana and is my younger brother-in-law. Again veiling Her moon-like face with an end of Her sari She looked at Her beloved lord&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Gita Press</p>
<p>Bhavabhuti a 8th century scholar too refers to Sita&#8217;s veil in his Mahavira Charitra. It is further mentioned in the Mahavir Charitra Act 2 Page 71 that When Purshuram comes, Rama tells his wife Sita that &#8220;He is our elder, please lower your gaze, and put on the veil&#8221;. A 7th century C.E poet named Magha in his Sisupalavadha V.17 described the women of Krishna&#8217;s household as wearing a veil.</p>

<p>Some fanatic Hindus who are unaware of the violent passages in their book often mock other religious texts by misinterpreting them. They have no idea how violent Vedas are. Vedas are terror manual which turns humans into savages. Many tribes were destroyed as a result of the violent passages in Vedas. As per Vedas, you must kill a person who rejects Vedas, who hates Vedas and Ishwar, who does not worship, who does not make offerings to ishwar, who insults god (Blasphemy), one who oppresses a Brahmin etc. There are several passages in Vedas which calls for death of disbelievers. I am mostly using Arya Samaji translations of Satya Prakash Saraswati, Satyakam Vidyalankar, Devi Chand, Vaidyanath Shastri, Kshemkarand Das Trivedi, Swami Dayanand Saraswati, Shripad Damodar Satvalekar, and orthodox translations of Swami Karpatri and Shri Ram Sharma Acharya (Gayatri Parivar) and I will be using Griffith’s translation as well followed by Hindi translation of Hindu scholars. In the Vedas you will find numerous words to denote non-Hindus such as Adeva, Adevayu which means Godless, anindra which means against Indra, Ayajyu, Ayajvan which means unsacrifcing, Abrahman, Anyavrata which means followers of other gods, apavrata, avrata which means riteless, devanid which means haters of gods, Brahmadvish which means haters of devotion and those who denounce Vedas.</p>
<p><span id="more-746"></span></p>
<p>Rig Veda 9.13.9 “May you (O love divine), the beholder of the path of enlightenment, purifying our mind and destroying the infidels who refuse to offer worship, come and stay in the prime position of the eternal sacrifice.” Tr. SatyaPrakash Saraswati</p>
<p>Rig Veda 7.6.3 “May the fire divine chase away those infidels, who do not perform worship and who are uncivil in speech. They are niggards, unbelievers, say no tribute to fire divine and offer no homage. The fire divine turns those godless people far away who institute no sacred ceremonies.” Tr. SatyaPrakash Saraswati</p>
<p>Rig Veda 9.63.5 ”Augmenting the strength of resplendent self, urging the waters and rejuvenating all noble acts and destroying the infidels.” Tr. SatyaPrakash Saraswati</p>
<p><strong>One who does not offer Sacrifice is inhuman</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 8.70.11 “May your friend, the cloud, hurl that infidel down from heaven who differs from us in rites and rituals, is inhuman, who does not observe fire sacrificials, and who does not show reverence to Nature’s bounties.” Tr. SatyaPrakash Saraswati</p>
<p>Rig Veda 7.97.9 “O Lord of knowledge, this laudation is for you…destroy the godless and the malice of our enemy.” Tr. SatyaPrakash Saraswati</p>
<p>Killing Avrata,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 9.73.8 &#8220;&#8230;he, the all-wise, looks over all worlds; he censures those who are hostile in action, and who do not offer sacrifices and render no public good.&#8221; Tr. Svami Satyaprakash Sarasvati</p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.84. 8 When will he trample, like a weed, the man [Infidel] who hath no gift for him…</p>

<p><strong>ALL NON HINDUS ARE DEMONS, BARBARIANS.</strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="417" height="523" class="wp-image-7296" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/https-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2014-05-tole.jpeg" alt="https://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/tolerance-hinduism-buddhism-jainism-zoroastrianism-false-religions-untitld.jpg?w=417&amp;h=523" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/https-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2014-05-tole.jpeg 417w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/07/https-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2014-05-tole-239x300.jpeg 239w" sizes="(max-width: 417px) 100vw, 417px" /></p>
<p>The reason it is important to know who are Demons in Hinduism is because Hindu apologists find no problem with violent verses in the Veda because it says to kill ‘Demon’, they just say that these verses are referring to Demons and not to non-Hindus and try to get rid of the argument. As I said earlier Hindu apologists usually takes violent verses in lighter vein because it says to kill demons. Vedas are said to be eternal, now the question is if those verses were applicable only to Demons then it means that those verses have become useless now. So why God revealed such verses for limited period of time in the eternal book?</p>
<p>Swami Dayanand Saraswati wrote,”The Dwijaas( the twice-born) – Braahmanaas, Kshatriyas, Vaishyaas are called Aryas, while the Shudras are called Anaryas, or Non-Aryas.”ATHARVA VEDA 19:62. In the face ofthese Vedic authorities how can sensible people believe in the imaginary tales of the foreigners. In the Devaasurawars, Prince Arjuna and King Dashrathaand others of Aryavarta used to go to the assistance of the Aryas in order to crush the Asuras. This shows that the people living outside Aryavarta were called Dasyus and Malechhaas… Besides, Manu also corroborates our position. He says, “The countries other than Aryavarta are called Dasyus and Malechha countries.” MANU 10:45, 2:23. The people living in the north-east, north, north-west were called Rakshasas.” Satyarth Prakash, by Dayanand Saraswati, Ch 8, page 266, Tr. Chrinajiva Bhardwaja</p>
<p>Dasyu and Rakshasa mean demon. Here Swami Dayanand quoting Manu Smriti says that all people living outside Aryavrata and those who do not belong to four castes are demons (Rakshasa, Dasyu) and barbarians (Mleccha). According to Hindu Dharma all the non Hindus are demons and barbarians. Here is the full translation of Manu Smriti,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 10.45 All those tribes in this world, which are excluded from (the community of) those born from the mouth, the arms, the thighs, and the feet (of Brahman), are called Dasyus, whether they speak the language of the Mlekkhas (barbarians) or that of the Aryans.</p>
<p>Now some say that this doesn’t refer to Non-Hindus but to caste Hindus who lost their status on account of their neglecting their religious rites which lead them to loss of caste. They aren’t convinced even after providing explanation by their own scholar. Maybe they didn’t read verse 43 of this chapter 10 which says that by neglecting sacrifices the Dvijas made their successive generation fell to the status of Shudra not Dasyu. If Brahmins, Kshatriya, Vaishya and Shudra losing their caste made them Dasyu, the question is why they aren’t regarded as outcaste but as Dasyu? Because verse 43 and 45 aren’t correlated. Verse 45 is plain and clear that those tribe outside the pale of four Varnas are Dasyu and non-Hindus aren’t included in the four castes. Manu Smriti 10.45 also refutes the claim of apologists who claim that Dasyu means non-Human beings since Manu 10.45 states that Dasyu can be from four castes also who has abandoned their Vedic religion (if we go by the explanation of apologists) since they claim that Dasyu refers to demons only. Hindu scriptures from Veda to Purana mentions demon, so where are all those demons now? Dayanand Saraswati wrote,</p>
<p>“You can still see that the description of Raakshasas given therein tallies with the ugly appearance of the negroes of today.” <strong>Satyarth Prakash, by Dayanand Saraswati, Ch 8, page 266, Tr. Chrinajiva Bhardwaja</strong></p>
<p>So he is comparing Rakshasa with present day Negroes (black people) we can ascertain from this line that people living in north east and north west were not really monsters but were native people who are described in such racist manner. Swami Prabhupada also wrote,</p>
<p>Swami Prabhupada writes: “…An atheist is called a demon, and it is a fact that even a person born of good parents can turn into a demon by bad association…” <strong>Swami Prabhupada on Srimad Bhagavatam 3.3.6</strong><br />
<a href="http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_3.3.6" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_3.3.6<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>An Indologist wrote about Dasyu,</p>
<p>“The picture of the dasyu that emerges from these passages is quite different from that of the raksas. There is nothing about taking the form of a bird and flying by night, no mention of disrupting sacrifices, and no connection with black magic. The dasyus seem to be human beings of a different race from the Aryans and of a different (adevic and abrahamanic) religion. The mention of the proper names of various dasyus who are defeated for (or by) certain Aryan princes (e.g. Dabhiti) also makes the dasyu sound more like historical figures. There are occasional mentions of taking land from the dasyus (RV 4.38.1). The mention of dasyus in connection with fortresses (pur-) is also a characteristic which is in contrast to the raksases. Raksases do not build fortresses and fight from them. It seems quite safe to agree with the general conclusion of Vedic scholars that dasyu refers to the indigenous people of the land whom the invading Aryans conquered or absorbed.” <strong>by Wash Edward Hale, p.154, Asura in Early Vedic Religion, Published by Motilal Banarsidass Publisher, 1986.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moreover the Aryans were engaged in battle against the Dasyus and the reason given is Dasyus sings no [Vedic] hymns; Dasyus are riteless, Dasyus have alien laws; Dasyus differs from rites and rituals and doesn’t observe fire sacrifices; Dasyus are faithless, niggars, without belief, sacrifice and worship. The main reason given to fight them is that Dasyus do not offer any gifts to Vedic deities and Indra was often invoked to wage a war against the Dasyu. Refer my article <a href="/index.php/2019/03/20/violence-in-hinduism/" data-wpel-link="internal">Killing infidels in Hinduism</a> for references. Dasa and Dasyu has been synonymously used in the Vedas. The Persian word <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dahae" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Dahae<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> maybe related to the Dasyu tribe mentioned in the Vedas. “The Dahae were a Scythian people of ancient Central Asia. A confederation of three tribes – the Parni, Xanthii and Pissuri – the Dahae lived in an area now comprising much of modern Turkmenistan. The area has consequently been known as Dahestan, Dahistan and Dihistan” [end quote]. The word Parni is also believed to be the Iranian word for Panis tribe. The Panis and Dasyu may be have been closely related to each other that’s the reason they are mentioned together in Rig Veda 7.6.3; 5.34.6. Many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dasa" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Indologists<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> have also opined that Dasa were a tribe of humans not demons. Apologist pathetic response would be that Dasyu in the Veda are described as having numerous eyes and hands which is a proof that they were demons. Even Rishis who are said to be humans are described in some texts as of having three heads, Vedic deities as of having face of horse, animal getting pregnant after drinking semen of Rishis, does that prove that Rishis and Vedic deities were also demons? Hindus have a long history of using epithets against other religions, the Aryans used to consider Dasyu as Anasa which literally translates to noseless but it actually means flat nosed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now let’s move on to Panis tribe. Panis too are described as Demons, but Yaska in Nirukta also calls them Merchant (Nirukta 2.17). Panis tribe were rich traders and they were consistently attacked by Aryans to plunder them since they did not patronize the priests who then invoked Vedic gods to attack Panis. Apologists gives lame excuse, when defending verses about killing and plundering Panis tribe, all that they say is Panis were demons and doesn’t explain the part where Aryans plundered them and were the first to fight the Panis tribe. If they were demons then why Aryans were so eager to get their donations? Veda reiterates that Panis brings no gifts to Vedic deities, so why crave for their wealth if they were so demonic in nature? Veda also mentions a member of Panis community named Bribu who is praised in Rig Veda 6.45.31 because he is said to have gifted many cows to Rishi Bhardwaj (Manu Smriti 10.107) in which he is referred to as a carpenter. Now all of a sudden a Panis member is praised, what’s the reason? Because the reason to kill and plunder them is clearly given in Atharva Veda 20.93.2 that the Panis brings no gifts, had they given donations like Panis Bribu then they would’ve been spared and would’ve also been praised in the Vedas. Panis were rich merchants, they also had carpenters they used to rear cattle, engaged in trade and amassed wealth. These are the characteristics of humans not demons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kikata too were plundered like Dasyu and Panis tribes because they didn’t observe Vedic rituals and didn’t make donations to Vedic deities. Veda also mentions Zoroastrians and calls them demons (Asura). The Asuras mentioned in Vedas are non other than Zoroastrians. They are actually Ahura worshippers (Zoroastrians). Vedic religion and Zoroastrianism are roughly of the same age they have many similarities like Vedic Yagna is called Yasna in Zoroastriniasm, Soma is Homa, Deva in Veda are positive while Daeva in Zoroastrianism is neutral to negative, Zoroastrian text also mentions Aryans. From Rig Veda Mandal 1 to 7, Vedic deities are also called as Asur but the definition when applied to Vedic deities is ‘Mighty’. When the Aryans moved from Central Asia to India they brought with them the memories, thus the word Asura is used till Rig Veda Mandal 7 as a praiseworthy word. And then it was turned negative and was also used later to describe enemies residing in eastern part of India such as Bengal and Assam like Asura king Naraka of Pragiyotisapura in Assam or Mahishasura. There’s also a tribe in India named <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/meeting-the-asurs-a-marginal-tribe-in-eastern-india/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Asur people<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> who claim themselves to be descendants of Mahishasura.</p>
<p>People of Lanka in Ramayana has been described as Demons. Hanuman burned hundreds of demons inhabiting Lanka for no fault of their when Ram’s enmity was towards Ravana and not towards inhabitants of Lanka. Ramayana makes no mention of humans residing in Lanka but refers to the people of Lanka as demons. Go to Sri Lanka and tell me how many demons you found there or at least try to find their bones.</p>
<p>Now let’s move on to the Puranas, which is the most important point here. Many Puranas especially Vishnu Purana book 3 chapters 17 &amp; 18 states that demons embraced Buddhism and Jainism. The reason I quote Vishnu Purana again and again is because two chapters of this scripture are dedicated in denigrating Buddhism and Jainism and gives a picture of how Hinduism perceives other religions. Hindu text says that demons embraced Buddhism. Their disciples and disciples would continue to preach this religion. Now as you may know Buddhism’s history is not unknown like Hinduism’s. We know who its founder was and when Buddhism was founded, we know that its founder really existed and was not a mythological figure. Buddhism was founded in the 6<sup>th</sup> century B.C. It was a time when humans had started recording history. So you tell me did any Greek, Roman or any traveller ever recorded that demons used to live in India and they embraced Buddhism as stated in Hindu scriptures? So what Hindus did is nothing but demonization of their enemies. Hinduism recognizes many tribes and Dasyus, Panis, Yavana… were among them and they have been demonized because as mentioned in Manu (10.45) all those who do not belong to four castes are Dasyu and Malechas. Now some also justify violent verses of Vedas saying that all violent verses about killing godless, riteless, those who do not offer gifts actually refers to demons and not to human beings and that demons were averse to humanity. An Asura named Rambha who was the father of Mahishasur was a devotee of Vedic deity Agni. Vishnu Purana bk 3 ch 17-18 states that demons were Vedic followers who couldn’t be killed unless they apostatizes from Vedic Dharma and embraces other religions like Buddhism and Jainism. So what these incidents prove is that even demons could follow Vedic religion but still that wouldn’t make them Hindus or Humans since Hinduism believes in birth based and only those belonging to four castes can be considered Vedic followers. So this refutes the claim that demons were averse to Devas or Humanity.</p>
<p>It is mentioned in Sutras,</p>
<p>Apastamba Sutra, Prasna I, Patala 9, Khanda 27.11 The expression Krishna Varna, ‘the black race,’ is truly Vedic. In the Rig-veda it usually denotes the aboriginal races, and sometimes the demons.</p>
<p>Vedas also states that the one who offers no worship is inhuman, wicked, evil, miser etc.,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 9.20.5 “Preserve us from the reproach of every one, who makes no offerings, is vicious and wicked and who utters ill words, so that we may be free (from anxiety).” Tr. SatyaPrakash Saraswati</p>
<p>Shouldn’t Ishwar be friendly with entire creation? Why Ishwar is friendly only with those who make offerings? Was it invented by Rishis to get wealth in the name of god? What about the poor people who don’t even have money to feed their children. Will Ishwar forgive them or punish them as he commands to kill those who doesn’t pour gifts.</p>
<p><strong>Beheading the Demons (Non Hindus)</strong></p>

<p><strong>DEATH TO THOSE WHO DOESN’T POUR GIFTS TO ISHWAR</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 6.44.11 “Give us not, O showerer of benefits, to the wicked. Relying upon your friendship, O Lord of riches, may we remain unharmed.

<p>This verse refers to the Panis tribe, according to some scholars the Panis tribe were also part of the Vedic society but were plundered and killed because they made no offerings to Ishwar, this is why they are considered Niggards. But Yaska gives a different meaning, Yaska writes that Panis tribe were Demons. One is not to be deluded by the usage of the word Demon here as Demons and Barbarians are those who does not follow the Veda or who lives beyond the boundaries of Aryavarta. The Vedic followers are commanded here to crush the Panis tribe only because they make no offerings to Vedic Gods. There are more evidences to show that tribes were plundered and killed just because they made no offerings to Vedic gods.</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 20.56.6 These people, Indra, keep for thee all that is worthy of thy choice. Discover thou, as Lord, the wealth of men who offer up no gifts: bring thou to us this wealth of theirs.</p>

<p>Rig Veda 4.25.7 (Indra), the drinker of the effused Soma, contracts no friendship with the wealthy trader who offers not any libation ; he takes away his wealth ; destroys him when destitute; but he is a special (friend) to him who presents the libation and oblation.</p>

<p>Rig Veda 5.34.8 When Indra, the possessor of opulence, discriminates between two men, both wealthy, and exerting themselves (against each other) for the sake of valuable cattle, he takes one of them [The one who performs Yajna] as his associate, causing (his adversaries) to tremble, and the agitator (of the clouds), together with the Maruts, bestows upon him herds of cattle.</p>

<p>Other verses shows that Ishwar provides protection to those who make offerings to him, but Ishwar slays the person who doesn’t worship or make offerings. Why is Ishwar behaving like a thug? Shouldn’t Ishwar be equal and friendly to everyone irrespective of their offerings? All the verses I quoted above orders to kill those who make no offerings, there are several instances in Vedas wherein tribesmen were killed just because they made no offering to Ishwar,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 3.53.14 “O bounteous Lord, of what avail are the cattle of infidels to you. Neither they yield milk nor do these faithless persons kindle sacred fire. May you bring wealth of these unbelievers to us and give us possession of people of low mortality and crush them.” Tr. SayaPrakash Saraswati</p>
<p>This verse is referring to the Kikata tribe who were plundered by Vedic heroes and killed. Maharishi Yaska explains this as,</p>
<p>Nirukta 6.32 What are the cows doing in Kikata? Kikata is the name of a country where the non-Aryans dwell. Non-Aryan tribes are (so called because it is said),’What have they done? Or their assumption is that religious rites are useless. They neither get the milk to mix with the soma, nor kindle fire.</p>
<p>Here the Vedic god is invoked to plunder the cows of of Kikata people and to plunder the wealth of the king of Kikata tribe. As I said earlier, many tribes were plundered and looted by Vedic gods just because they made no offering to Ishwar, Kikata and Panis tribes are few examples. Here is another translation by Arya Samaj,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 3.53.14 “O learned king! you possess admirable wealth, what do the cattle do among the atheists because they have no faith in the Vedic teachings and rites or in place inhabited by them. They yield no milk to mix with the Soma, and do not perform the Yajna with the ghee of the cows. Therefore, bring them to us, so that we may use them for hospitality (giving the milk mixed with Soma) to teachers and preachers. Give us wealth taken away from the wicked persons for the use of those who hailing from a good family come to us. Remove far away from us a man who uses his power for doing mean or inglorious acts or keep him under us.” Tr. Acharya Dharma Deva Vidya Martanda</p>
<p><strong>Swami Dayanand Saraswati wrote on this verse</strong>, “As the cows do not grow among the wicked atheists, in the same manner, Dharma and other virtues do not grow among the persons lacking faith. Among the enlightened persons atheists can never have the upper hand. Therefore, good scholars should blot out atheism.” Tr. Acharya Dharma Deva Vidya Martanda</p>

<p>Is it right to kill someone just because they hate you or Ishwar? What kind of God is Ishwar who commands to kill the person who just hates him. The above verse explicitly says to be the first one to kill those who just ‘Hate’ you. Is this justifiable? If you just oppress a Brahmin you are liable to be killed according to Vedas, but the Brahmin can kill you, deprive you of your property, there is no sin in this, but oppressing a Brahmin is a grave sin in Vedas,</p>

<p>Poor Shudra’s fate is to be oppressed by Brahmins,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 8.417 A Brahmana may confidently seize the goods of (his) Sudra (slave); for, as that (slave) can have no property, his master may take his possessions.</p>
<p>Maharishi Manu says that a Brahmin can even kill anyone who hurts him without bringing notice to the King,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 9.31-33 A Brahmana who knows the law need not bring any (offence) to the notice of the king; by his own power alone be can punish those men who injure him. His own power is greater than the power of the king; the Brahmana therefore, may punish his foes by his own power alone. Let him use without hesitation the sacred texts, revealed by Atharvan and by Angiras; speech, indeed, is the weapon of the Brahmana, with that he may slay his enemies.</p>

<p>Hindu god Vishnu says,</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 3.17 When the glorious Vishnu heard their prayers he emitted from his person an illusory form wliich he gave to the celestials and said. “This illusory form shall so deceive the Daityas, so that being led astray from the path of the Vedas, they may be put to death ; for all gods, demons and others, who shall transgress the authority of the Veda, shall perish by my prowess which I exercise for the preservation of the universe. Go then ; be not affraid ; this illusory form shall go before you. celestials, it shall be of great service to you, this day.</p>
<p>Veda also commands to kill the enemies of Vedas,</p>

<p>Griffith has translated the word Brahmadvish as “Haters of Prayer/devotion” which is also correct but the definition “Those who hate Vedas” is precisely correct, other correct definition is ‘Enemies of Vedas’. Dayanand Saraswati founder of Arya Samaj gives the following meaning,</p>

<p>It is mentioned in Bhagwad Purana (Srimad Bhagvatam)</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagvatam 4.4.17 Sati continued: If one hears an irresponsible person blaspheme the master and controller of religion, one should block his ears and go away if unable to punish him. But if one is able to kill, then one should by force cut out the blasphemer’s tongue and kill the offender, and after that one should give up his own life.</p>
<p>ISKCON scholar writes on this verse,</p>
<p>“If possible she should have cut out Daksha’s tongue because he blasphemed Lord Siva. In other words, since Lord Siva is the protector of religion, a person who vilifies him should be killed at once, and after killing such a person, one should give up one’s life…The instruction set forth here in Srimad-Bhagavatam is that one should not tolerate at any cost the activities of a person who vilifies or blasphemes an authority. If one is a Brahmana he should not give up his body because by doing so he would be responsible for killing a Brahmana; therefore a Brahmana should leave the place or block his ears so that he will not hear the blasphemy. If one happens to be a Kshatriya he has the power to punish any man; therefore a Kshatriya should at once cut out the tongue of the vilifier and kill him. But as far as the Vaisyas and Sudras are concerned, they should immediately give up their bodies.” [<a href="http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_4.4.17" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right"> http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_4.4.17 <span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>]

<p>Read new article <a href="/index.php/2019/03/29/scientific-errors-in-hinduism/" data-wpel-link="internal">Scientific Errors in Hinduism</a></p>
<p>Hindus have become very enthusiastic in finding science in their holy books after they learnt that other religious texts have scientific facts. They are reinterpreting it, they are not aware of the fact that the writers of the Vedas were ignorant of science, as a result the Vedas contain several scientific errors. Ishwar should have studied kindergarten books, I am sure Vedas would have been scientific if he did that.</p>

<p><strong>EARTH IS IMMOVABLE/FIXED</strong></p>
<p>Atharva Veda 6.77.1 &#8220;The heavens have stood, the earth has stood, all creatures have stood. The mountains have stood upon their<br />
foundation, the horses in the stable I have caused to stand.&#8221; Tr. Maurice Bloomfield</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="681" height="246" class="wp-image-7396" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021.jpeg" alt="http://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/060218_0650_testingscie1.jpg" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021.jpeg 681w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-300x108.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 681px) 100vw, 681px" /></p>
<p>Some apologists argue that that the word &#8220;Asthaat&#8221; means &#8220;steady&#8221; and not fixed or standing still, this doubt can be cleared from the following verse,</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 6.44.1 &#8220;The heavens have stood still, the earth has stood still, all creatures have stood still. The trees that sleep erect have stood still: may this disease of thine stand still!&#8221; Tr. Maurice Bloomfield <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="595" height="72" class="wp-image-7397" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021.png" alt="http://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/060218_0650_testingscie2.png" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021.png 595w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-300x36.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 595px) 100vw, 595px" /></p>
<p>Above is Shripad Damodar Satvalekar&#8217;s Hindi translation and below is Kshemkarandas Trivedi&#8217;s translation,</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="556" height="138" class="wp-image-7398" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-1.png" alt="http://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/060218_0650_testingscie3.png" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-1.png 556w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-1-300x74.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 556px) 100vw, 556px" /></p>
<p>Both the Hindi verses translated by Kshemkaran Das Trivedi and Shripad Damodar Satvalekar has translated the word Asthaat as &#8220;Tehri hai&#8221; which means standing still but some people tries to twist this verse in the following way.<br />

<p>Scholar has cleverly translated the word &#8220;Prithvyasthaad&#8221; [Prithvi+Asthaat] as &#8220;Earth is firm&#8221; but then translates the same word as standing still [Tehra hai] when it comes it Trees and Malady. Atharva Veda 6.44.1 is a prayer to stop malady, it says that just as Earth is standing still, trees are standing still, world is standing still, the same way make this malady stand still. Now if we go with apologists definition then it would be like &#8220;Let this malady of your stand firm&#8221; and that would be illogical, isn&#8217;t it? If it&#8217;s just about firmness then why does it talk about trees? doesn&#8217;t trees shake with a gust of wind? Trees stands in its place and doesn&#8217;t move and it being compared to earth proves that earth is motionless according to Vedas.</p>

<p>An Indian scientist named Bhaskaracharya (1114-1185) wrote,</p>
<p>&#8221;As heat is an inherent property of the Sun and of Fire, as cold of the Moon, fluidity of water, and hardness of stones, and as the air is volatile, so the earth is naturally immovable. For oh! the properties existing on things are wonderful.&#8221;-Siddhanta Shiromani Goladhyaaya of Bhaskaracharya, Bhuvankosh, Shloka 5</p>
<p>Many verses clearly uses the word Drdh दृढ which means fixed but Hindus argue that it means firm, whether Drdh means fixed or firm can be better understood after reading Rig Veda 8.78.5; 10.173.4; Atharva Veda 6.88.1, 20.34.2, 19.32.9, 13.1.6-7 and Yajur Veda 1.17 which says the Earth is Fixed. The Atharva Veda 6.77.1 and 6.44.1 explicitly states that Earth is standing still (not moving). But still Hindus will argue that it doesn&#8217;t mean what it says. Then what was the logic behind Ishwar revealing so many verses on Earth&#8217;s &#8216;Stability&#8217;? It&#8217;s plain and clear, the earth is fixed according to the Vedas as proved from verses which says that Earth is standing still. Even if we accept their claim, then why does Vedas talk about Earth along with Heaven that the earth and heaven are firmly fixed? As per the Vedas both heaven and earth are immovable.</p>

<p>Rig Veda 1.35.9 &#8221;The gold-handed, all-beholding luminary travels between the two regions of heaven and earth, dispels diseases, and this, verily, is known as the sun, and it finally overspreads the sky, extending from the dark interspace to the celestial region&#8221; Tr. SatyaPrakash Saraswati.</p>
<p>Maharshi Yaska writes,</p>
<p>Nirukta 7.23 The sun having first revolved towards the northern hemisphere, a person holds a polished (piece of) white copper, or crystal, focusing the sun-rays in a place where there is some dry cow-dung, without touching it… Now (had VaisVauara been the sun), there would have occurred expressions relating to VaisVanara in those same hymns and shares which are assigned to celestial deities, i.e. Savitr, [Surya], Pusan, Visnu, and [the VisVedevas.] And they would have praised him by (attributing to him) the functions of the sun, as thou risest, thou settest, thou revolvest, &amp;c.</p>
<p>We know the Sun does not revolve, it rotates in its axis.</p>
<p>Rig Veda 8.7.8 They, who by their might open a radiant path for the sun to travel, they pervade (the world) with lustre.</p>

Those Hindus should thoroughly think about this verse, it states the 7 horses (rays according to you) TAKES the Sun, logically does the rays takes the Sun? The Sun emits rays, it does not go after the rays. So this explanation of 7 horses as 7 rays is illogical. Moreover even the scholars are not sure whether this means 7 rays or horses while few other regard 7 horses as 7 days. Veda says that Vushab (Sun or Bull) has thousand rays not seven rays. Other Hindu text affirms that the Seven Horses are actual Horses, below are the references,</p>
<p>Mahabharata book 13.158.20-22 …the sun possessed of a thousand rays… He it is that constitutes the wheel of the year, having three naves and seven horses to drag it…He is the sun, the dispeller of all darkness.</p>
<p>Bhagwad Purana (Srimad Bhagavatam) 5.21.12-19 Thus the chariot of the sun-god, which is trayimaya, or worshiped by the words om bhur bhuvah svah, travels through the four residences…My dear King, the carriage of the sun-god&#8217;s chariot is estimated to be 3,600,000 yojanas [28,800,000 miles] long and one-fourth as wide [900,000 yojanas, or 7,200,000 miles]. The chariot&#8217;s horses, which are named after Gayatri and other Vedic meters, are harnessed by Arunadeva to a yoke that is also 900,000 yojanas wide. This chariot continuously carries the sun-god. Although Arunadeva sits in front of the sun-god and is engaged in driving the chariot and controlling the horses, he looks backward toward the sun-god…My dear King, in his orbit through Bhu-mandala [Earth],<br />
the sun-god traverses a distance of 95,100,000 yojanas [760,800,000 miles] at the speed of 2,000 yojanas and two krosas [16,004 miles] in a moment.</p>
<p>Devi Bhagwatam 8.15.40-45 …The seat of the Sun on his chariot measures 36 Lakh Yoyanas wide. The Yuga measures in length one fourth of the above dimensions, that of his seat. The Chariot is moved by seven horses, consisting of the seven Chhandas, Gâyatrî, etc., driven by Aruna. The horses carry the Sun for the happiness of all. Though the charioteer sits in front of the Sun, his face is turned towards the west. He does his work as a charioteer in that state…</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana 1.2.23.50-51 &#8221;He is served by Gandharvas and groups of celestial damsels by means of sons and dances. The lord of the day (i.e. the sun) thus revolves and wanders by means of horses that gallop and that are as swift as birds. The chariot of Soma (the Moon) has three wheels. His horses have the lustre of Kunda (white jasmine) flowers. They are ten in number and they are yoked to the left as well as to the right. The moon traverses by means of this.&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, Edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>From the above passages it doesn&#8217;t sound like the horses are rays but it signifies that the Sun LITERALLY travels on a chariot dragged by seven horses. They no where says that the sun&#8217;s chariot pulled by horses is an allegorical sentence, rather they say exactly what they Vedas states. If the 7 horses of the sun are the seven rays then what are the 10 horses of the moon? Does it mean the moon emits rays of its own? with additional 3 rays?</p>
<p>The Vedas also says the Sun hides</p>
<p>Rig Veda 3.49.5 Where as a Friend with friendly men, Navagvas, with heroes, on his knees he sought the cattle.here, verily with ten Dasagvas Indra found the Sun lying hidden in the darkness.</p>

<p>According to Vedic mythology a demon covers the Sun which causes solar eclipse.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rig Veda 5.40.5-6 O Sūrya, when the Asura&#8217;s descendant Svarbhanu, pierced thee through and through with darkness, All creatures looked like one who is bewildered, who knoweth not the place where he is standing. What time thou smotest down Svarbhanu&#8217;s magic that spread itself beneath the sky, O Indra, By his fourth sacred prayer Atri disoovered Sūrya concealed in gloom that stayed his function.</p>

<p><strong>How Rain Occurs</strong></p>
<p>&#8221;The oblation full of cooked articles put into the fire, goes up to the sky. And returns there from full of rain.&#8221;- Yajur Veda 3.49, Tr. Devi Chand, p.43.</p>
<p>&#8221;We perform the yajna for Vasus, Rudras and Adityas&#8230;The desired oblation (Ahuti) reaches the space, comes in contact with air and the light of that sun. It thence brings down rain for us&#8230;&#8221;- Yajur Veda 2.16, Tr. Devi Chand, p.32-33.</p>
<p>It is mentioned in Brahmana,</p>
<p>Maitrayana Brahmaya 6.37 … &#8216;The oblation which is properly thrown on the fire, goes toward the sun; from the sun comes rain&#8230;&#8221; It is mentioned in Manu Smriti</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 3.76. An oblation duly thrown into the fire, reaches the sun; from the sun comes rain, from rain food, therefrom the living creatures (derive their subsistence).</p>
<p>Krishna says in Gita,<br />
Gita 3.14-15 All living bodies subsist on food grains, which are produced from rains. Rains are produced by performance of yajña [sacriﬁce], and yajña is born of prescribed duties. Regulated activities are prescribed in the Vedas, and the Vedas are directly manifested from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Consequently the all-pervading Transcendence is eternally situated in acts of sacriﬁce.</p>
<p>A Hindu scholar writes why the Sky looks blue and also how rain occurs,</p>
<p>&#8221;6. Is it not ether, then, that you see in the sky above, blue and dusty?</p>
<p>A.- No.</p>
<p>Q.- What is it then?</p>
<p>A. It is the fine particles of earth, water and Agni (in the atmosphere). The blue colour is  mainly due to the particles of water in the atmosphere that come down as rain, while the dusty appearance is due to the particles of dust which is carried up from the earth and floats about the air. It is these things that are seen and reflected in water in a mirror, and not ether.&#8221;- Satyarth Prakash, Swami Dayanand Saraswati, Ch 8, p.276, Tr. Chiranjiva Bhardwaja.</p>
<p><strong>EARTH IS FLAT</strong></p>
<p>Suppose If you were to describe that the earth is flat, how would you explain it? You might say earth has ends, earth has four corners and it is four cornered. Every sane person will give this same answer. When you see the article on scientific errors in Bible on Hindu websites, they have no problem quoting a verse from the Bible which says earth has four corners, but have they ever wondered what their scripture says about it.</p>
<p>Rig Veda 7.83.3 The ends of the earth are beheld laid waste…<br />

<p>The word used in the above verse is Puthvi which means earth, some Hindus may try to escape the argument saying boundaries of Bhumi [land or earth] refers the actual boundaries of nations, but the above verse uses the term Puthvi which particularly refers to earth. The word boundary here is signifying the limits of Earth.</p>

<p><strong>Vedas explicitly states Earth is Four Cornered</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.58.3 Thy spirit, that went far away, away to the four cornered earth.<br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="526" height="37" class="wp-image-7461" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-31.png" alt="http://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/060218_0651_testingscie33.png" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-31.png 526w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-31-300x21.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 526px) 100vw, 526px" /></p>
<p>Word by Word Sansksrit translation,</p>
<p>यते [Yate] = Your</p>
<p>मन [Mann] = Spirit/Mind</p>
<p>जगाम [Jagaam] = Goes</p>
<p>दूरकम् [Durkam] = Far away</p>
<p>चतुर्भृष्टि [Chaturbhushti/Caturbhrsti] = Four Cornered</p>
<p>भूमि [Bhumi] = Earth</p>
<p>The word Chaturbhusti (also spelled Caturbhrsti) means Four cornered,</p>
<p>Monier-William&#8217;s Sanskrit dictionary also gives the same meaning</p>
<p><a href="http://sanskritdictionary.com/caturbh%E1%B9%9B%E1%B9%A3%E1%B9%ADi/78694/1" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">http://sanskritdictionary.com/caturbh%E1%B9%9B%E1%B9%A3%E1%B9%ADi/78694/1<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>Moreover the Brahmanas affirms this verse,</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahman 6.1.2.29 …Now this earth is four-cornered, for the quarters are her corners: hence the bricks are four-cornered; for all the bricks are after the manner of this earth.</p>
<p>Now, still some would argue that Rigved verse is not in literal sense and refers to earth as four cornered symbolically. If it really referred to earth as four cornered &#8221;Symbolically&#8221; then the Brahmanas would not have likened the shape of the earth with a brick. This verse from the Brahmanas could have been rejected if it was contradictory to the Vedas but both the Vedas and Brahmana says the same thing that the Earth if Four Cornered. A globe cannot have corners, These verses proves that earth is flat as per the Vedas.</p>

<p><strong>The Earth is stretched out</strong></p>
<p>There is no problem if the Vedas says the earth is stretched out, but after reading about the four cornered earth verses, these verses could be understood in a different manner that the earth is stretched out on all the four corners.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am reproducing some excerpts written by a Hindu scholar named Swami B.V. Giri. Who has proved Puranas and Itihas as part of the Vedas which is contrary to what Arya Samajis are promoting on the internet. He considers Puranas and Itihas to be the fifth Vedas, he has put forth this arguement on the basis of Vedas and other scriptures. According to Swami Giri Vedas are corrupted and 94% of the Vedas are lost, the present Vedas contain only 6% of the original text and there is no use of Vedas in this age thus Puranas are much superior than Vedas.<br />
<span id="more-1960"></span><br />
Written by Swami B.V. Giri</p>
<p><strong>OBJECTION: In your arguments you have mostly quoted <em>purana-vakya</em> (quotes from Puranic texts) to substantiate your points. However, this is unacceptable. The <em>Vedas</em> are eternal as they emanate from the Lord Himself (<em>apaurusaya</em>), whereas the <em>Puranas</em> and <em>smrti-sastras</em>, although they give knowledge about God, are authored by men. They are auxiliary to the <em>Vedas</em> and hence their statements should be considered as secondary when compared to the statements made in the <em>Vedas</em>. Therefore, in order to validate your claims, you must give quotes from <em>sruti</em> only.</strong></p>
<p><strong>REFUTATION:</strong> That the <em>Vedas</em> are eternal and <em>apauruseya</em> is a fact that all <em>sampradayas</em>, including the school of Sankara, unanimously agree with. They constitute the means of receiving knowledge about the Absolute Truth. However, there are certain factors that make it practically impossible to study the <em>Vedas</em> in this age:</p>
<p id="pWEIpKn"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="288" height="239" class="size-full wp-image-7205  alignleft" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/img_5f23fe9dbeb17.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>  After Srila Vyasadeva divided the <em>Vedas</em> into four books (<em>Rg, Yajur, Sama</em> and <em>Atharva</em>), his disciples further divided them into 1,130 divisions. This is stated in the <em>Kurma Purana</em> (52.19-20):</p>
<p class="verse"><em>eka-vimsati-bhedena rg-vedam krtavan pura<br />
sakhanam satenaiva yajur-vedam athakarot</em></p>
<p class="verse"><em>sama-vedam sahasrena sakhanam prabibheda sah<br />
atharvanam atho vedam bibedha navakena tu</em></p>
<p class="translation">‘Previously the <em>Rg Veda</em> was divided into 21 sections, the <em>Yajur Veda</em> into 100 sections, the <em>Sama Veda</em> into 1,000 sections and the <em>Atharva Veda</em> into 9 divisions.’</p>
<p>Each division has 4 minor divisions, namely the <em>Samhitas, Brahmanas, Aranyakas</em> and <em>Upanisads.</em> Thus altogether the 4 <em>Vedas</em> contain 1,130 <em>Samhitas,</em> 1,130 <em>Brahmanas,</em> 1,130 <em>Aranyakas,</em> and 1,130 <em>Upanisads.</em> This makes a total of 4,520 divisions.<br />
At present, most of these texts have disappeared due to the influence of time. We can only find 11 <em>Samhitas</em>, 18 <em>Brahmanas</em>, 7 <em>Aranyakas</em> and 220 <em>Upanisads</em> which constitutes a mere 6% of the entire Vedic canon!</p>
<ol>
<li>Even if the <em>Vedas</em> were complete in there entirety, in order to understand them one must first study the <em>Vedangas</em> which includes <em>Siksa</em> (the science of phonetics), <em>Vyakarana</em> (grammatical rules), <em>Kalpa</em> (ritualistic rules), <em>Nirukta</em> (obscure word meanings), <em>Chanda</em> (Metres for chanting Vedic hymns), and <em>Jyotisa</em> (astrology and astronomy).</li>
<li>Since the language of the <em>Vedas</em> is enshrouded in mysterious meanings, one must also be willing to sacrifice years of study in order to learn <em>Vaidika</em> (classical) Sanskrit. This entails primarily learning the basic grammar (which generally takes 12 years or so) and then memorising extra vocabulary in order to decipher the mystical language of the <em>Vedas</em>. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">1</span></li>
</ol>
<p>Apart from that, it is practically impossible for those born in the age of Kali (who are generally ‘<em>mandah sumanda-matayo</em>’) to memorise even the slightest thing. What to speak of the entire <em>Vedas</em> or even the 6% that still survives today! At present, amongst the <em>brahmana</em> communities in India, it is generally observed that <em>vedadhyayana</em> simply consists of memorising the text of one of the four <em>Vedas</em> ‘parrot-fashion’, but as we can see from above, there is much more to it than that. Therefore, we may conclude that although the <em>Vedas</em> are perfect <em>sabda-pramana</em>, it is impractical to become thoroughly conversant with the <em>Vedas</em> in this day and age in order to understand the Supreme. Hence the solution lies in the <em>Puranas</em> and the <em>Itihasas.</em> This is explained in the following verse &#8211;</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light">
<p class="verse"><em> bharata-vyapadesena hyamnayarthah pradarsitah<br />
vedah pratisthah sarve sarve purane natra samsayah</em></p>
<p class="translation">&#8220;On the pretext of writing the <em>Mahabharata</em>, Vyasa explained the meaning of the <em>Vedas</em>. Certainly all the topics of the <em>Vedas</em> have been established in the <em>Puranas.</em>&#8221; (<em>Visnu Purana</em>)</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is explained in the <em>Mahabharata</em> (<em>Adi Parva</em> 1.267) and <em>Manu Samhita</em> –</p>
<p class="verse"><em>itihasa puranabhyam vedam samupabrmhayet</em></p>
<p class="translation">&#8221; One must complement one’s study of the <em>Vedas</em> with the <em>Itihasas</em> and the <em>Puranas.</em>&#8220;</p>
<p>In the <em>Prabhasa-khanda</em> of the <em>Skanda Purana</em> (5.3.121-124) it is said –</p>
<p class="verse"><em>veda-van niscalam manye puranartham dvijottamah<br />
vedah pratisthitah sarve purane natra samsayah</em></p>
<p class="verse"><em>bibhety-alpa-srutad vedo mam ayam calayisyati<br />
itihasa-puranais tu niscalo’yam krtah purah</em></p>
<p class="verse"><em>yan na drstam hi vedesu tad drstam smrtisu dvijah<br />
ubhayor yan na drstam hi tat puranah pragiyate<br />
yo veda caturo vedan sangopanisado dvijah<br />
puranam naiva janati na ca sa syad vicaksana</em></p>
<p class="translation">&#8221; O best of the <em>brahmanas</em>, the meaning of the <em>Puranas</em> is unchanging just like that of the <em>Vedas</em>. The <em>Vedas</em> are all sheltered within the <em>Puranas</em> without a doubt. The <em>Veda</em> has a fear that unqualified people will read her and then distort her meaning. Thus, the significance of the <em>Veda</em> was fixed in the <em>Puranas</em> and <em>Itihasas.</em> That which is not found in the <em>Vedas</em> is found in the <em>Smrti</em>. That which is not found in the <em>Smrti</em> is to be found in the <em>Puranas</em>. Those who know even the <em>Vedas</em> and <em>Upanisads</em> are not learned if they do not know the <em>Puranas</em>.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p id="AUanNYs"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="262" height="155" class="size-full wp-image-7206  alignright" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/img_5f23febf07008.png" alt="" /></p>
<p> The reason they are called ‘<em>Puranas</em>’ is because they make the <em>Vedas</em> complete (<em>puranat puranam iti canyatra</em>). This is not to suggest that the <em>Vedas</em> are incomplete. It simply means that the <em>Puranas</em> are explanatory supplements which aid one to understand the concise and ambiguous passages in the <em>Vedas.</em> If the <em>Puranas</em> complete the <em>Vedas</em>, it is only logical that they must be Vedic in nature.<br />
Our Tattvavadi friends have stated that <em>Puranic</em> evidence is secondary to those statements of the <em>sruti</em> because they are composed by mortals. Generally it is correct to state that the <em>sruti</em> is primary and the <em>smrti</em> secondary in that it (<em>sruti</em>) seeks to elaborate on the meaning of the <em>smrti.</em> However, under the circumstances, the <em>puranas</em> and <em>itihasas</em> are now to be considered primary evidence. As regards the mortal composition of the <em>puranas</em> and <em>Itihasas</em>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">2</span> we beg to differ with this view, on the basis of the following references in the <em>sruti-sastras</em></p>
<blockquote class="quote-light">
<p class="verse"><em>rcah samani chandamsi puranam yajusa saha<br />
ucchistaj-jajnire sarve divi deva divi-sritah</em></p>
<p class="translation">&#8220;The <em>Rg, Sama, Yajur</em> and <em>Atharva</em> became manifest from the Lord, along with the <em>Puranas</em> and all the Devas residing in the heavens.&#8221; (<em>Atharva Veda</em> 11.7.24)</p>
<p class="verse"><em>sa brhatim disam anu vyacalat tam itihasas ca puranam ca gathas ca itihasasya ca sa vai puranasya ca gathanam ca narasamsinam ca priyam dhama bhavati ya evam veda</em></p>
<p class="translation">&#8220;He approached the <em>brhati</em> meter, and thus the <em>Itihasas, Puranas, Gathas</em> and <em>Narasamsis</em> became favorable to him. One who knows this verily becomes the beloved abode of the <em>Itihasas, Puranas, Gathas</em> and <em>Narasamsis</em>.&#8221; (<em>Atharva Veda</em> 15.6.10–12)</p>
<p class="verse"><em>evam ime sarva veda nirmitah sa-kalpah sa-rahasyah sa-brahmanah sopanisatkah setihasah sanvakhyatah sa-puranan</em></p>
<p class="translation">&#8220;In this way, all the <em>Vedas</em> were manifested along with <em>the Kalpas, Rahasyas, Brahmanas, Upanisads, Itihasas, Anvakhyatas</em> and the <em>Puranas.&#8221;</em> (<em>Gopatha Brahmana, purva</em> 2.10)</p>
<p class="verse"><em>nama va rg-vedo yajur-vedah sama-veda atharvanas caturtha itihasa-puranah pancamo vedanam vedah</em></p>
<p class="translation">&#8220;Indeed, <em>Rg, Yajur, Sama</em> and <em>Atharva</em> are the names of the four <em>Vedas.</em> The <em>Itihasas</em> and <em>Puranas</em> are the fifth <em>Veda.&#8221; (Kauthumiya Chandogya Upanisad 7.1.4)</em></p>
<p class="verse"><em>asya mahato bhutasya nihsvasitam etad yad rg-vedo yajur-vedah sama<br />
vedo’tharvangirasa itihasah puranam ityadina</em></p>
<p class="translation">&#8220;O Maitreya, the <em>Rg, Yajur, Sama</em> and <em>Atharva Vedas</em> as well as the <em>Itihasas</em> and the <em>Puranas</em> all manifest from the breathing of the Lord.&#8221; <em>(Madhyandina-sruti, Brhad-aranyaka Upanisad</em> 2.4.10)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From these above <em>sruti</em> statements it is clear that the <em>puranas</em> are part of the <em>Vedas</em> and originate from the same source as the <em>Vedas</em>, namely the Supreme Lord Himself. One may argue that since the <em>Puranas</em> have names such as <em>Skanda, Agni, Markandeya</em> etc. they must have been composed by those personalities, therefore they are not eternal and thus cannot be apauruseya. However, if that is the case, then certain sections of the <em>Vedas</em> must also be considered to be <em>pauruseya-vakya</em> since they have names like <em>Katha</em> <em>Upanisad, Aitareya Upanisad</em> (Katha and Aitareya being names of sages). It is understood that certain parts of the <em>Vedas</em> are named after certain <em>rsis,</em> not because they composed them, but because they were the main exponents of those portions. Since persons with the names <em>Katha</em> and <em>Aitareya</em> appear in every millenium, one should not misunderstand that before the appearance of those persons described in the <em>Vedas</em>, these names were simply meaningless words.</p>
<p id="nPGgFwG"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="252" height="171" class="size-full wp-image-7207  alignleft" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/img_5f23fed3311f7.png" alt="" /></p>
<p> Similarly many of the <em>Puranas</em> are named after the first person who expounded them. Many times however, due to the influence of time, a scripture may become forgotten on this planet and thus a deva or sage speaks it again, and it becomes known by that name. Such an example is found in the <em>Bhagavatam</em> wherein the sun-god imparts the <em>Vajasaneyi-samhita</em> of the <em>Yajur Veda</em> to Yajnavalkya Muni –</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light">
<p class="verse"><em>atha ha bhagavams tava carana-nalina-yugalam tri-bhuvana-gurubhir<br />
abhivanditam aham ayata-yama-yajus-kama upasaramiti.</em></p>
<p class="verse"><em>evam stutam sa bhagavan vaji-rupa-dharo ravih<br />
yajumsy ayata-yamani munaye ’dat prasaditah</em></p>
<p class="translation">&#8220;Therefore, O lord, with prayers I approach your two lotus feet, which are adored by the preceptors of the three worlds, because I wish to receive from you <em>mantras</em> of the <em>Yajur Veda</em> that are unknown to anyone else.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Being pleased by such exaltation, the sun-god took the form of a horse and presented to the <em>muni</em> <em>mantras</em> of the <em>Yajur Veda</em> which were previously unknown to any mortal.&#8221; (<em>Bhagavata</em> 12.6.72-73)</p>
<p>In his treatise Visnu Tattva Vinirnaya, Sri Madhva, quoting Brahmanda Purana explains thus:</p>
<p class="verse"><em>puranani tadarthani sarge sarge’nythaiva tu<br />
kriyante’tastvanityani tadarthah purva-sargavat<br />
vedanam srsthivakyani bhaveyurvyaktyapeksaya<br />
avantarabhimananam devanam va vyapeksaya<br />
nanityatvat kutastesamanityatvam sthiratmanam</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, the <em>Puranas</em> are supposed to explain the meaning of the <em>Vedas</em> and are only different by the changes in words, chanda (metre), rsi, sequence etc. at the beginning of each creation. In this way they are considered to be non-eternal, but their meaning will be the same as in the previous creation.<br />
Therefore Madhva categorizes the <em>Puranas</em> as <em>‘nitya-anitya’</em> because they originally emanate from the Supreme Lord, but they are sometimes unmanifest.<br />
As a side note, it may be asked that if the <em>Puranas</em> are indeed subsidiary to the <em>sruti-sastras,</em> why does Sri Madhvacarya himself quote them so often in his works? Not only that, he even uses <em>puranic</em> evidence in order to establish the <em>nityatva</em> of the <em>Vedas!</em> If the <em>Puranas</em> are not eternal and <em>apauruseya,</em> why would he use their ‘secondary statements’ as a <em>pramana</em> to validify something which is superior?<br />
Another point is that in the chanting of the <em>Brahma-yajna</em> (formal study of the <em>Vedas</em>), the <em>Puranas</em> are included. If they were not <em>Vedic</em> in nature they would not be included. Therefore the <em>Taittiriya Aranyaka</em> (2.9) states <em>yad brahmananitihasa-puranani</em>: &#8220;The <em>Itihasas</em> and <em>Puranas</em> are <em>Vedas.&#8221;</em><br />
It has already been stated above in the quote from <em>Chandogya Upanisad</em> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">3</span> that the <em>Puranas</em> are known as the fifth Veda. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">4</span> The reason behind this is because the <em>Puranas</em> and <em>Itihasas</em> are derived originally from the <em>Yajur Veda.</em> This is explained by <em>Sri Suta</em> in the <em>Vayu Purana-</em></p>
<blockquote class="quote-light">

In the beginning there was only one <em>Veda</em> – the <em>Yajur Veda</em>. This was divided into four portions. From these stemmed the four performances known as the <em>catur-homa</em> by which he (Vyasa) arranged for the performance of sacrifice. The <em>Adhvaryu</em> priest uses the <em>Yajur mantras,</em> the <em>Hotra</em> priest uses the <em>Rg mantras,</em> the <em>Udgata</em> priest uses the <em>Sama mantras,</em> and the <em>Brahma</em> priest uses the <em>Atharva mantras.</em></p>

</blockquote>
<p>The statement of Sri Suta Gosvami in the above verse from <em>Vayu Purana</em> in which he says that ‘Whatever remained after Vyasa had divided the <em>Vedas</em> into four divisions was considered to also be the <em>Yajur Veda</em>’ indicates that the essence of the original <em>Purana</em> (which was the remaining part of the <em>Yajur Veda</em>) became the condensed version of the <em>Purana</em> consisting of four-hundred-thousand <em>slokas</em>, available on the earth-planet.<br />
Further evidence for this is found in the <em>Matsya Purana</em> (53.8-9)wherein the Lord says –</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light">
<p class="verse"><em>kalenagrahanam matva puranasya dvijottamah<br />
vyasa-rupam aham krtva samharami yuge yuge</em></p>
<p class="translation">&#8220;O best of the <em>brahmanas</em>, understanding that the <em>Purana</em> would gradually become forgotten, in every <em>yuga</em> I appear in the form of Vyasa and condense it.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the next <em>sloka</em> of that <em>Purana</em>, the Lord continues –</p>
<p class="verse"><em> catur-laksa-pramanena dvapare dvapare sada<br />
tad astadasadha krtva</em> <em>bhur-loke’smin prabhasyate<br />
adyapyamartya-loke tu sata-koti-pravistaram<br />
tad artho’tra catur-laksah sanksepena nivesitah</em></p>
<p class="translation">&#8220;The <em>Purana</em> contains four-hundred-thousand verses which is divided into eighteen parts. These are passed on via oral tradition every Dvapara-yuga on the earth-planet. Even today the original <em>Purana</em> which consists of one-billion verses exists in the heavenly planets. The essential meaning of that <em>Purana</em> is contained in the smaller version of four-hundred-thousand verses.&#8221;</p>
<p>The same point is raised in the <em>Vayaviya Samhita</em> (7.1.1. 37-38) –</p>
<p class="verse"><em>sanksipya caturo vedams caturdha vyabhajat prabhuh<br />
vyasta-vedataya khyato veda-vyasa iti smrtah<br />

<p class="verse"><em>sanksiptam ityatra teneti sesah</em></p>
<p class="translation">&#8220;That Lord who is most intelligent then divided the <em>Vedas</em> into four. He therefore became known as Veda Vyasa. He also summarized the <em>Puranas</em> into four-hundred-thousand verses which are still available in the heavenly domain in the form if one billion verses.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, it should be explained that although the <em>Puranas</em> and <em>Itihasas</em> are known as the fifth <em>Veda —</em> that does not mean that they are literally identical in all ways with the <em>Vedas</em>. If that were so, <em>Purana</em> and <em>Itihasa</em> would just be names of certain sections of the <em>Vedas</em>. The difference between them is in annotation and the order of words. The <em>Vedas</em> are chanted in a particular style involving three tone accents (<em>svaras</em>) called <em>udatta</em>, <em>anudatta</em> and <em>svarita</em>. If a word is chanted in the wrong accent, the whole meaning of the sentence can change.<br />
As regards the order of words, the <em>Vedas</em> maintain a particular sequence which has not changed since the dawn of creation. There is no scope for even the slightest change in the Vedic texts, whereas the texts of the <em>Puranas</em> change according to <em>kalpa-bheda</em>. It is for this reason that we find occasional differencies in certain editions of the <em>Puranas.</em><br />
Another distinction between the <em>Vedas</em> and the <em>Puranas</em> is that although the <em>Puranas</em> are considered part of the <em>Brahma-yajna</em>, they are not used in the performance of Vedic sacrifices.<br />
Unfortunately, major problems also arise when trying to studsy the <em>Puranas.</em> Firstly, although the <em>Puranas</em> are much more accessible than the <em>Vedas</em> and more readily available, they too are not available in their entirety. The eighteen <em>Puranas</em> and eighteen <em>Upa-Puranas</em> are a vast body of literature and there are so many different versions that it is difficult to know which editions are complete and which texts have been interpolated. This is due to the fact that there are no current disciplic schools nor bona-fide commentaries for most of these works.<br />
Secondly, we can understand that independent study of the <em>Puranas</em> yields no fruit since each seems to establish a different deity as Supreme. By studying the <em>Puranas</em> without proper guidance, the result is only confusion. <em>Matsya Purana</em> (53.65, 68-69) states –</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light">
<p class="verse"><em>pancangam ca puranam syad akhyanam itarat smrtam<br />
sattvikesu ca kalpesu mahatmyam adhikam hareh<br />
rajasesu ca mahatmyam adhikam brahmano viduh<br />

<p class="translation">&#8221; A <em>Purana</em> consists of five elements, as opposed to an <em>Akhyana</em>. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">6</span> The <em>sattvika</em> <em>Puranas</em> glorify Hari; the <em>rajasika Puranas</em> glorify Brahma, and the <em>tamasika</em> <em>Puranas</em> glorify Siva and Agni. <em>Puranas</em> dealing with mixed modes of nature glorify Sarasvati and the fore-fathers.&#8221; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">7</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The divisions of the eighteen <em>Puranas</em> is defined by Lord Siva to Uma in the <em>Padma Purana</em> (<em>Uttara Khanda</em> 236.18-21):</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light">
<p class="verse"><em>vaisnavanam naradiyam ca tatha bhagavatam subham<br />
garudam ca tatha padmam varaham subha-darsane</em></p>
<p class="verse"><em>sattvikani puranani vijneyani subhani vai<br />
brahmandam brahma-vaivarta markandeyam tathaiva ca<br />
bhavisyam vamanam brahmam rajasani nibodha me<br />
matsyam kaurmam tatha laingam saivam skandam tathaiva ca<br />
agneyam ca sad etani tamasani nibodha me</em></p>
<p class="translation">&#8221; O beautiful lady, one should know that the <em>Visnu, Naradiya, Bhagavata, Garuda, Padma</em> and <em>Varaha</em> are all in the mode of goodness. The <em>Brahmanda, Brahma-vaivarta, Markandeya, Bhavisya, Vamana</em> and <em>Brahma</em> are in the mode of passion. The <em>Matsya, Kurma, Linga, Siva, Skanda</em> and <em>Agni</em> are in the mode of ignorance.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sri Krsna has clearly expressed in <em>Bhagavad-gita</em> that goodness is superior to passion and ignorance. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">8</span> Similarly, Sri Suta Gosvami explains in the <em>Bhagavata</em>(1.2.24) that &#8220;Passion is better than ignorance because it can lead to realization of the Absolute Truth.&#8221;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">9</span> In this verse Suta speaks about which type of worship produces the ultimate benefit, and his conclusion is that one can only achieve the best result by worshipping Lord Visnu. The <em>sattvika Puranas</em> recommend the worship of Visnu / Krsna, whereas the <em>rajasika</em> and <em>tamasika Puranas</em> advocate the worship of minor deities and therefore do not lead the aspirant towards the Absolute Truth.<br />
It is noteworthy that the <em>sattvika Puranas</em> commence with a questioner inquiring from a learned speaker about the nature of the Absolute. The speaker’s answers are clear, direct and unambiguous, leaving no room for misinterpretation. However, in the <em>tamasika</em> and <em>rajasika Puranas</em> questions are put to the speaker which do not pertain to the Absolute Truth. For example, in the <em>Linga Purana</em> the sages request Suta to speak about the glories of the Lingam form of Lord Siva. We may conclude from this that although Sri Suta Gosvami is learned in transcendental subject matters and expert in explaining them, the questions by the sages here restrict him from speaking on it. All <em>rajasika</em> and <em>tamasika</em> <em>Puranas</em> contain this characteristic defect and therefore are not reliable sources of transcendental knowledge.<br />
One may ask at this point why Srila Vyasadeva wrote these <em>Puranas.</em> According to the various desires of the materially conditioned <em>jivas</em>, he arranged the <em>Puranas</em>. Nevertheless, all <em>Puranas</em> contain glorification of Lord Visnu. This was included by Vyasa in order that those in the lower modes of passion and ignorance will slowly develop interest in the Supreme Lord Hari while studying the <em>rajasika</em> and <em>tamasika Puranas.</em> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">10</span>Therefore in the <em>Hari Vamsa</em> (3.323.34)it is said –</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light">
<p class="verse"><em>vede ramayane caiva purane bharate tatha<br />
adav-ante ca madhye ca harih sarvatra giyate</em></p>
<p class="translation">&#8220;In the <em>Vedas</em>, the <em>Ramayana, Puranas</em> and <em>Mahabharata</em>, from the very beginning to the end, as well as within the middle, only Hari, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is explained.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yet it must be understood that although <em>rajasika</em> and <em>tamasika Puranas</em> do not speak extensively on the Absolute Truth, this does not mean that they give no valid knowledge at all. If this was the case why would <em>acaryas</em> such as Madhva cite from <em>Puranas</em> such as <em>Skanda, Brahma, Brahmanda, Brahma-vaivarta</em> etc which are not <em>sattvika</em> by nature? The <em>Puranas</em> in the lower modes may also give some insight into the Absolute Truth, although not to the same extent as the <em>sattvika Puranas.</em><br />
By this we may conclude that the <em>sattvika Puranas</em> are the ultimate <em>pramana</em>. This is also declared by the <em>Padma Purana &#8211; sattvika moksa-dah proktah: </em>&#8220;The <em>sattvika Puranas</em> give salvation.&#8221; Unfortunatly, as stated before, there are no current disciplic schools nor bona-fide commentaries for most of these works. Some of the <em>sattvika Puranas</em> recommend the path of <em>bhakti,</em> while others glorify the path of <em>jnana</em> or <em>yoga.</em><br />
One possibility to resolve this dilemma is to study the <em>Vedanta-sutra</em>. This work of Vyasadeva contains the essence of the <em>Vedas</em> and the <em>Puranas.</em> Still, the language of the <em>Vedanta-sutras</em> is ambiguous to say the least, and has therefore been interpreted in a number of ways by numerous scholars ( Madhva, Sankara, Ramanuja, Bhaskara, Bodhayana, Dramida, Guhadeva to name but a few). The foundations of many of the <em>sutras</em> lie in Upanisadic passages, yet Vyasa does not mention in his work as to which passages the particular <em>sutra</em> is commenting on. Thus both the student and the commentator must determine this for themselves. It is no wonder then that Vedavyasa felt discontent even after compiling the <em>Vedas</em>, <em>Puranas</em>, <em>Mahabharata</em> and <em>Vedanta-sutra &#8211;</em></p>
<blockquote class="quote-light">
<p class="verse"><em>tathapi bata me daihyo hy atma caivatmana vibhuh<br />
asampanna ivabhati brahma-varcasya sattamah</em></p>
<p class="translation">&#8220;I am feeling incomplete, although I am fully equipped with everything required by the <em>Vedas</em>.&#8221; (<em>Bhagavata</em> 1.4.30)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reason for his discontentment was then explained by Narada Muni –</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light">
<p class="verse"><em>jijnasitam susampannam api te mahad-adbhutam<br />
krtavan bharatam yas tvam sarvartha-paribrmhitam</em></p>

</em><em>na tatha vasudevasya mahima hy anuvarnitah</em></p>
<p class="translation">&#8220;O best of sages, since you have broadly described the four goals of human life beginning with religious performances, you have not described the glories of the Supreme Personality, Vasudeva.&#8221; (<em>Bhagavata</em>1.5.8-9)</p>

<p> On the advice of Narada, Vyasa meditated and the <em>Bhagavata</em> was manifest to him. This is the natural commentary of Vyasa’s own <em>sutras</em> (<em>artho’yam brahma-sutranam</em>) and thus includes the purport of the entire <em>Vedic</em> literature (<em>vedartha-paribrmhitah</em>) It is free from the problems that we find with the <em>Vedas</em> and the other <em>Puranas</em> – it is available in it’s entirety, it has commentated upon by various Vaisnava <em>acaryas</em>, it is divinely composed and <em>Puranic</em> in nature. In it’s opening <em>sloka</em> it gives the essence of the <em>Vedas</em> since it begins with the holy <em>gayatri mantra·</em> (<em>gayatri-bhasya-rupo ’sah</em>) which is itself the essence of the <em>vedas.</em> This is also confirmed in the <em>Matsya Purana</em> (53.20-22) and <em>Agni Purana</em> (272.6.7) &#8211;</p>

<p>Most importantly, the <em>Bhagavata</em> is the crowning glory of the divine author’s literary efforts, soothing his heart when he felt that his work remained incomplete.<br />
There are many verses that praise the <em>Bhagavata</em> above all the other <em>Puranas.</em> In the <em>Skanda Purana</em> (<em>Visnu-khanda</em> 6.4.3) it says –</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light">

</blockquote>
<p><strong> CONCLUSION:</strong> In this way we have shown through the <em>pramana</em> of the <em>srutis, smrtis, Itihasas</em> and <em>Puranas</em> that the <em>Mahabharata</em> and the <em>Puranas</em> are indeed considered to be the fifth <em>Veda</em>, and that they are of higher importance and significance in the age of Kali than the four <em>Vedas</em>. Of them, the highest is the the <em>Bhagavata</em>, the crest-jewel of all the Vedic literatures. For this reason the <em>Bhagavata</em>(1.3.43) says:</p>
<p class="verse"><em>krsne sva-dhamopagate dharma-jnanadibhih saha<br />
kalau nasta-drsam esa puranarko’dhunditah</em></p>
<p class="translation">&#8220;The <em>Bhagavata</em> is as brilliant as the sun. After Sri Krsna has left for His abode, accompanied by <em>dharma</em> and knowledge, it has arisen to save us from the darkness of the age of Kali.&#8221;</p>
<p>____________________________</p>
<p class="note"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">1</span>&#8211; This is affirmed by Lord Krsna in the <em>Bhagavata</em> (11.3.44) – &#8220;<em>paroksa-vada vedo’yam&#8221;</em> (The <em>Vedas</em> speak indirectly).</p>
<p class="note"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2</span>&#8211; In the case of the <em>Bhagavata,</em> this itself is a contradiction from the point of view of the Madhva <em>sampradaya.</em> If the <em>Vedas</em> are considered a primary authority merely because they issued from the mouth of God Himself, the <em>Bhagavata</em> and <em>Mahabharata</em> should also fall into such a category since the author of these works was Veda Vyasa, whom the Tattvavadis consider to be a direct <em>avatara</em> of Narayana.</p>
<p class="note"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">3</span>&#8211; This verse from <em>Chandogya Upanisad</em> is also quoted by Madhvacarya in <em>Visnu Tattva Vinirnaya</em> (5). It is also worth noting that in Prof. K.T. Pandurangi’s work The <em>Principal Upanisads</em> (Dvaita Vedanta Studies and Research Foundation, Bangalore 1999) wherein he explains Madhvacarya’s <em>Upanisad</em> commentaries, the author gives the same meaning of this verse.</p>
<p class="note"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">4</span>&#8211; This is also confirmed in the <em>Bhagavata</em> (1.4.20):</p>
<p class="verse note"><em>rg-yajuh-samatharvakhya<br />
vedas catvara uddhrtah<br />
itihasa-puranas ca<br />

<p class="translation note">&#8220;The <em>Vedas</em> were divided into four, namely <em>Rg, Yajur, Sama</em> and <em>Atharva</em>. The <em>Itihasas</em> and the <em>Puranas</em> are said to be the fifth <em>Veda</em>.&#8221;</p>
<p class="note"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">5</span>&#8211; In his <em>tika</em> on the <em>Visnu Purana</em> 3.6.16, Srila Sridhara Svami explains these terms thus:</p>
<p class="verse note"><em>svayam-drstartha</em>&#8211;<em>kathanam prahur akhyanakam budhah srutasyarthasya<br />
kathanam upakhyanam pracaksate gathas tu pitr-prthivyadi gitayah</em></p>
<p class="translation note">&#8220;An <em>Akhyana</em> is a description of that which is witnessed by the speaker. An <em>Upakhyana</em> is a description of something the speaker has not seen, but merely heard about. A <em>Gatha</em> is a song dedicated to the forefathers and beings present upon the earth.&#8221;</p>
<p class="note"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">6</span>&#8211; The word <em>sankspitam</em> in this verse is important. This means ‘condensed’ and not ‘composed’. In other words Sri Vyasa condensed the already existing <em>Vedas</em>, then taking unused verses from that condensed portion, he compiled the <em>Puranas</em>. Thus, the <em>Puranas</em> must be understood to be equal to the <em>Vedas</em>.</p>
<p class="note"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">7</span>&#8211; The five elements of a <em>Purana</em> are described in <em>Matsya Purana</em> (53.65) &#8211;</p>
<p class="verse note"><em>sargas ca pratisargas ca<br />

<p class="translation note">&#8220;The five subjects which make up a <em>Purana</em> are creation (<em>sarga</em>), secondary creation (<em>pratisarga</em>), geneology of kings (<em>vamsa</em>), the description of the Manus (<em>manvantara</em>) and the activities of those kings (<em>vamsanucarita</em>). &#8220;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">Written by Kancha Ilaiah<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">Rape has, of late, become an acute disease in the Indian society. Prima facie, this is a problem arising out of a mental disorder, but there is also a larger cultural context that, to an extent, explains how the Indian male became so brutal.<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">Our cultural upbringing conditions male minds to behave in a cruel fashion with women. Family upbringing, societal conditioning, religious sagas and political animus, all construct our men and women into being what they are — men as aggressive and women as submissive. Which is why men here, in India, are different from men in other countries.<br />
</span><br />
<span id="more-961"></span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">Their cultural milieu is different. Their spiritual systems train them differently. It&#8217;s not that only Indian men rape and kill children aged three or five. This happens in other countries too, but they are the rarest of rare cases. Daily reports of infants being raped across the length and breadth of a country is a phenomenon unique to India, a society that&#8217;s otherwise highly conservative. Clearly, the institutional upbringing, including that in family, needs to undergo change.<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">Every time a gruesome rape gets reported, we all are ashamed and angry. That&#8217;s one thing; but working out ways and means to eradicate such evil is another thing. We cannot leave it entirely to the police or the judiciary to tackle such heinous acts. For, rape is also a cultural problem; and it is a more serious problem because of the extermination of the victim. We need to treat the malaise from its very roots.<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">We are a society that derives its sense of good and bad from our mythologies and spiritual ethics. Our gods and goddesses are not only worshipped but also adored. And it is our lifelong endeavour to emulate them. This is the cultural environment that shapes the lives of most people in India. So it&#8217;s natural that what gods do influences us much more than the moral lesson at the end. Now consider this: we have gods who, for instance, have cut the nose and ear lobes of a woman who approached them professing her love (Lakshman is depicted as having done this to Shurpanakha), and yet we adore him and see him as a symbol of loyalty, sacrifice and righteous indignation.<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">Lord Krishna stole the clothes of women while they were bathing in the Yamuna river. He did so to tease them and for the pleasure of watching the beauty of their naked bodies. We hang miniature paintings of the same act in our homes proudly. The young men who grow up seeing this, or listening to the story told in an amused tone are bound to not find such an act abhorrent.<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">We also have a god, Shiva, who insisted on entering the bathing arena of Goddess Parvati and did so by eliminating a child who was keeping guard at the open door. Lord Ganesha is said to have emerged out of such a union. Is this right or wrong? Our mythology tells us that what a husband does is right, that his will is greater than the woman&#8217;s. If a mythological hero is praised for his acts of killing, drinking and fornicating with multiple women (like Indra did with Rambha, Urvashi, Menaka, Tilottama and so on), it is glorification of such behaviour.<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">When such stories are a part of the mythological texts, they should, at least, be critically evaluated and given a more contemporary, political reading which is rooted in the concept of equality. Instead, the tendency is to not question what our gods did, but simply admire such acts.<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">Barring a few exceptions, there is no appreciation, per se, of a healthy man-woman relationship which is rooted in the concept of equality. Indian women are shown as lathangi (a person of delicate body), never strong enough to resist her dehumanisation. Though Durga and Kali are shown as strong, in real life such militancy is not seen as feminine.<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">Now let us turn to the political spectrum. We have had many great men — Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan etc — who got married at a young age with girls of much younger age, went abroad for higher studies, leaving their wives at home totally illiterate or semi-literate. We do not know how these men, or Gokhale and Tilak, treated their wives.<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">But we know that they were all devotees of the deities mentioned above. The only man who treated his wife as a friend and educated her right from the first day of his marriage, Mahatma Jyotirao Phule, is not taught as an example to be emulated in our texts.  Somehow, in our patriarchal cultural milieu, unkind and inhuman treatment of women has never been a matter of concern. It&#8217;s considered sacrilegious, for example, to question Lord Ram for leaving his dutiful wife on the random outburst of a dhobi.<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">And Sita&#8217;s action, in turn, to not question, but to commit suicide, is considered the epitome of all that is pious. Even Gautam Buddha left his young wife, with an infant child. Questioning such acts has never been part of our public discourse.<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">Or, look at our cinemas. Ever since the industry came into being, silent or talkie, it has used woman&#8217;s body as a money-making object. The song and dance sequence that it has adopted as an art form falls into a common pattern — every hero is licensed to misuse the body of the heroine. The romance in our film industry is not romance; it is vulgarity bordering on the criminal.<br />
So is it a surprise that men of this country see it as their right to violate women in all spheres of life?<br />

<p>The cow is, at the least, an animal domesticated by man for help in agricultural activities.[1]  Although the mighty machines now used in farming have made these animals irrelevant in agriculture, valiant attempts are being made, at least in India, to preserve the exalted position of the so called ‘second mother’ [2] or even ‘mother of the world’ [3,4].<br />
<span id="more-1761"></span><br />
<span id="more-568"></span> The stringent agitations to protect the ‘cow-mother’ [4,5] and even riots and murders of dalits for the sake of the cow,[6,7] suggest that the human life is far less important than a dead cow in this part of the world.[7] This extraordinary reverence for the cow has led to the development and marketing of many ‘products’ made from the secretions and excretions of the cow, with claims that these products may be more ‘lucrative’ than even the dairy.[8]
<strong>‘Cow Products’</strong></p>
<p id="ufgaZfF"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class=" wp-image-7216  alignleft" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/img_5f2412643d604.png" alt="" width="295" height="195" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/img_5f2412643d604.png 417w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/07/img_5f2412643d604-300x199.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 295px) 100vw, 295px" /></p>
<p>The list of ‘products’ developed from the milk and excreta of the cow is quite long. <em><a href="http://www.thereligiousproducts.com/panchagavya.html" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Panchagavya<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></em>and cow urine distillate (<em><a href="http://www.yogashram.in/June%202006.htm" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">gau arka<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></em>) are the most quoted of these preparations.<br />
<em>Panchagavy</em> is a blend of five (<em>pancha</em>) products obtained from the cow (<em>gavya</em> = from <em>gau</em>) – the dung, urine, milk, ghee and curd.[9,10] Three preparations of cow’s urine, namely <em>gau-mutra asav</em> (fermented preparation), <em>gau-arka</em> (or distillate) and <em>Ganavati </em>(or tablet) are also used as medicines.[8,11] Two US patents have also been obtained for the <em>gau -arka</em> [11] and this fact has been highlighted over and over again.<br />
Various products from the cow have been suggested as a successful remedy against more than hundred diseases, from fever to cancer.<strong>[8,11,12] </strong><em>Panchagavya</em> is most reverentially used as a ‘body and soul cleanser’, following the birth or death of a family member. It has also been suggested as a medicine and more profusely as a pesticidal spray for plants and as a soil enriching manure.[10]
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p>Very recently, panchagavya has been suggested as a remedy for chikungunya as well.[13] Cow’s urine has been used in the preparations of hair oil, shampoo, skin cream etc.[8] Preparations like soap, nasal powder, body powder, body cream, incense sticks, tooth powder etc. have been prepared from the cow dung and recommended for medical use[8]. Probably to add sanctity to the entire gamut of these ‘medications’, it has been claimed that Indian pure breed cows have <a href="http://www.yogashram.in/June%202006.htm" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">‘immunology power’<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> from 90% to 98% while the cows of mixed breed have less than 40%.[11]</blockquote>
<p><strong>The ‘evidence&#8217;:</strong><br />
Curious to know about <em>Panchagavya</em>, I asked an Ayurveda physician about its utility. She briefed me about all the virtues of the <em>gau mutra</em> (cow’s urine), <em>gau maya</em> (cow dung) and <em>Panchagavya</em>, quoting the Charaka Samhita. But how can we, living in the 21st century,  rely on an ancient text to justify the use of these excreta, I wondered. All these have been well studied by Charaka, she told me. May be, but the concept of biochemical molecules (and the modern biochemical analysers) and of microbes (and the means of isolating them) were non-existent during Charaka’s time, I countered. But the cow’s urine hasn’t changed since Charaka’s time, she averred. I was dumbstruck!<br />
Most articles on the virtues of cow’s excreta extensively quote from scriptures and the Charaka Samhita. Here are some of these arguments:</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light">
<ul>
<li>The cow is our mother and we are her children. Therefore cow urine is beneficial.[8,11]</li>
<li>Diseases are caused by imbalance of elements bile, mucous and air and cow urine balances elements.[8]</li>
<li>Amongst urines, cow urine is best.[8]</li>
<li>Ganga resides in the cow urine and it contains copper and gold salts, which are elixirs. It does not decay, older the cow urine, the more useful it is.[8]</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Recently a lot has been written about the patents for cow urine; one obtained on the basis of laboratory studies (on culture plates and cell lines) on the usefulness of cow urine distillate in enhancing the efficacy of antibiotics and anti cancer drugs, [14,15] and the other patent obtained for cow urine therapy.[16] There are reports of the use of cow’s urine therapy from Myanmar [17] and of a cow’s urine concoction used as a traditional remedy for convulsive seizures in Nigeria.[18] There have also been reports of studies on the cow’s urine distillate in gouty arthritis, lymphocyte and polymorphonuclear cells and carbon tetrachloride poisoning, all done on experimental animals in small numbers.[19-22] These results have been extrapolated freely and wild conclusions have been drawn about the ‘magical powers’ of the cow’s urine in treating almost all the diseases afflicting mankind today.[14,17] Even the Department of Animal Husbandry of the Ministry of Agriculture, Government of India, has published reports that seek to promote the marketing of cow’s urine as a therapeutic agent.[23]
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The facts:</strong></p>
<p>Faced with this blitzkrieg of marketing of cow’s urine and the real danger that cow’s urine and other products of cow’s excreta may be pushed into the throats of hapless patients, with active support from the govt., agencies., it is time we look into the facts.<br />
One need not go far to see the hypocrisy of the ‘cow urine promoters’ than have a look at the ayurveda texts themselves, extensively quoted as the primary source of support for the utility of cow’s urine as a therapeutic agent. All three major ancient texts of ayurveda, by Charaka (1<sup>st</sup>-2<sup>nd</sup> century), Susruta (3<sup>rd</sup> –4<sup>th</sup> century) and Vagbhata (7<sup>th</sup> century) mention of the therapeutic uses of beef[24,25] as well, but this fact is no where mentioned by the proponents of cow’s urine. Eating beef is a sin and drinking cow’s urine or eating its dung brings health, if these self-styled guardians of ancient Indian tradition are to be believed.</p>
<p>What about the much touted patents for cow’s urine? A patent is a set of exclusive rights granted by a state to an inventor to prevent or exclude others from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing the invention.[26] Nothing more, nothing less. A patent in itself cannot be the proof for the utility of any product. It is hardly surprising that while International patents have been registered for cow’s urine and its products, no such patent has been obtained from the Govt. of India. An Indian patent may not make enough and weighty news, but an international patent, on the other, helps to claim that even ‘foreigners’ have accepted the virtues of cow’s urine!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p id="xfXbjMs"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="300" height="215" class="size-full wp-image-7218  alignright" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/img_5f2412d2c9613.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>All the studies available in the literature about the therapeutic efficacy of cow’s excreta are small studies conducted in the labs and on animals or tissues. There are no reports of any controlled, double blind clinical studies in humans, other than some anecdotal reports and claims by the practitioners of ‘cow therapy’ and all these so called claims of research appear dubious by any scientific standards.[27] Most of these papers contradict their own claims: the claims made about the gold and copper salts in urine, for example, are not supported by the data provided by the protagonists themselves.[8,28]
<p>Urine is urine, the liquid waste that is filtered by the kidneys and excreted through the urinary system. It contains many solutes and biological products that are unnecessary for the living body and hence excreted and also some substances secreted by the urinary tract to facilitate this excretion. Chemical constituents of human and animal urine are almost alike.[28,29] For example, Urokinase is an enzyme secreted into the urine to prevent its clogging; today, it is extracted from human urine and used to dissolve clots in the coronary arteries in patients who suffer a heart attack.[30] Does this justify drinking one’s own urine in case of a heart attack? Far from it. Is cow’s urine safe for mankind? There are reports of severe adverse effects, even fatal, of drinking cow urine concoctions, further supported by experimental evidence.[31] Cow’s urine can also be a source of infectious diseases, especially leptospirosis, [32] that can spread through oral mucosa. The claim that cow’s urine and cow dung have antiseptic properties is not only baseless, but also dangerously misleading. While cow dung (and all fecal matter) is teeming with bacteria excreted from the intestines, several bacteria have been isolated from <em>Panchagavya </em>too.[33,34] Application of these bacteria-rich excreta onto wounds may lead to life threatening sepsis. Only those who are absolutely ignorant about such facts can daringly market cow’s excreta as antiseptics, but the tragedy is that some practitioners of modern medicine, blinded by their faiths in their ‘spiritual heads’ or <em>‘Mathadhipathis’</em> also appear to support such nonsense.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Conclusions:<br />
</strong><br />
It is clear that cow’s urine and other excreta are only the waste products rejected by the animal’s body and are similar to the excreta of other animals and therefore, there is absolutely no reason why the cow’s urine or other excreta should be venerable over those of humans beings or other animals.</p>
<p>The claims of the efficacy of cow’s excreta (and their products) in the treatment of almost every disease are not supported by any evidence and there are no clinical trials reported on the use of these products in human beings. With reports available about the possible adverse effects of the use of cow’s excreta, it is shocking that such products are being allowed to be not only marketed but also trumpeted, even supported by the agencies of the govt. of India, as the ‘cure-for-all’ wonder drugs.</p>
<p>Propaganda regarding the utility of cow’s excreta largely emanates from the obscurantist and Hindu fundamentalist forces and appears to be designed to condemn the ordinary human beings into ingesting cow’s excreta under the alibi of ‘treatment’ and ‘long life’. This is not surprising at all, given the several instances of the down trodden dalits forced into eating even human excreta by the same fundamentalists.[35]
<p>Eulogising the cow (and not buffalo and other cattle that are equally ‘useful’) as ‘second mother’, ‘God mother’, ‘mother of the world’ etc., largely because it provides milk,[11] (and hopefully not because of its excreta) raises a fundamental question about the concept of motherhood itself: Do we love and respect our own mothers solely because we have been breastfed and is motherhood only about milk?</p>
<p>This entire exercise of marketing the cow’s products and promising huge economic benefits (a claim not supported by any data) of keeping the cows even after they have passed the age of secreting milk  is part of the grand design to prevent the slaughtering of the cows so as to deprive the poor sections of the society from quality meat as well as some economic benefits of marketing the beef. But sustaining the livestock is proving to be very costly for the environment, with a large share of global warming attributed to the livestock.[36,37] It is time we take a rational view of all the issues involved.<br />
