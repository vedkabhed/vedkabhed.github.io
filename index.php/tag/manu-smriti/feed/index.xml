										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="color:#333333;">Written by Abd al-Muhsin Al Hindy</p>
<p style="color:#333333;">In this part we will see some more heinous acts legislated by the barbaric Vedas. We’ve seen how Hindūs are ever zealous in maligning Islām, alleging it to be ‘violent’ , intolerant but have the people seen the true ‘teachings’ of this self-claimed ‘ahinsac’(non-violent) religion? Let’s read the ‘unholy’ verses of their so-called Holy book ‘vedas’.</p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span id="more-852"></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:#000080;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><strong style="font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">Intolerance and killing in vedas</span></span></strong><strong style="font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"> &#8211;</span></strong></span></span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:red;">“<strong style="font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">Food to him</span></strong> </span>who knows the science of air, and to him <strong style="font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:red;">who is the chief killer</span></span></strong><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:red;">. </span>Homage to the expert in the construction of houses, and to their protector. Food to the wealthy, and to him who makes the wicked weep. Homage to him who abhors sin and to him who practices Virtue”</span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">&#8211; [Yajurveda Ch 16, verse 39, pg.173, Tr. Devi Chand]</span></span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">“We learned persons accept as our ruler, thee, the introducer of new plans for our advancement, the master of loyal subjects, the embodiment of virtue, the most advanced in noble qualities and acts,<span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:red;"> <strong style="font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">the queller of the irreligious</span></strong>, </span>the pure, the specimen of endurance, the master of prowess, and the helper and educator of all.”</span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">– [Yajurveda Ch 7, verse 36, pg.77, Tr. Devi Chand]</span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">The verse quoted above speak for themselves, the second verse commands killing of irreligious and here this is one of the reasons why<strong style="font-style:inherit;"><em style="font-weight:inherit;">‘learned person’</em></strong> are accepting, a ruler, due to his intolerance towards who are irreligious! While the first verse praises ‘Chief-killer’ by stating food to him who’s the chief killer! We need no more statements from the vedas; these amply put our point in place. And these are the verses from the book of a religion which often labels itself as ‘ahimsac’ (non-violent). Such cults and religions often label themselves as non-violent in order to hide the true face of their creed.</span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:#000080;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><strong style="font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">Killing irreligious foes in Vedas-</span></strong></span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:red;">“O king, <strong style="font-style:inherit;">make progress</strong> in <strong style="font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">thy duty of administration</span></strong>, extend happiness to the virtuous. <strong style="font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">O terrible chastiser, burn down the irreligious foes.</span></strong> O splendid person, humiliate and consume utterly like dried up stubble, him, who encourages our foe.”</span></span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">– [Yajurveda, Ch 13, verse 12, pg.138, Tr. Devi Chand]</span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">Above verse <strong style="font-style:inherit;">commands</strong> protestant <strong style="font-style:inherit;">Hindū King</strong> to burn down irreligious foes like stubble, this is what protestant Hindūs call ‘tolerance’. And this is reagarded as progress in the administrative duty of a <strong style="font-style:inherit;">Hindū King! </strong>We’ve always found Hindūs criticizing Muslims and belittling them as barbarians, because few so-called Muslims rulers allegedly have been intolerant and have killed thousands of Hindūs, while conquering India. This is the <strong style="font-style:inherit;"><em style="font-weight:inherit;">‘Classical hypocrisy’</em></strong> of Hindūs; they’ve always criticized people for being barbaric, intolerant and violent against Hindūs, but what about these unholy verses from their so-called holy books? Islām never allowed such barbaric acts , but if some Muslim indulge into such acts then he’s to be blamed not Islām, but Islāmophobes like Agniveer have always blamed Islām – this shows their bias, irrationality and unreasonable state of mind. But now we question, what about Hindūism which quite evidently is commanding Hindūs to kill innocents because they are irreligious?</span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">Burning of irreligious people! , still we find protestant Hindūs adamantly criticizing Islām and other faiths with so-called intolerance, extremism, fundamentalism and violence, when their religion itself is the paragon of such barbaric thing</span></span>s.</span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:#000080;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><strong style="font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">Mass-carnage, killing of innocents – children, females, sick, old, commanded and encouraged in vedas:</span></strong></span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">Now let’s see what the barbaric Vedas have to say about this, we’ll</span></span></span><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"> show our readers what the so-called “Ahinsac” (non-violent) Vedas command.</span></span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:red;">“<strong style="font-style:inherit;">O friendly countrymen, encourage the commander of the army</strong></span>, and begin the battle with him, who with his physical, mental and militarystrength,<span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:red;"> <strong style="font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">cleaves the enemies’ families</span>, <span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">usurps their land</span></strong>, </span>is armed with weapons, <span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:red;">slay’s the foes</span></span>, subdues the enemy in the battle, and conquers him.” – [Yajurveda, Chapter 17, verse 38, pg-182, Tr. Devi Chand]</span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:red;">“<strong style="font-style:inherit;">May the commander of the army</strong></span>, who, with<span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:red;"> <strong style="font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">surpassing vigour pierces in the battles the families of the enemies</span></strong>, <strong style="font-style:inherit;">is pitiless</strong>,<strong style="font-style:inherit;"> wild with anger</strong>, </span>unconquerable by foes, conqueror of the enemy’s forces, unequalled in fight, and victor, protect our armies.”</span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">– [Yajurveda, Chapter 17, verse 39, pg-182, Tr. Devi Chand]</span></span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">Interestingly, Vedas teach protestant Hindūs to usurp the lands of those who’ve been invaded, annihilate, and tear apart the families of the enemy! Another Vedic verse commands the King <em style="font-weight:inherit;">(in Hindi translation and ‘Indra’ in English translation and Original Sanskrit )</em> to expel the enemies out of their homes and kill/demolish those who fight Hindūs</span></span></span></p>

<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><strong style="font-style:inherit;">Translation:</strong></span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">“<strong style="font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:red;">I thrust you man out of home</span></span></strong>, the rival <strong style="font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:red;">who fights</span></span></strong> <strong style="font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">[us</span>]</strong>, with the oblation of ejectment <strong style="font-style:inherit;">; <span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">Indra hath <span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:red;">demolished him</span></span></strong>.”</span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">– [, Atharvaveda, 6.75.1]</span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">Look at these inhuman verses from the vedas! Now what does the hatemongers (agniveer et .el)say? We know they do not have any answers nor will they will dare to answer us. This is what is called ‘hypocrisy’ and Mūlshankar and his blind-followers are full with it. We wonder why these people cry about the alleged killing of innocents by Arab invaders, when their own ‘holy’ book orders to Hindu commander-in-chief to mercilessly kill the whole families including children, old, sick, women …etc Why these islamphobes complaining when their own ‘holy’ book, call for mass carnage of innocents! Why? Because they are Hypocrites, what more proof will an unbiased person need?<br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:#000080;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><strong style="font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">Looting is the way to prosperity according to vedas (‘battle is the source of thy (hindūs) prosperity’):</span></strong></span></span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">Now let’s go to looting, . Let’s see what the Hindū scriptures state about it. Looting is the way to prosperity this is the principle expounded by the Vedas, and other protestant Hindū texts.</span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">“<strong style="font-style:inherit;">Chariots and horses, elephants, parasols, money, grain, cattle, <span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:red;">women</span>, all sorts of (marketable) goods and valueless metals</strong><strong style="font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">belong to him who takes them (singly) conquering (the possessor).</span></strong>”</span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">– [Manu Smriti, Chapter 7, verse 96, pg 231]</span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">Now, when Manu Shāstra itself says that all the marketable goods and other materials belong to the conqueror, then why is it the followers of Manu Shāstra (protestant Hindūs) are found crying when Arab invaders took few things similar to it? Why? Answer is Hypocrisy! It’s not this simple, in fact according to Vedas battles are considered as source of prosperity as battles include looting. Read with your own eyes.</span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><strong style="font-style:inherit;">“<span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:red;">Thou, head of the state, the conqueror of enemies</span></strong>, the lord of five classes of subjects under thy sway, and armies, strong in body and soul, take with thy meals, invigorating herbs, for pleasure and conquest. Fill thy belly with the sweet flow of well-cooked meals. Thou art the sovereign of all great deeds and requiring deep thought. Thou hast been initiated in the rules of administration ; <strong style="font-style:inherit;">we harness thee for battle involving the use of arms and weapons</strong>. <strong style="font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:red;">This battle is the source of thy prosperity</span></span></strong><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">; hence we goad thee to that battle.”</span></span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">– [Yajurveda, Ch 7, verse 38, pg. 78, Tr. Devi Chand]</span></span></p>

<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">– [Yajurveda Ch 9, verse 9, pg. 93 Tr. Devi Chand]</span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">Moreover, Hindūs are commanded to harass these poor people, who are conquered, destroy their means of sustenance, so that those who escaped the barbarism die out of starvation and hunger.</span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">“When he has shut up his foe (in a town), let him sit encamped, <strong style="font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:red;">harass his kingdom, and continually spoil his grass, food, fuel, and water.</span></span></strong>Likewise let him destroy the tanks, ramparts, and ditches, and let him assail the (foe unawares) and alarm him at night.”</span></span></p>

<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">The Vedas also order the Hindū Kings to ruthlessly destroy kitchens of the enemies’ house so that the surviving enemies <em style="font-weight:inherit;">(those who escaped Vedic barbarism)</em> and their families may die out of starvation, hunger and Malnutrition.</span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">“<strong style="font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">O King</span></strong>, rise high, punish the wicked foes righteously, manifest the objects prepared by our steady scholars, enhance pleasures.<strong style="font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:red;">Destroy the kitchens </span>and other places</span></strong> of plundering of the vigorous enemies. <span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:red;">Kill the foes</span>.

<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">Just compare these barbaric teachings of Vedas to the divine merciful teachings of Islām; we’ve stated the Islāmic stance of the issues relayed above. May we question, how can such people claim their religion to be “Ahinsac”?</span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:#000080;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><strong style="font-style:inherit;">Vedas and ‘World domination’:</strong></span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">How many of you have heard the cry of Islāmophobes, <em style="font-weight:inherit;">“Islām will take over!”</em>, <em style="font-weight:inherit;">“Stop Islām, before it dominates the world!”</em>, <em style="font-weight:inherit;">“Help us stop, Islām!”</em>, <em style="font-weight:inherit;">“Islām will not be a threat, if…”</em> Well such sentences are common nowadays, and more common are the claims that Islām will dominate the world with force, power…etc nonetheless, has anyone ever thought about vedas and what they command to the Hindūs about preaching vedic dharma, about the duties of the King? Well, if no then let us explore these things right from the vedas.So does vedas ask Hindūs to dominate the world, by occupying it and conquering it with force? Does vedas ask Hindūs to spread Vedic dharma with sword? Nope we won’t answer! Let the vedas speak for themselves,</span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><strong style="font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:red;">“</span></span></strong><strong style="font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span lang="EN-IN" style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:red;">With military weapons let us win the Earth</span></span></strong>, <strong style="font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:red;">with them the battle</span></strong>, <strong style="font-style:inherit;">with cannon</strong> let us win the ease-loving army of our foes. War-like weapons destroy the ambitions of the foeman. <strong style="font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:red;">Armed with the bow may we subdue all regions.</span></span></strong>”</span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">– </span><span lang="EN-IN" style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">[Yajurveda, Ch. 29, Verse 39, pg. 293, Tr. Devi Chand]</span></span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">The verse, speaks for itself! We need not expound on it in detail, simply put the above verse asks Hindūs to subdue all the regions of the world, and win it with force and destructive military weapons. This verse asks Hindūs to dominate the world, and subdue it, still we find these Hindūs claiming to be Ahinsac?</span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">And, so does another verse in the vedas ask Hindūs to conquer and dominate the world with force,</span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">“May food be before us, in the midst among us. May food eaten enhance our noble qualities. Yea, food hath made me rich in brave sons. <strong style="font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">As lord of food may I <span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:red;">conquer all regions</span>.</span></strong>”</span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">– [Yajurveda, Ch. 18, Verse 34, pg-197, Tr. Devi Chand]</span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">Nope, Vedas have more to say, they ask the Hindū King to take everything under his control right from animals to every human on earth, everything.</span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">“<strong style="font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:red;">O king</span></span></strong>, thou art the repository of knowledge like a sage. The learned subjects obey thee in all directions. <strong style="font-style:inherit;">May riches fit for men be secured by this intelligent devotee</strong>. Thou art lustrous like the beams of the sun. <strong style="font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">May <span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:red;">all people on the earth and all beasts of the forest be under thy control.</span>”</span></strong></span></span></p>

<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">So why do we find, Hindūs criticizing Muslims, for conquering and invade India? When their own vedas asks them to invade every nation, every part on earth, subdue it, conquer it and take everything under control! Coming to the duties of king as legislated by, and what do vedas legislate and sanctify the King for?</span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">“O king, just as the wise and aged persons, in this world, created by the Effulgent God, accept thee, with the force and strength of vital breaths, and attraction and retention of breath, the source of strength; <strong style="font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">so do I. Just as I <span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:red;">cut the throats of the sinners</span>, so shouldst thou</span></strong>. Oking, thou hast the power of imparting virtue and removing vice, <strong style="font-style:inherit;">remove from us our despisers and foes</strong>. <strong style="font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:red;">Just as I sanctify thee</span></span></strong>, the exponent of justice, for the display of knowledge, thee, the embodiment of truth, for spiritual advancement; thee,<strong style="font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:red;">the administrator, for rule over the Earth</span>; so should these justice-loving people do.</span></strong> O king thou art a father unto thine subjects, rear them up. O Queen, thou also shouldst behave similarly.”</span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">&#8211; [Yajurveda, Ch. 6, verse 1, pg.62, Tr. Devi Chand]</span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">What did our readers read? Yes, Vedas santify the Hindū king to ruler over the world, in short asking him to conquer the entire world, cut the throats of sinners, remove the foes of Hindūs! And these people call themselves Ahinsac! Is there any bigger lie than this? And here again we prove how vedas command Hindūs to subdue other civilizations and religions and rule the world with brute-force.And what more duties do the vedas, have legislated for the Hindū kings? Again let the Vedas speak for it,</span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">“<strong style="font-style:inherit;">O king, thou art our leader</strong>; thou putteth upon the path of rectitude, even the leaders of a high order. Know thou this art of government. God the creator will rule over thee. Just as the state officials anoint thee with sweet juices and flower-laden herbs, so should the subjects do.<strong style="font-style:inherit;">Thy first duty is to undertake the spread of knowledge and the administration of justice. Thy <span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:red;">second duty</span></span>is to <span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:red;">propagate religious truths</span></span>. <span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">Thy <span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:red;">foremost duty </span>is to <span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:red;">strengthen thy rule over the Earth</span>.</span></strong>”</span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">– [Yajurveda, Ch. 6, verse 2, pg.62, Tr. Devi Chand]</span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">So we learn, that the <strong style="font-style:inherit;">foremost </strong>duty of a Hindū king is to maintain and strengthen Hindū <em style="font-weight:inherit;">(Vedic)</em> supremacy and rule over the earth, another very important duty is to propogate so-called religious truths <em style="font-weight:inherit;">(i.e. Vedic Dharma)</em> And still we find Hindūs <em style="font-weight:inherit;">(protestant and Orthodox)</em> criticizing Islām, for proselytisation and conquering the world with force <em style="font-weight:inherit;">(an allegation!)</em>, whereas the same things are taught, legalised and prescribed by vedas, so why criticize Islām?Let’s move further and see some how do the vedas ask its followers to preach the vedic dharma, we’ve seen how the vedas asks Hindū kings to uphold the Vedic Supremacy and spread the so-called vedic-truths.So do vedas allow using “sword” for the spread of vedic Dharma? Or is sword used by Hindūs to spread their religion? Or what do a Hindū King have to do to spread his Vedic truth and how? And how is a Hindū King need to spread Vedic dharma? Well, parts of these questions are pretty clear, from the earlier quoted Vedic verses, but let’s focus a bit more on preachng of Vedic dharma and the methods shown by vedas.</span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:#000080;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><strong style="font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">Vedic dharma and the sword – An unbreakable relationship:</span></strong></span></span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">So why do vedas sanctify Hindū Kings or command Hindū Kings to subdue all regions, conquer all parts of the earth and control every being?Why is this the foremost duty of a Hindū King? Well, so that the same sword used to subdue all the civilizations of earth could be used to spread the Vedic dharma! And this is quite explicit from the following verse.</span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><strong style="font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">“O learned person</span></strong>, just as the sun kindled in forefront of Mornings, with forward light, long-active, waxing mighty, with thirty three supernatural powers of nature, the Thunder-wielder, smites dead the cloud, and throws light on the portals, so do thou <strong style="font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:red;">with the help</span></span></strong><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:red;"><strong style="font-style:inherit;">of warriors kill the foes,</strong></span><strong style="font-style:inherit;"> and <span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:red;">open the doors of knowledge and religion</span></strong></span>.”</span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">– [Yajurveda Ch 20, verse 36, pg.221, Tr. Devi Chand]</span></span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">This is crystal clear! Above Vedic verse <span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">commands killing foes and opening the doors of knowledge and religions</span>, meaning that the Vedic dharma is to be spread with sword after conquering the lands, curtailing the army of enemies! And we find protestant Hindūs claiming Islām was spread with sword when their own religion commands to spread their Vedic dharma with sword so what should such a behaviour be labeled as? Hypocrisy! Look how Hindū Kings and soldiers are asked to spread their religion with sword! What more proof will an unbias person need to acknowledge the hypocrisy of Mūlshankar and his cult?</span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">Once a Hindū King is in power or is ruling any tribe/nation/island his <strong style="font-style:inherit;">foremost</strong> duty according to vedas is to “<strong style="font-style:inherit;">strengthen thy rule over the Earth</strong><em style="font-weight:inherit;">”, (foremost because this same sword and rule then can be used to force vedic dharma on the conquered people)</em><strong style="font-style:inherit;"> </strong>then<strong style="font-style:inherit;"> </strong>he is to look after the administration…etc of the earth and then he is <strong style="font-style:inherit;">“propagate the religious truth”.</strong>So we see that the reason behind subduing the entire earth and controlling it is the “<strong style="font-style:inherit;">foremost” </strong>duty of king so that vedic dharma can easily be forced upon the people!</span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">Now let’s see how vedas are to be preached? Well, again let vedas talk,</span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">“<strong style="font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">For them</span></strong>, who are the protectors of paths and pedestrians, the producers of corn on the earth, <strong style="font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:red;">who fight with full force, against their enemies</span>, <span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:red;">we transport our weapons to places a thousand leagues afar.</span></strong><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:red;"> <strong style="font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">For them, who with arrows in their hand, and armed with sword</span></strong></span><strong style="font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">, <span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:red;">preach the study of the vedas</span></span></strong> <strong style="font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">and the <span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:red;">use of ships</span>, we <span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:red;">send out weapons</span> to <span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:red;">places a thousand leagues afar</span></span></strong>.”</span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">– [Yajurveda, Ch. 16, verses 61-62, pg175-176, Tr. Devi Chand]</span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">This is the way how vedas are preached! Hindūs fight the enemy with full force and transport weapons to thousands of leagues far so as to spread their Vedic dharma.And Hindūs are also commanded, to preach the study of vedas armed with sword and arrows, and using the ships to send out weapons to the Hindū armies killing, looting, usurping lands and forcing Vedic dharma on other civilizations, preaching with swords and hands in arrow inorder to awe-inspire the people so that they may leave their religions and embrace the vedic dharma..The above verse clearly instructs the Hindūs to launch a dharma Yudh against other civilizations and nations; so as to annihilate their enemies and spread the vedas with sword, nothing can be clearer than this.Sword and deadly weapons used for preaching!</span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">No wonder the vedas, praise those who carry swords, quiver sharp weapons and bows!</span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">“Food to the bold, the prudent and the mild. <strong style="font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:red;">Homage to him who carries sword and quiver</span></span>. <span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:red;">Homage to him who hath sharp weapons</span>, and is equipped with brave warriors. <span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:red;">Food to him who possesses good weapons and good bows</span>.</strong>” – [Yajurveda, Ch. 16, Verse 36, pg. 172. Tr. Devi Chand]</span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">People carrying harmful and deadly weapons are praised by vedas! And now we know why! We think it is crystal clear that vedas instruct Hindū kings, and Hindūs to dominate the world, subdue other civilizations and religions on it and control everything on it, so as to open the door for Vedic dharma and spread it and preach it with sword.</span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">We’ve seen protestant Hindūs spewing venom against Islam alleging that it was spread through swords whereas their own “Holy” books instruct them to do so. So what is such behaviour called? Well this has been apparent throught out the article and we’ve asked this question again and again so that our readers may see the extent of, these Islāmopobes in unethicalness. Well, such behaviour is called “double standards” or “hypocrisy”.</span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;">Jesus Christ (peace be upon him) Aptly said</p>
<blockquote style="font-weight:bold;color:#000000;">
<p style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">“Judge not, that you be not judged. For with the judgment you pronounce you will be judged, and with the measure you use it will be measured to you. Why do you see the speck that is in your brother’s eye, but do not notice the log that is in your own eye? “</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>A Short Analysis on Women&#8217;s Inheritance in Vedas</h3>
<p>Written by Sulaiman Razvi<br />
<span id="more-627"></span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">It was due to the influence of other religions like Islam that some Hindu revivalist found the need to reform Hindu society. Hindu scholars fail to furnish any Hindu text which entitles a woman to inherit her father&#8217;s property, this is because there isn&#8217;t a single authoritative text which allows a woman to inherit paternal property. It is mentioned in Vedas,<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Krishna Yajur Veda 6.5.8.1 </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;">Women are powerless, have no inheritance, </span>and speak more humbly than even a bad man.<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">It is mentioned in Baudhayana in the inheritance section,</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Baudhayana Dharma Shastra 2.2.3.46 The Veda declares, &#8216;Therefore women are considered to be <span style="color: #ff0000;">destitute of strength </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;">and of a portion</span></span>.&#8217;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">In the Rig Veda,<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Rig Veda 3.31.2 </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&#8216;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">&#8216;<span style="color: red;">The son does not transfer paternal wealth to his sister</span></span>. He makes her receptacle of the embryo of her husband. When parents procreate children of either sex, <span style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;">one (the male) becomes the performer of holy rites (he is the legal inheriter)</span>, the other (the female) is to be enriched with gifts.&#8221; Tr. Svami Satyaprakash Saraswati</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Below is the Hindi translation by Shri Ram Sharma,<br />
</span></p>
<p id="oPSjcNZ"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="548" height="121" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7639 " src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/img_5f25742e208e6.png" alt="" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/img_5f25742e208e6.png 548w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/img_5f25742e208e6-300x66.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 548px) 100vw, 548px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">This verse is further elaborated by Yaska,<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Nirukta 3.6 &#8216;<span style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;">Na Jamaye&#8217; means not for the sister</span>. Jamih (sister) is (so called because) others beget &#8216;Ja&#8217;, i.e. offspring, on her, or the word may be derived from (the root) jam, meaning to go : she has mostly to go (to the husband&#8217;s family). The legitimate, i.e. one&#8217;s own son, left, i.e. gave, wealth. He made her the place of depositing the seed of her husband, i.e. the man who accepts her hand. <span style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;">If the mothers have engendered Vahni, i. e. a son, and Avahni, i.e. a daughter, one of them, i.e. the son and the heir, becomes the procreator of children</span>, and the other, i.e. the daughter, is brought up and given away (in marriage) to another person.<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">The verse speaks for itself. This is enough to prove whether women could inherit her paternal wealth or not. Svami Satya Prakash Saraswati wrote in the brackets of the verse that the son is the legal inheritor &#8221;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> (he is the legal inheriter)</span>&#8221; Below is the snapshot from his book<br />
</span></p>
<p id="MvlOfQp"><img decoding="async" width="394" height="115" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7640 " src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/img_5f25743d853b7.png" alt="" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/img_5f25743d853b7.png 394w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/img_5f25743d853b7-300x88.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 394px) 100vw, 394px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">The Hindu law is governed by Mitakshara and Dayabhaga schools of law. In the Hindu Undivided Family (HUF) the head of the family is known as Karta. Usually Karta is a male member and only male members enjoy coparcener&#8217;s interest. After the death of the Karta the eldest son takes the property (as per Manu Smriti), although property can be divided in the presence of Karta as Maharishi Manu himself divided his property among his sons while he was alive.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Krishna Yajur Veda 3.1.9 Manu divided his property among his sons.<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">A daughter can inherit property only if she has no brother that too only if her father makes her the Appointed Daughter. If the daughter begets a Son then the son becomes the legal heir and is adopted by his maternal grandfather. Yaska states,<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Nirukta 3.5 <span style="text-decoration: underline;">One should not marry a brotherless maiden</span>, <span style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;">for his (the husband&#8217;s) son belongs to him (to the father of the girl)</span>. From this, the prohibition of marrying a brotherless maiden and the father&#8217;s right to appoint his daughter as a son are evident. When a father selects a husband for his unmarried daughter, he unites himself with a tranquil mind.<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Pandit Jaydev Sharma (Arya Samaj) writes on Rig Veda 3.31.1<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;"> &#8221;The grandson shall be the legal heir of his grandfather&#8217;s property&#8221;<br />
</span></p>
<p id="CQlHipI"><img decoding="async" width="477" height="295" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7641 " src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/img_5f25744c9cd56.png" alt="" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/img_5f25744c9cd56.png 477w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/img_5f25744c9cd56-300x186.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 477px) 100vw, 477px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">It is mentioned in Purana,<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Bhagwad Puran 10.57.37 &#8220;<span style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;">Since Satrajit had no sons, his daughter&#8217;s sons should receive his inheritance</span>. They should pay for memorial offerings of waler and pinda, clear their grandfather&#8217;s outstanding debts and keep the remainder of the inheritance for themselves.<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">It&#8217;s clear that Vedas does not give rights of inheritance to women, Vedas nor the Brahmanas enables the daughter to inherit property. Even an appointed daughter can&#8217;t hold her father&#8217;s property after she begets a son. Inheritance in Hinduism is the exclusive right of Sons only.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am reproducing some excerpts written by a Hindu scholar named Swami B.V. Giri. Who has proved Puranas and Itihas as part of the Vedas which is contrary to what Arya Samajis are promoting on the internet. He considers Puranas and Itihas to be the fifth Vedas, he has put forth this arguement on the basis of Vedas and other scriptures. According to Swami Giri Vedas are corrupted and 94% of the Vedas are lost, the present Vedas contain only 6% of the original text and there is no use of Vedas in this age thus Puranas are much superior than Vedas.<br />
<span id="more-1960"></span><br />
Written by Swami B.V. Giri</p>
<p><strong>OBJECTION: In your arguments you have mostly quoted <em>purana-vakya</em> (quotes from Puranic texts) to substantiate your points. However, this is unacceptable. The <em>Vedas</em> are eternal as they emanate from the Lord Himself (<em>apaurusaya</em>), whereas the <em>Puranas</em> and <em>smrti-sastras</em>, although they give knowledge about God, are authored by men. They are auxiliary to the <em>Vedas</em> and hence their statements should be considered as secondary when compared to the statements made in the <em>Vedas</em>. Therefore, in order to validate your claims, you must give quotes from <em>sruti</em> only.</strong></p>
<p><strong>REFUTATION:</strong> That the <em>Vedas</em> are eternal and <em>apauruseya</em> is a fact that all <em>sampradayas</em>, including the school of Sankara, unanimously agree with. They constitute the means of receiving knowledge about the Absolute Truth. However, there are certain factors that make it practically impossible to study the <em>Vedas</em> in this age:</p>
<p id="pWEIpKn"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="288" height="239" class="size-full wp-image-7205  alignleft" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/img_5f23fe9dbeb17.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>  After Srila Vyasadeva divided the <em>Vedas</em> into four books (<em>Rg, Yajur, Sama</em> and <em>Atharva</em>), his disciples further divided them into 1,130 divisions. This is stated in the <em>Kurma Purana</em> (52.19-20):</p>
<p class="verse"><em>eka-vimsati-bhedena rg-vedam krtavan pura<br />
sakhanam satenaiva yajur-vedam athakarot</em></p>
<p class="verse"><em>sama-vedam sahasrena sakhanam prabibheda sah<br />
atharvanam atho vedam bibedha navakena tu</em></p>
<p class="translation">‘Previously the <em>Rg Veda</em> was divided into 21 sections, the <em>Yajur Veda</em> into 100 sections, the <em>Sama Veda</em> into 1,000 sections and the <em>Atharva Veda</em> into 9 divisions.’</p>
<p>Each division has 4 minor divisions, namely the <em>Samhitas, Brahmanas, Aranyakas</em> and <em>Upanisads.</em> Thus altogether the 4 <em>Vedas</em> contain 1,130 <em>Samhitas,</em> 1,130 <em>Brahmanas,</em> 1,130 <em>Aranyakas,</em> and 1,130 <em>Upanisads.</em> This makes a total of 4,520 divisions.<br />
At present, most of these texts have disappeared due to the influence of time. We can only find 11 <em>Samhitas</em>, 18 <em>Brahmanas</em>, 7 <em>Aranyakas</em> and 220 <em>Upanisads</em> which constitutes a mere 6% of the entire Vedic canon!</p>
<ol>
<li>Even if the <em>Vedas</em> were complete in there entirety, in order to understand them one must first study the <em>Vedangas</em> which includes <em>Siksa</em> (the science of phonetics), <em>Vyakarana</em> (grammatical rules), <em>Kalpa</em> (ritualistic rules), <em>Nirukta</em> (obscure word meanings), <em>Chanda</em> (Metres for chanting Vedic hymns), and <em>Jyotisa</em> (astrology and astronomy).</li>
<li>Since the language of the <em>Vedas</em> is enshrouded in mysterious meanings, one must also be willing to sacrifice years of study in order to learn <em>Vaidika</em> (classical) Sanskrit. This entails primarily learning the basic grammar (which generally takes 12 years or so) and then memorising extra vocabulary in order to decipher the mystical language of the <em>Vedas</em>. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">1</span></li>
</ol>
<p>Apart from that, it is practically impossible for those born in the age of Kali (who are generally ‘<em>mandah sumanda-matayo</em>’) to memorise even the slightest thing. What to speak of the entire <em>Vedas</em> or even the 6% that still survives today! At present, amongst the <em>brahmana</em> communities in India, it is generally observed that <em>vedadhyayana</em> simply consists of memorising the text of one of the four <em>Vedas</em> ‘parrot-fashion’, but as we can see from above, there is much more to it than that. Therefore, we may conclude that although the <em>Vedas</em> are perfect <em>sabda-pramana</em>, it is impractical to become thoroughly conversant with the <em>Vedas</em> in this day and age in order to understand the Supreme. Hence the solution lies in the <em>Puranas</em> and the <em>Itihasas.</em> This is explained in the following verse &#8211;</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light">
<p class="verse"><em> bharata-vyapadesena hyamnayarthah pradarsitah<br />
vedah pratisthah sarve sarve purane natra samsayah</em></p>
<p class="translation">&#8220;On the pretext of writing the <em>Mahabharata</em>, Vyasa explained the meaning of the <em>Vedas</em>. Certainly all the topics of the <em>Vedas</em> have been established in the <em>Puranas.</em>&#8221; (<em>Visnu Purana</em>)</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is explained in the <em>Mahabharata</em> (<em>Adi Parva</em> 1.267) and <em>Manu Samhita</em> –</p>
<p class="verse"><em>itihasa puranabhyam vedam samupabrmhayet</em></p>
<p class="translation">&#8221; One must complement one’s study of the <em>Vedas</em> with the <em>Itihasas</em> and the <em>Puranas.</em>&#8220;</p>
<p>In the <em>Prabhasa-khanda</em> of the <em>Skanda Purana</em> (5.3.121-124) it is said –</p>
<p class="verse"><em>veda-van niscalam manye puranartham dvijottamah<br />
vedah pratisthitah sarve purane natra samsayah</em></p>
<p class="verse"><em>bibhety-alpa-srutad vedo mam ayam calayisyati<br />
itihasa-puranais tu niscalo’yam krtah purah</em></p>
<p class="verse"><em>yan na drstam hi vedesu tad drstam smrtisu dvijah<br />
ubhayor yan na drstam hi tat puranah pragiyate<br />
yo veda caturo vedan sangopanisado dvijah<br />
puranam naiva janati na ca sa syad vicaksana</em></p>
<p class="translation">&#8221; O best of the <em>brahmanas</em>, the meaning of the <em>Puranas</em> is unchanging just like that of the <em>Vedas</em>. The <em>Vedas</em> are all sheltered within the <em>Puranas</em> without a doubt. The <em>Veda</em> has a fear that unqualified people will read her and then distort her meaning. Thus, the significance of the <em>Veda</em> was fixed in the <em>Puranas</em> and <em>Itihasas.</em> That which is not found in the <em>Vedas</em> is found in the <em>Smrti</em>. That which is not found in the <em>Smrti</em> is to be found in the <em>Puranas</em>. Those who know even the <em>Vedas</em> and <em>Upanisads</em> are not learned if they do not know the <em>Puranas</em>.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p id="AUanNYs"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="262" height="155" class="size-full wp-image-7206  alignright" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/img_5f23febf07008.png" alt="" /></p>
<p> The reason they are called ‘<em>Puranas</em>’ is because they make the <em>Vedas</em> complete (<em>puranat puranam iti canyatra</em>). This is not to suggest that the <em>Vedas</em> are incomplete. It simply means that the <em>Puranas</em> are explanatory supplements which aid one to understand the concise and ambiguous passages in the <em>Vedas.</em> If the <em>Puranas</em> complete the <em>Vedas</em>, it is only logical that they must be Vedic in nature.<br />
Our Tattvavadi friends have stated that <em>Puranic</em> evidence is secondary to those statements of the <em>sruti</em> because they are composed by mortals. Generally it is correct to state that the <em>sruti</em> is primary and the <em>smrti</em> secondary in that it (<em>sruti</em>) seeks to elaborate on the meaning of the <em>smrti.</em> However, under the circumstances, the <em>puranas</em> and <em>itihasas</em> are now to be considered primary evidence. As regards the mortal composition of the <em>puranas</em> and <em>Itihasas</em>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">2</span> we beg to differ with this view, on the basis of the following references in the <em>sruti-sastras</em></p>
<blockquote class="quote-light">
<p class="verse"><em>rcah samani chandamsi puranam yajusa saha<br />
ucchistaj-jajnire sarve divi deva divi-sritah</em></p>
<p class="translation">&#8220;The <em>Rg, Sama, Yajur</em> and <em>Atharva</em> became manifest from the Lord, along with the <em>Puranas</em> and all the Devas residing in the heavens.&#8221; (<em>Atharva Veda</em> 11.7.24)</p>
<p class="verse"><em>sa brhatim disam anu vyacalat tam itihasas ca puranam ca gathas ca itihasasya ca sa vai puranasya ca gathanam ca narasamsinam ca priyam dhama bhavati ya evam veda</em></p>
<p class="translation">&#8220;He approached the <em>brhati</em> meter, and thus the <em>Itihasas, Puranas, Gathas</em> and <em>Narasamsis</em> became favorable to him. One who knows this verily becomes the beloved abode of the <em>Itihasas, Puranas, Gathas</em> and <em>Narasamsis</em>.&#8221; (<em>Atharva Veda</em> 15.6.10–12)</p>
<p class="verse"><em>evam ime sarva veda nirmitah sa-kalpah sa-rahasyah sa-brahmanah sopanisatkah setihasah sanvakhyatah sa-puranan</em></p>
<p class="translation">&#8220;In this way, all the <em>Vedas</em> were manifested along with <em>the Kalpas, Rahasyas, Brahmanas, Upanisads, Itihasas, Anvakhyatas</em> and the <em>Puranas.&#8221;</em> (<em>Gopatha Brahmana, purva</em> 2.10)</p>
<p class="verse"><em>nama va rg-vedo yajur-vedah sama-veda atharvanas caturtha itihasa-puranah pancamo vedanam vedah</em></p>
<p class="translation">&#8220;Indeed, <em>Rg, Yajur, Sama</em> and <em>Atharva</em> are the names of the four <em>Vedas.</em> The <em>Itihasas</em> and <em>Puranas</em> are the fifth <em>Veda.&#8221; (Kauthumiya Chandogya Upanisad 7.1.4)</em></p>
<p class="verse"><em>asya mahato bhutasya nihsvasitam etad yad rg-vedo yajur-vedah sama<br />
vedo’tharvangirasa itihasah puranam ityadina</em></p>
<p class="translation">&#8220;O Maitreya, the <em>Rg, Yajur, Sama</em> and <em>Atharva Vedas</em> as well as the <em>Itihasas</em> and the <em>Puranas</em> all manifest from the breathing of the Lord.&#8221; <em>(Madhyandina-sruti, Brhad-aranyaka Upanisad</em> 2.4.10)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From these above <em>sruti</em> statements it is clear that the <em>puranas</em> are part of the <em>Vedas</em> and originate from the same source as the <em>Vedas</em>, namely the Supreme Lord Himself. One may argue that since the <em>Puranas</em> have names such as <em>Skanda, Agni, Markandeya</em> etc. they must have been composed by those personalities, therefore they are not eternal and thus cannot be apauruseya. However, if that is the case, then certain sections of the <em>Vedas</em> must also be considered to be <em>pauruseya-vakya</em> since they have names like <em>Katha</em> <em>Upanisad, Aitareya Upanisad</em> (Katha and Aitareya being names of sages). It is understood that certain parts of the <em>Vedas</em> are named after certain <em>rsis,</em> not because they composed them, but because they were the main exponents of those portions. Since persons with the names <em>Katha</em> and <em>Aitareya</em> appear in every millenium, one should not misunderstand that before the appearance of those persons described in the <em>Vedas</em>, these names were simply meaningless words.</p>
<p id="nPGgFwG"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="252" height="171" class="size-full wp-image-7207  alignleft" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/img_5f23fed3311f7.png" alt="" /></p>
<p> Similarly many of the <em>Puranas</em> are named after the first person who expounded them. Many times however, due to the influence of time, a scripture may become forgotten on this planet and thus a deva or sage speaks it again, and it becomes known by that name. Such an example is found in the <em>Bhagavatam</em> wherein the sun-god imparts the <em>Vajasaneyi-samhita</em> of the <em>Yajur Veda</em> to Yajnavalkya Muni –</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light">
<p class="verse"><em>atha ha bhagavams tava carana-nalina-yugalam tri-bhuvana-gurubhir<br />
abhivanditam aham ayata-yama-yajus-kama upasaramiti.</em></p>
<p class="verse"><em>evam stutam sa bhagavan vaji-rupa-dharo ravih<br />
yajumsy ayata-yamani munaye ’dat prasaditah</em></p>
<p class="translation">&#8220;Therefore, O lord, with prayers I approach your two lotus feet, which are adored by the preceptors of the three worlds, because I wish to receive from you <em>mantras</em> of the <em>Yajur Veda</em> that are unknown to anyone else.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Being pleased by such exaltation, the sun-god took the form of a horse and presented to the <em>muni</em> <em>mantras</em> of the <em>Yajur Veda</em> which were previously unknown to any mortal.&#8221; (<em>Bhagavata</em> 12.6.72-73)</p>
<p>In his treatise Visnu Tattva Vinirnaya, Sri Madhva, quoting Brahmanda Purana explains thus:</p>
<p class="verse"><em>puranani tadarthani sarge sarge’nythaiva tu<br />
kriyante’tastvanityani tadarthah purva-sargavat<br />
vedanam srsthivakyani bhaveyurvyaktyapeksaya<br />
avantarabhimananam devanam va vyapeksaya<br />
nanityatvat kutastesamanityatvam sthiratmanam</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, the <em>Puranas</em> are supposed to explain the meaning of the <em>Vedas</em> and are only different by the changes in words, chanda (metre), rsi, sequence etc. at the beginning of each creation. In this way they are considered to be non-eternal, but their meaning will be the same as in the previous creation.<br />
Therefore Madhva categorizes the <em>Puranas</em> as <em>‘nitya-anitya’</em> because they originally emanate from the Supreme Lord, but they are sometimes unmanifest.<br />
As a side note, it may be asked that if the <em>Puranas</em> are indeed subsidiary to the <em>sruti-sastras,</em> why does Sri Madhvacarya himself quote them so often in his works? Not only that, he even uses <em>puranic</em> evidence in order to establish the <em>nityatva</em> of the <em>Vedas!</em> If the <em>Puranas</em> are not eternal and <em>apauruseya,</em> why would he use their ‘secondary statements’ as a <em>pramana</em> to validify something which is superior?<br />
Another point is that in the chanting of the <em>Brahma-yajna</em> (formal study of the <em>Vedas</em>), the <em>Puranas</em> are included. If they were not <em>Vedic</em> in nature they would not be included. Therefore the <em>Taittiriya Aranyaka</em> (2.9) states <em>yad brahmananitihasa-puranani</em>: &#8220;The <em>Itihasas</em> and <em>Puranas</em> are <em>Vedas.&#8221;</em><br />
It has already been stated above in the quote from <em>Chandogya Upanisad</em> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">3</span> that the <em>Puranas</em> are known as the fifth Veda. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">4</span> The reason behind this is because the <em>Puranas</em> and <em>Itihasas</em> are derived originally from the <em>Yajur Veda.</em> This is explained by <em>Sri Suta</em> in the <em>Vayu Purana-</em></p>
<blockquote class="quote-light">
<p class="verse"><em>itihasa-purananam vaktaram samyag eva hi<br />
mam caiva pratijagraha bhagavan isvarah prabhuh<br />
eka asid yajur-vedas tam caturdha vyakalpayat<br />

purana-samhitas cakre puranartha-visaradah</em></p>
<p class="verse"><em>yac-chistam tu yajur-veda iti sastrartha-nirnayah</em></p>
<p class="translation">&#8220;That almighty Lord (Sri Vyasa) chose me as the qualified speaker of the <em>Itihasas</em> and the <em>Puranas</em>. In the beginning there was only one <em>Veda</em> – the <em>Yajur Veda</em>. This was divided into four portions. From these stemmed the four performances known as the <em>catur-homa</em> by which he (Vyasa) arranged for the performance of sacrifice. The <em>Adhvaryu</em> priest uses the <em>Yajur mantras,</em> the <em>Hotra</em> priest uses the <em>Rg mantras,</em> the <em>Udgata</em> priest uses the <em>Sama mantras,</em> and the <em>Brahma</em> priest uses the <em>Atharva mantras.</em></p>
<p class="translation">O best of all the <em>brahmanas</em>, after this he (Vyasa) who understands the meaning of the <em>Puranas</em>, compiled them and the <em>Itihasas</em> by combining various <em>akhyanas, upakhyanas</em> and <em>gathas</em>. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">5</span> Whatever remained after Vyasa had divided the <em>Vedas</em> into four divisions was considered to also be the <em>Yajur Veda.</em> Thus is the conclusion of the <em>sastras.&#8221; </em>(<em>Vayu Purana</em> 60.16-18, 21-22)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The statement of Sri Suta Gosvami in the above verse from <em>Vayu Purana</em> in which he says that ‘Whatever remained after Vyasa had divided the <em>Vedas</em> into four divisions was considered to also be the <em>Yajur Veda</em>’ indicates that the essence of the original <em>Purana</em> (which was the remaining part of the <em>Yajur Veda</em>) became the condensed version of the <em>Purana</em> consisting of four-hundred-thousand <em>slokas</em>, available on the earth-planet.<br />
Further evidence for this is found in the <em>Matsya Purana</em> (53.8-9)wherein the Lord says –</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light">
<p class="verse"><em>kalenagrahanam matva puranasya dvijottamah<br />
vyasa-rupam aham krtva samharami yuge yuge</em></p>
<p class="translation">&#8220;O best of the <em>brahmanas</em>, understanding that the <em>Purana</em> would gradually become forgotten, in every <em>yuga</em> I appear in the form of Vyasa and condense it.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the next <em>sloka</em> of that <em>Purana</em>, the Lord continues –</p>
<p class="verse"><em> catur-laksa-pramanena dvapare dvapare sada<br />
tad astadasadha krtva</em> <em>bhur-loke’smin prabhasyate<br />
adyapyamartya-loke tu sata-koti-pravistaram<br />
tad artho’tra catur-laksah sanksepena nivesitah</em></p>
<p class="translation">&#8220;The <em>Purana</em> contains four-hundred-thousand verses which is divided into eighteen parts. These are passed on via oral tradition every Dvapara-yuga on the earth-planet. Even today the original <em>Purana</em> which consists of one-billion verses exists in the heavenly planets. The essential meaning of that <em>Purana</em> is contained in the smaller version of four-hundred-thousand verses.&#8221;</p>
<p>The same point is raised in the <em>Vayaviya Samhita</em> (7.1.1. 37-38) –</p>
<p class="verse"><em>sanksipya caturo vedams caturdha vyabhajat prabhuh<br />
vyasta-vedataya khyato veda-vyasa iti smrtah<br />

<p class="verse"><em>sanksiptam ityatra teneti sesah</em></p>
<p class="translation">&#8220;That Lord who is most intelligent then divided the <em>Vedas</em> into four. He therefore became known as Veda Vyasa. He also summarized the <em>Puranas</em> into four-hundred-thousand verses which are still available in the heavenly domain in the form if one billion verses.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, it should be explained that although the <em>Puranas</em> and <em>Itihasas</em> are known as the fifth <em>Veda —</em> that does not mean that they are literally identical in all ways with the <em>Vedas</em>. If that were so, <em>Purana</em> and <em>Itihasa</em> would just be names of certain sections of the <em>Vedas</em>. The difference between them is in annotation and the order of words. The <em>Vedas</em> are chanted in a particular style involving three tone accents (<em>svaras</em>) called <em>udatta</em>, <em>anudatta</em> and <em>svarita</em>. If a word is chanted in the wrong accent, the whole meaning of the sentence can change.<br />
As regards the order of words, the <em>Vedas</em> maintain a particular sequence which has not changed since the dawn of creation. There is no scope for even the slightest change in the Vedic texts, whereas the texts of the <em>Puranas</em> change according to <em>kalpa-bheda</em>. It is for this reason that we find occasional differencies in certain editions of the <em>Puranas.</em><br />
Another distinction between the <em>Vedas</em> and the <em>Puranas</em> is that although the <em>Puranas</em> are considered part of the <em>Brahma-yajna</em>, they are not used in the performance of Vedic sacrifices.<br />
Unfortunately, major problems also arise when trying to studsy the <em>Puranas.</em> Firstly, although the <em>Puranas</em> are much more accessible than the <em>Vedas</em> and more readily available, they too are not available in their entirety. The eighteen <em>Puranas</em> and eighteen <em>Upa-Puranas</em> are a vast body of literature and there are so many different versions that it is difficult to know which editions are complete and which texts have been interpolated. This is due to the fact that there are no current disciplic schools nor bona-fide commentaries for most of these works.<br />
Secondly, we can understand that independent study of the <em>Puranas</em> yields no fruit since each seems to establish a different deity as Supreme. By studying the <em>Puranas</em> without proper guidance, the result is only confusion. <em>Matsya Purana</em> (53.65, 68-69) states –</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light">
<p class="verse"><em>pancangam ca puranam syad akhyanam itarat smrtam<br />
sattvikesu ca kalpesu mahatmyam adhikam hareh<br />
rajasesu ca mahatmyam adhikam brahmano viduh<br />
tadvad agnes ca mahatmyam tamasesu sivasya ca<br />
sankirnesu sarasvatyah pitrnam ca nigadyate</em></p>
<p class="translation">&#8221; A <em>Purana</em> consists of five elements, as opposed to an <em>Akhyana</em>. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">6</span> The <em>sattvika</em> <em>Puranas</em> glorify Hari; the <em>rajasika Puranas</em> glorify Brahma, and the <em>tamasika</em> <em>Puranas</em> glorify Siva and Agni. <em>Puranas</em> dealing with mixed modes of nature glorify Sarasvati and the fore-fathers.&#8221; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">7</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The divisions of the eighteen <em>Puranas</em> is defined by Lord Siva to Uma in the <em>Padma Purana</em> (<em>Uttara Khanda</em> 236.18-21):</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light">
<p class="verse"><em>vaisnavanam naradiyam ca tatha bhagavatam subham<br />
garudam ca tatha padmam varaham subha-darsane</em></p>
<p class="verse"><em>sattvikani puranani vijneyani subhani vai<br />
brahmandam brahma-vaivarta markandeyam tathaiva ca<br />
bhavisyam vamanam brahmam rajasani nibodha me<br />
matsyam kaurmam tatha laingam saivam skandam tathaiva ca<br />
agneyam ca sad etani tamasani nibodha me</em></p>
<p class="translation">&#8221; O beautiful lady, one should know that the <em>Visnu, Naradiya, Bhagavata, Garuda, Padma</em> and <em>Varaha</em> are all in the mode of goodness. The <em>Brahmanda, Brahma-vaivarta, Markandeya, Bhavisya, Vamana</em> and <em>Brahma</em> are in the mode of passion. The <em>Matsya, Kurma, Linga, Siva, Skanda</em> and <em>Agni</em> are in the mode of ignorance.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sri Krsna has clearly expressed in <em>Bhagavad-gita</em> that goodness is superior to passion and ignorance. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">8</span> Similarly, Sri Suta Gosvami explains in the <em>Bhagavata</em>(1.2.24) that &#8220;Passion is better than ignorance because it can lead to realization of the Absolute Truth.&#8221;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">9</span> In this verse Suta speaks about which type of worship produces the ultimate benefit, and his conclusion is that one can only achieve the best result by worshipping Lord Visnu. The <em>sattvika Puranas</em> recommend the worship of Visnu / Krsna, whereas the <em>rajasika</em> and <em>tamasika Puranas</em> advocate the worship of minor deities and therefore do not lead the aspirant towards the Absolute Truth.<br />
It is noteworthy that the <em>sattvika Puranas</em> commence with a questioner inquiring from a learned speaker about the nature of the Absolute. The speaker’s answers are clear, direct and unambiguous, leaving no room for misinterpretation. However, in the <em>tamasika</em> and <em>rajasika Puranas</em> questions are put to the speaker which do not pertain to the Absolute Truth. For example, in the <em>Linga Purana</em> the sages request Suta to speak about the glories of the Lingam form of Lord Siva. We may conclude from this that although Sri Suta Gosvami is learned in transcendental subject matters and expert in explaining them, the questions by the sages here restrict him from speaking on it. All <em>rajasika</em> and <em>tamasika</em> <em>Puranas</em> contain this characteristic defect and therefore are not reliable sources of transcendental knowledge.<br />
One may ask at this point why Srila Vyasadeva wrote these <em>Puranas.</em> According to the various desires of the materially conditioned <em>jivas</em>, he arranged the <em>Puranas</em>. Nevertheless, all <em>Puranas</em> contain glorification of Lord Visnu. This was included by Vyasa in order that those in the lower modes of passion and ignorance will slowly develop interest in the Supreme Lord Hari while studying the <em>rajasika</em> and <em>tamasika Puranas.</em> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">10</span>Therefore in the <em>Hari Vamsa</em> (3.323.34)it is said –</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light">
<p class="verse"><em>vede ramayane caiva purane bharate tatha<br />
adav-ante ca madhye ca harih sarvatra giyate</em></p>
<p class="translation">&#8220;In the <em>Vedas</em>, the <em>Ramayana, Puranas</em> and <em>Mahabharata</em>, from the very beginning to the end, as well as within the middle, only Hari, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is explained.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yet it must be understood that although <em>rajasika</em> and <em>tamasika Puranas</em> do not speak extensively on the Absolute Truth, this does not mean that they give no valid knowledge at all. If this was the case why would <em>acaryas</em> such as Madhva cite from <em>Puranas</em> such as <em>Skanda, Brahma, Brahmanda, Brahma-vaivarta</em> etc which are not <em>sattvika</em> by nature? The <em>Puranas</em> in the lower modes may also give some insight into the Absolute Truth, although not to the same extent as the <em>sattvika Puranas.</em><br />
By this we may conclude that the <em>sattvika Puranas</em> are the ultimate <em>pramana</em>. This is also declared by the <em>Padma Purana &#8211; sattvika moksa-dah proktah: </em>&#8220;The <em>sattvika Puranas</em> give salvation.&#8221; Unfortunatly, as stated before, there are no current disciplic schools nor bona-fide commentaries for most of these works. Some of the <em>sattvika Puranas</em> recommend the path of <em>bhakti,</em> while others glorify the path of <em>jnana</em> or <em>yoga.</em><br />
One possibility to resolve this dilemma is to study the <em>Vedanta-sutra</em>. This work of Vyasadeva contains the essence of the <em>Vedas</em> and the <em>Puranas.</em> Still, the language of the <em>Vedanta-sutras</em> is ambiguous to say the least, and has therefore been interpreted in a number of ways by numerous scholars ( Madhva, Sankara, Ramanuja, Bhaskara, Bodhayana, Dramida, Guhadeva to name but a few). The foundations of many of the <em>sutras</em> lie in Upanisadic passages, yet Vyasa does not mention in his work as to which passages the particular <em>sutra</em> is commenting on. Thus both the student and the commentator must determine this for themselves. It is no wonder then that Vedavyasa felt discontent even after compiling the <em>Vedas</em>, <em>Puranas</em>, <em>Mahabharata</em> and <em>Vedanta-sutra &#8211;</em></p>
<blockquote class="quote-light">
<p class="verse"><em>tathapi bata me daihyo hy atma caivatmana vibhuh<br />
asampanna ivabhati brahma-varcasya sattamah</em></p>
<p class="translation">&#8220;I am feeling incomplete, although I am fully equipped with everything required by the <em>Vedas</em>.&#8221; (<em>Bhagavata</em> 1.4.30)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reason for his discontentment was then explained by Narada Muni –</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light">
<p class="verse"><em>jijnasitam susampannam api te mahad-adbhutam<br />
krtavan bharatam yas tvam sarvartha-paribrmhitam</em></p>
<p class="translation">&#8220;You have completed your inquiries and your studies in the proper fashion, and you have written a great and wonderful work, the <em>Mahabharata</em>, which elaborately explains the different goals of life.&#8221; (<em>Bhagavata</em> 1.5.3)</p>
<p class="verse"><em>bhavatanudita-prayam yaso bhagavato ’malam<br />
yenaivasau na tusyeta manye tad darsanam khilam</em></p>
<p class="translation">&#8220;You have not actually broadcast the sublime and spotless glories of the Personality of Godhead. That philosophy which does not satisfy the transcendental senses of the Lord is considered worthless.&#8221;</p>
<p class="verse"><em>yatha dharmadayas cartha muni-varyanukirtitah<br />
</em><em>na tatha vasudevasya mahima hy anuvarnitah</em></p>
<p class="translation">&#8220;O best of sages, since you have broadly described the four goals of human life beginning with religious performances, you have not described the glories of the Supreme Personality, Vasudeva.&#8221; (<em>Bhagavata</em>1.5.8-9)</p>

<p> On the advice of Narada, Vyasa meditated and the <em>Bhagavata</em> was manifest to him. This is the natural commentary of Vyasa’s own <em>sutras</em> (<em>artho’yam brahma-sutranam</em>) and thus includes the purport of the entire <em>Vedic</em> literature (<em>vedartha-paribrmhitah</em>) It is free from the problems that we find with the <em>Vedas</em> and the other <em>Puranas</em> – it is available in it’s entirety, it has commentated upon by various Vaisnava <em>acaryas</em>, it is divinely composed and <em>Puranic</em> in nature. In it’s opening <em>sloka</em> it gives the essence of the <em>Vedas</em> since it begins with the holy <em>gayatri mantra·</em> (<em>gayatri-bhasya-rupo ’sah</em>) which is itself the essence of the <em>vedas.</em> This is also confirmed in the <em>Matsya Purana</em> (53.20-22) and <em>Agni Purana</em> (272.6.7) &#8211;</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light">

<p class="translation">&#8220;That <em>purana</em> is known as the <em>Bhagavata</em> which gives the highest religious principles, refers to the sacred <em>gayatri mantra</em>, and tells the story of the slaying of Vrtasura. This <em>purana</em> has 18,000 verses and whoever writes down the entire text and places it on a golden throne and gives it in charity to a qualified person on the day of the full-moon of the month of Bhadra will attain the Supreme abode.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most importantly, the <em>Bhagavata</em> is the crowning glory of the divine author’s literary efforts, soothing his heart when he felt that his work remained incomplete.<br />
There are many verses that praise the <em>Bhagavata</em> above all the other <em>Puranas.</em> In the <em>Skanda Purana</em> (<em>Visnu-khanda</em> 6.4.3) it says –</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light">
<p class="verse"><em>srimad bhagavatasyatha srimad bhagavatah sada<br />
svarupam ekam evasti sac-cid-ananda-laksana</em></p>
<p class="translation">&#8220;The <em>Bhagavata</em> and the Supreme Lord are always of the same nature – possessed of eternal existence, knowledge and bliss.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the <em>Visnu Khanda</em> of the <em>Skanda Purana</em> (5.16.40-42, 44,33) –</p>
<p class="verse"><em>sataso &#8216;tha sahasrais ca kim anyaih sastra-samgrahaih<br />

<p class="translation">&#8220;If the <em>Bhagavata</em> is not kept in one&#8217;s house in the Kali Yuga, of what avail are collections of other scriptures by the hundreds and thousands? How can he be condidered a Vaisnava who, in the Kali Yuga, does not keep the <em>Bhagavata</em> in his house? Even if he is a <em>brahmana,</em> he is lower than an outcaste. O Narada, O Sage, wherever the <em>Bhagavata</em> is found in the Kali-yuga, there Hari goes together with all the demigods. O Muni, that pius soul who daily recites a verse from the <em>Bhagavata</em> reaps the fruits of the eighteen <em>Puranas</em>.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the <em>Padma Purana</em> (<em>Uttara-khanda</em> 193.3)</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light">
<p class="verse"><em>puranesu tu sarvesu srimad bhagavatam param<br />
yatra prati-padam krsno giyate bahudharsibhih</em></p>
<p class="translation">&#8220;Of all the <em>puranas</em>, the <em>Bhagavata</em> is the greatest. In every line the sages glorify Sri Krsna in various ways.&#8221;</p>
<p>Also in the <em>Padma Purana &#8211;</em></p>
<p class="verse"><em>padau yadiyau prathama-dvitiyau trtiya-turyau kathitau yad-uru<br />

This <em>Bhagavata</em>, containing eighteen thousand verses, is known as the explanation of all Vedic literature.&#8221;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">11</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong> CONCLUSION:</strong> In this way we have shown through the <em>pramana</em> of the <em>srutis, smrtis, Itihasas</em> and <em>Puranas</em> that the <em>Mahabharata</em> and the <em>Puranas</em> are indeed considered to be the fifth <em>Veda</em>, and that they are of higher importance and significance in the age of Kali than the four <em>Vedas</em>. Of them, the highest is the the <em>Bhagavata</em>, the crest-jewel of all the Vedic literatures. For this reason the <em>Bhagavata</em>(1.3.43) says:</p>
<p class="verse"><em>krsne sva-dhamopagate dharma-jnanadibhih saha<br />
kalau nasta-drsam esa puranarko’dhunditah</em></p>
<p class="translation">&#8220;The <em>Bhagavata</em> is as brilliant as the sun. After Sri Krsna has left for His abode, accompanied by <em>dharma</em> and knowledge, it has arisen to save us from the darkness of the age of Kali.&#8221;</p>
<p>____________________________</p>
<p class="note"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">1</span>&#8211; This is affirmed by Lord Krsna in the <em>Bhagavata</em> (11.3.44) – &#8220;<em>paroksa-vada vedo’yam&#8221;</em> (The <em>Vedas</em> speak indirectly).</p>
<p class="note"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2</span>&#8211; In the case of the <em>Bhagavata,</em> this itself is a contradiction from the point of view of the Madhva <em>sampradaya.</em> If the <em>Vedas</em> are considered a primary authority merely because they issued from the mouth of God Himself, the <em>Bhagavata</em> and <em>Mahabharata</em> should also fall into such a category since the author of these works was Veda Vyasa, whom the Tattvavadis consider to be a direct <em>avatara</em> of Narayana.</p>
<p class="note"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">3</span>&#8211; This verse from <em>Chandogya Upanisad</em> is also quoted by Madhvacarya in <em>Visnu Tattva Vinirnaya</em> (5). It is also worth noting that in Prof. K.T. Pandurangi’s work The <em>Principal Upanisads</em> (Dvaita Vedanta Studies and Research Foundation, Bangalore 1999) wherein he explains Madhvacarya’s <em>Upanisad</em> commentaries, the author gives the same meaning of this verse.</p>
<p class="note"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">4</span>&#8211; This is also confirmed in the <em>Bhagavata</em> (1.4.20):</p>
<p class="verse note"><em>rg-yajuh-samatharvakhya<br />
vedas catvara uddhrtah<br />
itihasa-puranas ca<br />
pancamo veda ucyate</em></p>
<p class="translation note">&#8220;The <em>Vedas</em> were divided into four, namely <em>Rg, Yajur, Sama</em> and <em>Atharva</em>. The <em>Itihasas</em> and the <em>Puranas</em> are said to be the fifth <em>Veda</em>.&#8221;</p>
<p class="note"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">5</span>&#8211; In his <em>tika</em> on the <em>Visnu Purana</em> 3.6.16, Srila Sridhara Svami explains these terms thus:</p>
<p class="verse note"><em>svayam-drstartha</em>&#8211;<em>kathanam prahur akhyanakam budhah srutasyarthasya<br />
kathanam upakhyanam pracaksate gathas tu pitr-prthivyadi gitayah</em></p>
<p class="translation note">&#8220;An <em>Akhyana</em> is a description of that which is witnessed by the speaker. An <em>Upakhyana</em> is a description of something the speaker has not seen, but merely heard about. A <em>Gatha</em> is a song dedicated to the forefathers and beings present upon the earth.&#8221;</p>
<p class="note"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">6</span>&#8211; The word <em>sankspitam</em> in this verse is important. This means ‘condensed’ and not ‘composed’. In other words Sri Vyasa condensed the already existing <em>Vedas</em>, then taking unused verses from that condensed portion, he compiled the <em>Puranas</em>. Thus, the <em>Puranas</em> must be understood to be equal to the <em>Vedas</em>.</p>
<p class="note"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">7</span>&#8211; The five elements of a <em>Purana</em> are described in <em>Matsya Purana</em> (53.65) &#8211;</p>
<p class="verse note"><em>sargas ca pratisargas ca<br />
vamso manvantarani ca<br />
vamsyanucaritam caiva<br />
purana panca-laksanam</em></p>
<p class="translation note">&#8220;The five subjects which make up a <em>Purana</em> are creation (<em>sarga</em>), secondary creation (<em>pratisarga</em>), geneology of kings (<em>vamsa</em>), the description of the Manus (<em>manvantara</em>) and the activities of those kings (<em>vamsanucarita</em>). &#8220;</p>
<p class="note"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">8</span>&#8211; In this verse the word ‘<em>agni</em>’ (fire) refers to the Vedic sacrifices wherein one offers oblations into various sacred fires. ‘<em>Kalpesu</em>’ means ‘scripture (in this case <em>Purana</em>) according to the definition given in the Medini Sanskrit dictionary 1.21.2 (<em>kalpa sastre vidhau nyaye samvarte brahmane dine</em> – the word <em>kalpa</em> means ‘scripture’, ‘rule’, ‘logic’, and ‘day of Brahma’.) The word ‘<em>ca</em>’ in the phrase ‘<em>sivasya ca</em>’ implies the consort of Lord Siva, namely Goddess Uma. ‘<em>Sankirnesu</em>’means ‘in the various <em>Puranas</em> which are in mixed modes of goodness, passion and ignorance. The word ‘<em>sarasvatyah</em>’ refers to the presiding deity of speech and, by implication, the various devas referred to in various scriptures which she embodies. <em>’Pitrnam’</em> refers to the <em>karma-khanda</em> rituals meant for attaining the heavenly planets of the manes (<em>karmana pitr-lokah</em>).</p>

</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: black; font-family: MS Reference Sans Serif;">With the onset of British rule in India, which was formalised in 1857, the country witnessed the emergence of new religious movements among both Hindus and Muslims. These movements were related to the race for numbers among Hindu and Muslim elites, with political power for each community in the new dispensation linked to its numerical strength. Hindu and Muslim religious revivalist organisations and movements began to vie with each other to bring the oppressed castes into their respective folds. In part, this was clearly motivated by the desire to bolster the political fortunes of the &#8216;upper&#8217; caste Hindu and Muslim elites, who claimed to speak for all of their co-religionists.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-2258"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: black; font-family: MS Reference Sans Serif;">Numerous such movements emerged within the larger Hindu fold at this time. Many of them aimed at Hinduising the Shudras and preventing their conversion to Islam and Christianity. Some of them also sought to woo back into the Hindu fold Hindu converts or their descendants who were now Christians and Muslims. One such movement was the Brahmo Samaj, which was founded in 1830 by Ram Mohan Roy, a Bengali Brahmin. Although Ram Mohan Roy critiqued many superstitious and idolatrous aspects of popular Hinduism, he did not mount a radical critique of the caste system, Brahminism, and Brahminical supremacy. It is said that, following orthodox Brahminical practice, he employed a Brahmin cook, and refused all his life to remove his <em>janeo</em>, the &#8216;sacred&#8217; thread that is the distinguishing mark of orthodox Brahmins.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: black; font-family: MS Reference Sans Serif;">Among the major aims of the Brahmo Samaj were defending Hinduism from the criticism of Christian and Muslim missionaries, halting the rapid conversion of Hindus to Christianity and Islam,   Hinduising the Shudras, and, at the same time, preserving the hegemony of the Brahmins. These were aims that it shared with another revivalist neo-Hindu movement that emerged at around this time, the Arya Samaj. This movement was founded in 1875 by a Gujarati Brahmin called Mool Shankar, more popularly known as Dayanand Saraswati. Alarmed by the mass conversion of Shudras, particularly Dalits, to Christianity and Islam, Dayanand sought to prevent them from doing so by offering them the illusion of upward social mobility within the Hindu fold. Thus, for instance, he argued that Shudras, too, had the right to recite the Vedas and don the <em>janeo</em>, and claimed that caste was to be based on worth rather than birth.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: black; font-family: MS Reference Sans Serif;">At the same time as he sought to appeal to the Shudras, Dayanand firmly upheld the caste system and &#8216;upper&#8217; caste hegemony. Accordingly, he continued to accept the authority of the <em>Manusmriti</em>, which he profusely quoted in his magnum opus <em>Satyarth Prakash</em> or &#8216;The Light of Truth&#8217;. He approvingly refered to a verse in the <em>Manusmiriti</em> that declares a principal task of the king to be to ensure that all the four <em>varna</em>s strictly abide by their <em>varna</em>-determined duties, that is to say caste-based roles.<span style="color: #147dba; text-decoration: underline;">[i]</span> In a debate in Benaras with Tara Charan, a Sanatani or orthodox Hindu pundit, he rebuffed the latter for seeking to adduce evidence from the <em>Puran</em>as on the grounds that he accepted the authority only of the <em>Manusmriti</em> and certain other texts that he claimed were based on the Vedas.<span style="color: #147dba; text-decoration: underline;">[ii]</span> The question thus arises that if Dayanand considered the <em>Manusmiriti</em> to be authoritative, how could he possibly be thought to have radically critiqued caste, as is commonly claimed? After all, with the exception of a few verses, the only subjects that the <em>Manusmriti</em> talks about are caste, social hierarchy, untouchability, discrimination, Brahminical supremacy and the degradation and exploitation of the Shudras. Given all this, how was it at all possible for the Shudras to find genuine liberation in and through the Arya Samaj?<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: black; font-family: MS Reference Sans Serif;">The fact of the matter is that, despite its claims to social reform and equality, the Arya Samaj stood solidly for caste inequality, discrimination and the <em>varnashrama dharma</em>. In fact, Dayanand Saraswati himself showed no qualms in exhibiting his distaste for Chandals, Shudras and other such so-called &#8216;low&#8217; castes. For instance, he opined that sinners of a certain sort turned into elephants, horses, lions, wolves, boars and Shudras and Mlecchas<span style="text-decoration: underline;">[iii]</span>, another class into trees, and yet another class into Chandals.<span style="text-decoration: underline;">[iv]</span> It is true that he declared it permissible for the <em>dwija</em>s, the so-called &#8216;twice-born&#8217; or &#8216;upper&#8217; caste Hindus, to eat food cooked by Shudras, but this should not be thought of as a call for radical social equality, for the argument he gave for this was that the <em>dwija</em>s—Brahmins, Kshatriyas and Vaishyas—had other tasks to do. Further, it is instructive to note that this was not a blanket permission for eating food cooked by Shudras, for Dayanand added that the <em>dwija</em>s should desist from eating food cooked in a Shudra&#8217;s house except under dire necessity, and that too if the Shudra had taken a bath and his clothes were clean. He also insisted that if a Shudra were to cook food in an Arya&#8217;s home, he should cover his mouth to ensure that his saliva did not touch the food or else it would be contaminated. Moreover, he added, the Shudra must serve food to the Arya and then eat himself.<span style="text-decoration: underline;">[v]</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: black;"><span style="font-family: MS Reference Sans Serif;">In response to a query as to whether there was any harm in eating food cooked by any person being irrespective of caste on the grounds that the bodies of all humans, from Brahmins to Chandals, are made of the same flesh and bones and contain the same blood, Dayanand replied, &#8216;Yes, there is harm. A Brahmin and Brahmini are fed on the very best of foods. Hence, their bodies are formed out of the reproductive elements that are free from impurities and other harmful elements.&#8217; But this, he claimed, was not true of the bodies of Chandals and Chandalnis, or Chandal women, which were, so he put it, &#8216;simply laden with dirt and other foul matter.&#8217; That is why, he insisted, Brahmins and other &#8216;upper&#8217; castes must eat together and desist from eating food touched by Chandals, Bhangis, Chamars and other &#8216;low&#8217; castes. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">[vi]</span></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 7pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: black; font-family: MS Reference Sans Serif;">Despite projecting himself as saviour of the Shudras, Dayanand actually stood for their continued slavery under Brahminism. It was not, as is commonly thought, that he forcefully condemned Brahminism or that he radically challenged all the various oppressive rules that the Brahmins had devised to subjugate the Shudras. Thus, critiquing followers of the Brahmo Samaj and the Prarthna Samaj for not abstaining from eating with the English, Muslims and Chandals, Dayanand wrote that these groups were deluded if they thought that by flouting the rules of caste, including those related to commensality, they were reforming society. In actual fact, he argued, they were &#8216;ruining it&#8217;.<a title="" href="http://mail.google.com/mail/?ui=2&amp;view=js&amp;name=main,tlist&amp;ver=3MrFuNWYWnI.en.&amp;am=!1StPGZ3BG1yxhZxijtQ2ZErllibWZVIVh5O5JSfTWY0CryYpjy97&amp;fri" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right"><span style="color: #147dba; text-decoration: underline;">[vii]</span><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> Consistent with this belief, Dayananad is said to have refused to eat in the house of even a Brahmin if he knew that food had been cooked by a &#8216;low&#8217; caste man or woman. His biographer Pandit Lekh Ram narrates one such incident. In 1879, while on a trip to Dehra Dun, a Brahmo Samajist named Babu Kali Mohan Ghosh invited Dayanand to his house for a meal. Dayanand replied that he had no qualms in eating in his house but added that he had heard that Brahmo Samajists sometimes employed &#8216;low&#8217; caste cooks. This, he said, he did not approve of. The Babu admitted that Brahmo Samajists did not consider it wrong to eat food cooked by anyone, irrespective of caste, but said that he himself did not have a &#8216;low&#8217; caste cook. Thereupon, Dayanand agreed to eat at his house.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: black;"><span style="font-family: MS Reference Sans Serif;">The next day, Pandit Lekh Ram writes, his own brother, Har Gulal, informed him that Dayanand had accepted the Babu&#8217;s invitation. Hearing this, Pandit Lekh Ram took some food and went straight to Dayanand&#8217;s room. He gave the food to him to eat, and told him that he had committed a major blunder by accepting the Babu&#8217;s invitation because at one time a Bhangi woman used to cook food in his house. Dayanand replied that he had no knowledge of this and that the Babu had cheated him. He returned to the Babu the food he had sent for him and, instead, ate the food that Pandit Lekh Ram had brought.<span style="color: #147dba; text-decoration: underline;">[viii]</span></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: black; font-family: MS Reference Sans Serif;">From all this it is clearly evident that Dayanand&#8217;s Arya Samaj aimed not at the emancipation, but, rather, at the subordination of the Shudras so as to preserve and promote Hinduism or Brahminism in the face of the challenge of Islam and Christianity. It aimed at keeping the Shudras firmly within the Hindu fold, at the very bottom of the <em>varna</em> hierarchy. Like many other &#8216;upper&#8217; caste Hindus of his time, Dayanand felt that if the Shudras were not prevented from converting out of the Hindu fold, the very existence of Hinduism would be under under grave threat since the hegemony of the &#8216;upper&#8217; castes rested on the labour and the degradation of the Shudras. That is why the Arya Samaj appeared to make some minor concessions with regard to the rules of caste and untouchability, although these did not amount to any real threat to Brahminical hegemony. Dayanand, it can be said, established the Arya Samaj only to save Brahminism from death. He tried to interpret the Hindu scriptures in such a way as to kill the rising spirit of revolt among the Shudras, to co-opt them firmly into the Hindu fold, and make them even better slaves of the &#8216;upper&#8217; castes. <span style="font-size: 12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: black; font-family: MS Reference Sans Serif;">Just as the Arya Samaj tried to woo the Shudras into its fold, Christian missionaries, belonging to various denominations, sought to do the same across large parts of India. The flood of Shudra converts to Christianity, and, to a lesser extent, Islam, goaded groups such as the Arya Samaj to reach out to the Shudras whom otherwise they might not have been at all concerned about. Christian missionaries brought along with them modern education and medicine, and certainly served the poorest of the poor. Yet, as with the Hindus and Muslims, caste could not be eradicated among the Indian Christians, who continue to be divided on caste lines.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: MS Reference Sans Serif;">Although the Arya Samajists and the Christian missionaries saw themselves as inveterate foes, they both made concerted attempts to woo Muslims of indigenous Shudra descent and convert them to their respective folds. The Arya Samaj invented the <em>shuddhi</em> ritual to bring into the Hindu fold non-Hindus, including Muslims and Christians who had once been Hindus or who were descendants of Hindu converts. In the early 1920s, they scored considerable success in their missionary endeavours among some isolated<em>nau-musalman</em> groups of &#8216;low&#8217; caste status who had been only very lightly Islamised over the centuries and who still retained many of their pre-Islamic customs and beliefs. To facilitate this missionary campaign, Arya Samajist scholars penned tracts deeply critical of Islam, and engaged in fierce debates with Muslims on religious matters. Christian missionaries did the same. As a response, various Muslim organisations soon emerged to engage in missionary or <em>tabligh</em> work. Faced with the challenge of the Christian and Arya Samajist missionaries, these Muslim leaders realised that the existence of caste and caste-based discrimination within the Muslim fold left many &#8216;low&#8217; caste Muslim groups vulnerable to apostasy. This was a clarion call to Muslim leaders to wake up from their deep slumber, to combat the evils of caste in their society, to recognise the acute problems of the &#8216;low&#8217; caste Muslims, and to try to exemplify, in their own lives and in society at large, the Islamic teachings of social equality and brotherhood.<span style="font-size: 10pt;"><br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Written by Ibn Muhammad</p>
<p>The &#8216;once upon a time&#8217; stories do not appeal to me anymore. Pick up any such story and it is a pure fiction. No wonder kids love such stories. Agniveer&#8217;s latest response (should it be even called a response) is purely fictional, a castle of lies to deceive the ordinary people and a desperate attempt to repair his lost credibility. The so-called response deals more with teaching ways of mockery than a serious response to our research article. By addressing about half of the article to senseless insults, he hoped to distract his blind followers from the seriousness of our article. He invents some &#8216;Panchatantra&#8217; stories which have no space in a scholarly discussion. I do not have this time and energy to write similar stuff. I only concern myself to what is being said, instead of who is saying it.</p>
<p><span id="more-901"></span></p>
<p>The lies of Agniveer start outright when he says,</p>
<p>A recent attempt has been by writing articles based on extremely outdated claims to prove that Vedas are also textually corrupted. <strong>We initially chose to ignore this long-rejected stupid research.</strong> We thought that someone else would counter it along with flat-earth theory while we focus on other prominent tasks. But considering the widespread promotion that is being provided to this viewpoint by petro-dollar power holders, we thought to have at least a short analysis debunking the myth. Because in an era of misinformation, truth is often nothing but a lie shouted thousand times!</p>
<p>Did Agniveer really ignore my article? I published my article on March 16, 2011. There was a consternation in the Vedic camp. See the comments section of Agniveer. Then, I made a video on the main points of my article. The video can be seen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ueydb0yQN_g" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">here<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. Since Agniveer is no scholar of the Vedas, he must have tried first to somehow refute me. When he couldn&#8217;t he appealed more knowledgeable Arya Samajis for help. Agniveer started a new separate thread in the Arya Samaj community on orkut. Here is the link to the thread.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131015022445/http:/www.orkut.co.in/CommMsgs?cmm=146924&amp;tid=5600429116996922782" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">http://www.orkut.co.in/CommMsgs?cmm=146924&amp;tid=5600429116996922782<br />
<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>As you can see Agniveer desperately appealing for help from his associates. The associates, being more wise than Agniveer, felt the gravity of my arguments. One associate advised Agniveer not to be hasty and come to Bilaspur and learn the Vedas properly. But Alas, Agniveer, who is an IIT pass-out considered it below his dignity to go and learn the Vedas properly. The hasty rebuttal he has published on his website clearly exposes his shallow knowledge of the Vedas.</p>
<p>You can also notice in the link given above, that there is a lot of infighting among Hindus on the exact nature of shaakhaas (branches). They started to cut each others viewpoints and poke fun at each other. If the very brains to whom Agniveer went begging for help could not solve the problem, you can imagine of what quality the borrowed rebuttal of Agniveer would be.</p>
<p>Agniveer is so scared of our website that he dared not mention the <a href="/index.php/2014/01/02/textual-corruption-of-the-vedas/" data-wpel-link="internal"><strong>source article</strong></a> which he was refuting. He never mentioned my name. This speaks volumes of the spirit inculcated in him by the Vedas. At least he should have let his audience know what he is refuting. Instead he chose to paraphrase my arguments so that they look ordinary. Agniveer hopes to keep his blind followers in the dark. But for how long. The wind of truth will soon blow apart the structure of lies.</p>
<p>Ignoring the unnecessary rants of Agniveer, I would directly go into the subject and expose the asinine arguments of Agniveer.</p>
<p><strong>What is the total number of Vedas?</strong></p>
<p>Agniveer has resorted to mighty deception to somehow do away with this vital question which will shake the very foundations of the Arya Dharma/Hinduism call it what you like. It seems that this IIT pass-out has to be taught the fundamentals of counting. Let me give you an example, to rip apart his tapestry of deception.</p>
<p>Agniveer wrote,</p>
<p>If you consider only knowledge, Vedas is only 1. If you consider <strong>Para and Apara</strong> knowledge (liberating and mundane knowledge), then Vedas are 2. If you focus on <strong>Knowledge, Action and Contemplation</strong>, Vedas are 3. If you consider <strong>Rik, Yajuh, Sama, Atharva</strong>, Vedas are 4. If you consider each mandala of Rigveda as separate, then there are 10 Rigvedas. Similarly we have 40 Yajurvedas. If you take each mantra as a different Veda, you have more than 20,000 Vedas.</p>
<p>So number does not matter. They all point to same set of mantras.</p>
<p>What deception?</p>
<p>Consider the letters of the English alphabet. How many letters are there in the English alphabet? Every good student will answer 26. But one IIT pass-out says, &#8220;it depends&#8221;. If you consider only <strong>alphabet</strong> there is only 1. If you consider  <strong>vowels and consonants </strong>there are 2. If you consider <strong>&#8216;the English alphabet&#8217;</strong> there are 17. If you consider <strong>a, e, i, o, u</strong> there are 5. If you consider <strong>b, c, d, f, g, h, j, k, l, m, n, p, q, r, s, t, v, w, x, y, z</strong> there are 21.</p>
<p>So number does not matter. They all point to the same set of letters.</p>
<p>Does not this IIT pass-out need to be sacked from his job immediately if he is employed? Should not his degree be declared fraudulent? Is this man not a danger to society who can sell his integrity to defend some primitive texts? He cannot even differentiate between the words &#8216;number&#8217; and &#8216;type&#8217;. This  simpleton IIT pass-out has been so shocked by our research that he has lost all sense. I had  heard a joke on engineers, but did not know that engineer was the great Agniveer himself.</p>
<p><strong>Ques: Prove that 2/10=2.</strong></p>
<p>Art student : Out of syllabus<br />
Commerce student : Question hi galat hai<br />
Medical student : It&#8217;s strange yaar, ye kaise ho sakta hai?<br />
Agniveer : It is very easy</p>
<p>2=two<br />
10=ten,</p>
<p>Therefore,  2/10 = two/ten</p>
<p>cancelling (t) we get</p>
<p>wo/en—- (1)</p>
<p>W=23rd letter of the alphabet<br />
O=15th letter of the alphabet<br />
E=5th letter of the alphabet<br />
N=14th letter of the alphabet</p>
<p>therefore,</p>
<p>w+o=23+15=38<br />
&amp; e+n=5+14=19<br />
.<br />
Substituting these values in (1)</p>
<p>wo/en = 38/19 = 2<br />
<strong><br />
Hence proved!</strong></p>
<p>And the blind followers of Agniveer shout, &#8220;Hail Agniveer Ji&#8221;.</p>
<p>Let me remind Agniveer that when I asked the question, <strong>&#8216;What is the total number of Vedas?&#8217;</strong>, I meant <strong>&#8216;What is the total number of Veda Samhitas?&#8217;</strong> By the title <strong>&#8216;Textual corruption of the Vedas&#8217;</strong> is implied <strong>&#8216;Textual corruption of the Veda Samhitas&#8217;</strong>.</p>
<p>Having said that let us post mortem the dead refutation of Agniveer.</p>
<p>Agniveer has conveniently evaded the testimony of Mahabharata that Vedas were stolen from Brahma, demonstrating their insecurity. It also proved that Vedas were NOT memorized. Agniveer has ignored this. After all Mahabharata has also been written by his own ancestors. Is it not an insult to his ancestors, to accept their one work and reject the other?</p>
<p><strong>The Number of Veda Samhitas</strong></p>
<p>Traditionally the number of Veda Samhitas has been fixed as 4 viz. Rigveda, Yajurveda, Samaveda and Atharvaveda. But this reply does not tell the whole story. Why? Things will become more clear when you will read all of this article.</p>
<ol>
<li>The Rigveda, containing hymns to be recited by the hotr;</li>
<li>The Yajurveda, containing formulas to be recited by the adhvaryu or officiating priest;</li>
<li>The Samaveda, containing formulas to be sung by the udgātr.</li>
<li>The Atharvaveda, a collection of spells and incantations, apotropaic charms and speculative hymns.</li>
</ol>
<p>One information must be remembered. The words Rigveda, Yajurveda, Samaveda and Atharvaveda are NEVER mentioned in the Veda Samhitas. All these names have been given by Brahmins to identify the books. The earlier terms referred to the different styles of composition, They were:</p>
<ol>
<li>ricah, stanzas of praise</li>
<li>yajunsh, liturgical stanzas and formulas</li>
<li>saman, melodies</li>
<li>atharvangirasah, blessings and curses.</li>
</ol>
<p>But the collection which now goes by the name of Rig-veda contains in its later parts &#8216;blessings and curses&#8217;, as well as &#8216;stanzas of praise&#8217;, together with most of the stanzas which form the text to the saman melodies of the Sama-veda. Similarly the Atharva-veda contains ricah, &#8216;stanzas of praise, and yajunshi, &#8216;liturgical stanzas&#8217; mostly worked over for its own purposes, as well as its characteristic &#8216;blessings and curses&#8217;. The Yajur-veda also contains matter of the other Vedic types in addition to liturgical formulae. The Sama-veda is merely a collection of certain ricah or &#8216;stanzas of praise&#8217;, taken with variations and additions from the Rig-veda, and set to tunes indicated by musical notations.</p>
<p>So each Veda Samhita is a mixture of all types of mantras. Thus, Rigveda can be called Samaveda , Atharvaveda and vice-versa. Atharvaveda can be called Rigveda or Yajurveda. Same is the case with other Veda Samhitas.</p>
<p>Now to our burning question,<strong> what is the total number of Veda Samhitas?</strong></p>
<p>Let me use the statement of Patanjali Rishi as the base to solve this question. In the Mahabhashya, he says,</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-7536" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-33.png" alt="http://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/060218_0654_testingresp1.png" width="452" height="116" /></p>
<p>The four Vedas, <strong>along-with their parts</strong> diffuse into many forms. There are 101 Shakhas of Yajurveda, 1000 of Samaveda, 21 of Rigveda and 9 of Atharvaveda.</p>
<p>Adding these numbers we get a figure of 1131 Shaakhaas. Agniveer has not responded to this basic question in a clear and coherent manner.  His dilemma can be understood. This is an issue which shakes the foundations of Vedic Dharma.. The Guru of Agniveer, when asked about this issue said,</p>
<p><strong>Q. How many Shaakhaas (branches) are there of the Veda?</strong></p>
<p>A. Eleven hundred and twenty-seven.</p>
<p><strong>Q. What are Shaakhaas (branches)? </strong></p>
<p>A. The expositions are called shaakhaas.</p>
<p><strong>Q. We hear of learned people speaking of the different parts of the Veda as shaakhaas. Are they wrong?</strong></p>
<p>A. If you think over it a little, you will understand that they are in the wrong, because all the Shaakhaas are attributed to Rishis such as Ashwalaayani and others, whilst the authorship of the Veda is ascribed to God. It other words, as the author of the four Vedas is believed to be God, so are Rishis held to be the authors of the shaakhaas, such as Ashwalaayani. And besides, all the shaakhaas take Veda texts and expound them, while in the Veda texts only are given. Therefore, the four Vedas – the books of Divine revelation – are like the trunk of a tree, whose branches (shaakhaas) are the books, such as Ashwalaayani, <strong>written by Rishis and not revealed by God</strong>… [Satyarth Prakash, Chapter 7]
<p>There is not a shred of evidence to prove that there are 1127 Shaakhaas of the Veda.  Patanjali Rishi CLEARLY says 1131 Shaakhaas.No classical text mentions 1127 Shaakhaas. The Swami is clearly lying here.</p>
<p>Agniveer wrote,</p>
<p>Oh No. Not again. Branch refers to a particular recension style of Vedas to emphasize certain aspects and making it relevant to existing time and society. <strong>Branches or Shakhas are not eternal</strong>. But original Vedas have been preserved as they were even till today.</p>
<p>The quotation of Maharishi Patanjali is very clear. <strong>The four Vedas are made of 1131 parts and these parts are the Shaakhaas and these Shaakhaas include those which are held as originals by Agniveer.</strong> Shaakal Shaakha (present Rigveda) is already included in the 21 Shaakhas of Rigveda. So, according to the confession of Agniveer even that is not eternal.</p>
<p>However, the answer to the question, &#8216;What is the total number of Veda samhitas?&#8217; is very simple. There are 1131 Veda Samhitas which on the basis of the mantra types are divided into 4. The 1131 Shaakhaas can be understood as 1131 versions of Vedas. To make it simple for you, Rigveda has 21 VERSIONS, Yajurveda has 101 VERSIONS, Samaveda has 1000 VERSIONS and Atharvaveda has 9 VERSIONS. The bogus claims of Agniveer are buried by this simple FACT that<strong> each Shaakhaa had its own Samhita, Brahman, Aranyak and Upanishad.</strong> So dear readers, what does this tell you? Either Agniveer does not know his own religion or he is lying. If it is the later it is devilish and if it is the former it is inexcusable.</p>
<p>Out of these 1131 VEDA SAMHITAS 1120 Samhitas are lost. In other words, 99% of the Vedas are LOST.</p>
<p>Notice that Swami Dayanand Saraswati says that Shaakhaas are expositions of the ORIGINAL Vedas. But Agniveer is then lying when he says,</p>
<p>&#8220;Now some fools argue that why are original Vedas are also called by name of Shakhas. The answer is that the name of Shakha is derived from the Rishi who ensured its preservation from generation to generation. Some Rishis chose to promote the variations so as to propagate their meaning among masses and specialized students. Some volunteered to continue preserving the original Vedas so that more Shakhas could be created in future. Why should we not acknowledge these Rishis? Hence Shaakal chose to preserve the Rigveda, Madhyandin chose to preserve Yajurveda, Shaunak chose to preserve Atharveveda and Kauthum chose to protect Samaveda. These refer not only to individuals but entire traditions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Can Agniveer bring any valid proof to justify his claim? There is not a shred of evidence to prove what Agniveer said. Where do classical scholars of Hinduism claim that only Shaakal Samhita is the original? That is a challenge to Agniveer. If Shaakal Rishi preserved the &#8216;original&#8217; Rigveda (Shaakal Shaakha), why are the Samhitas, Brahmans, Aranyaks and Upanishads different for each Shaakha? Agniveer is compelled to promote unorthodox ideas to defend his sect.</p>

<p>As you can see, each Shaakha has its own Samhita. There is no one Samhita. Agniveer, therefore, is clearly lying on this important issue and why should he not lie when his guru, Moolshanker, condones lying to defend their Dharma. Swami Danayanad commenting on Shakanacharya says,</p>
<p>&#8220;Now it must be understood that if it was the belief of Shankar that God and the human soul were identical and that the world was an illusion, it was not good; <strong>but if he had avowed this doctrine simply in order to refute Jainism more successfully, it was a little good.</strong>&#8221; [Satyarth Prakash, Chapter 11]
<p>So. Agniveer has already got his license to deceive.</p>
<p>Let me elaborate on the nature of the disputes between various Shaakhaas to bury Agniveer&#8217;s deceptive arguments once and for all.</p>
<p><strong>Nature of Disputes between various Shaakhaas with special reference to Yajurveda</strong></p>
<p>Comparing all the available manuscripts of the Yajurveda, we come to know that they are NOT mere expositions of the so-called originals. Rather, they contain many different mantras than those found in others. Broadly classified, Yajurveda has two branches, Krishna and Shukla. The former is predominant in South India and the latter in North India. At the time of Patanjali Rishi, the Kathaka Samhita was predominant as stated in Mahabhashya 4:3:101.</p>
<p>The different Samhitas differ in the number of mantras, arrangement of mantras, etc. Following is the brief list of the variations:</p>
<p>1. The very first mantras of all Samhitas are variant. For example see the image below.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="545" height="586" class="wp-image-7537" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-34.png" alt="http://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/060218_0654_testingresp2.png" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-34.png 545w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-34-279x300.png 279w" sizes="(max-width: 545px) 100vw, 545px" /></p>
<p>2. The last mantra of these Samhitas is also different.</p>
<p>3. There is huge difference in the total number of mantras of all these Samhitas. Vajasneyi Samhita  (Madhyandin) has 1974 mantras, Taittiriya has 1018, Maitrayani has 458, and Katha has 640 mantras.</p>
<p>4. More than 50% of Vajasneyi Samhita is imported from Rigveda. Swami Dayanand, has accepted this fact in the 33rd and 34th chapters of his Yajurveda translation. On this basis, the Vedic scholars are of the opinion that intermixing of the mantras of Yajurveda and Rigveda has actually broken the Yajurveda chain. The mutual coherence of the themes of Yajurveda has been lost and by extension the meanings have also been lost.</p>
<p>All these differences between various Samhitas of Yajurveda reveal the fact that these Samhitas are not the expositions of a so-called original Veda. Rather, these are different versions of one Yajurveda floating around. The true version cannot be found and the mutual rivalry between these versions is not hidden. The followers of one Samhita used to condemn the followers of another Samhita. For example, Shatapath Brahmana 1:7:1:3 condemns the recitation of Taittiriya Samhita.</p>
<p>&#8220;They then let the calves join their mothers. He thereupon touches (each) calf (in order to drive it away from the cow), with the formula , &#8216;The winds are ye!&#8217;–for, indeed, it is this wind that here blows, it is this (wind) that makes swell all the rain that falls here; it is it that makes those (cows) swell; and for this reason he says &#8216;the winds are ye!&#8217; Some people add here the formula,<strong> &#8216;Going near are ye!&#8217;</strong><br />
<strong>but let him not say this</strong>, because thereby another (an enemy) approaches (the sacrificer).&#8221;</p>
<p>Shatapath Brahman here is referring to Taittiriya Samhita 1:1:1:1, which contains the addional words &#8216;Going near are ye&#8217; or &#8216;Ye are approachers&#8217;. In other words, Shatapath Brahman is condemning the recitation of Taittiriya Samhita as FALSE.  Similarly, at many other places in the Shatapath Brahman, Taittiriya Samhita is criticized. How can the likes of Agniveer explain this censure of Taittiriya Samhita by Shatapath Brahman?</p>
<p>This Shaakha issue is now settled. All Shaakhaas are EQUAL contenders of being the originals. Thus there are 1131 Veda Samhitas and now we have 11 Samhitas left. Agniveer has no authority to claim exclusive originality.</p>
<p><strong>Missing Verses</strong></p>
<p>After the collection and codification of Vedas, many different manuscripts gained currency amongst the Brahmin groups. The number of mantras in every manuscript continued to be changed. The current version of Rigveda was collected by Shaakal Rishi and was thus called Shaakal Samhita. It is divided into 10 Mandals (Books).</p>
<p>Nirukt 7:8 mentions the following,</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a joint oblation offered to Agni and Vishnu in the ten books of the Rigveda.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, in the entire Rigveda, there is not a single mantra jointly praising Agni and Vishnu.  What is meant by joint oblation here? An oblation is an offering (Late Latin oblatio, from offerre, oblatum, to offer), a term, particularly in ecclesiastical usage, for a solemn offering or presentation to God. Where is an offering jointly made to Agni and Vishnu, we would like to see? This is a clear evidence that the Rigveda at the time of Yaska Muni had the joint oblation offered to Agni and Vishnu, but it is not found in today&#8217;s Rigveda, demonstrating corruption of the text.</p>
<p>Agniveer wrote,</p>
<p>1. Nirukta wasn&#8217;t preserved in the way Rigveda was. So Rigveda is much more authoritative, especially after scrutiny by even the skeptics as mentioned above.</p>
<p>What a scholarly reply? Is Agniveer prepared to delete all references of Nirukt form his website and throw Nirukt in the dustbin? Why are they still publishing and spreading a polluted book, if it really is polluted? The desperation of Agniveer can be understood. When Rigveda is being blown apart by Nirukt here, Agniveer is choosing the lesser of the two evils and casting doubt on Nirukt to save Rigveda, the source of Hinduism. However, this answer is just not satisfactory. Agniveer first needs to prove that this particular reference of Nirukt is wrong and give evidences of the same. If he is unable to do so, then Rigveda has been obviously changed. He also has to publicly announce that Nirukt is a false book and should not be used to establish anything. Hindu scholars should announce the same in public.</p>
<p>But wait a minute, let Agniveer&#8217;s deception be exposed by his own deception guru, aka Swami Dayananda. In his Magnum Opus, Satyarth Prakash, the Swami lists several books which should be read and others which should be avoided. And guess what? He just rips Agniveer apart. The Swami says,</p>
<p>&#8220;We can liken this to digging up a whole mountain and finding a penny-worth of gold; whilst the study of the books of the great sages can be well likened to the diving of a man into the sea and finding most valuable pearls in one plunge.<br />
3. Then let them read <strong>Nighantoo and Nirukta</strong> (books on Vedic Vocabulary and Philology) by Yaska in six to eight months, but not waste years of their valuable time over Amarkosha and other such books written by atheists.&#8221; [Satyarth Prakash, Chapter 3]
<p>and further down he gives a long list of books to be avoided,</p>
<p>&#8220;The books to be avoided are:-</p>
<p>1. Grammar:-a.Katantra, b. Saaraswata, c. Chandrika, d. Mugdhabodha. e. Kaumudi, f. Shekhar, g. Monorma, etc.<br />
2. Dictionary – Amarkosha, etc.<br />
3. Prosody – Urittaratnakar, etc.<br />
4. Shiksha is the Science which teaches the proper pronunciation of words and laws of euphony. Atka Shiksham Pravakshyami Pranamyan matam yatha.<br />
5. Jotisha (astronomy) – Shighrabodha, Mahurta, Chintaamani, ettc. books on astrology.<br />
6. Poetry – Naya ka bheda, Kuvabja nand, Raghuvansha, Maagha, Kiratarjunira, etc.<br />
7. Mimansa – Dharmasindhu, Vratarka, etc.<br />
8. Visheshika – Tarkasangraha, etc.<br />
9. Nyaya -Yogdishaa, etc.<br />
10. Yoga – Hathapradipka<br />
11. Saankhya – Yagavashishtha, Pancha dashi<br />
12. Medical Service – Sharangdhar.<br />
13. Smriti – all Smritis except the Manu Smirit arring the interpolated verses.<br />
14. all Tantras, Puranaas, Upapuraanaas, Ramaayaana by Tulsi Das, Rukmani Mangala, etc., and all books 9of this kind) written in Bhaashaa.</p>
<p>They ought to be looked upon as snares; once caught in them a student can never know the truth.</p>
<p><strong>Is there no truth to be found in these books?</strong></p>
<p>A.~ There is a sprinkling of truth mixed with a large amount of rubbish, myths and fabrications; but as even the best food mixed with poison is to be avoided, so should these books.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ah! These golden words must be pinned on the walls of Agniveer&#8217;s house. Agniveer has already poisoned many articles on his poisonous website with Nirukta, which according to him is false but not according to his guru. I know Agniveer is merely using deception to refute me, but deep in his heart he must be really ashamed that he condemned the great Nirukt in public.</p>
<p>Then, Agniveer is taking recourse to Indologists to save the Vedas. However, Hindu scholars themselves opine that Vedas have suffered heavy changes. Pandit Ram Gvind Trivedi writes in the preface to his translation of Rigveda,</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="538" height="150" class="wp-image-7538" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-35.png" alt="http://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/060218_0654_testingresp3.png" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-35.png 538w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-35-300x84.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 538px) 100vw, 538px" /></p>
<p>&#8220;According to one Mantra of Rigveda (10:114:8), we come to know that it has 15,000 Mantras. However, when we count the total Mantras, we get 10,469 Mantras. It is possible that  like a large portion of the books of Vedic literature and Vedas were destroyed by the anti-religious, similarly,  Mantras too suffered destruction for many reasons.&#8221;</p>
<p>Agniveer only partially quotes Indologists to deceive the people. Let him taste the same Indologists now.</p>
<p>Prof. Maurice Bloomfield writes in the Introduction to his Hymns of the Atharvaveda,</p>
<p>&#8220;<strong>The nineteenth book is a late addendum, in general very corrupt</strong>; its omission (with the exception of hymns 26, 34, 35, 38, 39, 53, and 54) does not detract much from the general impression left by the body of the collection. The seventeenth book consists of a single hymn of inferior interest. <strong>Again, books XV and XVI, the former entirely Brahmanical prose, the latter almost entirely so, are of doubtful quality and chronology.</strong> Finally, books XIV and XVIII contain respectively the wedding and funeral stanzas of the Atharvan, and are largely coincident with corresponding Mantras of the tenth book of the Rig-veda: they are, granted their intrinsic interest, not specifically Atharvanic.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dr. A.A. Macdonell echoes the same views about Atharvaveda in his book A History of Sanskrit Literature,</p>
<p>&#8220;<strong>The last two books are manifestly late additions.</strong> Book XIX. consists of a mixture of supplementary pieces, <strong>part of the text of which is rather corrupt.</strong> Book XX., with a slight exception, contains only complete hymns addressed to Indra, which are borrowed directly and without any variation from the Rigveda. The fact that its readings are identical with those of the Rigveda would alone suffice to show that it is of later date than the original books, the readings of which show considerable divergences from those of the older Veda. <strong>There is, however, more convincing proof of the lateness of this book.</strong> Its matter relates to the Soma ritual, and is entirely foreign to the spirit of the Atharva-veda. <strong>It was undoubtedly added to establish the claim of the Atharva to the position of a fourth Veda</strong>, by bringing it into connection with the recognised sacrificial ceremonial of the three old Vedas. This book, again, as well . as the nineteenth, is not noticed in the Praticakhya of the Atharva-veda. <strong>Both of them must, therefore, have been added after that work was composed.</strong> Excepting two prose pieces (48 and 49) the only original part of Book XX. is the so-called kuntapa hymns (127-136). &#8221;</p>
[A History of Sanskrit Literature, A. A. Macdonell, Printed in 1900, Page 188]
<p>Dr. Macdonell even exposes the Rigveda in the following words,</p>
<p>&#8220;The importance of the latter as a criterion of the authenticity of verses in the Rigveda is indicated by the following fact. <strong>There are six verses in the Rigveda not analysed in the Pada text, but only given there over again in the Samhita form. This shows that Sakalya did not acknowledge them as truly Rigvedic, a view justified by internal evidence.</strong> This group of six, which is doubtless exhaustive, stands midway between old additions which (Sakalya recognised as canonical, and the new appendages called Khilas, which never gained admission into the Pada text in any form.&#8221;</p>
<p>The six verses he is referring to are, Rigveda 7:59:12, 10:20:1, 10:121:10 and 10:190:1,2,3.</p>
<p>Now, Agniveer should also get rid of Atharvaveda and well as these six verses, when the Indologists are confirming it.</p>
<p>Agniveer, the misled fanatic wrote,</p>
<p>2. The Vishnu of Vedas is same as the Agni. Both refer to same Singular Supreme Entity. Only the misled see polytheism in Vedas. So joint oblation to Vishnu and Agni is applicable to any mantra that can be interpreted to imply those characteristics of Supreme that are common in meaning of Agni and Vishnu. This is a research subject for those who have skills to contemplate deeply on mantras. There is nothing conflicting in it. At best one can say that – Since I don&#8217;t know anything about Vedas because knowing that would put me in Hell, hence I cannot understand it.</p>
<p>The topic of Vedic deities is a separate one, which is beyond the scope of this article. However, to briefly respond to the bogus claims of Agniveer, he is trivializing the text of the Vedas because he thinks it is his personal property and he can twist it as he likes. Extending his bogus argument, Agnim ile purohitam can be changed to Vaishnam ile purohitam and there will be no difference. May be  Maharishi Agniveer has an intention of producing his own Samhita of Rigveda and is therefore propounding unorthodox views to deceive the people. He is going to the extent of calling Yaska Acharya &#8216;misled&#8217; because Yaska speaks of plural deities in the Vedas. Notice the original words of Yaska, &#8220;There is a <strong>joint oblation</strong> offered to Agni <strong>and</strong> Vishnu in the ten books of the Rigveda.&#8221; No person in his right mind can say that Yaska is speaking of the same deity. If Agni and Vishnu were same, then the words &#8216;joint oblation&#8217; become absurd. Agniveer is considering himself smarter than classical Hindu scholars. He is free to do all the research he needs, but he will evidently fail.</p>
<p>Agniveer wrote,</p>
<p>&#8220;3. Interestingly the very people who are currently raising this childish allegation are the ones who also attempt to prove that Vedas talk of only one Single God. But they use this argument when they want to prove that Vedas and their modern scripture both talk of the same Singular God, but because their scripture is latest, hence that latest version should be followed. Hence everyone should start believing in their religion to escape Hell.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is another proof that Agniveer is not in his right mind. Who is he talking about? Where have I ever claimed that Vedas talk of only one Single God? Agniveer needs to spend time and study my articles thoroughly before writing nonsense. I have time and time again emphasized that Vedas teach only NATURE WORSHIP, DARK POLYTHEISM AND PANTHEISM. I suggest that readers read my article <a href="/index.php/2014/01/02/what-is-hinduism/" data-wpel-link="internal">What is Hinduism?</a> to know my position on the conception of &#8216;gods&#8217; in Vedas. May be Agniveer is dreaming that I am affiliated with IRF. I do not endorse the research of IRF on Hinduism, specially the concept of God in Hinduism. Dr. Zakir Naik is wrongly propagating that Vedas speak about one God, but then again, he bases his arguments on the works of Arya Samaj. I intend to write a separate article refuting the notion that Vedas speak of one Supreme God.</p>

<p><strong>Corruption in recitation</strong></p>
<p>The oral tradition of the Vedas (Śrauta) consists of several pathas, &#8220;recitations&#8221; or ways of chanting the Vedic mantras.The padapatha consists of dividing the sentence into individual pada or words. The kramapatha consists of pairing two words at a time. There has been a lot of corruption in the former recitation. I will give some examples to demonstrate this.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1</strong></p>
<p>Yask Muni, the author of Nirukt and Nighantu, writes that Vaayah is one word [See Nirukt 6:28]. But in the Shaakal Shakha&#8217;s (Rigveda&#8217;s) padapatha, it has been divided and hence became meaningless. Rigveda 10:29:1 is the place which has made the mistake.</p>

<p>&#8220;As sits the young bird on the tree rejoicing, ye, swift Pair, have been roused by clear laudation,…&#8221;</p>
<p>Yaska himself criticizes Shakalya and says,</p>
<p>&#8220;Sakalya has analyzed <strong>Vaayah </strong>into <strong>Vaa </strong>and <strong>yah</strong>, then the finite verb would have had the accute accent and the sense have been incomplete.&#8221;</p>
<p>Agniveer wrote ,</p>
<p>Whether we take the word as &#8216;Va + Yah&#8217; or Vayo, they both are pronounced in exactly the same manner. Same is true for &#8216;Ma + Iha + Naasti&#8217;. However in Vedic mantras, these words come us Vayo and Mehanaasti. Scholars can have disputes over how the word should be interpreted. This is a research topic. Depending on their views, they can have different Pada Paatha or break-up of the words. <strong>Perhaps during Yaska&#8217;s time, someone broke the word in wrong manner and hence he had to counter it.</strong> Similar to the way even we have to counter the most outdated concepts even today despite the availability of thoroughly verified and edited Vedas!</p>
<p><strong>Pada Paatha is NOT original Vedas. </strong>It is one way of preserving Vedas. There are 9 more. Refer <a href="http://agniveer.com/2697/no-textual-corruption-in-vedas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">http://agniveer.com/2697/no-textual-corruption-in-vedas/<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. If an error comes in Pada Patha, it is corrected by comparing with other methods. And hence today, there is no doubt over what the original Vedic mantras are. (Thanks to efforts of sages like Yaska from time to time.) I recommend looking at editions of Pt Damodar Satvalekar which is accepted widely as the most corrected published version.</p>
<p>Agniveer is again shooting himself in the foot. This IITian can&#8217;t  even read properly. Yaska has not countered a &#8216;someone&#8217;, but Sakalya himself. &#8220;<strong>Sakalya</strong> has analyzed <strong>Vaayah </strong>into <strong>Vaa </strong>and <strong>yah</strong>, then the finite verb would have had the accute accent and the <strong>sense have been incomplete</strong>.&#8221; The  question  here is not whether pada patha is the original or not. The important thing to notice here is that Agniveer&#8217;s &#8216;original&#8217; Rigveda is under fire from Yaska. Yaska is exposing the mistake of Shaakal Samhita. So, agniveer is caught deceiving again. The false reading of Rigveda has continued to our time also and agniveer is reading the same.</p>
<p>Regarding <strong>Mehanaasti</strong>, Yaska is again showing how Sakalya is wrong and Gargya the author of Samaveda pada patha is right. So, Agniveer is lying here too.</p>
<p><strong>Different versions of Rigveda</strong></p>
<p>Shaakal Rishi is called as the collector of Rigveda. He had a number of students, who later expressed many differences and compiled their own versions of Rigveda. numbering upto 21. There are major differences between the Shaakal and Baskal samhitas of Rigveda. The Śākala recension has 1,017 regular hymns, while the Bāṣkala samhita has a total of 1025 hymns.  Thus, around  some 50 mantras are missing in Śākala samhita. There are differences even over the total number of mantras.</p>
<p>The detailed analysis of the mantra differences in Rigveda will be dealth in a separate article.</p>
<p><strong>Different versions of Yajurveda</strong></p>
<p>Agniveer wrote,</p>
<p>1. Black or Krishna Yajurveda is a branch (Shakha) and not original Yajurveda. It contains original mantras modified along with historical and explanatory descriptions to suit research interests of specific kind. Shukla or White Yajurveda refers to those branches of Yajurveda that modify the original mantras if required but do not add additional texts. The Madhyandini Yajurveda of Shukla Branch is the original Yajurveda and rest are its variations.</p>
<p>Another bogus claim devoid of any solid proof. I have already shown the nature of disputes between various Samhitas of Yajurveda. Refer to that discussion. There is no proof that only the Madhyandin Samhita is the original and not the others. Agniveer is conditioned to believe that Madhyandin is the original. What Agniveer is considering as original is considered an exposition in South India and vice versa. Agniveer deceptively ignored the meat of my argument. Anyway i will repeat it to sink it into his mind.</p>
<p><strong>Difference between Krishna (Black) and Shukla (White) Yajurveda</strong></p>
<p>The Vishnu Purana gives the following explanation of their names : Vaisampayana, a pupil of the great Vyasa, was the original teacher of the Black Yajur-Veda. Yajnavalkya, one of his disciples, having displeased him, was called upon by his master to part with the knowledge which he had acquired from him. He forthwith vomited the Yajur-Yeda. The other disciples of Vaisampayana, assuming the form of partridges (tittiri), picked up from the ground its several dirtied texts. From this circumstance it received the name of Taittiriya Krishna Yajur-Veda.</p>
<p>Yajnavalkya afterwards, by the performance of severe penances, induced the Sun God to impart to him those Yajur texts which his master had not possessed. The Sun God then assumed the form of a horse (Vajin), and communicated to him the desired texts. Hence the Sanhita was called Vajasaneyi, and also White (or bright) because it was revealed by the Sun God.</p>
<p>There was a lot of hostility between the two groups.</p>
<p>Agniveer wrote,</p>
<p>So in case you do not have access to original Yajurveda, start with a branch. That would be much more easy to approach due to explanations and simplifications. And when you have mastered them, you can have the taste of the original. The keen minds who are less paranoid and more zealous can approach the original directly as well!</p>
<p>Thus, as per Maharishi Agniveer, making the Madhyandin Samhita available online for common public is a mistake. They need to first read the man made books and then the original. But wait, did we not already see that Shatapath Brahman condemns Taittiriya Samhita as false. So why is Agniveer promoting false texts? May be he has some hidden agenda.</p>
<p>Agniveer wrote,</p>
<p>2. Ishopanishad is nothing but the 40th Chapter of Yajurveda as <strong>it appears in a particular branch of Black Yajurveda</strong> with some modifications. Because this is the greatest text on spiritualism and philosophy and mother of all other texts like Geeta, other Upanishads and even Darshans, it has a special place in Vedic literature. Being mother of all Upanishads, it is called Isha Upanishad. Only a paranoid can explain why he or she thinks that Isha Upanishad cannot be part of Yajurveda.</p>
<p>The deceptive game of Agniveer continues.  Agniveer just claimed in point number 1 that Black or Krishna Yajurveda is a branch (Shakha) and not original Yajurveda. But here he is taking recourse to  this very shaakha in order to establish the validity of the Ishopanishad. I told you he is a deceiver.</p>
<p>Further, according to Agniveer&#8217;s Arya Samaj, Upanishads are NOT Shruti (revealed). Then, how come has this Upanishad been added to the Veda Samhita? Maharishi Agniveer gives this reason; &#8220;Because this is the greatest text on spiritualism and philosophy and mother of all other texts like Geeta, other Upanishads and even Darshans, it has a special place in Vedic literature.&#8221;</p>
<p>The same argument is given by orthodox Hindus as well in favour of the other Upanishads being revealed texts. Why then does Agniveer not consider other upanishads as revealed also? By interpolatng an Upanishad into the Vedic samhita, Agniveer is proving that Vedas are devoid of spirituality and that man-made texts like Ishopanishad is superior to Vedas. We have always been saying that Vedic Samhitas are simply useless. Upanishads are far better than Veda Samhitas.</p>
<p>Now you can judge who is a paranoid.</p>
<p>Agniveer evades vital questions</p>
<p>In dealing with my arguments about the problems with the Yajurveda texts, Agniveer evaded answering many points with the hope that his blind followers will never check the article properly. Agniveer was so scared of the truth that he did not even give the link of our article and neither mentioned the source article he was refuting. All this exposes his grand claims that he is for truth and truth alone.</p>
<p>Questions which Agniveer did not answer:</p>
<p>1. Agniveer did not answer about the schism between the people of Black and White Yajurveda.</p>
<p>2. He did not respond to the differences between the two rival samhitas, in the number and arrangement of mantras.</p>
<p>2. Agniveer also ignored the argument that a lot of Brahamanas have been inserted into the text of the Yajurveda. For example, Adhyay 24 is entirely a Brahman; Adhyay 30: verses 7 through 15 are all Brahmanas and not Mantras. Agniveer did not respond to this. What are Brahmanas doing in Shukla Yajurveda, which he holds as original? Shatapath Brahmana 4:2:3:7-8 testifies to this interpolation of Brahmans in the Samhita as follows:</p>
<p>7. He draws it without (reciting) a puroruk; for the puroruk is a song of praise, since the puroruk is a Rik, and the song of praise is Rik; and the libation is Sâman; and what other (formula) he mutters, that is Yagus. <strong>Formerly these same (puroruk verses) were apart from the Riks, apart from the Yagus, and apart from the Sâmans</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>8. The devatas said, &#8216;Come, let us place them among the Yagus:</strong> thus this science will be still more manifold.&#8217; Accordingly they placed them among the Yagus, and thenceforward this science was still more manifold.</p>
<p>This rips aparts the deception of Agniveer that Madhyandin Samhita is the original.</p>
<p><strong>How Arya Samaj corrupts the Vedas?</strong></p>
<p>1. In the Yajurveda Bhasya of Dayanand Ji, Adhyay 9, Mantra 20 has been distorted by adding the word Gamyaat, which is not to be found in the text. Where did this word come from?</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="441" height="546" class="wp-image-7540" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-37.png" alt="http://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/060218_0654_testingresp5.png" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-37.png 441w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-37-242x300.png 242w" sizes="(max-width: 441px) 100vw, 441px" /></p>
<p>Agniveer wrote,</p>
<p>1. Did Swami Dayanand add the word in the mantra? No. The word is found only in Hindi translation in some editions. Now Swami Dayanand used to dictate meaning in Sanskrit to his pundits who would then translate it in Hindi as well as transcribe what he said.</p>
<p>But even if he or his pundit added the word in explanation, then you should be thankful to him for attempting to simplify things instead of taking exceptions.</p>
<p>2. Even if Swami Dayanand added the word in the mantra, that does not make Yajurveda corrupted. It only means that Swami Dayanand made an error. When did Vedas or Agniveer or Swami Dayanand claim that humans are fully perfect?</p>
<p>There is a marked contradiction between point 1 and 2. If point 1 is correct then point 2 is incorrect and vice versa. The Swami has added the word in bracket which means he is hoping to deceive people that this is part of the text. All the words in brackets mean they are part of the text. Agniveer would do well to remove this error (read deception) from the market.</p>
<p>2. Comparing the Yajurveda of Gayatri Parivar and Arya Samaj, there are many mantras missing in one or another of the versions. For example, the 25th Chapter of Gayatri Parivar Yajurveda has 47 mantras. Even the Yajurveda of Ralph Griffith has 47 mantras. But, the Arya Samaj version has an additional Mantra 48.</p>
<p>Agniveer, the new Maharishi, wrote,</p>
<p>1. So your anger is towards additional <strong>bonus </strong>that Arya Samaj translation gives you, if I understand properly. This means that you admit original Vedas to be a subset of existing Vedas with one less mantra. Hence there is no <strong>loss</strong> of information at least.</p>
<p>This type of bonus is present in other samhitas of Yajurveda as well, according to you. Then, all your above arguments simply stand nullified by this one. Dear readers, do you remember what Agniveer wrote earlier? If you have forgotten, I will republish the golden words,</p>
<p>&#8220;Black or Krishna Yajurveda is a branch (Shakha) and not original Yajurveda.<strong> It contains original mantras modified along with historical and explanatory descriptions to suit research interests of specific kind. Shukla or White Yajurveda refers to those branches of Yajurveda that modify the original mantras if required but do not add additional texts. </strong>The Madhyandini Yajurveda of Shukla Branch is the original Yajurveda and rest are its variations.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, according to Maharishi Agniveer, Black or Krishna Yajurveda is not original because it contains many bonuses. Therefore, I thank Agniveer for adding a bonus mantra in his so-called original and proving that his Yajurveda IS NOT ORIGINAL ANYMORE. The corollary would be like this. If one bonus mantra of Arya Samaj makes no difference to the text, then the many bonus mantras of other Samhitas proves that they are more desrving to be called originals.</p>
<p>Agniveer wrote,</p>
<p>2. Now if we review this mantra, is it against rest of the Vedas in its message? If not, then what is the cause of concern. If you get one additional sentence in Einstein&#8217;s text on relativity that was written later by an editor but only emphasizes what Einstein says in rest of the paper, how is that a problem?</p>
<p>Are the bonuses of the other samhitas against their own mantras? Then what are you telling us they are not originals? What is the cause of concern? By giving Einsteins example, you are digging your own grave. No sane person would ever edit the TEXT of Einsteins work. They will only add their explanation and they would mention that this is an explanation and not written by Einstein, so that people do not confuse it with Einsteins words. But you have added the &#8216;new bonus mantra&#8217; in the TEXT and without even mentioning in the footnote that it is not in the original. This is called fraud and we should not trust fraud people. What say you Maharishi Agniveer? Also if other Shaakhaas added explanations, which obiously do not contradict the text, are you not riding in the same boat?</p>
<p>Agniveer wrote,</p>
<p>3. This is an objection only for those who think that if they mug up the book of divine and say a big sorry for all their misdeeds and laziness to Supreme Lord, they would easily get Heaven full of virgins. But for Vedic followers, there are no shortcuts to success. You have to practice what you learn in actions and keep exploring the truth within. And when you have liberated yourself from ignorance significantly, you would well have re-ignited the Vedas within. <strong>So one harmless mantra in one edition makes absolutely no difference.</strong> The only cause of concern could have been if the verse misled you, which it does not.</p>
<p>Let Maharishi Agniveer  produce some evidence for the false charges he has made. Where have we ever said that just by muggin up the Quran and doing misdeeds will give us heaven? Where does the Noble Quran say so? How do we know that ONLY ONE HARMLESS MANTRA has been added to the text? If you can add a mantra to the text, it shows that Vedas can be made by man. Agniveer Ji, I already knew Vedas were nothing special and are man made. If the verse does not mislead me, so is the case with other Samhitas.</p>
<p>Regarding virgins of Vedic Swarga, Maharishi Agniveer can read my artcles,</p>

</ul>
<p>Did Agniveer say that for Vedic followers there are no shortcuts to success? Maharishi! haven&#8217;t you read the Vedas? If you haven&#8217;t, let me tell you the Vedic shortcuts of entering Paradise.</p>

<p>Agniveer wrote,</p>
<p>4. By the way, the 25th Chapter has only 47 mantras and that is accepted by one and all. <strong>Some publishers publish an additional mantra due to relevance of context. Perhaps someone inserted it years ago and then no printer bothered to or rather was not competent enough to scrutinize it.</strong> Please send us the name of the publisher and we shall write to him to correct the mistake. Or even you can write so referring to this article.</p>
<p>So, now you are saying it is not a &#8216;bonus mantra&#8217;? What happened dear? Let it remain there. Why bother to correct this &#8216;mistake&#8217;? If you needed a Muslim to tell you that mischief has been done to the Vedic text, then you all need to hang yourselves in shame. For 150 years you let the verse remain in the text and want to remove it now? Someone rightly said, Arya Samajis are the biggest frauds. The &#8216;bonus mantra&#8217; is given by all Arya publishers. I can only imagine, how many such mantras would have been made up &#8216;due to relevance of the context&#8217;. Poor Yajurveda. I think Agniveer should now follow Taittiriya Samhita. His Madhyandin has disappointed me. Notice that Agniveer is contradicting himself in the same mantra. On one hand he says that the &#8216;PUBLISHERS&#8217; added it due to relevance of context and on the other hand he is mocking them by saying they are not competent. If they WILLINGLY added it why will they scrutinize it?</p>
<p>3. In Yajurveda Bhashya of Dayanand Ji Adhyay 26, mantra 26, the word <strong>Ayohatay<br />
</strong> was changed to <strong>Apohatay.</strong></p>
<p>Agniveer wrote,</p>
<p>1. This is a printing mistake. Real word is Ayohate (अयोहते). Now in Devanagri script, Ya (य) and Pa (प) appear almost similar. Such errors are found in several places in Vedas because the first time they were being printed, they were being typeset from hand-written manuscripts. However Pt Damodar Satvalekar did a great job of scrutinizing all published mantras with manuscripts and manuscripts with various Paatha methods to give to us extremely authentic editions of Rigveda.</p>
<p>2. But thankfully, the meaning does not change because that was based on actual word.</p>
<p>Come on Maharishi Agniveer. You blame every mischief of your guru on the poor printers. If it was a printing error, why did the Swami translate <strong>Apohatay</strong> and not <strong>Ayohate</strong>? He translated it as &#8216;gold&#8217; instead of the actual meaning &#8216;iron&#8217;. Who are you deceiving? The Swami Brahmachari was looking for gold instead of worthless iron. Changing 1 into 11 is the old habit of Grocers. When caught out they said, &#8220;Oh man! This is only a writing error.&#8221;</p>
<p>4. In Yajurveda Bhashya of Dayanand Ji Adhyay 39, mantra 5, the word <strong>Vishyandmaane </strong>was changed to <strong>Vishpandmaane.</strong></p>
<p>Agniveer wrote,</p>
<p>Refer previous allegation.</p>
<p>How can you refer it to previous point, when this is a separate fraud? The swami has translated <strong>Vispand</strong> and not <strong>Visyand</strong>. Vispand (विष्पन्द ) means throbbing and Vishyand (विष्यन्द) means trickling. Only a fool will call it a printing error. Swami has taken Visyand deliberately to mistraslate it.</p>
<p>5. The longer ending in Yajurveda 13:58 has been deleted from Arya Samaj version, but exists in the Gayatri Parivar version .</p>
<p>Agniveer wrote,</p>
<p>It does not matter whether this text is there or not. The meaning of the phrase is implied in overall meaning of the mantras continued from Chapter 12 itself up to this last mantra of Chapter 13. So for sake of completion of meaning you can put the phrase, and for sake of brevity you can skip it. A conservative approach would be to keep it. but if focus is to understand meaning alone, it can be skipped. <strong>We suggest having the phrase for sake of completeness.</strong></p>
<p>If Veda is revealed text according to you, do you mean the Words of God do not matter? Is your God a lunatic who reveals texts in vain? I told this to a Sanatan Dharmi friend. He became upset and said, &#8220;Who the hell is Agniveer to suggest what should be Vedas and what not?&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Corruption of Samaveda</strong></p>
<p>Samaveda is heavily borrowed from the Rigveda. It consists of a collection of hymns, portions of hymns, and detached verses, all but 75 taken from the Sakala Sakha of the Rigveda, the other 75 belong to the Bashkala Sakha, to be sung, using specifically indicated melodies, called Samagana. There are differences regarding the exact number of mantras in the Samaveda. As I said earlier,  according to Patanjali&#8217;s statement, &#8220;sahasravartma samvedah&#8221; सहस्रवर्त्म<br />
समवेदः, &#8220;There are thousand branches of Samaveda&#8221;. However, only three survive:</p>
<ul>
<li>the Kauthuma Shakha is current in Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Orissa and since a few decades in Darbhanga, Bihar,</li>
<li>the Jaiminiya in the Karnatak, Tamilnadu and Kerala,</li>
<li>and the Rāṇāyanīya in the Maharastra.</li>
</ul>
<p>The total mantras in the Jaimniya Shakha is 1687. Kauthama Shakha has 1869 mantras . Thus, 182 mantras are missing from Kauthama Shakha. An analysis of both these versions reveals lots of Paath-Bhed (variant readings). Besides this, there is a difference in number of songs attributed to different branches. Shri Satvalekar in his preface to Samaveda Samhita has given the following table of songs (Samagana).</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong> </strong></td>
<td><strong>Songs of Jaiminiya Branch</strong></td>
<td><strong>Songs of Kauthamiya Branch</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Gramgeyo-gān:</td>
<td>1233</td>
<td>1197</td>

<p>We can easily see that the Samaganas of Jaiminiya Version are 1000 more than those of Kauthamiya Version.</p>
<p>Agniveer wrote,</p>
<p>We have already mentioned that Kauthum Rishi preserved the original Samaveda. Refer the previous discussion on branches.</p>
<p>Further, Samaveda songs make no sense for the disturbed mind. They represent the melodies that generate from within when one reaches a high level of enlightenment and exalted state. Jaimini branch offers more variety and you can experiment with them to find what melody touches you the most. However keep caution – avoid spicy food, meat, alcohol, anger, frustration, hatred etc, study other Vedas as well and practice meditation. Without foundation of this, you may be simply wasting your time.</p>
<p>When will Agniveer stop lying? What is the proof that only Kauthama Samhita is original? Whether Samaveda songs make sense or not is no response to the argument of textual corruption. Samaveda is a mere waste of ink and paper. All except 75 mantras are copied from Rigveda&#8217;s Shaakal samhita. The remaining are from Baashkal. Now, if Baashkal is not the original Samhita, then the 75 mantras of Samaveda are also fake.</p>
<p><strong>Corruption in Atharvaveda</strong></p>
<p>Atharvaveda, also known as Brahmaveda is considered the youngest amongst all other Vedas.</p>
<p>Following is an exmaple of textual corruption in the Atharvaveda.</p>
<p>Atharvaveda Khand 20 and Sookt 127 is part of the Kuntap Sooktas. In the third mantra of this Sookt there has been  an alteration. The Atharvaveda of Arya Samaj and Gayatri Parivar both have it as follows:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="365" height="67" class="wp-image-7545" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-42.png" alt="http://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/060218_0654_testingresp10.png" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-42.png 365w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-42-300x55.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 365px) 100vw, 365px" /></p>
<p>The word preceeding <strong>Maamahe</strong> is <strong>Eeshaai</strong>. However, in the Atharvaveda of Pandit Raja Ram Shashtri of Arya Samaj as well as the Atharvaveda printed in Germany, the text differs as follows:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="317" height="56" class="wp-image-7546" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-43.png" alt="http://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/060218_0654_testingresp11.png" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-43.png 317w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-43-300x53.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 317px) 100vw, 317px" /></p>
<p>Here the word preceeding <strong>Maamahe </strong>is <strong>Rishye </strong>and not <strong>Eeshaai</strong>. This makes a difference in the meaning of the mantra.</p>
<p>Agniveer wrote,</p>
<p>Again a case of printing mistake due to bad handwriting in Devanagri manuscript or error by typist. The correct word is &#8216;Ishaya&#8217;. Printing mistakes are not attributable to original texts.</p>
<p>This is not a printing error. Prof. Whitney mentions the variation in the footnote of this word. This is a manuscript variation. That is why all European scholars such as Griffith, Whitney, Bloomfield translate it as Seer or Rishi. Agniveer would do well to learn the Vedas properly instead of blaming all  manuscript mistakes on the poor printers.</p>
<p>Points left unanswered by Agniveer</p>
<p>Patanjali Rishi, in his Mahabhasya, has given the first words of all the four Vedas. Patanjali quotes SHANNODEVEE RABHISHTAYE as the first verse of the Atharvaveda. However, Atharvaveda now begins with the verse YE NNISHATPAAH PARIYANTA. SHANNODEVEE RABHISHTAYE now appears as the first verse of the 6th Sukta of the first Kanda or in aggregate the 26th verse. This shows that  25 mantras have been interpolated in the beginning of Atharvaveda.</p>
<p>It is mentioned in Shatapath Brahman 13:4:3:4-8 in the context of the Ashvamedha sacrifice; after the Yagya (ritual) is completed, the householders should be instructed in Rigveda of the first day. old men should be instructed in Yajurveda on the second day, handsome youths should be instructed in Atharvaveda on the third day and handsome maiden should be instructed in Angirasveda on the  fourth day. Angirasveda is attributed to Rishi Angiras who is in the fourth generation after Rishi Atharva. There is no mention of Samaveda in this reference of Shatapath Brahman.</p>
<p>Agniveer wrote,</p>
<p>I shall not comment on what exactly this reference from Shatpath means. But even if we take it at face value:</p>
<p>1. Samaveda is not mentioned because Samaveda cannot be simply listened like other Vedas. Samaveda is all about emotions and meditation. <strong>Further, bulk of mantras in Samaveda are already in Rigveda. So there is no purpose of listening them again. </strong>However if the same mantras are meditated upon with emotions and sung, new revelations would come. But this is not in context of the ritual described. You need to separately practice this art.</p>
<p>Yes, how can you comment because your knowledge of Vedas has taken a big beating by now.</p>
<p>Agniveer is right that bulk of the mantras in Samaveda are already in Rigveda. Agniveer himself confessed that Samaveda is useless and mere waste of paper, ink and time, because it is mere repetition of Rigveda.</p>
<p>Agniveer wrote,</p>
<p>2. Even if Rishi Angiras was born 4th generation from Rishi Atharva (I shall not comment on authenticity of this history), how does it matter? Names of Rishis depict their deeds and specializations and not the names in their Class X pass certificate. So a specialist in Atharvaveda can name himself Rishi Atharva. Similarly another Rishi can use synonym of Atharva ie Angiras and use as his name. This is similar to we using Agniveer as our name. Now just because we call ourselves Agniveer, it does not mean that we are the author of all the mantras in Vedas that have word &#8216;Agni&#8217;.</p>
<p>Agniveer cannot comment on the authenticity of this history because he doesn&#8217;t know any history. There are no preserved records of the imaginary authors of the Vedas. The point to be noted is that it is technically absurd to call the same Veda by different names in the same sentence, just because the gender is different. Rest of the claims of Agniveer are without any evidence.</p>
<p>Agniveer wrote,</p>
<p>4. Atharvaveda and Angirasveda refer to same text. They are also called Chhanda in some places. Atharvaveda has the privilege of multiple names because it is an all-rounder. It adopts from Rik, Yajuh and Sama Vedas are brings forth their applied aspects. To there are multiple dimensions to it deserving multiple names.</p>
<p>The correct view is that Atharvaveda is divided into two parts, Atharvaved and Angirasved. Atharvaved as a whole is a later addition to the canon of Vedas, interpolated by Brahmins. Even within Atharvaved, Angirasved portion is a late addition. Agniveer has produced no evidence for the multiple names of Atharvaved.</p>
<p>Agniveer wrote,</p>
<p>But if this be the argument for Vedas being corrupted then Quran is perhaps the most corrupted text in the world. Because Quran is referred by a huge number of names in Quran itself. The word Quran was later adopted for the text by fighting followers long after death of the peace-loving founder. The founder never knew that this book would be called Quran. Quran is also referred by names reserved for Jewish and Christian texts in Quran itself! That is why some scholars conclude that original Quran refers to Bible or Old Testament or some unchangeable text which was existing ever prior to Testaments and was much bigger in size. This a matter of scholarly debate and we shall leave it to scholars.</p>
<p>Exactly, the Quran has many names WITHIN the text itself. There was no fighting between the companions over the names. Agniveer is just throwing red herrings to distract the attention of the readers from the main topic. Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) always referred to it as Al-Quran (The Quran). Agniveer neither has knowledge of Vedic Dharma nor of Islam. His credibility is already destroyed. Commenting on the comments of the ignorant does not fetch anything. The topic is about Vedas so bringing the Quran into the picture is evidence that Agniveer has really no factual response to the clear textual corruption of Vedas. Our research has been substantial, reasonable and rational.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Agniveer has problems with my usage of the word &#8216;accusation&#8217;. I already know, after thorough study, that Vedas are false and corrupt. Hence I am justified in using the word &#8216;accusation&#8217;. &#8216;To accuse&#8217; according to dictionary means &#8216;to charge with a shortcoming or error.&#8217; Check <a href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/accuse" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">this link<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> to know more.</p>
<p>All Maharishi Agniveer can do is go into hairsplitting a simple word and build more castles of lies and deception. You can think why Agniveer is so upset here. Obviously because the foundations of Vedic Dharma are being shaken here.</p>
<p>Agniveer writes more lies,</p>
<p>4. To take this argument to an extreme, let us state something. Even if all the allegations…sorry &#8216;<strong>accusations</strong>&#8216; stand, still that would NO WAY AFFECT the Vedic religion. This is because the very essence of Vedic religion is to <strong>not</strong> blindly and literally translate any text as recipe for life.</p>
<p>To know about the truth of Vedic Religion, go through our disection of Vedas on our website. You  will know the reality with references and exact quotes.</p>
<p>Agniveer wrote,</p>
<p>Vedic texts are like Science textbooks for us and not a roadside Mantra-Tantra book that promises to help us getting job, marriage, money, destruction of enemy, mesmerism over lover, invisibility, control of Jinna and ghosts etc by blankly reciting certain mantras on microphone and moving some bones.</p>
<p>Sorry, if you think Vedas are akin to Jhaad Phoonk of Pagla Baba Banarasi, or Ajmer Sharif ka Jaadu, or Shahdara Wale Miyanji ke Totke or something similar, you are at a wrong place. Get these addresses from any Railway Station rather than daring to open the minds to think honestly. Or perhaps your own scripture might be a good replacement for these Babas and Miyans.</p>
<p>All you have to do is read the Vedas yourself and see the kind of primitive, superstitous book it is. Let me give you a sample of Mantra-Tantra and Jhaad Phoonk.</p>
<p>6. The mother shall sleep, the father shall sleep, the dog shall sleep, the lord of the house shall sleep! All her relations shall sleep, and these people round about shall sleep!<br />
7. O sleep, put thou to sleep all people with the magic that induces sleep! Put the others to sleep until the sun rises; may I be awake until the dawn appears, like Indra, unharmed, uninjured!</p>
<p>(Atharvaved 4:5:6-7)</p>
<p>These mantras in Atharvaveda are taught to the Robber. It is claimed that by chanting these mantras, all the family members of the house, which the robber intends to rob, will sleep so that the robber can  easily rob the house. Now, it is for you to decide what kind of knowledge is this? Obviuosly knowledge of fraud or in short fraud-veda.</p>

<p>P.S. Since this is a response article, we had to restrict it to the arguments presented. However, to prove the textual corruption of Vedas, one more article will be added soon with many more proofs and evidences. Stay tuned and thanks for reading! Beware of Fraud Maharishis.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">Written by Ibn Muhammad<br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">What, in the first place, has Hinduism to say about God and His attributes, and what kind of worship does it teach mankind?<br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">At the very threshold, we are met with the formidable difficulty that Hinduism is not one religion but many religions jumbled together under a single name. It is a hodge-podge or conglomeration of many mutually conflicting religions, and is not the child, so to say, of any one father. Those who practice it differ very much from one another in their faith and practice. Hinduism includes in it Vedism, Brahmanism, Sivaism, Vishnuism, Polytheism, Pantheism, Idolatory in is greatest forms, Tree-Worship, Serpent-Worship, Demon-Worship and so on.<br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-5644"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">It is not easy therefore to give a definition of Hinduism,  &#8220;Hinduism and its gods,&#8221; says Sir Alfred Lyall, &#8220;are a troubled sea, without shore or visible horizon, driven to and fro by the winds of boundless credulity and grotesque invention. A tangled jungle of disorderly superstitions, ghosts and demons, demi-gods and deified saints, household gods, tribe gods, local gods, universal gods, with their countless shrines and temples, and din of their disordent rites, deities who abhor a fly&#8217;s death, those who delight still in human victims, and those who would not either sacrifice or make offerings, such religious chaos&#8221;. <strong><sup>[1]</sup></strong><br />
</span></p>
<h3>The Authoritative Books not one but many</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">A further difficulty regarding Hinduism lies in the fact that all its professors have no common sacred Book or Books to depend upon for their doctrines. Some refer to Vedas as the basis of their faith. Others rest their faith on the Shrutis, a term which includes not only the four Vedas but their Brahmanas and Upanishads as well. The Mahabharata styles itself as the fifth Veda, containing the quintessense of all the rest. Other Hindus agains follow the teachings of the Puranas. The present day educated Hindus are mainly depending upon the Bhagavad Gita, a philosophical treatise, for their guidance in matters of faith. We shall therefore briefly inquire into the contents of all these books to see what they teach about God and the way in which man should worship Him.<br />
</span></p>
<h3>The Religion of the Vedas</h3>
<h4>(a) Nature Worship</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">Vedism, or the Religion of the Vedas, teaches the worship of the deified forces or phenomenon of Nature, such as Fire, the Sun, Wnd and Rain. Here is the opening verse of the Rigveda, the oldest Veda, of which the others are mere repetitions and borrowing:<br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>अग्निमीळे पुरोहितं यज्ञस्य देवं रत्वीजम |  होतारं रत्नधातमम || </strong><br />
</span></span></p>
<blockquote class="quote-light">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">&#8220;I Laud Agni, the great high priest, god, minister of sacrifice, the herald, lavishest of wealth.&#8221; [Rigveda Mandal 1: Sookt 1: Mantra 1]
</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">The whole of the Veda goes on in this strain throughout in the hymns collected for different purposes. The contrast between the opening  verse of the Rigveda which teaches Polytheism, and that of the Jewish Bible and of the Holy Qur&#8217;an which teach Monotheism, cannot fail to be noted even by the most superficial reader. Thus the Jewish Pentateuch begins,<br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>בראשית ברא אלהים את השמים ואת הארץ׃</strong><br />
</span></p>
<blockquote class="quote-light">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">&#8220;In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.&#8221; [Genesis 1:1]
</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">The Holy Qur&#8217;an strikes the key note of its whole teaching in a still more profound manner, unparalleled in other religions:<br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong><span style="font-family: Traditional Arabic;">بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> &#8211; </span><span style="font-family: Traditional Arabic;">الْحَمْدُ للَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ &#8211; الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ &#8211; مَـلِكِ يَوْمِ الدِّينِ</span></strong></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<blockquote class="quote-light">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">&#8220;In the name of Allah, the Most Compassionate, the Most Merciful. All Praise is due to Allah, Lord of the Worlds, the Most Compassionate, the Most Merciful. Master of the Day of Judgement.&#8221;[Surah Al-Fatiha 1:1-4]
</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">Thus Vedism teaches the worship of the powers of Nature.<br />
</span></p>
<h4>(b) Polytheism</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">That it teaches polytheism is also evident from the expression used in the same verse and in all the succeeding verses as well:<br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>अग्निः पूर्वेभिर्र्षिभिरीड्यो नूतनैरुत | स देवानेह वक्षति || </strong><br />
</span></span></p>
<blockquote class="quote-light">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">&#8220;He (Agni) shall bring hitherward the gods.&#8221; [Rigveda 1:1:2]
</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>अग्ने यं यज्ञमध्वरं विश्वतः परिभूरसि | स इद्देवेषु गछति ||</strong><br />
</span></span></p>
<blockquote class="quote-light">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">&#8220;Verily goes to the gods.&#8221;[verse 4]
</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>अग्निर्होता कविक्रतुः सत्यश्चित्रश्रवस्तमः | देवो देवेभिरा गमत || </strong><br />
</span></span></p>
<blockquote class="quote-light">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">&#8220;May Agni, priest, the god, come hither with the gods.&#8221; [verse 5]
</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">The number of gods in Hindu Pantheon is given as 33 in one place (Rigveda 1:34:11), which says,<br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><strong><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><br />
</span></strong></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>आ नासत्या तरिभिर एकादशैर इह देवेभिर यातम मधुपेयम अश्विना | परायुस तारिष्टं नी रपांसि मर्क्षतं सेधतं दवेषो भवतं सचाभुवा ||</strong><br />
</span></span></p>
<blockquote class="quote-light">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">&#8220;Come, O Nasatyas, with the thrice-eleven Gods; come, O ye Asvins, to the drinking of the meath. Make long our days of life, and wipe out all our sins: ward off our enemies; be with us evermore.&#8221;<br />
</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">Similarly it is mentioned in Rigveda 8:30:2,<br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>इति सतुतासो असथा रिशादसो ये सथ तरयश्च तरिंशच्च | मनोर्देवा यज्ञियासः || </strong><br />
</span></span></p>
<blockquote class="quote-light">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">&#8220;Thus be ye lauded, ye destroyers of the foe, ye Three-and-Thirty Deities, The Gods of man, the Holy Ones.&#8221;<br />
</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">In Rigeveda 10:52:6 the number is 3,339. It says,<br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>तरीणि शता तरी सहस्राण्यग्निं तरिंशच्च देवा नवचासपर्यन | औक्षन घर्तैरस्त्र्णन बर्हिरस्मा आदिद्धोतारं नयसादयन्त || </strong><br />
</span></span></p>
<blockquote class="quote-light">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">&#8220;The Deities three thousand, three hundred and thirty-nine, have served and honoured Agni, Strewn sacred grass, anointed him with butter, and seated him as Priest, the Gods&#8217; Invoker.&#8221;<br />
</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">Later Hinduism has gone still further by saying that there are no less than 33 crores of them.<br />
</span></p>
<h4>(c) Pantheism</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">Why not then say that everything is God, and God is everything? The Purusha Sukta (Rigveda 10:90) which every orthodox Brahmin is expected even now to recite daily in his prayers shows that Pantheism is also taught in the later portions of the Vedas:<br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>पुरुष एवेदं सर्वं यद भूतं यच्च भव्यम | उताम्र्तत्वस्येशानो यदन्नेनातिरोहति || </strong><br />

</span></p>

<h3>Religion of the Upanishads</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">The Upanishads reject the Karma, Kanda or Salvation by means of sacrifices and other rituals taught in the four Vedas and Brahmanas, and advocate the Gnana-Kanda or the theory of Salvation by knowledge. Hence they consist of speculations about the individual souls (atma) and the Supreme soul (Param-atma), and about the relationship subsisting between them, their aim being to get rid of man&#8217;s earthly existence by absorption of the individual soul into the World Soul through correct or true knowledge. They teach that the Universe or Nature (Prakriti) is unreal or <em>Maaya</em>, that is to say, it does not really exist but it only an illusion of the mind. What really exists in the Supreme Soul or Brahman, and the individual souls are all emanations from Him and identical with Him. Only they do not know it, as Brahman has invested Himself/Itself with the <em>Maaya</em>, and they also are under the influence of the same mystic power. The individual souls can be disillusioned only by means of Correct knowledge, and as soon as this consummation is reached, they know themselves to be Brahman, and get absorbed into Him. The famous formula referring to this theory is <strong><em>&#8216;Tat tvam asi&#8217;</em></strong> </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">तत् त्वम् असि </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">meaning &#8216;That art thou&#8217;, whoever knows this &#8216;becomes the All&#8217;. Even the gods are not able to prevent him from becoming it. For he becomes their self. <em>[Brihadaranyak Upanishad 1:4:6]</em><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">This theory is known as the Vedanta, the essence of the teaching of the Vedas, and has taken an immense hold on the minds of the people and lent a deeper colour to all subsequent literature. A Christian missionary asked a Brahmin, &#8220;Who and where is Brahman?&#8221; &#8220;He is talking to you,&#8221; was the prompt reply.<br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">A Vedantist once began to dilate upon the truth of his belief in the presence of a king and vehemently maintained that the whole world was <em>Mithya</em> or unreal, imaginary: whereupon an elephant was ordered to be brought quite near to him and the man fled in terror. &#8220;Why do you run away for your life? The elephant is <em>Mithya</em>&#8221; said the king. But the Vedantist proved himself equal to the occasion and without a moment&#8217;s hesistation replied that the running away too was <em>Mithya</em>.<br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">Such is the fool&#8217;s paradise in which most of the misguided Hindus live. The expression that is often heard on their lips, and which has unfortunately recently been made famous by Dr. Zakir Naik through his televised public talks:<br />
</span></p>
<blockquote class="quote-light">
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><em>EKAM EVA ADVITIYAM</em><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">meaning &#8216;One only without a second&#8217;<br />
</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">It does not mean that they believe in the &#8216;Only One True God&#8217; but it is the Vedantic or Pantheistic formula which asserts that the only real existence of the World Soul and the identity of the individual souls within it, totally denying the existence of the phenomenal world.<br />
</span></p>
<h3>Religion of the Puranas</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">The characteristic of popular Hinduism of today is the belief in Divine incarnations, idolatory and caste. Popular Hinduism believes in the doctrine of Trimurti or Hindu Trinity as Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva, in their characteristic of the Creator, Preserver and Destroyer of the Universe.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">Vishnu Worship</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">The distinct feature of Vishnu worship is the incarnation of God. When wickedness in the world increases Vishnu is said to take upon himself the form of an animal or man in order to be able to protect the good and to punish the bad. The principle incarnations He is said to have so far assumed are those of (1) a fish, (2) a tortoise, (3) a Boar, (4) a man-lion (5) a Dwarf, (6) a Brahmin hero called Parasu Ram, (7) a Kshatriya Prince, the hero of Ramayana, (8) a shepherd Prince Krishna and (9) a Kshatriya heretic, Buddha.<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">Krishna declares:<br />
</span></h4>
<blockquote class="quote-light">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">&#8220;On an occasion of marriage, or of enjoying a woman, or when life is in danger, or when one&#8217;s entire property is about to be taken away, or for the sake of a Brahmin, falsehood may be uttered. These five kinds of falsehood have been declared to be sinless. On these occasions falsehood would become truth and truth would become falsehood.&#8221; [Mahabharata Book 8; Karna Parva; Section 69]
</span></p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">Cow Worship</span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">It is natural for Indians to set a high value upon the cow on account of its utility, but the worship the Hindus pay to it is irrational and absurd to a degree. It is considered to be the most sacred of all animals. Every part of its body is considered to be inhabited by some deity or other. Even its excreta are considered to be most sacred. Its urine is looked upon as the best of all holy waters; a sin destroying liquid which sanctifies everything it touches, while nothing purifies like cow-dung. The ashes of its dung sprinkled over a sinner are able to convert him into a saint.<br />
</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Veneration of Cow in Hindu Culture</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">Present day Hindu culture is pivoted solely on the cow. Its material and spiritual concepts are both engulfed in cow worship. Such an animal worship is known as zoolatry. This is a vestide of animistic cultures among whom the worship of monkeys, sheep, elephants, cows and even snakes was prevalent. Animal worship culminated in the taking of human beings for gods so that the silhouettes were stamped on the coins and painted on the flags, and upon their honour depended the glory and honour of their realms.<br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">Among cultivators cow worship is not a strange thing. In many countries, notably, India, Iran and Egypt, it was prevalent. Among Hindus veneration of the cow is referred to in the Vedas as Puranas and in Hindu Jurisprudence and folklore. In the Vedas several verses refer to saluting and prostrating before the cow as the following sections illustrate:<br />
</span></p>
<blockquote class="quote-light">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">&#8220;Prajapati and Parameshthin are the two horns, Indra is the head, Agni the forehead, Yama the joint of the neck. King Soma is the brain, Sky is the upper jaw, Earth is the lower jaw&#8230; All worlds and all the gods are as the cow from head to foot.&#8221; [Atharvaved Kaand 9: Sookt 7]
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">&#8220;You are being created and have been created for salutations and prostrations. Salutations and prostration to you, O image of God, to your hair, to your hooves.&#8221; [Atharva 10:10]
</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">Curiously enough, the Vedic Rishis likened the chanting of their mantras (hymn) to the lowing of the cows:<br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>अभि विप्रा अनूषत गावो वत्सं न मातरः | इन्द्रं सोमस्य पीतये || </strong><br />
</span></span></p>
<blockquote class="quote-light">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">&#8220;As the cows moo in the presence of their calves so do Brahmins recite their mantras while drinking the soma juice in the presence of Indra devta.&#8221; [Rigveda 9:12:2]
</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">In old Vedic timesthe pious people picked out the grain from the cow-dung, and then ate it. They also squeezed out its water and drank it (Mahabharata). Its urine was considered a source of redemption of sins and a means of cow-dung bathed with water extracted thus. Krishna Ji revered the bull by stroking its back before mounting it. In short, in Hindu religion the cow in venerated to an extent which gods and godesses and even God Himself does not merit.<br />
</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Cow-Worship and the humiliation of Man</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">It is to be noted that the sacredness of the cow as compared with the scant regard for human life has come to this that Swami Dayanand Saraswati in accordance with the Vedas, opines that the blood of thousands or hundreds of thousands of humans, may be shed to please these animals; (See his translation of Yajurveda 33:14 and Rigveda 1:121:10)<br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">In Vedic times, there lived an untouchable people in a village named Kikat, in todays Bihar. The used to rear cattle. Obviously to the Aryans this was a crime. So they invoked their god Indra to wage war against them and loot their cows.<br />
</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"></span></p>
<p id="VJgEpTj"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="620" height="145" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7245 " src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/img_5f2417b2d28b9.png" alt="" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/img_5f2417b2d28b9.png 620w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/07/img_5f2417b2d28b9-300x70.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"> </span></p>
<blockquote class="quote-light">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">&#8220;O Indra, what do the cows make for you among the Kikatas. They neither yield milk for your offerings, nor do they warm the vessel of libation. Bring to us these cows, bring to us also the wealth of Pramagand (their King). O Brave one, grant us the possessions of the people of low status.&#8221; [Rigveda 3:53:14]
</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">On the basis of this clear prnouncement, non-Aryans and untouchables have no right to keep cows. Aryans and Brahmins whenever they wish can kill them and appropriate their possessions. Hindu culture thus becomes the culture of the progress, civilization and welfare of the Aryan people alone.<br />
</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Status of the Cow</h3>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">The fact remains that Hindu culture is based on the cow. Actually it is cow-worship as may be inferred from the discussion so far. As the Noble Qur&#8217;an states,<br />
</span></p>
<blockquote class="quote-light">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">&#8220;And their hearts absorbed (the worship of) the calf because of their disbelief.&#8221; [Surah Baqarah 2:93]
</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">The cow is also called mother and this is a relic of the age of ignorance. In primitive times when the mother of a young child died, the child too would die of malnutrition after two or three days. The father did not know how to save the child&#8217;s life as a substitute for the mother&#8217;s milk was not known. By chance, some wise person thought of the idea of giving goat&#8217;s milk to the child. As the goat was easier to control and milk than the cow, goat&#8217;s milk was used to save the infant&#8217;s life. Later on the cow was tamed for this purpose. From then on the polytheists began to call the cow &#8216;mata&#8217; i.e. mother. But other animals as well, such as goats, sheep, camels, supply milk as substitute for mother&#8217;s milk; yet they are never called &#8216;mother&#8217;. Strangely enough, in this age of science when so many baby-foods have been invented, none of these is called &#8216;mother&#8217;, yet wealthy and educated Hindus still apply this epithet to the cow alone.<br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">The nation which cannot differentiate between a cow&#8217;s tail and a man&#8217;s head, lives in an extreme abyss of culture. The cow is at the utmost an animal, while even the most degraded man, being still a human being, is yet far superior to a cow.<br />
</span></p>
<h3>Religion of the Gita</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">Since Mahabharata fails to serve as a handy and useful book of the essence of Hinduism, the present day educated Hindus are adopting the Bhagvat Gita as their guide.<br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">Like all the other scriptures this famous poem too fails to teach True Religion to mankind. It is a highly Philosophic poem just as ill-suited to teach Religion as Berkley&#8217;s <em>Principle of Human Knowledge </em>or Milton&#8217;s <em>Paradise Lost</em> can be. The principle of its composition is Eclecticism and tries to combine Sankhya, Yoga, and Vedanta teaching into one whole to support the Vaishnava theory of Krishna&#8217;s deification.But is does promote ideas like Polytheism and Caste. Krishna claims to be the author of the caste system in India:<br />
</span></p>
<blockquote class="quote-light">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">&#8220;The four Castes were created by me according to the appointment of qualities and works.&#8221; [Gita 4:13]
</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">The Gita does not insist on the worship of the One and Only True God but promotes belief in polytheism:<br />
</span></p>
<blockquote class="quote-light">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">&#8220;Those who worship gods go to the gods&#8221; [9:25]
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">&#8220;Worship the gods thereby; The gods shall yield thee grace.&#8221; [3:3]
</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">That there are inconsistencies in the Bhagvad Gita is admitted today even by Hindu scholars. For example at Chapter 9, stanza 29 Krishna declares that &#8216;none is hateful to me, none dear.&#8217; And yet the remarkable verses at the close of Chapter 12 contradict it, &#8216;Linked by no ties to earth, steadfast in Me, That man I love&#8217;. At Gita Chapter 5, stanza 15 it is said, that &#8216;the Lord receives the sin and merit of none.&#8217; Yet at Chapter 5, stanza 29, and again at Chapter 9, stanza 24, Krishna calls himself &#8216;the Lord and enjoyer&#8217; of all sacrifices and penances. How, it may well be asked, can the Supreme Being &#8216;enjoy&#8217; that which he does not even &#8216;receive&#8217;?<br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">The doctrine of transmigration is the basis from which the argument of Bhagvad Gita takes its start. Matter and spirit are without beginning (13:20). God (Krishna-Vishnu) is eternal, almighty, unborn, without beginning, the great Lord of the World (10:3). He is different not only from the fleeting world, but also from the changeless and indestructible energy of all beings. Vishnu is born from age to age (4:6-8). Krishna-Vishnu is wholly distinct from Brahma and Brahman is distinctly a lower deity than Krishna (11:15,37). In 12:1-7, the two classes, those who believe in a personal God Krishna-Vishnu, i.e. theists, and those who believe in Brahma ,i.e. pantheists are contrasted, and preference is given to former. In other words, final bliss is difficult of attainment for those who follow the Vedas and seek the heaven of Brahma. All external observances and duties prescribed by the Vedas are held to be mischievous and thrown overboard (7:20; 18:34,66). The Vedas and the works enjoined by them cannot win one the vision of the Divine (11:48,53). What a contempt is expressed for the Vedas in the following words: &#8220;Steady understanding does not belong to those, whose minds are drawn by that flowery talk (i.e. Vedas) which is full of ordinances of specific acts for the attainment of pleasures and power, and which promises birth as the fruit of acts- that flowery talk which those unwise ones utter, who are enamoure of Vedic words, who say there is nothing else, who are full of desires, an whose goal is heaven. The Vedas merely relate to the effects of the three qualities; do you, O Arjuna! rise above those effects of the three qualities.&#8221; (2:42-45). Thus the Vedas are being spoken of in very disparaging terms and the followers of Krishna were inimical to the Vedas.<br />
