										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>SCIENTIFIC ERRORS IN HINDUISM</strong></p>
<p>Written by Sulaiman Razvi</p>
<p>The Hindus claim that they were so scientifically advanced that everything was made by them. Later on the knowledge was either destroyed by Muhgals or the white people copied their ideas. As soon as something is discovered they claim that it was already mentioned in Hindu scriptures. Ironically such advanced people’s research is now limited in finding medicinal values of Cow Urine and Dung. They invented everything except for pen to note down their inventions. I will be mentioning some verses from my article <a href="http://vedkabhed.com/index.php/2014/05/14/scientific-errors-in-vedas-part-i/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Scientific Errors In Vedas<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> but without the Hindi translation as it makes the article very lengthy. This article deals with various scientific errors in Hindu scriptures including the Vedas. And I have written this according to my capability, if a scholar writes about scientific errors in Hinduism then he may find even more errors than I did. It is ridiculous to claim that Hinduism is a scientific religion, this article proves that the Rishis wrote down science of their period which is irrelevant to modern science. Some verses even start with “Scientists says” which suggests that science in Puranas was plagiarized from scientists of that time.</p>
<p>Scientific knowledge in Hindu scriptures is highly objectionable, Atharved 2.32.3 has chant to destroy pests, Atharva Veda 5.23.5 has chant to destroy worms, this is the scientific knowledge imparted by the Vedas. It is mentioned in Vishnu Purana book 5, chapter 11 that Indra was offended by the loss of his offerings, so he caused heavy rain to deluge Gokul, then Krishna held the mountain Govardhana to shelter the cowherds and their cattle. Although this can be dismissed as a miracle but the following scientific errors can’t be dismissed with the said excuse.</p>

<h1>Mountains had Wings</h1>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-6596" title="Vedic Science" src="http://vedkabhed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/word-image-2-300x220.jpeg" alt="Vedic Science" width="568" height="417" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/word-image-2-300x220.jpeg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/07/word-image-2-1024x751.jpeg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/07/word-image-2-768x563.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 568px) 100vw, 568px" /></p>
<p>Hinduism says that mountains had wings and used to fly and then Indra cut off their wings, the reason why Indra did this varies according to different Puranas, some say that their wings were becoming too large so Indra cut them off and then they became clouds, some says that Gods feared flying mountains would fall to the ground and kill</p>
<p>people so for this reason Indra cut off their wings. Mainak mountain was saved as he took shelter in Vayu Devta.</p>
<p>Valmiki Ramayana 5.1.123-5 “O son! Earlier in the Krita yuga, mountains had wings. With speed equal to that of Garuda and Vayu, they went in all directions. After that when those mountains were thus flying freely, Devas and living creatures together with sages obtained fear in the doubt that those mountains might fall down. Then the angry Devendra who performed a hundred Asvamedha rituals, cut off the wings of thousands of mountains by his weapon vajra then and there.” Tr. K.M.K Murthy</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 8.11.34 “Indra thought: Formerly, when many mountains flying in the sky with wings would fall to the ground and kill people, I cut their wings with this same thunderbolt.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 125.10-17 “…The clouds Puskarabartaka have been born from the wings (of the mountains). These wings are named Puskara and hold a huge volume of water hence these clouds are known as Puskaravarta. The valiant Indra cut down the wings of the mountains that used to fly at their will and cause ruin and destruction to the rising generation (of the universe)…” Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, Edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>Linga Purana I.54.46-48 “…The origin of the third type of clouds is from the wings of mountains chopped off by Indra.” Tr. Board of Scholars, Edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana I.2.22.41 “The wings of very powerful mountains that had increased in size and who used to go wherever as they pleased, were chopped off by Indra who wished to secure the welfare of all living beings.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Harivamsa Purana 3.40.19 “Knowing that the mountains are responsible for lack of firmness (immobility) of earth, the destroyer of strongholds (Indra), the lord, after installing the mountains at their own places, cut off their wings with his weapon, the hundred jointed (edged shataparva) Vajra.”</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.51.38 “The wings of the powerful mountains who could go as per their will and pleasure, had grown very large. Indra cut them off for the (welfare of all) living beings.” Tr. G.V. Tagare, Edited by G.P Bhatt</p>
<p>H.H. Wilson writes in the footnoes of the verse Rig Veda 2.12.2,<br />
“Yah parvatan prakupitan aramnat; the Scholiast says he quieted the mountains, going hither and thither, as long as they had wings: Indra cut them off.”</p>
<p>Swami Prabhupada also wrote,<br />
“In many descriptions in Vedic literature it is found that mountains also fly in the sky with wings. When such mountains are dead, they fall to the ground, where they stay as very large dead bodies.” <strong>Swami Prabhupada on Srimad Bhagavatam 8.11.12 </strong><br />

<p>According to Hinduism a woman conceives child after the semen mixes with her menstrual blood,</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 39.10 ”The menstrual flow of a woman suddenly develops conception as soon as it mingles itself with the semen virile of man, through the sap of the flowers of herbs.” Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, Edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>Varaha Purana 125.14 ”The generative fluid is in the female and the semen is in the male. In the womb they combine to form a being. This is due to my Maya.” Tr. Vekitasubramonia Iyer, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Following are the embryological developments mentioned in Hindu scriptures,</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana 2.3.72.42-47 “…Blood takes its origin from Rasa (a vital fluid constituent of the body) and it is said that the flesh originates from blood. The source of fat is from the flesh. It is defined that the bone originates from the fat. From the bone the pith and marrow take their origin and the origin of Semen is from the marrow. (?) Foetus originated from semen virile through its assimilative rasa bodily fluid. It is there that water is mixed initially (?). This is called the Saumya Rasi. The foetus that is solidified [lit. born of Asman, stone solid] is called the second Rasi. One should know that semen is of the nature of Soma and Menstrual blood is of the nature of fire. These two Evolutes follow Rasa…” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.14.17-22 “Then, at the time of conception, Kalana, the embryo at its first stage (in the form of a drop) is formed. In due course the Kalana develops into bubbles. Just as a lump of clay pressed by the wind in the potter’s wheel and shaped by the hands (of the potter) attains multifarious shapes, so also the foetus united with bones and impelled by the wind becomes a human body with proper forms, features and mind. The wind assembles them together. From the wind water is generated. From the water the vital breath is formed and through the vital breath the semen gets developed. Thirty three parts of blood (female contribution) and fourteen parts of the semen mixing together form only half a Pala (two karsas) and is deposited in the womb. The child in the womb is covered by the five vital breaths. From the father’s body he inherits his forms and features.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 39.14-16 “At the time of menstruation, the air draws the semen virile up, from the inside, after which it magnifies itself there; and then it develops into the embryo and assumes human or animal form (according to the kind of the womb where such development occurs)…” Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, Edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>The following excerpts from Brahma Vaivarta Purana and Skanda Purana provide details about Puranic Embryology,</p>
<p>Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Prakriti Khanda 35.121-141 “…As soon as the semen is cast into the womb it is mixed up with blood. If there is excess of blood, the issue takes the form of his mother, and if there is excess of semen, the issue takes his father’s form. The combination of the semen with the blood on even days, i.e. Sunday, Tuesday and Thursday, results in a male issue, otherwise, in a female issue…Semen and blood get united in one night. This union, followed by development from day to day. On the seventh day, the fetus takes the form of a jujube and it takes the form of a pillow in a month, the shape of a lump of flesh without hands and feet in three months and is vested with hands, legs and other members of the body in the fifth month. In the sixth month the body gets animation and consciousness, the animate body then knows the past, but like a bird in a cage, it suffers endless torments. The child in the womb occupies the most unholy place for residence, partakes of the remains of the food eaten by its mother and contemplates Hari in endless tortures. After four months of trouble the child impelled by the wind of the womb is born. But by the illusion of Hari, it forgets the past and oblivious of the quarters, time, space and the necessities…” Tr. Rajendra Nath Sen</p>
<p>Skanda Purana V.iii.159.33-53 “…when semen and blood become mixed due to the intercourse of a man and a woman, a creature is born undoubtedly…In the first month it is a phlegmatic mass with the full complement of the body ingredients. In the second month it is a lump of flesh; in the third it gets equipped with sense organs. From the element of ether it derives lightness, subtlety, sound, power of hearing, strength etc. From air the Atman obtains sense of touch, movement, digestive power and roughness. From fiery element the sense of vision, warmth, digestive capacity, colour, and illumination are obtained. It takes from watery elements chillness, fluidity, dampness and softness. From earth element it takes odour, sense of smell, weight and physical form. These are unborn Atman takes up in the third month and beings to throb. If the longing of a pregnant woman is not fulfilled, the foetus becomes defective. It may get ugliness or even death. Hence the woman should be kept pleased. In the fourth month the limbs get firmness. Blood begins to flow in the fifth month. Physical strength is obtained in the sixth month. Complexion is fixed and the nails and hairs grow at that time. In the seventh month, the foetus becomes endowed with consciousness and mind and the body has all the nails and hundreds of hairs. In the eighth month, the outer skin is fixed and the foetus becomes endowed with the power of memory. It is at this time that his sin pursues the foetus and the mother as well. Hence if the birth is premature and the child is born in the eighth month it dies invariably. Either in the ninth or the tenth month the child comes out naturally forced by the powerful winds at the time of delivery…Now it has its full complement of the limbs of the body. There are one hundred vulnerable joints with three hundred Asthas (bones?). There are seven skull pieces in the head created by the Self born Lord himself. O descendant of Bharata, there are three and half crores of hairs on the limbs. There are seventy two thousand Nadis (nerve vessels) fanning out.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Both these passages are contradicting each other. Hinduism believes that a woman becomes pregnant after semen mixes with her menstrual blood. Semen contains millions of sperm and a woman becomes pregnant when a sperm enters egg of the female and not when entire semen mixes with blood. Every Purana which talks about Embryology says that a woman becomes pregnant after her blood mixes with semen which is a scientific error. Foetus doesn’t take the form of a jujube in a week. The above verse from Brahma Vaivarta Purana says that foetus takes the shape of a lump of flesh without hands and feet in three months and is vested with hands and legs in the fifth month which is not correct because the foetus starts developing limbs in 8 weeks (2 months) and by 14th week (3 ½ month) the lower limbs are well developed, refer Mayo Clinic’c articles <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/prenatal-care/art-20045302?pg=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Link 1<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/fetal-development/art-20046151?pg=2" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Link 2<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>,</p>
<p>In this article by <a href="https://www.babycenter.com/fetal-development-week-by-week" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">babycenter.com<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> you can see pictures of foetus development week by week.</p>
<p>It also says that the baby “partakes of the remains of the food eaten by its mother” while the baby doesn’t eat food in the womb, it gets all nutrients from the umbilical cord. Now let’s move on to Skanda Purana. It says that in the third month the baby gets the power of hearing, whereas the baby begins to hear from the 18th week (4 ½ month), refer <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/fetal-development/art-20046151" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Mayo Clinic<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>‘s article. It also says that the baby obtains sense of movement, digestive power in the third month whereas this happens after the fourth month, Refer <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/fetal-development/art-20046151" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Mayo Clinic<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. Blood begins to flow in the 6th week and heart pumps about 100 pints of blood each day in 17th week (4 month &amp; 1 week) but Skanda Purana says that blood begins to flow in the fifth month, refer <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/fetal-development/art-20046151" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Mayo Clinic<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> and <a href="http://www.parents.com/pregnancy/stages/fetal-development/first-trimester-images-of-your-developing-baby/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Parents.com<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. Skanda Purana says that in the sixth month the baby grows hairs and nails and by seventh month it has all hairs and nails whereas baby’s fingernails starts forming in 10 weeks (2 months &amp; 2 weeks) and toenails appears in 14-15 (3 ½ months) weeks and develops in 17th week (4 months and 1 week), refer Mayo Clinic <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/prenatal-care/art-20045302?pg=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">link 1<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/fetal-development/art-20046151" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">link 2<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> and <a href="https://embryology.med.unsw.edu.au/embryology/index.php/Integumentary_System_-_Nail_Development" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">UNSW.edu.au<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. Hairs starts growing in 22 week (5 months &amp; 2 week) and gets a full head of hairs by 30th week (7 month &amp; 2 weeks), refer Mayo Clinic, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/fetal-development/art-20046151?pg=2" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">link 1<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> &amp; <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/fetal-development/art-20045997" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">link 2<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. Skanda Purana is bit correct about bones of baby but not precisely accurate, a new born baby has 270-350 bones. It says that baby’s skulll has 7 pieces whereas the skull of a baby consists of five main bones: two frontal bones, two parietal bones, and one occipital bone. These are joined by fibrous sutures, which allow movement that facilitates childbirth and brain growth, refer <a href="http://www.stanfordchildrens.org/en/topic/default?id=anatomy-of-the-newborn-skull-90-P01840" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Stanford Children’s Health<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> &amp; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fontanelle" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Wikipedia<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>.</p>
<p>Now let’s evaluate Embryology mentioned in Padma and Bhagavad Puranas,</p>
<p>Padma Purana II.66.22-38 …The semen with the blood (of the woman) would be (turned into) a foetus in a day. Then within five nights bubbles would be formed in the foetus. It takes the form of flesh in the five forms; neck, head, shoulder (s), spine and belly; so also hands and feet, the two sides, waists, and (the other parts of) the body; the limbs are produced one by one within two months. After three months, hundreds of sharp joints are produced (i.e. formed). Fingers etc. are produced (i.e. are formed) one by one in four months. After five months mouth, nose and ears are produced (i.e. formed). Within six months, the row of teeth, so also tongue and nails are formed, so also cavities in the ears are formed. So also are formed anus, penis, organ of generation and the male organ of generation. The joints which (are present) in the limbs, are formed within seven months. In the eight month the head with the entire body with limbs and with each limb clearly separated is formed. He is complete and endowed with five. Due to the power of the food of (i.e. eaten by) the mother and by the tastes of six kinds, fixed in the umbilical cord (i.e. the foetus) grows day by day.” Tr. N.A Deshpande</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 3.31.2-5 “On the first night, the sperm and ovum mix, and on the fifth night the mixture ferments into a bubble. On the tenth night it develops into a form like a plum, and after that, it gradually turns into a lump of flesh or an egg, as the case may be. In the course of a month, a head is formed, and at the end of two months the hands, feet and other limbs take shape. By the end of three months, the nails, fingers, toes, body hair, bones and skin appear, as do the organ of generation and the other apertures in the body, namely the eyes, nostrils, ears, mouth and anus. Within four months from the date of conception, the seven essential ingredients of the body, namely chyle, blood, flesh, fat, bone, marrow and semen, come into existence. At the end of five months, hunger and thirst make themselves felt, and at the end of six months, the fetus, enclosed by the amnion, begins to move on the right side of the abdomen. Deriving its nutrition from the food and drink taken by the mother, the fetus grows and remains in that abominable residence of stools and urine, which is the breeding place of all kinds of worms.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam says a head is formed in a month whereas head develops in 7<sup>th</sup> week (1 month &amp; 3 weeks) refer <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/prenatal-care/art-20045302?pg=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Mayo Clinic’s article<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. It says by the end of third month (i.e. on 3<sup>rd</sup> month) nails appear whereas baby’s fingernails starts forming in 10 weeks (2 months &amp; 2 weeks) and toenails appears in 14-15 weeks (around 3 ½ months) and develops in 17th week (4 months and 1 week), refer Mayo Clinic <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/prenatal-care/art-20045302?pg=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">link 1<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/fetal-development/art-20046151" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">link 2<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. Srimad Bhagavatam says that fingers, nostrils, toes, reproductive organ appears in third month whereas it occurs much early than that, fingers starts forming at 8<sup>th</sup> week (2 months), nostrils form at 7-8 week (around 2 months), toes forms at 9<sup>th</sup> week (2 month &amp; 1 week), genitals develops on 11<sup>th</sup> week (2 months &amp; 3 week), refer <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/prenatal-care/art-20045302?pg=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Mayo Clinic’s article<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>.</p>
<p>Now let’s evaluate Padma Purana. Padma Purana says fingers are formed in 4 months which is contrary to what is mentioned in Srimad Bhagavatam which says they are formed in 3 months but in reality this occurs much earlier than that, reference is already given above. It says after five months nose, ears are produced whereas ears starts developing much earlier than that i.e. in 8<sup>th</sup> week (2 months) and baby may begin to hear by 18<sup>th</sup> week (4 months &amp; 2 weeks), refer <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/prenatal-care/art-20045302?pg=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Link 1<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/fetal-development/art-20046151?pg=2" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Link 2<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. And nose is formed in 2<sup>nd</sup> month (week 8) refer <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/prenatal-care/art-20045302?pg=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Mayo Clinic<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. It says nails are formed in 6<sup>th</sup> month whereas baby’s fingernails starts forming in 10 weeks (2 months &amp; 2 weeks) and toenails appears in 14-15 weeks and develops in 17th week (4 months and 1 week), refer Mayo Clinic <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/prenatal-care/art-20045302?pg=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">link 1<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/fetal-development/art-20046151" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">link 2<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> and <a href="https://embryology.med.unsw.edu.au/embryology/index.php/Integumentary_System_-_Nail_Development" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">UNSW.edu.au<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. Padma Purana says that reproductive organs are formed in 6th month which is contrary to what is mentioned in Srimad Bhagavatam which says that reproductive organ is formed in 3 months which are both contradictory. Organ of generation develops on 11<sup>th</sup> week (2 months &amp; 3 week), refer <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/prenatal-care/art-20045302?pg=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Mayo Clinic’s article<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>.</p>

<h1><a id="post-6594-3"></a>Semen is produced?</h1>
<p>These verses even says that bone is produced from fat,</p>
<p>Brahma Purana 70.49 “Fat is produced from flesh; bone is produced from fat; marrow is generated from bone and semen is produced from marrow.” Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Also mentioned in Brahmanda Purana 2.3.72.44</p>
<p>Harivamsa Purana 1.40.48-56 “The distillate of various foods, rasa, vital-juice, produces blood, and flesh is produced from that blood; fat comes from flesh and bones from that fat; bones generate marrow and marrow generates seminal fluid, from which pregnancy occurs; hence, rasa, vital-fluid is substratum of all… Water is the primary principle of that rasa, vital-fluid, and this belongs to the soma, the moon, or, the nectarean principle of the moon, in the somatology – Greek – soma -atos ‘body’ and its formation… heat resides in the second half, say in menstrual blood… hence, the being of living beings is a compound of coolness and heatedness of the moon and fire. Thus the essence of all juice, the seminal fluid, is created by an excess of phlegm; blood is created by an excess billious matter. The seat of phlegm is the heart and the seat of bile is the navel. The heart, which is in the body, is known as the seat of the mind. The fire exists behind the cavity of the navel – jaThara agni – is none other than huta-ashana, the devourer of oblations, whose life-spirit is madhu-sUdana. Mind is known as prajApati, the phlegm as soma and the bile as agni. Thus the whole world is a commixture of heat and cold. Where a conception takes place, as is the formation of a cloud, the air enters there accompanied by the Absolute… It then creates the various limbs and nourishes them. Inside the body the vital air divides itself into five kinds of airs, namely prANa, apAna, samAna, samAna and vyAna, and gradually assumes proportions.” Tr. Desiraju Hanumant Rao</p>
<p>Vayu Purana II.35.45-46 ”From flesh fat is produced and bone is developed from fat. Pith and marrow are developed from bone and semen virile is generated from marrow; foetus is developed from semen through assimilative activity of Rasa bodily fluid (or through the activity rooted in sexual pleasure).” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>

<h1><a id="post-6594-4"></a>Conceiving pregnancy at will without intercourse</h1>
<p>Hinduism says that sexual intercourse wasn’t needed to conceive birth in ancient period and offspring were begotten by flat of the will and in the succeeding Yuga women conceived pregnancies just by touch,</p>
<p>Mahabharata 12.207.38-40 “…Sexual congress, O chief of the Bharatas, was then not necessary for perpetuating the species. In those days offspring were begotten by flat of the will. In the age that followed, viz., Treta, children were begotten by touch alone. The people of that age even, O monarch, were above the necessity of sexual congress. It was in the next age, viz., Dwapara, that the practice of sexual congress originated, O king, to prevail among men. In the Kali age, O monarch, men have come to marry and live in pairs…” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Vayu Purana II.2.45 ”The creation of the earlier ones was due to thought, sight, and touch. Thenceforth, the subjects in this world were born of sexual intercourse.” Tr. G.V. Tagare, edited by G.P. Bhatt</p>
<p>Seer Urva is said to have created a son named Aurva with his mental ability,</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 175.43-44 ”…If one has the seed of asceticism within him, he can create a son from his mind…The ascetics ought to beget progeny out of the embryo created by their mind, and your address to me is bereft of dharma, and is like the speech of those who are not good. By the power of my innerself, I shall create a son, without the help of a woman, after illumining my mind with the glory of asceticism. I shall create such a son out of my soul, who would be ready to consume the creation. Afterwards the sage Urva, absorbed in his asceticism, throwing his thighs into the fire rubbed them with a kusu grass. Then the son in the form of Fire, desirous of consuming the universe, was produced from his thigh, by its own force without the help of any firewood. In such a way the fearful Aurva was begotten from the thigh of the seer Urva.” Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, Edited by B.D. Basu</p>

<h1><a id="post-6594-5"></a>Conceiving pregnancy by drinking semen</h1>
<p>Hinduism also says that a woman can become pregnant by drinking semen. It even says that animals can become pregnant after drinking human semen,</p>
<p>Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Brahma Kanda 20.33-46 “…At that time, Menaka was passing by that way, At the sight of her thigh and breast the semen of the saint was discharged. Thereupon the woman Kalavati drank it cheerfully, went to her husband, bowed to him and told him everything about, her pregnancy…” Tr. Rajendra Nath Sen</p>
<p>Varaha Purana 95.20-21 “Finding the water fragrant (with it), Mahismati told her friends that she would drink it. She then drank the water containing the emission of the sage. As a result she conceived and in due time brought forth, a son named Mahisa, intelligent and valiant.” Tr. Venkitaasubramonia Iyer, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Skanda Purana III.iii.19.64 The semen virile of the royal sage Yupaketu fell into water. It is said that a harlot drank that water together with the semen and became pregnant” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Skanda Purana V.iii.5.27-37 “…O excellent king, Paramesthin Rudra sported about with Uma in the vast expanse of sea-like water. A splendid girl was born out of the sweat of Uma due to her delight. When Sarva’s chest pressed against the breasts of Uma, a great girl of lotus-like eyes issued forth from the sweat…” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 4.2.13-17 “Yuvanaswa had no son, at which he was deeply grieved. Whilst residing in the vicinage of the holy Munis, he inspired them with pity for his childless condition, and they instituted a religious rite to procure him progeny. One night during its performance the sages having placed a vessel of consecrated water upon the altar had retired to repose. It was past midnight, when the king awoke, exceedingly thirsty; and unwilling to disturb any of the holy inmates of the dwelling, he looked about for something to drink. In his search he came to the water in the jar, which had been sanctified and endowed with prolific efficacy by sacred texts, and he drank it. When the Munis rose, and found that the water had been drunk, they inquired who had taken it, and said, “The queen that has drunk this water shall give birth to a mighty and valiant son.” “It was I,” exclaimed the Raja, “who unwittingly drank the water!” and accordingly in the belly of Yuvanaswa was conceived a child, and it grew, and in due time it ripped open the right side of the Raja, and was born, and the Raja, did not die&#8230;&#8221; Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Animals becoming pregnant,</p>
<p>Skanda Purana III.iii.19.65 “After drinking the semen of Sage Vibhandaka together with water, a female deer became pregnant and gave birth to Rsyasrnga.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Mahabharata 1.3.17 “…The Rishi thus addressed, answered Janamejaya, ‘O Janamejaya, this my son, deep in ascetic devotions, accomplished in the study of the Vedas, and endued with the full force of my asceticism, is born of (the womb of) a she-snake that had drunk my vital fluid…” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 5.2.27-31 “…Vyasa said :– O king! Hearing thus the sweet words of Fire, Rambha quitted the hold of his hairs and said :– O Lord of the Devas! If thou art pleased, grant my desired boon that a son be born unto me, who will destroy the forces of my enemy and who will conquer the three worlds. And that son be invincible in every way by the Devas, Danavas and men, very powerful, assuming forms at will, and respected by all. The Fire [Agni] said :– O highly Fortunate! You will get your son, as you desire; therefore desist now from your attempting suicide. O highly fortunate Rambha! With any female of whichever species, you will co-habit, you will get a son, more powerful than you; there is no doubt in this. Vyasa said :– O king! Hearing thus the sweet words of the Fire as desired, Rambha, the chief of the Danavas, went, surrounded by Yaksas, to a beautiful place, adorned with picturesque sceneries; when one lovely she-buffalo, who was very maddened with passion, fell to the sight of Rambha. And he desired to have sexual intercourse with her, in preference to other women. The she-buffallo, too, gladly yielded to his purpose and Rambha had sexual intercourse with her, impelled as it were by the destiny. The she-buffalo became pregnant with his semen virile…” Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>

<p>Earth according to Vedas is four cornered,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.58.3 Thy spirit, that went far away, away to the four cornered earth…</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana says the same,</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahman 6.1.2.29 …Now this earth is four-cornered, for the quarters are her corners: hence the bricks are four-cornered; for all the bricks are after the manner of this earth.</p>

<p>Rig Veda 8.6.5 &#8220;His might is manifest, for Indra folds and unfolds both heaven and earth, as (one spreads or rolls up) a skin.&#8221; Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Rig Veda 6.8.3 “Wonderful Mitra propped the heaven and earth apart, and covered and concealed the darkness with his light. He made the two bowls part asunder like two skins. Vaiśvānara put forth all his creative power.” Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>One can Google how a hide (skin of animal) is stretched and spread. Some Puranas describes the earth as lotus shaped,</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 2.12.36 “From the waters, which are the body of Vishnu, was produced the lotus shaped earth, with its seas and mountains.” Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.34.44 “The lotus that was fashioned by Visnu grew from his umbilicus. The earth along with the forests and the trees was evolved in the shape of a lotus.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam describes the planetary system or the earth as lotus shaped and Jambudvipa (Which is supposed to where we live) in the shape of leaf of a lotus flower,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 5.16.5 “The planetary system known as Bhū-maṇḍala resembles a lotus flower, and its seven islands resemble the whorl of that flower. The length and breadth of the island known as Jambūdvīpa, which is situated in the middle of the whorl, are one million yojanas [eight million miles]. Jambūdvīpa is round like the leaf of a lotus flower.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Markandeya Purana 156.22 also mentions Earth as a lotus. Puranas says that Vishnu flattened the Earth,</p>
<p>Padma Purana 1.3.55 “The beginningless supreme being, then having flattened the earth, piled the mountains on it according to (its) divisions.” Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 1.4.45-48 “The supreme being thus eulogized, upholding the earth, raised it quickly, and placed it on the summit of the ocean, where it floats like a mighty vessel, and from its expansive surface does not sink beneath the waters. Then, having levelled the earth, the great eternal deity divided it into portions, by mountains…” Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Kurma Purana I.6.25 “He levelled the earth and gathered the mountains together on it…” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Shiva Purana VayaviyaSamhita 7, Section I.11.34-35; Vayu Purana I.6.27 “The Boar brought the earth to its own place. It then assumed his natural form and fixed it there. He levelled the earth, fixed the mountains and set up the four worlds on the earth as before.” Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Veda says that the Earth is stretched or spread out. Hindus often uses such verses against other religions, wondering what they will have to say about these,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 3.6.5 Great are the deeds of thee, the Great, O Agni: thou by thy power hast spread out earth and heaven.</p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.62.3 Ye raised the Sun to heaven by everlasting Law, and spread broad earth, the Mother</p>

<p>Some translates words like Gau, Bhu Mandala as globe which is misleading, they try to insert their own definitions while according to Hinduism, the Earth is four-cornered, lotus shaped, shaped like a leaf of a lotus flower etc, but the idea of Earth as a flat circular disk is emphasised in the Puranas. Puranas describes the earth as a flat disc of enormous size. In its centre was Mount Meru, round which sun, moon and stars revolved. Around Meru were continents or regions (Dvipa), separated from the central peak by oceans, and named according to the great trees which stood on their shores opposite Meru. According to some Puranas there are Saptadvipas (four regions/continents/islands) in the world and as per some there are Chaturdvipa (four Dvipas) including Jambduvipa. Below the earth are seven levels of hell and above the earth is heaven, the earth is established on waters. This is the description of earth given in Hindu scriptures. The verses are not clear, but if you search Jambudvipa on Google then you will find stuff related to Earth as a Flat Circular disc also if you imagine the Earth as described in Puranas then you will get a flat circular earth.</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 2.2.4-36 “PARÁŚARA.–You shall hear, Maitreya, a brief account of the earth from me: a full detail I could not give you in a century. The seven great insular continents are Jambu, Plaksha, Sálmali, Kuśa, Krauncha, Śáka, and Pushkara: and they are surrounded severally by seven great seas; the sea of salt water (Lavańa), of sugar-cane juice (Ikshu), of wine (Surá), of clarified butter (Sarpi), of curds (Dadhi), of milk (Dugdha), and of fresh water (Jala). Jambu-dwípa is in the centre of all these: and in the centre of this continent is the golden mountain Meru…The capital of Brahma is enclosed by the river Ganges, which, issuing from the foot of Vishńu, and washing the lunar orb, falls here from the skies…” Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Agni Purana 212.33-35 “…Obeisance to the mount Meru, the representative of Vishnu on earth. Salutation unto the mountain which forms the main stay of the earth. I make obeisance to the mountain situate at the centre of the earth…” Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Harivamsha Purana 3.34.4 “Containing the earth within four boundaries, the Lord created the great ocean. At the centre of the earth, the golden mountain, meru was installed.” Tr. Desiraju Hanumanta Rao</p>
<p>Padma Purana VII.2.10-17 “…At the centre of the earth he produced the great mountain (viz. Meru) with jewelled peaks…” Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana I.2.21.13-16 “…The extent of the earth towards all the sides (quarters) from the middle of the Meru is remembered as one crore and eightynine lakhs (of Yojanas)…” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 2.4.87-93 “…In this manner the seven island continents are encompassed successively by the seven oceans, and each ocean and continent is respectively of twice the extent of that which precedes it…” Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Following verses shows that Mount Meru is in the middle of the earth with land surrounding it and the land is separated by oceans,</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.34.37 “From the unmanifest the great lotus of the earth is evolved. Its pericarp is the four-cornered Meru that is five times great.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 123.27-28 “Thus the seven dvipas are surrounded by the seven oceans…” Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, Edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>Linga Purana I.46.1 “The Earth consists of seven continents. It is full of rivers and mountains. It is surrounded by seven oceans all round and embellished by them.” Tr. Board of Scholars, Edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.34.46 “The four famous great continents are stationed on the petals. The powerful Meru is stationed on the pericarp.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Similar thing is mentioned in Mahabharata,</p>
<p>Mahabharata 6.6.18-21 “Besides Meru are situated, O lord, these four islands, viz., Bhadraswa, and Ketumala, and Jamvudwipa otherwise called Bharata, and Uttar-Kuru which is the abode of persons who have achieved the merit of righteousness. The bird Sumukha, the son of Suparna, beholding that all the birds on Meru were of golden plumage, reflected that he should leave that mountain inasmuch as there was no difference between the good, middling, and bad birds. The foremost of luminaries, the sun, always circumambulates Meru” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.34.56 “That Meru, the purifier of living beings, is encircled by worlds. Four islands are established on its different sides.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.50.68-70 “The entire earth is known as fifty crores (of Yojanas) in extent. From the middle of Meru on all four sides is half of it. Half the extent of the earth is stated in terms of Yojanas. The extent of the earth towards all the sides (quarters) from the middle of Meru is said to be eleven crores and eighty nine lakhs (of Yojanas) and fifty thousand.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana I.2.15.12-13 “Jambudvipa is immense and glorious with huge zones all round. It is encircled by nine worlds that evolve a number of living beings. It is surrounded on all sides by the briny sea the extent of which is equal to that of Jambudvipa itself.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>

<p>Padma Purana 1.19.166-171 &#8220;&#8230;O you creator of the worlds, you are the protector and creator of us and (also) of the worlds. This flat world will be elevated by your favour&#8230;&#8221; Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p>The above verse mentions Vishnu’s boar avatar Varaha lifting up the “Flat world”, almost all ancient Hindu temples depict Varaha holding personified earth or Bhudevi and not flat or spherical earth. Many Hindus have falsely presented idols of Varaha from the 21<sup>st</sup> century as ancient ones where Varaha is depicted as holding up spherical earth, but all those false information has been debunked <a href="https://www.vishvasnews.com/english/viral/fact-check-this-varaha-statue-is-not-thousand-years-old-viral-claim-is-misleading/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">here<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. However, there are plenty of pictures from the medieval period depicting Varaha holding up flat earth. Though there are many pictures from the 17<sup>th</sup> to 19<sup>th</sup> century, I am reproducing a few pictures here,</p>

Idol of Varaha depicts it holding flat earth by its tusks at Adi Varaha Temple, Mathura. Though the date of this idol is unknown, it is believed to be the oldest Varaha temple. And finds mention in Varaha Purana chapter 163 stating that the idol was created by Sage Kapila.</p>

<h1><a id="post-6594-9"></a>Earth is immovable</h1>
<p>There are chapters in Puranas about movements of planets. It mentions revolution of all planets of our solar system like Venus, Mercury, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn and even satellite and star like Moon and Sun but nowhere mentions the movement of the Earth. Which proves that the Earth according to Hinduism is stationary.</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana 2.3.52.8 &#8220;The earth overwhelmed by the ocean began to quake though its name is Acala (immovable). There was a break and hindrance in the penance and abstract meditation of the ascetics.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Mahabharata, Anushasana Parva 12, Section 62, verse 2 &#8220;Bhishma said, &#8216;Of all kinds of gifts, the gift of earth has been said to be the first (in point of merit). Earth is immovable and indestructible&#8230;&#8221; Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Vamana Purana 8.26 &#8220;I bow down to the Worshipful Lord Visnu who raised the immovable earth with one single tusk, who sustains everything, and who sleeps absorbing the entire universe in Him.&#8221; Tr. Ananada Swarup Gupta</p>
<p>Mahabharata 13.62.2 “…Earth is immovable and indestructible…” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Mahabharata 5.76.7-8 “Behold, O Krishna, these the firmament and the earth which are immovable, immense, and infinite, and which are the refuge of, and in which are born these countless creatures.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.35.11; Linga Purana I.49.25b-27 “Meru has four great ranges (legs) in all the four quarters. Held by them, the earth with her seven continents does not move.” Tr. G.V. tagare</p>

<p>Brahmanda Purana 1.2.21.87-88 “Everyday the sun traverses those (zones) in due order. Just as the outer rim of the potter’s wheel comes back quickly (i.e. revolves), so also the sun functions quickly during his Souther transit. Hence, he traverses a major portion of the Earth in the course of a shorter period.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana I.2.23.44-45 “Thus the sun traverses the quarters by means of his swift chariot with one wheel. The horses are splendid but they do not have the usual place (? Akramaih).

<p>Matsya Purana 126.41-46 “The Sun in course of one single day and night goes swiftly over the world consisting of the seven oceans and the seven islands, seating in His one-wheeled chariot and drawn by seven horses. The seven horses yoked to the Sun’s chariot are no other than the seven chhandas metres); they can assume forms at their will; they go as they like…Ascending on such a chariot the Sun travels the earth in course of one day (24 hours.) The horses were yoked at the beginning of Kalpa and carry on the Sun toll the end of the Great Dissolution (Maha Pralaya). Thus He goes on round and round, day and night, surrounded by the Valakhillya Munis…” Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, Edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 128.71-73 “The Sun moves lowest down of all the planets. Above Him the Moon travels.

Taluqdar of Oudh, Edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.52.43-44 “Thus the Sun moves ahead quickly in his celestial sphere by means of his single-wheeled chariot dragged by the unimpaired gentle horses.

<p>Vayu Purana I.50.119-121; Matsya Purana 124.40-60 “When the sun passes through the middle of the sky, it traverses one thirtieth of the diameter of the earth in a Muhurta (forty eight minutes). In regard to the distance traversed in Yojanas, know that it is three million one hundred and fifty thousand in full. This is the distance traverses by the sun in one Muhurta.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 5.22.5 “The sun-god, who is Nārāyaṇa, or Viṣṇu, the soul of all the worlds, is situated in outer space between the upper and lower portions of the universe. Passing through twelve months on the wheel of time, the sun comes in touch with twelve different signs of the zodiac…” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 5.22.7 “The sun-god has three speeds — slow, fast and moderate. The time he takes to travel entirely around the spheres of heaven, earth<br />
and space at these three speeds is referred to, by learned scholars, by the five names Saṁvatsara, Parivatsara, Iḍāvatsara, Anuvatsara and Vatsara.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana 8:7:2:5 …having once revolved round these worlds, that sun would not pass by them. Let him lay down the two last alongside the two first by reaching over them: he thus causes that sun to pass by these worlds; and hence that sun revolves incessantly round these worlds again and again (from left) to right.</p>
<p>Varaha Purana 26.8 “From its lustre arose twelve suns, and the principal one among these now revolves round the world.” Tr. Vankitasubramonia Iyer, Edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Mahabharata 6.6.7-16 “…This (the land where we are) is in the Varsha that is called after Bharata…Besides Meru are situated, O lord, these four islands, viz., Bhadraswa, and Ketumala, and Jamvudwipa otherwise called Bharata, and Uttar-Kuru…The foremost of luminaries, the sun, always circumambulates Meru, as also the moon with (his) attendant constellation, and the Wind-god too…” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Mount Meru is in the centre of the world.</p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.35.9 “The gold-handed, all-beholding luminary travels between the two regions of heaven and earth, dispels diseases, and this, verily, is known as the sun, and it finally overspreads the sky, extending from the dark interspace to the celestial region” Tr. SatyaPrakash Saraswati.</p>
<p>Nirukta 7.23 The sun having first revolved towards the northern hemisphere, a person holds a polished (piece of) white copper, or crystal, focusing the sun-rays in a place where there is some dry cow-dung, without touching it… Now (had VaisVauara been the sun), there would have occurred expressions relating to VaisVanara in those same hymns and shares which are assigned to celestial deities, i.e. Savitr, [Surya], Pusan, Visnu, and [the VisVedevas.] And they would have praised him by (attributing to him) the functions of the sun, as thou risest, thou settest, thou revolvest, &amp;c.</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 13.2.6 “Hail to thy rapid car whereon, O Sūrya, thou circlest in a moment both the limits…[44] The suppliant&#8217;s way, filling the earth, the Mighty circleth the world with eye that none deceiveth…” Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.50.60 “Revolving all round, the Sun illuminates and protects the three worlds. Hence on account of illumination and protection, he is called ‘Ravi’. The root av means ‘illumination’ (and protection.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Following verses shows movements of the Sun,</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana I.2.21.35-36 “Understand the movement of the sun during the southern transit, as he goes to that quarter. His movement is above all the guardians of the quarters. During this southern transit, the sun rushes forward like an arrow that is discharged. He revolved always, taking the circle of luminaries with him.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana 1.2.21.45-46 “The sun revolves rapidly like the whirling firebrand. Moving about, the sun traverses the revolving constellations. Thus the sun thereby moves to the south among the four quarters. The sun rises and sets again and again.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 125.50-58 …The success of the sun’s chariot is due to the conjunction (with Dhruva). Thus this divine solar chariot moves about in the heaven. The pins of the yoke and axle are on its south. The pair of reins of the yoke and the wheel of this aerial chariot revolve round and round in all directions like the potter’s wheel…</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 5.22.6 “Thus the time the sun takes to rotate through half of outer space is called an ayana, or its period of movement [in the north or in the south].” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.51.68-69 “With that the lord Sun moves quickly in the heaven. There are two reins of the chariot tied to the tips of the pole and the axle. Propelled by Dhruva the chariot moves in the sky in a circular fashion.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.50.92-93 “Understand the solar movement when the sun reaches south during the southern transit all round above the guardians of the worlds. In his transit to the south, the sun moves fast like a discharged arrow. It takes the group of luminary bodies with it and revolves always.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.50.151-4 “During the northern transit, the movement of the moon (?) is slow during day and fast during night. During the southern transit the sun’s movement is dast during day and slow during night. Dividing nights and days thus by its special diverse movements, the sun traverses the path by its even (regular) and uneven (irregular) movement.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Many verses are clearly saying that the sun travels around the earth so there is no way for apologists to defend these verses. Also read categories like Sun moves in a chariot pulled by Seven Horses, Speed of Sun moving around the Earth which proves that the Sun indeed revolves around the earth as per Hinduism.</p>

<h1><a id="post-6594-11"></a>Sun moves in a chariot pulled by seven horses</h1>
<p>Sun travelling in a horse pulled by seven horses is quite similar to Greek mythology&#8217;s Sun god <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helios" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Helios<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. Indian Prime Minister from the Hindu nationalist party said that, <a href="http://www.hindustantimes.com/india/india-can-lead-fight-against-global-warming-pm-modi/story-2IKlOQEcBApVtoKw1XCaUI.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">In our mythology we have imagined the sun god Surya riding on seven horses<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. This has basis in Hindu scriptures which says,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.50.8; 1.50.1 O, Bright sun, a chariot named harit with seven horses takes you to sky</p>
<p>Mahabharata book 13.158.20-22 …the sun possessed of a thousand rays… He it is that constitutes the wheel of the year, having three naves and seven horses to drag it…He is the sun, the dispeller of all darkness.</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 5.21.12-19 “Thus the chariot of the sun-god, which is trayimaya, or worshiped by the words om bhur bhuvah svah, travels through the four residences…My dear King, the carriage of the sun-god’s chariot is estimated to be 3,600,000 yojanas [28,800,000 miles] long and one-fourth as wide [900,000 yojanas, or 7,200,000 miles]. The chariot’s horses, which are named after Gayatri and other Vedic meters, are harnessed by Arunadeva to a yoke that is also 900,000 yojanas wide. This chariot continuously carries the sun-god. Although Arunadeva sits in front of the sun-god and is engaged in driving the chariot and controlling the horses, he looks backward toward the sun-god…My dear King, in his orbit through Bhu-mandala [Earth], the sun-god traverses a distance of 95,100,000 yojanas [760,800,000 miles] at the speed of 2,000 yojanas and two krosas [16,004 miles] in a moment.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana I.2.23.50 “…The lord of the day (i.e. the sun) thus revolves and wanders by means of horses that gallop and that are as swift as birds.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Linga Purana I.55.81-82 “Thus the sun, the harbinger of the day moves ahead quickly in a single wheeled chariot drawn by seven green imperishable horses. He whirls day and night in his chariot which has a single wheel. He traverses in heaven over the seven continents and oceans with the help of seven groups.” Tr. Board of Scholars, Edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Devi Bhagwatam 8.15.40-45 “…The seat of the Sun on his chariot measures 36 Lakh Yoyanas wide. The Yuga measures in length one fourth of the above dimensions, that of his seat. The Chariot is moved by seven horses, consisting of the seven Chhandas, Gâyatrî, etc., driven by Aruna. The horses carry the Sun for the happiness of all. Though the charioteer sits in front of the Sun, his face is turned towards the west. He does his work as a charioteer in that state…” Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>It&#8217;s possibly inspired by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trundholm_sun_chariot" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Trundholm Sun Chariot<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> commonly found in the European mythologies. Some apologists tries to defend this by saying that seven horses mentioned here are not actually horses but seven rays. In many Hindu scriptures the Sun is described as of having a thousand rays not 7 rays and none of the Puranas or the Mahabharat explains seven horses as seven rays, so this proves that its apologists concocted explanation which has no basis. If seven horses are described as seven rays then does that mean the Moon too emits ten rays as Hindu scriptures describes moon moving in a chariot pulled by 10 horses. Sun is described in Hindu scriptures including the Vedas as of having 1000 rays not 7 rays, these 7 horses’ names are different than the names of rays of sun given in Hindu scriptures. Hindu scriptures clearly mentions that the seven horses are seven Vedic metres who have assumed the shape of horses. Some also explain it by saying that one wheel of the chariot signifies day or year, five spokes in it signifies five seasons etc. which is true to an extent but the one wheel represents year and five spokes of the chariot represents five seasons, the chariot is not a metaphor. Just as in the Tricolor (Indian flag) the saffron, white and green represents courage and sacrifice, peace and truth, and faith and chivalry respectively, the Ashoka Chakra in the middle represents the eternal wheel of law so the wheel of the chariot and its spokes too represent year and seasons in the same manner. Hindu scriptures even gives the size of Sun’s chariot, how will apologists explain that? If it is symbolic then why Hindu scriptures mentioned the size of chariot? And why do they say that Sun moves around in his chariot? Hindu scriptures also mentions chariot of moon what does it signify? Also check above topic especially Brahmanda Purana I.2.23.44-45 and Vayu Purana I.52.43-44 which clearly states about Sun revolving around the earth in a chariot pulled by horses and even has a charioteer in front. Logically speaking does the Sun rotates or revolves through rays if horses means rays? Before speaking about 7 horses of the sun, the Mahabharata verse mentions 1000 rays of the sun which makes it pretty clear that 7 horses aren’t really rays, moreover if seven horses of the sun means 7 rays of the sun then what does 10 horses of the moon means? Hindu text mentions 10 horses of the moon also, does that mean moon also emits 10 types of rays?</p>

<h1><a id="post-6594-12"></a>Even the Moon moves around the earth in a chariot pulled by horses</h1>
<p>Brahmanda Purana 1.2.23.50-51 “He is served by Gandharvas and groups of celestial damsels by means of sons and dances. The lord of the day (i.e. the sun) thus revolves and wanders by means of horses that gallop and that are as swift as birds. The chariot of Soma (the Moon) has three wheels. His horses have the lustre of Kunda (white jasmine) flowers. They are ten in number and they are yoked to the left as well as to the right. The moon traverses by means of this.” Tr. Board of Scholars, Edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.52.50-51 “The chariot of the Moon has three wheels. The horses are tied in pairs on either side. The chariot along with the horses and the charioteer has come out of the womb of the waters. The three wheels have a hundred spokes. Excellent white horses have been yoked thereto. They are ten in number. They are slender and divine. They are unimpeded and have the velocity of the mind. They are yoked but once (in the beginning of the Kalpa) and they travels till the end of the Yugas.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>

<h1><a id="post-6594-13"></a>Speed of Sun moving around the Earth</h1>
<p>Linga Purana Section I.54.9-12 “…Similarly when the sucker of waters (i.e. the sun) moves about in the middle of Puskara the mountain to the north of Manasa, he traverses a thirtieth part of the earth in a Muhurta (48 mts). Understand this number in yojanas travelled in a Muhurta. The speed of the noble souled sun per Muhurta is three million one hundred and fifty thousand yojanas…” Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.50.119-121 “When the sun passes through the middle of the sky, it traverses one thirtieth of the diameter of the earth in a Muhurta (forty eight minutes). In regard to the distance traversed in Yojanas, know that it is three million one hundred and fifty thousand in full. This is the distance traverses by the sun in one Muhurta.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>1 Muhurta = 48 minutes</p>
<p>1 Yojana = 8 miles (as per Hindu translators of Puranas)</p>
<p>3,150,000 Yojana*8 miles = 25,200,000</p>
<p>25,200,000/48 = 525,000 i.e. speed in one minute</p>
<p>525,000*60 = 31,500,000 miles per hour</p>
<p>According to modern science,<br />
“The Sun’s orbital speed around the Galaxy: ~200 km/s (720,000 km/h, 450,000 mph) The speed of the ground beneath your feet, as a result of the Earth’s rotation: 1000 km/h (600 mph) at the latitude of Sheffield (53 degrees); it goes up to 1670 km/h (1000 mph) at the equator.”<br />

<p>The orbital speed of the sun given in Vayu Purana is 31,500,000 mph and the orbital speed of the sun according to science is 450,000 mph which is nowhere close to the speed given in Puranas. Brahmanda Purana mentions a different speed, so let’s have a look at that too,</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana I.2.21.60-65 “…Thus, when the sun traverses the middle of the sky, it passes through parts of the earth in the course of a Muhurta as it were (?) Understand the number of Yojanas here in the course of a Muhurta. It is one hundred and eightyone thousand Yojanas. This is the speed of the sun in a Muhurta.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>181,000*8 = 1,448,000 miles</p>
<p>1,448,000/48 = 30,166 in a minute</p>
<p>30,166*60= 1,810,000 mph</p>
<p>This speed given is also not correct, the speed given in Srimad Bhagavata (Bhagavad Purana) is different so let’s evaluate its authenticity as well,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 5.21.12 “Thus the chariot of the sun-god, which is trayīmaya, or worshiped by the words om bhūr bhuvaḥ svaḥ, travels through the four residences mentioned above at a speed of 3,400,800 yojanas [27,206,400 miles] in a muhūrta.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>mph already given hence,</p>
<p>27,206,400/48 (1 Muhurta) = 566,800</p>
<p>566,800*60= 34,008,000 mph</p>
<p>Whereas the orbital speed of the sun is 450,000 mph.</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 5.21.19 “My dear King, in his orbit through Bhū-maṇḍala, the sun-god traverses a distance of 95,100,000 yojanas [760,800,000 miles] at the speed of 2,000 yojanas and two krośas [16,004 miles] in a moment.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>

<h1><a id="post-6594-14"></a>Moon travels faster than the Sun</h1>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 5.22.8 “Above the rays of the sunshine by a distance of 100,000 yojanas [800,000 miles] is the moon, which travels at a speed faster than that of the sun. In two lunar fortnights the moon travels through the equivalent of a saṁvatsara of the sun, in two and a quarter days it passes through a month of the sun, and in one day it passes through a fortnight of the sun.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>It says that the Moon travels faster than the Sun.</p>
<p>“The Moon orbits Earth at a speed of 2,288 miles per hour (3,683 kilometers per hour). During this time it travels a distance of 1,423,000 miles (2,290,000 kilometers).”</p>

<h1><a id="post-6594-16"></a>Moon has water</h1>
<p>Vayu Purana I.53.57 “The orb of the Moon is of solid water and the orb of the Sun is of solid refulgence.” Tr. G.V. Tagare, Edited by G.P Bhatt</p>
<p>Another Vayu Purana may be saying the same,</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.53.84-86 “Thus the abodes and their resident deities are mentioned. The abode of the thousand rayed Sun is full of fire and sparkling. The abode of the thousand rayed Moon is full of water and sparkling white. The abode of the five rayed charming planet Budha is dark in color.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Linga Purana I.52.3 “The storehouse of water in the sky which is called Soma (moon) is the support of all living beings. To Devas, it is the receptacle of nectar.” Tr. Board of Scholars, Edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana I.2.23.78-79 “The divine spheres of the sun and the moon are sparkling and white. They are of the form (or full of) of fire and water. They move about in the firmament. They resemble auspicious round pots. The sphere of the moon is remembered to be consisting of dense water. The white and brilliantly sparkling sphere of the sun is composed of dense fiery splendour.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Hinduism also says that Moon is born from waters,</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 126.48 “The Moon has been born from waters along with His chariot, horses and the charioteer. That chariot is decorated with fine garlands and yoked with excellent white horses, rests on three wheels.” Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, Edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p><a href="#top">top</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1><a id="post-6594-17"></a>How Full Moon occurs</h1>
<p>According to Hinduism, the Sun fills the moon with a nectar which lasts until 33330 Devas drinks it and turns it dark. The nectar is described as sweet like honey and consisting of the essence of the watery juice. It is the food of the Devas which makes them immortal. Seems this is the Soma Ras.</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.52.60-66 “Beginning with the second day in the dark half and ending with the fourteenth day Devas drink the watery wine, the nectar of the Moon that is essentially made up of water and that by nature consists of tasty essence. By the brilliance of the Sun the nectar is collected and prepared in the course of a fortnight. On the full moon night Devas, Pitrs and the sages attend the Moon facing the Sun. The digits being drunk decline gradually in the dark half and become refilled in the bright half. When days pass on gradually Devas drink the moon for half a month until the new moon day and go away. On the new moon day Pitrs resort to the Moon. When the fifteenth part of the digits is left over in the later part of the day, that part is used up by the groups of Pitrs. The remaining digit is drunk by Pitrs during the period of two Kalas. From the lunar rays the nectar of Svadha comes out on the new moon night. They drink the nectar and remain content for a month. They attain immortality.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 126.53-60 “…in the dark fortnight, the Moon wanes daily from the second day till the Chaturdasi tithi (the fourteenth day after the full Moon) when the Devas drink up the soft and excellent nectar of the Moon, sweet like honey and consisting of the essence of the watery juice. For half the month the nectar becomes stored up in the Moon by the Sun’s ray, so that the Devas would be able to drink it; and the quantity of this nectar becomes maximum on the full moon night when the Devas adore the Moon for another supply of the same, gathered from the Sun’s radiance in course of a fortnight.” Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, Edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 126.61-70 “…From the beginning of the dark fortnight the Moon turns black, wanes and becomes dull; His digits decline owing to His nectar being drunk up day by day. 33330 Devas drink the lunar ambrosia. The Moon thus declines during the dark fortnight and waxes until He becomes complete in the bright fortnight. Thus, drinking the nectar, the Devas, at the end of the fortnight, go away elsewhere on the Amasvasya (dark) night when the Pitris come to Him. When the still small portion of the 15th part of the Moon is left, they drink that in the afternoon on the next day for a brief period of two kalas and go away after the completion of this dark fortnight…” Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, Edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 2.12.1-9 “The radiant sun supplies the moon, when reduced by the draughts of the gods to a single Kalá, with a single ray; and in the same proportion as the ruler of the night was exhausted by the celestials, it is replenished by the sun, the plunderer of the waters: for the gods, Maitreya, drink the nectar and ambrosia accumulated in the moon during half the month, and from this being their food they are immortal. Thirty-six thousand three hundred and thirty-three divinities drink the lunar ambrosia. When two digits remain, the moon enters the orbit of the sun, and abides in the ray called Amá; whence the period is termed Amávásya. In that orbit the moon is immersed for a day and night in the water; thence it enters the branches and shoots of the trees; and thence goes to the sun.” Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>

<p>Vayu Purana I.53.61-62 “…The diameter of the Sun is nine thousand Yojanas. The girth of the Sun is three times its diameter. The width of the Moon is twice that of the Sun.”Tr. G.V. Tagare, Edited by G.P Bhatt</p>

<p>Matsya Purana 123.57-58 “The diameter of the Sun is nine thousand yojanas and its circumference is three times that (2700 yojanas). The diameter of the Moon is twice the diameter of the Sun; its circumference is thrice its diameter.” Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, edited by B.D. Basu</p>

<p>Another scientific blunder, there is no need to provide proof but still for your ease let me present the size of the sun and moon as per science,</p>
<p>Size of the Sun</p>
<p>“The sun is nearly a perfect sphere. Its equatorial diameter and its polar diameter differ by only 6.2 miles (10 km). The mean radius of the sun is 432,450 miles (696,000 kilometers), which makes its diameter about 864,938 miles (1.392 million km). You could line up 109 Earths across the face of the sun. The sun’s circumference is about 2,713,406 miles (4,366,813 km).”</p>

<p>Size of the Moon</p>
<p>“The moon’s mean radius is 1,079.6 miles (1,737.5 kilometers). Double those figures to get its diameter: 2,159.2 miles<br />
(3,475 km). The moon’s equatorial circumference is 6,783.5 miles (10,917 km).</p>
<p>The moon’s surface area is about 14.6 million square miles (38 million square kilometers), which is less than the total surface area of the continent of Asia (17.2 million sq mi or 44.5 million sq km).”</p>

<p>Both the Sun and the Moon revolves around the Earth as per Hinduism and since the moon appears bigger to the naked eye than the sun so the Rishis may have thought that moon must be bigger in size than the sun.</p>
<p>Swami Prabhupada the founder of ISKCON stated that moon is farther than the sun and also considered moon landing to be an hoax,</p>
<p>“Another my challenge is that moon is beyond the sun. First planet is sun, and then moon. So if the sun is 93,000,000 miles and moon is above the sun 1,600,000, then how they can go to the moon planet in four days? It requires seven and a half months. That is my challenge.”<br />

<p>Size of the Earth,</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana I.2.21.12 “…The entire Earth is remembered as fifty crores (of Yojanas) in extent.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 2.4.18 “…Such, Maitreya, is the earth, which with its continents, mountains, oceans, and exterior shell, is fifty crores (five hundred millions) of Yojanas in extent…” Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>500000000*8 = 4000000000 miles</p>
<p>And this number is nowhere close to the number proved by modern science, this number doesn’t match with either Earth’s radius or diameter.</p>
<p>“The radius of Earth at the equator is 3,963 miles (6,378 kilometers), according to NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center. However, Earth is not quite a sphere. The planet’s rotation causes it to bulge at the equator. Earth’s polar radius is 3,949 miles (6,356 km) — a difference of 14 miles (22 km).</p>
<p>Using those measurements, the equatorial circumference of Earth is about 24,900 miles (40,070 km). However, from pole-to-pole — the meridional circumference — Earth is only 24,812 miles (39,931 km) around. This shape, caused by the flattening at the poles, is called an oblate spheroid.”<br />

<p>Brahmanda Purana I.2.21.69 “The circumference of the sun is estimated to be nine crores of Yojanas as well as fortyfive hundred thousands (i.e. 9,45,00000 Yojanas).” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana I.2.21.7 “The extent of the disc of the sun is nine thousand Yojanas. Its girth is three times the extent.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>The same book gives contradictory numbers, let’s evaluate both numbers,</p>
<p>9 crores of Yojanas is the circumference of the Sun as per Brahmana Purana,</p>
<p>90,000,000*8= 720,000,000 miles</p>
<p>9,45,00000*8= 756,000,000 miles</p>
<p>As per the second verse,</p>

<p>Size of Venus, Jupiter, Mars and Saturn. The size is given in ratios and not Yojanas and one can easily find the error in this when it says that Jupiter is less than Venus when Jupiter is the biggest planet of our solar system,</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana I.2.23.104-6; Matsya Purana 128.64-65 “The diameter and extent of the sphere of Bhargava (the Venus) it laid down as one sixteenth of that of the moon. Brhaspati (the Jupiter) should be known as one-fourth less than the Venus (i.e. three fourth of its size). The Mars and Saturn are remembered to be three fourths of Jupiter in extent. In diameter and extent, Mercury is three-fourths of either of them.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>The mean radius of moon in kilometres is 1737 divided by 16 is 108 kilometres, so Brahmanda and Matsya Purana are saying that the mean radius of Venus is 108 km when the actual mean radius of Venus is much bigger than the moon, the mean radius of Venus is 6051 km. Linga Purana gives different sizes of planets, I will just present the verse to you.</p>
<p>Linga Purana I.57.13-15 “The diameter, the circumference and the distance in yojanas of Bhargava (Venus) is a sixteenth part of that of the moon. Brhaspati (Jupiter) is of three-fourths of the size of Venus. Mars and Saturn are three-fourths of the size of Brhaspati. Budha (Mercury) is three-fourths of their size in extent and circumference.” Tr. Board of Scholars, Edited by J.L. Shastri</p>

<p>Swami Prabhupada the founder of ISKCON writes on the next verse i.e., 13<sup>th</sup> verse,</p>
<p>“From the descriptions in this verse, we can make an educated guess about the nature of the flames on the moon. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><u>Like the sun, the moon must also be full of flames because without flames there cannot be illumination</u></span>. The flames on the moon, however, unlike those on the sun, must be mild and pleasing. This is our conviction. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><u>The modern theory that the moon is full of dust is not accepted in the verses of Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</u></span>. In regard to this verse, Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura says, suśaṣpāṇi sukomala-śikhās teṣāṁ rociṣā: the kuśa grass illuminates all directions, but its flames are very mild and pleasing. This gives some idea of the flames existing on the moon.” Swami Prabhupada on Srimad Bhagavatam 5.20.13<br />

<h1><a id="post-6594-22"></a>What causes hoarfrost/dew drops?</h1>
<p>Hinduism says that four elephants of the four quarters spraying water from their huge trunks causes hoarfrost. Or it may be referring to a cloud who could take shape of any. But I am sure that it talks about the elephants that’s holding up the earth because the 43rd verse states that “Elephants, mountains and clouds along with serpents belong to one and the same family” had it been a type of cloud then this verse wouldn’t have separated elephants from clouds and also the Brahmanda Purana makes it more clear.</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.51.45-47 “During Hemanta (early winter) Parjanya and the elephants of the quarters born of chilliness shower snow (drops) for making the corn flourish…The elephants of the quarters spray all round drops of water from the Ganga by means of their huge trunks. That (spray of water) is called the hoarfrost.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 2.9.16-18 “…the water, although that of the Gangá of the sky, is scattered, by the elephants of the quarters, not by the rays of the sun: it is only when such rain falls, and the sun is in the even asterisms, that it is distributed by his beams.” Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana I.2.22.47-52a “Smoke is conducive to development of all of them without any distinction. The most excellent among them is Parjanya. The Elephants of the quarters are four in number (Although) these are separate, the source of origin of elephants, mountains, clouds and serpents is the same and water is remembered as that origin. On being directed to make the plants and trees flourish, Parjanya and the Diggajas (Elephants of the quarters) showers snowdrops during Hemanta (early winter), born of cool virility. …With their huge trunks, the elephants of the quarters receive the waters oozing from the Ganga and scatter them in the form of water spray. That is remembered as dew drops.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>

<h1><a id="post-6594-23"></a>Sun emits different types of rays which are responsible for changes in Season</h1>
<p>As the Earth spins on its axis, producing night and day, it also moves about the Sun in an elliptical (elongated circle) orbit that requires 365 1/4 days to complete. The Earth’s axis is tilted at 23.5 degrees and is why we have seasons. When the Earth’s axis points towards the Sun, it is summer for that hemisphere. When the Earth’s axis points away, winter can be expected.</p>
<p>But according to Vedic Science we have seasons because the sun emits different types and specific number of rays and changes them to cause different seasons.</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana 1.2.24.32-33 “During Vasanta (spring) and Grisma (summer), the sun blazes by means of three hundred rays. During the rainy season and autumn he showers (rain) by means of four hundred rays. During Hemanta (early winter) and Sisira (later winter), he scatters snow by means of three hundred rays.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Linga Purana I.59.41-45 “…The thousand rays of the sun serve the purpose of the world. Reaching the earth they assume different forms by emitting snow, rain and heat…” Tr. Board of Scholars, Edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.52.36 “In accordance with the seasons, the Sun changes his rays, releasing heat in the summer, mist and fog in the winter and rain during the rainy season and demarcates day and night. He (thus) propitiates Devas, Pitrs and human beings.” Tr. G.V. Tagare, Edited by G.P Bhatt</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.53.25-27; Linga Purana I.59.31a-31b “During the spring and the summer he blazes with the three hundred rays. During rains and autumn he generates rain by the four (hundred rays). The Sun creates mist and fog by means of the three (hundred rays) during early and late winter. He deposits energy on the medicinal herbs. By means of Svadha he propitiates Pitrs. By means of nectar of three varieties he bestows immorality. Thus thousand rays of the Sun achieve the purpose of the worlds. They differ according to the season by exuding water, chilliness and heat.” Tr. G.V. Tagare, Edited by G.P Bhatt</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 128.24-25 “During spring and hot weather the sun imparts heat by his three hundred rays; during the rainy season and autumn causes rain by his four hundred rays; during the dewy and winter season imparts cold by his three hundred rays.” Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, Edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana also says that Sun moves in medium speed to make day and night equal in Autumn and Spring seasons,</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana I.2.21.142 “During the time in between the Autumn and the Spring, the sun proceeds with a medium speed and he resorts to its eastern peak.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>

<h1><a id="post-6594-24"></a>Moon causes rain</h1>
<p>Hindu scriptures correctly says that the sun takes up the water through rays but also makes an unscientific claim that the water is transferred to moon which then sends it to clouds (perhaps to Abhra clouds) that causes rain, some also say that the cloud named Abhra doesn’t cause rainfall while Linga Purana I.54.39-40 states that Abhra means ‘that which showers water’.</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana I.2.22.13-21 “…the sun takes away the water of the entire world, O excellent Brahmanas. The moon transmits the entire water drunk by the sun. The torrential currents of water (Downpour of rain) functions through Nadis (vein like vessels) accompanied by the wind. The water that oozes out of the moon remains in the food (i.e. plants and food crops). The water that has fallen down from the moon, from the sky, is conducive to the welfare of all the worlds. The entire universe has the moon as its support. This has been truthfully recounted. The Usna (hot virility) oozes out of the sun, and the Sita (chill virility) functions from the moon.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Linga Purana Section I.54.29-33 “The waters drunk by the sun penetrates the moon gradually and from the moon they drip down to the clouds. On being tossed about by the wind, the cluster of clouds causes shower on the earth…” Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.51.14-15 “The water drunk in by the sun gets transferred to the moon from the solar fire. Through the Nadis (tubular veins) full of wind the activity of sustaining the worlds begins. What exudes from the moon, the sun receives at its tips. When the wind blows the clouds let it shower on the earth.” Tr. G.V. Tagare, Edited by G.P Bhatt</p>
<p>Aitareya Brahmana Book 8, Para 28 “…The rain having rained enters into the moon…” Tr. Arthur Berriedale Keith</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 2.9.8-18 “…The sun with his scorching rays absorbs the moisture of the earth, and with them nourishes the moon. The moon communicates, through tubes of air, its dews to the clouds, which, being composed of smoke, fire, and wind (or vapour), can retain the waters with which they are charged: they are therefore called Abhras, because their contents are not dispersed When however they are broken to pieces by the wind, then watery stores descend, bland, and freed front every impurity by the sweetening process of time…” Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Linga Purana mentions strange water cycle,</p>
<p>Linga Purana I.54.65-68 “There is neither increase nor decrease of water, if we consider it duly. The wind presided over by Dhruva withdraws the rain. It falls off the planet sun and spreads through the sphere of the stars. At the close of the movement, it re-enters the sun and is presided over by Dhruva.” Tr. Board of Scholars, Edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Dhurva means Pole Star.</p>

<h1><a id="post-6594-25"></a>Unique way to cause rain</h1>
<p>A Hindu MP of India was ridiculed for saying that <a href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/smoke-from-yajna-goes-up-rainfall-comes-down-bjp-mps-formula-to-check-drought/1/666277.html" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Smoke from Yajna goes up, rainfall comes down<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. But what people may not be knowing is that he said this on the basis of Hindu scriptures, so those making fun of this statement should also make fun of Hindu scriptures which promotes such unscientific things,</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 2.16 “We perform the yajna for Vasus, Rudras and Adityas…The desired oblation (Ahuti) reaches the space, comes in contact with air and the light of that sun. It thence brings down rain for us…” Tr. Devi Chand</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 3.49 “The oblation full of cooked articles put into the fire, goes up to the sky. And returns there from full of rain.” Tr. Devi Chand</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 3.76. An oblation duly thrown into the fire, reaches the sun; from the sun comes rain, from rain food, therefrom the living creatures (derive their subsistence).</p>
<p>Maitrayana Brahmana 6.37 … ‘The oblation which is properly thrown on the fire, goes toward the sun; from the sun comes rain…”</p>

<h1><a id="post-6594-26"></a>What causes Earthquakes and who lifts the Earth?</h1>
<p>Valmiki Ramayana says that four elephants are holding up the earth and if the easterly elephant namely Viruupaaksha moves its trunk then earthquakes occurs on earth,</p>
<p>Valmiki Ramayana 1.40.13-22 “While digging the earth there they beheld a mountain similar easterly elephant named Viruupaaksha, which is bearing the eastern side of earth’s surface on its head. Oh, Rama, the legatee of Raghu, that great easterly elephant Viruupaaksha is bearing the entire eastern earth along with its mountains and forests on its head. On certain occasions, oh, Rama of Kakutstha, when that great-elephant moves its head desiring respite in tiresomeness then earthquakes will occur on earth. After splitting the eastern direction then they split opened the southern direction, and even in southern direction they beheld an elephant that is similar to a very great mountain, and that is sustaining southerly side of earth on its head, and on seeing that mammoth elephant of venerable character, namely Mahapadma, they went into an inordinate astonishment. Even in the westerly direction those great mighty sons of Sagara beheld an infinite and mountain similar elephant of western direction, called Sumanasa. In the northern direction, oh, Rama, they beheld Bhadra, a snow-white elephant with an auspicious body bearing northern side of this earth.” Tr. Shri Desiraju Hanumanta Rao</p>
<p>6th century Indian astronomer named Varahamihira also writes about this,</p>
<p>क्षितिकंम्पमाहुरेके बृहदन्तर्जलनिवासिसत्वकृतम् ।<br />
भूभारखिन्नदिग्गजविश्रामसमुद्भवं चान्ये ॥१॥<br />
Brihatsamhita 32.1 “Some hold that an earth-quake is caused by huge animals living in the midst of the ocean, while others opine that it is the result of the rest that is availed of by the elephants of the quarters tired by the weight of the earth.” Tr. Panditbhushan V. Subrahmanya Shastri &amp; Vidwan M. Ramkrishna Bhat</p>
<p>I quoted it to show that elephants holding up the earth is literal and not simile and this view was widely held by Hindus even in the 6th century. Vishnu Purana says that Vishnu in the form of a snake named Shesha is holding up the world and the earth trembles if he yawns,</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 2.5.20-25 “…Śesha bears the entire world, like a diadem, upon his head, and he is the foundation on which the seven Pátálas rest. His power, his glory, his form, his nature, cannot be described, cannot he comprehended by the gods themselves. Who shall recount his might, who wears this whole earth, like a garland of flowers, tinged of a purple dye by the radiance of the jewels of his crests. When Ananta, his eyes rolling with intoxication, yawns, then earth, with all her woods, and mountains, and seas, and rivers, trembles…” Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Shiva Purana says that earthquakes occurs when Shesha stretches himself,<br />
Shiva Purana, Uma Samhita 5, chapter 15, verses 18-21 “Holding the sphere of the earth on his back, Sesa, the lord of Bhutas stands at the root of Patala. He is worshipped for his endless attributes. The power of his virility cannot be adequately described even by the ambitious gods nor can his form be known…With his eyes rolling due to inebriation when Sesa stretches himself, the earth quakes along with all its mountains, oceans and forests.” Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam and Devi Bhagavatam also says that four elephants are holding up the universe,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 5.20.39 “On the top of Lokāloka Mountain are the four gaja-patis, the best of elephants, which were established in the four directions by Lord Brahmā, the supreme spiritual master of the entire universe. The names of those elephants are Ṛṣabha, Puṣkaracūḍa, Vāmana and Aparājita. They are responsible for maintaining the planetary systems of the universe.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 8.14.1-29 “…The self-born Brahmâ has placed very big elephants on all sides of it. Hear their names. These are Risabha, Puspachûda, Vâmana, and Aparâjita. These four elephants are said to hold all the Lokas in their respective positions. The Bhagavân Hari gives strength to these elephants and to Indra and others who are reckoned to be His Vibhûtis (powers)…” Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam also says that Vishnu in the form of a dolphin or Gigantic porpoise is holding up the universe or earth,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 5.23.4 “Some persons describe this system of heavenly luminaries as being supported by the mystical Yogic powers of Lord Vasudeva who has assumed the form of a Gangetic porpoise.” Tr. G.V. Tagare, Edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Mahabharata and Puranas says that a snake named Shesha is holding up the Earth and that’s the reason snakes are found in the ground,</p>
<p>Mahabharata 3.202.12-13 “…then lay in Yoga sleep on the wide hood of the Snake Sesha of immeasurable energy, and the Creator of the Universe, that highly-blessed and holy Hari, knowing no deterioration, lay on the hood of that Snake encircling the whole Earth…” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 5.25.2 “Śukadeva Gosvāmī continued: This great universe, situated on one of Lord Anantadeva’s thousands of hoods, appears just like a white mustard seed. It is infinitesimal compared to the hood of Lord Ananta.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Mahabharata describes how Adishesha held the earth, I am quoting some excerpts from the section,</p>
<p>Mahabharata1.36.17-25 “Then Sesha replied, ‘O divine Grandsire, this is the boon desired by me; viz., may my heart always delight in virtue and in blessed ascetic penances, O Lord of all!’ Brahman said, ‘O Sesha, I am exceedingly gratified with this thy self-denial and love of peace. But, at my command, let this act be done by thee for the good of my creatures. Bear thou, O Sesha, properly and well this Earth so unsteady with her mountains and forests, her seas and towns and retreats, so that she may be steady.’ Sesha said, ‘O divine Lord of all creatures, O bestower of boons, O lord of the Earth, lord of every created thing, lord of the universe, I will, even as thou sayest hold the Earth steady. Therefore, O lord of all creatures, place her on my head.’ Brahman said, ‘O best of snakes, go underneath the Earth. She will herself give thee a crevice to pass through. And, O Sesha, by holding the Earth, thou shalt certainly do what is prized by me very greatly…Then the elder brother of the king of the snakes, entering a hole, passed to the other side of the Earth, and holding her, supported with his head that goddess with her belt of seas passing all round.’ Brahman said, ‘O Sesha, O best of snakes, thou art the god Dharma, because alone, with thy huge body, thou supportest the Earth with everything on her, even as I myself, or Valavit (Indra), can…The snake, Sesha, the lord Ananta, of great prowess, lives underneath the Earth, alone supporting the world at the command of Brahman. And the illustrious Grandsire, the best of the immortals, then gave unto Ananta the bird of fair feathers, viz., the son of Vinata, for Ananta’s help.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Swami Prabhupada wrote,</p>
<p>“The incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead known as Śeṣa or Ananta has unlimited strength, fame, wealth, knowledge, beauty and renunciation. As described in this verse, Ananta’s strength is so great that the innumerable universes rest on His hoods. He has the bodily features of a snake with thousands of hoods, and since His strength is unlimited, all the universes resting on His hoods feel no heavier than mustard seeds. We can just imagine how insignificant a mustard seed is on the hood of a serpent. In this connection, the reader is referred to Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta, Ādi-līlā, Chapter Five, verses 117-125. There it is stated that Lord Viṣṇu’s incarnation as the serpentine Ananta Śeṣa Nāga supports all the universes on His hoods. By our calculation, a universe may be very, very heavy, but because the Lord is ananta (unlimited), He feels the weight to be no heavier than a mustard seed.” <strong>Swami Prabhupada 5.17.21</strong> <a href="https://www.vedabase.com/en/sb/5/17/21" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">https://www.vedabase.com/en/sb/5/17/21<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>Vishnu Purana book 2, chapter 5 states that Sesha is a form of Vishnu but Mahabharata says that Sesha is a form of Shiva,</p>
<p>Mahabharata 13.14.151 “…Mahadeva is the soul of all creatures. He pervades all things. He is the speaker of all discourses (on duties and rituals)…He it is that assumes the form of Sesha who sustains the world on his head…”</p>
<p>It’s not just elephant, snake or dolphin that is holding up the earth, Hindu scriptures also says that Vishnu in the form of a boar is holding up the earth and also saving it from sinking in waters. The following topic is also related to this one.</p>
<p><a href="#top">top</a></p>

<h1><a id="post-6594-27"></a>Earth established on waters</h1>

<p>Scientists are spending billions of dollars to find water on other planets but Vishnu’s avatar Varaha found water below the earth some 3000 years ago and also saved the earth from sinking into that water. The story of Varaha lifting up the earth in Puranas may have taken inspiration from Brahmanas,</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana 14:1:2:11 “Then (earth) torn up by a boar (he takes), with (Vâg. S. XXXVII, 5), &#8216;Only thus large was she in the beginning,&#8217;&#8211;for, indeed, only so large was this earth in the beginning, of the size of a span. A boar, called Emûsha, raised her up, and he was her lord Pragâpati: with that mate, his heart&#8217;s delight, he thus supplies and completes him 1;&#8211;&#8216;may I this day compass for you Makha&#8217;s head on the Earth&#8217;s place of divine worship: for Makha thee! for Makha&#8217;s head thee!&#8217; the import of this is the same as before.” Tr. Julius Eggeling</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, VayaviyaSamhita 7, Section I.11.31 “The he lifted the Earth sunk under water and held it on his curved fangs. He rose up from the nether worlds.” Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Harivamsha Purana 3.35.1 “(O janamejaya!) The earth which was installed on the top surface of the water body, did not sink, like a huge ship, due to its vast body.” Tr. Desiraju Hanumant Rao</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.50.7 “Waters lie within the earth and the earth is established over waters. The sky is above, the earth is below (it) and again waters are underneath.” Tr. G.V. Tagare, Edited by G.P Bhatt</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana I.I.5.10 On seeing that the earth had sunk into the water he thought- ”What form shall I assume and uplift the earth?”[15] Assuming this inimitable form of a boar, Hari entered the nether worlds for uplifting the earth.</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 3.13.31 “Lord Boar very easily took the earth on His tusks and got it out of the water. Thus He appeared very splendid. Then, His anger glowing like the Sudarśana wheel, He immediately killed the demon [Hiraṇyākṣa], although he tried to fight with the Lord.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 8.2.34-38 “…He came up from the Rasâtala and placed the earth on the waters. He then went away to His Vaikuntha abode…” Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 8.2.11-20 “The ocean was very much agitated with the fierce striking of the hairs of the Boar, when He entered into the waters, and spoke thus :– “O Deva ! O Thou, the destroyer of the afflictions of your refuges! Protect me.” Hearing the words of the ocean, the God Hari tore asunder all the aquatic animals and went down beneath the waters. Searching violently hither and thither, He knew the earth by her smell. At once the Bhagavân Hari, the Lord of all, went to Her and rescued the earth by raising Her up on his big teeth, the Earth that was the abode of all the beings. When the Bhagavân, the Lord of all the sacrifices, came up with the Earth on the top of His teeth, He looked beautiful like the elephant of a quarter taking out by the root and holding a thousand petalled lotus upon his tusks.” Tr. Swami Vijnananada</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 1.4.45-48 “The supreme being thus eulogized, upholding the earth, raised it quickly, and placed it on the summit of the ocean, where it floats like a mighty vessel, and from its expansive surface does not sink beneath the waters. Then, having levelled the earth, the great eternal deity divided it into portions, by mountains…” Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Harivamsa Purana 1.40.6 “We have heard that sage Krishna-dwaipAyana described this great boar incarnation before the twice-born ones when they assembled at a sacrifice, and detailed as to how that enemy-eradicator, Vishnu, incarnating himself as a boar, saved the earth sunk in the ocean with his tusks; now I would like to hear at length the various deeds performed by the intelligent slayer of enemies hari in his incarnation of boar.” Tr. Desiraju Hanumanta Rao</p>
<p>I remember, when I had posted a meme on my Facebook account about Varaha lifting up the Earth from waters, a Hindu tried to explain it by saying that the water mentioned in Purana is not actually water and later gave a lame explanation. Those who try to give “water” a metaphorical meaning should read following verses which refutes their claim,</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.6.10-27 ”Observing that the earth was overflowed with waters on all sides, (he thought to himself), ”Oh, what great form should I assume and uplift the earth”? He thought of the form of a Boar charmingly comfortable in sporting about in waters…It had a girth of ten and a height of a hundred Yojanas. It resembled a dark blue cloud in complexion. It grunted like the rumbling of thunder-clouds…Assuming this large immeasurable form of a boar, Visnu entered the nether regions in order to lift up the earth…. [25-27] Holding the Earth in his hands he brought it to its place. The supporter of the Earth at first mentally supported the earth and then released it. Over the flood of waters, the Earth floated like an immense boat. Due to the activities of the lord, it did not sink. With a desire to set up the universe, the lord lifted up the Earth. Then, he, the lotus-eyed lord, decided to divide the Earth. He levelled the Earth and created the mountains on it.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>

<h1><a id="post-6594-28"></a>Distance between Planets</h1>
<p>Brahma Purana 21.5-9 “O brahmins, the disc of the sun is stationed a hundred thousand Yojanas away from the earth. The disc of the moon is stationed a hundred thousand Yojanas away from the sun. Full hundred thousand Yojanas above the moon, the entire sphere of the stars shines. O brahmins, mercury (Budha) is two hundred thousand Yojanas above the sphere of stars…Saturn (Sauri) is stationed two hundred thousand Yojanas above Jupiter…” Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>The above verse says that the sun is a hundred thousand Yojanas away from the earth, so let’s do the calculation now,</p>
<p>1 Yojana = 8 miles</p>
<p>100,000*8= 800,000 miles</p>
<p>Distance between Earth and the Sun as per science</p>

<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 5.22.8 “Similarly the Moon is observed to be a hundred thousand Yojanas above the rays (orb) of the Sun. As it is faster in velocity (than the sun), it goes ahead (of the Sun). It covers in two fortnights the circuit made by the Sun in one (complete) year; in two days and a quarter of that distance which the Sun traverses in a month; and in one day the distance the Sun requires a fortnight to cover.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>The distance between Moon and Sun mentioned in Srimad Bhagavatam is same as mentioned in Brahma Purana 21.5-9, so now let’s calculate the distance,</p>
<p>100,000*8= 800,000 miles</p>
<p>“The moon is 93205678.8356 miles away from the sun which is 150 million kilometres.”<br />

<p>Distance between Planets,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 5.22.14-17 “Situated 1,600,000 miles above Mercury, or 8,800,000 miles above earth, is the planet Mars. If this planet does not travel in a crooked way, it crosses through each sign of the zodiac in three fortnights and in this way travels through all twelve, one after another. It almost always creates unfavorable conditions in respect to rainfall and other influences. Situated 1,600,000 miles above Mars, or 10,400,000 miles above earth, is the planet Jupiter, which travels through one sign of the zodiac within the period of a Parivatsara. If its movement is not curved, the planet Jupiter is very favorable to the brāhmaṇas of the universe. Situated 1,600,000 miles above Jupiter, or 12,000,000 miles above earth, is the planet Saturn, which passes through one sign of the zodiac in thirty months and covers the entire zodiac circle in thirty Anuvatsaras. This planet is always very inauspicious for the universal situation. Situated 8,800,000 miles above Saturn, or 20,800,000 miles above earth, are the seven saintly sages, who are always thinking of the well-being of the inhabitants of the universe. They circumambulate the supreme abode of Lord Viṣṇu, known as Dhruvaloka, the polestar.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Above verse says that Mercury is 1,600,000 miles above Mars while according to science, The distance between Mercury and Mars is 1.14 AU. That’s approximately 170,030,000 km or 105,651,744 miles. It also says that Earth is 8,800,000 miles away from Mars while Earth is 0.52 AU away from Mars. That’s approximately 78,340,000 km or 48,678,219 miles.<br />

<p>It also makes the claim that “Situated 1,600,000 miles above Mars, or 10,400,000 miles above earth, is the planet Jupiter”</p>
<p>While as per science the distance between Mars and Jupiter is 3.68 AU. That’s approximately 550,390,000 km or 342,012,346 miles. And the distance between Earth and Jupiter is 4.2 AU. That’s approximately 628,730,000 km or 390,674,710 miles.<br />

<p>It then makes claim that “Situated 1,600,000 miles above Jupiter, or 12,000,000 miles above earth, is the planet Saturn”</p>
<p>While the fact is, The distance between Saturn and Jupiter is 4.32 AU. That’s approximately 646,270,000 km or 401,592,178 miles and the distance between Saturn and Earth is 8.52 AU. That’s approximately 1,275,000,000 km or 792,248,270 miles.</p>

<p>Following verses from Srimad Bhagavatam 5.22.12-13 are related to this subject. It makes the claim that Mercury is 1,600,000 miles above Venus or 7,200,000 miles above earth. While the distance between Mercury and Venus is 0.34 AU. That’s approximately 50,290,000 km or 31,248,757 miles. And the distance between Mercury and Earth is 0.61 AU. That’s approximately 91,691,000 km or 56,974,146 miles.<br />

<h1><a id="post-6594-29"></a>Sun, Venus and Mercury has same Orbits</h1>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 5.22.12 “Some 1,600,000 miles above this group of stars is the planet Venus, which moves at almost exactly the same pace as the sun according to swift, slow and moderate movements. Sometimes Venus moves behind the sun, sometimes in front of the sun and sometimes along with it. Venus nullifies the influence of planets that are obstacles to rainfall. Consequently its presence causes rainfall, and it is therefore considered very favorable for all living beings within this universe. This has been accepted by learned scholars.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 5.22.13 “Mercury is described to be similar to Venus, in that it moves sometimes behind the sun, sometimes in front of the sun and sometimes along with it. It is 1,600,000 miles above Venus, or 7,200,000 miles above earth. Mercury, which is the son of the moon, is almost always very auspicious for the inhabitants of the universe, but when it does not move along with the sun, it forbodes cyclones, dust, irregular rainfall, and waterless clouds. In this way it creates fearful conditions due to inadequate or excessive rainfall.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>

<h1><a id="post-6594-31"></a>Planets move propelled by the rope of wind</h1>
<p>Hinduism says that planets move due to wind as Hinduism believes that there is air in space,</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 128.14 “All these stars are tied to Dhruva: and they move on propelled by the wind. The Moon and the Sun move on in the celestial firmament, prompted by currents of strong wind. They glide on tied to the Dhruva. Their motions round the pole are brought about by these ropes made of wind.” Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, Edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>Linga Purana I.57.7 “The stars and the luminaries, urged by the circular gusts of wind, move like fire brands. Since the wind bears the luminaries, it is called Pravaha.” Tr. Board of Scholars, Edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p><a href="#top">top</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1><a id="post-6594-32"></a>Wind stars from Sun</h1>
<p>Vayu Purana I.51.53 “The wind starts from the planet sun and traverses the entire stellar zone. At the end of the day it enters the sun encompassed by Dhruva.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>

<h1><a id="post-6594-33"></a>Sun and Moon dipping in water</h1>
<p>Vamana Purana 16.53 “Burnt by the fire of the eyes of Siva, the restless Surya immersed in the Asi and reaching Varuna, he had a dip in it as freely as he like.” Tr. Ananda Swarup Gupta</p>
<p>Rig Veda 7.55.7, Atharva Veda 4.5.1 The Bull [Vushab/Sun] who hath a thousand horns, who rises up from out the sea…</p>
<p>Kausitaki Brahmana 18.9 Him who yonder gives heat they seek by these pressings to obtain; the rising by the morning pressing, (the sun) in the middle (of his course) by the midday pressing, (the sun) as he sets by the third pressing. He, having entered the waters, becomes Varuna.</p>
<p>Aitareya Brahma Book 4, Chapter 20, verse 13 “…This (Aditya, the sun) is ‘the swan sitting in light’…he is ‘born from the waters’ (abja), for in the morning he comes out of the waters, and in the evening he enters the waters.” Tr. Martin Haug</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 2.12.8-9 “whence the period is termed Amávásya. In that orbit the moon is immersed for a day and night in the water; thence it enters the branches and shoots of the trees; and thence goes to the sun.” Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 13.2.4 “Victorious, inspired, and brightly shining, whom seven strong tawny-coloured coursers carry, Whom Atri lifted from the flood to heaven, thus men behold thee as thy course thou runnest.” Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.72.7 “When, O ye Gods, like Yatis, ye caused all existing things to grow, Then ye brought Sūrya forward who was lying hidden in the sea.” Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>Hinduism also says that the sun enters fire while setting, I don’t understand this verse so I leave it to the readers to understand it.</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.50.112-3 “When the sun sets, the brilliance of the sun partially enters fire. Hence fire shines more brilliantly at night, even from a distance. When the sun rises again, the brilliance of fire enters the sun. The sun rises again, the brilliance of fire enters the sun. This together with the brillaince left in the sun at the time of sunset, makes it all the more brilliant. So the sun blazes during the day.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>

<h1><a id="post-6594-34"></a>How Eclipse occurs</h1>
<p>According to Vedic mythology a demon covers the Sun which causes solar eclipse.</p>
<p>Rig Veda 5.40.5-6 O Sūrya, when the Asura’s descendant Svarbhanu, pierced thee through and through with darkness, All creatures looked like one who is bewildered, who knoweth not the place where he is standing. What time thou smotest down Svarbhanu’s magic that spread itself beneath the sky, O Indra, By his fourth sacred prayer Atri disoovered Sūrya concealed in gloom that stayed his function.</p>
<p>Following verses may have taken inspiration from the above Vedic verse. A demon named Rahu which is a star according to Hinduism causes Solar and Lunar eclipses.</p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 8.18.1-9 “…The Asura Râhu thus covers his rays. So the sphere of the Moon extends upto the twelve thousand Yoyanas. Râhu covers the field of the thirteen thousand Yoyanas. So he covers both the Sun and the Moon. Desire to take the vengeance of the previous enmity, he covers them during the time of Parva (the festivals). This planet wants to cover them from a distance. Hearing this, the Bhagavân Visnu hurls His Sudars’an Chakra against Râhu. This Chakra (disc) is encircled with the fiery flames and is very terrible. When all the quarters were filled with its violent flames, Râhu became instantly alarmed and fled away from the distance. O Devarsi! This is known as the eclipse known amongst the mortals…” Tr. Swami Vijananda</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 5.24.1-3 “Śrī Śukadeva Gosvāmī said: My dear King, some historians, the speakers of the Purāṇas, say that 10,000 yojanas [80,000 miles] below the sun is the planet known as Rāhu, which moves like one of the stars. The presiding deity of that planet, who is the son of Siṁhikā, is the most abominable of all asuras, but although he is completely unfit to assume the position of a demigod or planetary deity, he has achieved that position by the grace of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Later I shall speak further about him. Rāhu tried to create dissension between the sun and moon by interposing himself between them. Rāhu is inimical toward both the sun and the moon, and therefore he always tries to cover the sunshine and moonshine on the dark-moon day and full-moon night…After hearing from the sun and moon demigods about Rāhu’s attack, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Viṣṇu, engages His disc, known as the Sudarśana cakra, to protect them. The Sudarśana cakra is the Lord’s most beloved devotee and is favored by the Lord. The intense heat of its effulgence, meant for killing non-Vaiṣṇavas, is unbearable to Rāhu, and he therefore flees in fear of it. During the time Rāhu disturbs the sun or moon, there occurs what people commonly know as an eclipse.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Swami Prabhupada writes on Srimad Bhagavatam 5.24.2-3 “As stated herein, the sun extends for 10,000 yojanas, and the moon extends for twice that, or 20,000 yojanas. The word dvādaśa should be understood to mean twice as much as ten, or twenty. In the opinion of Vijayadhvaja, the extent of Rāhu should be twice that of the moon, or 40,000 yojanas. However to reconcile this apparent contradiction to the text of the Bhāgavatam, Vijayadhvaja cites the following quotation concerning Rāhu; rāhu-soma-ravīṇāṁ tu maṇḍalā dvi-guṇoktitām. This means that Rāhu is twice as large as the moon, which is twice as large as the sun. This is the conclusion of the commentator Vijayadhvaja. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Viṣṇu, is always the protector of His devotees, who are also known as demigods. The controlling demigods are most obedient to Lord Viṣṇu, although they also want material sense enjoyment, and that is why they are called demigods, or almost godly. Although Rāhu attempts to attack both the sun and the moon, they are protected by Lord Viṣṇu. Being very afraid of Lord Viṣṇu’s cakra, Rāhu cannot stay in front of the sun or moon for more than a muhūrta (forty-eight minutes). The phenomenon that occurs when Rāhu blocks the light of the sun or moon is called an eclipse. The attempt of the scientists of this earth to go to the moon is as demoniac as Rāhu’s attack. Of course. their attempts will be failures because no one can enter the moon or sun so easily. Like the attack of Rāhu, such attempts will certainly be failures.” <strong>Swami Prabhupada on Srimad Bhagavatam 5.24.2-3<br />

<h1> How mountains were formed</h1>
<p>Brahmanda Purana 1.2.7.9b-11 &#8220;As the previous creation was being burned formerly by the Samvartaka fire, the mountains of that period had been melted by that fire. They were then scattered by the wind. Due to chillness, they became solidified. Wherever the (molten rocks) were split there arose mountain. They are called Acalas (not-moving or immobile)&#8230;&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Vayu Purana 7- &#8220;On seeing the earth fully engulfed in waters, he entered the waters after assuming the form of a Boar. After lifting up the earth from the waters, he deposited the waters of the oceans in the oceans, of the rivers in the rivers and of the earth on the earth. Then he collected the mountains. When the previous creation was being burnt by the Samvartaka, fire of dissolution, the mountains lay destroyed and (scattered) all over the earth. In that one vast ocean, the (solidified) waters tossed by wind got collected together due to cold. Wherever they were (thus) stuck (heaped) together, there they became immovable. The mountains are called Acalas because they become motionless after being dried up and solidified&#8230;&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare, edited by G.P. Bhatt</p>
<h1>What are the stars?</h1>
<p>Virtuous men become stars,</p>
<p>Black Yajur Veda 5.4.1.3 “…these are the lights of the sky; verily he wins them; the Naksatras are the lights of the doers of good deeds…” Tr. Arthur Berriedale Keith</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana 6:5:4:8 “May the divine women, with unclipped wings, dear to all the gods, bake thee, Aṅgiras-like, O fire-pan, in the lap of the earth!&#8217; for of old the divine women, with unclipped wings, dear to all the gods, did bake it, like Aṅgiras, in the lap of the earth; and with their help he now bakes it. But, surely, these are the stars,&#8211;the women (gani) are indeed the stars, for these are the lights of those righteous men (gana) who go to the celestial world: it is by means of the stars that he thus bakes it.” Tr. Julius Eggeling</p>
<h1><a id="post-6594-37"></a>Sky/Heaven is supported by pillars</h1>
<p>Rig Veda 6.72.2 O lords of resplendence and bliss, you bestow light to the dawns; you upraise the sun with his splendour; you prop up the sky with the supporting pillar of the firmament; you spread out the earth, the mother of all. Tr. Svami Satya Prakash Saraswati</p>
<p>Rig Veda 6.47.5 “This very same exilir of devotional love finds the wavy sea of brilliant colours in fore-front of the dawns, whose dwelling is in firmament. This might exilir sustains the heavens up with a mighty pillar, the sender of rains, the leader of the winds.” Tr. Svami Satya Prakash Saraswati</p>
<p>Rig Veda 8.41.10 “In his successive functions, he emits his bright rays (during day) or turns them dark (during the night). He measures out the eternal abode, and supports with the pillar of the firmament, both heaven and the earth. May all our adversities vanish” Tr. Svami Satya Prakash Saraswati</p>
<p>What supports the Sky?</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana 3.3.4.2. He then makes (the sacrificer) say, after touching (the Soma), ‘The bull hath propped the sky, the welkin.’ For, when the gods were spreading the sacrifice, they were afraid of an attack on the part of the Asura-Rakshas.

<p>Written by Sulaiman Razvi</p>
<p>Meat especially that of cow is the centre of controversy in India. People are lynched and raped on rumours of beef consumption but such mentality didn&#8217;t exist in Vedic period, people in the Vedic period relished beef and meat of other animals. There are clear references in Vedas about meat consumption, but some Hindu scholars don&#8217;t translate it literally despite the fact that it is supported by other Hindu texts. Vedas no-where says that &#8216;You shouldn&#8217;t have meat&#8217;, Hindu scriptures doesn&#8217;t prohibit meat consumption, it&#8217;s only Hindu scholars that prohibits it. In the Vedas the cattle were gifted to other Deities, because it was a source of money during the Vedic period. A historian William Butler writes,</p>
<p>&#8220;The people among whom the Veda were composed, as here introduced to us, had evidently passed the nomadic stage. Their wealth consisted of Horses, Cattle, Sheep, Goats and Buffaloes. Coined money, and indeed money in any shape, was unknown. We meet but two allusions to gold, except for the purpose of ornaments. The cow was to the Vedic Hindu at once food and money.&#8221;<br />

<p>A recent survey found that 70% Indians are non-vegetarians. <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.in/2016/06/18/over-70-indians-are-meat-eaters-but-indian-tv-continues-to-vil/" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">http://www.huffingtonpost.in/2016/06/18/over-70-indians-are-meat-eaters-but-indian-tv-continues-to-vil/<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>While according to BBC report, just 20% of Indians are vegetarians,<br />
&#8220;But new research by US-based anthropologist Balmurli Natrajan and India-based economist Suraj Jacob, points to a heap of evidence that even these are inflated estimations because of &#8220;cultural and political pressures&#8221;. So people under-report eating meat &#8211; particularly beef &#8211; and over-report eating vegetarian food.<br />
Taking all this into account, say the researchers, only about 20% of Indians are actually vegetarian &#8211; much lower than common claims and stereotypes suggest.<br />
Hindus, who make up 80% of the Indian population, are major meat-eaters. Even only a third of the privileged, upper-caste Indians are vegetarian.&#8221;<br />

<p>Despite these facts Hindus views non-vegetarians especially Muslims as demons equivalent to cannibals. Hindu apologists says that veg diet is healthy and non-veg diet is unhealthy but they aren&#8217;t aware of the fact that veg diet doesn&#8217;t provide required amount of nutrients and there are several risks associated with veg diet, vegetarians suffer from B12 deficiency. Vitamin B12 is found in non-veg food and egg is a key source of vitamin B12. You may like to go through the following links,</p>

<p><strong>Hindu Scholars on Meat Consumption</strong></p>
<p>Swami Vivekananda writes that Aryans used to relish beef,</p>
<p>&#8220;There was a time in this very India when, without eating beef, no Brahmin could remain a Brahmin&#8221; The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda, Volume 3 <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Complete_Works_of_Swami_Vivekananda/Volume_3/Lectures_from_Colombo_to_Almora/Reply_to_the_Address_of_Welcome_at_Madura" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Complete_Works_of_Swami_Vivekananda/Volume_3/Lectures_from_Colombo_to_Almora/Reply_to_the_Address_of_Welcome_at_Madura<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>Adishankaracharya writes,</p>
<p>&#8220;Odan&#8217; (rice) mixed with meat is called &#8216;Mansodan&#8217;. On being asked whose meat it should be, he answers &#8216;Uksha&#8217;. &#8216;Uksha&#8217; is used for an ox, which is capable to produce semen. Or the meat should be of a &#8216;Rishabh&#8217;. &#8216;Rishabh&#8217; is a bull more advanced in years than an &#8216;Uksha&#8217;.&#8221; <strong>Adishankaracharya in his commentary on Brihadaranyak Upanishad 6/4/18</strong></p>
<p>Ramanujacharya writes,</p>
<p>&#8220;In the Agnisomiya sacrifice no real harm is caused to the animal victim; for according to the Vedic Texts, the victim —a goat, after abandoning an inferior body, will attain a higher rebirth, with a beautiful body. The Text pertaining to immolation declares: — &#8216;O animal, by this (immolation) you never die, you are not destroyed. You will pass through happy paths to the realm of the gods, where the virtuous, not the sinful reach. May the god Savitar give you a suitable place.&#8217; (Yajñ, 4.6.9.46; Taitt. Br. iii 7.2).<br />
Likewise the attainment of more beautiful bodies by those who die here in this war [which is like a sacrifice] has been declared in the Gita (2.22). Hence, just as a surgeon makes an incision and performs other surgical procedures for the purpose of curing a patient, the immolation of the sacrificial animal in the Agnisomiya and other sacrifices contributes to its welfare.&#8221; <strong>Ramanujaacharya in his commentary on Bhagavad Gita 2.32</strong></p>
<p>If you ask Hindus as to why we shouldn&#8217;t have meat, they give irrational answer, they say &#8216;We should not slaughter animals because animals feel pain&#8217;. This answer is not convincing and is only a shift of logic. Before it was discovered that even Plants have life they used to say &#8216;We should not slaughter animals because they have life&#8217; and now they started this &#8216;Animals feel pain&#8221; issue. Here are some excerpts from Hindu texts which shows how the logic was changed,</p>
<p>Mahabharat Book 13, Section 115 &#8220;… Thou hast said so while discoursing formerly upon the ordinances in respect of Sraddhas. How can meat, however, be procured without slaying a living creature…&#8221; Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Mahabharata Book 13, Section 116 &#8220;…Flesh cannot be had from grass or wood or stone. Unless a living creature is slain, it cannot be had. Hence is the fault in eating flesh&#8230;&#8221; Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Founder of Arya Samaj Swami Dayanand Saraswati writes in his book,</p>
<p>&#8220;It is childish to say that there is no sin in eating meat…for meat cannot be had without killing animals, and it can never be right to hurt or kill animals without an offence.- Satyarth Prakash, Swami Dayanand Saraswati, p.342, Tr. Chiranjiva Bhardwaj.</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 5.48. Meat can never be obtained without injury to living creatures, and injury to sentient beings is detrimental to (the attainment of) heavenly bliss; let him therefore shun (the use of) meat.</p>
<p>These passages doesn&#8217;t say that we shouldn&#8217;t have meat because they feel pain but it says that we should not slaughter animals because they have life, they are living creatures. However these passages shouldn&#8217;t be taken as prohibition for meat consumption because Vedic deities used to consume beef every day, but meat consumption appears occasionally, i.e., for sacrifices in later texts. Manu Smriti 5.48 is explained in Vasistha Dharma Shastra 4.5-8 and Mahabharata 13.116 permits meat consumption on the condition that it is first offered to the gods and Pitrs (ancestors). I have explained those verses from Manu Smriti in this article. Researchers have found that even plants feel pain,</p>
<p>Researchers Have Found That Plants Know They Are Being Eaten<br />

<p>Indian scientist Jagdish Chandra Bose was one of the first scientist to discover that plants feel pain.<br />
<a href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/education/story/jagadish-chandra-bose-proved-plants-have-life/1/664259.html" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">http://indiatoday.intoday.in/education/story/jagadish-chandra-bose-proved-plants-have-life/1/664259.html<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>Doctors say that meat of fish, chicken and egg are very good for health then why should anyone abstain from it? Although it&#8217;s proved that even plants have life and feels pain but if vegan Hindus don&#8217;t eat meat merely because animals feel pain then will they eat egg? Egg doesn&#8217;t feel pain when you make omelette from it or boil it, so will Brahmins eat egg if the issue is all about pain? If the issue is about pain then will they be okay with slaughtering animals after proper anaesthesia is administered?</p>

<h3><a id="post-6065-Buddhism-Jainism"></a>Influence of Buddhism and Jainism on Hinduism</h3>
<p>Hundreds and thousands of animals were slaughtered as per Hindu texts. But animal slaughter became a taboo in Hindu society only after Hinduism was influenced by other religions like Buddhism and Jainism.</p>
<p>Swami Prabhupada the founder of ISKCON writes in the commentary of Bhagwad Purana 1.3.24,</p>
<p>&#8220;…Lord Buddha superficially denied the authority of the Vedas. This rejection of the Vedas by Lord Buddha was adopted in order to save people from the vice of animal-killing as well as to save the poor animals from the slaughtering process of their big brothers who clamor for universal brotherhood, peace, justice and equity. There is no justice when there is animal-killing. Lord Buddha wanted to stop it completely, and therefore his cult of ahimsa was propagated not only in India but also outside the country…&#8221; <strong>Swami Prabhupada on Bhagwad Purana 1.3.24</strong> [ <a href="http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_1.3.24" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_1.3.24<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> ]
<p>So Buddha rejected the authority of Vedas because Vedas sanctions animal slaughter and Hindus of his time sacrificed animals and he wanted them to stop this Vedic practice. Swami Vivekananda is of the same view. He writes,</p>
<p>&#8220;In what way do you see this importance of Buddhism in India today?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;It is obvious and overwhelming. You see India never loses anything; only she takes time to turn everything into bone and muscle. Buddha dealt a blow at animal sacrifice from which India has never recovered; and Buddha said, &#8216;Kill no cows&#8217;, and cow-killing is an impossibility with us.&#8221; <strong>The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda, Volume 5</strong><br />
<a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Complete_Works_of_Swami_Vivekananda/Volume_5/Interviews/Reawakening_Of_Hinduism_On_A_National_Basis" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Complete_Works_of_Swami_Vivekananda/Volume_5/Interviews/Reawakening_Of_Hinduism_On_A_National_Basis<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>Some scholars also say that people during Buddha&#8217;s time misinterpreted Vedas and started slaughtering animals in Vedic Yajnas, so to stop animal slaughter Buddha completely rejected the Vedas and established anti-Vedic philosophy called Buddhism. My question is, if Vedas do not sanction animal slaughter and people only misinterpreted the Vedas then why didn&#8217;t Buddha the avatar of Vishnu (as per Hinduism) revive the Vedas? Why wasn&#8217;t he born as a revivalist who should&#8217;ve correctly interpreted the meaning of the Vedas?</p>
<p>Following verses from Skanda Purana shows that animal slaughter was prevalent in 10<sup>th</sup> century during the reign of Kumarapala,</p>
<p>Skanda Purana III.ii.36.62 &#8220;[Kumarapala said] O Brahmanas, I shall not abide and honour the Royal Charter issued by Rama. I disown the Brahmanas who indulge in violence and kill animals in Yajna. There is no question of my having any respect for and devotion to these killers.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Kumarapala was a 10th century A.D king who had embraced Jainism, This shows that Brahmins were engaged in slaughtering animals in 10th century also. There is a story of another king named Vena who had also embraced Jainism and stopped animal slaughter in Vedic Yajnas,</p>
<p>Padma Purana II.37.32b-42 &#8220;[The sinful one said] I shall tell you another fierce act (mentioned) in the Vedas. When a guest goes (ie. arrives) to the house, a brahmana (kills and) cooks (the flesh of) a goat. (They kill) a horse in a horse- sacrifice, and a bull in a bull sacrifice; a man in human sacrifice and goats in a Vajapeya sacrifice. O great king, a great slaughter of many animals is done at a Rajasuya sacrifice. At a Pundarika sacrifice one would kill (i.e. one kills) an elephant, and at an elephant sacrifice (they kill) an elephant. At the Sautramani sacrifice a beast is seen to be fit for being sacrificed. Thus, O prince, listen how at rites of various forms of killing of beasts of various species is laid down…&#8221; Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p>Buddhism and Jainism were wiped out from India by Hindu kings and scholars probably because of their dominance and confrontation with Hinduism. Animal slaughter in Vedic sacrifices and rituals was often the main topic of debate between Buddhist/Jain and Brahmins where Buddhist/Jains had some valid points against Brahmin beliefs. Vishnu Purana says that demons after embracing Buddhism and Jainism started criticizing animal slaughter sanctioned by the Vedas, One of the main point raised by Buddhist/Jain converts was,</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 3.18.21-30 “The delusions of the false teacher paused not with the conversion of the Daityas to the Jaina and Bauddha heresies, but with various erroneous tenets he prevailed upon others to apostatize, until the whole were led astray, and deserted the doctrines and observances inculcated by the three Vedas. Some then spake evil of the sacred books; some blasphemed the gods; some treated sacrifices and other devotional ceremonies with scorn; and others calumniated the Brahmans. &#8220;The precepts,&#8221; they cried, &#8220;that lead to the injury of animal life (as in sacrifices) are highly reprehensible. To say that casting butter into flame is productive of reward, is mere childishness. If Indra, after having obtained godhead by multiplied rites, is fed upon the wood used as fuel in holy fire, he is lower than a brute, which feeds at least upon leaves. If an animal slaughtered in religious worship is thereby raised to heaven, would it not be expedient for a man who institutes a sacrifice to kill his own father for a victim? If that which is eaten by one at a Śráddha gives satisfaction to another, it must be unnecessary for one who resides at a distance to bring food for presentation in person.&#8221; Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Swami Dayanand Saraswati also writes about this,</p>
<p>&#8220;Eleven arguments in favored by the Charvaka Faith</p>
<p>3.&#8221;If the animal offered as sacrifice goes to heaven, why does not the Yajmana (master of ceremonies) send his parents, etc., to heaven, by killing them by way of sacrifice.&#8221; <strong>Satyarth Prakash, Ch 11, page 508, by Swami Dayanand Saraswati, Tr. Chiranjiva Bhardwaja</strong></p>
<p>Dayanand replies to this argument in the following way,</p>
<p>&#8220;3, 4, 5. The Veda and other Shaastras do not at all sanction animal sacrifice; the practice of offering oblations to the manes of departed ancestors is an invention of priests, because it is opposed to the Vedic and Shaastric teachings and finds sanction only in the Puraana like the Bhagvat. We have, therefore, nothing to say against the refutation of this doctrine.&#8221; <strong>Satyarth Prakash, Ch 11, page 509, by Swami Dayanand Saraswati, Tr. Chiranjiva Bhardwaja</strong></p>
<p>Swami Dayanand Saraswati cleverly tries to get rid of it by saying there is no sanction in Vedas. It&#8217;s true that Shraddha to Pitrs (ancestors) is not mentioned in Vedas but oblation to departed ancestors is mentioned in Shastras and animal slaughter is mentioned in Vedas and supported by other texts like Brahmanas, Puranas so there is no way out but to accept that Vedas permits animal slaughter. All these verses shows that Hindus used to slaughter animals till Buddhism and Jainism became prevalent and also shows that Hinduism was later influenced by these religions and adopted vegetarianism and later on animal slaughter was considered sinful in Hindu society.</p>

<p>Rig Veda 1.162.2-3 What time they bear before the Courser, covered with trappings and with wealth, the grasped oblation, the dappled goat goeth straightforward, bleating, to the place dear to Indra and to Pūṣan. Dear to all Gods, this goat, the share of Pūṣan, is first led forward with the vigorous Courser, while Tvaṣṭar sends him forward with the Charger, acceptable for sacrifice, to glory.</p>

<p>मेष [Mesha] = Ram/Sheep.</p>
<p>पचत [Pachat] = Cooked</p>
<p>Above is Shri Ram Sharma&#8217;s Hindi translation.</p>
<p>Apologist present some verses which according to them prohibits meat consumption but those verses are quoted out of context, those verses have historical context, for instance it&#8217;s mentioned in the Vedas</p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.87.16 The <strong>fiend</strong> [non Aryan, Dasyu, Rakshas, Mleccha] who smears himself with flesh of cattle, with flesh of horses and of human bodies, Who steals the milch-cow&#8217;s milk away, O Agni,-tear off the heads of such with fiery fury.</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 1.16.4 If thou [Foreigners] destroy a cow of ours, a human being, or a steed, We pierce thee with this piece of lead so that thou mayst not slay our men.</p>
<p>These verses refer to the foreigners/Non Aryans [Maleccha, Rakshasa] or enemies of deities of Vedic period, that they should not kill the Aryans, cows or horses OF THE Aryans as Cows and Horses were sources of wealth and horses were also used for warfare, you can have meat of other castes or of foreigners (non Aryans). Who would like their wealth to be destroyed? Just like stealing milk of cow is wrong similarly killing animals belonging to other people is considered sinful in those verses. The verse Rig Veda 10.87.16 also prohibits stealing milk but it doesn&#8217;t mean that you shouldn&#8217;t consume milk, you can have milk after buying it similarly you can have meat after buying meat or animal. There may be some confusion among Hindus whether to eat cow or not but there is hardly any prohibition in Vedas to slaughter bull although Vedas do not prohibit any kind of meat.</p>
<p>Some Hindus might say those verses I mentioned above has historical context but they shouldn&#8217;t be viewed in a context as all verses are eternal and it&#8217;s applicable for all ages. Does that mean you should eat dog&#8217;s intestines when you are in deep distress? Because the Vedas says,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 4.18.13 In deep distress I cooked a dog&#8217;s intestines. Among the Gods I found not one to comfort. My consort I beheld in degradation. The Falcon then brought me the pleasant Soma.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="473" height="105" class="wp-image-6075" src="http://vedkabhed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/http-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-2016-8.png" alt="http://truthabouthinduism.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/112016_1617_meat9.png" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/http-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-2016-8.png 473w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/07/http-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-2016-8-300x67.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 473px) 100vw, 473px" /></p>
<p>This verse has a historical context which I am not going to explain, does that mean you should eat dog&#8217;s intestines when you are anxious?</p>
<p>The reason why it&#8217;s difficult to find verses on meat consumption in the Vedas (from few Hindu translators) is because some Hindu scholars don&#8217;t view the animal sacrifice as literal slaughtering but they view it as charity or symbolic slaughtering. So Hindus should ask their scholars to literally translate the Sanskrit verses on meat consumption and I am sure all their doubts on meat eating will be cleared. Vedic verses clearly uses words like Mamsa (Meat), Pachat (Cook) etc., Which is pretty clear for meat consumption but some Hindu scholars likes to add their own words into it, they give their own meanings.</p>
<p>Some Hindu apologists might say Yajnas does not contain killing, Yajnas are non-violent etc.,  But they cannot deny the fact that the animals which were brought as oblation were thrown into the fire,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.91.14-15 He [Agni/Fire] <strong>in whom</strong> horses, bulls, oxen, and barren cows, and rams, when duly set apart, are <strong>offered up</strong>,- To Agni, Soma-sprinkled, drinker of sweet juice, Disposer, with my heart I bring a fair hymn forth. Into thy [Agni&#8217;s] mouth is poured <strong>the offering</strong>, Agni, as Soma into cup, oil into ladle…</p>

<p>Manu Smriti 3.76 An oblation duly thrown into the fire, reaches the sun; from the sun comes rain, from rain food, therefrom the living creatures (derive their subsistence).</p>
<p>Rig Veda 3.59.5 The great Aditya, to be served with worship, who stirreth men, is gracious to the singer. To Mitra, him most highly to be lauded, offer in fire [the] oblation that he loveth.</p>

<p>Satapatha Brahmana 6.2.1.14 Now when he slaughters those animals, he prepares a home for Agni; for nowhere but in his home does one enjoy himself. But the home means food: it is that he lays down in, front, and when Agni sees that, he turns unto him.</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana 11:7:1:1- He performs the animal sacrifice. Now the animal sacrifice means cattle: thus, when he performs the animal sacrifice (pasubandha, the binding of the animal), it is in order that he may be possessed of cattle…And when he performs the animal sacrifice, he renews his fires, and so, along with the renewal of his fires, does the Sacrificer (renew himself), and along with the Sacrificer his house and cattle. And beneficial to life, indeed, is that redemption of his own self; for whilst he is offering the Sacrificer&#8217;s fires long for flesh; they set their minds on the Sacrificer and harbour designs on him. In other fires people do indeed cook any kind of meat, but these (sacrificial fires) have no desire for any other flesh but this (sacrificial animal), and for him to whom they belong.</p>
<p>Asvalayana Grihya Sutra, IV Adhyaya, 8 Kandika, 25 &#8220;The husks and chaff (of the rice), the tail, the skin, the head, the feet (of the sacrificial animal) he should throw into the fire.</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 20.79 O Agni [Fire], within thy mouth is poured the offering, as Soma into cup, ghee into ladle…</p>

<p>Read Rig Veda 1.162.19 which I have mentioned above which talks about meat balls of horse put into the fire, We can obtain meat balls only after killing the horse, So it is a undeniable fact that animals were killed in the Yajna.  As I said earlier Hindu scholars don&#8217;t view the sacrifice as literal for instance Veda says</p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.104.3 To make thee [Indra] start, a strong true draught I offer to thee, the Bull [as a oblation], O thou whom Bay Steeds carry.</p>
<p>Rig Veda 5.29.8 When thou [Indra] three hundred buffaloes&#8217; flesh hadst eaten, and drunk, as Maghavan, three lakes of Soma, All the Gods raised as &#8217;twere a shout of triumph to Indra praise because he slew the Dragon.</p>
<p>I have given the Hindi translation of Rig Veda 5.29.8 by Pundit Ram Govind Trivedi. Some scholars have skipped the Sanskirt word Maas (Meat/Flesh) in their translation, A Hindu scholar Ram Acharya has translated the verse 5.29.8 as Indra &#8221;ACCEPTED&#8221; the three hundred buffaloes instead of &#8220;Eaten&#8221; he has also omitted the word Maas (Flesh/Meat), even if he just accepted the buffaloes then it means later he ate them because Veda commands Indra and Agni to eat the oblation which they receive,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.116.8 Eat, Indra, <strong>these oblations which approach thee</strong>: be pleased with food made ready and with Soma.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="435" height="108" class="wp-image-6079" src="http://vedkabhed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/http-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-2016-12.png" alt="http://truthabouthinduism.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/112016_1617_meat13.png" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/http-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-2016-12.png 435w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/07/http-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-2016-12-300x74.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 435px) 100vw, 435px" /></p>
<p>Rig Veda 2.1.13-14 The A&#8217;dityas have made thee, Agni, their mouth; the pure (deities) have made thee, Kavi, their tongue: the (gods), the givers of wealth, depend upon thee at sacrifices; they eat the offered oblation through thee [Agni]. All the benignant immortal gods eat the offered oblation through thee, as their mouth: mortals taste the flavour (of all viands) through thee: thou art born pure, the embryo of plants.</p>

<p>Indra, Agni and other gods were commanded to eat the offered oblations, therefore they did consume meat. In Vedas, there are two more verses about bulls brought for sacrifice,</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 9.4.9 …that Brahman gives a thousand who offers up the Bull as his oblation.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="481" height="93" class="wp-image-6082" src="http://vedkabhed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/http-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-2016-15.png" alt="http://truthabouthinduism.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/112016_1617_meat16.png" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/http-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-2016-15.png 481w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/07/http-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-2016-15-300x58.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 481px) 100vw, 481px" /></p>
<p>Atharva Veda 9.4.18 All Gods promote the Brahman who offers the Bull in sacrifice.</p>

<p>We have already read that the cattle which were brought as oblation/offerings were put in the fire and later on eaten, so it is a pretty much clear that Hindu deities used to partake beef.</p>
<p>Hindu extremists make so much hue and cry over cow slaughter today but cow slaughter was a common practice in Vedic period,</p>
<p>Krishna Yajur Veda 2.5.5.3-4 On the full moon (the Soma) is pressed for the gods; during this half-month it is pressed forth for them, and a cow for Mitra and Varuna is to be slaughtered for them at the new moon. In that he sacrifices on the day before…In that he sacrifices at the new moon with clotted curds for Mitra and Varuna, the cow which is slaughtered for the gods becomes his also.</p>
<p>Krishna Yajur Veda 2.2.9.6 At the time of the (offering of the) cow, he should offer on one potsherd to Mitra and Varuna, this (offering) corresponds to his foe&#8217;s cow which is to be slaughtered</p>
<p>Krishna Yajur Veda 5.1.8 …if he were to let them go after circumambulation with fire, he would disturb the sacrifice; if he were to keep them until the conclusion, the heads would be exhausted; in that he offers the animals, he wins thereby animals; in that he lets them go after circumambulation with fire, (it serves) to prevent the exhaustion of the heads; he concludes (the rite) with (an animal) for Prajapati; Prajapati is the sacrifice; verily he concludes the sacrifice in the sacrifice…</p>

<h3><a id="post-6065-Ashvamedha-Yajna"></a>Ashvamedha Yajna</h3>
<p>Veda clearly speaks of animal killing and putting it in the Agni (Fire) during Yajna, one of the most popular hymn about animal slaughter is from the Rig Veda about Horse sacrifice (Ashvamedha Yajna). Ashvamedha mentioned in Rig Veda deals with slaughtering and cooking of the sacrificial horse. I am using English translation of H.H Wilson and Hindi translation of Pundit Ram Govind Trivedi,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.162.9 “Whatever the flies may eat of the raw flesh of the horse; whatever (grease) is smeared upon the brush or upon the axe ; (what is smeared) upon the hands or the nails of the immolator, may all this be with thee, (horse), among the gods.” Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s see what other scriptures says about Horse Sacrifice</p>
<p>Krishna Yajur Veda 5.4.12.1 It is the twenty onefold day, <strong>on which the horse is slain</strong>, there are twelve months, five seasons; these worlds are three</p>
<p>Krishna Yajur Veda 5.3.12. The eye of Prajapati swelled, that fell away, that became a horse; because it swelled (áçvayat), that is the reason why the horse (áçva) has its name. By the horse sacrifice the gods replaced it. He who sacrifices with the horse sacrifice makes Prajapati whole; verily he becomes whole; this is the atonement for everything, and the cure for everything. All evil by it the gods overcame; by it also the gods overcame (the sins of) Brahman- slaying; all evil [1] he overcomes, he overcomes Brahman-slaying who sacrifices with the horse sacrifice, and he who knows it thus. It was the left eye of Prajapati that swelled; therefore they cut off from the horse on the left side, on the right from other animals. The mat is of reeds; the horse has its birthplace in the waters, the reed is born in the waters; verily he establishes it in its own birthplace. The Stoma is the fourfold one; the bee tore the thigh of the horse, the gods made it whole with the fourfold Stoma; in that there is the fourfold Stoma, (it is) to make whole the horse.</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagawatam (Bhagvad Purana) 4.19.11 “When Pṛthu Mahārāja was performing the last horse sacrifice [aśvamedha-yajña], King Indra, invisible to everyone, stole the horse intended for sacrifice. He did this because of his great envy of King Pṛthu.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Commentary: &#8220;King Indra is known as śata-kratu, which indicates that he has performed one hundred horse sacrifices (aśvamedha-yajña). We should know, however, that the animals sacrificed in the yajña were not killed. If the Vedic mantras were properly pronounced during the sacrifice, the animal sacrificed would come out again with a new life.&#8221; <strong>Swami Prabhupada on Srimad Bhagavatam 4.19.11</strong></p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana 11.2.5.1. And, verily, even on this occasion, they slaughter the sacrificial horse (Asvamedha) as a sacrifice to the gods…</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana 13:2:1:1-2 Pragâpati assigned the sacrifices to the gods; the Asvamedha he kept for himself. The gods said to him, &#8216;Surely, this–to wit, the Asvamedha–is a sacrifice: let us have a share in that also.&#8217; He contrived these Anna-homas (food-oblations) for them: thus when he performs the Annahomas, it is the gods he thereby gratifies. With ghee he makes offering, for ghee is fiery mettle: by means of fiery mettle he thus lays fiery mettle into him (the horse and Sacrificer). With ghee he offers; for that–to wit, ghee–is the gods&#8217; favourite resource: it is thus with their favourite resource he supplies them.</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana 11:2:5:5 Verily, then, for him who, knowing this, offers both the Agnihotra and the Full and New-moon sacrifices, they slaughter the sacrificial horse month by month; and month by month the Asvamedha is offered for him, and his Agnihotra and Full and New-moon sacrifices come to pass into the Asvamedha.</p>
<p>Valmiki Ramayan Bala Kanda 1, Sarga 14, Verses 33-38 “With great delight coming on her Queen Kausalya reverently made circumambulations to the horse, and symbolically killed the horse with three knives. Queen Kausalya desiring the results of ritual disconcertedly resided one night with that horse that flew away like a bird…Then the priest, one with controlled senses and rich in scriptural wealth, took up the omentum [fat] of the horse and cooked it as per scriptures while dropping into the altar of fire to bake as a food to the celestials…Those remaining body parts that horse are there, the sixteen officiating priests have procedurally oblated all of them into fire.” Tr. Desiraju Hanumanta Rao</p>
<p>Brahma Purana 104.137 &#8220;After performing these tasks Rama the most excellent among the virtuous performed ten horse-sacrifices where flesh was offered to the deities.&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Swami Vivekananda and Swami Dayanand Saraswati said that whatever from the Puranas (or other text also) contradicts the Vedas then it must be rejected without any mercy. And verses from Shatapatha Brahmana and Puranas confirms that the horse was slaughtered in Ashvamedha Yajna. So there is no way that apologists can now twist verses from Vedas about Horse-sacrifice.</p>

<h3><a id="post-6065-Cows-Guests"></a>Killing cows and offering its meat to guests</h3>
<p>Cattle were slaughtered for guests. But as per Swami Vivekananda this practise was later stopped. Sometimes we may wonder how an animal like cow became so sacred that Hindus started worshiping it and also prohibited its slaughter. When you ask any Hindu why he considers the Cow to be his Mother, he will tell you that &#8216;Since cow gives us milk, we consider it to be our mother&#8217;.</p>
<p>In the Vedas even the earth is considered a Mother. The reason for this may be because food grows from the soil. So Hindus considers all such things to be their mother whichever provides them with food. As we have already read some references about cattle used as source of money and ploughing the fields. It could be that people in ancient India heavily relied on Agriculture. Many farmers in India still plough fields with the help of Bulls and Cows. So killing cattle would result in heavy loss for such people, thus the prohibition of killing cows may have enacted. Swami Vivekananda writes,</p>
<p>&#8220;you read in the Vedas how, when a Sannyasin, a king, or a great man came into a house, the best bullock was killed. How in time it was found that as we were an agricultural race, killing the best bulls meant annihilation of the race. Therefore the practice was stopped, and a voice was raised against the killing of cows. Sometimes we find existing then what we now consider the most horrible customs.&#8221; <strong>The Complete Works of Swami Vivekandan, Volume 3</strong><br />

<p>Hindu scriptures commands to slaughter cattle or goat for the guests,</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti 51.64 When honoring a guest, at a sacrifice, or when worshipping the manes, or the gods, a man may slay cattle, but not otherwise on any account.</p>
<p>Sankhayana Grihya Sutra 2.15.1-3 Should any one of the six persons (mentioned in the Srauta-sutra and in the Sutras 4-9) to whom the Arghya reception is due, visit (him), let him make (ready) a cow, a goat, or what (sort of food) he thinks most like (thereto). Let the Argha not be without flesh. On the occasion of a sacrifice and of a wedding let (the guest) say, &#8216;Make it (ready).&#8217;</p>
<p>Kausitaki Brahmana 1.15 …Just as in the world when a human king has come, or another deserving person, they slay an ox or a cow that miscarries; so for him they slay in that they kindle the fire, for Agni is the victim of the gods.</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana 3:4:1:2. Now as to why it is called &#8216;guest-offering.&#8217; He, the purchased Soma, truly comes as his (the sacrificer&#8217;s) guest,–to him (is offered) that (hospitable reception): even as for a king or a Brâhman one would cook a large ox or a large he-goat–for that is human (fare offered to a guest), and the oblation is that of the gods–so he prepares for him that guest-offering.</p>
<p>Asvalayana Grihya Sutra 1.24.33 Let the Madhuparka not be without flesh, without flesh.</p>
<p>Madhuparka means offerings to the guest. Krishna tells Yuddhisthira,</p>
<p>Mahabharata Book 14, Section 2 “…And then Kesava (Krishna) accosted him,&#8211;&#8216;If a person indulges excessively in sorrow for his departed forefathers, he grieves them. (Therefore, banishing grief), do thou (now) celebrate many a sacrifice with suitable presents to the priests; and do thou gratify the gods with Soma liquor, and the manes of thy forefathers with their due food and drink. Do thou also gratify thy guests with meat and drink and the destitute with gifts commensurate with their desires…” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>On the occasion of Rukmini&#8217;s marriage with Krishna, Rukmi tells his father to slaughter a lakh cows, two lakh deers, 4 lakhs of rabbits and tortoise, ten lakhs of goats and 40 lakhs of sheep,</p>
<p>Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Krishna Janma Khanda 105. 47-67 &#8220;Get also slaughtered a lakh of cows, two lakhs of deer, 4 lakhs of rabbits and tortoise. Reverentially sacrifice to the village goddess on the night of the ful moon ten lakhs of goats and sheep four times the number of the last named and get the flesh properly cooked for food. O lord of the world, get also vegetables cooked for the purpose. The monarch Bhismaka having heard the words of his son took his family priest aside and also sent a suitable Brahmin to Dwarka. He fixed a date which was regarded auspicious unanimously&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Rajendra Nath Sen</p>
<p>Cow is also called Aghnya, Yaska in Nirukta has given two definitions for this word, one is that cow is not to be killed and another one is that cow is called Aghnya because it is a destroyer of sins. Cow is destroyer of sin because sacrificing it emancipates ones sins,</p>
<p>Grihya Sutra of Hiranyakesin I Prasna, 4 Patala, 14 Section, verses 11-16 &#8220;That (cow is either killed or let loose. If he chooses to let it loose, (he murmurs), &#8216;This cow will become a milch cow&#8217;&#8230;If it shall be killed, (he says), &#8216;A cow art thou; sin is driven away from thee. Drive away my sin and the sin of N.N.! Kill ye him whoever hates me. He is killed whosoever hates me. Make (the cow) ready!&#8217; If (the cow) is let loose, a meal is prepared with other meat, and he announces it (to the guest) in the words, &#8216;It is ready!&#8217; He replies, &#8216;It is well prepared; it is Virag; it is food. May it not fail! May I obtain it&#8230;Give food to the Brahmanas!&#8217; After those (Brahmanas) have eaten, (the hose) orders blameless (?) food to be brought to him (i.e. to the guest).</p>
<p>Scholars have opined that milch cows were not slaughtered and only barren cows were slaughtered as slaughtering milch cows would result in heavy loss.</p>

<h3><a id="post-6065-Meat-Consumption"></a>Meat consumption in other Hindu scriptures</h3>
<p>Hindu text even permits the meat of cow,</p>
<p>Apastamba Dharma Shastra Prasna I, Patala 5, Khanda 17, 30-31 (But the meat) of milch-cows and oxen may be eaten. The Vâgasaneyaka declares &#8216;bull&#8217;s flesh is fit for offerings.&#8217; 37. Five-toed animals (ought not to be eaten) with the exception of the iguana, the tortoise, the porcupine, the hedgehog, the rhinoceros, the hare, and the Pûtikhasha.</p>
<p>Vasistha Dharma Shastra 14.46. It is declared in the Vâgasaneyaka, that (the flesh of) milch-cows and oxen is fit for offerings.</p>
<p>Hinduism also permits meat of the following animals, birds and fishes,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 5.18 The porcupine, the hedgehog, the iguana, the rhinoceros, the tortoise, and the hare they declare to be eatable; likewise those (domestic animals) that have teeth in one jaw only, excepting camels.</p>
<p>Padma Purana III.56.31b-46 &#8220;&#8230;O best ones, Prajapati Manu has said that these animals with five claws may be always eaten: alligator, tortoise, hare, rhinoceros, porcupine. He may also eat fish with scales, and the flesh of (the deer called) ruru after having presented them to deities and brahmanas, and not otherwise. O best brahmanas, so also (the flesh of) a peacock, a patridge, a pigeon, a cataka, rhinoceros, a crane, a swan. Thus said Prajapati (Manu). These fish, viz. (the glittering fish) saphari, simhatunda, pathina and rohita are directed as fit to be eaten. With a desire (to retain the status) as a twice-born he should eat the flesh of these after it is sprinkled over; even if he is about to loose his life he should duly use it. He should not at all eat flesh. He who eats what remains, is not smeared (with sin). If he is weak, he should eat flesh as medicine, or by an order or for sacrificial purposes. He, who would give up flesh when invited at a sraddha or a rite in honour of a deity, goes to (i.e. lives) in hell for as many years as the number of hair of the beast&#8230;&#8221; Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p>Agni Purana 168.12-23 &#8220;&#8230;Animals having five nails such as the Shallaki, the Godha, the rhinoceros, and the tortoise are clean animals; and accordingly their flesh may be taken without any impunity. Flesh of animals other than the five mentioned in the preceding line, should be deemed impure. There is no harm in eating such fishes as Pathin, Rohita, and Sinhatunda&#8230;&#8221; Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Yajnavalkya Smriti verse 177-8 Of the five toed animals, the porcupine the iguana-lizard, the tortoise, the hedge-hog; and the hare; among fishes the Simhatundaka and the Rohita. So also the pathina, the Rajiva, the sasalka may be eaten by the twice born classes.</p>
<p>Brahma Purana 113.111-2 &#8220;The following can be eaten: hare, tortoise, alligator, porcupine and the fish with darts (?) The village boar and the cock should be avoided. In the following circumstances, even if one eats meat, one is not defiled: if it is the remnant of offerings unto the Pitrs, Devas etc. or if it is cooked in Sraddha at the request of the brahmins and is sprinkled with the holy water or if it is taken as a medicine.&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Vamana Purana 15.2-3 &#8220;Rice cooked well with oil or ghee, even if it be stored for a long time is fit to be eaten. Rice without any oil or ghee, and delicate preparations of milk, meat of the rabbit, porcupine, alligator, hedgehog, fish and tortoise, pulses and similar other things are fit to be eaten, said Manu.&#8221; Tr. Ananda Swarup Gupta</p>
<p>Paraskara Grihya Sutra III Kanda, 10 Kandika, 48 On the eleventh day he should give to an uneven number of Brahmanas a meal at which meat is served.</p>
<p>Sankha Samhita 13.25 &#8220;A Sraddha ceremony performed by offering oblations of Vala Sakas, bird&#8217;s flesh, the flesh of a rhinoceros, or a large-scaled fish, bears infinite fruit. This is the opinion of Yama, the law-giver.&#8221; Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Sankha Samhita 17.22 &#8220;Golden coloured godhas, tortoises, porcupines, hares, although they belong to the group of five nailed creatures, are animals whose flesh may be eaten; but having killed of any of these animals, one should practise the above-said penance.&#8221; Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Sankha Samhita 17.27 &#8220;Pheasants, peacocks, Lavaakas, Kapinjaras, Vartakas, and Bardhrinasas are birds, whose flesh, according to holy Yama, may be always eaten.&#8221; Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Usana Samhita 3.107 &#8220;This Sraddha is called Pindanvaharyakam. In the afternoon of the day, when the waning of the Moon takes place, the twice-born should perform it with sanctified fish and meat.&#8221; Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Manu Smriti clearly allow consumption of meat,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 5.29  What is destitute of motion is the food of those endowed with locomotion; (animals)  without fangs (are the food) of those with fangs, those without hands of those who possess hands, and the timid of the bold.</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 5.30 The eater who daily even devours those destined to be his food, commits no sin; for the creator himself created both the eaters and those who are to be eaten (for those special purposes).</p>
<p>Above Manu Smriti verse might sound contradicting to other verse of Manu which says,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 5.41 On offering the honey-mixture (to a guest), at a sacrifice and at the rites in honour of the manes, but on these occasions <strong>only</strong>, may an animal be slain; that (rule) Manu proclaimed.</p>
<p>What some Hindu apologists do is they quote these two verse and says &#8220;See these two verses are contradicting each other, one says we can slaughter animals only on occasions but other says we can slaughter animals daily so this proves Manu Smriti is interpolated&#8221; It&#8217;s so easy to say fake translation and Manu Smriti is corrupted to escape the argument, But the next verse explains it,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 5.32 He who eats meat, <strong>when he honours the gods and manes</strong>, commits no sin, whether he has bought it, or himself has killed (the animal), or has received it as a present from others.</p>
<p>So the condition to eat the meat is, he should honor the god, if he doesn&#8217;t then it&#8217;s a minor offense.</p>
<p>Internet Arya Samajis considers Manu Smriti to be unauthentic. Manu Smriti is the second most authentic scripture of Arya Samaj, Vedas are the most sacred Sruti and the Manu Smriti is the most authentic Smriti, Swami Dayanand Saraswati the founder of Arya Samaj writes in his book,</p>
<p>Q. ~ Well sir! Have you no faith even in what the Parashar says:<br />
A. ~ …. <strong>Among the Smrities, the Manu Smriti alone is authentic.- Satyarth Prakash</strong> pg 142, Tr. Chiranjiva Bhardwaja</p>
<p>Dayanand recommended reading Manu Smriti to understand several things, Moreover he used approximately 250 verses of Manu Smriti in his book Satyarth Prakash, If Manu Smriti is so corrupted (corrupted according to some keyboard warriors) then why did Dayanand used 250 Shlokas of Manu Smriti in his book Satyarth Prakash? This proves Manu Smriti is the most authentic Smriti of Arya Samaj no matter today if some keyboard warriors reject it. In a debate between Dayanand and an Orthodox Hindu named Tara Charan, Dayanand accepted that Manu Smriti and few other texts are authoritative and they are based on the Vedas</p>
<p>Some Hindu apologists try to show there is no violence in Yajnas therefore killing animals during Yajna is prohibited, let me give an example to refute this point. Drinking alcohol is illegal in Saudi Arabia, if you trade or drink alcohol there you will be imprisoned, but in India drinking or trade of alcohol is legal and you won&#8217;t be imprisoned for it similarly killing animals in Yajnas is permissible and is a non-violent act.</p>

<h3><a id="post-6065-Sacrifice-Ritual"></a>Animal sacrifice for Vedic sacrifice and rituals</h3>
<p>Hinduism permits slaughtering the following animals for Vedic sacrifices and rituals,</p>
<p>Sankha Samhita 13.25 &#8220;A S&#8217;raddha ceremony performed by offering oblations of Vala Sakas, bird&#8217;s flesh, the flesh of a rhinoceros, or a large scaled fish, bears infinite fruit. This is the opinion of Yama, the law-giver.&#8221; Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana even say that meat is the best food,</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana 11.7.1.3. Now, when he performs the animal offering. He thereby redeems himself–male by male, for the victim is a male, and the Sacrificer is a male. And this, indeed, to wit, flesh, is the best kind of food: he thus becomes an eater of the best kind of food. Let not a year pass by for him without his offering; for the year means life: it is thus immortal life he thereby confers upon himself.</p>
<p>Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 6.4.18 And if a man wishes that a learned son should be born to him, famous, a public man, a popular speaker, that he should know all the Vedas, and that he should live to his full age, then, after having prepared boiled rice with meat and butter, they should both eat, being fit to have offspring. The meat should be of a young or of an old bull.</p>
<p>Maitrayana Brahmaya 6.36 … Therefore (to the former) sacrifice must be offered on the house-altar with hymns, herbs, ghee, meat, cakes, sthalipaka, and other things; to the latter, with meat and drinks (belonging to the great sacrifices) thrown into the mouth, for the<br />
mouth is the Ahavaniya-fire; and this is done to increase our bodily vigour, to gain the world of purity, and for the sake of immortality.</p>
<p>Apastamba Dharma Shastra, Prasna II, Patala 7, Khanda 16.28. By this (permission of the use of buffalo&#8217;s meat) it has been declared that the meat of (other) tame and wild animals is fit to be offered.</p>
<p>Narada Purana III.87.22-24 &#8220;&#8230;If one performs hundred homas everyday with the flesh of a goat smeared with ghee, and continues it for a month, all kings will be subservient to him&#8230;25 By performing homa with the fruits of udumbara and palasa trees he attains good fortune. With the flesh of a jackal also he attains the same&#8230;27 He can captivate people by performing homa with the menstrual flow of women; the desire is fulfilled by means of the flesh of a deer. The stunning is achieved through the flesh of a buffalo&#8230;&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 3.10.3-7 &#8220;When a son is born, let his father perform for him the ceremonies proper on the birth of a child, and all other initiatory rites, as well as a Śráddha, which is a source of prosperity. Let him feed a couple of Brahmans, seated with their faces to the east; and according to his means offer sacrifices to the gods and progenitors. Let him present to the manes balls of meat mixed with curds, barley, and jujubes, with the part of his hand sacred to the gods, or with that sacred to Prajápati. Let a Brahman perform such a Śráddha, with all its offerings and circumambulations, on every occasion of good fortune.&#8221; Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Narada Purana III.90.147 &#8220;By performing homa with the meat of ram smeared with trimadha one shall attain gold. If the meat of ram is smeared with milk and homa is performed, one shall attain a very fertile land abounding in plants within forty days.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Brahma Purana: Gautami Mahatmya 61.27-28 &#8220;In the southern bank of Ganga the cows were set apart as the sacrificial animals. These cows had fled and the Devas herded them together on Ganga.

<h3><a id="post-6065-Gods-Manes"></a>Honoring Gods and Manes is the condition to eat meat</h3>
<p>Yajnavalkya Smriti verse 179 One may eat meat without incurring any guilt when one&#8217;s life is in danger, (when engaged) in Sraddha, when it has been springkled with water while Mantras were recited, when Brahmanas desire one&#8217;s doing it, or when it has been properly offered to Gods and the pitris.</p>
<p>Yajnavalkya Smriti Chapter 1, verse 171 &#8220;[One should avoid] havi (clarified butter) made for the worship of a deity, [before the adoration is finished,] the juice of a pot-herb, that of a red-coloured tree, that of trees born of cuttings, meat of animals not offered in sacrifices&#8230;&#8221; Tr.

<p>Vijnanesvara writes on this verse,</p>
<p>&#8220;Unhallowed meat, The flesh of animals not offered at the sacrifice.&#8221; Tr. Srisa Chandra Vasu</p>
<p>Vyasa Samhita 3.558 &#8220;A twice-born one, by eating the cooked flesh of an animal wantonly slaughtered (not killed in any sacrifice), suffers the pangs of hell for eternal time, or as long as the sun and stars would shine in heaven&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Usana Samhita 9.22 &#8220;[There is] no [penance for taking] the meat [of animals] sacrificed unto a deity; [for taking any other meat, one] should perform the Chandrayana. Or, fasting for twelve days, he should offer oblations of clarified butter to the Fire with the Kushmanda [Mantram].&#8221; Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti 51.59 &#8220;Under no circumstance shall eat the flesh of an animal, not consecrated with Mantras, but he will eat, in conformity with the injunctions of the eternal scriptures, the flesh of an animal consecrated with Mantras and duly offered on the occasion of a sacrifice.&#8221; Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 5.32 He who eats meat, <strong>when he honours the gods and manes</strong>, commits no sin, whether he has bought it, or himself has killed (the animal), or has received it as a present from others.</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti 51.20-21 Or (food that is given) in a disrespectful manner, or the meat (of animals killed) for no sacred purpose. After having (unawares) eaten the flesh of any sort of fish, excepting the Pathina, Rohita, Ragiva, Simhatunda, and Sakula fishes, he must fast for three days.</p>
<p>Kurma Purana II.24.3 &#8220;A Brahmana maintaining sacred fires and desirous of living for a long time should not eat cooked food or meat without performing the Yajna of fresh harvest and the animal sacrifice.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Garuda Purana I.96.72 &#8220;By eating garlic and onion one becomes sinful and as atonement one should perform Candrayana. If one takes meat after worshipping deities and manes in Sraddha one does not acquire sin.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Garuda Purana I.96.60-64 &#8220;&#8230;Meat should not be taken without consecration&#8230;&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Mahabharata Book 3, Section 207 “…this rule has been laid down by Munis:–Whoever partakes of animal food after having first offered it duly and respectfully to the gods and the manes, is not polluted by the act. And such a man is not at all considered to have partaken of animal food…” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Mahabharata Book 12, Section 37 “…Rice boiled in sugared milk, food mixed with the tila seed, meat, and cakes, that have not been dedicated to the gods, should not be taken by Brahmanas leading a domestic mode of life, Having first gratified the gods, Rishis, guests, Pitris, and the household deities, a Brahmana leading a domestic mode of life should then take his food…” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>It is considered sinful to eat meat without honouring gods and manes,</p>
<p>Vamana Purana 12.20 &#8220;Those men who have consumed rice boiled in milk, rice cooked with sesamum, and meat, without offering them to the deity have thrust into their mouth awfully hot iron balls.&#8221; Tr. Ananda Swarup Gupta</p>
<p>Devi Bhagavagam 9.33.62-85. &#8220;If any Brâhmin villain eats, out of greed, any flesh (not sacrificed before the goddess) or anything not offered to Hari, he will have to remain in the Krimi Kunda where he eats those things for as many years as there are hairs on his body&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Gautama Samhita 17.31. Nor the flesh of animals whose milk-teeth have not fallen out, which are diseased, nor the meat of those (which have been killed) for no (sacred) purpose,</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 206.15 &#8220;Then the following formulae should be recited:_ &#8216;Whatever sins I may have committed through insinuations, backbiting, or eating flesh not offered to the gods, be destroyed by the giving away of this copper vessel.&#8217; Then the vessel is to be given over.&#8221; Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>Kurma Purana 2.17.34b-39 &#8220;Manu the Prajapati has said that these five clawed animals may be eaten viz. Godha (alligator), Kurma (tortoise), Sasa (hare), Svavit and Sallaki (the small and the big porcupione). O excellent men, one may eat those fish with thorny scales (?) and the flesh of the deer Ruru. They can be eaten after offering them to the deities and the Brahmanas and not otherwise. The Prajapati has said that the peacock, the francoline patridge, the Kapinjala (a variety of the ruddy goose), the rhenocero and the panther can be eaten. O leading sages, among fishes, these are mentioned as worthy of being eaten, viz: the Rajivas (lotus-like ones) the Simhatundas (lion-snouted), the Pathinas and the Rohitas. The flesh of these must be sprinkled with holy water and consecrated before eating if the Brahmanas so desires. One shall eat meat in accordance with the injunctions or as enjoined at a time when life is in danger. One who eats the remainder (i.e. what is left after worship) or as a medicine or when one is powerless or is deputed, he is not affected by sin.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p><strong>Division of parts of sacrificial animal</strong></p>
<p>Aitareya Brahmana Book 7, Chapter 1, Para 1 “Now follows the division of the different parts of the sacrificial animal (among the priests). We shall describe it. The two jawbones with the tongue are to be given to the Prastotar; the breast in the form of an eagle to the Udgatar; the throat with the palate to the Pratihartar; the lower part of the right loins to the Hotar; the left to the Braham; the right thigh to the Maitravaruna; the left to the Brahmanacchamsi; the right side with the shoulder to the Adhvaryu; the left side to those who accompany the chants; the left shoulder to the Pratipasthatar; the lower part of the right arm to the Neshtar; the lower part of the left arm to the Potar&#8230;the other half of the fleshy part on the neck and the left lobe (kloma) to the slaughterer&#8230;Those who divide the sacrificial animal in the way mentioned, it becomes the guide to heaven. But those who make the division otherwise are like scoundrels and miscreants who kill an animal merely (for gratifying their lust after flesh. This division of the sacrificial animal was invented by the Rishi Devabhaga, a son of Sruta. When he was departing from this life, he did not entrust (the secret to any one). But a supernatural being communicated it to Girija, the son of Babhru. Since his time men study it.&#8221; Tr. Martin Haug</p>

<h3><a id="post-6065-Shraddha-Pitrs"></a>Animal slaughter at Shraddha for Pitrs (ancestors)</h3>
<p>Mahabharata book 13 section 88 Manu has said that if a Sraddha is performed with a copious measure of sesame, such Sraddha becomes inexhaustible. Of all kinds of food, sesame seeds are regarded as the best. With fishes offered at Sraddhas, the Pitris remain gratified for a period of two months. With mutton they remain gratified for three months and with the flesh of the hare for four. With the flesh of the goat, O king, they remain gratified for five months, with bacon for six months, and with the flesh of birds for seven. With venison obtained from those deer that are called Prishata, they remain gratified for eight months, and with that obtained from the Ruru for nine months, and with the meat of the Gavaya for ten months. With the meat of the buffalo their gratification lasts for eleven months. With beef presented at the Sraddha, their gratification, it is said, lasts for a full year. Payasa mixed with ghee is as much acceptable to the Pitris as beef. With the meat of the Vadhrinasa the gratification of the Pitris lasts for twelve years. The flesh of the rhinoceros, offered to the Pitris on the anniversaries of the lunar days on which they died, becomes inexhaustible. The potherb called Kalasaka, the petals of the Kanchana flower, and meat of the goat also, thus offered, prove inexhaustible.</p>
<p>Apastamba Dharma Shastra, Prasna II, Patala 7, Khanda 16.3-4 At that (rite) the Manes (of one&#8217;s father, grandfather, and great-grand father) are the deities (to whom the sacrifice is offered). But the Brâhmanas, (who are fed,) represent the Âhavanîya-fire. That rite must be performed in each month [26] Beef satisfies (the Manes) for a year.</p>
<p>Apastamba Dharma Shastra, Prasna II, Patala 7, Khanda 17.1-3 (If) rhinoceros&#8217; meat (is given to Brahmanas seated) on (seats covered with) the skin of a rhinoceros, (the Manes are satisfied) for a very long time. (The same effect is obtained) by (offering the) flesh (of the fish called) Satabali, And by (offering the) meat of the (crane called)</p>
<p>Gautama Dharma Shastra 15.15. The Manes are satisfied for a month by gifts of sesamum, Masha-beans, rice, barley, and water, For (three) years by fish and the flesh of common deer, spotted deer, hares, turtles, <strong>boars</strong>, and sheep,For twelve years by cow&#8217;s milk and messes made of milk, For a very long time by the flesh of (the crane called) Vardhrinasa, by Ocyrnurn sanctum (sacred Basil), and by the flesh of goats, (especially) of a red (he-goat), and of a rhinoceros, (if these dishes are) mixed with honey.</p>
<p>Maharishi Manu writes,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 3.266-72 I will now fully declare what kind of sacrificial food, given to the manes according to the rule, will serve for a long time or for eternity. The ancestors of men are satisfied for one month with sesamum grains, rice, barley, masha beans, water, roots, and fruits, which have been given according to the prescribed rule, Two months with fish, three months with the meat of gazelles, four with mutton, and five indeed with the flesh of birds, Six months with the flesh of kids, seven with that of spotted deer, eight with that of the black antelope, but nine with that of the (deer called) Ruru, Ten months they are satisfied with the meat of boars and buffaloes, but eleven months indeed with that of hares and tortoises, One year with cow-milk and milk-rice; from the flesh of a long-eared white he-goat their satisfaction endures twelve years. The (vegetable called) Kalasaka, (the fish called) Mahasalka, the flesh of a rhinoceros and that of a red goat, and all kinds of food eaten by hermits in the forest serve for an endless time.</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 2.16.1-3 “AURVA continued.–&#8221;Ancestors are satisfied for a month with offerings of rice or other grain, with clarified butter, with fish, or the flesh of the hare, of birds, of the hog, the goat, the antelope, the deer, the gayal, or the sheep, or with the milk of the cow, and its products. They are for ever satisfied with flesh (in general), and with that of the long-eared white goat in particular. The flesh of the rhinoceros, the Kálaśáka potherb, and honey, are also especial sources of satisfaction to those worshipped at ancestral ceremonies.” Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Yajnavalkya Smriti verse 258-59 (The Pitris are satisfied) verily for a moth with the havisya (sacrificial food), but for a year with the milk rice, with the fish, with the meat of gazelles, with mutton, with the flesh of birds, with the flesh of kids, with flesh of spotted deer. With the flesh of black antelope, with that of Ruru deer, with the meat of boars, and with the meat of hares respectively for a period progessively increasing by a month are satisfied when offered to the Grandfathers here.</p>
<p>Markandeya Purana 32.2-5; Matsya Purana 17-31-36 The Pitris are satisfied with clarified butter and rice for a month. The paternal grandfathers receive satisfaction with fish meat for two months. Venison should be known to satisfy the pitris for three months; and the flesh of hares nourishes the pitris for four months; bird&#8217;s flesh satisfies them for five months; hog&#8217;s flesh for six months; goat&#8217;s flesh for seven months; and flesh of the black antelope for eight months; flesh of the ruru deer gives them satisfication for nine months, without doubt; flesh of gayal gives satisfaction for ten months.</p>
<p>Same is repeated in in Kurma Purana II.20.37-54 which also talks about giving meat to Brahmins as food. Narada Purana Uttarabhaga 44.51; Vayu Purana 21-2-9; Agni Purana 117.44-48; Padma Purana 1.9.153-157; Agni Purana 163.28-39; Brahma Purana 111.15-33; Brahmanda Purana 2.3.19.2-10 similar thing is also said in Garuda Purana I.99.37- 38; Matsya Purana 15.34-35; Matsya Purana 204.6-9; Narada Purana II.51.142b-145a; Padma Purana 1.9.62-63 including the following verses,</p>
<p>Markandeya Purana 35.2-4 &#8220;&#8230;The hare, the tortoise, the gosamp, the porcupine, and the rhinoceros, my son, these indeed may be eaten; and domestic pig and fowl should be eschewed. The remains of food at a sraddha after the pitris and gods and other recipients have been satisfied may be eaten at the desire of the brahmanas. A man who eats flesh that has been killed for the purpose of medicine is not defiled.&#8221;</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti 30.34 Now he who studies the hymns of the Rig-veda (regularly), feeds the manes with clarified butter. 37 He who studies the Atharva-veda, (feeds them) with meat.</p>
<p>Markandeya Purana 32.31-34 &#8220;At this ceremony also songs in honour of the pitris are sung by those who recite the Veda, songs which were formerly sung by the pitris to king Puruavas. &#8220;When will any one of use have a son, the chief among his race, who, eating the remains food left by yogis, will offer the pinda on earth? Or will offer pinda, buffalo-beef, the clarified butter, or the vegetable kala mixed with sesamum-seed, or khichree at Gaya for our monthly satisfaction? May we obtain the offering to the Visvadevas and the soma juice, buffalo-beef, and the finest clarified butter, and the divine food by getting a young rhinoceros!&#8221;</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti 80.1-14 Sesamum, rice, barley, beans, water, roots, fruits, vegetables, Syâmâka grain, millet, wild rice, kidney-beans, and wheat satisfy (the manes) for a month; The flesh of fishes (excepting those species that are forbidden), for two months; The flesh of the common deer, for three months; The flesh of sheep, for four months; The flesh of birds (of those kinds that may be eaten), for five months; The flesh of goats, for six months; The flesh of the spotted deer, for seven months; The flesh of the spotted antelope, for eight months; Beef, for nine months; Buffalo&#8217;s meat, for ten months; The meat of a hornless goat, for eleven months; The milk of a cow, or preparations from it, for a year. On this subject there exists a stanza, which the manes utter: &#8216;(The pot-herb) Kâlasâka (sacred basil), (the prawn) Mahâsalka, and the flesh of the (crane called) Vârdhrînasa[1], (and of) a rhinoceros having no horn, is food which we always accept.&#8217;</p>
<p>Agni Purana 117.44-48 &#8220;Now I shall discuss the nature of satisfaction which the different sorts of cakes or oblations respectively impart to the souls of one&#8217;s ancestors. Oblations composed of cereals grown in villages as well as forest fruits, bulbs and roots last one&#8217;s forefathers for a month, while those consisting of fishes and venison would serve them well for double or triple that division of time. The peculiar kind of venison known as the Rouravas would gratify them for five months, whereas games and wild fowls would last them for four months. The departed soul are supposed to live satisfactorily upon goat&#8217;s meat for six months, meat of tortoise, pork, mutton, and buffalo flesh lasting them for seven, eight, nine and ten months respectively. Sweetened porridge and butter of cow milk offered in a clarified state would gratify them for a whole year, while the meat of a full grown sacrificial goat (Vardrinasa) as well as the sword of a rhinoceros, flesh of an antelope or that of a red goat and honey should be considered as their full and proper ration for a period of three consecutive&#8217; months. Offerings made during the rainy season consist of fishes having large scales, while a Shraddha ceremony performed on the day on which the moon enters the asterisk Magha should be supposed as hearing immortal fruits.&#8221; Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Usana Samhita 3.137-141 &#8220;one should, with care, give at a Sraddha, deer, lamb and tortoise. With fish and meat, [the Manes attain to gratification for] two months; and [for] three months, with the meat of deer. With mutton, [they are gratified for] four months; with the meat of birds, [for] five months; with the meat of goat, [for] six months; and with the meat of Ruru deer, [for] nine months. With the meat of buffalo and pork, [they] are gratified for ten months; and with the meat of hare and tortoise, for eleven months. With cow&#8217;s milk and Payasa (milk and boiled-rice), [they attain to gratification for] one year. With the meat of rhinoceros, [they attain to] gratification for twelve years. Black pot herbs, sea-scrabs, meat of rhinoceros and black goat, honey and all other roots leads to their everlasting gratification.&#8221; Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Grihya Sutra of Hiranyakesin II Prasna, 5 Patala, 15 section, 1-9 On the following day he sacrifices a cow to the Fathers&#8230;When it has been sprinkled and fire has been carried round it, they kill it to the west of the fire, its head being turned to the west, its feet to the south. After it has been killed, he silently &#8216;strengthens&#8217; its sense-organs (by touching them) with water, and silently takes out the omentum, the heart, and the kidneys.…He sacrifices the omentum entirely. The other parts (Sutra 5) he should offer to the Brahmanas and should feed them (with those parts of the cow). When the food (for the Brahmanas) is ready, he cuts off (the Avadanas) together from the mess of boiled rice, and form the pieces of meat, and mixing them with clarified butter he makes oblations thereof with the verses, &#8216;Behold the Ekashtaka, the giver of food with meat and ghee, (which is offered) with (the word) svadha. By the Brahmanas that food is purified. May it be an imperishable (blessings to me! Svadha! Adoration!&#8217;</p>
<p>Grihya Sutra of Apastamba Patala 8, Section 22, 3-5 &#8220;On the following day he touches a cow with a Darbha blade, with the words, &#8216;I touch thee agreeable to the Fathers.&#8217; having silently offered five Agya oblations, and having cooked the omentum of the (cow), and performed the &#8216;spreading under&#8217; and the sprinkling over (of Agya), he sacrifices (the omentun) with the next (verse, II, 20, 28) with a Palasa leaf from the middle or the end (of the stalk).

<p>Asvalayana Grihya Sutra, 1 Adhyaya, 11 Kandika, 1-10 &#8220;Now (follows) the ritual of the animal sacrifice&#8230;To the west of the Samitra (fire) he (the Samitri) kills (the animal), the head of which is turned to the east or to the west, the feet to the north; and having placed a grass-blade on his side of the (animal&#8217;s) navel, (the &#8216;performer&#8217;) draws out the omentum, cuts off the omentum, seizes it with the two Agnisrapanis, sprinkles it with water, warms it at the Samitra (fire), takes it before that fire, roasts it, being seated to the south, goes round (the two fires), and sacrifices it.</p>
<p>Instructions on animal sacrifice is also mentioned in Asvalayana Grihya Sutra, II Adhyaya, 4 Kandika, 13; Asvalayana Grihya Sutra, IV Adhyaya, 8 Kandika, 16-18</p>
<p>Gutama Dharma Shastra 17.37-38 And (animals) that must be slain for (the fulfilment of) the sacred law. Let him eat (the flesh of animals) killed by beasts of prey, after having washed it, if no blemish is visible, and if it is declared to be fit for use by the word (of a Brahmana). I.e animals offered at Sraddhas and Srauta-sacrifices, though under other circumstances forbidden, may be eaten both by the priests and other Brahmanas.</p>
<p>Padma Purana 1.33.80 &#8220;O you of a good vow, satisfy the brahmanas with musk, and flesh and various kinds of grains, and by offering a Sraddha.&#8221; Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p>All these animals sacrificed to gods and manes is supposed to be eaten by the Brahmin priest. Some Aryas may cry that this has nothing to do with Hinduism, these are interpolated texts. But for their kind information, interpolation can occur only in one text, the same interpolation cannot happen in several texts like Manu Smriti, Yajnvalkya Smriti, Mahabharata, Vishnu, Markandeya, Matsya Puranas, Dharma Shastras and so on. The fact that this Shraddha for Pitrs occurs in so many Smritis and Puranas proves that Sages who wrote these books agreed with it, so do Hindus mean to say they know more about Hinduism than their sages?</p>

<h3><a id="post-6065-Rejecting-Meat"></a>Rejecting meat offered at Vedic sacrifice and ritual is sinful</h3>
<p>Hindu texts even say that one who refuses to eat meat offered to gods and manes at Shraddha is punished after death,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 5.35 But a man who, being duly engaged (to officiate or to dine at a sacred rite), refuses to eat meat, becomes after death an animal during twenty-one existences.</p>
<p>Vasistha Dharma Shastra 11.34 &#8216;But an ascetic who, invited to dine at a sacrifice of the manes or of the gods, rejects meat, shall go to hell for as many years as the slaughtered beast has hairs.&#8217;</p>
<p>Kurma Purana 2.17.40 &#8220;If a person invited for the Sraddha or the worship of a deity eschews meat he may have to be in the hell as many years as there are hairs on the body of the animal.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Kurma Purana II.22.74-75 &#8220;An excellent Brahmana engaged in the Sraddha should not avoid anything served. He should not refuse even the meat offered. One should not look at the food served to another person. If the Brahmanas who engaged in the Pitr rite, does not partake of the meat served, he is reborn as an animal for twenty-one births.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Vyasa Samhita 3.56-57 &#8220;A Brahmana, engaged in the celebration of a religious sacrifice, becomes degraded by not taking meat. A Kshatriya should eat the cooked flesh of a quarry after having propitiated therewith the gods and his departed manes.

<h3><a id="post-6065-Animals-Sacrifice"></a>Animals are created for sacrifice</h3>
<p>Manu Smriti 5.31-42 The consumption of meat (is befitting) for  sacrifices,&#8217; that is declared to be a rule made by the gods; but to persist (in using it) on other (occasions) is said to be a proceeding worthy of Rakshasas. He who eats meat, when he honours the gods and manes, commits no sin, whether he has bought it, or himself has killed (the animal), or has received it as a present from others…After death the guilt of one who slays deer for gain is not as (great) as that of him who eats meat for no (sacred) purpose. But a man who, being duly engaged (to officiate or to dine at a sacred rite), refuses to eat meat, becomes after death an animal during twenty-one existences…If he has a strong desire (for meat) he may make an animal of clarified butter or one of flour, (and eat that); but let him never seek to destroy an animal without a (lawful) reason. As many hairs as the slain beast has, so often indeed will he who killed it without a (lawful) reason suffer a violent death in future births. Svayambhu (the Self-existent) himself created animals for the sake of sacrifices; sacrifices (have been instituted) for the good of this whole (world); hence the slaughtering (of beasts) for sacrifices is not slaughtering (in the ordinary sense of the word)&#8230;On offering the honey-mixture (to a guest), at a sacrifice and at the rites in honour of the manes, but on these occasions only, may an animal be slain; that (rule) Manu proclaimed. A twice-born man who, knowing the true meaning of the Veda, slays an animal for these purposes, causes both himself and the animal to enter a most blessed state.</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti 51.61 It is for sacrifices that beasts have been created by the self-existent (Brahman) himself. Sacrificing causes the whole universe to prosper; therefore is the slaughter (of beasts) for a sacrifice no slaughter.</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti 51.65 That twice-born man who, knowing the exact truth (promulgated) in the Veda, slays cattle for the sacrifices (ordained in the Veda) will convey himself and the cattle (slain by him) to a blissful abode.</p>
<p>Chandogya Upanishad 8.15.1  …never giving pain to any creature, except at the tirthas  (sacrifices, &amp;c.), he who behaves thus all his life, reaches the world of Brahman, and does not return, yea, he does not return..</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam (Bhagvad Purana) 11.5.11 “In this material world the conditioned soul is always inclined to sex, meat-eating and intoxication. Therefore religious scriptures never actually encourage such activities. Although the scriptural injunctions provide for sex through sacred marriage, for meat-eating through sacrificial offerings and for intoxication through the acceptance of ritual cups of wine, such ceremonies are meant for the ultimate purpose of renunciation.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Mahabharata Book 3, Section 207 “And in days of yore, O Brahmana, two thousand animals used to be killed every day in the kitchen of king Rantideva…&#8217;The sacred fire is fond of animal food,&#8217; this saying has come down to us. And at sacrifices animals are invariably killed by regenerate Brahmanas, and these animals being purged of sin, by incantation of hymns, go to heaven. If, O Brahmana, the sacred fire had not been so fond of animal food in ancient times, it could never have become the food of any one. And in this matter of animal food, this rule has been laid down by Munis:–Whoever partakes of animal food after having first offered it duly and respectfully to the gods and the manes, is not polluted by the act. And such a man is not at all considered to have partaken of animal food…” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.163.12-13 “The strong Steed hath come forward to the slaughter, pondering with a mind directed God-ward. The goat who is his kin is led before him the sages and the singers follow after. The Steed is come unto the noblest mansion, is come unto his Father and his Mother. This day shall he approach the Gods, most welcome: then he declares good gifts to him who offers.” Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>Above verses from Mahabharata and Veda says that animals killed in Vedic sacrifice goes to heaven, on this statement I would like to mention the argument of Jains and Buddhists against this,</p>
<p>&#8220;If an animal slaughtered in religious worship is thereby raised to heaven, would it not be expedient for a man who institutes a sacrifice to kill his own father for a victim?&#8221;</p>

<h3><a id="post-6065-Killing-nonviolent"></a>Killing animal is non-violent</h3>
<p>Vedic verses clearly tells us that killing animal is part of Yajna (sacrifice). Maharshi Manu also writes that slaughtering animals for sacrifices is non-violent,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 5.44 Know that the injury to moving creatures and to those destitute of motion, which the Veda has prescribed for certain occasions, is no injury at all; for the sacred law shone forth from the Veda.</p>
<p>Whether animals should be killed in Yajna (Sacrifices) or not is explained in detail in the Devi Bhagawatam,</p>
<p>Devi Bhagwatam 1.18.48-61 &#8220;…O King! One can see before one&#8217;s eyes that the drinking of Soma rasa, the killing of animals, the eating of fish and flesh and so are advised in the Vedas; so much so that in the sacrificial ceremony named Sautrâmana the rule of drinking wine and many other vratas are clearly mentioned; even gambling is advised in the Vedas. So how can Mukti be obtained by following the Veda Dharma? It is heard that, in ancient times, there was a great king, named S&#8217;as&#8217;avindu, very religious, truthful, and performing sacrifices, very liberal; he protected the virtuous, and chastised those that were wicked and going astray. He performed many Yajñas, where many cows and sheep were sacrificed according to the rules of the Vedas and abundant Dakshinâs (sacrificial fees) were presented to every one that performed their parts in the sacrifices. In these sacrifices, the hides of the cows that were sacrificed as victims, were heaped to such an enormous extent that they looked liked a second Bindhyâchal mountain. Then the rains fell and the dirty water coming out of that enormous heap of skins flowed down and gave rise to a river which was thence called the Charmanvatî river… Janaka said :– &#8220;The killing of animals in a sacrificial ceremony is not killing; it is known as Ahimsa [Non Violence]; for that himsa [Violence] is not from any selfish attachment; therefore when there is no such sacrifice and the animals are killed out of selfish attachment, then that is real himsâ; … O Dvija! Really speaking, the killing of animals done by the house-holder attached to senses and their objects, and done under their impulses can be taken into account as a real act of killing; but, O Mahâbhâga of those whose hearts are not attached to anything of those self controlled persons, desirous of moksa, if they do an act of Himsa out of a sense of duty, with no desires of fruits and with their hearts free from egoism that can never be reckoned as a real act of killing.&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 3.26.32-34 &#8220;Those who eat meat, they can sacrifice animals in this worship of the Devî; and, for this purpose, goat and wild boars are the best. O sinless one! The goats, etc., offered as a sacrifice before the Devî attain to unending heavens. Therefore persons offering the sacrifices of goats do not incur any sin. O king! The goats, etc., and other beast offered as a sacrifice before the Devas undoubtedly go to the heavenly regions; therefore, in all the S&#8217;âstras, it has been decided that this killing of animals in a sacrifice is considered as non-killing.&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti 51.67 That slaughter which is in accordance with the precepts of the Veda, and has been fixed for this world of movable and immovable creatures, should be considered as no slaughter at all; because it is from the Veda that law shines forth.</p>
<p>Kalki Purana 26.12 &#8220;&#8230;The Vedas therefore say that killing in a righteous battle or in a sacrificial performace does not constitute killing.&#8221; Tr. Bhumipati Das, edited by Purnaprajna Das</p>
<p>Following verse from Vasistha explains Manu Smriti 5.48 which is used by Hindu apologists to prohibit meat consumption in Manu,</p>
<p>Vasistha Dharma Shastra 4.5-8 The Manava (Sutra states), &#8216;Only when he worships the manes and the gods, or honours guests, he may certainly do injury to animals.&#8217; On offering a Madhuparka (to a guest), at a sacrifice, and at the rites in honour of the manes, but on these occasions only may an animal be slain; that (rule) Manu proclaimed.&#8221;Meat can never be obtained without injuring living beings, and to injure living beings does not procure heavenly bliss; therefore the (sages declare) the slaughter (of beasts) at a sacrifice not to be slaughter (in the ordinary sense of the word).&#8217; &#8216;Now he may also cook a full-grown ox or a full-grown he-goat for a Brâhmana or Kshatriya guest; in this manner they offer hospitality to such (a man).</p>

<h3><a id="post-6065-Examples"></a>Examples of meat consumption</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Krishna</strong></p>
<p>Krishna recommended slaughtering animals for worshipping Govardhan Mountain and also ate the flesh of animals that was offered by the people,</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 5.10.36-49 “Let prayer and offerings then be addressed to the mountain Govarddhana, and kill a victim in due form. Let the whole station collect their milk without delay, and feed with it the Brahmans and all who may desire to partake of it. When the oblations have been presented, and the Brahmans have been fed, let the Gopas circumambulate the cows, decorated with garlands of autumnal flowers. If the cowherds will attend to these suggestions, they will secure the favour of the mountain, of the cattle, and also mine.&#8221; When Nanda and the other Gopas heard these words of Krishńa, their faces expanded with delight, and they said that he had spoken well. &#8220;You have judged rightly, child,&#8221; exclaimed they; &#8220;we will do exactly as you have proposed, and offer adoration to the mountain.&#8221; Accordingly the inhabitants of Vraja worshipped the mountain, presenting to it curds and milk and flesh; and they fed hundreds and thousands of Brahmans, and many other guests, who came to the ceremony, even as Krishńa had enjoined: and when they had made their offerings, they circumambulated the cows and the bulls, that bellowed as loud as roaring clouds. Upon the summit of Govarddhana, Krishńa presented himself, saying, &#8220;I am the mountain,&#8221; and partook of much food presented by the Gopas; whilst in his own form as Krishńa he ascended the hill along with the cowherds, and worshipped his other self. Having promised them many blessings, the mountain-person of Krishńa vanished; and the ceremony being completed, the cowherds returned to their station.” Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>H.H. Wilson also writes about it in his introduction of translation of Vishnu Purana,</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;and says that at Krsna&#8217;s advice Nanda and the other cowherds worshipped the mount Govardhana with the offer of various kinds of foods including meat of a sacrificial animal killed on that occasion and that Krsna took his seat on the mount, identifying himself with it, and ate up much of the food thus offered by the cowherds&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>It is also mentioned in Harivamsha Purana,</p>
<p>Harimvsha Purana 2.17.15-21 &#8220;Let us kill the animals such as buffalos to be eaten. Let this sacrifice be conducted with all gopas…Along with a pond of curd, a vortex of ghee, a river of milk, a variety of meat and a mountain of cooked rice, the entire complex of vraja including the happy gopa-s and beautiful gopi-s proceeded for the hill sacrifice…At the start of the sacrifice, the items were offered to the fire as ordained. The gopa-s performed the sacrifice along with brahmins on an auspicious day. At the end of the sacrifice, by illusion, Krishna became the hill and consumed the best rice, milk, curd and meat which were offered.&#8221; Tr. A. Purushothaman and A. Harindranath</p>
<p>This is also mentioned in Brahma Purana,</p>
<p>Brahma Purana 79.21 &#8220;[Krishna said] Hence, let the mountain Govardhana be honoured and worshipped with all due offerings after killing the sacrificial animal in accordance with injunctions. [25] Vyasa said: O brahmins, on hearing these words of his, Nanda and other residents of the colony became delighted with their faces beaming with pleasure. They said &#8216;Well said, well said, my boy&#8230;Accordingly the residents of colony performed Yajna unto the mountain. They offered oblations unto the mountain by curds, milk puddings, meat etc.&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Hundreds of animals were slaughtered and wine was drunk by Krishna&#8217;s family and Pandavas,</p>
<p>Mahabharata Virata Parva 4, Section 72, Verses 19-28 &#8220;And Krishna gave unto each of the illustrious sons of Pandu numerous female slaves, and gems and robes. And then the nuptial festival set in between the families of the Matsya king and the Pandavas. And then conchs and cymbals and horns and drums and other musical instruments appointed by the Pandavas, began to play in the palace of Virata. And deer of various kinds and clean animals by hundreds were slain. And wines of various kinds and intoxicating juices of trees were profusely collected.&#8221; Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Rama</strong></p>
<p>These are the words of Hindu god Ram before his exile,</p>
<p>Valmiki Ramayana, Ayodhya Kanda 2.20.29 &#8220;I shall live in a solitary forest like a sage for fourteen years, <strong>leaving off meat</strong> and living with roots, fruits and honey.&#8221; Tr. K.M.K. Murthy</p>
<p>This proves that meat was part of his lavish lifestyle in the palace. Rama also used to relish pork, meat of deer and other animals in the forest after the exile,</p>
<p>Valmiki Ramayana, Ayodhya Kanda 2.52.102 &#8220;Famished, they (Rama and Lakshmana) killed a boar, a rishya (whitefooted male antelope), a spotted deer and a great deer with black stripes. They partook the meat and reached a tree by evening where they rested for the night.&#8221; Tr. <a href="https://www.valmiki.iitk.ac.in/sloka?field_kanda_tid=2&amp;language=dv&amp;field_sarga_value=52" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">IIT Kanpur<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>Valmiki Ramayana Ayodhya Kanda 2.96.1-2 &#8220;Having shown Mandakini River in that manner to Seetha, the daughter of Mithila, Rama set on the hill-side in order to gratify her appetite with a piece of flesh. Rama, whose mind was devoted to righteousness stayed there with Seetha, saying; &#8220;This meat is fresh, this is savoury and roasted in the fire.&#8221; Tr. Shri K.M.K. Murthy</p>
<p>Sita addressed Ravana (who was in the guise of an ascetic) in the following way,</p>
<p>Valmiki Ramayana 3.47.22b-23 &#8220;Be comfortable for a moment, here it is possible for you to make a sojourn, and soon my husband will be coming on taking plentiful forest produce, and on killing stags, mongooses, wild boars he fetches meat, aplenty.&#8221; Tr. Desiraju Hanumanth Rao</p>
<p>This is what Rama said to Lakshamana on hunting a golden deer,</p>
<p>Valmiki Ramayana, Aranya Kanda 3.43.31 &#8220;Kings pursuing games of hunting in great forests, oh, Lakshmana, will be felling deer either for the sake of flesh, or just for the purpose of sporting archery.&#8221; Tr. Desiraju Hanumant Rao</p>
<p>Ramayana of Valmiki, Ayodhya Kanda 2, Sarga 55, verse 33 “Thereafter having travelled only a couple of miles the two brothers Rama and Lakshmana killed many consecrated deer and ate in the river-forest of Yamuna.” Tr. K.M.K. Murthy</p>
<p>Bali addresses Rama,</p>
<p>Ramayana of Valmiki, Kishikindha Kanda 4, Sarga 17, Verse 39 &#8220;Raghava, five kinds of five-nailed animals, viz., a kind of wild rodent, a kind of wild-boar, a kind of lizard, a hare and fifthly the turtle are edible for Brahmans and Kshatriya-s.&#8221; Tr. Desiraju Hanumanta Rao</p>
<p>Rama&#8217;s father Dashratha was an avid hunter,</p>
<p>Valmiki Ramayana, Ayodhya Kanda 2.63.21-25 &#8220;With a wish to do hunting as an exercise in that most comfortable season, I went along Sarayu River, in a chariot, wearing bow and arrows. Without my senses under control and with an intent to kill there a (wild) buffalo or an elephant or any other wild animal coming in the night at that place for the purpose of drinking water, I was ready with my bow at a solitary place. Hearing the sound, I killed turning towards it, a wild animal, which came to the bank of Sarayu River and another violent beast too which came there. Meanwhile, in that darkness and not within the react of the eye, I heard the sound of a pitcher being filled up, the sound of which appeared like that of an elephant. With an intent to hit that elephant, I drew out a shining arrow resembling a serpent, targeted towards the direction sound and discharged it.&#8221; Tr. Shri K.M.K Murthy</p>
<p>Some Hindus says that meat shouldn&#8217;t be consumed in Kali Yuga. But they are unaware of the fact that Kalki avatar who will be born in Kali Yuga will offer meat to Brahmins as per Kalki Purana,</p>
<p>Kalki Purana 30.10-13 &#8220;Lord Kalki sumptuously fed all the brahmanas the four kinds of food that are chewed, licked, sucked, and rank, and this included vegetable preparations, soup, cakes, meat, fruit, roots, and many other items&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Bhumipati Das, edited by Purnaprajna Das</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Shiva</strong></p>
<p>Mahabharata Book 13, Section 161, Verse 7 &#8220;And since he burns and oppresses, is keen and fierce, and endued with great energy, and is engaged in eating flesh and blood and marrow, he is said to be Rudra.&#8221; Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.30.202 &#8220;Hail to the one greedy of raw and cooked meat&#8230;[211] Obeisance to the jackal (fond of) embryo meal&#8230;&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Kalki</strong></p>
<p>Kalki avatar tells to perform horse sacrifice,</p>
<p>Kalki Purana 3.42 &#8220;(Lord Kalki said:) Many pious human beings become degraded in this age of Kali. But because of My presence, they will all become pious once again. Now I would like that all of you worship Me by the performance of a Rajasuya sacrifice and a horse sacrifice.&#8221; Tr. Bhumipati Das, edited by Purnaprajna Das</p>
<p>Kalki Purana also says that Vishnuyasa father of Kalki avatar will perform horse sacrifice. This proves that Ashvamedha Yajna (horse sacrifice) is permissible in Kali Yuga also. Secondly, Vedas are said to be eternal which permits animal slaughter so there is no prohibition to consume meat in Kali Yuga. Mahabharata also shows that Brahmins used to relish meat,</p>
<p>Mahabharata Book 3, Section 96 &#8220;…The Brahmana, however, did not grant the Asura a son like Indra. And at this, the Asura was inflamed with wrath against the Brahmana. And from that day, O king, the Asura Ilwala became a destroyer of Brahmanas. And endued with power of illusion the angry Asura transformed his brother into a ram. And Vatapi also capable of assuming any form at will, would immediately assume the shape of a ram. And the flesh of that ram, after being properly dressed, was offered to Brahmanas as food. And after they had eaten of it, they were slain. For whomsoever Ilwala summoned with his voice, he would come back to Ilwala even if he had gone to the abode of Yama, in re-embodied form endued with life, and show himself to Ilwala. And so having transformed the Asura Vatapi into a ram and properly cooked his flesh and feeding Brahmanas therewith, he would summon Vatapi…&#8221; Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Ashwamedha Yajna mentioned in Mahabharata,</p>
<p>Mahabharata Book 14, Section 89 “Vaisampayana said, &#8216;Having cooked, according to due rites, the other excellent animals that were sacrificed, the priests then sacrificed, agreeably to the injunctions of the scriptures, that steed (which had wandered over the whole world). After cutting that horse into pieces, conformably to scriptural directions, they caused Draupadi of great intelligence, who was possessed of the three requisites of mantras, things, and devotion, to sit near the divided animal. The Brahmanas then with cool minds, taking up the marrow of that steed, cooked it duly, O chief of Bharata&#8217;s race. King Yudhishthira the just, with all his younger brothers, then smelled, agreeably to the scriptures, the smoke, capable of cleansing one from every sin, of the marrow that was thus cooked. The remaining limbs, O king, of that horse, were poured into the fire by the sixteen sacrificial priests possessed of great wisdom.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>

<p>Rishi Agastya is said to have eaten beasts and birds and even a Asura who was in the form of a ram,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 5.22-23 Beasts and birds recommended (for consumption) may be slain by Brahmanas for sacrifices, and in order to feed those whom they are bound to maintain; for Agastya did this of old. For in ancient (times) the sacrificial cakes were (made of the flesh) of eatable beasts and birds at the sacrifices offered by Brahmanas and Kshatriyas.</p>
<p>Vasistha Dharma Shastra 14.15. For it is declared in the Veda, &#8216;At a sacrificial session (sattra), which lasted one thousand years, Agastya went out to hunt. He had sacrificial cakes prepared with the meat of beasts and fowls good (to eat).&#8217;</p>
<p>Mahabharata Book 3, Section 199 &#8220;Lomasa said, &#8216;When Ilwala learnt that those kings along with the great Rishi had arrived on the confines of his domain, he went out with his ministers and worshipped them duly. And that prince of Asuras received them hospitably, entertaining them, O son of the Kuru race, with well dressed meat supplied by his brother Vatapi (transformed into a ram). Then all those royal sages, beholding the mighty Asura Vatapi, who had been transformed into a ram thus cooked for them, became sad and cheerless and were nearly deprived of themselves. But that best of Rishis&#8211;Agastya&#8211;addressing those royal sages, said, &#8216;Yield ye not to grief, I will eat up the great Asura.&#8217; And the mighty Rishi then sat himself down on an excellent seat, and the prince of Asuras, Ilwala, began to distribute the food smilingly. And Agastya ate up the whole of the meat supplied by Vatapi (transformed into a ram).” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Following verse shows that animal sacrifice was performed to please departed manes,</p>
<p>Brahma Purana 5.47-50 &#8220;&#8230;On the Astaka day Iksvaku commanded Vikuksi &#8216;O powerful one, kill some rabbits and bring their flesh for performing Sraddha.&#8217;O Brahmins, after planning to perform the Sraddha rite before executing it he ate part of the meat of the rabbit which was meant for the Sraddha&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>This is also mentioned in Devi Bhagavatam and Srimad Bhagavatam 9.6.6-8 and Devi Bhagavatam,</p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 7.59.1-11. Vyâsa said :&#8211; O King! Once on a time, the time for Astaka S&#8217;râddha (the funeral ceremony in honour of the departed) arrived. Seeing this, the King Iksâku ordered his son Vikuksi:&#8211; &#8220;O Child! Go immediately to the forest and bring carefully pure sanctified meat for the S&#8217;râddha purposes; see, that there be no neglect of duty.&#8221; Thus ordered, Vikuksi instantly went to the forest equipped with arms. He hunted in the forest lots of boars, pigs, deer, and hare. But he was so very tired with his journey in the forest and got so hungry that he forgot everything about the Astaka S&#8217;râddha and ate one hare there in the forest. The remaining excellent meat he brought and handed over to his father. When that meat was brought to be sprinkled for purification, the family priest Vas&#8217;istha, on seeing it, at once came to know that some portion had already been eaten and it was the remaining part. The leavings of food are not fit for the sprinkling purposes; this is the S&#8217;âstric rule…&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 5.20.16-50 &#8220;&#8230;The Râjasik Brâhmanas were versed in the Vedas and acted as priests to the Ksattriyas and ate flesh as sanctioned by recognised rules. They were busy with their six duties&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Sons of Pandu killed many animals and offered them to Brahmins,</p>
<p>Mahabharata Book 3, Section 80 &#8220;And, O chief of the Bharata race, those mighty warriors endowed with great prowess slew with pure arrows various kinds of sacrificial animals for the Brahmanas. And those tigers among men and repressors of foes, daily slaying those wild animals and sanctifying them properly, offered them unto the Brahmanas.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Mahabharata Book 1, Section 116 says that Rishi Vyasa divided meat ball into 100 pieces and gave it to Gandhari so she can conceive 100 sons.</p>
<p>Munis also used to partake meat,</p>
<p>Mahabharata Book 3, Section 159 &#8220;Having heard from that one of incomparable energy, (Arshtishena), that advice conducive to their welfare, those foremost of the Bharatas, began to behave always accordingly. Those best of men, the Pandavas, dwelt upon the Himavan, partaking of the food eaten by the Munis, and luscious fruit, and the flesh of deer killed with unpoisoned shafts and various kinds of pure honey.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Mahabharata Book 2, Section 4 &#8220;Vaisampayana said,&#8211;&#8220;Then that chief of men, king Yudhishthira, entered that palatial sabha having first fed ten thousand Brahmanas with preparations of milk and rice mixed with clarified butter and honey with fruits and roots, and with pork and venison. The king gratified those superior Brahmanas, who had come from various countries with food seasoned with seasamum and prepared with vegetables called jibanti, with rice mixed with clarified butter, with different preparations of meat&#8211;with indeed various kinds of other food, as also numberless viands that are fit to be sucked and innumerable kinds of drinks, with new and unused robes and clothes, and with excellent floral wreaths.&#8221; Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Some Hindus might try to twist the Vedic verses by saying they does not mean what they say, they are allegorical. You cannot say verses from Manu Smriti, Upanishad, Brahmanas etc., are allegorical, all those verses including the Vedic verses on meat consumption are literal. There is no prohibition of meat consumption in Hindu scriptures, so Hindus should not just enjoy eating meat secretly at night but they should start eating openly during day also.</p>

<p>Read new article <a href="/index.php/2019/03/29/scientific-errors-in-hinduism/" data-wpel-link="internal">Scientific Errors in Hinduism</a></p>
<p>Hindus have become very enthusiastic in finding science in their holy books after they learnt that other religious texts have scientific facts. They are reinterpreting it, they are not aware of the fact that the writers of the Vedas were ignorant of science, as a result the Vedas contain several scientific errors. Ishwar should have studied kindergarten books, I am sure Vedas would have been scientific if he did that.</p>

<p><strong>EARTH IS IMMOVABLE/FIXED</strong></p>
<p>Atharva Veda 6.77.1 &#8220;The heavens have stood, the earth has stood, all creatures have stood. The mountains have stood upon their<br />
foundation, the horses in the stable I have caused to stand.&#8221; Tr. Maurice Bloomfield</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="681" height="246" class="wp-image-7396" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021.jpeg" alt="http://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/060218_0650_testingscie1.jpg" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021.jpeg 681w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-300x108.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 681px) 100vw, 681px" /></p>
<p>Some apologists argue that that the word &#8220;Asthaat&#8221; means &#8220;steady&#8221; and not fixed or standing still, this doubt can be cleared from the following verse,</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 6.44.1 &#8220;The heavens have stood still, the earth has stood still, all creatures have stood still. The trees that sleep erect have stood still: may this disease of thine stand still!&#8221; Tr. Maurice Bloomfield <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="595" height="72" class="wp-image-7397" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021.png" alt="http://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/060218_0650_testingscie2.png" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021.png 595w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-300x36.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 595px) 100vw, 595px" /></p>
<p>Above is Shripad Damodar Satvalekar&#8217;s Hindi translation and below is Kshemkarandas Trivedi&#8217;s translation,</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="556" height="138" class="wp-image-7398" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-1.png" alt="http://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/060218_0650_testingscie3.png" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-1.png 556w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-1-300x74.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 556px) 100vw, 556px" /></p>
<p>Both the Hindi verses translated by Kshemkaran Das Trivedi and Shripad Damodar Satvalekar has translated the word Asthaat as &#8220;Tehri hai&#8221; which means standing still but some people tries to twist this verse in the following way.<br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="781" height="144" class="wp-image-7399" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-1.jpeg" alt="http://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/060218_0650_testingscie4.jpg" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-1.jpeg 781w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-1-300x55.jpeg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-1-768x142.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 781px) 100vw, 781px" /></p>
<p>Scholar has cleverly translated the word &#8220;Prithvyasthaad&#8221; [Prithvi+Asthaat] as &#8220;Earth is firm&#8221; but then translates the same word as standing still [Tehra hai] when it comes it Trees and Malady. Atharva Veda 6.44.1 is a prayer to stop malady, it says that just as Earth is standing still, trees are standing still, world is standing still, the same way make this malady stand still. Now if we go with apologists definition then it would be like &#8220;Let this malady of your stand firm&#8221; and that would be illogical, isn&#8217;t it? If it&#8217;s just about firmness then why does it talk about trees? doesn&#8217;t trees shake with a gust of wind? Trees stands in its place and doesn&#8217;t move and it being compared to earth proves that earth is motionless according to Vedas.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rig Veda 10.149.1 Savitar has fixed the earth with supports ; Savitar has fastened heaven in unsupported space…</p>
<p>Nirukta 10.32 Savitar caused the earth to be fastened with supports. In the supportless atmosphere Savitar has made the heaven firm…</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 13.1.6 …Rohita with his might hath established Earth and Heaven.</p>

<p>.</p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.89.4, Sam Veda 4.1.5.8 Indra hath fixed [Stopped] the earth and heaven as with an axle…</p>
<p>Following is the Hindi translation by Pandit Ram Govind Trivedi</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="502" height="164" class="wp-image-7401" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-2.png" alt="http://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/060218_0650_testingscie6.png" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-2.png 502w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-2-300x98.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 502px) 100vw, 502px" /></p>
<p>Yajur Veda 5.16 pastures, fair to do men service. Both these worlds, Vishnu, hast thou stayed<br />
asunder, and firmly fixed the earth with pegs around it.<br />

<p>Above verse clearly uses the word &#8220;Drdh दृढ&#8221; which has several meaning like &#8220;Fixed, strong, firm&#8221; but mainly refers to something immovable which we shall further discuss in the article.</p>
<p>Rig Veda 3.30.4 …the heaven and <strong>earth<br />

[This verse is translated into English from Hindi Bhasya.]
<p>Rig Veda 10.173.4 4 Firm is the sky and firm the earth, and stedfast also are these hills. Stedfast is all this living world, and stedfast is this King of men.<br />

<p>An Indian scientist named Bhaskaracharya (1114-1185) wrote,</p>
<p>&#8221;As heat is an inherent property of the Sun and of Fire, as cold of the Moon, fluidity of water, and hardness of stones, and as the air is volatile, so the earth is naturally immovable. For oh! the properties existing on things are wonderful.&#8221;-Siddhanta Shiromani Goladhyaaya of Bhaskaracharya, Bhuvankosh, Shloka 5</p>
<p>Many verses clearly uses the word Drdh दृढ which means fixed but Hindus argue that it means firm, whether Drdh means fixed or firm can be better understood after reading Rig Veda 8.78.5; 10.173.4; Atharva Veda 6.88.1, 20.34.2, 19.32.9, 13.1.6-7 and Yajur Veda 1.17 which says the Earth is Fixed. The Atharva Veda 6.77.1 and 6.44.1 explicitly states that Earth is standing still (not moving). But still Hindus will argue that it doesn&#8217;t mean what it says. Then what was the logic behind Ishwar revealing so many verses on Earth&#8217;s &#8216;Stability&#8217;? It&#8217;s plain and clear, the earth is fixed according to the Vedas as proved from verses which says that Earth is standing still. Even if we accept their claim, then why does Vedas talk about Earth along with Heaven that the earth and heaven are firmly fixed? As per the Vedas both heaven and earth are immovable.</p>
<p><strong>HOW DO SKY/HEAVEN LOOKS LIKE</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.59.2 The forehead of the sky, earth&#8217;s centre, Agni became the messenger of earth and heaven. <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="73" height="73" class="wp-image-7407" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-4.jpeg" alt="http://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/060218_0650_testingscie12.jpg" /></p>

Those Hindus should thoroughly think about this verse, it states the 7 horses (rays according to you) TAKES the Sun, logically does the rays takes the Sun? The Sun emits rays, it does not go after the rays. So this explanation of 7 horses as 7 rays is illogical. Moreover even the scholars are not sure whether this means 7 rays or horses while few other regard 7 horses as 7 days. Veda says that Vushab (Sun or Bull) has thousand rays not seven rays. Other Hindu text affirms that the Seven Horses are actual Horses, below are the references,</p>
<p>Mahabharata book 13.158.20-22 …the sun possessed of a thousand rays… He it is that constitutes the wheel of the year, having three naves and seven horses to drag it…He is the sun, the dispeller of all darkness.</p>
<p>Bhagwad Purana (Srimad Bhagavatam) 5.21.12-19 Thus the chariot of the sun-god, which is trayimaya, or worshiped by the words om bhur bhuvah svah, travels through the four residences…My dear King, the carriage of the sun-god&#8217;s chariot is estimated to be 3,600,000 yojanas [28,800,000 miles] long and one-fourth as wide [900,000 yojanas, or 7,200,000 miles]. The chariot&#8217;s horses, which are named after Gayatri and other Vedic meters, are harnessed by Arunadeva to a yoke that is also 900,000 yojanas wide. This chariot continuously carries the sun-god. Although Arunadeva sits in front of the sun-god and is engaged in driving the chariot and controlling the horses, he looks backward toward the sun-god…My dear King, in his orbit through Bhu-mandala [Earth],<br />
the sun-god traverses a distance of 95,100,000 yojanas [760,800,000 miles] at the speed of 2,000 yojanas and two krosas [16,004 miles] in a moment.</p>
<p>Devi Bhagwatam 8.15.40-45 …The seat of the Sun on his chariot measures 36 Lakh Yoyanas wide. The Yuga measures in length one fourth of the above dimensions, that of his seat. The Chariot is moved by seven horses, consisting of the seven Chhandas, Gâyatrî, etc., driven by Aruna. The horses carry the Sun for the happiness of all. Though the charioteer sits in front of the Sun, his face is turned towards the west. He does his work as a charioteer in that state…</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana 1.2.23.50-51 &#8221;He is served by Gandharvas and groups of celestial damsels by means of sons and dances. The lord of the day (i.e. the sun) thus revolves and wanders by means of horses that gallop and that are as swift as birds. The chariot of Soma (the Moon) has three wheels. His horses have the lustre of Kunda (white jasmine) flowers. They are ten in number and they are yoked to the left as well as to the right. The moon traverses by means of this.&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, Edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>From the above passages it doesn&#8217;t sound like the horses are rays but it signifies that the Sun LITERALLY travels on a chariot dragged by seven horses. They no where says that the sun&#8217;s chariot pulled by horses is an allegorical sentence, rather they say exactly what they Vedas states. If the 7 horses of the sun are the seven rays then what are the 10 horses of the moon? Does it mean the moon emits rays of its own? with additional 3 rays?</p>
<p>The Vedas also says the Sun hides</p>
<p>Rig Veda 3.49.5 Where as a Friend with friendly men, Navagvas, with heroes, on his knees he sought the cattle.here, verily with ten Dasagvas Indra found the Sun lying hidden in the darkness.</p>

<p><strong>How Rain Occurs</strong></p>
<p>&#8221;The oblation full of cooked articles put into the fire, goes up to the sky. And returns there from full of rain.&#8221;- Yajur Veda 3.49, Tr. Devi Chand, p.43.</p>
<p>&#8221;We perform the yajna for Vasus, Rudras and Adityas&#8230;The desired oblation (Ahuti) reaches the space, comes in contact with air and the light of that sun. It thence brings down rain for us&#8230;&#8221;- Yajur Veda 2.16, Tr. Devi Chand, p.32-33.</p>
<p>It is mentioned in Brahmana,</p>
<p>Maitrayana Brahmaya 6.37 … &#8216;The oblation which is properly thrown on the fire, goes toward the sun; from the sun comes rain&#8230;&#8221; It is mentioned in Manu Smriti</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 3.76. An oblation duly thrown into the fire, reaches the sun; from the sun comes rain, from rain food, therefrom the living creatures (derive their subsistence).</p>
<p>Krishna says in Gita,<br />
Gita 3.14-15 All living bodies subsist on food grains, which are produced from rains. Rains are produced by performance of yajña [sacriﬁce], and yajña is born of prescribed duties. Regulated activities are prescribed in the Vedas, and the Vedas are directly manifested from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Consequently the all-pervading Transcendence is eternally situated in acts of sacriﬁce.</p>
<p>A Hindu scholar writes why the Sky looks blue and also how rain occurs,</p>
<p>&#8221;6. Is it not ether, then, that you see in the sky above, blue and dusty?</p>
<p>A.- No.</p>
<p>Q.- What is it then?</p>
<p>A. It is the fine particles of earth, water and Agni (in the atmosphere). The blue colour is  mainly due to the particles of water in the atmosphere that come down as rain, while the dusty appearance is due to the particles of dust which is carried up from the earth and floats about the air. It is these things that are seen and reflected in water in a mirror, and not ether.&#8221;- Satyarth Prakash, Swami Dayanand Saraswati, Ch 8, p.276, Tr. Chiranjiva Bhardwaja.</p>
<p><strong>EARTH IS FLAT</strong></p>
<p>Suppose If you were to describe that the earth is flat, how would you explain it? You might say earth has ends, earth has four corners and it is four cornered. Every sane person will give this same answer. When you see the article on scientific errors in Bible on Hindu websites, they have no problem quoting a verse from the Bible which says earth has four corners, but have they ever wondered what their scripture says about it.</p>
<p>Rig Veda 7.83.3 The ends of the earth are beheld laid waste…<br />

<p><strong>अंत [Anta]= End</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 8.25.18 He who hath measured with his ray the boundaries [ends] of heaven and earth..<br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="550" height="195" class="wp-image-7457" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-30.png" alt="http://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/060218_0651_testingscie29.png" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-30.png 550w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-30-300x106.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /></p>
<p>The word used in the above verse is Puthvi which means earth, some Hindus may try to escape the argument saying boundaries of Bhumi [land or earth] refers the actual boundaries of nations, but the above verse uses the term Puthvi which particularly refers to earth. The word boundary here is signifying the limits of Earth.</p>

<p><strong>Vedas explicitly states Earth is Four Cornered</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.58.3 Thy spirit, that went far away, away to the four cornered earth.<br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="526" height="37" class="wp-image-7461" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-31.png" alt="http://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/060218_0651_testingscie33.png" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-31.png 526w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-31-300x21.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 526px) 100vw, 526px" /></p>
<p>Word by Word Sansksrit translation,</p>
<p>यते [Yate] = Your</p>
<p>मन [Mann] = Spirit/Mind</p>
<p>जगाम [Jagaam] = Goes</p>
<p>दूरकम् [Durkam] = Far away</p>
<p>चतुर्भृष्टि [Chaturbhushti/Caturbhrsti] = Four Cornered</p>
<p>भूमि [Bhumi] = Earth</p>
<p>The word Chaturbhusti (also spelled Caturbhrsti) means Four cornered,</p>
<p>Monier-William&#8217;s Sanskrit dictionary also gives the same meaning</p>
<p><a href="http://sanskritdictionary.com/caturbh%E1%B9%9B%E1%B9%A3%E1%B9%ADi/78694/1" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">http://sanskritdictionary.com/caturbh%E1%B9%9B%E1%B9%A3%E1%B9%ADi/78694/1<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>Moreover the Brahmanas affirms this verse,</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahman 6.1.2.29 …Now this earth is four-cornered, for the quarters are her corners: hence the bricks are four-cornered; for all the bricks are after the manner of this earth.</p>
<p>Now, still some would argue that Rigved verse is not in literal sense and refers to earth as four cornered symbolically. If it really referred to earth as four cornered &#8221;Symbolically&#8221; then the Brahmanas would not have likened the shape of the earth with a brick. This verse from the Brahmanas could have been rejected if it was contradictory to the Vedas but both the Vedas and Brahmana says the same thing that the Earth if Four Cornered. A globe cannot have corners, These verses proves that earth is flat as per the Vedas.</p>

<p><strong>The Earth is stretched out</strong></p>
<p>There is no problem if the Vedas says the earth is stretched out, but after reading about the four cornered earth verses, these verses could be understood in a different manner that the earth is stretched out on all the four corners.</p>
<p>Rig Veda 3.6.5 Great are the deeds of thee, the Great, O Agni: thou by thy power hast spread out earth and heaven.<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By Sulaiman Razvi</p>
<p>Hindu god allows lying on five occasions especially while enjoying a woman, Krishna said,<br />
Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Krishna Janma Khanda 98.38-44 &#8221;&#8230;Hari began to laugh and thus addressed Uddhava, using words of good import and worlds sanctioned by the Vedas, &#8221;O Uddhava, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;">untruth spoken to women or on the sporting ground</span></span>, or in an emergency which endangers life or for the good of the vows or the Brahmin is not contemptible&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Rajendra Nath Sen<br />
<span id="more-1973"></span><br />
Matysa Purana 31.16 &#8221;Sarmistha said:- &#8221;King! <span style="color: #ff0000;">there is no sin in speaking untruth at the time of indulging in sexual pleasure</span>s, on the occasion of marriage, when life is in danger, wealth is at stake, and in joke. Lying on these five occasions is venal.&#8221; Tr. Various Sanskrit Scholars, Edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>Mahabharata 8.69 &#8221;In a situation of peril to life and in marriage, falsehood becomes utterable. In a situation involving the loss of one&#8217;s entire property, falsehood becomes utterable. On an occasion of marriage, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;">or of enjoying a woman</span></span>, or when life is in danger, or when one&#8217;s entire property is about to be taken away, or for the sake of a Brahmana, falsehood may be uttered. These five kinds of falsehood have been declared to be sinless. On these occasions falsehood would become truth and truth would become falsehood.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mahabharata 1.82 &#8220;Sarmishtha then said, &#8216;It hath been said, O king, that it is not sinful to lie on the occasion of a joke, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;">in respect of women sought to be enjoyed</span></span>, on occasions of marriage, in peril of immediate death and of the loss of one&#8217;s whole fortune. Lying is excusable on these five occasions.&#8221; Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Vasishtha Samhita 16.35 (Men) may speak an untruth at the time of marriage, during dalliance, when their lives are in danger or the loss of their whole property is imminent, and for the sake of a Brâhmana; they declare that an untruth spoken in these five cases does not make (the speaker) an outcast.</p>
<p>Gautama Samhita 23.29 Some (declare, that) an untruth (spoken) at the time of marriage, during dalliance, in jest or while (one suffers severe) pain is venial.</p>
<p>So Krishna allows lying for personal benefits. No wonder why so many Hindu fanatics use lie and deceit to mock others. Many Hindus are unaware of these verses and they mock others by using their own invented lies. A verse in Rigved states that Vedic God Indra slew Sushna by Maya (deception),</p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.11.7 &#8220;Thou slewest, Indra, by stratagems, the wily Sushna: the wise have known of this thy (greatness)&#8230;&#8221; Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Swami Dayanand Saraswati the founder of Arya Samaj wrote in his commentary on this verse,</p>
<p>&#8220;God commands that highly intelligent persons should overthrow enemies by using all legitimate means consisting of persuasion (Saam), bribery (Daam), Dand (punishment) and Bhed (polarization, divide and rule, blackmail)&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>This was also Chankya Niti, Chanakya wrote,</p>
<p>Arthashastra of Kautilya Chapter 10 &#8220;&#8230;Negotiation, bribery, causing dissension, and open attack are forms of stratagem (upaya)&#8230;Offering money is bribery (upapradana). Causing fears and suspicion as well as threatening is known as sowing dissesion. Killing, harassing, and plundering is attack (danda)&#8230;&#8221; Tr. R. Shamasastry</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Swami Dayanand Saraswati also advocates lying to propagate ones faith he writes,</p>
<p>“Now it must be understood that if it was the belief of Shankar that God and the human soul were identical and that the world was an illusion, it was not good; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">but if he had avowed this doctrine simply in order to refute Jainism more successfully, it was a little good</span><strong>.</strong>” Satyarth Prakash, by Swami Dayanand Saraswati, Chapter 11, Tr. Chiranjiva Bhardwaja</p>
<p>He means if one lies just to demean others faith in order to propagate the Vedic faith then it is a good thing. Swami Prabhupada the founder of ISKCON had similar views,<br />
‘’According to Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;">Ś</span><span style="color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;">rīpāda Śaṅkarācārya preached the Māyāvāda philosophy for a particular purpose. Such a philosophy was necessary to defeat the Buddhist philosophy</span></span> of the nonexistence of the spirit soul, but it was never meant for perpetual acceptance. It was an emergency. Thus Lord Kṛṣṇa was accepted by Śaṅkarācārya as the Supreme Personality of Godhead in his commentation on Bhagavad-gītā.’’ By A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, Srimad Bhagavatam 3.4.20 <a href="http://www.vedabase.com/en/sb/3/4/20" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">http://www.vedabase.com/en/sb/3/4/20<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>Swami Prabhupada also wrote,<br />
&#8220;In this regard, it is stated in the Padma Purana that Lord Siva appeared as a brahmana in the age of Kali to preach the Mayavada philosophy, which is nothing but a type of Buddhist philosophy. It is stated in Padma Purana: Lord Siva, speaking to Parvati-devi, foretold that he would spread the Mayavada philosophy in the guise of a sannyasi brahmana just to eradicate Buddhist philosophy. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;">This sannyasi was Sripada Sankaracarya. In order to overcome the effects of Buddhist philosophy and spread Vedanta philosophy, Sripada Sankaracarya had to make some compromise with the Buddhist philosophy, and as such he preached the philosophy of monism, for it was required at that time</span></span>. Otherwise there was no need for his preaching Mayavada philosophy. At the present moment there is no need for Mayavada philosophy or Buddhist philosophy, and Lord Caitanya rejected both of them. This Krishna consciousness movement is spreading the philosophy of Lord Caitanya and rejecting the philosophy of both classes of Mayavadi. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;">Strictly speaking, both Buddhist philosophy and Sankara&#8217;s philosophy are but different types of Mayavada dealing on the platform of material existence. Neither of these philosophies has spiritual significance</span></span>. There is spiritual significance only after one accepts the philosophy of Bhagavad-gita, which culminates in surrendering unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Generally people worship Lord Siva for some material benefit, and although they cannot see him personally, they derive great material profit by worshiping him.&#8221; <strong>Swami Prabhupada on Srimad Bhagavatam 4.24.17 </strong><a href="http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_4.24.17" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_4.24.17<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>So both Swami Prabhupada and Dayanand says that it&#8217;s OK to lie and deceive to propagate ones faith. Also read <a href="/index.php/2015/06/25/hindu-god-is-a-cheat/" data-wpel-link="internal">Hindu god is a cheater</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am reproducing some excerpts written by a Hindu scholar named Swami B.V. Giri. Who has proved Puranas and Itihas as part of the Vedas which is contrary to what Arya Samajis are promoting on the internet. He considers Puranas and Itihas to be the fifth Vedas, he has put forth this arguement on the basis of Vedas and other scriptures. According to Swami Giri Vedas are corrupted and 94% of the Vedas are lost, the present Vedas contain only 6% of the original text and there is no use of Vedas in this age thus Puranas are much superior than Vedas.<br />
<span id="more-1960"></span><br />
Written by Swami B.V. Giri</p>
<p><strong>OBJECTION: In your arguments you have mostly quoted <em>purana-vakya</em> (quotes from Puranic texts) to substantiate your points. However, this is unacceptable. The <em>Vedas</em> are eternal as they emanate from the Lord Himself (<em>apaurusaya</em>), whereas the <em>Puranas</em> and <em>smrti-sastras</em>, although they give knowledge about God, are authored by men. They are auxiliary to the <em>Vedas</em> and hence their statements should be considered as secondary when compared to the statements made in the <em>Vedas</em>. Therefore, in order to validate your claims, you must give quotes from <em>sruti</em> only.</strong></p>
<p><strong>REFUTATION:</strong> That the <em>Vedas</em> are eternal and <em>apauruseya</em> is a fact that all <em>sampradayas</em>, including the school of Sankara, unanimously agree with. They constitute the means of receiving knowledge about the Absolute Truth. However, there are certain factors that make it practically impossible to study the <em>Vedas</em> in this age:</p>
<p id="pWEIpKn"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="288" height="239" class="size-full wp-image-7205  alignleft" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/img_5f23fe9dbeb17.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>  After Srila Vyasadeva divided the <em>Vedas</em> into four books (<em>Rg, Yajur, Sama</em> and <em>Atharva</em>), his disciples further divided them into 1,130 divisions. This is stated in the <em>Kurma Purana</em> (52.19-20):</p>
<p class="verse"><em>eka-vimsati-bhedena rg-vedam krtavan pura<br />
sakhanam satenaiva yajur-vedam athakarot</em></p>
<p class="verse"><em>sama-vedam sahasrena sakhanam prabibheda sah<br />
atharvanam atho vedam bibedha navakena tu</em></p>
<p class="translation">‘Previously the <em>Rg Veda</em> was divided into 21 sections, the <em>Yajur Veda</em> into 100 sections, the <em>Sama Veda</em> into 1,000 sections and the <em>Atharva Veda</em> into 9 divisions.’</p>
<p>Each division has 4 minor divisions, namely the <em>Samhitas, Brahmanas, Aranyakas</em> and <em>Upanisads.</em> Thus altogether the 4 <em>Vedas</em> contain 1,130 <em>Samhitas,</em> 1,130 <em>Brahmanas,</em> 1,130 <em>Aranyakas,</em> and 1,130 <em>Upanisads.</em> This makes a total of 4,520 divisions.<br />
At present, most of these texts have disappeared due to the influence of time. We can only find 11 <em>Samhitas</em>, 18 <em>Brahmanas</em>, 7 <em>Aranyakas</em> and 220 <em>Upanisads</em> which constitutes a mere 6% of the entire Vedic canon!</p>
<ol>
<li>Even if the <em>Vedas</em> were complete in there entirety, in order to understand them one must first study the <em>Vedangas</em> which includes <em>Siksa</em> (the science of phonetics), <em>Vyakarana</em> (grammatical rules), <em>Kalpa</em> (ritualistic rules), <em>Nirukta</em> (obscure word meanings), <em>Chanda</em> (Metres for chanting Vedic hymns), and <em>Jyotisa</em> (astrology and astronomy).</li>
<li>Since the language of the <em>Vedas</em> is enshrouded in mysterious meanings, one must also be willing to sacrifice years of study in order to learn <em>Vaidika</em> (classical) Sanskrit. This entails primarily learning the basic grammar (which generally takes 12 years or so) and then memorising extra vocabulary in order to decipher the mystical language of the <em>Vedas</em>. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">1</span></li>
</ol>
<p>Apart from that, it is practically impossible for those born in the age of Kali (who are generally ‘<em>mandah sumanda-matayo</em>’) to memorise even the slightest thing. What to speak of the entire <em>Vedas</em> or even the 6% that still survives today! At present, amongst the <em>brahmana</em> communities in India, it is generally observed that <em>vedadhyayana</em> simply consists of memorising the text of one of the four <em>Vedas</em> ‘parrot-fashion’, but as we can see from above, there is much more to it than that. Therefore, we may conclude that although the <em>Vedas</em> are perfect <em>sabda-pramana</em>, it is impractical to become thoroughly conversant with the <em>Vedas</em> in this day and age in order to understand the Supreme. Hence the solution lies in the <em>Puranas</em> and the <em>Itihasas.</em> This is explained in the following verse &#8211;</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light">
<p class="verse"><em> bharata-vyapadesena hyamnayarthah pradarsitah<br />
vedah pratisthah sarve sarve purane natra samsayah</em></p>
<p class="translation">&#8220;On the pretext of writing the <em>Mahabharata</em>, Vyasa explained the meaning of the <em>Vedas</em>. Certainly all the topics of the <em>Vedas</em> have been established in the <em>Puranas.</em>&#8221; (<em>Visnu Purana</em>)</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is explained in the <em>Mahabharata</em> (<em>Adi Parva</em> 1.267) and <em>Manu Samhita</em> –</p>
<p class="verse"><em>itihasa puranabhyam vedam samupabrmhayet</em></p>
<p class="translation">&#8221; One must complement one’s study of the <em>Vedas</em> with the <em>Itihasas</em> and the <em>Puranas.</em>&#8220;</p>
<p>In the <em>Prabhasa-khanda</em> of the <em>Skanda Purana</em> (5.3.121-124) it is said –</p>
<p class="verse"><em>veda-van niscalam manye puranartham dvijottamah<br />
vedah pratisthitah sarve purane natra samsayah</em></p>
<p class="verse"><em>bibhety-alpa-srutad vedo mam ayam calayisyati<br />
itihasa-puranais tu niscalo’yam krtah purah</em></p>
<p class="verse"><em>yan na drstam hi vedesu tad drstam smrtisu dvijah<br />
ubhayor yan na drstam hi tat puranah pragiyate<br />
yo veda caturo vedan sangopanisado dvijah<br />
puranam naiva janati na ca sa syad vicaksana</em></p>
<p class="translation">&#8221; O best of the <em>brahmanas</em>, the meaning of the <em>Puranas</em> is unchanging just like that of the <em>Vedas</em>. The <em>Vedas</em> are all sheltered within the <em>Puranas</em> without a doubt. The <em>Veda</em> has a fear that unqualified people will read her and then distort her meaning. Thus, the significance of the <em>Veda</em> was fixed in the <em>Puranas</em> and <em>Itihasas.</em> That which is not found in the <em>Vedas</em> is found in the <em>Smrti</em>. That which is not found in the <em>Smrti</em> is to be found in the <em>Puranas</em>. Those who know even the <em>Vedas</em> and <em>Upanisads</em> are not learned if they do not know the <em>Puranas</em>.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p id="AUanNYs"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="262" height="155" class="size-full wp-image-7206  alignright" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/img_5f23febf07008.png" alt="" /></p>
<p> The reason they are called ‘<em>Puranas</em>’ is because they make the <em>Vedas</em> complete (<em>puranat puranam iti canyatra</em>). This is not to suggest that the <em>Vedas</em> are incomplete. It simply means that the <em>Puranas</em> are explanatory supplements which aid one to understand the concise and ambiguous passages in the <em>Vedas.</em> If the <em>Puranas</em> complete the <em>Vedas</em>, it is only logical that they must be Vedic in nature.<br />
Our Tattvavadi friends have stated that <em>Puranic</em> evidence is secondary to those statements of the <em>sruti</em> because they are composed by mortals. Generally it is correct to state that the <em>sruti</em> is primary and the <em>smrti</em> secondary in that it (<em>sruti</em>) seeks to elaborate on the meaning of the <em>smrti.</em> However, under the circumstances, the <em>puranas</em> and <em>itihasas</em> are now to be considered primary evidence. As regards the mortal composition of the <em>puranas</em> and <em>Itihasas</em>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">2</span> we beg to differ with this view, on the basis of the following references in the <em>sruti-sastras</em></p>
<blockquote class="quote-light">
<p class="verse"><em>rcah samani chandamsi puranam yajusa saha<br />
ucchistaj-jajnire sarve divi deva divi-sritah</em></p>
<p class="translation">&#8220;The <em>Rg, Sama, Yajur</em> and <em>Atharva</em> became manifest from the Lord, along with the <em>Puranas</em> and all the Devas residing in the heavens.&#8221; (<em>Atharva Veda</em> 11.7.24)</p>
<p class="verse"><em>sa brhatim disam anu vyacalat tam itihasas ca puranam ca gathas ca itihasasya ca sa vai puranasya ca gathanam ca narasamsinam ca priyam dhama bhavati ya evam veda</em></p>
<p class="translation">&#8220;He approached the <em>brhati</em> meter, and thus the <em>Itihasas, Puranas, Gathas</em> and <em>Narasamsis</em> became favorable to him. One who knows this verily becomes the beloved abode of the <em>Itihasas, Puranas, Gathas</em> and <em>Narasamsis</em>.&#8221; (<em>Atharva Veda</em> 15.6.10–12)</p>
<p class="verse"><em>evam ime sarva veda nirmitah sa-kalpah sa-rahasyah sa-brahmanah sopanisatkah setihasah sanvakhyatah sa-puranan</em></p>
<p class="translation">&#8220;In this way, all the <em>Vedas</em> were manifested along with <em>the Kalpas, Rahasyas, Brahmanas, Upanisads, Itihasas, Anvakhyatas</em> and the <em>Puranas.&#8221;</em> (<em>Gopatha Brahmana, purva</em> 2.10)</p>
<p class="verse"><em>nama va rg-vedo yajur-vedah sama-veda atharvanas caturtha itihasa-puranah pancamo vedanam vedah</em></p>
<p class="translation">&#8220;Indeed, <em>Rg, Yajur, Sama</em> and <em>Atharva</em> are the names of the four <em>Vedas.</em> The <em>Itihasas</em> and <em>Puranas</em> are the fifth <em>Veda.&#8221; (Kauthumiya Chandogya Upanisad 7.1.4)</em></p>
<p class="verse"><em>asya mahato bhutasya nihsvasitam etad yad rg-vedo yajur-vedah sama<br />
vedo’tharvangirasa itihasah puranam ityadina</em></p>
<p class="translation">&#8220;O Maitreya, the <em>Rg, Yajur, Sama</em> and <em>Atharva Vedas</em> as well as the <em>Itihasas</em> and the <em>Puranas</em> all manifest from the breathing of the Lord.&#8221; <em>(Madhyandina-sruti, Brhad-aranyaka Upanisad</em> 2.4.10)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From these above <em>sruti</em> statements it is clear that the <em>puranas</em> are part of the <em>Vedas</em> and originate from the same source as the <em>Vedas</em>, namely the Supreme Lord Himself. One may argue that since the <em>Puranas</em> have names such as <em>Skanda, Agni, Markandeya</em> etc. they must have been composed by those personalities, therefore they are not eternal and thus cannot be apauruseya. However, if that is the case, then certain sections of the <em>Vedas</em> must also be considered to be <em>pauruseya-vakya</em> since they have names like <em>Katha</em> <em>Upanisad, Aitareya Upanisad</em> (Katha and Aitareya being names of sages). It is understood that certain parts of the <em>Vedas</em> are named after certain <em>rsis,</em> not because they composed them, but because they were the main exponents of those portions. Since persons with the names <em>Katha</em> and <em>Aitareya</em> appear in every millenium, one should not misunderstand that before the appearance of those persons described in the <em>Vedas</em>, these names were simply meaningless words.</p>
<p id="nPGgFwG"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="252" height="171" class="size-full wp-image-7207  alignleft" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/img_5f23fed3311f7.png" alt="" /></p>
<p> Similarly many of the <em>Puranas</em> are named after the first person who expounded them. Many times however, due to the influence of time, a scripture may become forgotten on this planet and thus a deva or sage speaks it again, and it becomes known by that name. Such an example is found in the <em>Bhagavatam</em> wherein the sun-god imparts the <em>Vajasaneyi-samhita</em> of the <em>Yajur Veda</em> to Yajnavalkya Muni –</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light">
<p class="verse"><em>atha ha bhagavams tava carana-nalina-yugalam tri-bhuvana-gurubhir<br />
abhivanditam aham ayata-yama-yajus-kama upasaramiti.</em></p>
<p class="verse"><em>evam stutam sa bhagavan vaji-rupa-dharo ravih<br />
yajumsy ayata-yamani munaye ’dat prasaditah</em></p>
<p class="translation">&#8220;Therefore, O lord, with prayers I approach your two lotus feet, which are adored by the preceptors of the three worlds, because I wish to receive from you <em>mantras</em> of the <em>Yajur Veda</em> that are unknown to anyone else.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Being pleased by such exaltation, the sun-god took the form of a horse and presented to the <em>muni</em> <em>mantras</em> of the <em>Yajur Veda</em> which were previously unknown to any mortal.&#8221; (<em>Bhagavata</em> 12.6.72-73)</p>
<p>In his treatise Visnu Tattva Vinirnaya, Sri Madhva, quoting Brahmanda Purana explains thus:</p>
<p class="verse"><em>puranani tadarthani sarge sarge’nythaiva tu<br />
kriyante’tastvanityani tadarthah purva-sargavat<br />
vedanam srsthivakyani bhaveyurvyaktyapeksaya<br />
avantarabhimananam devanam va vyapeksaya<br />
nanityatvat kutastesamanityatvam sthiratmanam</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, the <em>Puranas</em> are supposed to explain the meaning of the <em>Vedas</em> and are only different by the changes in words, chanda (metre), rsi, sequence etc. at the beginning of each creation. In this way they are considered to be non-eternal, but their meaning will be the same as in the previous creation.<br />
Therefore Madhva categorizes the <em>Puranas</em> as <em>‘nitya-anitya’</em> because they originally emanate from the Supreme Lord, but they are sometimes unmanifest.<br />
As a side note, it may be asked that if the <em>Puranas</em> are indeed subsidiary to the <em>sruti-sastras,</em> why does Sri Madhvacarya himself quote them so often in his works? Not only that, he even uses <em>puranic</em> evidence in order to establish the <em>nityatva</em> of the <em>Vedas!</em> If the <em>Puranas</em> are not eternal and <em>apauruseya,</em> why would he use their ‘secondary statements’ as a <em>pramana</em> to validify something which is superior?<br />
Another point is that in the chanting of the <em>Brahma-yajna</em> (formal study of the <em>Vedas</em>), the <em>Puranas</em> are included. If they were not <em>Vedic</em> in nature they would not be included. Therefore the <em>Taittiriya Aranyaka</em> (2.9) states <em>yad brahmananitihasa-puranani</em>: &#8220;The <em>Itihasas</em> and <em>Puranas</em> are <em>Vedas.&#8221;</em><br />
It has already been stated above in the quote from <em>Chandogya Upanisad</em> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">3</span> that the <em>Puranas</em> are known as the fifth Veda. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">4</span> The reason behind this is because the <em>Puranas</em> and <em>Itihasas</em> are derived originally from the <em>Yajur Veda.</em> This is explained by <em>Sri Suta</em> in the <em>Vayu Purana-</em></p>
<blockquote class="quote-light">

In the beginning there was only one <em>Veda</em> – the <em>Yajur Veda</em>. This was divided into four portions. From these stemmed the four performances known as the <em>catur-homa</em> by which he (Vyasa) arranged for the performance of sacrifice. The <em>Adhvaryu</em> priest uses the <em>Yajur mantras,</em> the <em>Hotra</em> priest uses the <em>Rg mantras,</em> the <em>Udgata</em> priest uses the <em>Sama mantras,</em> and the <em>Brahma</em> priest uses the <em>Atharva mantras.</em></p>

</blockquote>
<p>The statement of Sri Suta Gosvami in the above verse from <em>Vayu Purana</em> in which he says that ‘Whatever remained after Vyasa had divided the <em>Vedas</em> into four divisions was considered to also be the <em>Yajur Veda</em>’ indicates that the essence of the original <em>Purana</em> (which was the remaining part of the <em>Yajur Veda</em>) became the condensed version of the <em>Purana</em> consisting of four-hundred-thousand <em>slokas</em>, available on the earth-planet.<br />
Further evidence for this is found in the <em>Matsya Purana</em> (53.8-9)wherein the Lord says –</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light">
<p class="verse"><em>kalenagrahanam matva puranasya dvijottamah<br />
vyasa-rupam aham krtva samharami yuge yuge</em></p>
<p class="translation">&#8220;O best of the <em>brahmanas</em>, understanding that the <em>Purana</em> would gradually become forgotten, in every <em>yuga</em> I appear in the form of Vyasa and condense it.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the next <em>sloka</em> of that <em>Purana</em>, the Lord continues –</p>
<p class="verse"><em> catur-laksa-pramanena dvapare dvapare sada<br />
tad astadasadha krtva</em> <em>bhur-loke’smin prabhasyate<br />
adyapyamartya-loke tu sata-koti-pravistaram<br />
tad artho’tra catur-laksah sanksepena nivesitah</em></p>
<p class="translation">&#8220;The <em>Purana</em> contains four-hundred-thousand verses which is divided into eighteen parts. These are passed on via oral tradition every Dvapara-yuga on the earth-planet. Even today the original <em>Purana</em> which consists of one-billion verses exists in the heavenly planets. The essential meaning of that <em>Purana</em> is contained in the smaller version of four-hundred-thousand verses.&#8221;</p>
<p>The same point is raised in the <em>Vayaviya Samhita</em> (7.1.1. 37-38) –</p>
<p class="verse"><em>sanksipya caturo vedams caturdha vyabhajat prabhuh<br />
vyasta-vedataya khyato veda-vyasa iti smrtah<br />

<p class="verse"><em>sanksiptam ityatra teneti sesah</em></p>
<p class="translation">&#8220;That Lord who is most intelligent then divided the <em>Vedas</em> into four. He therefore became known as Veda Vyasa. He also summarized the <em>Puranas</em> into four-hundred-thousand verses which are still available in the heavenly domain in the form if one billion verses.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, it should be explained that although the <em>Puranas</em> and <em>Itihasas</em> are known as the fifth <em>Veda —</em> that does not mean that they are literally identical in all ways with the <em>Vedas</em>. If that were so, <em>Purana</em> and <em>Itihasa</em> would just be names of certain sections of the <em>Vedas</em>. The difference between them is in annotation and the order of words. The <em>Vedas</em> are chanted in a particular style involving three tone accents (<em>svaras</em>) called <em>udatta</em>, <em>anudatta</em> and <em>svarita</em>. If a word is chanted in the wrong accent, the whole meaning of the sentence can change.<br />
As regards the order of words, the <em>Vedas</em> maintain a particular sequence which has not changed since the dawn of creation. There is no scope for even the slightest change in the Vedic texts, whereas the texts of the <em>Puranas</em> change according to <em>kalpa-bheda</em>. It is for this reason that we find occasional differencies in certain editions of the <em>Puranas.</em><br />
Another distinction between the <em>Vedas</em> and the <em>Puranas</em> is that although the <em>Puranas</em> are considered part of the <em>Brahma-yajna</em>, they are not used in the performance of Vedic sacrifices.<br />
Unfortunately, major problems also arise when trying to studsy the <em>Puranas.</em> Firstly, although the <em>Puranas</em> are much more accessible than the <em>Vedas</em> and more readily available, they too are not available in their entirety. The eighteen <em>Puranas</em> and eighteen <em>Upa-Puranas</em> are a vast body of literature and there are so many different versions that it is difficult to know which editions are complete and which texts have been interpolated. This is due to the fact that there are no current disciplic schools nor bona-fide commentaries for most of these works.<br />
Secondly, we can understand that independent study of the <em>Puranas</em> yields no fruit since each seems to establish a different deity as Supreme. By studying the <em>Puranas</em> without proper guidance, the result is only confusion. <em>Matsya Purana</em> (53.65, 68-69) states –</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light">
<p class="verse"><em>pancangam ca puranam syad akhyanam itarat smrtam<br />
sattvikesu ca kalpesu mahatmyam adhikam hareh<br />
rajasesu ca mahatmyam adhikam brahmano viduh<br />

<p class="translation">&#8221; A <em>Purana</em> consists of five elements, as opposed to an <em>Akhyana</em>. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">6</span> The <em>sattvika</em> <em>Puranas</em> glorify Hari; the <em>rajasika Puranas</em> glorify Brahma, and the <em>tamasika</em> <em>Puranas</em> glorify Siva and Agni. <em>Puranas</em> dealing with mixed modes of nature glorify Sarasvati and the fore-fathers.&#8221; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">7</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The divisions of the eighteen <em>Puranas</em> is defined by Lord Siva to Uma in the <em>Padma Purana</em> (<em>Uttara Khanda</em> 236.18-21):</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light">
<p class="verse"><em>vaisnavanam naradiyam ca tatha bhagavatam subham<br />
garudam ca tatha padmam varaham subha-darsane</em></p>
<p class="verse"><em>sattvikani puranani vijneyani subhani vai<br />
brahmandam brahma-vaivarta markandeyam tathaiva ca<br />
bhavisyam vamanam brahmam rajasani nibodha me<br />
matsyam kaurmam tatha laingam saivam skandam tathaiva ca<br />
agneyam ca sad etani tamasani nibodha me</em></p>
<p class="translation">&#8221; O beautiful lady, one should know that the <em>Visnu, Naradiya, Bhagavata, Garuda, Padma</em> and <em>Varaha</em> are all in the mode of goodness. The <em>Brahmanda, Brahma-vaivarta, Markandeya, Bhavisya, Vamana</em> and <em>Brahma</em> are in the mode of passion. The <em>Matsya, Kurma, Linga, Siva, Skanda</em> and <em>Agni</em> are in the mode of ignorance.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sri Krsna has clearly expressed in <em>Bhagavad-gita</em> that goodness is superior to passion and ignorance. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">8</span> Similarly, Sri Suta Gosvami explains in the <em>Bhagavata</em>(1.2.24) that &#8220;Passion is better than ignorance because it can lead to realization of the Absolute Truth.&#8221;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">9</span> In this verse Suta speaks about which type of worship produces the ultimate benefit, and his conclusion is that one can only achieve the best result by worshipping Lord Visnu. The <em>sattvika Puranas</em> recommend the worship of Visnu / Krsna, whereas the <em>rajasika</em> and <em>tamasika Puranas</em> advocate the worship of minor deities and therefore do not lead the aspirant towards the Absolute Truth.<br />
It is noteworthy that the <em>sattvika Puranas</em> commence with a questioner inquiring from a learned speaker about the nature of the Absolute. The speaker’s answers are clear, direct and unambiguous, leaving no room for misinterpretation. However, in the <em>tamasika</em> and <em>rajasika Puranas</em> questions are put to the speaker which do not pertain to the Absolute Truth. For example, in the <em>Linga Purana</em> the sages request Suta to speak about the glories of the Lingam form of Lord Siva. We may conclude from this that although Sri Suta Gosvami is learned in transcendental subject matters and expert in explaining them, the questions by the sages here restrict him from speaking on it. All <em>rajasika</em> and <em>tamasika</em> <em>Puranas</em> contain this characteristic defect and therefore are not reliable sources of transcendental knowledge.<br />
One may ask at this point why Srila Vyasadeva wrote these <em>Puranas.</em> According to the various desires of the materially conditioned <em>jivas</em>, he arranged the <em>Puranas</em>. Nevertheless, all <em>Puranas</em> contain glorification of Lord Visnu. This was included by Vyasa in order that those in the lower modes of passion and ignorance will slowly develop interest in the Supreme Lord Hari while studying the <em>rajasika</em> and <em>tamasika Puranas.</em> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">10</span>Therefore in the <em>Hari Vamsa</em> (3.323.34)it is said –</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light">
<p class="verse"><em>vede ramayane caiva purane bharate tatha<br />
adav-ante ca madhye ca harih sarvatra giyate</em></p>
<p class="translation">&#8220;In the <em>Vedas</em>, the <em>Ramayana, Puranas</em> and <em>Mahabharata</em>, from the very beginning to the end, as well as within the middle, only Hari, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is explained.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yet it must be understood that although <em>rajasika</em> and <em>tamasika Puranas</em> do not speak extensively on the Absolute Truth, this does not mean that they give no valid knowledge at all. If this was the case why would <em>acaryas</em> such as Madhva cite from <em>Puranas</em> such as <em>Skanda, Brahma, Brahmanda, Brahma-vaivarta</em> etc which are not <em>sattvika</em> by nature? The <em>Puranas</em> in the lower modes may also give some insight into the Absolute Truth, although not to the same extent as the <em>sattvika Puranas.</em><br />
By this we may conclude that the <em>sattvika Puranas</em> are the ultimate <em>pramana</em>. This is also declared by the <em>Padma Purana &#8211; sattvika moksa-dah proktah: </em>&#8220;The <em>sattvika Puranas</em> give salvation.&#8221; Unfortunatly, as stated before, there are no current disciplic schools nor bona-fide commentaries for most of these works. Some of the <em>sattvika Puranas</em> recommend the path of <em>bhakti,</em> while others glorify the path of <em>jnana</em> or <em>yoga.</em><br />
One possibility to resolve this dilemma is to study the <em>Vedanta-sutra</em>. This work of Vyasadeva contains the essence of the <em>Vedas</em> and the <em>Puranas.</em> Still, the language of the <em>Vedanta-sutras</em> is ambiguous to say the least, and has therefore been interpreted in a number of ways by numerous scholars ( Madhva, Sankara, Ramanuja, Bhaskara, Bodhayana, Dramida, Guhadeva to name but a few). The foundations of many of the <em>sutras</em> lie in Upanisadic passages, yet Vyasa does not mention in his work as to which passages the particular <em>sutra</em> is commenting on. Thus both the student and the commentator must determine this for themselves. It is no wonder then that Vedavyasa felt discontent even after compiling the <em>Vedas</em>, <em>Puranas</em>, <em>Mahabharata</em> and <em>Vedanta-sutra &#8211;</em></p>
<blockquote class="quote-light">
<p class="verse"><em>tathapi bata me daihyo hy atma caivatmana vibhuh<br />
asampanna ivabhati brahma-varcasya sattamah</em></p>
<p class="translation">&#8220;I am feeling incomplete, although I am fully equipped with everything required by the <em>Vedas</em>.&#8221; (<em>Bhagavata</em> 1.4.30)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reason for his discontentment was then explained by Narada Muni –</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light">
<p class="verse"><em>jijnasitam susampannam api te mahad-adbhutam<br />
krtavan bharatam yas tvam sarvartha-paribrmhitam</em></p>

</em><em>na tatha vasudevasya mahima hy anuvarnitah</em></p>
<p class="translation">&#8220;O best of sages, since you have broadly described the four goals of human life beginning with religious performances, you have not described the glories of the Supreme Personality, Vasudeva.&#8221; (<em>Bhagavata</em>1.5.8-9)</p>

<p> On the advice of Narada, Vyasa meditated and the <em>Bhagavata</em> was manifest to him. This is the natural commentary of Vyasa’s own <em>sutras</em> (<em>artho’yam brahma-sutranam</em>) and thus includes the purport of the entire <em>Vedic</em> literature (<em>vedartha-paribrmhitah</em>) It is free from the problems that we find with the <em>Vedas</em> and the other <em>Puranas</em> – it is available in it’s entirety, it has commentated upon by various Vaisnava <em>acaryas</em>, it is divinely composed and <em>Puranic</em> in nature. In it’s opening <em>sloka</em> it gives the essence of the <em>Vedas</em> since it begins with the holy <em>gayatri mantra·</em> (<em>gayatri-bhasya-rupo ’sah</em>) which is itself the essence of the <em>vedas.</em> This is also confirmed in the <em>Matsya Purana</em> (53.20-22) and <em>Agni Purana</em> (272.6.7) &#8211;</p>

<p>Most importantly, the <em>Bhagavata</em> is the crowning glory of the divine author’s literary efforts, soothing his heart when he felt that his work remained incomplete.<br />
There are many verses that praise the <em>Bhagavata</em> above all the other <em>Puranas.</em> In the <em>Skanda Purana</em> (<em>Visnu-khanda</em> 6.4.3) it says –</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light">

</blockquote>
<p><strong> CONCLUSION:</strong> In this way we have shown through the <em>pramana</em> of the <em>srutis, smrtis, Itihasas</em> and <em>Puranas</em> that the <em>Mahabharata</em> and the <em>Puranas</em> are indeed considered to be the fifth <em>Veda</em>, and that they are of higher importance and significance in the age of Kali than the four <em>Vedas</em>. Of them, the highest is the the <em>Bhagavata</em>, the crest-jewel of all the Vedic literatures. For this reason the <em>Bhagavata</em>(1.3.43) says:</p>
<p class="verse"><em>krsne sva-dhamopagate dharma-jnanadibhih saha<br />
kalau nasta-drsam esa puranarko’dhunditah</em></p>
<p class="translation">&#8220;The <em>Bhagavata</em> is as brilliant as the sun. After Sri Krsna has left for His abode, accompanied by <em>dharma</em> and knowledge, it has arisen to save us from the darkness of the age of Kali.&#8221;</p>
<p>____________________________</p>
<p class="note"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">1</span>&#8211; This is affirmed by Lord Krsna in the <em>Bhagavata</em> (11.3.44) – &#8220;<em>paroksa-vada vedo’yam&#8221;</em> (The <em>Vedas</em> speak indirectly).</p>
<p class="note"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2</span>&#8211; In the case of the <em>Bhagavata,</em> this itself is a contradiction from the point of view of the Madhva <em>sampradaya.</em> If the <em>Vedas</em> are considered a primary authority merely because they issued from the mouth of God Himself, the <em>Bhagavata</em> and <em>Mahabharata</em> should also fall into such a category since the author of these works was Veda Vyasa, whom the Tattvavadis consider to be a direct <em>avatara</em> of Narayana.</p>
<p class="note"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">3</span>&#8211; This verse from <em>Chandogya Upanisad</em> is also quoted by Madhvacarya in <em>Visnu Tattva Vinirnaya</em> (5). It is also worth noting that in Prof. K.T. Pandurangi’s work The <em>Principal Upanisads</em> (Dvaita Vedanta Studies and Research Foundation, Bangalore 1999) wherein he explains Madhvacarya’s <em>Upanisad</em> commentaries, the author gives the same meaning of this verse.</p>
<p class="note"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">4</span>&#8211; This is also confirmed in the <em>Bhagavata</em> (1.4.20):</p>
<p class="verse note"><em>rg-yajuh-samatharvakhya<br />

<p class="translation note">&#8220;The <em>Vedas</em> were divided into four, namely <em>Rg, Yajur, Sama</em> and <em>Atharva</em>. The <em>Itihasas</em> and the <em>Puranas</em> are said to be the fifth <em>Veda</em>.&#8221;</p>
<p class="note"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">5</span>&#8211; In his <em>tika</em> on the <em>Visnu Purana</em> 3.6.16, Srila Sridhara Svami explains these terms thus:</p>
<p class="verse note"><em>svayam-drstartha</em>&#8211;<em>kathanam prahur akhyanakam budhah srutasyarthasya<br />
kathanam upakhyanam pracaksate gathas tu pitr-prthivyadi gitayah</em></p>
<p class="translation note">&#8220;An <em>Akhyana</em> is a description of that which is witnessed by the speaker. An <em>Upakhyana</em> is a description of something the speaker has not seen, but merely heard about. A <em>Gatha</em> is a song dedicated to the forefathers and beings present upon the earth.&#8221;</p>
<p class="note"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">6</span>&#8211; The word <em>sankspitam</em> in this verse is important. This means ‘condensed’ and not ‘composed’. In other words Sri Vyasa condensed the already existing <em>Vedas</em>, then taking unused verses from that condensed portion, he compiled the <em>Puranas</em>. Thus, the <em>Puranas</em> must be understood to be equal to the <em>Vedas</em>.</p>
<p class="note"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">7</span>&#8211; The five elements of a <em>Purana</em> are described in <em>Matsya Purana</em> (53.65) &#8211;</p>

<p class="note"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">8</span>&#8211; In this verse the word ‘<em>agni</em>’ (fire) refers to the Vedic sacrifices wherein one offers oblations into various sacred fires. ‘<em>Kalpesu</em>’ means ‘scripture (in this case <em>Purana</em>) according to the definition given in the Medini Sanskrit dictionary 1.21.2 (<em>kalpa sastre vidhau nyaye samvarte brahmane dine</em> – the word <em>kalpa</em> means ‘scripture’, ‘rule’, ‘logic’, and ‘day of Brahma’.) The word ‘<em>ca</em>’ in the phrase ‘<em>sivasya ca</em>’ implies the consort of Lord Siva, namely Goddess Uma. ‘<em>Sankirnesu</em>’means ‘in the various <em>Puranas</em> which are in mixed modes of goodness, passion and ignorance. The word ‘<em>sarasvatyah</em>’ refers to the presiding deity of speech and, by implication, the various devas referred to in various scriptures which she embodies. <em>’Pitrnam’</em> refers to the <em>karma-khanda</em> rituals meant for attaining the heavenly planets of the manes (<em>karmana pitr-lokah</em>).</p>
