<p>Written by Sulaiman Razvi</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Do mention the link of this blog when you copy any verse</span></strong></p>
<p>You may have heard a lot of Hindus saying that Hinduism is a very peaceful and tolerant religion (or the way of life as they say). Hindus say that unlike other religions (hinting at Islam and Christianity) you will not be punished or put into hell for rejecting the Hindu faith or blaspheming the religion. I was reading the book The Land of the Lingam by Arthur Miles, I read only the first few pages but I found one very interesting observation by Arthur Miles, he wrote,</p>
<p>&#8220;Ask any Hindu to explain his religion, and he will wander off into a labyrinth of words from which nothing will extricate him but the end of your endurance. If you comment on his belief, he will tell you that you do not understand. &#8216;You do not understand&#8217; is always the last word of the Hindu.&#8221;</p>
<p><span id="more-2672"></span></p>
<p>Hindus will first claim that Hinduism is a very tolerant religion and when you show any violent verse from any Hindu scripture he would be startled to read the verse and try to escape the argument, on failing to explain any verse he will claim that Hindus don&#8217;t behead people for the difference in faith. Hindus would very comfortably call Muslims terrorists or being terrorist sympathizers but they turn a blind eye when it comes to Hindu terrorists. Leave aside condemning Hindu terrorism, Hindus don&#8217;t even consider Hindu terror organizations to be terrorists, they call them patriots and social workers and they outrightly deny the existence of Hindu terrorism. No community on the earth glorifies terrorism except the Hindu community. I recommend them to go through <a href="https://vedkabhed.wordpress.com/2013/10/06/how-peaceful-are-hindus/" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">How peaceful are Hindus<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> to know about the violence perpetrated by Hindus. According to the <a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/around-3-400-communal-riots-took-place-from-2016-2020-centre-101648611989880.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Central Government<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, MoS home affairs Nityanand Rai, India witnessed 3,399 cases of communal or religious rioting during the period 2016-2020. India is probably the only country in the world that faces such a large number of communal clashes probably because Hindus are majority in India. There is no communal violence in Mayalsia, Indonesia where Hindus are minority with a Muslim majority population. These two countries are perfect examples because those states have religious diversity like India. Hindus boast about India being a secular state which is the home of over 90% of all Hindus in the world. It&#8217;s quite funny that on the one hand, they boast about India&#8217;s secularism only to portray themselves as champions of secularism which is only for image building, and on the other hand, they dream of establishing Hindu Rashtra (State) via ethnic cleansing or subjugation of minorities. India is secular not because Hindus are majority but because of people like Mahatma Gandhi, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, and Dr. B.R. Ambedkar and all these persons are hated by Hindu extremists, they even want to build Nathuram Godse temple the assassin of Mahatma Gandhi. If majority of Hindus had really been secular, then the right wing would not have thrived in India. Hindu leaders giving hate speech against minorities gets full support from Hindus and no case will be lodged against them. Some Hindu leaders talk about killing Muslims and Christian, some vandalize Mosques and Churches, some talks about raping minority women, some leaders who killed Muslims in riots gets Z+ security, people are lynched for eating beef, some are shot dead for expressing their views on Hinduism, a Hindu leader talks about demolishing Mosques, another one talks about finishing off Islam and Christianity from India by 2022. All these are happening in a secular India, imagine what would&#8217;ve happened to minorities if India had been a Hindu state. Dr. B.R Ambedkar had rightly said,</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p>&#8220;The Hindus claim to be a very tolerant people. In my opinion this is a mistake. On many occasions they can be intolerant and if on some occasions they are tolerant that is because they are too weak to oppose or too indifferent to oppose.&#8221; <a href="http://ccnmtl.columbia.edu/projects/mmt/ambedkar/web/section_11.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #0000ff;">Source</span></strong><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p></blockquote>
<p>When a Muslim man was lynched on rumors that he ate beef, a magazine belonging to a Hindu terror outfit justified the killing by saying that <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Vedas-say-kill-those-who-slaughter-cows-Panchjanya/articleshow/49445823.cms" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Vedas say kill those who slaughter cows<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. The way Hinduism treats its own Shudras reveals whether it is peaceful or violent, not to speak of what it says about other religions, <a href="http://www.thecitizen.in/index.php/OldNewsPage/?Id=1465" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">every 18 minutes a crime is committed against a Dalit<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> and all these have scriptural sanctions. Some Hindus also say that they don&#8217;t use verses from their scripture to justify the killing of non-Hindus. That&#8217;s true because they would&#8217;ve cited verses only if they were familiar with their scriptures. Common Hindus don&#8217;t cite verses from Hindu scriptures because they have never read them. Surely they don&#8217;t cite their scriptures but violence perpetrated on minorities by Hindus is surely inspired by their religion. You will find hundreds of Hindu scholars spewing venom against non Hindus but you will hardly find any who try to foster the relationship between Hindus and non-Hindus. Hindu scholars spewing venom in their Dharm Sansads only proved that Hinduism is violent because Hindu scholars are well acquainted with their texts. Why were people lynched for eating beef and transporting cows if Hindus don&#8217;t believe in their scriptures? Why atrocities against Dalits is rampant if Hindus don&#8217;t get inspiration from their scriptures? When you show something from Hindu scriptures, the Hindu would quickly reply that &#8216;Our religion is not like Islam and Christianity dependent on one book, We believe in whatever we want to and reject whatever we want to, we don&#8217;t need scriptures.&#8217; If Hindus don&#8217;t require Hindu scriptures, then on what basis Babri mosque was demolished? Because it was believed to be the birthplace of a mythological figure called Rama mentioned in Ramayana for which there is no archaeological evidence to prove that he ever existed. Do Hindus directly get revelation from God on how to perform Puja and all, that they don&#8217;t need Hindu scriptures? Well, this is one of the tricks used by Hindus in argument as Hindu scriptures are fallible, they can&#8217;t be defended, Hindus would resort to many such tricks to find an easy route to escape.</p>
<p>When you talk about violence in India, Hindu fanatics will never talk about that rather he will start his whataboutery. And then shamelessly accuse others of being violent. <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/amnesty-annual-report-condemns-growing-intolerance-in-india/" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Amnesty International annual report condemns growing intolerance in India<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, <a href="http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/intolerance-in-india-rose-in-2015-says-uscirf/articleshow/52084719.cms" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">USCIRF report shows religious intolerance rose in India in the year 2015<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. Instead of correcting themselves and stop supporting Hindu hate mongers, Hindus will rather say that &#8216;You first see what&#8217;s happening in so and so country, go and condemn that first&#8217; or else will tell you that &#8216;if you are so uncomfortable in India then leave and go to some other country&#8217;. Such is their hypocrisy. They suddenly develop love for the world when communal violence in India is discussed. If violence is perpetrated by some non-Hindu even in a country far away from India then Hindus will view it as an act of barbarism, religious bigotry and will blame the culprit&#8217;s religion but if the same kind of incident is perpetrated by Hindus then Hindus view it as an act of bravery and would applaud the act, and they would start whataboutery to divert the topic. They would be overwhelmed to hear that a particular number of Muslims have been killed in a particular country but will find no problem going to Christian and Muslim countries to earn their bread and butter. Hindus will insult other religions even if any crime like theft and murder is committed by a non-Hindu, they would drag religion even in such stray crimes (which has nothing to do with religion) but they would never ever say a word against Hinduism when Hindu priests are caught in rape and murder cases, when Dalit is killed, when there is honour killing due to inter-caste marriage, when there is an attack on minority, etc.</p>
<p>Hindus leave no stone unturned in calling other religions violent but are unaware of their own religion. All such violence is inspired by their religious text. Without reading any scripture Hindus would conclude that Hinduism is peaceful, promotes the idea of universal brotherhood and that other religions like Buddhism and Jainism are also accepted. Hindus claim that you can even be an atheist and attain salvation, you will not be put in hell for rejecting Hinduism, etc. All these claims of Hindus shall be refuted in this article. Read the entire article for better understanding as some verses dealing with the same subject are posted in different categories.<a id="top"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a id="intolerance-within-Hinduism"></a>Intolerance within Hindu caste and sect</h2>
<p>Hinduism is perhaps the only religion that divides its believers into castes and sects. There is birth-based discrimination. Hinduism says that people responsible for a mixture of caste will be put into hell fire, Shudra kings in the Kali Yuga will be slain by Kalki avatar, Shudra who takes up the duty of Brahmin will be punished, etc.,</p>
<p>Brahma Purana 106.121 &#8220;There is a hell named Gudapaka. It is full of boiling eddies of treacle and molasses. A man responsible for the mixture in castes is thrown into it. He is burnt therein.&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Some scriptures also say that Kalki will kill Shudra kings and all those people born of mixed castes,</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana 1.2.31.77-84 &#8220;In the previous Svayambhuva Manvantara, he had been born of a part of Madhava (Visnu). For a full period of twenty years, he wandered over the Earth taking with him an army along with horses, chariots and elephants. Surrounded by hundreds and thousands of Brahmanas wielding weapons, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">he killed all the Mlecchas all round along with those kings, the heretics born of Sudra women</span>. The lord exterminates those heretics. Everywhere he kills all those who are not scrupulously religious. The lord who was strong and who annihilated all the Mlecchas <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">slew these also People who were born of parents of different castes, those who depended on them</span>, the Udicyas (Notherners), Madhya Desyas (Persons of middle lands), Parvatiyas (Mountain-dweller), Pracyas (Easterners), Praticyas (Westerners), those who talk about on the ridges of the Vindya mountains, Daksinatyas (Southerners), Dravidas along with Simhalas (Ceylonese), Gandhara, Paradas, Pahlavas, Yavanas, Sakas, Tusaras. Barbaras, Cinas (Chinese), Sulikas, Daradas, Khasas, Lampa-karas, Katakas and different tribes of Kiratas. The powerful lord wielding the discuss slew all these barbarous people.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 11.4.22 &#8220;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">In his incarnation as Buddha, He shall bewilder</span> by his arguments of ahimsa (non-injury) the Daityas performing sacrifices, though not entitled to the performance thereof. Then in the Kali Yuga, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">incarnating himself as Kalki He shall slay the Sudra kings</span>.&#8221; Tr. J.M. Sanyal</p>
<p>Shudras cannot even drink the milk of tawny cow,</p>
<p>Varaha Purana 112.19-21 &#8220;Those (Sudras) who drink (the milk of) Kapila make their forefathers eat the filth in the earth for long. Note what happens to the Sudras who feed on the milk, ghee and butter of the Kapila cows. They go to the terrible hell called Raurava.&#8221; Tr. Venkitasubramonia Iyer</p>
<p>Inter-mingling of Shudras and Brahmanas is evil of Kali Yuga,</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana 1.2.31.41 &#8220;Alliances and associations of the Sudras and Antyayonis (lowest born) with Brahmanas take place in the Kali Yuga, in regard to bed, seats and food stuffs.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Kurma Purana I.30.6 &#8220;In Kaliyuga, the Sudras will have close association with the Brahmanas by the use of spells and incantations as well as through the sharing of beds, seats and food.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Intolerance towards Shudras is briefly explained in articles <a href="https://vedkabhed.wordpress.com/2015/06/05/caste-system-in-hinduism/" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Caste system in Hinduism<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> and <a href="https://vedkabhed.wordpress.com/2015/05/01/manu-smriti-and-untouchables/" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Manu Smriti and Untouchables<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>.</p>
<p><a href="#top" class="broken_link">top</a></p>
<h3><a id="intolerance-sects"></a>Intolerance towards sects</h3>
<p>Hinduism also has sects. Other than dividing people into castes Hinduism also sanctions sects. At present time there are many sects of Hinduism like Lingayat, Arya Samaj, ISKCON, etc. There are mainly two sects in Hinduism Shaivism and Vaishnavism. Shaivites are followers of Shiva and Vaishnavites are followers of Vishnu and his avatars. Shaivite Puranas do recognize Vishnu and his avatars as Gods and Vaishnavite Puranas also recognize Shiva as God. But Shaivite scriptures hail Shiva as the Supreme God and depict Vishnu as a weak god while Vaishnavite scriptures call Vishnu as the Supreme God and humiliate Shiva. There have also been some clashes between these two groups,</p>
<p><a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/on-the-eve-of-kumbh-a-conflict-between-priests-and-sadhus/" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/on-the-eve-of-kumbh-a-conflict-between-priests-and-sadhus/<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>A similar clash happened in the 19<sup>th</sup> century also,</p>
<p>&#8220;At the Kumbh Mela at Ujjain in 1826, a combined army of Vaishnavite warrior-sadhus and Maratha soldiers inflicted a harsh military defeat on the Shaivite sadhus, and ended up plundering their temples and monasteries. Later, while the British put an end to the regular bouts of violence between the warrior-sadhus Shaivites and Vaishnavites, they made separate arrangements for both orders at the Kumbh Melas at Allahabad and Hardwar to prevent bloodshed over which sadhu order should have precedence in bathing in the Ganga.&#8221; The Radical Humanist, Volume 67, by Manabendra Nath Roy, p.13 also mentioned by Yoginder Sikand <a href="http://www.islamicvoice.com/january.98/FEAT1.HTM" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">http://www.islamicvoice.com/january.98/FEAT1.HTM<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>Visit by naga sadhus at Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams leads to ‘suddhi’<br />
<a href="http://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/current-affairs/160717/visit-by-naga-sadhus-leads-to-suddhi.html" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">http://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/current-affairs/160717/visit-by-naga-sadhus-leads-to-suddhi.html<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>In Tamil Nadu two groups of Vaishnavite Hindus namely Vadakalai and Thenkalai fought each after a dispute over whether to hold prayer in Sanskrit or Tamil <a href="https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/vadakalai-and-thenkalai-iyengars-come-blows-again-over-sanskrit-vs-tamil-prayer-102453" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/vadakalai-and-thenkalai-iyengars-come-blows-again-over-sanskrit-vs-tamil-prayer-102453<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>Although both these sects co-exist today but there seems to have a tiff between them in the scriptures. There is a battle of supremacy in both Shaivite and Vaishnavite scriptures. Shaivite scriptures show that Vishnu and his avatars worshiped Shiva,</p>
<p>Linga Purana Section I, 98.159-162 &#8220;Suta said: Thus he eulogised the bull-bannered lord with his thousand names. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The lord (i.e. Visnu) bathed Siva and worshipped him with lotus flowers. In order to test Visnu</span>, Mahesvara the lord of the worlds hid one of the lotus flowers intended for the worship. Visnu from whom the flowers was taken away thought thus, &#8216;What is this?&#8217; <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">After realising thee loss of the flower Visnu plucked out his eye and devoutly worshipped the preceptor of the universe</span>, the support of all beings. He worshipped him repeating the last name of the lord.&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a Linga Purana story to show Shiva&#8217;s superiority over Vishnu. Another story shows that the Sudarshana Chakra (Discus) which Vishnu wielded was actually given by Shiva as a boon to Vishnu after Vishnu rigorously worshiped Shiva,</p>
<p>Linga Purana Section I.98.1-3 &#8220;The sages said: O Suta, how was the discus Sudarsana acquired from Mahesvara, the lord of Devas, by lord Visnu? It behoves you to recount it. Suta said: A terrible fight ensued between Devas and the leading Asuras causing destruction to all living beings. On being pierced and hit by lances, iron clubs, javelins and arrows of bent knots Devas became extremely terrified and fled. [18-26] <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Lord Visnu said: O Devas, I shall approach lord Siva now along with all the eternal Devas and shall carry out your task in full</span>. O Devas, after acquiring the discus, formerly made by the slayer of the Tripuras in order to kill Jalandhara, I shall kill all the six thousand eight hundred great Asuras and Daityas beginning with Dhundhu&#8230;Suta said: After saying this to the excellent Devas, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Visnu, the excellent one among Devas, remembered lord Siva worshipped him</span>. On the splendid summit of the Himavan he duly installed the Linga that resembled the mountain Meru. It had been made by Visvakarman. Repeating the hymn called Tvarita-Rudra and the Rudrasukta he bathed the Linga and worshipped it with scents. It was charming in its flame-like form. He eulogised Rudra; worshipped him in the fire and bowed down to him. Repeating the thousand names in order he worshipped lord Siva&#8230; [169-170] <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Glancing lovingly at Visnu who stood aside with palms joined in reverence, Sankara, Mahadeva said </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">smilingly. O Visnu, the task of Devas has been well understood by me. I shall give you the splendid discuss Sudarsana</span>.&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>This is how Shaivite Purana shows Shiva as the supreme god. Another Shaivite scripture says that,</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Kotirudrasamhita 4.27.35-42 &#8220;Gautama said:- You are evil-minded desiring to put me in distress as I am a devotee of Siva. Hence you shall be averse to the Vedas always. Henceforth your faith in the rites of the Vedas, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">particularly with reference to the path of Siva yielding salvation shall cease to exist&#8230;fall, ye all, deep into the hell</span>&#8230;You will not have Siva as your sole deity. You will be considering the matchless Siva on a par with other gods&#8230;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">All your descendants-sons, grandsons and other, O brahmins, shall be non-Saivites. You shall stay certainly in hell along with your sons.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</span></p>
<p>These verses are implying that being a Shaivite alone can bring you salvation and being non-Shaivite will lead you to hell. A story also shows that Vaishnavite were averse to Shiva,</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Rudrasamhita 2, Parvatikhanda III.33.5-6 &#8220;Now, a certain brahmin professing Vaisnava cult came here and spoke very critically about Siva. Ever since, the mother of Parvati has gone out of sense. Hence she does not wish her daughter&#8217;s marriage with Siva.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Another verse from Shiva Purana says that only those sons who are Shaivite shall receive the inheritance,</p>
<p>Shiva Purana Vayaviyasamhita 6, section II.39.58-60 &#8220;&#8230;The descendant shall propitiate devotees. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Only a devotee of Siva shall inherit his wealth</span>. If his children are not initiated in Saivite cult the wealth shall be handed over the Siva. No child shall take it.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Contrary to those Shaivite verses other Puranas (mostly Vaishnavite) praise Vaishnavism and hail Vishnu as the supreme god, Sage Narada said,</p>
<p>Garuda Purana I.99.6-7 &#8220;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The following should not be entertained</span>. A sickly person, a person deficient in limbs or having additional appendages, a one-eyed man, son of a widow after remarriage, a fallen sinner like Avakirna and those who do not conform to conventions, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">and a a-Vaisnava (non-believer in Visnu). These are not worthy of being invited for Sraddha</span>. They (the deserving brahmins) shall be invited the day before when they shall observe celibacy.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Skanda Purana II.ii.10.120-1 &#8220;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">(As opposed to these) Avaisnavas (&#8216;non-devotees of Visnu&#8217;) hate auspicious conduct of (other) men</span>. They themselves indulge in evil conduct and evil thoughts in the minds. They are undisturbed even if great misfortune befalls them. They take delight in sexual enjoyment. Those Avaisnavas are inebriated. They do not resort to the Lord even for a moment, although he is the cause of supreme happiness and is present in the lotus of the heart. They always cover up the names of Hari by means of aimless, worthless and futile network of words&#8230;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Indeed those devoid of devotion to Visnu are human brutes</span>.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">One who blasphemes a Vaisnava cannot be protected by anyone. Even if a person is as strong as Lord Siva</span>, if he blasphemes a Vaisnava, he is sure to be destroyed. This is the verdict of all sastras. If one does not care for the verdict of the sastras and dares blaspheme a Vaisnava, he suffers life after life because of this.&#8221; <strong>Chaitanya Bhagavata Madhya 22 by Vrindavana Dasa Thakura, Tr. Swami Prabhupada</strong></p>
<p>A Purana even says that one should not reside in a kingdom where the king is not a Vaishnavite,</p>
<p>Skanda Purana II.v.11.23-24 &#8220;Bharadvaja said: Well asked, O highly fortunate one, since you are a devotee of Visnu. The earth that you protect, O king, is blessed. The subjects (governed by you) are good (blessed). One shall not stay in that kingdom where the king is not a Vaisnava. Better to stay in a forest or in a Tirtha but not in a realm where there are no Vaisnavas.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Vaishnavite scripture suggests that sage Bhrigu was a Vaishnavite, sage Bhrigu curses followers of Shiva in the following way at a particular incident,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 4.2.28-29 &#8220;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">One who takes a vow to satisfy Lord Śiva or who follows such principles will certainly become an atheist and be diverted from transcendental scriptural injunctions</span>. Those who vow to worship Lord Śiva are so foolish that they imitate him by keeping long hair on their heads. When initiated into worship of Lord Śiva, they prefer to live on wine, flesh and other such things. Bhṛgu Muni continued: Since you blaspheme the Vedas and the brāhmaṇas, who are followers of the Vedic principles, it is understood that you have already taken shelter of the doctrine of atheism.&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p><strong>Swami Prabhupada writes:</strong> &#8220;It is sometimes seen that devotees of Lord Śiva imitate the characteristics of Lord Śiva. For example, Lord Śiva drank an ocean of poison, so some of the followers of Lord Śiva imitate him and try to take intoxicants like gāñjā (marijuana). Here the curse is that if someone follows such principles he must become an infidel and turn against the principles of Vedic regulation. It is said that such devotees of Lord Śiva will be sac-chāstra-paripanthinaḥ, which means &#8220;opposed to the conclusion of śāstra, or scripture.&#8217;…&#8221; <strong>Swami Prabhupada on Srimad Bhagavatam 4.2.28 </strong><a href="http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_4.2.28" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right"><span style="color: #000000;">http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_4.2.28</span><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>Swami Prabhupada also writes,</p>
<p>&#8220;Lord Śiva&#8217;s symptoms of austerity are not exactly those of a Vaiṣṇava. Lord Śiva is certainly the number one Vaiṣṇava, but he exhibits a feature for a particular class of men who cannot follow the Vaiṣṇava principles. The Śaivites, the devotees of Lord Śiva, generally dress like Lord Śiva, and sometimes they indulge in smoking and taking intoxicants. Such practices are never accepted by the followers of Vaiṣṇava rituals.&#8221; <strong>Swami Prabhupada on Srimad Bhagavatam 4.6.36. </strong><a href="http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_4.6.36" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_4.6.36<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>Many Hindus were offended when a guy impersonated Shiva in the movie P.K and ran fearing his life, Hindus who were offended by this attacked theatres and called for a boycott of the film and upcoming films of the lead actor. I am wondering if they will tear and burn up this scripture in which Shiva is depicted in such a humiliating way. The story says that a fight between Shiva and Krishna erupted and Krishna defeated Shiva. Shiva was so scared of Krishna&#8217;s fiery that he ran away in fear and hid in a mountain.</p>
<p>Skanda Purana II.ii.12.14-18 &#8220;&#8230;Nila mountain is in the third Yojana (i.e. 3X12 Kms.). This is the holy spot of the Lord of Gauri named Ekamrakavana. Not far off, O king, is the place where, being afraid, he sought refuge. Indradyumna said: Why was the Lord of Gauri (Siva) frightened? With whom did he seek refuge?&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a Shaivite Purana but according to the translator, this is invented by Vaishnavites to show Krishna&#8217;s superiority. The translator Ganesh Vasudeo Tagare wrote,</p>
<p>&#8220;A Vaisnavite twist to show the inferiority of Siva to Visnu. The fight between Siva and Visnu for one king of Kasi (Kasiraja) and the subsequent defeat of Siva and his praise of Visnu and Siva&#8217;s departure from Varanis to Ekamra Vana (vv50-79)-all this is invented to show Visnu&#8217;s superiority.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although Skanda Purana is a Shaivite Purana but it may have also been composed by Vaishnavites that&#8217;s why there are many verses praising Vishnu and ridiculing Shiva as G.V. Tagare rightly points out. The war between Shiva and Krishna/Vishnu is explained briefly in <a href="#fighting-eachother" class="broken_link">God fighting each other</a> category. Shiva helps his devotee to fight Krishna/Vishnu and he is humiliated in the following way,</p>
<p>Skanda Purana II.ii.12.81-85a &#8220;Mahadeva said: O lord of Devas&#8230;carrying out your behest will be the cause of my welfare, O lord of the worlds. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">On account of my stupidity, I Lord, I had been arrogant. There, O Lord, your own blessing is the cause of my fickleness</span>. Since you command me, O Lord of Devas, to proceed to Purusottama, I shall carry out your behest reverently and proceed to the auspicious holy place that bestows salvation. Do a favour to me and promise that you alone will protect and sustain my sacred region Purusottama&#8230;&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>This is also explained in<a href="#fighting-eachother" class="broken_link"> Gods fighting each other</a> category. Just like this verse, Vishnu is also ridiculed in a Shaivite Purana,</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Satarudra Samhita 3.23.13-16 &#8220;When his pride fell off, Visnu was dejected, and dispirited. He then realised that Siva was sporting about in the form of a bull. Then on realising that Siva himself had come in the form of a Bull, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Visnu spoke in a shrill voice with drooping shoulders and palms joined in reverence</span>. Visnu said: O lord of the gods, O ocean of mercy, O lord Siva, I had been deluded by your Maya and my mind had been confused. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">O lord, I fought with you, Siva. Taking pity on me, O lord, let this offence be excused</span>.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>

<h3><a id="kapalika"></a>Kapalika</h3>
<p>Kapalika was Shaivite sect. The Aghori Sadhus are an offshoot of this sect. Followers of Kapalika sect used human skull as a begging bowl and also used to eat food from it, they applied ashes from crematorium and had many such weird practices. Kapalika sect has gone extinct but we can get a sense of their belief from Aghoris which is an offshoot of Kapalika. You can understand it better by looking at the following graph taken from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kapalika" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Wikipedia<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shiva is said to be a Kapalin himself,</p>
<p>Skanda Purana V.iii.214.2-3 &#8220;The lord wandered over the earth as a Kapalin (holder of a skull) wearing patched garments. He was surrounded by Pisacas, Raksasas, Dakinis, and Yoginis. He assumed the form of Bhairava and resorted to a cremation ground where he performed an elaborate penance causing freedom from fear to all the three worlds&#8230;&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Shiva Purana Ruda-Samhita 2, Satikhanda section II.27.22 &#8220;Daksa, the evil-minded, did not invite Siva for that sacrifice, deciding that He was not worthy of taking part in the sacrifice because he was a Kapalin.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>In Varaha Purana 97.1 Shiva is infuriated when Brahma calls him Kapalin. I have mentioned this verse in <a href="#fighting-eachother" class="broken_link"><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #0000ff;">Gods fighting each other</span></a> category.</p>
<p>Kapalikas are praised,</p>
<p>Skanda Purana I.iii.(P).8.76-80 &#8220;May the eminent sages staying in them protect the system of the worship of Siva. The devotees of Siva and the Pasupatas shall beg for alms (for their sustenance). Let these and the others of Yogic power and practice, as well as the Kapalikas always protect this holy spot. All the kings of past, present and future shall protect this spot without any disobedience to their commands&#8230;&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Rishi Upamanyu praises Kapalins,</p>
<p>Shiva Purana Vayaviyasamhita 6, Section II, 31.173-4 &#8220;[Upamanya said] The followers of Siva who adhere to the philosophical path, those who perform <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">the Pasupata rites those who observe holy rites and the Saivite holy men such as Kapalikas</span>-all these are adherents and executors of Siva&#8217;s behests. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">They shall be worshipped by me at the behest of Siva. May these bless me</span>. Let them praise the successful holy rite.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Kapalika Vrata prescribed by Shiva in general,</p>
<p>Skanda Purana V.i.6.84-94 &#8220;&#8230;[Shiva said] O sinless Devas, since I came over here it is called Mahakalavana. To you also who wished to perform austerities, it is Mahakalavana (forest of great opportunity). This secret holy shrine will become renowned in the world with this twin name. It is a secret forest. It is the cremation ground. It is the greatest and most majestic of all holy spots. This Kalavrtacarya (performace of Kapala Vrata) has been proclaimed by me. The devotee embellished with Kapala Vrata should take food in the Kapala (skull). The Kapala should always be held in the hand. He should be contented with the alms thus received in the course of his Vrata. He should (outwardly) adopt terrific features and reside in the cremation ground&#8230;He should adorn all limbs with holy ash&#8230; Formerly I too had adopted the Kapala Vrata and practised it. Kapala is the greatest of all secrets, holy and destructive of sins…[96] If out of delusion any man hates this Mahavrata, he will be overpowered by sins. Even after hundreds and crores of births, he is not rid of that sin. Hence no one should hate or violate it&#8230;&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Kapalika sect and other Shaivite sects are condemned in Vaishnavite Purana and Shaktism and even say that Shiva created these sects to delude people,</p>
<p>Srimad Devi Bhagavatam 7.39.21-30 &#8220;…The S&#8217;âstras that are extant, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">as contrary to the S&#8217;rutis and Smritis, are all Tâmasa S&#8217;âstras</span>, Mahâdeva has framed these Vâma, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Kâpâlak, Kaulaks, Bhairava</span> and such like S&#8217;astras for fascinating the people; else he has no object in framing them…&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Varaha Purana 174.42-42 &#8220;The Brahmana said: He who dies with the food given by a Sudra within him, becomes ghost. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">By mere contact of, not to say sitting together or eating with, Nagas (a naked sect), Kapalikas or Pasandas, one becomes a ghost</span>.&#8221; Tr. Venkitasubramonia Iyer, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Kurma Purana II.39.56-62 &#8220;Indeed the holy Pasupata vow has been formerly designed by me for the achievement of liberation. It is the greatest of all secrets. It is the subtlest essence of the Vedas. One who performs Pasupataa vow, shall be quiescent; he must have perfect self-control; he should dust his body with sacred ashes; he should observe celibacy and remain naked. Or he should wear a loin-cloth or a single garment; he should be silent and engaged in the study of Vedas. The scholar shall meditate on Siva as Pasupati. Sruti states that this Pasupata Yoga should be resorted by the seekers of liberation; that those who maintain Pasupata rite should be free from desire&#8230;There are other scriptures opposed to the Vedic view. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">They have been propounded by me alone and they are very fascinating in this world. Those cults are Vama, Pasupata</span>, the Soma cult, the Lakura (Lakula) and the Bhairava and such other cults which are opposed to Veda should not be resorted to.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Kurma Purana II.16.15 &#8220;One should not even verbally revere and honour the heretics, those who indulge in wrong actions, those who perform black magic, the Pancaratras and the Pasupatas.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>There is another Shaivite sect called Nakula which is also condemned in Vaishnavite Purana. A story in Kurma Purana says that Shiva urged Vishnu to create scriptures for deluding the sinners, on being urged by Shiva, Vishnu creates it and he then urges Shiva to also create some deluding cults. Urged by Vishnu, Shiva creates some sects which include Kapalika, Pasupata, and Nakula as mentioned in this Vaishnavite Purana in an effort to declare these Shaivite sects as deceitful and heretic sects,</p>
<p>Kurma Purana I.16.117-9 &#8220;Hence, O bull-bannered lord, we shall compose scriptures for deluding the sinners and for saving those who are out of the pale of the Vedas.&#8217; Thus addressed by Visnu, the slayer of Mura, Rudra composed deluding Scriptures and Kesava too did the same, on being urged by Siva. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">They were the treatises of the cults of Kapala, Nakula, Vama, Bhairava, both of Western and Eastern variety. Pancaratra, Pasupata and thousands of other cults as well</span>.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Ganesh Vasudeo Tagare writes &#8220;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The list shows what sects were regarded as being out of the pale of Vedic religion in KP. Out of these, Kapalas, or Kapalikas whether Brahminic or non-Brahminic</span>, ate and drank in human skulls, wore garlands of skulls and indulged in horrid practices of wine-drinking, in sexual orgies and living in unclean manner (S.N. Dasgupta Ind. Phil. V.P.2, 3). <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Nakulas are the followers of Nakula or Lakulisa, a semi-historical founder of a sect of Saivism. In the Vayu P.23.2.17-23 and the LO.I.24, he is said to be an incarnation of Siva</span> in a cemetry and Kayavarohana in Bhrgu ksetra, in Dabhoi Tehsil in Gujarat. Vama is a general term for the (Sakta?) observers of socially disapproved practices, the group being designated as Five Ma-karas. Bhairavas are also Saivites who worshipped Bhairava form of Siva. Bhairava-worship has been very popular among the masses in Maharashtra. Pancaratras, the Vasudeva worshippers who were later accommodated by the followers of Veda, held the famous Catur-vyuha (the four manifestations of Vasudeva) doctrine and had their own way of worship, are quite famous. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Pasupatas are the followers of system founded by Umapati Srikantha (or Siva) and they are mentioned in Mbh. Santi. 337.62</span>&#8230;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kurma Purana II.39.56-62 &#8220;Indeed the holy Pasupata vow has been formerly designed by me for the achievement of liberation. It is the greatest of all secrets. It is the subtlest essence of the Vedas. One who performs Pasupataa vow, shall be quiescent; he must have perfect self-control; he should dust his body with sacred ashes; he should observe celibacy and remain naked.

Those cults are Vama, Pasupata, the Soma cult, the Lakura (Lakula) and the Bhairava and such other cults which are opposed to Veda should not be resorted to</span>.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Just like Vaishvanite distortion of the Shaivite Skanda Purana II.ii.12.14-18, a Linga Purana verse may have also been twisted by Vaishnavite where Indra says,</p>
<p>Linga Purana Section I.40.38-39 &#8220;People overwhelmed by misery will never see the maximum span of life of hundred years. In Kali all the Vedas will not be available. Yajnas perish afflicted by people of no virtue. Ochre-robed and naked anchorites will be wandering and many Kapalikas (ascetics holding skulls as their begging bowls) will infest the territories.&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Vayu Purana a Vaishnavite Purana condemns Kapalikas and other religions also,</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.58.64-66 &#8220;Yajnas are forsaken when Dharma receives a setback. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">There will be many types of heretics like wearers of ochre-coloured robes (Buddhists), Jainas and Kapalikas (skull bearing mendicants)</span>. There will be sellers of the Vedas and the sacred places. Heretics antagonistic to the discipline and arrangement of different castes and stages of life will be born. When Kali Yuga sets in, the Vedas will not be studied. Sudras will be experts and authorities in the affairs of Dharma.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Shaivite Puranas says Shiva was a Kapalika, and he recommended the Kapalika Vrata, Kapalikas are praised in Shaivite Puranas but Vaishnavite Puranas says that Shiva created Kapalika and other Shaivite sects to delude the sinners. It&#8217;s clear proof that Vaishnavite text wants to demonize Shaivite sects. Shaivite sects are even called heretic sects in Vaishnavite Puranas. Read verses in <a href="#intolerance-buddhists">Intolerance towards Buddhism</a> and <a href="#intolerance-jainism" class="broken_link">Jainism</a> category in which Kapalika sect are condemned by Vaishnavite Puranas. The worship of Shivlingam is condemned in Vedas. Shiva was the local deity of India who was later assimilated in the Vedic religion by Aryans.

<h3><a id="others"></a>Others</h3>
<p>There is a conflict between Hindu sects, one sect accuses the other of not following Vedas properly,</p>
<p>Swami Prabhupada the founder of ISKCON and also a follower of Gaudiya Vaishnavism writes on Arya Samaj,</p>
<p>&#8220;Those who are Āryans strictly follow the Vedic principles, but in this age of Kali a community has sprung up known as the ārya-samāja, which is ignorant of the import of the Vedas in the paramparā system. Their leaders decry all bona fide ācāryas, and they pose themselves as the real followers of the Vedic principles. These ācāryas who do not follow the Vedic principles are presently known as the ārya-samājas…&#8221; <strong>Swami Prabhupada on Srimad Bhagavatam 5.15.1</strong> <a href="http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_5.15.1" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_5.15.1<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>Swami Prabhupada on Ramakrishna mission,</p>
<p>&#8220;So you take any means, the Ramakrishna Mission also says like that. Yata mata tata patha. &#8220;You can worship brahma-varcasa, you can worship Devī-māyā; you can worship Vasūn; you can worship Rudra; you can worship anyone; ultimately, you become one with the Supreme.&#8221; Most misguiding. Here it is&#8230; But if you want this particular thing, then you worship this. In the Bhagavad-gītā also, it is confirmed, yānti deva-vratā devān pitṟn yānti pitṛ-vratāḥ (BG 9.25).<br />
You will find, rascal gurus, they are preaching like that, that &#8220;Whatever you do, it is all right.&#8221; There is a big mission, they say also that yata mat tata patha. &#8220;Whatever you have manufactured, the way of salvation, that&#8217;s all right.&#8221;<br />

<p>Founder of Arya Samaj Swami Dayanand Saraswati writes on Puranik (orthodox) Hindus who worship idols. Puranik Hindus constitute the majority of the Hindu population,</p>
<p>&#8220;Fie on you! O you senseless, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">idiotic author of the Bhagvat Puranana. What a shameless creature you were!</span> You did not feel a bit of shame or hesitation in writing such falsehood! You became so utterly blind.&#8221; <strong>by Swami Dayanand Saraswati, Satyarth Prakash, Ch 11, page 407, Tr.

<p>He also wrote,</p>
<p>&#8220;A Shaiva is really one who worships Shiva &#8211; the All merciful Being; a Vaishnava is one who worships Vishnu &#8211; the All-pervading God. A Ganpata is one who worships Ganpati &#8211; The Lord of Hosts i.e., (of the Universe); Bhagvata is one who sits at the feet of the muses. A Saurka is one who is the devotee of the All-pervading God, the Soul of the Universe &#8211; animate and inanimate. Thus Rudra, shiva, Vishnu, Ganapati, Surya, connote God, and Bhagvati connotes truthful speech. These various Puranic texts were invented owing to the wrong interpretation of the Vedic texts (quoted above)… likewise the Shivites, Shaktas, Vaishnavites and the like revile one another, because they are ignorant of the true meanings of the words Shiva, Rudra, Vishnu, etc., which, as is set forth in the first chapter of this book, are the different names of the Immutable God Who is Self-existent, All-wise and Blissful. These men of little understanding do not use their brains and never give the least thought to the matter, otherwise they will soon find out that all such terms as Shiva, Rudra, and Vishnu connote One Supreme, Incomparable&lt; Omniscient God, the Controller of the universe, on account of His possessing multitudinous attributes. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Would not the wrath of God descend on such people</span>?&#8221; By Swami Dayanand Saraswati, Satyarth Prakash, Ch 11, page 366-7, Tr. Chiranjiva Bhardwaja</p>
<p>Clashes between Hindu sects still exist. A clash broke out between Arya Samajis and followers of Sant Rampal because Arya Samajis who abuse other religions were offended by the &#8216;Derogatory&#8217; remarks made on Dayanand Saraswati by Sant Rampal. Another clash had erupted between these two groups over the handling of Ashram.</p>

<h2><a id="intolerance-towards-religions"></a>Intolerance towards other religions</h2>
<p>Now this one is really an interesting topic that would expose those Hindus who claim that Hinduism tolerates other religions. Hindus claim that Buddhism and Jainism are sects of Hinduism. And that both share the same values and teachings. It&#8217;s quite funny to hear from Hindus that Hinduism tolerates other religions when it doesn&#8217;t even tolerate its own Shudra. Shudras are not even considered Aryas, they are called Anaryas (Non-Aryans), non-Hindus in Hindu scripture, and works of scholars are called with slang terms like Maleccha (Barbarian/foreigner), Yavana who are considered to be viler than Chandalas, etc. Can such religion really preach tolerance?</p>

We will be considered winners even if 20 lakh of their population is killed.” Anand Swaroop, head of a body named the Shankaracharya Parishad sought to threaten hotels in Haridwar against holding Christmas celebrations on 25 December, he also vowed not to allow Eid celebrations, “It’s a norm since 1915 that non-Hindu religious functions cannot be held in Haridwar, acknowledged as a pilgrimage city of Hindus. We have written to nearly 300 hotels that they should not entertain Christmas celebrations at their places on 25 December. If they do, they will have to face the consequences.” Seer Sindhu Sagar called on “rich Hindu villagers” to “buy all Muslim properties and keep the village free of the minority population”. “Harass them to the extent that they are forced to sell off their houses. I have arrested more than 10 Muslims on false charges under the SC/ST Act.” Swami Prabodhanand said, “Just like Myanmar, the police, the army and every Hindu must pick up arms and organise a cleansing [of Muslims…We have no other choice.” Another speaker, Sadhvi Annapurna or Pooja Shakun Pandey <a href="https://twitter.com/zoo_bear/status/1473581283242491904" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">repeated<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> the call for genocide: “If you want to finish off their population then we are ready to kill them.

<p>I have mentioned only those Hindu scholars who made it to the news, there are many more Hindu scholars who comment against Islam and Muslims on social media, and they pass Islamophobic remarks in their religious events. So much is the hatred for Muslims by Hindu scholars because this is what Hinduism teaches them. This is not something new, Hindus have been giving hate speeches and persecuting non-Hindus for centuries, this hatred was directed towards Buddhism and Jainism in ancient India when Buddhism and Jainism flourished in India and the responsibility of giving hate speeches against them was taken up by Hindu scholars like Adi Shankaracharya, Kumarila Bhatta, Basava, etc., and now they are targeting Muslims because Islam is the second-largest religion in India so Hindus want to wipe out the Muslim community in India.</p>

<h2><a id="intolerance-buddhists"></a>Intolerance towards Buddhists</h2>
<p>In the 2nd century BC, <a href="https://scroll.in/article/774518/a-brief-history-of-religious-intolerance-in-india" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Patanjali<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> tells us that the relationship between Brahmins and Buddhists is like that between the snake and the mongoose. <a href="https://vedkabhed.wordpress.com/2014/05/14/mulshankar-on-jainism-and-buddhism/" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Swami Dayanand Saraswati<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> criticized Buddhism in his book Satyarth Prakash, Adi Shankaracharya criticized Buddhist scriptures and used abhorrent words for Buddha,</p>
<p>Brahma Sutra 2.2.32 &#8220;To be brief, from every point of view that this Buddhist doctrine may be examined for finding out some justification, it breaks down like a well sunk in sand; and we do not find any least logic here. Hence also all behaviour based on the Buddhist scripture is unjustifiable. Moreover, Buddha exposed his own incoherence in talk when he instructed the three mutually contradictory theories of the existence of eternal objects, existence of consciousness, and absolute nihilism; or he showed his malevolence towards all creatures, acting under the delusion that these creatures would get confused by imbibing contradictory views. The idea is that the Buddhist view should be abjured in every way by all those who desire the highest good.&#8221; Tr. Swami Gambhirananda</p>
<p>Jaimini wrote about Buddhist scriptures,</p>
<p>Purva Mimansa Sutra of Jaimini, Pada 3, verse 14, Adhikarana VII (b) &#8220;With regard to the non-Vedic scriptures of the Bauddha, &amp;c., the Purvapaksa is that, &#8216;inasmuch as these are as much scriptures of actions as the Veda, their authoritative character cannot be denied. The eternal and authoritative character of these scriptures can be proved by the same arguments that have been put forward in support of the eternality of the Veda.&#8217;<br />
The Siddhanta is that, inasmuch as these other scriptures are acknowledged to have been the work of human authors, they cannot be accepted to be possessed of infallible authority. They they are not eternal is proved by their having been compiled by human authors; and also by the absence in those so called &#8216;scriptures&#8217; of all regularity; that is to say, they are found to be full of incorrect words and phrases&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Pandit Ganganath Jha</p>
<p>Kumarila Bhatta wrote about Buddhist scriptures,</p>
<p>Tantra Vartika, Adhyaya 1, Pada III, Adhi (7d) &#8220;&#8230;Thus, then, we conclude that on account of their being composed of incorrect words and expressions, the scriptures of the Bauddha, &amp;c., can never be held to be either a Veda, or an eternal scripture&#8230;Nor can these scriptures be held to be eternal, because there is a clean remembrance of their authors (Buddha, and others) And hence in matters relating to Dharma, which is amenable only to an eternal scriptures (as proved under Sutra I-1-2), we cannot admit of the independent authority of the Bauddha scriptures.&#8221; Tr. Pandit Ganganath Jha</p>
<p>Hindus claim that Buddhism is part of Hinduism. That Buddha was an avatar of Vishnu. An Indologist said that Buddha was considered an avatar of Vishnu only to convert the Buddhists to Hinduism. A Dalit scholar writes,</p>
<p>&#8220;Declaring the Buddha as ninth avatara of Vishnu, by the Brahmanic Puranas, was meant to cause confusion in the minds of people with the result that Buddhism came to be treated as a &#8220;heretical&#8221; and &#8220;aesthetic&#8221; branch of Brahmanism&#8221; <a href="http://www.ambedkar.org/books/dob15.htm" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">http://www.ambedkar.org/books/dob15.htm<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>As per Hindu texts and scholars. Buddha rejected Vedas and established anti-Vedic philosophy to stop the animal sacrifice. Some Hindu scholars say that people during Buddha&#8217;s time were engaged in animal sacrifice because they lived on the wrong interpretation of Vedas and that the Vedas do not sanction animal killing. My question is if people during Buddha&#8217;s time misinterpreted the Vedas then why the avatar of Vishnu establish anti-Vedic, atheistic philosophy? Why didn&#8217;t he just revive the Vedas? Why wasn&#8217;t he born as the revivalist of Hinduism?</p>
<p>Hindus would very happily tell you that Buddha was an avatar of Vishnu but they will never tell you the truth about this avatar. According to Hindu scriptures, Vishnu didn&#8217;t incarnate as Buddha to guide people to the right path or to teach them Vedas, Vishnu incarnated as Buddha to delude people by establishing a false religion called Buddhism. Hindu scripture says that to delude the sinners and demons and to defeat the demons Vishnu incarnated as Buddha and made all the demons accept Buddhism who would continue to spread this religion. Hindu text explicitly says that Buddhism is a false religion,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 2.7.37 &#8220;Asuras, the enemies of the celestials, became proficient in the knowledge of the Vedas, and having got made by Mayadanaba (an Asura of that name) and invisible city of velocity, engaged themselves in the destruction of the people. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Thereupon the glorious God incarnated Himself as Buddha, and with a view to bring about a confusion of their understanding and to create avarice in them taught them many false religions</span> in the guise of a Pashanda (one setting the true religious texts at naught).&#8221; Tr. J.M. Sanyal</p>
<p>Padma Purana VI.252.108-115 &#8220;&#8230;The glorious one, taking up the form of Buddha, deluded his enemies. Those who were deluded by that teaching gave up all religious practices&#8230;.&#8221; Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p>Garuda Purana 3.15.26 &#8220;Then in Kali age, the Lord was born in the Kikata [modern Bihar] as Buddha. He deluded the asuras and flouted the Vedas.&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Agni Purana 16.1-5 &#8220;Agni said:- I will now describe the Buddha incarnation&#8230;Formerly in the war between gods and demons the former were defeated by the latter. Saying &#8216;Save us, Save us!&#8217; they sought refuge with Iswara. Being incarnation of illusion and infatuation he was born as the son of Suddhodana. He infatuated the Daityas and made them relinquish the religion of the Veda. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">They then became followers of Buddha and induced others to forsake Vedic religion</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">He became Arhata and afterwards made others Arhatas</span>. Divorced from Vedic religion they became all Pashandinas [Irreligious people]. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">They committed (sinful) deeds capable of taking one to hell and received (gifts) from degraded persons</span>&#8230;&#8221; Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>It&#8217;s mentioned in Bhagavad Purana,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 1.3.24 &#8220;Then, in the beginning of Kali-yuga, the Lord will appear as Lord Buddha, the son of Añjanā, in the province of Gayā, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">just for the purpose of deluding those who are envious of the faithful theist</span>.&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 4.19.24-25 &#8220;In this way while carrying away the hose with the intention of interrupting Prthu&#8217;s sacrificce, Indra assumed and abandoned deceitful disguise of <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">nude ascetics (Digamabara Jainas), red-robed ascetics (Buddhists)</span> and others (such as Kapalakas). Minds of men, through their misapprehension (of the true teachings of the Vedas), <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">are </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">generally attracted to these pseudo-religious sects as the true religion</span>, as they are charmingly presented with excellent eloquence.&#8221; Tr.

<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 4.19.23-25 &#8220;All the forms that Indra assumed for the purpose of stealing the sacrificial horse in disguised form are therefore considered to be vile and generally adopted by persons known as Pashandas. The guises so assumed and cast off by Indra for the purpose of stealing the horse with a view to thwarting the performance of Prithu&#8217;s sacrifice have been the cause of unreligious creeds as professed by Jainas, Buddhas, and Kapalikas. Although such forms faith differ widely from the true religion or truth, they attracted the attention of the people. Such creeds in view of their intelligent arguments prove apparently charming to weak minds.&#8221; Tr. J.N. Sanyal</p>
<p>Ironically, verse 14 of this chapter states that Indra assumed the form of a Hindu saint, but that form is not listed here among Pashandas (Heretics), these verses also dub Jainism, Buddhism, and Kapalika sect as false religions. The Sanskrit word mentioned here for Buddhists is rakta pata which means red-robed, As Buddhist monks don red robes, it&#8217;s an expression used in Hindu scriptures to refer to Buddhists, Sanskrit word for Jain is Nagna which means naked referring to Digambara Jains. Upadharmesu is translated as towards false religions. The above verses are trying to say that Buddhism and Jainism are false religions and people are attracted to these sects as true religions. Gautama Rishi curses the Brahmins who oppressed him in the following way,</p>
<p>Srimad Devi Bhagavatam 12.9.63-81 &#8220;O vile Brâhma<span style="text-decoration: underline;">n</span>as! You will be always averse to see the festivals of S&#8217;iva, to worship S&#8217;iva, to Rudrâk<span style="text-decoration: underline;">s</span>a, to the Bel leaves, and to the holy Bha<span style="text-decoration: underline;">s</span>ma (ashes). You will be wholly indifferent to practise the right ways of living as presented in the Vedas and Smritis, to preserve your conduct good and to observe the path of knowledge to Advaita Jñânam, to practise restraint of senses and continence, to the daily practices of Sandhyâ Bandanam, to performing the Agnihotra ceremonies, to the study of the Vedas according to one&#8217;s own S&#8217;âkhâ or to the daily studies thereof as to teach those things or to give, as gifts, cows, etc., or to perform the S&#8217;râddhas of the fathers, etc., or to perform Krichchra Chândrâya<span style="text-decoration: underline;">n</span>a and other penances. O Vile Brâhma<span style="text-decoration: underline;">n</span>as! As you are ready to do these mean things, you will have to suffer for this that you will desist from worshipping the Most Adorable S&#8217;rî Bhagavatî Devî and that you will worship the other Devas with faith and devotion and hold on your bodies S&#8217;amkha, Chakra and other signs. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">You will follow the Kâpâlikas, Bauddha S&#8217;âstras and other heretics</span>. You will sell your father, mother, brothers, sisters, sons and daughters and even your wives too! You will sell the Vedas, Tîrthas, and your Dharma. You will not feel ashamed in any way to sell all these. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">You will certainly have faith in Kâpâlika and Bauddha opinions, Pâñcharâtras and Kâma S&#8217;âstras</span>…&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Why Gautam Rishi is cursing Brahmins is not the topic of this discussion but the way he is cursing them is very important, he curses them to follow Bauddha (Buddhist) scriptures, and he curses them to sell father, mother, sister, brother, daughters, and even wives. So following Buddhist, Jain and Kapalika scriptures are considered so worst in the sight of Gautama Rishi that he compares it to selling mother and daughter. The following verses show that they would enter hell because they embraced the heretic philosophy like Buddhism, Jainism and Kapalika,</p>
<p>Srimad Devi Bhagavatam 12.9.91-100 &#8220;…Some of them began to mark on their bodies various heretical signs, e.g., Taptamûdrâ, etc.; some became Kâpâlikas; some became Kaulas; <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">some Bauddhas and some Jainas</span>. Many of them, though learned, became lewd and addicted to other&#8217;s wives and engaged themselves in vain and bad disputations. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">For these, they will have to go again surely to the Kumbhîpâka hell</span>…&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Hindu scriptures even consider Buddhist worship places to be equivalent to cremation ground, place inhabited by wicked men, etc.,</p>
<p>Kurma Purana II.11.48-49 &#8220;The following places are also to be avoided for Yogic Practice: places where vermins abound, cremation ground, dilapidated cowpen, the quadrangle or place where four roads meet, a crowded noisy place or <span style="text-decoration: underline;">where there is an ant-hill or a Caitya (Buddhist place of worship)</span>, an unauspicious place full of wicked men, and places where mosquitoes are in plenty. Nor should one practice Yoga when the body is ailing or when the mind is dispirited.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana says that the Asuras (Demons) created Buddhism and Jainism,</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana 2.3.14.38b &#8220;Formerly, in the battle between the Devas and the Asuras, the Asuras were defeated. They created the heretics like Vrddhasravakis, Nirgranthas, (nude Jainas), Sakyas (Buddhists), Jivaskas and Karpatas.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Another verse calls them heretics who will flourish in the Kali Yuga,</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana 1.2.31.65 &#8220;After the advent of the Kali age, many types of heretics crop up. They may be Buddhists wearing ochre-coloured robes, Jainas, Kapalikas and others who sell the Vedas. Still others are those who sell holy centres of pilgrimage.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Rama in Valmiki Ramayana says that Buddhists are thieves and should be punished like a theif,</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">यथा</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;">हि</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;">चोरः</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;">स</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;">तथा</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;">हि</span> <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">बुद्ध</span></strong> |<br />
स्तथागतं नास्तिकमत्र विध्हि |<br />
तस्माद्धि यः शङ्क्यतमःप्रजानाम् |<br />
न नास्ति केनाभिमुखो बुधः स्यात्</p>
<p>Ramayana of Valmiki, Ayodhya Kanda II.109 &#8220;I blame this act of my father&#8217;s, viz.,-that he took (for his priest) one of perverse understanding, who rangeth by help of such an intellect-who is frightfully atheistic, and who hat swerved from the path of righteousness. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">As a thief is, so is a Buddha</span>, and know that in this matter, an atheist is in a like predicament. Therefore, such an one, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">when capable of being punished like a thief for the good of the people, should be punished like a thief</span>; and let no <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Brahmana ever speak with an atheist</span>.&#8221; Tr. Manmath Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Yatha hi chor = As a theif<br />
Sa tatha hi Buddhah = so is Buddha/Buddhist</p>
<p>Ralph T.H. Griffith has also translated it as Buddhist. The reason why I translated the Sanskrit version word by word is that Hindu scholars are deliberately distorting the translation. Hari Prasad Shastri translates it as Charvaka school, and another one translates it as atheistic way even when there is a clear mention of the word Buddha which is translated into English as Buddha or Buddhist. Buddha in Sanskrit means intellectual so here it is surely not condemning &#8216;Intellectual&#8217; and also it makes no sense at all. Jabali was persuading Rama to follow atheistic philosophy and Buddhism is also considered atheistic philosophy so by keeping all these in mind the word Buddhah here refers to Buddha/Buddhist, it’s true that Ramayana may not have been composed when Buddhism was founded, this seems to be a later interpolation added by Rishis. Other Hindu scriptures say that one should avoid seeing Buddhists and the very sight of a Buddhist monk even in a dream is a bad sign,</p>
<p>Narada Purana I.15.49-53 &#8220;There is no expiation anywhere to those persons who intimately associate themselves with Sudra women, whose bodies are nourished with the food of the Sudras and <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">who indulge themselves in denouncing the Vedas</span>. There is no expiation here or hereafter to those who find fault with stories of saintly people. Even through hundreds of expiations, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">it is impossible to see the redemption of that Brahmana who enters a Buddhistic shrine</span>, even in a great emergency. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The Buddhistic are heretics, as they are the revilers of the Vedas. Hence, a Brahmana shall not even look at them</span>, since they are excluded from righteous holy rites. A Brahmana may enter a Buddhist shrine knowingly or unknowingly. If he enters knowingly, there is no redemption at all. This is the decision of the scriptures.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>The Yajnavalkya Smriti says that the very sight of a monk with red robes and shaven head (referring to Buddhists), even in a dream, is a bad sign. [Yajnavalkya SmritiI/272-273]
<h2>Touching a Jain or Buddhist</h2>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">A s</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">imilar thing is mentioned in Basava Purana</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> which narrates a story of a Basava devotee,</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> that a devotee of Basava in his dream touched a Buddhist so to expiate the sins of touching a Buddhist he burned himself in Srisailam,</span></p>

<h3><a id="shraddha"></a>Buddhists and Jains seeing Shraddha invalidates it</h3>
<p>Forget about participation of Buddhists and Jains in a Hindu ritual, the Hindu ritual becomes void if it is merely sighted by a Buddhist or a Jain, they must not be present at Hindu rituals as per Hindu texts.</p>
<p>Kurma Purana II.21.32-33 &#8220;That Sraddha wherein the wicked Tamasikas such as old Sravakas (Buddhists), Jainas, knowers of Pancaratra, followers of Kapalika and Pasupata sects, atheists, and others like them eat food offered to gods, does not bestow excellent benefit here and hereafter.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Ganesh Vasudeo Tagare explains the word Nagnas &#8220;The explanation in VV.35 ff below shows that the term Nagna includes Jainas, Buddhists, Jivakas (i.e. Ajivakas, the followers of Mankhali Gosala) and such other sects who do not follow Brahminism. It includes also apostate Brahmanas, atheists and the committers of gross sins (Mahapatakas)&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Usana Samita 4.23-30 &#8220;The following are disqualified to be present at a Sraddha ceremony…The <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Sramanas (Bouddha ascetics)</span>; Nirgoodas, (a class of naked mendicants); <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">those, who, know the doctrines of the</span> Pancharatra; <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Jinas</span>; the Kapalikas, the Pasupatas; if these and similar other heretics, wicked souls pervaded by the quality of Tammas, partake of the Havi, the Sraddha does not become successful, and it does not yield fruits in the next world.&#8221; Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana 2.3.14.34 &#8220;The Nagnas (naked) and other persons must not see the well-arranged Sraddha rite. The Sraddha viewed by these do not reach the Pitrs or the Pitamahas (grandfathers).&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare.</p>
<p>Vayu Purana Part 2, 16.24 &#8221;The naked and similar (apostates and non-Vedic sects) people should not see the Sraddha rite. This is the rule. Such Sraddhas as are seen by these, do not reach Pitrs or Pitamahas.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Ganesh Vasudeo Tagare writes: &#8221;As explain below (vv.26ff), those who do not have the protective covering of the Vedas. The text not only includes non-Vedic sects like Jains and Buddhists but includes apostate Brahmins, atheists, committer of gross sins (maha-patakas).</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana 2.3.15.59-62 &#8220;&#8230;One should avoid persons with tonsured head, persons, with matter hair and persons with ochre robes in the Sraddha rite.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare<br />
Kurma Purana II.22.34-35 &#8220;The following shall be shunned and kept at a great distance from Sraddhas viz. one who is deficient in any limb, a fallen one, a leper, one with running sores, an atheist, a cock, a pig, and a dog. One shall avoid a loathsome fellow, an unclean fellow, the naked one, the intoxicated one, the rogue, a women in her monthly course, the blue-garmented, the ochre-garmented and the heretic.&#8221; Tr.

<h3><a id="shiva-incarnates"></a>Shiva incarnates to stop Buddhism</h3>
<p>You may have heard the proverb &#8220;Diamond cuts diamond (Loha Lohe ko kat ta hai)&#8217;. Hindu scripture says the same about stopping Buddhism. According to Hindu scriptures and scholars, Shiva incarnated on earth and established a false philosophy (Advaita Vedanta) just to stop another false philosophy called Buddhism. Hindu scholars consider Adi Shankaracharya to be an incarnation of Shiva as Adi Shankaracharya had successfully stopped Buddhism and even persecuted Buddhists and Jains and established objectionable philosophy (Advaita Vedanta) for which he was sometimes considered crypto-Buddhist by some Hindu scholars. It&#8217;s mentioned in Padma Purana wherein Shiva says,</p>
<p>Padma Purana 6.236.5-7 &#8220;&#8230;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Visnu of the form of Buddha proclaimed the false Buddhist doctrine</span> and those of the naked and wearing dark blue garments for the destruction of the demons. The doctrine of Maya (illusion) is a wicked doctrine and said to be pseudo-Buddhist. I myself, of the form of a Brahmana, proclaimed it in Kali (age).&#8221; Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p>A verse in Kurma Purana may also be talking about this,</p>
<p>Kurma Purana I.30.31-32a &#8220;Persons practising vows not sanctioned by the Vedas, of wicked behaviour and of futile efforts, will be deluding all other people by exhibiting the fruits thereof. Their minds are enveloped and vitiated with ignorance and these base people follow feline tricks. [33b-36] Sankara, Nilalohita, will take up incarnations for the establishing the Srauta (Vedic) and Smarata (belonging to the Smrtis) rites, with a desire for the welfare of his devotees. He will teach his disciples the knowledge pertaining to the Brahman. Those who resort to the essence of Vedantas (Upanishads) and follow the holy rites indicated in the Vedas and such of those holy rites as are pointed out with special reference to the people of all castes, serve him in whatever manner they can. They overcome defects or sins of Kali Age and attain the greatest region.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Swami Prabhupada wrote,</p>
<p>&#8220;In this regard, it is stated in the Padma Purana that Lord Siva appeared as a brahmana in the age of Kali to preach the Mayavada philosophy, which is nothing but a type of Buddhist philosophy. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">It is stated in Padma Purana: Lord Siva, speaking to Parvati-devi, foretold that he would spread the Mayavada philosophy in the guise of a sannyasi brahmana just to eradicate Buddhist philosophy</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">This sannyasi was Sripada Sankaracarya. In order to overcome the effects of Buddhist philosophy and spread Vedanta philosophy, Sripada Sankaracarya had to make some compromise with the Buddhist philosophy, and as such he preached the philosophy of monism, for it was required at that time</span>. Otherwise there was no need for his preaching Mayavada philosophy. At the present moment there is no need for Mayavada philosophy or Buddhist philosophy, and Lord Caitanya rejected both of them. This Krishna consciousness movement is spreading the philosophy of Lord Caitanya and rejecting the philosophy of both classes of Mayavadi. Strictly speaking, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">both Buddhist philosophy and Sankara&#8217;s philosophy are but different types of Mayavada dealing on the platform of material existence</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Neither of these philosophies has spiritual significance</span>. There is spiritual significance only after one accepts the philosophy of Bhagavad-gita, which culminates in surrendering unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Generally people worship Lord Siva for some material benefit, and although they cannot see him personally, they derive great material profit by worshiping him.&#8221; <strong>Swami Prabhupada on Srimad Bhagavatam 4.24.17</strong><br />

<p>He also wrote,</p>
<p>&#8220;Lord Chaitanya admitted that Sankaracharya was an incarnation of Lord Shiva, and Lord Shiva is one of the greatest devotees, a Mahajan of the Bhagwat school. There are twelve great authorities on devotional service, and Lord Shiva is one of them. Then, why did he adopt the process of Mayavadi philosophy? The answer is given in the Padma Purana, where there is a statement by Lord Shiva as follows: &#8220;The Mayavadi philosophy is veiled Buddhist philosophy.&#8221; In other words, the void philosophy of Buddha is more or less repeated in the Mayavadi philosophy of impersonalism, althouth the Mayavadi philosophy claims to be directed by the Vedic conclusions. Lord Shiva thus admits that this philosophy was manufactured by him in the Age of Kali as a Brahmin boy to mislead the atheist class of men: &#8220;Actually, the Supreme Personality of Godhead has His transcendental Body, but I describe the Supreme as impersonal. Similarly, I have explained the Vedanta Sutra also on the same principles of Mayavadi philosophy.&#8221; <strong>Teachings of Lord Chaitanya (1968) </strong><a href="http://vanisource.org/wiki/TLC_19_%281968%29" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">http://vanisource.org/wiki/TLC_19_%281968%29<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>Madhavacharya wrote that Devas went to Shiva and complained about the prevalence of Buddhists and Kapalikas and requests him to re-establish the Vedic religion, Shiva accepts their requests and tells them that he will incarnate as Adi Shankaracharya, his son will incarnate as Kumarila Bhatta and Indra will incarnate as King Sudhanva. Kumarila Bhatta with the help of King Sudhanva had persecuted Jains and Buddhists,</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;The Devas once resorted to Siva, the Lord of the Silver Mountain, for seeking a favour, just as they appraoch the Icy Moon&#8230;They addressed Him thus with folded palms: &#8216;In days of yore, it was to favour us that <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Lord Vishnu incarnated Himself as the Buddha and diverted unrighteous men from contaminating the Vedic path, by preaching a new religion for them. But today, the country is filled with the heterodox followers of that religion</span>, as night is by darkness. They are indulging in carping criticism of the Veda, declaring it to be just a fraudulent means of livelihood for a few, and condemning its teachings on the duties of Varnas and Ashramas as mere superstitions. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">As people have given up the orthodox Vedic path and become heretics</span>, there is none to do the daily devotional acts like Sandhya, or to take to the life of rununciation&#8230;The followers of the cults of Siva and Vishnu bear on themselves the emblems of the Linga and the Chakra, but they too have given up Vedic rituaals, just as evil men abandon mercy&#8230;Therefore, for the protection of the world and for the happiness of the good and holy ones, Thou shouldst deign to eradicate the world of these vicious and perverse men and their practices, and re-establish the Vedic religion on firm ground.&#8217; When the Devas had completed their submission, the great God Siva said: &#8216;Taking a human body, I shall secure what is good for you. I shall establish the Dharma, conquering all the leaders of the perverse paths. I shall produce a commentary on the Brahma Sutras, setting forth the true teachings of the Vedas. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">I shall do this, taking the form of a great Sannyasin, Sankara by name</span>, accompanied by four disciples who would be like the luminous sun dispelling the darkness of ignorance conjured up the acceptance of duality&#8230;God Siva cast his lvoing glance, so rare for any one to get, on his son Shanmukha (also called Skanda and Subrahmanya)&#8230;Siva, the great God having matted locks, spoke thus to His son: &#8216;Dear one! Hear my words that are meant for the blessing of the world&#8230;And I have now promised to the Devas, as you know very well, that I shall undertake to rejuvenate the gnostic teachings which form the ultimate purport of the Veda. Now, you have to do your part of the work, and that iss the revival of the ritualistic section of Brahma (the Veda) condified by Jaimini, and thereby gain the reputed name of Subrahmanya (promoted of Brhamanya), <span style="text-decoration: underline;">besides the commonly known name of Kumarila Bhatta</span>, the preacher of the Vedic Karma-Kanda. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">In order to refute and confute the Buddhists who are attacking the the Vedic teachings and to establish the Vedic way of life</span>, you have to be born in the world. For your help, Brahma will be born as the scholar Mandana, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">while Indra will become the king Sudhanva</span> for the very same purpose.&#8221; <strong>Shankara Digvijaya 1.27-56, by Madhavacharya, Tr.

<h3><a id="kalki-buddhists"></a>Kalki avatar a murderer of Buddhists</h3>
<p>As per Kalki Purana, the final avatar of Vishnu takes birth on the earth, plunders nearby tribes to support his father&#8217;s horse sacrifice, kills many people and exterminates almost every tribe and also persecutes Buddhists. What is the crime of Buddhists that they deserve to die at the hands of Kalki avatar? Because they are Buddhists, they are heretics, because they don’t follow Vedic religion. I am using Kalki Purana which is translated and edited by ISKCON scholars Bhumipati Das and Purnaprajna Das and the translation is published as &#8216;Sri Kalki Purana&#8217;.</p>
<p>Sri Kalki Purana 13.39-44 &#8220;Lord Kalki appeared to flourish, being surrounded by all these family members. Once, Lord Kalki&#8217;s father, Visnuyasa, who was on the level of Lord Brahma, decided to perform a horse sacrifice. Understanding the intention of His father, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Lord Kalki said: My dear father, I will go out and defeat all other kings in battle and thus bring you sufficient wealth so that you can conduct the horse sacrifice properly</span>. Lord Kalki, who was certainly capable of conquering all other kings, offered His obeisances to his father and <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">then set out with his army to first conquer Kikatapura. Most of the inhabitants of this city were Buddhists, who never offered oblations to their forefathers, nor worshiped the demigods</span>&#8230;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">They did not deignate themselves or their families in terms of caste, and thus there was no conception of high or low birth</span>. As far as earning wealth, marriage, or eating were concerned, they had no sense of discrimination. The people of that city were interested only in eating, drinking, and making merry. When the ruler of that city, who was named Jina, head that Lord Kalki had come to fight, He quickly gathered an army consisting of one aksauhini.&#8221; Tr. Bhumipati Das edited by Purnaprajna Das</p>
<p>Sri Kalki Purana 16.1 &#8220;Suta Gosvami said. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">After killing the Buddhists and mlecchas of Kikatapura, Lord Kalki took their wealth</span> and returned to His capital, along with His vast army&#8221; Tr. Bhumipati Das edited by Purnaprajna Das</p>
<p>This proves that his sole purpose for killing Buddhists of Kitaka was to plunder them. Kalki born to Vishnuyasa is also mentioned in Agni Purana chapter 16.</p>
<p>Sri Kalki Purana 3.10 &#8220;Thereafter, You will set out to conquer the entire world and in the course of that conquest, You will defeat many sinful kings who are representatives of Kali. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">You will also annihilate many followers of Buddhism</span> and finally, You will entrust the responsibility of ruling the world to Devapi and Maru.&#8221; Tr. Bhumipati Das, edited by Purnaprajna Das</p>
<p>Sri Kalki Purana 10.30 &#8220;Recently, You appeared as Lord Kalki in order to eliminate the dynasty of Kali by destroying the Buddhists, atheists, and mlecchas, thereby protecting the true path of religion. What more can we say about your causeless mercy?&#8221; Tr. Bhumipati Das edited by Purnaprajna Das</p>
<p>Sri Kalki Purana 20.25 &#8220;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">You will be happy to learn that I have already defeated the Buddhists residing at Kikata-desa</span>. My mission is to destroy all the miscreants who are envious of you and other Vaisnavas. You can now wander fearlessly over the earth because I am just about to set out on a tour to conquer all the kings of the world.&#8221; Tr. Bhumipati Das, edited by Purnaprajna Das</p>
<p>Sri Kalki Purana 14.11 &#8220;Although Lord Kalki&#8217;s wonderful horse had been injured by Jina&#8217;s trident, he soon regained his composure and began roaming over the battlefield, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">jumping fiercely while angrily attacking hundreds and thousands of Buddhist soldiers</span>. In this way, Lord Kalki&#8217;s horse killed many sinful men. [13] <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Within a short period of time, Gargya and his associates killed six thousand Buddhist warriors</span>. Bhargya killed ten million enemy soldiers with the help of his army, and Visala killed twenty five thousand.&#8221; Tr. Bhumipati Das edited by Purnaprajna Das</p>
<p>The translator Bhumipati Das explains why verses in Kalki Purana are in the past tense when it predicts the advent of the Kalki avatar,</p>
<p>&#8220;Among the upa-puranas or sub Puranas, the Kalki Purana is most sacred and widely respected. At the end of Kali-yuga, the Supreme Lord, Hari, will incarnate as Lord Kalki and kill all the mlecchas, yavanas, atheists, and Buddhists of the world that defy the Vedic authority. The pastimes of Lord Kalki are subject matter of this literature, which is presented in story form. Exalted personalities can see everything, past, present, and future. For this reason, there is no fault in narrating these future events as if they had already occurred. The Kalki Purana consists of thirty-five chapters.&#8221; <strong>by Bhumipati Das in Introduction of book Sri Kalki Purana, Published by Jai Nitai Press</strong></p>

<h2><a id="intolerance-jainism"></a>Intolerance towards Jainism</h2>
<p>Just like Buddhism, the Jain religion is also declared a false and a heretic religion in Hindu scriptures. Swami Dayanand Saraswati wrote,</p>
<p>&#8220;When the people of Aryavarta gave up the study of the Vediclore which alone enables one to discriminate between right and wrong, ignorance spread over the land and many sects sprang up, the Jain religion, whose teachings are opposed to science, took root in the country…&#8221; <strong>By Swami Dayanand Saraswati, Satyarth Prakash, Ch 12, p.499, Tr.

<p>&#8216;<span style="color: #ff0000;">&#8216;What a nice trap have the Jainees set to attract fools</span> who would like nothing better than to be placed in the way of attaining salvation without having to do (righteous) deeds. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">We do not think that there exists a religion more idiotic than this</span>.&#8221; <strong>by Swami Dayanand Saraswati, Satyarth Prakash, Ch 12, page 559, Tr. Chiranjiva Bhardwaja </strong>http://satyarthprakash.in/english/category/satyarthprakash/page/5/</p>
<p>Both Jainism and Hinduism recognises Rishabhdeva or Rishabhnatha as Tirthankara (first teacher). But Hinduism doesn&#8217;t believe Tirthankara to be a Jain or as the founder of Jainism. Hindu scriptures say that Rishabhdeva was a Hindu god and avatar.</p>
<p>Linga Purana I.24.43-47 says that Shiva will incarnate as Rsabha</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 1.3.13 Says that Rishabhdeva was the eighth incarnation of Vishnu</p>
<p><strong>Swami Prabhupada wrote:</strong> &#8220;…Jains refer to Lord Ṛṣabhadeva as their original preceptor. If such people are serious followers of Ṛṣabhadeva, they must also take His instructions…&#8221; <strong>On Srimad Bhagvatam 5.6.12 </strong>http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_5.6.12</p>
<p>He means to say that Jains don&#8217;t follow what Rishabhdeva preached. There are different versions regarding the founder of Jainism in Hindu scriptures. Some Hindu scripture says that a King named Arhat was the founder, some say Jina was the founder, some say Brihaspati in Shukracharya&#8217;s guise founded Jainism, and some say Vishnu created an illusory form namely Arhat to delude people. Jains are referred to in Hindu scriptures as Arhat, Jina, Jaina and also Jain. A story from Padma Purana alone is enough to give the image of how Jainism is viewed in Hinduism. Let me present the verses first,</p>
<p>Padma Purana II.37.4-11 [Suta said] I shall tell (you) <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">all the sinful conduct of Vena</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">When he a noble king knowing righteousness was ruling</span>, a man, having put on a guise, naked, of a huge body, with his head clean-shaved, of a great lustre, holding under his armpit a broom of peacock&#8217;s feathers, and a drinking-pot made of cocoa-nut in his hand reciting (texts containing) wrong doctrines, vilifying the Vedic religion, came (there). He quickly came to (the place) where Vena was (seated). <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The sinner entered the court of that Vena</span>. Seeing him having arrived (there) Vena asked him a question: &#8216;Who are you, taking up such a form&#8230;What is your faith? Tell me (all this). What is your Veda (i.e. which Veda do you follow)? What are your practices&#8230;What are the real characteristics of your faith? Tell me all that and the truth before me.&#8221; Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p>Padma Purana II.37.12a-21 &#8220;Hearing those words of Vena <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">the sinful man</span> said these words. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The sinful man said</span>: In vain you are ruling. You are a great fool, there is no doubt about it. I am all-in-all of Dharma (i.e. religious practices). I am most adored by gods. I am knowledge&#8230;I am Dharma (i.e. religious practices)&#8230;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Know me to be the chief Jaina saint</span>, having body of true religion. The meditating sages, intent on (obtaining) knowledge, run to me only. Vena said: What kind of acts (do you do)? What is your doctrine? What are your practices? Tell (all this to me). <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The sinful man said: (That is my faith) where Arhats are the gods</span>, and Nirgrantha is looked upon as the preceptor&#8230;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The best worship is that of a Jaina mendicant, and the best meditation is that of an Arhat. This way of life is seen in the Jaina faith</span>. I have told you all this i.e. the characteristics of my faith&#8230;.&#8221; Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p>King Vena was surprised looking at this Jain saint so he asked him about his faith and practices. The Jain saint also criticizes the animal slaughter sanctioned by the Vedas. I have not added those verses here as it would&#8217;ve made the passage very long, I tried to make it as short as possible, we shall read it in Meat consumption in Hinduism article. So the Jain saint explains his beliefs and also criticizes the Vedic religion. Now read how the Jain religion is viewed by Hindu sages who addressed king Vena in the following way,</p>
<p>Padma Purana II.38.25-30 &#8220;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">When Kali (yuga) sets in, all men, deluded by sins, will act after having resorted to the Jaina faith</span>. Men will abandon Vedic practices, and will commit sins. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">There is no doubt that the Jaina faith is the root of sin</span>. O best king, the fall of those men, who are heaps of sins, brought about by this great delusion. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Govinda (i.e. Visnu), destroyer of all sins, will be (appearing) for their destruction and for nothing else</span>. Taking the form of his liking he will restrain (them) from sins. When sins will have thus accumulated, he, the god will be (appearing) as Kalki for the destruction of the Mlecchas; there is no doubt about it. Give up the behavior of (i.e. proper for) Kali (yuga) and resort to merit. Heave truthfully; become the guardian of your subjects.&#8221; Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p>On being advised by the Jain saint, King Vena embraces Jainism,</p>
<p>Padma Purana II.38.1-5a &#8220;Suta said: Vena, thus advised by <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">that very sinful Jina, and deluded by him, attained to a sinful attitude</span>. Abandoning the Vedic faith and rites of a truthful conduct, he saluted the feet of <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">that very wicked one</span>. There was cessation of good sacrifices, and also of that Vedas. Religious practices full of holy scriptures (i.e. as told in the holy scriptures) did not proceed at that time. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">As a result of (bad) rule</span>, the world became full of all sins. When that king ruled, there were no sacrifices, no (recitation of) the Vedas, no excellent purport of the holy texts, no charity and no study, O brahmanas.&#8221; Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p>So according to Hindu texts, King Vena was a righteous and noble king but as soon as he embraced Jainism he started ruling badly. This shows that whoever is against Hinduism (or is a non-Hindu) is demonized in Hindu scriptures. The verse also says that deluded by sins people will resort to Jainism. And have you noticed how the Jain saint is addressed here? He is addressed in these verses as &#8216;the wicked one&#8217; and &#8216;the sinful man&#8217;. It means whoever is not an Arya cannot be righteous, all non-Hindus are wicked and sinful. We find mention of King Vena in other scriptures also but they don&#8217;t mention that he had embraced Jainism. He has also been demonized in those scriptures as a bad ruler probably because he left the Vedic religion and embraced Jainism.</p>
<p>Also, read Srimad Bhagavatam 4.14.30-35 in the <a href="#blasphemy" class="broken_link"><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #0000ff;">Blasphemy </span></a>category where Brahmins killed King Vena for blaspheming Vishnu. Bhagavad Purana insults Jainism in the following way,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 5.6.9 &#8220;Śukadeva Gosvāmī continued speaking to Mahārāja Parīkṣit: My dear King, the King of Koṅka, Veṅka and Kuṭaka whose name was Arhat, heard of the activities of Ṛṣabhadeva and, imitating Ṛṣabhadeva&#8217;s principles, introduced a new system of religion. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Taking advantage of Kali-yuga, the age of sinful activity, King Arhat, being bewildered, gave up the Vedic principles</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">, which are free from risk, and </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">concocted a new system of religion opposed to the Vedas</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">. </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">That was the beginning of the Jain dharma</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">. Many other so-called religions followed this atheistic system</span>.&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Swami Prabhupada wrote &#8220;The followers of King Arhat went under the name Jains&#8221; <a href="http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_5.6.10" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_5.6.10<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>He also wrote,</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;the King of Koṅka and Veṅka acted like a paramahaṁsa and imitated Lord Ṛṣabhadeva. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">He introduced a system of religion and took advantage of the fallen condition of the people </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">in this age of Kali</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">It is said in Vedic literatures that people in this age will be more inclined to accept anyone as the Supreme Lord and accept any religious system opposed to Vedic principles</span>. The people in this age are described as mandāḥ sumanda-matayaḥ. Generally they have no spiritual culture, and therefore they are very fallen. Due to this, they will accept any religious system. Due to their misfortune. they forget the Vedic principles. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Following non-Vedic principles in this age, they think themselves the Supreme Lord and thus spread the cult of atheism all over the world</span>.&#8221; <strong>Swami Prabhupada on Srimad Bhagavatam 5.6.9</strong> <a href="http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_5.6.9" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_5.6.9<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>So the founder of Jainism was bewildered and taking advantage of Kali Yuga he established the false religion called Jainism. It also says that Jainism is opposed to the Vedas. Kurma Purana lists Jaina texts in ignorant scriptures,</p>
<p>Kurma Purana I.12.261 &#8220;<span style="color: #ff0000;">Those various scriptures which are contrary to Srutis and Smrtis seen in this world, are based on Tamo-guna or ignorance</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Belief in them or practising in accordance with them is a Tamasa activity</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">They i.e. those contrary to Vedas are the cults of Kapala, Bhairava, (v.1. Pancaratras), Yamala, Vama, and Arhata </span>and others similar to these also. In another incarnation of mine, these scriptures having been promulgated by me to delude the people who themselves try to <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">mislead other persons by propagating their false scriptures</span>.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Ganesh Vasudeo Tagare wrote,</p>
<p>Pasupatism: KP. records two forms of Pasupatism, one approved by Vedic tradition and the other condemned so much that sect is not only classed with non-Vedic heretic sects like Vama (&#8216;left hand&#8217; type of Tantrism) and <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Arhata (Jainas) created for the delusion of non-believers (KP.I.12.261-62)</span> but <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the believers are prohibited from even speaking with those heretics (KP.II.16.15)</span>&#8230;&#8221; Ganesha Vasudeo Tagare, Introduction (V) Religious Sects in the KP, p.xxxiv</p>
<p>A verse in Vishnu Purana says that the demons embraced Buddhism and Jainism which are false doctrines and it is prohibited to converse with them, eat in their house, meet them, etc., the entire chapter is important. If possible you can read the entire chapter available at sacred-texts.com. The passages are long though I have presented certain points only,</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 3.18.1-3 &#8220;PARÁŚARA.&#8211;After this, the great delusion, having proceeded to earth, beheld the Daityas engaged in ascetic penances upon the banks of the Narmadá river ; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">and approaching them in the semblance of a naked mendicant, with his head shaven, and carrying a bunch of peacock&#8217;s feathers</span>&#8230;[7-14] By such persuasions, and by many specious arguments, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">did this delusive being mislead the Daityas from the tenets of the Vedas</span>&#8230;might be the duty of those who go naked, or who go clothed in much raiment: and so the Daityas were seduced from their proper duties by the repeated lessons of their illusory preceptor, maintaining the equal truth of contradictory tenets; <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">and they were called Arhatas</span>, from the phrase he had employed of <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">&#8220;Ye are worthy (Arhatha) of this great doctrine;&#8221; that is, of the false doctrines which he persuaded them to embrace</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The foes of the gods being thus induced to apostatize from the religion of the Vedas</span>, by the delusive person sent by Vishńu, became in their turn teachers of the same heresies, and perverted others; and these, again, communicating their principles to others, by whom they were still further disseminated, the Vedas were in a short time deserted by most of the Daitya race&#8230;[18-26] In this manner, exclaiming to them, &#8220;Know!&#8221; (Budhyadwam), and they replying, &#8220;It is known&#8221; (Budhyate), <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">these Daityas were induced by the arch deceiver to deviate from their religious duties (and become Bauddhas)</span>&#8230;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The delusions of the false teacher paused not with the conversion of the Daityas to the Jaina and Bauddha heresies</span>, but with various erroneous tenets he prevailed upon others to apostatize, until the whole were led astray, and deserted the doctrines and observances inculcated by the three Vedas. Some then spake evil of the sacred books; some blasphemed the gods; some treated sacrifices and other devotional ceremonies with scorn; and others calumniated the Brahmans&#8230;&#8221;The precepts,&#8221; they cried, &#8220;that lead to the injury of animal life (as in sacrifices) are highly reprehensible&#8230;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">If an animal slaughtered in religious worship is thereby raised to heaven, would it not be expedient for a man who institutes a sacrifice to kill his own father for a victim?</span>&#8230;[42-45] <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Let not a man associate, in residence, sitting, or society, with him whose person or whose house has been blasted by the sighs of the gods, progenitors, and spirits. Conversation, interchange of civilities, or association with a man who for a twelvemonth has not discharged his religious duties, is productive of equality of guilt; and the person who eats in the house of such a man, or sits down with him, or sleeps on the same couch with him, becomes like him instantaneously</span>&#8230; [102-4] These, Maitreya, are the persons called naked, the meaning of which term you desired to have explained. Their very looks vitiate the performance of an ancestral oblation; speaking to then destroys religious merit for a whole day. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">These are the unrighteous heretics to whom a man must not give shelter, and speaking to whom effaces whatever merit he may that day have obtained</span>.&#8221; Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>This chapter of Vishnu Purana is explained briefly in Punishment for Apostasy under the sub-category <a href="#examples" class="broken_link"><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #0000ff;">Examples</span></a>. Skanda Purana also says that demons embraced Buddhism,</p>
<p>Skanda Purana VII.I.119.46-50 &#8220;&#8230;the Daitya warriors became furious. They rushed thereat roaring like rumbling clouds. When they were killed, they shouted &#8216;Ha! Ha!&#8217; some of the Asuras entered the sea. A few Danavas went over the mountains. Some of them had tonsured their heads and they stayed within forests as rogues. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Some of them adopted the Vrata of the Nirgranthas (nude sages or Digambara Jainas) and preached sermons on the pious activities of merciful nature</span>. Some of them became afraid of (the goddess) for their lives. They resorted to the life of heretics. They were fools engaged in arguments and disputations about basic or original causes. They had no cleanliness and they did not crave for anything. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">They are indeed seen even today in the world of Ksapanakas (Buddhist monks)</span>. Others are Bhindakas excluded from the scriptures of Saiva cult.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>A story in Devi Bhagavatam says that Brihaspati deceived the demons by assuming the form of Sukracharya and preached Jain religion to them and the demons rejected the real Sukracharya who later cursed the demons for not recognizing him, thus the motive of Brihaspati was accomplished as the demons were cursed and could be easily be defeated by Indra, so Brihaspati went to Indra and informed him about this. It shows that demons were the first to embrace Jainism.</p>
<p>Srimad Devi Bhagavatam 4.13.44-58 &#8220;Vyâsa said:&#8211; Please hear what the disguised Brihaspatî in the shape of S&#8217;ukrâchârya did afterwards. The demons were made to understand clearly by Brihaspatî; and then they took him for S&#8217;ukrâchârya and placed implicit faith on him and began to think of him and him alone. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The Daityas, enchanted and deceived by the magic of Brihaspatî, took now his refuge for acquiring the knowledge from him, since they mistook him for S&#8217;ukrâchârya</span>. Who is there that is not enchanted by the idea of gaining something? On the other hand, when the term of ten years was over, S&#8217;ukrâchârya, the real Guru of the Daityas, ceased enjoying Jayantî and began to remember his disciples, the Daityas. He now began to think that &#8220;My disciples, the Daityas, are expecting every instant my return; and I would now go and see them, bewildered with fear. They are my devotees and I ought to do such that they might not be afraid of the Devas.&#8221; And then he exclaimed to Jayantî, &#8220;O beautiful one! Let my sons take the shelter of the Gods; your term of ten years is today over; I now go therefore, to see my disciples; soon I will again come to you.&#8221; &#8220;Be it so&#8221;, replied Jayantî, the best of those who know religion, &#8220;you can go where you like; I am not to destroy your Dharma.&#8221; Hearing these words, S&#8217;ukrâchârya went hurriedly to the Demons and saw the Devaguru Brihaspatî sitting before them in the guise of S&#8217;ukrâchârya. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">He was explaining to them the Jaina doctrines, compiled by himself and finding fault with the act of envy, taking revenge and killing and cursing the sacrifices, etc</span>. He was telling them &#8220;O Enemies of Gods! Truly, I am telling you words that will, no doubt, prove good to you. Non-killing is the highest virtue; even the enemies ought never to be killed. It is the Brâhmanas, addicted to enjoyments and pleasures of the senses, who want to satisfy their tastes and pleasures that are found in the Veda&#8217;s injunctions to kill animals; but there is no virtue higher than non-killing animals.&#8221; O king! S&#8217;ukrâchârya was perfectly astonished to hear Brihaspatî, the Guru of the Devas, speaking against the Vedas and began to think that Brihaspatî is certainly my enemy. My disciples have been duped by this cheat; there is no doubt in this.&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Srimad Devi Bhagavatam 4.13.59-62 &#8220;Fie to Avarice! It is the seed of sin; very strong and the veritable gate to hell; Brihaspatî, even, the Guru of the Devas, is speaking lies, bound under the influence of this heinous avarice! Oh! What wonder is this that the Guru of the Devas, who is the promulgator of all the religious S&#8217;âstras and whose word is accepted as the final decision, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">is now expounding the doctrines of atheists</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">When Brihaspatî can become the expounder of atheistic doctrines</span>, impelled by covetousness what to speak of those whose minds are not pure and whose intelligence is not sharp? <span style="text-decoration: underline;">This Deva Guru, though a Brâhmin, is acting today like a rogue, wanting to take away all and is deceiving my disciples the Daityas</span>, who have been confounded by his magic.&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Srimad Devi Bhagavatam 4.14.16-19 &#8220;Vyâsa said:&#8211; Thus saying S&#8217;ukrâchârya hurriedly went away, infuriated with anger. Brihaspatî was glad and remained there with his mind calm. Brihaspatî then knowing the Daityas cursed by S&#8217;ukrâchârya, assumed his real appearance, left that place, and hurriedly returned to Indra. He began to say &#8220;I have undoubtedly succeeded in my undertaking; the Daityas have been cursed and left by me too. They are now helpless; so, O Good Suras! I have made them cursed, you would better now try to fight with them.&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>The founder of Virashaivism, Basava (initially a Shaiva Brahmin), was the chief minister of the Kalachuri king Bijjala, a staunch Jain with his capital at Kalyana in modern day Karnataka. The Basava Purana, a long hagiography dedicated to Basava narrates that not only did he successfully plot a regicide, but also sanctified violence against Jains, in rather gruesome ways such as putting “a sharp spear on the skulls of Jains&#8221;. Such an ideology fell in line with Virashaivism’s idea of opposing the caste system and ostentatious rituals, tenets that made the new religion popular with the masses in no time. Being the religion dominating Karnataka in the early medieval era, Jainism took the greatest hit and saw a sharp fall in its following.</p>
<p>Apart from vying for political patronage, the Lingayats (followers of Virashaivism) also started appropriating and converting Jaina basadis (shrines) into Virashaiva temples, an act that not only signified Virashaiva strength, but was also a practical necessity for a nascent religion with not enough resources to build a new temple from scratch.</p>
<p>Basava&#8217;s anniversary is celebrated across India mainly in Karnataka on the pretext that he was a social reformer let&#8217;s have a look at what Basava Purana the sacred text of Lingayat says about Jainism. Basava is regarded as the incarnation of Nandi, The Basava Purana II.32 says that Narada reported to Siva that, while other religions were flourishing, the Saiva faith was with few exceptions dying out among the Brahmins and so decaying among other castes also; Siva then asked Nandin to become incarnate as the Virasaiva saint Basavanna to preach Virasaivism in keeping with orthodox dharma.</p>
<p>Jains in Basava Purana are called two-legged beasts, animals, dogs, etc, so much is the love for Jains from one of the biggest reformers of Hinduism. The following verses show how Jains were persecuted and Vasadis (Jain Shrines) were destroyed by devotees of Basava while Basava didn&#8217;t stop it and instead Basava praised his devotee for carrying out the persection,</p>
<p>Basava Purana, chapter VI &#8220;O Jain, is it appropriate for me to cut off my head and get it right back? No, I will cut it off now and walk the streets of this town for seven days and then get it back. Can you even watch me do that? <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Not only that, I will tear down all the Jain vasadis in Kalyana so that there will not even be one left for a sample. Furthermore, I will smash all the idols of Jina</span>. This is my vow. Is there any reason why I should not subject you <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">two-legged beasts</span></strong> to this?&#8221; he said. The Jains agreed to his proposal. They all gathered together and sat on one side and watched. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">On the other side sat Basava with the devotees in attendance</span></strong>. Bijjala and his ministers were also there, along with all the people of the city young and old alike&#8230;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Basava praised him</span>; the devotees cheered him on..For seven days, Ekanta Ramayya strode though the city. Then he went and stood in front of the temple gate and cried out, &#8216;Come on now, you Jains, you have seen my vow!&#8221;&#8230;  The Jains gave him an acknowledgement of his victory, written by the king. And they all come and bowed down before the assembly of devotion. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">On each person&#8217;s face the devotees impressed the marks of Siva</span>. With cries and roars, the heroic assembly of mahesvara rose up. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">They quickly destroyed all the Jain vasadis and broke the heads of all the Jina idols. When they were finished, there was not a trace of a Jain vasadi or a Jina idol in all of Kalyana. In a fury, the devotees harassed and killed every known Jain and smashed them all into the ground</span>. The devotees of Black Throat responded by praising the peerless courage of Ekanta Ramayya. Meanwhile, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Basava worshipped Ekanta Ramayya</span> as if he were Sangamesa&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Velcheru Narayana Rao</p>
<p>Basava Purana Chapter VI &#8220;Therefore, it is not within your capacity to know our Lingadeva&#8217;s power. Ramanatha is everything, but yet the nondevotees are not capable of gaining him. Don&#8217;t say that this has never been proven! If you simply ask me to, I will give you visible evidence. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">It is well known there are seven hundred Jain vasadis in Potlaceruvu, and I am going to have them all destroyed. You are mere animals</span>. What more can I say to you?&#8221; Tr. Velcheru Narayana Rao</p>
<p>Some Jains tried to kill Tirunavakarisa in unsuccessful attempts and they were scared that he would kill them so they converted to Shaivism but this didn&#8217;t stop Tirunavakarisa, he destroyed many Jain shrines and broke the idols of Jains.</p>
<p>Basava Purana Chapter VI &#8220;&#8230;When the Jains were unable to kill him by any means whatsoever, they began to be afraid that he would kill them. So those who had been tormenting him asked him for refuge, and he protected them. He wiped out their old marks and gave them rudraksa, ashes, and the rest of the five marks. In a rage, he destroyed all the Jain images and wrecked all the Jain vasadis. &#8216;For doing so, Tirunavakarisa became known as the destroyer of the Jains&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Velcheru Narayana Rao</p>
<p>Nowadays many Hindus try to bring Jains and Buddhists within the Hindu fold so as to increase the numbers in population and also claims that Hinduism believes all religion to be true but a story from Basava Purana says how Pilla Narayana converted 2000 Buddhists and drove away the Buddhist saint,</p>
<p>Basava Purana Chapter VI &#8220;There was a Buddhist guru who was attended by two thousand disciples. Pilla Nayanaru drove the guru away and converted the two thousand Buddhists into devotees of Siva.&#8221; Tr. Velcheru Narayana Rao</p>

<h3><a id="Shudras-Buddhism"></a>Shudras will embrace Buddhism and Jainism</h3>
<p>Hindu scriptures predicted that some Shudras will embrace Buddhism and Jainism,</p>
<p>Kurma Purana I.30.13 &#8220;When the close of Yuga is imminent, Sudras calling themselves Jinas (subduers of sense organs) will perform holy rites by shaving off their heads, wearing ochre robes and black antelope skins and keeping their teeth white.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Vayu Purana Part I.58.59 &#8220;When the close of Yuga is imminent, Sudras exhibiting their white teeth, with clean shaven heads and wearing ohcrecoloured robes will perform sacred rites, proclaiming that they have conquered the sense organs.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare, edited by G.P. Bhatt</p>
<p>G.V. Tagare writes &#8220;Probably a reference to Buddhist monks, as Buddhism prevailed all over India at the time of these Puranas.&#8221;</p>
<p>G.V. Tagare explains the word Jina in the footnote as &#8220;This refers to Buddhist Bhiksus. The term &#8216;Jina&#8217; means &#8216;the subduer of sense organs&#8217; and is applied to the Buddha, Jainas (especially Digambaras) are mentioned in V.16 below.&#8221;</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 5.6.11 &#8220;Believing in the blind tradition the new way of life chosen by them but which is unsupporter by the Vedas, they of their own accord will fall into dark abymsalhell.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Harivamsa Purana 3.3.17 &#8220;Shudras with white teeth, anjan in eyes, shaven head and wearing ochre clothes will earn their livelihood, following the dharma of shakyabuddha.&#8221; Tr. A. Purushothaman and A. Harindranath</p>
<p>Narada Purana I.41.54-55 &#8220;The Sudras will not serve the twice-born. Assuming the airs of heretics, the base-born assume and practice holy rites of the Brahmanas. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The Sudras will clothe themselves in ochre-robes</span>; they will have matted hair; they will smear ashes all over their bodies. Thus equipped and employing deceptive arguments, they will begin to expatiate on Dharma. [58-] Occupying excellent seats, Sudras will expatiate on Dharma-religious duties-to Brahmans who habitually destroy Dharma. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">These and many other heretics such as nude ascetics (Digambaras), red-roled mendicants, will roam about; most of whom will be decrying the Vedas</span>. [71] After the advent of the Kali age, Sudras and outcastes will become kings and the Brahmans will be engaged in rendering service to them. They will be begging for alms&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>

<p>Manu Smriti 2.10-11 &#8220;The Veda is called the S&#8217;ruti, and the Dharma S&#8217;astra is called the Smriti.

Dutt</p>
<p>Hindu scholar Medhatithi the commentator of Manu Smriti wrote on this verse,</p>

<p>Vishnu Purana narrates the story of a Hindu king named Satadhanu who on account of his conversation with heretics was reborn as a dog, it explicitly considers conversing with non-Hindus as a grave sin leading to severe punishments,</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 3.18.48-50 &#8220;Men fall into hell who converse with one who takes his food without offering a portion to the gods, the sages, the manes, spirits, and guests. Let therefore a prudent person carefully avoid the conversation, or the contact, and the like, of those heretics who are rendered impure by their desertion of the three Vedas…[56-63] On one occasion, when they had fasted on the full moon of Kártika, and had bathed in the Bhagirathí, they beheld, as they came up from the water, a heretic approach them, who was the friend of the Rájá&#8217;s military preceptor. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The Rájá, out of respect to the latter, entered into conversation with the heretic</span>; but not so did the princess; reflecting that she was observing a fast, she turned from him, and cast her eyes up to the sun. On their arrival at home, the husband and wife, as usual, performed the worship of Vishńu, agreeably to the ritual. After a time the Rájá, triumphant over his enemies, died; and the princess ascended the funeral pile of her husband. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">In consequence of the fault committed by Śatadhanu, by speaking to an infidel when he was engaged in a solemn fast, he was born again as a dog</span>…[74-81] &#8220;Dost thou not remember, oh king, the circumstance of conversing with a heretic, which I called to thy recollection when thou wast a dog…she exclaimed, &#8220;recollect yourself: away with this uncouth form, to which the sin of conversing with a heretic has condemned you…<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Such, Maitreya, is the sin of conversing with a heretic, and such are the expiatory effects of bathing after the solemn sacrifice of a horse</span>, as I have narrated them to you. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Let therefore a man carefully avoid the discourse or contact of an unbeliever</span>, especially at seasons of devotion, and when engaged in the performance of religious rites preparatory to a sacrifice…[103-4] <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Men, indeed, fall into hell as the consequence of only conversing with those who unprofitably assume the twisted hair, and shaven crown; with those who feed without offering food to gods, spirits, and guests; and those who are excluded from the presentation of cakes, and libations of water, to the manes</span>.&#8221; Tr.

<p>Heretics here refer to Buddhists and Jains, reading the entire chapter of Vishnu Purana will help understand this better.</p>

<h2><a id="persecution"></a>Persecution of Buddhists and Jains</h2>
<p>Hindu scriptures spewing venom against Buddhists and Jains and calling their faith as false religions resulted in persecution of Buddhists and Jains by Hindus. There was no large-scale persecution at once but there was a systematic ethnic cleansing of Buddhists and Jains in India that annihilated them. Even Hindu scholars agree that Buddhism and Jainism were prevalent religions in India, but their population has been reduced to a miniscule population due to the persecution, Swami Vivekandanda wrote,</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">And such was his heart that he burnt to death lots of Buddhist monks &#8212; by defeating them in argument! And the Buddhists, too, were foolish enough to burn themselves to death</span>, simply because they were worsted in argument! <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">What can you call such an action on Shankara&#8217;s part except fanaticism?</span> But look at Buddha&#8217;s heart! Ever ready to give his own life to save the life of even a kid &#8212; what to speak of &#8220;[(Sanskrit)]&#8211; for the welfare of the many, for the happiness of the many&#8221;!

<p>Swami Prabhupada the founder of ISKCON wrote,</p>
<p>&#8220;The exact word used in Sanskrit is <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">nāstika, which refers to one who does not believe in the Vedas</span> but manufactures some concocted system of religion. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu has said that the followers of the Buddhist system of religion are nāstikas</span>. In order to establish his doctrine of nonviolence, Lord Buddha flatly refused to believe in the Vedas, and thus, later on, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Śaṅkarācārya stopped this system of religion in India and forced it to go outside India</span>.&#8221; <strong>Swami Prabhupada on Srimad Bhagavatam 4.2.30</strong><br />

<p>Swami Apurvanand, an author from Vivekananda&#8217;s tradition, describes, on the authority of an ancient text &#8220;Shankara Vijay&#8221; by Anandagiri, how Dharmapala, a Bouddha Aacharya of Nalanda Boudha Vidyapitha was defeated in &#8216;shastrartha&#8217; i.e. interpreting old existing texts, without trying to elucidate new principles, by Kumarila Bhatta. Kumarila, an uncle of Buddhist scholar Dharmakirti, being defeated and humiliated by Dharmakirti, decided to study Buddhist shastras as he thought &#8216;it is always necessary to study the enemy before attacking it&#8217; and joined Nalanda in the guise of a disciple of Dharmapala, in order to acquire enough knowledge of Buddhism so as to defeat Buddha&#8217;s doctrine. After studying Buddhism for some time, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">he challenged his guru Dharmapala, defeated him in &#8216;shastrartha&#8217;, and saw his guru embrace &#8216;tushanal&#8217; i.e. a funeral pyre made up of hay and dry wood. Dharmapala declared before being burnt alive</span>, &#8220;I am defeated by brilliance of Kumarila, but still I believe in supremacy of Buddha&#8217;s doctrine, I am not deviated at all from Buddha, His Dhamma or His Sangha, and <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">so I would renounce my life rather than renounce Buddhism</span>&#8220;. This is an account from a Brahmanic book and not from a Buddhist one. Shastrartha, Swamiji tells us, involved scholarship i.e.. an ability to quote from ancient texts, literary acumen, ability to debate and argue without cause, without logic, demonstration of so called yogic powers etc. [Swami Apurvananda, &#8220;Aacharya Shankara&#8221; 2nd edition. 1989, (Marathi translation of Bengali book), Ramakrishna Matha, Dhantoli, Nagpur, p. 94 ff.] <a href="http://www.ambedkar.org/research/Holi__A_Festival_To_Commomorate_Bahujan_Burning.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">http://www.ambedkar.org/research/Holi__A_Festival_To_Commomorate_Bahujan_Burning.htm<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>Swami Dayanand Saraswati the founder of Arya Samaj wrote,</p>
<p>&#8220;About 2,200 years ago Shankaracharya, a Braahmana of Dravid (Southern India), studied Grammar and all other Shaastras- books on Logic, Philosophy, Metaphysics, Theology, etc. &#8211; during student life, and seeing the religious degradation of his country began to soliloquies thus:- &#8220;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">What a pity! The true theistic Vedic religion has disappeared, whilst the atheistic Jain religion has prevailed to the great detriment of the people. This (i.e., the Jain religion) must be put down somehow</span>.&#8221; Shankarcharya had not only read the Shaastras but also the Jain scriptures. He was also a powerful debater&#8230;He began to think as to what was the best method of overthrowing Jainism. At last he came to the conclusion that preaching and holding discussions with the Jainis were the best methods to put down Jainism. With this object in view he went to Ujjain (in Central India). King Sudhanwa then ruled there&#8230;He went to the king and said &#8220;You have read the Jain books as well as Sanskrit, and also believe in the Jain Religion. I, therefore ask you to arrange a discussion between the exponents of the Jain religion and myself on the condition that the vanquished party should embrace the religion of the victor and that you should also accept his faith&#8230;For ten years he toured all over the country, refuted Jainism and advocated the Vedic religion. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">All the broken images that are now-a-days dug out of the earth were broken in the time of Shankar</span>, whilst those that are found whole here and there under the ground had been buried by the Jainis for fear of their being broken (by those who had renounced Jainism)&#8230;At that time this country was very rich, and its people were also patriotic. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Shankar, King Sudhanwa and other kings had not had the Jain temples pulled down as they intended to establish schools therein to teach the Vedas and other Shaastras</span>.&#8221; <strong>Satyarth Prakash, by Swami Dayanand Sasarwati, Ch 11, page 345-7, Tr.

<p>As per Dayanand, Shankaracharya and Sudhanva did not demolish Jain temples because they had intended to use them for the teaching of the Vedas. This means if they had infrastructure they would&#8217;ve demolished it. This is clear proof of how non-Hindu worship places were appropriated by Hindus. Swami Dayanand writes that Jainism had once prevailed in India,</p>
<p>&#8220;The Jainees differ from them. Mahavira and Gautama Gandharas (lords of hosts) are called Buddhas by the Buddhists, while they have been named Ganthara and Kinavara by the Jainees. Raja Shiva Prashad whose forefathers have been Jaiinees for generations together writes in their Chapter of his book called Itihas Timirnashak that Jina lived altogether about 1,000 years before Swami Shankarcharya. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The Buddhist or the Jain religion prevailed in the whole of Bharatavarsha (India)</span>. He then adds the following footnote. &#8220;By the term Bauddha (Buddhist religion) we mean that anti-Vedic religion which prevailed in all India from the time of Gandhar Mahavir, or Gautama Swami to that of Swami Shankar&#8221;<strong> Satyarth Prakash, by Swami Dayanand, Ch 12, p.524, Tr.

<p>Madhavacharya also wrote that Buddhism and Jainism dominated India,</p>
<p>&#8220;The land became full of Buddhists, and the adherents of the Vedas dwindled. So I planned to overcome these Buddhists and re-establish the dominance of the Vedic religion. Their leaders, along with the disciples, have been going about converting all kings to their faith and instigating them to reject the Vedas&#8230;[Kumarila said] I recognise you as an incarnation of Guha born for the eradication of Buddhists.&#8221; <strong>Sankara Dig Vijaya 7.77-106, by Madhavacharya, Tr. Swami Tapasyanand</strong></p>
<p>He also wrote about ending Buddhism and Jainism,</p>
<p>&#8220;Thus did the king, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">whom Skanda (Kumarila) converted, free the country from the menace of Buddhists and Jains</span>, just as the obstacles in the path of Yoga are eradicated by a wise sage. And simultaneously, just as the light of the rising sun obliterates the darkness of night, the preachings of the Vedic truth by that Brahmana sage reversed the pace of the ignorance produced by the heretical teachings. When the elephants of Jaina and Buddhist heretics disappeared because of the roaming lion of Kumarila, the tree of Vedic wisdom began to spread everywhere with luxuriant foliage. As the fire-born Kumarila was thus resuscitating the Vedic path of Karma, Lord Siva condescended to be born in order to save the world floundering in the ocean of transmigratory existence.&#8221; <strong>Sankara Dig Vijaya 1.95-98, by Madhavacharya, Tr. Swami Tapasyanand</strong></p>
<p>There is a story mentioned in Skanda Purana about a king who embraced Jainism. And was later forced to reconvert to Hinduism by the Brahmins. The text depicts Jainism negatively. Kumarapala (1143-1172 A.D) was a Shaivite king and he was converted to Jainism by the Jain saint named Acharya Hemachandra. King Kumarapala stopped appeasing the Brahmins, he forbade animal slaughter which was part of Vedic Yajna (sacrifices), and he took away their authority and possessions so they went away from the kingdom and resided elsewhere. Kumarapala stripping the Brahmins off their authority is what irked the Brahmins and was the main cause of all these things. Then another king who was the father-in-law of Kumarapala summoned them and inquired about everything and told them to go to Kumarpala and to ask him to return their possession. Kumarapala refused and criticized the Vedic sacrifices that includes slaughtering animals and all. This angered the Brahmins, so after praying to Hanuman they received a talisman that was hair (purportedly of Hanuman) and threw it in the palace which burnt everything, the Jain mendicants fled for their lives.</p>
<p>Skanda Purana III.ii.36.46-62 &#8220;&#8230;They came to the brave king Ama stationed in Kanyakubja, who was surrounded by heretics. After arriving at the city of Kanyakubja, O king, they stayed for a few days on the banks of Ganga. Those Modha Brahmanas became tired. The king was informed by spies and they were brought to his presence&#8230;Even as the Brahmanas were standing, he asked all of them,&#8217;O Brahmanas, tell (it now) why you have come. What is the matter?&#8217; The Brahmanas said: O king, we have come here from Dharmaranya to you. (It is) your son-in-law Kumarapala (Kumbhipala in v43) by whom the edict of authority of the Brahmanas, which was wonderful, has been destroyed. He has done so, because he follows the Jaina cult and has been instigated by Indrasuri&#8230;On hearing the words of the Brahmanas, the king, spoke to them: &#8216;You all may go quickly and at my behest say to King Kumarapala: Return the settlement of the Brahmanas to them.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Skanda Purana III.ii.36.34-38 &#8220;On hearing this straight from his preceptor, the powerful ruler of Kanyakubja named Ama continued to rule the kingdom. He became an emperor and was keen in protecting the subjects. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Due to the advent of Kali, the subjects became inclined to commit sins. Inciting by Ksapanas (Buddhist mendicants) and following their instructions</span>, the subjects gave up their Vaisnava cult and adopted the Buddhist way of life. [46] All the different castes were converted to Jaina cult. Brahmanas were not honoured. No religious rites like Santika and Paustika were performed. No one ever used to perform charity. Time passed like this.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>People committing sins embraced Buddhism and Jainism. So people embracing other religions like Buddhism and Jainism is seen negatively here, it says that people were inclined to commit sins and the very next line talks about those people converting to Buddhism and Jainism.</p>
<p>King Kumarapala replied to them,</p>
<p>Skanda Purana III.ii.36.62 &#8220;[Kumarapala said] O Brahmanas, I shall not abide and honour the Royal Charter issued by Rama. I disown the Brahmanas who indulge in violence and kill animals in Yajna. There is no question of my having any respect for and devotion to these killers.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Kumarapala had embraced the Jain religion. And then this happened,</p>
<p>Skanda Purana III.ii.38.14-24 &#8220;[The king said] May all of you go where Rama and Hanuman are staying. Rama will give everything. What for did you come here, O Brahmanas? I will never give. I will never give even a Varatika (a cowrie); no village and no means of livelihood. Go wherever it pleases you. On hearing the terrible words, the Brahmanas were excited with anger. They said, &#8216;Well, suffer the anger of Rama and Hanuman now.&#8217; After saying this, they threw down the packet of hair from the left armpit given by Hanuman in the abode of the kind. The excellent Brahmanas then retired. When the group of the Brahmanas departed, the whole place was ablaze with columns of flames. Everything became full of flames of fire. All the royal paraphernalia got enveloped in fire: the umbrellas, the chowries, the treasury rooms, the arsenals etc. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The queens, the princes, the elephants and many horses, the vehicles and conveyances of all sorts all were completely burning</span>&#8230;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Seeing everything burnt down, the naked Jaina mendicants, trembling again and again, took in their hands their pots, auspicious sticks, red blankets and without shoes or sandals fled away to ten directions</span>.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>For the fear of being killed by the Brahmins&#8217; talisman the King Kumarpala as well as his subjects who had resorted to Jainism reverted to Vaishnavite Hinduism and the authority of Brahmins was reinstated by the king,</p>
<p>Skanda Purana III.ii.38.30-48 &#8220;The king ran on foot here and there alone and lamenting enquired, &#8216;Where are the Brahmanas?&#8217; On hearing from the people, the king went to that place where the Brahmanas (were resting). O king after going there suddenly, he caught hold immediately of the feet of the Brahmanas. The king fell down unconscious. Repeating the name of the son of Dasaratha, &#8216;Rama, Rama&#8217;, the king with deep humility spoke these words to the Brahmanas: &#8216;I am the servant of the servant of that Rama and of Brahmanas. I had become blind through the darkness of ignorance&#8230;Whatever you desire, I shall grant it. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Devotion to Brahmanas as well as to Rama should (will) always be engaged in by me</span>. I shall never do anything other than these, O Brahmanas.&#8217; On that occasion, O king, the Brahmanas became merciful. In order to quell the curse, they threw the other packet. When the hairs were thrown, the army regained life. The quarters became clear and pure&#8230;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">As before, the common people became obedient to Brahmanas. Excepting the Visnu cult, they did not know (i.e. recognize) any other religious belief</span>. A new letter of authority legally binding as before was issued. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Heretics were banished, duly making the scripture hold good. Those outside the pale of the Vedas including the good, the middling and the lowly disappeared</span>&#8230;&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Now I shall ask all those Hindus who say that Buddhism and Jainism are accepted in Hinduism if so then why did people converting to Jainism irked the Brahmins? Why do Hindu scriptures talk so negatively about Jainism? Hemchandra also died after he lost a debate as Brahmins had made it a custom to burn Buddhists and Jain scholars after defeating them in debates. There is a different version that Kumarpala embraced Shaivism, eminent historian Romila Thapar wrote,</p>
<p>&#8220;A sixteenth century text narrates that Hemachandra was defeated in a debate and sentenced to death whereupon Kumarapala reconverted to Shaivism.&#8221; <strong>Somnath: The many voices of a history, by Romila Thapar, p.116, Published by Penguin books, 2008.</strong></p>
<p>Romila Thapar cited the reference of Gadadhara, Sampradaya Pradipa, quoted in A.K. Majumdar, Chalukyas of Gujarat, p.329 ff.</p>
<p>Kumarapala&#8217;s nephew and also his successor Ajayapala is said to have demolished many Jain temples, Romila Thapar wrote,</p>
<p>&#8220;It is strange that the brahmans did not ask Hanuman for a talisman against the Turks. Kumarapala&#8217;s successor, Ajayapla, is said to have desecrated Jaina temples and looted others and supported the Shaiva religion. His son, also a zealous Shaiva, worshipped at the Somanatha.&#8221;- <strong>Somnath: The many voices of a history, by Romila Thapar, p.116, Published by Penguin books, 2008</strong></p>
<p>Another historian wrote,</p>
<p>&#8220;However, Ajaypala, nephew and successor of Kumarpala was a Saivite. He subjucated Jains. Mihirakula ended the Gupta kingdom c. 480 CE. He was considered as an opponent by the Jains because he created policies to subjucate Jainism.&#8221; Glasenapp 1999, p. 52, as mentioned in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Jainism" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Jainism<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>&#8220;According to the Prabandhachintarnani Ajayapala destroyed the Jain temples built by his uncle. He showed no favour to Ambada and Kumzirapala&#8217;s other Jain ministers&#8221; <strong>Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency: pt. 1.

<p>Hindus have started a new trend of blaming Muslims, Hindus are blaming Muslims for the caste system, They say that Sati Pratha was also due to Muslims despite the fact that their scriptures encourage Sati Pratha, They also claim that child marriage in India is also because of Muslims even when Swami Vivekananda refuted this claim, they blame foreigners for almost every evil of their religion. And they also blame Muslims for the fall of Buddhism in India. It&#8217;s true that some Muslim conquerors may have been cruel towards Buddhists like the demolition of Nalanda but this cannot be taken as Muslims annihilated Buddhists, do Hindus mean to say that the demolition of Nalanda annihilated Buddhists from India? An important question is If Muslims wiped out Buddhism from India then why did they spare Hinduism? Hindus have their answer ready, they claim that Hindus defended the religion. But who really defended it? Even Hindu rulers who are considered &#8216;brave warriors&#8217; by Hindutvadis were defeated by Muslims. Prithviraj Chauhan couldn&#8217;t fight the army of Muhammad Ghori so he had to make an alliance with neighboring Rajpur kings and lost the second battle, Maharana Pratap lost the war against Mughal in which the commander was a Rajput, Shivaji was captured by Mughals and escaped and never had the courage to fight in a war and resorted to guerilla tactics. His son Sambhaji was executed by the Mughals, Marathas lost the third Panipat war, and Rana Sanga lost to Babur. Muslims reached Deccan India within the 13<sup>th</sup> century and ruled till Britishers invaded India. So Hindu rulers should have repelled the Muslim invasion if they were so powerful, but they failed to do so which proves that Muslim rulers overpowered them. Now, these same Hindus spread false information that the Hindu population in Pakistan and Bangladesh has declined in the last 70 years. Imagine if the Hindu population can decline without the government&#8217;s support in 70 years then what could&#8217;ve been done in 800 years by Muslim rulers.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">So why didn&#8217;t Muslim rulers annihilate Hindus like they annihilated Buddhists?</span></p>
<p>The answer is, that Muslims didn&#8217;t annihilate Buddhists and Jains but Hindus did! Buddhism was on its deathbed when Muslims arrived in India. This was because of the systematic persecution of Buddhists and Jains by Hindu rulers and scholars. Genocide of Buddhists and Jains started many centuries before Muslims arrived in India. Pushyamitra Sunga (185 BC-149 BC) had persecuted thousands of Buddhist monks and demolished many Stupas and Viharas. Hindus love to quote Dr. B.R. Ambedkar on this issue. Dr. Ambedkar wrote articles on the persecution of Buddhists by Hindus but Hindus prefer to quote the last line wherein he blames Muslim invaders for <span style="text-decoration: underline;">giving a death blow to Buddhism in India</span>. Vinay Lal a Professor of History and Asian American Studies at UCLA wrote,</p>
<p>&#8220;On this view, Buddhism found competition in Islam for converts among low-caste Hindus. Even Ambedkar, whose animosity towards Hinduism is palpable, was nonetheless firmly of the view that Islam dealt Buddhism a death blow. As he was to put it, &#8220;brahmanism beaten and battered by the Muslim invaders could look to the rulers for support and sustenance and get it. Buddhism beaten and battered by the Muslim invaders had no such hope. It was uncared for orphan and it withered in the cold blast of the native rulers and was consumed in the fire lit up by the conquerors.&#8221; Ambedkar was quite certain that this was &#8220;the greatest disaster that befell the religion of Buddha in India.&#8221; We thus find Ambekdar embracing the &#8220;sword of Islam thesis&#8221;: &#8220;The sword of Islam fell heavily upon the priestly class. It perished or it fled outside India. Nobody remained alive to keep the flame of Buddhism burning.&#8221; [3] There are, of course, many problems with this view. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The &#8220;sword of Islam&#8221; thesis remains controversial, at best, and many reputable historians are inclined to dismiss it outright</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Islam was, moreover, a late entrant into India, and Buddhism was showing unmistakable signs of its decline long before Islam became established in the Gangetic plains, central India, and the northern end of present-day Andhra and Karnataka</span>.&#8221; &#8211; Buddhism&#8217;s Disappearance from India, by Vinay Lal <a href="https://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/southasia/Religions/paths/BuddhismDisappear.doc" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">https://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/southasia/Religions/paths/BuddhismDisappear.doc<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>As Vinay Lal rightly pointed out, Buddhism had already declined long before the advent of Muslims in India hence Muslim rulers cannot be blamed for the disappearance of Buddhism in India. As Hindu fanatics are very fond of quoting one line of Dr. Ambedkar out of context, Let me quote some passages on the persecution of Buddhists and Jains written by Dr. Ambedkar&#8217;s followers,</p>
<p>&#8220;Formerly a feudatory of Chalukya, Dantidurga was the founder of Rastrakuta dynasty, a strong, aggresive and militant supporter of Brahmanism. Cave XV at Ellora called Dasavtara, which has a long undated inscription of Dantidurga carved on its entrance, was originally a Buddhist Vihara, which was converted to Brrahmanic Temple, by chiseling out Buddhist images. [Yazdani G., &#8216;Early History of Deccan&#8217;, Oxford Univ. Press, 1960, p.731]
<p>&#8220;Damodarvarman, who is regarded predecessor of Attivarman, was devotee of Samyak Sambuddha. The Kapoteswara temple at Chezarla of fourth century was a originally a chaitya hall later converted into a brahmanic temple. He is described as son of king who performed Hiranyagarbha mahadana. Attivarman, worshiper of Sambhu, performed this mahadana. [D. C. Sarkar, &#8216;Classical age&#8217; p.202 ff.]
<p>&#8220;For it was in the Dark Age that religious persecution began in India. Monasteries were demolished, monks were banished, and books were burnt: and wherever the Rajputs became rulers, Buddhist edifices went down and Hindu temples arose. By the end of the 10th century, Buddhism was practically stamped out from India, and the work of destruction was completed by the Muslims who succeeded the Rajputs as masters of India.&#8221; [Epochs of Indian History, by R. C. Dutt]

<p>&#8220;&#8230; Under his (Sankara&#8217;s) very supervision, the Buddhist, their statues and monument at Nagarjunakonda were destroyed. A.H. Longhurst, who conducted excavations at Nagarjunkonda, has recorded it in his invaluable book: &#8216;Memoir of the Archaeological Survey of India&#8217; No.54, The Buddhist Antiquities of Nagarjunkonda, by A.H.Longhurst, Delhi, 1938, p.6.</p>
<p>&#8220;The ruthless manner in which all the buildings at Nagarjunakonda have been destroyed is simply appalling and cannot represent the work of treasure seekers alone as so many of the pillars, statues, and sculptures have been wantonly smashed to pieces. Had there been a town close at hand a Amaravati, one can understand the site being used as a quarry by modern builders as was so often done in India. But this never occurred at Nagarjunakonda as there are no towns and no cart roads in or out of the valley. Local tradition relates that the great Hindu philosopher and teacher Shankaracharya of medieval times came to Nagarjunakonda with a host of followers and destroyed the Buddhist monument. Be this as it may, the fact remains that the cultivated lands in the valley on which ruined buildings stand represent a religious grant made to Shankaracharya and it was only with the sanction of the present religious Head of the followers of the great teacher that I was to conduct the excavations. This same Brahmin pontiff, who resides at Pushpagiri in the Guntur District, also owns the Srisailam temple in the Nallamalais, which no doubt was acquired in the same manner as it seems to have been a Buddhist site originally.&#8221; [Bhagwan K.S.: 1986: 14]

<p>Historians discover a Jain inscription at Quilashpur<br />
Speaking on this discovery, Mr Reddy said, “Stones one foot tall and two feet wide were used for the construction of this wall. During the Kakatiya rule, Jainism was opposed and Shaivism came to prominence. As result, all the Jain temples, basadis, inscriptions etc., were destroyed. Remnants of these temples can still be seen at several places within the perimeter of this village. These remnants were used for the construction of this fort. Along with this inscription, several stones with Jain symbols are also found on the wall.”<br />

<p>Buddhist religious scriptures such as the Asokavadana allege that the first Shunga king Pusyamitra (an orthodox Brahmin) was hostile towards Buddhists and persecuted the Buddhist faith. Buddhist wrote that he &#8221;destroyed monasteries and killed monks&#8221; 84000 Buddhists stupas which had been built by Asoka were destroyed (R. Thaper), and 100 gold coins were offered for the head of each Buddhist monk. In addition Buddhist dources allege that a large number of Buddhist monasteries (Viharas) were converted to Hindu temples, in such places as Nalanda, Bodhgaya, Sarnath, or Mathura. More overt forms of Hindu hostility to Buddhism also played a role&#8230;There were episodes of Hindu persecution of Buddhists starting in the 6th century. Furthermore, the Buddha was described as an incarnation of the god Vishnu, who came to earth to delude demons (or people depending on the text) into denying the authority of the Vedas, in order to lead them to Hell. Shankara, the great Hindu philosopher and reformer, described the Buddha as an enemy of the people{17}.- Light from the East: Eastern Wisdom for the Modern West pg 192, By Harry Oldmeadow</p>
<p>&#8220;84,000 Buddhist stupas which had been built by Ashoka were &#8220;destroyed&#8221; (R. Thaper), and 100 gold coins were offered for the head of each Buddhist monk (Indian Historical Quarterly Vol. XXII, p.81 ff cited in Hars.407, also Divyavadana, p.429-434)</p>
<p>There is also archaeological evidence to prove that Buddhist worship place were destroyed by Pushyamitra Sunga, the Deorkothar Stupa was destroyed by Pushyamitra Sunga which P.K. Mishra (Archaeological Survey of India) discovered Deorkothar in 1982 with Ajit Singh and returned to excavate the site in 1999. <a href="http://archive.archaeology.org/online/news/deorkothar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">http://archive.archaeology.org/online/news/deorkothar/<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>&#8220;The Buddhist accounts are unanimous in representing Pushyamitra Sunga as a persecutor of Buddhism. His persecution started in Magadha where it is said he tried unsuccessfully to destroy the famous Kukkutarama monastery in Ptaliaputra. He went up to Sakala to execute his policy of persecution. There he offered a reward of 100 dinaras for the head of every Buddhist monk. The Buddhist account further tell us that his policy involved him in a war with a Yaksha named Krimisa and ultimately brought about his death at a place called Sthulakostha. This evidence cannot be completely discarded.&#8221; A Comprehensive History of India, Volume 2, p.364, K.

<p>A 15<sup>th</sup> century Lama named Taranatha wrote that many of the Buddhist worship places were restored by another king after the reign of Pushyamitra,</p>
<p>&#8220;It is clear that when he was residing at Sri Parvata these damages were done by the Brahman king Pusyamitra. So this appears to be the begining of the decline (of the Doctorine).<br />
After that, king Phanicandra was ruling in Magadha. During this time, in Gauda of Bhangala in the east, there was the king Gauda Vardhana with great power and wealth. He rebuilt the monasteries previously damaged and thus helped the centres to increase.&#8221; Tāranātha&#8217;s History of Buddhism in India By Tāranātha, Ch 16, p.121, Motilal Banarsidass Publ., 1990</p>
<p>Some Hindus instead of condemning what Pushyamitra did, start defending him just because he was a Hindu. The only reference they furnish is Sanchi and Barhut stupas inscriptions which say &#8216;During the supremacy of Shungas&#8217;. They attribute these to Pushyamitra and cite them as an example of his secularism, but according to historians these were built by his successors,</p>
<p>&#8220;Buddhist stupa at Sanchi, India. (Mark Weiss) destroyed by Pushyamitra and then restored by his successor, Agnimitra. Similarly, N.N. Ghosh (1945) writes that the gateway of Bharhut was built not during the reign of Pushyamitra but by his successors, who followed a more tolerant policy toward Buddhism as compared to Pushyamitra, a leader of Brahmanic reaction. The destruction and burning of the great monastery of Ghositarama at Kaushambi in the second century BC is also attributed to the Sungas. For instance, J.S. Negi (1958) notes that G.R. Sharma, who was responsible for most of the excavation work at Kaushambi, was inclined to connect this phenomenon with the persecution of Buddhism by Pushuamitra.&#8221; Popular Controversies in World History: Investigating History&#8217;s Intriguing Questions [4 volumes]: Investigating History&#8217;s Intriguing Questions, p.97, by Steven L. Danver, ABC-CLIO, 22-Dec-2010</p>
<p>&#8220;Who was responsible for the wanton destruction of the original brick stupa of Ashoka and when precisely the great work of reconstruction was carried out is not known, but it seems probable that the author of the former was Pushyamitra, the first of the Shunga kings (184-148 BC), who was notorious for his hostility to Buddhism, and that the restoration was affected by Agnimitra or his immediate successor.&#8221; in John Marshall, A Guide to Sanchi, p. 38. Calcutta: Superintendent, Government Printing (1918).</p>
<p>No matter how much Hindutvadis defend Pushyamitr Sunga, Buddhist sources and archaeological evidence proves that he indeed persecuted Buddhists and destroyed their worship places. Another persecutor of Buddhists was Shaivite king Mihirakulu,</p>
<p>&#8220;The extensive landed property put at the disposal of the Buddhist institutions by emperor Kanisha, was confiscated by the new oppressive regimes to strengthen the Brahminic hegemony. The persecution of the Buddhists and destruction of their institutions began in the sixth century by the tyrant Mihirakulu were on a mass scale.&#8221; A social history of India By S. N. Sadasivan p.238, APH Publishing, 01-Jan-2000</p>
<p>&#8220;A patron of Shaivism (worship of the Hindu god Shiva), Mihirakula is recorded in Buddhist tradition as having been uncouth and extremely cruel.&#8221; <a href="http://www.britannica.com/biography/Mihirakula" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">http://www.britannica.com/biography/Mihirakula<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>&#8220;The greatest of royal persecutors of Buddhism in India was the Huna tryant Mihirakulu (Mahiragula). His sacrilegious acts against Buddhism are recorded by Kalhana and corroborated by Hsun-tsang and the Manjusrimulakalpa. The Kashmir historian compares Mihirakula with Yama, the god of death, for the former&#8217;s atrocities. At one place Kalhana remarks: &#8216;One&#8217;s tongue would become polluted if one attempted to record his cruelties and evil deeds in detail. From this authority we learn that Mihirakula patronized brahmanas, worshipped Siva, and erected a temple of Siva, called Mihiresvara in Srinagara.&#8221; Studies in the Buddhistic Culture of India During the 7th and 8th Centuries A.D, By Lal Mani Joshi, p.320, Motilal Banarsidass Publ., 1977</p>

<p>Some historians say that Hindus taking advantage of the chaos of invasion burned Nalanda. Read the article <a href="/index.php/2018/06/19/how-shankaracharya-destroyed-buddhism-and-founded-hinduism-in-the-8th-century/" data-wpel-link="internal">How Shankaracharya Destroyed Buddhism</a> for more information. Hindus blame Muslims for the destruction of Nalanda University but they remain mum on destruction of Nalanda by Hindu kings. During the war with Narasimha Gupta, the Hindu Hun king Mihirakula had destroyed Nalanda University. Narasimha Gupta after defeating Mihirakula had rebuilt the institution.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nalanda, no sooner it was founded by Sakraditya and extended by his son Buddhagupta-raja and his successor Tathagatagupta-raja, than was destroyed by Mihirakula&#8230;As to the second part, viz., &#8220;much blood will be split&#8221;, we have got archaeological evidence to show that Nalanda was destroyed more than once&#8230;&#8221; <strong>The University of Nalanda, p.43, by Hasmukh D.

<p>The author Hasmukh Dhirajlal Sankalia was an Indian Sanskrit scholar and archaeologist specialising in proto- and ancient Indian history. Mihirakula had not just demolished Buddhist Nalanda but had also uprooted Bodh Gaya tree under which Buddha used to meditate, but we rarely see Hindu radicals talking about these historical events as these don’t suit their vested interests. The destruction of Nalanda University by Hindu king Mihirakula is also mentioned in the book The Journal of the Bihar and Orissa Research Society, vol. 14, part 1, p.8-9, Published by the Bihar and Orissa Research Society, 1928, Printed by the Supreintendent, Government Printing, Bihar and Orissa. It is also worth noting that no modern books mention these atrocities by Hindu kings in the ancient period.</p>

<p><strong>Persecution of Jain at the hands of Basava Lingayat (Shaivite sub-sect) founder.</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;At the turn of the 12th century, followers of a revolutionary religious movement, Virashaivism (literally, heroic Shaivism), employed architectural reuse among other things to signal their triumph over Jainism, a rival religion.<br />
The founder of Virashaivism, Basava (initially a Shaiva Brahmin), was the chief minister of the Kalachuri king Bijjala, a staunch Jain with his capital at Kalyana in modern day Karnataka. The Basava Purana, a long hagiography dedicated to Basava narrates that not only did he successfully plot a regicide, but also sanctified violence against Jains, in rather gruesome ways such as putting “a sharp spear on the skulls of Jains&#8221;. Such an ideology fell in line with Virashaivism’s idea of opposing the caste system and ostentatious rituals, tenets that made the new religion popular with the masses in no time. Being the religion dominating Karnataka in the early medieval era, Jainism took the greatest hit and saw a sharp fall in its following.<br />
Apart from vying for political patronage, the Lingayats (followers of Virashaivism) also started appropriating and converting Jaina basadis (shrines) into Virashaiva temples, an act that not only signified Virashaiva strength, but was also a practical necessity for a nascent religion with not enough resources to build a new temple from scratch.<br />
Accordingly, as Julia Hegewald argues in her paper on temple conversions in Karnataka, the Lingayats appropriated and reused the Doddappa Temple at Adargunchi, Karnataka. Built sometime between 10th and 11th centuries, the temple today is fronted by a stone sculpture of the bull Nandi (Shiva’s vehicle) and houses a massive black stone statue of a Jina, placed alongside a Shiva linga (phallus, the form in which Lingayats worship Shiva).<br />
Save the image of the Jina, the entire temple was extensively rebuilt during the Virashaiva takeover of the basadi. Instead of destroying/mutilating the Jina statue, it was retained and painted with parallel white lines on the forehead, arms, shoulders and chest, an imitation in paint of the sacred white ash the Virashaivas often smear themselves with. The idea was to retain the statue as a “sign of domination and control” thereby sending a clear signal of Virashaiva’s triumph over Jainism.<br />
Another interesting example of such a reuse comes from the Megudi temple at Hallur, Karnataka. Here, as opposed to Aadargunchi, the temple was converted in situ, sans any extensive rebuilding.<br />
Constructed between the 7th and 9th centuries, the Megudi temple was reused as a Virashaiva shrine sometime in the 12th century. Here the Jina idol was uprooted from garbagriha, smeared with sacred Virashaiva ash, and placed in the central aisle that now leads to the sanctum sanctorum housing the Shiva linga. Such a placement of uprooted idol ensured that every devotee approaching the inner chamber would see the displaced Jina and be aware of the Virashaiva “annexation” of the temple.<br />
To further bolster the “conquered image” of the temple, two sculptures of the Jina adorning the main entrance have also been significantly disfigured even though all the other sculptures, inside and outside the temple, have been kept intact. Appropriations, as glaring as the above mentioned examples, must have inspired significant awe in the newly converted followers of Virashaivism and deep anxiety in the Jains.</p>

<p>&#8220;Scholars agreed that the inner first and second galleries, which contain narrative panels depicting Hindu scences, might have been carved at a later time possibly during the reign of Jayavarman VIII (r. 1243-1295) who was a bigoted Hindu king to have reputedly converted the Bayon into a Hindu temple and also damaged many other Buddhist buildings.&#8221; Roveda 1998: 131-150 as mentioned in Buddhist Architecture, By Le Huu Phuoc, p.263, Grafikol, 2010</p>

<p>&#8220;Not only theoretically did the Hindus attack Buddhism, but the hundreds of Buddhist monks were slaughtered, their temples destroyed and &#8221;the massacre of thousands of Bhuddist families was ordered by the sixth century c.e, Hindu king&#8221; Mihirakulu.[Heritage of Kashmir pg 58 by Muhammad Amin Pandit ]&#8221; Numerous Buddhist temples were taken over by the Brahmins, the most prominent being the shrine of Pas Pahar atop the Takht i Sulaiman overlooking the Dal Lake in Srinagar, Which was renamed the Shankaracharya temple and was dedicated to Jyesteswara or Shiva. The HIndu King Nara is said to have burnt down thousands of (Buddhist) Viharas [Islamic culture in Kashmir p.43, By G.M.D. Sofi]. Brahmanical hostility against the Buddhists persisted even in the period of Muslim rule. Thus, we learn that Udayagiri, the Brahmin Prime minister of Sultan Shahabuddin suggested to the king that to overcome his fiscal crisis he should loot the Buddhist temples and melt their idols to make coins. The King, however, responded with &#8221;indignation at this suggestion.&#8221;[Islamic culture in Kashmir p.139, By G.M.D. Sofi] But on the other hand, Muslim rulers allowed religious freedom and some of them even collected &#8221;books on the puranas, logic and Mimansa from different parts of India at considerable expense. These books were placed at the disposal of the scholars.

<p>&#8220;Shri K. R. Srinivasan has confirmed that what is now known as Anantasayangudi cave temple in Undavali was a temple of Vishnukundin times and originally a Buddhist temple which was converted to a Vishnu temple. [p. 33 and 81, &#8216;Temples of South India&#8217;] <a href="http://www.ambedkar.org/research/Rajput_Period_Was_Dark_Age_Of_India.htm" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">http://www.ambedkar.org/research/Rajput_Period_Was_Dark_Age_Of_India.htm<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>&#8220;Buddhist shrines were converted into Brahmincal ones, and Brahmincal legends called Kshetra Puranas, were engrafted on the Buddhist legends, and found a place in the Brahmanda and Skanda Puranas. Gayu, Bhuvaneswari, Sanchi, Puri, all come under the same category. Coming to Southern India, we have the well known places Tirupati and Conjeceram abaring in the same fate, the Buddhist phase of Tirupati having been an image of Padmapani, the Padma (lotus) being now covered by a Kavaeha (Sheath), while the image itself is passing by the name of Srinivasn. This fact was first known about 1850 to the employes in the inner part of the temple, when some parts of the Kaveha haing become too much loosened, had to undergo repairs. The real nature was at once discovered. But the matter was kept a profounf secret. Now are the Saiva temples of Conjeveram any way better; Conheveram, which had during the time of Hioun Thsand so many as 10000 Buddhist Bhikshus and about 100 Sangharanas, had its Sangharamas converted in the course of three following centuries into Saiva temples during the reign of Saiva kings. Even to day, a Jaina Buddhist temple is seen in a village two miles off, but which once formed part of it with a number of Jains living there and a large number of Buddhist statues are scattered about in the Saiva temples. The history of Indian temples architecture shows that most of these temples the exceptions are very few have undergone three stages: first, they were Buddhistic, then they became Saivite, ad lastly they were Vaishnava temples.&#8221; The Theosophist May 1891 to September 1891 By H.

<p>&#8220;According to Dr. Jayaprakash, a number of Buddha statues have been discovered at places like Ambalapuzha, Karunagapalli, Pallickal, Bharanikkavu, Mavelikara and Neelamperur in Kerala. &#8216;They are either in the form of smashed pieces or thrown away from viharas. Lord Ayyappa of Sabarimala and Lord Padmanabha at Thiruvananthapuram are the proxy images of Buddha being worshipped as Vishnu. Hundreds of Buddhists were killed on the banks of Aluva river. The term &#8216;Aluva&#8217; was derived from &#8216;Alawai&#8217; which means &#8216;Trisul&#8217;, a weapon used by Hindu fanatics to stab Buddhists. Similarly, on the banks of the Vaigai river in Tamilnadu, thousands of Buddhists were killed by the Vaishnava Saint, Sambanthar. Thevaram, a Tamil book, documents this brutal extermination of Buddhism.&#8217; <a href="http://www.milligazette.com/Archives/15042001/Art06.htm" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">http://www.milligazette.com/Archives/15042001/Art06.htm<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">HINDU KINGS PLUNDERING HINDU TEMPLES</span></strong></p>
<p>Muslim rulers like Mahmud Ghazni looting Somnath is seen as religious extremism but what will Hindutvadis call this?</p>
<p>&#8220;There are instances of Hindu rulers destroying temples in order to loot their wealth, such as Harshadeva of Kashmir, who defiled and looted temples and even had a special officer whose function was to seize the icons of tribal shine, and in Bodhgaya a Buddhist Vihara was destroyed by Sasanka in the 6th C to build a Hindu temple which still exists.&#8221; Sampradayikta Virodhi Andolan, Black Sunday. December 1992 p.2 as mentioned in Religion und Gewalt: Konflikte, Rituale, Deutungen (1500-1800), edited by Kaspar von Greyerz, Kim Siebenhüner, p.72, Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 2006</p>
<p>Harsha, a ruler of Kashmir (1089-1111AD), plundered all the temples in his own kingdom, barring four, in order to replenish his treasury, and not a word of protest was uttered. He destroyed both Hindu and Buddhist temples, and is credited with creating an office of &#8220;devotpaatana-nayaka&#8221;, destroyer of gods. Reference &#8221; Rajatarangini&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;The plunder of temples was carried out by kings irrespective of their religion. Temples were repositories of wealth. An ideological fig leaf was taken from religion to justify the desecration. Temples were plundered by the Marathas in Tipu&#8217;s Sultante. The Shirangapatanam temple was destroyed by the Maratha armies and was repaired by Tipu Sultan. Attacking the temple was also a way of Humiliting the other kings&#8230; Temples were also looted by ing Harsha of kashmir in the 11th century. A mention of this is found in Kalhan&#8217;s book Rajtarangini, which syas that he appointed a special officer to uproot the golden idols from the temples. This offiver was designated as devotpatan naya&#8217;s (officer who uproots the Gods). Parmar Kings (Shubharvarnman a.d 1193-1210) destroyed Jain temples in Cambay and Dabhoi in addition to plundering temples in his own kingdom.&#8221; Communal Politics: Fact versus Myth, p.52, By Ram Puniyani</p>
<p>&#8220;642 AD: Pallava king Narasimhavarman I looted the image of Ganesha from the Chalukyan capital of Vatapi (present day Badami in Belgaum dist.)</p>
<p>692 AD: Chalukyas invaded North India and brought back to the Deccan what would appear to be images of Ganga and Yamuna looted from defeated powers.</p>
<p>8th century AD: Bengali troops sought revenge on King Lalithaditya&#8217;s kingdom in Kashmir by destroying what they thought was an image of Vaikunta the state deity of Kashmir kingdom.</p>
<p>9th century AD: Rashtrakuta king Govinda III invaded and occupied Kanchipuram which so intimidated the King of Sri Lanka that he sent Govinda (probably Buddhist) images representing the Sinhala state.</p>
<p>Rashtrakuta king Indira III not only destroyed the temple of Kalapriya at Kalpa near the Jamuna river, patronized by their deadly enemies, the Pratiharas, but they took special delight in recording the fact.</p>
<p>9th century AD: Pandyan King Srimara Srivallabha also invaded Sri Lanka and took back to his capital golden Buddha image.</p>
<p>Early 10th century, Pratihara King, Hermabapala, seized solid gold image of Vishnu Vaikunta when he defeated the Sahi kings of Kangra (Himachal Pradesh)</p>
<p>Early 11th century: Chola King, Rajendra I furnished his capital with images he seized from several prominent neighbouring kings: Durga and Ganesha images from the Chalukyas, Bhairava, Bhairavi and Kali images from the Kalingas or Orissa as Nandi image from the Eastern Chalukyans.&#8221;<br />

<h2><a id="zoroastrianism"></a>Intolerance towards Zoroastrianism</h2>
<p>There is no direct reference made to Zoroastrianism in Hindu scriptures. But in the Vedas, the Asuras are depicted as villains, in Zoroastrian text Ahura is god and in the Vedas Asuras are demons. In Vedas, Devas are gods while in Zoroastrian text Daevas are demons. Zoroastrian text also speaks about the Aryan country. This suggests that Vedic religion and Zoroastrianism are approximate of the same age and there was a war between Aryans and Zoroastrians. Vedas speaks about killing the Asuras, and Zoroastrian texts also speak about killing Daevas by thousands. Zoroastrian text speaks of several Daevas but not all those Daevas are mentioned in Vedas. Daeva in Zoroastrianism may mean all evils and not just the Aryans. Only a few Devas (Vedic gods) like Mitra, Yama, Indra, etc., can be found in both Vedas and Zoroastrian texts, but these gods are viewed as heroes in the Zoroastrian text who sided with the Zoroastrians against Aryans. I won&#8217;t indulge further on this topic as it is related to the Aryan invasion/migration and a separate article would be appropriate to discus this.</p>
<p>As the proverb goes &#8216;History is written by the victors&#8217;. Learning about Asuras and Devas in Vedas would be one-sided we have to look at the other side also to get a better understanding of what really may have happened. Asuras are demonized and depicted like villains in the Vedas, but are the Devas depicted as heroes in Zoroastrian texts? Let&#8217;s have a look at some Zoroastrian verses,</p>
<p>Ushtavad Gatha, Yasna 44 verse 20 &#8220;I ask Thee, O Mazda, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">How it is possible for the Daevas to become kind severance, the persons who fight for their selfish ends and for satisfying their wishes. The have flung all earth to hatred and anger</span> with the help of Kavis, Karapans and Usikhsh (2). Would they ever strive to cause the advance and security of the world through Asha and bring about peace and love for all.&#8221; Tr. Mobed Firouz Azargoshasb</p>
<p>Ahunuvaita Gatha Yasna 30 Verse 6 &#8220;The followers of Daeva (or Devil worshippers) did not choose the right path, because they were in doubt and were deceived. Hence, they did not choose the right path but followed the worst thought, the devil or anger, which is the cause of all evil deeds, so as to destroy the mental life of the people.&#8221; Tr. Mobed Firouz Azargoshasb</p>
<p>Yasna 12.4 &#8220;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">I reject the authority of the Daevas, the wicked, no-good, lawless, evil-knowing, the most druj-like of beings, the foulest of beings, the most damaging of beings</span>. I reject the Daevas and their comrades, I reject the yatu and their comrades; <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">I reject any who harm beings</span>. I reject them with my thoughts, words, and deeds. I reject them publicly. Even as I reject the [evil authorities], so too do I reject the hostile followers of the druj.&#8221; Tr. J.H. Peterson</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Daevas were oppressors</span></strong></p>
<p>Frawardin Yasht 13.57 &#8220;We worship the good, strong, beneficent Fravashis of the faithful, who showed their paths to the stars, the moon, the sun, and the endless lights, that had stood before for a long time in the same place, without moving forwards, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">through the oppression of the Daevas and the assaults of the Daevas</span>.&#8221; Tr. James Darmesteter</p>
<p>Frawardin Yasht 13.130 &#8220;We worship the Fravashi of the holy Yima, the son of Vivanghant; the valiant Yima, who had flocks at his wish; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">to stand against the oppression caused by the Daevas</span>, against the drought that destroys pastures, and against death that creeps unseen.&#8221; Tr. James Darmesteter</p>
<p>Aban Yasht 5.58 &#8220;They begged of her a boon, saying: &#8220;Grant us this, O good, most beneficent Ardvi Sura Anahita! that we may overcome the valiant warrior Tusa, and that we may smite of the Aryan people their fifties and their hundreds, their hundreds and their thousands, their thousands and their tens of thousands, their tens of thousands and their myriads of myriads.&#8221; Tr. James Darmesteter</p>
<p>Warharan Yasht 14.60 &#8220;That I may be as constantly victorious as any one of all the Aryans; that I may smite this army, that I may smite down this army, that I may cut in pieces this army that is coming behind me.&#8221; Tr. James Darmesteter</p>

<h2><a id="dasyus"></a>Intolerance towards Dasyus</h2>
<p>When you read the Vedas you will find that there were other tribes also in the Vedic period who followed different religions and customs. And many times Aryans used to attack them mainly for the purpose of plundering them which is evident from the plunder and massacre of Kikata and Panis tribes which I have mentioned in <a href="https://vedkabhed.wordpress.com/2014/05/15/killing-infidels-in-vedas/" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Killing infidels in Vedas<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> article. Yaska Acharya defines Dasyu as,</p>
<p>Nirukta 7.23 Dasyu (demon) is derived from (the root) das, meaning to lay waste.</p>
<p>Swami Dayanand Saraswati defines Dasyu as wicked one. Veda says that the Dasyus followed a different religion, they did not sacrifice, and they are also called godless. Maybe they had atheistic philosophies like Buddhists. Veda explicitly commands the Aryans to kill and plunder Dasyus because of the difference in faith. I have used Hindi translations by Pandit Ram Govind Trivedi and Shri Ram Sharma Acharya,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.105.8 Grind off our sins: with song <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">will we conquer the men who sing no hymns</span>: Not easily art thou pleased with prayerless sacrifice.<br />

<p>Dasyus not offering oblation to Vedic gods, not sacrificing, being riteless, without worship and rituals are emphasized, the difference in faith is emphasized in the Vedas which means that one of the main reasons for killing Dasyus was their religion.</p>

<h2><a id="gods-murderers"></a>Hindu gods are murderers</h2>
<p>Hindu gods killed many innocent people. Hindu gods are said to have taken birth on earth in flesh and bone to guide people, a god was engaged in a lecherous activity, and another one was engaged in getting back his wife for over a decade. I really don&#8217;t know what message they left for humanity. Hindu gods are depicted wielding weapons with fierce facial expressions. Many times innocent blood was shed with those weapons. Here are some stories about Hindu gods killing innocent people, I will start with Vishnu and his avatars. Let&#8217;s have a look at the words of the demon,</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">VISHNU</span></strong></p>
<p>Matsya Purana 178.6-22 &#8221;He is my enemy. He is the destroyer of my elders, He lived in the oceans, destroyed the demons Madhu and Kaitabha. It can be said that as long as he lives, the war between us will not end. There will be a most fearful fight between Him and me. He has killed many demons in this battle. He is very cruel. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">He has not shown His clemency even to the children and the woman of the demons killed</span>. He is shameless. He is Visnu. He is the heaven of the Devas. He sleeps on the Sesa serpent&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, Edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>Demons in Hindu scriptures don&#8217;t necessarily mean beings with monstrous looks. Some non-Vedic tribes were considered demons in Hindu scriptures. We read here that Vishnu killed women and children of the enemy demons. Vishnu on being urged by Indra is said to have beheaded the wife of sage Bhrigu and Bhrigu cursed Vishnu to take incarnations on earth.</p>
<p>Valmiki Ramayana, Uttara Kanda, chapter 51. &#8220;Learn, O king, what happened formerly during the conflict between the Devas and Asuras. The Daityas, whom the Suras threatened, took refuge with the consort of Bhrigu and she, having given them a haven, they dwelt there in safety. Seeing them thus succoured, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">the Chief of the gods, enraged with his sharp-edged discus severed the head of Bhrigu&#8217;s wife</span>. Beholding the murder of his consort, Bhrigu, in his wrath, instantly cursed Vishnu, the destroyer of enemy hosts, saying:- &#8216;Since in thine insensate fury, thou has slain my spouse, who should never have died thus, thou shalt take birth in the world of men, O Janardana, and there thou shall live separated from thy consort for many years.&#8221; Tr. Hari Prasad Shastri</p>
<p>Matsya Purana Part I, 47.101-105 &#8220;At that, both Indra and Visnu were overcome with fear and began to contrive some means of escape. Visnu said to Indra:- &#8216;How shall we escape from her?&#8217; Indra replied:- &#8216;Lord! kill her before she consumed me. I am solely protected by you, destroy her soon without delay.&#8217; Visnu thought over the great sin of killing a woman, in spite of that, he took up his Sudarsana Chakra to free Himself from that impending calamity. Trembling with fear, on thinking over the consequences of her anger and being afraid of the consequences of His own wrath, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">He severed her head with His Chakra</span>. The sage Bhrigu then cursed Visnu for killing his wife.&#8221; Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>As per Brahmanda Purana 2.3.72.139-140 Vishnu pierced her head with his weapon and cut it into three parts. The context of this story is that. There was a battle between demons and Devas. Demons suffered a huge loss at the hands of the Devas and only a few demons survived so they wanted to take shelter and Shukra asked the Daityas to take refuge in his father&#8217;s house till he gets a boon from Shiva to defeat the Devas. So Daityas took shelter with the wife of sage Bhrigu who assured them safety. But Indra and Vishnu arrived there to kill Daityas but Shukra&#8217;s mother resisted the attack as she possessed powers and was going to burn up Indra and Vishnu so Indra asked Vishnu to kill her and Vishnu beheads her with his Sudarshan Chakra, Bhrigu arrived at the house and finds his wife killed by Vishnu and he curses Vishnu. As per Devi Bhagavatam Vishnu resurrects Bhrigu&#8217;s wife but as per Matsya Purana 1.47.108-111 Bhrigu resurrects his own wife. Vishnu and Indra could&#8217;ve fled from the spot or paralyzed her but they killed her. There&#8217;s a verse in Bhagavad Purana which says that Vishnu&#8217;s Sudarshan Chakra causes miscarriages of demons&#8217; wives,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 5.24.15 When the Sudarśana disc enters those provinces, the pregnant wives of the demons all have miscarriages due to fear of its effulgence.&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">VAMANA</span></strong></p>
<p>There was an Asura king named Mahabali who was a just and noble king. But to secure the kingship of Devas, Vamana avatar of Vishnu killed him and sent him to the lower world. This is mentioned in Srimad Bhagavatam Canto  8 chapters 18-20</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PARASHURAMA</span></strong></p>
<p>Parashurama was the sixth avatar of Vishnu. He is said to have beheaded his own mother Renuka as well as his brothers on the command of his father Jamadagni. Parashurama&#8217;s name in Mahabharata also appears as Rama, so do not confuse this Rama with Rama the killer of Ravana,</p>
<p>Mahabharata Vana Parva 3.116.13-14 &#8220;And then Rama, the slayer of hostile heroes, came to the hermitage, last of all. Him the mighty-armed Jamadagni, of great austerities, addressed, saying, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">&#8216;Kill this wicked mother of thine, without compunction, O my son.&#8217; Thereupon Rama immediately took up an axe and therewith severed his mother&#8217;s head</span>.&#8221; Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>The context of the story is that Renuka went to bathe and on her return, she happened to see King Chitraratha of Martikavata copulating with his wives, she was inspired with desire, and when she returned to the hermitage her husband Jamdagni came to know about it so he ordered his sons to kill her, they refused but Parshurama on the command of his father beheaded his mother. Jamadagni also told Parashurama to kill his brothers as they refused his command and Parashurama obeying his father&#8217;s command killed his brothers as well. But on Parashurama&#8217;s request to Jamadagni, his mother Renuka and brothers were brought back to life and Parashurama also requested that his mother and brothers shall not remember anything.</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 9.16.6 &#8220;Jamadagni then ordered his youngest son, Paraśurāma, to kill his brothers, who had disobeyed this order, and his mother, who had mentally committed adultery. Lord Paraśurāma, knowing the power of his father, who was practiced in meditation and austerity, killed his mother and brothers immediately.&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana 2.3.23.65 has an indirect reference to Parashurama&#8217;s killing of his own mother.</p>
<p>What was the sin of Renuka? That she was sexually aroused seeing the sexual intercourse of a king! Surely what she did was sinful but not so much that she deserved to be beheaded by her son the sixth incarnation of Vishnu. And Hindu god Parashurama also beheaded his mother without any hesitation.</p>
<p>Parashurama annihilated the entire Kshatriya race because his father was killed by Kartavirya Arjuna who belonged to the Kshatriya caste. He is said to have killed Kshatriyas twenty-one times,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 9.16.10 &#8220;Once when Paraśurāma left the āśrama for the forest with Vasumān and his other brothers, the sons of Kārtavīryārjuna took the opportunity to approach Jamadagni&#8217;s residence to seek vengeance for their grudge. The sons of Kārtavīryārjuna were determined to commit sinful deeds. Therefore when they saw Jamadagni sitting by the side of the fire to perform yajña and meditating upon the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is praised by the best of selected prayers, they took the opportunity to kill him. With pitiable prayers, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Reṇukā, the mother of Paraśurāma and wife of Jamadagni, begged for the life of her husband. But the sons of Kārtavīryārjuna, being devoid of the qualities of kṣatriyas, were so cruel that despite her prayers they forcibly cut off his head and took it away</span>.&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 9.16.16 Thus lamenting, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Lord Paraśurāma entrusted his father&#8217;s dead body to his brothers and personally took up his axe, having decided to put an end to all the kṣatriyas on the surface of the world</span>. [18-19] With the blood of the bodies of these sons, Lord Paraśurāma created a ghastly river, which brought great fear to the kings who had no respect for brahminical culture. Because the kṣatriyas, the men of power in government, were performing sinful activities, Lord Paraśurāma, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">on the plea of retaliating for the murder of his father, rid all the kṣatriyas from the face of the earth twenty-one times</span>. Indeed, in the place known as Samanta-pañcaka he created nine lakes filled with their blood.&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Brahma Purana 104.110-111 &#8220;The Earth where crores of Ksatriyas remained scattered about, the Earth that is adorned by the mountains Meru and Mandara was rid of Ksatriyas twentyone times by the lord. After making the Earth devoid of Ksatriyas, Parasurama of great fame performed a horse sacrifice in order to dispel his sins.&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Mahabharata Adi Parva 1.2.1-7 &#8220;The Rishis said, &#8216;O son of Suta, we wish to hear a full and circumstantial account of the place mentioned by you as Samanta-panchaya.'&#8221;Sauti said, &#8216;Listen, O ye Brahmanas, to the sacred descriptions I utter O ye best of men, ye deserve to hear of the place known as Samanta-panchaka. In the interval between the Treta and Dwapara Yugas, Rama (the son of Jamadagni) great among all who have borne arms, urged by impatience of wrongs, repeatedly smote the noble race of Kshatriyas. And when that fiery meteor, by his own valour, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">annihilated the entire tribe of the Kshatriyas, he formed at Samanta-panchaka five lakes of blood</span>. We are told that his reason being overpowered by anger he offered oblations of blood to the manes of his ancestors, standing in the midst of the sanguine waters of those lakes. It was then that his forefathers of whom Richika was the first having arrived there addressed him thus, &#8216;O Rama, O blessed Rama, O offspring of Bhrigu, we have been gratified with the reverence thou hast shown for thy ancestors and with thy valour …&#8221; Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Parashurama burned up the entire city along with the inhabitants</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana 2.3.46.20-26 &#8220;A battle took place once again between Rama and the kings, wherein the infuriated sage of high intellect, killed a hundred kings. After killing Surasena and others along with their armies and vehicles, he made the entire group of Ksatriyas fall on the ground in a moment. The kings who survived, whose wishes had been frustrated and whose vehicles and armies has been killed fled in all directions. After routing the armies, killing the enemies and winning the battle, Rama killed hundreds of kings and heroes by means of the fire from his excellent arrows. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Overwhelmed with fury and desirous of burning the entire city</span>, Bhargava discharged a missile that had a lustre similar to that of Kalagni (the fire of world-destruction). <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The fire from that missile burned the city along with elephants, horses and men</span>. The flames enveloped the clusters of the entire rampart-wall of the city.  On seeing the city being burned and desirous of saving his own life, Prince Virihotra became frightened and fled quickly for the sake of life.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>How is it possible that all the Kshatriyas in the world were engaged in sinful activities? As I said earlier, everything Hindu gods didn&#8217;t like is demonized in Hindu scriptures. Parashurama killed all Kshatriyas to avenge his father&#8217;s murder by a few Kshatriya.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">KRISHNA</span></strong></p>
<p>Krishna beheaded a washerman just because he refused to give him clothes and spoke rudely,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 10.41.36-37 &#8220;Fools, get out of here quickly! Don&#8217;t beg like this if You want to stay alive. When someone is too bold, the King&#8217;s men arrest him and kill him and take all his property. As the washerman thus spoke brazenly, the son of Devaki became angry, and <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">then merely with His fingertips He separated the man&#8217;s head from his body</span>.&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The slaughter of </span><span style="color: #000000;">the </span><span style="color: #000000;">washerman is summarized in Bravaivarta Purana, Krishna Janma Khanda 132.62-75 and also mentioned in Agni Purana 12.23. Krishna and Balrama visited the city Mathura. And a washerman was passing by so they asked him</span><span style="color: #000000;"> to give them</span><span style="color: #000000;"> some clothes that belonged to the King. From the words of the washerman</span><span style="color: #000000;">,</span><span style="color: #000000;"> it appears that he thought Krishna and Balram</span><span style="color: #000000;">a to be wanderers. So he plainly</span><span style="color: #000000;"> refused </span><span style="color: #000000;">to give clothes. This story sounds</span><span style="color: #000000;"> same </span><span style="color: #000000;">as</span><span style="color: #000000;"> the crimes we read where thieves kill people to take their possessions. After beheading the washerman Krishna and Balrama took the clothes.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Krishna couldn&#8217;t bear criticism. He beheaded King Shishupala just because he abused him. Pandavas were performing sacrifice at Indraprastha where Shishupala was also present and he was beheaded there.</span></p>
<p>Padma Purana VI.252.13-20 &#8220;All those, protected by Krsna, having saluted and praised Krsna, went to their respective countries. Then, going to Indraprastha with the two (i.e. Bhima and Arjuna), Krsna made Yudhisthira perform the Rajasuya sacrifice. There, after the sacrifice was over, the chief honour was given to Krsna with the consent of Bhisma. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">There </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Sisupala spoke many abusive words to Krsna. Krsna too cut off his head with the Sudarsana (disc)</span>&#8230;&#8221; Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 10.74.39-44 &#8220;Upon hearing such intolerable blasphemy of the Lord, several members of the assembly covered their ears and walked out, angrily cursing the King of Cedi. Anyone who fails to immediately leave the place where he hears criticism of the Supreme Lord or His faithful devotee will certainly fall down, bereft of his pious credit. Then the sons of Pāṇḍu became furious, and together with the warriors of the Matsya, Kaikaya and Sṛñjaya clans, they rose up from their seats with weapons poised, ready to kill Śiśupāla. Undaunted, Śiśupāla then took up his sword and shield in the midst of all the assembled kings, O Bhārata, and hurled insults at those who sided with Lord Kṛṣṇa. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">At that point the Supreme Lord stood up and checked His devotees. He then angrily sent forth His razor-sharp disc and severed the head of His enemy</span> as he was attacking. When Śiśupāla was thus killed, a great roar and howl went up from the crowd. Taking advantage of that disturbance, the few kings who were supporters of Śiśupāla quickly left the assembly out of fear for their lives.&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>As you may know that Krishna was killed accidentally by a hunter named Jara. Although Jara murdered Krishna and can&#8217;t be called innocent but this contradicts modern Hindus&#8217; statement that Krishna was very merciful. Even after begging for mercy Krishna took revenge and killed Jara but awarded him entry to heaven,</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 5.37.60-69 “Respecting the words of the Brahman, the imprecation of Durvásas, the illustrious Krishńa sat engaged in thought, resting his foot upon his knee. Then came there a hunter, named Jará, whose arrow was tipped with a blade made of the piece of iron of the club, which had not been reduced to powder; and beholding from a distance the foot of Krishńa, he mistook it for part of a deer, and shooting his arrow, lodged it in the sole. Approaching his mark, he saw the four-armed king, and, falling at his feet, repeatedly besought his forgiveness, exclaiming, “I have done this deed unwittingly, thinking I was aiming at a deer! Have pity upon me, who am consumed by my crime; for thou art able to consume me!” Bhagavat replied, “Fear not thou in the least. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Go, hunter, through my favour, to heaven, the abode of the gods.” As soon as he had thus spoken, a celestial car appeared, and the hunter, ascending it, forthwith proceeded to heaven</span>.” Tr.

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-size: 12pt;">Balrama</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Balarama is sometime</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">s</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> conside</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">red an avatar of Vishnu. As per </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Hindu text</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">s</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">, Balarama was addicted to gambling. Balarama is said to have played dice with Rukmi the brother</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">-in-</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">law of Krishna. It is said that Rukmi wanted to avenge the elopement of his sister Rukmini by Krishna so he challenged Balarama the brother of Krishna in the game of dice who accepted it without hesitation though he wasn’t an expert at it. Balarama lost many bets to Rukmi but won the final bet which was very big. Then an argument ensued between Rukmi and </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Balarama that Balarama had cheated him (Rukmi) and that Rukmi is the real winner. Balarama couldn’t tolerate this so he killed Rukmi for such </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">a </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">petty argument,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Vishnu Purana 5.23</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">.10-28</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> “After the wedding had been solemnized, several of the kings, headed by him of Kalinga, said to Rukmin, “This wielder of the ploughshare is ignorant of the dice, which may be converted into his misfortune: why may we not contend with him, and beat him, in play?” The potent Rukmin replied to them, and said, “So let it be:” and he engaged Balaráma at a game of dice in the palace. Balaráma soon lost to Rukmin a thousand Nishkas: he then staked and lost another thousand; and then pledged ten thousand, which Rukmin, who was well skilled in gambling, also won. At this the king of Kalinga laughed aloud, and the weak and exulting Rukmin grinned, and said, “Baladeva is losing, for he knows nothing of the game; although, blinded by a vain passion for play, he thinks he understands the dice.” Halayudha, galled by the broad laughter of the Kalinga prince, and the contemptuous speech of Rukmin, was exceedingly angry, and, overcome with passion, increased his stake to ten millions of Nishkas. Rukmin accepted the challenge, and therefore threw the dice. Baladeva won, and cried aloud, “The stake is mine.” But Rukmin called out as loudly, that he was the winner. “Tell no lies, Bala,” said he: “the stake is yours; that is true; but I did not agree to it: although this be won by you, yet still I am the winner.” A deep voice was then heard in the sky, inflaming still more the anger of the high-spirited Baladeva, saying, “Bala has rightly won the whole sum, and Rukmin speaks falsely: although he did not accept the pledge in words, he did so by his acts (having cast the dice).” </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000; font-size: 12pt;">Balaráma thus excited, his eyes red with rage, started up, and struck Rukmin with the board on which the game was played, and killed him</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">… When Krishńa heard that Rukmin had been killed by his brother, he made no remark, being afraid of Rukminí on the one hand, and of Bala on the other…”</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> Tr.

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">RAMA</span></strong></p>
<p>Rama beheaded a Shudra named Shambuka because that Shudra was practicing penance that may have included chanting some Vedic Mantras.</p>
<p>Ramayana of Valmiki, Uttara Kanda 7, Chapters 75-76 &#8221;On this that Prince born of Raghu approached the one who had given himself up to rigorous practices and said:- &#8221;Blessed art thou, O Ascetic, who art faithful to thy vows! <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">From what caste art thou sprung</span>, O Thou who hast grown old in mortification and who art established in heroism. I am interested in this matter, I Rama, the son of Dasaratha. What purpose hast thou in view? Is it heaven or some other object? What boon dost thou seek by means of this hard penance? I wish to know what thou desirest in performing these austerities, O Ascetic. May prosperity attend thee! <span style="color: #ff0000;">Art thou a brahmin? Art thou an invincible Kshatriya? Art thou a Vaishya, one of the third caste or art thou a Shudra</span>? Answer me truthfully!&#8221;&#8230;Hearing the words of Rama of imperishable exploits, that ascetic, his head still hanging downwards, answered:- <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">&#8221;O Rama, I was born of a Shudra alliance and I am performing this rigorous penance in order to acquire the status of a God in this body</span>. I am not telling a lie, O Rama, I wish to attain the Celestial Region. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Know that I am a Shudra and my name is Shambuka</span>.&#8221; <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">As he was yet speaking, Raghava, drawing his brilliant and stainless sword from its scabbard, cut off his head</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Shudra being slain</span>, all the Gods and their leaders with Agni&#8217;s followers, cried out, &#8221;Well done! Well done!&#8221; overwhelming Rama with praise, and a rain of celestial flowers of divine fragrance fell on all sides, scattered by Vayu.&#8221; Tr. Hari Prasad Shastri</p>
<p>Ramayana of Valmiki, Uttara Kanda 7, Chapters 75-76 &#8220;O Kakutstha be happy! This very day that child has received new life and has been restored to his parents. The child was resuscited at the instant that the head of the Shudra fell.&#8221; Tr. Hari Prasad Shastri</p>
<p>A Brahmin boy died in Ram&#8217;s kingdom so Rama went out to find the cause of this death signifying that there must be some unrighteous thing going on that led to the death of this boy. So Rama found Shambuka who was hanging upside down from a tree performing vigorous penance. Ram asked his caste and reason for his penance and beheaded him. Some apologists say that Rama beheaded Shambuka because Shambuka was performing penance to acquire a boon for an evil purpose. If Shambuka was slain for that then why wasn&#8217;t Ravana beheaded too? Is that because Ravana was a Brahmin and Shambuka was a Shuda? Shambuka in this passage clearly said that he is performing penance to acquire the status of God in his body. He wasn&#8217;t performing it with some evil intention. If he was lying and Rama already knew his intention then why did he first enquired and then beheaded him? Why didn&#8217;t he just go there and behead him? Rama asked Shambuka&#8217;s caste, Shambuka reiterated that he is a Shudra. Shudra caste is emphasized here which means that Rama beheaded him because a Shudra should not perform such penance.</p>
<p>Lakshmana on the command of Rama is said to have cut off the nose and ears of Ravana&#8217;s sister Shurpanakha who had approached Rama expressing her love for him.</p>
<p>Valmiki Ramayana, Aranya Kanda 3.18.20-21 &#8220;She is freakish, knavish and overtly ruttish, oh, tigerly man, it will be apt of you to deface this paunchy demoness&#8221; Thus Rama said to Lakshmana. Thus said to that mighty Lakshmana he infuriately drew sword and chopped off her ears and nose before the very eyes of Rama.&#8221; Tr. Desi Raju Hanumanth Rao</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 10.47.17 &#8221;He is so very wily that in his incarnation as Rama, he had killed the king of monkeys, (Vali) like a hunter. Also, being brought under the control of his wife he cut off the nose of a woman Shurpanakha by name, who had come to him being stricken with amorous desire.&#8221; Tr. J.M. Sanyal</p>
<p>Also mentioned in Agni Purana 7.5</p>
<p>In the next life, Shurpanakha is incarnated as Kubja the hunchback woman and Rama as Krishna and these two had an illicit relationship which I have mentioned in <a href="https://vedkabhed.wordpress.com/2014/12/27/hinduism-and-lust/" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Hinduism and Lust<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> article.</p>
<p>Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Krishna Janma Khanda 115.93-102 &#8220;Kubja, in her previous birth, was the sister of the wicked Ravana. Her name was Surpanakha. Actuated by lust, she desired the society of Rama. Lakshamana, the chief of the pious men, cut off her nose&#8230;.&#8221; Tr. Various Sanskrit Scholars, Edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>It is said that Shurpanakha was going to kill Sita. There is another version that says that when Shurpanakha approached Rama, he asked her to go to Lakshman and then Lakshman cut off her nose and ears. But the story in Ramayana seems more authentic. Lakshman cutting off the nose and ears of Ravan&#8217;s sister is what provoked Ravana to revenge. It&#8217;s quite funny that Ravana is demonized despite being a Brahmin and Shiva&#8217;s ardent devotee just because he abducted Ram&#8217;s wife Sita. But Hindu gods raping and abducting women doesn&#8217;t make them villains. I say Shurpanakha was lucky enough to have only her ears and nose cut off. There is a story of another woman being deformed by Lakshmana who approached Lakshamana to express her love,</p>
<p>Valmiki Ramayana Aranya Kanda 3.69.15-17 &#8220;Closeting Soumitri in her embrace she told him this sentence, &#8220;I am Ayomukhi, by my name&#8230; you won me by your heroic personality, by that way, none can win me over&#8230; thus, you alone are my lover&#8230; oh, hero, oh, my husband&#8230; you will romance with me on mountaintops, in rivers, and on sandy isles, till the end of this life&#8230;&#8221; So is the love prattle of that demoness Ayomukhi. When said that way that enemy-suppressor <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Lakshmana became furious, and upraising his sword he sheared off her nose, one ear, and one of her breasts</span>.&#8221; Tr. Desi Raju Hanumanth Rao</p>
<p>Now some people may say that this is the same story with variations in names. The name of the woman here is Ayomukhi whereas in the same Valmiki Ramayana Surpanakha appears to be the name of Ravana&#8217;s sister. So the same variation cannot occur in the same text. Shurpanakha expressed her love for Rama while Ayomukhi expressed her love for Lakshmana, also there is no mention of cutting up Shurpanakha&#8217;s breast but this story does. Most important of all, the mutilation of Ayomukhi occurred after Sita was abducted while Shurpanakha&#8217;s mutilation happened before Ravana abducted Sita. Poor lady Ayomukhi&#8217;s ears, nose and breast were cut off by the cruel Lakshman just because she expressed her love.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">HANUMAN</span></strong></p>
<p>In the Valmiki Ramayana Hanuman is said to have burnt up Lanka along with its inhabitants. The word demon is used to describe the people of Lanka. As you may know, Non-Hindus were considered demons, just go to Sri Lanka and let’s see whether you find humans or demons there. The verses also show that the Lankans amassed great wealth,</p>
<p>Valmiki Ramayana Sundara Khanda 5, Sarga 54, Verses 24- “The demons, who were running hither and thither to protect their houses and who lost their spirits and abundant wealth, created a tumultuous nose, saying &#8220;Alas! The fire-god has come really in a form of this monkey! <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Some women crying and carrying their suckling&#8217;s</span> with their hair dishevelled, fell down from their houses, which were enveloped with fire, and shone like flashes of lightning falling from clouds in the sky. As the fire does not get satisfied with any amount of firewood and straw fed to it, Hanuma was not wearied in killing any number of demons. The earth was not then wearied in receiving the number of demons killed by Hanuma (in her lap).” Tr. K.M.K. Murthy</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">KALKI</span></strong></p>
<p>According to Hindu texts, Kalki avatar kills Shudra kings, Buddhists and heretics, he also plunders them,</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.58.76-83 &#8220;He will be called Pramiti. He was born of a part of Visnu formerly in the Svayambhuva Manvantara. He wandered over the earth for full twenty years. He led an army consisting of cavalry, chariots and elephants. He was surrounded by hundreds and thousands of Brahmanas armed with weapons. He killed Mlecchas in thousands. He went everywhere. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">After killing the kings born of Sudra women, he exterminated the heretics</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">He killed thousands of persons who were not religious and righteous. He killed those born of mixed castes as well as those who depended on them</span>. He killed the Udicyas (northerners), Madya Desyas (people of the Middle Land), mountain-dwellers, easterners, westerners, dwellers in Vindhya and Aparanta. He killed the southerners, Dravidas, Simhalas, Gandharas, Paradas, Pahlavas, Yavanas, Tusaras, Barbaras, Cinas, Sulikas, Daradas, Khasas, Lampakas, Ketas, and the different tribes of Kratas.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare, edited by G.P. Bhatt</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana 1.2.31.88-90 &#8220;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Annihilating every thing by his ruthless activity, he made only seeds to remain on the earth</span>. He managed to subdue the Vrsala who were generally sinful, by making them angry with one another on sudden provocations. Thereafter, in the region between the Ganga and the Yamuna, he established his camp of rest along with his followers. Thereafter, when the Kalpa elapsed, he went back to his eternal abode along with his army after exterminating Mleccha kings by thousands.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 144.51-59 &#8220;King Pramati of the Bhrigu family and Chandramasa gotra was born at the end of Svayambhuva Manu in the Sandhyamsa period, to inflict proper punishment on the sinners. That king travelled all over the earth for 30 years and collected arms and ammunitions, elephants, horses and chariots and marched with a vast army consisting of horses and elephants and accompanied by 100,00 Brahmana soldiers armed with various kinds of weapons, against the Mlecchas and destroyed them. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">After killing all the Sudra kings he annihilated all the hypocrites</span>. After destroying all the sinners and subduing the people living in the North, central regions, the mountaineers, the inhabitants in the East and West, the residents on the Vindhyas, the Deccanis, the Dravidians, the Singhalese, the inhabitants of the Mleccha countries (Kabul and Kandhara), the Paradas, the Pahlavas, the Yavanas, the Sakas, the Tusaras, the Svetas, the Pulindas, the Barbaras, the Khasas, the Lampakas, the Andhrakas, the Daradas, the Ifalikas, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">he exterminated the Sudras</span>. King Pramati was born of Visnu&#8217;s part in Manu&#8217;s family and was famous as Chandramasa.&#8221; Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>This is also mentioned in Brahmanda Purana 1.2.31.77-80 and Vayu Purana I.58.76-83 which I have mentioned in <a href="#intolerance-within-Hinduism" class="broken_link">Intolerance within caste and sects</a> category and it is also mentioned in Linga Purana Section I.40.50-56. It would have been comprehensible if the verse said that Kalki (Pramati) killed the sinners and wrongdoers but killing people born of mixed castes, and kings born to Shudra mothers is casteist. And saying that all people living in the north, south, east and west are all wrong doesn&#8217;t make any sense either, some of the tribes mentioned are traceable.</p>
<p>Kalki avatar annihilating humans and subduing low castes,</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana 2.3.73.111-116 &#8220;The lord Visnu who had been born in the previous birth as a powerful one, Pramiti by name, will be born in the Gotra of Candramas when the Kaliyuga is complete. Thus these ten incarnations of the lord are remembered. he accepts different wombs in the three worlds partially, adopting at different periods of time, different physical bodies, and different purposes for the manifestations. He will be born in the twenty-fifth Kalpa. For twenty-five years he will be exterminating the living beings and all human beings (?). With this cruel act, he will render the Earth left with only the seeds. He will subdue Vrsalas (low caste people) and almost those evil-doers. Thereafter, Kalki will become contented along with his army. Those who are not killed in this action, those who achieve something, will become deluded suddenly and fight with one another.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Do read Kalki Purana 13.39-44 and Kalki Purana 16.1 which I have already mentioned in this article in <a href="#kalki-buddhists" class="broken_link">Kalki avatar a murderer of Buddhists</a> category. Let me once against quote them for you,</p>
<p>Sri Kalki Purana 16.1 &#8220;Suta Gosvami said. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">After killing the Buddhists and mlecchas of Kikatapura, Lord Kalki took their wealth</span> and returned to His capital, along with His vast army&#8221; Tr. Bhumipati Das edited by Purnaprajna Das</p>
<p>Sri Kalki Purana 13.39-44 &#8220;Lord Kalki appeared to flourish, being surrounded by all these family members. Once, Lord Kalki&#8217;s father, Visnuyasa, who was on the level of Lord Brahma, decided to perform a horse sacrifice. Understanding the intention of His father, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Lord Kalki said: My dear father, I will go out and defeat all other kings in battle and thus bring you sufficient wealth</span> so that you can conduct the horse sacrifice properly. Lord Kalki, who was certainly capable of conquering all other kings, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">offered His obeisances to his father and then set out with his army to first conquer Kikatapura</span>…&#8221; Tr. Bhumipati Das edited by Purnaprajna Das</p>
<p>It proves that his primary aim was to plunder people. If you are conversant with Indian history you might be knowing that Kikata is present-day Bihar. And Bihar was once dominated by Buddhists, some historians even say that Bihar is the corrupted word for Vihar which means a Buddhist temple or monastery. Buddhism might have been the prevalent religion in Kikata (Bihar) when Kalki Purana was written so the composer wrote all these fairy tales keeping that in mind or else they may have written it based on the prediction of Kali Yuga in Hindu scriptures which says that people will become heretics (Jains, Buddhists). Also, these verses of plundering Kikata may have been inspired by the Vedic verses in which Vedic gods plunders Kikata tribe just because they didn&#8217;t offer any oblation to them.

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: initial; font-size: 12pt;">SHIVA</span></strong></p>
<p>Shiva burned up Tripura (Three cities) along with women and children. Tripura was a city inhabited by Asuras. Shiva with the help of other gods like Agni, Vishnu, Ashvinkumar, Yama, Kala, Ghandarvas, Brahma burned the city as well as its inhabitants. It&#8217;s not objectionable if Devas had killed combatant Asuras but they killed non-combatant Asuras along with their children and women. Your heart may tremble reading the following verses,</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 188.1 &#8220;Marakandeya said:- Hear from me, Yudhisthira! what you have asked me to explain. The spot on the banks of the Narmada where the Lord is enshrined is renowned as Mahesvara in all the three worlds and at the very same place He devised His plans of annihilating Tripura. [6-15] &#8230;In that way, Siva waited for thousands of years after making such preparations. When the three Puras (cities) fell in one line the Lord let out His arrow on Tripura when the inmates of Tripura became helpless and many kind of destructive omens occurred there&#8230;Then the wind Sambartaka that blows at the close of a cycle commenced&#8230;It produced fire on account of which the trees of Tripura began to crumble down. There was chaos everywhere. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">All the gardens were burnt down in an instant</span>&#8230;[25-40] <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The pleasure gardens smiling with lotus beds were also burnt down along with the swans and cranes</span>&#8230;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The fire of the Lord&#8217;s fury burnt down quite unsparingly several children, cows, birds, horses, women, and many people sleeping as well as awake</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The nymph like beauties of Tripura fell down burnt with their young ones hugged to their breasts.</span> Some ladies wearing garlands of pearl and gold fell down on the ground consumed by flames and suffocated by smoke. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Some beauties seeing their Lord lying on the ground jumped down from the upper storey of their mansion and were instantly eaten up by the flames</span>&#8230;Some ladies of the cloudy hue wearing garlands and armlets, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">some fair-complexioned beauties giving milk to their dear little ones were also consumed by fire</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Some ladies seeing their children eaten up by the fire sent forth shrilling wails</span>. Some ladies wearing diamond and emerald necklaces and shining like the moon <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">with their children in their lap, fell down on the ground after being charred</span>. Some moon faced beauties waking up from their sleep found their mansion on fire and began to <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">lament on realizing their children being burnt</span>. Some ladies adorned with golden ornaments fell down on the ground holding their consumed children in their arms&#8230; [41-48] Some overcome by the fury of the fire with their hands folded and uplifted began to pray as follows:- <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">&#8216;Agni! if thou art angry with the male population hostile to thee; what is the fault of the women confined in the houses like so many domesticated Kokilas pent up in cages</span>&#8230;[51-53]&#8230;Hearing such speech of the ladies the Agni said &#8216;I am not consuming you of my own will. I have been born to cause destruction. I have no mercy. I make my way everywhere freely through the glory of Siva&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Rudrasamhita 2, Yuddha Khanda 5.10.35 &#8220;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Other Asuraas too, children and old men were completely burnt out</span>, O Vyasa, at the bidding of Siva and speedily reduced to ashes. Just as the universe is burnt at the end of a Kalpa so also every thing and everyone there, whether woman or man or vehicles, was reduced to ashes by that fire.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Only those who worshipped Shiva and Ganesh were not burnt and all those who opposed God and whose activities were destructive (read not worshipping Shiva) were burnt including children, women and old people.</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 140.59-69 &#8220;The women folk in the amorous embraces of their lords in their residences and pleasure groves, were also reduced to ashes. No women could go away elsewhere. They were also consumed by fire in the company of their lords. Some of them cried out with folded hands and with tears in their eyes &#8216;O Agni! I am the wife of another; O Thou, the holy witness of all the things in the three worlds! You ought not to touch me. O Deva! my husband and myself are asleep; <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">I have not done any thing vicious and sinful</span>; therefore, go away by another path leaving my home with my beloved. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">One woman holding her infant stood, facing the fire and said &#8216;Agni! I have obtained this infant after great privations and it does not behove thee to burn this darling of mine</span></strong>&#8216;. Some of the women folk threw themselves into the waters of the ocean after forsaking their husbands. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Many of the women shivered under the destructive influence of fire and exclaimed with bewildering excitement, &#8216;O, father! O, husband! O, mother! O, maternal uncle! etc</span>. &#8216;As the heat emanating from the houses withers the lotuses springing in the ponds thereof, so consumed the fire at Tripura the lotus-like faces of those women along with their bodies&#8230;There was a great uproar when the women flew with their jingling ornaments and cried out in great consternation, on account of the fire produced form the destructive arrow of Siva.&#8221; Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>Other verses show that Devas were engaged in annihilating all of the Asuras, verses from Matsya Purana prove that, non-combatant Asuras including children, women and old people were also burned to death,</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 148.1-7 &#8220;Tarakasura said:- &#8216;Hearken, O, valiant Asuras! every one should direct his intelligence to his well being. Danavas! <span style="text-decoration: underline;">all the Devas are the annihilators of our race</span>. They are our ancient enemies. Our family religion is, therefore to establish firmly our eternal enmity with them. Today we shall certainly make a move to check the advance of the Devas and conquer them by the strength of our arms. But I do not consider it proper to fight with the Devas without practising austerities, I shall, therefore, first practise severe austerities; then we will conquer the Devas and enjoy the three worlds&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>The following verses describe the Tripura city,</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 140.53-57 &#8220;The arrow burnt the three cities as fire burns heaps of straw&#8230;The Tripura fort looked then like a good family brought to ruin by a wicked son. Afterwards, the houses of Tripura looking like the peaks of Sumera, Mandarachala and Kailasa, the beautiful places with gateways and perforated works and balconies, the pleasure rendezvous full of lovely ponds, the abodes of demons decorated with banners, buntings and wreaths of gold were eaten up by the thousand tongue fire.&#8221; Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>From the above verses as well as verses from Matsya Purana 188.1 we get to know that the Asuras were much more civilized than the Devas, the city of the enemies is described in such a beautiful manner. It shows the civilization of the Asuras who had lofty buildings, lovely palaces beautifully decorated with wreaths of gold, gardens with beautiful ponds, Asura women wearing necklaces of diamonds and gold, etc. After reading these things do you really think they were demons? A woman in this verse clearly says, &#8220;&#8216;Agni! if thou art angry with the male population hostile to thee; what is the fault of the women confined in the houses like so many domesticated Kokilas pent up in cages&#8221; But this didn&#8217;t stop cruel Agni from consuming them.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">INDRA</span></strong></p>
<p>Indra doesn&#8217;t deserve to be called a God. Even the most lecherous person&#8217;s actions on earth cannot be compared to the evils done by Indra. Indra lusted after other&#8217;s wives, raped women, committed adultery, consumed alcoholic drinks and even killed innocent people. Indra entered the womb of Diti and cut off the fetus into nine parts to kill the baby,</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Shiva Purana, Rudra Samhita 2, Parvati K</span><span style="color: #000000;">handa 3, Ch 14, verses </span><span style="color: #000000;">8-14 &#8221;My son Marici begot Kasyapa who married thirteen daughters of Daksa. The eldest of them Diti bore two sons: Hiranyakasipu the elder and Hiranyaksa the younger. When these two began to harass the gods, Visnu assumed the forms of Man lion and Boar and killed them. Then gods became fearless and happy. The distressed Diti sought refuge in Kasyapa and serving him with devotion and observing the sacred rites she conceived. On coming to know of it, </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Indra entered her womb forcibly and cut it off many a time with his thunderbolt</span><span style="color: #000000;">. By the power of her sacred rites, the child in the womb did not die as she was sleeping at that time, by a stroke of good luck. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">They were cut into seven pieces and so she had seven sons. These sons became gods by the name of Maruts</span><span style="color: #000000;">.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">This is also mentioned in Vayu Purana 6.102-3; Agni Purana 19.19-20; Valmiki Ramayana Bala Kandam 1.46 and as per Brahmanda Purana 2.3.5.68 Indra entered the belly through the vaginal passage. I am posting the summary of this story by Desi Raju Hanumanth Rao so you can understand the context,</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Diti seeks for a son to kill Indra because Indra and other gods have killed her sons in the battle after churning Milk Ocean. But Indra, being her stepson arrives at her place of asceticism, with view to destroy that Indra-killer. On a fateful day when Diti failed to maintain the procedure of vow, Indra enters her womb and dissects the foetus into seven fragments, which later become sapta marut gaNa-s, The Seven Wind-gods.&#8221;</p>
<p>Indra killed a Muni Trisira/Vishwarupa who was meditating,</p>
<p>Srimad Devi Bhagavatam 6.2.1-11. &#8220;Vyâsa said:- The extremely covetous Indra, then, mounted on his Airâvata elephant and determined to kill the Muni. He went to him and saw him immersed in deep Samâdhi, firmly seated in his posture and with his speech controlled. At that time, a halo of light emanated from his body and he looked like a second Sun and a blazing fire. Indra became very sad and dejected when he saw that. Indra then thought within himself thus :&#8211; &#8220;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Oh! Can I slay this Muni, free from any vicious inclinations, and endowed with the power of Tapas, blazing like a fire</span>! This is quite against the Dharma. But, Alas! He wants to usurp my position; how can I, then, neglect such an enemy?&#8221; Thus cogitating, Indra hurled at the Muni his swift going, infallible thunderbolt, the Muni remaining engaged in his penance and shining like the Sun and Moon. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The ascetic, struck </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">thus, fell on the ground and died</span>, like a mountain peak struck by thunder falling on the ground and presenting a wondrous sight. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Indra became very glad when he killed the Muni</span>…&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Also mentioned in Mahabharata Udyog Parva 5, section 9; Satapatha Brahmana 1.6.3.1-2. Muni Trisira/Vishwarupa had three heads for which he was called Trisira. He dedicated one head to the recitation of Vedas, one head for eating and one for observing the surroundings. Indra was afraid that Muni Trisira/Vishwarupa may replace Indra from his Indraship due to the rigid penance. So at first, he sent several Apsaras like Urvashi, Menaka, Rambha, Ghritachi and Tilottama who tried to interrupt Muni Trisira&#8217;s penance by singing and dancing in front of him and even seducing him but in vain. So at last Indra decided to kill him. But even after killing Muni Trisira with a thunderbolt, Indra thought that Trisira was alive so he asked a woodcutter named Taksa to cut off the heads of the Muni with his axe,</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Srimad </span><span style="color: #000000;">Devi Bhagavatam 6.2.1-14. &#8220;…Indra, then, went back soon to his own abode; on the other hand, the high-souled Muni, though killed, looked as it were, living by the lustre of his own body. </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Indra, then, seeing him lying like a living man thought that the Muni might get alive and so became very sad</span><span style="color: #000000;">. While he was thus arguing in his mind, he saw before him a wood cutter named Taksa and began to speak to him for his own selfish ends thus &#8220;</span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">O Artisan! Cut all the heads of this Muni and keep my word; this highly lustrous Muni is looking as it were alive; therefore, if you sever his heads</span><span style="color: #000000;">, he cannot be alive.&#8221; Taksa then cursed him and spoke thus. &#8220;O King of the Devas! The neck of this Muni is very big and therefore cannot be severed; my axe is not at all fit for this work. Specially I cannot do such a blameable act. You have done a very heinous crime, quite against the law of the good persons; I fear sin; I will not be able to cut the heads of a dead man. This Muni is lying dead; what use is there in severing his head again? O Pâkas&#8217;âsana! The killer of the demon Pâka! Why do you fear in this?&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The woodcutter was first reluctant but Indra convinced him and lured him with a share in </span><span style="color: #000000;">the </span><span style="color: #000000;">sacrifice and then the woodcutter cut off three heads of Trisira,</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Srimad </span><span style="color: #000000;">Devi Bhagavatam 6.2.21 &#8220;</span>Vyâsa said:&#8211; O King! That Tak<span style="text-decoration: underline;">s</span>â became very glad when he heard thus from Indra and struck off the heads of the Muni with his very strong axe.&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">So Vishwakarma the father of Trisira created a son Vritra to avenge the death of his son,</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Srimad </span><span style="color: #000000;">Devi Bhagavatam 6.2.21-53 &#8220;When Vis&#8217;vakarmâ heard that his virtuous son had been killed, he became very angry (in his mind) and </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">said that as Indra had killed his qualified son engaged in asceticism without any offence, he would create another son to kill Indra.</span> <span style="color: #000000;">Let the Devas see his strength and power of Tapasyâ and let Indra, too, reap the far-reaching effects of his own Karma. Thus saying, Vis&#8217;vakarmâ distressed with anger, offered oblations in the sacrificial Fire, reciting Mantram from the Atharvan Vedas, with the object of producing a son. When Homa was performed for eight nights consecutively, a man quickly came out of that burning fire, as if he was the Incarnate of Fire itself…Father! Of what avail is that to his father when he is not able to remove his sorrows!&#8221; O Father! Shall I drink the ocean or crumble the mountains to dust or shall I obstruct the passage of the rising Sun or shall I kill </span><span style="color: #000000;">Indra, Yama, or the other host of Devas or shall I root out the earth and throw it with all beings into the ocean?&#8221; </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">O King! Hearing thus the sweet words of his son, Vis&#8217;vakarmâ gladly told his mountain-like son &#8220;</span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">O my Son! You are capable to save me from troubles (Vrijina) hence you are named Vritra</span><span style="color: #000000;">. O highly Fortunate One! Your brother, named Tris&#8217;irâ, was a gre</span>at ascetic; his three faces were all very strong. He was thoroughly conversant with the Vedas and the Vedangâs and well versed in all the other knowledges. He remained always engaged in practising asceticism, surprising to the three worlds. Indra killed my qualified son with his thunderbolt; that wicked soul severed the three heads without any offence. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Therefore, O Best of beings! Kill that vicious, shameless, deceitful, wicked Indra</span> guilty of the sin of Brahmahattyâ…&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Indra slaying Vritra is praised in Vedas and many Puranas also. But in the Vedas, it is in metaphor. Wherein Indra means Sun and Vritra means cloud. It could be possible that Vedic verses were composed praising the killing of Vritra by Indra. Vritra was born to avenge the murder of his brother and still, Indra is praised in Vedas. But Vritra seems to be a kind-hearted man who entered into a truce with Indra. But the vicious Indra decided to kill him in a deceitful way. Indra sent Rambha to seduce Vritra so that he may be distracted and that will help Indra to kill Vritra. Indra&#8217;s plan was successful, Vritra fell into this trap and was killed with Indra&#8217;s thunderbolt. The following verse shows that they had entered into a truce,</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Srimad </span><span style="color: #000000;">Devi Bhagavatam 6.1.1-12 &#8220;…</span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The powerful Vritra entered into a treaty and kept himself</span><span style="color: #000000;"> peaceful when Indra and Visnu violated truth and treacherously killed him by Jalaphena (the watery foams)&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Rig Veda and Mahabharata show that Indra sought the help of Vishnu who advised him to befriend Vritra and thus making it easier for Indra to kill Vritra,</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Rig Veda 6.20.2 Even as the power of Dyaus, to thee, O Indra, all Asura sway was by the Gods entrusted, When thou, Impetuous! </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">leagued with Viṣṇu, slewest Vṛtra</span><span style="color: #000000;"> the Dragon who enclosed the waters. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Mahabharata 5.10</span><span style="color: #000000;">.1-43</span><span style="color: #000000;"> &#8220;Indra said, This whole indestructible universe, O gods, hath been pervaded by Vritra. There is nothing that can be equal to the task of opposing him. I was capable of yore, but now I am incapable. What good betide you, can I do? I believe him to be unapproachable. Powerful and magnanimous, possessing immeasurable strength in fight, he would be able to swallow up all the three worlds with the gods, the Asuras, and the men. Therefore, hear ye dwellers of heaven, this is my resolution. Proceeding to the abode of Vishnu, in company with that high-souled Being must we consult, and ascertain the means of slaying this ruthless wretch.&#8217; &#8220;Salya continued, &#8216;Indra having thus spoken, the gods with that host of Rishis repaired to the mighty god Vishnu to place themselves under the-protection of that protector of all. And afflicted with the dread of Vritra, they said unto the Supreme Lord of the deities. Thou hadst in former times covered the three worlds with three steps. Thou hadst procured the ambrosial food, O Vishnu, and destroyed the Asuras in battle. Thou didst bind the great Asura Vali and hadst raised Indra to the throne of heaven. Thou art the lord of the gods, and this entire universe is pervaded by thee. Thou art the God, the mighty Deity, saluted by all persons. Be thou the refuge of all the celestials </span><span style="color: #000000;">together with Indra, O best of gods. The whole universe, O slayer of Asuras, hath been pervaded by Vritra. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">And Vishnu said, &#8216;I am no doubt bound to do what is for your good</span><span style="color: #000000;">. I shall, therefore, tell you of a contrivance whereby he may be annihilated. </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Do ye with the Rishis and the Gandharvas repair to the place where Vritra that bearer of a universal form is and adopt towards him a conciliatory policy</span><span style="color: #000000;">.</span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;"> You will thus succeed in overthrowing him</span><span style="color: #000000;">. By virtue of my power, victory, ye gods, will be won by Indra, for, remaining invisible, I shall enter into his thunderbolt, that best of weapons. O foremost of gods, depart ye with the Rishis and the Gandharvas. Let there be no delay in effecting a peace between Indra and Vritra.&#8217;&#8230;If I do not kill Vritra, this great and mighty Asura of gigantic frame, </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">even by deceit</span><span style="color: #000000;">, it will not go well with me.&#8217; And as Indra thought of all this, bearing Vishnu in mind he beheld at that instant in the sea a mass of froth as large as a hill. And he said, &#8216;This is neither dry, nor wet, nor is it a weapon; let me hurl it at Vritra. Without doubt, he will die immediately.&#8217; And he threw at Vritra that mass of froth blended with the thunderbolt. </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">And Vishnu, having entered within that froth, put an end to the life of Vritra</span><span style="color: #000000;">. And when Vritra was killed, the cardinal points were free from gloom; and there also blew a pleasant breeze; and all beings were much pleased&#8230;&#8221; Tr. K.M. Ganguli</span></p>
<p>The following verses from Padma Purana have a slightly different version that exhibits how Indra killed him,</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Padma Purana II.24.34-43 &#8220;</span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">He thought of a stratagem to kill him. He sent Rambha (after telling her:) &#8221;With this or that trick, delude the great demon</span><span style="color: #000000;">. O auspicious one, do that to delude the great demon, so that by killing him I shall get happiness.&#8221;&#8230;[44b-51] very wise Vrtra, confiding (in Indra) in all matters, and knowing Indra to be a great friend, was not afraid of him. Moving (i.e. he moved) in the great auspicious forest&#8230;Vrtra, having come there, saw that Rambha, with charming, large eyes with his mind full of sexual desire.&#8221; Tr. N.A. Deshpande</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Padma Purana II.25.11-20 &#8220;[Vrtra said] O you beautiful lady, I have sought your shelter. Protect me form the (disturbance caused by) sexual desire. O you of large eyes, resort to me, who am, O dear one, distressed by sexual desire. Rambha said: There is no doubt that today I shall submit myself to you; O hero, you should do whatever I tell you to do&#8230;Having thus established a relation with her, the very powerful best demon enjoyed in that very meritorious forest. The great demon was very much stupefied by her singing, dancing, charming smile and sexual intercourse (with her). She said to that noble and best demon: &#8216;(Please) drink wine; (please) drink madhu-madhavi (a kind of intoxicating drink)&#8230; </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #000000;">But that respectable lady Rambha lovingly gave wine to him against his will</span><span style="color: #000000;">. Due to civility for her he drink wine at that time. </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">When he was extremely stupefied by the wine, and lost his senses, just then Indra struck him with his thunderbolt</span><span style="color: #000000;">. Then that killer of Vrtra (i.e. Indra) was tainted with such sins as killing a brahmana.&#8221; Tr. N.A. Deshpande</span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s mentioned in Shastra that Indra gave part of the Brahmin-slaughter sin to women,</p>
<p>Vasistha Dharma Shastra 5.7. For it has been declared in the Veda, &#8216;When Indra had slain (Vritra) the three-headed son of Tvashtri, he was seized by Sin, and he considered himself to be tainted with exceedingly great guilt. All beings cried out against him (saying to him), &#8216;O thou slayer of a learned Brâhmana! O thou slayer of a learned Brâhmana!&#8217; <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">He ran to the </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">women for protection (and said to them), &#8216;Take upon yourselves the third part of this my guilt (caused by) the murder of a learned Brâhmana</span>.&#8217; They answered, &#8221;What shall we have (for doing thy wish)?&#8217; He replied, &#8216;Choose a boon.&#8217; They said, &#8216;Let us obtain offspring (if our husbands approach us) during the proper season, at pleasure let us dwell (with our husbands until (our children) are born.&#8217; He answered, &#8216;So be it.&#8217; (Then) they took upon themselves (the third part of his guilt). <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">That guilt of Brâhmana-murder appears every month as the menstrual flow</span>. Therefore let him not eat the food of a woman in her courses; (for) such a one has put on the shape of the guilt of Brâhmana-murder.</p>
<p>Violating treaties was no big deal for Indra. A demon named Namuchi had entered into a peace treaty with Indra for fear of being killed. But Indra violated the treaty and killed him,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 8.14.13 13 With waters&#8217; foam thou torest off, Indra, the head of Namuci, Subduing all contending hosts.</p>
<p>Mahabharata 9.43.32-46 &#8220;Vaishampayana said, &#8220;Listen to that history, O ruler of men! Hear of those occurrences as they happened! Hear how Vasava, in days of yore, broke his treaty with Namuchi! The Asura Namuchi, from fear of Vasava, had entered a ray of the Sun. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Indra then made friends with Namuchi and entered into a covenant with him</span>, saying, &#8216;O foremost of Asuras, I shall not slay thee, O friend, with anything that is wet or with anything that is dry! I shall not slay thee in the night or in the day! I swear this to thee by truth. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Having made this covenant, the lord Indra one day beheld a fog. He then, O king, cut off Namuchi&#8217;s head, using the foam of water (as his weapon). </span>The severed head of Namuchi thereupon pursued Indra from behind, saying unto him from a near point these words, &#8216;O slayer of a friend, O wretch!&#8217; Urged on incessantly by that head, Indra repaired to the Grandsire and informed him, in grief, of what had occurred. The Supreme Lord of the universe said unto him, &#8216;Performing a sacrifice, bathe with due rites, O chief of the celestials, in Aruna, that tirtha which saveth from the fear of sin!&#8221; Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Indra and Namuchi having entered into a peace treaty and Indra violating it and killing Namuchi is also mentioned in Panchavimsha Brahmana 12.6.8-9. Mahabharata and Panchavimsha Brahmana has the same version of the story which makes it authentic but there is another version mentioned in Brahma Purana which says that Indra fled the battlefield and Namuchi chased him and he was killed there,</p>
<p>Brahma Purana: Gautami-Mahatmya 54.33-40 &#8220;Brahma said: Formerly, there was a very powerful leader of Daityas named Namuci. His enmity towards Indra was terrible. It caused hairs to stand on end. Once Namuci, the heroic leader of Daityas, saw Indra abandoning the battle and going off. Then he pursued him. On seeing him coming <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Indra became overwhelmed with fear</span>. Leaving off Airavata, Indra entered the foam of water. The thunderbolt-armed Indra instantly killed his enemy through the foam&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">A Brahmin couple was traveling during the night, due to the ailment of the husband, the wife named Sandili carried her husband, due to exhaustion and darkness, she faltered and fell on a pole or Trishul on which a Rishi named Mandavya was performing penance, he was hurt by that so he cursed Kaushik to die when the sun rises. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">Skanda Purana, Avantya Khanda 5, Reva Khanda 3, chapter 171, verses 40-54 &#8220;When those leading Brahmanas went out of sight, the female ascetic Sandili came there on the second day. She was carrying her husband on her head and wandering about at night. She did not see the sage (Mandavya). O Yudhisthira, she was staggering due to the excess of burden. The Brahmana on the stake was not noticed by her. The chaste lady faltered and slipped down against the knees of the Brahmana on the stake. Due to the fall of the faltering lady much pain was caused to the sage&#8230;The sages said: Moving about at will, you appear to be unaware of other people&#8217;s distress and pain. In the morning as soon as the sun rises your husband will die. O low-born woman, only your own misery you know and not that of any other person. Sandili became chagrined at those terrible words.

<h3><a id="war-tactics"></a>War tactics and courage of Hindu gods</h3>
<p>Hindu gods are depicted as brave warriors but these brave warriors were sometimes scared of their enemies and even fled the battlefield. Being gods they also used war tactics same as human beings do. The following verses show how Vishnu, Shiva and Brahma were defeated by a Danava and they fled in fear,</p>
<p>Srimad Devi Bhagavatam 5.7.4-11. &#8220;Seeing the Dânava, Vâsudeva Hari raised his discus in anger and attacked him with great force to kill him. Just when Hari struck the Dânava violently with his Chakra, the powerful Dânava quitted immediately his lion-form, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">assumed the buffalo form and struck Hari with his two horns. Vâsudeva, thus pierced in his breast with the horns, became confounded and fled away</span> as best as he could till he reached his own abode, Vaikuntha. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Seeing Hari thus fleeing away, S&#8217;ankara, too, thought him invulnerable and fled to his Kailâs&#8217;a mountain with fear. Brahmâ, too, fled to his own abode with terror</span>; but the powerful Vâsava took patience and remained steady in the battle. Varuna taking his S&#8217;akti waited patiently for battle. Yama, too, with his staff remained there ready to fight. Kuvera, the Lord of the Yaksas, remained very busy in close fighting with the Dânavas; Fire, taking S&#8217;akti, also waited. The Sun and Moon, the Lord of the stars, both remained in firm resolve to fight with Mahisa, the lord of the Dânavas&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Rama killing Bali.</p>
<p>Rama killed Bali while Bali was busy fighting Hanuman. That too Rama shot an arrow by hiding behind a tree. Rama killing Bali is mentioned in Valmiki Ramayana, Kishkindha Kanda, Ch 16.</p>
<p>Krishna and Balrama vs Yavana army,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 10.52.5-8 &#8220;The Lord again returned to the city of Mathura which was still besieged by the Yavana army. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">He annihilated the Yavana army and carried of their wealth as spoils to Dvaraka</span>. While the wealth was being transported on the backs of men and oxen under the direction of the Imperishable Lord, Jarasandha, commanding an army of twentythree aksauhinis arrived on the scence. Observing their violent onrush of inimical forced, Balarama and Krsna, the descendants of Madhu <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">adopted the human way of life and quickly began to run, Oh king. Though dauntless, they left the vast treasure (the spoils from the Yavana army) and similating terrified cowards, they ran for many yojanas on foot</span>, tender like lotuspetals.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 10.52.10-12 &#8220;Apparently exhausted after fleeing a long distance, the two Lords climbed a high mountain named Pravarṣaṇa, upon which Lord Indra showers incessant rain. Although he knew They were hiding on the mountain, Jarāsandha could find no trace of Them. Therefore, O King, he placed firewood on all sides and set the mountain ablaze. The two of Them then suddenly jumped from the burning mountain, which was eleven yojanas high, and fell to the ground.&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Vishnu beheads the demons by assuming the form of a woman,</p>
<p>Agni Purana 3.11-15 &#8220;Taking ambrosia from his hands the Daityas gave half of it to the gods and went away with the other half. Vishnu, the root of creation, then assumed the form of a (beautiful) damsel. Beholding her endued with beauty, the Daityas, overcome with fascination, said &#8216;Be our wife, take this ambrosia, O fair one and make us partake of it.&#8217; Saying &#8216;So be it&#8217; Hari took it from them and made the celestials drink of it. Assuming the form of the moon Rahu drank up the portion offered to the sun and moon and therefore his head was severed off his head by his enemy Hari. He then said to Hari, the giver of boon. &#8216;By thy mercy I have attained immortality.&#8221; Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>

<h3><a id="enemy"></a>Mercilessly killing the enemy</h3>
<p>Hindu gods mercilessly killed their enemies. They beheaded them, peeled out the skin, cut off all the limbs, cut them into pieces, burned them, etc.</p>
<p>Srimad Devi Bhagavatam 5.26.62-65 &#8220;Vyâsa said:&#8211; O King! Hearing thus the words of Ambikâ, Kâlikâ spoke to Her again:&#8211; &#8220;In this war-sacrifice there is this axe which is like a sacrificial post; I will offer these two as victims to Thy sacrifice. Thus no act of envy will be committed (i.e., killing in a sacrifice is not considered as envy).&#8221; Thus saying, the Kâlikâ Devî cut off their heads with great force and gladly drank their blood. Thus seeing the two Asuras killed, Ambikâ said gladly:&#8211; Thou hast done the service to the gods; so I will give Thee an excellent boon. O Kâlikâ! As Thou hast killed Chanda and Munda, henceforth Thou wilt be renowned in this world as Châmundâ.&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Agni Purana 234.8-16 &#8220;Now I shall describe the measures of illusion to be practised by a king in frightening away the hearts of a hostile army, to show that the God is on the side of his countrymen&#8230;Similarly the quarters of the enemy should be denuded with showers of simulated blood, and a similar severed head of the adversary should be exhibited at the terrace of the palace.&#8221; Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 8.10.57 &#8220;Thereafter, two very powerful demons named Mālī and Sumālī were killed by the Supreme Lord, who severed their heads with His disc. Then Mālyavān, another demon, attacked the Lord. With his sharp club, the demon, who was roaring like a lion, attacked Garuḍa, the lord of the birds, who are born from eggs. But the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the original person, used His disc to cut off the head of that enemy also.&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Srimad Devi Bhagavatam 5.14.40-56 &#8220;…Mahâ Mâyâ then, became very angry and began to hurl arrows after arrows so incessantly that all the armours of all the Dânavas became pierced and were cut down to pieces…&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Rudrasamhita 2, Yuddha Khanda section V, 55.30 &#8220;At the bidding of Siva, lord Krsna, the destroyer of heroic enemies, chopped off several arms of Bana by means of Sudarsana.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 10.59.14 &#8220;The Lord severed the heads, thighs, arms, legs and armor of these opponents led by Pīṭha and sent them all to the abode of Yamarāja. Narakāsura, the son of the earth, could not contain his fury when he saw the fate of his military leaders. Thus he went out of the citadel with elephants born from the Milk Ocean who were exuding mada from their foreheads out of excitement.&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Skanda Purana I.iii(P).11.27 &#8220;Then, the Goddess who tormented Mahisa, cut off his head with a sharp-edged sword and stood on his head and danced.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Valmiki Ramayana Aranya Kanda, 26.13-15 &#8220;Neverthless, as Dushana rushed upon him, Rama cut off both his arms with his arrows, and that mace, loosed from his grasp, fell forward on the field like unto the banner of Indra, Whilst Dushana, bereft of it, his arms severed, sank to the earth like a mighty elephant that, stripped of its tusks, succumbs.&#8221; Tr. Hari Prasad Shastri</p>
<p>Mahabharata Vana Parva 3.202.35 &#8220;Markandeya continued, &#8216;Then Govinda began to reflect but uncovered space found he none and when he could not discover any spot that was uncovered on earth or in the sky, that foremost Deity then beheld his thighs to be absolutely uncovered. And there, O king, the illustrious Deity cut off the heads of Madhu and Kaitabha with his keenedged discus!'&#8221; Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>

<p>Devi Bhagavatam 5.30.37-64. &#8220;Vyâsa said :&#8211; O King! Thus saying the Chandikâ Devî instantly cut off the head of Nis&#8217;umbha by Her axe with great caution. The head thus severed from the body by the blow of the Devî, the headless Demon began to roam there with great force with club in his hand.

<h2><a id="fighting-eachother"></a>Gods fighting each other</h2>
<p>Other than killing innocent people, Hindu gods were also engaged in fighting each other. Several questions arise when reading stories of gods fighting each other. Which god is right when two gods fight each other? Are Hindu gods so stupid not to understand right and wrong that they have to become physical with each other? What example are they leaving for human beings by fighting with each other? Can&#8217;t Hindu gods forgive the other to give an example to their creation? Or can&#8217;t they settle the matter through talks?</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SHIVA VS YAMA</span></strong></p>
<p>Brahma Purana 35.11 &#8220;Obeisance to one who annhilated the god of Death&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Jagdish Lal Shastri writes, &#8220;Annihilated the god of death. Siva gave Mrkandu a boon that a pious son would be born to him but he would live only for sixteen years. The child was born and named Markandeya. He was educated in Vedas and Sastras. When the hour of his death arrived, the boy embraced the linga idol of Siva. When Yama, the god of death came to fetch him, the angry Siva arose out of the idol and killed Yama. At the request of gods Yama was revived to life but Markandeya was granted youth for ever.&#8221;</p>
<p>Brahma Purana: Gautami-Mahatmya 24.9-21 &#8220;Brahma said: Then Mrtyu with the noose in his hand entered the place where that brahmin was worshipping Siva. The brahmin was not at all aware of either Yama&#8217;s servants or Mrtyu himself&#8230;Then Mrtyu thew up the noose against Sveta. O great sages, Nandin then became angry. Nandin hit Mrtyu with the baton given by Siva. Mrtyu fell on the ground. Then the messengers saw that Mrtyu was struck down. They intimated the incident to Yama. Then Dharma whose vehicle is buffalo and who controls all addressed his attendants and associates&#8230;&#8217;Hurry up, hurry up&#8217;, said Yama to them and himself proceeded ahead, surrounded by these and others, to the place where Sveta the excellent brahmin was worshipping Siva&#8230;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Karttikeya pierced the servants of Yama by means of his javelin. He killed Yama</span>, the powerful ruler of southern quarter.&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SHIVA&#8217;S VIRABHADRA VS GODS</span></strong></p>
<p>Daksha organized a Yajna and invited all gods and sages except for his son in law Shiva and spoke ill of Shiva. So Shiva&#8217;s wife asks him to destroy the sacrifice of Daksha. On being requested Shiva creates a form called Virabhadra. Virabhadra then goes to the place and destroys everything, kicks and beats up the sages, paralyses some Devas and kills some, cuts off Agni&#8217;s tongue, plucks out eyes of Bhaga and does many more violent things and finally beheads Daksha,</p>
<p>Kurma Purana I.15.35-42 &#8220;Sri Devi said: O Sankara, Daksa who had been my father in the previous birth is performing a Yajna after censuring your status and your own self&#8230;Please destroy that sacrifice immediately&#8230;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Thus implored by the goddess, the great Lord, the Lord of Devas, created Rudra immediately with a desire to destroy the Yajna of Daksa</span>. He was highly infuriated. He had a thousand heads, a thousand eyes and huge arms, a thousand in number. He was invincible. He resembled the fire at the close of the Yugas. He was terrible due to his curved fangs. He could not be seen (directly) due to his glaring brilliance. He held a conch and a discus. He had a staff in his hand. He roared loudly. He held a horn in his hand and was beautified with Bhasma (ashes). <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">He became famous as Virabhadra</span>&#8230;Siva spoke to him thus: &#8216;O Ganesvara (leader of the attendants). Blessings unto you. After censuring me, Daksa is performing a Yajna, at Gangadvara, (near the source of the river Ganga). Destroy that sacrifice of Daksa.&#8217; <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Then the sacrifice of Daksa was destroyed by Virabhadra playfully like a single lion released from bondage</span>&#8230; [59b-67a] The leaders of Ganas became infuriated. They uprooted the sacrificial posts and threw them here and there. The Ganesvaras, all of whom were terrible ones, took the sacrificial horse along with the Prastotr and Hotr (the priests) and hurled them into the currents of Ganga. Even <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Virabhadra whose mind was ablaze with wrath, paralysed the hand of Indra</span> as he raised it to strike and did the same to other gods. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Sportively he plucked out the eyes of Bhaga by the tip of his finger nails. Hitting with his fist he felled down the teeth of Pusan</span>. The mighty leader of Ganas sportively and smilingly kicked Lord Moon with the big toe of his leg. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">O excellent sages, he cut off the pair of hands of fire and playfully plucked out his tongue</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Then he kicked sages on their heads. The mighty one then pierced Visnu, who had been coming thither on his Garuda with sharp arrows after stunning Sudarsana</span>. The powerful Garuda stared at the Gana and suddenly hit him with his wings and roared like the ocean.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Also mentioned in Linga Purana Section I, 82.98-103; Varaha Purana chapter 21. After Daksha was beheaded a goat&#8217;s head was fixed and was resurrected as mentioned in Devi Bhagavatam 7.30.39-50, as per Linga Purana Section I.82.98-103 Saraswati&#8217;s lips and nose were also cut off. This story mentioned in Linga Purana is more violent,</p>
<p>Linga Purana Section I.100.15-19 &#8220;&#8230;Virabhadra of great splendour and undistressed soul made the hands of Indra and other Devas stunned as they raised them. He uprooted the eyes of Bhaga sportively with the tip of his finger. With his fist he hit the teeth of Pusan and made them fall. He kicked the moon with the toe of his foot. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">He cut off the head of lord Indra. After cutting off the hands of Agni and after uprooting his tongue</span> sportively he kicked him on his head with his leg. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">He cut off the staff of Yama</span>. He hit lord Isana a guardian of the quarters of great strength by means of his trident. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Without any difficulty he killed thirty three Devas thus</span>. Sportingly he killed three thousand three hundred and thirty three Devas along with the three leading Devas. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">He killed the leading sages too</span>. This lord killed those Devas who stood in readiness for fighting. Lord Rudra hit them with his fist, swords, arrows and other things. Then Visnu of great splendour and intensified strength lifted up his discus, and fought with Rudra. A terrible fight ensured between them. It made hairs to stand on end.&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Rudra Samhita 2, Satikhanda Section 2.1.32-34 &#8220;They worked a great havoc there. Virabhadra chastised everyone and spared none. After defeating Visnu and the Devas with strenuous effort, the chief of Ganas cut off the head of Daksa and consigned it to the sacrificial fire. Working great havoc he destroyed the sacrifice. Then he came back to the mountain and bowed to Lord Siva&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>There is another story that may talk about a different event but it looks like it&#8217;s about this same event,</p>
<p>Skanda Purana V.ii.64.19b-25 &#8220;The share of Sambhu was not appropriated by Brahma in his sacrifice. Mahadeva is the annihilator of the universe. (But,) O king, he (too) was deluded by his sense-organs and he became angry with Suras (Devas). The Suras are the Vibhutis (empowered parts) of Siva. All the three worlds are solely intended for his sport. Yet, by him the bow was strung well for the sake of a share! The teeth of Pusan were shattered. Divakara (the Sun) was made unconscious. The eyes of Bhaga were plucked and the god of Yajna in the form of an antelope was hit. The Devas turned into Pasus (animals). The sages were denied the Vedas. The Dharmasastras of the sages were taken away by the all powerful Lord&#8230;&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SHIVA VS GANESHA</span></strong></p>
<p>Shiva Purana Rudrasamhita 2, Kumara Khanda IV.13.15-20 &#8220;Once when Parvati was taking her bath, Sadasiva rebuked Nandin and came into the inner apartment. The mother of the universe, seeing the untimely arrival of Siva in the midst of her bath and toilet stood up. The beautiful lady was very shy then&#8230;At the time when the incident occurred, Parvati, the great Maya, the great goddess, thought as follows. &#8216;There must be a servant of my own who will be expert in his duties. He must not stray from my behest even a speck.&#8217; Thinking thus the goddess created a person with all the characteristics, out of the dirt from her body. [30-37] Thus placing her son at the doorway, Parvati began to take bath with her friends, unworried. O excellent sage, at this very moment Siva who is eagerly indulgent and an expert in various divine sports came near the door. Not knowing that he was lord Siva, the consort of Parvati, Ganesa said &#8216;O sir, without my mother&#8217;s permission you shall not go in now. My mother has entered the bath. Where are you going now? Go away&#8217; saying thus, he took up his staff to ward him off. On seeing him Siva said &#8216;O foolish fellow, whom are you forbidding? O wicked knave, don&#8217;t you know me? I am Siva, none else&#8217;. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Thereupon Ganesa beat Siva with the staff</span>. Siva expert in various sports became infuriated&#8230;When lord Siva tried to enter the house, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Ganesa became infuriated, O brahmin, and struck him with his staff once again</span>.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Shiva Purana Rudra Samhita 4, Kumarakhanda IV, 16.7-8 O sage, after fighting for a long time along with the army and seeing him terrific, even Siva was greatly surprised. Thinking withing himself &#8221;He has to be killed only by deception and not otherwise&#8221; he stayed in the midst of the army. [11-12] Then Ganesa the heoioc son of Sakti following the course of heroes, at first worshipped (i.e., struck) Visnu with his staff, Visnu who confers happiness to all. &#8221;I shall cause him delusion. Then let him be killed by you, O lord. Without deception he cannot be killed. He is of Tamasika nature and inaccessible.&#8221; [29-35] After remembering the lotus like feet of Siva, Visnu took up his discus and split the iron club by means of discus. Ganesa hurled the piece of iron club at Visnu which was caught by the bird Garuda and rendered futile. Thus for a long time the two heroes Visnu and Ganesa fought with each other. Again the foremost among heroes, the son of Parvati took up his staff of unrivalled power remembering Siva and struck Visnu with it. Struck with that unbearable blow he fell on the ground. But he got up, quickly and fought with Parvati&#8217;s son. Securing this opportunity, </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">the Trident-bearing deity came there and cut off his head with his trident</span><span style="color: #000000;">. O Narada, when the head of Ganesa was cut off, the armies of the gods and the Ganas stood still.&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">What kind of gods are these? One (Ganesha) doesn&#8217;t know his own father, the other (Shiva) who is considered The destroyer couldn&#8217;t kill Ganesha, so with the help of Vishnu he beheads a child that too by using deception.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #000000;">SHIVA VS BRAHMA</span></strong></p>
<p>Varaha Purana 97.1-7 &#8220;Varaha said: O Earth, now listen to the origin of Rudra Vrata, by knowing which one gets freed from all sins. The red-eyed and tawny coloured Rudra who was created by Brahma in his third birth, was borne by him in pleasure on his shoulder. When he was thus on the shoulder, the fifth head of Brahma told Rudra the Atharvan mantra by which release is obtained. &#8216;O Kapalin, Rudra, Babhru, Bhava, Kairata, Suvrata, my valiant and broad-eyed son, do protect this world&#8217;. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">When Rudra was thus addressed by the names which he would be getting in future he was angry at the word &#8216;Kapala&#8217; used and clipped off that (fifth) head</span>. The head was clipped off by the nail in the left thumb, but it got to the hand.&#8221; Tr. Venkitasubramonia Iyer, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>All Puranas are unanimous that Shiva beheaded Brahma but there is variation as to why he beheaded him, above verses say that Shiva was infuriated when Brahma called him Kapala but Kurma Purana II.31.1-32 says that Brahma and Shiva were quarreling over supremacy and Shiva found Brahma arrogant so he in anger cut off the head of Brahma. There are a few other versions. Shiva beheading Brahma is also mentioned in Skanda Purana V.iii.173.1-5; Brahma Purana: Gautami-Mahatmya 43.19-23; Shiva Purana, Vayaviyasamhita 6, Section I, 30.19</p>
<p>There is a story in Shiva Purana which says that Shiva was going to kill Brahma because Brahma watched his wife lustfully and even discharged semen,</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Rudrasamhita 2, Satikhanda 2.19.43- &#8220;Lord Siva said:- O patriarch Daksa what has just been requested by Visnu my great devotee and agreed to by me shall be done here. &#8216;O lord, whoever stares at Sati lustfully shall be killed by you.&#8217; I Shall make these words of Visnu true by killing Brahma. Why did Brahma stare at Sati lustfully? Moreover he has committed a sin by discharging his semen. Hence I shall kill him.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Brahma begs for mercy and at last, Vishnu acts as a mediator and pacifies Shiva and urges him not to kill Brahma and Shiva agrees. Another version of the story is mentioned in Vamana Purana,</p>
<p>Vamana Purana 2.35-37 &#8220;Discerning forthwith the faces resembling the Sun, the face of Brahman remarked thus, &#8216;Bubbles are formed when water is disturbed, Is there any valour in them&#8217;? The great Sankara who was enraged to hear this severed with the tip of his nail the head of Brahman which had spoken to him rudely. Thus chopped, the head fell on the left paml of Sankara himself and never dropped down from his hand.&#8221; Tr. Anand Swarup Gupta</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SHIVA VS AURVA</span></strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s not actually a fight. Shiva burns up the hermitage of sage Aurva for which Aurva curses him.</p>
<p>Varaha Purana 147.9-14 &#8220;Then in that famous tirtha known as Goniskramana, lord Siva came near him. Aurva was then going to the river Ganga to gather lotus flowers. Knowing him thus out of the hermitage, Siva entered it. It was auspicios, beautiful and full of fruits and flowers. But it was soon reduced to ashes by the heat of the halo of Siva. After burning that hermitage, Siva quickly returned to (his abdode in) the Himalayas. [19-] From that moment Siva, although he is the lord of the world, began to be tormented by great heat, and he told Parvati: &#8216;Seeing the penance of Aurva, the gods were afraid and they told me: &#8216;The heat of the penance of this Aurva affects the whole world. But he does not desire anything. How can we remedy thiss?&#8217; When told thus, I caste my eye on his hermitage. In a moment it was burnt down, and we returned. Being sorry and angry at this, Aurva cursed me, and that has resulted in this torment of mine.&#8221; Tr. Venkitasubramonia Iyer, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">KRISHNA VS SHIVA</span></strong></p>
<p>Aniruddh the grandson of Krishna fell in love with Uma the daughter of Banasura. So he followed her to her palace and was captured by Banasura&#8217;s men. Aniruddha didn&#8217;t return home for months and Sage Narada informed that Aniruddha has been captured by Banasura. So the battle between Krishna and Banasura ensued. Banasura was a devotee of Shiva and several other Shiva&#8217;s followers were harassed by Krishna so Shiva decided to help Banasura in the battle. Kartikeya son of Shiva also helped him. Banasura along with Shiva were overpowered by Krishna so Shiva requested Krishna not to kill Banasura so Krishna only cuts off the hands of Banasura.</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 10.63.12-14 &#8220;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Lord Śiva, wielder of the trident, shot various weapons at Lord Kṛṣṇa</span>, wielder of Śārṅga. But Lord Kṛṣṇa was not in the least perplexed: He neutralized all these weapons with appropriate counterweapons. Lord Kṛṣṇa counteracted a brahmāstra with another brahmāstra, a wind weapon with a mountain weapon, a fire weapon with a rain weapon, and Lord Śiva&#8217;s personal pāśupatāstra weapon with His own personal weapon, the nārāyaṇāstra. After bewildering Lord Śiva by making him yawn with a yawning weapon, Lord Kṛṣṇa proceeded to strike down Bāṇāsura&#8217;s army with His sword, club and arrows.&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 10.63.22 &#8220;After Lord Śiva&#8217;s followers had been driven away, the Śiva-jvara, who had three heads and three feet, pressed forward to attack Lord Kṛṣṇa. As the Śiva-jvara approached, he seemed to burn everything in the ten directions. Seeing this personified weapon approach, Lord Nārāyaṇa then released His own personified fever weapon, the Viṣṇu-jvara. The Śiva-jvara and Viṣṇu-jvara thus battled each other. The Śiva-jvara, overwhelmed by the strength of the Viṣṇu-jvara, cried out in pain. But finding no refuge, the frightened Śiva-jvara approached Lord Kṛṣṇa, the master of the senses, hoping to attain His shelter. Thus with joined palms he began to praise the Lord. The Śiva-jvara said: I bow down to You of unlimited potencies, the Supreme Lord, the Supersoul of all beings. You possess pure and complete consciousness and are the cause of cosmic creation, maintenance and dissolution. Perfectly peaceful, You are the Absolute Truth to whom the Vedas indirectly refer.&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SHIVA VS VISHNU</span></strong></p>
<p>There is another battle between Shiva and Krishna. And in this battle, Shiva helps Kasiraja and is defeated by Krishna. But in Skanda Purana it is a battle between Shiva and Vishnu. The discus of Krishna manifests itself as Vishnu. The story is that a King named Paundraka claims to be Vasudeva, this angers Krishna and he prepares for a battle against the imposter Vasudeva (Paundraka). King Paundraka is helped by his friend who is also a king of Kasi named Kasiraja. Since Kasiraja was a devotee of Shiva he propitiates Shiva for help in the battle against Krishna and Shiva agrees to help him,</p>
<p>Skanda Purana II.ii.12.14-18 &#8220;&#8230;Nila mountain is in the third Yojana (i.e. 3X12 Kms.). This is the holy spot of the Lord of Gauri named Ekamrakavana. Not far off, O king, is the place where, being afraid, he sought refuge. Indradyumna said: Why was the Lord of Gauri (Siva) frightened? With whom did he seek refuge?&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Skanda Purana II.ii.12.45-57 &#8220;O king, many king ruled over that city. Formerly in Dvapara Yuga, there was a king there (commonly) called Kasiraja. By means of severe penance he propitiated Lord Sambhu with this aim in his mind: &#8216;I will excel in war Acyuta (Krsna), the conquerer of kings, the chief of whom is Jaraasandha.&#8217; The Pinaka-bearing Lord (Siva) who was propitiated, granted him that boon: &#8216;O suppressor of enemies, you will conquer the Slayer of Kamsa in battle. For your sake I shall fight seated on my Bull, along with (my attendants) Pramathas&#8230;That Lord (Krsna) who is the immanent soul (of all), knew the incident of that sort, and sent his Discus for killing Kasiraja. The infuriated Discus that was very fierce in appearance, had the refulgence of a thousand suns. It knew the power of the mind of Visnu. It cut off the head of Kasiraja and burned to ash his army as well as that city. On seeing that extremely violent action Pasupati (Siva) became furious. Surrounded by his Ganas and seated on his Bull, the Pinaka-bearing Lord rushed at it. Then Sambhu looked at the Sudarsana Discus at the outset and discharged his Pasupata missile in front of it, like an ominous calamity. Formerly Sambhu had secured a boon from Visnu who had been pleased by his devotion: &#8216;On being remembered by you I shall invigorate your missile. But if you go against me, it will become lustreless (and ineffective.&#8217; When this Pasupata missile which was (usually) terrible, became futile and when Varanis was burned, the Bull-bannered Lord became afraid. Then he eulogized the Primordial Purusottama, the cause of all the worlds.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Skanda Purana II.ii.12.65-77 &#8220;When (the Lord) who burned the Tripuras eulogized thus, Adhoksaja (Visnu) manifested himself after casting off the form of the Discus. His face (indicated that he was) delighted. The glorious Lord held the conch, the discus and the iron club. He was seated on Garuda as if on a lotus seat&#8230;Though he was an ocean of mercy, he spoke the husband of Girija (who was) firghteneed, as if he waas angry with him. Sri Bhagavan said: How has such an evil-mindedness beset you at this time? O Sambhu, for the sake of an insect (i.e. an insignificant) king, you have come to fight with me! How many examples of my power have not been known to you, O Durjati (Siva). It is true that your Pasupati missile cannot be vanquished by Suras and Asuras. The Discus is a form of my anger. I t cannot spare even you&#8230;Now if you wish to sport about with Gauri here for a long time, if you wish that this city of Varanasi should stay for a long time (do as follows). On the shore of the Southern Sea there is a holy spot well known after my name, viz. Sripurusottama. It is adorned by Nila mountain&#8230;O annihilator of Tripuras, stay there fearlessly along with Parvati.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Skanda Purana II.ii.12.80-83 &#8220;Narada said: On being told thus by Vasudeva the Three-eyed Lord bent down his head. With palms joined in reverence he spoke to the slayer of Madhu: Mahadeva said: O Lord of Devas, O Lord of the universe, O Lord, O dispeller of the agony of those who bow down (to you) carrying out your behest will be the cause of my welfare, O Lord of the worlds. On account of my stupidity, O Lord, I had been arrogant. There, O Lord, your own blessing is the cause of my fickleness. Since you command me, O Lord of Devas, to proceed to Purusottama, I shall carry out your behest reverently and proceed to the auspicious holy place that bestows salvation&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Krishna beheads Kasiraja with his Sudarshan Chakra as mentioned in Srimad Bhagavatam 10.66.22.</p>
<p>There was another battle between Shiva and Vishnu. Where Shiva kills Vishnu&#8217;s three sons in the form of a bull for creating havoc and Vishnu fights Shiva and is defeated by that Bull, Vishnu wasn&#8217;t aware that the bull was actually Shiva,</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Satarudra Samhita 3, chapter 23, verses 3-12 &#8220;Then the bull attacked Visnu&#8217;s sons wielding their bows for fighting, deluded by Siva&#8217;s Maya and proud of their great strenght and exploit. O excellent sage, the sons of Visnu becamame furious. Those heroes roared loudly and rushed against Siva. Rudra in that form of a bull was furious at those sons of Visnu who rushed at him. He kicked them with his hoofs and tore them with his horns. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">When their limbs were split by Rudra, they swooned and lost their lives. They were immediately destroyed</span>. When they were killed Visnu the foremost of the strong came out shouting loudly and hastened towards Siva<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">. On Seeing Siva in the form of the bull going along after killing his sons, Visnu hit him with divine arrows and missiles</span>. Then the infuriated Siva, the highly powerful one in the form of a bull stood like a mountain and caught hold of all those milssiles of Visnu&#8230;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The lord leaped up suddenly and kicked the infuriated Visnu who was deluded and could not realise him. The lord then tore him with his horns</span>. Unable to bear the onslaught, Visnu deluded by Maya was exhausted and utterly shattered.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Satarudra Samhita 3, chapter 23, verses 13-16 &#8220;When his pride fell off, Visnu was dejected, and dispirited. He then realised that Siva was sporting about in the form of a bull. Then on realising that Siva himself had come in the form of a Bull, Visnu spoke in a shrill voice with drooping shoulders and palms joined in reverence. Visnu said: O lord of the gods, O ocean of mercy, O lord Siva, I had been deluded by your Maya and my mind had been confused. O lord, I fought with you, Siva. Taking pity on me, O lord, let this offence be excused.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SHIVA&#8217;S VIRABHADRA VS VISHNU&#8217;S NARASIMHA</span></strong></p>
<p>The story of Vishnu’s Narasimha avatar killing Hiranyakashipu with his claws by placing him on his lap is well known. This story ends with the killing of Hiranyakaship in Vaishnavite Puranas, however, it has an addition in Shaivite Puranas which says that this avatar of Vishnu was killed by Shiva’s Sharaba form and this story can be found only in Shaivite Puranas to show Shiva as superior to Vishnu. The summary of the story is that fiery Narasimha didn’t just stop after killing Hiranyakaship, Narasimha created havoc on the earth and was going to annihilate the universe. Gods propitiated “The Destroyer” Shiva to stop it and save the world. Hence, Shiva sent his Virabhadra form to pacify Narasimha avatar. Virabhadra praised Narasimha and requested him to stop the annihilation of the universe as “The Destroyer” is only Shiva but all in vain. Sweet words of Narasimha instead infuriated Narasimha and he held the Virabhadra form. Thence Virabhadra form disappeared with a change in environment marking the advent of the most fierce form of Shiva known as Sharaba. This form is explained in the following way,</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Satarudrasamhita 3, chapter 12, verses 2-11 &#8220;Nandisvara said: Thus admonished by Virabhadra, the Man-lion became furious. He roared and began to seize him with force. In the meantime, the splendour of Siva rose up unbearably enveloping the sky all around. It was terrible and cause for imminent fear. Then in a trice the form of Virabhhadra became invisible&#8230;Even as all the gods stood watching with the auspicious shouts of victory, Lord Siva became manifest in the form the Annihilator. He had a thousand hands and wore matted hair. His head was adorned with wings and beak. His body was fierce and fully developed. His fangs were very sharp. Adamantine claws were his weapons. His neck was black in colour. He had a huge arms and four legs. He was blazing like fire. His voice was resonant and terrible like the rumbling sound of the clouds that gather at the end of a Yuga. His three eyes were as wide and blazing as the fire of the evil spirit of great fury. His fangs and lips were clearly visible. He was producing a hissing sound of Humkara. Siva of such a form appeared in sight.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>The following verses show Virabhadra’s attempt to calm Narasimha which further infuriated Narasimha,</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Satarudrasamhita 3, chapter 11, verses 25-27 &#8220;[Virabhadra says] O lord Narasimha, O soul of the universe, subdue this extremely terrible body yourself in my presence. Nandisvara said; Urged thus with quiet peaceful words of Virabhadra, the arrogant man-lion assumed a more terrible anger&#8230;The Man-lion said: Go back the way you have come from. Do not speak offending words. I am now going to annihilate the universe of the mobile and immobile beings.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>The following verses show how he killed Narasimha and skinned him to wear it as a garment.</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Satarudrasamhita 3, chapter 12, verses 12-36 &#8220;At his very vision Visnu lost his strength and exploit. He assumed a lustre of the flickering glow-worm beneath the sun. Fluttering with his wings, and tearing the navel and legs he bound the legs of the Man-lion with his tail and his hands with his own hands. He struck his chest, caught hold of Visnu. It expanded in the sky along with the gods and sages. Like a vulture seizing a serpent he fearlessly caught hold of Visnu, lifted him up and fell him to the ground. At the time of flight he was excessively oppressed being hit with the wings. Then Lord Siva took Visnu and flew him. All the gods followed him eulogising him with the words of obeisance. Brahma and other sages bowed to him with reverence and love. Being led thus Visnu was helpless. His face was pallid and sorrowful. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">With palms joined in reverence he eulogised Lord Siva with prayers of simple words</span>. After eulogising Mrda with the hundred and eight names of the lord, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Nrsimha requested lord Sarabha again. &#8216;O great lord, whenever my ignorant mind becomes defiled by arrogance, it shall be removed by you alone&#8217;</span> Nandisvara said: Thus saying with love to Siva, the Man-lion turned submissive and bowed to him. Visnu was utterly defeated and came to the end of his life&#8230;Lord Virabhadra, the leader of the Ganas, of great strength, peeled off the hide of the Man-lion and went to the mountain taking it with him. From that time Siva began to wear the hide of the Man-lion. His head was the leading bead in his necklace of skulls.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Linga Purana says that only bones were left with a face but Shiva Purana says that Virabhadra/Sharabha used Narasimha’s head as bead in his necklace of skulls. Sharabha killing Narasimha is also mentioned in other verses. Brahma says in Skanda Purana,<br />
Skanda Purana I.iii(U).16.17 &#8220;If you had not killed Nrhari (Man-lion) by assuming the form of Sarabha (i.e. a fabulous eight footed animal) alone, he would have destroyed the universe like Hiranyakasipu.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">INDRA VS SHIVA</span></strong></p>
<p>Mahabharata, Drona Parva 7, Section 202, Verses 82-84 &#8220;When the triple city began to burn, the goddess Durga went to see the sight, with a child on her lap having only five clumps of hair on its head. Uma then asked the gods who that child was. The malevolent Indra then tried to strike him with the thunder-bolt. Thereupon the all-powerful Lord of all the worlds, possessed of the six excellent qualities the Bhagas, smilingly paralysed the arm of the enraged Indra wielding the thunder bolt.&#8221; Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>

<p>Rig Veda 1.170.2 The Maruts are thy brothers. Why, O Indra, wouldst thou take our lives? Agree with them in friendly wise, and do not slay us in the fight.</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">KRISHNA VS INDRA</span></strong></p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 5.30.51-68 &#8220;&#8230;and Indra accordingly, attended by the army of the celestials, marched to attack Hari, in defence of the Parijata tree. The gods were armed with clubs, swords, maces, and darts; and Indra wielded the thunderbolt. As soon as Govinda saw the king of the gods advancing against him on his elephant, attended by the immortals, he blew his shell so that the sound filled all the regions, and he showered smilingly myriads of arrows upon his assailants&#8230;The son of Devaki thew his mace at the club of Yama, and cast it broken upon the ground: he cut in bits the litter of the lord of the sun: he severed Agni into a hundred parts with his arrows, and scattered the Vasus through the realms of space: with his discus he cut off the points of tridents of Rudras, and cast themselves upon the earth: and with the shafts shot from his bow he dispersed the Sadhyas, Visvas, Maruts, and Gandharbas, like fleeces of cotton from the pods of the wings and nails, and bit and bruised and scratched the deities who opposed his lord&#8230;When all other weapons had been cut to pieces, Indra stood armed with his thunderbolt, and Krshna with the discus Sudarsana. Beholding them thus prepared to fight, all the people of the three spheres exclaimed, &#8216;Alas! alas!&#8217; Indra launched his bolt, but in vain, for Hari caught and arrested it&#8230;&#8221; Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>H.H. Wilson summarizes this as,</p>
<p>&#8220;Krishńa restores her earrings to Adití, and is praised by her: he visits the gardens of Indra, and at the desire of Satyabhámá carries off the Párijáta tree. Śachí excites Indra to its rescue. Conflict between the gods and Krishńa, who defeats them. Satyabhámá derides them. They praise Krishńa.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">VISHNU VS LAKSHMI</span></strong></p>
<p>Now, this is a good lesson to all married men, do not provoke your wife and do not talk about other women, she can even behead you. Lakshmi beheads Vishnu using a curse because Vishnu laughed at her unnecessarily,</p>
<p>Srimad Devi Bhagavatam 1.5.74-86 &#8220;Does anything take place in this world without any cause? <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Now hear why Hari&#8217;s head was cut off</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Once on a time, seeing the beautiful face of His dear wife Laksmî Devî, Hari laughed in presence of Her</span>. At this Laksmî Devî came to understand that &#8220;He has seen surely something ugly in my face and therefore He laughed; otherwise why my Husband would laugh at seeing me. But what reason can there be as to see ugliness in my face after so long a time. And why shall <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">He laugh without seeing something ugly, without any cause. Or it may be, He has made some other beautiful woman as my co-wife</span>&#8220;. Thus arguing variously in her mind, Mahâ Laksmî gradually got angry and Tamo guna slowly possessed Her. Then, by turn of Fate, in order that god&#8217;s work might be completed, very fierce Tamas Sakti entered into Her body. She got very angry and slowly said:&#8211; &#8220;Let Thy head fall off&#8221;. Thus, owing to feminine nature and the destiny of Bhagvan, Laksmî cursed without any thought of good or bad, causing Her own suffering. By the Tâmasî S&#8217;akti possessing Her, she thought that a co-wife would be more painful than Her widowhood and thus She cursed Him. Falsehood, vain boldness, craftiness, stupidity, impatience, over-greediness, impurity, and harshness are the natural qualities of women. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Owing to that curse, the head of Vasudeva has fallen into the salt ocean</span>. Now I will fix the head on His body as before…&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">VISHNU VS GODS</span></strong></p>
<p>Gods accidentally or deliberately cut off the head of Vishnu. Vishnu slept placing his head at the end of a bow. Gods created white ants and made a deal with them and made them gnaw the bowstring. When they did so it cut off the head of Vishnu,</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana 14.1.1.6-9 Now he who is this Vishnu is the sacrifice; and he who is this sacrifice is yonder Âditya (the sun). But, indeed, Vishnu was unable to control that (love of) glory of his; and so even now not every one can control that (love of) glory of his. Taking his bow, together with three arrows, he stepped forth. He stood, resting his head on the end of the bow. Not daring to attack him, the gods sat themselves down all around him. Then the ants said&#8211;these ants (vamrî), doubtless, were that (kind called) &#8216;upadîkâ &#8216;&#8211;&#8216;What would ye give to him who should gnaw the bowstring?&#8217;&#8211;&#8216;We would give him the (constant) enjoyment of food, and he would find water even in the desert: so we would give him every enjoyment of food.&#8217;&#8211;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">&#8216;So be it,&#8217; they said. Having gone nigh unto him, they gnawed his bowstring. When it was cut, the ends of the bow, springing asunder, cut off Vishnu&#8217;s head</span>.</p>
<p>Srimad Devi Bhagavatam 1.5.23-36 &#8220;Brahmâ said :&#8211; We will give you, too, share in this our Yajña (sacrifice); so hear me; do our work and rouse Visnu from His sleep. During the time of performing Homa whatever ghee will fall outside the Homa-Kund (the sacrificial pit) will fall to your share; so be quick and do this. Sûta said:&#8211; Thus ordered by Brahmâ, the Vamrî insect soon ate away the fore end of the bow that rested on the ground. Immediately the string gave way and the bow went up; the other end became free and a terrible sound took place. The Devas bcame afraid; the whole universe got agitated; the earth trembled. The sea became swollen; the aquatic animals became startled; violent wind blew; the mountains shook; ominous meteors fell. The quarters assumed a terrific aspect; the Sun went down the horizon. In that time of distress the Devas became anxious what evil might come down. O ascetics! while the Devas were thus cogitating, the head with crown on it of the Devadeva Visnu vanished away ; no body knew where it fell. When the awful darkness disappeared, Brahmâ and Mahâdeva saw the disfigured body of Visnu with its head off. Seeing that headless figure of Visnu they were greatly surprised; they were drowned in the ocean of cares and, overwhelmed with grief, began to weep aloud…&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">INDRA VS ARJUNA</span></strong></p>
<p>Although Arjuna wasn&#8217;t a god but his adviser was Krishna so the story can be mentioned here. Actually, it was not a battle between Arjun and Indra but between Arjuna and Ashwasena but Indra decided to fight noticing that his friend&#8217;s son Ashwasena was going to get killed by Arjuna,</p>
<p>Mahabharata Adi Parva 1.229 &#8220;But Aswasena, the mighty son of Takshaka, was there. He made great efforts to escape from that fire; but confined by Arjuna&#8217;s shafts he succeeded not in finding a way. It was then that his mother, the daughter of a snake, determined to save him by swallowing him first. His mother first swallowed his head and then was swallowing his tail. And desirous of saving her son, the sea-snake rose (up from the earth) while still employed in swallowing her son&#8217;s tail. But Arjuna as soon as he beheld her escaping, severed her head from her body by means of a sharp and keen-edged arrow. Indra saw all this, and desiring to save his friend&#8217;s son, the wielder of the thunderbolt, by raising a violent wind, deprived Arjuna of consciousness.&#8221; Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">INDRA VS SAGARA&#8217;S SONS</span></strong></p>
<p>Indra uses his tactics to kill the sons of king Sagara,</p>
<p>As per the story mentioned in Srimad Bhagavatam 9.8. There was a king named Sagara who was the ancestor of Hindu god Ram. He had 60,000 sons. Instructed by sage Aurva, King Sagara performed Ashvamedha sacrifice but Indra stole the horse and left it in sage Kapila&#8217;s Ashram. Indra made Sagara&#8217;s sons lose their intelligence and disrespected the sage. As the sage was meditating and as soon as he opened his eyes the sons of Sagara were burned with the fire emanating from their own bodies</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">INDRA VS VISHWARUPA</span></strong></p>
<p>This is another version of Indra killing Vishwarupa. Geeta Kasturi summarizes the story as,</p>
<p>&#8220;The story goes that rishi Vishvarupa was very fond of his mother. She was from the family of asuras. Prompted by the affection for her, he used to give a portion of the sacrificial oblations secretly to the asuras. Indra detected the treachery of the rishi and cut off the three heads of Vishvarupa.&#8221;</p>
<p>This story iss mentioned in Srimad Bhagavatam (Bhagavad Purana) and Devi Bhagavatam,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 6.9.4 &#8220;Indra, the king of gods, noticed his contempt and faithlessness to gods and his sham righteousness. Being afraid (lest Asuras should be powerful) he immediately cut down (Visvarupa&#8217;s) heads in wrath.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Srimad Devi Bhagavaram 3.12.25 verses says that Vishwarupa would utter Mantras beneficial to gods when they were present and in the absence of gods he would pray for the welfare of Daityas.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">INDRA VS MUNI DADHYAM</span></strong></p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 7.36.28. “O Best of Mountains! It is very difficult to acquire Brahma Jñâna. Hear a story. A Muni named Dadhyam of Atharvana family went to Indra and prayed to him to give Brahma Jñâna. Indra said: &#8220;I would give you Brahma-Jñâna, but if you impart it to any other body, I would sever your head.&#8221; Dadhyarna agreed to this and Indra gave him the Brahma-Jñâna. After a few days, the two As&#8217;vins came to the Muni and prayed for Brahma Vidyâ, The Muni said:&#8211; &#8220;If I give you the Brahma-Vidyi, Indra, will cut off my head.&#8221; Hearing this the two As&#8217;vins said:&#8211; &#8220;We will cut your head and keep it elsewhere and we will attach the head of a horse to your body. Instruct us with the mouth of this horse and when Indra will cut off your this mouth, we will replace your former head.&#8221; When they said so, the Muni gave them the Brahma-Vidyâ. Indra cut off his head by his thunderbolt. When the horse-head of the Muni was cut off, the two physicians of the Devas replaced his original head. This is widely known in all the Vedas.” Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">VASHISHTHA VS VISHWAMITRA</span></strong></p>
<p>Vishwamitra came to the hermitage of sage Vashishtha. Vashishtha had a genie of the lamp-like cow perhaps known as Kamdhenu who would grant all desires. Vishwamitra became very excited about the cow so he wanted to obtain it and he asked Vasishtha for it and said that in return he would give him many cows. But Vasishtha refused so Vishwamitra became angry and wanted to take it away by force. Vishwamitra&#8217;s sons were killed by Vashistha and to avenge it Vishwamitra started performing austerities in the forest in order to obtain a boon from Shiva. Vrishadwaja (appellation of Shiva) decided to bestow a boon. Vishwamitra asks him to confer the science of archery with all its mysteries and mantras as well as its virtues and also weapons. Then Vishvamitra goes to Vasishtha&#8217;s hermitage and attacks him</p>
<p>Ramayana of Valmiki, Bala Kanda 1.55.5-7 &#8220;And seeing the army annihilated by the high-souled Vasishtha, the hundred sons of Vicwamitra, equipped with various weapons, rushed in high ire against that best of mantra-reciting ones. Thereupon, uttering a roar, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">that might ascetic consumed them quite. And in a moment, Vicwamitra&#8217;s sons together with horse and car and foot were reduced to ashes by the high-souled Vasishtha</span>.&#8221; Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Vishwamitra instigated Rakshasas to kill Vashishtha&#8217;s son and Vashishtha&#8217;s sons were also killed. And in grief, Vashishtha&#8217;s tried to commit suicide by jumping from a mountain but he fell on a heap of cotton, then he torched the forest and entered it but it didn&#8217;t burn him and then he tied a weight to his neck and drowned himself in the waters but even that didn&#8217;t kill him. He came to know that his daughter in law is pregnant so he gave up the idea of committing suicide,</p>
<p>Mahabharata Adi Parva 1.178.41-49 &#8220;Beholding Saktri thus slain and devoured, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Viswamitra repeatedly urged that Rakshasa (who was within the monarch) against the other sons of Vasishtha. Like a wrathful lion devouring small animals, that Rakshasa soon devoured the other sons of the illustrious Vasishtha that were junior to Saktri in age</span>. But Vasishtha, learning that all his sons had been caused to be slain by Viswamitra, patiently bore his grief like the great mountain that bears the earth. That best of Munis, that foremost of intelligent men, was resolved rather to sacrifice his own life than exterminate (in anger) the race of Kusikas. The illustrious Rishi threw himself down from the summit of Meru, but he descended on the stony ground as though on a heap of cotton. And, O son of Pandu, when the illustrious one found that death did not result from that fall, he kindled a huge fire in the forest and entered it with alacrity. But that fire, though burning brightly, consumed him not. O slayer of foes, that blazing fire seemed to him cool. Then the great Muni under the influence of grief, beholding the sea, tied a stony weight to his neck and threw himself into its waters. But the waves soon cast him ashore. At last when that Brahmana of rigid vows succeeded not in killing himself by any means, he returned, in distress of heart, to his asylum.&#8221; Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>

<p>Rig Veda 4.30.8-11 talks about Indra killing Usha and Rig Veda 4.18.12 talks about Indra killing his father. Although these verses are considered to be allegorical but they are still worth reading.</p>

<h2><a id="sins-hell"></a>Sins leading to hell</h2>
<p>Hinduism too has the concept of heaven and hell but unlike Abrahamic religions, Hinduism has temporary heaven and hell. The reason I am mentioning it here is because it refutes the claim of deceitful Hindus on the internet who claims that &#8216;You are free to do anything, you will not be put into hell for doing this or that thing&#8217;. Hinduism lists several sins that could lead one to hell, I am mentioning some of them like not worshiping Shivling leads one to hell, who doesn’t observe Yajnas, those who don’t follow the path laid down by Vedas, etc.,</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Vidyeshvara Samhita 1, chapter 19, verse 26 &#8220;If a brahmin does not worship the earthen phallic image he shall fall in the terrible hell with a terrible trident pierced through his body.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Krishna Janma Khanda 75.43-52 &#8220;&#8230;A fool who slanders Siva, Durga, Ganes&#8217;a, the Sun, a Brahmin, a Vaisnava and Visnu goes to the hell called the great Raurava. A person who does not maintain his parents, chaste wife, spiritual guide, and widowed sister, and widowed daughter goes to hell. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">If a Ksatriya, Vais&#8217;ya or Sudra male has no faith in Hari or a Brahmin and if a youthful woman has no faith in her husband, then these wretches undoubtedly suffer the torments of hell</span>&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Rajendra Nath Sen</p>
<p>Skanda Purana III.ii.18.156-7 &#8220;She creates obstacles for a foolish one who does not worship. He will have to witness death of the couple, destruction of wealth, great fear, pain, sickness and incidents of arson. For this reason, O Brahmanas, an intelligent devotee should worship Matangi.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 9.35.1-44 &#8220;…<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">If any Brâhmana does not worship with devotion the phallic emblem of S&#8217;iva, he goes to the dreadful S&#8217;ûlaprota Kunda for that heinous sin</span>. He remains there for one hundred years; then he becomes a quadruped animal for seven births and again he becomes born a Devala Brâhmin for seven births when he becomes freed.&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Narada Purana I.15.130b-131a &#8220;Those who have ceased to perform the rites and the yajnas for Pitrs (manes) and Devas, those who stay outside the part of the Vedas, are notorious as heretics. They undergo all sorts of tortures.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Narada Purana I.15.89 &#8220;Those who have abandoned the five great sacrifices go to the hell Lalabhaksa. One who abandons worship goes to the hell Raurava. [96b-97] The person who abandons his religious duties is called a heretic by learned men. He and a person who associates with him are great sinners. They fall into hells in a serial order, in the course of thousand and millions of kalpas.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Skanda Purana II.iv.6.26 &#8220;Those foolish persons who revile noble-souled Vaisnavas, fall into hell named Maharaurava along with their manes.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana: Lalit-Mahatmya 33.84-86 &#8220;The glorious Maharudra who holds the trident is served by other Rudras, the chief among whom is Hiranyabahu. He is accompanied by those Rudranis too. With the tip of his trident, he pierces those persons who have neglected visiting Lalita, who are haughty, and who are repoached by elderly people. He burns them by means of fierce fires originating from his eyes. He destroys their wives, children and servants, He is the great hero who obediently carries out the behest of Lalitha.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Brahma Purana 106.33-38-41 &#8220;Yama&#8217;s servants said: You have not performed sacrifices at the proper time. You have not offered gifts to the brahmins. Moreover, when something was offered to brahmins you had actively prevented it. The time for the reaping of the fruits of that sin has arrived, O base men, your assets were not burnt by fire nor did they perish in water. They had not been seized by kings or robbers. Where are they now? Why were they not handed over to brahmins&#8230;On hearing the words of Yama&#8217;s servants they lose their taste therein. They are afflicted by hunger and thirst (all the more). Thereafter they are tortured by the servants of Yama with terrible weapons. The ruthless emissaries of Yama attack them from the rear with iron clubs, iron-rods, javelins, tomaras, pattisas, bhindipalas and parighas. They are bit and pierced by arrows, axes and maces. The sinners are attacked from the front by lions, tigers etc. and are eaten up by them.&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Varaha Purana 134.61-64 &#8220;Varaha said: O Earth, I shall tell you what happens to the man who offers forbidden flower for me&#8230;Fools alone dare to offer me like this and they fall into the hell called Raurava, and then, because of their ignorance, undergo a lot of suffering. They remain as monkeys for ten years, cats for thirteen years.&#8221; Tr. Venkitasubramonia Iyer</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Uma Samhita 5.10.19-20 &#8220;If men, out of greed, pluck and sniff at flowers of the temple parks, or wear them on their heads, their heads are covered with iron spikes and their noses are filled with plenty of acid and other things.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Linga Purana Section II.18.60-62 &#8220;&#8230;The lord said thus:-&#8216;O excellent-faced lady, a person who applies Bhasman is on a par with my son Ganesa. What is repugnant to them should be eschewed. A householder who is devoid of Brahman (Vedic knowledge) and who does not wear the caste mark Tripundra falls into the depths of hell. All his holy rites of worship, charitable gifts and holy ablutions are in vain like the Homa performed in the ashes.&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Vayu Purana Section II.21.59-61 &#8220;Brhaspati said: The man who after hearing this explanation of the procedure of Sraddhas, becomes malicious, is an atheist enveloped in darkness. He will drown himself in the terrible hell. He who has perfectly controlled his mind, finds all his great ailments terminated. He who is not mindful of the Asramas (stages of life) stated in the Vedas attains the Kumbhika hell. He attains the status of a thief and gets his tongue cut. Those who censure Yoga become lumps of clay in the ocean and decay as long as earth exists. Hence, this is the Dharma (virtue) intended in the Sraddha that it should be performed by a man with faith (in it.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare, edited by G.P. Bhatt</p>
<p>Padma Purana IV.1.8-13 &#8220;&#8230;For a man who would create an obstacle in the act of the narration of Visnu&#8217;s account, there is no escape from hell for a hundred period of Manu. For those who having hear the account (as narrated) in the Puranas, censure or scoff at it, always have the very afflicting hells on their hands (i.e. waiting for them)&#8230;&#8221; Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p>Shiva Purana Vayaviyasamhita 6, Section II, 41.38 &#8220;This excellent gem of Sivapurana, should not be mentioned to those who do not know the Vedas, nor should it be imparted to a disciple who is not a devotee of Siva nor to an atheist. If it is imparted to these out of delusion it yields hell.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana 2.3.19.57b-58a &#8220;After hearing these rules and regulations regarding Sraddha, if any man does not perform it, he is an atheist and he shall fall into the terrible hell enveloped in darkness.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Kurma Purana II.24.7 &#8220;Either due to atheistic feelings or due to lethargy, if anyone does not wish to maintain sacrificial fires, nor does he perform Yajnas, he falls into many hells.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Skanda Purana III.iii.22.39-41 &#8220;Men who censure a man conversant with the Puranas or the story that dispels sins, become dogs in a hundred births. The base men who talk and interrupt while the (Purana) story is progressing, will be born as donkeys first and then as chameleons.

<h3><a id="hinduism-salvation"></a>Hinduism is the only way to salvation</h3>
<p>Contrary to the much hype by Hindus. One should worship a Deva, believe in the Vedas, and sacrifice to the gods in order to attain salvation, if he doesn&#8217;t then he keeps taking rebirth and is also put in hell in between the cycles of birth as punishment. Attaining heaven is the main aim of Abrahamic religions but attaining salvation is the main aim of Hinduism. It&#8217;s mentioned in the Vedas,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 9.73.9 &#8220;The thread of the cosmic sacrifice, spread over the ultraphychic filter, extends as if, by its act up to the tip of venerable Lord&#8217;s tongue; the prudent devotees attain it; <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">but he who is incompetent and faithless shall sink into the pit of hell</span>, even whilst he is in this world.&#8221; Tr. Svami Satya Prakash Saraswati</p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.164.39 &#8220;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">They are atheists and of weak intellect, and continually remain sunk in the depths of misery and pain who do not believe in, know</span>, and commune with, Him who is Resplendent, All-glorious, All-Holy, All-knowledge, sustainer of the sun, the earth and other planets, Who pervades all like ether, is the Lord of all and is above all devatas. It is by the knowledge and contemplation of God alone that all men attain true happiness.&#8221; Tr. Dr. Chiranjiva Bhardwaja, as mentioned in the book Satyarth Prakash, By Swami Dayanand Saraswati, Ch 7, page 203.</p>
<p>Krishna said,</p>
<p>Gita 9.3 &#8220;Those who are not faithful in this devotional service cannot attain Me, O conqueror of enemies. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Therefore they return to the path of birth and death in this material world</span>.&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 11.21.1 &#8220;The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Those who give up these methods for achieving Me</span>, which consist of devotional service, analytic philosophy and regulated execution of prescribed duties, and instead, being moved by the material senses, cultivate insignificant sense gratification, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">certainly undergo the continual cycle of material existence</span>.&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>He also said,</p>
<p>Gita 8.11-13 &#8220;Persons who are learned in the Vedas, who utter oṁ-kāra, and who are great sages in the renounced order enter into Brahman. Desiring such perfection, one practices celibacy. I shall now brieﬂy explain to you this process by which one may attain salvation. The yogic situation is that of detachment from all sensual engagements. Closing all the doors of the senses and ﬁxing the mind on the heart and the life air at the top of the head, one establishes himself in yoga. After being situated in this yoga practice and vibrating the sacred syllable oṁ, the supreme combination of letters, if one thinks of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and quits his body, he will certainly reach the spiritual planets.&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Gita 4.40 &#8220;The ignorant fool, one without faith in Vedic scriptures, and one afflicted by inner doubt and uncertainty is ruined and for one afflicted by doubt and uncertainty there is no happiness in this world nor the next.&#8221;</p>
<p>Brahma Purana 65.71-73 &#8220;Thus O brahmins is the greatest abode of Visnu endowed with all enjoyable pleasures and attributes. It is conducive to the pleasures of everyone. It is holy and full of mysteries. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Atheists and profligates do not go there</span>. Nor do the following go there viz.-the ungrateful and those who are of uncontrollable sense-organs. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The devotees of Visnu who worship Vasudeva the preceptor of the universe with devotion, go to the world of Visnu</span>.&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Skanda Purana II.ii.26.28-33 &#8220;&#8230;One who installs the idol of Hari in accordance with the injunctions in the Mansion does not get involved in the bondage of physical bodies. He goes to the great region of Visnu.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Narada Purana I.41.106 &#8220;It is only through the repetition of the names of Hari that redemption is attained by the people who commit sins, who are beyond the pale of Vedic path and who are wanting in mental purity.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 7.1.32 &#8220;Somehow or other, one must consider the form of Kṛṣṇa very seriously. Then, by one of the five different processes mentioned above, one can return home, back to Godhead. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Atheists like King Vena, however, being unable to think of Kṛṣṇa&#8217;s form in any of these five ways, cannot attain salvation</span>. Therefore, one must somehow think of Kṛṣṇa, whether in a friendly way or inimically.&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 5.26.3 &#8220;…And for one who acts impiously and ignorantly because of atheism, the resultant hellish life is the worst. Because of ignorance, every living entity has been carried by various desires into thousands of different hellish planets since time immemorial. I shall try to describe them as far as possible.&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagvatam 6.1.40 &#8220;The Yamadūtas replied: That which is prescribed in the Vedas constitutes dharma, the religious principles, and the opposite of that is irreligion. The Vedas are directly the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Nārāyaṇa, and are self-born. This we have heard from Yamarāja.&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Srimad Devi Bhagavatam 6.6.29-32. &#8220;The Munis said:&#8211; &#8220;O King! All the creatures certainly enjoy the fruits of their Karmas, whether good or bad; how then, can persons, of perverted intellect, obtain peace when they do mischief to others. The treacherous persons certainly go to hell and suffer miseries always. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The slayers of Brâhmanas and the drunkards may get liberation; but never the faithless</span> and those who go against their friends get off free; <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">these will have to suffer undoubtedly in the hells</span>.&#8221; Tr.

<p>Srimad Devi Bhagavatam 6.11.57-65. &#8220;Vyâsa said:&#8211; O King! There is only one path and none other which can save a man from the sin of this Kâlî; and that is this:&#8211; The Jîvas must meditate on the lotus-feet of the Highest Devî for the purification of all their faults and sins. O King! There is so much strength in Her sin-destroying Name, that the amount of sin in this world falls much less in proportion to that. Where, then, is the cause of fear? Her Name, uttered at random, even in an unconscious state, bestows so much unspeakable results that even Hari, Hara and others have not the capacity to know that.&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>

<h2><a id="atheism"></a>Atheism</h2>
<p>This is a very important topic for discussion. Hindus claim that you can even be an atheist and attain salvation. I don&#8217;t really know what is the basis of this claim. They should furnish references showing that even an atheist who doesn&#8217;t believe in god and Veda, who never sacrificed for Devas or worshipped them can go to heaven temporarily and attain salvation. I am not challenging them but asking for educational purposes. Buddhism and Jainism are condemned in Hindu scriptures because of their atheistic doctrines then how can Hindus claim that you can be an atheist? Why do Hindu scriptures lay stress on the atheistic doctrines of Buddhism and Jainism while condemning them and rejecting them as false religions? Now they cite Mimamsa philosophy to support their argument, such atheistic doctrines are later entrants to Hinduism probably to counter Buddhism. Do they even know what Mimamsa is? Mimamsa has both theistic and atheistic doctrines, it rejects a personal god but believes in the authority of the Vedas. Now you tell me, is there any atheist on the face of this earth who claims the Vedas to be authoritative? Atheism is strongly condemned in Hindu scriptures, Vedas even call for the death of godless atheists. Buddha is criticized for rejecting the Vedas so how can Hindus claim this? If they want to prove that Atheists can attain salvation then they should furnish references showing that a man who doesn&#8217;t believe in god, in Vedas, in Brahmins, who doesn&#8217;t worship and who doesn&#8217;t sacrifice can attain salvation. That&#8217;s it. No need for further discussion. Hindu scholars have also translated the word Nastika as an infidel. Nastika in Sanskrit is literally translated as Atheist. But in Vedic (Hindu scriptures) terminology an atheist doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean the one who doesn&#8217;t believe in god, but it has several meanings like a non-Hindu is also considered to be an atheist, a censurer of Vedas is also considered an atheist, etc, let me present some sources,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 9.13.9 “O Pavamamas, driving off the godless, looking on the light, Sit in the place of sacrifice.” Tr. Ralph. T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>Rig Veda 7.6.3 “The foolish, faithless, rudely-speaking niggards, without belief or sacrifice or worship,— Far far sway hath Agni chased those Dasytis, and, in the cast, hath turned the godless westward.” Tr. Ralph. T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>Kurma Purana II.24.10 &#8220;He who is one who maintains sacrificial fires but does not wish to perform sacrifice to the lord by means of meditation, is a confused person. He should not be conversed with. What more (need be said) that man is an atheist.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Varaha Purana 58.5-6 &#8220;Visnu should be considered as Rudra and Laksmi as Gauri. He who speaks of difference between them is lowly (Adhama) and should be considered an atheist outside the field of dharma.&#8221; Tr. Venkitasubramonia Iyer, J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 4.2.30 &#8220;Bhṛgu Muni continued: Since you blaspheme the Vedas and the brāhmaṇas, who are followers of the Vedic principles, it is understood that you have already taken shelter of the doctrine of atheism.&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>&#8220;The &#8216;infidel&#8217; is one who has no religion, his son is &#8216;the son of an infidel&#8217;. <strong>Vijnanesvara in Mitakshara on Yajnavalkya Smriti verse 244</strong></p>
<p>Swami Prabhupada wrote, &#8220;…An atheist is called a demon, and it is a fact that even a person born of good parents can turn into a demon by bad association…&#8221; <strong>Swami Prabhupada on Srimad Bhagavatam 3.3.6</strong><br />

<p>Swami Prabhupada also wrote, &#8220;Bhṛgu Muni, in cursing Nandīśvara, said that not only would they be degraded as atheists because of this curse, but they had already fallen to the standard of atheism because they had blasphemed the Vedas, which are the source of human civilization. Human civilization is based on the qualitative divisions of social order, namely the intelligent class, the martial class, the productive class and the laborer class. The Vedas provide the right direction for advancing in spiritual cultivation and economic development and regulating the principle of sense gratification, so that ultimately one may be liberated from material contamination to his real state of spiritual identification (ahaṁ brahmāsmi). As long as one is in the contamination of material existence, one changes bodies from the aquatics up to the position of Brahmā, but the human form of life is the highest perfectional life in the material world. The Vedas give directions by which to elevate oneself in the next life. The Vedas are the mother for such instructions, and the brāhmaṇas, or persons who are in knowledge of the Vedas, are the father. Thus if one blasphemes the Vedas and brāhmaṇas, naturally one goes down to the status of atheism. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The exact word used in Sanskrit is nāstika, which refers to one who does not believe in the Vedas but manufactures some concocted system of religion</span>…&#8221; <strong>Swami Prabhupada on Srimad Bhagavatam 4.2.30 </strong>http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_4.2.30</p>
<p><strong>He also wrote</strong>, &#8220;The Buddhists are called atheists because they have no respect for the Vedas, but those who defy the Vedic conclusions, as above mentioned, under the pretense of being followers of the Vedas, are verily more dangerous than the Buddhists.&#8221; <a href="http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_Introduction" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_Introduction<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 4.2.30 &#8220;By blaspheming the principles of the Vedas, which are the pure and supreme path of the saintly persons, certainly you followers of Bhūtapati, Lord Śiva, will descend to the standard of atheism without a doubt.&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>

<h3><a id="punishment-atheists"></a>Punishment for Atheists</h3>
<p>Skanda Purana V.iii.227.1-10 &#8220;[Sri Markandeya said]&#8230;Persons who have no faith, those who are atheists fall into the terrible Naraka. So said Paramesvara&#8230;&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>People who commit these sins are considered criminals</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti 37.44. Reviling the Veda; [30-31] Studying irreligious books; Atheism;</p>
<p>Vamana Purana 40.35-36 &#8220;Therefore Dharma is not to be shunned, for Dharma is the supreme goal. Men devoid of Dharma go to the wide Raurava hell. Dharma, they say, enables a safe passage in heaven and here and Adharma leads to downfall in this world and the next.&#8221; Tr. Anand Swarup Gupta</p>
<p>Narada Purana I.15.79-80 &#8220;I shall tell you the sufferings of the atheists who turn their faces away from Hara and Hari. They will be compelled to eat salt for ten million years. Then, they are scorched and fried in red hot sand in Raurava hell. These men of sinful acts remain in that hell for the period of a Kalpa. O ruler of men, in other hells also (they are tortured) like this.&#8221;  Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 11.5.15 &#8220;These godless people hate Lord Hari-their very indwelling self who abides in the bodies of others as well (as their Soul); and fixing their attachment to their mortal body and its relatives (wives, sons, etc.), they fall down deep into hell.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Kurma Purana II.19.31-32 &#8220;If any Brahmana does not practise his duty either due to atheism or due to lethargy, he falls into the terrible hells and is reborn as a crow. There is no other way for liberation excepting performance of the duties of one&#8217;s own Asrama (stage of life). Hence one should perform the holy rites for the satisfaction of Paramesthin (god Brahma).&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 3.17.5-7 “PARÁŚARA.&#8211;The Rig, Yajur, and Sáma Vedas constitute the triple covering of the several castes, and the sinner who throws this off is said to be naked (or apostate). The three Vedas are the raiment of all the orders of men, and when that is discarded they are left bare. On this subject hear what I heard my grandfather, the pious Vaśisht́ha, relate to the magnanimous Bhíshma.” Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Skanda Purana V.ii.67.23-31 &#8220;&#8230;[Isvara said] a voice issued from the firmament as uttered by me in compassion: &#8216;Do not say anything out of the way. The immutable Srutis should not be censured. The Puranas spoken by Brahma, the creator of the worlds, cannot be otherwise. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The atheists who censure the Puranas and Dharmasastras fall into the terrible hell and remain there till all living beings are annihilated</span>.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Narasima Purana 53.15-16 &#8220;&#8230;I salute god Kesava the supreme intuitive, who protects the godly persons who are religion abiding by killing the wicked and atheists through his incarnation in varied forms and in every age&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Joshi K.L. Shastri and Bindiya Trivedi</p>
<p>Atheists are condemned in Hindu scriptures,</p>
<p>Brahma Purana 46.60-61 &#8220;This hymn is conducive to wealth. It dispels sins. It is auspicious. It bestows worldly pleasures and salvation. It is a rare esoteric secret. It is sacred. It should not be imparted to any one and everyone. It should not be imparted to an atheist, a fool, an ungrateful person, an arrogant or to one of wicked intellect. It should never be handed over to a knave.&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Brahma Purana 60.16 &#8220;O excellent Brahmins, the knowledge of the purana should not be imparted to an atheist&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Kurma Purana II.26.67 &#8220;A person who knows Dharma should not offer even water to an atheist or a heretic or to a sceptic or to a person who does not know the Vedas.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Brahmanda purana 2.3.14.43 &#8220;One shall discard the very sight of these viz-the Brahman slayer, the ungrateful one, the atheist, the defiled of the preceptor&#8217;s bed, the robber and the ruthless person.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Kurma Purana II.21.43-44 &#8220;The following are defilers of rows:- an ungrateful person, a back-biter, a ruthless person, an atheist, person who censures the Vedas, a person injuring friends and a cheat. All these should not be fed (in a Sraddha). They cannot be given any gift in holy rites&#8230;&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Brahma Purana 137.52-53 &#8220;Thus, O excellent sages, the great Liberation, the essences, has been recounted by me. On realising it one does not return. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">It should not be imparted to an atheist or to a person who is not a devotee</span>. O brahmins, it should not be imparted to an evil-minded person nor to a person who has no faith and who is averse to everything good.&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>

<p>Rig Veda 1.33.4 &#8220;&#8230;As atheistic un-righteous persons who revile God are ruined by His Powers or germs are destroyed by the rays of the sun, in the same manner, you should endeavour to put an end to the lives of those wicked persons who forcibly take away and enjoy other&#8217;s articles and who do not perform Yajnas and other noble deeds who are utterly selfish.&#8221; Tr. Acharya Dharma Deva Vidya Martanda</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t use some of these Vedic verses in the article Killing infidels in Vedas. Just look at what Muni Ved Vyasa says in Mahabharata,</p>
<p>Mahabharata Santi Parva 12.34-35 &#8220;[Vyasa said] I shall now mention other acts that men should not do, viz., acts that are interdicted by both the world and the Vedas. Listen to me with concentrated attention. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The rejection of one&#8217;s own creed, the practice of other people&#8217;s creed</span>, assisting at the sacrifice or the religious rites of one that is not worthy of such assistance…<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">these all have been pronounced by persons conversant with duty to be acts that no one should do</span>.&#8221; Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Other Mahabharata verses show how infidels are roasted in hell,</p>
<p>Mahabharata, Santi Parva 12.181.4-5 &#8220;Those that are virtuous in their acts, and possessed of faith, and that have their senses under control, become born as affluent men and repeatedly sport in festivities and heaven and happiness. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Unbelievers, with their arms manacled, are sent to regions rendered inaccessible by carnivorous beasts and elephants and full of terrors in consequence of snakes and robbers</span>. What more need be said of them?&#8221; Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Mahabharata, Santi Parva 12.323 &#8220;They that are unbelievers have to pass, with groping hands, through regions infested by beasts of prey and elephants and pathless tracts teeming with snakes and robbers and other causes of fear. What more need be said of these?&#8221; Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 3.9.4 &#8220;&#8230;we offer obeisance to you (a gracious) Lord who is spurned by the atheists (like Mimamsakas, Sankhyas etc.) and believers in false logic and who therefore deserve (stay in) Hell.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Buddhists beware you will go</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;">to hell</span></strong>,</p>
<p>Srimad Devi Bhagavatam 11.1.25-37 &#8220;…<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Whatever goes clearly against the Vedas can in no way be accepted as a proof. In matters concerning Dharma, the Vedas is the Sole Proof</span>. Therefore that which is not against the Vedas can be taken as proof; otherwise not. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Whoever acts Dharma according to other proofs than what is ordained in the Vedas, goes to the hell in the abode of Yama to get his lesson</span>. So the Dharma that is by all means to be accepted as such, is what is stated in the Vedas. The Smritis, the Purâ<span style="text-decoration: underline;">n</span>as, or the Tantra S&#8217;âstras can be taken also as authoritative when they are not conflicting to Vedas. Any other S&#8217;âstras can be taken as authoritative when it is fundamentally coincident with the Vedas. Else it can never be accepted. Those who do injury to others even by the blade of a Kus&#8217;a grass used as a weapon, go to hell with their heads downwards and their feet upwards. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Those that follow their own sweet free will, that take up any sort of dress (e. g. Bauddhas)</span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">those that follow the philosophical doctrines called Pâs&#8217;upatas, and the other hermits and saints and persons that take up other vows contrary to the religions of the Vedas, for example, the Vaikhânasa followers, those who brand their bodies by the hot Mudrâs, at the places of pilgrimages, e. g. Dvârkâ, etc., </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">they go to hell with their bodies scorched by red hot brands (Tapta Mudrâs)</span>. So persons should act according to the excellent religions commanded by the Vedas…&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Padma Purana VI.253.36-39 &#8220;That devotee of Visnu, who does not practise the acts prescribed in the Srutis and Smrtis, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">becomes a heretic, and would stay in the Raurava hell</span>. Therefore, a man should offer to the lord of the world a worship fit for his caste&#8230;&#8221; Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p>Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Krishna Janma Khanda 75.62-77 &#8220;&#8230;A Brahmin who does not worship Visnu is like a Chandal; and one who adopts the tenets of Bama (name of Gouri, Laksmi or Saraswati) goes to hell&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Rajendra Nath Sen</p>
<p>Narada Purana, Uttarabhaga 21.38 &#8220;These persons are to be punished and given capital punishment- he who eschews Visnu the foremost among the gods and worships any other deity&#8230;&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Skanda Purana VII.I.3.144 &#8220;Thus the foolish ones will say, others will laugh. The non-beleivers, the people destined to fall into hell, get their minds overwhelmed by sins. At the advent of Kali Age, they will never gain Siddhi.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Krisna Janma Khanda 75.73-82 &#8220;&#8230;Even the worship of Siva&#8217;s male organ for one time after having constructed it with clay or cow dung and sand secures dwelling in heaven for a hundred ages: and whoever worships a hundred such organs obtains the desired meed; and whoever worships a hundred thousand such organs attains the position of S&#8217;iva, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">but one who does not worship S&#8217;va goes to hell. Those who slander or calumniate the venerable, and most lovely S&#8217;iva dwell in hell as long as Brahma exists and suffer endless torments</span>.&#8221; Tr. Rajendra Nath Sen.</p>
<p>Linga Purana Section II.11.35-37 &#8220;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">If people forsake Linga and begin to worship other deities they will go to the Raurava hell along with the king</span>, their ruler. If a king ceases to be a devotee of Siva and becomes attached to other Devas, it is like the behaviour of a young woman who discarding her husband revels among her paramours.&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Kurma Purana I.12.259-61 &#8220;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The hells such as Tamisra and others were created beneath the earth by god Brahma for those people who do not practise the duties prescribed in my Dharma</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">There is no scripture other than the Vedas which lays down what is Dharma</span>. A person who takes delight in other things (not sanctioned by the Vedas), should not even talked to by twice-born persons viz. Brahmanas, Ksatriyas and Vaisyas. Those various scriptures which are contrary to Srutis and Smrtis seen in this world, are based on Tamo-guna or ignorance. Belief in them or practising in accordance with them is a Tamasa activity.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Padma Purana V.96.49b-76a &#8220;Yama said: Those men who are averse to religion through their deeds mind and words, and <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">who are without (i.e. who do not have) devotion to Visnu, go to hell</span>. Those men who look upon Brahma, Sankara and Visnu as different (from one another), and who are detached from knowledge about Visnu, go to hell&#8230;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">A man who worships what should not be worshipped, and does not worship what should be worshipped, and is disinterested in the knowledge about Visnu, suffers in many hells</span>&#8230;Those who, when proper time has come, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">do not devoutly offer sraddha through atheism or greed or delusion are roasted in hell&#8230;and who is inclined to atheism, would live in the abode of hell</span>&#8230;Those who, even after seeing the door of (the temple of) the lord or (even after hearing) his name or the sacred text (even after seeing) his attendants, do not salute etc. become the residents of hell&#8230;.&#8221; Tr.

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Who becomes an infidel?</span></strong></p>
<p>As you may know, whatever we are today is because of the deeds of our past lives as per Hinduism. A person is born as a Shudra or a Chandala because he committed theft in his previous life etc. So what makes one non-Hindu?</p>
<p>Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Krishna Janma Khanda 85.159-169 &#8220;&#8230;One the days of the five important festivals, a man must abstain from woman, oil, fish and flesh. The great fool who violates this rule must go to the hell called &#8216;the tooth of thunder or adamant.&#8217; <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">That sinner after having lived there in great pain turns into an infidel for seven births</span> and a chandal for seven births. <span style="color: #ff0000;">A wretch who does not bow to a Brahmin or an idol remains impure all his life and is afterwards born as an infidel</span>.&#8221; Tr.

<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 5.26.14-15 &#8220;He who bears malice towards his parents, Brahmanas and the Vedas is hurled into the hell called Kalasutra. It is a plain of a copper-sheet ten thousand Yojanas in area. The sheet of copper is heated by fire from below and the Sun from above&#8230;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">They (servants of Yama) throw in the hell called Arispatravana (a forest of trees with sword-like leaves) a person who, while in this world, abandons his Vedic way of life even when there was no calamity and embraces a heretic sect. They strike him with a whip. And while he runs hither and thither (to avoid whipping), all the limbs of his body are cut down by the two-edged sword-like leaves of the palm trees thereof</span>. Crying with exceuciating pain, &#8216;Alas! I am killed&#8217;, he falls in a swoon at every step.

<p><strong>Manmath Nath Dutt translates it as</strong> &#8220;&#8230;He that, when no danger threatens, forsakes the path of the Veda and follows that of a heretic, is thrown by the servants of Yama into the hell named Asipatravana, and is lashed by them. The sinner, sore afflicted, rusheth about hither and thither. The leaves of the palmyra palm growing in the wood have two sharp edges like that of swords, and these teat his body grievously. Then the wreth, suffering greatly, exclaims: &#8216;Ah! I am undone&#8217;; and stumbles at every step on account of the severe torment he undegoes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Srimad Devi Bhagavatam 8.22.2-52 &#8220;…The man who, getting even a trifling wealth and food-stuff, does not perform the five Mahâ Yajñâs and gives not a share of that to the Devas and feeds his own belly with that like a crow, is taken by the ferocious Yamadûtas to the worst Krimibhojana Naraka for his sinful deeds. This hell is one lakh Yoyanas wide and is the reservoir of worms. It causes terror to the inhabitants of the hell. That sinner assumes the form of an insect and is eaten up on return by the insects and thus passes his time there. When a man does not give any share to the Atithis or the guests and does not offer oblations to the Fire and eats his food, he, too, goes to the above hell…<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">He who transgresses the path of the Vedas in times other than those of calamity and danger and follows other paths even to a trifling distance, that sinner is taken by Yamadûtas to Asipatra Kânana and there whipped severely. Not being able to bear that, he runs wildly to and fro and is pierced by the sharp edged Asi leaves on both his sides. His whole body being cut asunder</span>, he cries &#8220;Oh!

<p>There are some examples where demons devoted to Devas were killed soon after they left the Vedic religion and embraced other religions like Buddhism and Jainism.

<p>Matysa Purana 24.47-49 &#8220;&#8230;<span style="color: #ff0000;">Brihaspati then went and deluded the other sons of Raji with </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">false philosophy and established the Jina religion</span> opposed to the Vedas, though himself a knower of the Vedas and <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Indra on finding the sons of Brihaspati propagating a religion different from the Vedas based on a show of reason only killed them with his mighty thunderbolt</span>.&#8221; Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>Rig Veda 8.85.15 might be related to this verse.</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 4.19.6-7 &#8220;…replied Vrihaspati, &#8220;I had been applied to by you before, I could have done anything for you that you wished; as it is, I will endeavour and restore you in a few days to your sovereignty.&#8221; So saying, he commenced a sacrifice for the purpose of increasing the might of Indra, and of leading the sons of Raji into error, and so effecting their downfall. Misled by their mental fascination, the princes became enemies of the Brahmans, regardless of their duties, and contemners of the precepts of the Vedas; and thus devoid of morality and religion, they were slain by Indra, who by the assistance of the priest of the gods resumed his place in heaven…&#8221; Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 9.17.15 &#8220;Brhaspati, then offered oblations to fire (with malevolent purpose against the sons of Raji and made them stray from the path of religion) and Indra slew them once and all as they swerved from the path (of righteousness) and not a single son (of Raji) survived.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Also mentioned in Vishnu Purana book 4 chapter 9 which H.H. Wilson summarizes as &#8220;Descendants of Raji, son of Áyus: Indra resigns his throne to him: claimed after his death by his sons, who apostatize from the religion of the Vedas, and are destroyed by Indra. Descendants of Pratíkshatra, son of Kshatravriddha.&#8221;</p>
<p>A story in Shiva Purana goes like this,</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Rudra Samhita 2, Yuddhakanda 5, chapter 4, verses 1 &#8220;[Sanathkumara said] For causing obstacles in their virtuous activities, Visnu of great brilliance, created a Purusa* born of himself. [9-12] <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Let your name be Arihat</span>. You will have other auspicious names too. I shall assign to you a place afterwards. Now hear with reverence what is relevant to the context. O you who wield Maya, create a deceptive sacred text of sixteen hundred thousand verses, contrary to Srutis and Smritis wherein Varnas and Asramas shall be eschewed. Let that holy text be in Apabramsa language&#8230;I shall bestow on you the ability to create it. Different kinds of magic arts shall be subsevient to you. [18-20] O ascetic, no doubt, Vedic and Smarta rites flourish and shine there. But these shall certainly be exploded through this Vidya. O you shaven head, you shall go there for destroying the residents of the three cities. Revealing the Tamasika rites, destroy the three cities. After that, O great one, you shall go to the desert region and stay there carrying on your own duties and activities till the advent of the Kali age. When the Kali age begins let your Dharma be revealed. You shall then continue to do so by means of disciples and disciple&#8217;s disciples.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Rudrasamhita 2, Yuddha Khanda 5, chapter 10, verse 29 &#8220;Since they had refrained from the worship of Siva, hundreds of Asuras were burnt by the fire generated by the arrow. They cried &#8216;Ha Ha&#8217; in distress.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>This story is about the burning of Tripura. This is about Jina (Jain) religion. As per this story, the residents of Tripura followed the Vedic religion and they couldn&#8217;t be killed so Vishnu created an illusory form and named him Arihat and when the residents abandoned the Vedic religion, they were burnt alive. The translator Jagdish Lal Shastri writes on the footnote of Shiva Purana, Rudra Samhita 2, Yuddhakanda 5.4.1,</p>
<p>&#8220;*According to the present context Visnu created a delusive teacher called Mayamoha who created a Mayasastra of sixteen lakhs of slokas in Apabhramsa, preaching Jina Dharma for misguiding the Asuras. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mayamoha created four sorts of preachers for the propagation of Jina Dharma</span>. He preached non-violence, forbade Srauta and Smarta rituals, discarded Varnasrama system, created an order for women that resulted in leaving their home and leading the life of nuns. In some versions, the role is assigned to Brhaspati, the preceptor of the Gods who in the guise of their preceptor Sukra deludes the Asuras&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana also has a similar story wherein demons were killed after they abandoned the Vedic religion and embraced Jainism and Buddhism. H.H. Wilson writes on chapter 4.17-18</p>
<p>&#8220;Of heretics, or those who reject the authority of the Vedas: their origin, as described by Vaśisht́ha to Bhíshma: the gods, defeated by the Daityas, praise Vishńu: an illusory being, or Buddha, produced from his body.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Buddha goes to the earth, and teaches the Daityas to contemn the Vedas: his sceptical doctrines: his prohibition of animal sacrifices. Meaning of the term Bauddha. Jainas and Bauddhas; their tenets. The Daityas lose their power, and are overcome by the gods. Meaning of the term Nagna. Consequences of neglect of duty. Story of Śatadhanu and his wife Śaivyá. Communion with heretics to be shunned.&#8221;</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 3.17.35-44 &#8220;…Upon the conclusion of their prayers, the gods beheld the sovereign deity Hari, armed with the shell, the discus, and the mace, riding on Garud́a. Prostrating themselves before him, they addressed him, and said, &#8220;Have compassion upon us, O lord, and protect us, who have come to thee for succour from the Daityas. They have seized upon the three worlds, and appropriated the offerings which are our portion, taking care not to transgress the precepts of the Veda. Although we, as well as they, are parts of thee, of whom all beings consist, yet we behold the world impressed by the ignorance of unity, with the belief of its separate existence. Engaged in the duties of their respective orders, and following the paths prescribed by holy writ, practising also religious penance, it is impossible for us to destroy them. Do thou, whose wisdom is immeasurable, instruct us in some device by which we may be able to exterminate the enemies of the gods.&#8221; <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #000000;">When the mighty Vishńu heard their request, he emitted from his body an illusory form</span>, which he gave to the gods, and thus spake <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">This deceptive vision shall wholly beguile the Daityas, so that, being led astray from the path of the Vedas, they may be put to death; for all gods, demons, or others, who shall be opposed to the authority of the Veda, shall perish by my might</span>, whilst exercised for the preservation of the world. Go then, and fear not: let this delusive vision precede you; it shall this day be of great service unto you, oh gods!&#8221; Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 3.18.1-11 &#8220;PARÁŚARA.&#8211;After this, the great delusion, having proceeded to earth, beheld the Daityas engaged in ascetic penances upon the banks of the Narmadá river; and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">approaching them in the semblance of a naked mendicant, with his head shaven, and carrying a bunch of peacock&#8217;s feathers</span>, he thus addressed them in gentle accents: &#8220;Ho, lords of the Daitya race! wherefor is it that you practise these acts of penance? is it with a view to recompense in this world, or in another?&#8221; &#8220;Sage,&#8221; replied the Daityas, &#8220;we pursue these devotions to obtain a reward hereafter; why should you make such an inquiry?&#8221; &#8220;If you are desirous of final emancipation,&#8221; answered the seeming ascetic, &#8220;attend to my words, for you are worthy of a revelation which is the door to ultimate felicity. The duties that I will teach you are the secret path to liberation; there are none beyond or superior to them: by following them you shall obtain either heaven or exemption from future existence. You, mighty beings, are deserving of such lofty doctrine.&#8221; By such persuasions, and by many specious arguments, did this delusive being mislead the Daityas from the tenets of the Vedas…&#8221; Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>This is a reference to Digambara Jains. Jain saints still carry peacock feathers with their heads shaven and roam naked.</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 3.18.7-14 &#8220;…might be the duty of those who go naked, or who go clothed in much raiment: and so the Daityas were seduced from their proper duties by the repeated lessons of their illusory preceptor, maintaining the equal truth of contradictory tenets; and they were called Arhatas, from the phrase he had employed of &#8220;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Ye are worthy (Arhatha) of this great doctrine;&#8221; that is, of the false doctrines which he persuaded them to embrace</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The foes of the gods being thus induced to apostatize from the religion of the Vedas</span>, by the delusive person sent by Vishńu, became in their turn teachers of the same heresies, and perverted others; and these, again, communicating their principles to others, by whom they were still further disseminated, the Vedas were in a short time deserted by most of the Daitya race…&#8221; Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>And then reference to Buddhist monks is made,</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 3.18.14-26 &#8220;…<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Then the same deluder, putting on garments of a red colour</span>, assuming a benevolent aspect, and speaking in soft and agreeable tones, addressed others of the same family, and said to them, &#8220;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">If; mighty demons, you cherish a desire either for heaven or for final repose, desist from the iniquitous massacre of animals (for sacrifice)</span>, and hear from me what you should do. Know that all that exists is composed of discriminative knowledge. Understand my words, for they have been uttered by the wise. This world subsists without support, and engaged in the pursuit of error, which it mistakes for knowledge, as well as vitiated by passion and the rest, revolves in the straits of existence.&#8221; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">In this manner, exclaiming to them, &#8220;Know!&#8221; (Budhyadwam), and they replying, &#8220;It is known&#8221; (Budhyate), these Daityas were induced by the arch deceiver to deviate from their religious duties (and become Bauddhas)</span>, by his repeated arguments and variously urged persuasions, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">When they had abandoned their own faith, they persuaded others to do the same</span>, and the heresy spread, and many deserted the practices enjoined by the Vedas and the laws. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The delusions of the false teacher paused not with the conversion of the Daityas to the Jaina and Bauddha heresies, but with various erroneous tenets he prevailed upon others to apostatize</span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">until the whole were led astray, and deserted the doctrines and observances inculcated by the three Vedas</span>. Some then spake evil of the sacred books; some blasphemed the gods; some treated sacrifices and other devotional ceremonies with scorn; and others calumniated the Brahmans. &#8220;The precepts,&#8221; they cried, &#8220;that lead to the injury of animal life (as in sacrifices) are highly reprehensible. To say that casting butter into flame is productive of reward, is mere childishness. If Indra, after having obtained godhead by multiplied rites, is fed upon the wood used as fuel in holy fire, he is lower than a brute, which feeds at least upon leaves. If an animal slaughtered in religious worship is thereby raised to heaven, would it not be expedient for a man who institutes a sacrifice to kill his own father for a victim…&#8221; Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 3.18.30-36 &#8220;…By such and similar lessons the Daityas were perverted, so that not one of them admitted the authority of the Vedas. When the Daityas had thus declined from the path of the holy writings, the deities took courage, and gathered together for battle. Hostilities accordingly were renewed, but the demons were now defeated and slain by the gods, who had adhered to the righteous path. The armour of religion, which had formerly protected the Daityas, had been discarded by them, and upon its abandonment followed their destruction. Thus, Maitreya, you are to understand that those who have seceded from their original belief are said to be naked, because they have thrown off the garment of the Vedas…&#8221; Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 3.18.49-50 &#8220;…Let therefore a prudent person carefully avoid the conversation, or the contact, and the like, of those heretics who are rendered impure by their desertion of the three Vedas. The ancestral rite, although performed with zeal and faith, pleases neither gods nor progenitors if it be looked upon by apostates…&#8221; Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Killing those who left Shaivite Hinduism and embraced Buddhism</span></p>
<p>Shiva Purana, RudraSamhita 2, Yuddha Khanda section 5, chapter 6, verses 28 &#8220;O lord, favourably disposed towards your devotees, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">those Asuras have resorted to Buddha&#8217;s religion</span> and philosophy, thanks to our good fortune and hence they have eschewed all Vedic sacred rites.[36-37] Shiva said:- But the great Asuras are my firm devotees. They shall be killed only by me, for they have been forced to abandon their excellent virtue under false persuasion. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Let Visnu or any one else slay them now that they have been made to abandon their Dharma</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The Asuras of the three cities have become devoid of devotion to me</span>.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>So demons couldn&#8217;t be killed because they followed the Vedic path. If demons committed sins then why weren&#8217;t they killed? Why was there a need to convert them to Buddhism and Jainism? Does being a Hindu makes one immune to all sins? If demons got power from the Vedic religion then why didn&#8217;t Hindu gods from whom the religion emanates stop it? Vishnu in Vishnu Purana 3.17.42-44 clearly says that those being led astray from the path of the Vedas shall be put to death. This one sentence of Vishnu is enough to prove the point that they were killed only because of their apostatizing from Vedic religion. Vishnu Purana book 3 chapter 18 even says that those Daityas who embraced Buddhism and Jainism and also persuaded others to do the same were led astray, meaning they followed the false religion.</p>

<h2><a id="blasphemy"></a>Blasphemy</h2>
<p>Seems like Hindu gods didn&#8217;t like to hear criticism. There are references to the punishment of blasphemers in this world and hereafter for censuring gods, Vedas, Puranas, and even for censuring Brahmins. Krishna said,</p>
<p>Gita 16.18-20 &#8220;Bewildered by false ego, strength, pride, lust and anger, the demons become envious of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is situated in their own bodies and in the bodies of others, and <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">blaspheme against the real religion</span>. Those who are envious and mischievous, who are the lowest among men, I perpetually cast into the ocean of material existence, into various demoniac species of life. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Attaining repeated birth amongst the species of demoniac life</span>.&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Gita 9.11-12 &#8220;Fools deride Me when I descend in the human form. They do not know My transcendental nature as the Supreme Lord of all that be. Those who are thus bewildered are attracted by demonic and atheistic views. In that deluded condition, their hopes for liberation, their fruitive activities, and their culture of knowledge are all defeated.&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Kurma Purana I.16.168b-170a &#8220;Those who consider Visnu as the unmanifest Atman and who are endowed with faith, but who worship Isana with a different vision (i.e. regard him as different from Visnu) are not my beloved ones. Those deluded persons who hate the creator of the world are roasted and cooked in Raurava and other hells and are not released there from even after hundreds and crores of kalpas.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Krishna Janma Khanda 40.116-141 &#8220;&#8230;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">A sinner who slanders Brahma, the creator of the world, the goddess Durga who is the best of female deities, Laksmi, Saraswati, Sita, Tulsi, Ganga, the Vedas, the mother of the Vedas, a vow, devotion, mystic formula pertaining to worship of the spiritual guide who gives formula will dwell in the hell called the &#8216;Blind well&#8217; for half the period of the longevity allotted to Brahma, where bitten by snakes he will scream dreadfully</span>. Whoever slanders Lord Harisikesa Visnu, literally, lord of senses) regarding him as an ordinary god or talks ill of the Puranas (which engender faith in Hair and are more praiseworthy than the S&#8217;rutis) or blames the cow herdess, Raddha, who sprang out of half of the body of Krisna or the ever-adorable Brahmins must dwell in the hell called Avatoda so long as Brahma exists. He dwells there with his feet upwards and face downwards surrounded by snakes. There, bitten by fearful snakes, he screams horribly and oppressed by hunger, he consumes saliva, ordure and urine. Then the fearful myrmidons of Yama in anger thrust torches into his mouth, chastise him in the morning, noon and evening, storm and thunder. He is then very much frightened and with the torments caused by beating he is rendered thirsty and drinks urine to quench his thrust.&#8221; Tr. Rajendra Nath Sen.</p>
<p>Padma Purana IV.17.14-18 &#8220;Formerly in Tretayuga there was a sinful brahmana by name Sudarsana.

He always censured the sacred texts and always condemned the vows&#8230;O brahmana, when once the time of death arrived, he died. The messengers of Yama came (to his place), and binding him they took him to Yama&#8217;s abode&#8230;[22-28] Suta said: O brahmana, then, by Yama&#8217;s order his terrible messengers threw him into faeces (where he remained) for more than a hundred ages of Manu. Freed from there he became (i.e. was born as) a village pig on the earth. For a long time he would remain in hell due to his having eaten food on the day of (i.e. sacred to) Visnu&#8230;&#8221; Tr.

<p>Vishnu Purana 1.6.29-31 &#8220;Those, however, in whose hearts the dross of sin derived from Time (Kála) was still more developed, assented not to sacrifices, but reviled both them and all that resulted from them, the gods, and the followers of the Vedas. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Those abusers of the Vedas, of evil disposition and conduct, and seceders from the path of enjoined duties, were plunged in wickedness</span>… [36-41] For those who neglect their duties, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">who revile the Vedas, and obstruct religious rites, the places assigned after death are the terrific regions of darkness, of deep gloom, of fear, and of great terror; the fearful hell of sharp swords, the hell of scourges and of a waveless sea</span>.” Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Garuda Purana 4.5-12 &#8220;…Those who despise places of pilgrimage, good men, good actions, teachers and Shining Ones; those who disparage the Purāṇas, the Vedas, the Mīmāṁsā, the Nyāya and the Vedānta…&#8221; Tr. Ernest Wood and S.V. Subrahmanyam</p>
<p>Sins that are equal to Brahmin-slaughter</p>
<p>Brahma Purana, Gautami-Mahatmya 94.35 &#8220;He who out of hatred censures Devas, Vedas, spiritual learning and the assemblage of virtuous brahmins shall be a brahmin-slayer.&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana 2.3.19.59b-60 &#8220;One who censures and reviles at yogins, meditators and those who desire Moksa, shall fall into a terrible hell. There is no doubt that even he who listens to the same falls into the hell of terrible appearance and is enveloped in darkness al round. By reviling at leading Yogins a man never goes to heaven.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Markandeya Purana 14.43-44 &#8220;&#8230;Those who have repeated the S&#8217;astra improperly; those who have given utterance to an evil word; those who have blasphemed the Veda, the gods, the dvijas and their guru; for so many year terrible bird with adamant beaks tear out those men&#8217;s very tongues as they are continually reproduced.&#8221;</p>
<p>Markandeya Purana 14.63-64 &#8220;And base men who have hearkened to blasphemy against gurus, the gods, and dvijas, and against the Vedas,-these servants of Yama continually drive iron wedges, red as fire, into the ears, of such wicked men who rejoice in such things though they bewail the while Whoever, led by anger and covetousness, have broken up and destroyed beautiful rest-houses, the abodes of gods and brahmanas, and assemblages in the temple of the gods,-Yama&#8217;s exceedingly cruel servants continually flay the skins of those men from their body by means of these sharp instruments.&#8221;</p>
<h3><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Examples</span></strong></h3>
<p>Parvati commands Hindus to kill the person who revils Shiva,</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Rudrasamhita 2, Parvatikhanda Section III.28.38-39 &#8220;[Parvati said] A person who disparages Siva is definitely worthy of being killed by Siva&#8217;s attendants. If it is a brahmin he must be dismissed or the hearer shall go away from that place immediately. This wicked man will again disparage Siva. Since he is a brahmin, he is not to be killed. He shall be abandoned. He shall not be seen at all.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 4.4.17-18 &#8220;Satī continued: If one hears an irresponsible person blaspheme the master and controller of religion, one should block his ears and go away if unable to punish him. But if one is able to kill, then one should by force cut out the blasphemer&#8217;s tongue and kill the offender, and after that one should give up his own life. Therefore I shall no longer bear this unworthy body, which has been received from you, who have blasphemed Lord Śiva. If someone has taken food which is poisonous, the best treatment is to vomit.&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Swami Prabhupada wrote &#8220;The answer to that argument is that Satī was not vilifying but defending. If possible she should have cut out Dakṣa&#8217;s tongue because he blasphemed Lord Śiva. In other words, since Lord Śiva is the protector of religion, a person who vilifies him should be killed at once, and after killing such a person, one should give up one&#8217;s life. That is the process, but because Dakṣa happened to be the father of Satī, she decided not to kill him but to give up her own life in order to compensate for the great sin she had committed by hearing blasphemy of Lord Śiva. The instruction set forth here in Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam is that one should not tolerate at any cost the activities of a person who vilifies or blasphemes an authority. If one is a brāhmaṇa he should not give up his body because by doing so he would be responsible for killing a brāhmaṇa…&#8221; <strong>Swami Prabhupada on Srimad Bhagavatam 4.4.17</strong> <a href="http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_4.4.17" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_4.4.17<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>Brahmins killed a King named Vena for blasphemeing Vishnu,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 4.14.30-35 &#8220;My dear Vidura, all good fortune unto you. The foolish King, who thought himself very learned, thus insulted the great sages, and the sages, being broken hearted by the King&#8217;s words, became very angry at him. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">All the great saintly sages immediately cried: Kill him! Kill him</span>! He is the most dreadful, sinful person. If he lives, he will certainly turn the whole world into ashes in no time. The saintly sages continued: This impious, impudent man does not deserve to sit on the throne at all. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">He is so shameless that he even dared insult the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Viṣṇu. But for King Vena, </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">who is simply inauspicious, who would blaspheme the Supreme Personality of Godhead</span>, by whose mercy one is awarded all kinds of fortune and opulence? The great sages, thus manifesting their covert anger, immediately decided to kill the King. King Vena was already as good as dead due to his blasphemy against the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus without using any weapons, the sages killed King Vena simply by high-sounding words. After all the sages returned to their respective hermitages, the mother of King Vena, Sunīthā, became very much aggrieved because of her son&#8217;s death. She decided to preserve the dead body of her son by the application of certain ingredients and by chanting mantras [mantra-yogena].&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>This is the same King Vena who embraced Jainism.</p>
<p>Some foolish minorities in India blame politicians for communal clashes, saying that they do it for elections. It&#8217;s somehow true, but Hindus don&#8217;t think like that. I haven&#8217;t seen any Hindu blaming politicians for communal clashes rather he will directly abuse the religion and blame the entire community. When dealing with the saffronized textbook, minorities say that Britishers deliberately distorted history as part of their Divide and Rule policy. But Hindus don&#8217;t say that. It were not politicians or Britishers who commanded Hindu rulers like Pushyamitra, Kinnara, Shashanka, Chola kings, etc to kill Jains and Buddhists, it were not politicians or the Britshers who ordered Hindu scholars like Adi Shankaracharya and Kumarila Bhatta to insult Jainism and Buddhism and persecute their followers, from the persecution of Buddhists and Jains, killing nearly a million Muslims in post-Independce riots, 1984 Anti-Sikh riots, pulling down the mosque, numerous riots where Muslims were targeted, anti-Christian Kandhamal riots, vandalization of Churches and Mosques, numerous hate speeches against minorities by Hindu leaders, there is something common. All these drew inspiration from the hate preached by their religion. I may sound like a Hindutvadi because I am speaking in their language that&#8217;s because I am responding to them in the language they understand the most.</p>

<p>Written by Sulaiman Razvi</p>
<p>Caste system is one of the evils of Hindu religion that still exists in the society. Caste system is nothing but isolating the low castes from the society. It divides people within the Hindu fold. The condition of low caste people has been miserable. Low castes people suffered the Brahminical oppression. The Untouchables were not allowed within the gates of Pune city under the reign of Peshwas and Marathas. In Gujarat the Untouchables were forced to wear horns. In Bombay they were not allowed to wear clean and untorn clothes. Read the article <a href="/index.php/2014/01/01/manu-and-shudras/" data-wpel-link="internal">Manu and the Shudras</a> for more information on the condition of low castes in ancient India. Low caste women were not allowed to cover their breasts. This was abolished by Tipu Sultan. But was again reinforced after his death. In the 18<sup>th</sup> century, Low caste women lead <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channar_revolt" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Channar revolt<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> which resulted in many low caste Hindus converting to Christianity. Oppression by Brahmins made low castes people embrace other faiths especially Islam. Swami Vivekananda wrote,</p>
<p><span id="more-2274"></span></p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p>“Why amongst the poor of India so many are Mohammedans? It is nonsense to say, they were converted by the sword. It was to gain their liberty from the . . . zemindars and from the . . . priest” <a href="http://www.ramakrishnavivekananda.info/vivekananda/volume_8/epistles_fourth_series/034_diwanji.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">[ Source ]<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p></blockquote>
<p>Islam came in India as a savior to the low castes. The low castes were attracted towards the equality given in Islam unlike Hinduism which discriminated people based on their birth. Although the Indian constitution guarantees equal right to every citizen irrespective of religion or caste. The menace of caste system still exists in India. A temple was washed after Bihar chief minister Jitan Ram Manjhi visited it [<a href="http://ibnlive.in.com/news/temple-was-washed-after-i-visited-it-says-bihar-cm-jitan-ram-manjhi/502685-3-232.html" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">1<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>], Dalits threatened the priests that they will convert to Islam if they are prohibited from entering the temple [<a href="http://www.firstpost.com/india/ghar-wapsi-fallout-meet-our-demands-else-well-convert-to-islam-say-dalits-2039485.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">2<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>], a Dalit man was set afire for fetching water at a hand pump [<a href="http://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/dalit-villager-set-afire-for-fetching-water-at-hand-pump-in-mp-s-sagar-dist/article1-1352018.aspx" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">3<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>], another Dalit man was killed for ringtone praising Dr. B.R.

<p>The National Human Rights Commission Report on the Prevention of Atrocities against Scheduled Castes says that, “every 18 minutes a crime is committed against a Dalit. Every day 3 Dalit women are raped, 2 Dalits are murdered and 2 Dalits Houses are burnt in India, 11 Dalits are beaten. Every week: 13 Dalits are murdered, 5 Dalits home or possessions are burnt, 6 Dalits are kidnapped or abducted.”</p>

<p>“…in 27.6% of India’s villages, Dalits are prevented from entering police stations. In 25.7% of the country’s villages, Dalits are prevented from entering ration shops. In 35% of villages, Dalits are barred from selling produce in local markets. In 47% of villages with milk cooperatives, Dalits are prevented from selling milk, and in 25% of such villages, they are prevented from buying milk altogether.</p>
<p>Further, according to official Indian crime statistics, 27 atrocities against Dalits are committed every day. 13 Dalits are murdered every week. 3 Dalit women are raped every day. A crime is committed against a Dalit every 18 minutes. This, despite the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989. Worse, these crimes are on the rise. According to data released by NACDOR, a total of 3,198 cases related to atrocities on dalits have been registered between 2004 and 2013 as against 1,305 from 1994 to 2003. These crimes rose by another 19 percent in 2014. According to statistics compiled by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), crimes against SCs rose to 47,064 in 2014 from 39,408 in 2013. In 2012 there were 33,655 crimes against dalits, about the same as in 2011…”</p>

<p>There have been thousands of caste related violence in India, you can refer to Wikipedia’s article <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caste-related_violence_in_India" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Caste-related violence in India<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. All these caste based violence perpetrated by higher caste people is wholly inspired by religious doctrine. Hindu god Rama is said to have beheaded a Shudra named Shambuka just because he was practising religious rite. With such kind of stories is sure to inspire radicals. Some apologists try to show that there is no caste system in Hinduism, that it is actually is based on profession one acquires. I would have appreciated their effort if they really wanted to emancipate the low castes. But there is actually a motive behind it. Politicians try to befriend Dalits only to garner votes and to use low caste people in riots. While religious leaders do it to get as many followers as they can, because more followers means more donations and popularity. One such Hindu reformer was Dayanand Saraswati who said that Veda treats all castes alike. But he said this only to get followers. He didn’t abolish the caste system, but upheld the caste system. He discriminated between the castes. He opined that the duty of a Shudra is to serve the Dvijas and held Manu Smriti has authoritative text, read the article <a href="/index.php/2014/05/01/mulshankar-and-casteism/" data-wpel-link="internal">Mulshankar and Casteism</a> for more information. Hindu terror organizations conducts Ghar Wapsi programs, rallies against minorities but they never conduct any event or program for the betterment of the low caste Hindus. Purusha Sukta is said to be the root of caste system in Hinduism, it is mentioned in Veda,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.90.12 The Brahman was his mouth, of both his arms was the Rājanya made. His thighs became the Vaiśya, from his feet the Śūdra was produced.<br />

<h1>Birth based caste system</h1>
<p>As we all know, caste system in Hinduism is birth based and not based on the profession acquired by the individual.</p>
<p>Apastamba Dharma Shastra 1.1.1.4-5 [There are] four castes Brahmana, Kshatriyas, Vaishya, and Shudra. Among these, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">each preceding (caste) is superior by birth</span> to the one following.</p>
<p>Mahabharata 13.143.6 “The illustrious one said, ‘The status of a Brahmana, O goddess, is exceedingly difficult to attain. O auspicious lady, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">one becomes a Brahmana through original creation or birth</span>. After the same manner the Kshatriya, the Vaisya, and the Sudra, all become so through original creation.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Kisari Mohan Ganguli writes,</p>
<p>”Nisargat is literally through creation or original nature, or birth. Of course, what is implied is that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">one becomes a Brahmana, or Kshatriya, or Vaisya or Sudra, through original creation as such, by the Self-born, that is, birth</span>.” [ <a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m13/m13b108.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Source<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> ]
<p>Narada Purana I.24.7-9 “Those castes are said to be four, viz., the Brahmans, Ksatriyas, Vaisyas and Sudras. Among these the Brahmana is the foremost. The Brahmanas, Ksatriyas and Vaisyas- these three are called Dvijas (the twice-born), because at first they are born of their mothers and later on, they are consecrated by means of sacred thread with due repetition of the Mantras (which constitute the second birth). <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Thus twice-born-ness is attained by these three classes</span>. All holy rites and duties must be performed by these castes in accordance with the specific duties prescribed for their castes. By failing to perform the holy duties prescribed for one’s own caste, one is called a heretic by learned men.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>It is mentioned in Bhagavat Purana,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 11.5.5 “But Brahmanas, Ksattriyas and Vaisyas, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">by virtue of their original birth</span>, and second birth through their Upanayana (investiture of the sacred thread) ceremony (become eligible for studies, performance of sacrifices, etc.)…” Tr. G.V. Tagare, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Manu 10.5 In all castes (varna) those (children) only which are begotten in the direct order on wedded wives, equal (in caste and married as) virgins, are to be considered as <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">belonging to the same caste (as their fathers</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">)</span>.</p>
<p>Acharya Medhatithi writes on Manu Smriti 2.148</p>
<p>“Jati stands for ‘Janma’, birth.”</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Uma Samhita 44.13 ”O excellent sage, birth as a man is very difficult to obtain; especially that as a Brahmin…” Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Padma Purana II.38.20b-24 “[The Sages said:] The three castes viz. brahmanas, ksatriyas and vaissyas are twice born. This (i.e. the Veda) is an ancient sacred text meant for all the castes. The beings behave according to the Vedic practices; therefor they (continue to) live. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">You are born in the family of Brahman. (So) you are a brahmana only</span>.” Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>Agni Purana 162.3-7 “…By reading the Vedas and practicing equally to all, a man enters the region of paradise. This is the prerogative of the twice born castes, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">specifically belonging to a Brahamana as his birth right</span>, as he might read the Vedas and realise the truths inculcated therein by living any of the four orders of life. A Brahmana by dwelling in this world, may attain the Supreme Brahma.” Tr. M.N. Dutt-</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>Vasistha Dharma Shastra 4.1-3 <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The four castes are distinguished by their origin</span> and by particular sacraments. There is also the following passage of the Veda, ‘The Brâhmana was his mouth, the Kshatriya formed his arms, the Vaisya his thighs; the Sûdra was born from his feet.’ <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">It has been declared in (the following passage of) the Veda that (a Sûdra) shall not receive the sacraments</span>, ‘He created the Brâhmana with the Gâyatrî (metre), the Kshatriya with the Trishtubh, the Vaisya with the Gagatî, the Sûdra without any metre.’</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>Mahabharata 13.27.3-6 “O best of kings, how may one, if he happens to be a Kshatriya or a Vaisya or a Sudra, succeed in acquiring the status of a Brahmana? It behoveth thee to tell me the means. Is it by penances the most austere, or by religious acts, or by knowledge of the scriptures, that a person belonging to any of the three inferior orders succeeds in acquiring the status of a Brahmana? Do tell me this, O grandsire!’ “Bhishma said, ‘The status of a Brahmana, O Yudhishthira, is incapable of acquisition by a person belonging to any of the three other orders. That status is the highest with respect to all creatures. Travelling through innumerable orders of existence, by undergoing repeated births, one at last, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">in some birth, becomes born as a Brahmana</span>.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>Skanda Purana clearly states that a Shudra must not study, must not sacrifice, he has to stay in the same state as at birth which is contrary to what apologists claim that a Shudra by studying Veda becomes a Brahmin,</p>
<p>Skanda Purana V.iii.122.16 ”A separate duty has not been assigned by Paramesthin to the Sudra. He need not have any Mantra, consecration or pursuit of lores. He need not have any conventional study of the science of words (i.e. Grammar) and special worship of deities. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">He has to be, day and night, in the same state as at birth</span>.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 10.3 <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">On account of his pre-eminence, on account of the superiority of his origin</span>, on account of his observance of (particular) restrictive rules, and on account of his particular sanctification <span style="color: #ff0000;">the Brahmana is the lord of (all) castes (varna)</span>.</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 1.98-99 <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The very birth of a Brahmana</span> is an eternal incarnation of the sacred law; for he is born to (fulfil) the sacred law, and becomes one with Brahman. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">A Brahmana, coming into existence</span>, is born as the highest on earth, the lord of all created beings, for the protection of the treasury of the law.</p>
<p>Katyayana Samhita 8.6 “Many wives of the same caste and of other castes existing, the rite of churning, for producing the Fire, should be done by the chaste wives of the same caste, on account of the superiority of birth.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Mahabharata, Santi Parva 12 Section 72 “…Matariswan answered, ‘The Brahmana, O best of kings, has sprung from the mouth of Brahman. The Kshatriya has sprung from his two arms, and the Vaisya from his two thighs. For waiting upon these three orders, O ruler of men, a fourth order, viz., the Sudra, sprung into life, being created from the feet (of Brahman). Originally created thus, <span style="color: #ff0000;">the </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Brahmana takes birth</span><span style="color: #ff0000;"> on earth as the lord of all creatures</span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">his duty</span> being the keep of the Vedas and the other scriptures. Then, for ruling the earth and wielding the rod of chastisement and protecting all creatures, the second order, viz., the Kshatriya was created. The Vaisya was created for supporting the two other orders and himself by cultivation and trade, and finally, it was ordained by Brahman that the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sudra should serve the three orders as a menial</span>.’ “Pururavas said, ‘Tell me truly, O god of Winds, to whom, this earth righteously belong. Does it belong to the Brahmana or to the Kshatriya?’ “The god of Winds said, ‘<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Everything that exists in the universe belongs to the Brahmana in consequence of his birth and precedence</span>. Persons conversant with morality say this. What the Brahmana eats is his own. The place he inhabits is his own. What he gives away is his own. He deserves the veneration of all the (other) orders. He is the first-born and the foremost. As a woman, in the absence of her husband, accepts his younger brother for him, even so the earth, in consequence of the refusal of the Brahmana, has accepted his next-born, viz., the Kshatriya, for her lord…” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>

<h2>Caste is based on Karma and caste of parents</h2>
<p>As per Hinduism, a person attains specific caste due to the deeds of past life, Krishna said,</p>
<p>Gita 18.41 “Of Brahmanas, Kshtriyas and Vaishyas, as also the Sudras, O Arjuna, the duties are distributed according to the qualities born of their own nature.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Ramanuja Acharya writes on this verse,</p>
<p>”The character of Brahmanas, Ksatriyas, Vaishyas, and Sudras arise from their various inherent dispositions. In other words their past Karma is the cause of their being born in a specific social group…”</p>
<p>Swami Swarupananda writes on Gita 18.41,</p>
<p>“According to the Karma or habits and tendencies formed by desire, action, and association in the past life manifesting themselves in the present as effects. Or, nature (Svabhava) may here mean the Maya made up of three Gunas, the Prakriti of the Lord”</p>
<p>It is mentioned in Brahma Vaivarta Purana,</p>
<p>Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Krishna Janma Khanda 74.10 ”According to Karma, some go to heaven or are severally born in the houses of a Brahmin, Ksatriya, Vaisya or a Sudra.” Tr. Rajnedra Nath Sen</p>
<p>Chandogya Upanishad 5.10.7. ‘Those whose conduct has been good, will quickly attain some good birth, the birth of a Brahmana, or a Kshatriya, or a Vaisya. But those whose conduct has been evil, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">will quickly attain an evil birth, the birth of a dog, or a hog, or a Kandala</span>.” Tr. Swami Nikhilanda</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><strong>CHILD BORN TO PARENTS OF DIFFERENT CASTES</strong></p>
<p>A Brahmin couple begets a Brahmin child, a Shudra couple begets a Shudra child.</p>
<p>Mahbharata 13.48 The Brahmana may take four wives, one from each of the four orders. In two of them (viz.,the wife taken from his own order and that taken from the one next below), he takes birth himself (the children begotten upon them being regarded as invested with the same status as his own)… A Kshatriya may take three wives… The Vaisya may take two spouses…<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The Sudra can take only one wife, viz., she that is taken from his own order. The son begotten by him upon her becomes a Sudra</span>….</p>
<p>But if parents belong to different caste then the child will not belong to either his mother or father’s caste,</p>
<p>Manu 10.5 In all castes (varna) those (children) only which are begotten in the direct order on wedded wives, equal (in caste and married as) virgins, are to be considered as <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">belonging to the same caste (as their fathers</span>).</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti 16.1-3 Sons [begotten] on women equal in caste [to their husbands] are equal in caste [to their fathers]. [Sons begotten] on women of lower castes, become of the caste of their mothers. Sons begotten on women of higher castes are despised by the twice-born.</p>
<p>Agni Purana 150.9-11 ”The duties which appertain to the Shudra caste, O thou best of the Bhrigus, are to serve the Brahmins and to practice the handicrafts. Since the investiture with the holy thread, a member of the twice born caste is supposed to take a second spiritual birth, and I shall describe the castes which children born of parents not members of the same caste, would respectively belong to. A child born of parents belonging to different castes would get the caste of its mother, but on the contrary a child born of a Shudra father by a Brahmin mother would be a Chandala.” Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 10.6. Sons, begotten by twice-born man on wives of the next lower castes, they declare to be similar (to their fathers, but) blamed on account of the fault (inherent) in their mothers.</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 10.16 From a Sudra spring in the inverse order (by females of the higher castes) three base-born (sons, apasada), an Ayogava, a Kshattri, and a Kandala, the lowest of men;</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>Manu Smriti 10.6-23 gives a list of castes that springs up due to inter-caste marriage. It is mentioned in Yajnavalkya,</p>
<p>Yajnavalkya Smriti verse 90 <span style="text-decoration: underline;">By men of the same caste (Varna) in women of the same caste (Varna) are born sajati (sons of equal birth or caste)</span>. In blameless marriages sons (are begotten continuing the line.</p>
<p>Like Manu, Yajnavalkya also goes on mentioning the list of castes from verse 91. However this system mentioned may not be applicable in the case of Niyoga. Because all men of Kshatriya caste were killed so the Kshatriya ladies went to Brahmins for contracting Niyoga and their son were considered Kshatriyas,</p>
<p>Mahabharata “1.104 And the illustrious scion of Bhrigu’s race, by means of his swift arrows annihilated the Kshatriya tribe one and twenty times. “And when the earth was thus deprived of Kshatriyas by the great Rishi, the Kshatriya ladies all over the land had offspring raised by Brahmanas skilled in the Vedas. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">It has been said in the Vedas that the sons so raised belongeth to him that had married the mother</span>. And the Kshatriya ladies went in unto the Brahamanas not lustfully but from motives of virtue. Indeed, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">it was thus that the Kshatriya race was revived</span>.”” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Sons born to father of higher caste (like Brahmin) are considered to be Brahmin in quality only, though of low caste than their father. It is mentioned in Manu Smriti,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 10.67-69 The decision is as follows: ‘He who was begotten by an Aryan on a non-Aryan female, may become (like to) an Aryan by his virtues; <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">he whom an Aryan (mother) bore to a non-Aryan father (is and remains) unlike to an Aryan</span>.’ The law prescribes that neither of the two shall receive the sacraments, the first (being excluded) on account of the lowness of his origin, the second (because the union of his parents was) against the order of the castes. As good seed, springing up in good soil, turns out perfectly well, even so <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">the son of an Aryan by an Aryan woman is worthy of all the sacraments</span>.</p>
<p>Some scholars interpret the ‘Sacraments’ here as minor sacrifice like Pakayajna which can be performed by low caste also. It is mentioned in Mahabharata,</p>
<p>Mahabharata 13.48.5 “The son that is begotten by a Brahmana upon a Sudra wife is called Parasara, implying one born of a corpse, for the Sudra woman’s body is as inauspicious as a corpse. He should serve the persons of his (father’s) race. Indeed, it is not proper for him to give up the duty of service that has been laid down for him.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>So this is yet another proof that caste is based on birth in a particular family, If a baby is born in a Brahmin family then he is a Brahmin but if he is born to a Shudra parents then he is Shudra by default which is his permanent caste for entire lifetime.</p>

<p>Mahabharata 12.188.5 “The complexion the Brahmanas obtained was white; that which the Kshatriyas obtained was red; that which the Vaisyas got was yellow; and that which was given to the Sudras was black.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Mahbharata 9.38.1-2 “Vaishampayana said, &#8220;Then Valadeva, O king, proceeded to Vinasana where the Sarasvati hath become invisible in consequence of her contempt for Sudras and Abhiras. And since the Sarasvati, in consequence of such contempt, is lost at that spot, the Rishis, for that reason, O chief of the Bharatas, always name the place as Vinasana.” Tr. Kisari Mohan Ganguli</p>
<p>Swami Prabhupada the founder of ISKCON said that Shudra must not be given freedom and must not be treated equally.</p>
<p>Swami Prabhupada said, “<em>Śūdra</em> is to be controlled only. They are never given to be freedom. Just like in America. The blacks were slaves. They were under control. And since you have given them equal rights they are disturbing, most disturbing, always creating a fearful situation, uncultured and drunkards. What training they have got? They have got equal right? That is best, to keep them under control as slaves but give them sufficient food, sufficient cloth, not more than that. Then they will be satisfied.” <strong>Room Conversation Varṇāśrama System Must Be Introduced — February 14, 1977, Māyāpura<br />

<p>Swami Prabhupada says Shudras have no brain,</p>
<p>“Sudras [black people] have no brain,” he said. “In America also, the whole [of] America once belonged to the Red Indians. Why they could not improve? The land was there. Why [did] these foreigners, the Europeans, came and improved [it]? So sudras cannot do this. They cannot make any [improvements].”<br />

<p><strong>Greeting a Shudra is prohibited</strong>,</p>
<p>Atri Samhita 1.308 “He, who unknowingly salutes a lowcaste person, should immediately bathe and get [himself] purified by taking clarified butter.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<h2>Speaking with a low caste is prohibited</h2>
<p>Hinduism the so called most tolerant religion prohibits a Dvija to converse with a low caste,</p>
<p>Apastamba Dharma Shastra 2.1.2.8. As it is sinful to touch a Candala, [so it is also sinful] to speak to him or to look at him. The penance for these [offences will be declared].</p>
<p>Usana Samhita Chapter 2, Verse 4-6 “After conversing with a Chandala or a Mlechchha, after talking with abandoned women or with Sudras…drinking or touching urine and excreta, one should rinse his mouth again, even if he has rinsed it once…” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti 71.58-59 “Nor converse with a woman in her flow. Nor with the degraded and low-caste men.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<h2>One shouldn’t even look at the Shudra</h2>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana 14:1:1:31 <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">And whilst not coming into contact with Sûdras</span> and remains of food; for this Gharma is he that shines yonder, and he is excellence, truth, and light; but woman, the Sûdra, the dog, and the black bird (the crow), are untruth: <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">he should not look at these</span>, lest he should mingle excellence and sin, light and darkness, truth and untruth.</p>
<p>Usana Samhita 9.53 “By taking food, out of ignorance, after seeing a Mahapatakin, a Chandala, or a woman in [her] menses, one is purified [by fasting] for three nights.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Parashara Smriti 6.22 Having seen a Chandala, a Brahmana should cast look at the sun; having touched a Chandala a Brahaman should bathe with all his wearing apparels on.</p>
<p>One should avoid journey if one sees a Chandala,</p>
<p>Agni Purana chapter 230 “…A pregnant woman, a widow, drugs such as the Pinyaka, etc., a Chandala, a member of the Shvapacha or any other vile caste, a butcher, or a killer of birds, should be removed from the presence of a man, about to start a journey…” Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Hinduism also says that one should avoid the sight of a person who cooks for Shudra, who burns corpses of Shudra, a Chandala and equates them to bastard, theives etc,</p>
<p>Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Krishna Janma Khanda 78.33-41 “O father, now I am going to describe to you things whose sight is sinful. Bad dream is the root of sin and sole cause of calamity. The sight of the following…the cook of a S’udra, one who burns the corpse of a S’udra, a Brahmin who eats food prepared in connexion with the funerals of a S’udra…a S’udra, a widow, a Candal…a bastard, a thief, a liar…a Brahmin who is the husband of a barren woman, a S’udra who commits adultery with a Brahmin woman…” Tr. Rajendra Nath Sen</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 4.140. Let him not journey too early in the morning, nor too late in the evening, nor just during the midday (heat), nor with an unknown (companion), nor alone, nor with Sudras.</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<h2>Even stepping on Shadow of low caste is prohibited</h2>
<p>Dr. B.R. Ambedkar <a href="/index.php/2014/01/01/manu-and-shudras/" data-wpel-link="internal">wrote</a>, “Under the rule of the Marathas and the Peshwas the Untouchables were not allowed within the gates of Poona city, the capital of the Peshwas between 3 p. m. and 9 a. m. because, before nine and after three, their bodies cast too long a shadow; and whenever their shadow fell upon a Brahmin it polluted him, so that he dare not taste food or water until he had bathed and washed the impurity away. So also no Untouchable was allowed to live in a walled town ; cattle and dogs could freely enter but not the Untouchables.”</p>
<p>Usana Samhita 9.89 “By getting on the shadow of a lowcaste person, one should drink clarified butter after bathing. By looking at the Sun in an impure state, one should recite the Mantram Agnindraja.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Kurma Purana II.34.80 “…On treading the shadow of a Candala, one shall take bath and drink ghee.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><strong>Some other verses about discriminating the low caste</strong></p>
<p>Skanda Purana III.ii.40.63 “The Sudras who become antagonistic to those Brahmanas who were honoured by Brahma, Visnu and Siva go to the Raurava hell.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Narada Purana I.12.12 “Whatever is given in charity to one who habitually partakes of Sudra’s food or to one who cremates the corpses of Sudras or to one who takes food prepared by an unchaste woman, becomes futile.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Narada Purana I.23.26 “The observer of the holy rite should never talk to one who nourishes his progeny through a Sudra woman, to the husband of a Sudra woman and to one who performs sacrifices on behalf of those who are not eligible for the same.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><strong>PROHIBITED FOR A SHUDRA SERVANT TO MAKE WEALTH</strong></p>
<p>Mahabharata 12.60.28-29 “<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">A Sudra should never amass wealth, lest, by his wealth</span>, he makes the members of the three superior classes obedient to him. By this he would incur sin. With the king’s permission, however, a Sudra, for performing religious acts, may earn wealth.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Mahabharata 12.166.8 &#8220;The Shudra is not competent to celebrate a sacrifice. The king should, therefore, take away (wealth for such a purpose) from a Shudra&#8217;s house.&#8221; Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>So a Shudra servant cannot even amass wealth and rather has to seek permission from the king for making wealth.</p>
<p>Mahabharata 12.60.36 “The Sudra should never abandon his master, whatever the nature or degree of the distress into which the latter may fall. If the master loses his wealth, he should with excessive zeal be supported by the Sudra servant<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">. A Sudra cannot have any wealth that is his own</span>. Whatever he possesses belongs lawfully to his master.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 8.417 <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Let a Brahmana unhestitangly appropriate to himself whatever (his) Sudra (Slave) has earned</span>, inasmuch as nothing can be belong to the latter, he being himself an enjoyable good of the Brahmana.</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 10.129 No collection of wealth must be made by a Sudra, even though he be able (to do it); for a Sudra who has acquired wealth, gives pain to Brahmanas.</p>

<h2>Penance for killing a Shudra</h2>
<p>The penance for killing a Shudra is as same as killing animals in many Hindu texts while Manu Smriti prescribes death penalty for killing a Brahmin,</p>
<p>Mahabharata 12.165.56 “Having slain a dog or bear or camel, one should perform the same penance that is laid down for the slaughter of a Sudra.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Agni Purana 169.25-32 “…A man having killed a cat, a mongoose, a frog, a dog, a Godha, an owl, and a crow, should practice the penance he ought to have done, if he had killed a Shudra…” Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Following is the punishment to be meted out to a Shudra if he kills a Brahmin,</p>
<p>Narada Purana I.30.17-18 “On killing an ordinary Brahmana (by birth only who has not studied the Vedas, etc.), he should perform the expiatory rite for one year. O Brahmana, thus the mode of expiating for killing a Brahmana has been stated. The expiation for a Ksatriya is twice this and that for a Vaiya is thrice: Learned men know that the <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Sudra who kills a Brahmana is to be pounded to death with a club</span>.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p><a href="#top" class="broken_link">top</a></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<h2>Touching low castes makes on impure</h2>
<p>Hindu text prohibits a Dvija (Brahmin, Kshatriya &amp; Vaishya) to touch low castes especially Chandalas. And the penance for touching low castes is to consume Panchagavya which is a mixture of five products of cow like Cow Urine, Cow Dung, Milk, Curd and Clarified Butter. Which means that low castes in Hinduism are considered worse than cow dung and urine. There are four castes in Hinduism and there is no fifth caste. Groups like Chandala, Musahar… are outcasts i.e., they are outside the pale of four Varnas. They are called Achoots (Untouchables) in Hinduism. This may be because it is prohibited for Dvijas to touch them. Hindu text mentions Low castes, women in her menses on par with dogs and pigs and states by by touching this a Dvija ought to get cleansed. Hindu text goes on to say that a low caste intentionally touching a high caste person must be put to death,</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti 5.104 If one who (being a member of the Kandala or some other low caste) must not be touched, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">intentionally defiles by his touch</span> one who (as a member of a twice-born caste) may be touched (by other twice-born persons only), <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">he shall be put to death</span></strong>.</p>
<p>Another clear translation,<br />
Vishnu Smriti 5.103 “A man belonging to a caste that is not touched, and willingly touching the three [higher] castes, shall be killed.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Angiras Samhita 1.39 “When [a Brahmana] is touched by a woman in [her menses], <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">by a dog or by a Sudra</span>, he <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">becomes purified by the Panchagavya</span> after fasting for a night.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Angiras Samhita 1.9-10 “If he on any occasion, touched by a Sudra who has not washed his mouth after taking meals, he should bathe and recite [the Gayatri] and shall become purified by [fasting for] half a day. If a Vipra is [similarly] touched by a Vaisya, a dog or a Sudra, he shall after fasting for one night become purified with the Panchagavya” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dath</p>
<p>Parasara Smriti 7.22 “A Brahmana, who touched a dog, or a Sudra before washing his mouth, after eating, should fast for a day, and take the compound known as Panchagavyam in order to recover his cleanness.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Yama Samhita verse 41 “A twice-born person, who has the leavings of food in his mouth, on being touched by such a person, a dog, or a Sudra become purified with the Panchagavya, after fasting for a night.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Apastamba Samhita 5.1-2 “What would be the form of expiatory penance for a twice-born one, who, touched by a Chandala, drinks water before performing an A’chamanam? A Brahmana under the circumstance, should regain his purity by fasting for three nights and by taking Panchagavyam, while the term of the penance is two days only for a Kshatriya, its other factors remaining the same.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Apastamba Samhita 7.5 “A woman in her menses, happened to be touched by a S’vapak or a Chandala, should fast for three nights and recover her purity by taking Panchagavyam, thereafter.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Apastamba Samhita 7.19 “A Brahmana-woman in her menses, happening to be touched by a S’udra woman, similarly circumstanced as herself, should regain her purity by fasting for a whole day and night, and by taking Panchagavyam.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Usana Samhita 8.75 “By touching a Chandala, a woman who has given birth to a Child, a dead body, a woman in [her] menses or those touched by her, or any outcaste, one should bathe for purification. If, out of mistake, one touches an article touched by a Chandala, a woman who has given birth to a child, or a dead body, purification is attained by bathing, rinsing the mouth and [thereafter] reciting the Gayatri.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Atri Samhita 1.263-4 “By touching a Chandala, an outcaste, a Mlechchha, a wine-bowl, or a woman in [her] menses, a twice-born person should not take his meals. If [he is touched by any of these] while taking [his] meals, [he must at once stop.] Thereafter he should not take his meals; and giving up his food, he should bathe. And being commanded by the Brahmanas, he should fast for three nights. And taking Yavaka (food prepared from barley) together with clarified butter, he should complete the sacrifice” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Atri Samhita 1.185 “…if a twice-born person being anointed with oil or clarified butter, touches a Chandala; he should, after fasting for a day and night, purify [himself] with the Panchagavya.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Atri Samhita 1.233 “The foremost of the twice-born, when, having still the leavings of food in his mout, touched by a caste outside [the pale of the recogniged castes], should, after fasting for five nights, get purified with the Panchagavya.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Atri Samhita 1.273 “By being touched by dogs, Chandalas, or crows, a woman in her menses should remain fasting till [the menstrual period] and should get herself purified by bathing in time.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Samvarta Samhita verses 178 “By touching Chandala, an outcaste, a dead-body, a lowcaste, a woman in her menses, and a woman in a state of impurity consequent on child-birth, one should bathe with the cloth on.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Apastamba Samhita Chapter 4 Verse 5 “…While the term of the penance should be extended to six days in case where he might have touched a Chandala before rinsing his mouth with water, after a meal.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Usana Samhita Chapter 5 Verse 30-32 “…One should not touch a person of grim visage, a Mlechchha and a woman in menses.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Angiras Samhita 1.37-38 “One does not become of pure conduct so long as the menstrual flow continues. When the menses is stopped, a woman may be employed in domestic works and known for sexual purpose. On the first day [of the menses], she is a Chandala woman; on the second, she is the murderer of a Brahmana; on the third, she is called a washer-woman; and on the fourth day, she becomes purified.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dath</p>
<p>Narada Purana I.14.2-3 “I shall mention the atonement to the person who, while taking food, touches an impure or a fallen person or a Candala, either out of anger or due to ignorance. Such a person shall perform bath three times a day (trisavana snana) either for three days or for six days. A Brahmana becomes pure by sipping paca-gavya (the five products of the cow taking collectively, viz. milk, curds, clarified butter, urine, and cowdung).” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti 23.41 Mire and water in the ruts on a high road, defiled by the touch of a dog, of a crow, or of a low caste person, as well as buildings constructed of baked bricks are purified by the winds.</p>
<p>Kurma Purana II.34.65 “A Brahmana, while Ucchista (with particles of food in the mouth or on hand) willfully touches Candalas or fallen persons (outcastes) should observe the Prajapatya vow for purification.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Garuda Purana 1.222.20-21 “…A brahmin defiled by the touch of a dog or a Sudra defiled by Ucchista shall fast for a night and drink Pancagayva. He shall become pure. Touched by an outcaste he shall fast for five nights.” Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>

<h1>Torturing the low caste</h1>
<p>Agni Purana 227.21-31 “…a Shudra using force to a Kshatriya should have his tongue cut off. A Shudra who would aspire to give moral instructions to a Brahmana, should be punished by the king…” Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti 5.24 “If one delivers religious instructions with haughtiness, the king shall pour hot oil into his mouth.” Tr. Manmath Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 8.282-3 If out of arrogance he spits (on a superior), the king shall cause both his lips to be cut off; if he urines (on him), the penis; if he breaks wind (against him), the anus. If he lays hold of the hair (of a superior), let the (king) unhesitatingly cut off his hands, likewise (if he takes him) by the feet, the beard, the neck, or the scrotum.</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 8.272. If he arrogantly teaches Brahmanas their duty, the king shall cause hot oil to be poured into his mouth and into his ears.</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 8.270-1 <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">A once-born man (a Sudra), who insults a twice-born man with gross invective, shall have his tongue cut out</span>; for he is of low origin. If he mentions the names and castes (gati) of the (twice-born) with contumely, an iron nail, ten fingers long, shall be thrust red-hot into his mouth.</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 227.73-75 <span style="text-decoration: underline;">“A Sudra should be deprived of his tongue if he abuses violently a twice-born</span>, if his offence be moderate; if his offence be highest, he is to be fined Uttama Sahasa. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">A king should be put a red, hot iron spike twelve Angulas long in the mouth of a Sudra who vilifies violently one, taking his name</span>, caste and house. A Sudra who teaches Dharma to the twice born should also be punished by a sovereign by getting hot oil poured into his ears and mouth.” Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>The irony is that a Shudra is given corporal punishment for abusing Dvijas (Twice-born) while a Brahmin or other castes are not,</p>
<p>Gautama Dharma Shastra 12.11-13 But a Brahmana (who abuses) a Kshatriya (shall pay) fifty (Karshapanas), One half of that (amount if he abuses) a Vaisya, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">(and if he abuses) a Sudra, nothing</span>.</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 227.67-68 ”A Ksatriya who abuses a Brahmana should be fined 100 Panas, a Vaisya doing so should be fined 200 Panas, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">and a Sudra if he does so should be sentenced to capital punishment</span>. A Brahmana who abuses a Ksatriya should be fined 50 Panas, if he abuses a Vaisya, he should be fined 25 Panas <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">and if he abuses a Sudra the fine should be 12 Panas</span>.” Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 8.279-280 With whatever limb a man of a low caste does hurt to (a man of the three) highest (castes), even that limb shall be cut off; that is the teaching of Manu. He who raises his hand or a stick, shall have his hand cut off; he who in anger kicks with his foot, shall have his foot cut off.</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>If a Shudra is accused of committing some crimes, then he should prove his innocence by drinking poison, by means of fire ordeals etc.,</p>
<p>Agni Purana 255.32-47 “The accused should fast and bathe at sunrise with all his clothes on the day of the test, and pass through his ordeal in the presence of the king and the Brahmanas. An old, infant, blind, lame, invalid, or a female accused should be tested with the ordeal by scale, while the innocence of a Shudra, should be ascertained by means of the ordeal by fire, water, or the seven Yava (barley) weights of poison… In the ordeal by fire, the palms of the accused, should be first examined as to whether it had not been plastered over with clay… Then the accused should address the fire god as follows:- ”Thy seat is in the inside of all creatures, O Fire, and thou art the witness of acts of merit and demerit. I have held thee in my palms, speak truth, O god, as a witness of my innocence.” Then a red hot iron ball, weighing fifty Palas should be placed on his palms, covered as above and the accused or the person suspected, should be asked to slowly walk over seven Mandalas or rings… In an ordeal by poison, the accused should first address the poison to be imbibed… Thus having addressed the poison (born of a hill), he should imbibe the same in the presence of the assembled Brahmanas. His innocence should be established, if he could assimilate the poison safely without rethcing or vomiting.” Tr. M.N Dutt</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 9.248. But the king shall inflict on a base-born (Sudra), who intentionally gives pain to Brahmanas, various (kinds of) corporal punishment which cause terror.</p>

<h1>Discrimination on food</h1>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="380" height="276" class="wp-image-8412 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Picture-8.jpeg" alt="https://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/dalits-water-dyuurwlxcaaj6n4.jpeg?w=380&amp;h=276" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Picture-8.jpeg 380w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Picture-8-300x218.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 380px) 100vw, 380px" /></p>
<p>Most of the crimes against Dalits is inspired by Hindu religious texts. There have been numerous cases where Dalit cooks were fired from their job because upper caste Hindus refused to eat food cooked by them, such as <a href="https://www.news18.com/news/india/up-students-refuse-mid-day-meal-prepared-by-lower-caste-cook-school-throws-out-food-after-protest-1871653.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">school children refusing to eat food<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> cooked by a Dalit cook and then threw the food, another <a href="http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-caste-hindu-parents-oppose-dalit-cooking-food-for-their-children-in-a-govt-school-in-tn-2639266" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Dalit cook was fired<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> after caste Hindu parent protested, a <a href="http://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/dalit-man-set-afire-for-fetching-water-at-hand-pump-in-mp/story-uUEGOUJbPUaqPivKfDdmfK.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Dalit man was set afire<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> for fetching water from a well, a <a href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/10-year-old-dalit-boy-thrashed-for-touching-mid-day-meal-utensils-in-rajasthan/1/490040.html" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Dalit boy was beaten up<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> for touching utensils of upper caste Hindus.</p>
<p>Forget about a Shudra eating with upper castes, a Shudra isn’t even allowed to eat cow dung and drink cow urine,</p>
<p>Apastamba Samhita 5.4 “Sudras should not be enjoined to drink Panchagavyam, inasmuch as they are not privileged to utter any Mantras. A Sudra, guilty of any delinquency, should regain his purity by confessing it to a Brahmana and by making gifts.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<h2>Eating remnants of Dvija master’s meal</h2>
<p>As per Hindu text the Shudra servant or slave must eat the remnants of his Dvija master’s meal,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 10.125 <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The remnants of their food must be given to him</span>, as well as their old clothes, the refuse of their grain, and their old household furniture.</p>
<p>Mahabharata 13.143.29 “As regards food, he should eat that which remains after the needs of all persons have been satisfied.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 5.140. Sudras who live according to the law, shall each month shave (their heads); their mode of purification (shall be) the same as that of Vaisyas, and <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">their food the fragments of an Aryan’s meal</span>.</p>
<p>Shudra here refers to those Shudras who are servants in the house of Dvijas and it also refers to Slaves. The Dvijas are not even allowed to give the leavings of their food to other Shudras,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 4.80-81; Vasistha 18.14 Let him not give to a Sudra advice, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">nor the remnants (of his meal), nor food offered to the gods</span>; nor let him explain the sacred law (to such a man), nor impose (upon him) a penance. For he who explains the sacred law (to a Sudra) or dictates to him a penance, will sink together with that (man) into the hell (called) Asamvrita.</p>
<p>It’s the highest level of hypocrisy, a Brahmin should feed his Shudra servant with the remnants of his meal but if a Brahmin accidentally eats the remnants of the food partaken by a Shudra or even in the company of a Shudra then he is to perform penance,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 11.153. But he who has eaten the food of men, whose food must not be eaten, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">or the leavings of women and Sudras</span>, or forbidden flesh, shall drink barley (-gruel) during seven (days and) nights.</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<h2>The penance for eating the remnants of Shudra meal is as follows</h2>
<p>Garuda Purana ch 231 “Articles of Indian bell metal, smelled by kine or defiled by the touch of residue of a Sudra’s meal, or by the contact of a dog or a crow, are purified by being rubbed with ten kinds of ashes. Having partaken his meal out of the saucer of a Sudra, a Brahmana shall regain his purity by fasting for a day, and by taking Panchgavya as well.” Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Garuda Purana 1.222.2 “If inadvertenly a brahmin takes food defiled by the Ucchista (residual of food partaken) of a Sudra he should fast for a day and night and drink Pancagavya. He shall be purified.” Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Atri Samhita 1.72 “By taking forbidden food, the residue of a food partaken of by a Sudra or a woman, or by eating forbidden meat, one should drink the extract of barley for seven nights. [74] By being touched by castes that should not be touched, one should bathe. He, who takes the residue of their food, should perform a distressing penance for six months.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti 51.57-58 “Having eaten the food of a Chandala, one shall fast for three nights. A Paraka penance is the expiation for eating the cooked food of a Chandala.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>For those who don’t know about Panchagavya. Let me tell you Panchagavya is the mixture of five products of cow, they are cow dung, urine, milk, curd and ghee. The leavings of a Shudra is considered so worst, And ironically it is cleansed by consuming cow urine and dung. Shudras are much worst than animal’s dung and urine as per Hindu text. Apastamba allows Dvija to partake the food cooked by a Shudra. Dayanand Saraswati had also used this verse from Apastamba to support his view that food cooked by a Shudra in the house of a Brahmin may be eaten. But Dayanand is said to have refused to partake the food in a Brahmin’s house that was cooked by a Shudra. So he didn’t practice it himself then how can he advocate this to others. As I said earlier, trying to give rights to low castes was a drama just to get followers. Dayanand didn’t abolish the evil Vedic caste system but upheld it. Read the article <a href="/index.php/2014/05/01/mulshankar-and-casteism/" data-wpel-link="internal">Mulshankar and Casteism</a>. As Dayanand had used the verse from Apastamba to support his view, let me quote a verse from Apastamba prohibiting it,</p>
<p>Apastamba Dharma Sutra 1.6.18. According to some (food offered by people) of any caste, who follow the laws prescribed for them, except that of Sudras, may be eaten.</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<h2>Eating food in the company or in the house of a low caste is prohibited</h2>
<p>Mahabharata 13.136.20-22 “<span style="color: #ff0000;">The Brahmana who takes his food in the company of Sudras is purged from all impurity by duly observing the ceremonies of purification</span>. The Brahmana who takes his food in the company of Vaisyas is absolved from sin by living on alms for three successive nights. If a Brahmana takes his food with Kshatriyas, he should make expiation by bathing with his clothes on.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Angiras Samhita 1.4 “When one drinks water lying stale in a vessel in the house of a lowcaste person, he should perform a penance. [7] By drinking, unknowingly, water from degraded castes, a Brahmana, fasting for a day and night, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">becomes purified with the Panchagavya</span>.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dath</p>
<p>Likhita Samhita verse 70 “By unwillingly partaking of boiled rice (lit. any kind of food) in a Chandala’s house, as well as of that prepared by a fallen or degraded person, one should live on water alone for a fortnight. The term of the penance should be extended to a month in cases where the delinquency has been knowingly committed.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<h2>Eating food cooked by low caste</h2>
<p>Other Hindu texts doesn’t prohibit a Brahmin from partaking food in the company of upper three castes (Brahmin, Kshatriya and Vaishya) but it clearly prohibits them from partaking food with Shudra (Anarya) and Mleccha (Non Hindus).</p>
<p>Angiras Samhita 1.48 “He, who continually partakes of a Sudra’s food for one month, becomes a Sudra in this birth and is born as a dog after death.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Brahma Purana 115.24 ”The food cooked by a Sudra is despised by gods and noble men, O goddess. That which is uttered by Brahma is authoritative.” Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 4.223. A Brahmana who knows (the law) must not eat cooked food (given) by a Sudra who performs no Sraddhas; but, on failure of (other) means of subsistence, he may accept raw (grain), sufficient for one night (and day).</p>
<p>Garuda Purana 1.115.7. ”Women perish due to their beauty, penance due to fury, the way due to an undue length and pious brahmana by taking sudra’s food.” Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Kurma Purana II.17.1 ”A Brahmana should not eat food offered by a Sudra whether out of delusion or otherwise. He who eats it, except an emergency, is born as a Sudra.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Narada Purana I.26.33 “One should avoid even from a distance, the wind from the winnowing basket, the smoke from the burning corpse, eating the cooked food of a Sudra and the contact with the paramour of a Sudra woman.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Atri Samhita 1.195-6 “A washerman, a cobbler, an actor, a Varuda, a Kaivarta, a Meda, and a Bhilla these seven are known in the Smriti, as degraded castes. By knowing their women, taking their food and accepting gifts from them, if willingly one should perform Prajapatya for a year; and, if unknowingly, two Chandrayanas.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Atri Samhita 1.168-173 “A twice-born person, who take food from a washer-man or from an actor, or from one who lives on bamboo work, should perform a Chandrayana. By knowing women of lowcastes, taking their meals and lying with them on the same bed, one should get [himself] purified with a Paraka. By drinking the water [that lies’ in a Chandala’s vessel, the foremost of the twice-born should live, for thirty-seven days, on barley and the urine of a cow. A Brahmana, who unknowingly partakes of cooked food touched by outcastes or by women in [their] menses, should perform half a Prajapatya. The [following are the means of] expiation for the four castes when they [happen to] partake of a Chandala’s food. A Brahmana should perform a Chandrayana; and a Kshatriya, a Santapanam. A Vaisya should perform a penance and live on the Panchagavya for six nights. A Sudra should perform [the same] for three nights and purify [himself] by making gifts.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Atri Samhita 1.248 “By knowingly drinking water from the Sudras, a Brahmana should fast for a day and night and [then] after bathing, should get [himself] purified with the Panchagavya.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Atri Samhita 1.208 “The celestials do not partake of the food nor drink the water offered by the foremost of the twice-born, who eats the food of a drunkard or of a Chandala.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Apastamba Samhita 9.40 “A Brahmana, drinking water in touch with a Chandala, should regain his purity by fasting for a day and night and by bathing thrice during the fast.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Angiras Samhita 1.53-55 “If a twice-born person, being fed by a Sudra’s food, procreates sons, those sons belong to him (i.e., the Sudra who gives the food): for semen originates from food. Any article touched by a Sudra, or any residue of his food, should not be given to a twice-born out of carelessness or with the one palm. So the ascetic Apastamva has said. One may always take a Brahmana’s food; a Kshatriya’s, on Parva-days; a Vaisya’s, in times of calamity; but never a Sudra’s.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<h2>A Dvija is punished for dying with the food of a Shudra in his stomach</h2>
<p>Mahabharata 13.143.18 “The food of a Sudra, O goddess, is always disapproved of by the high-souled deities. Even this, I think, is the authority enunciated by the Grandsire with his own mouth. If a Brahmana, who has set up the sacred fire and who performs sacrifices, were to die with any portion of a Sudra’s food remaining undigested in his stomach, he is sure to take birth in his next life as a Sudra.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Vasistha Dharma Shastra 6.27-28 <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">If a Brahmana dies with the food of a Sudra in his stomach, he will become a village pig (in his next life)</span> or be born, in the family of that (Sudra). For though a (Brahmana) whose body is nourished by the essence of a Sudra’s food may daily recite the Veda, though he may offer (an Agnihotra) or mutter (prayers, neverthless) he will not find the path that leads upwards.</p>
<p>Vyasa Samhita 4.64 “He, who dies with a Sudra’s boiled rice in his stomach, is sure to be reborn as a hog, and all his progeny will belong to the same genus, after death.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Skanda Purana VII.I.223.50 “If a Brahmana dies with the food offered by a Sudra remaining undigested within his belly he certainly becomes a Preta even if he has learned all the six Angas of the Vedas.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Preta means ghost.</p>
<p>Skanda Purana V.iii.11.30-31 ”Brahamana’s food is (regarded as) Amrta (Nectar); Ksatriya’s food is remembered as milk; Vaisya’s food is mere food, and Sudra’s food is proclaimed as blood. Those excellent Brahmanas who get nourished with Sudra’s food and juice and later die, become deprived of Tapas and knowledge and are born as crows and vultures.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Varaha Purana 174.42 ”He who dies with the food given by a Sudra within him, becomes a ghost.” Tr. Venkitasubramonia Iyer, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Mahabharata 13.141.38 “Another duty of the Brahmana consists in avoiding the food prepared by the Sudra.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Vasistha Dharma Sutra 10.31; 20.17; Skanda Purna V.iii.50.6-8 also prohibits the twice born from partaking the food of Shudras.</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<h2>Vessels touched by low caste becomes unclean &amp; also prohibition to use utensils of Shudras</h2>
<p>Usana Samhita 9.49 “By drinking water touched by a Chandala, the foremost of the twice-born becomes purified [by fasting] for three nights or by taking the Panchagavyam.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Samvarta Samhita verse 30 “He, who takes his food or drink from a Sudra’s hands, should get himself purified with the Panchagavya after fasting for a day and night. [32] By taking food in a vessel belonging to a Sudra or in a broken plate, one should get himself purified with the Panchagavya after fasting for a day and night.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Parasara Smriti 7.24 Vessels of bell metal, smelled by kine, or defiled by the touch of dogs, crows, etc., or out of which Sudras have taken their food, should be purified by rubbing them with ten kings of ashes.</p>
<p>Vyasa Samhita 3.53 “Boiled rice procured with one’s own earnings, or kept in a vessel which is not defiled by the touch of wine, nor licked by a dog, nor smelled by a cow, nor touched by a crow or a Sudra, is always pure.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Samvarta Samhita verse 194 “By taking food from the vessel of a degraded caste, or from that of a woman in menses, one would become purified, in half-a-month, by living upon barley and the urine of a cow.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Samvarta Samhita verses 182 “By drinking well water contaminated by a Chandala’s vessel, one becomes purified by living on barley and the urine of a cow for three nights.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>

<p>Parasara Smriti 6.24 “Having drunk the water of a well which has been defiled by the touch of a Chandalas water pot, a Brahmana should live on barley and cow’s urine for three days, whereby he would regain his personal cleanness.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Apastamba Samhita 2.2 “Having drunk water in a Prapa, or that lieing accumulated in a forest or in the furrows of a ploughed field, as well as that which is flowing out of a pond, or is owned by a Svapak or a Chandala, one should regain one’s purity by drinking Panchagavyam. [5] Having drunk water out of, or bathed in, a well or tank, caused to be excavated by another, one should regain one’s purity by drinking Panchagavyam.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>

<h2>Leftover food of Shraddhas to Shudras</h2>
<p>Guess what? Hinduism doesn’t even permit the Shudras to eat the leavings of a Shraddha,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 3.249 The foolish man who, after having eaten a Sraddha (-dinner), gives the leavings to a Sudra, falls headlong into the Kalasutra hell.</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana 2.3.15.56 ”The leavings of food from a Sraddha should not be given to women or Sudras.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Out of compassion a Brahmin may give the fragments of his Shraddha meal to his Shudra servant but never to other Shudras.</p>
<p>A sacrifice called Bhuta Yajna can be performed with the remaining food (not leftover food) and this is to be given to dogs, pigs and Chandalas,</p>
<p>Markandeya Purana 29.45-46 “Having done reverence to the gods, and the pitri and guests, relatives likewise, and female relations, and gurus also, the griha stha who has substance <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">should scatter the fragments on the ground for both dogs and low caste men and birds</span>.”</p>
<p>Kurma Purana II.18.105-6 “With the cooked food that remains after the offering unto Devas, one should offer Bhuta Bali. This should be known as Bhuta Yajna. It is the bestower of prosperity unto all embodied beings. O excellent Brahmanas, the cooked food should be given to dogs, cooker of dogs (i.e. Candalas), fallen persons (i.e. outcastes) and birds, on the ground outside.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 3.92. Let him gently place on the ground (some food) for dogs, outcasts, Kandalas (Svapak), those afflicted with diseases that are punishments of former sins, crows, and insects.</p>

<h2>Shudra’s food at sacrifices</h2>
<p>It is mentioned in Smritis that the food offered to gods and manes will not be accepted if the sacrifice is assisted by the Shudra wife,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 3.18 ”The oblations, offered by a twice-born one who is assisted by a Sudra woman in the capacity of his principal married wife in the rite of a Pitri or Daivaa Sraddha ceremony, neither the manes, nor the divinity partake of. Even by practicing hospitality to Atithis, he cannot ascend to heaven, after death.” Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti 26.7 The gods and Pitris do not accept the oblations offered to them by (twice born ones), who perform the Daiva and Pritri (sacrifices), or propitiate the Atithis, in the company of their Sudra wives; such men go to hell.</p>
<p><a href="#top" class="broken_link">top</a></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<h1>Barred from sacrifices</h1>
<p>It is mentioned in Veda,</p>
<p>Krishna Yajur Veda 7.1.1.5 [After it the Anustubh metre] was created, the Vairaja Saman, of men the Çudra, of cattle the horse. Therefore the two, the horse and the Çudra, are dependent on others. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Therefore the Çudra is not fit for the sacrifice</span>, for he was not created after any gods.</p>
<p>Shudra is prohibited to participate in sacrifice just because of his birth in a Shudra family and one of the main reason behind Shudra been prohibited to participate in sacrifice is because it includes recitation of Vedic mantras and Shudras are clearly prohibited from uttering any Vedic mantra. Adi Shanakaracharya writes,</p>
<p>”But this scriptural ability is denied by the prohibition of the right to study. As for the text, ”The Sudra is unfit for performing a sacrifice” (Tai. S.VII.i.1.6), since it is based on a logic having common application, it suggests that the Sudra has no right to knowledge as well, for the logic applies both ways.” <strong>Shankaracharya on Brahma Sutra 1.3.34, Tr. Swami Gambhiranand</strong></p>
<p>It is mentioned in Brahmana,</p>
<p>Pancavimsa Brahmana 6.1.11 Out of his feet, his firm support, he created the twenty one fold (stoma); along with it of the metres the anustubh came into existence, of the deities none, of the men the Sudra. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Therefore the Sudra is, it is true, rich in cattle, but excluded from the sacrifice</span>, for he has no deity, as no deity had come into existence after him.</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Kailasa Samhita 6.12.22 ”The Vedas enjoin rituals for the first three castes. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Sudras are excluded since their only activity is service</span>.” Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Mahabharata 5.29.26 “The following are the duties declared for a Sudra from the olden times. He should serve the Brahmanas and submit to them; <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">should not study; sacrifices are forbidden to him</span>; he should be diligent and be constantly enterprising in doing all that is for his good. The king protects all these with (proper) care, and sets all the castes to perform their respective duties. He should not be given to sensual enjoyments. He should be impartial, and treat all his subjects on an equal footing.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 11.13. (Or) the (sacrificer) may take at his pleasure two or three (articles required for a sacrifice) from the house of a Sudra; <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">for a Sudra has no business with sacrifices</span>.</p>
<p>Mahabharata 12.165.8 “<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The Sudra has no competence for performing a sacrifice</span>. The king should, therefore, take away (wealth for such a purpose) from a Sudra house of ours.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Varaha Purana 211.4 ”Three castes participate in sacrifices and share their benefits in general. The Sudras are kept out by Brahmins from those that are purified by Vedas.” Tr. Venkitasubramonia Iyer, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Mahabharata 13.91.43-44 “From the place where the Sraddha is being performed, the Chandala and the Swapacha should be excluded, as also all who wear clothes steeped in yellow, and persons affected with leprosy, or one who has been excasted (for transgressions), or one who is guilty of Brahmanicide, or a Brahmana of mixed descent or one who is the relative of an excasted man. These all should be excluded by persons possessed of wisdom from the place where a Sraddha is being performed…” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Vayu Purana Part 2, 16.24 ”The naked and similar (apostates and non-Vedic sects) people should not see the Sraddha rite. This is the rule. Such Sraddhas as are seen by these, do not reach PItrs or Pitamahas.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Ganesh Vasudeo Tagare writes,</p>
<p>”…The text not only includes non Vedic sects like Jains and Buddhists but includes apostate Brahmins, atheists, committer of gross sins (maha-patakas).</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana 2.3.11.87 <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">”The following should always be avoided in the Sraddha ceremonies; Sudras</span>, milk of Avi (a variety of sheep), the varieties of grass named Balbaja, Virana and Otuvala, pebbles and Laddus (a sweetmeat?)” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Kurma Purana II.16.54 ”Instructions regarding observance of holy vows should not be given to a Sudra; a learned man should not expound Dharma unto him. No one should submit to anger and avoid hatred and passion.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Kurma Purana I.12.25b-26 ”The Almighty Lord created Brahamanas from his mouth and the Ksattriyas from his arms. The Lord created Vaisyas from both of his thighs. The grand-sire of the universe created Sudras from the pain of his feet. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Brahma created all castes excepting the Sudras, for the purpose of (performance of) sacrifices</span>.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Likhita Samhita verse 6 “The [three] twice-born castes have equal rights in both Ishta and Purtta works. A Sudra is entitled to [perform] Purtta [works] but not Vedic rites.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Manu 10.126. A Sudra cannot commit an offence, causing loss of caste (pataka), <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">and he is not worthy to receive the sacraments; he has no right to (fulfil) the sacred law </span>(of the Aryans, yet) there is no prohibition against (his fulfilling certain portions of) the law.</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 4.81 “The Brahmana, who gives religious instructions to a Sudra, or advises him to practise a religious vow, is drowned with that Sudra in the hell of Asamvritam (unrestrained darkness).” Tr. Manmath Nath Dutt</p>

<h2>Prohibition to perform sacrifice for low castes</h2>
<p>A good reply to apologists from Mahabharata,</p>
<p>Mahabharata 13.128.5 “That man who thinks it all right when a Sudra ignites the fire upon which he is to pour libations or who does not see any fault when women who are incompetent to assist at Sraddhas and other rites are allowed to assist at them, really becomes stained with sin.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Varaha Purana 112.16-22 ”One who receives Kapila as a gift from a Sudra should be considered as most lowly like a Candala. Therefore let not a Brahmin receive the offering from Sudras. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">They are to be kept far away like dogs during sacrifices</span>. They are discarded by the manes during new moon and full moon. They should not be spoken to and nothing should be received from them because they do only sinful deeds. Those (Sudras) who drink (the milk of) Kapila make their forefathers eat the filth in the earth for long. Note what happens to the Sudraas who feed on the milk, ghee and butter of the Kapila’s cows. They go to the terrible hell called Raurava. After living there for a hundred crores of years, they are born as dogs.” Tr. Venkitasubramonia Iyer, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Mahabharata 13.23.16 “Those Brahmanas who pour libations on the sacred fire for Sudras, or who are preceptors of Sudras, or who as servants of Sudra masters, do not deserve to be invited.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Narada Purana I.15.32b-34 “The Brahman who, on being invited by a Sudra, partakes of his food, should be known as a wine addict. He is excluded from all holy rites. That mean fellow who does the work of an attendant with the permission of a Sudra, incurs a sin equal to drinking of wine…” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Markandeya Purana 14.83 By receiving favours from an outcaste, by performing sacrifices for an outcaste, by constant attendance on an outcaste a man ever reaches the condition of an insect that lives among stones.</p>
<p>Markandeya Purana 15.1 For accepting anything of value from an outcaste, let a dvija be born an ass; but let him who sacrifices for the outcaste become a worm, on his release from hell.</p>
<p>Vamana Purana 12.86 “He who accepts Daksina from Candalas or Sudras, the priest and the person employing the priest to perform a sacrifice, every one of them is born as a big insect inside stone slabs.” Tr. Anand Swarup Gupta</p>
<p>Brahma Purana 108.37 “A Brahmana though well versed in the Vedas is born as an ass if he receives charity from a fallen person. [40-43]If he officiates at a sacrifice performed by a low person, he is born a worm and in the form of a worm he lives for fiteen years. Released from the form of worm he is born an ass and in the form of an ass he lives for five years; in the form of a cock for five years; in the form of a jackal for five years; then he is born in the form of man; then a jealous person; then an animal…” Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Yama Samhita verse 29-32 “…one who officiates as a priest for those to whom no such service should be given…all these should be carefully shunned at a Sraddha and [while making gifts].” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Gautama Dharma Shastra 20.1 Let him cast off a father who assassinates a king, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">who sacrifices for Sudras</span>, who sacrifices for his own sake (accepting) money from Sudras…</p>
<p>Usana Samhita 4.23-30 “The following are disqualified to be present at the Sraddha ceremony:- Those, who sell the Sruti; those who marry widows; those, who enter in to a locked room without the permission of the owner; and those, who officiate as priests for inferior castes; are described as out-castes.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Usana Samhita 9.56 “By officiating as a priest for servants, [or by helping] others (i.e., other castes) in other rites, by performing rites causing death to another person, and other unworthy deeds, [a Brahmana] becomes purified by three distressing penances.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>

<h2>Proof that Shudras were kept away from sacrifices</h2>
<p>Mahabharata 2.35.8-10 ”That (sacrificial) platform, crowded with the celestials, Brahmanas and the great Rishis, all endued with the Vedas, looked as beautiful as the sky studded with the stars .O king <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">there was no sudra or any man without vows near the inner (sacrificial) platform of Yudhisthira’s palace</span>. Seeing the prosperity of the prosperous and intelligent Dharmaraja, which was the result of that sacrifice, Narada became exceedingly happy.” Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Shudras are not allowed to participate in sacrifice or perform it. However Hinduism allows Shudra to perform minor sacrifices but without uttering any Mantra, they are to be kept away from sacrifices due to the fact that Shudras are not allowed to hear any Mantra,</p>
<p>Mahabharata 12.60 “Sacrifice has been laid down as a duty of the three other orders. It has been ordained for the Sudra also, O Bharata! A Sudra, however, is not competent to utter swaha and swadha or any other Vedic mantra. For this reason, the Sudra, without observing the vows laid down in the Vedas, should worship the gods in minor sacrifices called Paka-yajnas.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Other than the sacrifice to Manes, Shudras cannot perform any other sacrifice. As it is said that serving the twice born (Dvija) is equivalent to sacrifice for the Shudras,</p>
<p>Vayu Purana Part 1, 57.50 “Aranbha (expedition or enterprise) was a sacrifice for Ksattriyas. Havis (offering of ghee etc.) was the Yajna of Vaisyas. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Sudras had service as Yajna</span> and excellent Brahmanas had Japa (chanting of Mantras) as their Yajna.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Above verse from Vayu Purana is talking about the Treta Yuga. Treta Yuga is the second Yuga among the four Yugas or ages of mankind in Hinduism. It says that service to Dvija was the Yajna of the Shudras which shows that Shudras were not allowed to perform sacrifice in such earlier period also. However this is not just limited to the Treta Yuga but also applicable in the present Kali Yuga, it is mentioned in Mahabharata,</p>
<p>Mahabharata 12.232 “The growing of corn is the sacrifice laid down for the Vaisyas. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Serving the three other orders is the sacrifice laid down for the Sudras</span>.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p><a href="#top" class="broken_link">top</a></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<h2>Touch of dogs, pigs and low castes invalidates a sacrifice</h2>
<p>Manu Smriti 3.240-1 What (any of) these sees at a burnt-oblation, at a (solemn) gift, at a dinner (given to Brahmanas), or at any rite in honour of the gods and manes, that produces not the intended result. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">A boar makes (the rite) useless</span> by inhaling the smell (of the offerings), a cock by the air of his wings, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">a dog by throwing his eye (on them), a low-caste man by touching (them)</span>.</p>
<p><a href="#top" class="broken_link">top</a></p>

<h1>Difficult for a Shudra to worship</h1>
<p>Skanda Purana II.iv.3.35-37 ”He who worships and bows to the idols installed by Sudras, goes to hell along with ten ancestors and ten descendants. If one touches the idol worshipped by a Sudra, he will burn (get burnt) his family up to the seventh generation. Hence one must enquire and worship an idol that has been installed by Brahmanas.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Varaha Purana 186.49-50 “But a Salagrama should not be touched by men of inferior caste or by women and Sudras. If a woman or Sudra touches it even out of curiosity, the result will be torment in hell till deluge.” Tr. Venkitasubramonia Iyer, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Narada Purana III.67.33 “One should not worship an idol if it crooked, burnt, or broker, if its head is split, or if it is looking upwards, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">or if it is touched by an amyaja (outcaste) and others</span>.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>A Shudra is not even allowed to utter Om.</p>
<p>Narada Purana III.70.72-73 “This is called Visnu Gayatri which removes all sins. Tara=om., hrt=namah, then bhagavan ending in the dative case, then vausdevaya. This great mantra consisting of twelve syllables gives enjoyment and salvation. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">This is to be used without tara=om by women and sudras</span> but by the twice born it is used with tara=om.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>A Shudra should also avoid Vedic Japa,<br />
Narada Purana, Uttarabhaga 61.51-53 “The procedure for the holy dip and the repetition of Japas is, in regard to the three castes, the same as mentioned in the Vedas. O fair lady, in regard to the Sudras and the women the repetition of the Vedic texts is to be avoided…” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>It is mentioned in Mahabharata,</p>
<p>Mahabharata 13.23.7 “Food that has been eaten by a <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">person incompetent to utter the syllable Om</span>, or that has been eaten by a person bearing arms, O Bharata, or that has been eaten by a wicked person should be known to form the portion of Rakshasas*.” Tr. Kisari Mohan Ganguli</p>
<p>Kisari Mohan Ganguli writes in the footnote,</p>
<p>”* i.e., any food, a portion of which has been eaten by any of these persons, is unworthy of being given away. If given, it is appropriated by Rakshasas. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">One incompetent to utter Om is, of course, a Sudra</span>.” [ <a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m13/m13a023.htm" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Source<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> ]
<p>Skanda Purana V.iii.228.9 “The following six things cause downfall of women and Sudras: japa, penance, pilgrimage, renunciation of the world, practice of Mantras and initiation for the adoration of a deity” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p><a href="#top" class="broken_link">top</a></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<h1>Barred from studying Vedas</h1>
<p>Not even a single Hindu text permits a Shudra to study Vedas. Puranas explicitly says that since Vedas cannot be learned by Shudra and women, the God composed Itihasa (Ramayana, Mahabharata) and Puranas for them,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 1.4.25 ”<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The</span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;"> degenerated twice-borns, the Sudras and women are barred from the holy truths of the Vedas</span>, and, out of compassion for them, Maharshi Vyasa composed the Mahabharata.” Tr. J.M. Sanyal</p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 1.3.18-24 “…knowing this in every Dvâpara Yuga Bhagavân expounds the holy Purâna Samhitas. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The more so because women, S’udras, and the lower Dvijas are not entitled to hear the Vedas; for their good, the Purânas have been composed</span>…” Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>But Shudras should hear Puranas behind a screen,</p>
<p>Garuda Purana I.20.13-14 “None of the other classes (Vaisya or Sudra) is authorized to hear the Purana. If, by mistake, he narrates it to an unworthy person, he becomes the object of censure. But, if he narrates the Purana from behind the screen, then both the deserving and the undeserving person become worthy to hear.” Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Same is repeated in Natya Shastra, Gods along with Indra approached Brahma and said,</p>
<p>Natsya Shastra 1.12-13 As the Vedas are not to be listened to by those born as Sudras, be pleased to create another Veda which will belong to all the Colour-groups (Varna). ‘Let it be so’, said he in reply and then having dismissed the king of gods (Indra) he resorted to yoga (concentration of mind) and recalled to mind the four Vedas.”</p>
<p>Brahma Purana 64.19 ”In regard to the people of the first three castes the rite of holy bath and the reception of Mantras is in the manner mentioned in the Vedas. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The utterance of the Vedic passage is to be avoided by women as well as Sudras</span>.” Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Garuda Purana gives an accounts of sins that will lead to hell in chapter 4 and it says that if a Shudra studies Vedas then he will go to hell,</p>
<p>Garuda Purana 4.22 “The Śūdra who studies the letter of the Vedas, who drinks the milk of the tawny cow, who wears the sacred thread or consorts with Brāhmiṇ women. [23] Having come all along the path the sinful reach the abode of Yama, and having come, by command of Yama, the messengers hurl them into that river again.” Tr. Ernest Wood and S.V. Subrahmanyam</p>
<p>Parasara Smriti 1.64 “Drinking the milk of a Kapila cow, knowing a Brahmana woman, and reciting the Vedas are the acts, by doing which a Sudra is punished with hell.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Apastamba Dharma Shastra 1.1.1.6 (For all these), excepting Sudras and those who have committed bad actions, (are ordained) the initiation, the study of the Veda, and the kindling of the sacred fire; and (their) works are productive of rewards (in this world and the next).</p>
<p>It is mentioned in Bhagavat Purana that twice born men only are entitled for performing sacrifices and to learn Vedas,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 11.17.40 “All twice-born men — brāhmaṇas, kṣatriyas and vaiśyas — must perform sacrifice, study the Vedic literature and give charity. Only the brāhmaṇas, however, accept charity, teach the Vedic knowledge and perform sacrifice on behalf of others.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 7.11.13 “He is called a dvija or twice-born one whose (sixteen) purifying rites (accompanied by recitation of mantras) have been performed without any break in succession, and to whom god Brahma has designated as such. Performance of sacrifices, study of scriptures and charity are prescribed for all twice-born classes (viz. Brahmana, Ksattriya and Vaisya) who are of pure birth and conduct. It is for these that duties incumbent on different stages of life (asrama) are prescribed.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>But a Brahmin alone can teach the Vedas,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 1.103. A learned Brahmana must carefully study them, and he must duly instruct his pupils in them, but nobody else (shall do it).</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 10.1. Let the three twice-born castes (varna), discharging their (prescribed) duties, study (the Veda); but among them the Brahmana (alone) shall teach it, not the other two; that is an established rule.</p>
<p>If all the three castes have learned the Vedas then why does it differentiates the Brahmins, Kshatriyas and Vaishyas? As apologists claim that one who is learned in the Vedas is a Brahmin. And when Kshatriya and Vaishya are conversant with the Vedas then why a Brahmin alone should teach it why cannot a Kshatriya or a Vaishya teach the Veda?</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>

<h2>Scholars prohibiting teaching of Vedas to Shudras</h2>
<p>Acharya Medhatithi writes on Manu Smriti 2.241,</p>
<p>“Though the term ‘non Brahmana’ denoting all the three castes, except the Brahmana, stands for all men, yet the Shudra could not be meant here; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">for the Shudra is not entitled to learn the Veda</span>; and it is only when one has learn something that he can teach it. ‘But by transgressing the scriptural ordinance, the Shudra also might learn the Veda, just as the Ksattriya and the Vaishya do the work of teaching (which is not permitted).’ <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">This also cannot be; because it has been laid down that is the Shudra happens to learn the Veda, his body should be cut up</span>. And since the penalty is so severe, it follows that the act if a grievous sin.”</p>
<p>Adi Shankaracharya writes in the commentary of Gita 18.41,</p>
<p>“Sudras are separated from others who are all mentioned together in one compound word, because <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Sudras are of one birth and are debarred from the study of the Vedas</span>…” Tr. Mahadeva Shastri</p>
<p>Adi Shankaracharya also writes on Brahma Sutra 1.3.38</p>
<p>“38. And on account of the prohibition, in Smriti, of (the Sûdras’) hearing and studying (the Veda) and (knowing and performing) (Vedic) matters.</p>
<p>The Sûdras are not qualified for that reason also that Smriti prohibits their hearing the Veda, their studying the Veda, and their understanding and performing Vedic matters. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The prohibition of hearing the Veda is conveyed by the following passages: ‘The ears of him who hears the Veda are to be filled with (molten) lead and lac,’ and ‘For a Sûdra is (like) a cemetery, therefore (the Veda) is not to be read in the vicinity of a Sûdra</span>.’ From this latter passage the prohibition of studying the Veda results at once; for how should he study Scripture in whose vicinity it is not even to be read? There is, moreover, an express prohibition (of the Sûdras studying the Veda). ‘His tongue is to be slit if he pronounces it; his body is to be cut through if he preserves it.’ The prohibitions of hearing and studying the Veda already imply the prohibition of the knowledge and performance of Vedic matters; there are, however, express prohibitions also, such as ‘he is not to impart knowledge to the Sûdra,’ and ‘to the twice-born belong study, sacrifice, and the bestowal of gifts.’–From those Sûdras, however, who, like Vidura and ‘the religious hunter,’ acquire knowledge in consequence of the after effects of former deeds, the fruit of their knowledge cannot be withheld, since knowledge in all cases brings about its fruit. Smriti, moreover, declares that all the four castes are qualified for acquiring the knowledge of the itihâsas and purânas; compare the passage, ‘He is to teach the four castes’ (Mahâbh.).–It remains, however, a settled point that they do not possess any such qualification with regard to the Veda.”</p>
<p>Ramanuja Acharya writes on Brahma Sutra 1.3.38,</p>
<p>“38. And on account of the prohibition of hearing, studying, and performance of (Vedic) matter.<br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The Sûdra is specially forbidden to hear and study the Veda and to perform the things enjoined in it.</span> ‘For a Sûdra is like a cemetery, therefore the Veda must not be read in the vicinity of a Sûdra;’ ‘Therefore the Sûdra is like a beast, unfit for sacrifices.’ And he who does not hear the Veda recited cannot learn it so as to understand and perform what the Veda enjoins. The prohibition of hearing thus implies the prohibition of understanding and whatever depends on it.”</p>
<p>Madhvacharya first tries to say that Shudra can also study scriptures but later clearly prohibits a Shudra from studying Vedas,</p>
<p>“…For, in the text, ‘Let the Brahmana be initiated at the age of eight and let him be taught scripture,’ the ceremony of purification is mentioned as the immediate preliminary condition to teaching scripture. And in the case of the Sudra, the absence of this ceremony of purification is spoken of in the Paingin’s Sruti. ‘The Sudra has no consecrated fire, no sacrifice, no prayers, no ceremonies (to be performed); no process of purification, no austerities (to be practised). <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Hence the Sudra is not eligible for the study of Scripture</span>…Haridrumata having (first) concluded that ‘A non-brahmin is not capable of such truthful answer,’ (ib), and consequently Satyakama was not a Sudra, proceeded to perform the ceremony of initiation for him. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Hence the Sudra is not eligible for the study of the Vedas. For the Sudra is prohibited (from the study of the Vedas) as in the Gautama Dharma Sastra</span>, ‘The ears of him (the Sudra) who hears the Veda are to be filled with molten lead and lac, his tongue is to be slit if he pronounces it, his heart is to be cut open, if he attempts to know its meaning.’ And Smriti says, ‘the Sudra has no (consecrated) fire (to be maintained), no sacrifices (to be performed); so possibly he could not study the Vedas; however, free service to the three higher classes is prescribed for the Sudra, as the means of higher life’…” <strong>Madhvacharya on Brahma Sutra 1.3.36-38, Tr. S.Subba Rau</strong></p>
<p>Vijnanesvara writes in Mitakshara,</p>
<p>“Manu has also shown that the twice born alone are entitled to study the Dharma Sastras and a Brahmana alone can teach them and no one else.” <strong>Vijnanesvara in his book Mitakshara on Yajnavalkya Smriti verse 3</strong></p>
<p>Keshava Kashmiri writes on Bhagavad Gita 18.41</p>
<p>“…The Brahmins the priestly class, the <em>ksatriyas</em> or royal warrior class and the <em>vaisya’s</em> the mercantile and agricultural class are all spoken of in unison because they only have the right to initiation making them qualified to study the Vedic scriptrures, engage in <em>yagnas</em> or ritualistic propitiation and worship. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Whereas the </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;"><em>sudra</em></span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;"> or servant class are mentioned separately as they have not the qualification for initiation and study of the Vedic scriptures</span> but all are factually the product of their own innate natures.</p>
<p>To study the Vedic scriptures and perform <em>yagna</em> the prerequisite of initiation essential and required. A <em>sudra</em> is a fourth class citizen who may perform unauthorised activities without sin because they are only once born from the womb not twice born by the spiritual master. I<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">t is prohibited in the Vedic scripture to initiate a </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;"><em>sudra.</em></span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;"> If done it will bring calamity upon the spiritual master, his dynasty and the whole kingdom. There are direct references in the Vedic scriptures prohibiting </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;"><em>sudras</em></span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;"> from initiation</span>. Such passages as: The <em>sudra</em> carries the dead body to the cremation ground that is a <em>sudra</em> and if a <em>sudra</em> hears a mantra his ears should be filled with wax, if he recites a mantra his tongue should be cut out and if he memorises a mantra his life should be taken. So it can be understood that in ancient times the prohibitions of a <em>sudra</em> were strictly enforced…” <strong>Keshava Kashmiri on Bhagavad Gita 18.41</strong></p>

<h2>Prohibtion to teach Vedas</h2>
<p>Skanda Purana III.ii.6.79 ”One should never teach a Vedic Mantra to a Sudra. (Thereby) the Brahmana becomes deficient in his Brahmanical powers and the Sudra in his merit” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>It is mentioned in Manu Smriti that sacrificing for a lower castes, or assisting them in sacrifice and teaching them is prohibited,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 10.109-111 <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">On (comparing) the acceptance (of gifts from low men), sacrificing (for them), and teaching (them), the acceptance of gifts is the meanest (of those acts) and (most) reprehensible for a Brahmana</span> (on account of its results) in the next life. (For) assisting in sacrifices and teaching are (two acts) always performed for men who have received the sacraments; but the acceptance of gifts takes place even in (case the giver is) a Sudra of the lowest class. The guilt incurred by offering sacrifices for teaching (unworthy men) is removed by muttering (sacred texts) and by burnt offerings, but that incurred by accepting gifts (from them) by throwing (the gifts) away and by austerities.</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 11.181 “By sharing the same bed, or cushion, or by riding in the same car with, or by eating in the company of a degraded person for a year, a man becomes degraded’ by teaching the Vedas to such a person, or by officiating as a priest at a sacrifice instituted by him, or by contracting any marital relation with him, one becomes degraded on the same day.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Same is repeated in Vasishta,</p>
<p>Vasistha Dharma Shastra 1.22 Now they quote also (the following verse): He who during a year associates with an outcast becomes (likewise) an outcast; not by sacrificing for him, by teaching him or by (forming) a matrimonial (alliance with him), but by using the same carriage or seat.</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti 71.48-52 “Let him not teach lessons to a Sudra. Nor give the leavings of his plate or the residue of clarified butter he has drunk to a Sudra. Nor sesame. Nor instructions in religion. Nor in the mode of practising Vratas.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Skanda Purana V.iii.228.8-9”One should not give knowledge, leavings of food or Havis to a Sudra. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">He should not be taught righteous and pious rites nor should he be initiated in Vratas</span>. The following six things cause downfall of women and Sudras: japa, penance, pilgrimage, renunciation of the world, practice of Mantras and initiation for the adoration of a deity” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Mahabharata 13.10.66-70 “<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Unto Sudras, therefore, the Brahmanas should never give instructions</span>. Hence, O king, the Brahmana should avoid imparting instructions (to such as are low-born), for it was by imparting instruction to a low-born person a Brahmana came to grief. O best of kings, the Brahmana should never desire to obtain instruction from, or impart instruction to, a person that belongs to the lowest order<span style="color: #ff0000;">. Brahmanas and Kshatriyas and Vaisyas, the three orders, are regarded as twice-born. By imparting instruction unto these, a Brahmana does not incur any fault</span>. They, therefore, that are good, should never discourse on any subject, for imparting any instruction, before persons of the inferior order.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>Vasistha Dharma Shastra 20.45. Property received from outcasts, after forming alliances with them either by (teaching) the Veda (and by sacrificing) or by marriage, must be relinquished. Let him not associate with such (men).</p>

<h2>Shudras studying Vedas is one of the evils</h2>
<p>Shudras studying the Veda and performing sacrifice are some of the evils of Kali Yuga predicted in Hindu scriptures,</p>
<p>Linga Purana Section I.40.40-41 ”Some sell Vedas and others sell Tirthas (holy waters) i.e. make illegal gain out of these. When Kali yuga begins heretics will be born who will be opposed to the system of four castes and stages of life. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Sudras will learn the Vedas and will become experts in the meaning of Dharma</span>.” Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Tulsi Ramayana, Uttara Kanda, Doha 98A-B.1 Dominated by women, my lord, all me dance to their tune like a monkey controlled by its trainer. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Sudras instruct the twice born in spiritual wisdom and, wearing the sacred thread</span>, accept the worst type of gifts.</p>
<p>Kurma Purana I.30.21-22 ”In Kaliyuga, the Brahmanas, dependent on the Sudras, hover round and serve the Sudras seated in their vehicles and eulogise them by songs of praise and prayer. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Dependent on Sudras, they teach them Vedas</span>. Due to the calamity of appeasing those without Vedas, they resort to terrible atheism.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 273.46-47 ”Thenceforward all this world will fall upon very bad times. Men will be liars, greedy, and destitute of righteousness, affection and wealth. The religion of Srutis and Smritis will become very lax, and so also will be destroyed the orders and castes. The people will be of mixed origin, weak in body and will be led astray and deluded. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Brahmanas will sacrifice for Sudras (or will study under Sudraas) and Sudras will take to teaching Mantras</span>.” Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 144.40-42 ”Many with them profess to be Brahmajnanis, because, thereby, they will easily earn their livelihood. Some hypocrites will mark their bodies with Vedic symbols also. In the Kaliyuga any body will study the Vedas; <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Sudraas will be experianced in the Vedas</span>. So there will be many false religionists.” Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>Narada Purana I.41.54-55 “The Sudras will not serve the twice-born. Assuming the airs of heretics, the base-born assume and practice holy rites of the Brahmanas. The Sudras will clothe themselves in ochre-robes; they will have matted hair; they will smear ashes all over their bodies. Thus equipped and employing deceptive arguments, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">they will begin to expatiate on Dharma</span>. [58-] Occupying excellent seats, Sudras will expatiate on Dharma-religious duties-to Brahmans who habitually destroy Dharma. These and many other heretics such as nude ascetics (Digambaras), red-roled mendicants, will roam about; most of whom will be decrying the Vedas. [71] After the advent of the Kali age, Sudras and outcastes will become kings and the Brahmans will be engaged in rendering service to them. They will be begging for alms” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Vayu Purana Part 1, 58.46 “Then, when the end of the age approaches, even the great goddess like the earth will yield but little fruit. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Sudras will begin to perform penance</span>” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Mahabharata 13.94.11 “[Rishi Agastya said] That Time has come upon us. Hence, Righteousness is afflicted. It is meet that I should go to heaven for good, before unrighteousness assails the world and establishes itself here! Before the time comes <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">when Brahmanas, loudly uttering the fully Vedas, within the precincts of villages and inhabited places, cause the Sudras to hear them</span>, before the time comes when kings often against the rules of Righteousness from motives of policy, I shall go to heaven for good.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>

<h2>Shudras hearing or reciting the sacred text</h2>
<p>Hinduism prohibits Dvijas (upper three castes) from reciting Vedas in the presence of Shudras,</p>
<p>Narada Purana I.15.100-1 “<span style="text-decoration: underline;">I shall mention the fruits of sins accruing to those who engage themselves in the recitation and study of the Vedas in the vicinity of women and Sudras</span>. Listen to it attentively. They are compelled to stand with their heads down and legs upwards. Thus, they are nailed to two pillars and are compelled to inhale smoke continuously in this posture. They stay thus for the period of year of god Brahma.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 4.99. Let him not recite (the texts) indistinctly, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">nor in the presence of Sudras</span>; nor let him, if in the latter part of the night he is tired with reciting the Veda, go again to sleep.</p>
<p>Usana Samhita 3.65 “No study [is allowed] in a village inhabited by low-caste people, near an irreligious person, when cries are heard and where there is a multitude of men.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Vasistha Dharma Shastra 18.11-14 Some call that Sudraa race a burial-ground. There (the Veda) must not be recited in the presence of a Sudra. Now they quote also the (following) verses, which Yama proclaimed: <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">‘The wicked Sudra-race is manifestly a burial ground. Therefore (the Veda) must never be recited in the presence of a Sudra</span>. Let him not give advice to a Sudra’…</p>
<p>Apastamba Dharma Shastra 1.3.9.6 He shall never study in a burial ground nor anywhere near it within the throw of a Samya. [8-9] But if that place is known to have been a burial ground he shall not study (there). <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">A Sudra and an outcast are (included by the term) burial ground, (and the rule given, Sutra 6, applies to them.)</span></p>
<p>Linga Purana Section I.85.161 ”The repeater of the mantras shall not perform japa in the open street, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">or in the presence of the Sudras</span> or in a ground smeared with blood, or sitting in a cot.” Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Usana Samhita 8.72 “By reciting the Vedas, dharma-Sastras and the Puranas before the Chandalas, one is purified by the Chandrayana. There is no other means of redemption for him.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti 30.4-15 “For the whole day and night the Vedas should not be studied on the eighty or the fourteenth day of the moon’s (wane or increase)…Nor near the Sudras and the degraded.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">It is prohibited for a Shudra to hear the Vedas</span></strong>,</p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 11.15.11-20 “As a man of a lowest caste acts contrary <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">and incurs a sin if he hears the Veda mantra</span>…” Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Mahabharata 2.44.15 “Desirous of speedy death, this fool had desired Rukmini. But the fool obtained her not, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">like a Sudra failing to obtain the audition of the Vedas</span>.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>If the Shudra somehow manages to hear the Vedas then he is punished in the following way,</p>
<p>Katyayana Smriti verse 486 “The king should punish a sudra, who forsakes the order of sannyasins (after having entered it) and who intently practises japa (silent muttering of prayers) and homa, with death (or corporal punish) or he should be punished with double the fine.” Tr. P.V. Kane</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><strong>If a Shudra pronounces the Vedic text then his tongue should be clipped off and body must be mutilated, </strong></p>
<p>Gauatama Dharma Shastra 12.4-6 Now if he listens intentionally to (a recitation of) the Veda, his ears shall be filled with (molten) tin or lac. If he recites (Vedic texts), his tongue shall be cut out. If he remembers them, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">his body shall be split in twain</span>.</p>
<p>Atri Samhita 1.19 “The Sudra who engages in the recitation [of the Gayatri] and the offering of oblations to the Sacred Fire, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">should be killed by the king</span>; for by that he becomes the destroyer of the kingdom as the water is of fire.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Skanda Purana V.iii.200.6 ”It has been decided that for merely pronouncing the Veda (Vedic text by a Sudra) the tongue of that Sudra should be cut off by Ksatriyas who are the protectors of Dharma” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Brihaspati Smriti 20.12 (A Sudra) teaching the precepts of religion, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">or uttering the words of the Veda</span>, or insulting a Brahman, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">shall be punished by cutting out his tongue</span>.</p>

<h1>Proof that Veda was not taught to Shudras</h1>
<p>Skanda Purana III.i.10.32 ”The Sudra named Drdhamati came to the hermitage and was honoured by the ascetics. He prostrated in front of them with the eight limbs (touching the ground). [34-44] Then he felt inclined to perform an excellent penance. So he approached the Kulapati (Head sage of the hermitage) and spoke these words… O sage of good holy rites, initiate me in the Yaga rite. O Brahmana, I belong to the Sudra community, O excellent one. I wish to render services to you. Be pleased with me who have sought refuge in you. When this was spoken by the Sudra<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">, the Brahmana spoke to him</span>: <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">A Sudra being low low birth cannot be initiated in a sacrifice</span>. Be pleased to listen. If you are so inclined, be engaged in service. No (religious) instructions is to be given to one of low caste. In instructing him, the preceptor incurs great sin. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">A learned man shall not teach a Sudra, nor should he perform a Yaga on his behalf</span>… <span style="text-decoration: underline;">If a Brahmana were to teach a Sudra these subjects, the other Brahmanas shall banish him from the village, from Brahmana community. One shall abandon like a Candala, the Brahmana who instructs a Sudra</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">One should avoid from afar a Sudra who is literate</span>. Hence, welfare unto you. Render service unto Brahmanas with reverence. Service to the twice-born has been prescribed by Manu and others (as the duty) of a Sudra.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Drdhamati was not taught Vedas just because he belonged to Shudra caste.</p>
<p>Ramanuja Acharya and Adi Shankaracharya writes that Gautama Rishi started teaching Vedas to Jabala only after he ascertained that Jabala was not a Shudra. They also prohibit teaching Veda to Shudras</p>
<p>Acharya Ramanuja writes in the commentary of Brahma Sutra 1.3.37</p>
<p>“37. And on account of the procedure, on the ascertainment of the non-being of that.<br />
That a Sûdra is not qualified for knowledge of Brahman appears from that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">fact also that as soon as Gautama has convinced himself that Gâbâla, who wishes to become his pupil, is not a Sûdra, he</span> proceeds to teach him the knowledge of Brahman.”</p>
<p>Shankaracharya writes on Brahma Sutra 1.3.37,</p>
<p>” 37. And on account of (Gautama) proceeding (to initiate Gâbâla) on the ascertainment of (his) not being that (i.e. a Sûdra).</p>
<p>The Sûdras are not qualified for that reason also that Gautama, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">having ascertained Gâbâla not to be a Sûdra from his speaking the truth, proceeded to initiate and instruct him</span>. ‘None who is not a Brâhmana would thus speak out. Go and fetch fuel, friend, I shall initiate you. You have not swerved from the truth’ (Kh. Up. IV, 4, 5); which scriptural passage furnishes an inferential sign (of the Sûdras not being capable of initiation).”</p>
<p>Gautama Rishi started teaching Vedas to Jabala only after knowing that he was not a Shudra, this shows that Veda was not taught to Shudras.</p>

<h2>Teaching Vedas to Shudras was considered a taboo</h2>
<p>Sita the wife of Rama said,</p>
<p>Ramayana of Valmiki, Sundara Khanda 28.5 “I may be slain by that dreadful monster but I can no more give him my affection than a <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">brahmin can impart the teachings of the Veda to one of low caste</span>.” Tr. Hari Prasad Shastri</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 9.18.14 “And we are even more respectable because we are in the dynasty of Bhṛgu. Yet although this woman’s father, being among the demons, is our disciple, she has put on my dress, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">exactly like a śūdra taking charge of Vedic knowledge</span>.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 4.2.13 “To this proud, impious fellow who has given up performance of religious acts, and has violated all the bounds (of religious prosperity), I gave my young daughter though <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">reluctant to do so, as one would be to impart the sacred beautiful word (Vedas) to a Sudraa (who is not eligible to receive Vedic lore)</span>.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 10.38.4 “<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Just as recitation and study of the Vedas is impossible to a person born in the Sudra class</span>, I consider that gaining even the sight of Krsnaa of excellent renown is very difficult for me, inasmuch as my mind is addicted to sensual pleasures.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Mahabharata, Adi Parva 1.160 “How shall I be able to place this sole daughter of thy house–this innocent girl–in the way along which her ancestors have always walked? How shall I then be able to impart unto this child every desirable accomplishment to make him virtuous as thyself, in that season of want when I shall become masterless? Overpowering myself who shall be masterless, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">unworthy persons will demand (the hand of) this daughter of thine, like Sudras desiring to hear the Vedas</span>.” Tr.

<h1>Duty of a Shudra</h1>
<p>Garuda Purana ch 96 ”the sole duty of a Shudra is to render personal service to the foremost of the twice born castes.” Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 30.5 For Brahman (Priesthood) he binds a Brahman to the stake; for Kshatra (Royalty) a Râjanya; for the Maruts a Vaisya; for Penance [service] a Sudra;</p>
<p>Vamana Purana, Saromahatmya 22.38-39 “In its middle is a mighty Banyan tree, the embodiment of Sthanu. From Him have issued the castes, Brahmans, Ksatriyas, Vaisyas, and Shudras were born from Him to render service to the twice born…” Tr. Anand Swarup Gupta</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 3.8.33-34 “Attendance upon the three regenerate castes is the province of the Śúdra, and by that he is to subsist, or by the profits of trade, or the earnings of mechanical labour. He is also to make gifts; and he may offer the sacrifices in which food is presented, as well as obsequial offerings.” Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Narasima Purana 58.10-13 &#8220;The Sudra should serve all these three varnas and serve the Brahmanas like a slave. He should donate from his earning without asking for anything form others. He should do agriculture for survival. He should worship the stars every month as per the religion and justice and always wear old apparel. He should clean the pots used by the Brahmanas keep attachment with his own wife.&#8221; Tr. Joshi K.L. Shastri and Bindiya Trivedi</p>
<p>Sankha Samhita 1.5 Serving the Brahmanas, and performance of different handicrafts should be the specific duties of a Sudra. Practice of forbearance, truthfulness, and self-control, and cleanliness of body and spirit are equally obligatory on all, without any distinction of caste.</p>
<p>Katyayana Smriti verse 722 “One may make the sudra work as a slave, whether he be purchased or not purchased; the creator himself created him for slavery.” Tr. P.V. Kane</p>
<p>Mahabharata 13.141 “<span style="text-decoration: underline;">The service of the three regenerate classes constitutes the high duty of the Sudra</span>. That Sudra who is truthful in speech and who has subdued his senses is regarded as having acquired meritorious penances. Verily, the Sudra, who having got a guest, discharges the duties of hospitality towards him, is regarded as acquiring the merit of high penances. That intelligent Sudra whose conduct is righteous and who worships the deities and Brahmanas, becomes endued with the desirable rewards of righteousness.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 10.123. The service of Brahmanas alone is declared (to be) an excellent occupation for a Sudra; for whatever else besides this he may perform will bear him no fruit.</p>
<p>The same is repeated in Apastamba Dharma Shastra 1.1.1.7; Vishnu Smriti 2.8; Manu Smriti 10.334 and Yajnavalkya Smriti 1.120. Shudra’s duty is to serve the twice born but it is prohibited for twice born to serve low caste people,</p>
<p>Padma Purana V.9.40-47 …A brahmana should always avoid serving low people….</p>

<h2>Punishment for not carrying out his duties</h2>
<p>Parasara Smriti 2.16 By not in any way serving the Brahmanas, and by doing heinous acts, a Sudra becomes short lived, and goes to hell, after death. These duties are imperatively obligatory on the men of four castes.</p>
<p>Skanda Purana III.ii.40.56 ”If a Sudra created for service does not serve Brahmanas, nor does he give the means of sustenance (to them), Hanuman becomes angry with him.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>

<h1>Prohibition to intermingle</h1>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana 3:1:1:10. Let him not commune with every one; for he who is consecrated draws nigh to the gods, and becomes one of the deities. Now the gods do not commune with every one, but only with a Brahman, or a. Râganya, or a Vaisya; for these are able to sacrifice. Should there be occasion for him to converse with a Sûdra, let him say to one of those, ‘Tell this one so and so! tell this one so and so!’ This is the rule of conduct for the consecrated in such a case.</p>
<p>Samvarta Samhita verses 197 “By associating with an outcast for a month or a half, one would become purified, in half-a-month, by living upon barley and the urine of cow.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Parasara Smriti 6.43 “One should immediately come out of the room in which a Chandala has entered, and throw away all the earthen pots kept therein.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Angiras Samhita 1.49-50 “[Partaking of] a Sudra’s food, associating with a Sudra, sitting with a Sudra, acquiring knowledge from a Sudra, degrade even one burning with Brahma-energy. The twice-born person, who utters benediction before a Sudra and salutes him, that Brahmana as well as the Sudra go to hell.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Kurma Purana II.16 28-29 “The following eleven defects caused by mingling of the castes are called sins of intermixture (Samkarya Dosas) viz. sharing the same bed, sharing a common seat, sitting in the same row, sharing of the same vessel, partaking of the cooked food together, presiding over the sacrifices, teaching, marriage alliance, taking of food together, studying together, and jointly presiding over the sacrifices.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Inter-dining, sharing the same seat and doing other things together is a sign of civilization and a humane act while the Hindu scriptures views it as an evil thing.</p>
<p>Kurma Purana II.16.26-27 ”An excellent Brahmana shall not stay anywhere else except within half a Krosa of the holy river (1 Krosa=3 Km). He shall not stay near the village of the Sudras. He should not live in the same place with that of fallen castes, Candalas, Pukkasas, foolish fellows, arrogant persons, Sudras and the people of the lowliest castes called Antavasayins.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti 35.2-4 “He, who associates with an outcaste, for a year, becomes himself an outcast. Likewise, by riding in the same carriage, by sharing the same bed, and by eating (in the same row) with him.” Tr. Manmatha Nath dutt</p>
<p>Skanda Purana III.ii.6.76-77 ”Close association with fallen people is but conducive to one’s own fall. One should never offer a higher seat or rostrum to a Sudraa. (Thereby) a Brahmana becomes deficient in his Brahmanical powers and a Sudraa in his merits. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Instruction in Dharma to Sudras shall obstruct one’s own progress and glory</span>.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>A Shudra is punished if he sits on the same seat with a Brahmin</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 8.281. A low-caste man who tries to place himself on the same seat with a man of a high caste, shall be branded on his hip and be banished, or (the king) <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">shall cause his buttock to be gashed</span>.</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti 5.20 “If one (i.e., a low-caste man) sits on the same seat [with a superior caste] he, having his hip branded, shall be banished.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Varaha Purana 112.25-27 ”Once a Brahmin receives a gift from a Sudra, his ancestral manes fall into filth. No other Brahmin shall speak with him or share a seat with him. He is to kept afar. The Brahmin who, however, chances to speak with him or share a seat, shall perform Prajapatyakrcchra ceremony for purification.” Tr. Venkitasubramonia Iyer, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Vamana Purana, Saromahatmya 28.43-44 “At the time of creation Sankara was worshipped by the Lord on the northern bank of the Sarasvati known by the name Caturmukha. Having saluted Him with faith, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">a man is absolved of all sins, arising out of lustful intermixture of castes and interdining</span>.” Tr. Anand Swarup Gupta</p>
<p>Narada Purana I.41.33-38 “The Brahmanas and other castes get mixed with other castes mutually; all castes will be more or less like the Sudras, overwhelmed by lust and fury, confounded and afflicted by unncessary distress. In the Kali Yuga the excellent men become mean and the base men rise to excellence…Brahmanas become the pall-bearers of the Sudras…” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Narada Purana I.14.60b-62a “If one is touched by persons belonging to Candala and Svapaca castes, ablution (for purification) is enjoined even at night, but he shall not stay there with those low castes, at night, he will regain purity immediately after taking bath. If unknowingly a person had been careless enough to stay there (with low castes) at night, his sin is increased a hundred-fold.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Following verse shows prevalence of caste system under the reign of Rama,</p>
<p>Skanda Purana III.ii.30.93-94 “Ther was neither mental anguish nor illnes, O king, in the kingdom of Rama. All the women were chaste; all the men were devoted to their parents. Brahmanas were devoted to the (study of) Vedas always; Ksatriyas served Brahmanas. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Men of Vaisya caste continued to be devoted to Brahmanas and cows</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">There was no mixture of castes</span> and no transgression of duties. There was no barren or wretched woman; no woman had only a single child or had her child dead.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>This was the so called ideal state (Ram Rajya) of Rama.</p>
<p>Skanda Purana VII.I.206.6-7 “[Isvara said] If a Brahmana cooks food on behalf of a Sudra in the manner of Upaniksepa that food shall also be Abhojya (unfit for consumption) and the Brahmana falls down. The food of a Sudra, the association of a Sudra, occupying the same seat as the Sudra, and learning a lore from a Sudra – these will cause the fall of even the resplendent one.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>

<h2>Intermingling of castes is evils of Kali Yuga</h2>
<p>Linga Purana Section I.40.6-8 “Men perish. Ksatriyas and Vaisyas decline gradually. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">In Kali Sudras claim kinship with brahmins through their learning through interdining and sharing seats and beds</span>. Kings become mostly Sudras and they harass brahmins. Killing of foetus and murder of heroes become prevalent. Sudras adopt the conduct of life prescribed for the Brahmins and the brahmins adopt the ways of Sudras.” Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana 1.2.31.42 “Span of life, intellect, strength, beauty and prestige of the family dwindle down and become extinct. The Sudraas take to the conduct of life of the Brahmanas and the Brahmanas behave and act like Sudras.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Kurma Purana I.30.18 ”O tormentor of enemies, Sudras will be occupying lofty seats in the middle of Brahmanas. In Kali age, as a result of the influence of times, the king will dishonour the Brahmins.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Narasima Purana 54.44-46 &#8220;The Brahmanas, Ksatriyas, Vaisya and Sudra all will have over excitement and sensuality and reproduce a hybrid generation by mixing with one another.

<p>Hinduism prohibits inter-caste marriage to an extent. It permits a Brahmin to take wives of all four castes, but at the same time also prohibits to take a Shudra wife, Yajnavalkya and Vasishta are of the same view. However this has been interpreted by some scholars as, a Brahmin can take a Shudra wife but he should not have sexual intercourse with her in her ‘courses’ which can impregnate her, in other words it prohibits a Brahmin from begetting child on a Shudra wife, a Shudra wife is taken only for sexual gratification. As per Hindu scriptures a Dvija should take his first wife from his own caste and then of succeeding castes. A Kshastriya can take wives of his own caste, a Vaishya and a Shudra wife, a Vaishya can marry women from Vaishya and a Shudra caste while a Shudra can take only one wife from his own caste.</p>
<p>Gita 1.41-43 “By the prevalence of impiety, O Krishna, the women of the family becomes corrupt. Women corrupted, there will be intermingling of castes (Varna-Samkara), O descendant of Vrishnis. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Confusion of castes leads the family of these destroyers of families also to hell</span>; for, their forefathers fall (down to hell), deprived of the offerings of pinda (rice-ball) and water. By these evil deeds of the destroyer of families which cause the intermingling of castes, the eternal dharmas of castes and families are subverted.” Tr. A. Mahadeva Sastri</p>
<p>Madhavacharya writes on Gita 1.41 “When there is a resultant intermixture of castes due to the destruction of the family structure; those who are responsible are damned to hell; but not only these ruinous family members. Their forefathers are also sent to hell as well due to the cessation of the ritual offerings of food and water that are no longer given due to the fact that there no longer exist any male descendants to perform such rites”</p>
<p>Sridhar Swami writes on Gita 1.41 “When this happens there is an intermingling of castes and the ancestors of these destroyers of the family fall from heaven as they are deprived of their periodic ritual offerings of food and water.”</p>
<p>Kesava Kasmiri writes on Gita 1.41-42 “In regard to the result of undesirable progeny. The intermixture of castes that follow the family customs and honor the age-old Vedic traditions with those that do not causes a degradation in society and leads the family to a hellish existence. Not only this but the anscestors of such a family also suffer as well because there is no descendant qualified to perform the propitiatory rites prescribed in Vedic scriptures such as <em>sraddha</em> and <em>tarpana.</em> . Being deprived of these oblations due to the absence of qualified progeny as a result of destruction of the family structure the ancestors fall down from heaven and go directly to the hellish planets. In the previous verse the effects of the intermixture of castes as described in the Vedic scriptures regarding the ancestors has been determined. Now Arjuna describes the misery experienced for those who are responsible for causing this intermixture of castes beginning with <em>dosair</em> <em>etaih.</em> Due to these evils the essential duties prescribed in the Vedic scriptures for the four castes which are the authorised and proven means leading humanity to the highest good and which are faithfully instructed by holy sages and spiritual masters are all forsaken.”</p>
<p>Swami Nikhilananda writes on Gita 1.41-42 “…Mixing of castes – One of the evil consequences of the depletion of the number of men in society is that the women break the caste rules and traditions as regards marriage. Marriage outside one’s caste is considered irregular by the Hindu law-givers. Rice-balls and water- The reference is to the Hindu religious rites for the dead, known as the Sraddha ceremony, in which rice-balls and water are offered by the eldest son for the satisfaction of the soul of the deceased. This ceremony cannot be performed by children born of irregular marriages, that is to say, marriage in which husband and wife belong to different caste, Deprived of the rice balls and water, the soul of the deceased, according to Hindu tradition, goes to hell…”</p>
<p>Usana Samita 9.51 “By marrying in another caste (i.e., a Sudra maiden), one (i.e., a Brahmana) becomes a Mahapatakin (great sinner). By associating with such a sinner, one also becomes a sinner.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Agni Purana 150.14-15 A marriage should take place only between the members of the same class, the union of a person belonging to a higher class with one of the lower being always forbidden…” Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 9.34.32-91 “…This is a general remark; now hear everything in particular. O Chaste One! The Brâhmin wives of S’ûdras or the S’ûdra wives of Brâhmanas are Atyâgamyâs (very unfit to be approached) and blameable both in the Vedas and in the society. A S’ûdra going to a Brâhmanî woman commits one hundred Brahmahattyâs; so a Brâhmana woman going to a S’ûdra goes to the Kumbhîpâka hell. As a S’ûdra should avoid a Brahmâni, so a Brâhmana should avoid a S’ûdra woman…” Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Vamana Purana 35.21-27 “…intermixing in all the varnas (castes), abandonment of Omkara…marrying a low-caste woman like a Candala…all these entail suffering in hell.” Tr. Anand Swarup Gupta</p>
<p>Skanda Purana V.i.29.27-33 “…An uncivilized Brahmana who carnally serves a Sudra woman and one who marries a Sudra woman, both of them fall into the hell…” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Death Penalty for Intercaste marriage</span></h3>
<p>If a Shudra wants to marry a Brahmin women then he is given death sentence.</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 227.131 “If a low caste man wants to marry a high caste girl and does so would be punished with death; similarly a high class woman marrying a low caste man should be punished with death.” Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>Hindu texts award lesser punishment for a Brahmin man committing adultery but awards death penalty to Shudra if he commits adultery with high caste woman. It says that the Shudra must be burnt alive,</p>
<p>Vasistha Dharma Shastra Chapter 21 Verses 1-3 If a Sûdra approaches a female of the Brâhmana caste, (the king) shall cause the Sûdra to be tied up in Vîrana grass and shall throw him into a fire. He shall cause the head of the Brâhmanî to be shaved, and her body to be anointed with butter; placing her naked on a black donkey, he shall cause her to be conducted along the highroad. It is declared that she becomes pure (thereby). If a Vaisya approaches a female of the Brâhmana caste, (the king) shall cause the Vaisya to be tied up in Lohita grass and shall throw him into a fire. He shall cause the head of the Brâhmanî to be shaved, and her body to be anointed with butter; placing her naked on a yellowish donkey, he shall cause her to be conducted along the highroad. It is declared in the Veda that she becomes pure (thereby). If a Kshatriya approaches a female of the Brâhmana caste, (the king) shall cause the Kshatriya to be tied up in leaves of Sara grass and shall throw him into a fire. He shall cause the head of the Brâhmanî to be shaved, and her body to be anointed with butter; placing her naked on a white donkey, he shall cause her to be conducted along the highroad. It is declared in the Veda that she becomes pure (thereby).</p>
<p>Arthashastra of Chanayka Book 4 Chapter 13 A Kshatriya who commits adultery with an unguarded Bráhman woman shall be punished with the highest amercement; a Vaisya doing the same shall be deprived of the whole of his property; and a Súdra shall be burnt alive wound round in mats.</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 8.374 “For having sexually visited a woman of any twice-born caste, whether protected or unprotected by her husband, a S’udra shall be punished with the mutilation of his reproductive organ and a confiscation of all his goods and estates in the first named instance (i.e., for knowing an unprotected twice-born woman), and in the last named case he shall pay the penalty with his life and all his goods and estates will be escheated to the sovereign.” Manmatha Natha Dutt</p>
<p>Gautama Dharma Shastra Chapter 23 Verse 14-15 14. A woman who commits adultery with a man of lower caste the king shall cause to be devoured by dogs in a public place. He shall cause the adulterer to be killed (also).</p>
<p>Gautama Dharma Shastra 12.2 If he [Shudra] has criminal intercourse with an Aryan woman, his organ shall be cut off, and all his property be confiscated.</p>
<p>Apastamba Dharma Shastra Prasna II, Patala 10, Khanda 27 Verse 9 A Sûdra (who commits adultery) with a woman of one of the first three castes shall suffer capital punishment</p>
<p>Mahabharata 13.48 “It is only from sexual union of women with persons who should not have such union with them that mixed classes spring up.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Mahabharata 13.91.88.90 “That Sudra who has sexual intercourse with a Brahmana woman, has, after death, to take birth as a hog. As soon as he takes birth in the porcine order he dies of disease, O king. The wretch has next to take birth as a dog. O king, in consequence of his dire act of sin. Casting off his canine form he regains upon the exhaustion of his demerit, the status of humanity. The Sudra who begets offspring upon a Brahmana woman, leaving off his human form, becomes reborn as a mouse.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Garuda Purana ch 95 “A Brahmana is at liberty to take a wife from any of the first three social orders, or to put it more explicitly, a Brahmana shall marry a girl either of his own caste, or one belonging to the warrior (Kshatriya), or to the trading (Vaishya) community. Similarly a Kshatriya shalll marry a Kshatriya or a Vaishya girl, while a Vaishya shall take a wife from his own community, the marriage of a Shudra girl with a member of any of the twice born castes being hereby absolutely forbid.” Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Manu 3.14. A Sudra woman is not mentioned even in any (ancient) story as the (first) wife of a Brahmana or of a Kshatriya, though they lived in the (greatest) distress.</p>
<p>Some interpret it as, a Brahmin should not take a Shudra wife as his first wife. He can take four wives of succeeding castes i.e., first a Brahmin, second a Kshatriya and so on, His Brahmin wife is considered superior among wives of other castes.</p>
<p>Hindu text goes on to depict Shudra wives as sex objects when it says that a Brahmin can marry a Shudra only for sexual pleasure,</p>
<p>Vasistha Dharma Shastra 18.17-18 Let him not approach a wife of the Sudra caste after he has built the fire altar for a Srauta sacrifice. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">For a Sudra wife who belongs to the black race, (is espoused) for pleasure, not in order to fulfil the law</span>.</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti 26.5 ”The Sudra wife of a Brahmana can never be for virtue. She is only the object of enjoyment of a passionate Brahmana.” Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>The son of a Brahmin born to Shudra mother shall not inherit anything,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 9.155-6 The son of a Brahmana, a Kshatriya, and a Vaisya by a Sudra (wife) receives no share of the inheritance; whatever his father may give to him, that shall be his property. All the sons of twice-born men, born of wives of the same caste, shall equally divide the estate, after the others have given to the eldest an additional share.</p>

<h1>Segregation of humans into castes</h1>
<p>Hinduism even discriminates between the style of living. Nothing can be more disgusting than this,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 10.51-54 But the dwellings of Kandalas and Svapakas shall be outside the village, they must be made Apapatras, and their wealth (shall be) dogs and donkeys. Their dress (shall be) the garments of the dead, (they shall eat) their food from broken dishes, black iron (shall be) their ornaments, and they must always wander from place to place. A man who fulfils a religious duty, shall not seek intercourse with them; their transactions (shall be) among themselves, and their marriages with their equals. Their food shall be given to them by others (than an Aryan giver) in a broken dish; at night they shall not walk about in villages and in towns.</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>Hinduism also divides the lifestyle of persons belonging to different castes, it says all castes should dress differently, should have different names, should make houses differently, it completely divides their way of living,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 2.30-32 But let (the father perform or) cause to be performed the Namadheya (the rite of naming the child), on the tenth or twelfth (day after birth), or on a lucky lunar day, in a lucky muhurta, under an auspicious constellation. Let (the first part of) a Brahmana’s name (denote something) auspicious, a Kshatriya’s be connected with power, and a Vaisya’s with wealth, but a Sudra’s (express something) contemptible. (The second part of) a Brahmana’s (name) shall be (a word) implying happiness, of a Kshatriya’s (a word) implying protection, of a Vaisya’s (a term) expressive of thriving, and of a Sudra’s (an expression) denoting service.</p>
<p>Agni Purana 152.2-8; Vishnu Purana 3.10.8-12 ”The name of a Brahmin child should end with the term ”Sharma” (the happy one), the name of a child of the Kshatrya caste should end with the term ”Varma” (the defender or protector) <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">while those of a Vaishya or a Shudra child should respectively end with the terms ”Gupta” and ”Dasa” (slave)</span>.” Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>Manu Smriti 3.8-9 Let him not marry a maiden (with) reddish (hair), nor one who has a redundant member, nor one who is sickly, nor one either with no hair (on the body) or too much, nor one who is garrulous or has red (eyes), Nor one named after a constellation, a tree, or a river, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">nor one bearing the name of a low caste</span>, or of a mountain, nor one named after a bird, a snake, or a slave, nor one whose name inspires terror.</p>
<p>Hinduism also makes discrimination in marriages,</p>
<p>Agni Purana 153.1-4 “…A Kshatriya woman having been duly wedded, should hold an arrow in her hand, a Vaishya bride should hold a paddy measure while a Shudra girl should hold a cotton string in her hand just after the wedding ceremony had been gone through…” Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Method of building houses should also be different,</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 253.13-14 ”In laying the foundations of a building or digging a tank or well first it is necessary to test the nature of the soil before commencing the operations and lying Vastua. White earth is lucky for the Brahamanas, red is good for the Ksatriyas, yellow earth for the Vaisyas, and black earth is auspicious for the Sudras. This can be ascertained by digging. The earth tasting sweet is good for the Brahmanas…and astringent earth is good for the Sudras.” Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>Natya Shastra II.46-57 Direction of pillars (first to be raised) should be different as per castes</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>Garuda Purana 1.213.143 “The procedure of bath has been laid down thus by great men. While taking bath Brahmins, Ksatriyas and Vaisyas have to repeat Mantras. A Sudra has to observe silence during bath and perform Namaskara also silently.” Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Garuda Purana chapter 94 ”A member of any of the twice born castes, shall first take two draughts of water to rinse his lips with, and then cleanse his face with undisturbed and frothless water. The twice born shall purify their breasts, throats, palates and umbilical regions with water. It will be enough for women and Shudras to purify their regions of back and umbilicus.” Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>

<h1>Sinners will take birth as low castes</h1>
<p>Garuda Purana 4.58-63 Thus, it is declared, O Tarksya, that there are many torments for the sinful. Why should I explain them fully, when they are spoken of in all the S’astras? Being tortured thus, men and women by thousands are baked in dreadful hells until the coming of the deluge. Having eaten there their undecaying fruits they are born again. By order of Yama they return to the earth and become unmoving and other creatures: Trees, bushes, plants, creepers, rocks and grasses, these are spoken of as unmoving; enveloped in great delusion, Insects, birds, animals and fish;–it is said that there are eighty-four hundred thousands of fates of birth-fates. All these evolve thence into the human condition; having come back from hell <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">they are born in the human kingdom amongst low outcastes</span>, and even there, by the stains of sin, become very miserable.</p>

<h1>Response to Apologists</h1>
<p>Dalits suffered the Brahmincal oppression for ages then why suddenly some people has to show equality in Hindu scriptures instead of rejecting such anti Human scriptures? If Hindu scriptures really advocated equality for all then why did the Brahmins hid those verses in their dhotis? As I said earlier they have no sympathy towards the low caste people, all they want is votes and followers. In present age they cannot enforce their inhumane Brahmin laws moreover the constitution of India giving equal rights to everyone (including Dalits) is being one of the main reason some have started to show equal status (and also to present Hinduism in good light).</p>
<p>Akhil Bhartiya Kshetriya Brahmin Mahasangh criticized Baba Ramdev’s statement that “I have studied Vedas hence I am a Brahmin”<br />

<p>Converts to get caste, gotra of Hindu ancestors: Yogi Adityanath<br />
<a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Converts-to-get-caste-gotra-of-Hindu-ancestors/articleshow/45515721.cms" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Converts-to-get-caste-gotra-of-Hindu-ancestors/articleshow/45515721.cms<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>So Hindu scholars are still acknowledging the fact that caste is based on birth. The most common explanation given by Hindu apologists is that,</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><strong>CLAIM</strong>:- Hinduism doesn’t believe in caste system. Caste system was actually based on the profession, by the passage of time this system became caste system. It wasn’t based on their birth but it was wholly based on the profession acquired by the individual. If a Shudra studies the Vedas, he becomes a Brahmin.</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE:-</strong></p>
<p>I don’t need to refute this point, because the greatest scholar of Hinduism, Adi Shankaracharya had refuted this long ago,</p>
<p>“The pûrvapakshin maintains that the Sûdras also have such a claim… Smriti moreover speaks of Vidûra and others who were born from Sûdra mothers as possessing eminent knowledge.–Hence the Sûdra has a claim to the knowledge of Brahman.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">To this we reply that the Sûdras have no such claim</span>, on account of their not studying the Veda. A person who has studied the Veda and understood its sense is indeed qualified for Vedic matters; but a <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Sûdra does not study the Veda, for such study demands as its antecedent the upanayana-ceremony, and that ceremony belongs to the three (higher) castes only</span>. The mere circumstance of being in a condition of desire does not furnish a reason for qualification, if capability is absent. Mere temporal capability again does not constitute a reason for qualification, spiritual capability being required in spiritual matters. And spiritual capability is <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">(in the case of the Sûdras) excluded by their being excluded from the study of the Veda</span>.–The Vedic statement, moreover, that the Sûdra is unfit for sacrifices intimates, , because founded on reasoning, that he is unfit for knowledge also;”<br />
<strong>Shankaracharya on Brahma Sutra 1.3.34</strong></p>
<p>He also said in his commentary of Brahma Sutra 1.3.36,</p>
<p>“36. On account of the reference to ceremonial purifications (in the case of the higher castes) and on account of their absence being declared (in the case of the Sûdras).</p>
<p>That the Sûdras are not qualified, follows from that circumstance also that in different places of the vidyâs such ceremonies as the upanayana and the like are referred to.”</p>
<p>The statement that ‘Shudra becomes a Brahmin if he studies the Vedas’ is a white lie. Because not even a single Hindu scripture allows a Shudra to study Vedas. As Shankaracharya rightly pointed out that a Shudra cannot study the Vedas as learning the Veda requires one to go through the Upanayana ceremony and this ceremony is permitted only for upper three castes. Smritis gives instructions only to Dvija children but they doesn’t even mention about Shudra children, It is mentioned in Manu Smriti,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 2.35-40 According to the teaching of the revealed texts, the Kudakarman (tonsure) must be performed, for the sake of spiritual merit, by all twice-born men in the first or third year. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">In the eighth year after conception, one should perform the initiation (upanayana) of a Brahmana, in the eleventh after conception (that) of a Kshatriya, but in the twelfth that of a Vaisya</span>. (The initiation) of a Brahmana who desires proficiency in sacred learning should take place in the fifth (year after conception), (that) of a Kshatriya who wishes to become powerful in the sixth, (and that) of a Vaisya who longs for (success in his) business in the eighth. The (time for the) Savitri (initiation) of a Brahmana does not pass until the completion of the sixteenth year (after conception), of a Kshatriya until the completion of the twenty-second, and of a Vaisya until the completion of the twenty-fourth. After those (periods men of) these three (castes) who have not received the sacrament at the proper time, become Vratyas (outcasts), excluded from the Savitri (initiation) and despised by the Aryans. With such men, if they have not been purified according to the rule, let no Brahmana ever, even in times of distress, form a connexion either through the Veda or by marriage.</p>

<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>As you can see Manu only gives instructions about when Dvija students should be initiated but not about Shudra students, Yajnavalkya is of the same view,</p>
<p>Yajnavalkya Smriti verse 14 In the eighth year of conception or in the eighth (year of) birth, the Upanayana ceremony of the Brahmanas, of the Ksatriyas in the eleventh; of the Vaisyas in eleven plus one. Some say according to family custom. It is mentioned in</p>
<p>It is mentioned in Agni Purana,</p>
<p>Agni Purana 152.2-8 ”The rite of Chudakaranam (binding of the tuff of hair on the crown of a child) together with that of Upanayanam (investiture with the holy thread in the case of a Brahmana child) should be performed in its eighth year or in the eighth year counted from the period of jestation, while the same should be performed in the eleventh and the twelfth year (counterd from the period of gestation) in the case of a Kshatriya, and Vaishya child respectively.” Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Acharya Medhatithi writes,</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">“…</span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #000000;">Of these four, three castes are ‘twice born’, the initiatory rite being prescribed for them. </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">‘One caste’ is the Shudra; there is no Initiatory Rite for him</span><span style="color: #000000;">; since the injunction of this rite </span><span style="color: #000000;">contains the distinct mention of the three castes, Brahmanas and the rest; e.g., the Brahmana shall be initiated in the eight year, the Ksattriya in the eleventh and the Vaishya in the twelfth; and </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">nowhere is the name of the Shudra mentioned</span><span style="color: #000000;">…” </span><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Medhatithi on Manu Smriti 10.4</span></strong></p>
<p>Vyasa Samhita 1.5-6 “The term ‘twice-born’ denotes the Brahmanas, Kshatriyas, and Vaishyas. Only these three orders are entitled to practise religious rites propounded in the Srutis, Smritis and Puranas in exclusion of all other castes. The fourth order is the Sudra, hence the Sudras, are entitled to practise religious rites, but they are not privileged to recite any Vedic Mantras, nor to pronounce the terms Savaha, Svadha and Vashat.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Apastamba Samhita 5.3 “No expiatory penance, vow, Tapassya, or Homa exists for a member of the fourth social order (Sudra).” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Narada Purana I.24.19-27 “(The duties of a Brahmana are:) He should offer charitable gifts to the Brahmans; he should worship the gods by means of sacrifices; for the sake of livelihood he may beg for alms; he should teach others. He should perform sacrifices on behalf of those who are eligible for the same; he should perpetually offer water libations; he should learn the Vedas and maintain sacrificial fires…(The duties of a Ksatriya are): O excellent Brahman, a Ksatriya should give charitable gifts to Brahmanas, he should learn the Vedas; he should worship Devas by performance of sacrifices…O excellent Brahman, breeding of cattle, commerce, agriculture and study of the Vedas are glorified as the duties of the Vaisya also…A Sudra also should give charitable gifts, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">but he should not perform domestic sacrifices involving cooking. He should render service to the Brahmans, Ksatriyas and the Vaisyas</span>.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Narada Purana says that Brahmins, Kshatriya and Vaishya should study Vedas but Shudras should engage themselves only in serving the twice-born. As you can see Hindu texts gives instructions on when Brahmin, Kshatria and Vaishya children should be initiated for Vedic study but they don’t mention about Shudra children as Shudra by birth has no right to study the Veda, they are completely barred from the Vedas.</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><strong>PERFORMANCE OF SACRIFICE IS PERMITTED ONLY FOR THREE CASTES</strong></p>
<p>Manu Smriti 2.16 “He, whose all life, from the rite of Nisheka to that of funeral, is governed by the regulations of the Sastrass, is alone competent to read, or to hear this Sastra, and no other.” Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>

<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>Yajnavalkya Smriti verse 10 “The castes are the Brahmanas, the Ksatriyas, the Vaisyas and the Sudras. Only the first three (of these) are twice-born, the performance of the ceremonies beginning with the rite of impregnation and ending (with the funeral rites) in the cremation ground, of these only, is prescribed with sacred formulas.”</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti 2.2-3 “The first three of these are (called) twice-born. For them the whole number of ceremonies, which begin with the impregnation and end with the ceremony of burning the dead body, have to be performed with (the recitation of) Mantras.</p>
<p>Mahabharata 3.149 “while to serve the twice-born orders is said to be the duty of the Sudra. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The Sudras cannot beg alms, or perform </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">homas</span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">, or observe vows</span>; and they must dwell in the habitation of their masters.” Tr.

<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><strong>Another claim is that</strong></p>
<p>If a Brahmin doesn’t study the Vedas then he becomes a Shudra</p>
<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Brahmin whether learned or illiterate is still a Brahmin due to his birth</span></h3>
<p>It’s true to an extent. If a Brahmin doesn’t study the Vedas then he looses his rank. This is actually quoted out of context. When Hindu text says “loses the rank of a Brahmin”, it connotes degradation and losing the authority to perform rites. It doesn’t literary mean that the Brahmin just by refusing to study the Vedas becomes low caste. However there are expiations for all such sins in which the Brahmin looses his rank but there is absolutely no instruction which can elevate a Shudra to the status of a Brahmin in the same life. Can any apologist quote a single verse which says that if a Shudra studies the Vedas then he can become Brahmin in the very same life? It is mentioned in Upanishad,</p>
<p>Chandogya Upanishad 6.1.1. Harih, Om. There lived once Svetaketu Aruneya (the grandson of Aruna). To him his father (Uddilaka, the son of Aruna) said: ‘Svetaketu, go to school; for there is none belonging to our race, darling, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">who, not having studied (the Veda), is, as it were, a Brahmana by birth only</span>.’</p>
<p>As you can see, a Brahmin is still considered a Brahmin just on the basis of his birth even if he has not studied the Veda. For detailed explanation on this Brahmin loosing his status issue, read the article <a href="/index.php/2014/05/01/response-to-manu-smriti-and-shudras/" data-wpel-link="internal">Response to Manu Smriti and Shudras</a>. Hindu scripture rather says that a Brahmin whether he has learned the Vedas or not is still a Brahmin. It is mentioned in Mahabharata,</p>
<p>Mahabharata 3.199.88 “Whether the <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Brahmana be cognisant of the </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Vedas</span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;"> or ignorant of them</span>, whether they be pure or impure, they should never be insulted, for Brahmanas are like fires.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>How can one remain a Brahmin if is he is ignorant of Vedas? As it is claimed by apologists that one ignorant of Vedas becomes a Shudra.</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>Mahabharata and Smriti shows that even if one is ignorant of the Vedas then he is still a Brahmin due to his birth (in a Brahmin family). Mahabharata and Maharshi Manu lists learned Brahmin and unlearned Brahmin separately,</p>
<p>Mahabharata 12.180 “Thou, O Kasyapa, art a human being! Amongst human beings, thou art again a Brahmana. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Among Brahmanas, thou art again one that is conversant with the Vedas</span>.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 1.96-97 Of created beings the most excellent are said to be those which are animated; of the animated, those which subsist by intelligence; of the intelligent, mankind; and of men, the Brahmanas; <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Of Brahmanas, those learned (in the Veda)</span>; of the learned, those who recognise (the necessity and the manner of performing the prescribed duties); of those who possess this knowledge, those who perform them; of the performers, those who know the Brahman.</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 9.317. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">A Brahmana, be he ignorant or learned</span>, is a great divinity, just as the fire, whether carried forth (for the performance of a burnt-oblation) or not carried forth, is a great divinity.</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 2.118. A Brahmana who completely governs himself, though he know the Savitri only, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">is better than he who knows the three Vedas</span>, (but) does not control himself, eats all (sorts of) food, and sells all (sorts of goods).</p>
<p>This again implies that one need not study Vedas to be a Brahmin as it is all based on one’s birth. A Brahmin whether learned or unlearned is a Brahmin. Hindu apologists should know that a learned Brahmin is called Vipra. There is an example too in Puranas where a man born in a Brahmin family was still considered a Brahmin despite not knowing Vedas and engaged in sinful activities,</p>
<p>Varaha Purana 167.3-4 “Varaha said:- In Ujjayini <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">there was a Brahmin</span> who never cared for the rules of virtuous life. He never worshipped gods and never bowed to the saints. He never bathed in any holy tirtha. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">He knew neither the Vedas nor the Vedangas</span>. He was lustful and longed for the wives of others.” Tr. Vekitasubramonia Iyer, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Vyasa Samhita 4.41-43 “One, born of the seeds of a Brahmana but not purified with any of the purificatory rites or Mantras, and making use of his caste as a means of livelihood, is called a Sama Brahmana. A Brahmana, unto whom all the purificatory rites of Garbhdanam, etc., have been performed, but who has neither read nor taught any part of the Vedas, is called a Vruva Brahmana. A Brahmana, who practises penitential austerities and performs the rite of Homa, every day, and teaches the Vedas with their Kalpas and Rahasyas, is called an Acharyaya.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Parasara Smriti 8.11 “Brahmanas, who are ignorant of the Vedas, and Gayatri and Sandhya, and those who do not cast any oblation in the sacrificial fire and live by agriculture, are only Brahmanas in name.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Vyasa Samhita 4.33 “A gift should be made to an erudiate person living at a distance in preference to an illiterate on living close by one’s house. Nothing can be humiliating (insulting) to an illiterate Brahmana.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Usana Samhita 3.118 “An illiterate Brahmana, accepting funeral cakes, gold, kine, horses, lands and sesame seeds, gets consumed like a wood” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>

<p>Manu Smriti 2.157-8 “Like unto a wooden elephant or a leathern deer, a Brahmana, who has not studied, bears only the name of a Brahmana. As a eunuch is (sexually) fruitless (unsuccessful) in respect of a woman, as (sexually) fruitless is the meeting of two cows, as fruitless is the gift to an ignorant, so fruitless (is the life of a) Brahmana who has not studied the Riks (i.e., the Vedas).” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>Vyasa Samhita 4.37-38 “A Brahmana, who has not studied the Vedas, does, like a wooden elephant, or a leather-deer, but bear the name of the genus he belongs to. Like a deserted hamlet, like a waterless well, a Brahmana, who has not read the Vedas, is a Brahmana only in name.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>The above verses praises a learned Brahmin over an unlearned Brahmin just as it is mentioned in Manu,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 1.95-99 “Of the created things the animate creatures are the highest; of the animate creatures the intelligent ones are the highest, of the intelligent creatures men are the highest, and among men the Brahmanas are the highest. Among Brahmanas the erudite ones are the highest, among the erudite Brahmanas those, who think it their duty to perform the Sastric rites, are the highest, among the latter those, who perform such rites, are the highest, and among the performers of rites the knowers of Brahma are the highest. The Brahmana has originated as the eternal embodiment of virtue. His origin is for the furtherance of virtue; he becomes of the essence of Brahma. Born as a Brahmana, he wields the supremacy of the world, the ruler of all creatures, the custodian of the treasure of virtue.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 12.92. After giving up even the above-mentioned sacrificial rites, <span style="color: #ff0000;">a Brahmana should exert himself</span> in (acquiring) the knowledge of the Soul, in extinguishing his passions, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">and in studying the Veda</span>.</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>Apologists have one more explanation. They say if a Brahmin is of evil behavior or behaves like a Shudra then he becomes a Shudra. This is wrong because it is mentioned in Manu Smriti,</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>Manu Smriti 10.73 Having considered (the case of) a non-Aryan who acts like an Aryan, and (that of) an Aryan who acts like a non-Aryan, the creator declared, ‘Those two are neither equal nor unequal.’</p>
<p><span style="width: 18pt; height: 18pt; display: inline-block;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span> <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="458" height="136" class="wp-image-8416 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Picture-14.png" alt="https://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/manu-smriti-10-73.png?w=458&amp;h=136" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Picture-14.png 458w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Picture-14-300x89.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 458px) 100vw, 458px" /></p>
<p>Above is Rameshvar Bhatt’s Hindi translation. The meaning of this verse is simple, A Sudra by behaving like a Brahmin doesn’t become a Brahmin likewise a Brahmin by behaving like a Shudra doesn’t become a Shudra. This is based on Pundit Tulsiram’s interpretation and various other scholars are of the same view. I am reproducing Pundit Tulsiram’s translation with commentary of Manu Smriti 10.73,<br />

<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>It is mentioned in Mahabharata,</p>
<p>Mahabharata 13.151.20-23 “<span style="color: #ff0000;">Even the Brahmana that is destitute of knowledge is a god</span> and is a high instrument for cleansing others. He amongst them, then, that is possessed of knowledge is a much higher god and like unto the ocean when full (to the brim). <span style="color: #ff0000;">Learned or unlearned, Brahmana is always a high deity</span>. Sanctified or unsanctified (with the aid of Mantras), Fire is ever a great deity. A blazing fire even when it burns on a crematorium, is not regarded as tainted in consequence of the character of the spot whereon it burns. Clarified butter looks beautiful whether kept on the sacrificial altar or in a chamber. So, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">if a Brahmana be always engaged in evil acts, he is still to be regarded as deserving of honour</span>. Indeed, know that the Brahmana is always a high deity.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>There is another verse in Manu Smriti which refutes the claim of apologists.</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 10.96 A man of low caste who through covetousness lives by the occupations of a higher one, the king shall deprive of his property and banish.</p>
<p>If caste system is based on profession then why punish the low caste for living the occupation of higher one? Hindu text also says that in time of distress when one cannot make a living with the occupation of one’s caste can live by the occupation of other castes but it doesn’t say that by acquiring the profession of higher caste the Shudra becomes a Brahmin.</p>
<p>Moreover it is prohibited to change profession,</p>
<p>Vasistha Dharma Shastra 19.7-8 Let the king, paying attention to all the laws of countries, (subdivisions of) castes (gati) and families, make the four castes (varna) fulfil their (respective) particular duties. Let him punish those who stray from (the path of duty).</p>
<p>Atri Samhita 1.17 “The king, who punishes them who, renouncing their own religion, follow another’s, becomes glorified in the celestial region. By following his own religion even a Sudra enjoys the celestial region. Another’s religion should be renounced like the most beautiful wife of another person.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>And a Dvija can live by other professions also and that doesn’t change his caste,</p>
<p>Parasara Smriti 2.15 “Even an agriculturist Kshatriya should propitiate the gods and Brahmanas with the produce of his fields. A Vaisya, or a Sudra should always live by trade, agriculture, or handicraft.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Gautama Dharma Shastra 7.6-7 On failure of the (occupation lawful for a Brahmana) he may live by the occupations of a Kshatriya. On failure of those, he may live by the occupations of a Vaisya.</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 10.81-82 But a Brahmana, unable to subsist by his peculiar occupations just mentioned, may live according to the law applicable to Kshatriyas; for the latter is next to him in rank. If it be asked, ‘How shall it be, if he cannot maintain himself by either (of these occupations?’ the answer is), he may adopt a Vaisya’s mode of life, employing himself in agriculture and rearing cattle.</p>
<p>Agni Purana 258.80-83 “… A Shudra living like a Brahmana and performing religious rites exclusively belonging to the creed of the latter, should be liable to pay a fine of eighteen hundred Panas…” Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 7.11.16-17 allows a Brahmin to take Vaishya’s occupation but no where it says that by doing so the Brahmin will become a Vaishya. I don’t have to explain this as this verse speaks for itself. There is another such verse mentioned in Tulsi Ramayana,</p>
<p>Tusli Ramayana, Aranya Kanda, Doha 33.1 A Brahmana, even though he curse you, beat you or speak harsh words to you, is still worthy of adoration; so declare the saints. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">A Brahmana must be respected, through lacking in amiability and virtue; not a Sudra, though possessing a host of virtues and rich in knowledge</span>.</p>
<p>Krishna says in Gita that one should stick to the profession even if they are imperfect in it. Now you tell me if caste was based on profession then why it’s prohibited to change the profession? Have a look at what Krishna says,</p>
<p>Gita 18.41-48 “Of Brâhmanas and Kshatriyas and Vaishyas, as also of Sudras, O scorcher of foes, the duties are distributed according to the Gunas born of their own nature. The control of the mind and the senses, austerity, purity, forbearance, and also uprightness, knowledge, realisation, belief in a hereafter,—these are the duties of the Brâhmanas, born of (their own) nature. Prowess, boldness, fortitude, dexterity, and also not flying from battle, generosity and sovereignty are the duties of the Kshatriyas, born of (their own) nature. Agriculture, cattle-rearing and trade are the duties of the Vaishyas, born of (their own) nature; and action consisting of service is the duty of the Sudras, born of (their own) nature. Devoted each to his own duty, man attains the highest perfection. How engaged in his own duty, he attains perfection, that hear…<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Better is one’s own Dharma, (though) imperfect, than the Dharma of another well-performed. He who does the duty ordained by his own nature incurs no evil</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">One should not relinquish, O son of Kunti, the duty to which one is born, though it is attended with evil; for, all undertakings are enveloped by evil, as fire by smoke</span>.” Tr. Swami Swarupananda</p>
<p>Swami Prabhupada discourages ‘changing of castes’ and advises that a Shudra should remain a Shudra,</p>
<p>“Not that a śūdra man is by force become a brāhmaṇa. You cannot improve. That is not possible. But even if he remains a śūdra and does accordingly, he will get the same position as devotee. Sva-karmaṇā tam abhyarcya sam&#8230; [Bg. 18.46]. He&#8217;ll get the perfection. At the present moment the idea is: if one remains a śūdra, then he cannot get perfection. No. Even a śūdra can get perfection provided he does the work of a śūdra perfectly. Therefore why a śūdra artificially should be a brāhmaṇa? Let them, let him remain a śūdra, and if he follows strictly the rules and regulation of śūdra, he&#8217;ll also be as good as a brāhmaṇa. The same example: Just like head is as important as my leg. It is not that because it is leg, it is less important than my head. And if you ask the head, &#8220;Do the work of a leg,&#8221; it is impossible. And if you ask the leg to work as a brain, that is impossible. Let him remain brain, let him remain leg, and do your duty and you become perfect.” <strong>Room Conversation<br />

<p>It is mentioned in Manu Smriti,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 8.20-21 <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">”The</span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;"> Judicial officer of a king must be a Brahmana even if he be a mere Brahmana by birth</span><span style="color: #ff0000;"> (and bereft of the virtues of his order), </span>or a mere professional adjudicator of issues, and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not a Sudra under any circumstances whatsoever</span>.” Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>If the Shudra is competent enough, possess all knowledge then why a ignorant Brahmin is still considered superior than him just because of his birth as a Brahmin? Padma Purana VII.23.29 says that king named Nityodaya was a Shudra by caste but being a King didn’t change his caste. Caste system is not based on education, it’s based on birth. Normally a father would give best education to his child but Hindu text says that a son born to Dvija is still not Dvija if the mother belongs to low caste,</p>
<p>Mahabharata 13.47.17 “The son born of the Sudra wife should not be regarded as invested with the status of a Brahmana in consequence of his being unskilled (in the scriptures and the duties ordained for the Brahmana). Only those children that are born of wives belonging to the three higher orders should be regarded as invested with the status of Brahmanas.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>Apologists misinterpret Hindu text to show that some personalities attained higher castes. It’s true that one attains higher caste in the next life but in no way can one attain higher caste in the same life. As per Hindu text it is only in next birth that a man attains higher caste or is degraded to lower caste.</p>
<p>Apastamba Dharma Sutra 2.5.11.10-11 In successive births men of the lower castes are born in the next higher one, if they have fulfilled their duties. In successive births men of the higher castes are born in the next lower one, if they neglect their duties.</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 10.42. By the power of austerities and of the seed (from which they sprang), <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">these (races) obtain here among men more exalted or lower rank in successive births</span>.</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 9.334-5 <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">But to serve Brahmanas (who are) learned in the Vedas</span>, householders, and famous (for virtue) is the highest duty of a Sudra, which leads to beatitude. (A Sudra who is) pure, the servant of his betters, gentle in his speech, and free from pride, and always seeks a refuge with Brahmanas, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">attains (in his next life) a higher caste</span></p>
<p>Mahabharata, Anusasana Parva, 13.28 “…If born as human being, he is sure to take birth as a Pukkasa or a Chandala. Verily, one having taken birth in that sinful order of existence, viz., Pukkasa, one, O Matanga, has to wander in it for a very long time. Passing a period of one thousand years in that order, one attains next to the status of a Sudra. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">In the Sudra order, again, one has to wander for a long time. After thirty thousand years one acquire the status of a Vaisya</span>. There, in that order, one has to pass a very long period. After a time that is sixty times longer than what has been stated as the period of Sudra existence, one becomes a person of the fighting order. In the Kshatriya order one has to pass a very long time. After a time that is measured by multiplying the period last referred to by sixty, one becomes born as a fallen Brahmana. In this order one has to wander for a long period. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">After a time measured by multiplying the period last named by two hundred, one becomes born in the race of such a Brahmana</span> as lives by the profession of arms. There, in that order, one has to wander for a long period. After a time measured by multiplying the period last named by three hundred, <span style="color: #ff0000;">one takes birth in the race of a Brahmana that is given to the recitation of the Gayatri and other sacred Mantras</span>. There, in that order, one has to wander for a long period. After a time measured by multiplying the period last named by four hundred, one takes birth in the race of such a Brahmana as is conversant with the entire Vedas and the scriptures…” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>So no matter what you do, you should perform duties prescribed for your castes and only after few thousand years you can attain higher caste.</p>
<p>Some examples:-</p>
<p>Skanda Purana V.ii.22 A Kshatriya king was a Shudra named Somaka in one of his previous birth.</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 1.13.15 Yama was cursed by Sage Manduka and was born as a Shudra</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 7.15.72-73 Sage Narada was cursed to become Shudra from the womb of a maidservant and after his birth by serving the Brahmins he took birth as a Brahmana.</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Kotirudra Samhita 4.9.3 A Brahmin lady named Saumini had become an outcaste in her next birth.</p>
<p>Mahabharata 13.10 In consequence of the merit he acquired by those practices, the Sudra in the next life, took birth in the family of a great king, and in course of time became possessed of great splendour</p>
<p>Prabhupada writes on SB 4.30.48 ” In this connection the word mahad-avajñānāt is significant. King Dakṣa was the son of Lord Brahmā; therefore in a previous birth he was a brāhmaṇa.<br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">But because of his behaving like a non-</span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">brāhmaṇa</span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;"> (</span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">abrāhmaṇa</span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">) by insulting or disrespecting </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Lord Mahādeva, he had to take birth within the semen of a </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">kṣatriya</span> — that is to say, he became the son of the Pracetās.”</p>
<p>A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada on Bhagvad Purana 4.30.48 <a href="http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_4.30.48" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_4.30.48<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>As you can read, all these people attained higher or were degraded to lower caste only in their next birth. As it is mentioned in the Hindu law book Apastamba 2.5.11.10-11 that only in successive births men take higher caste or are degraded to low caste. And why should god assign this? Is Hindu god a job recruiter who commands that people born in specific caste must perform specific job. Dr. B.R. Ambedkar was born in a Dalit family but due to his hard work he became the first Minister of Law and Justice and was also the chairman of Constitution drafting committee. It’s not like if a person is born in family of specific should continue to do his family business, people have varied interests. Wasn’t Hindu god aware of this fact? This is my reply to the apologists.</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>Caste system is an integral part of Hinduism, you cannot be a Hindu and reject caste system. Caste system is an evil which Hinduism has produced and upheld in India. Message of god is eternal it cannot be outdated like Hinduism. It is no different than the racial discrimination fought by Nelson Mandela. Such evil thing surely cannot be from god.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><strong>ASHWAMEDHA YAGNA</strong><br />
</span><br />
Written by Sulaiman Razvi<br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Ashvamedha Yajna is a ritual performed by Queens (particularly by chief queen) for fertility and also to gain power in the kingdom. The Ashvamedha Yajna includes slaughtering the horse, then follows the queen&#8217;s intercourse with the horse, then the horse is cut into pieces and cooked. However some Hindus due to  obscenity reject these facts and are reinterpreting the ritual based on their whim. They even deny the fact that Horse was slaughtered during the ritual, I request the readers to go through the article <a href="/index.php/2014/01/01/meat-consumption-in-hinduism/" data-wpel-link="internal">Meat Consumption in Hinduism</a>.<br />
</span><br />
<span id="more-704"></span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Their main objection is that this ritual does not include intercourse and is only meant to bring prosperity in the kingdom and they fail to furnish any reference which may suggest that this ritual is pure and decent and only meant to bring prosperity. However Purana and Sutra clearly mentions about this vulgar ritual, The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harivamsa" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Harivamsa Purana<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> says,<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Harivamsa Purana, Bhavishya Parva 3.5.11-13 &#8221;After the passage of some time, king Janamejaya, who offers plenty of tributes (in sacrifices) <span style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;">observed the horse sacrifice as ordained. Devi Vapushtama, the daughter of the king of Kashi, went and slept with the slain horse</span>, according to the ritual as prescribed. <span style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;">Seeing the queen with beautiful limbs, <strong>Vsava (Indra) desired her. Entering the body of the dead horse, Indra had intercourse withsc the queen</strong></span>.&#8221; Tr. A. Purushothaman and A. Harindranath. [ <a href="http://mahabharata-resources.org/harivamsa/bhavishyaparva/hv_3_005.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">http://mahabharata-resources.org/harivamsa/bhavishyaparva/hv_3_005.html<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> ]
</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">These verses are too vulgar to comment. My question is, if horse sacrifice (Ashvamedha Yajna) does not include copulation with the horse, then why did Indra entered the body of the horse when he could have done it with his own body? As copulation with dead horse is part of the ritual, Indra thought that no one will come to know if he enters the body of the dead horse and copulates with the queen. This verse clearly shows that Ashvamedha does include copulation with the dead horse this is why the Vedic god Indra who couldn&#8217;t resist his lust, entered the body of the horse and successfully copulated with the queen and no one stopped it as copulation is part of the ritual where the Queen sleeps naked with the horse, they both are covered up with a cloth and she places the penis in her private part, she then asks the dead horse to release semen in her which is symbolic as the dead horse can’t release semen but the insertion of penis of dead horse into the vagina of queen is literal. I shall only describe the obscene part of the Ashvamedha Yajna in this article. The Sutras also mentions Chief Queen’s copulation with the dead horse.<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">It is mentioned in Apastamba Srauta Sutra 20.17.12-18 that the Chief Queen recites some Mantras (mentioned in Yajurved) and then all the wives of the king circumambulates the horse, fan it, tie their hairs on the right side of their head. Ramayana tells us that queen Kaushalya the mother of Hindu god Ram had spent a night with the horse.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Valmiki Ramayan, Bala Kanda 1, Sarga 14, Verses 33-35 &#8221;With great delight coming on her Queen Kausalya reverently made circumambulations to the horse, and symbolically killed the horse with three knives. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;">Queen Kausalya desiring the results of ritual disconcertedly resided one night with that horse</span></span> that flew away like a bird. Thus, the officiating priests of the ritual, namely <em>hota,</em> adhwaryu and <em>udgaata</em> have received in their hand the Crowned Queen, the neglected wife, and a concubine of the king, next as a symbolic donation in the ritual by the performer, the king.&#8221; Tr. Shri Desiraju Hanumanth Rao<br />

</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Krishna Yajur Veda 7.4.19 In the heavenly world be you two completely covered. [Queen says]- I will urge on the impregnator, you will urge on the impregnator; let the two of us stretch out our four legs. [Adhvaryu says]-<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;"> Let the stallion, semen-producer, produce semen [insert semen]. Bring the penis into the two thighs</span></span>, drive along the erect and unctuous one which is women&#8217;s living enjoyment, which is their hole-runner [cleaner], women&#8217;s dear secret (pleasure) which has hit the sardigrdi (clitoris?) in their black (haired) mark&#8230; This little bird which creeps around saying &#8216;ahalam&#8217; knocks the penis into the slit; the vulva devours it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">It is mentioned in Shukla Yajur Veda,<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Yajur Veda 23.19-21 All wife of the host reciting three mantras go round the horse. While praying, they say: &#8216;O horse, you are, protector of the community on the basis of good qualities, you are, protector or treasure of happiness. O horse, you become my husband&#8217;. After the animal is purified by the priest, the principal wife sleeps near the horse and says: &#8216;O Horse, I extract the semen worth conception and you release the semen worth conception. The horse and principal wife spread two legs each. Then the Ardhvaryu(priest) orders to cover the oblation place, raise canopy etc. After this, the principal wife of the host pulls penis of the horse and puts it in her vagina and says: &#8220;This horse may release semen in me. Then the host, while praying to the horse says: &#8220;O horse, please throw semen on the upper part of the anus of my wife. Expand your penis and insert it in the vagina because after insertion, this penis makes women happy and lively.<br />

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">This verse from Yajurved could have been rejected or interpreted in some other way if it wasn&#8217;t mentioned in the Brahmanas. The Brahmana and Srauta Sutras attests above obscene verses, following is the English translation of Baudhayana Srauta Sutra by a Hindu scholar named Chintaman Ganesh Kashikar,<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Baudhayana Srauta Sutra chapter 15 verse 29 “The Adhvaryu escorts the senior queen fully decorated, making amends, being reproached (and addresses the three queens) &#8220;O Ambā, O Ambāli O Ambikā&#8221; (The senior queen says) &#8220;No person leads me. The poor horse is sleeping.&#8221; Having lain down by the side of the horse towards the north, she draws a piece of cloth over her head. The Adhvaryu covers both of them with the piece of linen with the formula, &#8220;O fair one, clad in a fair garment, do you two be covered together in the heaven.&#8221; <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;">The senior queen lays the horse&#8217;s penis on her lap with the formula</span></span>, &#8220;I have clasped the impregnatory; do thou clasp me for impregnation. Let us together spread out our four legs.&#8221; The Adhvaryu follows her with the formulas, &#8220;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;">Let the impregnator out of you deposit the seed</span></span>. O horse, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;">do thou press thy region of male organ upon the thighs (of the queen) and insert into the queen&#8217;s genitals thy penis</span></span> which is the means of enjoyment of women, which dashes into their womb, and which, when entered into the genitals pleases them, and which attacks the central part of genitals within the black spot.&#8221; The senior queen censures the horse.” Tr. Dr. Chintaman Ganesh Kashikar</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Sankhayana Srauta Sutra XVI.3.33-36 &#8220;When the horse has been quitened (slaughtered) they cause the first consort of the king to lie down near it. They cover them both (horse and consort) with an upper-garment. To these two the sacrificer addresses the obscene (verse). &#8216;Put the penis (?) into (the space between the) thighs, bring the sleek one down, which is the life and delight of women&#8217;.&#8221; Tr.

When the sacrificial animals have been &#8216;quieted&#8217;, the (king&#8217;s) wives come up with water for washing the feet &#8212; four wives, and a maiden as the fifth, and four hundred women attendants. When the water for washing the feet is ready, they make the chief queen (Mahishi) lie down next to the horse, and they cover the two of them up with the upper cloth as they say the verse, &#8216;Let the two of us cover ourselves in the world of heaven&#8217;, for the world of heaven is where they &#8216;quiet&#8217; the sacrificial animal. Then they draw out the penis of the horse and place it in the vagina of the chief queen, while she says, &#8216;May the vigorous virile male, the layer of seed, lay the seed&#8217;; this she says for sexual intercourse. While they are lying there, the sacrificer insults the horse by saying, &#8216;Lift up her thighs and put it in her rectum.&#8217; No one insults (the sacrificer) back, lest there should be someone to act as a rival against the sacrificer. The officiant (Adhvaryu) then insults the maiden: &#8216;Hey, maiden, hey, maiden, the little female bird &#8230;&#8217; and she insults him back: &#8216;Hey, officiant, hey, officiant, that little bird&#8230;.&#8217; And then the overseer (Brahman) insults the chief queen: &#8216;Hey, chief queen, hey, chief queen, your mother and father climb to the top of a tree&#8230;.&#8217; She has as her attendants a hundred daughters of kings; they insult the overseer in return: &#8216;Hey, overseer, hey, overseer, your mother and your father play in the top of a tree&#8230;.&#8217; Then the cantor (Udgatri) insults the king&#8217;s favorite wife: &#8216;Hey, favorite, hey, favorite wife, raise her up erect&#8230;.&#8217; She has as her attendants a hundred royal women; they insult the cantor in return: &#8216;Hey, cantor, hey, cantor, raise him up erect&#8230;.&#8217; Then the invoker (Hotri) insults the rejected wife: &#8216;Hey, rejected wife, hey, rejected wife, when inside her tight crack&#8230;.&#8217; She has as her attendants a hundred daughters of bards and village headmen; they insult the invoker in return: &#8216;Hey, invoker, hey, invoker, when the gods see that miserable penis&#8230;.&#8217; Then the carver (Kshatri) insults the fourth wife: &#8216;Hey, fourth wife, hey, fourth wife, when the deer eats the barley, (the farmer) does not hope to nourish the animal&#8230;.&#8217; She has as her attendants a hundred daughters of carvers and charioteers; they insult the carver in return: &#8216;Hey, carver, hey, carver, when the deer eats the barley, (the farmer) does not hope to nourish the animal&#8230;.&#8217; These insulting speeches are for all kinds of attainment, for through the horse sacrifice all desires are achieved. Thinking, &#8216;With all kinds of speech we will achieve all kinds of desires&#8217;, they make the chief queen get up. Then the women walk back the way they came, and the others utter at the end a sweet-smelling verse, the verse that begins, &#8216;I praise Dadhikravan.&#8217; For the life-span and the gods go out of those who speak impure speech in the sacrifice. Thus they purify their speech to keep the gods from going out of the sacrifice.&#8221;<br />

<p>Following is the Hindi translation of first two verses by a Hindu scholar named Pandit Ganga Prasad Upadhyaya,</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone  wp-image-9048" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Untitled-1-300x237.jpg" alt="" width="567" height="448" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Untitled-1-300x237.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Untitled-1-768x607.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Untitled-1-1536x1213.jpg 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Untitled-1.jpg 1894w" sizes="(max-width: 567px) 100vw, 567px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">As you can see, Satapatha Brahman verses are in coordination with Yajur Veda verses so there is nothing to doubt about its authenticity. Griffith has omitted the obscene verses of Yajur Veda due to the obscene necrophilia involved , He wrote in the commentary,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&#8221;This and the following nine stanzas are not reproducible even in the semi obscurity of a learned European language&#8230;- Ralph T.H Griffith on Yajur Veda 23.20, p.213. 1899 Edition.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;"> Ralph Griffith&#8217;s translation is based on commentaries of renowned Hindu scholars and all the classical scholars gave the same interpretation so instead of translating such vulgar lines, Griffith preferred to skip those verses. If you notice the Brahmana translated by Julius Eggeling (available at <a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/sbr/sbe44/sbe44107.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">sacred-texts.com<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>), he has partially translated these verses. He has added ellipsis. The reason for this omission is because the translator found these verses to be too vulgar. But still there are some Hindus who try to explain these verses in their own way. Below I am quoting so called explanations from two apologists and I will try to refute it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>FIRST REBUTTAL</strong><br />
</span></p>
<blockquote class="quote-light">
<p style="margin-left: 36pt;"><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">Here is the Sanskrit verse and its translation for Yajur Veda 23/20<br />
<strong>tau ubhau chaturah padah samprasarayava swarga<br />
lokam prasuvava vrshavaaji raghu rathau dadati</strong> Yajur Veda 23/20<br />
tau = we two ; ubhau = both ; chaturah = intelligent ; padah = subject ; samprasarayava = reach out ; swarga lokam = heavenly planet ; prasuvava = command ; vrshavaaji = horse ; raghu = Lord ; rathau = chariots ; dadati = provides<br />
</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36pt;"><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;"><br />
Translation: We both command the intelligent horse as our subject to reach out for heaven (where) the Lord provides (us) the chariots.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36pt;"><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;"><br />
The real meaning here is that by performing Ashwamedha yajna, one can get the blessings (written as chariots) of the heavenly King, Indra.<br />
</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36pt;"><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">And then he goes on to write how the British distorted the meaning and concocted the currently widespread meaning<br />
</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36pt;"><span style="color: #c00000; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: #000000;">Let me explain how the verse in Yajurveda 23.20 is distorted to satisfy the whims and fancies of the fabricators. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The word rathao (chariots) is replaced by retau, which means &#8216;semen&#8217;</strong></span>. Next, <strong>dadati</strong> (gives) is replaced by <strong>dadhatu,</strong> which means &#8216;insert&#8217;. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Finally, raghu (King) is strangely replaced by</strong></span> <strong>retaudha</strong>, which means &#8216;conception&#8217;. Even in the fabricated verse, it should be retaudheya and not retaudha for the sentence to be grammatically correct. This is how charlatans get caught when they distort the meaning of the verses.</span><br />
</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>SECOND REBUTTAL</strong><br />
</span></p>
<blockquote class="quote-light">
<p style="margin-left: 36pt;"><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">Yajurveda 23.20: O ruler and the subject! You should expand bliss for everyone by putting efforts for benevolent actions, developing resources, achieving desires of soul and hence obtaining salvation. May the subject support and strengthen the ruler so that he can control the criminals.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36pt;"><span style="color: #c00000; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><br />
</strong>The mantra can be interpreted for Ishwar. Ishwar is the ruler and we are the subject. We should cooperate with Ishwar in his mission to bring bliss to all of us. Only in this manner is purpose of creation justified.</span><br />
</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>MY RESPONSE:</strong><br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">I will reply to the first rebuttal. Below is the Sanskrit version of verses 19 and 20,<br />
</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Readers can download the Sanskrit version of Yajur Veda from the Maharishi University of Management Vedic Literature Collection, see page 198 <a href="http://is1.mum.edu/vedicreserve/yajur_veda/shukla_yajur_veda.pdf" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">http://is1.mum.edu/vedicreserve/yajur_veda/shukla_yajur_veda.pdf<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a><br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">He translated the word reto as rathau &#8221;<span style="color: #c00000;"> rathau = chariots</span>&#8221; this is utterly wrong, Since the word does not have <span style="font-family: Mangal;">थ</span>(Tha), the word in verse 20 is <span style="font-family: Mangal;">रेतो</span>(Reto), Reto, Reta or Retas means semen, Rath (Chariot) looks like this in Sanskrit or Hindi language <span style="font-family: Mangal;">रथ</span>. One can use Google translator to check it, <a href="http://translate.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">http://translate.google.com/#hi/en/%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%A5<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a><br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">He did the same thing again with the word Retodha <span style="font-family: Mangal;">रेतोधा</span>, He is deliberately changing the Sanskrit words only because it is too difficult for him to explain these verses. Raghu in Sanskrit looks like this <span style="font-family: Mangal;">रघु</span>, Let me again quote the Sanskrit version of verse 23.20 for the readers along with famous lexicon of V.S Apte,<br />

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">[The Student&#8217;s English-Sanskrit Dictionary, page 384, by V.S. Apte, Published in 1893]
</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">As you can see the apologist has deliberately distorted the Sanskrit words. Despite this he was still able to get tons of compliments, no Hindu cared to check such simple mistake. As far as the second rebuttal is concerned. I request the writer to explain which Sanskrit words here (in verse 20) are translated into Criminals, Ishwar, cooperate, developing resources? Have you noticed why translations of two apologists differs? It&#8217;s because they have given their own interpretation to these verses, they have not translated in accordance with Brahmanas, Puranas, and early/medieval commentaries. The difference in translations itself proves that they are trying to hide the facts. <a title="Mahīdhara" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mah%C4%ABdhara" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Mahidhar<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> the renowned commentator on Vedas explained it correctly thus modern Hindus are embarrassed to even mention Mahidhara&#8217;s commentary. He wrote,<br />

<blockquote class="quote-light"><p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&#8221;…Since the horse is dead, the chief queen herself takes the penis [Shishan] of the dead horse and places it into her Vagina [Yoni].

<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Unlike those two rebuttals, the classical scholar <a title="Mahīdhara" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mah%C4%ABdhara" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Mahidhara<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> did not give his personal interpretation. He interpreted these Ashvamedha verses in accordance with Yajur Veda and Brahmana. Dr. B.R. Ambedkar also wrote,</span></p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">“Another instance of obscenity which disfigured the religion of the Ancient Aryans is connected with the Ashvamedha Yajna or the horse sacrifice. A necessary part of the Ashvamedha was the introduction of the Sepas (penis) of the Medha (dead horse) into the Yoni (vagina) of the chief wife of the Yajamana (the sacrificer) accompanied by the recital of long series of Mantras by the Brahmin priests. A Mantra in the Vajasaneya Samhita (xxiii. 18) shows that there used to be a competition among the queens as to who was to receive this high honour of being served by the horse. Those who want to know more about it will find it in the commentary of Mahidhara on the Yejur-Veda where he gives full description of the details of this obscene rite which had formed a part of the Aryan religion.” <strong>Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, Riddle no 23, p.295, Vol 4, Riddles in Hinduism<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Swami Parmeshwarananda mentions about Ashvamedha in the Khila version of Rig Veda,</span></p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&#8220;Mahanagni says, &#8216;Well is the membrum virile entered; of the &#8216;tree having such fruit&#8217; may we gainbasket after basket&#8217; (AV XX.136. 9 = RV V.22. 5, with the difference that in RV at ab we have &#8216;the organ of the horse has entered&#8217;)&#8230;<br />
</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">In the form aspect there must be a human; in the latter a ritual-beast, and it is here that the horse comes in the Horse-sacrifice; for some of the mantras that precede were actually sung at the Horse-sacrifice; for some of the mantras that percede were actually sung at the Horse-sacrifice; and, under this later influence can be explained the reading in RV-Khila &#8216;the organ of the horse has entered&#8217; (asvasvavesitam pasah), which we do not have at the AV.&#8221;<br />

<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><br />
Swami Vivekananda also mentions about Ashvamedha Yagna but he doesn&#8217;t mention it clearly because of the obscenity, he wrote,  </span></p>

&#8220;And in the Vedic Ashvamedha sacrifice worse things would be done&#8230;. All the Brahmanas mention them, and all the commentators admit them to be true. How can you deny them?<br />

<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">What is the worse thing that Swami Vivekananda talking about? We have read what Brahmanas and commentator says about Ashvamedha Yajna, and that&#8217;s what Swami Vivekananda is hinting here. Swami Vivekananda is surely not talking about horse slaughter, for had he meant slaughter here he would&#8217;ve clearly mentioned about it like he mentioned animal slaughter in other lectures and works of his.

<p>Written by Sulaiman Razvi</p>
<p>Having more than one spouse (especially wife) is known as Polygamy. The Hindu Marriage Act 1955 prohibits Polygamy for Hindus but Hindu scriptures allows polygamy and it’s still in practice among some Hindus. Not a single verse of any Hindu text says that ‘You should marry only one’ and yet Hindus claim that Hinduism permits only monogamy. Many Hindus think that Polygamy is prohibited in Hinduism, Hence Hindus are not allowed to have more than one wife. This is not true. Hinduism permits a man to have more than one wife at a time. When you tell a Hindu that Hinduism permits polygamy he won’t talk about scriptures rather he will tell you that Indian law prohibits polygamy for Hindus and Hindus have accepted the law unlike Muslims. They claim that Hindus are very adaptive. Hindus didn’t stop practices like Sati, Polygamy etc., but it was enforced by the Indian court. Recently some women and children were beaten up for entering a temple and the court had to intervene and it allowed entrance of women into some temples. So Hindus had to adapt because they had no choice but to accept court’s decisions. As far as my knowledge on polygamy is concerned I haven’t read a single verse from any Hindu scripture prohibiting polygamy.</p>
<p><span id="more-2522"></span></p>
<p>This article deals with the following subjects</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a id="post-7068-practice"></a>Practice of Polygamy in modern India</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="453" height="336" class="wp-image-7070" src="http://vedkabhed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/https-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2016-05-prac.jpeg" alt="https://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/practise-of-polygamy.jpg?w=453&amp;h=337" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/https-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2016-05-prac.jpeg 453w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/07/https-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2016-05-prac-300x223.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 453px) 100vw, 453px" /></p>
<p>While Hindus makes mockery of Muslims for having four wives each (which isn’t true) they are unaware of the fact that Hindu men are more polygamous than Muslims in India. Let’s have a look at the survey,<br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="477" height="366" class="wp-image-7071" src="http://vedkabhed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/https-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2016-05-wome.png" alt="https://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/women-polygamy-010517_0630_conditionof2.png?w=481&amp;h=368" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/https-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2016-05-wome.png 477w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/07/https-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2016-05-wome-300x230.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 477px) 100vw, 477px" /></p>
<p>As per Government’s 1961 census, 5.8% of Hindus were polygamous compared to Muslim’s 5.7%. Polygamy among Buddhist men was 7.9%, Jains 6.7% and incidence of polygamy was highest among Adivasis with 15.25% of Adivasi practicing polygamy.</p>
<p>It is illegal for non-Muslims in India to have more than one wife. In spite of this, many Hindus have multiple wives. Official reports brought out in 1974, almost two decades after the prohibition of Hindu bigamy, highlighted the shocking fact that polygamy among Hindus was higher than among Muslims (Adivasis: 15 per cent, Hindus: 5.8 per cent, Jains: 6.7 per cent, Buddhists: 7.9 per cent, Muslims: 5.6 per cent). Figures for subsequent decades are not available. The difference may appear insignificant but in real terms, it is huge — as many as one crore Hindu men had more than one wife, as opposed to just 12 lakh Muslims. In fact, according to the 2011 Census, 66 lakh women are still in bigamous marriages.</p>
<p>The National Family Health Survey carried out in 2006 showed that 2.5% of Muslim men were polygamous compared to 1.7% of Hindu men and 2.1% of Christian men. The number of polygamous marriages has dropped significantly in both Hindus and Muslims. But this time the percentage of polygamy is higher among Muslims with a 0.8% gap between Hindus and Muslims. But this 0.8% gap is not a huge number. There is something worth noticing that Indian law permits Polygamy for Muslims while Hindu Marriage Act 1955 prohibits Hindu men to have more than one wife at a time, despite this prohibition 1.7% Hindus still practices polygamy. Imagine the rate of polygamy in Hindus if Indian law permits them to have more than one wife. Indian law permits polygamy for Muslims based on Sharia law and yet only 2.5% of men practices polygamy. 1961 and 1974 census are more important because they are the only two official census to look marriages on religious lines. Apart from this, in Goa a Hindu man can practice polygamy if his wife did not bore him a child.</p>

<p>There are some tactics used by Hindus to practice polygamy in India as Hindu Marriage Act prohibits them to have more than one wife at a time. Some converts to Islam to have more than one wife but at the same time practices polygamy, some Hindus after marrying the second says that their first marriage was not solemnized as some ceremonies pertaining to Hindu law were not duly performed.</p>
<p>When a Hindu marries a second wife, the first wife lodges a criminal case against her husband pointing out his polygamy. In many cases the court rejects the case based on meager legal points and eludes the culprit out of punishment.</p>
<p>In Maharastra Mr. Balrao Sankar Lokande married a second wife. His first wife lodged a criminal case against him. Session court and High court convicted him. Mr. Balrao appealed to the Supreme court, the Supreme court released him. As he left some ceremonies pertaining to the Laws of Hindus Marriage, it can’t be considered as marriage. Since it is not a marriage, he did not commit any mistake to punish is the judgment.<br />

Mr. Balrao Sankar Lokande against Government of Maharastra AIR 1965 SC 1566)</p>
<p>Mr. Suresh Chandra Gosh married a second wife. His first wife Priya Bala Gosh lodged a criminal case against him. High court refused to convict him on legal ground. Since he left some ceremonies pertaining to the Laws of Hindus Marriage, it can’t be considered as marriage.<br />
Mrs. Priya Bala Gosh against Mr. Suresh Chandra Gosh AIR 1971 SC 1153)</p>
<p>In Andra Mr.L.Venkata Reddy married a second wife. His first wife Mrs.Lingari Oppallamma lodged a criminal case against him. In this case also High court did not convict him. As he left some ceremonies pertaining to the Laws of Hindus Marriage, it can’t be considered as marriage.</p>
<p>Mrs.Lingari Oppallamma against Mr.L.Venkata Reddy and others AIR 1979 SC 848)<br />

<p>In Kashmir Mr. Bangari married a second wife. His first wife lodged a criminal case against him. The court released him. As he left some ceremonies pertaining to the Laws of Hindus Marriage, it can’t be considered as marriage. His second wife is a concubine only. Since There is no law to punish for keeping a concubine.</p>
<p>Mr. Banari against the State Government of Jammu &amp; Kashmir AIR 1965 SC 105)</p>
<p>Thus our High Courts and Supreme Court passed judgments in many cases.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Another tactic</strong> used by Hindus is the practice of Live-in relationship. A married man can have another partner through live-in relationship. And this practice has got legal backing in Gujarat where it is known as Maitri Karar. Though both men and women can practice Maitri Karar but its mostly upper caste rich Hindu men who are opting for Maitri Karar. In this practice they can have a wife and a live in partner at a time. In Madhya Pradesh too such case was reported where court ordered a man to spend equal time with wife and live-in partner. Here are the links,<br />

<p>Polygamy among Kshatriyas was more prevalent which is accepted by Hindu apologists also. Rig Veda shows the same,</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a id="post-7068-scriptures"></a>Hindu scriptures permitting Polygamy</h2>
<p>Renowned Hindu scholar Vijnanesvara writes,</p>
<p>“According to the order of the classes, for the Brahmana three, for the Ksatriya two wives, and for the Vaisya one wife are ordained. A Sudra can have only one wife born in the same class.” <strong>Vijnanesvara in his commentary Mitakshara on Yajnavalkya Smriti 3.57</strong></p>
<p>Swami Vivekananda finds no problem with Polygamy,</p>
<p>“For women, they hold chastity as the most important virtue, no doubt. One man marrying more than one wife is not so injurious to society as a woman having more than one husband at the same time, for the latter leads to the gradual decay of the race.” <strong>The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda/Volume 5/Writings: Prose and Poems/The East and The West/France-Paris</strong><br />

<p>Swami Prabhupada the founder of ISKCON on Polygamy,</p>
<p>“…According to our Vedic process, polygamy is allowed. For example, Krsna married 16,000 wives, Arjuna married 3 or 4 wives, Krsna’s father Vasudeva, married 16 or 18 wives, like that. So according to the Vedic system polygamy is not prohibited…” <strong>By Swami Prabhupada, Letter to Karandhara written from Bombay</strong><br />
<a href="http://vanisource.org/wiki/730109_-_Letter_to_Karandhara_written_from_Bombay" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">http://vanisource.org/wiki/730109_-_Letter_to_Karandhara_written_from_Bombay<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>“People have become so degraded in this age that on the one hand they restrict polygamy and on the other hand they hunt for women in so many ways. Many business concerns publicly advertise that topless girls are available in this club or in that shop. Thus women have become instruments of sense enjoyment in modern society. The Vedas enjoin, however, that if a man has the propensity to enjoy more than one wife—as is sometimes the propensity for men in the higher social order, such as the brāhmaṇas, kṣatriyas and vaiśyas, and even sometimes the śūdras—he is allowed to marry more than one wife. Marriage means taking complete charge of a woman and living peacefully without debauchery. At the present moment, however, debauchery is unrestricted. Nonetheless, society makes a law that one should not marry more than one wife. This is typical of a demoniac society.” <strong>Swami Prabhupada on Srimad Bhagavatam 4.26.6</strong><br />

<p>He also writes,</p>
<p>“A man is allowed to keep more than one wife because he cannot enjoy sex when the wife is pregnant. If he wants to enjoy sex at such a time, he may go to another wife who is not pregnant. These are laws mentioned in the Manu-samhita and other scriptures.” <strong>Swami Prabhupada on Srimad Bhagavatam 4.27.5</strong><br />

<p>Vedas the oldest scriptures of Hinduism neither permits nor prohibits Polygamy. But traces of polygamy can be found in Vedas which implies that it was practiced in the Vedic period, I am using Shri Ram Sharma’s Hindi translation.</p>
<p>Indra is said to have three wives as per the following verse,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 5.42.12 May the House-friends, the cunning-handed Artists, may the Steer&#8217;s Wives, the streams carved out by Vibhvan, And may the fair Ones honour and befriend us, Sarasvatī, Brhaddiva, and Rākā.</p>

<p>Maitrayani Samhita 3.11.1 [140, 10-11] &#8220;The three goddesses growing by means of oblation, enjoying Indra like wives, Sarasvati, heavenly Ida, and all-conquering Bharati with their swelling milk [enjoying] the unbroken thread&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Catherine Ludvik</p>
<p>Vishnu is said to have had two wives, Sarasvati and Aditi. This is truly a case of polygamy unless it is a contradiction,</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 29.60 “…a mess of boiled rice is to be made for Prajâpati; the same for Vishnu&#8217;s Consort Aditi…” Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 7.46.3 “O Consort of Vishnu Goddess, urge thy Lord to bounty…” Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>Veda seems to sanction Polyandry as well, Rig Veda 6.49.7 considers Sarasvati as wife of Indra which is contrary to what above verses say unless it is contradiction. Sarasvati is also called wife of Ashwin brothers in Yajur Veda 19.94 which is clearly a case of polyandry.</p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.43.1. IN perfect unison all yearning hymns of mine that find the light of heaven have sung forth Indra’s praise. As wives embrace their lord, the comely bridegroom, so they compass Maghavan about that he may help.<br />

<p>Krishna Yajur Veda 6.5.1.4 …therefore as one goes many follow; therefore one becomes superior among many; therefore one wins many wives…</p>
<p>A verse in Rig Veda clearly shows that an old Rishi Chyavana was married to many girls after he was rejuvenated,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.116.10 Ye from the old Cyavana, O Nasatyas, stripped, as ’twere mail, the skin upon his body, Lengthened his life when all had left him helpless, Dasras! and made him lord of youthful maidens.<br />

<p>Chyavana being rejuvenated is also mentioned in Nirukta 4.19, Mahabharata Adi Parva 1.177 and Pancavimsa Brahmana 14.6.10 but it doesn’t state anything about his marriages. Maidens here may refer to several maidens or just two maidens. As Hindu texts only mentions his two wives. Scriptures doesn’t give much detail about Chyavana’s wives and stresses more on Sukanya the daughter of King Saryati. Sukanya became the wife of Chyavana as mentioned in Srimad Bhagavatam 9.3, other texts talks about another wife named Arushi the daughter of Manu who bore him a son named Aurva and this is mentioned in Mahabharata Adi Parva 1.66.47.</p>
<p>Other Hindu scriptures are clear on Polygamy. They permit polygamy without a doubt.</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 3.12-13 For the first marriage of twice-born men (wives) of equal caste are recommended; but for those who through desire proceed (to marry again) the following females, (chosen) according to the (direct) order (of the castes), are most approved. It is declared that a Sudra woman alone (can be) the wife of a Sudra, she and one of his own caste (the wives) of a Vaisya, those two and one of his own caste (the wives) of a Kshatriya, those three and one of his own caste (the wives) of a Brahmana.</p>
<p>Agni Purana 285.63-67 “…A husband of many wives, should lick with his tongue, every day, a syrup composed of Triphala, Pippali, honey, clarified butter, and pulverised Amalaki treated with the expressed juice of the same fruit, and then drink water…” Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 9.85. If twice-born men wed women of their own and of other (lower castes), the seniority, honour, and habitation of those (wives) must be (settled) according to the order of the castes (varna).</p>
<p>Mahabharata 1.160.36 “There is no sin in this. For a man polygamy is an act of merit, but for a woman it is very sinful to betake herself to a second husband after the first.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Mahabharata 14.80.12-18 “Oh, let Vijaya, let him that is called Gudakesa, let this hero with reddish eyes, come back O life. O blessed lady, polygamy is not fault with men. Women only incur fault by taking more than one husband.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Mahabharata 1.197.27-28 “Drupada answered, ‘O scion of Kuru’s race, it hath been directed that one man may have many wives. But it hath never been heard that one woman may have many husbands!” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Hindu scriptures also gives instructions on which wife should do religious duties with the husband if he has several wives.</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti 26.1-4 If a man has several wives of his own caste, he shall perform his religious duties together with the eldest (or first married) wife. (If he has several) wives of diverse castes (he shall perform them) even with the youngest wife if she is of the same caste as himself. On failure of a wife of his own caste (he shall perform them) with one belonging to the caste next below to his own; so also in cases of distress (i.e, when the wife who is equal in caste to him happens to be absent, or when she has met with a calamity); But no twice born man ever with a S’udra wife.</p>
<p>Katyayana Samhita 8.6 “Many wives of the same caste and of other castes existing, the rite of churning, for producing the Fire, should be done by the chaste wives of the same caste, on account of the superiority of birth.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>FOUR WIVES</strong>:</p>
<p>The only confusion regarding Polygamy in Hindu scriptures is that some Hindu scriptures permits a Brahmin to marry four women and some permit only three. Following verses permits four wives for a Brahmin, three (as well as numerous) to a Kshatriya, two to a Vaishya and only one to a Shudra,</p>
<p>Mahabharata 13.47.4 “It has been laid down, O grandsire, that a Brahmana can take four wives, viz., one that belongs to his own order, one that is a Kshatriya, one that is a Vaisya, and one that is a Sudra, if the Brahmana wishes to indulge in the desire of sexual intercourse.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Mahabharata 13.48.4 “The Brahmana may take four wives, one from each of the four orders. In two of them (viz.,the wife taken from his own order and that taken from the one next below), he takes birth himself (the children begotten upon them being regarded as invested with the same status as his own)…A Kshatriya may take three wives…The Vaisya may take two spouses…The Sudra can take only one wife, viz., she that is taken from his own order. The son begotten by him upon her becomes a Sudra….” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Agni Purana 153.1 ”Pushkara said:- A Brahman may take four wives, a Kshatriya three, a Vaishya two, while a member of the Shudra caste is not allowed to have more than a single wife.” Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 9.149. If there be four wives of a Brahmana in the direct order of the castes, the rule for the division (of the estate) among the sons born of them is as follows:</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti 24.1-5 Now a Brahmana may take four wives in the direct order of the (four) castes; A Kshatriya, three; A Vaisya, two; A Sudra, only one.</p>
<p>Baudhyana Dharma Shastra, Prasna I, Adhyaya 8, Kandika 16, verses 1-5 There are four castes (varna, viz.) Brâhmanas, Kshatriyas, Vaisyas, and Sûdras. (Males) belonging to them (may take) wives according to the order of the castes, (viz.) a Brâhmana four, A Kshatriya three, A Vaisya two, A Sudra one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>THREE WIVES:</strong></p>
<p>Paraskara Grihya Sutra I Kanda, 4 Kandika, 8-11 Three (wives are allowed) to a Brahmana, in accordance with the order of the castes, Two to a Raganya, One to a Vaisya, One Sudra wife besides to all, according to some (teachers), without using Mantras (at the ceremonies of wedding, &amp;c.).</p>
<p>Yajnavalkya Smriti 3.57 “Three, according to the order of the caste, so also two, and one for a Brahmana, a Ksatriya and a Vaisya respectively (may be the wives). To a person born as a Sudra, a girl of her own caste is his wife.” Srisa Chandra Vasu</p>
<p>See commentary by Vijnanesvara on this verse for explanation which I have mentioned in this article.</p>
<p>Sankha Samhita 4.7 “Brahmana can marry three wives, a Kshatriya can take a couple of wives, while a Vais’ya or S’udra can marry a single wife. A Brahmana can marry a Brahmana, Kshartriya, or a Vais’ya girl.” Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Vasistha Samhita 1.24. Three wives (are permitted) to a Brâhmana according to the order of the castes, two to a Kshatriya, one to a Vaisya and to a Sûdra.</p>
<p>Mahabharata 13.44.11-12 “A Brahmana can take three wives. A Kshatriya can take two wives. As regards the Vaisya, he should take a wife from only his own order. The children born of these wives should all be regarded as equal. Of the three wives of a Brahmana, she taken from his own order should be regarded as the foremost. Similarly, of the two wives permitted to the Kshatriya, she taken from his own order should be regarded as superior. Some say that persons belonging to the three higher orders may take, only for purposes of enjoyment (and not for those of virtue), wives from the lowest or the Sudra order. Others, however, forbid the practice.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Some allows a Brahmin to have four wives while others allow three. As I said in my article <a href="/index.php/2016/06/05/caste-system-in-hinduism/" data-wpel-link="internal">Caste System in Hinduism</a>, There is unanimity among scholars that a Brahmin should first marry a woman from his own caste and then of succeeding castes. This applies for Kshatriya and Vaisya also. They can marry several women from their own castes also but laws concerning marriage with other castes is mentioned in those verses. As for those who allow a Brahmin to marry only three, they say it on the following basis,</p>
<p>Yajnavalkya Smriti 3.56 “Though it has been said that a twice born may take a wife from a Sudra family, yet that is not my opinion, because out of her, he is born himself.” Tr. Srisa Chandra Vasu</p>
<p>Similar thing is also said in Manu Smriti 3.14. A man belonging to low caste cannot marry girl belonging to preceding caste. But a Brahmin can marry a girl of any caste. Following two verses will clear the confusion,</p>
<p>Narada Smriti 12.4-6 When a Brahman, Kshatriya, Vaisya, or Sudra takes a wife, it is best for him to take her out of his own caste; and so is a member of her own caste (the most eligible) husband for a woman (of any caste). A Brahman may marry three wives of different caste, in the direct order of the castes; and so may a Sudra woman take a husband of any of the three castes above her own. For a Kshatriya, two wives differing (from him) in caste are permitted; for a Vaisya, a single wife differing (from him) in caste…</p>
<p>Munis to King</p>
<p>Markandeya Purana 113.31-34 “O king, A brahman who marries wives among all the castes, provided that he marries first a brahman woman, incurs no injury in his brahman-hood. Likewise a kshatriya who marries first a kshatriya’s daughter, incurs no harm if he marries wives from lower castes; and therefore, O king, these other wives fall not from their own righteousness. Thus a vaisya, who marries first a vaisya woman and afterwards a girl born from a sudra family, is not excluded from the vaisya family. The law is thus declared in order…”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Written by Ibn Muhammad</p>
<p>Special thanks to Brother Neer Muhammad, who has been really helpful throughout the writing of this article and also gave valuable points.</p>
<p>Present day Hindu culture is pivoted solely on the cow. Its material and spiritual concepts are both engulfed in cow worship. Such an animal worship is known as zoolatry. The Hindutva brigade propaganda machinery uses the politics of cow to mobilize the blind Hindu masses and works them into a frenzy. The taboo on cow slaughter is one of the pillars of the Hindutva ideology. According to M.S.Golwalkar, a Hindutva ideologue, cow slaughter in India began with foreign domination. “The Muslims started it and the Britishers continued it” (M.S.Golwalkar, <em>Bunch of Thoughts</em>, Pg 496). In the past, several futile attempts have been made by proponents of Hindutva to pass a law to ban the slaughter of cows at the national level. In the NCERT school textbook for Class VI (2002) we read:</p>
<p><span id="more-843"></span></p>
<p><strong>“Among the animals the cow was given the most important and sacred place. Injuring or killing of cow was prohibited in the Vedic period. The cow was called Aghnya (is not to be killed or injured). Vedas prescribe punishment for injuring or killing cow by expulsion from the kingdom or by death penalty, as the case may be”</strong></p>
<p><strong>(<em>Social Sciences Textbook for Class VI</em>, Pg 89.).</strong></p>
<p>But the theory that the in Vedic times there was no cow slaughter is historically inaccurate. Although cow was revered and treated as sacred, it was also offered as food to guests and persons of high status. The fact remains that ancient Hindu scriptures clearly permit the consumption of meat, even of cows. True scholars, and not modern frauds, know this. For example, Swami Vivekananda who is considered as a major force in the revival of Hinduism in modern India, admitted that ancient Hindus used to eat meat. He says,</p>
<p><strong>“You will be astonished if I tell you that, according to the old ceremonials, he is not a good Hindu who does not eat beef. On certain occasions he must sacrifice a bull and eat it.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>[<em>The complete works of Swami Vivekananda</em>, Volume 3, Pg 536]</strong></p>
<p>In the same volume on page 174 he says,</p>
<p><strong>“There was a time in this very India when, without eating beef, no Brahmin could remain a Brahmin;”</strong></p>
<p>Let us now look at the evidence from Hindu texts, which proves that Hinduism not only permits beef eating but also requires its folowers to institute certain cow sacrifices. I will simultaneously refute the common arguments of Hindus.</p>
<h1><strong>Yajna and animal sacrifices</strong></h1>
<p>In Hinduism, Yajna is a ritual of sacrifice derived from the practice of Vedic times. It is performed to please the gods or to attain certain wishes. A Vedic yajna is typically performed by an <em>adhvaryu</em> priest, with a number of additional priests such as the <em>hotar</em>, <em>udgatar</em> playing a major role, next to their dozen helpers, by reciting or singing Vedic verses. How to deal with the animal, that is to be sacrificed in the Yajna, be it a goat, a horse or a cow, is mentioned in the <em>Aitareya Brahman</em> of the Rigveda as follows:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="418" height="324" class="wp-image-7615" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/3-5d8baf8705.jpeg" alt="3-5d8baf8705" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/3-5d8baf8705.jpeg 418w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/3-5d8baf8705-300x233.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 418px) 100vw, 418px" /></p>
<p><strong>“6. …Turn the animal’s feet northwards. Make its eyes go to the Sun, dismiss its breath to the wond, its life to the space, its hearing to the directions, its body to the earth. In this way the Hotar (priest) connets it with these world. Take of the entire skin without cutting it. Before opening the navel tear out the omentum. Stop its breathing within (by stopping its mouth). Thus the Hotar puts breath in the animals. Make of its breast a piece like an eagle, of its arms (two pieces like) two hatchets, of its forearms (two pieces like) two spikes, of its shoulders (two pieces like) two kashyapas (tortoises), its loins should be unbroken (entire); make of its thigs (two pieces like) two shields, of the two kneepans (two pieces like) two oleander leaves; take out its twenty-six ribs according to their order; preserve every limb of its in its integrity. Thus he benefits all its limbs. Dig a ditch in the earth to hide its excrements.</strong></p>
<p><strong>7. Present the evil spirits with the blood.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Aitareya Brahman, Book 2, para 6 and 7]</strong></p>
<p>Subsequently, the same Aitareya Brahman instructing on how to distribute different parts of the sacrificial animal says,</p>
<p><strong>“Now follows the division of the different parts of the sacrificial animal (among the priests). We shall describe it. The two jawbones with the tongue are to be given to the Prastotar; the breast in the form of an eagle to the Udgatar; the throat with the palate to the Pratihartar; the lower part of the right loins to the Hotar; the left to the Brahma; the right thigh to the Maitravaruna; the left to the Brahmanuchhamsi; the right side with the shoulder to the Adhvaryu; the left side to those who accompany the chants; the left shoulder to the Pratipasthatar; the lower part of the right arm to the Neshtar; the lower part of the left arm to the Potar; the upper part of the right thigh to the Achhavaka; the left to the Agnidhra; the upper part of the right arm to the Aitreya; the left to the Sadasya; the back bone and the urinal bladder to the Grihapati (sacrificer); the right feet to the Grihapati who gives a feasting; the left feet to the wife of that Grihapati who gives a feasting; the upper lip is common to both, which is to be divided by the Grihapati. They offer the tail of the animal to wives, but they should give it to a Brahmana; the fleshy processes (maanihah) on the neck and three gristles (kikasaah) to the Grahvastut; three other gristles and one half of the fleshy part on the back (vaikartta) to the Unnetar; the other half of the fleshy part on the neck and the left lobe (Kloma) to the Slaughterer (Shamita), who should present it to a Brahmana, if he himself would not happen to be a Brahmana. The head is to be given to the Subrahmanya, the skin belongs to him (the Subrahmanya), who spoke, Svaah Sutyam (to morrow at the Soma Sacriice); that part of the sacrificial animal at a Soma sacrifice which beloings to Ilaa (sacrificial food) is common to all the priests; only for the Hotar it is optional.</strong></p>
<p><strong>All these portions of the sacrificial animal amount to thirty-six single pieces, each of which represents the paada (foot) of a verse by which the sacrifice is carried up…”</strong></p>
<p><strong>“To those who divide the sacrificial animal in the way mentioned, it becomes the guide to heaven (Swarga). But those who make the division otherwise are like scoundrels and miscreants who kill an animal merely.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>“This division of the sacrificial animal was invented by Rishi Devabhaaga, a son of Srauta. When he was departing from this life, he did not entrust (the secret to anyone). But a supernatural being communicated it to Girija,the son of Babhru. Since his time men study it.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Aitareya Brahman, Book 7, Para 1, Translated by Martin Haug]</strong></p>
<p>I have come across certain bigots among Hindus, who make the excuse that these are the translations of a non-Hindu European scholar with ‘ulterior motives’. This is a common response of  half-baked Hindus, who have negligible knowledge of Hindu scriptures. To establish the authenticity of the above translations, I will produce before you passages from the <em>‘Purva Mimamsa Sutras’</em> of Jaimini, its commentary called ‘<em>Shabarbhasya</em>‘ and the views of renowned Arya Samaj scholar, Pandit Yudhishthira Mimamsak on them.</p>
<p>It must be noted that the <em>Purva Mimamsa Sutras</em> (compiled between 300-200 BCE), written by Rishi Jaimini is one of the most important ancient Hindu philosophical texts. It forms the basis of Mimamsa, the earliest of the six orthodox schools (darshanas) of Indian philosophy.</p>
<p>Commenting on Purv Mimansa Sutra Adhyaya 3, Pada 6, Sutra 18, the <em>Shabarbhasya</em> says,</p>
<p>संति च पशुधर्माः- उपाकरणं, उपानयं, अक्ष्णया बंधः, यूपे नियोजनम्, संज्ञपनं, विशसनमित्येवमादयः</p>
<p><strong>There are also certain details to be performed in connection with the animals, such as (a) Upaakaranam [Touching the animal with the two mantras], (b) Upaanayanam [Bringing forward], (c) Akshanyaa-bandhah [Tying with a rope], (d) Yoope niyojanam [Fettering to the Sacrificial Post], (e) Sanjnapanam [Suffocating to death], (f) Vishasanam [Dissecting], and so forth.</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Shabhar bhashya on Mimamsa Sutra 3/6/18; translated by Ganganath Jha]</strong></p>
<p>Expounding on this, Arya Samaj scholar, Pandit Yudhisthira Mimamsak writes in is ‘<em>Mimamsa Shabar Bhashyam’</em></p>
<p><strong>“In this case and otherwise it appears from the Jaimini Sutras that the offering of sacrificed animals is to be made in the Yajnas. It is clearly mentioned in the Mimamsa Sutrs.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Mimamsa Shabharbhasyam, adhyaya 3, Page 1014]</strong></p>
<p>Moving on let us see Mimamsadarshan Sutra 3/7/28 which says,</p>
<p>शमिता च शब्दभेदात्</p>
<p><strong>The ‘Shamita’ (slaughterer of the animal) is not distinct from the major priests.</strong></p>
<p>Commenting on it the <em>Shabarbhashya </em>says,</p>
<p>क्लोमा चार्द्धवं वैकर्तनं च शमितुः तद् ब्राह्मणाय दद्यात् यद्य ब्राह्मणः स्यात्</p>
<p><strong>“The liver and the upper quarter belongs to the Shamita Priest ; one should give it to a Brahmana if he be a non-Brahmana.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Shabhar bhasya on Mimamsa Sutra 3/7/28; translated by Ganganath Jha]</strong></p>
<p>Notice that this is exactly the same things that we saw was said in Aitareya Brahman Book 7; Para 1 above (the highlighted part). This proves that Shabarbhashya is confirming the Aitareya Brahman and the translation is also accurate.</p>
<p>Pandit Yudhisthira Mimamsak also confirms this when he says,</p>
<p><strong>“The division of the meat of the sacrificed animal as instructed in the Aitareya Brahman clearly proves that during the time of the writing of Aitareya Brahman and the time when it was edited by Saunaka, animals were sacrificed in the Yajnas and their meat was consumed by the Brahmins“</strong></p>
<p>Some half-baked Hindus who like to play games might try to call all these references as later interpolations. However, the scholar Yudhisthir Mimamsak outrightly rejects such a bogus conclusion when he says,</p>
<p><strong>“There is no strong evidence to consider these passages as later interpolations.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Mimamsa Shabarbhashyam by Yudhishthir Mimamsak Adhyaya 3, Page 1075]</strong></p>
<p>Further in Mimamsa Sutra 3/8/43 it is mentioned,</p>
<p>मांसं तु सवनियानां चोदनाविशेषात</p>
<p><strong>“Only the ‘Savaniya’ cakes should consist of flesh”</strong></p>
<p>All these passages prove that the flesh of the sacrificed animal was consumed as per the instructions of the Hindu texts.</p>
<h1><strong>Refuting the modern Hindu polemic of ‘No violence in Yajna’<br />
</strong></h1>
<p><strong>Hindu Argument (quoted from a Hindu apologetics website)</strong></p>
<p>Yajna never meant animal sacrifice in the sense popularly understood. Yajna in the Vedas meant a noble deed or the highest purifying action.</p>
<p>————————<em>—————–</em></p>
<p>Adhvara iti Yajnanaama – Dhvaratihimsaakarmaa tatpratishedhah</p>
<p>Nirukta 2.7</p>
<p>According to Yaaska Acharya, one of the synonyms of Yajna in Nirukta or the Vedic philology is Adhvara.</p>
<p>Dhvara means an act with himsa or violence. And therefore a-dhvara means an act involving no himsa or no violence. There are a large number of such usage of Adhvara in the Vedas.</p>
<p><strong>Response</strong></p>
<p>This argument is incorrect because the word ‘Adhvar’ has been misplaced and interpreted incompletely. Yaska is merely giving the etymology of the word ‘Adhvar’ and not where it is to be applied and what constitutes violence. To know the true application of the word ‘Adhvar’ we will have to turn to Shatapath Brahman, which gives the complete understanding of why ‘Yajna’ is called ‘Adhvar’. Shatapath Brahman 1/4/1/40 says,</p>
<p>devānha vai yajñena yajamānāṃtsapatnā</p>
<p>asurā dudhūrṣāṃ cakruste dudhūrṣanta eva na śekurdhūrvituṃ te</p>
<p>parābabhūvustasmādyajño <strong>adhvaro nāma</strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="81" class="wp-image-7617" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/8-ff30ff984e.jpeg" alt="8-ff30ff984e" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/8-ff30ff984e.jpeg 683w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/8-ff30ff984e-300x36.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px" /></p>
<p><strong>“For once when the gods were engaged in sacrificing, their rivals, the Asuras, wished to injure (dhvar) them; but, though desirous of injuring them, they were unable to injure them and were foiled: for this reason the sacrifice is called adhvara (‘not damaged, uninterrupted’).”</strong></p>
<p>Thus the argument of the polemicist turns out to be a deception aimed at fooling those who have no access to the original texts. The passage of Shatapath Brahman makes it clear that ‘Adhvar’ is called so because the priests performing the Yajna did not become victims of violence. It has no connection to the violence of the animals done in the Yajna.</p>
<p>Renowned classical commentator of the four Vedas, Sayana Acharya, also gives the same reason for calling Yajna as ‘Adhvar’. He says in his comments on Rigveda 1/1/4,</p>
<p>अध्वरं हिंसारहितम् ह्वग्निना सर्वतः पालितं यज्ञं राक्षसादयो हिंसितुं प्रभवंति</p>
<p><strong>“Adhvar is called ‘without violence’ because being protected by Agni on all sides it is uninterrupted by Rakshashas or violent enemies, who are unable to mar it.”</strong></p>
<p>Again we see that Acharya Sayan expresses the same view as that of the Shatapath Brahman i.e the violence referred in the ‘adhvar’ is not for the sacrificial animal in the Yajna.</p>
<p>Renowned Hindu scholar, Swami Prabhupada explains the so-called violence in the Yajna in the following words,</p>
<p><strong>“Although animal killing in a sacrifice is recommended in the Vedic literature, the animal is not considered to be killed. The sacrifice is to give a new life to the animal. Sometimes the animal is given a new animal life after being killed in the sacrifice, and sometimes the animal is promoted immediately to the human form of life.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Bhagavad Gita As It Is 8/13]</strong></p>
<p>Even Manu Smriti echoes the same opinion in a more clear way in Chapter 5, verse 39 when it says,</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="698" height="35" class="wp-image-7618" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/9-f576746bf5.jpeg" alt="9-f576746bf5" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/9-f576746bf5.jpeg 698w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/9-f576746bf5-300x15.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 698px) 100vw, 698px" /></p>
<p><strong>“Svayambhu (the Self-existent) himself created animals for the sake of sacrifices; sacrifices (have been instituted) for the good of this whole (world); hence the slaughtering (of beasts) for sacrifices is not slaughtering (in the ordinary sense of the word).”</strong></p>
<p>Again Manu Smriti Chapter 5, verse 44 says</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="694" height="38" class="wp-image-7619" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/10-c0106913d5.jpeg" alt="10-c0106913d5" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/10-c0106913d5.jpeg 694w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/10-c0106913d5-300x16.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 694px) 100vw, 694px" /></p>
<p><strong>“Know that the injury to moving creatures and to those destitute of motion, which the Veda has prescribed for certain occasions, is no injury at all; for the sacred law shone forth from the Veda.”</strong></p>
<p>Thus, this argument stands nullified. For more scholarly explanation that the violence of animals in the Yajna is actually no violence please see the last section of this article namely ‘The testimony of classical scholars’.</p>
<h1><strong>Animal sacrifices in Vedas, including cow sacrifice<br />
</strong></h1>
<p>Chapter 24 of the Shukla Yajurveda is a unique chapter that will help us throw light on the animal sacrifices in the Vedas. This chapter contains an exact enumeration of animals that are to be tied to the sacrificial stakes, with the names of the deities to which they are dedicated. Several of the animals cannot be identified. This entire chapter is a weird puzzle, which is difficult to solve for the  modern vegetarian Hindus. They are simply unable to explain the coherent meaning of this chapter. You will be amazed to know that even a Vedic scholar like Swami Dayanand is unable to throw any light on it. He merely says that we should know the  qualities of each animal by relating to the qualities of the deity to whom they are dedicated.  This statement of the Swami is itself a puzzle, as it gives no clear beneficial knowledge to us. Even Pandit Devi Chand, an Arya Samaj scholar, who based his English translation of the Yajurveda on Swami Dayanand’s work is clueless about the exact meaning of this chapter. He says in  the footnote to verse #1,</p>
<p><strong>“The exact significance of these animals being attached to the forces of nature (or Deities) is not clear to me.” (words in brackets  mine)</strong></p>
<p>Does this mean that no Hindu scholar for thousands of years has been able to understand the meaning of this chapter? I would say that is not the case. If we go to the Brahmanas and the classical commentators of the Vedas, the puzzle is solved. According to them each animal dedicated to a particular diety in this chapter has to be sacrificed to that deity. See Shatapath Brahmana 13/2/2/1-10</p>
<p>If this view is not accepted as the correct one, then every verse of this chapter would be a question mark with no answer.  For example, verse 1 dedicates ‘a cow that slips her calf’ to Indra. But the question is, what will Indra do with such a cow? Is Indra going to give a sermon to her? or is Indra going to punish her? Such questions require satisfactory answers which modern vegetarian Hindus are unable to provide.</p>
<p>In the Yajnas meant for obtaining Rice, meat of bulls was cooked and offered to the diety.</p>
<p>Rigveda 10/28/3 mentions this as</p>
<p>अद्रिणा ते मन्दिन इन्द्र तूयान सुन्वन्ति सोमान पिबसि तवमेशाम |</p>
<p>पचन्ति ते वर्षभानत्सि तेषां पर्क्षेण यन्मघवन हूयमानः ||</p>
<p><strong>“Your worshippers express with the stone fast flowing exhilarating Soma-juices for you. You drink them. They roast bulls for you, you eat them when you are invoked, Maghavan, to the sacrificial food.”</strong></p>
<p>This is interpreted by Sayana Acharya as follows:</p>
<p><strong>“You (O Indra), eat the cattle offered as oblations belonging to the worshippers who cook them for you.”</strong></p>
<p>Acharya Sayana explicitly mentions about sacrificing a bull in the introduction to Atharvaveda 9/4/1 as follows</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="574" height="156" class="wp-image-7620" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/12-de55437186.jpeg" alt="12-de55437186" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/12-de55437186.jpeg 574w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/12-de55437186-300x82.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 574px) 100vw, 574px" /></p>
<p><strong>“The Brahman after killing the bull, offers its meat to the different deities. In this hymn, the bull is praised, detailing which parts of the bull are attached to which deity as well as the importance of sacrificing the bull and the rewards of doing the same.”</strong></p>
<h1><strong>The Ashwamedha Yajna</strong></h1>
<p>The ‘<em>Practical Sanskrit English Dictionary’</em> by V. S. Apte (1890) gives the following meaning of ‘Ashwa-medha’</p>
<p>अश्वः प्रधानतया मेध्यते हिंस्यते अत्र</p>
<p><strong>“A Yajna in which a Horse is primarily sacrificed is called Ashwamedha. [A Horse Sacrifice]“</strong></p>
<p>The dictionary further goes on to say</p>
<p><strong>“In Vedic times this sacrifice was performed by kings desirous of offspring.”</strong></p>
<p>This statement is right when we turn to Shatapath Brahman 13/1/9/9.</p>
<p>To give readers a brief idea of Ashwamedha Yajna, I will briefly mention the entire ritual based on Hindu texts like Katyayana Srauta Sutra, Apastamba Sutra, etc; but I will not mention the obscene portion of the Ashwamedha ritual as it is irrelevant with the topic at hand.</p>
<p>The horse to be sacrificed is sprinkled with water, and the Adhvaryu and the sacrificer whisper mantras into its ear. Anyone who should stop the horse is ritually cursed, and a dog is killed symbolic of the punishment for the sinners. The horse is then set loose towards the North-East, to roam around wherever it chooses, for the period of one year (or half a year, according to some commentators). The horse is associated with the Sun, and its yearly course. If the horse wanders into neighbouring provinces hostile to the sacrificer, they must be subjugated. The wandering horse is attended by a hundred young men, sons of princes or high court officials, charged with guarding the horse from all dangers and inconvenience. During the absence of the horse, an uninterrupted series of ceremonies is performed in the sacrificer’s home.</p>
<p>After the return of the horse, more ceremonies are performed. I HAVE OMITTED THE OBSCENE PORTION OF THIS YAJNA IN THIS ARTICLE. Those who wish to read them can see Shukla Yajurveda Chapter 23; verses 19-31 and the commentary of classical scholars.</p>
<p>After this, the horse, a hornless he-goat, a wild ox are bound to sacrificial stakes near the fire, and seventeen other animals are attached to the horse. A great number of animals, both tame and wild, are tied to other stakes, according to a commentator 609 in total (Yajurveda, chapter 24 consists of an exact enumeration).</p>
<p>Then the horse is slaughtered. The horse is dissected, and its flesh roasted. Various parts are offered to a host of deities. Prayers are made for wealth, offspring and body strength.</p>
<p>In Rigveda, the clearest mention of Ashwamedha is made in Mandal 1 Sookt 162.  I will be quoting those verses of this hymn which directly prove that a horse was sacrificed and consumed. As we have already read the passages of Aitareya Brahman concerning the method of sacrificing the animal and distributing its meat, the following passages of the Rigveda will be easier to comprehend.</p>
<p>Rigveda 1/162/3 says,</p>
<p>एष छागः पुरो अश्वेन वाजिना पूष्णो भागो नीयते विश्वदेव्यः |</p>
<p>अभिप्रियं यत पुरोळाशमर्वता तवष्टेदेनं सौश्रवसाय जिन्वति ||</p>
<p><strong>This goat, the portion of Pushan, fit for all the gods, is brought first with the fleet courser, so that Twashtri may prepare him along with the horse, as an acceptable preliminary offering for the (sacrificial) food.</strong></p>

<p>Next verse 1/162/4 says,</p>
<p>यद धविष्यं रतुशो देवयानं तरिर्मानुषाः पर्यश्वं नयन्ति |</p>
<p>अत्रा पूष्णः परथमो भाग एति यज्ञं देवेभ्यः परतिवेदयन्नजः ||</p>
<p><strong>‘When the priests at the season (of this ceremony) lead forth the horse, the offering devoted to the gods, thrice round the (sacrificial fire) ; then the goat, the portion of Pushan (or Agni), goes first, announcing the sacrifice to the gods.’</strong></p>
<p>That is, the goat is first sacrificed and then the horse.</p>

<p>Verse 9 says,</p>
<p>यदश्वस्य क्रविषो मक्षिकाश यद वा सवरौ सवधितौ रिप्तमस्ति |</p>
<p>यद धस्तयोः शमितुर्यन नखेषु सर्वा ता ते अपि देवेष्वस्तु ||</p>
<p><strong>Whatever the flies may eat of the raw flesh of the horse; whatever is smeared upon the brush or upon the axe; (what is smeared) upon the hands or the nails of the immolator, may all this be with you, (horse) among the gods.</strong></p>
<p>Here we clearly see that the belief of the Vedic people was that horse was not actually dying. It was rather going to the world of the gods to enjoy a much better life, quite similar to the explanation given by Swami Prabhupada above.</p>

<p>verse 21, addressing the horse says,</p>
<p>न वा उ एतन मरियसे न रिष्यसि देवानिदेषि पथिभिः सुगेभिः |</p>
<p>हरी ते युञ्जा पर्षती अभूतामुपास्थाद वाजी धुरि रासभस्य ||</p>
<p><strong>Verily at this moment you do not die; nor are you harmed; for you go by auspicious paths to the gods. The horses of Indra, the steeds of the Maruts shall be yoked (to their cars), and a courser shall be placed in the shaft of the ass of the Ashwins (to bear you to heaven).</strong></p>
<p>Again, this verse explicitly proves the belief of the Vedic people that the sacrificial horse did not actually die but was trasported to noble heavenly worlds.</p>

<p>After finishing all the rites of the sacrifice, prayers were made for wealth, male offspring and bodily strength as is revealed by verse 22.</p>
<p>सुगव्यं नो वाजी सवश्व्यं पुंसः पुत्रानुत विश्वापुषं रयिम |</p>
<p>अनागास्त्वं नो अदितिः कर्णोतु कषत्रं नो अश्वो वनतां हविष्मान ||</p>
<p><strong>May this horse bring to us all-sustaining wealth, with abundance of cows, of excellent horses, and of male offspring: may the spirited steed bring us exemption from wickedness: may this horse, offered in oblation, procure for us bodily vigour.</strong></p>

<p>This hymn would be nonsense if the horse was not really killed and cooked. That the horse was to be actually immolated and that the body was cut up into fragments is clear ; that these fragments were dressed, partly boiled, and partly roasted, is also undisputable ; and although the expressions may be differently understood, yet there is little reason to doubt that part of the flesh was eaten by the assistants, part presented as a burnt offering to the gods.</p>
<h1><strong>Refuting Hindu polemics concerning Ashwamedha</strong></h1>
<p><strong>Hindu Argument (quoted from a Hindu apologetics website)</strong></p>
<p>The biggest accusation of cattle and cow slaughter comes in the context of the Yajnas that derived their names from different cattle like the Ashwamedh Yajna, the Gomedha Yajna and the Nar-medh Yajna. Even by the wildest stretch of the imagination the word Medha would not mean slaughter in this context.</p>
<p>It’s interesting to note what Yajurveda says about a horse</p>
<p>——————————————————–</p>
<p><em>Imam ma himsirekashafam pashum kanikradam vaajinam vaajineshu</em></p>
<p>Yajurveda 13.48</p>
<p>Do not slaughter this one hoofed animal that neighs and who goes with a speed faster than most of the animals.</p>
<p>———————————————————-</p>
<p>Aswamedha does not mean horse sacrifice at Yajna. Instead the Yajurveda clearly mentions that a horse ought not to be slaughtered.</p>
<p>In Shathapatha, Ashwa is a word for the nation or empire</p>
<p>The word medha does not mean slaughter. It denotes an act done in accordance to the intellect Alternatively it could mean consolidation, as evident from the root meaning of medha i.e. medhru san-ga-me</p>
<p>Raashtram vaa ashwamedhah</p>
<p>Annam hi gau</p>
<p>Agnirvaa ashwah</p>
<p>Aajyam medhah</p>
<p>(Shatpath 13.1.6.3)</p>
<p><strong>Response</strong></p>
<p>Even this argument is not upto the mark.  The tactic used by the Hindu apologists here is quoting only part of a verse (Yajurveda 13.48) and ignoring the rest; thus, attempting to mislead the gullible. Doing so gives a completely different picture that Vedas are instructing people not to kill a horse.</p>
<p>Firstly, we need to ascertain that who is this mantra being spoken to? Is it a legal prohibition or a prayer? Is this general or specific? Let us read the full mantra.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="690" height="165" class="wp-image-7621" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/18-caf29fb820.jpeg" alt="18-caf29fb820" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/18-caf29fb820.jpeg 690w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/18-caf29fb820-300x72.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px" /></p>
<p><strong>“O Agni, don’t harm this one-hoofed beautiful horse, swifter than most animals. I point out to you the wild rhinoceros. Let the wild rhinocerous be harmed by you. Let the enemy whom we hate be harmed by you.”</strong></p>
<p>As you can see this is actually a prayer by a selfish person asking his firegod Agni not to harm his own horses but to harm the wild animals, in this case a rhinocerous. So this verse is not a legal prohibition from killing horses. It is also prayer for the welfare of one’s own animals as every animal owner will naturally do. For example, there are many shepherds who pray to God to protect their cattle from undue harm so that he can sell them or kill them for food and thus they do not go waste. This prayer is on the same lines and thus cannot be taken as a prohibition of slaughtering horses.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="338" height="240" class="wp-image-7622 alignleft" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/19-b9e91e7e7e.jpeg" alt="19-b9e91e7e7e" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/19-b9e91e7e7e.jpeg 338w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/19-b9e91e7e7e-300x213.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 338px) 100vw, 338px" /></p>
<p>The next argument that Ashwa means a nation or empire, in the reference to Shatapath Brahman is also incorrect. For example, we all know that water is essential for the existence of life on this planet. But in many campaigns to prevent the wastage of water, we find slogans like ‘Water is Life’. Does this make the meaning of water to be life or the meaning of life to be water? Not at all. It is a mode of speech where figuratively water and life are equated to establish the importance of water. Similarly, in Vedic times, the horse-sacrifice was considered essential for a strong empire so much that it was equated to the nation itself. Performance of this sacrifice depicted the royal granduer. But the meaning of Ashwa can thus never become a nation. To claim so is ignorance.</p>
<p>If we read the quoted Brahman (13.1.63) further, it clearly differentiates between a nation and the ashwamedha by saying, “let him who holds royal sway perform the ashwamedha”.</p>
<p>A counter example to further nullify this argument will come from the same Shatapath Brahman. Who does not know that the Sacrifice (Yajna) and the Sacrificer (Yajmaan) are two different things. Yet Rishi Yajnavalkya says in Shatapath Brahman 13:2:2:1</p>
<p><strong>Yajmaano Yajna</strong></p>
<p>meaning the ‘<strong>Sacrifice is the Sacrificer</strong>‘. This mode of speech is very common in the Brahmanas. Only a person with the intention of twisting the meanings does not reveal this. Seeing all these evidences this argument of the Hindtuva polemicist also turns out to be false.</p>
<p>The final blow to this argument comes from the historical narratives of Mahabharata and Ramayana, where Hindus are clearly shown sacrificing a horse and other animals including cows.</p>
<p>The Ashwamedha Parv of Mahabharata, section 89, shlokas 1-5 says</p>
<p>1 [व]
<p>शमयित्वा पशून अन्यान विधिवद दविजसत्तमाः</p>
<p>तुरगं तं यथाशास्त्रम आलभन्त दविजातयः</p>
<p>2 ततः संज्ञाप्य तुरगं विधिवद याजकर्षभाः</p>

<p><strong>Vaisampayana said, ‘Having cooked, according to due rites, the other excellent animals that were sacrificed, the priests then sacrificed, agreeably to the injunctions of the scriptures, that steed (which had wandered over the whole world). After cutting that horse into pieces, conformably to scriptural directions, they caused Draupadi of great intelligence, who was possessed of the three requisites of mantras, things, and devotion, to sit near the divided animal. The Brahmanas then with cool minds, taking up the marrow of that steed, cooked it duly, O chief of Bharata’s race. King Yudhishthira the just, with all his younger brothers, then smelled, agreeably to the scriptures, the smoke, capable of cleansing one from every sin, of the marrow that was thus cooked. The remaining limbs, O king, of that horse, were poured into the fire by the sixteen sacrificial priests possessed of great wisdom.</strong></p>
<h1><strong>Meat Eating in Vedas including Cow meat</strong></h1>
<p>The Sanskrit word for meat is ‘<strong>Maamsam</strong>‘. Yaska Acharya’s Nirukt 4:3 says ‘<strong>Maamsam maananam va</strong>‘ (<strong>मांसं माननं</strong> <strong>वा</strong>) and ‘<strong>Maanasam va</strong>‘ (<strong>मानसं वा</strong>). The meaning of the former is ‘it is honoured’, while the later means ‘it is thought’. Durga Acharya, the most important classical commentator of Yaska’s Nirukt, explains the phrase ‘<strong>Maamsam maananam va</strong>‘ to mean, “It is prepared for a person who is honoured”. Explaining the phrase ‘<strong>Maanasam va</strong>‘ he says, “It is enjoyed by a person with hearty pleasure or by those who are intelligent’.</p>
<p>So we see that the very sanskrit word for meat is actually a permission for meat eating.</p>
<p>Atharvaveda 18/4/20 mentions the following.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="472" height="76" class="wp-image-7623" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/untitled.jpeg" alt="Untitled" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/untitled.jpeg 472w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/untitled-300x48.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 472px) 100vw, 472px" /></p>
<p><strong>Rich in cakes, rich in flesh, let the dish (charu) take seat here; to the world-makers, the road-makers, do we sacrifice, whoever of you are here, sharing in the oblation of the gods.</strong></p>
<p>verse 42 of the same hymn reads.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="332" height="77" class="wp-image-7624" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/untitled.png" alt="Untitled" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/untitled.png 332w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/untitled-300x70.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 332px) 100vw, 332px" /></p>
<p><strong>The mingled draught, the mess of rice, the flesh which I present to you, May these be full of food for you, distilling fatness, rich in sweets.</strong></p>
<p>The serving of meat to the guests is confirmed by Shatapath Brahman 3/4/1/2 which says,</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="695" height="126" class="wp-image-7625" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/untitled-1.png" alt="Untitled" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/untitled-1.png 695w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/untitled-1-300x54.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 695px) 100vw, 695px" /></p>
<p><strong>Now as to why it is called ‘guest-offering.’ He, the purchased Soma, truly comes as his (the sacrificer’s) guest,–to him (is offered) that (hospitable reception): even as for a king or a Brâhman one would cook a large ox or a large he-goat–for that is human (fare offered to a guest), and the oblation is that of the gods–so he prepares for him that guest-offering.</strong></p>
<h1><strong>Goghna- the guest for whom a cow is killed</strong></h1>
<p>Literally the word ‘<strong>Goghna</strong>‘ means a killer of cows. However in the ancient Indian context it has a unique application. The word ‘<strong>Goghna</strong>‘ occurs in ancient Indian Grammarian Panini’s book Ashtadhyayi. He mentions in Ashtadyayi 3/4/73</p>
<p>दाशगोघ्नौ संप्रदाने</p>
<p><strong>“The words ‘daasa’ and ‘goghna’ are irregularly formed and the affix in these denotes the idea of the Dative or Recipient.”</strong></p>
<p>What does Panini mean that the word ‘goghna’ denotes the idea of recipient? He intends to say that in popular usage ‘goghna’ does not mean ‘<strong>the killer of cow</strong>‘ but ‘he on whose coming the cow is killed in order to give him, that is to say, a guest’. It is this irregularly formed word ‘goghna’ which is made applicable to the priests, guests, sons-in-law, and not the regularly formed word ‘goghna’ which means ‘a killer of a cow’.</p>
<p><strong>Thus guests in ancient India were called ‘goghna’</strong>, because on their coming a cow was slaughtered to be served to them.</p>
<p>This is exactly the explanation given in the 14th century grammar book <em>Siddhanta Kaumudi</em> by Pandit Bhattoji Dikshit. This book is taught to university level students across India for learning sanskrit grammar. In it, the sutra of Panini दाशगोघ्नौ संप्रदाने is explained in the ‘Uttarkradant’ chapter as follows:</p>
<p>गां हंति तस्मै गौघ्नो.अतिथिः</p>
<p><strong>For it a cow is slaughtered; a guest is called ‘goghna’</strong></p>
<p>Almost similar definition of ‘goghna’ is provided by the Vedic commentator Acharya Sayana in his book <em>Maadhaviya dhaatuvrittih</em>. He writes</p>
<p>गौर्यस्मै दातुं हन्यते स गोघ्नः अतिथिः</p>
<p><strong>“A person for whom a cow is slaughtered, is known as ‘goghna’ and ‘atithi’ (guest).”</strong></p>
<p>Thus it is clear that in ancient India, cows were slaughtered for honouring the guests.</p>
<h1><strong>Refuting the Hindu polemic of cow being called ‘Aghnya’</strong></h1>
<p>Many Hindus trying to somehow hide these clear evidences give some lame arguments. One common argument is that a cow in Vedic literature is called ‘<strong>Aghnya</strong>‘ meaning ‘<strong>not fit to be killed</strong>‘ and therefore a cow cannot in any way be killed. Let us address this argument.</p>
<p><strong>Hindu Argument</strong></p>
<p>Not only the Vedas are against animal slaughter but also vehemently oppose and prohibit cow slaughter.Yajurveda forbids killing of cows, for they provide energizing food for human beings</p>
<p>———————————</p>
<p>Ghrtam duhaanaamaditim janaayaagne maa himsiheeh</p>
<p>Yajurveda 13.49</p>
<p>Do not kill cows and bulls who always deserve to be protected.</p>
<p>In Rigveda cow slaughter has been declared a heinous crime equivalent to human murder and it has been said that those who commits this crime should be punished.</p>
<p>—————————————–</p>
<p><em>Sooyavasaad bhagavatee hi bhooyaa atho vayam bhagvantah syaama</em></p>
<p>Addhi trnamaghnye vishwadaaneem piba shuddhamudakamaacharantee</p>
<p>Rigveda 1.164.40 or Atharv 7.73.11 or Atharv 9.10.20</p>
<p>The Aghnya cows – which are not to be killed under any circumstances– may keep themselves healthy by use of pure water and green grass, so that we may be endowed with virtues, knowledge and wealth.</p>
<p><strong>Response</strong></p>
<p>As with the previous arguments, this argument also has serious shortcomings. We’ve already dealt with Yajurveda 13/48 and seen that it wasn’t a legal prohibition against killing a horse. Similarly, this verse also is a prayer to protect one’s cows. Let me post before you the full mantra to demonstrate my position.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="724" height="228" class="wp-image-7626" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/25-2613c5ad91.jpeg" alt="25-2613c5ad91" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/25-2613c5ad91.jpeg 724w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/25-2613c5ad91-300x94.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 724px) 100vw, 724px" /></p>
<p><strong>“O Agni, don’t harm this our cow, the giver of thousands of comforts, the source of immense milk, yielding butter for the people.  I point out to you the forest cow. Let the wild forest cow be harmed by you. Let the enemy whom we hate be harmed by you.”</strong></p>
<p>Again we see, as in verse 48, that there is no legal prohibition in this verse on killing a cow for food. It is a prayer being made to the fire god Agni to protect one’s cows from undue harm due to the wrath of the fire god.All cowherds in the world pray to their own god to keep their cows safe from harm, so that they can sell their milk and other dairy products and earn profit. This does not mean that certain cows cannot be killed for food. To say so will be just an assumption.  If this verse was about prohibiting killing of cows, why would it talk about killing the forest cow? Anyone who would read the complete verse will realize that this verse cannot be taken as a prohibition for killing cows. That is why the Hindu polemicists never give the complete verse to their audience.</p>
<p>The next argument was that in the Vedas, a cow is called ‘<strong>Aghnya</strong>‘ meaning ‘<strong>not fit to be killed</strong>‘. By this argument they try to establish that as per the Vedas cows are not to be killed. This is again a flawed argument as even according to the cultures who have beef for food know that certain cows are not fit to be killed who bring more profit through dairy products; but there are also cows who do not give much profit and thus are fit to be killed.  Even the Vedic references where a cow is called ‘Aghnya’ cannot in any way be generalized for all the cows.</p>
<p>Consider the following mantra from Rigveda 1/164/27.</p>
<p>हिङकर्ण्वती वसुपत्नी वसूनां वत्समिछन्ती मनसाभ्यागात |</p>
<p>दुहामश्विभ्यां पयो अघ्न्येयं स वर्धतां महते सौभगाय ||</p>
<p><strong>“Making the ‘hin’ sound, the treasure queen, desiring the calf of treasures with her mind, has approached. Let this cow (aghnya) yield milk for the two Asvins, and may she grow for greater prosperity”</strong></p>
<p>This mantra is speaking about a particular cow which gives milk to the Asvins, the divine twin horsemen in the Rigveda. Again it is not a legal prohibition, but rather is a prayer to yiled milk for the Asvins. Moreover, classical Hindu commentators like Acharya Sayana interpret this verse and the one before it i.e. verse 26 in terms of metaphors of clouds, rain and the earth. He opines that the cow may be the rain cloud, the milk being the rain and the milker Vaayu, the god of wind who causes it to flow. The calf is the world longing for the rain to fall.</p>
<p>Thus, it will be incorrect to insist that this verse is speaking about all cows in the world, referring to them as ‘<strong>Aghnya</strong>‘. In order for anything to be prohibited it should be stated explicitly and without any ambiguity, This is the basis of all law. However, nothing on the lines of prohibition can be deduced from this verse and other verses where the word ‘<strong>Aghnya</strong>‘ exists.</p>
<p>But this one more important point I wish to share with regards to the meaning of the word ‘<strong>Aghnya</strong>‘. I agree that a meaning of ‘<strong>Aghnya</strong>‘ is ‘not fit to be killed’, however, this does not tell us the entire story. According to Yaska Acharya’s Nirukt, the word has two meanings as follows:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="398" height="41" class="wp-image-7627" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/alt.gif" alt="alt" /></p>
<p><strong>Aghnya means ‘not fit to be killed’ or ‘destroyer of sins‘</strong></p>
<p>Thus, we see why all the noise is being made on the first meaning of the word i.e. ‘not fit to be killed’; while the second meaning i.e. ‘destroyer of sins’ is being completely brushed under the carpet. This is a clear proof of intellectual dishonesty. Applying the second meaning to the verses where the word ‘Aghnya’ appears in the Vedas appears to be a more appealing prospect. Let us now read Rigveda 1/164/40 with this very meaning:</p>
<p>सूयवसाद भगवती हि भूया अथो वयं भगवन्तः सयाम |</p>
<p>अद्धि तर्णमघ्न्ये विश्वदानीं पिब शुद्धमुदकमाचरन्ती ||</p>
<p><strong>“O Aghnya (destroyer of sins), may you be rich in milk through abundant fodder; that we also may be rich (in abundance); eat grass at all seasons, and roaming (at will), drink pure water.”</strong></p>
<p>Notice that now this verse speaks nothing about not killing cows. A cow may be called ‘destroyer of sins’ due to the very fact that it was sacrificed as a burnt offering for cleansing a person’s sins. This is not a far fetched conclusion. However, the primary point is that in no terms in this verse and other verses like it implying any prohibition of cow slaughter. Even if ‘Aghnya’ is taken to mean ‘not fit to be killed’, it can only be taken to mean a particular kind of cow.</p>
<p>Thus, this argument also is not valid.</p>
<p>Some Hindus still try to show more mantras. which according to them, prohibit the killing of cows. However, when we look at those mantras, we find that they are again quoted out of context. One most commonly used mantra of that sort is Atharvaveda 1/16/4 which says,</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="712" height="129" class="wp-image-7628" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/28-4d9352092f.jpeg" alt="28-4d9352092f" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/28-4d9352092f.jpeg 712w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/28-4d9352092f-300x54.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 712px) 100vw, 712px" /></p>
<p><strong>“If you destroy a cow of ours, a human being, or a steed, We pierce you with this piece of lead so that you may not slay our men.”</strong></p>
<p>Even on a simple reading of this mantra, one cannot conlude that it is prohibiting killing cows for food. It is a merely threat for the enemies to not kill any cow, horse or people of the Vedic people so as to cause loss to them. For example, we know that chicken are bred in poultry farms so that they can later be sold in the market and people can consume them as food. Any owner of such a farm knows this. But still, if someone would want to harm his chicken unnecessarily, it would mean loss of wealth for him. As such he is ready to take protective action and ensure the safety of his chicken. He makes sure that no one steals any chicken from his farm to kill them, even though chicken are meant for food. So, he will ensure that such theieves are punished. Also, there is threat from many animals who might eat the chicken when he is unaware. For that he even kills the harmful animals to save his chicken. Consider that chicken owner saying, “if anyone will harm MY chicken, I will punish him”. Will the Hindutvavadis interpret his statement to mean that the chicken are not meant to be eaten? No. That would be totally ridiculous.</p>
<p>Similarly, in the verse of Atharvaveda, it is a threat of punishment for those who harm the cattle of Aryans. It is in no way a prohibition on slaughtering a cow for food. Considering all the evidences presented in this article, insisting that cows and other animals are not meant for food will be illogical.</p>
<h1><strong>Other evidences of beef eating</strong></h1>
<p>Brihadaranyak Upanishad 6/4/18 suggests a ‘super-scientific’ way of giving birth to a super intelligent child. It says,</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="423" height="135" class="wp-image-7629" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/29-7aabfeecd2.jpeg" alt="29-7aabfeecd2" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/29-7aabfeecd2.jpeg 423w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/29-7aabfeecd2-300x96.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 423px) 100vw, 423px" /></p>
<p><strong>“If a man wishes that a son should be born to him who will be a famous scholar, frequenting assemblies and speaking delightful words, a student of all the Vedas and an enjoyer of the full term of life, he should have rice cooked with the meat of a young bull or of one more advanced in years and he and his wife should eat it with clarified butter. Then they should be able to beget such a son.”</strong></p>
<p>Some Hindutvavadis try to play tricks even here by trying to twist the translation of few words like ‘Auksha’ and ‘Aarshabh”. They say they refer to certain medicinal plants and not a bull. To refute them, we are fortunate to have available the most ancient commentary on this mantra by none other than Adi Shankaracharya, revered by Hindus as the reviver of Hinduism in India and finishing off Buddhism and Jainism. Commenting on this verse he writes,</p>
<p>मांसमिक्षमोदनं मांसौदनम्. तन्मांसनियमार्थमाह – औक्षेण वा मांसेन. उक्षा सेचनसमर्थः पुंगवस्तदीयं मांसम्. रिषभस्ततो.अप्यधिकवयास्त दीयमार्षभं मांसम्.</p>
<p><strong>“Odan’ (rice) mixed with meat is called ‘Mansodan‘. On being asked whose meat it should be, he answers ‘Uksha‘. ‘Uksha‘ is used for an ox, which is capable to produce semen. Or the meat should be of a ‘Rishabh‘. ‘Rishabh’ is a bull more advanced in years than an ‘Uksha’.”</strong></p>
<p>Thus people trying to twist the mantras have no ground to stand on except deceit and fraud. This verse of Brihadaranyak Upanishad is clearly encouraging the eating of beef.</p>
<h1><strong>Animal Sacrifices in Mahabharata</strong></h1>
<p>The Anushasan Parv (Book 13); section 88 mentions many animal sacrifices which are can be done to please the Pitris (fathers). I will quote the significant sholkas</p>
<p>1 [य]
<p>किं सविद दत्तं पितृभ्यॊ वै भवत्य अक्षयम ईश्वर</p>
<p>किं हविश चिररात्राय किम आनन्त्याय कल्पते</p>
<p><strong>“Yudhishthira said, ‘O you of great puissance, tell me what that object is which, if dedicated to the Pitris, becomes inexhaustible! What Havi (oblation), again, (if offered) lasts for all time? What, indeed, is that which (if presented) becomes eternal?’”</strong></p>
[भ]
<p>5 दवौ मासौ तु भवेत तृप्तिर मत्स्यैः पितृगणस्य ह</p>
<p>तरीन मासान आविकेनाहुश चातुर्मास्यं शशेन तु</p>
<p>6 आजेन मासान परीयन्ते पञ्चैव पितरॊ नृप</p>
<p>वाराहेण तु षण मासान सप्त वै शाकुनेन तु</p>
<p>7 मासान अष्टौ पार्षतेन रौरवेण नवैव तु</p>
<p>गवयस्य तु मांसेन तृप्तिः सयाद दश मासिकी</p>
<p>8 मासान एकादश परीतिः पितॄणां माहिषेण तु</p>
<p>गव्येन दत्ते शराद्धे तु संवत्सरम इहॊच्यते</p>
<p>9 यथा गव्यं तथायुक्तं पायसं सर्पिषा सह</p>
<p>वाध्रीणसस्य मांसेन तृप्तिर दवादश वार्षिकी</p>
<p>10 आनन्त्याय भवेद दत्तं खड्गमांसं पितृक्षये</p>
<p>कालशाकं च लौहं चाप्य आनन्त्यं छाग उच्यते</p>
<p><strong>Bhishma said, “With fishes offered at Sraddhas, the Pitris remain gratified for a period of two months. With mutton they remain gratified for three months and with the flesh of the hare for four. With the flesh of the goat, O king, they remain gratified for five months, with bacon for six months, and with the flesh of birds for seven. With venison obtained from those deer that are called Prishata, they remain gratified for eight months, and with that obtained from the Ruru for nine months, and with the meat of the Gavaya for ten months. With the meat of the buffalotheir gratification lasts for eleven months. With beef presented at the Sraddha, their gratification, it is said, lasts for a full year. Payasa mixed with ghee is as much acceptable to the Pitris as beef. With the meat of the Vadhrinasa the gratification of the Pitris lasts for twelve years. The flesh of the rhinoceros, offered to the Pitris on the anniversaries of the lunar days on which they died, becomes inexhaustible.</strong></p>
<p>Clearly there can be no doubt that meat of all kinds was extensively used in sacrifice rituals to please one’s fathers who had died.</p>
<p>Sacrificial slaughter of cows is also  mentioned in Mahabharata, Shalya Parv, Section 41. A king called Rantidev is mentioned in the Vana Parv, section 207 as well as section 199, as follows</p>
<p>7 राज्ञॊ महानसे पूर्वं रन्तिदेवस्य वै दविज</p>
<p>दवे सहस्रे तु वध्येते पशूनाम अन्वहं तदा</p>
<p>8 समांसं ददतॊ हय अन्नं रन्तिदेवस्य नित्यशः</p>
<p>अतुला कीर्तिर अभवन नृपस्य दविजसत्तम</p>
<p><strong>“And in days of yore, O Brahmana, two thousand animals used to be killed every day in the kitchen of king Rantideva; and in the same manner two thousand cows were killed every day; and, O best of regenerate beings, king Rantideva acquired unrivalled reputation by distributing food with meat every day.”</strong></p>
<p>Some Hindus bigots try to claim that these are interpolation and later additions in Mahabharat. However, there is no evidence to conclude that. This is only a bogus claim of those who are unwilling to accept that their ancestors used to eat beef.</p>
<p>Nowadays an effort is being made in India to establish the society based on the principle of Manu, however, no clear-cut picture or its implementation is drawn out. It is interesting that the same Manu permits eating of meat and does not list the killing of cows in the major sins.</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 5/35 mentions,</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="682" height="39" class="wp-image-7630" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/alt-1.gif" alt="alt" /></p>
<p><strong>“But a man who, being duly engaged (to officiate or to dine at a sacred rite), refuses to eat meat, becomes after death an animal during twenty-one existences.”</strong></p>
<p>Manu Smriti 5/56 says</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="615" height="37" class="wp-image-7631" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/alt-2.gif" alt="alt" /></p>
<p><strong>“There is no sin in eating meat, in (drinking) spirituous liquor, and in carnal intercourse, for that is the natural way of created beings, but abstention brings great rewards.”</strong></p>
<h1><strong>The testimony of ancient Indian medical texts</strong></h1>
<p>Modern Hindus usually are seen boasting about India’s scientific heritage, especially of medical texts like <em>Charaka Samhita</em> and <em>Sushruta Samhita</em>, which they think are proof of the advancement of science in the ancient Hindu society. No doubt that like other nations of the word ancient Hindus too have contributed to our knowledge, epecially science and mathematics. I will now reveal before you the medicinal benefits of cow meat as enshrined in ancient Indian medical texts. I will not be commenting on the medical validity of the passages. They are only given to prove that cow meat was consumed.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="376" height="62" class="wp-image-7632" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/alt-3.gif" alt="alt" /></p>
<p><strong>“Cow meat is beneficial in curing breathing problems, Ozaena, Ague, dry cough, fatigue, diseases due to burns and marasmus.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Charaka Samhita, Sutra Sthaanam, 27/79-80]</strong></p>
<p>Charaka Samhita, Chikitsa Sthaanam 8/163 says,</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="416" height="71" class="wp-image-7633" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/alt-4.gif" alt="alt" /></p>
<p><strong>“A person of magnanimous heart who eats meat along with a wine named as ‘Maadhveek’, is quickly relieved of tuberculosis.</strong></p>
<p>Charaka Samhita, Chikitsa Sathaanam 8/165 says,</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="350" height="69" class="wp-image-7634" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/alt-5.gif" alt="alt" /></p>
<p><strong>“While consuming the above mentioned kinds of meat, one may have a dose of whichever wine is appropriate such as ‘Prasanna’, ‘Vaarooni’, ‘seedhu’, ‘arisht’, ‘aasava’ and ‘madhu’.”</strong></p>
<p>Besides the cow, meat of other animals is also prescribes for various diseases. For example, Sutra 158 of the same chapter says,</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="353" height="67" class="wp-image-7635" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/alt-6.gif" alt="alt" /></p>
<p><strong>“Meat of a peacock, patridge, rooster, goose, swine, camel, donkey, cow and buffalo is beneficial for developing one’s body.”</strong></p>
<p>Although there are numerous other references from Charaka Samhita prescribing meat for various other ddiseases, I feel the above mentioned passages are sufficient to prove that no meat was prohibited in ancient Indian society. It was freely taken as cure for various diseases and improving one’s health.</p>
<h1><strong>The testimony of classical scholars</strong></h1>
<p>To conclude my article establishing that the Vedas and the subsidiary texts permit beef eating as well as sacrificing animals, I will post the testimony of renowned classical Hindu scholars, besides the other notale scholars I have already quoted.</p>
<p><strong>1. Adi Shankaracharya</strong></p>
<p>Adi Shankaracharya has written an extensive commentary on the famous Brahma Sutras. In his commentary on Brahma Sutra Adhyaai 3, Paada 1, Sutra 25 he writes,</p>
<p><strong>“None therefore can know, without scripture, what is either right or wrong. Now from scripture we derive the certain knowledge that the gyotishtoma-sacrifice, which involves harm done to animals (i.e. the animal sacrifice), is an act of duty; how then can it be called unholy?–But does not the scriptural precept, ‘Do not harm any creature,’ intimate that to do harm to any being is an act contrary to duty?–True, but that is a general rule, while the precept, ‘Let him offer an animal to Agnîshomau,’ embodies an exception; and general rule and exception have different spheres of application. The work (i.e. sacrifice) enjoined by the Veda is therefore holy, being performed by authoritative men and considered blameless;”</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. Acharya Ramanuja</strong></p>
<p>Acharya Ramanuja also has written a very famed commentary on the Brahma Sutras called ‘Sri Bhasya’. Commenting on the same Sutra 25 he writes,</p>
<p><strong>“Scripture declares that the killing of sacrificial animals makes them to go up to the heavenly world, and therefore is not of the nature of harm. This is declared in the text, ‘The animal killed at the sacrifice having assumed a divine body goes to the heavenly world’; ‘with a golden body it ascends to the heavenly world.’ An action which is the means of supreme exaltation is not of the nature of harm, even if it involves some little pain; it rather is of beneficial nature.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. Sikand Swami</strong></p>
<p>This 7th century commentator of the Vedas, while commenting on Rigveda 1/1/4 writes,</p>
<p><strong>“Yajna is good for everyone, and no one is injured. The animals who are sacrificed, also gain ultimate good. The ancestors say, “the animals that are sacrificed in the Yajna, obtain the higher worlds”</strong></p>
<p>There must remain no doubt in the anyone’s mind after seeing all these testimonies that the Vedic religion permits beef eating and also sacrificing the animals is considered as an investment for greater good.</p>

<p>Written by Sulaiman Razvi</p>
<p>Meat especially that of cow is the centre of controversy in India. People are lynched and raped on rumours of beef consumption but such mentality didn&#8217;t exist in Vedic period, people in the Vedic period relished beef and meat of other animals. There are clear references in Vedas about meat consumption, but some Hindu scholars don&#8217;t translate it literally despite the fact that it is supported by other Hindu texts. Vedas no-where says that &#8216;You shouldn&#8217;t have meat&#8217;, Hindu scriptures doesn&#8217;t prohibit meat consumption, it&#8217;s only Hindu scholars that prohibits it. In the Vedas the cattle were gifted to other Deities, because it was a source of money during the Vedic period. A historian William Butler writes,</p>
<p>&#8220;The people among whom the Veda were composed, as here introduced to us, had evidently passed the nomadic stage. Their wealth consisted of Horses, Cattle, Sheep, Goats and Buffaloes. Coined money, and indeed money in any shape, was unknown. We meet but two allusions to gold, except for the purpose of ornaments. The cow was to the Vedic Hindu at once food and money.&#8221;<br />

<p>A recent survey found that 70% Indians are non-vegetarians. <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.in/2016/06/18/over-70-indians-are-meat-eaters-but-indian-tv-continues-to-vil/" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">http://www.huffingtonpost.in/2016/06/18/over-70-indians-are-meat-eaters-but-indian-tv-continues-to-vil/<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>While according to BBC report, just 20% of Indians are vegetarians,<br />
&#8220;But new research by US-based anthropologist Balmurli Natrajan and India-based economist Suraj Jacob, points to a heap of evidence that even these are inflated estimations because of &#8220;cultural and political pressures&#8221;. So people under-report eating meat &#8211; particularly beef &#8211; and over-report eating vegetarian food.<br />
Taking all this into account, say the researchers, only about 20% of Indians are actually vegetarian &#8211; much lower than common claims and stereotypes suggest.<br />
Hindus, who make up 80% of the Indian population, are major meat-eaters. Even only a third of the privileged, upper-caste Indians are vegetarian.&#8221;<br />

<p>As per National Family Health Survey (NHFS-5) 2019-21, 52.5% Hindu men and 40.7% Hindu women are non vegetarians.<br />

<p>India is also the world&#8217;s largest exporter of beef.<br />
<a href="http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-on-top-in-exporting-beef/article7519487.ece" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-on-top-in-exporting-beef/article7519487.ece<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>Despite these facts Hindus views non-vegetarians especially Muslims as demons equivalent to cannibals. Hindu apologists says that veg diet is healthy and non-veg diet is unhealthy but they aren&#8217;t aware of the fact that veg diet doesn&#8217;t provide required amount of nutrients and there are several risks associated with veg diet, vegetarians suffer from B12 deficiency. Vitamin B12 is found in non-veg food and egg is a key source of vitamin B12. You may like to go through the following links,</p>

<p><strong>Hindu Scholars on Meat Consumption</strong></p>
<p>Swami Vivekananda writes that Aryans used to relish beef,</p>
<p>&#8220;There was a time in this very India when, without eating beef, no Brahmin could remain a Brahmin&#8221; The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda, Volume 3 <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Complete_Works_of_Swami_Vivekananda/Volume_3/Lectures_from_Colombo_to_Almora/Reply_to_the_Address_of_Welcome_at_Madura" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Complete_Works_of_Swami_Vivekananda/Volume_3/Lectures_from_Colombo_to_Almora/Reply_to_the_Address_of_Welcome_at_Madura<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>Adishankaracharya writes,</p>
<p>&#8220;Odan&#8217; (rice) mixed with meat is called &#8216;Mansodan&#8217;. On being asked whose meat it should be, he answers &#8216;Uksha&#8217;. &#8216;Uksha&#8217; is used for an ox, which is capable to produce semen. Or the meat should be of a &#8216;Rishabh&#8217;. &#8216;Rishabh&#8217; is a bull more advanced in years than an &#8216;Uksha&#8217;.&#8221; <strong>Adishankaracharya in his commentary on Brihadaranyak Upanishad 6/4/18</strong></p>
<p>Ramanujacharya writes,</p>
<p>&#8220;In the Agnisomiya sacrifice no real harm is caused to the animal victim; for according to the Vedic Texts, the victim —a goat, after abandoning an inferior body, will attain a higher rebirth, with a beautiful body. The Text pertaining to immolation declares: — &#8216;O animal, by this (immolation) you never die, you are not destroyed. You will pass through happy paths to the realm of the gods, where the virtuous, not the sinful reach. May the god Savitar give you a suitable place.&#8217; (Yajñ, 4.6.9.46; Taitt. Br. iii 7.2).<br />
Likewise the attainment of more beautiful bodies by those who die here in this war [which is like a sacrifice] has been declared in the Gita (2.22). Hence, just as a surgeon makes an incision and performs other surgical procedures for the purpose of curing a patient, the immolation of the sacrificial animal in the Agnisomiya and other sacrifices contributes to its welfare.&#8221; <strong>Ramanujaacharya in his commentary on Bhagavad Gita 2.32</strong></p>
<p>If you ask Hindus as to why we shouldn&#8217;t have meat, they give irrational answer, they say &#8216;We should not slaughter animals because animals feel pain&#8217;. This answer is not convincing and is only a shift of logic. Before it was discovered that even Plants have life they used to say &#8216;We should not slaughter animals because they have life&#8217; and now they started this &#8216;Animals feel pain&#8221; issue. Here are some excerpts from Hindu texts which shows how the logic was changed,</p>
<p>Mahabharat Book 13, Section 115 &#8220;… Thou hast said so while discoursing formerly upon the ordinances in respect of Sraddhas. How can meat, however, be procured without slaying a living creature…&#8221; Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Mahabharata Book 13, Section 116 &#8220;…Flesh cannot be had from grass or wood or stone. Unless a living creature is slain, it cannot be had. Hence is the fault in eating flesh&#8230;&#8221; Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Founder of Arya Samaj Swami Dayanand Saraswati writes in his book,</p>
<p>&#8220;It is childish to say that there is no sin in eating meat…for meat cannot be had without killing animals, and it can never be right to hurt or kill animals without an offence.- Satyarth Prakash, Swami Dayanand Saraswati, p.342, Tr. Chiranjiva Bhardwaj.</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 5.48. Meat can never be obtained without injury to living creatures, and injury to sentient beings is detrimental to (the attainment of) heavenly bliss; let him therefore shun (the use of) meat.</p>
<p>These passages doesn&#8217;t say that we shouldn&#8217;t have meat because they feel pain but it says that we should not slaughter animals because they have life, they are living creatures. However these passages shouldn&#8217;t be taken as prohibition for meat consumption because Vedic deities used to consume beef every day, but meat consumption appears occasionally, i.e., for sacrifices in later texts. Manu Smriti 5.48 is explained in Vasistha Dharma Shastra 4.5-8 and Mahabharata 13.116 permits meat consumption on the condition that it is first offered to the gods and Pitrs (ancestors). I have explained those verses from Manu Smriti in this article. Researchers have found that even plants feel pain,</p>
<p>Researchers Have Found That Plants Know They Are Being Eaten<br />
<a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/plants-know-they-are-being-eaten-2014-10?IR=T" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">http://www.businessinsider.com/plants-know-they-are-being-eaten-2014-10?IR=T<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>Bad news for vegetarians! Plants can ‘hear’ themselves being eaten &#8211; and become defensive when attacked<br />

<p>Indian scientist Jagdish Chandra Bose was one of the first scientist to discover that plants feel pain.<br />
<a href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/education/story/jagadish-chandra-bose-proved-plants-have-life/1/664259.html" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">http://indiatoday.intoday.in/education/story/jagadish-chandra-bose-proved-plants-have-life/1/664259.html<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>Doctors say that meat of fish, chicken and egg are very good for health then why should anyone abstain from it? Although it&#8217;s proved that even plants have life and feels pain but if vegan Hindus don&#8217;t eat meat merely because animals feel pain then will they eat egg? Egg doesn&#8217;t feel pain when you make omelette from it or boil it, so will Brahmins eat egg if the issue is all about pain? If the issue is about pain then will they be okay with slaughtering animals after proper anaesthesia is administered?</p>

<h3><a id="post-6065-Buddhism-Jainism"></a>Influence of Buddhism and Jainism on Hinduism</h3>
<p>Hundreds and thousands of animals were slaughtered as per Hindu texts. But animal slaughter became a taboo in Hindu society only after Hinduism was influenced by other religions like Buddhism and Jainism.</p>
<p>Swami Prabhupada the founder of ISKCON writes in the commentary of Bhagwad Purana 1.3.24,</p>
<p>&#8220;…Lord Buddha superficially denied the authority of the Vedas. This rejection of the Vedas by Lord Buddha was adopted in order to save people from the vice of animal-killing as well as to save the poor animals from the slaughtering process of their big brothers who clamor for universal brotherhood, peace, justice and equity. There is no justice when there is animal-killing. Lord Buddha wanted to stop it completely, and therefore his cult of ahimsa was propagated not only in India but also outside the country…&#8221; <strong>Swami Prabhupada on Bhagwad Purana 1.3.24</strong> [ <a href="http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_1.3.24" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_1.3.24<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> ]
<p>So Buddha rejected the authority of Vedas because Vedas sanctions animal slaughter and Hindus of his time sacrificed animals and he wanted them to stop this Vedic practice. Swami Vivekananda is of the same view. He writes,</p>
<p>&#8220;In what way do you see this importance of Buddhism in India today?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;It is obvious and overwhelming. You see India never loses anything; only she takes time to turn everything into bone and muscle. Buddha dealt a blow at animal sacrifice from which India has never recovered; and Buddha said, &#8216;Kill no cows&#8217;, and cow-killing is an impossibility with us.&#8221; <strong>The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda, Volume 5</strong><br />
<a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Complete_Works_of_Swami_Vivekananda/Volume_5/Interviews/Reawakening_Of_Hinduism_On_A_National_Basis" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Complete_Works_of_Swami_Vivekananda/Volume_5/Interviews/Reawakening_Of_Hinduism_On_A_National_Basis<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>Some scholars also say that people during Buddha&#8217;s time misinterpreted Vedas and started slaughtering animals in Vedic Yajnas, so to stop animal slaughter Buddha completely rejected the Vedas and established anti-Vedic philosophy called Buddhism. My question is, if Vedas do not sanction animal slaughter and people only misinterpreted the Vedas then why didn&#8217;t Buddha the avatar of Vishnu (as per Hinduism) revive the Vedas? Why wasn&#8217;t he born as a revivalist who should&#8217;ve correctly interpreted the meaning of the Vedas?</p>
<p>Following verses from Skanda Purana shows that animal slaughter was prevalent in 10<sup>th</sup> century during the reign of Kumarapala,</p>
<p>Skanda Purana III.ii.36.62 &#8220;[Kumarapala said] O Brahmanas, I shall not abide and honour the Royal Charter issued by Rama. I disown the Brahmanas who indulge in violence and kill animals in Yajna. There is no question of my having any respect for and devotion to these killers.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Kumarapala was a 10th century A.D king who had embraced Jainism, This shows that Brahmins were engaged in slaughtering animals in 10th century also. There is a story of another king named Vena who had also embraced Jainism and stopped animal slaughter in Vedic Yajnas,</p>
<p>Padma Purana II.37.32b-42 &#8220;[The sinful one said] I shall tell you another fierce act (mentioned) in the Vedas. When a guest goes (ie. arrives) to the house, a brahmana (kills and) cooks (the flesh of) a goat. (They kill) a horse in a horse- sacrifice, and a bull in a bull sacrifice; a man in human sacrifice and goats in a Vajapeya sacrifice. O great king, a great slaughter of many animals is done at a Rajasuya sacrifice. At a Pundarika sacrifice one would kill (i.e. one kills) an elephant, and at an elephant sacrifice (they kill) an elephant. At the Sautramani sacrifice a beast is seen to be fit for being sacrificed. Thus, O prince, listen how at rites of various forms of killing of beasts of various species is laid down…&#8221; Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p>Buddhism and Jainism were wiped out from India by Hindu kings and scholars probably because of their dominance and confrontation with Hinduism. Animal slaughter in Vedic sacrifices and rituals was often the main topic of debate between Buddhist/Jain and Brahmins where Buddhist/Jains had some valid points against Brahmin beliefs. Vishnu Purana says that demons after embracing Buddhism and Jainism started criticizing animal slaughter sanctioned by the Vedas, One of the main point raised by Buddhist/Jain converts was,</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 3.18.21-30 “The delusions of the false teacher paused not with the conversion of the Daityas to the Jaina and Bauddha heresies, but with various erroneous tenets he prevailed upon others to apostatize, until the whole were led astray, and deserted the doctrines and observances inculcated by the three Vedas. Some then spake evil of the sacred books; some blasphemed the gods; some treated sacrifices and other devotional ceremonies with scorn; and others calumniated the Brahmans. &#8220;The precepts,&#8221; they cried, &#8220;that lead to the injury of animal life (as in sacrifices) are highly reprehensible. To say that casting butter into flame is productive of reward, is mere childishness. If Indra, after having obtained godhead by multiplied rites, is fed upon the wood used as fuel in holy fire, he is lower than a brute, which feeds at least upon leaves. If an animal slaughtered in religious worship is thereby raised to heaven, would it not be expedient for a man who institutes a sacrifice to kill his own father for a victim? If that which is eaten by one at a Śráddha gives satisfaction to another, it must be unnecessary for one who resides at a distance to bring food for presentation in person.&#8221; Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Swami Dayanand Saraswati also writes about this,</p>
<p>&#8220;Eleven arguments in favored by the Charvaka Faith</p>
<p>3.&#8221;If the animal offered as sacrifice goes to heaven, why does not the Yajmana (master of ceremonies) send his parents, etc., to heaven, by killing them by way of sacrifice.&#8221; <strong>Satyarth Prakash, Ch 11, page 508, by Swami Dayanand Saraswati, Tr. Chiranjiva Bhardwaja</strong></p>
<p>Dayanand replies to this argument in the following way,</p>
<p>&#8220;3, 4, 5. The Veda and other Shaastras do not at all sanction animal sacrifice; the practice of offering oblations to the manes of departed ancestors is an invention of priests, because it is opposed to the Vedic and Shaastric teachings and finds sanction only in the Puraana like the Bhagvat. We have, therefore, nothing to say against the refutation of this doctrine.&#8221; <strong>Satyarth Prakash, Ch 11, page 509, by Swami Dayanand Saraswati, Tr. Chiranjiva Bhardwaja</strong></p>
<p>Swami Dayanand Saraswati cleverly tries to get rid of it by saying there is no sanction in Vedas. It&#8217;s true that Shraddha to Pitrs (ancestors) is not mentioned in Vedas but oblation to departed ancestors is mentioned in Shastras and animal slaughter is mentioned in Vedas and supported by other texts like Brahmanas, Puranas so there is no way out but to accept that Vedas permits animal slaughter. All these verses shows that Hindus used to slaughter animals till Buddhism and Jainism became prevalent and also shows that Hinduism was later influenced by these religions and adopted vegetarianism and later on animal slaughter was considered sinful in Hindu society.</p>

<p>मेष [Mesha] = Ram/Sheep.</p>
<p>पचत [Pachat] = Cooked</p>
<p>Above is Shri Ram Sharma&#8217;s Hindi translation.</p>
<p>Apologist present some verses which according to them prohibits meat consumption but those verses are quoted out of context, those verses have historical context, for instance it&#8217;s mentioned in the Vedas</p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.87.16 The <strong>fiend</strong> [non Aryan, Dasyu, Rakshas, Mleccha] who smears himself with flesh of cattle, with flesh of horses and of human bodies, Who steals the milch-cow&#8217;s milk away, O Agni,-tear off the heads of such with fiery fury.</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 1.16.4 If thou [Foreigners] destroy a cow of ours, a human being, or a steed, We pierce thee with this piece of lead so that thou mayst not slay our men.</p>
<p>These verses refer to the foreigners/Non Aryans [Maleccha, Rakshasa] or enemies of deities of Vedic period, that they should not kill the Aryans, cows or horses OF THE Aryans as Cows and Horses were sources of wealth and horses were also used for warfare, you can have meat of other castes or of foreigners (non Aryans). Who would like their wealth to be destroyed? Just like stealing milk of cow is wrong similarly killing animals belonging to other people is considered sinful in those verses. The verse Rig Veda 10.87.16 also prohibits stealing milk but it doesn&#8217;t mean that you shouldn&#8217;t consume milk, you can have milk after buying it similarly you can have meat after buying meat or animal. There may be some confusion among Hindus whether to eat cow or not but there is hardly any prohibition in Vedas to slaughter bull although Vedas do not prohibit any kind of meat.</p>
<p>Some Hindus might say those verses I mentioned above has historical context but they shouldn&#8217;t be viewed in a context as all verses are eternal and it&#8217;s applicable for all ages. Does that mean you should eat dog&#8217;s intestines when you are in deep distress? Because the Vedas says,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 4.18.13 In deep distress I cooked a dog&#8217;s intestines. Among the Gods I found not one to comfort. My consort I beheld in degradation. The Falcon then brought me the pleasant Soma.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="473" height="105" class="wp-image-6075" src="http://vedkabhed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/http-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-2016-8.png" alt="http://truthabouthinduism.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/112016_1617_meat9.png" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/http-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-2016-8.png 473w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/07/http-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-2016-8-300x67.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 473px) 100vw, 473px" /></p>
<p>This verse has a historical context which I am not going to explain, does that mean you should eat dog&#8217;s intestines when you are anxious?</p>
<p>The reason why it&#8217;s difficult to find verses on meat consumption in the Vedas (from few Hindu translators) is because some Hindu scholars don&#8217;t view the animal sacrifice as literal slaughtering but they view it as charity or symbolic slaughtering. So Hindus should ask their scholars to literally translate the Sanskrit verses on meat consumption and I am sure all their doubts on meat eating will be cleared. Vedic verses clearly uses words like Mamsa (Meat), Pachat (Cook) etc., Which is pretty clear for meat consumption but some Hindu scholars likes to add their own words into it, they give their own meanings.</p>
<p>Some Hindu apologists might say Yajnas does not contain killing, Yajnas are non-violent etc.,  But they cannot deny the fact that the animals which were brought as oblation were thrown into the fire,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.91.14-15 He [Agni/Fire] <strong>in whom</strong> horses, bulls, oxen, and barren cows, and rams, when duly set apart, are <strong>offered up</strong>,- To Agni, Soma-sprinkled, drinker of sweet juice, Disposer, with my heart I bring a fair hymn forth. Into thy [Agni&#8217;s] mouth is poured <strong>the offering</strong>, Agni, as Soma into cup, oil into ladle…</p>

<p>Manu Smriti 3.76 An oblation duly thrown into the fire, reaches the sun; from the sun comes rain, from rain food, therefrom the living creatures (derive their subsistence).</p>
<p>Rig Veda 3.59.5 The great Aditya, to be served with worship, who stirreth men, is gracious to the singer. To Mitra, him most highly to be lauded, offer in fire [the] oblation that he loveth.</p>

<p>Satapatha Brahmana 6.2.1.14 Now when he slaughters those animals, he prepares a home for Agni; for nowhere but in his home does one enjoy himself. But the home means food: it is that he lays down in, front, and when Agni sees that, he turns unto him.</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana 11:7:1:1- He performs the animal sacrifice. Now the animal sacrifice means cattle: thus, when he performs the animal sacrifice (pasubandha, the binding of the animal), it is in order that he may be possessed of cattle…And when he performs the animal sacrifice, he renews his fires, and so, along with the renewal of his fires, does the Sacrificer (renew himself), and along with the Sacrificer his house and cattle. And beneficial to life, indeed, is that redemption of his own self; for whilst he is offering the Sacrificer&#8217;s fires long for flesh; they set their minds on the Sacrificer and harbour designs on him. In other fires people do indeed cook any kind of meat, but these (sacrificial fires) have no desire for any other flesh but this (sacrificial animal), and for him to whom they belong.</p>
<p>Asvalayana Grihya Sutra, IV Adhyaya, 8 Kandika, 25 &#8220;The husks and chaff (of the rice), the tail, the skin, the head, the feet (of the sacrificial animal) he should throw into the fire.</p>

<p>Read Rig Veda 1.162.19 which I have mentioned above which talks about meat balls of horse put into the fire, We can obtain meat balls only after killing the horse, So it is a undeniable fact that animals were killed in the Yajna.  As I said earlier Hindu scholars don&#8217;t view the sacrifice as literal for instance Veda says</p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.104.3 To make thee [Indra] start, a strong true draught I offer to thee, the Bull [as a oblation], O thou whom Bay Steeds carry.</p>
<p>Rig Veda 5.29.8 When thou [Indra] three hundred buffaloes&#8217; flesh hadst eaten, and drunk, as Maghavan, three lakes of Soma, All the Gods raised as &#8217;twere a shout of triumph to Indra praise because he slew the Dragon.</p>
<p>I have given the Hindi translation of Rig Veda 5.29.8 by Pundit Ram Govind Trivedi. Some scholars have skipped the Sanskirt word Maas (Meat/Flesh) in their translation, A Hindu scholar Ram Acharya has translated the verse 5.29.8 as Indra &#8221;ACCEPTED&#8221; the three hundred buffaloes instead of &#8220;Eaten&#8221; he has also omitted the word Maas (Flesh/Meat), even if he just accepted the buffaloes then it means later he ate them because Veda commands Indra and Agni to eat the oblation which they receive,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.116.8 Eat, Indra, <strong>these oblations which approach thee</strong>: be pleased with food made ready and with Soma.</p>

<p>Rig Veda 2.1.13-14 The A&#8217;dityas have made thee, Agni, their mouth; the pure (deities) have made thee, Kavi, their tongue: the (gods), the givers of wealth, depend upon thee at sacrifices; they eat the offered oblation through thee [Agni]. All the benignant immortal gods eat the offered oblation through thee, as their mouth: mortals taste the flavour (of all viands) through thee: thou art born pure, the embryo of plants.</p>

<p>Indra, Agni and other gods were commanded to eat the offered oblations, therefore they did consume meat. In Vedas, there are two more verses about bulls brought for sacrifice,</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 9.4.9 …that Brahman gives a thousand who offers up the Bull as his oblation.</p>

<p>We have already read that the cattle which were brought as oblation/offerings were put in the fire and later on eaten, so it is a pretty much clear that Hindu deities used to partake beef.</p>
<p>Hindu extremists make so much hue and cry over cow slaughter today but cow slaughter was a common practice in Vedic period,</p>
<p>Krishna Yajur Veda 2.5.5.3-4 On the full moon (the Soma) is pressed for the gods; during this half-month it is pressed forth for them, and a cow for Mitra and Varuna is to be slaughtered for them at the new moon. In that he sacrifices on the day before…In that he sacrifices at the new moon with clotted curds for Mitra and Varuna, the cow which is slaughtered for the gods becomes his also.</p>
<p>Krishna Yajur Veda 2.2.9.6 At the time of the (offering of the) cow, he should offer on one potsherd to Mitra and Varuna, this (offering) corresponds to his foe&#8217;s cow which is to be slaughtered</p>
<p>Krishna Yajur Veda 5.1.8 …if he were to let them go after circumambulation with fire, he would disturb the sacrifice; if he were to keep them until the conclusion, the heads would be exhausted; in that he offers the animals, he wins thereby animals; in that he lets them go after circumambulation with fire, (it serves) to prevent the exhaustion of the heads; he concludes (the rite) with (an animal) for Prajapati; Prajapati is the sacrifice; verily he concludes the sacrifice in the sacrifice…</p>

<h3><a id="post-6065-Ashvamedha-Yajna"></a>Ashvamedha Yajna</h3>
<p>Veda clearly speaks of animal killing and putting it in the Agni (Fire) during Yajna, one of the most popular hymn about animal slaughter is from the Rig Veda about Horse sacrifice (Ashvamedha Yajna). Ashvamedha mentioned in Rig Veda deals with slaughtering and cooking of the sacrificial horse. I am using English translation of H.H Wilson and Hindi translation of Pundit Ram Govind Trivedi,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.162.9 “Whatever the flies may eat of the raw flesh of the horse; whatever (grease) is smeared upon the brush or upon the axe ; (what is smeared) upon the hands or the nails of the immolator, may all this be with thee, (horse), among the gods.” Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>

<p>Rig Veda 1.162.10 Whatever undigested grass fall from his belly ; whatever particle&#8221; <strong>of raw flesh</strong> may remain let the immolators make the whole free from defect, and so cook the pure (offering) that it may be perfectly dressed.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s see what other scriptures says about Horse Sacrifice</p>
<p>Krishna Yajur Veda 5.4.12.1 It is the twenty onefold day, <strong>on which the horse is slain</strong>, there are twelve months, five seasons; these worlds are three</p>
<p>Krishna Yajur Veda 5.3.12. The eye of Prajapati swelled, that fell away, that became a horse; because it swelled (áçvayat), that is the reason why the horse (áçva) has its name. By the horse sacrifice the gods replaced it. He who sacrifices with the horse sacrifice makes Prajapati whole; verily he becomes whole; this is the atonement for everything, and the cure for everything. All evil by it the gods overcame; by it also the gods overcame (the sins of) Brahman- slaying; all evil [1] he overcomes, he overcomes Brahman-slaying who sacrifices with the horse sacrifice, and he who knows it thus. It was the left eye of Prajapati that swelled; therefore they cut off from the horse on the left side, on the right from other animals. The mat is of reeds; the horse has its birthplace in the waters, the reed is born in the waters; verily he establishes it in its own birthplace. The Stoma is the fourfold one; the bee tore the thigh of the horse, the gods made it whole with the fourfold Stoma; in that there is the fourfold Stoma, (it is) to make whole the horse.</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagawatam (Bhagvad Purana) 4.19.11 “When Pṛthu Mahārāja was performing the last horse sacrifice [aśvamedha-yajña], King Indra, invisible to everyone, stole the horse intended for sacrifice. He did this because of his great envy of King Pṛthu.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Commentary: &#8220;King Indra is known as śata-kratu, which indicates that he has performed one hundred horse sacrifices (aśvamedha-yajña). We should know, however, that the animals sacrificed in the yajña were not killed. If the Vedic mantras were properly pronounced during the sacrifice, the animal sacrificed would come out again with a new life.&#8221; <strong>Swami Prabhupada on Srimad Bhagavatam 4.19.11</strong></p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana 11.2.5.1. And, verily, even on this occasion, they slaughter the sacrificial horse (Asvamedha) as a sacrifice to the gods…</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana 13:2:1:1-2 Pragâpati assigned the sacrifices to the gods; the Asvamedha he kept for himself. The gods said to him, &#8216;Surely, this–to wit, the Asvamedha–is a sacrifice: let us have a share in that also.&#8217; He contrived these Anna-homas (food-oblations) for them: thus when he performs the Annahomas, it is the gods he thereby gratifies. With ghee he makes offering, for ghee is fiery mettle: by means of fiery mettle he thus lays fiery mettle into him (the horse and Sacrificer). With ghee he offers; for that–to wit, ghee–is the gods&#8217; favourite resource: it is thus with their favourite resource he supplies them.</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana 11:2:5:5 Verily, then, for him who, knowing this, offers both the Agnihotra and the Full and New-moon sacrifices, they slaughter the sacrificial horse month by month; and month by month the Asvamedha is offered for him, and his Agnihotra and Full and New-moon sacrifices come to pass into the Asvamedha.</p>
<p>Valmiki Ramayan Bala Kanda 1, Sarga 14, Verses 33-38 “With great delight coming on her Queen Kausalya reverently made circumambulations to the horse, and symbolically killed the horse with three knives. Queen Kausalya desiring the results of ritual disconcertedly resided one night with that horse that flew away like a bird…Then the priest, one with controlled senses and rich in scriptural wealth, took up the omentum [fat] of the horse and cooked it as per scriptures while dropping into the altar of fire to bake as a food to the celestials…Those remaining body parts that horse are there, the sixteen officiating priests have procedurally oblated all of them into fire.” Tr. Desiraju Hanumanta Rao</p>
<p>Brahma Purana 104.137 &#8220;After performing these tasks Rama the most excellent among the virtuous performed ten horse-sacrifices where flesh was offered to the deities.&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Swami Vivekananda and Swami Dayanand Saraswati said that whatever from the Puranas (or other text also) contradicts the Vedas then it must be rejected without any mercy. And verses from Shatapatha Brahmana and Puranas confirms that the horse was slaughtered in Ashvamedha Yajna. So there is no way that apologists can now twist verses from Vedas about Horse-sacrifice.</p>

<h3><a id="post-6065-Cows-Guests"></a>Killing cows and offering its meat to guests</h3>
<p>Cattle were slaughtered for guests. But as per Swami Vivekananda this practise was later stopped. Sometimes we may wonder how an animal like cow became so sacred that Hindus started worshiping it and also prohibited its slaughter. When you ask any Hindu why he considers the Cow to be his Mother, he will tell you that &#8216;Since cow gives us milk, we consider it to be our mother&#8217;.</p>
<p>In the Vedas even the earth is considered a Mother. The reason for this may be because food grows from the soil. So Hindus considers all such things to be their mother whichever provides them with food. As we have already read some references about cattle used as source of money and ploughing the fields. It could be that people in ancient India heavily relied on Agriculture. Many farmers in India still plough fields with the help of Bulls and Cows. So killing cattle would result in heavy loss for such people, thus the prohibition of killing cows may have enacted. Swami Vivekananda writes,</p>
<p>&#8220;you read in the Vedas how, when a Sannyasin, a king, or a great man came into a house, the best bullock was killed. How in time it was found that as we were an agricultural race, killing the best bulls meant annihilation of the race. Therefore the practice was stopped, and a voice was raised against the killing of cows. Sometimes we find existing then what we now consider the most horrible customs.&#8221; <strong>The Complete Works of Swami Vivekandan, Volume 3</strong><br />

<p>Hindu scriptures commands to slaughter cattle or goat for the guests,</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti 51.64 When honoring a guest, at a sacrifice, or when worshipping the manes, or the gods, a man may slay cattle, but not otherwise on any account.</p>
<p>Sankhayana Grihya Sutra 2.15.1-3 Should any one of the six persons (mentioned in the Srauta-sutra and in the Sutras 4-9) to whom the Arghya reception is due, visit (him), let him make (ready) a cow, a goat, or what (sort of food) he thinks most like (thereto). Let the Argha not be without flesh. On the occasion of a sacrifice and of a wedding let (the guest) say, &#8216;Make it (ready).&#8217;</p>
<p>Kausitaki Brahmana 1.15 …Just as in the world when a human king has come, or another deserving person, they slay an ox or a cow that miscarries; so for him they slay in that they kindle the fire, for Agni is the victim of the gods.</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana 3:4:1:2. Now as to why it is called &#8216;guest-offering.&#8217; He, the purchased Soma, truly comes as his (the sacrificer&#8217;s) guest,–to him (is offered) that (hospitable reception): even as for a king or a Brâhman one would cook a large ox or a large he-goat–for that is human (fare offered to a guest), and the oblation is that of the gods–so he prepares for him that guest-offering.</p>
<p>Asvalayana Grihya Sutra 1.24.33 Let the Madhuparka not be without flesh, without flesh.</p>
<p>Madhuparka means offerings to the guest. Krishna tells Yuddhisthira,</p>
<p>Mahabharata Book 14, Section 2 “…And then Kesava (Krishna) accosted him,&#8211;&#8216;If a person indulges excessively in sorrow for his departed forefathers, he grieves them. (Therefore, banishing grief), do thou (now) celebrate many a sacrifice with suitable presents to the priests; and do thou gratify the gods with Soma liquor, and the manes of thy forefathers with their due food and drink. Do thou also gratify thy guests with meat and drink and the destitute with gifts commensurate with their desires…” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>On the occasion of Rukmini&#8217;s marriage with Krishna, Rukmi tells his father to slaughter a lakh cows, two lakh deers, 4 lakhs of rabbits and tortoise, ten lakhs of goats and 40 lakhs of sheep,</p>
<p>Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Krishna Janma Khanda 105. 47-67 &#8220;Get also slaughtered a lakh of cows, two lakhs of deer, 4 lakhs of rabbits and tortoise. Reverentially sacrifice to the village goddess on the night of the ful moon ten lakhs of goats and sheep four times the number of the last named and get the flesh properly cooked for food. O lord of the world, get also vegetables cooked for the purpose. The monarch Bhismaka having heard the words of his son took his family priest aside and also sent a suitable Brahmin to Dwarka. He fixed a date which was regarded auspicious unanimously&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Rajendra Nath Sen</p>
<p>Cow is also called Aghnya, Yaska in Nirukta has given two definitions for this word, one is that cow is not to be killed and another one is that cow is called Aghnya because it is a destroyer of sins. Cow is destroyer of sin because sacrificing it emancipates ones sins,</p>
<p>Grihya Sutra of Hiranyakesin I Prasna, 4 Patala, 14 Section, verses 11-16 &#8220;That (cow is either killed or let loose. If he chooses to let it loose, (he murmurs), &#8216;This cow will become a milch cow&#8217;&#8230;If it shall be killed, (he says), &#8216;A cow art thou; sin is driven away from thee. Drive away my sin and the sin of N.N.! Kill ye him whoever hates me. He is killed whosoever hates me. Make (the cow) ready!&#8217; If (the cow) is let loose, a meal is prepared with other meat, and he announces it (to the guest) in the words, &#8216;It is ready!&#8217; He replies, &#8216;It is well prepared; it is Virag; it is food. May it not fail! May I obtain it&#8230;Give food to the Brahmanas!&#8217; After those (Brahmanas) have eaten, (the hose) orders blameless (?) food to be brought to him (i.e. to the guest).</p>
<p>Scholars have opined that milch cows were not slaughtered and only barren cows were slaughtered as slaughtering milch cows would result in heavy loss.</p>

<h3><a id="post-6065-Meat-Consumption"></a>Meat consumption in other Hindu scriptures</h3>
<p>Hindu text even permits the meat of cow,</p>
<p>Apastamba Dharma Shastra Prasna I, Patala 5, Khanda 17, 30-31 (But the meat) of milch-cows and oxen may be eaten. The Vâgasaneyaka declares &#8216;bull&#8217;s flesh is fit for offerings.&#8217; 37. Five-toed animals (ought not to be eaten) with the exception of the iguana, the tortoise, the porcupine, the hedgehog, the rhinoceros, the hare, and the Pûtikhasha.</p>
<p>Vasistha Dharma Shastra 14.46. It is declared in the Vâgasaneyaka, that (the flesh of) milch-cows and oxen is fit for offerings.</p>
<p>Hinduism also permits meat of the following animals, birds and fishes,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 5.18 The porcupine, the hedgehog, the iguana, the rhinoceros, the tortoise, and the hare they declare to be eatable; likewise those (domestic animals) that have teeth in one jaw only, excepting camels.</p>
<p>Padma Purana III.56.31b-46 &#8220;&#8230;O best ones, Prajapati Manu has said that these animals with five claws may be always eaten: alligator, tortoise, hare, rhinoceros, porcupine. He may also eat fish with scales, and the flesh of (the deer called) ruru after having presented them to deities and brahmanas, and not otherwise. O best brahmanas, so also (the flesh of) a peacock, a patridge, a pigeon, a cataka, rhinoceros, a crane, a swan. Thus said Prajapati (Manu). These fish, viz. (the glittering fish) saphari, simhatunda, pathina and rohita are directed as fit to be eaten. With a desire (to retain the status) as a twice-born he should eat the flesh of these after it is sprinkled over; even if he is about to loose his life he should duly use it. He should not at all eat flesh. He who eats what remains, is not smeared (with sin). If he is weak, he should eat flesh as medicine, or by an order or for sacrificial purposes. He, who would give up flesh when invited at a sraddha or a rite in honour of a deity, goes to (i.e. lives) in hell for as many years as the number of hair of the beast&#8230;&#8221; Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p>Agni Purana 168.12-23 &#8220;&#8230;Animals having five nails such as the Shallaki, the Godha, the rhinoceros, and the tortoise are clean animals; and accordingly their flesh may be taken without any impunity. Flesh of animals other than the five mentioned in the preceding line, should be deemed impure. There is no harm in eating such fishes as Pathin, Rohita, and Sinhatunda&#8230;&#8221; Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Yajnavalkya Smriti verse 177-8 Of the five toed animals, the porcupine the iguana-lizard, the tortoise, the hedge-hog; and the hare; among fishes the Simhatundaka and the Rohita. So also the pathina, the Rajiva, the sasalka may be eaten by the twice born classes.</p>
<p>Brahma Purana 113.111-2 &#8220;The following can be eaten: hare, tortoise, alligator, porcupine and the fish with darts (?) The village boar and the cock should be avoided. In the following circumstances, even if one eats meat, one is not defiled: if it is the remnant of offerings unto the Pitrs, Devas etc. or if it is cooked in Sraddha at the request of the brahmins and is sprinkled with the holy water or if it is taken as a medicine.&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Vamana Purana 15.2-3 &#8220;Rice cooked well with oil or ghee, even if it be stored for a long time is fit to be eaten. Rice without any oil or ghee, and delicate preparations of milk, meat of the rabbit, porcupine, alligator, hedgehog, fish and tortoise, pulses and similar other things are fit to be eaten, said Manu.&#8221; Tr. Ananda Swarup Gupta</p>
<p>Paraskara Grihya Sutra III Kanda, 10 Kandika, 48 On the eleventh day he should give to an uneven number of Brahmanas a meal at which meat is served.</p>
<p>Sankha Samhita 13.25 &#8220;A Sraddha ceremony performed by offering oblations of Vala Sakas, bird&#8217;s flesh, the flesh of a rhinoceros, or a large-scaled fish, bears infinite fruit. This is the opinion of Yama, the law-giver.&#8221; Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Sankha Samhita 17.22 &#8220;Golden coloured godhas, tortoises, porcupines, hares, although they belong to the group of five nailed creatures, are animals whose flesh may be eaten; but having killed of any of these animals, one should practise the above-said penance.&#8221; Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Sankha Samhita 17.27 &#8220;Pheasants, peacocks, Lavaakas, Kapinjaras, Vartakas, and Bardhrinasas are birds, whose flesh, according to holy Yama, may be always eaten.&#8221; Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Usana Samhita 3.107 &#8220;This Sraddha is called Pindanvaharyakam. In the afternoon of the day, when the waning of the Moon takes place, the twice-born should perform it with sanctified fish and meat.&#8221; Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Manu Smriti clearly allow consumption of meat,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 5.29  What is destitute of motion is the food of those endowed with locomotion; (animals)  without fangs (are the food) of those with fangs, those without hands of those who possess hands, and the timid of the bold.</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 5.30 The eater who daily even devours those destined to be his food, commits no sin; for the creator himself created both the eaters and those who are to be eaten (for those special purposes).</p>
<p>Above Manu Smriti verse might sound contradicting to other verse of Manu which says,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 5.41 On offering the honey-mixture (to a guest), at a sacrifice and at the rites in honour of the manes, but on these occasions <strong>only</strong>, may an animal be slain; that (rule) Manu proclaimed.</p>
<p>What some Hindu apologists do is they quote these two verse and says &#8220;See these two verses are contradicting each other, one says we can slaughter animals only on occasions but other says we can slaughter animals daily so this proves Manu Smriti is interpolated&#8221; It&#8217;s so easy to say fake translation and Manu Smriti is corrupted to escape the argument, But the next verse explains it,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 5.32 He who eats meat, <strong>when he honours the gods and manes</strong>, commits no sin, whether he has bought it, or himself has killed (the animal), or has received it as a present from others.</p>
<p>So the condition to eat the meat is, he should honor the god, if he doesn&#8217;t then it&#8217;s a minor offense.</p>
<p>Internet Arya Samajis considers Manu Smriti to be unauthentic. Manu Smriti is the second most authentic scripture of Arya Samaj, Vedas are the most sacred Sruti and the Manu Smriti is the most authentic Smriti, Swami Dayanand Saraswati the founder of Arya Samaj writes in his book,</p>
<p>Q. ~ Well sir! Have you no faith even in what the Parashar says:<br />
A. ~ …. <strong>Among the Smrities, the Manu Smriti alone is authentic.- Satyarth Prakash</strong> pg 142, Tr. Chiranjiva Bhardwaja</p>
<p>Dayanand recommended reading Manu Smriti to understand several things, Moreover he used approximately 250 verses of Manu Smriti in his book Satyarth Prakash, If Manu Smriti is so corrupted (corrupted according to some keyboard warriors) then why did Dayanand used 250 Shlokas of Manu Smriti in his book Satyarth Prakash? This proves Manu Smriti is the most authentic Smriti of Arya Samaj no matter today if some keyboard warriors reject it. In a debate between Dayanand and an Orthodox Hindu named Tara Charan, Dayanand accepted that Manu Smriti and few other texts are authoritative and they are based on the Vedas</p>
<p>Some Hindu apologists try to show there is no violence in Yajnas therefore killing animals during Yajna is prohibited, let me give an example to refute this point. Drinking alcohol is illegal in Saudi Arabia, if you trade or drink alcohol there you will be imprisoned, but in India drinking or trade of alcohol is legal and you won&#8217;t be imprisoned for it similarly killing animals in Yajnas is permissible and is a non-violent act.</p>

<h3><a id="post-6065-Gods-Manes"></a>Honoring Gods and Manes is the condition to eat meat</h3>
<p>Yajnavalkya Smriti verse 179 One may eat meat without incurring any guilt when one&#8217;s life is in danger, (when engaged) in Sraddha, when it has been springkled with water while Mantras were recited, when Brahmanas desire one&#8217;s doing it, or when it has been properly offered to Gods and the pitris.</p>
<p>Yajnavalkya Smriti Chapter 1, verse 171 &#8220;[One should avoid] havi (clarified butter) made for the worship of a deity, [before the adoration is finished,] the juice of a pot-herb, that of a red-coloured tree, that of trees born of cuttings, meat of animals not offered in sacrifices&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Vijnanesvara writes on this verse,</p>
<p>&#8220;Unhallowed meat, The flesh of animals not offered at the sacrifice.&#8221; Tr. Srisa Chandra Vasu</p>
<p>Vyasa Samhita 3.558 &#8220;A twice-born one, by eating the cooked flesh of an animal wantonly slaughtered (not killed in any sacrifice), suffers the pangs of hell for eternal time, or as long as the sun and stars would shine in heaven&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Usana Samhita 9.22 &#8220;[There is] no [penance for taking] the meat [of animals] sacrificed unto a deity; [for taking any other meat, one] should perform the Chandrayana. Or, fasting for twelve days, he should offer oblations of clarified butter to the Fire with the Kushmanda [Mantram].&#8221; Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti 51.59 &#8220;Under no circumstance shall eat the flesh of an animal, not consecrated with Mantras, but he will eat, in conformity with the injunctions of the eternal scriptures, the flesh of an animal consecrated with Mantras and duly offered on the occasion of a sacrifice.&#8221; Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 5.32 He who eats meat, <strong>when he honours the gods and manes</strong>, commits no sin, whether he has bought it, or himself has killed (the animal), or has received it as a present from others.</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti 51.20-21 Or (food that is given) in a disrespectful manner, or the meat (of animals killed) for no sacred purpose. After having (unawares) eaten the flesh of any sort of fish, excepting the Pathina, Rohita, Ragiva, Simhatunda, and Sakula fishes, he must fast for three days.</p>
<p>Kurma Purana II.24.3 &#8220;A Brahmana maintaining sacred fires and desirous of living for a long time should not eat cooked food or meat without performing the Yajna of fresh harvest and the animal sacrifice.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Garuda Purana I.96.72 &#8220;By eating garlic and onion one becomes sinful and as atonement one should perform Candrayana. If one takes meat after worshipping deities and manes in Sraddha one does not acquire sin.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Garuda Purana I.96.60-64 &#8220;&#8230;Meat should not be taken without consecration&#8230;&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Mahabharata Book 3, Section 207 “…this rule has been laid down by Munis:–Whoever partakes of animal food after having first offered it duly and respectfully to the gods and the manes, is not polluted by the act. And such a man is not at all considered to have partaken of animal food…” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Mahabharata Book 12, Section 37 “…Rice boiled in sugared milk, food mixed with the tila seed, meat, and cakes, that have not been dedicated to the gods, should not be taken by Brahmanas leading a domestic mode of life, Having first gratified the gods, Rishis, guests, Pitris, and the household deities, a Brahmana leading a domestic mode of life should then take his food…” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>It is considered sinful to eat meat without honouring gods and manes,</p>
<p>Vamana Purana 12.20 &#8220;Those men who have consumed rice boiled in milk, rice cooked with sesamum, and meat, without offering them to the deity have thrust into their mouth awfully hot iron balls.&#8221; Tr. Ananda Swarup Gupta</p>
<p>Devi Bhagavagam 9.33.62-85. &#8220;If any Brâhmin villain eats, out of greed, any flesh (not sacrificed before the goddess) or anything not offered to Hari, he will have to remain in the Krimi Kunda where he eats those things for as many years as there are hairs on his body&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Gautama Samhita 17.31. Nor the flesh of animals whose milk-teeth have not fallen out, which are diseased, nor the meat of those (which have been killed) for no (sacred) purpose,</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 206.15 &#8220;Then the following formulae should be recited:_ &#8216;Whatever sins I may have committed through insinuations, backbiting, or eating flesh not offered to the gods, be destroyed by the giving away of this copper vessel.&#8217; Then the vessel is to be given over.&#8221; Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>Kurma Purana 2.17.34b-39 &#8220;Manu the Prajapati has said that these five clawed animals may be eaten viz. Godha (alligator), Kurma (tortoise), Sasa (hare), Svavit and Sallaki (the small and the big porcupione). O excellent men, one may eat those fish with thorny scales (?) and the flesh of the deer Ruru. They can be eaten after offering them to the deities and the Brahmanas and not otherwise. The Prajapati has said that the peacock, the francoline patridge, the Kapinjala (a variety of the ruddy goose), the rhenocero and the panther can be eaten. O leading sages, among fishes, these are mentioned as worthy of being eaten, viz: the Rajivas (lotus-like ones) the Simhatundas (lion-snouted), the Pathinas and the Rohitas. The flesh of these must be sprinkled with holy water and consecrated before eating if the Brahmanas so desires. One shall eat meat in accordance with the injunctions or as enjoined at a time when life is in danger. One who eats the remainder (i.e. what is left after worship) or as a medicine or when one is powerless or is deputed, he is not affected by sin.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p><strong>Division of parts of sacrificial animal</strong></p>
<p>Aitareya Brahmana Book 7, Chapter 1, Para 1 “Now follows the division of the different parts of the sacrificial animal (among the priests). We shall describe it. The two jawbones with the tongue are to be given to the Prastotar; the breast in the form of an eagle to the Udgatar; the throat with the palate to the Pratihartar; the lower part of the right loins to the Hotar; the left to the Braham; the right thigh to the Maitravaruna; the left to the Brahmanacchamsi; the right side with the shoulder to the Adhvaryu; the left side to those who accompany the chants; the left shoulder to the Pratipasthatar; the lower part of the right arm to the Neshtar; the lower part of the left arm to the Potar&#8230;the other half of the fleshy part on the neck and the left lobe (kloma) to the slaughterer&#8230;Those who divide the sacrificial animal in the way mentioned, it becomes the guide to heaven. But those who make the division otherwise are like scoundrels and miscreants who kill an animal merely (for gratifying their lust after flesh. This division of the sacrificial animal was invented by the Rishi Devabhaga, a son of Sruta. When he was departing from this life, he did not entrust (the secret to any one). But a supernatural being communicated it to Girija, the son of Babhru. Since his time men study it.&#8221; Tr. Martin Haug</p>

<h3><a id="post-6065-Shraddha-Pitrs"></a>Animal slaughter at Shraddha for Pitrs (ancestors)</h3>
<p>Mahabharata book 13 section 88 Manu has said that if a Sraddha is performed with a copious measure of sesame, such Sraddha becomes inexhaustible. Of all kinds of food, sesame seeds are regarded as the best. With fishes offered at Sraddhas, the Pitris remain gratified for a period of two months. With mutton they remain gratified for three months and with the flesh of the hare for four. With the flesh of the goat, O king, they remain gratified for five months, with bacon for six months, and with the flesh of birds for seven. With venison obtained from those deer that are called Prishata, they remain gratified for eight months, and with that obtained from the Ruru for nine months, and with the meat of the Gavaya for ten months. With the meat of the buffalo their gratification lasts for eleven months. With beef presented at the Sraddha, their gratification, it is said, lasts for a full year. Payasa mixed with ghee is as much acceptable to the Pitris as beef. With the meat of the Vadhrinasa the gratification of the Pitris lasts for twelve years. The flesh of the rhinoceros, offered to the Pitris on the anniversaries of the lunar days on which they died, becomes inexhaustible. The potherb called Kalasaka, the petals of the Kanchana flower, and meat of the goat also, thus offered, prove inexhaustible.</p>
<p>Apastamba Dharma Shastra, Prasna II, Patala 7, Khanda 16.3-4 At that (rite) the Manes (of one&#8217;s father, grandfather, and great-grand father) are the deities (to whom the sacrifice is offered). But the Brâhmanas, (who are fed,) represent the Âhavanîya-fire. That rite must be performed in each month [26] Beef satisfies (the Manes) for a year.</p>
<p>Apastamba Dharma Shastra, Prasna II, Patala 7, Khanda 17.1-3 (If) rhinoceros&#8217; meat (is given to Brahmanas seated) on (seats covered with) the skin of a rhinoceros, (the Manes are satisfied) for a very long time. (The same effect is obtained) by (offering the) flesh (of the fish called) Satabali, And by (offering the) meat of the (crane called)</p>
<p>Gautama Dharma Shastra 15.15. The Manes are satisfied for a month by gifts of sesamum, Masha-beans, rice, barley, and water, For (three) years by fish and the flesh of common deer, spotted deer, hares, turtles, <strong>boars</strong>, and sheep,For twelve years by cow&#8217;s milk and messes made of milk, For a very long time by the flesh of (the crane called) Vardhrinasa, by Ocyrnurn sanctum (sacred Basil), and by the flesh of goats, (especially) of a red (he-goat), and of a rhinoceros, (if these dishes are) mixed with honey.</p>
<p>Maharishi Manu writes,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 3.266-72 I will now fully declare what kind of sacrificial food, given to the manes according to the rule, will serve for a long time or for eternity. The ancestors of men are satisfied for one month with sesamum grains, rice, barley, masha beans, water, roots, and fruits, which have been given according to the prescribed rule, Two months with fish, three months with the meat of gazelles, four with mutton, and five indeed with the flesh of birds, Six months with the flesh of kids, seven with that of spotted deer, eight with that of the black antelope, but nine with that of the (deer called) Ruru, Ten months they are satisfied with the meat of boars and buffaloes, but eleven months indeed with that of hares and tortoises, One year with cow-milk and milk-rice; from the flesh of a long-eared white he-goat their satisfaction endures twelve years. The (vegetable called) Kalasaka, (the fish called) Mahasalka, the flesh of a rhinoceros and that of a red goat, and all kinds of food eaten by hermits in the forest serve for an endless time.</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 2.16.1-3 “AURVA continued.–&#8221;Ancestors are satisfied for a month with offerings of rice or other grain, with clarified butter, with fish, or the flesh of the hare, of birds, of the hog, the goat, the antelope, the deer, the gayal, or the sheep, or with the milk of the cow, and its products. They are for ever satisfied with flesh (in general), and with that of the long-eared white goat in particular. The flesh of the rhinoceros, the Kálaśáka potherb, and honey, are also especial sources of satisfaction to those worshipped at ancestral ceremonies.” Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Yajnavalkya Smriti verse 258-59 (The Pitris are satisfied) verily for a moth with the havisya (sacrificial food), but for a year with the milk rice, with the fish, with the meat of gazelles, with mutton, with the flesh of birds, with the flesh of kids, with flesh of spotted deer. With the flesh of black antelope, with that of Ruru deer, with the meat of boars, and with the meat of hares respectively for a period progessively increasing by a month are satisfied when offered to the Grandfathers here.</p>
<p>Markandeya Purana 32.2-5; Matsya Purana 17-31-36 The Pitris are satisfied with clarified butter and rice for a month. The paternal grandfathers receive satisfaction with fish meat for two months. Venison should be known to satisfy the pitris for three months; and the flesh of hares nourishes the pitris for four months; bird&#8217;s flesh satisfies them for five months; hog&#8217;s flesh for six months; goat&#8217;s flesh for seven months; and flesh of the black antelope for eight months; flesh of the ruru deer gives them satisfication for nine months, without doubt; flesh of gayal gives satisfaction for ten months.</p>
<p>Same is repeated in in Kurma Purana II.20.37-54 which also talks about giving meat to Brahmins as food. Narada Purana Uttarabhaga 44.51; Vayu Purana 21-2-9; Agni Purana 117.44-48; Padma Purana 1.9.153-157; Agni Purana 163.28-39; Brahma Purana 111.15-33; Brahmanda Purana 2.3.19.2-10 similar thing is also said in Garuda Purana I.99.37- 38; Matsya Purana 15.34-35; Matsya Purana 204.6-9; Narada Purana II.51.142b-145a; Padma Purana 1.9.62-63 including the following verses,</p>
<p>Markandeya Purana 35.2-4 &#8220;&#8230;The hare, the tortoise, the gosamp, the porcupine, and the rhinoceros, my son, these indeed may be eaten; and domestic pig and fowl should be eschewed. The remains of food at a sraddha after the pitris and gods and other recipients have been satisfied may be eaten at the desire of the brahmanas. A man who eats flesh that has been killed for the purpose of medicine is not defiled.&#8221;</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti 30.34 Now he who studies the hymns of the Rig-veda (regularly), feeds the manes with clarified butter. 37 He who studies the Atharva-veda, (feeds them) with meat.</p>
<p>Markandeya Purana 32.31-34 &#8220;At this ceremony also songs in honour of the pitris are sung by those who recite the Veda, songs which were formerly sung by the pitris to king Puruavas. &#8220;When will any one of use have a son, the chief among his race, who, eating the remains food left by yogis, will offer the pinda on earth? Or will offer pinda, buffalo-beef, the clarified butter, or the vegetable kala mixed with sesamum-seed, or khichree at Gaya for our monthly satisfaction? May we obtain the offering to the Visvadevas and the soma juice, buffalo-beef, and the finest clarified butter, and the divine food by getting a young rhinoceros!&#8221;</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti 80.1-14 Sesamum, rice, barley, beans, water, roots, fruits, vegetables, Syâmâka grain, millet, wild rice, kidney-beans, and wheat satisfy (the manes) for a month; The flesh of fishes (excepting those species that are forbidden), for two months; The flesh of the common deer, for three months; The flesh of sheep, for four months; The flesh of birds (of those kinds that may be eaten), for five months; The flesh of goats, for six months; The flesh of the spotted deer, for seven months; The flesh of the spotted antelope, for eight months; Beef, for nine months; Buffalo&#8217;s meat, for ten months; The meat of a hornless goat, for eleven months; The milk of a cow, or preparations from it, for a year. On this subject there exists a stanza, which the manes utter: &#8216;(The pot-herb) Kâlasâka (sacred basil), (the prawn) Mahâsalka, and the flesh of the (crane called) Vârdhrînasa[1], (and of) a rhinoceros having no horn, is food which we always accept.&#8217;</p>
<p>Agni Purana 117.44-48 &#8220;Now I shall discuss the nature of satisfaction which the different sorts of cakes or oblations respectively impart to the souls of one&#8217;s ancestors. Oblations composed of cereals grown in villages as well as forest fruits, bulbs and roots last one&#8217;s forefathers for a month, while those consisting of fishes and venison would serve them well for double or triple that division of time. The peculiar kind of venison known as the Rouravas would gratify them for five months, whereas games and wild fowls would last them for four months. The departed soul are supposed to live satisfactorily upon goat&#8217;s meat for six months, meat of tortoise, pork, mutton, and buffalo flesh lasting them for seven, eight, nine and ten months respectively. Sweetened porridge and butter of cow milk offered in a clarified state would gratify them for a whole year, while the meat of a full grown sacrificial goat (Vardrinasa) as well as the sword of a rhinoceros, flesh of an antelope or that of a red goat and honey should be considered as their full and proper ration for a period of three consecutive&#8217; months. Offerings made during the rainy season consist of fishes having large scales, while a Shraddha ceremony performed on the day on which the moon enters the asterisk Magha should be supposed as hearing immortal fruits.&#8221; Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Usana Samhita 3.137-141 &#8220;one should, with care, give at a Sraddha, deer, lamb and tortoise. With fish and meat, [the Manes attain to gratification for] two months; and [for] three months, with the meat of deer. With mutton, [they are gratified for] four months; with the meat of birds, [for] five months; with the meat of goat, [for] six months; and with the meat of Ruru deer, [for] nine months. With the meat of buffalo and pork, [they] are gratified for ten months; and with the meat of hare and tortoise, for eleven months. With cow&#8217;s milk and Payasa (milk and boiled-rice), [they attain to gratification for] one year. With the meat of rhinoceros, [they attain to] gratification for twelve years. Black pot herbs, sea-scrabs, meat of rhinoceros and black goat, honey and all other roots leads to their everlasting gratification.&#8221; Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Grihya Sutra of Hiranyakesin II Prasna, 5 Patala, 15 section, 1-9 On the following day he sacrifices a cow to the Fathers&#8230;When it has been sprinkled and fire has been carried round it, they kill it to the west of the fire, its head being turned to the west, its feet to the south. After it has been killed, he silently &#8216;strengthens&#8217; its sense-organs (by touching them) with water, and silently takes out the omentum, the heart, and the kidneys.…He sacrifices the omentum entirely. The other parts (Sutra 5) he should offer to the Brahmanas and should feed them (with those parts of the cow). When the food (for the Brahmanas) is ready, he cuts off (the Avadanas) together from the mess of boiled rice, and form the pieces of meat, and mixing them with clarified butter he makes oblations thereof with the verses, &#8216;Behold the Ekashtaka, the giver of food with meat and ghee, (which is offered) with (the word) svadha. By the Brahmanas that food is purified. May it be an imperishable (blessings to me! Svadha! Adoration!&#8217;</p>
<p>Grihya Sutra of Apastamba Patala 8, Section 22, 3-5 &#8220;On the following day he touches a cow with a Darbha blade, with the words, &#8216;I touch thee agreeable to the Fathers.&#8217; having silently offered five Agya oblations, and having cooked the omentum of the (cow), and performed the &#8216;spreading under&#8217; and the sprinkling over (of Agya), he sacrifices (the omentun) with the next (verse, II, 20, 28) with a Palasa leaf from the middle or the end (of the stalk). (He sacrifices) boiled rice together with the meat (of the cow) with the next (verses, II, 20, 29-35)</p>
<p>Asvalayana Grihya Sutra, 1 Adhyaya, 11 Kandika, 1-10 &#8220;Now (follows) the ritual of the animal sacrifice&#8230;To the west of the Samitra (fire) he (the Samitri) kills (the animal), the head of which is turned to the east or to the west, the feet to the north; and having placed a grass-blade on his side of the (animal&#8217;s) navel, (the &#8216;performer&#8217;) draws out the omentum, cuts off the omentum, seizes it with the two Agnisrapanis, sprinkles it with water, warms it at the Samitra (fire), takes it before that fire, roasts it, being seated to the south, goes round (the two fires), and sacrifices it.</p>
<p>Instructions on animal sacrifice is also mentioned in Asvalayana Grihya Sutra, II Adhyaya, 4 Kandika, 13; Asvalayana Grihya Sutra, IV Adhyaya, 8 Kandika, 16-18</p>
<p>Gutama Dharma Shastra 17.37-38 And (animals) that must be slain for (the fulfilment of) the sacred law. Let him eat (the flesh of animals) killed by beasts of prey, after having washed it, if no blemish is visible, and if it is declared to be fit for use by the word (of a Brahmana). I.e animals offered at Sraddhas and Srauta-sacrifices, though under other circumstances forbidden, may be eaten both by the priests and other Brahmanas.</p>
<p>Padma Purana 1.33.80 &#8220;O you of a good vow, satisfy the brahmanas with musk, and flesh and various kinds of grains, and by offering a Sraddha.&#8221; Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p>All these animals sacrificed to gods and manes is supposed to be eaten by the Brahmin priest. Some Aryas may cry that this has nothing to do with Hinduism, these are interpolated texts. But for their kind information, interpolation can occur only in one text, the same interpolation cannot happen in several texts like Manu Smriti, Yajnvalkya Smriti, Mahabharata, Vishnu, Markandeya, Matsya Puranas, Dharma Shastras and so on. The fact that this Shraddha for Pitrs occurs in so many Smritis and Puranas proves that Sages who wrote these books agreed with it, so do Hindus mean to say they know more about Hinduism than their sages?</p>

<h3><a id="post-6065-Rejecting-Meat"></a>Rejecting meat offered at Vedic sacrifice and ritual is sinful</h3>
<p>Hindu texts even say that one who refuses to eat meat offered to gods and manes at Shraddha is punished after death,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 5.35 But a man who, being duly engaged (to officiate or to dine at a sacred rite), refuses to eat meat, becomes after death an animal during twenty-one existences.</p>
<p>Vasistha Dharma Shastra 11.34 &#8216;But an ascetic who, invited to dine at a sacrifice of the manes or of the gods, rejects meat, shall go to hell for as many years as the slaughtered beast has hairs.&#8217;</p>
<p>Kurma Purana 2.17.40 &#8220;If a person invited for the Sraddha or the worship of a deity eschews meat he may have to be in the hell as many years as there are hairs on the body of the animal.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Kurma Purana II.22.74-75 &#8220;An excellent Brahmana engaged in the Sraddha should not avoid anything served. He should not refuse even the meat offered.

<h3><a id="post-6065-Animals-Sacrifice"></a>Animals are created for sacrifice</h3>
<p>Manu Smriti 5.31-42 The consumption of meat (is befitting) for  sacrifices,&#8217; that is declared to be a rule made by the gods; but to persist (in using it) on other (occasions) is said to be a proceeding worthy of Rakshasas. He who eats meat, when he honours the gods and manes, commits no sin, whether he has bought it, or himself has killed (the animal), or has received it as a present from others…After death the guilt of one who slays deer for gain is not as (great) as that of him who eats meat for no (sacred) purpose. But a man who, being duly engaged (to officiate or to dine at a sacred rite), refuses to eat meat, becomes after death an animal during twenty-one existences…If he has a strong desire (for meat) he may make an animal of clarified butter or one of flour, (and eat that); but let him never seek to destroy an animal without a (lawful) reason. As many hairs as the slain beast has, so often indeed will he who killed it without a (lawful) reason suffer a violent death in future births. Svayambhu (the Self-existent) himself created animals for the sake of sacrifices; sacrifices (have been instituted) for the good of this whole (world); hence the slaughtering (of beasts) for sacrifices is not slaughtering (in the ordinary sense of the word)&#8230;On offering the honey-mixture (to a guest), at a sacrifice and at the rites in honour of the manes, but on these occasions only, may an animal be slain; that (rule) Manu proclaimed. A twice-born man who, knowing the true meaning of the Veda, slays an animal for these purposes, causes both himself and the animal to enter a most blessed state.</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti 51.61 It is for sacrifices that beasts have been created by the self-existent (Brahman) himself. Sacrificing causes the whole universe to prosper; therefore is the slaughter (of beasts) for a sacrifice no slaughter.</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti 51.65 That twice-born man who, knowing the exact truth (promulgated) in the Veda, slays cattle for the sacrifices (ordained in the Veda) will convey himself and the cattle (slain by him) to a blissful abode.</p>
<p>Chandogya Upanishad 8.15.1  …never giving pain to any creature, except at the tirthas  (sacrifices, &amp;c.), he who behaves thus all his life, reaches the world of Brahman, and does not return, yea, he does not return..</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam (Bhagvad Purana) 11.5.11 “In this material world the conditioned soul is always inclined to sex, meat-eating and intoxication. Therefore religious scriptures never actually encourage such activities. Although the scriptural injunctions provide for sex through sacred marriage, for meat-eating through sacrificial offerings and for intoxication through the acceptance of ritual cups of wine, such ceremonies are meant for the ultimate purpose of renunciation.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Mahabharata Book 3, Section 207 “And in days of yore, O Brahmana, two thousand animals used to be killed every day in the kitchen of king Rantideva…&#8217;The sacred fire is fond of animal food,&#8217; this saying has come down to us. And at sacrifices animals are invariably killed by regenerate Brahmanas, and these animals being purged of sin, by incantation of hymns, go to heaven. If, O Brahmana, the sacred fire had not been so fond of animal food in ancient times, it could never have become the food of any one. And in this matter of animal food, this rule has been laid down by Munis:–Whoever partakes of animal food after having first offered it duly and respectfully to the gods and the manes, is not polluted by the act. And such a man is not at all considered to have partaken of animal food…” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.163.12-13 “The strong Steed hath come forward to the slaughter, pondering with a mind directed God-ward. The goat who is his kin is led before him the sages and the singers follow after. The Steed is come unto the noblest mansion, is come unto his Father and his Mother. This day shall he approach the Gods, most welcome: then he declares good gifts to him who offers.” Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>Above verses from Mahabharata and Veda says that animals killed in Vedic sacrifice goes to heaven, on this statement I would like to mention the argument of Jains and Buddhists against this,</p>
<p>&#8220;If an animal slaughtered in religious worship is thereby raised to heaven, would it not be expedient for a man who institutes a sacrifice to kill his own father for a victim?&#8221;</p>

<h3><a id="post-6065-Killing-nonviolent"></a>Killing animal is non-violent</h3>
<p>Vedic verses clearly tells us that killing animal is part of Yajna (sacrifice). Maharshi Manu also writes that slaughtering animals for sacrifices is non-violent,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 5.44 Know that the injury to moving creatures and to those destitute of motion, which the Veda has prescribed for certain occasions, is no injury at all; for the sacred law shone forth from the Veda.</p>
<p>Whether animals should be killed in Yajna (Sacrifices) or not is explained in detail in the Devi Bhagawatam,</p>
<p>Devi Bhagwatam 1.18.48-61 &#8220;…O King! One can see before one&#8217;s eyes that the drinking of Soma rasa, the killing of animals, the eating of fish and flesh and so are advised in the Vedas; so much so that in the sacrificial ceremony named Sautrâmana the rule of drinking wine and many other vratas are clearly mentioned; even gambling is advised in the Vedas. So how can Mukti be obtained by following the Veda Dharma? It is heard that, in ancient times, there was a great king, named S&#8217;as&#8217;avindu, very religious, truthful, and performing sacrifices, very liberal; he protected the virtuous, and chastised those that were wicked and going astray. He performed many Yajñas, where many cows and sheep were sacrificed according to the rules of the Vedas and abundant Dakshinâs (sacrificial fees) were presented to every one that performed their parts in the sacrifices. In these sacrifices, the hides of the cows that were sacrificed as victims, were heaped to such an enormous extent that they looked liked a second Bindhyâchal mountain. Then the rains fell and the dirty water coming out of that enormous heap of skins flowed down and gave rise to a river which was thence called the Charmanvatî river… Janaka said :– &#8220;The killing of animals in a sacrificial ceremony is not killing; it is known as Ahimsa [Non Violence]; for that himsa [Violence] is not from any selfish attachment; therefore when there is no such sacrifice and the animals are killed out of selfish attachment, then that is real himsâ; … O Dvija! Really speaking, the killing of animals done by the house-holder attached to senses and their objects, and done under their impulses can be taken into account as a real act of killing; but, O Mahâbhâga of those whose hearts are not attached to anything of those self controlled persons, desirous of moksa, if they do an act of Himsa out of a sense of duty, with no desires of fruits and with their hearts free from egoism that can never be reckoned as a real act of killing.&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 3.26.32-34 &#8220;Those who eat meat, they can sacrifice animals in this worship of the Devî; and, for this purpose, goat and wild boars are the best. O sinless one! The goats, etc., offered as a sacrifice before the Devî attain to unending heavens. Therefore persons offering the sacrifices of goats do not incur any sin. O king! The goats, etc., and other beast offered as a sacrifice before the Devas undoubtedly go to the heavenly regions; therefore, in all the S&#8217;âstras, it has been decided that this killing of animals in a sacrifice is considered as non-killing.&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti 51.67 That slaughter which is in accordance with the precepts of the Veda, and has been fixed for this world of movable and immovable creatures, should be considered as no slaughter at all; because it is from the Veda that law shines forth.</p>
<p>Kalki Purana 26.12 &#8220;&#8230;The Vedas therefore say that killing in a righteous battle or in a sacrificial performace does not constitute killing.&#8221; Tr. Bhumipati Das, edited by Purnaprajna Das</p>
<p>Following verse from Vasistha explains Manu Smriti 5.48 which is used by Hindu apologists to prohibit meat consumption in Manu,</p>
<p>Vasistha Dharma Shastra 4.5-8 The Manava (Sutra states), &#8216;Only when he worships the manes and the gods, or honours guests, he may certainly do injury to animals.&#8217; On offering a Madhuparka (to a guest), at a sacrifice, and at the rites in honour of the manes, but on these occasions only may an animal be slain; that (rule) Manu proclaimed.&#8221;Meat can never be obtained without injuring living beings, and to injure living beings does not procure heavenly bliss; therefore the (sages declare) the slaughter (of beasts) at a sacrifice not to be slaughter (in the ordinary sense of the word).&#8217; &#8216;Now he may also cook a full-grown ox or a full-grown he-goat for a Brâhmana or Kshatriya guest; in this manner they offer hospitality to such (a man).</p>

<h3><a id="post-6065-Examples"></a>Examples of meat consumption</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Krishna</strong></p>
<p>Krishna recommended slaughtering animals for worshipping Govardhan Mountain and also ate the flesh of animals that was offered by the people,</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 5.10.36-49 “Let prayer and offerings then be addressed to the mountain Govarddhana, and kill a victim in due form. Let the whole station collect their milk without delay, and feed with it the Brahmans and all who may desire to partake of it. When the oblations have been presented, and the Brahmans have been fed, let the Gopas circumambulate the cows, decorated with garlands of autumnal flowers. If the cowherds will attend to these suggestions, they will secure the favour of the mountain, of the cattle, and also mine.&#8221; When Nanda and the other Gopas heard these words of Krishńa, their faces expanded with delight, and they said that he had spoken well. &#8220;You have judged rightly, child,&#8221; exclaimed they; &#8220;we will do exactly as you have proposed, and offer adoration to the mountain.&#8221; Accordingly the inhabitants of Vraja worshipped the mountain, presenting to it curds and milk and flesh; and they fed hundreds and thousands of Brahmans, and many other guests, who came to the ceremony, even as Krishńa had enjoined: and when they had made their offerings, they circumambulated the cows and the bulls, that bellowed as loud as roaring clouds. Upon the summit of Govarddhana, Krishńa presented himself, saying, &#8220;I am the mountain,&#8221; and partook of much food presented by the Gopas; whilst in his own form as Krishńa he ascended the hill along with the cowherds, and worshipped his other self. Having promised them many blessings, the mountain-person of Krishńa vanished; and the ceremony being completed, the cowherds returned to their station.” Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>H.H. Wilson also writes about it in his introduction of translation of Vishnu Purana,</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;and says that at Krsna&#8217;s advice Nanda and the other cowherds worshipped the mount Govardhana with the offer of various kinds of foods including meat of a sacrificial animal killed on that occasion and that Krsna took his seat on the mount, identifying himself with it, and ate up much of the food thus offered by the cowherds&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>It is also mentioned in Harivamsha Purana,</p>
<p>Harimvsha Purana 2.17.15-21 &#8220;Let us kill the animals such as buffalos to be eaten. Let this sacrifice be conducted with all gopas…Along with a pond of curd, a vortex of ghee, a river of milk, a variety of meat and a mountain of cooked rice, the entire complex of vraja including the happy gopa-s and beautiful gopi-s proceeded for the hill sacrifice…At the start of the sacrifice, the items were offered to the fire as ordained. The gopa-s performed the sacrifice along with brahmins on an auspicious day. At the end of the sacrifice, by illusion, Krishna became the hill and consumed the best rice, milk, curd and meat which were offered.&#8221; Tr. A. Purushothaman and A. Harindranath</p>
<p>This is also mentioned in Brahma Purana,</p>
<p>Brahma Purana 79.21 &#8220;[Krishna said] Hence, let the mountain Govardhana be honoured and worshipped with all due offerings after killing the sacrificial animal in accordance with injunctions. [25] Vyasa said: O brahmins, on hearing these words of his, Nanda and other residents of the colony became delighted with their faces beaming with pleasure. They said &#8216;Well said, well said, my boy&#8230;Accordingly the residents of colony performed Yajna unto the mountain. They offered oblations unto the mountain by curds, milk puddings, meat etc.&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Hundreds of animals were slaughtered and wine was drunk by Krishna&#8217;s family and Pandavas,</p>
<p>Mahabharata Virata Parva 4, Section 72, Verses 19-28 &#8220;And Krishna gave unto each of the illustrious sons of Pandu numerous female slaves, and gems and robes. And then the nuptial festival set in between the families of the Matsya king and the Pandavas. And then conchs and cymbals and horns and drums and other musical instruments appointed by the Pandavas, began to play in the palace of Virata. And deer of various kinds and clean animals by hundreds were slain. And wines of various kinds and intoxicating juices of trees were profusely collected.&#8221; Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Rama</strong></p>
<p>These are the words of Hindu god Ram before his exile,</p>
<p>Valmiki Ramayana, Ayodhya Kanda 2.20.29 &#8220;I shall live in a solitary forest like a sage for fourteen years, <strong>leaving off meat</strong> and living with roots, fruits and honey.&#8221; Tr. K.M.K. Murthy</p>
<p>This proves that meat was part of his lavish lifestyle in the palace. Rama also used to relish pork, meat of deer and other animals in the forest after the exile,</p>
<p>Valmiki Ramayana, Ayodhya Kanda 2.52.102 &#8220;Famished, they (Rama and Lakshmana) killed a boar, a rishya (whitefooted male antelope), a spotted deer and a great deer with black stripes. They partook the meat and reached a tree by evening where they rested for the night.&#8221; Tr. <a href="https://www.valmiki.iitk.ac.in/sloka?field_kanda_tid=2&amp;language=dv&amp;field_sarga_value=52" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">IIT Kanpur<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>Valmiki Ramayana Ayodhya Kanda 2.96.1-2 &#8220;Having shown Mandakini River in that manner to Seetha, the daughter of Mithila, Rama set on the hill-side in order to gratify her appetite with a piece of flesh. Rama, whose mind was devoted to righteousness stayed there with Seetha, saying; &#8220;This meat is fresh, this is savoury and roasted in the fire.&#8221; Tr. Shri K.M.K. Murthy</p>
<p>Sita addressed Ravana (who was in the guise of an ascetic) in the following way,</p>
<p>Valmiki Ramayana 3.47.22b-23 &#8220;Be comfortable for a moment, here it is possible for you to make a sojourn, and soon my husband will be coming on taking plentiful forest produce, and on killing stags, mongooses, wild boars he fetches meat, aplenty.&#8221; Tr. Desiraju Hanumanth Rao</p>
<p>This is what Rama said to Lakshamana on hunting a golden deer,</p>
<p>Valmiki Ramayana, Aranya Kanda 3.43.31 &#8220;Kings pursuing games of hunting in great forests, oh, Lakshmana, will be felling deer either for the sake of flesh, or just for the purpose of sporting archery.&#8221; Tr. Desiraju Hanumant Rao</p>
<p>Ramayana of Valmiki, Ayodhya Kanda 2, Sarga 55, verse 33 “Thereafter having travelled only a couple of miles the two brothers Rama and Lakshmana killed many consecrated deer and ate in the river-forest of Yamuna.” Tr. K.M.K. Murthy</p>
<p>Bali addresses Rama,</p>
<p>Ramayana of Valmiki, Kishikindha Kanda 4, Sarga 17, Verse 39 &#8220;Raghava, five kinds of five-nailed animals, viz., a kind of wild rodent, a kind of wild-boar, a kind of lizard, a hare and fifthly the turtle are edible for Brahmans and Kshatriya-s.&#8221; Tr. Desiraju Hanumanta Rao</p>
<p>Rama&#8217;s father Dashratha was an avid hunter,</p>
<p>Valmiki Ramayana, Ayodhya Kanda 2.63.21-25 &#8220;With a wish to do hunting as an exercise in that most comfortable season, I went along Sarayu River, in a chariot, wearing bow and arrows. Without my senses under control and with an intent to kill there a (wild) buffalo or an elephant or any other wild animal coming in the night at that place for the purpose of drinking water, I was ready with my bow at a solitary place. Hearing the sound, I killed turning towards it, a wild animal, which came to the bank of Sarayu River and another violent beast too which came there. Meanwhile, in that darkness and not within the react of the eye, I heard the sound of a pitcher being filled up, the sound of which appeared like that of an elephant. With an intent to hit that elephant, I drew out a shining arrow resembling a serpent, targeted towards the direction sound and discharged it.&#8221; Tr. Shri K.M.K Murthy</p>
<p>Some Hindus says that meat shouldn&#8217;t be consumed in Kali Yuga. But they are unaware of the fact that Kalki avatar who will be born in Kali Yuga will offer meat to Brahmins as per Kalki Purana,</p>
<p>Kalki Purana 30.10-13 &#8220;Lord Kalki sumptuously fed all the brahmanas the four kinds of food that are chewed, licked, sucked, and rank, and this included vegetable preparations, soup, cakes, meat, fruit, roots, and many other items&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Bhumipati Das, edited by Purnaprajna Das</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Shiva</strong></p>
<p>Mahabharata Book 13, Section 161, Verse 7 &#8220;And since he burns and oppresses, is keen and fierce, and endued with great energy, and is engaged in eating flesh and blood and marrow, he is said to be Rudra.&#8221; Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.30.202 &#8220;Hail to the one greedy of raw and cooked meat&#8230;[211] Obeisance to the jackal (fond of) embryo meal&#8230;&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Kalki</strong></p>
<p>Kalki avatar tells to perform horse sacrifice,</p>
<p>Kalki Purana 3.42 &#8220;(Lord Kalki said:) Many pious human beings become degraded in this age of Kali. But because of My presence, they will all become pious once again. Now I would like that all of you worship Me by the performance of a Rajasuya sacrifice and a horse sacrifice.&#8221; Tr. Bhumipati Das, edited by Purnaprajna Das</p>
<p>Kalki Purana also says that Vishnuyasa father of Kalki avatar will perform horse sacrifice. This proves that Ashvamedha Yajna (horse sacrifice) is permissible in Kali Yuga also. Secondly, Vedas are said to be eternal which permits animal slaughter so there is no prohibition to consume meat in Kali Yuga. Mahabharata also shows that Brahmins used to relish meat,</p>
<p>Mahabharata Book 3, Section 96 &#8220;…The Brahmana, however, did not grant the Asura a son like Indra. And at this, the Asura was inflamed with wrath against the Brahmana. And from that day, O king, the Asura Ilwala became a destroyer of Brahmanas. And endued with power of illusion the angry Asura transformed his brother into a ram. And Vatapi also capable of assuming any form at will, would immediately assume the shape of a ram. And the flesh of that ram, after being properly dressed, was offered to Brahmanas as food. And after they had eaten of it, they were slain. For whomsoever Ilwala summoned with his voice, he would come back to Ilwala even if he had gone to the abode of Yama, in re-embodied form endued with life, and show himself to Ilwala. And so having transformed the Asura Vatapi into a ram and properly cooked his flesh and feeding Brahmanas therewith, he would summon Vatapi…&#8221; Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Ashwamedha Yajna mentioned in Mahabharata,</p>
<p>Mahabharata Book 14, Section 89 “Vaisampayana said, &#8216;Having cooked, according to due rites, the other excellent animals that were sacrificed, the priests then sacrificed, agreeably to the injunctions of the scriptures, that steed (which had wandered over the whole world). After cutting that horse into pieces, conformably to scriptural directions, they caused Draupadi of great intelligence, who was possessed of the three requisites of mantras, things, and devotion, to sit near the divided animal. The Brahmanas then with cool minds, taking up the marrow of that steed, cooked it duly, O chief of Bharata&#8217;s race. King Yudhishthira the just, with all his younger brothers, then smelled, agreeably to the scriptures, the smoke, capable of cleansing one from every sin, of the marrow that was thus cooked. The remaining limbs, O king, of that horse, were poured into the fire by the sixteen sacrificial priests possessed of great wisdom.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p><strong>OTHERS</strong></p>
<p>Rishi Agastya is said to have eaten beasts and birds and even a Asura who was in the form of a ram,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 5.22-23 Beasts and birds recommended (for consumption) may be slain by Brahmanas for sacrifices, and in order to feed those whom they are bound to maintain; for Agastya did this of old. For in ancient (times) the sacrificial cakes were (made of the flesh) of eatable beasts and birds at the sacrifices offered by Brahmanas and Kshatriyas.</p>
<p>Vasistha Dharma Shastra 14.15. For it is declared in the Veda, &#8216;At a sacrificial session (sattra), which lasted one thousand years, Agastya went out to hunt. He had sacrificial cakes prepared with the meat of beasts and fowls good (to eat).&#8217;</p>
<p>Mahabharata Book 3, Section 199 &#8220;Lomasa said, &#8216;When Ilwala learnt that those kings along with the great Rishi had arrived on the confines of his domain, he went out with his ministers and worshipped them duly. And that prince of Asuras received them hospitably, entertaining them, O son of the Kuru race, with well dressed meat supplied by his brother Vatapi (transformed into a ram). Then all those royal sages, beholding the mighty Asura Vatapi, who had been transformed into a ram thus cooked for them, became sad and cheerless and were nearly deprived of themselves. But that best of Rishis&#8211;Agastya&#8211;addressing those royal sages, said, &#8216;Yield ye not to grief, I will eat up the great Asura.&#8217; And the mighty Rishi then sat himself down on an excellent seat, and the prince of Asuras, Ilwala, began to distribute the food smilingly. And Agastya ate up the whole of the meat supplied by Vatapi (transformed into a ram).” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Following verse shows that animal sacrifice was performed to please departed manes,</p>
<p>Brahma Purana 5.47-50 &#8220;&#8230;On the Astaka day Iksvaku commanded Vikuksi &#8216;O powerful one, kill some rabbits and bring their flesh for performing Sraddha.&#8217;O Brahmins, after planning to perform the Sraddha rite before executing it he ate part of the meat of the rabbit which was meant for the Sraddha&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>This is also mentioned in Devi Bhagavatam and Srimad Bhagavatam 9.6.6-8 and Devi Bhagavatam,</p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 7.59.1-11. Vyâsa said :&#8211; O King! Once on a time, the time for Astaka S&#8217;râddha (the funeral ceremony in honour of the departed) arrived. Seeing this, the King Iksâku ordered his son Vikuksi:&#8211; &#8220;O Child! Go immediately to the forest and bring carefully pure sanctified meat for the S&#8217;râddha purposes; see, that there be no neglect of duty.&#8221; Thus ordered, Vikuksi instantly went to the forest equipped with arms. He hunted in the forest lots of boars, pigs, deer, and hare. But he was so very tired with his journey in the forest and got so hungry that he forgot everything about the Astaka S&#8217;râddha and ate one hare there in the forest. The remaining excellent meat he brought and handed over to his father. When that meat was brought to be sprinkled for purification, the family priest Vas&#8217;istha, on seeing it, at once came to know that some portion had already been eaten and it was the remaining part. The leavings of food are not fit for the sprinkling purposes; this is the S&#8217;âstric rule…&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 5.20.16-50 &#8220;&#8230;The Râjasik Brâhmanas were versed in the Vedas and acted as priests to the Ksattriyas and ate flesh as sanctioned by recognised rules. They were busy with their six duties&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Sons of Pandu killed many animals and offered them to Brahmins,</p>
<p>Mahabharata Book 3, Section 80 &#8220;And, O chief of the Bharata race, those mighty warriors endowed with great prowess slew with pure arrows various kinds of sacrificial animals for the Brahmanas. And those tigers among men and repressors of foes, daily slaying those wild animals and sanctifying them properly, offered them unto the Brahmanas.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Mahabharata Book 1, Section 116 says that Rishi Vyasa divided meat ball into 100 pieces and gave it to Gandhari so she can conceive 100 sons.</p>
<p>Munis also used to partake meat,</p>
<p>Mahabharata Book 3, Section 159 &#8220;Having heard from that one of incomparable energy, (Arshtishena), that advice conducive to their welfare, those foremost of the Bharatas, began to behave always accordingly. Those best of men, the Pandavas, dwelt upon the Himavan, partaking of the food eaten by the Munis, and luscious fruit, and the flesh of deer killed with unpoisoned shafts and various kinds of pure honey.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Mahabharata Book 2, Section 4 &#8220;Vaisampayana said,&#8211;&#8220;Then that chief of men, king Yudhishthira, entered that palatial sabha having first fed ten thousand Brahmanas with preparations of milk and rice mixed with clarified butter and honey with fruits and roots, and with pork and venison. The king gratified those superior Brahmanas, who had come from various countries with food seasoned with seasamum and prepared with vegetables called jibanti, with rice mixed with clarified butter, with different preparations of meat&#8211;with indeed various kinds of other food, as also numberless viands that are fit to be sucked and innumerable kinds of drinks, with new and unused robes and clothes, and with excellent floral wreaths.&#8221; Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Some Hindus might try to twist the Vedic verses by saying they does not mean what they say, they are allegorical. You cannot say verses from Manu Smriti, Upanishad, Brahmanas etc., are allegorical, all those verses including the Vedic verses on meat consumption are literal. There is no prohibition of meat consumption in Hindu scriptures, so Hindus should not just enjoy eating meat secretly at night but they should start eating openly during day also.</p>

<p>Written by Sulaiman Razvi</p>
<p>Gambling is a vice which leads to loss of one’s wealth, brings destruction to family and it also leads to various other evils. Gambling makes one believe in luck rather than hard work, people resort to gambling as a short cut way to gain wealth. But this evil has sanctions in the Hindu religion. Whenever we imagine Hinduism and Gambling the first thing that comes to our mind is the Mahabharata episode with Shakuni holding dice in his hand. Gambling in India is much older than the Mahabharata period, one can find mention of gambling in Vedas also. Agni Purana chapter 91 has a superstitious ritual of making gambling board and throwing dice to know the future. It was not just money, property, cow or horses which were put at stake during the play but even humans especially wives were also staked in gambling. The examples are Draupadi by Pandava and Urvashi by Indra. Gambling is not something unknown to Hindus, Hindus spend whole night playing various types of gambling during the eve of Diwali. Dr. B.R. Ambedkar wrote in his book Riddles in Hinduism, “The Aryans were a race of gamblers. Gambling was developed to science in very early days of the Aryan Civilization so much so that they had even devised certain technical terms. The Hindus used the words Krita, Treta, Dwapara and Kali as the names of the four Yugas or periods into which historical times are divided. As a matter of fact originally these are the names of the dices used by the Aryans at gambling. The luckiest dice was called Krita and the unluckiest was called Kali. Treta and Dwapara were intermediate between them. Not only was gambling well developed among the ancient Aryans but the stakes were very high. Gambling with high money stakes have been known elsewhere. But they are nothing as compared with those which are known to have been offered by the Aryans. Kingdoms and even their wives were offered by them as stakes at gambling. King Nala staked his kingdom and lost it. The Pandavas went much beyond. They not only staked their kingdom they also staked their wife Draupadi and lost both. Among the Aryans gambling was not the game of the rich. It was a vice of the many. So widespread was gambling among the Ancient Aryans that the burden of all the writers of the Dharma Sutras (Shastras?) was to impress upon the King the urgency of controlling it by State Authorities under stringent laws”.</p>
<p><span id="more-4859"></span></p>
<p>Dr. Ambedkar also wrote, “Coming to Kali it is one of the cycles made up of four Yugas: Krita, Treta, Dwapar and Kali. What is the origin of the term Kali? The terms Krita, Treta, Dwapar and Kali are known to have been used in the three different connections. The earliest use of the term Kali as well as of other terms is connected with the game of dice. From the Rig-Veda it appears that the dice piece that was used in the game was made of the brown fruit of the Vibhidaka tree being about the size of a nutmeg, nearly round with five slightly flattened sides. Later on the dice was made of four sides instead of five. Each side was marked with different numerals 4, 3, 2 and 1. The side marked with 4 was called Krita, with 3 Treta, with 2 Dwapara and with 1 Kali.”</p>
<p>As Dr. Ambedkar said, four Yugas (stages of life) are named after dice throws. Dice were four sided, the side marked with 4 was called Krita, with 3 Treta, with 2 Dwapara and with 1 Kali. As per Chandogya Upanishad 4.1.4 the best throw or the winning throw was called Krita (another name for Satyayug), and the worst throw was called Kali. Chaupar form of gambling was most popular. The Sanskrit word Aksha (spelt Aksa) is generally used in Hindu text for Dice, in the Vedas dice were also called Babhru (brown) because nuts of Vibhidaka tree were used as dice in the Vedic period and later on cowries were also used while the oblong stick like dice known as Pasa were more popular. As per Rig Veda 1.41.9 a total number of four dices were used in the play and as per Satapatha Brahama 5:4:4:6 five dice were used in the play during Rajasuya ceremony. Gambling seems to have been part of amusement of the Kshatriya caste, Matsya Purana 61.32-33 states that a king Named Nimi used to play with women the game of dice, Markandeya Purana 20.1-5 mentions a king named Satrujit who &#8216;enjoyed himself both with gambling pastimes, and in the discipline of all kinds of weapons&#8217;.</p>
<p>Manu was a critic of gambling while there are various other lawmakers such as Yajnavalkya, Vasistha, Narada, Kautilya (Chanayakya)… commentators like Vijnaneswara, Haradatta who not only allowed gambling but even allowed gambling houses to run under state’s supervision. Puranas seems to be unfavourable to gambling while also providing some rituals and spells to ensure success in gambling. Same is the case with the Vedas, Rig Veda seems to censure gambling while the Atharva Veda has hymns for success in gambling. Seems like the early Aryans in Rigvedic period were averse to gambling and later developed fondness for gambling in the Atharvavedic period.</p>
<p>As per Gaudiya Vaishnavite (ISKCON) text, Kalidasa used to play dice in jest,</p>
<p>CC Antya Lila 16.6-7 “Kālidāsa was a very advanced devotee, yet he was simple and liberal. He would chant the holy name of Kṛṣṇa while performing all his ordinary dealings. When he used to throw dice in jest, he would chant Hare Kṛṣṇa while throwing the dice.”</p>
<p>In Kalki Purana 33.23 Kalki avatar is described as holding a conch, dice, club, lotus and bow in his hands. These two are not the only religious personalities of Hinduism who enjoyed gambling, there are other gods in Hinduism as well who enjoyed gambling very much and some were even addicted to it.</p>
<h1>Gods Playing Game of Dice</h1>

<p><strong>Shiva &amp; Parvati</strong></p>
<p>Have you ever wondered why Hindus gambles during their festival Diwali? Well, to learn about it you need to look it up in their texts. It is said that gambling during the day of Diwali was started by Shiva and his wife Parvati. Parvati invoked Lakshmi before the game started who seems to have helped her win the game, Shiva lost everything he had and the last stake was that he should remove his clothes, Shiva lost the last bet too and denuded himself. Parvati then declared that it is auspicious to gamble on this Pratipad, and the person who gambles on this day would mint money throughout the year,</p>
<p>Skanda Purana Book II, Section IV, Chapter 10, verse 20 “Sankara and Bhavani played the game of dice by way of fun formerly. Sambhu was defeated by Gauri in the game and let off naked. For that reason Sankara became miserable while Gauri was ever happy.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare.</p>
<p>Parvati also said that gambling only on the eve of Diwali is allowed. Shiva and Parvati playing dice is also mentioned in Skanda Purana I.i.34.76 and Padma Purana VI.122.21-32 which I have mentioned below,</p>
<p>Padma Purana Section VI, Chapter 122, verses 21-32 &#8220;&#8230;Siva and Bhavani took to playing with dice as a sport. Laksmi, propitiated by Bhavani remained in the form of a cow. Formerly Parvati vanquished Siva in the game of dice, and sent him away naked. So this Siva is unhappy. Gauri always remains happy. He who gets victory first (passes) the year happily&#8230;On the first day, when the sun has risen, Govardhana should be worshipped in the morning and one should play the game of dice at night. Then cows should be decorated&#8230;&#8221; Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p><strong>Krishna</strong></p>
<p>While watching Draupadi’s Cheerharan a question may have arose in the mind that why didn’t Krishna stop it? Why didn’t he stop the Pandavas and Kauravas from gambling? Well, the answer is Krishna wasn’t just fond of women or enjoying liquor but he was also addicted to gambling. He used to gamble with his wives, concubines and friend,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 10.69.19-22 “Nārada then entered the palace of another of Lord Kṛṣṇa’s wives, my dear King. He was eager to witness the spiritual potency possessed by the master of all masters of mystic power. There he saw the Lord playing at dice with His beloved consort and His friend Uddhava.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 10.56.5 “As the people looked at Satrājit from a distance, his brilliance blinded them. They presumed he was the sun-god, Sūrya, and went to tell Lord Kṛṣṇa, who was at that time playing at dice.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 10.66.36 “Distraught with fear, the people cried out to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who was then playing at dice in the royal court: “Save us! Save us, O Lord of the three worlds, from this fire burning up the city!”.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Varaha Purana 160.52-53 &#8220;At Uttarakoti (the northern end), there is again Ganesa. Here Lord Krsna was playing dice with the Gopis. Merrily playing with them, the Lord won all of them and their wealth in the game. He gave them all to the Gopas who commemorated the event there.&#8221; Tr. Venkitasubramonia Iyer</p>
<p>Aniruddha the son of Krishna was also fond of gambling,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 10.62.28-31 “Very agitated to hear of his daughter’s corruption, Bāṇāsura rushed at once to the maidens’ quarters. There he saw the pride of the Yadus, Aniruddha. Bāṇāsura saw before him Cupid’s own son, possessed of unrivaled beauty, with dark-blue complexion&#8230; As He sat opposite His most auspicious lover, playing with her at dice, there hung between His arms a garland of spring jasmines that had been smeared with kuṅkuma powder from her breasts when He had embraced her. Bāṇāsura was astonished to see all this. Seeing Bāṇāsura enter with many armed guards, Aniruddha raised His iron club and stood resolute, ready to strike anyone who attacked Him.</p>
<p><strong>Balrama</strong></p>
<p>Balarama is sometime considered an avatar of Vishnu. As per Hindu text, Balarama was addicted to gambling. Balarama is said to have played dice with Rukmi the brother in law of Krishna. It is said that Rukmi wanted to avenge the elopement of his sister Rukmini by Krishna so he challenged Balarama the brother of Krishna in the game of dice who accepted it without hesitation though he wasn’t an expert at it. Balarama lost many bets to Rukmi but won the final bet which was very big. Then an argument ensued between Rukmi and Balarama that Balarama had cheated him (Rukmi) and that Rukmi is the real winner. Balarama couldn’t tolerate this so he killed Rukmi for such petty argument,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 10.61.27- “After the wedding, a group of arrogant kings headed by the King of Kaliṅga told Rukmī, “You should defeat Balarāma at dice. He’s not expert at dice, O King, but still He’s quite addicted to it.” Thus advised, Rukmī challenged Balarāma and began a gambling match with Him. In that match Lord Balarāma first accepted a wager of one hundred coins, then one thousand, then ten thousand. Rukmī won this first round, and the King of Kaliṅga laughed loudly at Lord Balarāma, showing all his teeth. Lord Balarāma could not tolerate this. Next Rukmī accepted a bet of one hundred thousand coins, which Lord Balarāma won. But Rukmī tried to cheat, declaring “I’m the winner!”.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Same is repeated in Brahma Purana 92.11-22 and also mentioned in Vishnu Purana,</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 5.23.10-28 “After the wedding had been solemnized, several of the kings, headed by him of Kalinga, said to Rukmin, &#8220;This wielder of the ploughshare is ignorant of the dice, which may be converted into his misfortune: why may we not contend with him, and beat him, in play?&#8221; The potent Rukmin replied to them, and said, &#8220;So let it be:&#8221; and he engaged Balaráma at a game of dice in the palace. Balaráma soon lost to Rukmin a thousand Nishkas: he then staked and lost another thousand; and then pledged ten thousand, which Rukmin, who was well skilled in gambling, also won. At this the king of Kalinga laughed aloud, and the weak and exulting Rukmin grinned, and said, &#8220;Baladeva is losing, for he knows nothing of the game; although, blinded by a vain passion for play, he thinks he understands the dice.&#8221; Halayudha, galled by the broad laughter of the Kalinga prince, and the contemptuous speech of Rukmin, was exceedingly angry, and, overcome with passion, increased his stake to ten millions of Nishkas. Rukmin accepted the challenge, and therefore threw the dice. Baladeva won, and cried aloud, &#8220;The stake is mine.&#8221; But Rukmin called out as loudly, that he was the winner. &#8220;Tell no lies, Bala,&#8221; said he: &#8220;the stake is yours; that is true; but I did not agree to it: although this be won by you, yet still I am the winner.&#8221; A deep voice was then heard in the sky, inflaming still more the anger of the high-spirited Baladeva, saying, &#8220;Bala has rightly won the whole sum, and Rukmin speaks falsely: although he did not accept the pledge in words, he did so by his acts (having cast the dice).&#8221; Balaráma thus excited, his eyes red with rage, started up, and struck Rukmin with the board on which the game was played, and killed him… When Krishńa heard that Rukmin had been killed by his brother, he made no remark, being afraid of Rukminí on the one hand, and of Bala on the other…” Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p><strong>Indra</strong></p>
<p>Indra the king of all gods staked Urvashi in gambling with Pramati,</p>
<p>Brahma Purana, Gautami Mahatmya 101.9-12 &#8220;Indra said to Pramati: &#8216;In the same manner, give as requital your virtuous right hand along with its protecting cover as well as arrows. We shall gamble.&#8217; After entering into an agreement like this both of them began to play at dice. Pramati won the stake, viz., Urvasi, the divine damsel. After winning her Pramati said to Indra audaciously. Pramati said: (Offer) something else as requital. I shall then, O lord, play at dice with you. Indra said: O king, (I offer as stake) the thunderbolt worthy of Devas and the excellent chariot famous for having been used in various campaigns.&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<h1>Hindu Scriptures on Gambling</h1>
<p>Some Hindu texts not just allows gambling but even legalises gambling houses and levies tax on it, the winner must also set aside a portion of the gains for the king. The gambling houses are regulated by the state and there must also be a superintendent of the gaming house supervising the game. In case there is a dispute between two parties, then either the superintendent or other gamblers must settle the dispute and in case if other gamblers are enemies of either party then the dispute is to be settled by the king. Some text says that the gamblers needs to take permission for gambling from the king, in case he plays without government’s permission then he is punished by the authority. There are also strict rules set by the authority, those who cheat in gambling are punished severely by the state and sometimes they are even banished from the state.</p>
<p>Swami Prabhupada the founder of ISKCON implied that gambling is permissible for Kshatriyas,</p>
<p>“A <em>kṣatriya</em> is not supposed to refuse to battle or gamble when he is so invited by some rival party…” <strong>Swami Prabhupada on Gita 1.37-38</strong> <a href="http://www.vedabase.com/en/bg/1/37-38" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">http://www.vedabase.com/en/bg/1/37-38<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>Yajnavalkya Smriti Chapter II, Verses 199-203 &#8220;The keeper of a gambling-house shall take from a gambler five per cent. When the wager is a hundred [panas or upwards], and ten per cent, in other cases. Being well protected [by the king], he shall give the promised share [of his gains] to the king; he shall recover the wager, and pay it to the winner, [and] being over patient, [shall speak] the truth. [Payment of] that which has been won publicly in an assembly of gamesters in the presence of the master of a gaming house, and when the king&#8217;s share has been paid, shall be enforced, but not otherwise. The superintendents and witnesses in [gaming] transactions [should be] gamblers themselves. A man who plays with false dice, or by deceit, shall be branded and banished by the king. Gaming should be allowed under one supervision, as being a means of detecting thieves. This very law should be understood to apply in the case of Samahvaya [prize-fighting].&#8221; Tr. Vishwanath Narayan Mandlik</p>
<p><strong>Vijnanesvara in his Mitakshara comments on the above verses</strong>, &#8220;The officer of the gambling house, for whom provision has thus been made-he being protected from rogues and gamesters by the king-shall pay to the king a portion as agreed upon. Similarly, he should recover the amount of the wager i.e., should recover it from the losing party, by accepting a pledge or by arrest etc. And having recovered that amount, he, the keeper, should pay it to the winner i.e., the successful party. Also, being (ever) patient, he should always declare a true decision to the gamblers. That has been stated by Narada: &#8216;The master of the gaming house shall arrange the game, and pay the stakes won therein&#8217;.&#8221;<br />
<em>As mentioned in Legal and Constitutional History of India: Ancient, Judicial and Constitutional System, p.212, by Rama Jois, Published by Universal Law Publishing, 2004.</em></p>
<p>Apastamba Dharma Shastra, Prasna 2, Patala 10, Khanda 25, verses 12-13 In the midst of the assembly-house, (the superintendent of the house) shall raise a play-table and sprinkle it with water, turning his hand downwards, and place on it dice in even numbers, made of Vibhîtaka (wood), as many as are wanted. Men of the first three castes, who are pure and truthful, may be allowed to play there.</p>
<p>Commenting on Apastamba, Haradatta says that Gambling should be played in gambling house only, and the king is supposed to punish those who play it elsewhere. Translator of Apastamba Dharma Shastra also quoted commentary of Hindu scholar Haradatta in footnotes, Haradatta wrote,</p>
<p>&#8220;Having played there, they shall give a fixed sum to the gambling-house keeper and go away. The latter shall, every day or every month or every year, give that gain to the king. And the king shall punish those who play elsewhere or quarrel in the assembly-house&#8221;<br />

<p>Narada declares gambling to be lawful amusement, when carried on in a public gaming-house with prior permission of the king.</p>
<p>Narada Smriti 18.2-8 The master of the gaming-house shall arrange the game and pay the stakes which have been won; the profit of such a conductor of games shall amount to ten percent. When the dice on being thrown fall twice in a game at dice, those acquainted with (playing at) dice allot the victory to the adversary and the defeat to the gambler. When a dispute has arisen among gamblers, let (other) gamblers be appealed to; they shall act both as judges and as witnesses in a dispute of this sort. No gambler shall ever enter into another gaming-house before having paid his debt; he must not disobey the master of the gaming-house, and must pay of his own accord what he owes to him. Wicked men who play with false dice shall be driven out of the gaming-house, after a wreath of the punishment ordained for them. If a man gambles with dice, without authorization from the king, he shall not get his stake, and shall have to pay a fine. Or let the gamblers pay to the king the share due to him and play in public, thus no wrong will be committed.</p>
<p>Brihaspati mentions why Manu prohibits gambling and then mentions rules for gamblers and gambling houses,</p>
<p>Brihaspati Smriti 26.1-8 &#8220;Gambling has been prohibited by Manu, because it destroys truth, honesty, and wealth. It has been permitted by other (legislators) when conducted so as to allow the king a share (of every stake). It shall take place under the superintendence of keepers of gaming-houses, as it serves the purpose of discovering thieves. The same rule has to be observed in bets on prize-fights with animals&#8230;A wager (or game) shall be made in public; false gamblers shall be banished. When there is a point at issue between the two parties (in a game or wager, other) gamblers shall examine (and decide) the matter; if they are enemies (of either party), the king shall decide the dispute&#8230;The keeper of the gaming-house shall receive the stakes and pay the victorious gambler and the king; he shall also act as witness in a dispute, assisted by three other gamblers.</p>
<p>Katyayana Smriti verse 935-943 &#8220;If it (gambling) has to remain (has to be allowed) he (the king) should allow it to be done openly with an (ornamental) arcch erected near the door (of the gambling hall) in order that respectable people may not mistaken (about its real nature) and he should make it yield revenue (tax). The keeper of the gaming house should make the gambling go on and should himself pay to the king (the latter&#8217;s) dues. He (the keeper) should take from the defeated party ten percent as his profit. The keeper should give to the winner his money (out of his own pocket) and he should recover from the defeated gambler within three fortnights or at once; there is no doubt (about this rule). Where (the throw) of a man playing with dice in gambling is the same or double (of the previous throw) there the (former) gambler is the winner and his protection (from the other gamblers) is to be arranged for. Or the gambler (himself), after giving to the king his share (of revenue) as declared, should carry on gambling openly. In this way he will be guilty of no fault. The keeper of the gaming house should make the defeated gambler forcibly pay what (the defeated) has to pay in the same place (i.e. in the gaming hall) and not elsewhere; since the procedure (in gambling matters) entirely rests with the keeper of the gaming house. A person ignorant (of gambling) if defeated (in gambling) should be released (from his liability), but one who knows gambling should not be released if he is defeated in secret (gambling); when one knowing gambling has lost his all (in a wager), he should not be made to pay his all. In disputes (among gamblers), in (deciding on) victory, in the matter of the gain (to the winner), and as regards the means (i.e. dice) of those who are (alleged to be) playing with false dice, the keeper of the gaming house, if he is honest, is the final authority.&#8221; Tr. P.V. Kane</p>
<p>Kautilya’s Arthashastra allows gambling and states that it could be helpful to identify thieves as there is more possibility of thieves coming in gambling-hall to try their luck with stolen money, other than that it also states how much percentage the superintendents should charge from winners and those who cheat in the play,</p>
<p>Kautilya Arthashastra, Book 3, Chapter 20, Verses 12-14 &#8220;With a view to find out spies or thieves, the Superintendent of gambling shall, under the penalty of a fine of 12 panas if played elsewhere, centralise gambling&#8230;The Superintendents of gambling shall, therefore, be honest and supply dice at the rate of a kakani of hire per pair. Substitution by tricks of hand of dice other than thus supplied shall be punished with a fine of 12 panas. A false player shall not only be punished with the first amercement and fines leviable for theft and deceit, but also be made to forfeit the stakes he has won. The Superintendent shall take not only 5 per cent of the stakes won by every winner, and the hire payable for supplying dice and other accessories of dice play, but also the fee chargeable for supplying water and accommodation, besides the charge for license&#8230;&#8221; Tr. R. Shamasastry</p>
<p>Other than the Smritis the Purana also sets guidelines for gambling. Matsya Purana gives guidelines to servant of the state,</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 216.8 &#8220;In course of gambling and at the game of dice one should show his skill to the king but make the latter win.&#8221; Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, edited by B.D Basu</p>
<p>Agni Purana allows gambling with prior permission of the king and also states the amount of fine and punishment to those who cheat in gambling,</p>
<p>Agni Purana 253.13-30 &#8220;&#8230;Gambling (divine) consists in playing with dice, rods and Vajra, while the play known as human gambling consists in playing the game, known as the Panchakrida. A non-conformity to the king&#8217;s law or an act in direct contravention of a royal edict or order, constitutes an offence&#8230;&#8221; Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Agni Purana 257.47-53 &#8220;In duels or in gambling, the king shall receive five percent., of the fine imposed, while the king&#8217;s due is ten percent., on all fines realised from cheats and swindlers. Witnesses wilfully perjuring themselves in courts of justice, or gamblers winning any stake by foul play, should be banished from the country, branded with the insignia of the king.&#8221; Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Dice was also played as part of the Rajasuya ceremony which is the consecration ceremony of the king, although it’s not actually gambling but seems to be ritualistic play,</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana 5:4:4:6-23 He then throws the five dice into his hand, with (Vâg. S. X, 28), &#8216;Dominant thou art: may these five regions of thine prosper!&#8217;&#8211;now that one, the Kali, is indeed dominant over the (other) dice, for that one dominates over all the dice: therefore he says, &#8216;Dominant thou art: may these five regions of thine prosper!&#8217; for there are indeed five regions, and all the regions he thereby causes to prosper for him…Thereupon the tribesman and the Pratiprasthâtri, with that sacrificial sword, prepare the gaming-ground, (close) by the original fire, with the puroruk verse of the Sukra. The Sukra is the eater: he thereby makes (him) the eater…The Adhvaryu then takes clarified butter in four ladlings, places a piece of gold on the gaming-ground, and offers with (Vâg. S. X, 29), &#8216;May ample Agni, the lord of rites, delighted,&#8211;may ample Agni, the lord of rites, accept of the butter, hail!&#8217; He (the Adhvaryu) throws down the dice, with, &#8216;Hallowed by Svâhâ, strive ye with Sûrya&#8217;s rays for the middlemost place among brethren!&#8217; For that gaming-ground is the same as &#8216;ample Agni,&#8217; and those dice are his coals, thus it is him (Agni) he thereby pleases; and assuredly in the house of him who offers the Râgasûya, or who so knows this, the striking 1 of that cow is approved of. On those dice he says, &#8216;Play for the cow!&#8217; The two draught oxen of the original (hall-door) fire are the sacrificial fee.</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana 5:3:1:10 And on the following day, having brought together gavedhukâ (seeds) from the houses of the Keeper of the dice (akshâvâpa) and the Huntsman (govikartana), he prepares a gavedhukâ pap for Rudra at the house of him who is consecrated. These two, while being two jewels (of the king), he makes one for the purpose of completeness. And as to why he performs this offering,&#8211;Rudra is hankering after that (cow) which is killed here in this hall; now Rudra is Agni (fire), and the gaming-board being fire, and the dice being its coals, it is him (Rudra) he thereby pleases. And verily whosoever, that knows this thus, performs the Râgasûya, in his house that approved (cow) is killed. And he, the keeper of dice, and the huntsman, are (each of them) assuredly one of his (the king&#8217;s) jewels: it is for these two that he is thereby consecrated, and these two he makes his own faithful followers. The sacrificial fee for this (jewel) is a bicoloured bullock&#8211;either one with white fore-feet, or a white-tailed one,&#8211;a claw-shaped knife, and a dice-board with a horsehair band; for that is what belongs to those two.</p>
<p>Eggeling wrote, “In Taitt. Br. I, 7, 10 the game at dice, at the Râgasûya, is referred to as follows:&#8211;With, &#8216;This king has overcome the regions,&#8217; he hands (to the king) five dice; for these are all the dice: he thereby renders him invincible. They engage (to play) for a dish of rice (odana), for that is (a symbol of) the chief: he thus makes him obtain every prosperity. He addresses them (with the epithets of) &#8216;far-famed, most prosperous, true king.&#8217; The Commentary and Sûtras then supply the following explanations:&#8211;The keeper of the dice (akshâvâpa), having (marked off and) raised the gambling-ground (by means of the wooden sword), and sprinkled it, throws down more than a hundred&#8211;or more than a thousand&#8211;gold dice. From them he takes five dice and hands them to the king: these, as representing the five regions, are taken to include all those dice.”</p>

<p>It’s not just the Puranas and Shastra which gives these details. There are dedicated hymns in Atharva Veda to ensure success in gambling. Mostly the Apsaras were invoked during prayers for success in gambling. There are total number of 4 hymns with various other verses dedicated for ensuring success in gambling,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 4.38.1-4 “Hither I call the Apsaras, victorious, who plays with skill, Her who comes freely fort to view, who wins the stakes in games of dice. Hither I call that Apsaras who scatters and who gathers up. The Apsaras who plays with skill and takes her winnings in the game. Dancing around us with the dice, winning the wager by her play. Hither I call that Apsaras, the joyous, the delightful one—Those nymphs who revel in the dice, who suffer grief and yield to wrath.” Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>Another English translation,</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 4.38.1-4 “The successful, victorious, skilfully gaming Apsarâ, that Apsarâ who makes the winnings in the game of dice, do I call hither. The skilfully gaming Apsarâ who sweeps and heaps up (the stakes), that Apsarâ who takes the winnings in the game of dice, do I call hither. May she, who dances about with the dice, when she takes the stakes from the game of dice, when she desires to win for us, obtain the advantage by (her) magic! May she come to us full of abundance! Let them not win this wealth of ours! The (Apsarâs) who rejoice in dice, who carry grief and wrath-that joyful and exulting Apsarâ, do I call hither.” Tr. Maurice Bloomfield</p>
<p>Another English translation,</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 4.38.1-4 &#8220;The up-shooting, all conquering, successfully-playing Apsaras, that wins (kr) the winnings in the pool (?glaha) that Apsaras I call on here. The distributing (vi-ci), on strewing (a-kir), successfully-playing Apsaras, that seizes (grah) the winnings in the pool that Apsaras I call on here. She who dances about with the dice (?aya), taking to herself the winning from the pool let her, trying to gain (?) for us the winnings, obtain the stake (?praha) by magic (maya); let her come to us rich in milk; let them not conquer from us this riches. She who delights (pra-mud) in the dice (aksa), bringing (bhr) pain and anger the rejoicing, the delighting one: that Apsaras I call on here.&#8221; Tr. William Dwight Whitney</p>

Strike, as a tree with lightning flash, mine adversary in the game. The God who found for us this wealth for gambling, to cast the dice and count the winning number…As I invoke the Gods at need, as I have lived in chastity, May these, when I have grasped the Dice, the brown, be kind to one like me.” Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>

Do thou, O Agni, carry ghee for the Apsarases, dust for the dice, gravel and waters; enjoying in their respective shares the oblation-giving, the gods revel in both kinds of oblations&#8230;Let them make the rival gambler subject to me. Ill luck (?) to the opposing player; do thou shed upon us with ghee; smite thou him who plays against us as a tree with a thunderbolt. He who made this riches for our playing, who the taking (?) and leaving of the dice that god, enjoying this libation of ours&#8230;If (yat) a supplicant I call on the gods, if we have dwelt in Vedic studentship, if I take up the brown dice let them be gracious to us in such plight.&#8221; Tr.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Written by Sulaiman Razvi<br />
</span></p>
[This article is incomplete, This article will be scrutinized, inshallah I will do it as soon as I get time]
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">The Holy Kaba was built by Prophet Adam A.S and was rebuilt Ibrahim A.S. It is known as Baith Allah or the House of Allah. The Kaaba is a direction for prayer. However some Islamophobes especially some Hindus allege that Muslims worship the Kaaba or the Black Stone and they accuse Muslims of being idolaters. First of all they have to know what exactly is Idol worship, only then they should accuse Muslims of Idolatry. Idol worship is a veneration or worship of the Idol of any God. Islam is known for its staunch monotheistic stand. Islam prohibits Idol worship, It is mentioned in the Qur&#8217;an,<br />
</span></p>
<p><span id="more-161"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">22:30 &#8221;…so shun the abomination of idols, and shun the word that is false.&#8221;<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">14:35 Remember Abraham said: &#8220;O my Lord! make this city one of peace and security: and <span style="text-decoration:underline;">preserve me and my sons from worshipping idols</span>.<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">5:90 O ye who believe! Intoxicants and gambling, <span style="color:red;">(dedication of) stones</span>, and (divination by) arrows, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">are an abomination― of Satan&#8217;s handiwork</span>: eschew such (abomination), that ye may prosper.<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">It is mentioned in Hadith,<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Sunan Abu Dawood (Kitab Al-Aqdiyah) [24:3592] Narrated Khuraym Ibn Fatik: The Apostle of Allah (peace be upon him) offered the morning prayer. When he finished it, he stood up and said three times: False witness has been made equivalent to attributing a partner to Allah. He then recited: &#8220;<span style="text-decoration:underline;">So avoid the abomination of idols</span> and avoid speaking falsehood as people pure of faith to Allah, not associating anything with Him.<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Muslims do not believe the Kaaba or Black Stone to be God. Kaaba is a direction,<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">&#8221;…when a person making supplication (du&#8217;a) faces the sky–just as those performing the prayer (Salat) face the Ka&#8217;bah, since the sky is the qiblah of those who supplicate, as the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Ka&#8217;bah is the qiblah of those who perform the prayer</span>…&#8221;-(Sahih Muslim bi Sharh al-Nawawi. 18 vols. Cairo 1349/1930. Reprint (18 vols. in 9). Beirut: Dar al-Fikr, 1401/1981, 5.24)<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">&#8216;<span style="text-decoration:underline;">&#8216;Allah&#8217;s direction of prayer is the Ka&#8217;bah</span>. (And if thou shouldst follow their desires) their religion and direction of prayer (after the knowledge which hath come unto thee) that the Religion of Allah is Islam and His direction of prayer is the Ka&#8217;bah&#8221;– Tanwir al Miqbas min Tafsir ibn Abbas 2:120<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">People used to stand on the Kaaba and give Azaan. Kaaba has been rebuilt several times, it was brought down by the Sahabas. Can any Hindu even think of destroying idol of their god? Ibn Az Zubayr brought Kaaba down to rebuild it and later it was again brought down and rebuilt by Ibn Hajjaj,<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">&#8221;he (Ibn Az Zubayr) decided to bring the Ka`bah down. The people hesitated to bring it down, fearing that the first person to climb on the House would be struck down. A man went on top of the House and threw some stones down, and when the people saw that no harm touched him, they started doing the same. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">They brought the House down to ground level</span>…`Abdul-Malik wrote back, `We do not agree with Ibn Az-Zubayr&#8217;s actions. As, for the Ka`bah&#8217;s height, leave it as it is. As for what he added from the Hijr, bring it down, and build the House as it was before and close the door.&#8217; <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Therefore, Al-Hajjaj brought down the House and rebuilt it as it was</span>.&#8221;- Tafsir Ibn Kathir [<a href="http://www.qtafsir.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=303&amp;Itemid=36" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Source<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>]
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Idolaters won&#8217;t stand on their idols nor they will destroy their Idols. How can such claims be made that Muslims worship the Kaaba or Black Stone when Quran and Hadiths clearly prohibit any form of Idol worship? Hazrat Umar R.A said,<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">&#8221;…No doubt, I know that you are a <strong>stone</strong> and can neither benefit anyone nor harm anyone. Had I not seen Allah&#8217;s Apostle kissing you I would not have kissed you.&#8221; Sahih Bukhari, Kitab al Hajj 26, Hadith no 667.<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Muslims do not believe the Kaaba to be God. Muslims do not worship the Kaaba. When some Hindus are told these facts they say,<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left:36pt;"><span style="color:#c00000;font-size:12pt;">&#8221;They too, whom you call Idol worshippers, do not regard the image as God. They profess to worship God behind the Idol/image&#8221;<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">How true it is, let&#8217;s analyse. Hindu scriptures clearly states that &#8216;You should establish an Idol of God and worship it for the Idol is God himself&#8217;. Whatever we or the Islamophobes says carries no weight unless it is backed by some evidence, let&#8217;s have a look at what Hindu scripture have to say about it because if they are accusing us of Idolatry then our way of worship must be similar with idol worshippers.<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Garuda Purana 12.17 Then the son should place upon the <span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;">bed a golden image, and having worshiped it</span>…<br />

<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Devi Bhagavatam 3.13.49 These Saktis, capable of bestowing all the desires, <span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;">will be worshipped in Pratimas(images of clay, etc.)</span> in the whole of India.<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Vishnudharmottara Purana, Kanda 3, Adhyay 93, 2 in the former three ages, Krta, Treta, and Dvapara men were able to see a god directly but in the Kali age ment have lost that faculty; <span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;">therefore they have to worship them (the gods) in an image</span>.<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Devi Bhagavatam 11.23.21-33 … one is to worship one&#8217;s own Deity <span style="color:red;"><strong>in front</strong></span><br />

</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">This shows that the Idol must be in front of the worshipper.<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">BhrGhSuPari Grihasutra 2.14.2 <span style="color:red;">Having prepared the image of the god and worshipping it </span>with the unbroken rice and flowers as available&#8230;<br />

All the limbs, joints, etc. should be perfectly shaped with the respective weapons of the deity concerned.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">&#8221;O my child, <span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;">one should worship the beautiful and universally auspicious idol (of Devi) </span>which is the destroyer of great demons placing it on a car (chatior)&#8221;.-Devi Purana 30.6cd-7ab, Tr.

</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">These verses clearly commands Hindus to worship the Idol of their god, but Quran nor any Hadith tells us to worship the Kaaba. Hindu texts and Scholars say that Idol is God himself. Pratima means Idol, image, picture of god but Swami Prabhupada the founder of ISKON translates Pratima as Deity Form or Deity because he considers the Idol to be another form or incarnation of God. This fact is enough to prove that Muslims do not worship the Kaaba as Quran, Hadiths nor Muslims says Kaaba is Allah (S.W.T). Let me quote few verses from Hindu scriptures and passages written by Hindu scholars on this issue,<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">&#8221;…think of the name as Brahman, and meditate upon it, <span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;">just as people worship the idol, thinking it to be Vishnu Himself</span>.- Chandogya Upanishad Commentary by Shankarcharya on 12.1.4 ,The Upanishads and Sri Sankara&#8217;s Commentary, Volumes 4-5, p.200.<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">It is mentioned in Srimad Bhagvatam (Bhagavad Purana),<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">dravyaiḥ prasiddhair mad-yāgaḥ <span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;">pratimā</span>diṣv amāyinaḥ bhaktasya ca yathā-labdhair hṛdi bhāvena caiva hi<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Bhagavat Purana (Srimad Bhagvatam) 11.27.15 <span style="color:red;">One should worship Me in My Deity forms [Pratima/Idol]</span> by offering the most excellent paraphernalia. But a devotee completely freed from material desire may worship Me with whatever he is able to obtain…</span><span style="font-size:14pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">śailī dāru-mayī lauhī lepyā lekhyā ca saikatī mano-mayī maṇi-mayī <span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;">pratimā</span>ṣṭa-vidhā smṛtā<br />
</span></p>
<p><a href="http://vedabase.com/en/sb/11/27/12" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-size:12pt;">Bhagavat Purana</span><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a><span style="font-size:12pt;"> (Srimad Bhagavatam) 11.27.12 <span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;">The Deity form[Idol] of the Lord is said to appear in eight varieties</span> — stone, wood, metal, earth, paint, sand, the mind or jewels.<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;"><strong>Swami Prabhupada states</strong>: Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī explains that certain Deity forms, such as those made of sand, are manifested for a brief time to fulfill a personal desire of the worshiper. Those, however, <span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;">who desire to attain pure love of God should worship the permanent form of the Deity (made, for instance, of marble, gold or brass)</span>, and they should maintain continual worship. In Kṛṣṇa consciousness there is no scope for neglecting the worship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Bhagwat Purana (Srimad Bhagavatam) 11.27.48 <span style="color:red;">Whenever one develops faith in Me in <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>My form [Idol] as the Deity</strong></span> or in other bona fide manifestations one should <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>worship Me in that form</strong></span></span>. I certainly exist both within all created beings and also separately in My original form, since I am the Supreme Soul of all.<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;"><strong>Swami Prabhupada states</strong>: The Supreme Personality of Godhead is worshiped according to the faith of a particular worshiper. The Deity form, arcā, is specifically mentioned here because Deity worship is essential for spiritual progress. <span style="color:red;">Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura mentions that inexperienced persons may think that the Deity [Idol] is meant for the sense gratification of the worshiper, since superficially the Deity [Idol] is made of external substances such as marble or brass</span>. But through the process of installing the Deity by <span style="color:red;"><strong>chanting of authorized mantras, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">one invites the Supreme Personality of Godhead to enter the Deity form [Idol]</span>.</strong></span> By regulated, faithful worship one gradually <span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;"><strong>understands that the Deity [Idol] is completely nondifferent from the Supreme Lord Himself</strong></span>…<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">&#8221;But, greater is the difficulty of those whose minds cling to the Unmanifested; for the goal of the Unmanifested is hard for the embodied being to reach.&#8221; Gita 12:5<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Swami Prabhupada writes on this verse &#8221;Therefore, the bhakti-yogi accepts the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Deity of Krishna as worshipable</span> because there is some bodily conception fixed in the mind, which can thus be applied. <span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;">Of course, worship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His form within the temple is not idol worship</span>. There is evidence in the Vedic literature that worship may be saguna and nirguna—of the Supreme possessing or not possessing attributes. Worship of the Deity in the temple is saguna worship, <span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;">for the Lord is represented by material qualities</span>. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">But the form of the Lord, though represented by material qualities such as <span style="color:red;">stone, wood or oil paint, is not actually material. That is the absolute nature of the Supreme Lord</span></span>…God has an authorized <span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;">representation in the Deity form [Idol]</span>, which is called arca-vigraha. This arca-vigraha is an incarnation of the Supreme Lord&#8221;.<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Swami Prabhupada on Bhagwad Purana (Srimad Bhagavatam) 4.30.27:<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;">The form of the Lord as worshiped in the temples is called arca-vigraha or arcavatara, the worshipable form [Idol Worship],</span><br />
<span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;">the Deity incarnation</span>. This facility is offered to neophyte devotees so that they can see the real form of the Lord face to face and offer their respectful obeisances and sacrifices in the form of arca. Through such facilities the neophytes gradually invoke their original Krsna consciousness. <span style="color:red;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Deity worship in the form of temple worship is the most valuable benediction </span><strong>given by the Lord to beginners</strong></span>. All neophytes must therefore engage in the worship of the Lord by keeping the arca-vigraha (arcavatara)[Idol] at home or in the temple.<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Another Hindu scholar named Swami Sivananda writes,<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">&#8221;<span style="color:red;">Though the image is worshipped</span>, <span style="color:red;">the devotee feels the presence of the Lord <span style="text-decoration:underline;">in it</span></span> and pours out his devotion unto it.…<span style="color:red;">When you worship an image</span>, you do not say: &#8220;This image has come from Jaipur. It was brought by Prabhu Singh. Its weight is 50 lbs. It is made of white marble. It has cost me Rs. 500/-.&#8221; <span style="color:red;"><strong>You superimpose all the attributes of the Lord on the image and pray</strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">: &#8220;</span><strong>O</strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Antaryamin (Inner Ruler)! </span><strong>You are</strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;"> all-pervading. You are omnipotent, omniscient, all-merciful. You are the source for everything. You are self-existent. You are Sat-Chit-Ananda. </span><strong>You</strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;"> are eternal, unchanging. You are the Life of my life, Soul of my soul! Give me light and knowledge! Let me dwell in Thee for ever.&#8221;</span></span> When your devotion and meditation become intense and deep, you do not see the stone image. You behold the Lord only who is Chaitanya. <span style="color:red;">Image-worship is very necessary for beginners</span>…For a beginner, Pratima is an absolute necessity. <span style="color:red;"><strong>By worshipping an idol</strong>, Isvara is pleased</span>…<span style="color:red;">Even so, the Lord is highly pleased when a small portion of His Virat (cosmic) body is worshipped. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">An idol is a part of the body of the Lord</span></span>. The whole world is His body, Virat form. The devotion goes to the Lord<span style="color:red;">. The worshipper superimposes on the image the Lord and all His attributes</span>. He does Shodasopachara for the idol, the sixteen kinds of paying respects or service to the Lord…<span style="color:red;"><strong>The idol speaks. It will answer your questions and solve your problems</strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">. The God in you has the power to awaken the latent </span><strong>Divinity in the idol</strong></span>…<span style="color:red;"><strong>The awakened Divinity in the idol</strong></span><br />
<span style="color:red;">acts as a guardian angel blessing all, conferring the highest good on those who bow to it…</span><br />
<span style="color:red;">The image in the temple at Tirupati assumed human form and gave witness in the court to help His devotees</span>.- All About Hinduism, By Sri Swami Sivananda, p.70-4<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">&#8221;To the worshipper <span style="text-decoration:underline;">who believes the symbol, any kind of image is the body of the Lord under the form of stone, clay, brass, picture, Saligrama, etc. Such worship can never be idolatry</span>. <span style="color:red;">All matter is a manifestation of God. God is present in everything which exists</span>. Everything is an object of worship, for all is a manifestation of God who is therein worshipped.&#8221; – All About Hinduism, By Swami Sivananda, p.72<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Muslims do not believe the Kaaba to be Allah nor do we adore the Kaaba as the Hindus does to their Idols thinking it to be god himself,<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;"> Bhagavat Purana (Srimad Bhagvatam) 11:30:7 There we should bathe for purification, fast, and fix our minds in meditation. <span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;">We should then worship the demigods by bathing their images</span>, anointing them with sandalwood pulp, and presenting them various offerings<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">So it is evident from all these verses that the Idolaters indeed think their Idols to be God. Another bogus claim made by some Hindus is that Kaaba was actually a Hindu temple and the Black Stone is actually Shiva Lingam. There is nothing to refute as there is no evidence which proves their point. There is absolutely no evidence at all. This hoax was started by a self-proclaimed historian (popularly known as Mythistorian by experts) who believed that all religious monuments and religions are corrupted form of Hinduism and that Christianity is altered version of Kishna Neti and Islam is the altered version of the Sanskrit word Ishalayam. He gave fake reference from an imaginary book created by him. Surprisingly Hindus believes this book exis and even quote, well, Islam is such a beautiful religion that anyone would like to link their religion with it. The Mythistorian&#8217;s work is full of mistakes and does not contain a single fact. He was ignorant of history. He made such poor remarks on other religions, for example he claimed that the Muslim&#8217;s Namaz is originally a Sanskrit word called Namah. I wonder whether he did some research or just wrote his frustrations. The Arabic word for prayer is Salah. Namaz is an Urdu word originated from Farsi, the word Namaz is used by Muslims of Indian subcontinent for prayer. He and his claims have been refuted by Imran Khan in his Blog <a href="http://kaabaisnotahindutemple.blogspot.in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Kaba Is Not a Hindu Temple<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. Readers can go through the blog and see the idiotic claims made by Hindu nationalist. Shri Shri Ravi Shankar had also made such claims but later in a debate with Dr. Zakir Naik he honestly acknowledged that his claims are incorrect. There is no evidence at all that could suggest the Kaaba was a Hindu temple. There is also no preserved history which could suggest that Hindus lived in Makka or went there. Even a Muslim can make such claims. For example,<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">&#8221;Hindu God Ram was a normal Muslim, his name is altered version of the Arabic word Akram. His brother Luxman was also a Muslim his original name was Luqman, and his close disciple was Humam Bajar Ali which was changed to Hanuman Bajrang Bali. The Hindu God Krishna was also a Muslim his real name was Karim Shah. Shiva was also a Muslim his original name was Shuaa&#8221;. </span></p>
<p>So does it make them Muslims?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Another bogus claim made by Hindus is that the Black Stone is Shiva Lingam. How can this be so when both these have different meanings and their own origin. The meaning and origin of Shiva Lingam is discussed briefly in the article <a href="/index.php/2014/05/15/analysis-of-lingam/" data-wpel-link="internal">An Analysis of Lingam</a>. As far as Black Stone is concerned. The Arabic word is Hajre Aswad. Hajr means stone, Aswad means black. While Lingam means make erected organ and Yoni denotes female genital organ. According to the tradition, the Hajre Aswad (Black Stone) was white and was sent from heaven,<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Sunan Al Tirmizi Sayyidina Book of Hajj 9, Hadith 878 &#8221;Ibn Abbas narrated that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (SAW) said, &#8220;The <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Black Stone was sent down from Paradise</span> and it was more <span style="text-decoration:underline;">white than milk</span>, but the sins of the children of Adam turned it black.&#8221;<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Hindus try to link Yoni (Literally female genital which is the base of Shivling) with the silver frame of Hajre Aswad. They are not aware of the fact that the silver frame was not present during the time of Prophet Muhammad (P.B.U.H). When the Black Stone was broken into pieces during a war, Its fragments were cemented into a silver frame by Abd Allah Ibn Zubayr. The Black Stone is from Heaven (Tirmizi 878) whereas Yoni (Female genital or Shivling&#8217;s base) worship was initiated after the curse. There are two stories concerning its origin. First one is when the Sage Bhrigu was dishonoured by Shiva as Shiva was busy with his wife Parvati so Bhrigu cursed him to be worshipped in Linga and Yoni form which he desired the most, another story is that Shiva was cursed by the sages to be worshipped in Penis form for seducing their wives, Shiva&#8217;s male organ fell down to earth and burned everything, Shiva told Brahma and Vishnu that it will become calm only when Parvati takes hold of it in Yoni (female genital) form. For more information, read the article <a href="/index.php/2014/05/15/analysis-of-lingam/" data-wpel-link="internal">Analysis of Lingam</a>. So how can some people claim Black Stone is Hindu Idol when both these have their own origin and definition? Some Hindu brothers are easily deceived by Islamophobes. One should not blindly follow what the person is saying. It is incorrect to liken Shivling with Black Stone because ShivLingam is risen out from the Vulva shaped base known as Yoni whereas Black Stone is not and Shiva Lingam is not cemented into the walls of temple like the Black Stone. There is no evidence of Lingam worship in Arabia nor there is a mention of such Idol. I request the readers to read the Blog <a href="http://kaabaisnotahindutemple.blogspot.in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Kaba is Not a Hindu Temple<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> as I don&#8217;t want to add any repetitive refutations.<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:13pt;text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Conclusion</strong></span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><strong>:-</strong> It is inappropriate to say that Muslims worship the Kaba or Black stone since Idol worship means worshipping the Idol thinking it to be God himself. Kaba is only a direction for worship. Quran nor the Hadith tell us to worship the Kaaba, Islam strictly prohibits idol worship.<br />

<p>Written by Sulaiman Razvi</p>
<p>Why do Hindu women cover their head especially during worship? Have you noticed that a lot of Hindu women covers their head while offering prayers, meeting their elders? Hindus say that it is done to pay respect. Although veiling is not ordained in Hinduism like in Islam but some texts suggests that covering head or veiling was also common among Hindu women in Puranik period. Hijab is mentioned in the Quran and not Niqab (face veil) although face veil is also acceptable. According to <a href="http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/many-women-have-no-say-in-marriage/article5801893.ece" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">The Hindu<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> report, 60% of women in India practice face/head covering, the highest is in Rajasthan where 96% of women practice head/face covering, in Bihar it is 91% and in Haryana &amp; Madhya Pradesh the percentage is 88% while Muslim population in these states are just 9.1%. 16.9%, 7% and 6.6% respectively. We can find examples of women covering their head or wearing veil in Hindu scriptures. Hindu goddess Parvati is said to have covered her face with a garment while meeting sage Narada,<br />
<span id="more-1107"></span></p>
<p>Padma Purana I.43.128b-133b &#8220;Joining her lotus-like hands and <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><span style="color:#ff0000;text-decoration:underline;">concealing her face the beloved of the Mountain saluted the sage</span></span>, a heap of lustre&#8230;Then the respectable daughter of the Himalaya mountain, whose mind was amazed, saw the sage Narada of wonderful form. The sage also addressed her with (these) affectionate words: &#8216;Come, O daughter&#8217;. But embracing the father, she sat on his lap. The mother said to the respectable girl: &#8216;O daughter, salute the revered sage, blessed with penance. (Thereby) you will obtain a husband of your liking&#8217;. Thus addressed by her mother, <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><span style="color:#ff0000;text-decoration:underline;">she, having covered her face with her garment</span></span> and with her slightly trembling, did not utter any word.&#8221; Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p>Sati the first wife of Hindu god Shiva is also said to have practiced veiling, Brahma said,<br />
Shiva Purana, Rudra Samhita 2, Satikhanda section II, Chapter 19, verses 26-27 &#8220;Then, O sage, afflicted by the cupid and delighted in the heart of hearts, <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><span style="color:#ff0000;text-decoration:underline;">I lifted her veil and stared into the face of Sati</span></span>. I looked at the face of Sati many a time&#8230;&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Mahabharata says that Draupadi veiled herself properly while addressing sage Narada,<br />
Mahabharata Adi Parva 1, Section 210, verses 14-16 &#8220;Hearing of the <em>Rishi&#8217;s</em> arrival Draupadi, purifying herself properly, came with a respectful attitude to where Narada was with the Pandavas. The virtuous princess of Panchala, worshipping the celestial <em>Rishi&#8217;s</em> feet, stood with joined hands before him, <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><span style="color:#ff0000;text-decoration:underline;">properly veiled</span></span>, The illustrious Narada, pronouncing various benedictions on her, commanded the princess to retire.&#8221; Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Some verses about women veiling themselves,</p>
<p>Valmiki Ramayana, Yuddha Khanda 6, Sarga 111, verses 63-64 &#8220;O Lord! Are you not indeed enraged, in seeing me on foot in this way out through the city-gate, unveiled and come on foot in the way? O lover of your consorts! <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><span style="color:#ff0000;text-decoration:underline;">Look at all your spouses, who came out, with their veils dropped off</span></span>. Why are you not getting enraged in seeing this?&#8221; Tr. K.M.K. Murthy</p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 9.18.1-26 &#8220;&#8230;O Nârada! Seeing S&#8217;ankhachûda coming near to her, Tulasî covered her face by her clothing and she&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijananda</p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 9.19.2-94 &#8220;&#8230;The king S&#8217;ankhachûda then attracted his dear Tulasî to his breast and <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><span style="color:#ff0000;text-decoration:underline;">took off the veil fully from her face</span></span> and began to look on that, next moment he kissed on her cheek and lips and gave her a pair of garments brought from the Varuna&#8217;s house&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>You may have seen pictures of Hindu goddess Sita with her head covered by her Saree or other cloth. Valmiki Ramayana, Kishkindha Kanda 4, Sarga 6, verse 11 says that Sita dropped her upper cloth (Uttariya) and jewellery while being abducted so that her husband may find her by tracing her belongings. The Sanskrit word Uttariya has several meanings like shawl, scarf, upper garment. But since she used to wear Saree, so the upper garment here refers to scarf with which she used to cover her head. Manmath Nath Dutt also translates the word Uttariya as scarf here,</p>
<p>Valmiki Ramayana, Kishkindha Kanda 4, Sarga 6, verses 11-12 &#8220;Seeing me along with my four counsellors stationed at the hill, she dropped down her scarf and her ornaments. All these, O Raghava, I have taken and kept (with me. I will bring them. It behoveth thee to recognise them.&#8221; Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>It is mentioned in Tulsi Ramayana,<br />
Ramcharitmanas Doha 116, Chaupai 1-4 &#8220;&#8230;The one who is artless in manners and has a fair and graceful form is called Lakshamana and is my younger brother-in-law. Again veiling Her moon-like face with an end of Her sari She looked at Her beloved lord&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Gita Press</p>
<p>Bhavabhuti a 8th century scholar too refers to Sita&#8217;s veil in his Mahavira Charitra. It is further mentioned in the Mahavir Charitra Act 2 Page 71 that When Purshuram comes, Rama tells his wife Sita that &#8220;He is our elder, please lower your gaze, and put on the veil&#8221;. A 7th century C.E poet named Magha in his Sisupalavadha V.17 described the women of Krishna&#8217;s household as wearing a veil.</p>

<p>Some fanatic Hindus who are unaware of the violent passages in their book often mock other religious texts by misinterpreting them. They have no idea how violent Vedas are. Vedas are terror manual which turns humans into savages. Many tribes were destroyed as a result of the violent passages in Vedas. As per Vedas, you must kill a person who rejects Vedas, who hates Vedas and Ishwar, who does not worship, who does not make offerings to ishwar, who insults god (Blasphemy), one who oppresses a Brahmin etc. There are several passages in Vedas which calls for death of disbelievers. I am mostly using Arya Samaji translations of Satya Prakash Saraswati, Satyakam Vidyalankar, Devi Chand, Vaidyanath Shastri, Kshemkarand Das Trivedi, Swami Dayanand Saraswati, Shripad Damodar Satvalekar, and orthodox translations of Swami Karpatri and Shri Ram Sharma Acharya (Gayatri Parivar) and I will be using Griffith’s translation as well followed by Hindi translation of Hindu scholars. In the Vedas you will find numerous words to denote non-Hindus such as Adeva, Adevayu which means Godless, anindra which means against Indra, Ayajyu, Ayajvan which means unsacrifcing, Abrahman, Anyavrata which means followers of other gods, apavrata, avrata which means riteless, devanid which means haters of gods, Brahmadvish which means haters of devotion and those who denounce Vedas.</p>
<p><span id="more-746"></span></p>
<p>Rig Veda 9.13.9 “May you (O love divine), the beholder of the path of enlightenment, purifying our mind and destroying the infidels who refuse to offer worship, come and stay in the prime position of the eternal sacrifice.” Tr. SatyaPrakash Saraswati</p>
<p>Rig Veda 7.6.3 “May the fire divine chase away those infidels, who do not perform worship and who are uncivil in speech. They are niggards, unbelievers, say no tribute to fire divine and offer no homage. The fire divine turns those godless people far away who institute no sacred ceremonies.” Tr. SatyaPrakash Saraswati</p>
<p>Rig Veda 9.63.5 ”Augmenting the strength of resplendent self, urging the waters and rejuvenating all noble acts and destroying the infidels.” Tr. SatyaPrakash Saraswati</p>
<p><strong>One who does not offer Sacrifice is inhuman</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 8.70.11 “May your friend, the cloud, hurl that infidel down from heaven who differs from us in rites and rituals, is inhuman, who does not observe fire sacrificials, and who does not show reverence to Nature’s bounties.” Tr. SatyaPrakash Saraswati</p>
<p>Rig Veda 7.97.9 “O Lord of knowledge, this laudation is for you…destroy the godless and the malice of our enemy.” Tr. SatyaPrakash Saraswati</p>
<p>Killing Avrata,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 9.73.8 &#8220;&#8230;he, the all-wise, looks over all worlds; he censures those who are hostile in action, and who do not offer sacrifices and render no public good.&#8221; Tr. Svami Satyaprakash Sarasvati</p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.84. 8 When will he trample, like a weed, the man [Infidel] who hath no gift for him…</p>
<p>Yaska writes,</p>
<p>Nirukta 5.17 When, with his foot, will he trample the unworshipping man like a mushroom</p>
<p>Rig Veda 8.64.1-2 “May our hymns please you; O lord of resolute will power, please display your bounty. May you drive off the infidels. May you crush with your foot the niggard churls who offer no homage. You are powerful; there is none so powerful as you are.” Tr. SatyaPrakash Saraswati</p>
<p>Rig Veda 5.2.10 “May you roaring flames, O adorable Lord, be manifest in the sky as sharp weapons, to destroy infidels. In his exhilaration may his shining splendour inflict destruction. The godless hands try to bind him from all sides but do not succeed.” Tr. SatyaPrakash Saraswati</p>
<p>Rig Veda 9.79.10 “The powerful flowing elixir…It is the conferer of wealth, the king of vigour; It crushes malignities and harasses the enemies.” Tr. SatyaPrakash Saraswati</p>
<p>Rig Veda 8.76.11 “Both the heaven and earth shudder when you, O the resplendent Lord, uttering your fearful roar, crush down the infidel.” Tr. Satya Prakash Sarawati</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 5.21.3 ‘Let this war drum made of wood, muffled with leather straps, dear to all the persons of human race and bedewed with ghee, speak terror to our foemen.”Tr. Vaidyanath Shastri</p>

<p>Yajur Veda 17.33 “He is an ideal commander of the army, who is swift, keeps his arms sharpened, fearless like a strong bull, a zealous killer of foes, strikes terror in men…” Tr. Devi Chand</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 4.31.7 “Let the King [Varuna] and Manyu, the warm emotion give us the wealth of both kinds-earned and gathered. Let our enemies overwhelmed with terror in their mind and spirit and defeated in their design run away.” Tr. Vaidyanath Shastri.</p>
<p>Yaska Acharya also writes about terror,</p>
<p>Nirukta 10.21 …These are hemistichs. Like a spear hurled, it inspires terror (among enemies) or courage (among friends)…</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 7.36 “We learned persons accept as our ruler, thee, the introducer of new plans for our advancement, the master of loyal subjects, the embodiment of virtue, the most advanced in noble qualities and acts, the queller of the irreligious…” Tr. Devi Chand</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 7.44 “…This fourth warrior, full of delight, should subdue the irreligious foes.” Tr. Devi Chand</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 13.12 “O king, make progress in thy duty of administration, extend happiness to the virtuous. O terrible chastiser, burn down the irreligious foes. O splendid person, humiliate and consume utterly like dried up stubble, him, who encourages our foe.” Tr. Devi Chand</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 11.2.23 He who dwells fixed in the atmosphere, smiting the blasphemers of the god that do not sacrifice, to him be reverence with ten sakvarî−stanzas!</p>

<p><strong>Killing Women and Children</strong></p>

Vaidyanath Shastri.</p>

<p><strong>VEDIC GOD STEALS</strong></p>
<p><strong>GOD STEALING LIKE A THIEF</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.103.6 “To him, who is the performer of all deeds, the possessor and giver of strength, the truly powerful Lord, we offer devotional prayers. He a highwayman, snatches wealth from the godless exploiters and gives it to honest devotees.” Tr. SatyaPrakash Saraswati</p>
<p>Griffith’s translation,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.103.6 “…The Hero, watching like a thief in ambush, goes parting the possessions of the godless.” Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.93.4 Agni and Soma, famed is that your. prowess wherewith ye stole the kine, his food, from Paṇi…<br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="513" height="96" class="wp-image-7295" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/https-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-0602-5.png" alt="https://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/060218_0646_testinginfi6.png?w=513" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/https-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-0602-5.png 513w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/07/https-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-0602-5-300x56.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 513px) 100vw, 513px" /></p>
<p>Rig Veda 9.61.25 “The elixir of divine love flows onward, chasing the malignant, and driving off the withholders of wealth and thus it proceeds to the holy abode of the resplendent Lord.” Tr. SatyaPrakash Saraswati</p>
<p>Rig Veda 7.19.9 ‘O bounteous Lord, pious devotees, skilled in reciting hymns, sing their songs to you for your adoration. May you select us also to join them who by their homage to you, have become entitled to appropriate the riches of infidels‘. Tr. Satya Prakash Saraswati</p>
<p>Rig Veda 8.75.12 ‘Leave us not in this conflict as a bearer of load; snatch up the wealth of infidels and give it to us.’ Tr. Satya Prakash Saraswati</p>
<p>Rig Veda 5.4.5 “…May you come to bless our fire ritual. May you having scattered all our adversaries, bring to us the possessions of our foeman.” Tr. SatyaPrakash Saraswati</p>
<p>Here god is prayed to eliminate the rivals and to bring their wealth. Yaska writes on this verse,</p>
<p>Nirukta 4.5 “Having destroyed all assailants, bring to us the treasures of our enemies, i.e. having destroyed the forces of our adversaries, bring to us the treasures or the food from the homes of our enemies.”- Nirukta 4.5</p>
<p><strong>ALL NON HINDUS ARE DEMONS, BARBARIANS.</strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="417" height="523" class="wp-image-7296" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/https-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2014-05-tole.jpeg" alt="https://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/tolerance-hinduism-buddhism-jainism-zoroastrianism-false-religions-untitld.jpg?w=417&amp;h=523" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/https-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2014-05-tole.jpeg 417w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/07/https-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2014-05-tole-239x300.jpeg 239w" sizes="(max-width: 417px) 100vw, 417px" /></p>
<p>The reason it is important to know who are Demons in Hinduism is because Hindu apologists find no problem with violent verses in the Veda because it says to kill ‘Demon’, they just say that these verses are referring to Demons and not to non-Hindus and try to get rid of the argument. As I said earlier Hindu apologists usually takes violent verses in lighter vein because it says to kill demons. Vedas are said to be eternal, now the question is if those verses were applicable only to Demons then it means that those verses have become useless now. So why God revealed such verses for limited period of time in the eternal book?</p>
<p>Swami Dayanand Saraswati wrote,”The Dwijaas( the twice-born) – Braahmanaas, Kshatriyas, Vaishyaas are called Aryas, while the Shudras are called Anaryas, or Non-Aryas.”ATHARVA VEDA 19:62. In the face ofthese Vedic authorities how can sensible people believe in the imaginary tales of the foreigners. In the Devaasurawars, Prince Arjuna and King Dashrathaand others of Aryavarta used to go to the assistance of the Aryas in order to crush the Asuras. This shows that the people living outside Aryavarta were called Dasyus and Malechhaas… Besides, Manu also corroborates our position. He says, “The countries other than Aryavarta are called Dasyus and Malechha countries.” MANU 10:45, 2:23. The people living in the north-east, north, north-west were called Rakshasas.” Satyarth Prakash, by Dayanand Saraswati, Ch 8, page 266, Tr. Chrinajiva Bhardwaja</p>
<p>Dasyu and Rakshasa mean demon. Here Swami Dayanand quoting Manu Smriti says that all people living outside Aryavrata and those who do not belong to four castes are demons (Rakshasa, Dasyu) and barbarians (Mleccha). According to Hindu Dharma all the non Hindus are demons and barbarians. Here is the full translation of Manu Smriti,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 10.45 All those tribes in this world, which are excluded from (the community of) those born from the mouth, the arms, the thighs, and the feet (of Brahman), are called Dasyus, whether they speak the language of the Mlekkhas (barbarians) or that of the Aryans.</p>
<p>Now some say that this doesn’t refer to Non-Hindus but to caste Hindus who lost their status on account of their neglecting their religious rites which lead them to loss of caste. They aren’t convinced even after providing explanation by their own scholar. Maybe they didn’t read verse 43 of this chapter 10 which says that by neglecting sacrifices the Dvijas made their successive generation fell to the status of Shudra not Dasyu. If Brahmins, Kshatriya, Vaishya and Shudra losing their caste made them Dasyu, the question is why they aren’t regarded as outcaste but as Dasyu? Because verse 43 and 45 aren’t correlated. Verse 45 is plain and clear that those tribe outside the pale of four Varnas are Dasyu and non-Hindus aren’t included in the four castes. Manu Smriti 10.45 also refutes the claim of apologists who claim that Dasyu means non-Human beings since Manu 10.45 states that Dasyu can be from four castes also who has abandoned their Vedic religion (if we go by the explanation of apologists) since they claim that Dasyu refers to demons only. Hindu scriptures from Veda to Purana mentions demon, so where are all those demons now? Dayanand Saraswati wrote,</p>
<p>“You can still see that the description of Raakshasas given therein tallies with the ugly appearance of the negroes of today.” <strong>Satyarth Prakash, by Dayanand Saraswati, Ch 8, page 266, Tr. Chrinajiva Bhardwaja</strong></p>
<p>So he is comparing Rakshasa with present day Negroes (black people) we can ascertain from this line that people living in north east and north west were not really monsters but were native people who are described in such racist manner. Swami Prabhupada also wrote,</p>
<p>Swami Prabhupada writes: “…An atheist is called a demon, and it is a fact that even a person born of good parents can turn into a demon by bad association…” <strong>Swami Prabhupada on Srimad Bhagavatam 3.3.6</strong><br />
<a href="http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_3.3.6" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_3.3.6<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>An Indologist wrote about Dasyu,</p>
<p>“The picture of the dasyu that emerges from these passages is quite different from that of the raksas. There is nothing about taking the form of a bird and flying by night, no mention of disrupting sacrifices, and no connection with black magic. The dasyus seem to be human beings of a different race from the Aryans and of a different (adevic and abrahamanic) religion. The mention of the proper names of various dasyus who are defeated for (or by) certain Aryan princes (e.g. Dabhiti) also makes the dasyu sound more like historical figures. There are occasional mentions of taking land from the dasyus (RV 4.38.1). The mention of dasyus in connection with fortresses (pur-) is also a characteristic which is in contrast to the raksases. Raksases do not build fortresses and fight from them. It seems quite safe to agree with the general conclusion of Vedic scholars that dasyu refers to the indigenous people of the land whom the invading Aryans conquered or absorbed.” <strong>by Wash Edward Hale, p.154, Asura in Early Vedic Religion, Published by Motilal Banarsidass Publisher, 1986.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moreover the Aryans were engaged in battle against the Dasyus and the reason given is Dasyus sings no [Vedic] hymns; Dasyus are riteless, Dasyus have alien laws; Dasyus differs from rites and rituals and doesn’t observe fire sacrifices; Dasyus are faithless, niggars, without belief, sacrifice and worship. The main reason given to fight them is that Dasyus do not offer any gifts to Vedic deities and Indra was often invoked to wage a war against the Dasyu. Refer my article <a href="/index.php/2019/03/20/violence-in-hinduism/" data-wpel-link="internal">Killing infidels in Hinduism</a> for references. Dasa and Dasyu has been synonymously used in the Vedas. The Persian word <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dahae" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Dahae<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> maybe related to the Dasyu tribe mentioned in the Vedas. “The Dahae were a Scythian people of ancient Central Asia. A confederation of three tribes – the Parni, Xanthii and Pissuri – the Dahae lived in an area now comprising much of modern Turkmenistan. The area has consequently been known as Dahestan, Dahistan and Dihistan” [end quote]. The word Parni is also believed to be the Iranian word for Panis tribe. The Panis and Dasyu may be have been closely related to each other that’s the reason they are mentioned together in Rig Veda 7.6.3; 5.34.6. Many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dasa" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Indologists<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> have also opined that Dasa were a tribe of humans not demons. Apologist pathetic response would be that Dasyu in the Veda are described as having numerous eyes and hands which is a proof that they were demons. Even Rishis who are said to be humans are described in some texts as of having three heads, Vedic deities as of having face of horse, animal getting pregnant after drinking semen of Rishis, does that prove that Rishis and Vedic deities were also demons? Hindus have a long history of using epithets against other religions, the Aryans used to consider Dasyu as Anasa which literally translates to noseless but it actually means flat nosed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now let’s move on to Panis tribe. Panis too are described as Demons, but Yaska in Nirukta also calls them Merchant (Nirukta 2.17). Panis tribe were rich traders and they were consistently attacked by Aryans to plunder them since they did not patronize the priests who then invoked Vedic gods to attack Panis. Apologists gives lame excuse, when defending verses about killing and plundering Panis tribe, all that they say is Panis were demons and doesn’t explain the part where Aryans plundered them and were the first to fight the Panis tribe. If they were demons then why Aryans were so eager to get their donations? Veda reiterates that Panis brings no gifts to Vedic deities, so why crave for their wealth if they were so demonic in nature? Veda also mentions a member of Panis community named Bribu who is praised in Rig Veda 6.45.31 because he is said to have gifted many cows to Rishi Bhardwaj (Manu Smriti 10.107) in which he is referred to as a carpenter. Now all of a sudden a Panis member is praised, what’s the reason? Because the reason to kill and plunder them is clearly given in Atharva Veda 20.93.2 that the Panis brings no gifts, had they given donations like Panis Bribu then they would’ve been spared and would’ve also been praised in the Vedas. Panis were rich merchants, they also had carpenters they used to rear cattle, engaged in trade and amassed wealth. These are the characteristics of humans not demons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kikata too were plundered like Dasyu and Panis tribes because they didn’t observe Vedic rituals and didn’t make donations to Vedic deities. Veda also mentions Zoroastrians and calls them demons (Asura). The Asuras mentioned in Vedas are non other than Zoroastrians. They are actually Ahura worshippers (Zoroastrians). Vedic religion and Zoroastrianism are roughly of the same age they have many similarities like Vedic Yagna is called Yasna in Zoroastriniasm, Soma is Homa, Deva in Veda are positive while Daeva in Zoroastrianism is neutral to negative, Zoroastrian text also mentions Aryans. From Rig Veda Mandal 1 to 7, Vedic deities are also called as Asur but the definition when applied to Vedic deities is ‘Mighty’. When the Aryans moved from Central Asia to India they brought with them the memories, thus the word Asura is used till Rig Veda Mandal 7 as a praiseworthy word. And then it was turned negative and was also used later to describe enemies residing in eastern part of India such as Bengal and Assam like Asura king Naraka of Pragiyotisapura in Assam or Mahishasura. There’s also a tribe in India named <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/meeting-the-asurs-a-marginal-tribe-in-eastern-india/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Asur people<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> who claim themselves to be descendants of Mahishasura.</p>
<p>People of Lanka in Ramayana has been described as Demons. Hanuman burned hundreds of demons inhabiting Lanka for no fault of their when Ram’s enmity was towards Ravana and not towards inhabitants of Lanka. Ramayana makes no mention of humans residing in Lanka but refers to the people of Lanka as demons. Go to Sri Lanka and tell me how many demons you found there or at least try to find their bones.</p>
<p>Now let’s move on to the Puranas, which is the most important point here. Many Puranas especially Vishnu Purana book 3 chapters 17 &amp; 18 states that demons embraced Buddhism and Jainism. The reason I quote Vishnu Purana again and again is because two chapters of this scripture are dedicated in denigrating Buddhism and Jainism and gives a picture of how Hinduism perceives other religions. Hindu text says that demons embraced Buddhism. Their disciples and disciples would continue to preach this religion. Now as you may know Buddhism’s history is not unknown like Hinduism’s. We know who its founder was and when Buddhism was founded, we know that its founder really existed and was not a mythological figure. Buddhism was founded in the 6<sup>th</sup> century B.C. It was a time when humans had started recording history. So you tell me did any Greek, Roman or any traveller ever recorded that demons used to live in India and they embraced Buddhism as stated in Hindu scriptures? So what Hindus did is nothing but demonization of their enemies. Hinduism recognizes many tribes and Dasyus, Panis, Yavana… were among them and they have been demonized because as mentioned in Manu (10.45) all those who do not belong to four castes are Dasyu and Malechas. Now some also justify violent verses of Vedas saying that all violent verses about killing godless, riteless, those who do not offer gifts actually refers to demons and not to human beings and that demons were averse to humanity. An Asura named Rambha who was the father of Mahishasur was a devotee of Vedic deity Agni. Vishnu Purana bk 3 ch 17-18 states that demons were Vedic followers who couldn’t be killed unless they apostatizes from Vedic Dharma and embraces other religions like Buddhism and Jainism. So what these incidents prove is that even demons could follow Vedic religion but still that wouldn’t make them Hindus or Humans since Hinduism believes in birth based and only those belonging to four castes can be considered Vedic followers. So this refutes the claim that demons were averse to Devas or Humanity.</p>
<p>It is mentioned in Sutras,</p>
<p>Apastamba Sutra, Prasna I, Patala 9, Khanda 27.11 The expression Krishna Varna, ‘the black race,’ is truly Vedic. In the Rig-veda it usually denotes the aboriginal races, and sometimes the demons.</p>
<p>Vedas also states that the one who offers no worship is inhuman, wicked, evil, miser etc.,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 9.20.5 “Preserve us from the reproach of every one, who makes no offerings, is vicious and wicked and who utters ill words, so that we may be free (from anxiety).” Tr. SatyaPrakash Saraswati</p>
<p>Shouldn’t Ishwar be friendly with entire creation? Why Ishwar is friendly only with those who make offerings? Was it invented by Rishis to get wealth in the name of god? What about the poor people who don’t even have money to feed their children. Will Ishwar forgive them or punish them as he commands to kill those who doesn’t pour gifts.</p>
<p><strong>Beheading the Demons (Non Hindus)</strong></p>

<p>This verse refers to the Panis tribe, according to some scholars the Panis tribe were also part of the Vedic society but were plundered and killed because they made no offerings to Ishwar, this is why they are considered Niggards. But Yaska gives a different meaning, Yaska writes that Panis tribe were Demons. One is not to be deluded by the usage of the word Demon here as Demons and Barbarians are those who does not follow the Veda or who lives beyond the boundaries of Aryavarta. The Vedic followers are commanded here to crush the Panis tribe only because they make no offerings to Vedic Gods. There are more evidences to show that tribes were plundered and killed just because they made no offerings to Vedic gods.</p>

<p>Other verses shows that Ishwar provides protection to those who make offerings to him, but Ishwar slays the person who doesn’t worship or make offerings. Why is Ishwar behaving like a thug? Shouldn’t Ishwar be equal and friendly to everyone irrespective of their offerings? All the verses I quoted above orders to kill those who make no offerings, there are several instances in Vedas wherein tribesmen were killed just because they made no offering to Ishwar,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 3.53.14 “O bounteous Lord, of what avail are the cattle of infidels to you. Neither they yield milk nor do these faithless persons kindle sacred fire. May you bring wealth of these unbelievers to us and give us possession of people of low mortality and crush them.” Tr. SayaPrakash Saraswati</p>
<p>This verse is referring to the Kikata tribe who were plundered by Vedic heroes and killed. Maharishi Yaska explains this as,</p>
<p>Nirukta 6.32 What are the cows doing in Kikata? Kikata is the name of a country where the non-Aryans dwell. Non-Aryan tribes are (so called because it is said),’What have they done? Or their assumption is that religious rites are useless. They neither get the milk to mix with the soma, nor kindle fire.</p>
<p>Here the Vedic god is invoked to plunder the cows of of Kikata people and to plunder the wealth of the king of Kikata tribe. As I said earlier, many tribes were plundered and looted by Vedic gods just because they made no offering to Ishwar, Kikata and Panis tribes are few examples. Here is another translation by Arya Samaj,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 3.53.14 “O learned king! you possess admirable wealth, what do the cattle do among the atheists because they have no faith in the Vedic teachings and rites or in place inhabited by them. They yield no milk to mix with the Soma, and do not perform the Yajna with the ghee of the cows. Therefore, bring them to us, so that we may use them for hospitality (giving the milk mixed with Soma) to teachers and preachers. Give us wealth taken away from the wicked persons for the use of those who hailing from a good family come to us. Remove far away from us a man who uses his power for doing mean or inglorious acts or keep him under us.” Tr. Acharya Dharma Deva Vidya Martanda</p>
<p><strong>Swami Dayanand Saraswati wrote on this verse</strong>, “As the cows do not grow among the wicked atheists, in the same manner, Dharma and other virtues do not grow among the persons lacking faith. Among the enlightened persons atheists can never have the upper hand. Therefore, good scholars should blot out atheism.” Tr. Acharya Dharma Deva Vidya Martanda</p>

<p>Is it right to kill someone just because they hate you or Ishwar? What kind of God is Ishwar who commands to kill the person who just hates him. The above verse explicitly says to be the first one to kill those who just ‘Hate’ you. Is this justifiable? If you just oppress a Brahmin you are liable to be killed according to Vedas, but the Brahmin can kill you, deprive you of your property, there is no sin in this, but oppressing a Brahmin is a grave sin in Vedas,</p>

<p>Poor Shudra’s fate is to be oppressed by Brahmins,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 8.417 A Brahmana may confidently seize the goods of (his) Sudra (slave); for, as that (slave) can have no property, his master may take his possessions.</p>
<p>Maharishi Manu says that a Brahmin can even kill anyone who hurts him without bringing notice to the King,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 9.31-33 A Brahmana who knows the law need not bring any (offence) to the notice of the king; by his own power alone be can punish those men who injure him. His own power is greater than the power of the king; the Brahmana therefore, may punish his foes by his own power alone. Let him use without hesitation the sacred texts, revealed by Atharvan and by Angiras; speech, indeed, is the weapon of the Brahmana, with that he may slay his enemies.</p>

<p>It is mentioned in Bhagwad Purana (Srimad Bhagvatam)</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagvatam 4.4.17 Sati continued: If one hears an irresponsible person blaspheme the master and controller of religion, one should block his ears and go away if unable to punish him. But if one is able to kill, then one should by force cut out the blasphemer’s tongue and kill the offender, and after that one should give up his own life.</p>
<p>ISKCON scholar writes on this verse,</p>
<p>“If possible she should have cut out Daksha’s tongue because he blasphemed Lord Siva. In other words, since Lord Siva is the protector of religion, a person who vilifies him should be killed at once, and after killing such a person, one should give up one’s life…The instruction set forth here in Srimad-Bhagavatam is that one should not tolerate at any cost the activities of a person who vilifies or blasphemes an authority. If one is a Brahmana he should not give up his body because by doing so he would be responsible for killing a Brahmana; therefore a Brahmana should leave the place or block his ears so that he will not hear the blasphemy. If one happens to be a Kshatriya he has the power to punish any man; therefore a Kshatriya should at once cut out the tongue of the vilifier and kill him. But as far as the Vaisyas and Sudras are concerned, they should immediately give up their bodies.” [<a href="http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_4.4.17" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right"> http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_4.4.17 <span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>]
