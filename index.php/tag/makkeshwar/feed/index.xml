The title &#8220;Vikramaditya&#8221; was later assumed by many other kings in Indian history, notably the Gupta King <a title="Chandragupta II" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandragupta_II" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right"><span style="color:blue;text-decoration:underline;">Chandragupta II</span><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> and <a title="Samrat Hem Chandra Vikramaditya" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samrat_Hem_Chandra_Vikramaditya" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right"><span style="color:blue;text-decoration:underline;">Samrat Hem Chandra Vikramaditya</span><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> (popularly known as &#8216;<a title="Hemu" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemu" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right"><span style="color:blue;text-decoration:underline;">Hemu</span><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>&#8216;).<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span id="more-639"></span></p>
<p style="background:#f8fcff;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">The legendary Vikramaditya is a popular figure in both Sanskrit and regional languages in India. <span style="background-color:yellow;">His name is conveniently associated with <strong>any event or monument whose historical details are unknown,</strong> though a whole cycles of tales have <strong>grown around him</strong></span>. The two <span style="background-color:yellow;">most famous ones in Sanskrit are <a title="Vetala Panchvimshati" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vetala_Panchvimshati" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right"><span style="color:blue;text-decoration:underline;"><em>Vetala Panchvimshati</em></span><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> or &#8216; (&#8220;The 25 (tales) of the Vampire&#8221;)</span> and <em>Simhasana-Dwatrimshika</em> (&#8220;The 32 (tales) of the throne&#8221;<em>). These two are found in varying versions in Sanskrit and also in the regional languages.</em><br />
</span></p>
<p style="background:#f8fcff;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">The tales of the vampire (<a title="Vetala" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vetala" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right"><span style="color:blue;text-decoration:underline;">Vetala</span><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>) tell twenty-five stories in which the king tries to capture and hold on to a vampire that tells a puzzling tale and ends it with a question for the king. In fact, earlier the king was approached by a Sadhu to bring the vampire to him but without uttering a word, otherwise the vampire would fly back to its place. The king can be quiet only if he does not know the answer, else his head would burst open. Unfortunately, the king discovers that he knows the answer to every question; therefore the cycle of catching the vampire and letting it escape continues for twenty-four times till the last question puzzles Vikramaditya. A version of these tales can be found embedded in the <a title="Kathasaritsagara" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathasaritsagara" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right"><span style="color:blue;text-decoration:underline;">Katha-Saritsagara</span><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:red;"><strong><em>The name Vikramaditya&#8211;Sun of Valour&#8211;is probably not a proper name, but a title like Pharaoh or Tsar. No doubt Kalidasa intended to pay a tribute to his patron, the Sun of Valour, in the very title of his play, Urvashi won by Valour.</em></strong></span><br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>THE MYSTERIOUS ORIGINAL KING VIKRAMADITYA</strong></span></span></p>
<p><em>V.S.Gopalakrishnan</em></p>
<p>Whoever may not have heard of the &#8220;<strong>Vikram-Betal</strong>&#8221; stories, the fascinating tales about the great King Vikramaditya and Betal, the vampire? Was he a real king or was he only a legendary, imaginary figure? If anything gets my goat, it is the seamless intertwining of the two, the truth and fiction. Let us take this guy under our microscope. After all, very few human beings are known as creators of eras named after them! We all know about <strong>Vikram Samvat</strong>.</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">Somewhere in wikipedia, you find the date of King Vikramaditya as 102 BC to 15 AD, but in the same sentence it is mentioned that he was a <strong>legendary</strong> emperor of <strong>Ujjain</strong>, India, known for his wisdom, valour and magnanimity! Where does history end and legend start? I am flummoxed!<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">However, the Vikram Era that starts from <strong>56 BC </strong>is not legend but is historical, and is real even today. That year marks the defeat of the invading <strong>Sakas</strong> (powerful Central Asian Tribes) by King Vikramaditya when Ujjain was invaded. The Vikram Samvat calendar is popular in Northern India and in Western India. It is a lunar calendar and the year starts with the day after the new moon in Chaitra. While the Government of India has adopted the <strong>Saka Calendar (starting 78 AD)</strong> for official purposes, the Government of Nepal has been officially following the Vikram Samvat, which they call Bikram Samvat. One must remember that the Saka Era (starting 78 AD) is a misnomer in a sense since really speaking it also celebrates the defeat of Sakas, at the hands of the Satavahana King <strong>Shalivahana in the year 78 AD</strong>. The Saka era is also called Shalivahana era.<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">The Saka people (also called Scythians) of Central Asia did however settle down in North India from 2<sup>nd</sup> century BC to 4<sup>th</sup> century AD, and they gave rise to <strong>Indo-Scy</strong>t<strong>hians</strong>. Sakas occupied and ruled Western India too and the rulers were called <strong>Western Satraps</strong>. Large sections of the Rajasthanis (kshatriyas) are descendants of the Sakas. There is an amazing combination of foreign blood in the Hindus. Similarly, sections of Rajasthanis and Gujaratis are also considered the descendants of the fierce, formidable and cruel <strong>Huna tribe</strong> (also called the <strong>Huns</strong>) of Central Asia which over-ran and ruled North India, under their leader <strong>Toramana</strong> and later his son<strong> Mih</strong>ir<strong>akula</strong> in the 5<sup>th</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> centuries AD. The two father and son Hun rulers were cruel to the subjects and particularly destroyed Buddhist cities, monuments etc. Mihirakula became a Hindu towards the end of his life.<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><strong>KATHA-SARIT-SAGARA</strong>:<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">Coming back to the ancient King Vikramaditya, we find accounts about him in &#8220;Katha-Sarit-Sagara&#8221; (meaning Ocean of Tales) written in Sanskrit by a Kashmiri Pundit called <strong>Soma Deva Bhatta </strong>in the middle of the 12<sup>th</sup> century AD. Soma Deva wrote it for the entertainment of Queen <strong>Suryamati,</strong> wife of King <strong>Anantdeva</strong> of Kashmir. It is said that it consisted of 350 stories in 18 books, 124 chapters, 21000 verses and prose too! This is the biggest compilation of Indian tales ever.<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">Accounts and stories about King Vikramaditya that are found in the Katha-Sarit-Sagara were written <strong>1200 years </strong>after his time, and the problem will be one of what is history and truth and what is fiction and legend. There sure must be some admixture of both! The 25 stories of Vikram-Betal form part of the work, as also accounts of Vikramaditya&#8217;s life.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><strong>HIS LIFE:</strong><br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">As per Katha-Sarit-Sagara, Vikramaditya was the son of King <strong>Mahendraditya</strong> of the <strong>Paramara</strong> Dynasty. However, the Paramara (also known as Pawar) Dynasty came into being around 800 AD only, founded by <strong>Upendra.</strong> The most significant Paramara Ruler was Bhoja I and the capital city was Dharanagara (present <strong>Dhar</strong>). Thus, the Ocean seems to be off the mark. However, the Betal story in the Katha-Sarit-Sagara does go with the original Vikramaditya of the first century BC!<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><strong>BHAVISHYA PURANA</strong>:<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">&#8220;Bhavishya Purana&#8221; in verse form has a lot to say about the life of Vikramaditya. It is one of the major 18 Puranas and is said to have been written by Vyasa several centuries before Christ. The work literally means &#8220;History of the Future&#8221;. The Purana starts with the greatness of Shiva, Vishnu, Surya etc. It has uncannily predicted, believe it or not, the following – Jesus Christ, Muhammad, fall of Sanskrit, Chandragupta, Ashoka, Chaitanya, Akbar, Jaichandra, British Rule, Hitler etc. The events are written as having already taken place.<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">The following account owes itself to the &#8220;Bhavishya Purana&#8221; as for Vikramaditya, whom we may call Vikram here for brevity. Vikram&#8217;s father was <strong>Gandharvasena</strong>, son of Lord<strong> Indra</strong>. Are we not into myths here? Once, while Apsara <strong>Mohini</strong> was on her way to meet Siva on Mount Kailasa, Gandharvasena (Vikram&#8217;s father) happened to obstruct her way. Enraged at this, Lord Indra cursed him (his own son Gandharvasena) and turned him into a donkey with certain riders. We may omit portions regarding the donkey becoming a human again. Vikram was only 5 years old when he entered a penance for 12 years. He was bestowed with extraordinary power and insights. His elder brother Bhartuhari renounced his throne and the kingdom came to Vikram. King Vikram was known for justice, sagacity, wisdom, valour, charity and generosity.<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">I will not go into any aspect of the twenty five Vikram-Betal stories known as &#8220;<strong>Vetala Panchavimshati</strong>&#8221; which are fascinating to say the least. Some years ago, Doordarshan telecast the stories in a serial. I shall try to attempt a separate blog about the stories. There are also 32 stories relating to Vikramaditya Simhasan (throne) and they are called &#8220;<strong>Simhasana Dwatrimshika</strong>&#8220;. King <strong>Shalivahana of Paithan </strong>after whom Saka era is named, is said to be Vikram&#8217;s grandson.<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><strong>KAABA AND KING VIKRAM:</strong><br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">Of late, an excitement has been aroused among the people with the alleged discovery of King Vikram&#8217;s inscription inside the <strong>Kaaba at Mecca</strong>. It is alleged that there is a Shiva lingam inside the Kaaba. Thus, Arabia came under the vast extent of King Vikram&#8217;s empire. Prophet Mohammad, it is said, took the crescent moon emblem for Islam from Shiva&#8217;s adornment. There are quite a few articles in the Net on this subject. However, the Net is hardly the place where you get to really read scientific or highly scholarly papers. I am personally unable to judge the authenticity of all the claims about Kaaba. The readers may throw light on this giving links.<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><strong>OTHER VIKRAMADITYAS</strong>:<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">The title &#8220;Vikramaditya&#8221; was adopted by some well-known kings of India in later times. Notable examples are the <strong>Gupta King Chandragupta the second Vikramaditya </strong>and <strong>Samrat Hem Chandra Vikramaditya (also known as Hemu). </strong>The former, the great Gupta King, who was the son of Samudragupta, and who ruled from 375 to 413 AD, defeated the last king Rudrasimha III of the Shaka Satrap Dynasty in Gujerat and annexed that kingdom to his vast territory. Hemu (1501-56), the son of a Brahmin priest, became a trusted Army Chief and Prime Minister under the Suri Dynasty (Afghans). The Afghans (Suris) and Mughals (Babar and Humayun) were at loggerheads for the Delhi Throne. Hemu benefited by this and took the Delhi throne in 1556 for a short time and ruled as a Hindu Emperor after 350 years of rule by Muslims.<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">As far as Vikramaditya was concerned, the fiction part could be that he was Lord Indra&#8217;s grandson and that his father was turned into a horse for some time. Also, despite the loveliness of the Betal tales, the Betal communicating with Vikram is certainly an impossibility. </span></p>
<p>I took out my copy of &#8220;An Advanced History of India&#8221; by RC Majumdar and two others. It is a standard and advanced textbook used by History PG students. This is what the book says (at p.112, 4th edition):</p>
<p>QUOTE<br />
&#8220;Some scholars attribute to Azes I the foundation of that reckoning commencing 58 BC which afterwards came to be known as Vikrama samvat., but the matter cannot be regarded as certain.Indian tradition ascribes to it an Indian origin. It (tradition) was handed down by the Malava tribe, and in the post-Gupta period came to be associated with the great Vikramaditya, the destroyer of the Sakas&#8221;.<br />
UNQUOTE</p>
<p>For me the above skeletal passage is so disappointing! (Azes was a foreigner and how can Azes establish a Vikram era????)</p>
<p>So, Majumdar has totally neglected King Vikramaditya of the first century BC! He talks about indigenous origin, since Azes was a foreigner. This is the poor way our history is written!<br />
&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p>Then I took out my copy of the &#8220;Oxford History of India&#8221; by Vincent Smith. On p.167 (4th edition), Smith says;</p>
<p>QUOTE<br />
&#8221; Later in life, he (Chandragupta II ) took the additional title Vikramaditya (&#8220;Sun of Prowess&#8217;), which is associated by tradition with the Raja of Ujjain who is believed to have defeated the Sakas and established the Vikrama era in 58-57 BC. It is possible that such a Raja may really have existed, <span style="background-color:yellow;">although the tradition has not been verified by the discovery of inscriptions, coins or monuments</span>&#8220;.<br />
UNQUOTE</p>
<p>I find Smith to be vastly better than Majumdar!</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>

</span><span style="font-family:Arial;">منار</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">), a tower in Delhi, India, is at 72.5 meters the world&#8217;s tallest brick minaret. Construction commenced in 1193 under the orders of India&#8217;s first Muslim ruler Qutb-ud-din Aibak, and the topmost storey of the minaret was completed in 1386 by Firuz Shah Tughluq. The complex is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Delhi, and was also India&#8217;s most visited monument in 2006, as it attracted 3.9 million visitors, even more than the Taj Mahal, which drew about 2.5 million visitors more than the MAHA KUMBH mela.<br />
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">If Kutub Minar was a Hindu atrominical tower as Oak claimed what about, the other towers present in undivided India ???<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">Inspired by the Minaret of Jam in Afghanistan and wishing to surpass it, Qutbuddin Aibak, the first Muslim ruler of Delhi, commenced construction of the QutbMinar in 1193, but could only complete its base. His successor, Iltutmish, added three more stories and, in 1386, Firuz Shah Tughluq constructed the fifth and the last story. The development of architectural styles from Aibak to Tughluq is quite evident in the minaret. Like earlier towers erected by the Ghaznavids and Ghurids in Afghanistan, the Qutb Minar comprises several superposed flanged and cylindrical shafts, separated by balconies carried on Muqarnas corbels.<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">The purpose for building this monument has been variously speculated upon. It could take the usual role of a minaret, calling people for prayer in the Quwwat-ul-Islam mosque, the earliest extant mosque built by the Delhi Sultans. Other possibilities are a tower of victory, a monument signifying the might of<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">Islam, or a watch tower for defense.<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"> Oak says: </span><span style="color:darkblue;font-family:Arial;font-size:13pt;">Firstly, the inscription on the iron pillar near the so-called Kutub Minar refers to the marriage of the victorious king Vikramaditya to the princess of Balhika. This Balhika is none other than the Balkh region in West Asia. It could be that Arabia was wrestled by king Vikramaditya from the ruler of Balkh who concluded a treaty by giving his daughter in marriage to the victor.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">BUT Balhika/ bahlika has nothing to do with either King Vikramaditya or Kutub Minar, it predates both. Bahlika finds mention in Atharvaveda, Mahabharata, Ramayana, Puranas, Vartikka of Katyayana, Brhatsamhita, Amarkosha etc and in the ancient Inscriptions. The inhabitants of Bahlika were known as the Bahlikas. The other variations of Bahlika are Bahli, Balhika, Vahlika, Valhika, Bahlava, Bahlam/Bahlim, Bahlayana and Bahluva etc.<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">According to the Puranic traditions, Dhrshta was one of the nine sons of Manu. From him came a number of clans called Dharshtakas who were reckoned as Kshatriyas. According to Shiva Purana the Dharshtaka princes became rulers of Bahlika.<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">Satapatha Brahmana knows of a king named Bahlika Pratipeya whom it calls Kauravya (=Kaurava) . It has been pointed out that this Kaurava king is identical with Bahlika Pratipeya of Mahabharata.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">According to Mahabharata evidence, the king of Bahlika was present at Syamantapanchaka at Kurukshetra on the occasion of a solar eclipse. Also the name &#8216;Bahlika Desa&#8217; originates from the name of the middle son of King Pratipa of Hastinapura, Bahlika, who devoted his life to conquer these old Aryan territories in the Uttarapatha. Hence, being the elder to King Santanu, Bahlika was the paternal uncle of Bhishma and pre-dates him.<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">The King of Bahlika presented to Yudhishtra a golden chariot yoked with four white Kamboja studs at the time of Rajsuya ceremony (2.53.5).<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:darkblue;font-family:Arial;font-size:13pt;">OAK says; Secondly, the township adjoining the so called Kutub Minar is named Mehrauli after Mihira who was the renowned astronomer-mathematician of king Vikram&#8217;s court. Mehrauli is the corrupt form of Sanskrit &#8216;Mihira-Awali&#8217; signifying a row of houses raised for Mihira and his helpers and assistants working on astronomical observations made from the tower.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">Mehrauli, Which was earlier known as Mihirawali means Home of Mihir, was founded by the King Mihir Bhoja of the Gurjara-Pratihara Dynasty. Mehrauli is one of the seven ancient cities that make up the present state of Delhi. The Lal Kot fort was constructed by the Gurjar Tanwar chief Anangpal I around AD 731 and expanded by AnangPal II in the 11th century, who shifted his capital to Lal Kot from Kannauj. The Gurjar Tanwars were defeated by the Chauhans in the 12th century. Prithviraj Chauhan further expanded the fort and called it Qila Rai Pithora. He was defeated in 1192 by Mohammed Ghori, who put his general Qutb-ud-din Aybak in charge and returned to Afghanistan. Mehrauli remained the capital of the Kanas dynasty which ruled until 1290. During the Khilji dynasty, the capital shifted to Siri.<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Written by Sulaiman Razvi<br />
</span></p>
[This article is incomplete, This article will be scrutinized, inshallah I will do it as soon as I get time]
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">The Holy Kaba was built by Prophet Adam A.S and was rebuilt Ibrahim A.S. It is known as Baith Allah or the House of Allah. The Kaaba is a direction for prayer. However some Islamophobes especially some Hindus allege that Muslims worship the Kaaba or the Black Stone and they accuse Muslims of being idolaters. First of all they have to know what exactly is Idol worship, only then they should accuse Muslims of Idolatry. Idol worship is a veneration or worship of the Idol of any God. Islam is known for its staunch monotheistic stand. Islam prohibits Idol worship, It is mentioned in the Qur&#8217;an,<br />
</span></p>
<p><span id="more-161"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">22:30 &#8221;…so shun the abomination of idols, and shun the word that is false.&#8221;<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">14:35 Remember Abraham said: &#8220;O my Lord! make this city one of peace and security: and <span style="text-decoration:underline;">preserve me and my sons from worshipping idols</span>.<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">5:90 O ye who believe! Intoxicants and gambling, <span style="color:red;">(dedication of) stones</span>, and (divination by) arrows, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">are an abomination― of Satan&#8217;s handiwork</span>: eschew such (abomination), that ye may prosper.<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">It is mentioned in Hadith,<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Sunan Abu Dawood (Kitab Al-Aqdiyah) [24:3592] Narrated Khuraym Ibn Fatik: The Apostle of Allah (peace be upon him) offered the morning prayer. When he finished it, he stood up and said three times: False witness has been made equivalent to attributing a partner to Allah. He then recited: &#8220;<span style="text-decoration:underline;">So avoid the abomination of idols</span> and avoid speaking falsehood as people pure of faith to Allah, not associating anything with Him.<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Muslims do not believe the Kaaba or Black Stone to be God. Kaaba is a direction,<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">&#8221;…when a person making supplication (du&#8217;a) faces the sky–just as those performing the prayer (Salat) face the Ka&#8217;bah, since the sky is the qiblah of those who supplicate, as the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Ka&#8217;bah is the qiblah of those who perform the prayer</span>…&#8221;-(Sahih Muslim bi Sharh al-Nawawi. 18 vols. Cairo 1349/1930. Reprint (18 vols. in 9). Beirut: Dar al-Fikr, 1401/1981, 5.24)<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">&#8216;<span style="text-decoration:underline;">&#8216;Allah&#8217;s direction of prayer is the Ka&#8217;bah</span>. (And if thou shouldst follow their desires) their religion and direction of prayer (after the knowledge which hath come unto thee) that the Religion of Allah is Islam and His direction of prayer is the Ka&#8217;bah&#8221;– Tanwir al Miqbas min Tafsir ibn Abbas 2:120<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">People used to stand on the Kaaba and give Azaan. Kaaba has been rebuilt several times, it was brought down by the Sahabas. Can any Hindu even think of destroying idol of their god? Ibn Az Zubayr brought Kaaba down to rebuild it and later it was again brought down and rebuilt by Ibn Hajjaj,<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">&#8221;he (Ibn Az Zubayr) decided to bring the Ka`bah down. The people hesitated to bring it down, fearing that the first person to climb on the House would be struck down. A man went on top of the House and threw some stones down, and when the people saw that no harm touched him, they started doing the same. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">They brought the House down to ground level</span>…`Abdul-Malik wrote back, `We do not agree with Ibn Az-Zubayr&#8217;s actions. As, for the Ka`bah&#8217;s height, leave it as it is. As for what he added from the Hijr, bring it down, and build the House as it was before and close the door.&#8217; <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Therefore, Al-Hajjaj brought down the House and rebuilt it as it was</span>.&#8221;- Tafsir Ibn Kathir [<a href="http://www.qtafsir.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=303&amp;Itemid=36" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Source<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>]
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Idolaters won&#8217;t stand on their idols nor they will destroy their Idols. How can such claims be made that Muslims worship the Kaaba or Black Stone when Quran and Hadiths clearly prohibit any form of Idol worship? Hazrat Umar R.A said,<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">&#8221;…No doubt, I know that you are a <strong>stone</strong> and can neither benefit anyone nor harm anyone. Had I not seen Allah&#8217;s Apostle kissing you I would not have kissed you.&#8221; Sahih Bukhari, Kitab al Hajj 26, Hadith no 667.<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Muslims do not believe the Kaaba to be God. Muslims do not worship the Kaaba. When some Hindus are told these facts they say,<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left:36pt;"><span style="color:#c00000;font-size:12pt;">&#8221;They too, whom you call Idol worshippers, do not regard the image as God. They profess to worship God behind the Idol/image&#8221;<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">How true it is, let&#8217;s analyse. Hindu scriptures clearly states that &#8216;You should establish an Idol of God and worship it for the Idol is God himself&#8217;. Whatever we or the Islamophobes says carries no weight unless it is backed by some evidence, let&#8217;s have a look at what Hindu scripture have to say about it because if they are accusing us of Idolatry then our way of worship must be similar with idol worshippers.<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Garuda Purana 12.17 Then the son should place upon the <span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;">bed a golden image, and having worshiped it</span>…<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Devi Bhagavatam 3.24.19 O sinless one! <span style="color:red;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Establish my image in this city and worship it</span><br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Devi Bhagavatam 3.13.49 These Saktis, capable of bestowing all the desires, <span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;">will be worshipped in Pratimas(images of clay, etc.)</span> in the whole of India.<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Vishnudharmottara Purana, Kanda 3, Adhyay 93, 2 in the former three ages, Krta, Treta, and Dvapara men were able to see a god directly but in the Kali age ment have lost that faculty; <span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;">therefore they have to worship them (the gods) in an image</span>.<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Devi Bhagavatam 11.23.21-33 … one is to worship one&#8217;s own Deity <span style="color:red;"><strong>in front</strong></span><br />
<span style="color:red;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">of fire or the </span><strong>image of any god</strong></span>…<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">This shows that the Idol must be in front of the worshipper.<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">BhrGhSuPari Grihasutra 2.14.2 <span style="color:red;">Having prepared the image of the god and worshipping it </span>with the unbroken rice and flowers as available&#8230;<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">&#8221;It (clay) should be washed well and pasted with scented poweder and milk. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">The idol should be made</span> with the hands on a raises platform. All the limbs, joints, etc. should be perfectly shaped with the respective weapons of the deity concerned. It should be seated on Padmasana (lotus pose) <span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;">and worshipped respectfully</span>&#8221;.-Shiva Purana 1.1.16.6-7, Tr. J.L. Shastri<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">&#8221;O my child, <span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;">one should worship the beautiful and universally auspicious idol (of Devi) </span>which is the destroyer of great demons placing it on a car (chatior)&#8221;.-Devi Purana 30.6cd-7ab, Tr. R.S. Bhattacharya<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Harivamsa Purana, Vishnu Parva 2.74.52 Those who <span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;">make my idol with stones taken from you and worship [it]</span> daily with devotion shall eventually attain my path.<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">These verses clearly commands Hindus to worship the Idol of their god, but Quran nor any Hadith tells us to worship the Kaaba. Hindu texts and Scholars say that Idol is God himself. Pratima means Idol, image, picture of god but Swami Prabhupada the founder of ISKON translates Pratima as Deity Form or Deity because he considers the Idol to be another form or incarnation of God. This fact is enough to prove that Muslims do not worship the Kaaba as Quran, Hadiths nor Muslims says Kaaba is Allah (S.W.T). Let me quote few verses from Hindu scriptures and passages written by Hindu scholars on this issue,<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">&#8221;…think of the name as Brahman, and meditate upon it, <span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;">just as people worship the idol, thinking it to be Vishnu Himself</span>.- Chandogya Upanishad Commentary by Shankarcharya on 12.1.4 ,The Upanishads and Sri Sankara&#8217;s Commentary, Volumes 4-5, p.200.<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">It is mentioned in Srimad Bhagvatam (Bhagavad Purana),<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">dravyaiḥ prasiddhair mad-yāgaḥ <span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;">pratimā</span>diṣv amāyinaḥ bhaktasya ca yathā-labdhair hṛdi bhāvena caiva hi<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Bhagavat Purana (Srimad Bhagvatam) 11.27.15 <span style="color:red;">One should worship Me in My Deity forms [Pratima/Idol]</span> by offering the most excellent paraphernalia. But a devotee completely freed from material desire may worship Me with whatever he is able to obtain…</span><span style="font-size:14pt;"><br />
</span></p>

<p><a href="http://vedabase.com/en/sb/11/27/12" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-size:12pt;">Bhagavat Purana</span><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a><span style="font-size:12pt;"> (Srimad Bhagavatam) 11.27.12 <span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;">The Deity form[Idol] of the Lord is said to appear in eight varieties</span> — stone, wood, metal, earth, paint, sand, the mind or jewels.<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;"><strong>Swami Prabhupada states</strong>: Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī explains that certain Deity forms, such as those made of sand, are manifested for a brief time to fulfill a personal desire of the worshiper. Those, however, <span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;">who desire to attain pure love of God should worship the permanent form of the Deity (made, for instance, of marble, gold or brass)</span>, and they should maintain continual worship. In Kṛṣṇa consciousness there is no scope for neglecting the worship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Bhagwat Purana (Srimad Bhagavatam) 11.27.48 <span style="color:red;">Whenever one develops faith in Me in <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>My form [Idol] as the Deity</strong></span> or in other bona fide manifestations one should <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>worship Me in that form</strong></span></span>. I certainly exist both within all created beings and also separately in My original form, since I am the Supreme Soul of all.<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;"><strong>Swami Prabhupada states</strong>: The Supreme Personality of Godhead is worshiped according to the faith of a particular worshiper. The Deity form, arcā, is specifically mentioned here because Deity worship is essential for spiritual progress. <span style="color:red;">Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura mentions that inexperienced persons may think that the Deity [Idol] is meant for the sense gratification of the worshiper, since superficially the Deity [Idol] is made of external substances such as marble or brass</span>. But through the process of installing the Deity by <span style="color:red;"><strong>chanting of authorized mantras, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">one invites the Supreme Personality of Godhead to enter the Deity form [Idol]</span>.</strong></span> By regulated, faithful worship one gradually <span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;"><strong>understands that the Deity [Idol] is completely nondifferent from the Supreme Lord Himself</strong></span>…<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">&#8221;But, greater is the difficulty of those whose minds cling to the Unmanifested; for the goal of the Unmanifested is hard for the embodied being to reach.&#8221; Gita 12:5<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Swami Prabhupada writes on this verse &#8221;Therefore, the bhakti-yogi accepts the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Deity of Krishna as worshipable</span> because there is some bodily conception fixed in the mind, which can thus be applied. <span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;">Of course, worship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His form within the temple is not idol worship</span>. There is evidence in the Vedic literature that worship may be saguna and nirguna—of the Supreme possessing or not possessing attributes. Worship of the Deity in the temple is saguna worship, <span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;">for the Lord is represented by material qualities</span>. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">But the form of the Lord, though represented by material qualities such as <span style="color:red;">stone, wood or oil paint, is not actually material. That is the absolute nature of the Supreme Lord</span></span>…God has an authorized <span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;">representation in the Deity form [Idol]</span>, which is called arca-vigraha. This arca-vigraha is an incarnation of the Supreme Lord&#8221;.<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Swami Prabhupada on Bhagwad Purana (Srimad Bhagavatam) 4.30.27:<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;">The form of the Lord as worshiped in the temples is called arca-vigraha or arcavatara, the worshipable form [Idol Worship],</span><br />
<span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;">the Deity incarnation</span>. This facility is offered to neophyte devotees so that they can see the real form of the Lord face to face and offer their respectful obeisances and sacrifices in the form of arca. Through such facilities the neophytes gradually invoke their original Krsna consciousness. <span style="color:red;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Deity worship in the form of temple worship is the most valuable benediction </span><strong>given by the Lord to beginners</strong></span>. All neophytes must therefore engage in the worship of the Lord by keeping the arca-vigraha (arcavatara)[Idol] at home or in the temple.<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Another Hindu scholar named Swami Sivananda writes,<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">&#8221;<span style="color:red;">Though the image is worshipped</span>, <span style="color:red;">the devotee feels the presence of the Lord <span style="text-decoration:underline;">in it</span></span> and pours out his devotion unto it.…<span style="color:red;">When you worship an image</span>, you do not say: &#8220;This image has come from Jaipur. It was brought by Prabhu Singh. Its weight is 50 lbs. It is made of white marble. It has cost me Rs. 500/-.&#8221; <span style="color:red;"><strong>You superimpose all the attributes of the Lord on the image and pray</strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">: &#8220;</span><strong>O</strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Antaryamin (Inner Ruler)! </span><strong>You are</strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;"> all-pervading. You are omnipotent, omniscient, all-merciful. You are the source for everything. You are self-existent. You are Sat-Chit-Ananda. </span><strong>You</strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;"> are eternal, unchanging. You are the Life of my life, Soul of my soul! Give me light and knowledge! Let me dwell in Thee for ever.&#8221;</span></span> When your devotion and meditation become intense and deep, you do not see the stone image. You behold the Lord only who is Chaitanya. <span style="color:red;">Image-worship is very necessary for beginners</span>…For a beginner, Pratima is an absolute necessity. <span style="color:red;"><strong>By worshipping an idol</strong>, Isvara is pleased</span>…<span style="color:red;">Even so, the Lord is highly pleased when a small portion of His Virat (cosmic) body is worshipped. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">An idol is a part of the body of the Lord</span></span>. The whole world is His body, Virat form. The devotion goes to the Lord<span style="color:red;">. The worshipper superimposes on the image the Lord and all His attributes</span>. He does Shodasopachara for the idol, the sixteen kinds of paying respects or service to the Lord…<span style="color:red;"><strong>The idol speaks. It will answer your questions and solve your problems</strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">. The God in you has the power to awaken the latent </span><strong>Divinity in the idol</strong></span>…<span style="color:red;"><strong>The awakened Divinity in the idol</strong></span><br />
<span style="color:red;">acts as a guardian angel blessing all, conferring the highest good on those who bow to it…</span><br />
<span style="color:red;">The image in the temple at Tirupati assumed human form and gave witness in the court to help His devotees</span>.- All About Hinduism, By Sri Swami Sivananda, p.70-4<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">&#8221;To the worshipper <span style="text-decoration:underline;">who believes the symbol, any kind of image is the body of the Lord under the form of stone, clay, brass, picture, Saligrama, etc. Such worship can never be idolatry</span>. <span style="color:red;">All matter is a manifestation of God. God is present in everything which exists</span>. Everything is an object of worship, for all is a manifestation of God who is therein worshipped.&#8221; – All About Hinduism, By Swami Sivananda, p.72<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Muslims do not believe the Kaaba to be Allah nor do we adore the Kaaba as the Hindus does to their Idols thinking it to be god himself,<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;"> Bhagavat Purana (Srimad Bhagvatam) 11:30:7 There we should bathe for purification, fast, and fix our minds in meditation. <span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;">We should then worship the demigods by bathing their images</span>, anointing them with sandalwood pulp, and presenting them various offerings<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">So it is evident from all these verses that the Idolaters indeed think their Idols to be God. Another bogus claim made by some Hindus is that Kaaba was actually a Hindu temple and the Black Stone is actually Shiva Lingam. There is nothing to refute as there is no evidence which proves their point. There is absolutely no evidence at all. This hoax was started by a self-proclaimed historian (popularly known as Mythistorian by experts) who believed that all religious monuments and religions are corrupted form of Hinduism and that Christianity is altered version of Kishna Neti and Islam is the altered version of the Sanskrit word Ishalayam. He gave fake reference from an imaginary book created by him. Surprisingly Hindus believes this book exis and even quote, well, Islam is such a beautiful religion that anyone would like to link their religion with it. The Mythistorian&#8217;s work is full of mistakes and does not contain a single fact. He was ignorant of history. He made such poor remarks on other religions, for example he claimed that the Muslim&#8217;s Namaz is originally a Sanskrit word called Namah. I wonder whether he did some research or just wrote his frustrations. The Arabic word for prayer is Salah. Namaz is an Urdu word originated from Farsi, the word Namaz is used by Muslims of Indian subcontinent for prayer. He and his claims have been refuted by Imran Khan in his Blog <a href="http://kaabaisnotahindutemple.blogspot.in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Kaba Is Not a Hindu Temple<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. Readers can go through the blog and see the idiotic claims made by Hindu nationalist. Shri Shri Ravi Shankar had also made such claims but later in a debate with Dr. Zakir Naik he honestly acknowledged that his claims are incorrect. There is no evidence at all that could suggest the Kaaba was a Hindu temple. There is also no preserved history which could suggest that Hindus lived in Makka or went there. Even a Muslim can make such claims. For example,<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">&#8221;Hindu God Ram was a normal Muslim, his name is altered version of the Arabic word Akram. His brother Luxman was also a Muslim his original name was Luqman, and his close disciple was Humam Bajar Ali which was changed to Hanuman Bajrang Bali. The Hindu God Krishna was also a Muslim his real name was Karim Shah. Shiva was also a Muslim his original name was Shuaa&#8221;. </span></p>
<p>So does it make them Muslims?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Another bogus claim made by Hindus is that the Black Stone is Shiva Lingam. How can this be so when both these have different meanings and their own origin. The meaning and origin of Shiva Lingam is discussed briefly in the article <a href="/index.php/2014/05/15/analysis-of-lingam/" data-wpel-link="internal">An Analysis of Lingam</a>. As far as Black Stone is concerned. The Arabic word is Hajre Aswad. Hajr means stone, Aswad means black. While Lingam means make erected organ and Yoni denotes female genital organ. According to the tradition, the Hajre Aswad (Black Stone) was white and was sent from heaven,<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Sunan Al Tirmizi Sayyidina Book of Hajj 9, Hadith 878 &#8221;Ibn Abbas narrated that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (SAW) said, &#8220;The <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Black Stone was sent down from Paradise</span> and it was more <span style="text-decoration:underline;">white than milk</span>, but the sins of the children of Adam turned it black.&#8221;<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Hindus try to link Yoni (Literally female genital which is the base of Shivling) with the silver frame of Hajre Aswad. They are not aware of the fact that the silver frame was not present during the time of Prophet Muhammad (P.B.U.H). When the Black Stone was broken into pieces during a war, Its fragments were cemented into a silver frame by Abd Allah Ibn Zubayr. The Black Stone is from Heaven (Tirmizi 878) whereas Yoni (Female genital or Shivling&#8217;s base) worship was initiated after the curse. There are two stories concerning its origin. First one is when the Sage Bhrigu was dishonoured by Shiva as Shiva was busy with his wife Parvati so Bhrigu cursed him to be worshipped in Linga and Yoni form which he desired the most, another story is that Shiva was cursed by the sages to be worshipped in Penis form for seducing their wives, Shiva&#8217;s male organ fell down to earth and burned everything, Shiva told Brahma and Vishnu that it will become calm only when Parvati takes hold of it in Yoni (female genital) form. For more information, read the article <a href="/index.php/2014/05/15/analysis-of-lingam/" data-wpel-link="internal">Analysis of Lingam</a>. So how can some people claim Black Stone is Hindu Idol when both these have their own origin and definition? Some Hindu brothers are easily deceived by Islamophobes. One should not blindly follow what the person is saying. It is incorrect to liken Shivling with Black Stone because ShivLingam is risen out from the Vulva shaped base known as Yoni whereas Black Stone is not and Shiva Lingam is not cemented into the walls of temple like the Black Stone. There is no evidence of Lingam worship in Arabia nor there is a mention of such Idol. I request the readers to read the Blog <a href="http://kaabaisnotahindutemple.blogspot.in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Kaba is Not a Hindu Temple<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> as I don&#8217;t want to add any repetitive refutations.<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:13pt;text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Conclusion</strong></span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><strong>:-</strong> It is inappropriate to say that Muslims worship the Kaba or Black stone since Idol worship means worshipping the Idol thinking it to be God himself. Kaba is only a direction for worship. Quran nor the Hadith tell us to worship the Kaaba, Islam strictly prohibits idol worship.<br />
