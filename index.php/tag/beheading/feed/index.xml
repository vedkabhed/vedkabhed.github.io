										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Written by Ibn Muhammad</p>
<p>Islam is being severely attacked, bashed, mocked by a certain dedicated team in cyberspace. A large number of these ‘Islam Haters’ happen to be Hindu fanatics. Obviously, their sole agenda is to create aversion in the minds of common people against Islam. Their full time job is to prove that the Islam promotes violence and terrorism. Some of these people are zealous evangelists of Vedas and claim that Vedas are the only books promoting peace. They claim that once everyone accepts the Vedas, peace and prosperity would been seen everywhere. How true is this claim? For those of you who have been conditioned to believe that Vedas promote peace, this article might change your perception of the Vedic Dharma.</p>
<p>According to Hindus, in Satyug, people were pious and upright, who did not know fighting. The use of lethal weapons was unknown. It was like Heaven on Earth. Hindus also tell us that Vedas are from the beginning of the world. Combining these two beliefs, it follows that Vedas must have nothing corcerning warfare, killing, plunder, etc. However, if Vedas do speak about warfare and killing, there are two only two choices for Hindus; accept that Vedas are not from the beginning of the world, but were written much later or accept that Vedas introduced killing and warfare in the world.</p>
<p><span id="more-850"></span></p>
<p><strong>The Warrior Gods of Vedas</strong></p>
<p>The Vedic gods are always depicted as being busy in war and destroying the enemies. Let us see god Indra</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="651" height="290" class="wp-image-7337" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-i1-wp-com-www-islamhinduism-com-images-sto.gif" alt="https://i1.wp.com/www.islamhinduism.com/images/stories/rig_10_48_6to7.gif" /></p>
<p><strong>“These, breathing loud in fury, two and two, who caused Indra to bring his bolt of thunder to the fray, The challengers, I struck with deadly weapon down: firm stand what words the God speaks to his worshippers. This One by stronger might I conquered singly; yea, also two: shall three prevail against me? Like many sheaves upon the floor I thrash them. How can my foes, the Indraless, revile me?” [Rigveda 10:48:6-7]</strong></p>
<p>Indra Ji cannot tolerate anyone opposing him and whoever is guilty of opposing him will be crushed like sawdust.</p>
<p>Indra Ji was invoked by the Aryans to loot the cows of non Aryan tribes and Indra Ji did not disappoint the Aryans. In Vedic times, there lived an untouchable people in a village named Kikat, in todays Bihar. The used to rear cattle. Obviously to the Aryans this was a crime. So they invoked their god Indra to wage war against them and loot their cows.</p>
<p><strong>“O Indra, what do the cows make for you among the Kikatas. They neither yield milk for your offerings, nor do they warm the vessel of libation. Bring to us these cows, bring to us also the wealth of Pramagand (their King). O Brave one, grant us the possessions of the people of low status.” [Rigveda 3:53:14]</strong></p>
<p>On the basis of this clear pronouncement, non-Aryans and untouchables have no right to keep cows. Aryans and Brahmins whenever they wish can kill them and appropriate their possessions. Hindu culture thus becomes the culture of the progress, civilization and welfare of the Aryan people alone.</p>
<p>Indra Ji is very ruthless against his opponents. He can go to any extent to ruin them, even kidnapping women. Rigveda 5:30:7-9 mentions the following</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="671" height="405" class="wp-image-7338" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-i0-wp-com-www-islamhinduism-com-images-sto.gif" alt="https://i0.wp.com/www.islamhinduism.com/images/stories/rig_5_30_8.gif" /></p>
<p><strong>7 Thou, Maghavan, from the first didst scatter foemen, speeding, while joying in the milk, the Giver. There, seeking man’s prosperity, thou torest away the head of Namuci the Dasa.</strong></p>
<p><strong>8 Pounding the head of Namuci the Dasa, me, too thou madest thine associate, Indra! Yea, and the rolling stone that is in heaven both worlds, as on a car, brought to the Maruts.</strong></p>
<p><strong>9 Women for weapons hath the Dasa taken, What injury can his feeble armies To me? Well he distinguished his two different voices, and Indra then advanced to fight the Dasyu.</strong></p>
<p>Indra Ji is given many epithets like <em>Vajradhaari, vṛtrahan, Dasyuhan, </em>etc. How can peace prevail in the world when these kinds of prejudiced teachings are there in the Vedas?</p>
<p>Vedic wars were mainly fought to gain cattle and other booty, as is clearly mentioned in Rigveda 6:26:1-2</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="643" height="280" class="wp-image-7339" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-i0-wp-com-www-islamhinduism-com-images-sto-1.gif" alt="https://i0.wp.com/www.islamhinduism.com/images/stories/rig_6_26_1.gif" /></p>
<p><strong>1. O INDRA, hear us. Raining down the Soma, we call on thee to win us mighty valour. Give us strong succour on the day of trial, when the tribes gather on the field of battle.</strong></p>
<p><strong>2 The warrior, son of warrior sire, invokes thee, to gain great strength that may be won as booty: To thee, the brave man’s Lord, the fiends’ subduer, he looks when fighting hand to hand for cattle.</strong></p>
<p>Like Indra, other deities are also of a warrior mentality. Again and again prayers are made to them to obtain the wealth of the enemies and conquer their territories.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Inhumane Principles of Vedic Warfare with special reference to Arya Samaj</strong></p>
<p>Now see the extreme sadist mentality of Vedic followers, who fought wars to gain cows and wealth. Their are specific prayers in the Vedas about conquering the foes and gaining their wealth. The conquered people were later humiliated in the most abusive ways. For example, Rigveda 10:166 says,</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="649" height="629" class="wp-image-7340" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-i1-wp-com-www-islamhinduism-com-images-sto-1.gif" alt="https://i1.wp.com/www.islamhinduism.com/images/stories/rig_10_166.gif" /></p>
<p><strong>“1. MAKE me a bull among my peers, make me my rivals, conqueror: Make me the slayer of my foes, a sovran ruler, lord of kine</strong></p>
<p><strong>2 I am my rivals’ slayer, like Indra unwounded and unhurt, And all these enemies of mine are vanquished and beneath my feet.</strong></p>
<p><strong>3 Here, verily, I bind you fast, as the two bow-ends with the string. Press down these men, O Lord of Speech, that they may humbly speak to me.</strong></p>
<p><strong>4 Hither I came as conqueror with mighty all-effecting power, And I have mastered all your thought, your synod, and your holy work.</strong></p>
<p><strong>5 May I be highest, having gained your strength in war, your skill in peace my feet have trodden on your heads. Speak to me from beneath my feet, as frogs from out the water croak, as frogs from out the water croak.”</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>BURN THE ENEMIES ALIVE<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Yajurveda Chapter 13; Mantra 12 says</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="523" height="273" class="wp-image-7341" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-i2-wp-com-www-islamhinduism-com-images-sto.gif" alt="https://i2.wp.com/www.islamhinduism.com/images/stories/yajur_13_12.gif" /></p>
<p><strong>“O King, make progress in thy duty of administration, extend happiness to the religious. O terrible chastiser, burn down the irreligious foes. O splendid person, humiliate and consume utterly like dried up stubble, him, who encourages our foe.”</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>BURN THE KITCHENS/KITCHEN GARDENS OF THE ENEMIES<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Yajurveda Chapter 13; Mantra 13 says</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="516" height="325" class="wp-image-7342" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-i1-wp-com-www-islamhinduism-com-images-sto-2.gif" alt="https://i1.wp.com/www.islamhinduism.com/images/stories/yajur_13_13.gif" /></p>
<p><strong>“O King, rise high, punish the wicked foes righteously, manifest the objects prepared by our steady scholars, enhance pleasures. Destroy the kitchens and other places of plundering of the vigorous enemies. Kill the foes. I settle you with fire’s ardour.”</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>PUT YOUR ENEMIES IN THE JAWS OF FEROCIOUS ANIMALS<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Yajurveda Chapter 15; Mantra 15 says</p>
<p><strong>“…Let injurious animals like Lions and others that eat fresh and grass be destroyed.  Let murderous crowds of men that destroy others like a powerful weapon, be killed.  Let virtuous rulers protect us from those animals, and make us comfortable.  In the jaws of these animals we place the ferocious man whom we hate and who hates us.“</strong></p>
<p>I am sure that our society will not allow Vedic followers to kill the Lions. A person who has common sense, will never accept this unscientific teaching.  Lions by nature, eat flesh.  This verse wants to make them herbivorous. If this teaching is implemented, Lions will become extinct.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>WHO ARE THE ENEMIES?<br />
</strong></p>
<p>But there is still one thing unclear. Who are the enemies whose inhumane killing is being encouraged in the above mantras? Well, let the Vedas answer for themselves.</p>
<p>Atharvaved 12:5:62 says,</p>
<p><strong>“Rend, rend to bits, rend through and through, scorch and consume and burn to dust, the one who rejects the Vedas.”</strong></p>
<p>I do not think the above verse leaves any ambiguity as to who the enemies mentioned in the Vedas are. The mantra speaks for itself. It also prescribes the most gruesome forms of slaughter of those who disbelieve in the Vedas.</p>
<p>The same Sookt (hymn) also commands the following in mantras 65-71,</p>
<p><strong>65) So, O Goddess, do thou from him, the Brāhmans’ tyrant,  criminal, niggard, blasphemer of the Gods,  66) With hundred-knotted thunderbolt, sharpened and edged with razor-blades, 67)Strike off the shoulders and the head. 68) Snatch thou the hair from off his head, and from his body strip the skin: 69) Tear out his sinews, cause his flesh to fall in pieces from his frame. 70) Crush thou his bones together, strike and beat the marrow out of him. 71) Dislocate all his limbs and joints.</strong></p>
<p>I wonder what type of mindset would have written this horrendous stuff? This extreme sadist mentality which relishes in instructing such horrible torture deserves to be banned forever before it is put to practice.  One can imagine what would have happened at the time when such teachings would have been enforced thousands of years back. These teachings were recently put into effect when innocent Muslims were burnt alive and tortured in the Indian State of Gujrat, Christians were burnt alive in many places of India especially in Orrisa. Jains and Buddhists in ancient times and Muslims, Christians and Sikhs in recent times have been made the experimental mice of these teachings.</p>
<p>Also supportig the idea that the enemies mentioned in the Vedas in fact refer to people of other religions, we have the following prayer made in Atharvaved 20:93:1.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="537" height="255" class="wp-image-7343" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-i1-wp-com-www-islamhinduism-com-images-sto-3.gif" alt="https://i1.wp.com/www.islamhinduism.com/images/stories/atharva_20_93_1.gif" /></p>
<p><strong>May our hymns give you great delight. Display your bounty, Thunderer. Drive off the enemies of the Vedas.”</strong></p>
<p>The next mantra mentions</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="477" height="216" class="wp-image-7344" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-i2-wp-com-www-islamhinduism-com-images-sto-1.gif" alt="https://i2.wp.com/www.islamhinduism.com/images/stories/atharva_20_93_2.gif" /></p>
<p><strong>“Crush with your foot the niggard churls who bring no gifts. Mighty are you: There is not one to equal you.”</strong></p>
<p>The above mantras also make the identity of the enemy clear. The enemies are those who do not pray to the Vedic gods and bring them no gifts. The same is mentioned in Rigveda 8:53:1-2.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>PLUNDER THE ENEMIES WEALTH<br />
</strong></p>
<p>As has been said before that Vedic wars were motivated to a great extent by capturing more wealth, I will now provide even more evidence for this.</p>
<p><strong>“Handless be these our enemies! We enervate their languid limbs. So let us part among ourselves, in hundreds, Indra! all their wealth.” [Atharvaved 6:66:3]</strong></p>
<p>Rigveda 1:7:4 mentions,</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="473" height="298" class="wp-image-7345" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-i2-wp-com-www-islamhinduism-com-images-sto-2.gif" alt="https://i2.wp.com/www.islamhinduism.com/images/stories/rig_1_7_4.gif" /></p>
<p><strong>“Help us, O Indra, in the frays, yea, frays, where thousand spoils are gained, With awful aids, O awful One.”</strong></p>
<p>In Rigveda 10:84:2 it is said,</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="475" height="315" class="wp-image-7346" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-i2-wp-com-www-islamhinduism-com-images-sto-3.gif" alt="https://i2.wp.com/www.islamhinduism.com/images/stories/rig_10_84_2.gif" /></p>
<p><strong>Flashing like fire, be thou, O conquering Manyu, invoked, O Victor, as our army’s leader. Slay thou our foes, distribute their possessions: show forth thy vigour, scatter those who hate us.</strong></p>
<p>At many places such prayers are made to destroy the enemies and gain their wealth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>BOOTY OF WAR<br />
</strong></p>
<p>What constitutes the booty of war in the Vedic religion? Maharishi Manu describes the war booty on the basis of the Vedas.</p>
<p><strong>“Chariots and horses, elephants, parasols, money, grain, cattle, women, all sorts of (marketable) goods and valueless metals belong to him who takes them (singly) conquering (the possessor).”</strong></p>
<p><strong>“A text of the Veda (declares) that (the soldiers) shall present a choice portion (of this booty) to the king; what has not been taken singly, must be distributed by the king among all the soldiers.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Manu Smriti 7:96-97]</strong></p>
<p>Women also are considered part of the war booty in the above passages and are to be divided like other objects.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>No Universal Brotherhood in the Vedas<br />
</strong></p>
<p>The texts of the Vedas and other Hindu scriptures clearly show that they do not regard non-Aryans races as brothers, nor did they wish any good to the non-worshippers of the Aryan gods. They only wished their extirpation and their annihilation. Out of a large number of passages bearing on this subject, I quote the following:</p>
<p><strong>“He who dwells fixed in the atmosphere, smiting the blasphemers of the god that do not sacrifice, to him be reverence with ten sakvarî-stanzas!” [Atharvaved 11:2:23]</strong></p>
<p>The texts of the Vedas seem to leave no doubt that they recognize a distinction between the tribe to which the authors of the hymns belonged and a hostile people who observed different rites, and were regarded with contempt and hatred by the superior race. Their is no doubt that in many passages of the Rigveda the words <em>Dasa </em>and <em>Dasyu</em> are applied to the aboriginal tribes of India. Let us see what Maharishi Manu says,</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="372" height="59" class="wp-image-7347" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-i2-wp-com-www-islamhinduism-com-images-sto-4.gif" alt="https://i2.wp.com/www.islamhinduism.com/images/stories/manu_10_45.gif" /></p>
<p><strong>“All those tribes in this world, which are excluded from (the community of) those born from the mouth, the arms, the thighs, and the feet (of Brahman), are called Dasyus, whether they speak the language of the Mlecchas or that of the Aryans. [Manu 10:45]</strong></p>
<p>The distinction between Aryas and Dasyus is not on the basis of character but on the basis nationality as is clearly demarcated by Manu Smriti 2:21-23.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="363" height="175" class="wp-image-7348" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-i1-wp-com-www-islamhinduism-com-images-sto-4.gif" alt="https://i1.wp.com/www.islamhinduism.com/images/stories/manu_2_21-23.gif" /></p>
<p><strong>“21. That (country) which (lies) between the Himavat and the Vindhya (mountains) to the east of Prayaga and to the west of Vinasana (the place where the river Sarasvati disappears) is called Madhyadesa (the central region).</strong></p>
<p><strong>22. But (the tract) between those two mountains (just mentioned), which (extends) as far as the eastern and the western oceans, the wise call Aryavarta (the country of the Aryans).</strong></p>
<p><strong>23. That land where the black antelope naturally roams, one must know to be fit for the performance of sacrifices; (the tract) different from that (is) the country of the Mlecchas (barbarians).”</strong></p>
<p>Only Aryavarta aka India is the place where noble people are found and the rest of the world is filled with evil people. Thus as per the Vedic worldview, Aryas as called Aryas (Noble) because they belong to the Aryavarta and Mlecchas and Dasyus are called so not because they are evil but because they are foreigners.</p>
<p>So, Vedas give the following solution to deal with the Dasyus who do not share the faith of the Aryas.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="619" height="113" class="wp-image-7349" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-i2-wp-com-www-islamhinduism-com-images-sto-5.gif" alt="https://i2.wp.com/www.islamhinduism.com/images/stories/rig_1_176_4.gif" /></p>
<p><strong>“Slay everyone who pours no gift, who, hard to reach, delights thee not. Bestow on us what wealth he hath: this even the worshipper awaits.” [Rigveda 1:176:4]</strong></p>
<p>What language could be stronger against one’s enemies than this?  This is sheer bigotry. The quotations already made sufficiently illustrate the hatred of the Aryans for the other religions. For more of this bigotry you can see Rigveda 8:2:18, 8:45:23, 8:51:12, 8:53:1,2.</p>
<p>As far as we have seen, there is no trace to be found in the hymns of the Vedas about the brotherhood of man.  On the other hand, there is abundant evidence of an intense hostility cherished towards the non Aryan tribes.</p>
<p>There was also not the very best of feelings even among the Rishis towards one another. There are unmistakable references in the hymns to a deadly feud between Rishi Vashishtha and Rishi Vishvamitra and of a curse laid on the former by the latter. The details of these feuds will be dealt with in another article.</p>
<p>This article is an attempt to refute the Vedic propagandists who are so eager to malign Islam and yet choose to turn a blind eye to their own scriptures. I can only remind them of this wise saying of Jesus Christ (peace be upon him),</p>
<p><strong>“Judge not, that you be not judged. For with the judgment you pronounce you will be judged, and with the measure you use it will be measured to you.  Why do you see the speck that is in your brother’s eye, but do not notice the log that is in your own eye? ” [Mark 7:1]</strong></p>

<p>Some fanatic Hindus who are unaware of the violent passages in their book often mock other religious texts by misinterpreting them. They have no idea how violent Vedas are. Vedas are terror manual which turns humans into savages. Many tribes were destroyed as a result of the violent passages in Vedas. As per Vedas, you must kill a person who rejects Vedas, who hates Vedas and Ishwar, who does not worship, who does not make offerings to ishwar, who insults god (Blasphemy), one who oppresses a Brahmin etc. There are several passages in Vedas which calls for death of disbelievers. I am mostly using Arya Samaji translations of Satya Prakash Saraswati, Satyakam Vidyalankar, Devi Chand, Vaidyanath Shastri, Kshemkarand Das Trivedi, Swami Dayanand Saraswati, Shripad Damodar Satvalekar, and orthodox translations of Swami Karpatri and Shri Ram Sharma Acharya (Gayatri Parivar) and I will be using Griffith’s translation as well followed by Hindi translation of Hindu scholars. In the Vedas you will find numerous words to denote non-Hindus such as Adeva, Adevayu which means Godless, anindra which means against Indra, Ayajyu, Ayajvan which means unsacrifcing, Abrahman, Anyavrata which means followers of other gods, apavrata, avrata which means riteless, devanid which means haters of gods, Brahmadvish which means haters of devotion and those who denounce Vedas.</p>

<p><strong>ALL NON HINDUS ARE DEMONS, BARBARIANS.</strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="417" height="523" class="wp-image-7296" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/https-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2014-05-tole.jpeg" alt="https://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/tolerance-hinduism-buddhism-jainism-zoroastrianism-false-religions-untitld.jpg?w=417&amp;h=523" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/https-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2014-05-tole.jpeg 417w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/07/https-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2014-05-tole-239x300.jpeg 239w" sizes="(max-width: 417px) 100vw, 417px" /></p>
<p>The reason it is important to know who are Demons in Hinduism is because Hindu apologists find no problem with violent verses in the Veda because it says to kill ‘Demon’, they just say that these verses are referring to Demons and not to non-Hindus and try to get rid of the argument. As I said earlier Hindu apologists usually takes violent verses in lighter vein because it says to kill demons. Vedas are said to be eternal, now the question is if those verses were applicable only to Demons then it means that those verses have become useless now. So why God revealed such verses for limited period of time in the eternal book?</p>
<p>Swami Dayanand Saraswati wrote,”The Dwijaas( the twice-born) – Braahmanaas, Kshatriyas, Vaishyaas are called Aryas, while the Shudras are called Anaryas, or Non-Aryas.”ATHARVA VEDA 19:62. In the face ofthese Vedic authorities how can sensible people believe in the imaginary tales of the foreigners. In the Devaasurawars, Prince Arjuna and King Dashrathaand others of Aryavarta used to go to the assistance of the Aryas in order to crush the Asuras. This shows that the people living outside Aryavarta were called Dasyus and Malechhaas… Besides, Manu also corroborates our position. He says, “The countries other than Aryavarta are called Dasyus and Malechha countries.” MANU 10:45, 2:23. The people living in the north-east, north, north-west were called Rakshasas.” Satyarth Prakash, by Dayanand Saraswati, Ch 8, page 266, Tr. Chrinajiva Bhardwaja</p>
<p>Dasyu and Rakshasa mean demon. Here Swami Dayanand quoting Manu Smriti says that all people living outside Aryavrata and those who do not belong to four castes are demons (Rakshasa, Dasyu) and barbarians (Mleccha). According to Hindu Dharma all the non Hindus are demons and barbarians. Here is the full translation of Manu Smriti,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 10.45 All those tribes in this world, which are excluded from (the community of) those born from the mouth, the arms, the thighs, and the feet (of Brahman), are called Dasyus, whether they speak the language of the Mlekkhas (barbarians) or that of the Aryans.</p>
<p>Now some say that this doesn’t refer to Non-Hindus but to caste Hindus who lost their status on account of their neglecting their religious rites which lead them to loss of caste. They aren’t convinced even after providing explanation by their own scholar. Maybe they didn’t read verse 43 of this chapter 10 which says that by neglecting sacrifices the Dvijas made their successive generation fell to the status of Shudra not Dasyu. If Brahmins, Kshatriya, Vaishya and Shudra losing their caste made them Dasyu, the question is why they aren’t regarded as outcaste but as Dasyu? Because verse 43 and 45 aren’t correlated. Verse 45 is plain and clear that those tribe outside the pale of four Varnas are Dasyu and non-Hindus aren’t included in the four castes. Manu Smriti 10.45 also refutes the claim of apologists who claim that Dasyu means non-Human beings since Manu 10.45 states that Dasyu can be from four castes also who has abandoned their Vedic religion (if we go by the explanation of apologists) since they claim that Dasyu refers to demons only. Hindu scriptures from Veda to Purana mentions demon, so where are all those demons now? Dayanand Saraswati wrote,</p>
<p>“You can still see that the description of Raakshasas given therein tallies with the ugly appearance of the negroes of today.” <strong>Satyarth Prakash, by Dayanand Saraswati, Ch 8, page 266, Tr. Chrinajiva Bhardwaja</strong></p>
<p>So he is comparing Rakshasa with present day Negroes (black people) we can ascertain from this line that people living in north east and north west were not really monsters but were native people who are described in such racist manner. Swami Prabhupada also wrote,</p>
<p>Swami Prabhupada writes: “…An atheist is called a demon, and it is a fact that even a person born of good parents can turn into a demon by bad association…” <strong>Swami Prabhupada on Srimad Bhagavatam 3.3.6</strong><br />
<a href="http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_3.3.6" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_3.3.6<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>An Indologist wrote about Dasyu,</p>
<p>“The picture of the dasyu that emerges from these passages is quite different from that of the raksas. There is nothing about taking the form of a bird and flying by night, no mention of disrupting sacrifices, and no connection with black magic. The dasyus seem to be human beings of a different race from the Aryans and of a different (adevic and abrahamanic) religion. The mention of the proper names of various dasyus who are defeated for (or by) certain Aryan princes (e.g. Dabhiti) also makes the dasyu sound more like historical figures. There are occasional mentions of taking land from the dasyus (RV 4.38.1). The mention of dasyus in connection with fortresses (pur-) is also a characteristic which is in contrast to the raksases. Raksases do not build fortresses and fight from them. It seems quite safe to agree with the general conclusion of Vedic scholars that dasyu refers to the indigenous people of the land whom the invading Aryans conquered or absorbed.” <strong>by Wash Edward Hale, p.154, Asura in Early Vedic Religion, Published by Motilal Banarsidass Publisher, 1986.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moreover the Aryans were engaged in battle against the Dasyus and the reason given is Dasyus sings no [Vedic] hymns; Dasyus are riteless, Dasyus have alien laws; Dasyus differs from rites and rituals and doesn’t observe fire sacrifices; Dasyus are faithless, niggars, without belief, sacrifice and worship. The main reason given to fight them is that Dasyus do not offer any gifts to Vedic deities and Indra was often invoked to wage a war against the Dasyu. Refer my article <a href="/index.php/2019/03/20/violence-in-hinduism/" data-wpel-link="internal">Killing infidels in Hinduism</a> for references. Dasa and Dasyu has been synonymously used in the Vedas. The Persian word <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dahae" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Dahae<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> maybe related to the Dasyu tribe mentioned in the Vedas. “The Dahae were a Scythian people of ancient Central Asia. A confederation of three tribes – the Parni, Xanthii and Pissuri – the Dahae lived in an area now comprising much of modern Turkmenistan. The area has consequently been known as Dahestan, Dahistan and Dihistan” [end quote]. The word Parni is also believed to be the Iranian word for Panis tribe. The Panis and Dasyu may be have been closely related to each other that’s the reason they are mentioned together in Rig Veda 7.6.3; 5.34.6. Many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dasa" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Indologists<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> have also opined that Dasa were a tribe of humans not demons. Apologist pathetic response would be that Dasyu in the Veda are described as having numerous eyes and hands which is a proof that they were demons. Even Rishis who are said to be humans are described in some texts as of having three heads, Vedic deities as of having face of horse, animal getting pregnant after drinking semen of Rishis, does that prove that Rishis and Vedic deities were also demons? Hindus have a long history of using epithets against other religions, the Aryans used to consider Dasyu as Anasa which literally translates to noseless but it actually means flat nosed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now let’s move on to Panis tribe. Panis too are described as Demons, but Yaska in Nirukta also calls them Merchant (Nirukta 2.17). Panis tribe were rich traders and they were consistently attacked by Aryans to plunder them since they did not patronize the priests who then invoked Vedic gods to attack Panis. Apologists gives lame excuse, when defending verses about killing and plundering Panis tribe, all that they say is Panis were demons and doesn’t explain the part where Aryans plundered them and were the first to fight the Panis tribe. If they were demons then why Aryans were so eager to get their donations? Veda reiterates that Panis brings no gifts to Vedic deities, so why crave for their wealth if they were so demonic in nature? Veda also mentions a member of Panis community named Bribu who is praised in Rig Veda 6.45.31 because he is said to have gifted many cows to Rishi Bhardwaj (Manu Smriti 10.107) in which he is referred to as a carpenter. Now all of a sudden a Panis member is praised, what’s the reason? Because the reason to kill and plunder them is clearly given in Atharva Veda 20.93.2 that the Panis brings no gifts, had they given donations like Panis Bribu then they would’ve been spared and would’ve also been praised in the Vedas. Panis were rich merchants, they also had carpenters they used to rear cattle, engaged in trade and amassed wealth. These are the characteristics of humans not demons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kikata too were plundered like Dasyu and Panis tribes because they didn’t observe Vedic rituals and didn’t make donations to Vedic deities. Veda also mentions Zoroastrians and calls them demons (Asura). The Asuras mentioned in Vedas are non other than Zoroastrians. They are actually Ahura worshippers (Zoroastrians). Vedic religion and Zoroastrianism are roughly of the same age they have many similarities like Vedic Yagna is called Yasna in Zoroastriniasm, Soma is Homa, Deva in Veda are positive while Daeva in Zoroastrianism is neutral to negative, Zoroastrian text also mentions Aryans. From Rig Veda Mandal 1 to 7, Vedic deities are also called as Asur but the definition when applied to Vedic deities is ‘Mighty’. When the Aryans moved from Central Asia to India they brought with them the memories, thus the word Asura is used till Rig Veda Mandal 7 as a praiseworthy word. And then it was turned negative and was also used later to describe enemies residing in eastern part of India such as Bengal and Assam like Asura king Naraka of Pragiyotisapura in Assam or Mahishasura. There’s also a tribe in India named <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/meeting-the-asurs-a-marginal-tribe-in-eastern-india/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Asur people<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> who claim themselves to be descendants of Mahishasura.</p>
<p>People of Lanka in Ramayana has been described as Demons. Hanuman burned hundreds of demons inhabiting Lanka for no fault of their when Ram’s enmity was towards Ravana and not towards inhabitants of Lanka. Ramayana makes no mention of humans residing in Lanka but refers to the people of Lanka as demons. Go to Sri Lanka and tell me how many demons you found there or at least try to find their bones.</p>
<p>Now let’s move on to the Puranas, which is the most important point here. Many Puranas especially Vishnu Purana book 3 chapters 17 &amp; 18 states that demons embraced Buddhism and Jainism. The reason I quote Vishnu Purana again and again is because two chapters of this scripture are dedicated in denigrating Buddhism and Jainism and gives a picture of how Hinduism perceives other religions. Hindu text says that demons embraced Buddhism. Their disciples and disciples would continue to preach this religion. Now as you may know Buddhism’s history is not unknown like Hinduism’s. We know who its founder was and when Buddhism was founded, we know that its founder really existed and was not a mythological figure. Buddhism was founded in the 6<sup>th</sup> century B.C. It was a time when humans had started recording history. So you tell me did any Greek, Roman or any traveller ever recorded that demons used to live in India and they embraced Buddhism as stated in Hindu scriptures? So what Hindus did is nothing but demonization of their enemies. Hinduism recognizes many tribes and Dasyus, Panis, Yavana… were among them and they have been demonized because as mentioned in Manu (10.45) all those who do not belong to four castes are Dasyu and Malechas. Now some also justify violent verses of Vedas saying that all violent verses about killing godless, riteless, those who do not offer gifts actually refers to demons and not to human beings and that demons were averse to humanity. An Asura named Rambha who was the father of Mahishasur was a devotee of Vedic deity Agni. Vishnu Purana bk 3 ch 17-18 states that demons were Vedic followers who couldn’t be killed unless they apostatizes from Vedic Dharma and embraces other religions like Buddhism and Jainism. So what these incidents prove is that even demons could follow Vedic religion but still that wouldn’t make them Hindus or Humans since Hinduism believes in birth based and only those belonging to four castes can be considered Vedic followers. So this refutes the claim that demons were averse to Devas or Humanity.</p>
<p>It is mentioned in Sutras,</p>
<p>Apastamba Sutra, Prasna I, Patala 9, Khanda 27.11 The expression Krishna Varna, ‘the black race,’ is truly Vedic. In the Rig-veda it usually denotes the aboriginal races, and sometimes the demons.</p>
<p>Vedas also states that the one who offers no worship is inhuman, wicked, evil, miser etc.,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 9.20.5 “Preserve us from the reproach of every one, who makes no offerings, is vicious and wicked and who utters ill words, so that we may be free (from anxiety).” Tr. SatyaPrakash Saraswati</p>
<p>Shouldn’t Ishwar be friendly with entire creation? Why Ishwar is friendly only with those who make offerings? Was it invented by Rishis to get wealth in the name of god? What about the poor people who don’t even have money to feed their children. Will Ishwar forgive them or punish them as he commands to kill those who doesn’t pour gifts.</p>

<p>This verse refers to the Panis tribe, according to some scholars the Panis tribe were also part of the Vedic society but were plundered and killed because they made no offerings to Ishwar, this is why they are considered Niggards. But Yaska gives a different meaning, Yaska writes that Panis tribe were Demons. One is not to be deluded by the usage of the word Demon here as Demons and Barbarians are those who does not follow the Veda or who lives beyond the boundaries of Aryavarta. The Vedic followers are commanded here to crush the Panis tribe only because they make no offerings to Vedic Gods. There are more evidences to show that tribes were plundered and killed just because they made no offerings to Vedic gods.</p>

<p>Other verses shows that Ishwar provides protection to those who make offerings to him, but Ishwar slays the person who doesn’t worship or make offerings. Why is Ishwar behaving like a thug? Shouldn’t Ishwar be equal and friendly to everyone irrespective of their offerings? All the verses I quoted above orders to kill those who make no offerings, there are several instances in Vedas wherein tribesmen were killed just because they made no offering to Ishwar,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 3.53.14 “O bounteous Lord, of what avail are the cattle of infidels to you. Neither they yield milk nor do these faithless persons kindle sacred fire. May you bring wealth of these unbelievers to us and give us possession of people of low mortality and crush them.” Tr. SayaPrakash Saraswati</p>
<p>This verse is referring to the Kikata tribe who were plundered by Vedic heroes and killed. Maharishi Yaska explains this as,</p>
<p>Nirukta 6.32 What are the cows doing in Kikata? Kikata is the name of a country where the non-Aryans dwell. Non-Aryan tribes are (so called because it is said),’What have they done? Or their assumption is that religious rites are useless. They neither get the milk to mix with the soma, nor kindle fire.</p>
<p>Here the Vedic god is invoked to plunder the cows of of Kikata people and to plunder the wealth of the king of Kikata tribe. As I said earlier, many tribes were plundered and looted by Vedic gods just because they made no offering to Ishwar, Kikata and Panis tribes are few examples. Here is another translation by Arya Samaj,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 3.53.14 “O learned king! you possess admirable wealth, what do the cattle do among the atheists because they have no faith in the Vedic teachings and rites or in place inhabited by them. They yield no milk to mix with the Soma, and do not perform the Yajna with the ghee of the cows. Therefore, bring them to us, so that we may use them for hospitality (giving the milk mixed with Soma) to teachers and preachers. Give us wealth taken away from the wicked persons for the use of those who hailing from a good family come to us. Remove far away from us a man who uses his power for doing mean or inglorious acts or keep him under us.” Tr. Acharya Dharma Deva Vidya Martanda</p>
<p><strong>Swami Dayanand Saraswati wrote on this verse</strong>, “As the cows do not grow among the wicked atheists, in the same manner, Dharma and other virtues do not grow among the persons lacking faith. Among the enlightened persons atheists can never have the upper hand. Therefore, good scholars should blot out atheism.” Tr. Acharya Dharma Deva Vidya Martanda</p>

<p>Is it right to kill someone just because they hate you or Ishwar? What kind of God is Ishwar who commands to kill the person who just hates him. The above verse explicitly says to be the first one to kill those who just ‘Hate’ you. Is this justifiable? If you just oppress a Brahmin you are liable to be killed according to Vedas, but the Brahmin can kill you, deprive you of your property, there is no sin in this, but oppressing a Brahmin is a grave sin in Vedas,</p>

<p>Manu Smriti 9.31-33 A Brahmana who knows the law need not bring any (offence) to the notice of the king; by his own power alone be can punish those men who injure him. His own power is greater than the power of the king; the Brahmana therefore, may punish his foes by his own power alone. Let him use without hesitation the sacred texts, revealed by Atharvan and by Angiras; speech, indeed, is the weapon of the Brahmana, with that he may slay his enemies.</p>

<p>Vishnu Purana 3.17 When the glorious Vishnu heard their prayers he emitted from his person an illusory form wliich he gave to the celestials and said. “This illusory form shall so deceive the Daityas, so that being led astray from the path of the Vedas, they may be put to death ; for all gods, demons and others, who shall transgress the authority of the Veda, shall perish by my prowess which I exercise for the preservation of the universe. Go then ; be not affraid ; this illusory form shall go before you. celestials, it shall be of great service to you, this day.</p>

<p>It is mentioned in Bhagwad Purana (Srimad Bhagvatam)</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagvatam 4.4.17 Sati continued: If one hears an irresponsible person blaspheme the master and controller of religion, one should block his ears and go away if unable to punish him. But if one is able to kill, then one should by force cut out the blasphemer’s tongue and kill the offender, and after that one should give up his own life.</p>
<p>ISKCON scholar writes on this verse,</p>
<p>“If possible she should have cut out Daksha’s tongue because he blasphemed Lord Siva. In other words, since Lord Siva is the protector of religion, a person who vilifies him should be killed at once, and after killing such a person, one should give up one’s life…The instruction set forth here in Srimad-Bhagavatam is that one should not tolerate at any cost the activities of a person who vilifies or blasphemes an authority. If one is a Brahmana he should not give up his body because by doing so he would be responsible for killing a Brahmana; therefore a Brahmana should leave the place or block his ears so that he will not hear the blasphemy. If one happens to be a Kshatriya he has the power to punish any man; therefore a Kshatriya should at once cut out the tongue of the vilifier and kill him. But as far as the Vaisyas and Sudras are concerned, they should immediately give up their bodies.” [<a href="http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_4.4.17" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right"> http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_4.4.17 <span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>]
