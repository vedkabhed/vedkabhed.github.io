<p>Written by Sulaiman Razvi</p>
<p>Why do Hindu women cover their head especially during worship? Have you noticed that a lot of Hindu women covers their head while offering prayers, meeting their elders? Hindus say that it is done to pay respect. Although veiling is not ordained in Hinduism like in Islam but some texts suggests that covering head or veiling was also common among Hindu women in Puranik period. Hijab is mentioned in the Quran and not Niqab (face veil) although face veil is also acceptable. According to <a href="http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/many-women-have-no-say-in-marriage/article5801893.ece" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">The Hindu<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> report, 60% of women in India practice face/head covering, the highest is in Rajasthan where 96% of women practice head/face covering, in Bihar it is 91% and in Haryana &amp; Madhya Pradesh the percentage is 88% while Muslim population in these states are just 9.1%. 16.9%, 7% and 6.6% respectively. We can find examples of women covering their head or wearing veil in Hindu scriptures. Hindu goddess Parvati is said to have covered her face with a garment while meeting sage Narada,<br />
<span id="more-1107"></span></p>
<p>Padma Purana I.43.128b-133b &#8220;Joining her lotus-like hands and <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><span style="color:#ff0000;text-decoration:underline;">concealing her face the beloved of the Mountain saluted the sage</span></span>, a heap of lustre&#8230;Then the respectable daughter of the Himalaya mountain, whose mind was amazed, saw the sage Narada of wonderful form. The sage also addressed her with (these) affectionate words: &#8216;Come, O daughter&#8217;. But embracing the father, she sat on his lap. The mother said to the respectable girl: &#8216;O daughter, salute the revered sage, blessed with penance. (Thereby) you will obtain a husband of your liking&#8217;. Thus addressed by her mother, <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><span style="color:#ff0000;text-decoration:underline;">she, having covered her face with her garment</span></span> and with her slightly trembling, did not utter any word.&#8221; Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p>Sati the first wife of Hindu god Shiva is also said to have practiced veiling, Brahma said,<br />
Shiva Purana, Rudra Samhita 2, Satikhanda section II, Chapter 19, verses 26-27 &#8220;Then, O sage, afflicted by the cupid and delighted in the heart of hearts, <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><span style="color:#ff0000;text-decoration:underline;">I lifted her veil and stared into the face of Sati</span></span>. I looked at the face of Sati many a time&#8230;&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Mahabharata says that Draupadi veiled herself properly while addressing sage Narada,<br />
Mahabharata Adi Parva 1, Section 210, verses 14-16 &#8220;Hearing of the <em>Rishi&#8217;s</em> arrival Draupadi, purifying herself properly, came with a respectful attitude to where Narada was with the Pandavas. The virtuous princess of Panchala, worshipping the celestial <em>Rishi&#8217;s</em> feet, stood with joined hands before him, <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><span style="color:#ff0000;text-decoration:underline;">properly veiled</span></span>, The illustrious Narada, pronouncing various benedictions on her, commanded the princess to retire.&#8221; Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Some verses about women veiling themselves,</p>
<p>Valmiki Ramayana, Yuddha Khanda 6, Sarga 111, verses 63-64 &#8220;O Lord! Are you not indeed enraged, in seeing me on foot in this way out through the city-gate, unveiled and come on foot in the way? O lover of your consorts! <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><span style="color:#ff0000;text-decoration:underline;">Look at all your spouses, who came out, with their veils dropped off</span></span>. Why are you not getting enraged in seeing this?&#8221; Tr. K.M.K. Murthy</p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 9.18.1-26 &#8220;&#8230;O Nârada! Seeing S&#8217;ankhachûda coming near to her, Tulasî covered her face by her clothing and she&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijananda</p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 9.19.2-94 &#8220;&#8230;The king S&#8217;ankhachûda then attracted his dear Tulasî to his breast and <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><span style="color:#ff0000;text-decoration:underline;">took off the veil fully from her face</span></span> and began to look on that, next moment he kissed on her cheek and lips and gave her a pair of garments brought from the Varuna&#8217;s house&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>You may have seen pictures of Hindu goddess Sita with her head covered by her Saree or other cloth. Valmiki Ramayana, Kishkindha Kanda 4, Sarga 6, verse 11 says that Sita dropped her upper cloth (Uttariya) and jewellery while being abducted so that her husband may find her by tracing her belongings. The Sanskrit word Uttariya has several meanings like shawl, scarf, upper garment. But since she used to wear Saree, so the upper garment here refers to scarf with which she used to cover her head. Manmath Nath Dutt also translates the word Uttariya as scarf here,</p>
<p>Valmiki Ramayana, Kishkindha Kanda 4, Sarga 6, verses 11-12 &#8220;Seeing me along with my four counsellors stationed at the hill, she dropped down her scarf and her ornaments. All these, O Raghava, I have taken and kept (with me. I will bring them. It behoveth thee to recognise them.&#8221; Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>It is mentioned in Tulsi Ramayana,<br />
Ramcharitmanas Doha 116, Chaupai 1-4 &#8220;&#8230;The one who is artless in manners and has a fair and graceful form is called Lakshamana and is my younger brother-in-law. Again veiling Her moon-like face with an end of Her sari She looked at Her beloved lord&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Gita Press</p>
<p>Bhavabhuti a 8th century scholar too refers to Sita&#8217;s veil in his Mahavira Charitra. It is further mentioned in the Mahavir Charitra Act 2 Page 71 that When Purshuram comes, Rama tells his wife Sita that &#8220;He is our elder, please lower your gaze, and put on the veil&#8221;. A 7th century C.E poet named Magha in his Sisupalavadha V.17 described the women of Krishna&#8217;s household as wearing a veil.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Make sure you read the first part of this article, </strong><a href="/index.php/2014/05/14/response-to-women-in-hinduismvedas-part-i/" data-wpel-link="internal"><strong>Women in Hinduism/Vedas Part 1</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>CLAIM: VEDAS PRAY FOR BIRTH OF DAUGHTERS</strong></p>
<p>It is true that the birth of the son was celebrated from last 100 years. But this was not because of a Vedic injunction. This is because of the Jihadis who were killing men and raping the women, so Sons were wished to defend from these Jihadis and to prevent rape. <strong>On contrary, there are specific verses in Vedas that pray for begetting daughters! Refer Rigveda 10.159.3</strong>, Rigveda 8.31.8, Yajurveda 22.22, Rigveda 4.32.23 and Atharvaveda 10.3.20.</p>
<p><span id="more-596"></span></p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE:<br />
</strong></p>
<p>The interesting thing to note is some Hindus always blame Muslims for the Vedic verses oppressing women and treating them like third class citizens. Woman in Vedas is merely seen as a commodity. There are verses that prays only for the birth of a Son and doesn&#8217;t wish for Daughter, in fact the Vedas even says that a girl should be born somewhere else and 10 Sons should be born in this womb (this is the context of the hymn), this is the reason why the writer is talking about the so called Vedic verses wishing for Daughters.</p>
<p>In reality there isn&#8217;t a single verse which says so, Vedas pray for the birth of a Son in many passages like the entire hymn of Atharva Veda 6.11. and 7.48 are dedicated for the birth of a son and several verses like Atharva Veda 14.1.22, 12.3.47, 2.36.3, 14.2.72, Rig Veda 3.31.1, 10.85.42-45 and so on pray for the birth of a Son only but I don&#8217;t find a single verse that wishes for daughter.</p>
<p>All the verses the writer has quoted are mistranslated although he claims to be using &#8220;Authentic&#8221; translation. I will mostly be using Arya Samaj translations and also orthodox Hindi translations of renowned Hindu scholars like Shri Ram Acharya, Swami Karpatri and Pundit Ram Govind Trivedi.</p>
<p>The first verse he quoted about Daughter&#8217;s birth is Rig Veda 10.159.3, first let&#8217;s see what he wrote in another article</p>
<p><strong>CLAIM:</strong></p>
<p>Chapter 1: Women in Vedic Dharma, Page 21</p>
<p>Rig 10.159</p>
<p>A women speaks after waking up in morning, &#8220;My destiny is as glorious as the rising sun. I am the flag of my home and society. I am also their head. I can give impressive discourses. My sons conquer enemies. My daughter illuminates the whole world. I myself am winner of enemies. My husband has infinite glory. I have made those sacrifices which make a king successful. I have also been successful. I have destroyed my enemies.&#8221;</p>
<p>(Book: Mera Dharma, Author: Priyavrat Vedavachaspati, Gurukul Kangri University)</p>
<p><strong>MY RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>He claimed that Rig Veda 10.159.3 prays for birth of a daughter but according to his own translation we can&#8217;t find any sentence where the birth of a daughter is wished. Here is the correct translation,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.159.3-6My Sons are slayers of the foe, my Daughter is a ruling Queen… and rid me of each rival wife. Destroyer of the rival wife, Sole Spouse, victorious, conqueror. The others&#8217; glory have I seized as &#8217;twere the wealth of weaker Dames.…I have subdued as conqueror these rivals, these my fellow-wives, That I may rule this Hero and the folk.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="453" height="357" class="wp-image-7743" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-93.png" alt="http://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/060218_0701_testingresp2.png" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-93.png 453w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-93-300x236.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 453px) 100vw, 453px" /></p>
<p>These verses doesn&#8217;t pray for the birth of a daughter rather this is a prayer of a greedy Queen who wants to get rid of her co-wives so that she may rule the kingdom. His last sentence is correct to an extent</p>
<p>The context of this verse is that a Queen has many co wives, and she is praying for the destruction of her co-wives so she may have control over all the wealth and rule the kingdom. It even states that she destroyed her rival wives. Can this verse which depicts a woman as greedy, wealth monger, killer of innocent rival wives be used to show that Women are praised in Vedas?</p>
<p>The correct translation for the next verse the writer has quoted is,</p>
<p>Yajurveda 22.22 &#8220;warrior ; the cow giving abundant milk, the ox good at carrying burden ; the swift courser ; the woman skilled in domestic affairs, May this sacrificer be blessed with sons&#8221;. Tr. Devi Chand. <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="508" height="188" class="wp-image-7744" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-94.png" alt="http://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/060218_0701_testingresp3.png" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-94.png 508w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-94-300x111.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 508px) 100vw, 508px" /></p>
<p>This verse also prays for the birth of a son only, and says that Women (Stri not daughter) should be skilled in domestic work, it doesn&#8217;t say that daughter should be born. This verse rather projects a woman as a slave who is used only for domestic work.</p>
<p>Rigveda 4.32.23 Like two slight images (puppets) of girls, unrobed, upon a new-wrought post, So shine the Bay Steeds in their course.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="625" height="85" class="wp-image-7745" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-95.png" alt="http://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/060218_0701_testingresp4.png" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-95.png 625w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-95-300x41.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" /></p>
<p>This verse is used by some Orthodox Hindus to prove Idol worship in Vedas. This verse doesn&#8217;t talk anything about begetting a daughter.</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 10.3.20 As glory dwelleth in a maid, and in this well-constructed car, So may the Charm, etc.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="625" height="115" class="wp-image-7746" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-96.png" alt="http://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/060218_0701_testingresp5.png" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-96.png 625w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-96-300x55.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" /></p>
<p>Rig Veda 8.31.8</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="535" height="212" class="wp-image-7747" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-97.png" alt="http://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/060218_0701_testingresp6.png" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-97.png 535w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-97-300x119.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 535px) 100vw, 535px" /></p>
<p>The above verse is translated as &#8220;The man and woman who obeys Ishwar and who does good deeds gets good Son…&#8221;</p>
<p>This verse do not speak of birth of a daughter, as we see here, other translations states that &#8220;They are blessed with sons&#8221;, the Arya Samaj Hindi translation also speaks of a Son born to parents who obeys Ishwar, So does that mean Ishwar will curse the people who do not follow him by giving them a Daughter? Griffith&#8217;s translation also doesn&#8217;t mention anything about begetting sons or daughters.</p>
<p>Rig Veda 9.67.10 May Pusan, drawn by goats, be our protector, and on all his paths Bestow on us our share of maids.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="492" height="93" class="wp-image-7748" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-98.png" alt="http://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/060218_0701_testingresp7.png" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-98.png 492w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-98-300x57.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 492px) 100vw, 492px" /></p>
<p>This verse does not pray for the birth of a daughter rather it is longing for WOMAN and praying to get women for carnal purpose. The Sanskrit word is Kanya which is translated as Maiden or Lady. Arya Samaj translations like Satyaprakash and Tulsi also does not mention anything about bestowing daughters.</p>
<p><strong>CLAIM:</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 5.47.6 mentions that: &#8220;<strong>Those educated women who happily choose their husbands and then give birth to noble children, plan and train their life and those of children in same manner as one weaves a cloth from threads slowly and steadily.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p><strong>MY RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>Correct translation is</p>
<p>Rig Veda 5.47.6 &#8220;For him worshippers lengthen praises and works of adoration, and for him mothers (cosmos) sew garments of rays. Rejoicing in the contact of their impregnation, the rays, the consorts, of the sun, come to our presence by the path of the sky, to meet him.&#8221; Tr. Saty Prakash Saraswati</p>
<p>It does not talk about the &#8220;Educated Women&#8221;, rather this verse talks about a Woman weaving garment for her Son (according to Shri Ram Acharya translation).</p>
<p><strong>CLAIM:</strong></p>
<p>Yajurveda 5.10: O woman, realize your potential. You are a lioness who can destroy criminals, ignorance and vices and protect the noble ones.</p>
<p><strong>MY RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>Correct translation is.</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 5.10 &#8220;O speech, thou pronouncest words and overawest foes, attain to the learned. O speech, thou art the dispeller of ignorance, and remover of evils, purify the religious-minded people. O speech, thou art the destroyer of ignoble character and the subduer of mean demeanour, aborn thyself for the well-behaved learned persons.&#8221;- Tr. Devi Chand (Arya Samaj)</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="467" height="368" class="wp-image-7749" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-99.png" alt="http://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/060218_0701_testingresp8.png" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-99.png 467w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-99-300x236.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 467px) 100vw, 467px" /></p>
<p>This verse is not even addressed to a woman, secondly it talks about the Vedic speech. The verse is in femininity because the addressee is Ved<br />
Vani (Vedic Speech/words) which are feminine in Hindi and Sanskrit language.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION BLUNDER OF THE WRITER</strong></p>

<p>This verse does not ask the wife to give knowledge, nor it says to become the queen, this verse talks about a Bride and Bridegroom. The author should quote the 22<sup>nd</sup> verse which prays for Sons and Grandsons.</p>

This is also a payer made to Goddess requesting her husband to bestow riches. Your doubts will be cleared if you read all 3 verses of this hymn,</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 7.46.1-3 O broad-tressed Sinivāli, thou who art the sister of the Gods, Accept the offered sacrifice, and, Goddess, grant us progeny.

<p>This verse does not state that girls should educate themselves. The word Brahmacharya here denotes self-restraint, not about getting education, if it is about getting education then can the writer please explain which school educates Bull and Horse? This is why Griffith whose translation is based on Hindu scholars also translates it as &#8220;by Self-restraint&#8221;.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="625" height="120" class="wp-image-7761" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-111.png" alt="http://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/060218_0701_testingresp20.png" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-111.png 625w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-111-300x58.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" /></p>
<p>The writer has translated the names of goddesses Raka and Kuhu as woman, but actually these are the names of the Hindu goddesses,</p>
<p>Bhagawad Purana 4.1.34: Angira&#8217;s wife, Sraddha, gave birth to four daughters, named Sinivali, Kuhu, Raka and Anumati.</p>
<p>Nirukta 11.28 &#8220;Anumati and Raka are two wives of gods&#8221;</p>
<p>Nirukta 11.33 &#8220;Simvali and Kuhu are two wives of gods&#8221;</p>
<p>Offerings were made to these goddesses</p>
<p>Krishna Yajur Veda 5.6.18 &#8220;To Aditi are (to be offered) three ruddy-spotted; to Indrani three black-spotted; to Kuhu three red-spotted; three calves to Raka; three heifers to Sinivali; the red-spotted hornless ones are for Agni and Visnu.&#8221;</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s clear that these verses refer to Hindu goddesses not to common women. Kuhu is the goddess of the new moon day. The Atharva Veda 7.47 is a hymn for gaining wealth and Son. The verses addressed to Goddesses can not be used to portray women are highly revered in Vedas, readers can go through this article to know why Goddesses are praised <a href="/index.php/2014/01/01/why-did-the-brahmins-dethrone-the-gods-and-enthrone-the-goddesses/" data-wpel-link="internal">Why did the Brahmins dethrone the Gods and enthrone the Goddesses?</a></p>
<p>for the sake of the argument even if I accept his translation to be correct, it doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean that the wife is a good luck charm that will bring wealth. A woman in Hinduism brings wealth with her as a Dowry, even after the marriage she has to keep bringing money from her parent&#8217;s house, so this is how she brings wealth, Dayanand Saraswati writes,</p>
<p><strong><em>&#8216;</em></strong>&#8216;If the bride&#8217;s people do not live very far from her husband&#8217;s home, there is a possibility of her parents becoming poor<strong><em>, as whenever she visits her parents, they will have to give her something or other by the way of a present.&#8221;-</em></strong>Satyarth Prakash ch 4, p84.</p>
<p>Further the Hymn of Atharva Veda 7.48 is also a prayer to get wealth and a SON. The author should have honestly quoted the previous verse also,</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 7.48.1 …may beget sons…</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="546" height="127" class="wp-image-7762" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-112.png" alt="http://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/060218_0701_testingresp21.png" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-112.png 546w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-112-300x70.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 546px) 100vw, 546px" /></p>
<p>Vedas doesn&#8217;t say woman brings prosperity, but prosperity here only means the birth of a son, Rig Veda and the hymn of Atharva Veda 7.48 is entirely dedicated for birth of a son and prosperity. Another verse states that</p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.63.15 Vouchsafe us blessing in our paths and desert tracts, blessing in waters and in battle, for the light; Blessing upon the wombs that bring male children forth</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 12.3.47 …A youthful world, a son hath been begotten. Begin a life that brings success and triumph.</p>
<p>Similarly the woman who has no son was looked down in the Vedic period, it is mentioned in the Brahmana,</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana 5.3.1.13 And on the following day he goes to the house of a discarded (wife), and prepares a pap for Nirriti;–a discarded wife is one who has no son…hail!&#8217; For a wife that is without a son, is possessed with Nirriti (destruction, calamity)…</p>
<p>So in the Vedic scripture the woman brings prosperity only by giving birth to a son, if she doesn&#8217;t she is discarded, looked down, rejected, cursed.</p>

<p>The speaker in this verse is not God, it&#8217;s the father. The Arya Samaj translation does not say that the &#8220;Woman/Bride shall be the protector of your family&#8221;. This verse is spoken by the father to his daughter&#8217;s in laws. Usually parents only speak the goodness of their children.</p>

<p>The writer is quoting half-baked verses, he correctly quoted that the Bride may become the queen of her husband&#8217;s house but didn&#8217;t say how she could become  queen. It&#8217;s simple, by Begetting a Son. If begetting a son makes a woman the queen of the house then begetting a daughter might make her the housemaid. It also does not state that she should enlighten all but it says she shines in lovliness.</p>

<p>First of all the speaker here is a man wishing for a Bride, secondly the Arya Samaj translation does not state that &#8220;I&#8217; am knowledgeable so are you&#8221;. Next verse of this hymn prays for begetting a Son, So again there is a discrimination against birth of Daughter. The Upanishad explains this verse,</p>
<p>Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 6.4.20 &#8220;Then he embraces her, repeating the following mantra:I am the vital breath and you are speech. You are speech and I am the vital breath. I am Saman and you are Rig; I am heaven and you are earth. Come, let us strive together so that we may have a male child.&#8221;</p>
<p>The next verses of this Brihadaranyaka Upanishad are too vulgar, it explicitly tells sex positions. So I won&#8217;t be quoting it here, readers can check those verses in the article <a href="/index.php/2014/12/27/hinduism-lust/" data-wpel-link="internal">Hinduism and Lust</a>. The writer is quoting verses which are to be recited at the time of marriage or when the Bride enters the house, she brings lot of wealth with her as dowry and is wished only for begetting sons so how can these verses be used to show women are revered in Vedas? Even a horse or bull which is slaughtered in the Yajna is mentioned in similar way in the Vedas. If the writer wants to show equal status of women in Vedas then he should quote verses giving them equal inheritance, praising common women (Not goddesses), permitting them to get education, allowing them to do trade and commerce etc.</p>

<p>These verses are not about the dowry of knowledge but the actual dowry which the bride brings to her in laws. The evil roots of Dowry system in India originated from Vedas.

<p>Rig Veda 3.31.1 &#8220;The disciplined and wise father, relying on the sanction of natural rights, honours his grandson, the son of his daughter, with valuable gifts. The father trusting to the impregnation of the daughter consoles himself with cheerful mind.&#8221; Tr. Satya Prakash Saraswati</p>
<p>This verse shows the eagerness to get a son, this verse is about a man who was sonless and gained a grandson from her daughter. Further this verse no where talks about equal share of property, Pandit jaydev writes in the commentary</p>
<p>&#8220;The grandson shall be the legal heir of his grandfather&#8217;s property&#8221;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="462" height="286" class="wp-image-7770" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-119.png" alt="http://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/060218_0701_testingresp29.png" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-119.png 462w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2018-06-06021-119-300x186.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 462px) 100vw, 462px" /></p>
<p>So where is the equal inheritance here? It is more biased, Several question arises from this commentary, Why does a grandson become the heir when the sonless man already has a daughter? Isn&#8217;t there equal inheritance for woman? Why does the Man need to adopt his grandson when he already has a daughter? Swami Dayanand Saraswati says that a sonless Man can contract Niyoga to get sons even if he has a Daughter. Why this partiality against daughters?</p>
<p>And how can Arya Samajis claim that Vedas give inheritance right to women when none of their scripture says? Vedas does not entitle woman to inherit, only the sons enjoys the right of inheritance. The Hindu law is that the women shall not inherit her father&#8217;s property and if the Father is sonless only then his grandson (from his daughter) should inherit his property, as it is recorded in Bhagwad Puran</p>
<p>Bhagwad Puran 10.57.37 &#8220;Since Satrajit had no sons, his daughter&#8217;s sons should receive his inheritance. They should pay for memorial offerings of waler and pinda, clear their grandfather&#8217;s outstanding debts and keep the remainder of the inheritance for themselves.</p>
<p>So if one has a son, then there is no chance for the daughter&#8217;s son to inherit his Grandfather&#8217;s property. For more details read my article <a href="/index.php/2014/05/14/no-inheritance-for-woman-in-vedas/" data-wpel-link="internal">No Inheritance for Women in Vedas</a></p>

<p>This is what the writer is trying to do in the whole article, when he can&#8217;t find any verse which praises women, he just twisted the verses attributed to Hindu Goddesses and said it speaks about common Women. All those verses are prayers to Vedic Godesses, they doesn&#8217;t praise common women. This translation is not fully correct. Usha was physically assaulted in Veda, I&#8217; am using Shri Ram Acharya&#8217;s Hindi translation for this verse below,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 4.30.8-11 And this heroic deed of might thou, Indra, also hast achieved, That thou didst smite to death the Dame, Heaven&#8217;s Daughter, meditating ill. Thou, Indra, Mighty One, didst crush Usas, though Daughter of the Sky. When lifting up herself in pride.</p>

<p>According to some scholars Indra raped Usha, while according to others this is an allegorical verse and has a different meaning. However I&#8217; am not talking about the context of this verse, the purpose is only to show that Usha does not represent the &#8220;Ideal Woman&#8221; in Vedas as the author claims. Usha is a goddess representing the sky and is considered the daughter of the sky. So my question to the author is If Usha represents the Ideal Woman then why did Indra (sometime translated as Ideal Man by Arya Samaj) assault Usha? Who is the ideal person here? Moreover this verse also gives a wrong impression of physical abuse on women.</p>
<p>As far as the verse Rigved 12.85.46 is concerned, the term Usha is not mentioned there, it&#8217;s referring to bride. He did not show the reason as to why the woman is getting special treatment, whole context can be understood by reading previous verses,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.85.42-45 … With sons and grandsons sport and play, rejoicing in your own abode. …Not inauspicious enter thou thy husband&#8217;s house … Loving the Gods, delightful, bearing sons [Hero]… O Bounteous Indra, make this bride blest in her sons and fortunate. Vouchsafe to her ten sons, and make her husband the eleventh man.</p>

<p>This verse prays for begetting 10 sons but doesn&#8217;t state anything about birth of even one daughter. This verse is about the bride and is recited before the bride enters the house. And the evils of this hymn is that this hymn of Rig Veda Mandal 10 Sukt 85 is about Dowry, where the bride brings wealth with her.

<span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><strong>This series of articles on women in Hinduism will be in four parts .</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span><br />
<span id="more-5641"></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span><br />
<span style="color:gray;font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Part 1- Women in Hinduism: Conflict between Swami Dayanand Ji &amp; Agniveer.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span><br />
<span style="color:gray;font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Part 2- Women in Hinduism: Lies of Agniveer.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span><br />
<span style="color:gray;font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Part 3- Women in Hinduism: Lies of Agniveer.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span><br />
<span style="color:gray;font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Part 4- Women in Hinduism: Let us see whether Agniveer will quit Vedic Dharm or not?</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">In his present article on women, Agniveer makes so many bogus claims. In this series of articles we are going to analyze them one by one.<br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">In his recent article on women in Hinduism he makes these claims on Niyog.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:firebrick;font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">1. Niyog Pratha was a social custom to beget a child that <span style="text-decoration:underline;">was prevalent in all societies</span> and more so in Biblical and Quranic society.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:firebrick;font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">2. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Bible, Quran and Hadiths are full of such references</span>. </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:firebrick;font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">3. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">But Vedas have no mention of Niyog</span>. People have interpreted vedic verses to create social custom of Niyog to prevent prostitution in emergency situations. But neither is it a Vedic order nor a compulsory practice in Aryan society. </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:firebrick;font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">4. On contrary, many a prophets of Christianity and Islam got children from slave-girls <span style="text-decoration:underline;">but never made them their wives!</span> Prophet Abraham is supposed to have even attempted to abandon his slave-girl to death after having child from her. Prophet Muhammad is supposed to have the only son from his slave Maria. God only knows the veracity of these stories and support for sex-slavery in Bible and Quran. </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:firebrick;font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">5. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">But as far as Vedas are concerned, any relation apart from one single wife/husband is clearly considered to be cause of miseries.&#8221;</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:firebrick;font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">6. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">As for Mahabharat, well thats a historical text full of interpolations and written in an era when the Vedic values were already dwindling. However evidence in matter of Dharma can come only from Vedas. So kindly cite Vedic references.</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:firebrick;font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">7. Niyog is optional not compulsory and in emergency situation only.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><strong>Before analyzing these claims about Niyog in detail, let us see what Swami Dayanand had to say about Niyog.</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><strong>ALL THE POINTS TAKEN HERE ARE FROM SATYARTHA PRAKASH TRANSLATED  BY Shri Dr. Chrianjiva Gharadwaya.</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:teal;font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">PAGE 129</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:teal;font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">1.Re-marriage is <span style="text-decoration:underline;">absolutely prohibited in the case of a twice born man or woman (i.e., one belonging to a Brahman, Kshatriya or Vaishya Class</span> . </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:teal;font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">2. The following are the principal evils of remarriage:-</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:teal;font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">a.Diminution of love between the husband and the wife, since either of them can desert the other whenever he or she so desires, and marry another person.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:teal;font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">b.On the death of one party, the other will take away the property of his or her deceased consort when he or she marries again. This will give rise to family disputes. </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:teal;font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">c.If a widow re marries, many a noble family will be blotted out of existence, and its property destroyed (by constant alienation).</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:teal;font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">d.Re-marriage involves loss of true conjugal love and infraction of duty towards the departed husband or wife. </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:teal;font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">PAGE 130</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:teal;font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"> 3.Q. ~ If one of the parties dies leaving no male issue, even then the family line will become extinct. Besides, if re-marriage be not allowed, the widows and widowers will resort to adultery and fornication, procure abortion, and will commit wicked deeds of a kindred nature. For these reasons re-marriage is desirable. </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:teal;font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">A. ~ No. If the widows and widowers desire to practice Brahmacharya, no such evil consequences will accrue. Again, if the widow or widower adopts a boy of her and his Class, the family line will be continued and there will be no danger of adultery being restored to. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Those, however, who cannot control their passions may beget children by having recourse to Niyoga. </span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:teal;font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><em>So lets us see what the niyoga is</em> [writer]</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:teal;font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">4.Q. ~ What are the differences between re-marriage and Niyoga?</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:teal;font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">A. ~ 1.After marriage the bride leaves her paternal roof, lives with her husband, and her relations with her relations with her father&#8217;s family cease to be very close; on the contrary. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">The widow (in case she contracts Niyoga) continues to live in her deceased husband&#8217;s house. </span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:teal;font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">2.The children begotten of marriage inherit the property of their mother&#8217;s husband, whereas, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">offspring begotten of Niyoga on a widow are not regarded as children of the begetter and consequently they don&#8217;t take his surname, nor can they be claimed by him. They are spoken fo as the children of their mother&#8217;s deceased husband, take his surname, inherit his property and live in his house. </span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:teal;font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;text-decoration:underline;">3.Married people are required to serve and help each other, while those that contract Niyoga have to abandon all relations (after the stipulated period). </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:teal;font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;text-decoration:underline;">4.The relation of marriage is life-long, while the contract of Niyoga ceases to be operative after the desired object has been attained. </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:teal;font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;text-decoration:underline;"><em>5,.The husband and the wife help each other in the performance of their house hold duties, while those that have that have contracted Niyoga discharge the duties of their respective households.</em></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:teal;font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><em>PAGE 131</em></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:teal;font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Q. ~ Do the same laws apply to Niyoga and marriage, or are they different in each case?</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:teal;font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">A. ~ They are little different. A few differences have already been enumerated, and here are some more:-</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:teal;font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><em>A married couple can produce children up to the limit of ten, while that connected by Niyoga cannot produce more than two or four.A married couple always lives together but not that connected by Niyoga..</em></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:teal;font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Let the widow rear the children for two or three years and hand them to her husband by Niyoga, in case it has been entered into for his behalf. In this way a widow can give birth to two children for herself and two for each of the four husbands by Niyoga. Similarly a widower can beget two children for himself and two for each of the four wives by Niyoga. Thus ten children in all can be produced by means of Niyoga. </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:teal;font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">This is what the Veda declares:-&#8220;O thou who art fit to procreate and art strong, do thou raise upon the married wife or upon these widows, with whom thou hast <span style="text-decoration:underline;">contracted Niyoga</span>, good children, and make them happy. Do thou beget with on thy married wife ten children, and consider her the eleventh (memberof the family). O woman! Let ten children be raised on thee by the married husband or thy <span style="text-decoration:underline;">husbands by Niyoga</span> and do thou consider thy husband as the eleventh (member of thy family).&#8221; Rig Veda 10: 85, 48.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:teal;font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">PAGE 133</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:teal;font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Q. ~Should the relation of Niyoga be entered into with a member of one&#8217;s own Class or with that of a different Class as well? </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:teal;font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"> A. ~ A woman should contract Niyoga with a member of one&#8217;s own Class or with that of a higher Class, that is, a Vaishaya woman with a Braahman, a Kshatriya or aVaishaya; a Kshatriya woman with Kshatriya or a Braahman; a Brahman woman with a Braahman. The object of this is that the spermatic fluid should always be of a man of the same Class as the woman or of a higher Class, never </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:teal;font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"> PAGE 134</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:teal;font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Q. ~ are there any Vedic and Shaastric authorities in favor of Niyoga, as there are in support of the marriage institution? </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:teal;font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">A. ~ <em>&#8220;O man and woman <span style="text-decoration:underline;">(connected by Niyoga</span>), just as a widow, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">co-habits with her husband by Niyoga and produces children for him</span>, and a wife co-habits with her husband by marriage and produces children for him, likewise (it may be asked) where both of you were during the day and during the night, and where you slept, who you are, and what your native place is.&#8221; RIG VEDA 10: 40, 2. </em></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

Do thou bear this in mind.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:teal;font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"> PAGE 140 </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:teal;font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"> A. ~ We have answered this objection while treating of Niyoga. <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong><em>If a man be not able to control his passions while his wife and she is pregnant, he may contract Niyoga with a (widow) and beget offspring on her, but let him never misconduct himself with a prostitute or commit adultery.</em></strong></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:teal;font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">PAGE 142</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:teal;font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">&#8230; <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong><em>Niyoga is clearly allowed by the Veda.</em></strong></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Above we read some laws related to niyog and remarriage which iare laid by Swami Dayanand Saraswati which he backs up through Vedas, Manusmriti and other scriptures. He even gives historical refrences from Mahabharata [<em>it is to be noted agniveer reject these refrences,now its upto reader to decide who is write and who is wrong</em>] and gives various qualities of Niyoga.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">In his belief the alleged reformer has claimed re-marriage as faulty and Niyog as justified and appropriate .</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Swami Dayanand pointed back on remarriage issue as goofy, nonsense and childish . Further more as the great writer has mentioned that if a man or a woman remarries their faith/religion will be lost/destroyed but due to Niyog their basic faith will be pure and safe. Isn&#8217;t this nonsensical? </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">What kind of <em>patidharam</em> is this in which if a woman remarries will loose or destroy his faith and if she maintains 11 other sexual relationships she will be safe and clean?</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">If a wife is alive and due to certain reasons the husband is  incapable to reproduce, this doesn&#8217;t mean that he lacks sexual desire. If a man has sexual desire but is incapable of producing offspring and his wife approaches another men for niyog, then where and how will the husband fulfill his sexual desire?</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Given a thought, everwhere he mentions about begetting a male child only after niyog, but according to the science there is 50% possibility can  be a birth of a girl child. <em>[This is another proof of wishing a male child  in Vedas which we will see later on,and it may also be noted that swami ji permits  Noyog for begetting a male child even if a daughter is present.] </em>In such circumstances where a girl child is born, the rules and conditions governing Niyog have not been mentioned </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Swami ji said that  &#8220;Married people are required to serve and help each other, while those that contract Niyoga have to abandon all relations after the stipulated period. The relation of marriage is life-long, while the contract of Niyoga ceases to be operative after the desired object has been attained. The husband and the wife help each other in the performance of their house hold duties, while those that have that have contracted Niyoga discharge the duties of their respective households.then for two or three years women have to take care of child.&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Now mark, isn&#8217;t it like lower animal activity in which after having sex only the female has to take care of the children? </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">As Swami has mentioned, if a woman goes on producing girl babies, still MAN can have a male child by doing niyog. Here the point to be noted is, if a woman keeps giving birth to a girl, then its not the woman but the man who is to be blamed. This is a scientific fact that the determination of gender is done by a male and not by female.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">As written, if spoken bluntly, Niyog can be done if a wife is pregnant and husband seeks a sexual relationship and if a husband is ill for long time and the wife wants to have sexual relationship. In such cases they can look for proper partners and go for Niyog.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Aren&#8217;t the law, virtue and values not being locked up here? Is the not the meaning of Niyog FREE SEX? Can you imagine any society which is of more low standard than this? </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">One more thing to note is what Swami Dayanand states, &#8220;that even <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong><em>If a man be not able to control his passions while his wife  is pregnant</em> he wants to have sexual relationship in such case he  can look for proper partners &amp; go for Niyog</strong></span>.&#8221; Now if the necessity of Niyog was only to bear children (which it is not), why go for free sex during the wife&#8217;s pregnancy?</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Swami Dayanand in order to confirm the truthfulness, authenticity and practicality gave two examples from the period of Mahabharata. It is written that Vyas had Niyog with wives of those  persons with unique semen and derived offsprings. By Niyog process, Ambika derived Dhritrashtrya, Ambalika derived Pandu and a servant derived Vidur. Another example is of the wives of King Pandu&#8217;s women Kunti and Madri. Due to the reason of incapability in production of Pandu both his wives derived offspring by Niyog. </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">[<em>it is quite contrary to the view held by Agniveer that the refrence from Mahabharata is interpolation</em>]</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">As said in Mahabharat, what to say about Niyog, child even with a non-married woman  was considered good and venerable. The two wise &amp; great men Ved viyas and Bheeshm pitamah&#8217;s origin is a solid proof. </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Secondly, in Mahabharat time, in a society one woman could be a wife of 5 brothers e.g. Draupadi the wife of Pandav is a solid proof. </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Thirdly, according to what is written in Mahabharata, in this era, even without woman&#8217;s communication only men were able give birth to children. Mahabharat&#8217;s major character guru Dronacharya&#8217;s origin is a proof. </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Fourthly, in this period children were born by magical methods e.g. origin of Draupadi. Therefore, in such a society what was the need for Niyog? </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">To give it a thought, under what rules Ved Vyas ji did Niyog and why did he do Niyog with three women at the same time?<span style="color:red;"><br />
</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Fifthly, why did Kunti give birth to 4 children by Niyog activity on contrary to the rules? Kunti gave birth to Karan, Yudhishtir, Bheem and Arjun and all of them were called as pandu. </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Sixthly, in those days when niyog was considered innocent and good then why did kunti float Karan in the river because of shame ?</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Seventhly, who were those men with whom kunti had Niyog and derived offspring? </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Swami ji has prohibited polygamy, where as its said that in that  in Mahabharata civilization &#8220;bahuvivah&#8221; was allowed. The society where swamiji has made niyog evident, should that only be considered as high and template?</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">In Sathyarth Prakash (doubt removal edition) Pandit Jwalaprasad Sharma produce few more examples in support of Niyoga. He says that in ancient period women used to derive off-springs by accepting the semen of Rishi-Munim, wise, great men by Niyog. All the evidences shown by Pandit ji are from Mahabharat period only. Was Mahabharat the only old (vaidik) period? Was Niyog the only need of Rishis?</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Its ironical that with the (vaidik) incantation Swami ji demonstrated niyog tradition  with same incantation (mantra) various wise men and lecturers have demonstrated widow remarriage . </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Pandit Omprakash has pointed, for widow remarriage, in his book <em>&#8220;vaidik sahitya aur sanskriti ka swaroop&#8221;</em> he has written that in vedic society there was  permission of widow remarriage.  In the mantra  ( rig ved 10-18-8)  he has given his summary as follows –</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">&#8220;Hey woman! Leaving this dead husband again make arrival into the living military. accept the future husband,  who wishes to marry you&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">It&#8217;s a whacking, shameful topic where a wise man and a society reformer should support remarriage and widow remarriage, but here the supposed reformers defend niyog practice and showed it useful for the future. Isn&#8217;t it&#8217;s a sign of a wiseman&#8217;s sleazy psychology? In the movies of today that show various stars, even in them we don&#8217;t get to see subject movies on these practices and favor. Leaving swami dayanand , all other wise men and reformers belonging to navjagrun ,favored remarriage.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">LET US NOW SUMMARIZE THE VIEW OF AGNIVEER AND SWAMI JI. READERS WILL SEE THAT AGNIVEER  IS TRYING TO HIDE THE TRUTH AND IS GOING AGAINST SWAMI JI AND ALSO SATYARTHA PRAKASH [APTLY MITHYA PRAKSH OR BIBLE OF HATE].<br />

</div>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">LET US SEE FEW MORE CLAIMS OF AGNIVEER </span><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><strong><span style="color:#002060;">CLAIM 1:</span> People have interpreted vedic verses to create social custom of Niyog to prevent prostitution in emergency situations.</strong><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">It is to be noted that only Swami Dayanand and Arya Samaj  who accept Niyog had interpreted Vedic verses in support of Niyog. I had provided a reference of Pandit Omkar who saw those texts as supporting widow remarriage.  Also Mr. Agniveer in his usual hateful style tries to attack the Muslims by saying, &#8220;The meaning of this mantra (Rig 10-18-8) provided has been slightly distorted and misinterpreted to suit one&#8217;s mindset of hatred.&#8221;<br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">Thus Agniveer is calling Swami Dayanand&#8217;s view as a <strong>mindset of hatred and suting his agenda</strong>. Cheers!<br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><strong>CLAIM 2: Niyog Pratha was a social custom to beget a child that <span style="text-decoration:underline;">was prevalent in all societies</span> and more so in Biblical and Quranic society.. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Bible, Quran and Hadiths are full of such references</span>. Prophet Muhammad is supposed to have the only son from his slave Maria</strong>.<br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">Having seens the laws of Niyog it is the height of shamelessness of agniveer to look for Niyog in  Islamic and Christian scriptures.<br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">Mother Mariah, was the WIFE of Prophet Muhammad as clearly mentioned in Hadith accounts. Agniveer as usual takes his readers for a ride by not providing any references.<br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><strong>CLAIM 3: Niyog is optional not compulsory and in emergency situation only.</strong><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">How ironical it is that pregnancy of wife becomes an emergency situation (as claimed by Swamiji)  and and Niyog is only gain a son even if a daughter is present? How pitiful?<br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">In conclusion, I want to assert that Niyog is a curse and bad practice, it cannot be suitable for any period. The state of a women in India was extremely pitiable. It  feels like certain rishis, munis and  other men made  certain rules and regulations, where in woman was treated like a breakfast pl<span style="color:black;">ate and and thing of lust only.</span> Niyog  tradition made a woman no less than a prostitute. Like you have already read above, a widow can have niyog with 10 men. The two words widow and prostitute if taken with the same meaning, it won&#8217;t be unfair. A movie called &#8220;water&#8221; released in 2000 which was picturized on the bad condition of  widow women which was controversial and was banned. The movie was based on historical facts where widows were shown as prostitutes. Since widowed women are considered as inauspicious, they go to pilgrimage places like Kaashi, Vrindavan etc and sing religious chants and beg to earn a living. Even in these days there are nearly 16000 widows living in Kaashi.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">Let us respect women, work for their empowerment and allow remarriage instead of this cursed practice of Niyog.<br />

<p style="color:#333333;">The destiny of nations is governed by their beliefs and ideas. How a nation treats its men and women also reflects their culture. Let us see the position of women in the Vedic Dharma.</p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">In the Vedas wherever special prayers have been made for children, they have always been for sons. Nowhere is a prayer or charm recited to be granted a daughter. For exmaple,</span></span></p>

In simple words ‘Niyog’ means sending a married woman or widow to a particular man for sexual intercourse so that she gets a son. Indication of this custom is available in Rig Veda.</span></span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span lang="EN" style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:black;"> In ‘Aadiparva’ of ‘Mahabharata’ (chapters 95 and 103), it is mentioned that Satyawati had appointed her son to bestow sons to the queens of Vichitrvirya, the younger brother of Bhishma, and as a result of which Dhartrashtra and Pandu were born. Pandu himself had asked his queen, Kunti, to have sexual intercourse with a Brahmin to get a son (Aadi Parva,’ chapters 120 to 123).</span></span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span lang="EN" style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:black;">It has been said in ‘Aadi Parva’ (chapters 64 and 104), that when Parshu Ram started killing the Kshatriyas, thousands of female Kshatriyas started going to Brahmins to get sons. Similar references are found at other places in ‘Mahabharata’ also. With regard to ‘Niyog’, there are detailed discussions at a number of places in other religious books.</span></span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span lang="EN" style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:black;">In Nirkut, the meaning of ‘dewar’ that is, husband’s younger brother, has been given as ‘Duvitya Var’ that is, the second husband (Nirukt 3:15).</span></span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span lang="EN" style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:black;">An ancient commentator of ‘Manu Smriti’ (Manu’s Code), Meghatithi has clearly accepted the existence of ‘Niyog‘ (quoted from ‘Dharam Shastra Ka Itihas’, by Bharatratan Mahamahopdhyay, Dr P.V. Kane, Part I, page 341).</span></span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span lang="EN" style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:black;">In the last century, Swami Dayanand Saraswati had claimed to have written a commentary free from defects in the interpretation, of the ancient commentators on the ‘Vedas.’ Dayanand had not only accepted the prevalence of ‘Niyog’ but also on the basic of ‘smritis’ (codes of traditional Hindu laws), discussed ‘Niyog’ in great detail in the language of the ‘Veda mantras’ (Vedic hymns). According to him there was a law that a woman or a man could have sexual intercourse with eleven persons. If no child was born from the one, then a woman could go to another. If even then she was unable to beget a child, then she could go to the third and so on till she had intercourse with eleven men (Dayanand’s commentary on Rig Veda, 10/85/45).</span></span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span lang="EN" style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:black;">Woman was sometimes even forced to have sexual intercourse with men in the custom of ‘Niyog’. ‘Devtas, Rishis, Munis’ and ‘Brahmins’ used to participate in ‘Niyog’ (see ‘Mahabharata Aadi Parv; chapters 64,95,103, 104).</span></span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><strong style="font-style:inherit;"><span lang="EN" style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:black;">Chastity of woman was not safe</span></strong></span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span lang="EN" style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:black;">In the name of ‘beejdan’ (seed donation), they used to have sexual intercourse with issueless women. This was a cruel religious custom and the chastity of women was not safe. The so-called caretakers of the religion were allowed to have sexual intercourse with another man’s wife. From ‘Niyog pratha’, it can be inferred without fear of contradiction that the women were looked upon as mere child-producing machines.</span></span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span lang="EN" style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:black;">In ‘The Position of Women in Hindu Civilization’, Dr Bhim Rao Ambedkar writes: “<em style="font-weight:inherit;">Though woman was married to a man, she was considered to be the property of the entire family. But she was not getting share out of the property of her husband, only the son could be the successor to property.”</em></span></span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span lang="EN" style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:black;">Gajdhar Prasad Baudh says: <em style="font-weight:inherit;">“No woman of the Vedic age can be treated as pure. Vedic men could not keep even the relations between brother-sister and father-daughter sacred from the oven of rape and debauchery / adultery named ‘Niyog’. Under the influence of intoxication of wine, they used to recognise neither sister nor daughter and also they did not keep in mind their relations with them. It is evident from their debauchery and adultery what the miserable plight of women was in the society then. (Refer ‘Arya Niti Ka Bhandaphor’, 5th edition page 14).</em></span></span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span lang="EN" style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:black;">Till such a time as these teachings have an overwhelming influence, the improvement in the position and status of the women is next to impossible.</span></span></span></p>
