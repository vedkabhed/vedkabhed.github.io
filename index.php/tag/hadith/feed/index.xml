<p>Written by Sulaiman Razvi</p>
<p>Hinduism is perhaps the only religion in the world which has a deity of liquor called Varuni and a god like Shiva associated with Bhang (cannabis). Intoxicant consumption is not unknown in Hindu society. In fact, intoxicants like Bhang and liquor have become ceremonial beverages during Hindu festivals like Holi and Diwali. Bhang (hemp/cannabis) in the form of drink is widely consumed by Hindus during the festival Holi. Even Sadhus spend their lives smoking weed to please their lord Shiva though it is in violation of NDPS act. Dr. B.R. Ambedkar wrote in his book Riddles in Hinduism, &#8220;The ancient Aryans were also a race of drunkards. Wine formed a most essential part of their religion. The Vedic Gods drank wine. The divine wine was called Soma. Since the Gods of the Aryans drank wine the Aryans had no scruples in the matter of drinking. Indeed to drink it was a part of an Aryan&#8217;s religious duty&#8230;Who were denied Soma drank Sura which was ordinary, unconsecrated wine sold in the market. Not only the male Aryans were addicted to drinking but the females also indulged in drinking. The Kaushitaki Grihya Sutra I.11-12 advises that four or eight women who are not widowed after having been regaled with wine and food should be called to dance for four times on the night previous to the wedding ceremony.&#8221;<br />
<span id="more-4848"></span></p>
<p>Consumption of liquor is clearly prohibited in Hindu scriptures and it is considered a great sin (Mahapataka) but some texts allow it under certain conditions, moreover, there are plenty of examples of Gods, Rishis and even Goddesses enjoying liquor. Some text even suggests the use of liquor for offering a libation to Hindu deities. There are approximately 11 types of liquors mentioned in Hindu scriptures such as Sura which is made from grains and was perhaps the most popular drink back then, Maireya which is Rum and made from treacle or molasses, Paista which is made from rice, Madhvika made from flowers, Madhuka made from honey, Panasa taken from jack fruit, Draksa made from grapes, Khajura sambhava made from date fruits, Nalikeraja prepared from coconut palm, Gaudi prepared from molasses, Arista which is a fermented liquor made from soapberry. Wine is praised in various ways in Hinduism, As per Agni Purana 84.1-2 dreaming about ‘wine in the night preceding the day of the ceremony, should be held as the most auspicious ones’, As per Srimad Bhagavatam 5.1.32-33 there are seven islands on Earth which are separated by seven oceans and the oceans are of salt water, sugarcane juice, wine, clarified butter, milk, curds and pure water.</p>
<p>Kumraila Bhatta a 8<sup>th</sup> century Hindu reformer observes, &#8220;Among the people of modern days we find the Brahmana women of the countries of Ahicchatra and Mathura to be addicted to drinking.&#8221; (Tantra-vartika, I.III.4). He condemned this practice in the case of Brahmins only, but not of Ksatriya and Vaisya men and women, if the liquor was distilled from fruits or flowers (Madhvi) and molasses (Gaudi) and not from grains (Sura). Madhavacharya in his Sankara Dig Vijaya Canto 15, verses 1-23 wrote that Adi Shankaracharya along with King Sudhanva traveled to Karnataka where they happened to confront Kapalikas a Shaivite sect who were engaged in drinking liquor in their worship like the Saktas. Then they had a debate on the issue. Which shows that Sadhus consumed liquor in 8<sup>th</sup> century also. Consumption of liquor by Kapalin (Shaivite sect of Hinduism) is much older than this, It is mentioned in Skanda Purana I.i.1.33-34 that Kapalins were engaged in drinking liquor. Liquor or cannabis consumption is not a taboo in the Shaivite sect because of that they are censured by Vaishnavite Hindus. Srimad Bhagavatam a Vaishnavite Purana censures Kapalins in the following way,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 4.2.28-29 “One who takes a vow to satisfy Lord Śiva or who follows such principles will certainly become an atheist and be diverted from transcendental scriptural injunctions. Those who vow to worship Lord Śiva are so foolish that they imitate him by keeping long hair on their heads. When initiated into worship of Lord Śiva, they prefer to live on wine, flesh and other such things.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p><strong>Swami Prabhupada wrote</strong>: “It is sometimes seen that devotees of Lord Śiva imitate the characteristics of Lord Śiva. For example, Lord Śiva drank an ocean of poison, so some of the <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">followers of Lord Śiva imitate him and try to take intoxicants like gāñjā (marijuana)</span>. Here the curse is that if someone follows such principles he must become an infidel and turn against the principles of Vedic regulation. It is said that such devotees of Lord Śiva will be sac-chāstra-paripanthinaḥ, which means “opposed to the conclusion of śāstra, or scripture.’…” <strong>Swami Prabhupada on Srimad Bhagavatam 4.2.28</strong> <a href="http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_4.2.28" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_4.2.28<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>

<h1>Definition of Sura &amp; Asura</h1>
<p>Devas in Hinduism are also called Sura and their enemies i.e. Demons are called Asuras, In later texts like Itihaas and Purana the definition of Sura and Asura given is that the Devas were imbibers of wine hence they were called Sura (literal meaning is liquor) and the demons did not accept liquor hence they were called A-Sura. As per stories mentioned in Hindu texts, Varuni (liquor) was born during the second churning of the ocean (Samundra Manthan) by Devas and Danavas. The Devas accepted her while the Danavas rejected her.</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana, Lalita-Mahatmya 9.66-69 &#8220;When the ocean of Milk was once again churned by the Devas and Danavas, goddess Varuni with tremulous eyes on account of inebriety, rose up even as the Siddhas in the firmament began to think &#8216;What is this&#8217;? She smilingly stood in front of the Asuras. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Daityas did not accept her. </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Therefore</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> they become Asuras</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">They were given the appellation Asura in the sense &#8216;Those who do not have Sura (liquor)</span>&#8216;. Thereupon, she stood in front of Devas. On the direction given by paramesthin (Brahma) Deva joyously accepted her. In view of the fact that they accepted Sura, they became glorified by the appellation Sura.&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Ramayana of Valmiki, Bala Kanda 1, Sarga 45, verses 36-37 &#8220;Oh, Rama, the sons of Diti, namely asuraa-s, have not espoused that daughter of Rain-god, but oh, brave Rama, the sons of Aditi on their part, namely sura-s, have espoused that impeccable Vaaruni. Thereby the sons of Diti are called a suraa-s, and the sons of Aditi are called suraa-s, and gods are delighted and rejoiced on espousing Vaaruni.&#8221; Tr. Desiraju Hanumanta Rao</p>
<p>Mahabharata mentions the vow of Asura which was to abstain from drinking alcohol,</p>
<p>Mahabharata Vana Parva 3, Section 255&#8243;&#8230;And I shall observe the Asura vow&#8230;&#8221; Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Kisari Mohan Ganguli writes, &#8220;The vow of the Asuras was (according to the Burdwan Pundits) never to drink wine&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m03/m03255.htm#fn_83" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m03/m03255.htm#fn_83<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>Varuni is the liquor deity of Hinduism, some texts calls her the wife of Varuna and some considers her the daughter of Varuna. Wine was born after churning of the ocean as per Hindu texts,</p>
<p>Mahabharata Udyoga Parva 5, Section 102 “…<span style="color: #000000;">The gods, uniting with the Asuras, and making the Mandara mountain their pole, churned the waters of the ocean and obtained the wine called Varuni…” Tr. K.M. Ganguli </span></p>
<p>Mahabharata Udyoga Parva 5, Section 98 “…<span style="color: #000000;">Behold now, O companion of the Lord of the celestials, that abode, made entirely of gold, and full of the wine called </span><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Varuni</em></span><span style="color: #000000;">. Indeed, having obtained that wine, the gods acquired their god-heads…” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Consumption of Alcohol by Gods and Goddesses</h1>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Rama &amp; Sita</span></strong></p>
<p>Rama the Maryada Purshottom (ideal man) is said to have made his wife Sita drink wine and then enjoyed the dance of women,</p>
<p>Ramayana of Valmiki, Uttarakhanda 7, Sarga 42, Verses 18-23 &#8220;Like unto Purandara with Sachi <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">he took Sita by the hand, made her sit and drink the wine</span> distilled in the province of Mira. And in no time the servants brought for him <span style="color: #ff0000;">well-cooked meat</span> and various fruits. Being inebriate the beautiful <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Apsaras, well-skilled in the art of singing and dancing, began to dance before Rama</span> in the company of Kinnaris. The virtuous souled Rama, the foremost of those who know how to please, satisfied those beautiful damsels adorned with various ornaments.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">This verse appears in the 52nd Sarga of M.N. Dutt&#8217;s translation but actually, it is supposed to be in the 42nd Sarga. Following is another English translation by Hindu scholar Hari Prasad Shastri,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Valmiki Ramayana, Uttarakhanda 7, Sarga 42, Verses 18-23 &#8220;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Taking Sita by the hand, Kakutstha gave her delicious wine made of distilled honey to drink</span>, as formerly Puandara had offered to Sachi. Thereafter pure viands and fruits of every kind were brought by servants, whilst lovely Apsaras, skilled in the arts of singing and dancing, began to perform in the Prince&#8217;s presence and troops of Nymphs and Uragas, surrounded by the Kinneris intoxicated with wine, danced before Kakutstha, and the virtuous Rama, the most captivating of warriors, delighted those ravishing and charming women.&#8221; Tr. Hari Prasad Shastri</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Following is the Hindi translation with Sanskrit text by Chaturvedi Dwaraka Prasad Sharma,</span></p>

<p>The Sanskrit word mentioned here is Madhu Maireya which is a type of liquor made from honey, Panini defines the word Madhu Maireya as,</p>
<p>Ashtadhyaya Panini, Book VI, Ch 11, verse 70 &#8220;&#8230;Thus ग्रुंडमेरेय: &#8216;the wine maireya prepared from treacle or molasses&#8217;. <span style="color: #ff0000;">मधुमैरेय:</span> &#8216;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">maireya prepared from honey</span>&#8216;. Why do we say when denoting &#8216;an ingredient?&#8217; Observe परममैरेय: Why do we say &#8216;before मेरेय?&#8217; Observe पुष्पासव: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Every sort of spirituous liquor except</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> सुरा</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">is called </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">मेरेय</span>.” Tr. Srisa Chandra Vasu</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="989" height="257" class="wp-image-8880 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Ashtadhyayi-Panini-6.jpeg" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Ashtadhyayi-Panini-6.jpeg 989w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Ashtadhyayi-Panini-6-300x78.jpeg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Ashtadhyayi-Panini-6-768x200.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 989px) 100vw, 989px" /></p>
<p>The above passage also makes the definition of the word Sura (सुरा) clear. Swami Vivekananda wrote,</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p>“…Instances are found in the Râmâyana and the Mahâbhârata of the drinking of wine and the taking of meat by Rama and Krishna, whom they worship as God. Sita Devi vows meat, rice, and a thousand jars of wine to the river-goddess, Gangâ!”<br />
<a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Complete_Works_of_Swami_Vivekananda/Volume_5/Writings:_Prose_and_Poems/The_East_and_The_West/Food_and_Cooking" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Complete_Works_of_Swami_Vivekananda/Volume_5/Writings:_Prose_and_Poems/The_East_and_The_West/Food_and_Cooking<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p></blockquote>
<p>When Hanuman met Sita in the Ashok Vatika, he informed Sita about the condition of Rama, he told Sita that Rama has given up consumption of liquor and meat due to the grief of being separated from her,</p>
<p>Ramayana of Valmiki, Sundara Khanda 5, Sarga 36, verse 41 &#8220;Rama is not eating meat, nor indulging even in spirituous liquor. Everyday, in the evening, he is eating the food existing in the forest, well arranged for him.&#8221; Tr. K.M.K. Murthy</p>
<p>We know that Rama was a meat-eater, when he was about to go to Vanvaas (exile into the forest) he lamented that he would have to live in the forest without meat. So this verse indicates that Rama also consumed liquor. A verse from Ayodhya Kanda of Valmiki Ramayana states that Sita vowed to offer hundred cups of wine to the goddess if her wish is fulfilled,</p>
<p>Ramayana of Valmiki, Ayodhya Kanda 2, Sarga 55, verses 19-20 &#8220;Having come near the middle of the Kalindi, Sita prayed unto her, saying, &#8216;Hail to thee, O goddess! I cross thee. If my husband can successfully perform his vow. I will worship thee with a thousand cows and a hundred vessels of wine.&#8221; Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Hanuman</span></strong></p>
<p>The ardent Bhakt of Rama is also said to have taken intoxicants,</p>
<p>Mahabharata Vana Parva 3, Section 145, Verse 86 “…The powerful Hanuman, however, opening his eyes partially looked at him (Bhima) with disregard, with eyes reddened with intoxication&#8230;” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Krishna</span> </strong></p>
<p>In the Mahabharata, Sanjay describes Krishna and Arjuna in the company of Draupadi and Satyabhama (wife of Krishna and an incarnation of Bhudevi), exhilarated by Bassia wine,</p>
<p>Mahabharata, Udyog Parva 5, Section 59, verses 2-5 &#8220;Sanjaya said, &#8216;Listen, O king, as I tell thee the state in which I found Krishna and Dhananjaya. I will also, O Bharata, tell thee what those heroes said; O king, with looks bent down and hands joined together, and with senses well restrained, I entered the inner apartments for conferring with those gods among men. Neither Abhimanyu nor the Twins can repair to that place where <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">are the two Krishnas and Draupadi and lady Satyabhama. There I beheld those chastisers of foes, exhilarated with Bassia wine</span>, their bodies adorned with garlands of flowers.” Tr. Kisari Mohan Ganguli</p>
<p>Renowned Hindu scholar Kumarila Bhatta explained this verse of Mahabharata and justified it by saying that by drinking wine Krishna and Arjuna didn’t transgress the law. Kumarila Bhatta wrote that Sura (prepared from grain) is prohibited whereas Krishna and Arjuna drank Madhu which is not prohibited and that Kshatriyas and Vaishyas can have Madhu and Sidhi (types of liquors made from honey and molasses),</p>
<p>Tantra Vartika, Adhyaya 1, Pada III, Adhi 4(a) “Then remains the case of Krshna and Arjuna being drunk with wine, and having married the daughters of their respective maternal uncles, both being instances of direct transgressions of the law. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">But it is only the wine distilled from grains, which is called &#8216;Sura&#8217;, that is prohibited for the three higher castes;</span> says the Smrti: &#8216;Sura is the impure essence of the grains and it is evil that is spoken of as impure; hence the Brahmana, the Kshatriya and the Vaicya should never drink Sura.&#8217; <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">As for the particular wines &#8216;Madhu&#8217; (wine distilled from certain fruits, as grapes and the like), and the &#8216;Sidhu&#8217; (that distilled from molasses), these are not prohi</span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">bited for the Kshatriya and the </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Vaicya</span>, as &#8216;all intoxicating drinks&#8217; have been prohibited for the Brahmana alone. Though there is a passage that declares &#8216;all the three kinds of wine, the Gaudi (that distilled from molasses) Paishthi (that distilled from grains) and Madhu (distilled from fruits), being the same, they should not be drunk by the Brahmavadis,&#8217; yet here the word &#8216;Brahmavadi&#8217; should be taken as denoted the Brahmanas only, as the word literally means &#8216;one who is capable of teaching Brahma,&#8217; or &#8216;whose duty it is to teach Brahma&#8217;, or &#8216;whose excellence lies in such teaching&#8217;, and as the root &#8216;Vada&#8217; is synonymous with &#8216;Bru&#8217; such duties are distinctly restricted to the Brahmana alone, by such texts as &#8216;from among the three higher castes, the Brahmana alone should teach&#8217;&#8230;Hence we take the passage &#8216;All the three kinds of wine, etc,&#8217; to mean that just as the one, Sura distilled from grains, is not drinkable by the three higher castes, so are all the three undrinkable by the Brahmana otherwise, if the simple prohibition of wine in general were meant, then the words &#8216;Yathava, etc.,&#8217; and &#8216;Brahmavadibhih&#8217; would be totally redundant. The mention of &#8216;the three castes&#8217; we shall supply from out of another verse. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">For this reason, the fact of Krshna and Arjuna both Kshatriyas being intoxicated with &#8216;Madhu&#8217; (grape wine) is in no way a transgression of the law</span>. And, as a matter of fact, we have Vedic texts that distinctly show (1) that the prohibition of wine is for others (i.e, Brahmanas), and also (2) that is distinctly permissible (in the case of others)&#8230;hence the Brahmana should not drink the wine; lest he be attached to evil&#8217;, and (2) &#8216;The Kshatriya should say to the Brahmana &#8216;the drinking of wine does no harm to him who knows this&#8217;, and this latter is with the reference to the &#8216;Madhu&#8217; and the &#8216;Sidhu&#8217; (and not the &#8216;Sura&#8217; which is in no case allowed to anyone else but the Cudra)&#8230;” Tr. Ganganath Jha</p>
<p>As far as my opinion is concerned, Even Sura is not prohibited for Brahmins as Vedas the eternal law for Hindus gives instructions on the consumption of Sura for Brahmins and Kshatriyas. Padma Purana states that Krishna used to drink wine in the company of his wives who also enjoyed wine,</p>
<p>Padma Purana V.89.53-59a &#8220;Then the two, O brahmana, being tired due to many pastimes proper for the times in the groves endowed with vernal breezes on all sides, resort, with their attendants, to the root of a tree, and sitting on a divine seat, drink liquor, O best sage. Then the two, intoxicated due to the liquor, with their eyes closed due to sleep, holding each other&#8217;s hands, being under the influence of Cupid&#8217;s arrows, and desiring to sport, enter, with their words and mind stumbling on the path. There they sport like a female elephant and (the male elephant) the lord of the herd. All the friends also, intoxicated by wine, and with their eyes troubled by sleep (i.e. drowsy) sleep all around in the charming bowers. Again and again incited by his beloved, Krsna, the lord, would go near all, with a separate body (for each) and simultaneously. Having satisfied all of them as a lord of elephants satisfies the female elephants, he would, along with his beloved and with them, go to the lake to sport.&#8221; Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p>A story mentioned in Skanda and Samba Purana goes like this, Narada Muni visited Krishna, and all the Yadu boys received him with their heads bowed down in respect but Samba the son of Krishna didn’t greet him properly, So Narada thought of teaching him a lesson. So he told Krishna that his 16100 wives were sexually attracted to Samba. Krishna doesn’t believe him. Then Narada visits him again after a gap of a few days, there he sees that Krishna along with his wives were engaged in drinking liquor. Narada takes this as an opportunity to teach Samba a lesson so he tells Samba that his father i.e. Krishna is calling him. Samba goes there and sits next to his father Krishna. Intoxicated wives of Krishna becomes sexually aroused seeing the handsome boy and their private parts becomes moistened so much that even their underwear becomes drenched due to arousal. Then suddenly Narada Muni enters the place and all the wives of Krishna gets up to pay respect to Narada Muni and then all their dresses slip from their bodies including their wet underwear. Krishna then curses his wives. So it shows that Krishna used to quaff liquor along with his wives, story mentioned in Skanda Purana is too long, I have tried my best to shorten it while the Samba Purana is a summarized version by Wendy Doniger. The Skanda Purana verse also states that Samba used to enjoy liquor and had illicit relationships with women,</p>
<p>Samba Purana 3.6-55 &#8220;One day Narada came to Dvaraka to see Krsna. All the Yadu boys received him with respect, but Samba, proud of his young beauty and deluded by the fated, inevitable force of the curse, disregarded Narada. To teach Samba a lesson, Narada told Krsna that all of Krsna&#8217;s sixteen thousand wives were in love with Samba. Samba was summoned, and the women, whose minds were blurred by wine, showed inmistakable signs of passion when Samba appeared&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Skanda Purana Book VII, Section I, Chapter 101, verses 1-38 &#8220;At this very juncture (came) venerable sage Narada&#8230;In the court of his wandering at will, he always used to come to Dvaravati to pay a visit to Vasudeva. As he came on quickly all the Yadava youths beginning with Pradyumna remained with their heads (politely) bent down&#8230;but Samba due to the inevitability of the curse, slighted the noble souled Narada as usual. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Being very proud of his youth and handsome features he was forever indulgent in sexual dalliance and liquor</span>. On seeing him impolite and rude, Narada thought thus: Today I shall try to curb this impolite one&#8230;After thinking thus, he spoke to Vasudeva: O most excellent one among Devas, here there are sixteen thousand women. O my Lord, their emotional fondness for Samba is much&#8230;On hearing these words from Narada, Kesava began to think. What has thus been mentioned by Narada may have some truth in it&#8230;Narada went away as he came. A few days thereafter, he returned to Dvaraka. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">On that day the Lord was engaged in drinking liquor after enjoying aquatic sports along with all the members of his Antahpura (inner </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">apartment)&#8230;</span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Staying </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">there the Lord drank the liquor of great auspicious flavour</span>. In the meantime, fully aware that the <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">women were inebriated due to liquor</span>, Narada spoke to Samba: &#8216;O princely youth, do come and stand here. The Lord calls you. It is not proper on my part to stay on there.&#8217; Urged by Narada&#8230;Samba entered quickly and bowed down to his father. He took the seat pointed out by Visnu with natural feeling. In the meantime those women there who were deficient in self control became highly agitated as soon as they saw Samba. As they were staying within the Antahpura so long, they had not seen him before. The liquor had its own effect in making them forget everything. Further they were naturally devoid of self control. Hence their loins became moistened. On seeing an excellent man, the excellent organ of generation of women becomes moistened and dump even if they are observing celibacy or are Yoginis&#8230;After sending Samba in, Narada also came hurriedly closely on the heels of Samba. On seeing the sage coming with pleasant manners, all those women suddenly got up; they were tipsy. Even as Vasudeva was watching, when they got up suddenly their valuable garments got torn and fell down into the pots (of liquor). The clothes clinging to their loins (underwear) also fell separately. On seeing it Hari became angry, he cursed those women: O women, since your minds strayed elsewhere unmindful of me, you will not get into the regions occupied by your husband at the close of your life. Slipping down from the world of your husband as well as from the path of heaven, you will have no refuge and will fall into the clutches of robbers. As a result of this defect and curse, those women, at the time of Krsna&#8217;s heavenward departure, were abducted by robbers belonging to Pancanada even as Arjuna was looking on.&#8221; Tr. Ganesh Vasudeo Tagare</p>
<p>Mahabharata Virata Parva 4, Section 72, Verses 19-28 &#8220;And Krishna gave unto each of the illustrious sons of Pandu numerous female slaves, and gems and robes. And then the nuptial festival set in between the families of the Matsya king and the Pandavas. And then conchs and cymbals and horns and drums and other musical instruments appointed by the Pandavas, began to play in the palace of Virata. And deer of various kinds and clean animals by hundreds were slain. And wines of various kinds and intoxicating juices of trees were profusely collected.&#8221; Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Krishna in the following verse is mentioned as Rama,</p>
<p>Skanda Purana VII.I.202.10-11 &#8220;Rama with the plough as his weapon, went to the city of Dvaravati teeming with delighted and contented people. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">There he indulged in a drunken bout with the persons (ladies) </span>of his Antahpura. After imbibing wine, he seized a mace with his hand and went to the splendid garden of Raivatodyana accompanied by Revati and others. Moving in the midst of groups of women, he went along with faltering steps like an inebriated person&#8230;&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Skanda Purana VII.I.202.31-32 &#8220;The Brahmanas assembled there, were well-versed in the Puranas and were glad to listen to the stories and conducts of the primordial celestial sages. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">On seeing Rama with eyes reddened due to drinking wine</span> they thought, &#8216;He is thoroughly drunk&#8217;, and hurriedly got up and began to honour and adore Halayudha excepting Suta who continued to sit.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Suta kills the Brahmins so Krishna feels the guilt of drinking wine, vows to abstain from wine drinking and also orders corporal punishment to those guilty of drinking wine therefrom. But was the law ever implemented? Because his beloved brother Balrama was addicted to wine and Krishna’s son Samba and grandson Pradumnya is also said to have relished wine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Balarama</strong></p>
<p>Krishna’s brother Balarama was addicted to drinking liquor, several texts mentions this habit of Balarama,</p>
<p>Brahma Purana 90.5-7 &#8220;Roaming about that spot Balarama inhaled the intensive odour of wine. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">After smelling it he experienced the delight that he previously used to have in wine</span>. O sages, thereafter, Balarama saw a current of liquor suddenly falling form Kadamba. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">He derived great joy therefrom. He drank it joyously</span> in the company of cowherds and cowherdesses&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Harivamsa Purana, Visnu Parva 2.41.5-13 &#8220;Then the valiant, auspicious Sankarsana (Balarama), appearing like an elephant roamed on the peak of the mountain, without Krishna. He went under the shade of the kadamba (Nauclea Cadamba) tree, fully blossomed, enjoying the breeze with a faint smell, comfortably. While he was enjoying the breeze there, the smell of (vinous) spirituous liquor entered his nose. Immediately he was affected by the desire to have Varuni, (spirituous liquor). His face appeared dim like the face of an intoxicated person in the afternoon. Then the lord immediately remembered the ancient incident of partaking Amrita (nectar). Then, searching for spirituous liquor, he saw that tree. The water from the rain clouds, showered on the fully blossomed, beautiful tree became the spirituous liquor in the hollows of the tree. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">After drinking that liquor again and again with desire, his body was swaying with intoxication</span>. The eyes on the face of the intoxicated Balarama, with the colour of the moon in winter, started moving and rolling. Born in the hollows of kadamba, that liquor named KdambarI (kadamba liquor) is Varuni in the body form, the nectar liquor of the deva-s.&#8221; Tr. A. Purushothaman and A. Harindranath</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 5.251-11 “Varuńa, in order to provide for his recreation, said to his wife Váruńí (the goddess of wine), &#8220;Thou, Madirá, art ever acceptable to the powerful Ananta; go therefore, auspicious and kind goddess, and promote his enjoyments.&#8221; Obeying these commands, Váruní went and established herself in the hollow of a Kadamba tree in the woods of Vrindávana. Baladeva, roaming about, came there, and smelling the pleasant fragrance of liquor, resumed his ancient passion for strong drink. The holder of the ploughshare observing the vinous drops distilling from the Kadamba tree, was much delighted, and gathered and quaffed them along with the herdsmen and the Gopís, whilst those who were skilful with voice and lute celebrated him in their songs. Being inebriated with the wine…Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>

He was singing amidst a crowd of young women, and since <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">He had drunk vāruṇī liquor</span>, His eyes rolled as if He were intoxicated. His body shone brilliantly as He behaved like an elephant in rut…Angered, Lord Balarāma, the best of fighters, hurled a rock at him, but the cunning ape dodged the rock and grabbed the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Lord’s pot of liquor</span>. Further infuriating Lord Balarāma by laughing and by ridiculing Him, wicked Dvivida then broke the pot and offended the Lord even more by pulling at the girls’ clothing. Thus the powerful ape, puffed up with false pride, continued to insult Śrī Balarāma.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Harivamsa Purana 2.46.21-23 &#8220;Meanshile, Gopas, knowledgeable about the place and time, presented the liquor, Varuni to Balarama, the learned soul. At that time, Balarama drank (the liquor) surrounded by the acquaintances. Balarama, who had gone to the interior of the forest drank the stimulating liquor.&#8221; Tr. A. Purushothaman and A. Harindranath</p>
<p>Brahma Purana 84.34-45 &#8220;There in the waters of Yamuna he saw Balarama with a thousand hoods&#8230;His ear-rings were fine.

Next they offered her food containing all good qualities, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">and a sweet inebriating drink called āsavam</span>.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Swami Prabhupada insists that Asava is not liquor but an Ayurvedic drink made from herbs, but then he translates the same word Asava as beer in Srimad Bhagavatam 4.18.16.</p>
<p>Matangi is one of the Mahavidyas, ten Tantric goddesses and a ferocious aspect of Devi, the Hindu Divine Mother. She is considered to be the Tantric form of Sarasvati,</p>
<p>Skanda Purana III.ii.18.146-7 &#8220;They should perform four circumambulations. The couple should cover themselves with a silken cloth and go ahead. After sprinkling water over Matangi the excellent Madhvika (honey that intoxicates) should be taken. The intelligent devotee should worship Matangi with vacal and instrumental music.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-size: 16pt;">RISHIS</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Dattatreya</span></strong></p>
<p>The Markandeya Purana tells us that once when the gods were defeated by the demons in a battle, they approached Brihaspati for help. Brihaspati sent them to Muni Dattatreya the son of Rishi Atri. When the gods approached Dattatreya, they found him drinking wine in the company of Lakshmi with whom he also had sex. The gods prayed to him for help, but he pointed out his own faults, drinking, attachment, affection and sexual enjoyment of women. But then the gods told him that he is sinless and he is not stained by these acts,</p>
<p>Markandeya Purana 18.23-32 &#8220;Thus exhorted the gods then went to <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Dattatreya&#8217;s hermitage, and they beheld the high-souled Muni, attended by Lakshmi</span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">hymned by Gandharvas and engrossed in </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">quaffing spirituous liquor</span>&#8230;Daddatreya addressed the prostrate gods, &#8216;What desire ye of me, that ye do me this obeisance&#8230;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">I am drinking strong drink</span>, I have remnants of food in my mouth, nor I subdued my senses. How is it, O gods, ye seek for victory over your enemies even from me?&#8217; <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The gods spoke. Thou art sinless</span>, O lord of the world; no stain hast thou, into whose heart, purified by the ablution of learning, has entered the light of knowledge. True is this, o gods! all learning have I, who am impartial in view: <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">but by reason of association with this woman</span> I am now impure after eating. For commerce with women when continually pursued tends to depravity. Thus addressed, the gods then spoke again. This woman, O sinless brahman! is the mother of the world; she is not depraved&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Lakshmi was present there and then he tells the gods that he had copulation with this woman (i.e. Lakshmi), Padma Purana tells us that Dattatreya had sex with Lakshmi though it doesn’t mention Lakshmi but the above verse attests to this statement,</p>
<p>Padma Purana II.103.110-113 &#8220;Atri&#8217;s son Dattatreya, the high-souled brahmana, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">the great sage, with his eyes red due to (having drunk) spirituous liquor, was sporting with a woman</span>. The virtuous one, intoxicated by wine, having seated a young, auspicious woman, best of all women, on his lap, sang, danced and heavily drank liquor&#8230;&#8221; Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p>Another verse shows that Dattatreya asked a king to bring him some meat and wine and the king presented the same,</p>
<p>Padma Purana II.103.124-8 &#8220;When a long time of many days passed, Dattatreya, in an intoxicated condition, said to the best king: &#8216;Do as I tell you. Give me wine in a cup; and the meal of flesh that is got cooked.&#8217; Hearing those words of him, that Ayu, the lord of the earth, being eager, speedily got wine in a cup, and quickly cut off well-cooked flesh with his hand, and, O best one, the best king, gave these to Dattatreya. That best sage became happy in mind&#8230;&#8221; Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Kashyapa</span></strong></p>
<p>According to Puranas, Kashyapa was a drunkard, he was addicted to wine and thus he was given the name Kashya (wine) + Hasya (laughter),</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana 2.3.1.120-1 &#8220;When Daksa was over-bearing in his speech in regard to his daughters, the holy lord became angry. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Then he drank Kasya. Liquor is called by the name Kasya</span>. The word Kasi should be understood to have the sense of Hasya (Humour, wit). The speech and mind are mentioned by the word Kasya. Liquor is remembered by Brahmanas by means of the word Kasya. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The sage is called Kasyapa due to his drinking liquor</span>.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Vayu Purana, Section II, Ch 4, verse 114-5 &#8220;Kasyapa was the knower of the sun (?) Hence he was on a par with Brahma. In every Manvantara, he is born through a part of Brahma. The subjects were angered by Daksa, it is said (?) for the sake of (his) daughters. Then he drank wine. The word &#8216;Kasya&#8217; means wine. Hascekasa should be known as Brahma&#8217;s Kasya. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Kasya is remembered by Brahmanas as wine. Because he drank Kasya (wiine) he is called Kasyapa</span>.&#8221; Tr. G.P. Bhatt, edited by G.V. Tagare</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Consumption by Kings</span></strong></p>
<p>Liquor drinking seems to have been part of the life of nobles in the Vedic and Puranik period, there are some references to the consumption of liquor by kings,</p>

When thou, with might <span style="text-decoration: underline;">hadst drunk the draught that gladdens</span>, Sarasvatī, O Maghavan, refreshed thee.” Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>Griffith has translated the word Sura as draught here. These verses are also repeated in Yajur Veda 20.76-78 where Griffith has mentioned the word Sura in his translation and I have further explained it in this article in the Sautramani sacrifice category. These verses are elaborated in Baudhayana Srauta Sutra,</p>
<p>Baudhayana Srauta Sutra XVII.35 &#8220;…The Maitravruna recites as the puronuvakya the verse, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">&#8216;O Asvins the guardians of the auspicious, do you two partaking of the Sura-soma in association with the demon Namuci help Indra in his deeds</span>.&#8217; Having crossed the alter and having caused to announce, he says (to the Maitravaruna), &#8216;Do you impel (the Hotr to recite the yajya for the Sura-soma set forth for the Asvins, Sarasvati and Sutraman Indra.&#8217; The Maitravaruna pronounces the call, &#8216;Let the Hotr recite the yajya for the Asvins, Sarasvati and Sutraman Indra. These Sura-soma (o gods) set forth for you-powerful, exhilerating, prepared out of the mixture&#8230;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">May the Avins, Sarasvati and Sutraman Indra the Vrtra-killer enjoy them; may they drink the sweet wine</span>, become exhilarated and enjoy. O Hotr, do you recite the yajya. The Hotr recites the yajya, &#8216;O Asvins, do you favour us with your deed like the parents their son. O Indra, when thou didst consume the Sura-soma in order to achieve good deeds and to possess powers, Sarasvati healed thee&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Chintaman Ganesh Kashikar</p>

<h2><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sautramani and Rajasuya Sacrifices</span></strong></h2>
<p>Wine and Soma are used in the Sautramani sacrifice. Yajur Veda chapters 19 and 21 deal with offering and consumption of Sura (liquor) and Soma mixture in sacrifices like Sautramani, Rajasuya and offerings to departed manes. Satapatha Brahmana, Kanda 12, Adhayaya 7, Brahmana 3, Verses 1-22 describes the Sautramani ritual. It is stated in the same chapter in verse 4 that Sautramani is to be performed to get rid of enemies. Yajur Veda describes the Sautramani sacrifice which is further elaborated in the Srauta Sutra and Brahmana. Indra, Ashwins, Saraswati, and Agni were the first to perform this sacrifice, Veda states that they quaffed Sura-Soma mixture. And that’s how this sacrifice started, Sura-Soma mixture is offered to deities as well as to one&#8217;s ancestors and it is to be consumed by the Brahmin priests as well.</p>
<p><strong>Preparation of Sura (liquor) in the Sautramani sacrifice</strong></p>
<p>Baudhayana Srauta Sutra XXVI.22 &#8220;The Sura to be prepared for the Sautramani contains the grains as one fourth part or one fifth part, sprouting grass and young blades: The sprouting grass is of barley and young blades are of paddy. Beans are intended for fermentation. Now this filtering basket is wooden or of split bamboo or earthen; it has however a leather spread over it. This (sacrificer) is one who has pressed Soma and who has also filtered wine. The pressing leads him to the yonder world; the filtering of wine grants him welfare here.&#8221; Tr. C.G. Kashikar</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana, Kanda 12, Adhayaya 8, Brahmana 2, verses 8-11 &#8220;The malted rice, indeed, is of the form of the morning-pressing, for the morning-pressing is this (terrestrial) world, and the latter relates to the Asvins, and Âsvina milk he pours (into the Surâ-liquor) the first night: he thus provides him (the Sacrificer 1) with the morning-pressing&#8211;with its own world, with its own deity, with its own form. And the malted barley is of the form of the midday-pressing, for the midday-pressing is the air, and the latter relates to Sarasvatî and the Sârasvata milk he pours (into the Surâ) the second night: he thus provides him with the midday-pressing&#8211;with its own world, with its own deity, with its own form. And the fried rice is of the form of the evening-pressing, for the evening-pressing is the sky, and the latter relates to Indra, and Aindra milk he pours (into the Surâ) the third night: he thus provides him with the evening-pressing&#8211;with its own world, with its own deity, with its own form. The milk of one (cow) he pours (into the Surâ) the first night, the milk of two the second night, and the milk of three the third night: he thus provides him with the pressings, in accordance with their forms, and in accordance with their deities.&#8221; Tr. Julius Eggeling</p>

<p><strong>Details on the offering of Sautramani Sacrifice</strong></p>
<p>I will be mentioning some verses from Yajur Veda chapter 19 and I will also add elaborations of those verses from Satapatha Brahmana, Baudhayana Srauta Sutra and Sankhayana Srauta Sutra. I will underline those sentences of Brahmana and Srauta Sutra which are taken from the Vedas.</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 19.1 &#8220;Sweet with the sweet, I sprinkle thee with Soma, strong with the strong, the nectar with the nectar, the honey-sweet with what is sweet as honey, Soma art thou. Get dressed for the Asvins. Get dressed for Sarasvati. Get dressed for Indra and the Good Deliverer.&#8221; Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith<br />

<p>Above Hindi translation is by Swami Karpatri Maharaj. This verse elaborated in Satapatha Brahmana as,</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana, Kanda 12, Adhyaya 7, Brahmana 3, Verses 5-6 “With (Vâg. S. XIX, 1), <span style="text-decoration: underline;">&#8216;Thee, the sweet (liquor I mix) with the sweet (Soma)</span>,&#8217; <span style="color: #ff0000;">he compounds (the ingredients for the preparation of) the Surâ-liquor, and makes it </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">palatable</span>;&#8211;&#8216;the strong with the strong,&#8217; he thereby bestows energy on him (the Sacrificer);&#8211;&#8216;the immortal with the immortal,&#8217; he thereby bestows life on him &#8216;the honeyed with the honeyed,&#8217; he thereby bestows flavour to it (the liquor);&#8211;&#8216;I mix with the Soma,&#8217; he thereby makes it (the Surâ-liquor) a form of Soma. &#8216;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Thou art Soma: get thee matured for the Asvins! get thee matured for Sarasvatî! get thee matured for Indra Sutrâman!</span>&#8216; for these were the deities who first prepared that sacrifice, and with their help he now prepares it; and, moreover, he thereby provides these deities with their share. He distils it with a view to (its being like) the Soma-pressing. For three nights it remains standing, for the Soma remains standing for three nights after it has been bought: he thus makes it a form of Soma.” Tr. Julius Eggeling</p>
<p>Mahidhara a commentator on Veda writes on Yajur Veda 19.1 about the preparation of the Sura,</p>
<p>“Having purchased (a) malted rice (sashpa), malted barley (tokma), and fried rice (lâgâh), and (b) various vegetable substances (called with the generic name of nagnahu) serving as spices and ferments, such as the bark of Vatica robusta, three myrobalans (nutmeg, areca-nut, and cloves), ginger, hog-weed, &amp;c., he takes them into the fire-house, and pounds the two lots separately. He then prepares two gruels or mashes of rice and millet respectively, adding more water than is ordinarily used, puts them on the fire till they boil over, and catches the overflowing water in two separate vessels. He then acids thereto one-third part of the (still separate) pounded malted rice and barley and fried rice (or one-sixth part into each vessel), and likewise one-half of the spice (or one-fourth part into each vessel): this mixture, called mâsara (serving both as malt and as flavouring matter), is allowed to dry and is then pounded. One-half of the remaining pounded malted rice and barley and fried rice, as well as the whole of the remaining spices, is then, in equal parts, added to the two mashes, which are thereupon poured into a large vessel, after which the pounded &#8216;mâsara&#8217; is mixed with the compound whilst the above formula is pronounced; and the pot is deposited in a hole dug in the south-western corner of the fire-shed (sâlâ), where it remains standing for three days (and nights), during which the milk of one, two, and three cows respectively, and the remaining quantities of malted and fried grain are gradually added to it.” Tr. Julius Eggeling</p>
<p>Asking the Soma to get dressed is probably talking about fermentation as stated in the Baudhaya Srauta Sutra which is an elaboration of Yajur Veda 19.1,</p>
<p>Baudhayana Srauta Sutra XVII.32 &#8220;&#8230;He piles the cooked rice around the wooden filter. Having covered it, he touches it with the formula, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">&#8216;Thou art Soma; do thou be fermented for the Asvins, fermented for Sarasvati, fermented for Sutraman Indra</span>.&#8217; The Sura mixed up together is retained for three consecutive (nights). &#8216;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Soma, after having been purchased, stays on for three nights</span>.&#8217; So says the Brahmana. When it dawns after three nights, an animal-sacrifice of three or four animals is performed. The alter prescribed for the Sautramani is measured for the sacrificer on the preceeding day. Having strewn it around, he carries the Stambayajus.&#8221; Tr. Chintaman Ganesh Kashikar</p>
<p>The Black Yajur Veda 6.1.6.5 gives mythical reason behind keeping Soma for three days/nights which shall be discussed later in this article.</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 19.4-5 &#8220;By means of this eternal sieve may Sûrya&#8217;s Daughter purify The Soma that flows forth from thee. Soma with Wine, pressed; filtered for the banquet, cleanses priest, noble, brilliancy and vigour.&#8221; Tr. Ralph. T.H. Griffith</p>

<p>Satapatha Brahmana elaborates these verses as,</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana, Kanda 12, Adhyaya 7, Brahmana 3, Verse 12 “With (Vag. S. XIX, 4), &#8216;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">She purifieth thy liquor</span>.&#8217; purifies (the Sura) in the case of one wishing for prosperity:- &#8216;thy Soma, she, the daughter of Surya:&#8217; the daughter of Surya (the sun) assuredly is Faith, and by faith that (liquor) becomes Soma-juice, and by faith he makes it to be Soma-juice; &#8216;with the perpetual tail,&#8217; for with a tail-whisk that (liquor) is purified. With (Vâg. S. XIX, 5), <span style="text-decoration: underline;">&#8216;The Brahman and Kshatra he purifieth</span>,&#8217; he purifies the milk: he thus produces the Kshatra from out of the Brahman, for from out of the priesthood the nobility is produced;&#8211;&#8216;the fiery spirit and energy;&#8217; fiery spirit and energy, vital power, he thus bestows on him;&#8211;&#8216;with the Surâ the Soma,&#8217; for with the Surâ-liquor is Soma;&#8211;&#8216;the juice, is distilled,&#8217; for from the distilled the juice is obtained;&#8211;&#8216;for joy,&#8217; to joy (intoxication), indeed, the Soma juice contributes, and to joy also does the Surâ-liquor: he thus secures both the joy of the Soma, and the joy of the Surâ;&#8211;&#8216;with the pure juice, O god, satiate the deities!&#8217; that is, &#8216;with the pure juice satisfy thou the deities;&#8217;&#8211;&#8216;with sap bestow thou food on the Sacrificer,&#8217; sap and food he thereby bestows on the Sacrificer. The cups of milk are taken first, then the cups of Surâ-liquor: he thereby makes the peasantry obedient to the nobility.” Tr. Julius Eggeling</p>
<p>Baudhayana Saruta Sutra elaborates it as,</p>
<p>Baudhayana Srauta Sutra XVII.34 &#8221; While the Adhvaryu is engaged in his duties, the Pratiprashatr filers the wine by means of the woollen filter with its fringe towards the north, with the verse, &#8216;May the daughter of Surya filter O Indra for thee the mixture of wine regarded as Soma with the evernew woollen filter.&#8217; If the sacrificer is purged of Soma (he shall filter it) with the verse, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">&#8216;The swift wine, cleansed by the filter, the associate friend of Indra has passed downwards</span>&#8230;&#8221; Tr.

<p>Yajur Veda 19.7 “For each of you is made a God-appointed place: so grant to me a portion in the highest sphere. Surâ the strong art thou. This here is Soma. Entering thine own place do me no mischief.” Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>

<p>This is elaborated in the Satapatha Brahman,</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana, Kanda 12, Adhyaya 7, Brahmana 3, Verse 14-15 “With (Vâg. S. XIX, 7), &#8216;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Separately, indeed, a seat, acceptable to the gods, hath been prepared for you two</span>,&#8217; he fills the (three) cups of Surâ-liquor; for separate, indeed, are the Soma-juice and the Surâ-liquor; and &#8216;acceptable to the gods&#8217; he says, because these two are indeed acceptable to the gods; and &#8216;separately a seat hath been prepared&#8217; he says, because there are two altar-grounds;&#8211;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">&#8216;do not ye mingle in the highest heaven</span>!&#8217; he thereby keeps him (the Sacrificer) from evil;&#8211;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">&#8216;the potent Surâ-liquor thou art</span>,&#8217; he thereby makes Surâ to be Surâ;&#8211;&#8216;and this is Soma,&#8217; he thereby makes Soma to be Soma;&#8211;&#8216;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">entering thine own seat, injure me not</span>!&#8217; he thereby turns it (the Surâ-liquor) away to its own seat for his own safety. With a single (verse) he fills them: singly and solely on the Sacrificer he thus bestows fame, for the Surâ-liquor is fame. Verily, the cups of milk are the nobility (chieftaincy), and the cups of Surâ-liquor are the peasantry (clan): thus, were he to draw (the cups) without interlinking them, he would detach the peasantry from the nobility, and the nobility from the peasantry, and would cause confusion between the higher and lower, and a failure of the sacrifice. He draws them so as to be interlinked and thereby combines the peasantry with the nobility, and the nobility with the peasantry, for the prevention of confusion between the higher and lower, and for the success of the sacrifice.&#8221; Tr. Julius Eggeling</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana 12:7:3:8 “There are both milk and Surâ-liquor; for milk is Soma, and the Surâ-liquor food: through the milk he secures the Soma-drink, and through the Surâ-liquor food. And milk is the nobility (chieftaincy), and Surâ-liquor the peasantry (clan); the milk he purifies after purifying the Surâ-liquor: he thus produces the nobility from out of the peasantry, for the nobility is produced from out of the peasantry.” Tr. Julius Eggeling</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Yajur Veda 19.7 is also elaborated in Aitareya Brahmana which explains the Rajasuya sacrifice. In the consecration ceremony (Rajasuya?) of king mentioned in Aitareya Brahmana, the king is required to drink Sura (liquor) along with Soma which is given by the Brahmin priest,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Aitareya Brahmana, Book 8, Chapter 2, Para 8 “…The spirituous liquor represents the Kshattra, and further, the juice in the food; thus both the Kshattra and the juice in the food, are placed in him…Now he gives into his hand a goblet of spirituous liquor, under the recital of the verse, svadishthaya madishthaya, (9.1.1) i.e. ‘Purify, O Soma! with thy sweetest most exhilarating drops (the sacrificer), thou who art squeezed for Indra, to be drunk by him.’ After having put the spirituous liquor into his hand, the priest repeats a propitiatory mantra (which runs thus): <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">‘To either of you (spirituous liquor and Soma!) a separate residence has been prepared, and allotted by the gods. Do not mix with one another in the highest heaven; liquor! thou art powerful; Soma! thou art a king. Do not harm him (the king)! may either go to his own place</span><span style="color: #444444;">.’ </span>(Here is said), that the drinking of the<span style="color: #444444;"> </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Soma and that of liquor, exclude one another (they are not to be mixed). After having drunk it</span><span style="color: #444444;">…</span>Thus he finally places the liquor in his friend (gives him a share in it).” Tr. Martin Haug</span></p>
<p>Chapter 20 of Aitareya Brahmana deals with the pouring of various liquids over the king’s head by the priest and also deals with the drinking of liquor. By means of Mantra the liquor was transformed into real Soma which is then drunk by the king,</p>
<p>Aitareya Brahmana, Book 8, chapter 4, Para 20 “…Then the priest gives into his hands a goblet filled with spirituous liquor, repeating the mantra, svadishthaya. He then should drink the remainder (after previous libations to the gods)…<span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Soma beverage which is (in a mystical way) contained in the spirituous liquor, is thus drunk by the king</span>, who is inaugurated by means of Indra’s inauguration ceremony (the ceremony just described)…The drinking of spirituous liquor, or Soma, or the enjoyment of some other exquisite food, affects the body of the Kshattriya who is inaugurated by means of Indra’s great inauguration ceremony…” Tr. Martin Haug</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 19.7 is also elaborated in Baudhayana Srauta Sutra,</p>
<p>Baudhayana Srauta Sutra XVII.36 “(He recites) the verse) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">&#8216;Do you offer heartfelt sweet praise to Agni the drinker of wine, receiving Soma on the surface, the creator of all and whom horses, oxen, bulls, barren cows, sheeps released (by the sacrificer) are offered</span>,&#8217; and makes the offering at the second Vasat-uttering. He pours down the remnants of the cup for the Asvins into that for Sarasvati; the remnants of the cup for Sarasvati into that for Indra. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">A brahmana consumes it with the two verses</span>: &#8216;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">(O Sura and Soma) god has erected separate resorts for you; do not be mixed up in the high above. Thou art powerful Sura; this is Soma. Entering into thy own abode, do not injure me</span>. Whatever has remained here out of the juicy pressed drink, which Indra rank for his powers&#8230;He fills in the cups with the sediment of the Sura; he fixes the feath of the eagle into the cup of Butea frondosa&#8230;.He takes the sura with the excessive substance and pours it inot the sieve of a hundred pores with the formula, &#8216;O Pitrs with Soma as the first, be gratified.&#8217; When the liquid passes through the sieve, all offer prayers with eight verses&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Chintaman Ganesh Kashikar</p>
<p>Above passage from Baudhayana is also an elaboration of following Yajur Veda verses,</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 20.76-78 &#8220;Ye Asvins and Sarasvati, joint drinkers of the Sura draught, In Namuchi of Asura birth, gave aid to Indra in his deeds. As parents aid a son, both Asvins aided thee, Indra, with their wondrous powers and wisdom. When thou with might hadst drunk the draught that gladdens, Sarasvati, O Bounteous Lord, refereshed thee. He in whom horses, bulls, oxen, and barren cows, and rams, when duly set apart, are offered up, To Agni, Soma-sprinkled, drinker of sweet juice, Disposer, with thy heart bring forth a pleasant hymn.&#8221; Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>Griffith has translated the word “Sura” as “Draught” and “Sweet juice” here. Part of the above passage where Ashwins are said to have helped Indra to kill Namuchi is also mentioned in Baudhayana Srauta Sutra XVII.35 and Yajur Veda 20.59 which I have quoted in this article and let me again quote a few sentences of Baudhayana for your ease,</p>
<p>Baudhayana Srauta Sutra XVII.35 “…Getting up taking the two cups, the Adhvaryu says &#8216;Do you recite the puronuvakya for the Sura-soma taken for the Asvins, Sarasvati and Sutraman Indra. &#8216;The Maitravruna recites as the puronuvakya the verse, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">&#8216;O Asvins the guardians of the auspicious, do you two partaking of the Sura-soma in association with the demon Namuci help Indra in his deeds</span>.&#8217; Having crossed the alter and having caused to announce, he says (to the Maitravaruna), &#8216;Do you impel (the Hotr to recite the yajya for the Sura-soma set forth for the Asvins, Sarasvati and Sutraman Indra.&#8217; The Maitravaruna pronounces the call, &#8216;Let the Hotr recite the yajya for the Asvins, Sarasvati and Sutraman Indra. These Sura-soma (o gods) set forth for you-powerful, exhilerating, prepared out of the mixture&#8230;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">May the Avins, Sarasvati and Sutraman Indra the Vrtra-killed enjoy them; may they drink the sweet wine</span>, become exhilarated and enjoy. O Hotr, do you recite the yajya. The Hotr recites the yajya, &#8216;O Asvins, do you favour us with your deed like the parents their son. O Indra, when thou didst consume the Sura-soma in order to achieve good deeds and to possess powers, Satasvati healed thee&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Chintaman Ganesh Kashikar</p>
<p>Sankhayana elaborates it as,</p>
<p>Sankhayana Srauta Sutra XV.15.1-14 &#8220;Now the sautramani. (The victims at this occasion are) a red he goat for the Asvins, a ewe for Sarasvati, a bull for Indra the protecting (sutraman) After encircling with the firebrand has been performed on these, they proceed with the surasoma. Over the flowing (sura) they mutter&#8230;Or the verses addressed to the Fathers. The inviting (verse for the libation of the sura is) &#8216;Ye both, O Asvins, the cheering)&#8217; The formula of prompting is Let the hotr worship the Asvins, Sarasvati, Indra the protecting&#8230;The mantra to accompany the partaking of the sura is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">&#8216;The (Soma), which the Asvins took from the asura Namuci which Sarasvati pressed out to obtain</span> strength, this king Soma the bright, sweet drop, I here partake of.&#8217; If he starts from the moaning that <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">a brahmana must be engaged for a reward to drink the (remainings of the) sura</span>, the beverage (the rest of the sura) is poured out for him.&#8221; Tr. W. Caland</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 19.32 &#8220;The rite with sacred grass, wine, store of heroes, the mighty ones speed on with adorations. May we, sweet-singing sacrificers, setting Soma mid Gods in heaven, give joy to Indra.&#8221; Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith<br />

<p>Satapatha Brahmana elaborates on this verse as,</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana, Kanda 12, Adhayaya 8, Brahmana 1, verse 2 &#8220;He (the Adhvaryu) offers (of the three cups of milk) with (Vâg. S. XIX, 32), &#8216;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">By their devotions the buffalos quicken the sacrifice</span>,&#8217;&#8211;the buffalos, doubtless, are the officiating priests, and devotion is sacrifice: through the priests he causes the sacrifice to prosper, and through the sacrifice the sacrificer;&#8211;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">&#8216;the barhis-seated one, supplied with Surâ and goodly heroes</span>,&#8217; supplied with Surâ, indeed, is this barhis-seated sacrifice, to wit, the Sautrâmanî: by means of the barhis (the sacred grass on the Vedi), and the sacrifice, he causes him to prosper;&#8211;&#8216;they who bestow Soma,&#8217;&#8211;they thus bestow the Soma-drink upon him;&#8211;&#8216;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">with the deities in heaven</span>,&#8217;&#8211;they thus place him with the deities in heaven;&#8211;&#8216;may we enjoy ourselves,&#8217;&#8211;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">the Soma-juice, indeed, conduces to joy, and so does the Surâ-liquor</span>: both the joy of Soma and the joy of Surâ he thus secures;&#8211;&#8216;worshipping Indra with good hymns of praise!&#8217;&#8211;for the hymn of praise is food for the gods, and the sacrifice also is food: by sacrifice, by food, he thus makes him successful. Having sacrificed, they drink (of the milk), and thereby increase what is prosperous with him.&#8221; Tr. Julius Eggeling</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 19.33 “All essence of thine own in plants collected, all strength of Soma when poured out with Surâ—Therewith impel with joy the sacrifice, Sarasvatî, the Asvins, Indra, Agni.” Tr. Ralph T.H Griffith<br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="508" height="108" class="wp-image-8888 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Picture-10-508w108h.jpeg" alt="yv 19.33 Swami Karpatri" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Picture-10-508w108h.jpeg 508w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Picture-10-508w108h-300x64.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 508px) 100vw, 508px" /></p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana elaborates it as,</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana, Kanda 12, Adhayaya 8, Brahmana 1, Verse 12 &#8220;He (the Pratiprasthâtri) offers (libations from the cups of Surâ-liquor), with (Vâg. S. XIX, 33), <span style="text-decoration: underline;">&#8216;What essence there is of thine, gathered from the plants</span>,&#8217; for this Surâ-liquor, indeed, is the essence of both the waters and the plants: by the essence of both the waters and the plants he thus causes him to prosper;&#8211;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">&#8216;the strength of the Soma-juice together with the Surâ-liquor</span>,&#8217;&#8211;he thereby secures what strength there is in the Soma-juice and in the Surâ-liquor;&#8211;&#8216;by that exhilarating drink quicken thou the Sacrificer,&#8217;&#8211;that is, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">&#8216;by that exhilarating drink gladden thou the Sacrificer;&#8217;&#8211;&#8216;Sarasvatî, the Asvins, Indra, and Agni</span>,&#8217;&#8211;by deities he (the priest) thus causes the sacrifice to prosper, and by deities and sacrifice the Sacrificer. Having made the offering, they drink (the liquor), and thereby cause to prosper what is unprosperous with him.&#8221; Tr. Julius Eggeling</p>
<p>Veda also mentions offering liquor to departed manes. The sacrificer is not supposed to drink liquor as it is meant only for offering in this case,</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 19.36 &#8220;To Fathers who claim Svadha be Svadha and homage! To Grandfathers who claim Svadha be Svadha and homage! To Great-grandfathers who claim Svadha be Svadha and homage! The Fathers have eaten. The Fathers have rejoiced. The Fathers have been satisfied. Fathers, be ye purified.&#8221; Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>It is elaborated in the Satapatha Brahmana,</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana, Kanda 12, Adhayaya 8, Brahmana 1, verses 6-8 “…this Soma-drink falls to the share of the fathers and grandfathers of whoever drinks (the liquor) on this occasion. Having shifted three coals of the southern fire to outside the enclosing-stones 1, he may there offer (of the liquor) with these (three) utterances (Vâg. S. XIX, 36):&#8211; &#8216;To the Svadhâ-loving Fathers be Svadhâ, adoration!&#8217; he thereby places the Fathers with the Svadhâ in the world of the Fathers.&#8211;&#8216;To the Svadhâ-loving grandfathers he Svadhâ, adoration!&#8217; he thereby places the grandfathers with the Svadhâ in the world of the grandfathers.&#8211;&#8216;To the Svadhâ-loving great-grandfathers be Svadhâ, adoration!&#8217; he thereby places the great-grandfathers with the Svadhâ in the world of the great-grandfathers. Having fetched water, he pours it (into the cups) with, &#8216;The Fathers have drunk:&#8217; he thereby bestows food on them;&#8211;&#8216;the Fathers have enjoyed themselves:&#8217; he thereby causes them to enjoy themselves;&#8211;&#8216;the Fathers have become satisfied:&#8217; he thereby satisfies them;&#8211;&#8216;may the Fathers cleanse themselves!&#8217; he thereby purifies all of them from the first downwards, for the Sautrâmanî is a means of purification.&#8221; Tr. Julius Eggeling</p>
<p>The following verse is about offering various animals to Vedic deities, it is also about offering liquor and asking them to drink it,</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 21.29-31 &#8220;Let the Hotar sacrifice with fuel to Agni in the place of libation, to the Asvins, Indra, Sarasvatî. A grey-coloured he-goat with wheat, jujube-fruit and sprouts of rice becomes a sweet salutary remedy, splendour, might, milk, Soma. Let them enjoy sweet butter with foaming liquor. Hotar, present offerings of butter. Let the Hotar, Tanunapat, worship Sarasvati. A sheep, a ram, a salutary remedy on the honey-sweet path, bearing to the Asvins and Indra heroic strength, with jujebe-fruit, Indra-grains, sprouts of rice, becomes a salutary remedy, milk, Soma. Let them enjoy Sweet butter with foaming liquor. Hotar, present offerings of butter&#8230;Let the Hotar, magnified with oblations, offering sacrifice, worship Sarasvati and Indra, increasing them with strength, with a bull and a cow. Strength and medicine to the Asvins and Indra are meath with jujube-fruit, Masara with parched grain, milk, Soma. Let them enjoy sweet butter with foaming liquor&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>It is elaborated in Sankhayana as,</p>
<p>Sankhayana Srauta Sutra XIV.13.1-9 &#8220;At this rite two animals a grey he goat to the Asvins a ewe to Sarasvati, are immolated in addition to the savana victim. To Indra Sutraman a barren cow of the same kind is immolated in addition to the usual one. The reason why these victims are thus tied (and slaughtered) is the wish not to depart from the sautramani. After the Savana cakes of the morning (service) they put the fuel to the fire outside and go on with the (i.e. pour out the libation of) surasoma&#8230;Now, in that for Indra Sutraman a barren cow is immolated in addition to the usual one, (the reason thereof is) along with Indra Sutraman the sautramani is completed.&#8221; Tr. W. Caland</p>
<p>Baudhayana Srauta Sutra elaborates these verses as,</p>
<p>Baudhayana Srauta Sutra XVII.35 &#8220;He carried those (cups) towards the east or north along the rear of the handles of the ladles. He takes the wine together with excessive substance and moves towards the southern fire&#8230;he formally dedicates the animals a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">gray coloured (goat) to the Asvins, a male sheep to Sarasvati and a bull to Indra</span>. He dedicates a goat to Brhaspati as the fourth animal if the sacrificer has purged Soma. After having offered their omenta as prescribed, the Adhvaryu takes up the cups for the Asvins and Sarasvati; the Pratiprasthatr takes the one for Indra. Getting up taking the two cups, the Adhvaryu says &#8216;Do you recite the puronuvakya for the Sura-soma taken for the Asvins, Sarasvati and Sutraman Indra. &#8216;The Maitravruna recites as the puronuvakya the verse, &#8216;O Asvins the guardians of the auspicious, do you two partaking of the Sura-soma in association with the demon Namuci help Indra in his deeds.&#8217; Having crossed the alter and having caused to announce, he says (to the Maitravaruna), &#8216;Do you impel (the Hotr to recite the yajya for the Sura-soma set forth for the Asvins, Sarasvati and Sutraman Indra.&#8217; The Maitravaruna pronounces the call, &#8216;Let the Hotr recite the yajya for the Asvins, Sarasvati and Sutraman Indra. These Sura-soma (o gods) set forth for you-powerful, exhilerating, prepared out of the mixture&#8230;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">May the Avins, Sarasvati and Sutraman Indra the Vrtra-killer enjoy them; may they drink the sweet wine</span>, become exhilarated and enjoy. O Hotr, do you recite the yajya. The Hotr recites the yajya, &#8216;O Asvins, do you favour us with your deed like the parents their son. O Indra, when thou didst consume the Sura-soma in order to achieve good deeds and to possess powers, Sarasvati healed thee&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Chintaman Ganesh Kashikar</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana, Kanda 12, Adhayaya 8, Brahmana 2, verse 15 &#8220;All (the praishas) contain (the word) &#8216;payas&#8217; (milk), for in the form of milk Soma is (here) pressed; they all contain (the word) &#8216;Soma,&#8217; for the sake of (conformity with) the Soma-pressing; they all contain (the word) &#8216;parisrut&#8217; (spirituous liquor), for in the form of spirituous liquor Soma is (here) pressed; they all contain (the word) &#8216;ghrita&#8217; (ghee), for this&#8211;to wit, ghee&#8211;doubtless is manifestly a form of the sacrifice: he thus makes it to be manifestly a form of the sacrifice; they all contain (the word) &#8216;madhu&#8217; (honey), for this&#8211;to wit, honey&#8211;is manifestly a form of Soma: he thus makes it to be manifestly a form of Soma.&#8221; Tr. Julius Eggeling</p>
<p>Yajur Veda verse mentions the word Parisrut which is a semi-fermented liquor according to the translator Julius Eggeling while Griffith translates it as foaming liquor. Both the sacrificer and priests have to drink Parisrut liquor offered to gods,</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana, Kanda 12, Adhayaya 8, Brahmana 2, verse 21 &#8220;This Sautrâmanî, then, is manifestly a Soma-sacrifice; and were the Sacrificer alone to drink (the liquor), it would be either an ishti-offering, or an animal sacrifice; but, for the sake of conformity of the liquor) to the Soma, all the priests drink thereof, for all the priests drink of the Soma-juice.&#8221; Tr. Julius Eggeling</p>
<p>Following Yajur Veda verses states that Agni, Sarasvati and Indra had drunk the Sura-Soma mixture,</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 21.59-60 “To-day this Sacrificer cooking viands, cooking sacrificial rice-cakes, binding a goat for the Asvins, a ram for Sarasvatî, a hull for Indra, pressing Surâ and Soma juices for the Asvins, Sarasvatî, and Indra the Good Deliverer, has chosen Agni as Hotar. To-day the divine Vanaspatî has done good service to the Asvins with a goat, to Sarasvatî with a ram, to Indra with a bull. They have eaten these from the marrow onwards, they have accepted the cooked viands, they have waxed strong with the rice-cakes. The Agnis, Sarasvatî, and Indra have drunk the Surâ and Soma draughts.” Tr. Ralph. T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>The following is the Hindi translation by Dr. Ganga Sahay Sharma,</p>

<p>This is in continuation from verse 1, so supplementary texts mentioned for Yajur Veda 21.29-31 can be read for understanding above Yajur Veda 21.59-60 verses.</p>
<p>Also check the meaning of Sura given by Panini in his Ashtadhyayi and Hindu reformer Kumarila Bhatta in his Tantra Vartika.</p>
<h2>Parisrut</h2>
<p>Julius Eggeling writes in the footnotes of Satapatha Brahmana, &#8220;According to Sayana, the difference between sura and parisrut would seem to be that the former beverage is prepared from mature shoots (of rice, &amp;c.), and the latter from such as are not quite ripe.&#8221; It is stated that Parisrut is neither Soma nor Sura. Parisrut seems to have been a semi-fermented liquor. Also see Yajur Veda 21.29 which is mentioned in the category Sautramani sacrifice and is further elaborated in Brahmana and Srauta Sutra. Satapatha Brahmana, Kanda 12, Adhayaya 8, Brahmana 2, verse 15 also mentions drinking Soma and Parisrut in Sautramani ritual.</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 20.59-65 The Asvins brought from Namuchi pressed Soma bright with <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">foaming juice</span>. Sarasvatî with sacred grass brought that to Indra for his drink. The Asvins, and the Three, apart, Sarasvatî, Idâ, Bhâratî, As drink to gladden Indra, poured strong Soma with the foaming juice. Praising with <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">foaming liquor</span> at due times, Indra, Vanaspatî, Sarasvatî as cow gave forth sweet beverage with the Asvins Twain.&#8221; Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>Read Baudhayana Srauta Sutra XVII.35 and Sankhayana Srauta Sutra XV.15.1-14 mentioned above which elaborates Yajur Veda 20.59-65. Griffith has translated the word Parisrut as foaming juice as well as foaming liquor.</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 19.95 &#8220;Splendour of victims, powerful oblation, honey and meath with milk and foaming liquor, Healing Sarasvatî effused, and Asvins; from pressed and unpressed Soma, deathless Indu.&#8221; Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 2.34 &#8220;Bearers of vigour and immortal fatness, milk and sweet beverage and foaming liquor, ye are a freshening draught. Delight my Fathers.&#8221; Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>Julius Eggeling in his translation of Satapatha Brahmana mentions Katyayana Samhita in the footnotes which elaborates the above Yajur Veda verse as,</p>
<p>Kâtyâyana Samhita IV, I, 15 “Having made (them) wash themselves as before, and having loosened (visramsya) the tuck, he makes obeisance with &#8216;adoration to your vigour, O fathers!&#8217; &amp;c. (Vâg. S. II, 32 a-f)&#8230; He pours [the water, left in the pitcher, on the cakes] with &#8216;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ye (O waters) are a refreshing draught, ye, that bring sap, immortal ghee and milk and foaming mead: gladden my fathers!&#8217; (Vâg. S. II, 34.)</span> 20, [The Adhvaryu] having laid (the cakes on the dish) the sacrificer smells at them. 21, The firebrand and the once-cut stalks of grass (he throws) into the fire. 22, The wife, if desirous of a son, eats the middle cake with, &#8216;Bestow offspring on me, O fathers, a boy crowned with lotuses; that there may he a man here!&#8217; (Vâg. S. II, 33.)…” Tr. Julius Eggeling</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 19.79 &#8220;Seeing the foaming liquor&#8217;s sap, Prajapati with the bright drank out the bright, the milk, the Soma juice, the Soma juice, BY Law, etc.&#8221; Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>

<p>Griffith has translated the word Parisrut as foaming drink in this verse and in the footnotes, he provides an explanation,</p>
<p>&#8220;Foaming drink: parisutas; a beverage prepared from herbs, a sort of beer.&#8221;</p>

<h1>Hindu Scriptures on Liquor Drinking</h1>
<p>Narada Purana not only allows one to drink liquor after offering it to gods but it also gives details on the preparation of three types of liquors,</p>
<p>Narada Purana III.90.11-22 &#8220;This Vidya is exhilarating as the intoxicating liquor. It is the means of crossing over distress. I shall now tell you the precise preparation of it. The liquor they classify into three types: Gaudi, Paisti and Madhvi. Put jaggery in hot water and stir it well. The pollen powder of the flower dhataki (grislea tomentosa) shall be put into it and the whole solution is kept in a glass jar. It is stored under ground but at dawn and at dusk the solution is stirred well with the hands. After a month is over when the sediments go to the bottom, it is filtered. This can be used for worship. This is called Gaudi because it is prepared from Guda. Similarly, that which is got by adding honey is called Madhvi. O dear one, listen to the Paisti variety. Rice should be boiled slowly and cooked in two and a half times more water (than the rice). It should be left over for three days. Then the powdered sprout of the embylic Myrobalan is put into it. Keep this in an airy place for a day where there is not much of wind. Water is then poured into it and stirred well. This is then filtered. It is then called Paistika Madhu. Artificial liquor is prepared in two ways extracting from trees or squeezing from fruits. Listen to the mode of its preparation. By its taste the mind gets repose. Bunches of grapes, or date fruits or the flowers of Bassia latifolia are put into water and boiled to half the original quantity. To this add a small quantity of distilled spirit and keep it undisturbed for two days. After filtering the same it becomes tasty and auspicious, worthy of being offered for worship. I causes full repose of the mind. As to the second variety it is prepared from the coconut, Hintala or palm trees. The milk that exudes from the stalk of the fruit must be taken fresh from the tree. It is tasty. Take the water out of the coconut fruit. Put a little camphor therein. The juice of Arecanut half the quantity of the former. Mix both and keep it in the sunlight. This immediately becomes liquor which the gods are very fond of.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Another verse from Narada Purana permits one to drink a certain amount of liquor after offering it to deities,</p>
<p>Narada Purana III.90.23-28 &#8220;Or the devotee shall offer for the arghya to the goddess the liquor which has been mentioned here. It must be offered immediately which will be fruitful. The aspirant while remaining in trance should drink it always restricting his diet. Never should a siddha drink it unless it has been first offered to the goddess. It should be drunk until the mind is wholly absorbed in the Goddess. If he drinks more than that he shall become a sinner immediately. He who drinks wine with wilful desire without serving it to the god becomes a sinner. He should be punished by the king for he is the worshipper of avidya &#8230;The devotee with the previously-mentioned form should worship the deities of the above-mentioned forms. He should worship them in the proper sequence with the offering if wine, fish and meat duly consecrated.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Baudhayana Dharma Shastra permits the drinking of Rum only for South Indian Hindus,</p>
<p>Baudhayana Dharma Shastra, Prasna 1, Adhyaya 1, Kandika 1, verses 1-4 “There is a dispute regarding five (practices) both in the south and in the north…Now (the customs peculiar) to the north are, to deal in wool, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">to drink rum</span>, to sell animals that have teeth in the upper and in the lower jaws, to follow the trade of arms, to go to sea. He who follows (these practices) in any other country than where they prevail, commits sin.”</p>
<p>Indra questions Brihaspati about Asava (a type of liquor) and Brihaspati explains to him in detail and also about which type of liquor is permissible for Kshatriya, Vaishya after offering it to deities,</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana, Lalita-Mahatmya 7.63-76 &#8220;Indra said: &#8216;What is the nature of Asava? (Liquor). What is its defect? What is its merit? What type of cooked food is defective? Mention this in detail to me.&#8217; Brihaspati said: The different types of intoxicating beverages are as follows: Paiffika (made from flour or rice), Talaja (from the date palm), Kaira (cocounut palm-juice), Madhuka (made from honey or Madhuka flowers), Gudasambhava (prepared from molasses). In regard to sinful nature the later ones mentioned above are half as dreadful as the earlier ones. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Asava can be used as a beverage by the three castes beginning with the Ksatriyas</span>. Excepting a Brahmana lady, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">all women can drink liquors beginning with the third one i.e. Kaira (coconut palm juice, and prepared from honey and molasses)</span>. A widow, a virgin and a woman in her monthly period shall avoid drinking liquor. If a woman drinks liquor out of covetousness and not in the company of her husband, she is called Unmadini (a mad woman). One should avoid her like a Candala woman. The ratio of drinking liquors in the case of four castes beginning with the Brahmanas shall be ten to eight or six to four. In the case of women it shall be half of the above. If they drink in the company of their husbands it shall be one-fourth of the above. After drinking liquor out of delusion, a Brahmana should perform Krcchracandrayana expiation. Or he shall repeat Gayatri Mantra or Jatavedasa Mantra ten thousand times. If a man repeats Ambikahrdaya Mantra he shall become pure. A Ksatriya among the three castes shall be purified by repeating those Mantras half the number of times. In the case of women the number of repetitions shall be one-fourth or they can get the same done through Brahmanas. One should repeat the Mantras a thousand times under water and become purified thereby. Laksmi, Sarasvati, Gauri, Candika, Tripura, Ambika, Vaisnavi, Bhairavi, Kali and Mahendri are the mothers. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">There are other Sakti goddesses. In worshipping them the liquor prepared from honey is approved of</span>. A Brahmana who has mastered the Vedangas shall perform worship without wine &#8230;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The base fellow who drinks liquor without worshipping Para Sakti </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">shall stay in hell called Raurava for a period calculated at the rate of a year for every d</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">r</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">op so consumed</span>.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Brahmins were not always barred from quaffing wine, in the Vedic period Kshatriyas and even Brahmins enjoyed wine especially after mixing it with Soma,</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 19.5 <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Soma with Wine, pressed</span>; filtered for the banquet, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">cleanses priest, noble</span>, brilliancy and vigour. God, with the Bright give Deities enjoyment: give food with flavour to the Sacrificer.</p>
<p>Following is the Sanskrit text with Hindi translation by Swami Karpatri Maharaj,</p>

<p>In the consecration ceremony (Rajasuya?) of the king mentioned in Aitareya Brahmana, the king is required to drink Sura (liquor) along with Soma which is given by the Brahmin priest,</p>
<p>Aitareya Brahmana, Book 8 , Chapter 2, Para 8 &#8220;&#8230;The spirituous liquor represents the Kshattra, and further, the juice in the food; thus both the Kshattra and the juice in the food, are placed in him&#8230;Now he gives into his hand a goblet of spirituous liquor, under the recital of the verse, svadishthaya madishthaya, (9.1.1) i.e. &#8216;Purify, O Soma! with thy sweetest most exhilarating drops (the sacrificer), thou who art squeezed for Indra, to be drunk by him.&#8217; After having put the spirituous liquor into his hand, the priest repeats a propitiatory mantra (which runs thus): <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">&#8216;To either of you (spirituous liquor and Soma!) a separate residence has been prepared, and allotted by the gods. Do not mix with one another in the highest heaven; liquor! thou art powerful; Soma! thou art a king. Do not harm him (the king)! may either go to his own place</span>.&#8217; (Here is said), that the drinking of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Soma and that of liquor, exclude one another (they are not to be mixed). After having drunk it</span>&#8230;Thus he finally places the liquor in his friend (gives him a share in it).” Tr. Martin Haug</p>
<p>Underlined sentences of the above passage are an elaboration of the following Yajur Veda verse,</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 19.7 For each of you is made a God-appointed place: so grant to me a portion in the highest sphere. Surâ the strong art thou. This here is Soma. Entering thine own place do me no mischief.</p>
<p>Following is the Sanskrit text along with the Hindi translation of Swami Karpatri Maharaj</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1239" height="345" class="wp-image-8892 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Picture-7-1.jpeg" alt="C:\Users\Hassan Razvi\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\INetCache\Content.Word\yv 19.7.jpg" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Picture-7-1.jpeg 1239w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Picture-7-1-300x84.jpeg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Picture-7-1-768x214.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1239px) 100vw, 1239px" /></p>
<p>Now, those who cry “fake translation” has no way to escape, Aitareya Brahmana attests Yajur Veda verse. Chapter 20 of Aitareya Brahmana deals with the pouring of various liquids over the king&#8217;s head by the priest and also deals with drinking liquor. By means of Mantra the liquor was transformed into real Soma which is then drunk by the king,</p>
<p>Aitareya Brahmana, Book 8, chapter 4, Para 20 &#8220;&#8230;Then the priest gives into his hands a goblet filled with spirituous liquor, repeating the mantra, svadishthaya. He then should drink the remainder (after previous libations to the gods)&#8230;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Soma beverage which is (in a mystical way) contained in the spirituous liquor, is thus drunk by the king</span>, who is inaugurated by means of Indra&#8217;s inauguration ceremony (the ceremony just described)&#8230;The drinking of spirituous liquor, or Soma, or the enjoyment of some other exquisite food, affects the body of the Kshattriya who is inaugurated by means of Indra&#8217;s great inauguration ceremony&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Martin Haug</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti prohibits all forms of wine for a Brahmin but permits certain types of liquor for Kshatriya and Vaishya,</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti 22.82-84 Distilled from sugar, or from the blossoms of the Madhûka. (Mâdhvi wine], or from flour: these three kinds of spirituous liquor have to be discerned; as one, so are all: none of them must be tasted by the twice-born. Again, distilled from the blossoms of the Madhûka tree (Madhûka wine), from molasses, from the fruits of the Tanka (or Kapittha tree), of the jujube tree, of the Khargûra tree, or of the breadfruit tree, from wine-grapes, from Madhûka blossoms (Mâdhvîka wine), Maireya, and the sap of the cocoanut tree: <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">These ten intoxicating drinks are unclean for a Brâhmana; but a Kshatriya and a Vaisya commit no wrong in touching (or drinking) them</span>.</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 5.56 There is no sin in eating meat, in (drinking) spirituous liquor, and in <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">carnal intercourse, for that is the natural way of created beings</span>, but abstention brings great rewards</p>
<p>Acharya Medhatithi writes on this verse that drinking wine is permissible for Kshatriyas. Arthashastra of Kautilya (Chanakya) allows the sale, purchase and drinking of liquor, it brings liquor manufacturers and shops under state regulation, an entire chapter is dedicated to it,</p>
<p>Kautilya’s Arthashastra, Book 2, chapter 25 “BY employing such men as are acquainted with the manufacture of liquor and ferments (kinva), the Superintendent of Liquor shall carry on liquor-traffic not only in forts and country parts, but also in camps. In accordance with the requirements of demand and supply (krayavikrayavasena) he may either centralize or decentralize the sale of liquor. A fine of 600 panas shall be imposed on all offenders other than those who are manufacturers, purchasers, or sellers in liquor-traffic. Liquor shall not be taken out of villages, nor shall liquor shops be close to each other. Lest workmen spoil the work in hand, and Aryas violate their decency and virtuous character, and lest firebrands commit indiscreet acts, liquor shall be sold to persons of well known character in such small quantities as one-fourth or half-a-kudumba, one kudumba, half-a-prastha, or one prastha. Those who are well known and of pure character may take liquor out of shop. Or all may be compelled to drink liquor within the shops and not allowed to stir out at once in view of detecting articles such as sealed deposits, unsealed deposits, commodities given for repair, stolen articles, and the like which the customer&#8217;s may have acquired by foul means. When they are found to possess gold and other articles not their own, the superintendent shall contrive to cause them to be arrested outside the shop. Likewise those who are too extravagant or spend beyond their income shall be arrested. No fresh liquor other than bad liquor shall be sold below its price. Bad liquor may be sold elsewhere or given to slaves or workmen in lieu of wages; or it may form the drink of beasts for draught or the subsistence of hogs. Liquor shops shall contain many rooms provided with beds and seats kept apart. The drinking room shall contain scents, garlands of flowers, water, and other comfortable things suitable to the varying seasons. Spies stationed in the shops shall ascertain whether the expenditure incurred by customers in the shop is ordinary or extraordinary and also whether there are any strangers. They shall also ascertain the value of the dress, ornaments, and gold of the customers lying there under intoxication. When customers under intoxication lose any of their things, the merchants of the shop shall not only make good the loss, but also pay an equivalent fine. Merchants seated in half-closed rooms shall observe the appearance of local and foreign customers who, in real or false guise of Aryas lie down in intoxication along with their beautiful mistresses. Of various kinds of liquor such as medaka, prasanna, ásava, arista, maireya, and madhu:&#8211; Medaka is manufactured with one drona of water, half, an ádaka of rice, and three prastha of kinva (ferment). Twelve ádhakas of flour (pishta), five prasthas of kinva (ferment), with the addition of spices (játisambhára) together with the bark and fruits of putraká (a species of tree) constitute prasanná. One-hundred palas of kapittha (Feronia Elephantum) 500 palas of phánita (sugar), and one prastha of honey (madhu) form ásava. With an increase of one-quarter of the above ingredients, a superior kind of ásava is manufactured; and when the same ingredients are lessened to the extent of one-quarter each, it becomes of an inferior quality. The preparation of various kinds of arishta for various diseases are to be learnt from physicians. A sour gruel or decoction of the bark of meshasringi (a kind of poison) mixed with jaggery (guda) and with the powder of long pepper and black pepper or with the powder of triphala (1 Terminalia Chebula, 2 Terminalia Bellerica, and 3 Phyllanthus Emblica) forms Maireya. To all kinds of liquor mixed with jaggery, the powder of triphala is always added. The juice of grapes is termed madhu. Its own native place (svadesa) is the commentary on such of its various forms as kápisáyana and hárahúraka. One drona of either boiled or unboiled paste of másha (Phraseolus Radiatus), three parts more of rice, and one karsha of morata (Alangium Hexapetalum) and the like form kinva (ferment). In the manufacture of medaka and prasanna, five karshas of the powder of (each of páthá (Clypea Hermandifolio), lodhra (Symplocos Racemosa), tejovati (Piper Chaba), eláváluka (Solanum Melongena) honey, the juice of grapes (madhurasa), priyangu (panic seeds), dáruharidra (a species of turmeric) black pepper and long pepper are added as sambhára, requisite spices. The decoction of madhúka (Bassia Latifolia) mixed with granulated sugar (katasarkará), when added to prasanna, gives it a pleasing colour. The requisite quantity of spices to be added to ásava is one karshá of the powder of each of chocha (bark of cinnamon), chitraka (Plumbago Zeylanica), vilanga, and gajapippalí (Scindapsus Officinalis), and two karshas of the powder of each of kramuka (betel nut), madhúka (Bassia Latifolia), mustá (Cyprus Rotundus), and lodhra (Symlocos Racemosa). The addition of one-tenth of the above ingredients (i.e., chocha, kramuka, etc.), is (termed) bíjabandha. The same ingredients as are added to prasanná are also added to white liquor (svetasurá). The liquor that is manufactured from mango fruits (sahakárasurá) may contain a greater proportion of mango essence (rasottara), or of spices (bíjottara). It is called mahásura when it contains sambhára (spices as described above). When a handful (antarnakho mushtih, i.e., so much as can be held in the hand, the fingers being so bent that the nails cannot be seen) of the powder of granulated sugar dissolved in the decoction of moratá (Alangium Hexapetalum), palása (Butea Frondosa), dattúra (Dattura Fastuosa), karanja (Robinia Mitis), meshasringa (a kind of poison) and the bark of milky trees (kshiravriksha) mixed with one-half of the paste formed by combining the powders of lodhra (Symplocos Racemosa), chitraka (Plumbago Zeylanica), vilanga, páthá (clypea Hermandifolia), mustá (cyprus Rotundus), kaláya (leguminous seeds), dáruharidra (Amonum Xanthorrhizon), indívara (blue lotus), satapushpa (Anethum Sowa), apámárga (Achyranthes Aspera) saptaparna (Echites Scholaris), and nimba (Nimba Melia) is added to (even) a kumbha of liquor payable by the king, it renders it very pleasant. Five palas of phánita (sugar) are added to the above in order to increase its flavour. On special occasions (krityeshu), people (kutumbinah, i.e., families) shall be allowed to manufacture white liquor (svetasura), arishta for use in diseases, and other kinds of liquor. On the occasions of festivals, fairs (samája), and pilgrimage, right of manufacture of liquor for four days (chaturahassaurikah) shall be allowed. The Superintendent shall collect the daily fines (daivasikamatyayam, i.e., license fees) from those who on these occasions are permitted to manufacture liquor. Women and children shall collect ‘sura,’ and ‘kinva,’ ‘ferment.’ Those who deal with liquor other than that of the king shall pay five percent as toll. With regard to sura, medaka, arishta, wine, phalámla (acid drinks prepared from fruits), and ámlasídhu (spirit distilled from molasses):&#8211; Having ascertained the day&#8217;s sale of the above kinds of liquor, the difference of royal and public measures (mánavyáji), and the excessive amount of sale proceeds realised thereby, the Superintendent shall fix the amount of compensation (vaidharana) due to the king (from local or foreign merchants for entailing loss on the king&#8217;s liquor traffic) and shall always adopt the best course.” Tr. R. Shamasastry</p>

<p>Satapatha Brahmana 12:7:3:88. There are both milk and Surâ-liquor; for milk is Soma, and the Surâ-liquor food: through the milk he secures the Soma-drink, and through the Surâ-liquor food. And milk is the nobility (chieftaincy), and Surâ-liquor the peasantry (clan); the milk he purifies after purifying the Surâ-liquor: he thus produces the nobility from out of the peasantry, for the nobility is produced from out of the peasantry.</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana also mentions Parishrut (spelt Parisrut) a type of liquor different from Sura,</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana 12:9:1:11. Verily, from this sacrifice the man is born and whatever food a man consumes in this world, that (food), in return, consumes him in yonder world. Now this sacrifice is performed by means of spirituous liquor, and spirituous liquor (parisrut is not to be consumed by a Brâhmana: he thus is born from that which is not (to be) consumed, and the food does not, in return, consume him in yonder world. Therefore this (sacrifice), the Sautrâmanî, is a Brâhmana&#8217;s sacrifice.</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana 5:1:2:14 …and the Parisrut-liquor is neither Soma nor Sura: this is why he buys the Parisrut for a piece of lead from a long haired man.</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana 5.5.4.19 &#8220;&#8230;Let him therefore rather throw them into the fermented liquor (Parisrut)&#8230;let him therefore throw it rather into the spirituous liquor.</p>

<h1>Soma</h1>
<p>Soma plant finds frequent mention in the Vedas. It was of great importance in the Vedic religion. Soma plant is said to have stems and leaves and used to grow in the mountains, Soma plant as a whole, as well as Soma Ras (juice), are also called Andhas. Soma the mythical plant is extinct. Let’s not discuss its botanical features since this article deals with only intoxication in Hinduism. Soma drink was prepared from the leaves of Soma plant by pressing them between stones. It was mixed with water, milk, curd and a few other edible things probably to lessen its intoxicating effect. As per Nirukta 11.2 the word Soma is derived from the root &#8220;Su&#8221; which means &#8220;To Press.&#8221; As per Nirukta 1.11 the word Sura (liquor prepared from grains) is also derived from the root &#8220;Su&#8221; which means &#8220;To press.&#8221; Both the words Sura and Soma are derived from the same root. Before we begin let’s have a look at what prominent Hindu scholars said about Soma,</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">VIEWS OF SCHOLARS</span></strong></p>
<p>Swami Vikvekananda the founder of Ramakrishna Mission wrote,</p>
<p>“And they had a popular plant called Soma. What plant it was nobody knows now; it has entirely disappeared, but from the books we gather that, when crushed, it produced a sort of milky juice, and that was fermented; and it can also be gathered that this <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">fermented Soma juice was intoxicating</span>. This also they offered to Indra and the other gods, and they also drank it themselves. Sometimes they drank a little too much, and so did the gods. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Indra on occasions got drunk</span>. There are passages to show that Indra at one time drank so much of this Soma juice that he talked irrelevant words.” <strong>The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda/Volume 1/Lectures And Discourses/Vedic Religious Ideals</strong><br />

<p>Sri Aurobindo the founder of Sir Aurobindo Ashram wrote,</p>
<p>&#8220;Soma is the Lord of the wine of delight, the wine of immortality. Like Agni he is found in the plants, the growths of earth, and in the waters. The Soma-wine used in the external sacrifice is the symbol of this wine of delight. It is pressed out by the pressing-stone (adri, gravan) which has a close symbolic connection with the thunderbolt, the formed electric force of Indra also called adri&#8230;&#8221; <strong>The Secret of the Veda, p.354, by Sri Aurobindo, Published by SriAurobindoAshram Publication Dept, 2003</strong></p>
<p>Swami Prabhupada the founder of ISKCON is of the same view that Soma was an intoxicating drink, however, he is also of the view that SomRas was not an ordinary intoxicating liquor, it was a special intoxicating liquor made for the gods. He wrote,</p>
<p>“…The demigods are accustomed to drinking the soma-rasa beverage, and therefore the drinking of wine and intoxication are not unknown to them…” <strong>Swami Prabhupada on Srimad Bhagavatam 1.15.34</strong><br />

<p>Dr. B.R Ambedkar the first Law Minister of India wrote,</p>
<p>“Drinking was another evil which was rampant among the Aryans. Liquors were of two sorts Soma and Sura. Soma was a sacrificial wine. The drinking of the Soma was in the beginning permitted only to Brahmins, Kshatriyas and Vaishyas. Subsequently it was permitted only to Brahmins and Kshatriyas. The Vaishyas were excluded from it and the Shudras were never permitted to taste it. Its manufacture was a secret known only to the Brahmins. Sura was open to all and was drunk by all. The Brahmins also drank Sura. Shukracharya the priest to the Asuras drank so heavily that in his drunken state he gave the life giving Mantra known to him only and with which he used to revive the Asuras killed by the Devas—to Katch the son of Brahaspati who was the priest of the Devas. The Mahabharat mentions an occasion when both Krishna and Arjuna were dead drunk. That shows that the best among the Aryan Society were not only not free from the drink habit but that they drank heavily. The most shameful part of it was that even the Aryan women were addicted to drink. For instance Sudeshna the wife of King Virat tells her maid Sairandhri to go to Kichaka’s palace and bring Sura as she was dying to have a drink. It is not to be supposed that only queens indulged in drinking. The habit of drinking was common among women of all classes and even Brahmin women were not free from it. That liquor and dancing was indulged in by the Aryan women is clear from the Kausitaki Grihya Sutra I. 11-12, which says; “Four or eight women who are not widowed, after having been regaled with wine and food are to dance for four times on the night previous to the wedding ceremony.” men, not to speak of women of the lower Varnas, as late as the seventh and eighth centuries- A.D. in the Central region of Aryavarta, is clear from Kumarila Bhatta’s Tantra- Vartika I (iii). 4, which states, “Among the people of modern days we find the Brahmin women of the countries of Ahicchatra and Mathura to be addicted to drinking”. Kumarila condemned the practice in the case of Brahmins only, but not of Kshatriyas and Vaishyas men and women, if the liquor was distilled from fruits or flowers (Madhavi), and Molasses (Gaudi) and not from grains (Sura).” <strong>Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Writings and Speeches, Vol 3, page 154-5 </strong><a href="https://mea.gov.in/images/attach/amb/volume_03.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">https://mea.gov.in/images/attach/amb/volume_03.pdf<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SOMA RAS</span></strong></p>
<p>As you may know, Aryan’s Vedic religion shares many similarities with the Zoroastrians. One of them is Soma plant. Soma in Zoroastrianism is known as Haoma. In the Zoroastrian text Yasna, Haoma (Soma) is considered a mildly intoxicant drink with no harm.</p>
<p>Yasna 10.8 “All other toxicants go hand in hand with Rapine of the bloody spear, but H(a)oma&#8217;s stirring power goes hand in hand with friendship. [Light is the drunkenness of H(a)oma (Pâzand).] Who as a tender son caresses H(a)oma, forth to the bodies of such persons H(a)oma comes to heal.” Tr. L.H. Mills</p>
<p>In the Puranas and Mahabharat, there’s a story of King of Gaya performing a sacrifice in which Indra drank Soma Ras so much that he became intoxicated, I am mentioning all those verses here,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 5.15.12 “In Mahārāja Gaya’s sacrifices, there was a great supply of the intoxicant known as soma. King Indra used to come and become intoxicated by drinking large quantities of soma-rasa. Also, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Viṣṇu [the yajña-puruṣa] also came and personally accepted all the sacrifices offered unto Him with pure and firm devotion in the sacrificial arena.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 4.1.14-18 &#8220;There was never beheld on earth a sacrifice equal to the sacrifice of Marutta: all the implements and utensils were made of gold. Indra was intoxicated with the libations of Soma juice, and the Brahmans were enraptured with the magnificent donations they received.&#8221; Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Mahabharata 12.29.35 “While the king of Anga performed his sacrifice by the hill called Vishnupada, Indra became intoxicated with the Soma he drank, and the Brahmanas with the presents they received.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Mahabharata 1.121.9 &#8220;&#8230;while he was performing a sacrifice the gods with Indra and the great Rishis came to him, and Indra was so intoxicated with the Soma juice he drank and the Brahmanas with the large presents they received&#8230;&#8221; Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Mahabharata 3.88.6-7 &#8220;&#8230;We have heard respecting the sacrificing king Nriga that which really took place while he was performing a sacrifice in the excellent tirtha called Varaha on the Payoshni. In that sacrifice Indra became intoxicated with quaffing the Soma, and the Brahmanas, with the gifts they received&#8230;&#8221; Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Markandeya Purana 129.15-16 &#8220;Equal to Marutta never lived a sacrificer on the face of the earth at whose sacrifice his dwelling house was cast and also golden palaces as largesse, Indra was made intoxicated with Soma and twice-born brahmanas with gifts&#8230;&#8221; Tr. F. Eden Pargiter</p>
<p>Following verses from Veda calls Soma as Mada (intoxicating), I am using Hindi translation by Pandit Ram Govind Trivedi,</p>
<p>ते तवा <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">मदा</span> इन्द्र मादयन्तु शुष्मिणं तुविराधसं जरित्रे |<br />

<p>As you can see, words like Madira (मदिरा) and Mada (मद) have been used in these verses, Madira and Mada both denotes intoxication. Even those fluent in Hindi language can define these words. The word Mada (intoxication) is mentioned in connection with Soma stating that Soma is Mada (intoxicating) in numerous verses such as Rig Veda 1.85.10; 9.107.14; 1.104.9; 2.19.1; 9.12.3; 6.43.1-4; 2.14.1; 9.6.6; Rig Veda 1.84.4 which is also mentioned in Sankhayana Srauta Sutra 12.26.7; Rig Veda Mandala 2, Hymn 15 boasts deeds of Indra done in Intoxication (Mada) of Soma which is translated as rapture by Griffith; Rig Veda 8.14.7 which is elaborated in Aitareya Brahmana 6.7.</p>
<p>V.S Apte defines the word Mada as,</p>

[<strong>The Practical Sanskrit-English Dictionary, by Vaman Shivram Apte, page 836, Published by Shiralkar &amp; Co., 1890</strong>]
<p>Arya Samaji scholar Svami Satya Prakash Sarasvati in his translation of Rig Veda defines it as,</p>
<p>Madah, intoxication; pleasure.<br />
[<strong>Rgveda Samhita, Volume III, page 881, by Svami Satya Prakash Sarasvati &amp; Satyakam Vidyalankar, Published by Veda Pratishthana</strong>]
<p>Ralph T.H. Griffith has translated it as rapture, gladdening, wild joy, etc., and the reason he gave for this is as follows. Ralph T.H Griffith commenting on Rig Veda 1.51.2 quotes Max Mueller on the word Mada (pronounced Mad),</p>
<p>&#8220;Rushing in rapture: when exhilarated by draughts of Soma. &#8216;Here again,&#8217; says Professor Max Muller, ‘The difficulty of rending Vedic though in English, or any other modern language, becomes apparent, for we have no poetical word to express a high state of mental excitement produced by drinking the intoxicating juice of the Soma or other plants, which has not something opprobrious mixed up with it, while in ancient times that state of excitement was celebrated as a blessing of the gods, as not unworthy of the gods themselves, nay, as a state in which both the warrior and the poet would perform their highest achievements. The German Rausch is the nearest approach to the Sanskrit mada.’</p>
<p>In this version, mada has generally been rendered by rapture, delight, transport, or wild joy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Griffith has mentioned Soma as liquor in the following verses like</p>
<p>Rig Veda 2.14.1 “MINISTERS, bring the Soma juice for Indra, pour forth the gladdening liquor with the beakers. To drink of this the Hero longeth ever; offer it to the Bull, for this he willeth.” Tr. Ralph T.H Griffith</p>
<p>Rig Veda 3.48.1 “SOON as the young Bull sprang into existence he longed to taste the pressed-out Soma&#8217;s liquor. Drink thou thy fill, according to thy longing, first, of the goodly mixture blent with Soma.”</p>
<p>Rig Veda 4.34.5 “Out of what substance was that chalice fashioned which ye made fourfold by your art and wisdom? Now for the gladdening draught press out the liquor, and drink, O Ṛbhus, of die meath of Soma.”</p>
<p>Rig Veda 4.44.4 “Borne on your golden car, ye omnipresent! come to this sacrifice of ours, Nāsatyas.</p>
<p>Drink of the pleasant liquor of the Soma give riches to the people who adore you.”</p>
<p>Griffith translated Rig Veda 9.32.1 as,</p>
<p>पर सोमासो मदच्युतः शरवसे नो मघोनः |<br />
सुता विदथे अक्रमुः ||</p>
<p>pra somāso madacyutaḥ śravase no maghonaḥ |<br />
sutā vidathe akramuḥ ||</p>
<p>Rig Veda 9.32.1 &#8220;The rapture-shedding Soma-drops, effused in our assembly, have Flowed forth to glorify our prince.&#8221; Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>This is elaborated in Panchavimsha Brahmana as,</p>
<p>Pancavimsa Brahmana XI.5.1 &#8220;(The verse beginning:) &#8216;Forth (has) the intoxicating madacyut) Soma&#8217; is the gayatri; intoxicating (having mada) (and) rich in sap is the afternoon service; he, thereby, puts intoxication (and) sap (in it)&#8230;&#8221; Tr. W. Caland</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">FERMENTED SOMA</span></strong></p>
<p>As far as my knowledge is concerned, Soma by itself was mildly intoxicating and was made fully intoxicating through the fermentation process. Veda and Brahmana indicate that Soma was fermented and Swami Vivekananda also mentions that Soma was fermented and that fermented juice was intoxicating. Veda, Brahmana and Srauta Sutra state that Soma was mixed with barley [Rig Veda 9.68.4; Atharva Veda 20.24.7], it was kept for three days probably for the fermentation to complete.</p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.187.9 &#8220;What Soma, we enjoy from thee in milky food or barley-brew, Vātāpi, grow thou fat thereby.” Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>Rig Veda 9.17.3 &#8220;Soma, with swelling waves, exhilarating, inebriating, flows to the straining-cloth, destroying the Rakshasas, and devoted to the gods.&#8221; Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Following verses mentions about a day or 3 days old Soma,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.45.10 &#8220;Bring with joint invocations thou, O Agni, the celestial host: Here stands the Soma, bounteous gods: drink this expressed ere yesterday.&#8221; Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>Rig Veda 3.58.7 &#8220;O Asvins, very mighty ones, with Vayu and with his steeds, one-minded, ever-youthful, Nasatyas, joying in the third day&#8217;s Soma, drink it, not hostile, very bounteous givers.&#8221; Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>There’s one more verse from Yajur Veda which talks about the fermentation of Soma, I have mentioned this in the Sautramani sacrifice, you can read Yajur Veda 19.1, Baudhayana Srauta Sutra XVII.32 and Satapatha Brahmana, Kanda 12, Adhyaya 7, Brahmana 3, Verses 5-6 mentioned above. William Scott Shelley has explained fermentation of Soma in the following way,</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p>“In the preparation of the Soma beverage, the Soma stalks were boiled [Satapatha Brahmana XII.7.3.6], and remained standing for three nights [Baudhayana Srauta Sutra XVII.32]. The Taiitriya Samhita contains the mythological justification for keeping Soma for three nights: &#8220;When the Soma was being borne away, the Gandharva Vicvavasu stole it. It was for three nights stolen; therefore after purchase the Soma is kept for three nights [Taittriya Samhita VI.1.6.4]. Referring to Sura, an alcoholic beverage produced from fermented grain, the Satapatha Brahmana states: &#8220;He distils (i.e., boils) it with a view to )its being alike) the Soma-pressing. For three nights it remains standing, for the Soma remains standing for three nights after it has been brought [Satapatha Brahmana XII.7.3.6].&#8221; The Atharva Veda also makes reference to &#8220;him that takes pains, and cooks and presses the soma [Atharva Veda XI.1.30].&#8221; According to the Vedic literature, the Soma liquor was fermented. The directions in the Soma rite include the word Parisrut, &#8220;spirituous liquor [Satapatha Brahmana XII.8.2.15],&#8221; and this is also indicated in the Rgveda by the term Vatapi, &#8220;fermenting&#8221; of the Soma liquor [Rgveda I.187.10]: &#8220;What, Soma, we enjoy from thee in milky food or barley-brew, Vatapi, grow thou fat thereby [Rgveda I.187.10].&#8221;</p>
<p>Following the fermenting of the liquor, the Soma stalks were removed from the vessel and crushed between two stones on a cowhide [Rgveda IX.65.25, IX.79.4, X.94.9], or with a mortar and pestle [Rgveda I.28.1-6, IX.46.3]. The Rgveda tells of Soma libations &#8220;fifteenfold strong [Rgveda X.27.2], and with the addition of water [Rgveda IX.75.9, IX.107.2], which diluted the mixture and caused crushed Soma stalks to swell [Rgveda VIII.9.19, IX.64.8, IX.107.12], the Soma juice was poured over the stalks upon the cowhide, and filtered through a strainer made of cloth or wool [Rgveda VIII.2.2, IX.12.4, IX.13.1]. The Soma stalks were brown (babhru), ruddy (aruna), or tawny (hari) color [Rg Veda VIII.9.19], and Soma juice was also brown [Rgveda IX.33.2, IX.63.4, 6], ruddy [Rgveda IX.45.3], or tawny [Rgveda IX.3.9, IX.98.7]. This beverage is described in the Rgveda as &#8220;good to taste and full of sweetness, verily it is strong and rich in flavour.&#8221; Indicating that the fermenting of the liquor preceeded the pressing, Soma was often drunk unmmixed [Rgveda I.135.3, V.2.3, VII.90.2, IX.72.4], or it was mixed with milk [Rgveda I.23.1, VIII.2.3, VIII.90.10, IX.11.2, 5, IX.64.28, IX.72.1, IX.101.12, IX.107.2], butter [Rgveda X.29.6], curd [I.5.5, V.51.7, VII.32.4, IX.11.6, IX.101.12], or barley [Rgveda I.187.9, III.35.3, 7, III.52.1, IX.68.4].&#8221;<br />

<p>In folk tradition, Shiva is often associated with cannabis, Sadhus imitates him by smoking weed.

<p>Written by Sulaiman Razvi</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Do mention the link of this blog when you copy any verse</span></strong></p>
<p>You may have heard a lot of Hindus saying that Hinduism is a very peaceful and tolerant religion (or the way of life as they say). Hindus say that unlike other religions (hinting at Islam and Christianity) you will not be punished or put into hell for rejecting the Hindu faith or blaspheming the religion. I was reading the book The Land of the Lingam by Arthur Miles, I read only the first few pages but I found one very interesting observation by Arthur Miles, he wrote,</p>
<p>&#8220;Ask any Hindu to explain his religion, and he will wander off into a labyrinth of words from which nothing will extricate him but the end of your endurance. If you comment on his belief, he will tell you that you do not understand. &#8216;You do not understand&#8217; is always the last word of the Hindu.&#8221;</p>
<p><span id="more-2672"></span></p>
<p>Hindus will first claim that Hinduism is a very tolerant religion and when you show any violent verse from any Hindu scripture he would be startled to read the verse and try to escape the argument, on failing to explain any verse he will claim that Hindus don&#8217;t behead people for the difference in faith. Hindus would very comfortably call Muslims terrorists or being terrorist sympathizers but they turn a blind eye when it comes to Hindu terrorists. Leave aside condemning Hindu terrorism, Hindus don&#8217;t even consider Hindu terror organizations to be terrorists, they call them patriots and social workers and they outrightly deny the existence of Hindu terrorism. No community on the earth glorifies terrorism except the Hindu community. I recommend them to go through <a href="https://vedkabhed.wordpress.com/2013/10/06/how-peaceful-are-hindus/" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">How peaceful are Hindus<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> to know about the violence perpetrated by Hindus. According to the <a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/around-3-400-communal-riots-took-place-from-2016-2020-centre-101648611989880.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Central Government<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, MoS home affairs Nityanand Rai, India witnessed 3,399 cases of communal or religious rioting during the period 2016-2020. India is probably the only country in the world that faces such a large number of communal clashes probably because Hindus are majority in India. There is no communal violence in Mayalsia, Indonesia where Hindus are minority with a Muslim majority population. These two countries are perfect examples because those states have religious diversity like India. Hindus boast about India being a secular state which is the home of over 90% of all Hindus in the world. It&#8217;s quite funny that on the one hand, they boast about India&#8217;s secularism only to portray themselves as champions of secularism which is only for image building, and on the other hand, they dream of establishing Hindu Rashtra (State) via ethnic cleansing or subjugation of minorities. India is secular not because Hindus are majority but because of people like Mahatma Gandhi, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, and Dr. B.R. Ambedkar and all these persons are hated by Hindu extremists, they even want to build Nathuram Godse temple the assassin of Mahatma Gandhi. If majority of Hindus had really been secular, then the right wing would not have thrived in India. Hindu leaders giving hate speech against minorities gets full support from Hindus and no case will be lodged against them. Some Hindu leaders talk about killing Muslims and Christian, some vandalize Mosques and Churches, some talks about raping minority women, some leaders who killed Muslims in riots gets Z+ security, people are lynched for eating beef, some are shot dead for expressing their views on Hinduism, a Hindu leader talks about demolishing Mosques, another one talks about finishing off Islam and Christianity from India by 2022. All these are happening in a secular India, imagine what would&#8217;ve happened to minorities if India had been a Hindu state. Dr. B.R Ambedkar had rightly said,</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p>&#8220;The Hindus claim to be a very tolerant people. In my opinion this is a mistake. On many occasions they can be intolerant and if on some occasions they are tolerant that is because they are too weak to oppose or too indifferent to oppose.&#8221; <a href="http://ccnmtl.columbia.edu/projects/mmt/ambedkar/web/section_11.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #0000ff;">Source</span></strong><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p></blockquote>
<p>When a Muslim man was lynched on rumors that he ate beef, a magazine belonging to a Hindu terror outfit justified the killing by saying that <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Vedas-say-kill-those-who-slaughter-cows-Panchjanya/articleshow/49445823.cms" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Vedas say kill those who slaughter cows<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. The way Hinduism treats its own Shudras reveals whether it is peaceful or violent, not to speak of what it says about other religions, <a href="http://www.thecitizen.in/index.php/OldNewsPage/?Id=1465" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">every 18 minutes a crime is committed against a Dalit<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> and all these have scriptural sanctions. Some Hindus also say that they don&#8217;t use verses from their scripture to justify the killing of non-Hindus. That&#8217;s true because they would&#8217;ve cited verses only if they were familiar with their scriptures. Common Hindus don&#8217;t cite verses from Hindu scriptures because they have never read them. Surely they don&#8217;t cite their scriptures but violence perpetrated on minorities by Hindus is surely inspired by their religion. You will find hundreds of Hindu scholars spewing venom against non Hindus but you will hardly find any who try to foster the relationship between Hindus and non-Hindus. Hindu scholars spewing venom in their Dharm Sansads only proved that Hinduism is violent because Hindu scholars are well acquainted with their texts. Why were people lynched for eating beef and transporting cows if Hindus don&#8217;t believe in their scriptures? Why atrocities against Dalits is rampant if Hindus don&#8217;t get inspiration from their scriptures? When you show something from Hindu scriptures, the Hindu would quickly reply that &#8216;Our religion is not like Islam and Christianity dependent on one book, We believe in whatever we want to and reject whatever we want to, we don&#8217;t need scriptures.&#8217; If Hindus don&#8217;t require Hindu scriptures, then on what basis Babri mosque was demolished? Because it was believed to be the birthplace of a mythological figure called Rama mentioned in Ramayana for which there is no archaeological evidence to prove that he ever existed. Do Hindus directly get revelation from God on how to perform Puja and all, that they don&#8217;t need Hindu scriptures? Well, this is one of the tricks used by Hindus in argument as Hindu scriptures are fallible, they can&#8217;t be defended, Hindus would resort to many such tricks to find an easy route to escape.</p>
<p>When you talk about violence in India, Hindu fanatics will never talk about that rather he will start his whataboutery. And then shamelessly accuse others of being violent. <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/amnesty-annual-report-condemns-growing-intolerance-in-india/" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Amnesty International annual report condemns growing intolerance in India<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, <a href="http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/intolerance-in-india-rose-in-2015-says-uscirf/articleshow/52084719.cms" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">USCIRF report shows religious intolerance rose in India in the year 2015<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. Instead of correcting themselves and stop supporting Hindu hate mongers, Hindus will rather say that &#8216;You first see what&#8217;s happening in so and so country, go and condemn that first&#8217; or else will tell you that &#8216;if you are so uncomfortable in India then leave and go to some other country&#8217;. Such is their hypocrisy. They suddenly develop love for the world when communal violence in India is discussed. If violence is perpetrated by some non-Hindu even in a country far away from India then Hindus will view it as an act of barbarism, religious bigotry and will blame the culprit&#8217;s religion but if the same kind of incident is perpetrated by Hindus then Hindus view it as an act of bravery and would applaud the act, and they would start whataboutery to divert the topic. They would be overwhelmed to hear that a particular number of Muslims have been killed in a particular country but will find no problem going to Christian and Muslim countries to earn their bread and butter. Hindus will insult other religions even if any crime like theft and murder is committed by a non-Hindu, they would drag religion even in such stray crimes (which has nothing to do with religion) but they would never ever say a word against Hinduism when Hindu priests are caught in rape and murder cases, when Dalit is killed, when there is honour killing due to inter-caste marriage, when there is an attack on minority, etc.</p>
<p>Hindus leave no stone unturned in calling other religions violent but are unaware of their own religion. All such violence is inspired by their religious text. Without reading any scripture Hindus would conclude that Hinduism is peaceful, promotes the idea of universal brotherhood and that other religions like Buddhism and Jainism are also accepted. Hindus claim that you can even be an atheist and attain salvation, you will not be put in hell for rejecting Hinduism, etc. All these claims of Hindus shall be refuted in this article. Read the entire article for better understanding as some verses dealing with the same subject are posted in different categories.<a id="top"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a id="intolerance-within-Hinduism"></a>Intolerance within Hindu caste and sect</h2>
<p>Hinduism is perhaps the only religion that divides its believers into castes and sects. There is birth-based discrimination. Hinduism says that people responsible for a mixture of caste will be put into hell fire, Shudra kings in the Kali Yuga will be slain by Kalki avatar, Shudra who takes up the duty of Brahmin will be punished, etc.,</p>
<p>Brahma Purana 106.121 &#8220;There is a hell named Gudapaka. It is full of boiling eddies of treacle and molasses. A man responsible for the mixture in castes is thrown into it. He is burnt therein.&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Some scriptures also say that Kalki will kill Shudra kings and all those people born of mixed castes,</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana 1.2.31.77-84 &#8220;In the previous Svayambhuva Manvantara, he had been born of a part of Madhava (Visnu). For a full period of twenty years, he wandered over the Earth taking with him an army along with horses, chariots and elephants.

<p>Shudras cannot even drink the milk of tawny cow,</p>
<p>Varaha Purana 112.19-21 &#8220;Those (Sudras) who drink (the milk of) Kapila make their forefathers eat the filth in the earth for long. Note what happens to the Sudras who feed on the milk, ghee and butter of the Kapila cows. They go to the terrible hell called Raurava.&#8221; Tr. Venkitasubramonia Iyer</p>
<p>Inter-mingling of Shudras and Brahmanas is evil of Kali Yuga,</p>

<p>Kurma Purana I.30.6 &#8220;In Kaliyuga, the Sudras will have close association with the Brahmanas by the use of spells and incantations as well as through the sharing of beds, seats and food.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Intolerance towards Shudras is briefly explained in articles <a href="https://vedkabhed.wordpress.com/2015/06/05/caste-system-in-hinduism/" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Caste system in Hinduism<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> and <a href="https://vedkabhed.wordpress.com/2015/05/01/manu-smriti-and-untouchables/" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Manu Smriti and Untouchables<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>.</p>

<h3><a id="intolerance-sects"></a>Intolerance towards sects</h3>
<p>Hinduism also has sects. Other than dividing people into castes Hinduism also sanctions sects. At present time there are many sects of Hinduism like Lingayat, Arya Samaj, ISKCON, etc. There are mainly two sects in Hinduism Shaivism and Vaishnavism. Shaivites are followers of Shiva and Vaishnavites are followers of Vishnu and his avatars. Shaivite Puranas do recognize Vishnu and his avatars as Gods and Vaishnavite Puranas also recognize Shiva as God. But Shaivite scriptures hail Shiva as the Supreme God and depict Vishnu as a weak god while Vaishnavite scriptures call Vishnu as the Supreme God and humiliate Shiva. There have also been some clashes between these two groups,</p>
<p><a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/on-the-eve-of-kumbh-a-conflict-between-priests-and-sadhus/" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/on-the-eve-of-kumbh-a-conflict-between-priests-and-sadhus/<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>A similar clash happened in the 19<sup>th</sup> century also,</p>
<p>&#8220;At the Kumbh Mela at Ujjain in 1826, a combined army of Vaishnavite warrior-sadhus and Maratha soldiers inflicted a harsh military defeat on the Shaivite sadhus, and ended up plundering their temples and monasteries. Later, while the British put an end to the regular bouts of violence between the warrior-sadhus Shaivites and Vaishnavites, they made separate arrangements for both orders at the Kumbh Melas at Allahabad and Hardwar to prevent bloodshed over which sadhu order should have precedence in bathing in the Ganga.&#8221; The Radical Humanist, Volume 67, by Manabendra Nath Roy, p.13 also mentioned by Yoginder Sikand <a href="http://www.islamicvoice.com/january.98/FEAT1.HTM" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">http://www.islamicvoice.com/january.98/FEAT1.HTM<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>Visit by naga sadhus at Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams leads to ‘suddhi’<br />
<a href="http://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/current-affairs/160717/visit-by-naga-sadhus-leads-to-suddhi.html" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">http://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/current-affairs/160717/visit-by-naga-sadhus-leads-to-suddhi.html<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>In Tamil Nadu two groups of Vaishnavite Hindus namely Vadakalai and Thenkalai fought each after a dispute over whether to hold prayer in Sanskrit or Tamil <a href="https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/vadakalai-and-thenkalai-iyengars-come-blows-again-over-sanskrit-vs-tamil-prayer-102453" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/vadakalai-and-thenkalai-iyengars-come-blows-again-over-sanskrit-vs-tamil-prayer-102453<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>Although both these sects co-exist today but there seems to have a tiff between them in the scriptures. There is a battle of supremacy in both Shaivite and Vaishnavite scriptures. Shaivite scriptures show that Vishnu and his avatars worshiped Shiva,</p>
<p>Linga Purana Section I, 98.159-162 &#8220;Suta said: Thus he eulogised the bull-bannered lord with his thousand names. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The lord (i.e. Visnu) bathed Siva and worshipped him with lotus flowers. In order to test Visnu</span>, Mahesvara the lord of the worlds hid one of the lotus flowers intended for the worship. Visnu from whom the flowers was taken away thought thus, &#8216;What is this?&#8217; <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">After realising thee loss of the flower Visnu plucked out his eye and devoutly worshipped the preceptor of the universe</span>, the support of all beings. He worshipped him repeating the last name of the lord.&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a Linga Purana story to show Shiva&#8217;s superiority over Vishnu. Another story shows that the Sudarshana Chakra (Discus) which Vishnu wielded was actually given by Shiva as a boon to Vishnu after Vishnu rigorously worshiped Shiva,</p>
<p>Linga Purana Section I.98.1-3 &#8220;The sages said: O Suta, how was the discus Sudarsana acquired from Mahesvara, the lord of Devas, by lord Visnu? It behoves you to recount it. Suta said: A terrible fight ensued between Devas and the leading Asuras causing destruction to all living beings. On being pierced and hit by lances, iron clubs, javelins and arrows of bent knots Devas became extremely terrified and fled. [18-26] <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Lord Visnu said: O Devas, I shall approach lord Siva now along with all the eternal Devas and shall carry out your task in full</span>. O Devas, after acquiring the discus, formerly made by the slayer of the Tripuras in order to kill Jalandhara, I shall kill all the six thousand eight hundred great Asuras and Daityas beginning with Dhundhu&#8230;Suta said: After saying this to the excellent Devas, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Visnu, the excellent one among Devas, remembered lord Siva worshipped him</span>. On the splendid summit of the Himavan he duly installed the Linga that resembled the mountain Meru. It had been made by Visvakarman. Repeating the hymn called Tvarita-Rudra and the Rudrasukta he bathed the Linga and worshipped it with scents. It was charming in its flame-like form. He eulogised Rudra; worshipped him in the fire and bowed down to him. Repeating the thousand names in order he worshipped lord Siva&#8230; [169-170] <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Glancing lovingly at Visnu who stood aside with palms joined in reverence, Sankara, Mahadeva said </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">smilingly. O Visnu, the task of Devas has been well understood by me. I shall give you the splendid discuss Sudarsana</span>.&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>This is how Shaivite Purana shows Shiva as the supreme god. Another Shaivite scripture says that,</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Kotirudrasamhita 4.27.35-42 &#8220;Gautama said:- You are evil-minded desiring to put me in distress as I am a devotee of Siva. Hence you shall be averse to the Vedas always. Henceforth your faith in the rites of the Vedas, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">particularly with reference to the path of Siva yielding salvation shall cease to exist&#8230;fall, ye all, deep into the hell</span>&#8230;You will not have Siva as your sole deity. You will be considering the matchless Siva on a par with other gods&#8230;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">All your descendants-sons, grandsons and other, O brahmins, shall be non-Saivites. You shall stay certainly in hell along with your sons.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</span></p>
<p>These verses are implying that being a Shaivite alone can bring you salvation and being non-Shaivite will lead you to hell. A story also shows that Vaishnavite were averse to Shiva,</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Rudrasamhita 2, Parvatikhanda III.33.5-6 &#8220;Now, a certain brahmin professing Vaisnava cult came here and spoke very critically about Siva. Ever since, the mother of Parvati has gone out of sense. Hence she does not wish her daughter&#8217;s marriage with Siva.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Another verse from Shiva Purana says that only those sons who are Shaivite shall receive the inheritance,</p>
<p>Shiva Purana Vayaviyasamhita 6, section II.39.58-60 &#8220;&#8230;The descendant shall propitiate devotees. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Only a devotee of Siva shall inherit his wealth</span>. If his children are not initiated in Saivite cult the wealth shall be handed over the Siva. No child shall take it.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Contrary to those Shaivite verses other Puranas (mostly Vaishnavite) praise Vaishnavism and hail Vishnu as the supreme god, Sage Narada said,</p>
<p>Garuda Purana I.99.6-7 &#8220;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The following should not be entertained</span>. A sickly person, a person deficient in limbs or having additional appendages, a one-eyed man, son of a widow after remarriage, a fallen sinner like Avakirna and those who do not conform to conventions, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">and a a-Vaisnava (non-believer in Visnu). These are not worthy of being invited for Sraddha</span>. They (the deserving brahmins) shall be invited the day before when they shall observe celibacy.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Skanda Purana II.ii.10.120-1 &#8220;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">(As opposed to these) Avaisnavas (&#8216;non-devotees of Visnu&#8217;) hate auspicious conduct of (other) men</span>. They themselves indulge in evil conduct and evil thoughts in the minds. They are undisturbed even if great misfortune befalls them. They take delight in sexual enjoyment. Those Avaisnavas are inebriated. They do not resort to the Lord even for a moment, although he is the cause of supreme happiness and is present in the lotus of the heart. They always cover up the names of Hari by means of aimless, worthless and futile network of words&#8230;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Indeed those devoid of devotion to Visnu are human brutes</span>.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">One who blasphemes a Vaisnava cannot be protected by anyone. Even if a person is as strong as Lord Siva</span>, if he blasphemes a Vaisnava, he is sure to be destroyed. This is the verdict of all sastras. If one does not care for the verdict of the sastras and dares blaspheme a Vaisnava, he suffers life after life because of this.&#8221; <strong>Chaitanya Bhagavata Madhya 22 by Vrindavana Dasa Thakura, Tr. Swami Prabhupada</strong></p>
<p>A Purana even says that one should not reside in a kingdom where the king is not a Vaishnavite,</p>
<p>Skanda Purana II.v.11.23-24 &#8220;Bharadvaja said: Well asked, O highly fortunate one, since you are a devotee of Visnu. The earth that you protect, O king, is blessed. The subjects (governed by you) are good (blessed). One shall not stay in that kingdom where the king is not a Vaisnava. Better to stay in a forest or in a Tirtha but not in a realm where there are no Vaisnavas.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Vaishnavite scripture suggests that sage Bhrigu was a Vaishnavite, sage Bhrigu curses followers of Shiva in the following way at a particular incident,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 4.2.28-29 &#8220;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">One who takes a vow to satisfy Lord Śiva or who follows such principles will certainly become an atheist and be diverted from transcendental scriptural injunctions</span>. Those who vow to worship Lord Śiva are so foolish that they imitate him by keeping long hair on their heads. When initiated into worship of Lord Śiva, they prefer to live on wine, flesh and other such things. Bhṛgu Muni continued: Since you blaspheme the Vedas and the brāhmaṇas, who are followers of the Vedic principles, it is understood that you have already taken shelter of the doctrine of atheism.&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p><strong>Swami Prabhupada writes:</strong> &#8220;It is sometimes seen that devotees of Lord Śiva imitate the characteristics of Lord Śiva. For example, Lord Śiva drank an ocean of poison, so some of the followers of Lord Śiva imitate him and try to take intoxicants like gāñjā (marijuana). Here the curse is that if someone follows such principles he must become an infidel and turn against the principles of Vedic regulation. It is said that such devotees of Lord Śiva will be sac-chāstra-paripanthinaḥ, which means &#8220;opposed to the conclusion of śāstra, or scripture.&#8217;…&#8221; <strong>Swami Prabhupada on Srimad Bhagavatam 4.2.28 </strong><a href="http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_4.2.28" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right"><span style="color: #000000;">http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_4.2.28</span><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>Swami Prabhupada also writes,</p>
<p>&#8220;Lord Śiva&#8217;s symptoms of austerity are not exactly those of a Vaiṣṇava. Lord Śiva is certainly the number one Vaiṣṇava, but he exhibits a feature for a particular class of men who cannot follow the Vaiṣṇava principles. The Śaivites, the devotees of Lord Śiva, generally dress like Lord Śiva, and sometimes they indulge in smoking and taking intoxicants. Such practices are never accepted by the followers of Vaiṣṇava rituals.&#8221; <strong>Swami Prabhupada on Srimad Bhagavatam 4.6.36. </strong><a href="http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_4.6.36" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_4.6.36<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>Many Hindus were offended when a guy impersonated Shiva in the movie P.K and ran fearing his life, Hindus who were offended by this attacked theatres and called for a boycott of the film and upcoming films of the lead actor. I am wondering if they will tear and burn up this scripture in which Shiva is depicted in such a humiliating way. The story says that a fight between Shiva and Krishna erupted and Krishna defeated Shiva. Shiva was so scared of Krishna&#8217;s fiery that he ran away in fear and hid in a mountain.</p>
<p>Skanda Purana II.ii.12.14-18 &#8220;&#8230;Nila mountain is in the third Yojana (i.e. 3X12 Kms.). This is the holy spot of the Lord of Gauri named Ekamrakavana. Not far off, O king, is the place where, being afraid, he sought refuge. Indradyumna said: Why was the Lord of Gauri (Siva) frightened? With whom did he seek refuge?&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a Shaivite Purana but according to the translator, this is invented by Vaishnavites to show Krishna&#8217;s superiority. The translator Ganesh Vasudeo Tagare wrote,</p>
<p>&#8220;A Vaisnavite twist to show the inferiority of Siva to Visnu. The fight between Siva and Visnu for one king of Kasi (Kasiraja) and the subsequent defeat of Siva and his praise of Visnu and Siva&#8217;s departure from Varanis to Ekamra Vana (vv50-79)-all this is invented to show Visnu&#8217;s superiority.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although Skanda Purana is a Shaivite Purana but it may have also been composed by Vaishnavites that&#8217;s why there are many verses praising Vishnu and ridiculing Shiva as G.V. Tagare rightly points out. The war between Shiva and Krishna/Vishnu is explained briefly in <a href="#fighting-eachother" class="broken_link">God fighting each other</a> category. Shiva helps his devotee to fight Krishna/Vishnu and he is humiliated in the following way,</p>
<p>Skanda Purana II.ii.12.81-85a &#8220;Mahadeva said: O lord of Devas&#8230;carrying out your behest will be the cause of my welfare, O lord of the worlds. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">On account of my stupidity, I Lord, I had been arrogant. There, O Lord, your own blessing is the cause of my fickleness</span>. Since you command me, O Lord of Devas, to proceed to Purusottama, I shall carry out your behest reverently and proceed to the auspicious holy place that bestows salvation. Do a favour to me and promise that you alone will protect and sustain my sacred region Purusottama&#8230;&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>This is also explained in<a href="#fighting-eachother" class="broken_link"> Gods fighting each other</a> category. Just like this verse, Vishnu is also ridiculed in a Shaivite Purana,</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Satarudra Samhita 3.23.13-16 &#8220;When his pride fell off, Visnu was dejected, and dispirited. He then realised that Siva was sporting about in the form of a bull. Then on realising that Siva himself had come in the form of a Bull, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Visnu spoke in a shrill voice with drooping shoulders and palms joined in reverence</span>. Visnu said: O lord of the gods, O ocean of mercy, O lord Siva, I had been deluded by your Maya and my mind had been confused. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">O lord, I fought with you, Siva. Taking pity on me, O lord, let this offence be excused</span>.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>This verse is also explained in <a href="#fighting-eachother" class="broken_link">Gods fighting each other</a> category.</p>

<h3><a id="kapalika"></a>Kapalika</h3>
<p>Kapalika was Shaivite sect. The Aghori Sadhus are an offshoot of this sect. Followers of Kapalika sect used human skull as a begging bowl and also used to eat food from it, they applied ashes from crematorium and had many such weird practices. Kapalika sect has gone extinct but we can get a sense of their belief from Aghoris which is an offshoot of Kapalika. You can understand it better by looking at the following graph taken from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kapalika" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Wikipedia<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shiva is said to be a Kapalin himself,</p>
<p>Skanda Purana V.iii.214.2-3 &#8220;The lord wandered over the earth as a Kapalin (holder of a skull) wearing patched garments. He was surrounded by Pisacas, Raksasas, Dakinis, and Yoginis. He assumed the form of Bhairava and resorted to a cremation ground where he performed an elaborate penance causing freedom from fear to all the three worlds&#8230;&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Shiva Purana Ruda-Samhita 2, Satikhanda section II.27.22 &#8220;Daksa, the evil-minded, did not invite Siva for that sacrifice, deciding that He was not worthy of taking part in the sacrifice because he was a Kapalin.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>In Varaha Purana 97.1 Shiva is infuriated when Brahma calls him Kapalin. I have mentioned this verse in <a href="#fighting-eachother" class="broken_link"><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #0000ff;">Gods fighting each other</span></a> category.</p>
<p>Kapalikas are praised,</p>
<p>Skanda Purana I.iii.(P).8.76-80 &#8220;May the eminent sages staying in them protect the system of the worship of Siva. The devotees of Siva and the Pasupatas shall beg for alms (for their sustenance). Let these and the others of Yogic power and practice, as well as the Kapalikas always protect this holy spot. All the kings of past, present and future shall protect this spot without any disobedience to their commands&#8230;&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Rishi Upamanyu praises Kapalins,</p>
<p>Shiva Purana Vayaviyasamhita 6, Section II, 31.173-4 &#8220;[Upamanya said] The followers of Siva who adhere to the philosophical path, those who perform <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">the Pasupata rites those who observe holy rites and the Saivite holy men such as Kapalikas</span>-all these are adherents and executors of Siva&#8217;s behests. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">They shall be worshipped by me at the behest of Siva. May these bless me</span>. Let them praise the successful holy rite.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Kapalika Vrata prescribed by Shiva in general,</p>
<p>Skanda Purana V.i.6.84-94 &#8220;&#8230;[Shiva said] O sinless Devas, since I came over here it is called Mahakalavana. To you also who wished to perform austerities, it is Mahakalavana (forest of great opportunity). This secret holy shrine will become renowned in the world with this twin name. It is a secret forest. It is the cremation ground. It is the greatest and most majestic of all holy spots. This Kalavrtacarya (performace of Kapala Vrata) has been proclaimed by me. The devotee embellished with Kapala Vrata should take food in the Kapala (skull). The Kapala should always be held in the hand. He should be contented with the alms thus received in the course of his Vrata. He should (outwardly) adopt terrific features and reside in the cremation ground&#8230;He should adorn all limbs with holy ash&#8230; Formerly I too had adopted the Kapala Vrata and practised it. Kapala is the greatest of all secrets, holy and destructive of sins…[96] If out of delusion any man hates this Mahavrata, he will be overpowered by sins. Even after hundreds and crores of births, he is not rid of that sin. Hence no one should hate or violate it&#8230;&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Kapalika sect and other Shaivite sects are condemned in Vaishnavite Purana and Shaktism and even say that Shiva created these sects to delude people,</p>
<p>Srimad Devi Bhagavatam 7.39.21-30 &#8220;…The S&#8217;âstras that are extant, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">as contrary to the S&#8217;rutis and Smritis, are all Tâmasa S&#8217;âstras</span>, Mahâdeva has framed these Vâma, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Kâpâlak, Kaulaks, Bhairava</span> and such like S&#8217;astras for fascinating the people; else he has no object in framing them…&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Varaha Purana 174.42-42 &#8220;The Brahmana said: He who dies with the food given by a Sudra within him, becomes ghost. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">By mere contact of, not to say sitting together or eating with, Nagas (a naked sect), Kapalikas or Pasandas, one becomes a ghost</span>.&#8221; Tr. Venkitasubramonia Iyer, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Kurma Purana II.39.56-62 &#8220;Indeed the holy Pasupata vow has been formerly designed by me for the achievement of liberation. It is the greatest of all secrets. It is the subtlest essence of the Vedas. One who performs Pasupataa vow, shall be quiescent; he must have perfect self-control; he should dust his body with sacred ashes; he should observe celibacy and remain naked. Or he should wear a loin-cloth or a single garment; he should be silent and engaged in the study of Vedas. The scholar shall meditate on Siva as Pasupati. Sruti states that this Pasupata Yoga should be resorted by the seekers of liberation; that those who maintain Pasupata rite should be free from desire&#8230;There are other scriptures opposed to the Vedic view. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">They have been propounded by me alone and they are very fascinating in this world. Those cults are Vama, Pasupata</span>, the Soma cult, the Lakura (Lakula) and the Bhairava and such other cults which are opposed to Veda should not be resorted to.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Kurma Purana II.16.15 &#8220;One should not even verbally revere and honour the heretics, those who indulge in wrong actions, those who perform black magic, the Pancaratras and the Pasupatas.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>There is another Shaivite sect called Nakula which is also condemned in Vaishnavite Purana. A story in Kurma Purana says that Shiva urged Vishnu to create scriptures for deluding the sinners, on being urged by Shiva, Vishnu creates it and he then urges Shiva to also create some deluding cults. Urged by Vishnu, Shiva creates some sects which include Kapalika, Pasupata, and Nakula as mentioned in this Vaishnavite Purana in an effort to declare these Shaivite sects as deceitful and heretic sects,</p>
<p>Kurma Purana I.16.117-9 &#8220;Hence, O bull-bannered lord, we shall compose scriptures for deluding the sinners and for saving those who are out of the pale of the Vedas.&#8217; Thus addressed by Visnu, the slayer of Mura, Rudra composed deluding Scriptures and Kesava too did the same, on being urged by Siva. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">They were the treatises of the cults of Kapala, Nakula, Vama, Bhairava, both of Western and Eastern variety. Pancaratra, Pasupata and thousands of other cults as well</span>.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Ganesh Vasudeo Tagare writes &#8220;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The list shows what sects were regarded as being out of the pale of Vedic religion in KP. Out of these, Kapalas, or Kapalikas whether Brahminic or non-Brahminic</span>, ate and drank in human skulls, wore garlands of skulls and indulged in horrid practices of wine-drinking, in sexual orgies and living in unclean manner (S.N. Dasgupta Ind. Phil. V.P.2, 3). <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Nakulas are the followers of Nakula or Lakulisa, a semi-historical founder of a sect of Saivism. In the Vayu P.23.2.17-23 and the LO.I.24, he is said to be an incarnation of Siva</span> in a cemetry and Kayavarohana in Bhrgu ksetra, in Dabhoi Tehsil in Gujarat. Vama is a general term for the (Sakta?) observers of socially disapproved practices, the group being designated as Five Ma-karas. Bhairavas are also Saivites who worshipped Bhairava form of Siva. Bhairava-worship has been very popular among the masses in Maharashtra. Pancaratras, the Vasudeva worshippers who were later accommodated by the followers of Veda, held the famous Catur-vyuha (the four manifestations of Vasudeva) doctrine and had their own way of worship, are quite famous. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Pasupatas are the followers of system founded by Umapati Srikantha (or Siva) and they are mentioned in Mbh. Santi. 337.62</span>&#8230;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kurma Purana II.39.56-62 &#8220;Indeed the holy Pasupata vow has been formerly designed by me for the achievement of liberation. It is the greatest of all secrets. It is the subtlest essence of the Vedas. One who performs Pasupataa vow, shall be quiescent; he must have perfect self-control; he should dust his body with sacred ashes; he should observe celibacy and remain naked. Or he should wear a loin-cloth or a single garment; he should be silent and engaged in the study of Vedas. The scholar shall meditate on Siva as Pasupati. Sruti states that this Pasupata Yoga should be resorted by the seekers of liberation; that those who maintain Pasupata rite should be free from desire&#8230;There are other scriptures opposed to the Vedic view. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">They have been propounded by me alone and they are very fascinating in this world. Those cults are Vama, Pasupata, the Soma cult, the Lakura (Lakula) and the Bhairava and such other cults which are opposed to Veda should not be resorted to</span>.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Just like Vaishvanite distortion of the Shaivite Skanda Purana II.ii.12.14-18, a Linga Purana verse may have also been twisted by Vaishnavite where Indra says,</p>
<p>Linga Purana Section I.40.38-39 &#8220;People overwhelmed by misery will never see the maximum span of life of hundred years. In Kali all the Vedas will not be available. Yajnas perish afflicted by people of no virtue. Ochre-robed and naked anchorites will be wandering and many Kapalikas (ascetics holding skulls as their begging bowls) will infest the territories.&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Vayu Purana a Vaishnavite Purana condemns Kapalikas and other religions also,</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.58.64-66 &#8220;Yajnas are forsaken when Dharma receives a setback. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">There will be many types of heretics like wearers of ochre-coloured robes (Buddhists), Jainas and Kapalikas (skull bearing mendicants)</span>. There will be sellers of the Vedas and the sacred places. Heretics antagonistic to the discipline and arrangement of different castes and stages of life will be born. When Kali Yuga sets in, the Vedas will not be studied. Sudras will be experts and authorities in the affairs of Dharma.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Shaivite Puranas says Shiva was a Kapalika, and he recommended the Kapalika Vrata, Kapalikas are praised in Shaivite Puranas but Vaishnavite Puranas says that Shiva created Kapalika and other Shaivite sects to delude the sinners. It&#8217;s clear proof that Vaishnavite text wants to demonize Shaivite sects. Shaivite sects are even called heretic sects in Vaishnavite Puranas. Read verses in <a href="#intolerance-buddhists">Intolerance towards Buddhism</a> and <a href="#intolerance-jainism" class="broken_link">Jainism</a> category in which Kapalika sect are condemned by Vaishnavite Puranas. The worship of Shivlingam is condemned in Vedas. Shiva was the local deity of India who was later assimilated in the Vedic religion by Aryans.

<p>There is a conflict between Hindu sects, one sect accuses the other of not following Vedas properly,</p>
<p>Swami Prabhupada the founder of ISKCON and also a follower of Gaudiya Vaishnavism writes on Arya Samaj,</p>
<p>&#8220;Those who are Āryans strictly follow the Vedic principles, but in this age of Kali a community has sprung up known as the ārya-samāja, which is ignorant of the import of the Vedas in the paramparā system. Their leaders decry all bona fide ācāryas, and they pose themselves as the real followers of the Vedic principles. These ācāryas who do not follow the Vedic principles are presently known as the ārya-samājas…&#8221; <strong>Swami Prabhupada on Srimad Bhagavatam 5.15.1</strong> <a href="http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_5.15.1" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_5.15.1<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>Swami Prabhupada on Ramakrishna mission,</p>
<p>&#8220;So you take any means, the Ramakrishna Mission also says like that. Yata mata tata patha. &#8220;You can worship brahma-varcasa, you can worship Devī-māyā; you can worship Vasūn; you can worship Rudra; you can worship anyone; ultimately, you become one with the Supreme.&#8221; Most misguiding. Here it is&#8230; But if you want this particular thing, then you worship this. In the Bhagavad-gītā also, it is confirmed, yānti deva-vratā devān pitṟn yānti pitṛ-vratāḥ (BG 9.25).<br />
You will find, rascal gurus, they are preaching like that, that &#8220;Whatever you do, it is all right.&#8221; There is a big mission, they say also that yata mat tata patha. &#8220;Whatever you have manufactured, the way of salvation, that&#8217;s all right.&#8221;<br />

<p>Founder of Arya Samaj Swami Dayanand Saraswati writes on Puranik (orthodox) Hindus who worship idols. Puranik Hindus constitute the majority of the Hindu population,</p>
<p>&#8220;Fie on you! O you senseless, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">idiotic author of the Bhagvat Puranana. What a shameless creature you were!</span> You did not feel a bit of shame or hesitation in writing such falsehood! You became so utterly blind.&#8221; <strong>by Swami Dayanand Saraswati, Satyarth Prakash, Ch 11, page 407, Tr. Chiranjiva Bhardwaja</strong> <a href="http://satyarthprakash.in/english/chapter-eleven/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">http://satyarthprakash.in/english/chapter-eleven/<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>He also wrote,</p>
<p>&#8220;A Shaiva is really one who worships Shiva &#8211; the All merciful Being; a Vaishnava is one who worships Vishnu &#8211; the All-pervading God. A Ganpata is one who worships Ganpati &#8211; The Lord of Hosts i.e., (of the Universe); Bhagvata is one who sits at the feet of the muses. A Saurka is one who is the devotee of the All-pervading God, the Soul of the Universe &#8211; animate and inanimate. Thus Rudra, shiva, Vishnu, Ganapati, Surya, connote God, and Bhagvati connotes truthful speech. These various Puranic texts were invented owing to the wrong interpretation of the Vedic texts (quoted above)… likewise the Shivites, Shaktas, Vaishnavites and the like revile one another, because they are ignorant of the true meanings of the words Shiva, Rudra, Vishnu, etc., which, as is set forth in the first chapter of this book, are the different names of the Immutable God Who is Self-existent, All-wise and Blissful. These men of little understanding do not use their brains and never give the least thought to the matter, otherwise they will soon find out that all such terms as Shiva, Rudra, and Vishnu connote One Supreme, Incomparable&lt; Omniscient God, the Controller of the universe, on account of His possessing multitudinous attributes. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Would not the wrath of God descend on such people</span>?&#8221; By Swami Dayanand Saraswati, Satyarth Prakash, Ch 11, page 366-7, Tr. Chiranjiva Bhardwaja</p>
<p>Clashes between Hindu sects still exist. A clash broke out between Arya Samajis and followers of Sant Rampal because Arya Samajis who abuse other religions were offended by the &#8216;Derogatory&#8217; remarks made on Dayanand Saraswati by Sant Rampal. Another clash had erupted between these two groups over the handling of Ashram.</p>

<h2><a id="intolerance-towards-religions"></a>Intolerance towards other religions</h2>
<p>Now this one is really an interesting topic that would expose those Hindus who claim that Hinduism tolerates other religions. Hindus claim that Buddhism and Jainism are sects of Hinduism. And that both share the same values and teachings. It&#8217;s quite funny to hear from Hindus that Hinduism tolerates other religions when it doesn&#8217;t even tolerate its own Shudra. Shudras are not even considered Aryas, they are called Anaryas (Non-Aryans), non-Hindus in Hindu scripture, and works of scholars are called with slang terms like Maleccha (Barbarian/foreigner), Yavana who are considered to be viler than Chandalas, etc. Can such religion really preach tolerance?</p>

We will be considered winners even if 20 lakh of their population is killed.” Anand Swaroop, head of a body named the Shankaracharya Parishad sought to threaten hotels in Haridwar against holding Christmas celebrations on 25 December, he also vowed not to allow Eid celebrations, “It’s a norm since 1915 that non-Hindu religious functions cannot be held in Haridwar, acknowledged as a pilgrimage city of Hindus. We have written to nearly 300 hotels that they should not entertain Christmas celebrations at their places on 25 December. If they do, they will have to face the consequences.” Seer Sindhu Sagar called on “rich Hindu villagers” to “buy all Muslim properties and keep the village free of the minority population”. “Harass them to the extent that they are forced to sell off their houses. I have arrested more than 10 Muslims on false charges under the SC/ST Act.” Swami Prabodhanand said, “Just like Myanmar, the police, the army and every Hindu must pick up arms and organise a cleansing [of Muslims…We have no other choice.” Another speaker, Sadhvi Annapurna or Pooja Shakun Pandey <a href="https://twitter.com/zoo_bear/status/1473581283242491904" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">repeated<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> the call for genocide: “If you want to finish off their population then we are ready to kill them.

<p>I have mentioned only those Hindu scholars who made it to the news, there are many more Hindu scholars who comment against Islam and Muslims on social media, and they pass Islamophobic remarks in their religious events. So much is the hatred for Muslims by Hindu scholars because this is what Hinduism teaches them. This is not something new, Hindus have been giving hate speeches and persecuting non-Hindus for centuries, this hatred was directed towards Buddhism and Jainism in ancient India when Buddhism and Jainism flourished in India and the responsibility of giving hate speeches against them was taken up by Hindu scholars like Adi Shankaracharya, Kumarila Bhatta, Basava, etc., and now they are targeting Muslims because Islam is the second-largest religion in India so Hindus want to wipe out the Muslim community in India.</p>

<h2><a id="intolerance-buddhists"></a>Intolerance towards Buddhists</h2>
<p>In the 2nd century BC, <a href="https://scroll.in/article/774518/a-brief-history-of-religious-intolerance-in-india" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Patanjali<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> tells us that the relationship between Brahmins and Buddhists is like that between the snake and the mongoose. <a href="https://vedkabhed.wordpress.com/2014/05/14/mulshankar-on-jainism-and-buddhism/" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Swami Dayanand Saraswati<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> criticized Buddhism in his book Satyarth Prakash, Adi Shankaracharya criticized Buddhist scriptures and used abhorrent words for Buddha,</p>
<p>Brahma Sutra 2.2.32 &#8220;To be brief, from every point of view that this Buddhist doctrine may be examined for finding out some justification, it breaks down like a well sunk in sand; and we do not find any least logic here. Hence also all behaviour based on the Buddhist scripture is unjustifiable. Moreover, Buddha exposed his own incoherence in talk when he instructed the three mutually contradictory theories of the existence of eternal objects, existence of consciousness, and absolute nihilism; or he showed his malevolence towards all creatures, acting under the delusion that these creatures would get confused by imbibing contradictory views. The idea is that the Buddhist view should be abjured in every way by all those who desire the highest good.&#8221; Tr. Swami Gambhirananda</p>
<p>Jaimini wrote about Buddhist scriptures,</p>
<p>Purva Mimansa Sutra of Jaimini, Pada 3, verse 14, Adhikarana VII (b) &#8220;With regard to the non-Vedic scriptures of the Bauddha, &amp;c., the Purvapaksa is that, &#8216;inasmuch as these are as much scriptures of actions as the Veda, their authoritative character cannot be denied. The eternal and authoritative character of these scriptures can be proved by the same arguments that have been put forward in support of the eternality of the Veda.&#8217;<br />
The Siddhanta is that, inasmuch as these other scriptures are acknowledged to have been the work of human authors, they cannot be accepted to be possessed of infallible authority. They they are not eternal is proved by their having been compiled by human authors; and also by the absence in those so called &#8216;scriptures&#8217; of all regularity; that is to say, they are found to be full of incorrect words and phrases&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Pandit Ganganath Jha</p>
<p>Kumarila Bhatta wrote about Buddhist scriptures,</p>
<p>Tantra Vartika, Adhyaya 1, Pada III, Adhi (7d) &#8220;&#8230;Thus, then, we conclude that on account of their being composed of incorrect words and expressions, the scriptures of the Bauddha, &amp;c., can never be held to be either a Veda, or an eternal scripture&#8230;Nor can these scriptures be held to be eternal, because there is a clean remembrance of their authors (Buddha, and others) And hence in matters relating to Dharma, which is amenable only to an eternal scriptures (as proved under Sutra I-1-2), we cannot admit of the independent authority of the Bauddha scriptures.&#8221; Tr. Pandit Ganganath Jha</p>
<p>Hindus claim that Buddhism is part of Hinduism. That Buddha was an avatar of Vishnu. An Indologist said that Buddha was considered an avatar of Vishnu only to convert the Buddhists to Hinduism. A Dalit scholar writes,</p>
<p>&#8220;Declaring the Buddha as ninth avatara of Vishnu, by the Brahmanic Puranas, was meant to cause confusion in the minds of people with the result that Buddhism came to be treated as a &#8220;heretical&#8221; and &#8220;aesthetic&#8221; branch of Brahmanism&#8221; <a href="http://www.ambedkar.org/books/dob15.htm" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">http://www.ambedkar.org/books/dob15.htm<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>As per Hindu texts and scholars. Buddha rejected Vedas and established anti-Vedic philosophy to stop the animal sacrifice. Some Hindu scholars say that people during Buddha&#8217;s time were engaged in animal sacrifice because they lived on the wrong interpretation of Vedas and that the Vedas do not sanction animal killing. My question is if people during Buddha&#8217;s time misinterpreted the Vedas then why the avatar of Vishnu establish anti-Vedic, atheistic philosophy? Why didn&#8217;t he just revive the Vedas? Why wasn&#8217;t he born as the revivalist of Hinduism?</p>
<p>Hindus would very happily tell you that Buddha was an avatar of Vishnu but they will never tell you the truth about this avatar. According to Hindu scriptures, Vishnu didn&#8217;t incarnate as Buddha to guide people to the right path or to teach them Vedas, Vishnu incarnated as Buddha to delude people by establishing a false religion called Buddhism. Hindu scripture says that to delude the sinners and demons and to defeat the demons Vishnu incarnated as Buddha and made all the demons accept Buddhism who would continue to spread this religion. Hindu text explicitly says that Buddhism is a false religion,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 2.7.37 &#8220;Asuras, the enemies of the celestials, became proficient in the knowledge of the Vedas, and having got made by Mayadanaba (an Asura of that name) and invisible city of velocity, engaged themselves in the destruction of the people. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Thereupon the glorious God incarnated Himself as Buddha, and with a view to bring about a confusion of their understanding and to create avarice in them taught them many false religions</span> in the guise of a Pashanda (one setting the true religious texts at naught).&#8221; Tr. J.M. Sanyal</p>
<p>Padma Purana VI.252.108-115 &#8220;&#8230;The glorious one, taking up the form of Buddha, deluded his enemies. Those who were deluded by that teaching gave up all religious practices&#8230;.&#8221; Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p>Garuda Purana 3.15.26 &#8220;Then in Kali age, the Lord was born in the Kikata [modern Bihar] as Buddha. He deluded the asuras and flouted the Vedas.&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Agni Purana 16.1-5 &#8220;Agni said:- I will now describe the Buddha incarnation&#8230;Formerly in the war between gods and demons the former were defeated by the latter. Saying &#8216;Save us, Save us!&#8217; they sought refuge with Iswara. Being incarnation of illusion and infatuation he was born as the son of Suddhodana. He infatuated the Daityas and made them relinquish the religion of the Veda. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">They then became followers of Buddha and induced others to forsake Vedic religion</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">He became Arhata and afterwards made others Arhatas</span>. Divorced from Vedic religion they became all Pashandinas [Irreligious people]. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">They committed (sinful) deeds capable of taking one to hell and received (gifts) from degraded persons</span>&#8230;&#8221; Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>It&#8217;s mentioned in Bhagavad Purana,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 1.3.24 &#8220;Then, in the beginning of Kali-yuga, the Lord will appear as Lord Buddha, the son of Añjanā, in the province of Gayā, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">just for the purpose of deluding those who are envious of the faithful theist</span>.&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 4.19.24-25 &#8220;In this way while carrying away the hose with the intention of interrupting Prthu&#8217;s sacrificce, Indra assumed and abandoned deceitful disguise of <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">nude ascetics (Digamabara Jainas), red-robed ascetics (Buddhists)</span> and others (such as Kapalakas). Minds of men, through their misapprehension (of the true teachings of the Vedas), <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">are </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">generally attracted to these pseudo-religious sects as the true religion</span>, as they are charmingly presented with excellent eloquence.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 4.19.23-25 &#8220;All the forms that Indra assumed for the purpose of stealing the sacrificial horse in disguised form are therefore considered to be vile and generally adopted by persons known as Pashandas. The guises so assumed and cast off by Indra for the purpose of stealing the horse with a view to thwarting the performance of Prithu&#8217;s sacrifice have been the cause of unreligious creeds as professed by Jainas, Buddhas, and Kapalikas. Although such forms faith differ widely from the true religion or truth, they attracted the attention of the people. Such creeds in view of their intelligent arguments prove apparently charming to weak minds.&#8221; Tr. J.N. Sanyal</p>
<p>Ironically, verse 14 of this chapter states that Indra assumed the form of a Hindu saint, but that form is not listed here among Pashandas (Heretics), these verses also dub Jainism, Buddhism, and Kapalika sect as false religions. The Sanskrit word mentioned here for Buddhists is rakta pata which means red-robed, As Buddhist monks don red robes, it&#8217;s an expression used in Hindu scriptures to refer to Buddhists, Sanskrit word for Jain is Nagna which means naked referring to Digambara Jains. Upadharmesu is translated as towards false religions. The above verses are trying to say that Buddhism and Jainism are false religions and people are attracted to these sects as true religions. Gautama Rishi curses the Brahmins who oppressed him in the following way,</p>
<p>Srimad Devi Bhagavatam 12.9.63-81 &#8220;O vile Brâhma<span style="text-decoration: underline;">n</span>as! You will be always averse to see the festivals of S&#8217;iva, to worship S&#8217;iva, to Rudrâk<span style="text-decoration: underline;">s</span>a, to the Bel leaves, and to the holy Bha<span style="text-decoration: underline;">s</span>ma (ashes). You will be wholly indifferent to practise the right ways of living as presented in the Vedas and Smritis, to preserve your conduct good and to observe the path of knowledge to Advaita Jñânam, to practise restraint of senses and continence, to the daily practices of Sandhyâ Bandanam, to performing the Agnihotra ceremonies, to the study of the Vedas according to one&#8217;s own S&#8217;âkhâ or to the daily studies thereof as to teach those things or to give, as gifts, cows, etc., or to perform the S&#8217;râddhas of the fathers, etc., or to perform Krichchra Chândrâya<span style="text-decoration: underline;">n</span>a and other penances. O Vile Brâhma<span style="text-decoration: underline;">n</span>as! As you are ready to do these mean things, you will have to suffer for this that you will desist from worshipping the Most Adorable S&#8217;rî Bhagavatî Devî and that you will worship the other Devas with faith and devotion and hold on your bodies S&#8217;amkha, Chakra and other signs. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">You will follow the Kâpâlikas, Bauddha S&#8217;âstras and other heretics</span>. You will sell your father, mother, brothers, sisters, sons and daughters and even your wives too! You will sell the Vedas, Tîrthas, and your Dharma. You will not feel ashamed in any way to sell all these. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">You will certainly have faith in Kâpâlika and Bauddha opinions, Pâñcharâtras and Kâma S&#8217;âstras</span>…&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Why Gautam Rishi is cursing Brahmins is not the topic of this discussion but the way he is cursing them is very important, he curses them to follow Bauddha (Buddhist) scriptures, and he curses them to sell father, mother, sister, brother, daughters, and even wives. So following Buddhist, Jain and Kapalika scriptures are considered so worst in the sight of Gautama Rishi that he compares it to selling mother and daughter. The following verses show that they would enter hell because they embraced the heretic philosophy like Buddhism, Jainism and Kapalika,</p>
<p>Srimad Devi Bhagavatam 12.9.91-100 &#8220;…Some of them began to mark on their bodies various heretical signs, e.g., Taptamûdrâ, etc.; some became Kâpâlikas; some became Kaulas; <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">some Bauddhas and some Jainas</span>. Many of them, though learned, became lewd and addicted to other&#8217;s wives and engaged themselves in vain and bad disputations. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">For these, they will have to go again surely to the Kumbhîpâka hell</span>…&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Hindu scriptures even consider Buddhist worship places to be equivalent to cremation ground, place inhabited by wicked men, etc.,</p>
<p>Kurma Purana II.11.48-49 &#8220;The following places are also to be avoided for Yogic Practice: places where vermins abound, cremation ground, dilapidated cowpen, the quadrangle or place where four roads meet, a crowded noisy place or <span style="text-decoration: underline;">where there is an ant-hill or a Caitya (Buddhist place of worship)</span>, an unauspicious place full of wicked men, and places where mosquitoes are in plenty. Nor should one practice Yoga when the body is ailing or when the mind is dispirited.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana says that the Asuras (Demons) created Buddhism and Jainism,</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana 2.3.14.38b &#8220;Formerly, in the battle between the Devas and the Asuras, the Asuras were defeated. They created the heretics like Vrddhasravakis, Nirgranthas, (nude Jainas), Sakyas (Buddhists), Jivaskas and Karpatas.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Another verse calls them heretics who will flourish in the Kali Yuga,</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana 1.2.31.65 &#8220;After the advent of the Kali age, many types of heretics crop up. They may be Buddhists wearing ochre-coloured robes, Jainas, Kapalikas and others who sell the Vedas. Still others are those who sell holy centres of pilgrimage.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Rama in Valmiki Ramayana says that Buddhists are thieves and should be punished like a theif,</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">यथा</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;">हि</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;">चोरः</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;">स</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;">तथा</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;">हि</span> <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">बुद्ध</span></strong> |<br />
स्तथागतं नास्तिकमत्र विध्हि |<br />
तस्माद्धि यः शङ्क्यतमःप्रजानाम् |<br />
न नास्ति केनाभिमुखो बुधः स्यात्</p>
<p>Ramayana of Valmiki, Ayodhya Kanda II.109 &#8220;I blame this act of my father&#8217;s, viz.,-that he took (for his priest) one of perverse understanding, who rangeth by help of such an intellect-who is frightfully atheistic, and who hat swerved from the path of righteousness. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">As a thief is, so is a Buddha</span>, and know that in this matter, an atheist is in a like predicament. Therefore, such an one, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">when capable of being punished like a thief for the good of the people, should be punished like a thief</span>; and let no <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Brahmana ever speak with an atheist</span>.&#8221; Tr. Manmath Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Yatha hi chor = As a theif<br />
Sa tatha hi Buddhah = so is Buddha/Buddhist</p>
<p>Ralph T.H. Griffith has also translated it as Buddhist. The reason why I translated the Sanskrit version word by word is that Hindu scholars are deliberately distorting the translation. Hari Prasad Shastri translates it as Charvaka school, and another one translates it as atheistic way even when there is a clear mention of the word Buddha which is translated into English as Buddha or Buddhist. Buddha in Sanskrit means intellectual so here it is surely not condemning &#8216;Intellectual&#8217; and also it makes no sense at all. Jabali was persuading Rama to follow atheistic philosophy and Buddhism is also considered atheistic philosophy so by keeping all these in mind the word Buddhah here refers to Buddha/Buddhist, it’s true that Ramayana may not have been composed when Buddhism was founded, this seems to be a later interpolation added by Rishis. Other Hindu scriptures say that one should avoid seeing Buddhists and the very sight of a Buddhist monk even in a dream is a bad sign,</p>
<p>Narada Purana I.15.49-53 &#8220;There is no expiation anywhere to those persons who intimately associate themselves with Sudra women, whose bodies are nourished with the food of the Sudras and <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">who indulge themselves in denouncing the Vedas</span>. There is no expiation here or hereafter to those who find fault with stories of saintly people. Even through hundreds of expiations, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">it is impossible to see the redemption of that Brahmana who enters a Buddhistic shrine</span>, even in a great emergency. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The Buddhistic are heretics, as they are the revilers of the Vedas. Hence, a Brahmana shall not even look at them</span>, since they are excluded from righteous holy rites. A Brahmana may enter a Buddhist shrine knowingly or unknowingly. If he enters knowingly, there is no redemption at all. This is the decision of the scriptures.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>The Yajnavalkya Smriti says that the very sight of a monk with red robes and shaven head (referring to Buddhists), even in a dream, is a bad sign. [Yajnavalkya SmritiI/272-273]
<h2>Touching a Jain or Buddhist</h2>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">A s</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">imilar thing is mentioned in Basava Purana</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> which narrates a story of a Basava devotee,</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> that a devotee of Basava in his dream touched a Buddhist so to expiate the sins of touching a Buddhist he burned himself in Srisailam,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Basava Purana Chapter VI, The Story of Vira Sankara &#8220;Listen to the story fo Vira Sankara, a devotee of Kama Killer. Even in his dreams he never thought of, touched, or spoke about other gods.

<h3><a id="shraddha"></a>Buddhists and Jains seeing Shraddha invalidates it</h3>
<p>Forget about participation of Buddhists and Jains in a Hindu ritual, the Hindu ritual becomes void if it is merely sighted by a Buddhist or a Jain, they must not be present at Hindu rituals as per Hindu texts.</p>
<p>Kurma Purana II.21.32-33 &#8220;That Sraddha wherein the wicked Tamasikas such as old Sravakas (Buddhists), Jainas, knowers of Pancaratra, followers of Kapalika and Pasupata sects, atheists, and others like them eat food offered to gods, does not bestow excellent benefit here and hereafter.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Ganesh Vasudeo Tagare explains the word Nagnas &#8220;The explanation in VV.35 ff below shows that the term Nagna includes Jainas, Buddhists, Jivakas (i.e. Ajivakas, the followers of Mankhali Gosala) and such other sects who do not follow Brahminism. It includes also apostate Brahmanas, atheists and the committers of gross sins (Mahapatakas)&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Usana Samita 4.23-30 &#8220;The following are disqualified to be present at a Sraddha ceremony…The <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Sramanas (Bouddha ascetics)</span>; Nirgoodas, (a class of naked mendicants); <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">those, who, know the doctrines of the</span> Pancharatra; <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Jinas</span>; the Kapalikas, the Pasupatas; if these and similar other heretics, wicked souls pervaded by the quality of Tammas, partake of the Havi, the Sraddha does not become successful, and it does not yield fruits in the next world.&#8221; Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana 2.3.14.34 &#8220;The Nagnas (naked) and other persons must not see the well-arranged Sraddha rite. The Sraddha viewed by these do not reach the Pitrs or the Pitamahas (grandfathers).&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare.</p>
<p>Vayu Purana Part 2, 16.24 &#8221;The naked and similar (apostates and non-Vedic sects) people should not see the Sraddha rite. This is the rule. Such Sraddhas as are seen by these, do not reach Pitrs or Pitamahas.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Ganesh Vasudeo Tagare writes: &#8221;As explain below (vv.26ff), those who do not have the protective covering of the Vedas. The text not only includes non-Vedic sects like Jains and Buddhists but includes apostate Brahmins, atheists, committer of gross sins (maha-patakas).</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana 2.3.15.59-62 &#8220;&#8230;One should avoid persons with tonsured head, persons, with matter hair and persons with ochre robes in the Sraddha rite.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare<br />
Kurma Purana II.22.34-35 &#8220;The following shall be shunned and kept at a great distance from Sraddhas viz. one who is deficient in any limb, a fallen one, a leper, one with running sores, an atheist, a cock, a pig, and a dog. One shall avoid a loathsome fellow, an unclean fellow, the naked one, the intoxicated one, the rogue, a women in her monthly course, the blue-garmented, the ochre-garmented and the heretic.&#8221; Tr.

<h3><a id="shiva-incarnates"></a>Shiva incarnates to stop Buddhism</h3>
<p>You may have heard the proverb &#8220;Diamond cuts diamond (Loha Lohe ko kat ta hai)&#8217;. Hindu scripture says the same about stopping Buddhism. According to Hindu scriptures and scholars, Shiva incarnated on earth and established a false philosophy (Advaita Vedanta) just to stop another false philosophy called Buddhism. Hindu scholars consider Adi Shankaracharya to be an incarnation of Shiva as Adi Shankaracharya had successfully stopped Buddhism and even persecuted Buddhists and Jains and established objectionable philosophy (Advaita Vedanta) for which he was sometimes considered crypto-Buddhist by some Hindu scholars. It&#8217;s mentioned in Padma Purana wherein Shiva says,</p>
<p>Padma Purana 6.236.5-7 &#8220;&#8230;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Visnu of the form of Buddha proclaimed the false Buddhist doctrine</span> and those of the naked and wearing dark blue garments for the destruction of the demons. The doctrine of Maya (illusion) is a wicked doctrine and said to be pseudo-Buddhist. I myself, of the form of a Brahmana, proclaimed it in Kali (age).&#8221; Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p>A verse in Kurma Purana may also be talking about this,</p>
<p>Kurma Purana I.30.31-32a &#8220;Persons practising vows not sanctioned by the Vedas, of wicked behaviour and of futile efforts, will be deluding all other people by exhibiting the fruits thereof. Their minds are enveloped and vitiated with ignorance and these base people follow feline tricks. [33b-36] Sankara, Nilalohita, will take up incarnations for the establishing the Srauta (Vedic) and Smarata (belonging to the Smrtis) rites, with a desire for the welfare of his devotees. He will teach his disciples the knowledge pertaining to the Brahman. Those who resort to the essence of Vedantas (Upanishads) and follow the holy rites indicated in the Vedas and such of those holy rites as are pointed out with special reference to the people of all castes, serve him in whatever manner they can. They overcome defects or sins of Kali Age and attain the greatest region.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Swami Prabhupada wrote,</p>
<p>&#8220;In this regard, it is stated in the Padma Purana that Lord Siva appeared as a brahmana in the age of Kali to preach the Mayavada philosophy, which is nothing but a type of Buddhist philosophy. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">It is stated in Padma Purana: Lord Siva, speaking to Parvati-devi, foretold that he would spread the Mayavada philosophy in the guise of a sannyasi brahmana just to eradicate Buddhist philosophy</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">This sannyasi was Sripada Sankaracarya. In order to overcome the effects of Buddhist philosophy and spread Vedanta philosophy, Sripada Sankaracarya had to make some compromise with the Buddhist philosophy, and as such he preached the philosophy of monism, for it was required at that time</span>. Otherwise there was no need for his preaching Mayavada philosophy. At the present moment there is no need for Mayavada philosophy or Buddhist philosophy, and Lord Caitanya rejected both of them. This Krishna consciousness movement is spreading the philosophy of Lord Caitanya and rejecting the philosophy of both classes of Mayavadi. Strictly speaking, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">both Buddhist philosophy and Sankara&#8217;s philosophy are but different types of Mayavada dealing on the platform of material existence</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Neither of these philosophies has spiritual significance</span>. There is spiritual significance only after one accepts the philosophy of Bhagavad-gita, which culminates in surrendering unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Generally people worship Lord Siva for some material benefit, and although they cannot see him personally, they derive great material profit by worshiping him.&#8221; <strong>Swami Prabhupada on Srimad Bhagavatam 4.24.17</strong><br />
<a href="http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_4.24.17" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_4.24.17<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>He also wrote,</p>
<p>&#8220;Lord Chaitanya admitted that Sankaracharya was an incarnation of Lord Shiva, and Lord Shiva is one of the greatest devotees, a Mahajan of the Bhagwat school. There are twelve great authorities on devotional service, and Lord Shiva is one of them. Then, why did he adopt the process of Mayavadi philosophy? The answer is given in the Padma Purana, where there is a statement by Lord Shiva as follows: &#8220;The Mayavadi philosophy is veiled Buddhist philosophy.&#8221; In other words, the void philosophy of Buddha is more or less repeated in the Mayavadi philosophy of impersonalism, althouth the Mayavadi philosophy claims to be directed by the Vedic conclusions. Lord Shiva thus admits that this philosophy was manufactured by him in the Age of Kali as a Brahmin boy to mislead the atheist class of men: &#8220;Actually, the Supreme Personality of Godhead has His transcendental Body, but I describe the Supreme as impersonal. Similarly, I have explained the Vedanta Sutra also on the same principles of Mayavadi philosophy.&#8221; <strong>Teachings of Lord Chaitanya (1968) </strong><a href="http://vanisource.org/wiki/TLC_19_%281968%29" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">http://vanisource.org/wiki/TLC_19_%281968%29<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>Madhavacharya wrote that Devas went to Shiva and complained about the prevalence of Buddhists and Kapalikas and requests him to re-establish the Vedic religion, Shiva accepts their requests and tells them that he will incarnate as Adi Shankaracharya, his son will incarnate as Kumarila Bhatta and Indra will incarnate as King Sudhanva. Kumarila Bhatta with the help of King Sudhanva had persecuted Jains and Buddhists,</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;The Devas once resorted to Siva, the Lord of the Silver Mountain, for seeking a favour, just as they appraoch the Icy Moon&#8230;They addressed Him thus with folded palms: &#8216;In days of yore, it was to favour us that <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Lord Vishnu incarnated Himself as the Buddha and diverted unrighteous men from contaminating the Vedic path, by preaching a new religion for them. But today, the country is filled with the heterodox followers of that religion</span>, as night is by darkness. They are indulging in carping criticism of the Veda, declaring it to be just a fraudulent means of livelihood for a few, and condemning its teachings on the duties of Varnas and Ashramas as mere superstitions. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">As people have given up the orthodox Vedic path and become heretics</span>, there is none to do the daily devotional acts like Sandhya, or to take to the life of rununciation&#8230;The followers of the cults of Siva and Vishnu bear on themselves the emblems of the Linga and the Chakra, but they too have given up Vedic rituaals, just as evil men abandon mercy&#8230;Therefore, for the protection of the world and for the happiness of the good and holy ones, Thou shouldst deign to eradicate the world of these vicious and perverse men and their practices, and re-establish the Vedic religion on firm ground.&#8217; When the Devas had completed their submission, the great God Siva said: &#8216;Taking a human body, I shall secure what is good for you. I shall establish the Dharma, conquering all the leaders of the perverse paths. I shall produce a commentary on the Brahma Sutras, setting forth the true teachings of the Vedas. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">I shall do this, taking the form of a great Sannyasin, Sankara by name</span>, accompanied by four disciples who would be like the luminous sun dispelling the darkness of ignorance conjured up the acceptance of duality&#8230;God Siva cast his lvoing glance, so rare for any one to get, on his son Shanmukha (also called Skanda and Subrahmanya)&#8230;Siva, the great God having matted locks, spoke thus to His son: &#8216;Dear one! Hear my words that are meant for the blessing of the world&#8230;And I have now promised to the Devas, as you know very well, that I shall undertake to rejuvenate the gnostic teachings which form the ultimate purport of the Veda. Now, you have to do your part of the work, and that iss the revival of the ritualistic section of Brahma (the Veda) condified by Jaimini, and thereby gain the reputed name of Subrahmanya (promoted of Brhamanya), <span style="text-decoration: underline;">besides the commonly known name of Kumarila Bhatta</span>, the preacher of the Vedic Karma-Kanda. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">In order to refute and confute the Buddhists who are attacking the the Vedic teachings and to establish the Vedic way of life</span>, you have to be born in the world. For your help, Brahma will be born as the scholar Mandana, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">while Indra will become the king Sudhanva</span> for the very same purpose.&#8221; <strong>Shankara Digvijaya 1.27-56, by Madhavacharya, Tr.

<h3><a id="kalki-buddhists"></a>Kalki avatar a murderer of Buddhists</h3>
<p>As per Kalki Purana, the final avatar of Vishnu takes birth on the earth, plunders nearby tribes to support his father&#8217;s horse sacrifice, kills many people and exterminates almost every tribe and also persecutes Buddhists. What is the crime of Buddhists that they deserve to die at the hands of Kalki avatar? Because they are Buddhists, they are heretics, because they don’t follow Vedic religion. I am using Kalki Purana which is translated and edited by ISKCON scholars Bhumipati Das and Purnaprajna Das and the translation is published as &#8216;Sri Kalki Purana&#8217;.</p>
<p>Sri Kalki Purana 13.39-44 &#8220;Lord Kalki appeared to flourish, being surrounded by all these family members. Once, Lord Kalki&#8217;s father, Visnuyasa, who was on the level of Lord Brahma, decided to perform a horse sacrifice. Understanding the intention of His father, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Lord Kalki said: My dear father, I will go out and defeat all other kings in battle and thus bring you sufficient wealth so that you can conduct the horse sacrifice properly</span>. Lord Kalki, who was certainly capable of conquering all other kings, offered His obeisances to his father and <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">then set out with his army to first conquer Kikatapura. Most of the inhabitants of this city were Buddhists, who never offered oblations to their forefathers, nor worshiped the demigods</span>&#8230;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">They did not deignate themselves or their families in terms of caste, and thus there was no conception of high or low birth</span>. As far as earning wealth, marriage, or eating were concerned, they had no sense of discrimination. The people of that city were interested only in eating, drinking, and making merry. When the ruler of that city, who was named Jina, head that Lord Kalki had come to fight, He quickly gathered an army consisting of one aksauhini.&#8221; Tr. Bhumipati Das edited by Purnaprajna Das</p>
<p>Sri Kalki Purana 16.1 &#8220;Suta Gosvami said. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">After killing the Buddhists and mlecchas of Kikatapura, Lord Kalki took their wealth</span> and returned to His capital, along with His vast army&#8221; Tr. Bhumipati Das edited by Purnaprajna Das</p>
<p>This proves that his sole purpose for killing Buddhists of Kitaka was to plunder them. Kalki born to Vishnuyasa is also mentioned in Agni Purana chapter 16.</p>
<p>Sri Kalki Purana 3.10 &#8220;Thereafter, You will set out to conquer the entire world and in the course of that conquest, You will defeat many sinful kings who are representatives of Kali. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">You will also annihilate many followers of Buddhism</span> and finally, You will entrust the responsibility of ruling the world to Devapi and Maru.&#8221; Tr. Bhumipati Das, edited by Purnaprajna Das</p>
<p>Sri Kalki Purana 10.30 &#8220;Recently, You appeared as Lord Kalki in order to eliminate the dynasty of Kali by destroying the Buddhists, atheists, and mlecchas, thereby protecting the true path of religion. What more can we say about your causeless mercy?&#8221; Tr. Bhumipati Das edited by Purnaprajna Das</p>
<p>Sri Kalki Purana 20.25 &#8220;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">You will be happy to learn that I have already defeated the Buddhists residing at Kikata-desa</span>. My mission is to destroy all the miscreants who are envious of you and other Vaisnavas. You can now wander fearlessly over the earth because I am just about to set out on a tour to conquer all the kings of the world.&#8221; Tr. Bhumipati Das, edited by Purnaprajna Das</p>
<p>Sri Kalki Purana 14.11 &#8220;Although Lord Kalki&#8217;s wonderful horse had been injured by Jina&#8217;s trident, he soon regained his composure and began roaming over the battlefield, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">jumping fiercely while angrily attacking hundreds and thousands of Buddhist soldiers</span>. In this way, Lord Kalki&#8217;s horse killed many sinful men. [13] <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Within a short period of time, Gargya and his associates killed six thousand Buddhist warriors</span>. Bhargya killed ten million enemy soldiers with the help of his army, and Visala killed twenty five thousand.&#8221; Tr. Bhumipati Das edited by Purnaprajna Das</p>
<p>The translator Bhumipati Das explains why verses in Kalki Purana are in the past tense when it predicts the advent of the Kalki avatar,</p>
<p>&#8220;Among the upa-puranas or sub Puranas, the Kalki Purana is most sacred and widely respected. At the end of Kali-yuga, the Supreme Lord, Hari, will incarnate as Lord Kalki and kill all the mlecchas, yavanas, atheists, and Buddhists of the world that defy the Vedic authority. The pastimes of Lord Kalki are subject matter of this literature, which is presented in story form. Exalted personalities can see everything, past, present, and future. For this reason, there is no fault in narrating these future events as if they had already occurred. The Kalki Purana consists of thirty-five chapters.&#8221; <strong>by Bhumipati Das in Introduction of book Sri Kalki Purana, Published by Jai Nitai Press</strong></p>

<h2><a id="intolerance-jainism"></a>Intolerance towards Jainism</h2>
<p>Just like Buddhism, the Jain religion is also declared a false and a heretic religion in Hindu scriptures. Swami Dayanand Saraswati wrote,</p>

<p>Both Jainism and Hinduism recognises Rishabhdeva or Rishabhnatha as Tirthankara (first teacher). But Hinduism doesn&#8217;t believe Tirthankara to be a Jain or as the founder of Jainism. Hindu scriptures say that Rishabhdeva was a Hindu god and avatar.</p>
<p>Linga Purana I.24.43-47 says that Shiva will incarnate as Rsabha</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 1.3.13 Says that Rishabhdeva was the eighth incarnation of Vishnu</p>
<p><strong>Swami Prabhupada wrote:</strong> &#8220;…Jains refer to Lord Ṛṣabhadeva as their original preceptor. If such people are serious followers of Ṛṣabhadeva, they must also take His instructions…&#8221; <strong>On Srimad Bhagvatam 5.6.12 </strong>http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_5.6.12</p>
<p>He means to say that Jains don&#8217;t follow what Rishabhdeva preached. There are different versions regarding the founder of Jainism in Hindu scriptures. Some Hindu scripture says that a King named Arhat was the founder, some say Jina was the founder, some say Brihaspati in Shukracharya&#8217;s guise founded Jainism, and some say Vishnu created an illusory form namely Arhat to delude people. Jains are referred to in Hindu scriptures as Arhat, Jina, Jaina and also Jain. A story from Padma Purana alone is enough to give the image of how Jainism is viewed in Hinduism. Let me present the verses first,</p>
<p>Padma Purana II.37.4-11 [Suta said] I shall tell (you) <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">all the sinful conduct of Vena</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">When he a noble king knowing righteousness was ruling</span>, a man, having put on a guise, naked, of a huge body, with his head clean-shaved, of a great lustre, holding under his armpit a broom of peacock&#8217;s feathers, and a drinking-pot made of cocoa-nut in his hand reciting (texts containing) wrong doctrines, vilifying the Vedic religion, came (there). He quickly came to (the place) where Vena was (seated). <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The sinner entered the court of that Vena</span>. Seeing him having arrived (there) Vena asked him a question: &#8216;Who are you, taking up such a form&#8230;What is your faith? Tell me (all this). What is your Veda (i.e. which Veda do you follow)? What are your practices&#8230;What are the real characteristics of your faith? Tell me all that and the truth before me.&#8221; Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p>Padma Purana II.37.12a-21 &#8220;Hearing those words of Vena <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">the sinful man</span> said these words. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The sinful man said</span>: In vain you are ruling. You are a great fool, there is no doubt about it. I am all-in-all of Dharma (i.e. religious practices). I am most adored by gods. I am knowledge&#8230;I am Dharma (i.e. religious practices)&#8230;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Know me to be the chief Jaina saint</span>, having body of true religion. The meditating sages, intent on (obtaining) knowledge, run to me only. Vena said: What kind of acts (do you do)? What is your doctrine? What are your practices? Tell (all this to me). <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The sinful man said: (That is my faith) where Arhats are the gods</span>, and Nirgrantha is looked upon as the preceptor&#8230;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The best worship is that of a Jaina mendicant, and the best meditation is that of an Arhat. This way of life is seen in the Jaina faith</span>. I have told you all this i.e. the characteristics of my faith&#8230;.&#8221; Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p>King Vena was surprised looking at this Jain saint so he asked him about his faith and practices. The Jain saint also criticizes the animal slaughter sanctioned by the Vedas. I have not added those verses here as it would&#8217;ve made the passage very long, I tried to make it as short as possible, we shall read it in Meat consumption in Hinduism article. So the Jain saint explains his beliefs and also criticizes the Vedic religion. Now read how the Jain religion is viewed by Hindu sages who addressed king Vena in the following way,</p>
<p>Padma Purana II.38.25-30 &#8220;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">When Kali (yuga) sets in, all men, deluded by sins, will act after having resorted to the Jaina faith</span>. Men will abandon Vedic practices, and will commit sins. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">There is no doubt that the Jaina faith is the root of sin</span>. O best king, the fall of those men, who are heaps of sins, brought about by this great delusion. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Govinda (i.e. Visnu), destroyer of all sins, will be (appearing) for their destruction and for nothing else</span>. Taking the form of his liking he will restrain (them) from sins. When sins will have thus accumulated, he, the god will be (appearing) as Kalki for the destruction of the Mlecchas; there is no doubt about it. Give up the behavior of (i.e. proper for) Kali (yuga) and resort to merit. Heave truthfully; become the guardian of your subjects.&#8221; Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p>On being advised by the Jain saint, King Vena embraces Jainism,</p>
<p>Padma Purana II.38.1-5a &#8220;Suta said: Vena, thus advised by <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">that very sinful Jina, and deluded by him, attained to a sinful attitude</span>. Abandoning the Vedic faith and rites of a truthful conduct, he saluted the feet of <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">that very wicked one</span>. There was cessation of good sacrifices, and also of that Vedas. Religious practices full of holy scriptures (i.e. as told in the holy scriptures) did not proceed at that time. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">As a result of (bad) rule</span>, the world became full of all sins. When that king ruled, there were no sacrifices, no (recitation of) the Vedas, no excellent purport of the holy texts, no charity and no study, O brahmanas.&#8221; Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p>So according to Hindu texts, King Vena was a righteous and noble king but as soon as he embraced Jainism he started ruling badly. This shows that whoever is against Hinduism (or is a non-Hindu) is demonized in Hindu scriptures. The verse also says that deluded by sins people will resort to Jainism. And have you noticed how the Jain saint is addressed here? He is addressed in these verses as &#8216;the wicked one&#8217; and &#8216;the sinful man&#8217;. It means whoever is not an Arya cannot be righteous, all non-Hindus are wicked and sinful. We find mention of King Vena in other scriptures also but they don&#8217;t mention that he had embraced Jainism. He has also been demonized in those scriptures as a bad ruler probably because he left the Vedic religion and embraced Jainism.</p>
<p>Also, read Srimad Bhagavatam 4.14.30-35 in the <a href="#blasphemy" class="broken_link"><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #0000ff;">Blasphemy </span></a>category where Brahmins killed King Vena for blaspheming Vishnu. Bhagavad Purana insults Jainism in the following way,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 5.6.9 &#8220;Śukadeva Gosvāmī continued speaking to Mahārāja Parīkṣit: My dear King, the King of Koṅka, Veṅka and Kuṭaka whose name was Arhat, heard of the activities of Ṛṣabhadeva and, imitating Ṛṣabhadeva&#8217;s principles, introduced a new system of religion. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Taking advantage of Kali-yuga, the age of sinful activity, King Arhat, being bewildered, gave up the Vedic principles</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">, which are free from risk, and </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">concocted a new system of religion opposed to the Vedas</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">. </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">That was the beginning of the Jain dharma</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">. Many other so-called religions followed this atheistic system</span>.&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Swami Prabhupada wrote &#8220;The followers of King Arhat went under the name Jains&#8221; <a href="http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_5.6.10" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_5.6.10<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>He also wrote,</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;the King of Koṅka and Veṅka acted like a paramahaṁsa and imitated Lord Ṛṣabhadeva. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">He introduced a system of religion and took advantage of the fallen condition of the people </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">in this age of Kali</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">It is said in Vedic literatures that people in this age will be more inclined to accept anyone as the Supreme Lord and accept any religious system opposed to Vedic principles</span>. The people in this age are described as mandāḥ sumanda-matayaḥ. Generally they have no spiritual culture, and therefore they are very fallen. Due to this, they will accept any religious system. Due to their misfortune. they forget the Vedic principles. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Following non-Vedic principles in this age, they think themselves the Supreme Lord and thus spread the cult of atheism all over the world</span>.&#8221; <strong>Swami Prabhupada on Srimad Bhagavatam 5.6.9</strong> <a href="http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_5.6.9" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_5.6.9<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>So the founder of Jainism was bewildered and taking advantage of Kali Yuga he established the false religion called Jainism. It also says that Jainism is opposed to the Vedas. Kurma Purana lists Jaina texts in ignorant scriptures,</p>
<p>Kurma Purana I.12.261 &#8220;<span style="color: #ff0000;">Those various scriptures which are contrary to Srutis and Smrtis seen in this world, are based on Tamo-guna or ignorance</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Belief in them or practising in accordance with them is a Tamasa activity</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">They i.e. those contrary to Vedas are the cults of Kapala, Bhairava, (v.1. Pancaratras), Yamala, Vama, and Arhata </span>and others similar to these also. In another incarnation of mine, these scriptures having been promulgated by me to delude the people who themselves try to <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">mislead other persons by propagating their false scriptures</span>.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Ganesh Vasudeo Tagare wrote,</p>
<p>Pasupatism: KP. records two forms of Pasupatism, one approved by Vedic tradition and the other condemned so much that sect is not only classed with non-Vedic heretic sects like Vama (&#8216;left hand&#8217; type of Tantrism) and <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Arhata (Jainas) created for the delusion of non-believers (KP.I.12.261-62)</span> but <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the believers are prohibited from even speaking with those heretics (KP.II.16.15)</span>&#8230;&#8221; Ganesha Vasudeo Tagare, Introduction (V) Religious Sects in the KP, p.xxxiv</p>
<p>A verse in Vishnu Purana says that the demons embraced Buddhism and Jainism which are false doctrines and it is prohibited to converse with them, eat in their house, meet them, etc., the entire chapter is important. If possible you can read the entire chapter available at sacred-texts.com. The passages are long though I have presented certain points only,</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 3.18.1-3 &#8220;PARÁŚARA.&#8211;After this, the great delusion, having proceeded to earth, beheld the Daityas engaged in ascetic penances upon the banks of the Narmadá river ; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">and approaching them in the semblance of a naked mendicant, with his head shaven, and carrying a bunch of peacock&#8217;s feathers</span>&#8230;[7-14] By such persuasions, and by many specious arguments, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">did this delusive being mislead the Daityas from the tenets of the Vedas</span>&#8230;might be the duty of those who go naked, or who go clothed in much raiment: and so the Daityas were seduced from their proper duties by the repeated lessons of their illusory preceptor, maintaining the equal truth of contradictory tenets; <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">and they were called Arhatas</span>, from the phrase he had employed of <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">&#8220;Ye are worthy (Arhatha) of this great doctrine;&#8221; that is, of the false doctrines which he persuaded them to embrace</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The foes of the gods being thus induced to apostatize from the religion of the Vedas</span>, by the delusive person sent by Vishńu, became in their turn teachers of the same heresies, and perverted others; and these, again, communicating their principles to others, by whom they were still further disseminated, the Vedas were in a short time deserted by most of the Daitya race&#8230;[18-26] In this manner, exclaiming to them, &#8220;Know!&#8221; (Budhyadwam), and they replying, &#8220;It is known&#8221; (Budhyate), <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">these Daityas were induced by the arch deceiver to deviate from their religious duties (and become Bauddhas)</span>&#8230;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The delusions of the false teacher paused not with the conversion of the Daityas to the Jaina and Bauddha heresies</span>, but with various erroneous tenets he prevailed upon others to apostatize, until the whole were led astray, and deserted the doctrines and observances inculcated by the three Vedas. Some then spake evil of the sacred books; some blasphemed the gods; some treated sacrifices and other devotional ceremonies with scorn; and others calumniated the Brahmans&#8230;&#8221;The precepts,&#8221; they cried, &#8220;that lead to the injury of animal life (as in sacrifices) are highly reprehensible&#8230;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">If an animal slaughtered in religious worship is thereby raised to heaven, would it not be expedient for a man who institutes a sacrifice to kill his own father for a victim?</span>&#8230;[42-45] <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Let not a man associate, in residence, sitting, or society, with him whose person or whose house has been blasted by the sighs of the gods, progenitors, and spirits. Conversation, interchange of civilities, or association with a man who for a twelvemonth has not discharged his religious duties, is productive of equality of guilt; and the person who eats in the house of such a man, or sits down with him, or sleeps on the same couch with him, becomes like him instantaneously</span>&#8230; [102-4] These, Maitreya, are the persons called naked, the meaning of which term you desired to have explained. Their very looks vitiate the performance of an ancestral oblation; speaking to then destroys religious merit for a whole day. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">These are the unrighteous heretics to whom a man must not give shelter, and speaking to whom effaces whatever merit he may that day have obtained</span>.&#8221; Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>This chapter of Vishnu Purana is explained briefly in Punishment for Apostasy under the sub-category <a href="#examples" class="broken_link"><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #0000ff;">Examples</span></a>. Skanda Purana also says that demons embraced Buddhism,</p>
<p>Skanda Purana VII.I.119.46-50 &#8220;&#8230;the Daitya warriors became furious. They rushed thereat roaring like rumbling clouds. When they were killed, they shouted &#8216;Ha! Ha!&#8217; some of the Asuras entered the sea. A few Danavas went over the mountains. Some of them had tonsured their heads and they stayed within forests as rogues. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Some of them adopted the Vrata of the Nirgranthas (nude sages or Digambara Jainas) and preached sermons on the pious activities of merciful nature</span>. Some of them became afraid of (the goddess) for their lives. They resorted to the life of heretics. They were fools engaged in arguments and disputations about basic or original causes. They had no cleanliness and they did not crave for anything. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">They are indeed seen even today in the world of Ksapanakas (Buddhist monks)</span>. Others are Bhindakas excluded from the scriptures of Saiva cult.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>A story in Devi Bhagavatam says that Brihaspati deceived the demons by assuming the form of Sukracharya and preached Jain religion to them and the demons rejected the real Sukracharya who later cursed the demons for not recognizing him, thus the motive of Brihaspati was accomplished as the demons were cursed and could be easily be defeated by Indra, so Brihaspati went to Indra and informed him about this. It shows that demons were the first to embrace Jainism.</p>
<p>Srimad Devi Bhagavatam 4.13.44-58 &#8220;Vyâsa said:&#8211; Please hear what the disguised Brihaspatî in the shape of S&#8217;ukrâchârya did afterwards. The demons were made to understand clearly by Brihaspatî; and then they took him for S&#8217;ukrâchârya and placed implicit faith on him and began to think of him and him alone. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The Daityas, enchanted and deceived by the magic of Brihaspatî, took now his refuge for acquiring the knowledge from him, since they mistook him for S&#8217;ukrâchârya</span>. Who is there that is not enchanted by the idea of gaining something? On the other hand, when the term of ten years was over, S&#8217;ukrâchârya, the real Guru of the Daityas, ceased enjoying Jayantî and began to remember his disciples, the Daityas. He now began to think that &#8220;My disciples, the Daityas, are expecting every instant my return; and I would now go and see them, bewildered with fear. They are my devotees and I ought to do such that they might not be afraid of the Devas.&#8221; And then he exclaimed to Jayantî, &#8220;O beautiful one! Let my sons take the shelter of the Gods; your term of ten years is today over; I now go therefore, to see my disciples; soon I will again come to you.&#8221; &#8220;Be it so&#8221;, replied Jayantî, the best of those who know religion, &#8220;you can go where you like; I am not to destroy your Dharma.&#8221; Hearing these words, S&#8217;ukrâchârya went hurriedly to the Demons and saw the Devaguru Brihaspatî sitting before them in the guise of S&#8217;ukrâchârya. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">He was explaining to them the Jaina doctrines, compiled by himself and finding fault with the act of envy, taking revenge and killing and cursing the sacrifices, etc</span>. He was telling them &#8220;O Enemies of Gods! Truly, I am telling you words that will, no doubt, prove good to you. Non-killing is the highest virtue; even the enemies ought never to be killed. It is the Brâhmanas, addicted to enjoyments and pleasures of the senses, who want to satisfy their tastes and pleasures that are found in the Veda&#8217;s injunctions to kill animals; but there is no virtue higher than non-killing animals.&#8221; O king! S&#8217;ukrâchârya was perfectly astonished to hear Brihaspatî, the Guru of the Devas, speaking against the Vedas and began to think that Brihaspatî is certainly my enemy. My disciples have been duped by this cheat; there is no doubt in this.&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Srimad Devi Bhagavatam 4.13.59-62 &#8220;Fie to Avarice! It is the seed of sin; very strong and the veritable gate to hell; Brihaspatî, even, the Guru of the Devas, is speaking lies, bound under the influence of this heinous avarice! Oh! What wonder is this that the Guru of the Devas, who is the promulgator of all the religious S&#8217;âstras and whose word is accepted as the final decision, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">is now expounding the doctrines of atheists</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">When Brihaspatî can become the expounder of atheistic doctrines</span>, impelled by covetousness what to speak of those whose minds are not pure and whose intelligence is not sharp? <span style="text-decoration: underline;">This Deva Guru, though a Brâhmin, is acting today like a rogue, wanting to take away all and is deceiving my disciples the Daityas</span>, who have been confounded by his magic.&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Srimad Devi Bhagavatam 4.14.16-19 &#8220;Vyâsa said:&#8211; Thus saying S&#8217;ukrâchârya hurriedly went away, infuriated with anger. Brihaspatî was glad and remained there with his mind calm. Brihaspatî then knowing the Daityas cursed by S&#8217;ukrâchârya, assumed his real appearance, left that place, and hurriedly returned to Indra. He began to say &#8220;I have undoubtedly succeeded in my undertaking; the Daityas have been cursed and left by me too. They are now helpless; so, O Good Suras! I have made them cursed, you would better now try to fight with them.&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>The founder of Virashaivism, Basava (initially a Shaiva Brahmin), was the chief minister of the Kalachuri king Bijjala, a staunch Jain with his capital at Kalyana in modern day Karnataka. The Basava Purana, a long hagiography dedicated to Basava narrates that not only did he successfully plot a regicide, but also sanctified violence against Jains, in rather gruesome ways such as putting “a sharp spear on the skulls of Jains&#8221;. Such an ideology fell in line with Virashaivism’s idea of opposing the caste system and ostentatious rituals, tenets that made the new religion popular with the masses in no time. Being the religion dominating Karnataka in the early medieval era, Jainism took the greatest hit and saw a sharp fall in its following.</p>
<p>Apart from vying for political patronage, the Lingayats (followers of Virashaivism) also started appropriating and converting Jaina basadis (shrines) into Virashaiva temples, an act that not only signified Virashaiva strength, but was also a practical necessity for a nascent religion with not enough resources to build a new temple from scratch.</p>
<p>Basava&#8217;s anniversary is celebrated across India mainly in Karnataka on the pretext that he was a social reformer let&#8217;s have a look at what Basava Purana the sacred text of Lingayat says about Jainism. Basava is regarded as the incarnation of Nandi, The Basava Purana II.32 says that Narada reported to Siva that, while other religions were flourishing, the Saiva faith was with few exceptions dying out among the Brahmins and so decaying among other castes also; Siva then asked Nandin to become incarnate as the Virasaiva saint Basavanna to preach Virasaivism in keeping with orthodox dharma.</p>
<p>Jains in Basava Purana are called two-legged beasts, animals, dogs, etc, so much is the love for Jains from one of the biggest reformers of Hinduism. The following verses show how Jains were persecuted and Vasadis (Jain Shrines) were destroyed by devotees of Basava while Basava didn&#8217;t stop it and instead Basava praised his devotee for carrying out the persection,</p>
<p>Basava Purana, chapter VI &#8220;O Jain, is it appropriate for me to cut off my head and get it right back? No, I will cut it off now and walk the streets of this town for seven days and then get it back. Can you even watch me do that? <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Not only that, I will tear down all the Jain vasadis in Kalyana so that there will not even be one left for a sample. Furthermore, I will smash all the idols of Jina</span>. This is my vow. Is there any reason why I should not subject you <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">two-legged beasts</span></strong> to this?&#8221; he said. The Jains agreed to his proposal. They all gathered together and sat on one side and watched. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">On the other side sat Basava with the devotees in attendance</span></strong>. Bijjala and his ministers were also there, along with all the people of the city young and old alike&#8230;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Basava praised him</span>; the devotees cheered him on..For seven days, Ekanta Ramayya strode though the city. Then he went and stood in front of the temple gate and cried out, &#8216;Come on now, you Jains, you have seen my vow!&#8221;&#8230;  The Jains gave him an acknowledgement of his victory, written by the king. And they all come and bowed down before the assembly of devotion. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">On each person&#8217;s face the devotees impressed the marks of Siva</span>. With cries and roars, the heroic assembly of mahesvara rose up. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">They quickly destroyed all the Jain vasadis and broke the heads of all the Jina idols. When they were finished, there was not a trace of a Jain vasadi or a Jina idol in all of Kalyana. In a fury, the devotees harassed and killed every known Jain and smashed them all into the ground</span>. The devotees of Black Throat responded by praising the peerless courage of Ekanta Ramayya. Meanwhile, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Basava worshipped Ekanta Ramayya</span> as if he were Sangamesa&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Velcheru Narayana Rao</p>
<p>Basava Purana Chapter VI &#8220;Therefore, it is not within your capacity to know our Lingadeva&#8217;s power. Ramanatha is everything, but yet the nondevotees are not capable of gaining him. Don&#8217;t say that this has never been proven! If you simply ask me to, I will give you visible evidence. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">It is well known there are seven hundred Jain vasadis in Potlaceruvu, and I am going to have them all destroyed. You are mere animals</span>. What more can I say to you?&#8221; Tr. Velcheru Narayana Rao</p>
<p>Some Jains tried to kill Tirunavakarisa in unsuccessful attempts and they were scared that he would kill them so they converted to Shaivism but this didn&#8217;t stop Tirunavakarisa, he destroyed many Jain shrines and broke the idols of Jains.</p>
<p>Basava Purana Chapter VI &#8220;&#8230;When the Jains were unable to kill him by any means whatsoever, they began to be afraid that he would kill them. So those who had been tormenting him asked him for refuge, and he protected them. He wiped out their old marks and gave them rudraksa, ashes, and the rest of the five marks. In a rage, he destroyed all the Jain images and wrecked all the Jain vasadis. &#8216;For doing so, Tirunavakarisa became known as the destroyer of the Jains&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Velcheru Narayana Rao</p>
<p>Nowadays many Hindus try to bring Jains and Buddhists within the Hindu fold so as to increase the numbers in population and also claims that Hinduism believes all religion to be true but a story from Basava Purana says how Pilla Narayana converted 2000 Buddhists and drove away the Buddhist saint,</p>
<p>Basava Purana Chapter VI &#8220;There was a Buddhist guru who was attended by two thousand disciples. Pilla Nayanaru drove the guru away and converted the two thousand Buddhists into devotees of Siva.&#8221; Tr. Velcheru Narayana Rao</p>

<h3><a id="Shudras-Buddhism"></a>Shudras will embrace Buddhism and Jainism</h3>
<p>Hindu scriptures predicted that some Shudras will embrace Buddhism and Jainism,</p>
<p>Kurma Purana I.30.13 &#8220;When the close of Yuga is imminent, Sudras calling themselves Jinas (subduers of sense organs) will perform holy rites by shaving off their heads, wearing ochre robes and black antelope skins and keeping their teeth white.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Vayu Purana Part I.58.59 &#8220;When the close of Yuga is imminent, Sudras exhibiting their white teeth, with clean shaven heads and wearing ohcrecoloured robes will perform sacred rites, proclaiming that they have conquered the sense organs.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare, edited by G.P. Bhatt</p>
<p>G.V. Tagare writes &#8220;Probably a reference to Buddhist monks, as Buddhism prevailed all over India at the time of these Puranas.&#8221;</p>
<p>G.V. Tagare explains the word Jina in the footnote as &#8220;This refers to Buddhist Bhiksus. The term &#8216;Jina&#8217; means &#8216;the subduer of sense organs&#8217; and is applied to the Buddha, Jainas (especially Digambaras) are mentioned in V.16 below.&#8221;</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 5.6.11 &#8220;Believing in the blind tradition the new way of life chosen by them but which is unsupporter by the Vedas, they of their own accord will fall into dark abymsalhell.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Harivamsa Purana 3.3.17 &#8220;Shudras with white teeth, anjan in eyes, shaven head and wearing ochre clothes will earn their livelihood, following the dharma of shakyabuddha.&#8221; Tr. A. Purushothaman and A. Harindranath</p>
<p>Narada Purana I.41.54-55 &#8220;The Sudras will not serve the twice-born. Assuming the airs of heretics, the base-born assume and practice holy rites of the Brahmanas. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The Sudras will clothe themselves in ochre-robes</span>; they will have matted hair; they will smear ashes all over their bodies. Thus equipped and employing deceptive arguments, they will begin to expatiate on Dharma.

<p>Vishnu Purana narrates the story of a Hindu king named Satadhanu who on account of his conversation with heretics was reborn as a dog, it explicitly considers conversing with non-Hindus as a grave sin leading to severe punishments,</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 3.18.48-50 &#8220;Men fall into hell who converse with one who takes his food without offering a portion to the gods, the sages, the manes, spirits, and guests. Let therefore a prudent person carefully avoid the conversation, or the contact, and the like, of those heretics who are rendered impure by their desertion of the three Vedas…[56-63] On one occasion, when they had fasted on the full moon of Kártika, and had bathed in the Bhagirathí, they beheld, as they came up from the water, a heretic approach them, who was the friend of the Rájá&#8217;s military preceptor. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The Rájá, out of respect to the latter, entered into conversation with the heretic</span>; but not so did the princess; reflecting that she was observing a fast, she turned from him, and cast her eyes up to the sun. On their arrival at home, the husband and wife, as usual, performed the worship of Vishńu, agreeably to the ritual. After a time the Rájá, triumphant over his enemies, died; and the princess ascended the funeral pile of her husband. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">In consequence of the fault committed by Śatadhanu, by speaking to an infidel when he was engaged in a solemn fast, he was born again as a dog</span>…[74-81] &#8220;Dost thou not remember, oh king, the circumstance of conversing with a heretic, which I called to thy recollection when thou wast a dog…she exclaimed, &#8220;recollect yourself: away with this uncouth form, to which the sin of conversing with a heretic has condemned you…<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Such, Maitreya, is the sin of conversing with a heretic, and such are the expiatory effects of bathing after the solemn sacrifice of a horse</span>, as I have narrated them to you. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Let therefore a man carefully avoid the discourse or contact of an unbeliever</span>, especially at seasons of devotion, and when engaged in the performance of religious rites preparatory to a sacrifice…[103-4] <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Men, indeed, fall into hell as the consequence of only conversing with those who unprofitably assume the twisted hair, and shaven crown; with those who feed without offering food to gods, spirits, and guests; and those who are excluded from the presentation of cakes, and libations of water, to the manes</span>.&#8221; Tr.

<h2><a id="persecution"></a>Persecution of Buddhists and Jains</h2>
<p>Hindu scriptures spewing venom against Buddhists and Jains and calling their faith as false religions resulted in persecution of Buddhists and Jains by Hindus. There was no large-scale persecution at once but there was a systematic ethnic cleansing of Buddhists and Jains in India that annihilated them. Even Hindu scholars agree that Buddhism and Jainism were prevalent religions in India, but their population has been reduced to a miniscule population due to the persecution, Swami Vivekandanda wrote,</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">And such was his heart that he burnt to death lots of Buddhist monks &#8212; by defeating them in argument!

<p>&#8220;The exact word used in Sanskrit is <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">nāstika, which refers to one who does not believe in the Vedas</span> but manufactures some concocted system of religion. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu has said that the followers of the Buddhist system of religion are nāstikas</span>. In order to establish his doctrine of nonviolence, Lord Buddha flatly refused to believe in the Vedas, and thus, later on, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Śaṅkarācārya stopped this system of religion in India and forced it to go outside India</span>.&#8221; <strong>Swami Prabhupada on Srimad Bhagavatam 4.2.30</strong><br />

<p>Swami Apurvanand, an author from Vivekananda&#8217;s tradition, describes, on the authority of an ancient text &#8220;Shankara Vijay&#8221; by Anandagiri, how Dharmapala, a Bouddha Aacharya of Nalanda Boudha Vidyapitha was defeated in &#8216;shastrartha&#8217; i.e. interpreting old existing texts, without trying to elucidate new principles, by Kumarila Bhatta. Kumarila, an uncle of Buddhist scholar Dharmakirti, being defeated and humiliated by Dharmakirti, decided to study Buddhist shastras as he thought &#8216;it is always necessary to study the enemy before attacking it&#8217; and joined Nalanda in the guise of a disciple of Dharmapala, in order to acquire enough knowledge of Buddhism so as to defeat Buddha&#8217;s doctrine. After studying Buddhism for some time, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">he challenged his guru Dharmapala, defeated him in &#8216;shastrartha&#8217;, and saw his guru embrace &#8216;tushanal&#8217; i.e. a funeral pyre made up of hay and dry wood. Dharmapala declared before being burnt alive</span>, &#8220;I am defeated by brilliance of Kumarila, but still I believe in supremacy of Buddha&#8217;s doctrine, I am not deviated at all from Buddha, His Dhamma or His Sangha, and <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">so I would renounce my life rather than renounce Buddhism</span>&#8220;. This is an account from a Brahmanic book and not from a Buddhist one. Shastrartha, Swamiji tells us, involved scholarship i.e.. an ability to quote from ancient texts, literary acumen, ability to debate and argue without cause, without logic, demonstration of so called yogic powers etc. [Swami Apurvananda, &#8220;Aacharya Shankara&#8221; 2nd edition. 1989, (Marathi translation of Bengali book), Ramakrishna Matha, Dhantoli, Nagpur, p. 94 ff.] <a href="http://www.ambedkar.org/research/Holi__A_Festival_To_Commomorate_Bahujan_Burning.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">http://www.ambedkar.org/research/Holi__A_Festival_To_Commomorate_Bahujan_Burning.htm<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>Swami Dayanand Saraswati the founder of Arya Samaj wrote,</p>
<p>&#8220;About 2,200 years ago Shankaracharya, a Braahmana of Dravid (Southern India), studied Grammar and all other Shaastras- books on Logic, Philosophy, Metaphysics, Theology, etc. &#8211; during student life, and seeing the religious degradation of his country began to soliloquies thus:- &#8220;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">What a pity! The true theistic Vedic religion has disappeared, whilst the atheistic Jain religion has prevailed to the great detriment of the people. This (i.e., the Jain religion) must be put down somehow</span>.&#8221; Shankarcharya had not only read the Shaastras but also the Jain scriptures. He was also a powerful debater&#8230;He began to think as to what was the best method of overthrowing Jainism. At last he came to the conclusion that preaching and holding discussions with the Jainis were the best methods to put down Jainism. With this object in view he went to Ujjain (in Central India). King Sudhanwa then ruled there&#8230;He went to the king and said &#8220;You have read the Jain books as well as Sanskrit, and also believe in the Jain Religion. I, therefore ask you to arrange a discussion between the exponents of the Jain religion and myself on the condition that the vanquished party should embrace the religion of the victor and that you should also accept his faith&#8230;For ten years he toured all over the country, refuted Jainism and advocated the Vedic religion. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">All the broken images that are now-a-days dug out of the earth were broken in the time of Shankar</span>, whilst those that are found whole here and there under the ground had been buried by the Jainis for fear of their being broken (by those who had renounced Jainism)&#8230;At that time this country was very rich, and its people were also patriotic. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Shankar, King Sudhanwa and other kings had not had the Jain temples pulled down as they intended to establish schools therein to teach the Vedas and other Shaastras</span>.&#8221; <strong>Satyarth Prakash, by Swami Dayanand Sasarwati, Ch 11, page 345-7, Tr. Chiranjiva Bhardwaja </strong><a href="http://www.aryasamajjamnagar.org/chaptereleven.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">http://www.aryasamajjamnagar.org/chaptereleven.htm<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>As per Dayanand, Shankaracharya and Sudhanva did not demolish Jain temples because they had intended to use them for the teaching of the Vedas. This means if they had infrastructure they would&#8217;ve demolished it. This is clear proof of how non-Hindu worship places were appropriated by Hindus. Swami Dayanand writes that Jainism had once prevailed in India,</p>
<p>&#8220;The Jainees differ from them. Mahavira and Gautama Gandharas (lords of hosts) are called Buddhas by the Buddhists, while they have been named Ganthara and Kinavara by the Jainees. Raja Shiva Prashad whose forefathers have been Jaiinees for generations together writes in their Chapter of his book called Itihas Timirnashak that Jina lived altogether about 1,000 years before Swami Shankarcharya. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The Buddhist or the Jain religion prevailed in the whole of Bharatavarsha (India)</span>. He then adds the following footnote. &#8220;By the term Bauddha (Buddhist religion) we mean that anti-Vedic religion which prevailed in all India from the time of Gandhar Mahavir, or Gautama Swami to that of Swami Shankar&#8221;<strong> Satyarth Prakash, by Swami Dayanand, Ch 12, p.524, Tr.

<p>Madhavacharya also wrote that Buddhism and Jainism dominated India,</p>
<p>&#8220;The land became full of Buddhists, and the adherents of the Vedas dwindled. So I planned to overcome these Buddhists and re-establish the dominance of the Vedic religion. Their leaders, along with the disciples, have been going about converting all kings to their faith and instigating them to reject the Vedas&#8230;[Kumarila said] I recognise you as an incarnation of Guha born for the eradication of Buddhists.&#8221; <strong>Sankara Dig Vijaya 7.77-106, by Madhavacharya, Tr. Swami Tapasyanand</strong></p>
<p>He also wrote about ending Buddhism and Jainism,</p>
<p>&#8220;Thus did the king, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">whom Skanda (Kumarila) converted, free the country from the menace of Buddhists and Jains</span>, just as the obstacles in the path of Yoga are eradicated by a wise sage. And simultaneously, just as the light of the rising sun obliterates the darkness of night, the preachings of the Vedic truth by that Brahmana sage reversed the pace of the ignorance produced by the heretical teachings. When the elephants of Jaina and Buddhist heretics disappeared because of the roaming lion of Kumarila, the tree of Vedic wisdom began to spread everywhere with luxuriant foliage. As the fire-born Kumarila was thus resuscitating the Vedic path of Karma, Lord Siva condescended to be born in order to save the world floundering in the ocean of transmigratory existence.&#8221; <strong>Sankara Dig Vijaya 1.95-98, by Madhavacharya, Tr. Swami Tapasyanand</strong></p>
<p>There is a story mentioned in Skanda Purana about a king who embraced Jainism. And was later forced to reconvert to Hinduism by the Brahmins. The text depicts Jainism negatively. Kumarapala (1143-1172 A.D) was a Shaivite king and he was converted to Jainism by the Jain saint named Acharya Hemachandra. King Kumarapala stopped appeasing the Brahmins, he forbade animal slaughter which was part of Vedic Yajna (sacrifices), and he took away their authority and possessions so they went away from the kingdom and resided elsewhere. Kumarapala stripping the Brahmins off their authority is what irked the Brahmins and was the main cause of all these things. Then another king who was the father-in-law of Kumarapala summoned them and inquired about everything and told them to go to Kumarpala and to ask him to return their possession. Kumarapala refused and criticized the Vedic sacrifices that includes slaughtering animals and all. This angered the Brahmins, so after praying to Hanuman they received a talisman that was hair (purportedly of Hanuman) and threw it in the palace which burnt everything, the Jain mendicants fled for their lives.</p>
<p>Skanda Purana III.ii.36.46-62 &#8220;&#8230;They came to the brave king Ama stationed in Kanyakubja, who was surrounded by heretics. After arriving at the city of Kanyakubja, O king, they stayed for a few days on the banks of Ganga. Those Modha Brahmanas became tired. The king was informed by spies and they were brought to his presence&#8230;Even as the Brahmanas were standing, he asked all of them,&#8217;O Brahmanas, tell (it now) why you have come. What is the matter?&#8217; The Brahmanas said: O king, we have come here from Dharmaranya to you. (It is) your son-in-law Kumarapala (Kumbhipala in v43) by whom the edict of authority of the Brahmanas, which was wonderful, has been destroyed. He has done so, because he follows the Jaina cult and has been instigated by Indrasuri&#8230;On hearing the words of the Brahmanas, the king, spoke to them: &#8216;You all may go quickly and at my behest say to King Kumarapala: Return the settlement of the Brahmanas to them.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Skanda Purana III.ii.36.34-38 &#8220;On hearing this straight from his preceptor, the powerful ruler of Kanyakubja named Ama continued to rule the kingdom. He became an emperor and was keen in protecting the subjects. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Due to the advent of Kali, the subjects became inclined to commit sins. Inciting by Ksapanas (Buddhist mendicants) and following their instructions</span>, the subjects gave up their Vaisnava cult and adopted the Buddhist way of life. [46] All the different castes were converted to Jaina cult. Brahmanas were not honoured. No religious rites like Santika and Paustika were performed. No one ever used to perform charity. Time passed like this.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>People committing sins embraced Buddhism and Jainism. So people embracing other religions like Buddhism and Jainism is seen negatively here, it says that people were inclined to commit sins and the very next line talks about those people converting to Buddhism and Jainism.</p>
<p>King Kumarapala replied to them,</p>
<p>Skanda Purana III.ii.36.62 &#8220;[Kumarapala said] O Brahmanas, I shall not abide and honour the Royal Charter issued by Rama. I disown the Brahmanas who indulge in violence and kill animals in Yajna. There is no question of my having any respect for and devotion to these killers.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Kumarapala had embraced the Jain religion. And then this happened,</p>
<p>Skanda Purana III.ii.38.14-24 &#8220;[The king said] May all of you go where Rama and Hanuman are staying. Rama will give everything. What for did you come here, O Brahmanas? I will never give. I will never give even a Varatika (a cowrie); no village and no means of livelihood. Go wherever it pleases you. On hearing the terrible words, the Brahmanas were excited with anger. They said, &#8216;Well, suffer the anger of Rama and Hanuman now.&#8217; After saying this, they threw down the packet of hair from the left armpit given by Hanuman in the abode of the kind. The excellent Brahmanas then retired. When the group of the Brahmanas departed, the whole place was ablaze with columns of flames. Everything became full of flames of fire. All the royal paraphernalia got enveloped in fire: the umbrellas, the chowries, the treasury rooms, the arsenals etc. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The queens, the princes, the elephants and many horses, the vehicles and conveyances of all sorts all were completely burning</span>&#8230;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Seeing everything burnt down, the naked Jaina mendicants, trembling again and again, took in their hands their pots, auspicious sticks, red blankets and without shoes or sandals fled away to ten directions</span>.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>For the fear of being killed by the Brahmins&#8217; talisman the King Kumarpala as well as his subjects who had resorted to Jainism reverted to Vaishnavite Hinduism and the authority of Brahmins was reinstated by the king,</p>
<p>Skanda Purana III.ii.38.30-48 &#8220;The king ran on foot here and there alone and lamenting enquired, &#8216;Where are the Brahmanas?&#8217; On hearing from the people, the king went to that place where the Brahmanas (were resting). O king after going there suddenly, he caught hold immediately of the feet of the Brahmanas. The king fell down unconscious. Repeating the name of the son of Dasaratha, &#8216;Rama, Rama&#8217;, the king with deep humility spoke these words to the Brahmanas: &#8216;I am the servant of the servant of that Rama and of Brahmanas. I had become blind through the darkness of ignorance&#8230;Whatever you desire, I shall grant it. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Devotion to Brahmanas as well as to Rama should (will) always be engaged in by me</span>. I shall never do anything other than these, O Brahmanas.&#8217; On that occasion, O king, the Brahmanas became merciful. In order to quell the curse, they threw the other packet. When the hairs were thrown, the army regained life. The quarters became clear and pure&#8230;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">As before, the common people became obedient to Brahmanas. Excepting the Visnu cult, they did not know (i.e. recognize) any other religious belief</span>. A new letter of authority legally binding as before was issued. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Heretics were banished, duly making the scripture hold good. Those outside the pale of the Vedas including the good, the middling and the lowly disappeared</span>&#8230;&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Now I shall ask all those Hindus who say that Buddhism and Jainism are accepted in Hinduism if so then why did people converting to Jainism irked the Brahmins? Why do Hindu scriptures talk so negatively about Jainism? Hemchandra also died after he lost a debate as Brahmins had made it a custom to burn Buddhists and Jain scholars after defeating them in debates. There is a different version that Kumarpala embraced Shaivism, eminent historian Romila Thapar wrote,</p>
<p>&#8220;A sixteenth century text narrates that Hemachandra was defeated in a debate and sentenced to death whereupon Kumarapala reconverted to Shaivism.&#8221; <strong>Somnath: The many voices of a history, by Romila Thapar, p.116, Published by Penguin books, 2008.</strong></p>
<p>Romila Thapar cited the reference of Gadadhara, Sampradaya Pradipa, quoted in A.K. Majumdar, Chalukyas of Gujarat, p.329 ff.</p>
<p>Kumarapala&#8217;s nephew and also his successor Ajayapala is said to have demolished many Jain temples, Romila Thapar wrote,</p>
<p>&#8220;It is strange that the brahmans did not ask Hanuman for a talisman against the Turks. Kumarapala&#8217;s successor, Ajayapla, is said to have desecrated Jaina temples and looted others and supported the Shaiva religion. His son, also a zealous Shaiva, worshipped at the Somanatha.&#8221;- <strong>Somnath: The many voices of a history, by Romila Thapar, p.116, Published by Penguin books, 2008</strong></p>
<p>Another historian wrote,</p>
<p>&#8220;However, Ajaypala, nephew and successor of Kumarpala was a Saivite. He subjucated Jains. Mihirakula ended the Gupta kingdom c. 480 CE. He was considered as an opponent by the Jains because he created policies to subjucate Jainism.&#8221; Glasenapp 1999, p. 52, as mentioned in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Jainism" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Jainism<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>&#8220;According to the Prabandhachintarnani Ajayapala destroyed the Jain temples built by his uncle. He showed no favour to Ambada and Kumzirapala&#8217;s other Jain ministers&#8221; <strong>Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency: pt. 1.

<p>Hindus have started a new trend of blaming Muslims, Hindus are blaming Muslims for the caste system, They say that Sati Pratha was also due to Muslims despite the fact that their scriptures encourage Sati Pratha, They also claim that child marriage in India is also because of Muslims even when Swami Vivekananda refuted this claim, they blame foreigners for almost every evil of their religion. And they also blame Muslims for the fall of Buddhism in India. It&#8217;s true that some Muslim conquerors may have been cruel towards Buddhists like the demolition of Nalanda but this cannot be taken as Muslims annihilated Buddhists, do Hindus mean to say that the demolition of Nalanda annihilated Buddhists from India? An important question is If Muslims wiped out Buddhism from India then why did they spare Hinduism? Hindus have their answer ready, they claim that Hindus defended the religion. But who really defended it? Even Hindu rulers who are considered &#8216;brave warriors&#8217; by Hindutvadis were defeated by Muslims. Prithviraj Chauhan couldn&#8217;t fight the army of Muhammad Ghori so he had to make an alliance with neighboring Rajpur kings and lost the second battle, Maharana Pratap lost the war against Mughal in which the commander was a Rajput, Shivaji was captured by Mughals and escaped and never had the courage to fight in a war and resorted to guerilla tactics. His son Sambhaji was executed by the Mughals, Marathas lost the third Panipat war, and Rana Sanga lost to Babur. Muslims reached Deccan India within the 13<sup>th</sup> century and ruled till Britishers invaded India. So Hindu rulers should have repelled the Muslim invasion if they were so powerful, but they failed to do so which proves that Muslim rulers overpowered them. Now, these same Hindus spread false information that the Hindu population in Pakistan and Bangladesh has declined in the last 70 years. Imagine if the Hindu population can decline without the government&#8217;s support in 70 years then what could&#8217;ve been done in 800 years by Muslim rulers.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">So why didn&#8217;t Muslim rulers annihilate Hindus like they annihilated Buddhists?</span></p>
<p>The answer is, that Muslims didn&#8217;t annihilate Buddhists and Jains but Hindus did! Buddhism was on its deathbed when Muslims arrived in India. This was because of the systematic persecution of Buddhists and Jains by Hindu rulers and scholars. Genocide of Buddhists and Jains started many centuries before Muslims arrived in India. Pushyamitra Sunga (185 BC-149 BC) had persecuted thousands of Buddhist monks and demolished many Stupas and Viharas. Hindus love to quote Dr. B.R. Ambedkar on this issue. Dr. Ambedkar wrote articles on the persecution of Buddhists by Hindus but Hindus prefer to quote the last line wherein he blames Muslim invaders for <span style="text-decoration: underline;">giving a death blow to Buddhism in India</span>. Vinay Lal a Professor of History and Asian American Studies at UCLA wrote,</p>
<p>&#8220;On this view, Buddhism found competition in Islam for converts among low-caste Hindus. Even Ambedkar, whose animosity towards Hinduism is palpable, was nonetheless firmly of the view that Islam dealt Buddhism a death blow. As he was to put it, &#8220;brahmanism beaten and battered by the Muslim invaders could look to the rulers for support and sustenance and get it. Buddhism beaten and battered by the Muslim invaders had no such hope. It was uncared for orphan and it withered in the cold blast of the native rulers and was consumed in the fire lit up by the conquerors.&#8221; Ambedkar was quite certain that this was &#8220;the greatest disaster that befell the religion of Buddha in India.&#8221; We thus find Ambekdar embracing the &#8220;sword of Islam thesis&#8221;: &#8220;The sword of Islam fell heavily upon the priestly class. It perished or it fled outside India. Nobody remained alive to keep the flame of Buddhism burning.&#8221; [3] There are, of course, many problems with this view. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The &#8220;sword of Islam&#8221; thesis remains controversial, at best, and many reputable historians are inclined to dismiss it outright</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Islam was, moreover, a late entrant into India, and Buddhism was showing unmistakable signs of its decline long before Islam became established in the Gangetic plains, central India, and the northern end of present-day Andhra and Karnataka</span>.&#8221; &#8211; Buddhism&#8217;s Disappearance from India, by Vinay Lal <a href="https://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/southasia/Religions/paths/BuddhismDisappear.doc" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">https://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/southasia/Religions/paths/BuddhismDisappear.doc<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>As Vinay Lal rightly pointed out, Buddhism had already declined long before the advent of Muslims in India hence Muslim rulers cannot be blamed for the disappearance of Buddhism in India. As Hindu fanatics are very fond of quoting one line of Dr. Ambedkar out of context, Let me quote some passages on the persecution of Buddhists and Jains written by Dr. Ambedkar&#8217;s followers,</p>
<p>&#8220;Formerly a feudatory of Chalukya, Dantidurga was the founder of Rastrakuta dynasty, a strong, aggresive and militant supporter of Brahmanism. Cave XV at Ellora called Dasavtara, which has a long undated inscription of Dantidurga carved on its entrance, was originally a Buddhist Vihara, which was converted to Brrahmanic Temple, by chiseling out Buddhist images. [Yazdani G., &#8216;Early History of Deccan&#8217;, Oxford Univ. Press, 1960, p.731]
<p>&#8220;Damodarvarman, who is regarded predecessor of Attivarman, was devotee of Samyak Sambuddha. The Kapoteswara temple at Chezarla of fourth century was a originally a chaitya hall later converted into a brahmanic temple. He is described as son of king who performed Hiranyagarbha mahadana. Attivarman, worshiper of Sambhu, performed this mahadana. [D. C. Sarkar, &#8216;Classical age&#8217; p.202 ff.]
<p>&#8220;For it was in the Dark Age that religious persecution began in India. Monasteries were demolished, monks were banished, and books were burnt: and wherever the Rajputs became rulers, Buddhist edifices went down and Hindu temples arose. By the end of the 10th century, Buddhism was practically stamped out from India, and the work of destruction was completed by the Muslims who succeeded the Rajputs as masters of India.&#8221; [Epochs of Indian History, by R. C. Dutt]

<p>&#8220;&#8230; Under his (Sankara&#8217;s) very supervision, the Buddhist, their statues and monument at Nagarjunakonda were destroyed. A.H. Longhurst, who conducted excavations at Nagarjunkonda, has recorded it in his invaluable book: &#8216;Memoir of the Archaeological Survey of India&#8217; No.54, The Buddhist Antiquities of Nagarjunkonda, by A.H.Longhurst, Delhi, 1938, p.6.</p>
<p>&#8220;The ruthless manner in which all the buildings at Nagarjunakonda have been destroyed is simply appalling and cannot represent the work of treasure seekers alone as so many of the pillars, statues, and sculptures have been wantonly smashed to pieces. Had there been a town close at hand a Amaravati, one can understand the site being used as a quarry by modern builders as was so often done in India. But this never occurred at Nagarjunakonda as there are no towns and no cart roads in or out of the valley. Local tradition relates that the great Hindu philosopher and teacher Shankaracharya of medieval times came to Nagarjunakonda with a host of followers and destroyed the Buddhist monument. Be this as it may, the fact remains that the cultivated lands in the valley on which ruined buildings stand represent a religious grant made to Shankaracharya and it was only with the sanction of the present religious Head of the followers of the great teacher that I was to conduct the excavations. This same Brahmin pontiff, who resides at Pushpagiri in the Guntur District, also owns the Srisailam temple in the Nallamalais, which no doubt was acquired in the same manner as it seems to have been a Buddhist site originally.&#8221; [Bhagwan K.S.: 1986: 14]

<p>Historians discover a Jain inscription at Quilashpur<br />
Speaking on this discovery, Mr Reddy said, “Stones one foot tall and two feet wide were used for the construction of this wall. During the Kakatiya rule, Jainism was opposed and Shaivism came to prominence. As result, all the Jain temples, basadis, inscriptions etc., were destroyed. Remnants of these temples can still be seen at several places within the perimeter of this village. These remnants were used for the construction of this fort. Along with this inscription, several stones with Jain symbols are also found on the wall.”<br />

<p>&#8220;The the Brahmana king Pusyamitra, along with other tirthikas, started war and this burnt down numerous monasteries from the Madhyadesa to Jalandhara. They also killed a number of vastly learned monks. But most of them fled to other countries.

<p>Buddhist religious scriptures such as the Asokavadana allege that the first Shunga king Pusyamitra (an orthodox Brahmin) was hostile towards Buddhists and persecuted the Buddhist faith. Buddhist wrote that he &#8221;destroyed monasteries and killed monks&#8221; 84000 Buddhists stupas which had been built by Asoka were destroyed (R. Thaper), and 100 gold coins were offered for the head of each Buddhist monk. In addition Buddhist dources allege that a large number of Buddhist monasteries (Viharas) were converted to Hindu temples, in such places as Nalanda, Bodhgaya, Sarnath, or Mathura. More overt forms of Hindu hostility to Buddhism also played a role&#8230;There were episodes of Hindu persecution of Buddhists starting in the 6th century. Furthermore, the Buddha was described as an incarnation of the god Vishnu, who came to earth to delude demons (or people depending on the text) into denying the authority of the Vedas, in order to lead them to Hell. Shankara, the great Hindu philosopher and reformer, described the Buddha as an enemy of the people{17}.- Light from the East: Eastern Wisdom for the Modern West pg 192, By Harry Oldmeadow</p>
<p>&#8220;84,000 Buddhist stupas which had been built by Ashoka were &#8220;destroyed&#8221; (R. Thaper), and 100 gold coins were offered for the head of each Buddhist monk (Indian Historical Quarterly Vol. XXII, p.81 ff cited in Hars.407, also Divyavadana, p.429-434)</p>
<p>There is also archaeological evidence to prove that Buddhist worship place were destroyed by Pushyamitra Sunga, the Deorkothar Stupa was destroyed by Pushyamitra Sunga which P.K. Mishra (Archaeological Survey of India) discovered Deorkothar in 1982 with Ajit Singh and returned to excavate the site in 1999. <a href="http://archive.archaeology.org/online/news/deorkothar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">http://archive.archaeology.org/online/news/deorkothar/<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>&#8220;The Buddhist accounts are unanimous in representing Pushyamitra Sunga as a persecutor of Buddhism. His persecution started in Magadha where it is said he tried unsuccessfully to destroy the famous Kukkutarama monastery in Ptaliaputra. He went up to Sakala to execute his policy of persecution. There he offered a reward of 100 dinaras for the head of every Buddhist monk. The Buddhist account further tell us that his policy involved him in a war with a Yaksha named Krimisa and ultimately brought about his death at a place called Sthulakostha. This evidence cannot be completely discarded.&#8221; A Comprehensive History of India, Volume 2, p.364, K.

<p>&#8220;The Sungas: Following the Mauryans, Pusymitra Sunga is linked in legend with the persecution of Buddhists and a resurgence of Hinduism that forced Buddhism outwards to Kashmir, Gandhara and Bactria.

<p>A 15<sup>th</sup> century Lama named Taranatha wrote that many of the Buddhist worship places were restored by another king after the reign of Pushyamitra,</p>
<p>&#8220;It is clear that when he was residing at Sri Parvata these damages were done by the Brahman king Pusyamitra. So this appears to be the begining of the decline (of the Doctorine).<br />
After that, king Phanicandra was ruling in Magadha. During this time, in Gauda of Bhangala in the east, there was the king Gauda Vardhana with great power and wealth. He rebuilt the monasteries previously damaged and thus helped the centres to increase.&#8221; Tāranātha&#8217;s History of Buddhism in India By Tāranātha, Ch 16, p.121, Motilal Banarsidass Publ., 1990</p>
<p>Some Hindus instead of condemning what Pushyamitra did, start defending him just because he was a Hindu. The only reference they furnish is Sanchi and Barhut stupas inscriptions which say &#8216;During the supremacy of Shungas&#8217;. They attribute these to Pushyamitra and cite them as an example of his secularism, but according to historians these were built by his successors,</p>
<p>&#8220;Buddhist stupa at Sanchi, India. (Mark Weiss) destroyed by Pushyamitra and then restored by his successor, Agnimitra. Similarly, N.N. Ghosh (1945) writes that the gateway of Bharhut was built not during the reign of Pushyamitra but by his successors, who followed a more tolerant policy toward Buddhism as compared to Pushyamitra, a leader of Brahmanic reaction. The destruction and burning of the great monastery of Ghositarama at Kaushambi in the second century BC is also attributed to the Sungas. For instance, J.S. Negi (1958) notes that G.R. Sharma, who was responsible for most of the excavation work at Kaushambi, was inclined to connect this phenomenon with the persecution of Buddhism by Pushuamitra.&#8221; Popular Controversies in World History: Investigating History&#8217;s Intriguing Questions [4 volumes]: Investigating History&#8217;s Intriguing Questions, p.97, by Steven L. Danver, ABC-CLIO, 22-Dec-2010</p>
<p>&#8220;Who was responsible for the wanton destruction of the original brick stupa of Ashoka and when precisely the great work of reconstruction was carried out is not known, but it seems probable that the author of the former was Pushyamitra, the first of the Shunga kings (184-148 BC), who was notorious for his hostility to Buddhism, and that the restoration was affected by Agnimitra or his immediate successor.&#8221; in John Marshall, A Guide to Sanchi, p. 38. Calcutta: Superintendent, Government Printing (1918).</p>
<p>No matter how much Hindutvadis defend Pushyamitr Sunga, Buddhist sources and archaeological evidence proves that he indeed persecuted Buddhists and destroyed their worship places. Another persecutor of Buddhists was Shaivite king Mihirakulu,</p>
<p>&#8220;The extensive landed property put at the disposal of the Buddhist institutions by emperor Kanisha, was confiscated by the new oppressive regimes to strengthen the Brahminic hegemony. The persecution of the Buddhists and destruction of their institutions began in the sixth century by the tyrant Mihirakulu were on a mass scale.&#8221; A social history of India By S. N. Sadasivan p.238, APH Publishing, 01-Jan-2000</p>

<p>&#8220;The greatest of royal persecutors of Buddhism in India was the Huna tryant Mihirakulu (Mahiragula). His sacrilegious acts against Buddhism are recorded by Kalhana and corroborated by Hsun-tsang and the Manjusrimulakalpa. The Kashmir historian compares Mihirakula with Yama, the god of death, for the former&#8217;s atrocities. At one place Kalhana remarks: &#8216;One&#8217;s tongue would become polluted if one attempted to record his cruelties and evil deeds in detail. From this authority we learn that Mihirakula patronized brahmanas, worshipped Siva, and erected a temple of Siva, called Mihiresvara in Srinagara.&#8221; Studies in the Buddhistic Culture of India During the 7th and 8th Centuries A.D, By Lal Mani Joshi, p.320, Motilal Banarsidass Publ., 1977</p>
<p>&#8220;Though persecution, notably violent repression in south India by a devotional cult of Shiva worshipers (bhakti Hindus), who slaughtered Jains by the tens of thousands, and owing to doctrinal and social assimilation and conversion, mainly with and to Hinduism, their numbers remain small, but disproportionately socially and politically influential.&#8221; The Greenwood Encyclopedia of International Relations: F-L, By Cathal J.

<p>The author Hasmukh Dhirajlal Sankalia was an Indian Sanskrit scholar and archaeologist specialising in proto- and ancient Indian history. Mihirakula had not just demolished Buddhist Nalanda but had also uprooted Bodh Gaya tree under which Buddha used to meditate, but we rarely see Hindu radicals talking about these historical events as these don’t suit their vested interests. The destruction of Nalanda University by Hindu king Mihirakula is also mentioned in the book The Journal of the Bihar and Orissa Research Society, vol. 14, part 1, p.8-9, Published by the Bihar and Orissa Research Society, 1928, Printed by the Supreintendent, Government Printing, Bihar and Orissa. It is also worth noting that no modern books mention these atrocities by Hindu kings in the ancient period.</p>

<p><strong>Persecution of Jain at the hands of Basava Lingayat (Shaivite sub-sect) founder.</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;At the turn of the 12th century, followers of a revolutionary religious movement, Virashaivism (literally, heroic Shaivism), employed architectural reuse among other things to signal their triumph over Jainism, a rival religion.<br />
The founder of Virashaivism, Basava (initially a Shaiva Brahmin), was the chief minister of the Kalachuri king Bijjala, a staunch Jain with his capital at Kalyana in modern day Karnataka. The Basava Purana, a long hagiography dedicated to Basava narrates that not only did he successfully plot a regicide, but also sanctified violence against Jains, in rather gruesome ways such as putting “a sharp spear on the skulls of Jains&#8221;. Such an ideology fell in line with Virashaivism’s idea of opposing the caste system and ostentatious rituals, tenets that made the new religion popular with the masses in no time. Being the religion dominating Karnataka in the early medieval era, Jainism took the greatest hit and saw a sharp fall in its following.<br />
Apart from vying for political patronage, the Lingayats (followers of Virashaivism) also started appropriating and converting Jaina basadis (shrines) into Virashaiva temples, an act that not only signified Virashaiva strength, but was also a practical necessity for a nascent religion with not enough resources to build a new temple from scratch.<br />
Accordingly, as Julia Hegewald argues in her paper on temple conversions in Karnataka, the Lingayats appropriated and reused the Doddappa Temple at Adargunchi, Karnataka. Built sometime between 10th and 11th centuries, the temple today is fronted by a stone sculpture of the bull Nandi (Shiva’s vehicle) and houses a massive black stone statue of a Jina, placed alongside a Shiva linga (phallus, the form in which Lingayats worship Shiva).<br />
Save the image of the Jina, the entire temple was extensively rebuilt during the Virashaiva takeover of the basadi. Instead of destroying/mutilating the Jina statue, it was retained and painted with parallel white lines on the forehead, arms, shoulders and chest, an imitation in paint of the sacred white ash the Virashaivas often smear themselves with. The idea was to retain the statue as a “sign of domination and control” thereby sending a clear signal of Virashaiva’s triumph over Jainism.<br />
Another interesting example of such a reuse comes from the Megudi temple at Hallur, Karnataka. Here, as opposed to Aadargunchi, the temple was converted in situ, sans any extensive rebuilding.<br />
Constructed between the 7th and 9th centuries, the Megudi temple was reused as a Virashaiva shrine sometime in the 12th century. Here the Jina idol was uprooted from garbagriha, smeared with sacred Virashaiva ash, and placed in the central aisle that now leads to the sanctum sanctorum housing the Shiva linga. Such a placement of uprooted idol ensured that every devotee approaching the inner chamber would see the displaced Jina and be aware of the Virashaiva “annexation” of the temple.<br />
To further bolster the “conquered image” of the temple, two sculptures of the Jina adorning the main entrance have also been significantly disfigured even though all the other sculptures, inside and outside the temple, have been kept intact. Appropriations, as glaring as the above mentioned examples, must have inspired significant awe in the newly converted followers of Virashaivism and deep anxiety in the Jains.</p>

<p>&#8220;To any man who knows anything about Indian history, that very statement proves that the whole thing was a fraud, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">because the temple of Jagannath is an old Buddhistic temple</span>.

<p>&#8220;Damodarvarman, who is regarded predecessor of Attivarman, was devotee of Samyak Sambuddha. The Kapoteswara temple at Chezarla of fourth century was a originally a chaitya hall later converted into a brahmanic temple. He is described as son of king who performed Hiranyagarbha mahadana. Attivarman, worshiper of Sambhu, performed this mahadana. [D. C. Sarkar, &#8216;Classical age&#8217; p.202 ff.]

<p>&#8220;Scholars agreed that the inner first and second galleries, which contain narrative panels depicting Hindu scences, might have been carved at a later time possibly during the reign of Jayavarman VIII (r. 1243-1295) who was a bigoted Hindu king to have reputedly converted the Bayon into a Hindu temple and also damaged many other Buddhist buildings.&#8221; Roveda 1998: 131-150 as mentioned in Buddhist Architecture, By Le Huu Phuoc, p.263, Grafikol, 2010</p>

<p>&#8220;Not only theoretically did the Hindus attack Buddhism, but the hundreds of Buddhist monks were slaughtered, their temples destroyed and &#8221;the massacre of thousands of Bhuddist families was ordered by the sixth century c.e, Hindu king&#8221; Mihirakulu.[Heritage of Kashmir pg 58 by Muhammad Amin Pandit ]&#8221; Numerous Buddhist temples were taken over by the Brahmins, the most prominent being the shrine of Pas Pahar atop the Takht i Sulaiman overlooking the Dal Lake in Srinagar, Which was renamed the Shankaracharya temple and was dedicated to Jyesteswara or Shiva. The HIndu King Nara is said to have burnt down thousands of (Buddhist) Viharas [Islamic culture in Kashmir p.43, By G.M.D. Sofi]. Brahmanical hostility against the Buddhists persisted even in the period of Muslim rule. Thus, we learn that Udayagiri, the Brahmin Prime minister of Sultan Shahabuddin suggested to the king that to overcome his fiscal crisis he should loot the Buddhist temples and melt their idols to make coins. The King, however, responded with &#8221;indignation at this suggestion.&#8221;[Islamic culture in Kashmir p.139, By G.M.D. Sofi] But on the other hand, Muslim rulers allowed religious freedom and some of them even collected &#8221;books on the puranas, logic and Mimansa from different parts of India at considerable expense. These books were placed at the disposal of the scholars.

<p>&#8220;Shri K. R. Srinivasan has confirmed that what is now known as Anantasayangudi cave temple in Undavali was a temple of Vishnukundin times and originally a Buddhist temple which was converted to a Vishnu temple. [p. 33 and 81, &#8216;Temples of South India&#8217;] <a href="http://www.ambedkar.org/research/Rajput_Period_Was_Dark_Age_Of_India.htm" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">http://www.ambedkar.org/research/Rajput_Period_Was_Dark_Age_Of_India.htm<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>&#8220;Buddhist shrines were converted into Brahmincal ones, and Brahmincal legends called Kshetra Puranas, were engrafted on the Buddhist legends, and found a place in the Brahmanda and Skanda Puranas. Gayu, Bhuvaneswari, Sanchi, Puri, all come under the same category. Coming to Southern India, we have the well known places Tirupati and Conjeceram abaring in the same fate, the Buddhist phase of Tirupati having been an image of Padmapani, the Padma (lotus) being now covered by a Kavaeha (Sheath), while the image itself is passing by the name of Srinivasn. This fact was first known about 1850 to the employes in the inner part of the temple, when some parts of the Kaveha haing become too much loosened, had to undergo repairs. The real nature was at once discovered. But the matter was kept a profounf secret. Now are the Saiva temples of Conjeveram any way better; Conheveram, which had during the time of Hioun Thsand so many as 10000 Buddhist Bhikshus and about 100 Sangharanas, had its Sangharamas converted in the course of three following centuries into Saiva temples during the reign of Saiva kings. Even to day, a Jaina Buddhist temple is seen in a village two miles off, but which once formed part of it with a number of Jains living there and a large number of Buddhist statues are scattered about in the Saiva temples. The history of Indian temples architecture shows that most of these temples the exceptions are very few have undergone three stages: first, they were Buddhistic, then they became Saivite, ad lastly they were Vaishnava temples.&#8221; The Theosophist May 1891 to September 1891 By H. S. Olcott p.683, Theosophical Publishing House, 1891</p>
<p>&#8220;According to Dr. Jayaprakash, a number of Buddha statues have been discovered at places like Ambalapuzha, Karunagapalli, Pallickal, Bharanikkavu, Mavelikara and Neelamperur in Kerala. &#8216;They are either in the form of smashed pieces or thrown away from viharas. Lord Ayyappa of Sabarimala and Lord Padmanabha at Thiruvananthapuram are the proxy images of Buddha being worshipped as Vishnu. Hundreds of Buddhists were killed on the banks of Aluva river. The term &#8216;Aluva&#8217; was derived from &#8216;Alawai&#8217; which means &#8216;Trisul&#8217;, a weapon used by Hindu fanatics to stab Buddhists. Similarly, on the banks of the Vaigai river in Tamilnadu, thousands of Buddhists were killed by the Vaishnava Saint, Sambanthar. Thevaram, a Tamil book, documents this brutal extermination of Buddhism.&#8217; <a href="http://www.milligazette.com/Archives/15042001/Art06.htm" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">http://www.milligazette.com/Archives/15042001/Art06.htm<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>

<p>&#8220;Accordingly, as Julia Hegewald argues in her paper on temple conversions in Karnataka, the Lingayats appropriated and reused the <strong>Doddappa Temple</strong> at Adargunchi, Karnataka. Built sometime between 10th and 11th centuries, the temple today is fronted by a stone sculpture of the bull Nandi (Shiva’s vehicle) and houses a massive black stone statue of a Jina, placed alongside a Shiva linga (phallus, the form in which Lingayats worship Shiva).</p>
<p>Constructed between the 7th and 9th centuries, the <strong>Megudi temple</strong> was reused as a Virashaiva shrine sometime in the 12th century. Here the Jina idol was uprooted from garbagriha, smeared with sacred Virashaiva ash, and placed in the central aisle that now leads to the sanctum sanctorum housing the Shiva linga. Such a placement of uprooted idol ensured that every devotee approaching the inner chamber would see the displaced Jina and be aware of the Virashaiva “annexation” of the temple.&#8221;<br />

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">HINDU KINGS PLUNDERING HINDU TEMPLES</span></strong></p>
<p>Muslim rulers like Mahmud Ghazni looting Somnath is seen as religious extremism but what will Hindutvadis call this?</p>
<p>&#8220;There are instances of Hindu rulers destroying temples in order to loot their wealth, such as Harshadeva of Kashmir, who defiled and looted temples and even had a special officer whose function was to seize the icons of tribal shine, and in Bodhgaya a Buddhist Vihara was destroyed by Sasanka in the 6th C to build a Hindu temple which still exists.&#8221; Sampradayikta Virodhi Andolan, Black Sunday. December 1992 p.2 as mentioned in Religion und Gewalt: Konflikte, Rituale, Deutungen (1500-1800), edited by Kaspar von Greyerz, Kim Siebenhüner, p.72, Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 2006</p>
<p>Harsha, a ruler of Kashmir (1089-1111AD), plundered all the temples in his own kingdom, barring four, in order to replenish his treasury, and not a word of protest was uttered. He destroyed both Hindu and Buddhist temples, and is credited with creating an office of &#8220;devotpaatana-nayaka&#8221;, destroyer of gods. Reference &#8221; Rajatarangini&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;The plunder of temples was carried out by kings irrespective of their religion. Temples were repositories of wealth. An ideological fig leaf was taken from religion to justify the desecration. Temples were plundered by the Marathas in Tipu&#8217;s Sultante. The Shirangapatanam temple was destroyed by the Maratha armies and was repaired by Tipu Sultan. Attacking the temple was also a way of Humiliting the other kings&#8230; Temples were also looted by ing Harsha of kashmir in the 11th century. A mention of this is found in Kalhan&#8217;s book Rajtarangini, which syas that he appointed a special officer to uproot the golden idols from the temples. This offiver was designated as devotpatan naya&#8217;s (officer who uproots the Gods). Parmar Kings (Shubharvarnman a.d 1193-1210) destroyed Jain temples in Cambay and Dabhoi in addition to plundering temples in his own kingdom.&#8221; Communal Politics: Fact versus Myth, p.52, By Ram Puniyani</p>
<p>&#8220;642 AD: Pallava king Narasimhavarman I looted the image of Ganesha from the Chalukyan capital of Vatapi (present day Badami in Belgaum dist.)</p>
<p>692 AD: Chalukyas invaded North India and brought back to the Deccan what would appear to be images of Ganga and Yamuna looted from defeated powers.</p>
<p>8th century AD: Bengali troops sought revenge on King Lalithaditya&#8217;s kingdom in Kashmir by destroying what they thought was an image of Vaikunta the state deity of Kashmir kingdom.</p>
<p>9th century AD: Rashtrakuta king Govinda III invaded and occupied Kanchipuram which so intimidated the King of Sri Lanka that he sent Govinda (probably Buddhist) images representing the Sinhala state.</p>
<p>Rashtrakuta king Indira III not only destroyed the temple of Kalapriya at Kalpa near the Jamuna river, patronized by their deadly enemies, the Pratiharas, but they took special delight in recording the fact.</p>
<p>9th century AD: Pandyan King Srimara Srivallabha also invaded Sri Lanka and took back to his capital golden Buddha image.</p>
<p>Early 10th century, Pratihara King, Hermabapala, seized solid gold image of Vishnu Vaikunta when he defeated the Sahi kings of Kangra (Himachal Pradesh)</p>
<p>Early 11th century: Chola King, Rajendra I furnished his capital with images he seized from several prominent neighbouring kings: Durga and Ganesha images from the Chalukyas, Bhairava, Bhairavi and Kali images from the Kalingas or Orissa as Nandi image from the Eastern Chalukyans.&#8221;<br />

<h2><a id="zoroastrianism"></a>Intolerance towards Zoroastrianism</h2>
<p>There is no direct reference made to Zoroastrianism in Hindu scriptures. But in the Vedas, the Asuras are depicted as villains, in Zoroastrian text Ahura is god and in the Vedas Asuras are demons. In Vedas, Devas are gods while in Zoroastrian text Daevas are demons. Zoroastrian text also speaks about the Aryan country. This suggests that Vedic religion and Zoroastrianism are approximate of the same age and there was a war between Aryans and Zoroastrians. Vedas speaks about killing the Asuras, and Zoroastrian texts also speak about killing Daevas by thousands. Zoroastrian text speaks of several Daevas but not all those Daevas are mentioned in Vedas. Daeva in Zoroastrianism may mean all evils and not just the Aryans. Only a few Devas (Vedic gods) like Mitra, Yama, Indra, etc., can be found in both Vedas and Zoroastrian texts, but these gods are viewed as heroes in the Zoroastrian text who sided with the Zoroastrians against Aryans. I won&#8217;t indulge further on this topic as it is related to the Aryan invasion/migration and a separate article would be appropriate to discus this.</p>
<p>As the proverb goes &#8216;History is written by the victors&#8217;. Learning about Asuras and Devas in Vedas would be one-sided we have to look at the other side also to get a better understanding of what really may have happened. Asuras are demonized and depicted like villains in the Vedas, but are the Devas depicted as heroes in Zoroastrian texts? Let&#8217;s have a look at some Zoroastrian verses,</p>
<p>Ushtavad Gatha, Yasna 44 verse 20 &#8220;I ask Thee, O Mazda, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">How it is possible for the Daevas to become kind severance, the persons who fight for their selfish ends and for satisfying their wishes. The have flung all earth to hatred and anger</span> with the help of Kavis, Karapans and Usikhsh (2). Would they ever strive to cause the advance and security of the world through Asha and bring about peace and love for all.&#8221; Tr. Mobed Firouz Azargoshasb</p>
<p>Ahunuvaita Gatha Yasna 30 Verse 6 &#8220;The followers of Daeva (or Devil worshippers) did not choose the right path, because they were in doubt and were deceived. Hence, they did not choose the right path but followed the worst thought, the devil or anger, which is the cause of all evil deeds, so as to destroy the mental life of the people.&#8221; Tr. Mobed Firouz Azargoshasb</p>
<p>Yasna 12.4 &#8220;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">I reject the authority of the Daevas, the wicked, no-good, lawless, evil-knowing, the most druj-like of beings, the foulest of beings, the most damaging of beings</span>. I reject the Daevas and their comrades, I reject the yatu and their comrades; <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">I reject any who harm beings</span>. I reject them with my thoughts, words, and deeds. I reject them publicly. Even as I reject the [evil authorities], so too do I reject the hostile followers of the druj.&#8221; Tr. J.H. Peterson</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Daevas were oppressors</span></strong></p>
<p>Frawardin Yasht 13.57 &#8220;We worship the good, strong, beneficent Fravashis of the faithful, who showed their paths to the stars, the moon, the sun, and the endless lights, that had stood before for a long time in the same place, without moving forwards, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">through the oppression of the Daevas and the assaults of the Daevas</span>.&#8221; Tr. James Darmesteter</p>
<p>Frawardin Yasht 13.130 &#8220;We worship the Fravashi of the holy Yima, the son of Vivanghant; the valiant Yima, who had flocks at his wish; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">to stand against the oppression caused by the Daevas</span>, against the drought that destroys pastures, and against death that creeps unseen.&#8221; Tr. James Darmesteter</p>
<p>Aban Yasht 5.58 &#8220;They begged of her a boon, saying: &#8220;Grant us this, O good, most beneficent Ardvi Sura Anahita! that we may overcome the valiant warrior Tusa, and that we may smite of the Aryan people their fifties and their hundreds, their hundreds and their thousands, their thousands and their tens of thousands, their tens of thousands and their myriads of myriads.&#8221; Tr. James Darmesteter</p>
<p>Warharan Yasht 14.60 &#8220;That I may be as constantly victorious as any one of all the Aryans; that I may smite this army, that I may smite down this army, that I may cut in pieces this army that is coming behind me.&#8221; Tr. James Darmesteter</p>

And many times Aryans used to attack them mainly for the purpose of plundering them which is evident from the plunder and massacre of Kikata and Panis tribes which I have mentioned in <a href="https://vedkabhed.wordpress.com/2014/05/15/killing-infidels-in-vedas/" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Killing infidels in Vedas<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> article. Yaska Acharya defines Dasyu as,</p>
<p>Nirukta 7.23 Dasyu (demon) is derived from (the root) das, meaning to lay waste.</p>
<p>Swami Dayanand Saraswati defines Dasyu as wicked one. Veda says that the Dasyus followed a different religion, they did not sacrifice, and they are also called godless. Maybe they had atheistic philosophies like Buddhists. Veda explicitly commands the Aryans to kill and plunder Dasyus because of the difference in faith. I have used Hindi translations by Pandit Ram Govind Trivedi and Shri Ram Sharma Acharya,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.105.8 Grind off our sins: with song <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">will we conquer the men who sing no hymns</span>: Not easily art thou pleased with prayerless sacrifice.<br />

<p>Dasyus not offering oblation to Vedic gods, not sacrificing, being riteless, without worship and rituals are emphasized, the difference in faith is emphasized in the Vedas which means that one of the main reasons for killing Dasyus was their religion.</p>

<h2><a id="gods-murderers"></a>Hindu gods are murderers</h2>
<p>Hindu gods killed many innocent people. Hindu gods are said to have taken birth on earth in flesh and bone to guide people, a god was engaged in a lecherous activity, and another one was engaged in getting back his wife for over a decade. I really don&#8217;t know what message they left for humanity. Hindu gods are depicted wielding weapons with fierce facial expressions. Many times innocent blood was shed with those weapons. Here are some stories about Hindu gods killing innocent people, I will start with Vishnu and his avatars. Let&#8217;s have a look at the words of the demon,</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">VISHNU</span></strong></p>
<p>Matsya Purana 178.6-22 &#8221;He is my enemy. He is the destroyer of my elders, He lived in the oceans, destroyed the demons Madhu and Kaitabha. It can be said that as long as he lives, the war between us will not end. There will be a most fearful fight between Him and me. He has killed many demons in this battle. He is very cruel. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">He has not shown His clemency even to the children and the woman of the demons killed</span>. He is shameless. He is Visnu. He is the heaven of the Devas. He sleeps on the Sesa serpent&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, Edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>Demons in Hindu scriptures don&#8217;t necessarily mean beings with monstrous looks. Some non-Vedic tribes were considered demons in Hindu scriptures. We read here that Vishnu killed women and children of the enemy demons. Vishnu on being urged by Indra is said to have beheaded the wife of sage Bhrigu and Bhrigu cursed Vishnu to take incarnations on earth.</p>
<p>Valmiki Ramayana, Uttara Kanda, chapter 51. &#8220;Learn, O king, what happened formerly during the conflict between the Devas and Asuras. The Daityas, whom the Suras threatened, took refuge with the consort of Bhrigu and she, having given them a haven, they dwelt there in safety. Seeing them thus succoured, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">the Chief of the gods, enraged with his sharp-edged discus severed the head of Bhrigu&#8217;s wife</span>. Beholding the murder of his consort, Bhrigu, in his wrath, instantly cursed Vishnu, the destroyer of enemy hosts, saying:- &#8216;Since in thine insensate fury, thou has slain my spouse, who should never have died thus, thou shalt take birth in the world of men, O Janardana, and there thou shall live separated from thy consort for many years.&#8221; Tr. Hari Prasad Shastri</p>
<p>Matsya Purana Part I, 47.101-105 &#8220;At that, both Indra and Visnu were overcome with fear and began to contrive some means of escape. Visnu said to Indra:- &#8216;How shall we escape from her?&#8217; Indra replied:- &#8216;Lord! kill her before she consumed me. I am solely protected by you, destroy her soon without delay.&#8217; Visnu thought over the great sin of killing a woman, in spite of that, he took up his Sudarsana Chakra to free Himself from that impending calamity. Trembling with fear, on thinking over the consequences of her anger and being afraid of the consequences of His own wrath, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">He severed her head with His Chakra</span>. The sage Bhrigu then cursed Visnu for killing his wife.&#8221; Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>As per Brahmanda Purana 2.3.72.139-140 Vishnu pierced her head with his weapon and cut it into three parts. The context of this story is that. There was a battle between demons and Devas. Demons suffered a huge loss at the hands of the Devas and only a few demons survived so they wanted to take shelter and Shukra asked the Daityas to take refuge in his father&#8217;s house till he gets a boon from Shiva to defeat the Devas. So Daityas took shelter with the wife of sage Bhrigu who assured them safety. But Indra and Vishnu arrived there to kill Daityas but Shukra&#8217;s mother resisted the attack as she possessed powers and was going to burn up Indra and Vishnu so Indra asked Vishnu to kill her and Vishnu beheads her with his Sudarshan Chakra, Bhrigu arrived at the house and finds his wife killed by Vishnu and he curses Vishnu. As per Devi Bhagavatam Vishnu resurrects Bhrigu&#8217;s wife but as per Matsya Purana 1.47.108-111 Bhrigu resurrects his own wife. Vishnu and Indra could&#8217;ve fled from the spot or paralyzed her but they killed her. There&#8217;s a verse in Bhagavad Purana which says that Vishnu&#8217;s Sudarshan Chakra causes miscarriages of demons&#8217; wives,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 5.24.15 When the Sudarśana disc enters those provinces, the pregnant wives of the demons all have miscarriages due to fear of its effulgence.&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">VAMANA</span></strong></p>
<p>There was an Asura king named Mahabali who was a just and noble king. But to secure the kingship of Devas, Vamana avatar of Vishnu killed him and sent him to the lower world. This is mentioned in Srimad Bhagavatam Canto  8 chapters 18-20</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PARASHURAMA</span></strong></p>
<p>Parashurama was the sixth avatar of Vishnu. He is said to have beheaded his own mother Renuka as well as his brothers on the command of his father Jamadagni. Parashurama&#8217;s name in Mahabharata also appears as Rama, so do not confuse this Rama with Rama the killer of Ravana,</p>
<p>Mahabharata Vana Parva 3.116.13-14 &#8220;And then Rama, the slayer of hostile heroes, came to the hermitage, last of all. Him the mighty-armed Jamadagni, of great austerities, addressed, saying, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">&#8216;Kill this wicked mother of thine, without compunction, O my son.&#8217; Thereupon Rama immediately took up an axe and therewith severed his mother&#8217;s head</span>.&#8221; Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>The context of the story is that Renuka went to bathe and on her return, she happened to see King Chitraratha of Martikavata copulating with his wives, she was inspired with desire, and when she returned to the hermitage her husband Jamdagni came to know about it so he ordered his sons to kill her, they refused but Parshurama on the command of his father beheaded his mother. Jamadagni also told Parashurama to kill his brothers as they refused his command and Parashurama obeying his father&#8217;s command killed his brothers as well. But on Parashurama&#8217;s request to Jamadagni, his mother Renuka and brothers were brought back to life and Parashurama also requested that his mother and brothers shall not remember anything.</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 9.16.6 &#8220;Jamadagni then ordered his youngest son, Paraśurāma, to kill his brothers, who had disobeyed this order, and his mother, who had mentally committed adultery. Lord Paraśurāma, knowing the power of his father, who was practiced in meditation and austerity, killed his mother and brothers immediately.&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana 2.3.23.65 has an indirect reference to Parashurama&#8217;s killing of his own mother.</p>
<p>What was the sin of Renuka? That she was sexually aroused seeing the sexual intercourse of a king! Surely what she did was sinful but not so much that she deserved to be beheaded by her son the sixth incarnation of Vishnu. And Hindu god Parashurama also beheaded his mother without any hesitation.</p>
<p>Parashurama annihilated the entire Kshatriya race because his father was killed by Kartavirya Arjuna who belonged to the Kshatriya caste. He is said to have killed Kshatriyas twenty-one times,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 9.16.10 &#8220;Once when Paraśurāma left the āśrama for the forest with Vasumān and his other brothers, the sons of Kārtavīryārjuna took the opportunity to approach Jamadagni&#8217;s residence to seek vengeance for their grudge. The sons of Kārtavīryārjuna were determined to commit sinful deeds. Therefore when they saw Jamadagni sitting by the side of the fire to perform yajña and meditating upon the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is praised by the best of selected prayers, they took the opportunity to kill him. With pitiable prayers, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Reṇukā, the mother of Paraśurāma and wife of Jamadagni, begged for the life of her husband. But the sons of Kārtavīryārjuna, being devoid of the qualities of kṣatriyas, were so cruel that despite her prayers they forcibly cut off his head and took it away</span>.&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 9.16.16 Thus lamenting, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Lord Paraśurāma entrusted his father&#8217;s dead body to his brothers and personally took up his axe, having decided to put an end to all the kṣatriyas on the surface of the world</span>. [18-19] With the blood of the bodies of these sons, Lord Paraśurāma created a ghastly river, which brought great fear to the kings who had no respect for brahminical culture. Because the kṣatriyas, the men of power in government, were performing sinful activities, Lord Paraśurāma, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">on the plea of retaliating for the murder of his father, rid all the kṣatriyas from the face of the earth twenty-one times</span>. Indeed, in the place known as Samanta-pañcaka he created nine lakes filled with their blood.&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Brahma Purana 104.110-111 &#8220;The Earth where crores of Ksatriyas remained scattered about, the Earth that is adorned by the mountains Meru and Mandara was rid of Ksatriyas twentyone times by the lord. After making the Earth devoid of Ksatriyas, Parasurama of great fame performed a horse sacrifice in order to dispel his sins.&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Mahabharata Adi Parva 1.2.1-7 &#8220;The Rishis said, &#8216;O son of Suta, we wish to hear a full and circumstantial account of the place mentioned by you as Samanta-panchaya.'&#8221;Sauti said, &#8216;Listen, O ye Brahmanas, to the sacred descriptions I utter O ye best of men, ye deserve to hear of the place known as Samanta-panchaka. In the interval between the Treta and Dwapara Yugas, Rama (the son of Jamadagni) great among all who have borne arms, urged by impatience of wrongs, repeatedly smote the noble race of Kshatriyas. And when that fiery meteor, by his own valour, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">annihilated the entire tribe of the Kshatriyas, he formed at Samanta-panchaka five lakes of blood</span>. We are told that his reason being overpowered by anger he offered oblations of blood to the manes of his ancestors, standing in the midst of the sanguine waters of those lakes. It was then that his forefathers of whom Richika was the first having arrived there addressed him thus, &#8216;O Rama, O blessed Rama, O offspring of Bhrigu, we have been gratified with the reverence thou hast shown for thy ancestors and with thy valour …&#8221; Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Parashurama burned up the entire city along with the inhabitants</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana 2.3.46.20-26 &#8220;A battle took place once again between Rama and the kings, wherein the infuriated sage of high intellect, killed a hundred kings. After killing Surasena and others along with their armies and vehicles, he made the entire group of Ksatriyas fall on the ground in a moment. The kings who survived, whose wishes had been frustrated and whose vehicles and armies has been killed fled in all directions. After routing the armies, killing the enemies and winning the battle, Rama killed hundreds of kings and heroes by means of the fire from his excellent arrows. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Overwhelmed with fury and desirous of burning the entire city</span>, Bhargava discharged a missile that had a lustre similar to that of Kalagni (the fire of world-destruction). <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The fire from that missile burned the city along with elephants, horses and men</span>. The flames enveloped the clusters of the entire rampart-wall of the city.  On seeing the city being burned and desirous of saving his own life, Prince Virihotra became frightened and fled quickly for the sake of life.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>How is it possible that all the Kshatriyas in the world were engaged in sinful activities? As I said earlier, everything Hindu gods didn&#8217;t like is demonized in Hindu scriptures. Parashurama killed all Kshatriyas to avenge his father&#8217;s murder by a few Kshatriya.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">KRISHNA</span></strong></p>
<p>Krishna beheaded a washerman just because he refused to give him clothes and spoke rudely,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 10.41.36-37 &#8220;Fools, get out of here quickly! Don&#8217;t beg like this if You want to stay alive. When someone is too bold, the King&#8217;s men arrest him and kill him and take all his property. As the washerman thus spoke brazenly, the son of Devaki became angry, and <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">then merely with His fingertips He separated the man&#8217;s head from his body</span>.&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The slaughter of </span><span style="color: #000000;">the </span><span style="color: #000000;">washerman is summarized in Bravaivarta Purana, Krishna Janma Khanda 132.62-75 and also mentioned in Agni Purana 12.23. Krishna and Balrama visited the city Mathura. And a washerman was passing by so they asked him</span><span style="color: #000000;"> to give them</span><span style="color: #000000;"> some clothes that belonged to the King. From the words of the washerman</span><span style="color: #000000;">,</span><span style="color: #000000;"> it appears that he thought Krishna and Balram</span><span style="color: #000000;">a to be wanderers. So he plainly</span><span style="color: #000000;"> refused </span><span style="color: #000000;">to give clothes. This story sounds</span><span style="color: #000000;"> same </span><span style="color: #000000;">as</span><span style="color: #000000;"> the crimes we read where thieves kill people to take their possessions. After beheading the washerman Krishna and Balrama took the clothes.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Krishna couldn&#8217;t bear criticism. He beheaded King Shishupala just because he abused him. Pandavas were performing sacrifice at Indraprastha where Shishupala was also present and he was beheaded there.</span></p>
<p>Padma Purana VI.252.13-20 &#8220;All those, protected by Krsna, having saluted and praised Krsna, went to their respective countries. Then, going to Indraprastha with the two (i.e. Bhima and Arjuna), Krsna made Yudhisthira perform the Rajasuya sacrifice. There, after the sacrifice was over, the chief honour was given to Krsna with the consent of Bhisma. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">There </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Sisupala spoke many abusive words to Krsna. Krsna too cut off his head with the Sudarsana (disc)</span>&#8230;&#8221; Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 10.74.39-44 &#8220;Upon hearing such intolerable blasphemy of the Lord, several members of the assembly covered their ears and walked out, angrily cursing the King of Cedi. Anyone who fails to immediately leave the place where he hears criticism of the Supreme Lord or His faithful devotee will certainly fall down, bereft of his pious credit. Then the sons of Pāṇḍu became furious, and together with the warriors of the Matsya, Kaikaya and Sṛñjaya clans, they rose up from their seats with weapons poised, ready to kill Śiśupāla. Undaunted, Śiśupāla then took up his sword and shield in the midst of all the assembled kings, O Bhārata, and hurled insults at those who sided with Lord Kṛṣṇa. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">At that point the Supreme Lord stood up and checked His devotees. He then angrily sent forth His razor-sharp disc and severed the head of His enemy</span> as he was attacking. When Śiśupāla was thus killed, a great roar and howl went up from the crowd. Taking advantage of that disturbance, the few kings who were supporters of Śiśupāla quickly left the assembly out of fear for their lives.&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>As you may know that Krishna was killed accidentally by a hunter named Jara. Although Jara murdered Krishna and can&#8217;t be called innocent but this contradicts modern Hindus&#8217; statement that Krishna was very merciful. Even after begging for mercy Krishna took revenge and killed Jara but awarded him entry to heaven,</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 5.37.60-69 “Respecting the words of the Brahman, the imprecation of Durvásas, the illustrious Krishńa sat engaged in thought, resting his foot upon his knee. Then came there a hunter, named Jará, whose arrow was tipped with a blade made of the piece of iron of the club, which had not been reduced to powder; and beholding from a distance the foot of Krishńa, he mistook it for part of a deer, and shooting his arrow, lodged it in the sole. Approaching his mark, he saw the four-armed king, and, falling at his feet, repeatedly besought his forgiveness, exclaiming, “I have done this deed unwittingly, thinking I was aiming at a deer! Have pity upon me, who am consumed by my crime; for thou art able to consume me!” Bhagavat replied, “Fear not thou in the least. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Go, hunter, through my favour, to heaven, the abode of the gods.” As soon as he had thus spoken, a celestial car appeared, and the hunter, ascending it, forthwith proceeded to heaven</span>.” Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-size: 12pt;">Balrama</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Balarama is sometime</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">s</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> conside</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">red an avatar of Vishnu. As per </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Hindu text</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">s</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">, Balarama was addicted to gambling. Balarama is said to have played dice with Rukmi the brother</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">-in-</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">law of Krishna. It is said that Rukmi wanted to avenge the elopement of his sister Rukmini by Krishna so he challenged Balarama the brother of Krishna in the game of dice who accepted it without hesitation though he wasn’t an expert at it. Balarama lost many bets to Rukmi but won the final bet which was very big. Then an argument ensued between Rukmi and </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Balarama that Balarama had cheated him (Rukmi) and that Rukmi is the real winner. Balarama couldn’t tolerate this so he killed Rukmi for such </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">a </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">petty argument,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Vishnu Purana 5.23</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">.10-28</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> “After the wedding had been solemnized, several of the kings, headed by him of Kalinga, said to Rukmin, “This wielder of the ploughshare is ignorant of the dice, which may be converted into his misfortune: why may we not contend with him, and beat him, in play?” The potent Rukmin replied to them, and said, “So let it be:” and he engaged Balaráma at a game of dice in the palace. Balaráma soon lost to Rukmin a thousand Nishkas: he then staked and lost another thousand; and then pledged ten thousand, which Rukmin, who was well skilled in gambling, also won. At this the king of Kalinga laughed aloud, and the weak and exulting Rukmin grinned, and said, “Baladeva is losing, for he knows nothing of the game; although, blinded by a vain passion for play, he thinks he understands the dice.” Halayudha, galled by the broad laughter of the Kalinga prince, and the contemptuous speech of Rukmin, was exceedingly angry, and, overcome with passion, increased his stake to ten millions of Nishkas. Rukmin accepted the challenge, and therefore threw the dice. Baladeva won, and cried aloud, “The stake is mine.” But Rukmin called out as loudly, that he was the winner. “Tell no lies, Bala,” said he: “the stake is yours; that is true; but I did not agree to it: although this be won by you, yet still I am the winner.” A deep voice was then heard in the sky, inflaming still more the anger of the high-spirited Baladeva, saying, “Bala has rightly won the whole sum, and Rukmin speaks falsely: although he did not accept the pledge in words, he did so by his acts (having cast the dice).” </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000; font-size: 12pt;">Balaráma thus excited, his eyes red with rage, started up, and struck Rukmin with the board on which the game was played, and killed him</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">… When Krishńa heard that Rukmin had been killed by his brother, he made no remark, being afraid of Rukminí on the one hand, and of Bala on the other…”</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> Tr.

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">RAMA</span></strong></p>
<p>Rama beheaded a Shudra named Shambuka because that Shudra was practicing penance that may have included chanting some Vedic Mantras.</p>
<p>Ramayana of Valmiki, Uttara Kanda 7, Chapters 75-76 &#8221;On this that Prince born of Raghu approached the one who had given himself up to rigorous practices and said:- &#8221;Blessed art thou, O Ascetic, who art faithful to thy vows! <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">From what caste art thou sprung</span>, O Thou who hast grown old in mortification and who art established in heroism. I am interested in this matter, I Rama, the son of Dasaratha. What purpose hast thou in view? Is it heaven or some other object? What boon dost thou seek by means of this hard penance? I wish to know what thou desirest in performing these austerities, O Ascetic. May prosperity attend thee! <span style="color: #ff0000;">Art thou a brahmin? Art thou an invincible Kshatriya? Art thou a Vaishya, one of the third caste or art thou a Shudra</span>? Answer me truthfully!&#8221;&#8230;Hearing the words of Rama of imperishable exploits, that ascetic, his head still hanging downwards, answered:- <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">&#8221;O Rama, I was born of a Shudra alliance and I am performing this rigorous penance in order to acquire the status of a God in this body</span>. I am not telling a lie, O Rama, I wish to attain the Celestial Region. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Know that I am a Shudra and my name is Shambuka</span>.&#8221; <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">As he was yet speaking, Raghava, drawing his brilliant and stainless sword from its scabbard, cut off his head</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Shudra being slain</span>, all the Gods and their leaders with Agni&#8217;s followers, cried out, &#8221;Well done! Well done!&#8221; overwhelming Rama with praise, and a rain of celestial flowers of divine fragrance fell on all sides, scattered by Vayu.&#8221; Tr. Hari Prasad Shastri</p>
<p>Ramayana of Valmiki, Uttara Kanda 7, Chapters 75-76 &#8220;O Kakutstha be happy! This very day that child has received new life and has been restored to his parents. The child was resuscited at the instant that the head of the Shudra fell.&#8221; Tr. Hari Prasad Shastri</p>
<p>A Brahmin boy died in Ram&#8217;s kingdom so Rama went out to find the cause of this death signifying that there must be some unrighteous thing going on that led to the death of this boy. So Rama found Shambuka who was hanging upside down from a tree performing vigorous penance. Ram asked his caste and reason for his penance and beheaded him. Some apologists say that Rama beheaded Shambuka because Shambuka was performing penance to acquire a boon for an evil purpose. If Shambuka was slain for that then why wasn&#8217;t Ravana beheaded too? Is that because Ravana was a Brahmin and Shambuka was a Shuda? Shambuka in this passage clearly said that he is performing penance to acquire the status of God in his body. He wasn&#8217;t performing it with some evil intention. If he was lying and Rama already knew his intention then why did he first enquired and then beheaded him? Why didn&#8217;t he just go there and behead him? Rama asked Shambuka&#8217;s caste, Shambuka reiterated that he is a Shudra. Shudra caste is emphasized here which means that Rama beheaded him because a Shudra should not perform such penance.</p>
<p>Lakshmana on the command of Rama is said to have cut off the nose and ears of Ravana&#8217;s sister Shurpanakha who had approached Rama expressing her love for him.</p>
<p>Valmiki Ramayana, Aranya Kanda 3.18.20-21 &#8220;She is freakish, knavish and overtly ruttish, oh, tigerly man, it will be apt of you to deface this paunchy demoness&#8221; Thus Rama said to Lakshmana. Thus said to that mighty Lakshmana he infuriately drew sword and chopped off her ears and nose before the very eyes of Rama.&#8221; Tr. Desi Raju Hanumanth Rao</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 10.47.17 &#8221;He is so very wily that in his incarnation as Rama, he had killed the king of monkeys, (Vali) like a hunter. Also, being brought under the control of his wife he cut off the nose of a woman Shurpanakha by name, who had come to him being stricken with amorous desire.&#8221; Tr. J.M. Sanyal</p>
<p>Also mentioned in Agni Purana 7.5</p>
<p>In the next life, Shurpanakha is incarnated as Kubja the hunchback woman and Rama as Krishna and these two had an illicit relationship which I have mentioned in <a href="https://vedkabhed.wordpress.com/2014/12/27/hinduism-and-lust/" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Hinduism and Lust<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> article.</p>
<p>Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Krishna Janma Khanda 115.93-102 &#8220;Kubja, in her previous birth, was the sister of the wicked Ravana. Her name was Surpanakha. Actuated by lust, she desired the society of Rama. Lakshamana, the chief of the pious men, cut off her nose&#8230;.&#8221; Tr. Various Sanskrit Scholars, Edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>It is said that Shurpanakha was going to kill Sita. There is another version that says that when Shurpanakha approached Rama, he asked her to go to Lakshman and then Lakshman cut off her nose and ears. But the story in Ramayana seems more authentic. Lakshman cutting off the nose and ears of Ravan&#8217;s sister is what provoked Ravana to revenge. It&#8217;s quite funny that Ravana is demonized despite being a Brahmin and Shiva&#8217;s ardent devotee just because he abducted Ram&#8217;s wife Sita. But Hindu gods raping and abducting women doesn&#8217;t make them villains. I say Shurpanakha was lucky enough to have only her ears and nose cut off. There is a story of another woman being deformed by Lakshmana who approached Lakshamana to express her love,</p>
<p>Valmiki Ramayana Aranya Kanda 3.69.15-17 &#8220;Closeting Soumitri in her embrace she told him this sentence, &#8220;I am Ayomukhi, by my name&#8230; you won me by your heroic personality, by that way, none can win me over&#8230; thus, you alone are my lover&#8230; oh, hero, oh, my husband&#8230; you will romance with me on mountaintops, in rivers, and on sandy isles, till the end of this life&#8230;&#8221; So is the love prattle of that demoness Ayomukhi. When said that way that enemy-suppressor <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Lakshmana became furious, and upraising his sword he sheared off her nose, one ear, and one of her breasts</span>.&#8221; Tr. Desi Raju Hanumanth Rao</p>
<p>Now some people may say that this is the same story with variations in names. The name of the woman here is Ayomukhi whereas in the same Valmiki Ramayana Surpanakha appears to be the name of Ravana&#8217;s sister. So the same variation cannot occur in the same text. Shurpanakha expressed her love for Rama while Ayomukhi expressed her love for Lakshmana, also there is no mention of cutting up Shurpanakha&#8217;s breast but this story does. Most important of all, the mutilation of Ayomukhi occurred after Sita was abducted while Shurpanakha&#8217;s mutilation happened before Ravana abducted Sita. Poor lady Ayomukhi&#8217;s ears, nose and breast were cut off by the cruel Lakshman just because she expressed her love.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">HANUMAN</span></strong></p>
<p>In the Valmiki Ramayana Hanuman is said to have burnt up Lanka along with its inhabitants. The word demon is used to describe the people of Lanka. As you may know, Non-Hindus were considered demons, just go to Sri Lanka and let’s see whether you find humans or demons there. The verses also show that the Lankans amassed great wealth,</p>
<p>Valmiki Ramayana Sundara Khanda 5, Sarga 54, Verses 24- “The demons, who were running hither and thither to protect their houses and who lost their spirits and abundant wealth, created a tumultuous nose, saying &#8220;Alas! The fire-god has come really in a form of this monkey! <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Some women crying and carrying their suckling&#8217;s</span> with their hair dishevelled, fell down from their houses, which were enveloped with fire, and shone like flashes of lightning falling from clouds in the sky. As the fire does not get satisfied with any amount of firewood and straw fed to it, Hanuma was not wearied in killing any number of demons. The earth was not then wearied in receiving the number of demons killed by Hanuma (in her lap).” Tr. K.M.K. Murthy</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">KALKI</span></strong></p>
<p>According to Hindu texts, Kalki avatar kills Shudra kings, Buddhists and heretics, he also plunders them,</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.58.76-83 &#8220;He will be called Pramiti. He was born of a part of Visnu formerly in the Svayambhuva Manvantara. He wandered over the earth for full twenty years. He led an army consisting of cavalry, chariots and elephants. He was surrounded by hundreds and thousands of Brahmanas armed with weapons. He killed Mlecchas in thousands. He went everywhere. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">After killing the kings born of Sudra women, he exterminated the heretics</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">He killed thousands of persons who were not religious and righteous. He killed those born of mixed castes as well as those who depended on them</span>. He killed the Udicyas (northerners), Madya Desyas (people of the Middle Land), mountain-dwellers, easterners, westerners, dwellers in Vindhya and Aparanta. He killed the southerners, Dravidas, Simhalas, Gandharas, Paradas, Pahlavas, Yavanas, Tusaras, Barbaras, Cinas, Sulikas, Daradas, Khasas, Lampakas, Ketas, and the different tribes of Kratas.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare, edited by G.P. Bhatt</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana 1.2.31.88-90 &#8220;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Annihilating every thing by his ruthless activity, he made only seeds to remain on the earth</span>. He managed to subdue the Vrsala who were generally sinful, by making them angry with one another on sudden provocations. Thereafter, in the region between the Ganga and the Yamuna, he established his camp of rest along with his followers. Thereafter, when the Kalpa elapsed, he went back to his eternal abode along with his army after exterminating Mleccha kings by thousands.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 144.51-59 &#8220;King Pramati of the Bhrigu family and Chandramasa gotra was born at the end of Svayambhuva Manu in the Sandhyamsa period, to inflict proper punishment on the sinners. That king travelled all over the earth for 30 years and collected arms and ammunitions, elephants, horses and chariots and marched with a vast army consisting of horses and elephants and accompanied by 100,00 Brahmana soldiers armed with various kinds of weapons, against the Mlecchas and destroyed them. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">After killing all the Sudra kings he annihilated all the hypocrites</span>. After destroying all the sinners and subduing the people living in the North, central regions, the mountaineers, the inhabitants in the East and West, the residents on the Vindhyas, the Deccanis, the Dravidians, the Singhalese, the inhabitants of the Mleccha countries (Kabul and Kandhara), the Paradas, the Pahlavas, the Yavanas, the Sakas, the Tusaras, the Svetas, the Pulindas, the Barbaras, the Khasas, the Lampakas, the Andhrakas, the Daradas, the Ifalikas, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">he exterminated the Sudras</span>. King Pramati was born of Visnu&#8217;s part in Manu&#8217;s family and was famous as Chandramasa.&#8221; Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>This is also mentioned in Brahmanda Purana 1.2.31.77-80 and Vayu Purana I.58.76-83 which I have mentioned in <a href="#intolerance-within-Hinduism" class="broken_link">Intolerance within caste and sects</a> category and it is also mentioned in Linga Purana Section I.40.50-56. It would have been comprehensible if the verse said that Kalki (Pramati) killed the sinners and wrongdoers but killing people born of mixed castes, and kings born to Shudra mothers is casteist. And saying that all people living in the north, south, east and west are all wrong doesn&#8217;t make any sense either, some of the tribes mentioned are traceable.</p>
<p>Kalki avatar annihilating humans and subduing low castes,</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana 2.3.73.111-116 &#8220;The lord Visnu who had been born in the previous birth as a powerful one, Pramiti by name, will be born in the Gotra of Candramas when the Kaliyuga is complete. Thus these ten incarnations of the lord are remembered. he accepts different wombs in the three worlds partially, adopting at different periods of time, different physical bodies, and different purposes for the manifestations. He will be born in the twenty-fifth Kalpa. For twenty-five years he will be exterminating the living beings and all human beings (?). With this cruel act, he will render the Earth left with only the seeds. He will subdue Vrsalas (low caste people) and almost those evil-doers. Thereafter, Kalki will become contented along with his army. Those who are not killed in this action, those who achieve something, will become deluded suddenly and fight with one another.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Do read Kalki Purana 13.39-44 and Kalki Purana 16.1 which I have already mentioned in this article in <a href="#kalki-buddhists" class="broken_link">Kalki avatar a murderer of Buddhists</a> category. Let me once against quote them for you,</p>
<p>Sri Kalki Purana 16.1 &#8220;Suta Gosvami said. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">After killing the Buddhists and mlecchas of Kikatapura, Lord Kalki took their wealth</span> and returned to His capital, along with His vast army&#8221; Tr. Bhumipati Das edited by Purnaprajna Das</p>
<p>Sri Kalki Purana 13.39-44 &#8220;Lord Kalki appeared to flourish, being surrounded by all these family members. Once, Lord Kalki&#8217;s father, Visnuyasa, who was on the level of Lord Brahma, decided to perform a horse sacrifice. Understanding the intention of His father, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Lord Kalki said: My dear father, I will go out and defeat all other kings in battle and thus bring you sufficient wealth</span> so that you can conduct the horse sacrifice properly. Lord Kalki, who was certainly capable of conquering all other kings, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">offered His obeisances to his father and then set out with his army to first conquer Kikatapura</span>…&#8221; Tr. Bhumipati Das edited by Purnaprajna Das</p>
<p>It proves that his primary aim was to plunder people. If you are conversant with Indian history you might be knowing that Kikata is present-day Bihar. And Bihar was once dominated by Buddhists, some historians even say that Bihar is the corrupted word for Vihar which means a Buddhist temple or monastery. Buddhism might have been the prevalent religion in Kikata (Bihar) when Kalki Purana was written so the composer wrote all these fairy tales keeping that in mind or else they may have written it based on the prediction of Kali Yuga in Hindu scriptures which says that people will become heretics (Jains, Buddhists). Also, these verses of plundering Kikata may have been inspired by the Vedic verses in which Vedic gods plunders Kikata tribe just because they didn&#8217;t offer any oblation to them.

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: initial; font-size: 12pt;">SHIVA</span></strong></p>
<p>Shiva burned up Tripura (Three cities) along with women and children. Tripura was a city inhabited by Asuras. Shiva with the help of other gods like Agni, Vishnu, Ashvinkumar, Yama, Kala, Ghandarvas, Brahma burned the city as well as its inhabitants. It&#8217;s not objectionable if Devas had killed combatant Asuras but they killed non-combatant Asuras along with their children and women. Your heart may tremble reading the following verses,</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 188.1 &#8220;Marakandeya said:- Hear from me, Yudhisthira! what you have asked me to explain. The spot on the banks of the Narmada where the Lord is enshrined is renowned as Mahesvara in all the three worlds and at the very same place He devised His plans of annihilating Tripura. [6-15] &#8230;In that way, Siva waited for thousands of years after making such preparations. When the three Puras (cities) fell in one line the Lord let out His arrow on Tripura when the inmates of Tripura became helpless and many kind of destructive omens occurred there&#8230;Then the wind Sambartaka that blows at the close of a cycle commenced&#8230;It produced fire on account of which the trees of Tripura began to crumble down. There was chaos everywhere. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">All the gardens were burnt down in an instant</span>&#8230;[25-40] <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The pleasure gardens smiling with lotus beds were also burnt down along with the swans and cranes</span>&#8230;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The fire of the Lord&#8217;s fury burnt down quite unsparingly several children, cows, birds, horses, women, and many people sleeping as well as awake</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The nymph like beauties of Tripura fell down burnt with their young ones hugged to their breasts.</span> Some ladies wearing garlands of pearl and gold fell down on the ground consumed by flames and suffocated by smoke. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Some beauties seeing their Lord lying on the ground jumped down from the upper storey of their mansion and were instantly eaten up by the flames</span>&#8230;Some ladies of the cloudy hue wearing garlands and armlets, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">some fair-complexioned beauties giving milk to their dear little ones were also consumed by fire</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Some ladies seeing their children eaten up by the fire sent forth shrilling wails</span>. Some ladies wearing diamond and emerald necklaces and shining like the moon <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">with their children in their lap, fell down on the ground after being charred</span>. Some moon faced beauties waking up from their sleep found their mansion on fire and began to <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">lament on realizing their children being burnt</span>. Some ladies adorned with golden ornaments fell down on the ground holding their consumed children in their arms&#8230; [41-48] Some overcome by the fury of the fire with their hands folded and uplifted began to pray as follows:- <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">&#8216;Agni! if thou art angry with the male population hostile to thee; what is the fault of the women confined in the houses like so many domesticated Kokilas pent up in cages</span>&#8230;[51-53]&#8230;Hearing such speech of the ladies the Agni said &#8216;I am not consuming you of my own will. I have been born to cause destruction. I have no mercy. I make my way everywhere freely through the glory of Siva&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Rudrasamhita 2, Yuddha Khanda 5.10.35 &#8220;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Other Asuraas too, children and old men were completely burnt out</span>, O Vyasa, at the bidding of Siva and speedily reduced to ashes. Just as the universe is burnt at the end of a Kalpa so also every thing and everyone there, whether woman or man or vehicles, was reduced to ashes by that fire.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Only those who worshipped Shiva and Ganesh were not burnt and all those who opposed God and whose activities were destructive (read not worshipping Shiva) were burnt including children, women and old people.</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 140.59-69 &#8220;The women folk in the amorous embraces of their lords in their residences and pleasure groves, were also reduced to ashes. No women could go away elsewhere. They were also consumed by fire in the company of their lords. Some of them cried out with folded hands and with tears in their eyes &#8216;O Agni! I am the wife of another; O Thou, the holy witness of all the things in the three worlds! You ought not to touch me. O Deva! my husband and myself are asleep; <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">I have not done any thing vicious and sinful</span>; therefore, go away by another path leaving my home with my beloved. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">One woman holding her infant stood, facing the fire and said &#8216;Agni! I have obtained this infant after great privations and it does not behove thee to burn this darling of mine</span></strong>&#8216;. Some of the women folk threw themselves into the waters of the ocean after forsaking their husbands. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Many of the women shivered under the destructive influence of fire and exclaimed with bewildering excitement, &#8216;O, father! O, husband! O, mother! O, maternal uncle! etc</span>. &#8216;As the heat emanating from the houses withers the lotuses springing in the ponds thereof, so consumed the fire at Tripura the lotus-like faces of those women along with their bodies&#8230;There was a great uproar when the women flew with their jingling ornaments and cried out in great consternation, on account of the fire produced form the destructive arrow of Siva.&#8221; Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>Other verses show that Devas were engaged in annihilating all of the Asuras, verses from Matsya Purana prove that, non-combatant Asuras including children, women and old people were also burned to death,</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 148.1-7 &#8220;Tarakasura said:- &#8216;Hearken, O, valiant Asuras! every one should direct his intelligence to his well being. Danavas! <span style="text-decoration: underline;">all the Devas are the annihilators of our race</span>. They are our ancient enemies. Our family religion is, therefore to establish firmly our eternal enmity with them. Today we shall certainly make a move to check the advance of the Devas and conquer them by the strength of our arms. But I do not consider it proper to fight with the Devas without practising austerities, I shall, therefore, first practise severe austerities; then we will conquer the Devas and enjoy the three worlds&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>The following verses describe the Tripura city,</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 140.53-57 &#8220;The arrow burnt the three cities as fire burns heaps of straw&#8230;The Tripura fort looked then like a good family brought to ruin by a wicked son. Afterwards, the houses of Tripura looking like the peaks of Sumera, Mandarachala and Kailasa, the beautiful places with gateways and perforated works and balconies, the pleasure rendezvous full of lovely ponds, the abodes of demons decorated with banners, buntings and wreaths of gold were eaten up by the thousand tongue fire.&#8221; Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>From the above verses as well as verses from Matsya Purana 188.1 we get to know that the Asuras were much more civilized than the Devas, the city of the enemies is described in such a beautiful manner. It shows the civilization of the Asuras who had lofty buildings, lovely palaces beautifully decorated with wreaths of gold, gardens with beautiful ponds, Asura women wearing necklaces of diamonds and gold, etc. After reading these things do you really think they were demons? A woman in this verse clearly says, &#8220;&#8216;Agni! if thou art angry with the male population hostile to thee; what is the fault of the women confined in the houses like so many domesticated Kokilas pent up in cages&#8221; But this didn&#8217;t stop cruel Agni from consuming them.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">INDRA</span></strong></p>
<p>Indra doesn&#8217;t deserve to be called a God. Even the most lecherous person&#8217;s actions on earth cannot be compared to the evils done by Indra. Indra lusted after other&#8217;s wives, raped women, committed adultery, consumed alcoholic drinks and even killed innocent people. Indra entered the womb of Diti and cut off the fetus into nine parts to kill the baby,</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Shiva Purana, Rudra Samhita 2, Parvati K</span><span style="color: #000000;">handa 3, Ch 14, verses </span><span style="color: #000000;">8-14 &#8221;My son Marici begot Kasyapa who married thirteen daughters of Daksa. The eldest of them Diti bore two sons: Hiranyakasipu the elder and Hiranyaksa the younger. When these two began to harass the gods, Visnu assumed the forms of Man lion and Boar and killed them. Then gods became fearless and happy. The distressed Diti sought refuge in Kasyapa and serving him with devotion and observing the sacred rites she conceived. On coming to know of it, </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Indra entered her womb forcibly and cut it off many a time with his thunderbolt</span><span style="color: #000000;">. By the power of her sacred rites, the child in the womb did not die as she was sleeping at that time, by a stroke of good luck. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">They were cut into seven pieces and so she had seven sons. These sons became gods by the name of Maruts</span><span style="color: #000000;">.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">This is also mentioned in Vayu Purana 6.102-3; Agni Purana 19.19-20; Valmiki Ramayana Bala Kandam 1.46 and as per Brahmanda Purana 2.3.5.68 Indra entered the belly through the vaginal passage. I am posting the summary of this story by Desi Raju Hanumanth Rao so you can understand the context,</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Diti seeks for a son to kill Indra because Indra and other gods have killed her sons in the battle after churning Milk Ocean. But Indra, being her stepson arrives at her place of asceticism, with view to destroy that Indra-killer. On a fateful day when Diti failed to maintain the procedure of vow, Indra enters her womb and dissects the foetus into seven fragments, which later become sapta marut gaNa-s, The Seven Wind-gods.&#8221;</p>
<p>Indra killed a Muni Trisira/Vishwarupa who was meditating,</p>
<p>Srimad Devi Bhagavatam 6.2.1-11. &#8220;Vyâsa said:- The extremely covetous Indra, then, mounted on his Airâvata elephant and determined to kill the Muni. He went to him and saw him immersed in deep Samâdhi, firmly seated in his posture and with his speech controlled. At that time, a halo of light emanated from his body and he looked like a second Sun and a blazing fire. Indra became very sad and dejected when he saw that. Indra then thought within himself thus :&#8211; &#8220;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Oh! Can I slay this Muni, free from any vicious inclinations, and endowed with the power of Tapas, blazing like a fire</span>! This is quite against the Dharma. But, Alas! He wants to usurp my position; how can I, then, neglect such an enemy?&#8221; Thus cogitating, Indra hurled at the Muni his swift going, infallible thunderbolt, the Muni remaining engaged in his penance and shining like the Sun and Moon. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The ascetic, struck </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">thus, fell on the ground and died</span>, like a mountain peak struck by thunder falling on the ground and presenting a wondrous sight. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Indra became very glad when he killed the Muni</span>…&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Also mentioned in Mahabharata Udyog Parva 5, section 9; Satapatha Brahmana 1.6.3.1-2. Muni Trisira/Vishwarupa had three heads for which he was called Trisira. He dedicated one head to the recitation of Vedas, one head for eating and one for observing the surroundings. Indra was afraid that Muni Trisira/Vishwarupa may replace Indra from his Indraship due to the rigid penance. So at first, he sent several Apsaras like Urvashi, Menaka, Rambha, Ghritachi and Tilottama who tried to interrupt Muni Trisira&#8217;s penance by singing and dancing in front of him and even seducing him but in vain. So at last Indra decided to kill him. But even after killing Muni Trisira with a thunderbolt, Indra thought that Trisira was alive so he asked a woodcutter named Taksa to cut off the heads of the Muni with his axe,</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Srimad </span><span style="color: #000000;">Devi Bhagavatam 6.2.1-14. &#8220;…Indra, then, went back soon to his own abode; on the other hand, the high-souled Muni, though killed, looked as it were, living by the lustre of his own body. </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Indra, then, seeing him lying like a living man thought that the Muni might get alive and so became very sad</span><span style="color: #000000;">. While he was thus arguing in his mind, he saw before him a wood cutter named Taksa and began to speak to him for his own selfish ends thus &#8220;</span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">O Artisan! Cut all the heads of this Muni and keep my word; this highly lustrous Muni is looking as it were alive; therefore, if you sever his heads</span><span style="color: #000000;">, he cannot be alive.&#8221; Taksa then cursed him and spoke thus. &#8220;O King of the Devas! The neck of this Muni is very big and therefore cannot be severed; my axe is not at all fit for this work. Specially I cannot do such a blameable act. You have done a very heinous crime, quite against the law of the good persons; I fear sin; I will not be able to cut the heads of a dead man. This Muni is lying dead; what use is there in severing his head again? O Pâkas&#8217;âsana! The killer of the demon Pâka! Why do you fear in this?&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The woodcutter was first reluctant but Indra convinced him and lured him with a share in </span><span style="color: #000000;">the </span><span style="color: #000000;">sacrifice and then the woodcutter cut off three heads of Trisira,</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Srimad </span><span style="color: #000000;">Devi Bhagavatam 6.2.21 &#8220;</span>Vyâsa said:&#8211; O King! That Tak<span style="text-decoration: underline;">s</span>â became very glad when he heard thus from Indra and struck off the heads of the Muni with his very strong axe.&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">So Vishwakarma the father of Trisira created a son Vritra to avenge the death of his son,</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Srimad </span><span style="color: #000000;">Devi Bhagavatam 6.2.21-53 &#8220;When Vis&#8217;vakarmâ heard that his virtuous son had been killed, he became very angry (in his mind) and </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">said that as Indra had killed his qualified son engaged in asceticism without any offence, he would create another son to kill Indra.</span> <span style="color: #000000;">Let the Devas see his strength and power of Tapasyâ and let Indra, too, reap the far-reaching effects of his own Karma. Thus saying, Vis&#8217;vakarmâ distressed with anger, offered oblations in the sacrificial Fire, reciting Mantram from the Atharvan Vedas, with the object of producing a son. When Homa was performed for eight nights consecutively, a man quickly came out of that burning fire, as if he was the Incarnate of Fire itself…Father! Of what avail is that to his father when he is not able to remove his sorrows!&#8221; O Father! Shall I drink the ocean or crumble the mountains to dust or shall I obstruct the passage of the rising Sun or shall I kill </span><span style="color: #000000;">Indra, Yama, or the other host of Devas or shall I root out the earth and throw it with all beings into the ocean?&#8221; </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">O King! Hearing thus the sweet words of his son, Vis&#8217;vakarmâ gladly told his mountain-like son &#8220;</span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">O my Son! You are capable to save me from troubles (Vrijina) hence you are named Vritra</span><span style="color: #000000;">. O highly Fortunate One! Your brother, named Tris&#8217;irâ, was a gre</span>at ascetic; his three faces were all very strong. He was thoroughly conversant with the Vedas and the Vedangâs and well versed in all the other knowledges. He remained always engaged in practising asceticism, surprising to the three worlds. Indra killed my qualified son with his thunderbolt; that wicked soul severed the three heads without any offence. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Therefore, O Best of beings! Kill that vicious, shameless, deceitful, wicked Indra</span> guilty of the sin of Brahmahattyâ…&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Indra slaying Vritra is praised in Vedas and many Puranas also. But in the Vedas, it is in metaphor. Wherein Indra means Sun and Vritra means cloud. It could be possible that Vedic verses were composed praising the killing of Vritra by Indra. Vritra was born to avenge the murder of his brother and still, Indra is praised in Vedas. But Vritra seems to be a kind-hearted man who entered into a truce with Indra. But the vicious Indra decided to kill him in a deceitful way. Indra sent Rambha to seduce Vritra so that he may be distracted and that will help Indra to kill Vritra. Indra&#8217;s plan was successful, Vritra fell into this trap and was killed with Indra&#8217;s thunderbolt. The following verse shows that they had entered into a truce,</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Srimad </span><span style="color: #000000;">Devi Bhagavatam 6.1.1-12 &#8220;…</span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The powerful Vritra entered into a treaty and kept himself</span><span style="color: #000000;"> peaceful when Indra and Visnu violated truth and treacherously killed him by Jalaphena (the watery foams)&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Rig Veda and Mahabharata show that Indra sought the help of Vishnu who advised him to befriend Vritra and thus making it easier for Indra to kill Vritra,</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Rig Veda 6.20.2 Even as the power of Dyaus, to thee, O Indra, all Asura sway was by the Gods entrusted, When thou, Impetuous! </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">leagued with Viṣṇu, slewest Vṛtra</span><span style="color: #000000;"> the Dragon who enclosed the waters. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Mahabharata 5.10</span><span style="color: #000000;">.1-43</span><span style="color: #000000;"> &#8220;Indra said, This whole indestructible universe, O gods, hath been pervaded by Vritra. There is nothing that can be equal to the task of opposing him. I was capable of yore, but now I am incapable. What good betide you, can I do? I believe him to be unapproachable. Powerful and magnanimous, possessing immeasurable strength in fight, he would be able to swallow up all the three worlds with the gods, the Asuras, and the men. Therefore, hear ye dwellers of heaven, this is my resolution. Proceeding to the abode of Vishnu, in company with that high-souled Being must we consult, and ascertain the means of slaying this ruthless wretch.&#8217; &#8220;Salya continued, &#8216;Indra having thus spoken, the gods with that host of Rishis repaired to the mighty god Vishnu to place themselves under the-protection of that protector of all. And afflicted with the dread of Vritra, they said unto the Supreme Lord of the deities. Thou hadst in former times covered the three worlds with three steps. Thou hadst procured the ambrosial food, O Vishnu, and destroyed the Asuras in battle. Thou didst bind the great Asura Vali and hadst raised Indra to the throne of heaven. Thou art the lord of the gods, and this entire universe is pervaded by thee. Thou art the God, the mighty Deity, saluted by all persons. Be thou the refuge of all the celestials </span><span style="color: #000000;">together with Indra, O best of gods. The whole universe, O slayer of Asuras, hath been pervaded by Vritra. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">And Vishnu said, &#8216;I am no doubt bound to do what is for your good</span><span style="color: #000000;">. I shall, therefore, tell you of a contrivance whereby he may be annihilated. </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Do ye with the Rishis and the Gandharvas repair to the place where Vritra that bearer of a universal form is and adopt towards him a conciliatory policy</span><span style="color: #000000;">.</span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;"> You will thus succeed in overthrowing him</span><span style="color: #000000;">. By virtue of my power, victory, ye gods, will be won by Indra, for, remaining invisible, I shall enter into his thunderbolt, that best of weapons. O foremost of gods, depart ye with the Rishis and the Gandharvas. Let there be no delay in effecting a peace between Indra and Vritra.&#8217;&#8230;If I do not kill Vritra, this great and mighty Asura of gigantic frame, </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">even by deceit</span><span style="color: #000000;">, it will not go well with me.&#8217; And as Indra thought of all this, bearing Vishnu in mind he beheld at that instant in the sea a mass of froth as large as a hill. And he said, &#8216;This is neither dry, nor wet, nor is it a weapon; let me hurl it at Vritra. Without doubt, he will die immediately.&#8217; And he threw at Vritra that mass of froth blended with the thunderbolt. </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">And Vishnu, having entered within that froth, put an end to the life of Vritra</span><span style="color: #000000;">. And when Vritra was killed, the cardinal points were free from gloom; and there also blew a pleasant breeze; and all beings were much pleased&#8230;&#8221; Tr. K.M. Ganguli</span></p>
<p>The following verses from Padma Purana have a slightly different version that exhibits how Indra killed him,</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Padma Purana II.24.34-43 &#8220;</span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">He thought of a stratagem to kill him. He sent Rambha (after telling her:) &#8221;With this or that trick, delude the great demon</span><span style="color: #000000;">. O auspicious one, do that to delude the great demon, so that by killing him I shall get happiness.&#8221;&#8230;[44b-51] very wise Vrtra, confiding (in Indra) in all matters, and knowing Indra to be a great friend, was not afraid of him. Moving (i.e. he moved) in the great auspicious forest&#8230;Vrtra, having come there, saw that Rambha, with charming, large eyes with his mind full of sexual desire.&#8221; Tr. N.A. Deshpande</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Padma Purana II.25.11-20 &#8220;[Vrtra said] O you beautiful lady, I have sought your shelter. Protect me form the (disturbance caused by) sexual desire. O you of large eyes, resort to me, who am, O dear one, distressed by sexual desire. Rambha said: There is no doubt that today I shall submit myself to you; O hero, you should do whatever I tell you to do&#8230;Having thus established a relation with her, the very powerful best demon enjoyed in that very meritorious forest. The great demon was very much stupefied by her singing, dancing, charming smile and sexual intercourse (with her). She said to that noble and best demon: &#8216;(Please) drink wine; (please) drink madhu-madhavi (a kind of intoxicating drink)&#8230; </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #000000;">But that respectable lady Rambha lovingly gave wine to him against his will</span><span style="color: #000000;">. Due to civility for her he drink wine at that time. </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">When he was extremely stupefied by the wine, and lost his senses, just then Indra struck him with his thunderbolt</span><span style="color: #000000;">. Then that killer of Vrtra (i.e. Indra) was tainted with such sins as killing a brahmana.&#8221; Tr. N.A. Deshpande</span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s mentioned in Shastra that Indra gave part of the Brahmin-slaughter sin to women,</p>
<p>Vasistha Dharma Shastra 5.7. For it has been declared in the Veda, &#8216;When Indra had slain (Vritra) the three-headed son of Tvashtri, he was seized by Sin, and he considered himself to be tainted with exceedingly great guilt. All beings cried out against him (saying to him), &#8216;O thou slayer of a learned Brâhmana! O thou slayer of a learned Brâhmana!&#8217; <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">He ran to the </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">women for protection (and said to them), &#8216;Take upon yourselves the third part of this my guilt (caused by) the murder of a learned Brâhmana</span>.&#8217; They answered, &#8221;What shall we have (for doing thy wish)?&#8217; He replied, &#8216;Choose a boon.&#8217; They said, &#8216;Let us obtain offspring (if our husbands approach us) during the proper season, at pleasure let us dwell (with our husbands until (our children) are born.&#8217; He answered, &#8216;So be it.&#8217; (Then) they took upon themselves (the third part of his guilt). <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">That guilt of Brâhmana-murder appears every month as the menstrual flow</span>. Therefore let him not eat the food of a woman in her courses; (for) such a one has put on the shape of the guilt of Brâhmana-murder.</p>
<p>Violating treaties was no big deal for Indra. A demon named Namuchi had entered into a peace treaty with Indra for fear of being killed. But Indra violated the treaty and killed him,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 8.14.13 13 With waters&#8217; foam thou torest off, Indra, the head of Namuci, Subduing all contending hosts.</p>
<p>Mahabharata 9.43.32-46 &#8220;Vaishampayana said, &#8220;Listen to that history, O ruler of men! Hear of those occurrences as they happened! Hear how Vasava, in days of yore, broke his treaty with Namuchi! The Asura Namuchi, from fear of Vasava, had entered a ray of the Sun. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Indra then made friends with Namuchi and entered into a covenant with him</span>, saying, &#8216;O foremost of Asuras, I shall not slay thee, O friend, with anything that is wet or with anything that is dry! I shall not slay thee in the night or in the day! I swear this to thee by truth. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Having made this covenant, the lord Indra one day beheld a fog. He then, O king, cut off Namuchi&#8217;s head, using the foam of water (as his weapon). </span>The severed head of Namuchi thereupon pursued Indra from behind, saying unto him from a near point these words, &#8216;O slayer of a friend, O wretch!&#8217; Urged on incessantly by that head, Indra repaired to the Grandsire and informed him, in grief, of what had occurred. The Supreme Lord of the universe said unto him, &#8216;Performing a sacrifice, bathe with due rites, O chief of the celestials, in Aruna, that tirtha which saveth from the fear of sin!&#8221; Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Indra and Namuchi having entered into a peace treaty and Indra violating it and killing Namuchi is also mentioned in Panchavimsha Brahmana 12.6.8-9. Mahabharata and Panchavimsha Brahmana has the same version of the story which makes it authentic but there is another version mentioned in Brahma Purana which says that Indra fled the battlefield and Namuchi chased him and he was killed there,</p>
<p>Brahma Purana: Gautami-Mahatmya 54.33-40 &#8220;Brahma said: Formerly, there was a very powerful leader of Daityas named Namuci. His enmity towards Indra was terrible. It caused hairs to stand on end. Once Namuci, the heroic leader of Daityas, saw Indra abandoning the battle and going off. Then he pursued him. On seeing him coming <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Indra became overwhelmed with fear</span>. Leaving off Airavata, Indra entered the foam of water. The thunderbolt-armed Indra instantly killed his enemy through the foam&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Rishi Mandavya</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">A Brahmin couple was traveling during the night, due to the ailment of the husband, the wife named Sandili carried her husband, due to exhaustion and darkness, she faltered and fell on a pole or Trishul on which a Rishi named Mandavya was performing penance, he was hurt by that so he cursed Kaushik to die when the sun rises. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">Skanda Purana, Avantya Khanda 5, Reva Khanda 3, chapter 171, verses 40-54 &#8220;When those leading Brahmanas went out of sight, the female ascetic Sandili came there on the second day. She was carrying her husband on her head and wandering about at night. She did not see the sage (Mandavya). O Yudhisthira, she was staggering due to the excess of burden. The Brahmana on the stake was not noticed by her. The chaste lady faltered and slipped down against the knees of the Brahmana on the stake. Due to the fall of the faltering lady much pain was caused to the sage&#8230;The sages said: Moving about at will, you appear to be unaware of other people&#8217;s distress and pain. In the morning as soon as the sun rises your husband will die. O low-born woman, only your own misery you know and not that of any other person. Sandili became chagrined at those terrible words.

<h3><a id="war-tactics"></a>War tactics and courage of Hindu gods</h3>
<p>Hindu gods are depicted as brave warriors but these brave warriors were sometimes scared of their enemies and even fled the battlefield. Being gods they also used war tactics same as human beings do. The following verses show how Vishnu, Shiva and Brahma were defeated by a Danava and they fled in fear,</p>
<p>Srimad Devi Bhagavatam 5.7.4-11. &#8220;Seeing the Dânava, Vâsudeva Hari raised his discus in anger and attacked him with great force to kill him. Just when Hari struck the Dânava violently with his Chakra, the powerful Dânava quitted immediately his lion-form, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">assumed the buffalo form and struck Hari with his two horns. Vâsudeva, thus pierced in his breast with the horns, became confounded and fled away</span> as best as he could till he reached his own abode, Vaikuntha. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Seeing Hari thus fleeing away, S&#8217;ankara, too, thought him invulnerable and fled to his Kailâs&#8217;a mountain with fear. Brahmâ, too, fled to his own abode with terror</span>; but the powerful Vâsava took patience and remained steady in the battle. Varuna taking his S&#8217;akti waited patiently for battle. Yama, too, with his staff remained there ready to fight. Kuvera, the Lord of the Yaksas, remained very busy in close fighting with the Dânavas; Fire, taking S&#8217;akti, also waited. The Sun and Moon, the Lord of the stars, both remained in firm resolve to fight with Mahisa, the lord of the Dânavas&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Rama killing Bali.</p>
<p>Rama killed Bali while Bali was busy fighting Hanuman. That too Rama shot an arrow by hiding behind a tree. Rama killing Bali is mentioned in Valmiki Ramayana, Kishkindha Kanda, Ch 16.</p>
<p>Krishna and Balrama vs Yavana army,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 10.52.5-8 &#8220;The Lord again returned to the city of Mathura which was still besieged by the Yavana army. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">He annihilated the Yavana army and carried of their wealth as spoils to Dvaraka</span>. While the wealth was being transported on the backs of men and oxen under the direction of the Imperishable Lord, Jarasandha, commanding an army of twentythree aksauhinis arrived on the scence. Observing their violent onrush of inimical forced, Balarama and Krsna, the descendants of Madhu <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">adopted the human way of life and quickly began to run, Oh king. Though dauntless, they left the vast treasure (the spoils from the Yavana army) and similating terrified cowards, they ran for many yojanas on foot</span>, tender like lotuspetals.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 10.52.10-12 &#8220;Apparently exhausted after fleeing a long distance, the two Lords climbed a high mountain named Pravarṣaṇa, upon which Lord Indra showers incessant rain. Although he knew They were hiding on the mountain, Jarāsandha could find no trace of Them. Therefore, O King, he placed firewood on all sides and set the mountain ablaze. The two of Them then suddenly jumped from the burning mountain, which was eleven yojanas high, and fell to the ground.&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Vishnu beheads the demons by assuming the form of a woman,</p>
<p>Agni Purana 3.11-15 &#8220;Taking ambrosia from his hands the Daityas gave half of it to the gods and went away with the other half. Vishnu, the root of creation, then assumed the form of a (beautiful) damsel. Beholding her endued with beauty, the Daityas, overcome with fascination, said &#8216;Be our wife, take this ambrosia, O fair one and make us partake of it.&#8217; Saying &#8216;So be it&#8217; Hari took it from them and made the celestials drink of it. Assuming the form of the moon Rahu drank up the portion offered to the sun and moon and therefore his head was severed off his head by his enemy Hari. He then said to Hari, the giver of boon. &#8216;By thy mercy I have attained immortality.&#8221; Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>

<h3><a id="enemy"></a>Mercilessly killing the enemy</h3>
<p>Hindu gods mercilessly killed their enemies. They beheaded them, peeled out the skin, cut off all the limbs, cut them into pieces, burned them, etc.</p>
<p>Srimad Devi Bhagavatam 5.26.62-65 &#8220;Vyâsa said:&#8211; O King! Hearing thus the words of Ambikâ, Kâlikâ spoke to Her again:&#8211; &#8220;In this war-sacrifice there is this axe which is like a sacrificial post; I will offer these two as victims to Thy sacrifice. Thus no act of envy will be committed (i.e., killing in a sacrifice is not considered as envy).&#8221; Thus saying, the Kâlikâ Devî cut off their heads with great force and gladly drank their blood. Thus seeing the two Asuras killed, Ambikâ said gladly:&#8211; Thou hast done the service to the gods; so I will give Thee an excellent boon. O Kâlikâ! As Thou hast killed Chanda and Munda, henceforth Thou wilt be renowned in this world as Châmundâ.&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Agni Purana 234.8-16 &#8220;Now I shall describe the measures of illusion to be practised by a king in frightening away the hearts of a hostile army, to show that the God is on the side of his countrymen&#8230;Similarly the quarters of the enemy should be denuded with showers of simulated blood, and a similar severed head of the adversary should be exhibited at the terrace of the palace.&#8221; Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 8.10.57 &#8220;Thereafter, two very powerful demons named Mālī and Sumālī were killed by the Supreme Lord, who severed their heads with His disc. Then Mālyavān, another demon, attacked the Lord. With his sharp club, the demon, who was roaring like a lion, attacked Garuḍa, the lord of the birds, who are born from eggs. But the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the original person, used His disc to cut off the head of that enemy also.&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Srimad Devi Bhagavatam 5.14.40-56 &#8220;…Mahâ Mâyâ then, became very angry and began to hurl arrows after arrows so incessantly that all the armours of all the Dânavas became pierced and were cut down to pieces…&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>

<h2><a id="fighting-eachother"></a>Gods fighting each other</h2>
<p>Other than killing innocent people, Hindu gods were also engaged in fighting each other. Several questions arise when reading stories of gods fighting each other. Which god is right when two gods fight each other? Are Hindu gods so stupid not to understand right and wrong that they have to become physical with each other? What example are they leaving for human beings by fighting with each other? Can&#8217;t Hindu gods forgive the other to give an example to their creation? Or can&#8217;t they settle the matter through talks?</p>

<p>Brahma Purana 35.11 &#8220;Obeisance to one who annhilated the god of Death&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Jagdish Lal Shastri writes, &#8220;Annihilated the god of death. Siva gave Mrkandu a boon that a pious son would be born to him but he would live only for sixteen years. The child was born and named Markandeya. He was educated in Vedas and Sastras. When the hour of his death arrived, the boy embraced the linga idol of Siva. When Yama, the god of death came to fetch him, the angry Siva arose out of the idol and killed Yama. At the request of gods Yama was revived to life but Markandeya was granted youth for ever.&#8221;</p>
<p>Brahma Purana: Gautami-Mahatmya 24.9-21 &#8220;Brahma said: Then Mrtyu with the noose in his hand entered the place where that brahmin was worshipping Siva. The brahmin was not at all aware of either Yama&#8217;s servants or Mrtyu himself&#8230;Then Mrtyu thew up the noose against Sveta. O great sages, Nandin then became angry. Nandin hit Mrtyu with the baton given by Siva. Mrtyu fell on the ground. Then the messengers saw that Mrtyu was struck down. They intimated the incident to Yama. Then Dharma whose vehicle is buffalo and who controls all addressed his attendants and associates&#8230;&#8217;Hurry up, hurry up&#8217;, said Yama to them and himself proceeded ahead, surrounded by these and others, to the place where Sveta the excellent brahmin was worshipping Siva&#8230;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Karttikeya pierced the servants of Yama by means of his javelin.

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SHIVA&#8217;S VIRABHADRA VS GODS</span></strong></p>
<p>Daksha organized a Yajna and invited all gods and sages except for his son in law Shiva and spoke ill of Shiva. So Shiva&#8217;s wife asks him to destroy the sacrifice of Daksha. On being requested Shiva creates a form called Virabhadra. Virabhadra then goes to the place and destroys everything, kicks and beats up the sages, paralyses some Devas and kills some, cuts off Agni&#8217;s tongue, plucks out eyes of Bhaga and does many more violent things and finally beheads Daksha,</p>
<p>Kurma Purana I.15.35-42 &#8220;Sri Devi said: O Sankara, Daksa who had been my father in the previous birth is performing a Yajna after censuring your status and your own self&#8230;Please destroy that sacrifice immediately&#8230;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Thus implored by the goddess, the great Lord, the Lord of Devas, created Rudra immediately with a desire to destroy the Yajna of Daksa</span>. He was highly infuriated. He had a thousand heads, a thousand eyes and huge arms, a thousand in number. He was invincible. He resembled the fire at the close of the Yugas. He was terrible due to his curved fangs. He could not be seen (directly) due to his glaring brilliance. He held a conch and a discus. He had a staff in his hand. He roared loudly. He held a horn in his hand and was beautified with Bhasma (ashes). <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">He became famous as Virabhadra</span>&#8230;Siva spoke to him thus: &#8216;O Ganesvara (leader of the attendants). Blessings unto you. After censuring me, Daksa is performing a Yajna, at Gangadvara, (near the source of the river Ganga). Destroy that sacrifice of Daksa.&#8217; <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Then the sacrifice of Daksa was destroyed by Virabhadra playfully like a single lion released from bondage</span>&#8230; [59b-67a] The leaders of Ganas became infuriated. They uprooted the sacrificial posts and threw them here and there. The Ganesvaras, all of whom were terrible ones, took the sacrificial horse along with the Prastotr and Hotr (the priests) and hurled them into the currents of Ganga. Even <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Virabhadra whose mind was ablaze with wrath, paralysed the hand of Indra</span> as he raised it to strike and did the same to other gods. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Sportively he plucked out the eyes of Bhaga by the tip of his finger nails. Hitting with his fist he felled down the teeth of Pusan</span>. The mighty leader of Ganas sportively and smilingly kicked Lord Moon with the big toe of his leg. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">O excellent sages, he cut off the pair of hands of fire and playfully plucked out his tongue</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Then he kicked sages on their heads. The mighty one then pierced Visnu, who had been coming thither on his Garuda with sharp arrows after stunning Sudarsana</span>. The powerful Garuda stared at the Gana and suddenly hit him with his wings and roared like the ocean.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Also mentioned in Linga Purana Section I, 82.98-103; Varaha Purana chapter 21. After Daksha was beheaded a goat&#8217;s head was fixed and was resurrected as mentioned in Devi Bhagavatam 7.30.39-50, as per Linga Purana Section I.82.98-103 Saraswati&#8217;s lips and nose were also cut off. This story mentioned in Linga Purana is more violent,</p>
<p>Linga Purana Section I.100.15-19 &#8220;&#8230;Virabhadra of great splendour and undistressed soul made the hands of Indra and other Devas stunned as they raised them. He uprooted the eyes of Bhaga sportively with the tip of his finger. With his fist he hit the teeth of Pusan and made them fall. He kicked the moon with the toe of his foot. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">He cut off the head of lord Indra. After cutting off the hands of Agni and after uprooting his tongue</span> sportively he kicked him on his head with his leg. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">He cut off the staff of Yama</span>. He hit lord Isana a guardian of the quarters of great strength by means of his trident. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Without any difficulty he killed thirty three Devas thus</span>. Sportingly he killed three thousand three hundred and thirty three Devas along with the three leading Devas. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">He killed the leading sages too</span>. This lord killed those Devas who stood in readiness for fighting. Lord Rudra hit them with his fist, swords, arrows and other things. Then Visnu of great splendour and intensified strength lifted up his discus, and fought with Rudra. A terrible fight ensured between them. It made hairs to stand on end.&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Rudra Samhita 2, Satikhanda Section 2.1.32-34 &#8220;They worked a great havoc there. Virabhadra chastised everyone and spared none. After defeating Visnu and the Devas with strenuous effort, the chief of Ganas cut off the head of Daksa and consigned it to the sacrificial fire. Working great havoc he destroyed the sacrifice. Then he came back to the mountain and bowed to Lord Siva&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>There is another story that may talk about a different event but it looks like it&#8217;s about this same event,</p>
<p>Skanda Purana V.ii.64.19b-25 &#8220;The share of Sambhu was not appropriated by Brahma in his sacrifice. Mahadeva is the annihilator of the universe. (But,) O king, he (too) was deluded by his sense-organs and he became angry with Suras (Devas). The Suras are the Vibhutis (empowered parts) of Siva. All the three worlds are solely intended for his sport. Yet, by him the bow was strung well for the sake of a share! The teeth of Pusan were shattered. Divakara (the Sun) was made unconscious. The eyes of Bhaga were plucked and the god of Yajna in the form of an antelope was hit. The Devas turned into Pasus (animals). The sages were denied the Vedas. The Dharmasastras of the sages were taken away by the all powerful Lord&#8230;&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SHIVA VS GANESHA</span></strong></p>
<p>Shiva Purana Rudrasamhita 2, Kumara Khanda IV.13.15-20 &#8220;Once when Parvati was taking her bath, Sadasiva rebuked Nandin and came into the inner apartment. The mother of the universe, seeing the untimely arrival of Siva in the midst of her bath and toilet stood up. The beautiful lady was very shy then&#8230;At the time when the incident occurred, Parvati, the great Maya, the great goddess, thought as follows. &#8216;There must be a servant of my own who will be expert in his duties. He must not stray from my behest even a speck.&#8217; Thinking thus the goddess created a person with all the characteristics, out of the dirt from her body. [30-37] Thus placing her son at the doorway, Parvati began to take bath with her friends, unworried. O excellent sage, at this very moment Siva who is eagerly indulgent and an expert in various divine sports came near the door. Not knowing that he was lord Siva, the consort of Parvati, Ganesa said &#8216;O sir, without my mother&#8217;s permission you shall not go in now. My mother has entered the bath. Where are you going now? Go away&#8217; saying thus, he took up his staff to ward him off. On seeing him Siva said &#8216;O foolish fellow, whom are you forbidding? O wicked knave, don&#8217;t you know me? I am Siva, none else&#8217;. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Thereupon Ganesa beat Siva with the staff</span>. Siva expert in various sports became infuriated&#8230;When lord Siva tried to enter the house, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Ganesa became infuriated, O brahmin, and struck him with his staff once again</span>.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Shiva Purana Rudra Samhita 4, Kumarakhanda IV, 16.7-8 O sage, after fighting for a long time along with the army and seeing him terrific, even Siva was greatly surprised. Thinking withing himself &#8221;He has to be killed only by deception and not otherwise&#8221; he stayed in the midst of the army. [11-12] Then Ganesa the heoioc son of Sakti following the course of heroes, at first worshipped (i.e., struck) Visnu with his staff, Visnu who confers happiness to all. &#8221;I shall cause him delusion. Then let him be killed by you, O lord. Without deception he cannot be killed. He is of Tamasika nature and inaccessible.&#8221; [29-35] After remembering the lotus like feet of Siva, Visnu took up his discus and split the iron club by means of discus. Ganesa hurled the piece of iron club at Visnu which was caught by the bird Garuda and rendered futile. Thus for a long time the two heroes Visnu and Ganesa fought with each other. Again the foremost among heroes, the son of Parvati took up his staff of unrivalled power remembering Siva and struck Visnu with it. Struck with that unbearable blow he fell on the ground. But he got up, quickly and fought with Parvati&#8217;s son. Securing this opportunity, </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">the Trident-bearing deity came there and cut off his head with his trident</span><span style="color: #000000;">. O Narada, when the head of Ganesa was cut off, the armies of the gods and the Ganas stood still.&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">What kind of gods are these? One (Ganesha) doesn&#8217;t know his own father, the other (Shiva) who is considered The destroyer couldn&#8217;t kill Ganesha, so with the help of Vishnu he beheads a child that too by using deception.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #000000;">SHIVA VS BRAHMA</span></strong></p>
<p>Varaha Purana 97.1-7 &#8220;Varaha said: O Earth, now listen to the origin of Rudra Vrata, by knowing which one gets freed from all sins. The red-eyed and tawny coloured Rudra who was created by Brahma in his third birth, was borne by him in pleasure on his shoulder. When he was thus on the shoulder, the fifth head of Brahma told Rudra the Atharvan mantra by which release is obtained. &#8216;O Kapalin, Rudra, Babhru, Bhava, Kairata, Suvrata, my valiant and broad-eyed son, do protect this world&#8217;. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">When Rudra was thus addressed by the names which he would be getting in future he was angry at the word &#8216;Kapala&#8217; used and clipped off that (fifth) head</span>. The head was clipped off by the nail in the left thumb, but it got to the hand.&#8221; Tr. Venkitasubramonia Iyer, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>All Puranas are unanimous that Shiva beheaded Brahma but there is variation as to why he beheaded him, above verses say that Shiva was infuriated when Brahma called him Kapala but Kurma Purana II.31.1-32 says that Brahma and Shiva were quarreling over supremacy and Shiva found Brahma arrogant so he in anger cut off the head of Brahma. There are a few other versions. Shiva beheading Brahma is also mentioned in Skanda Purana V.iii.173.1-5; Brahma Purana: Gautami-Mahatmya 43.19-23; Shiva Purana, Vayaviyasamhita 6, Section I, 30.19</p>
<p>There is a story in Shiva Purana which says that Shiva was going to kill Brahma because Brahma watched his wife lustfully and even discharged semen,</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Rudrasamhita 2, Satikhanda 2.19.43- &#8220;Lord Siva said:- O patriarch Daksa what has just been requested by Visnu my great devotee and agreed to by me shall be done here. &#8216;O lord, whoever stares at Sati lustfully shall be killed by you.&#8217; I Shall make these words of Visnu true by killing Brahma. Why did Brahma stare at Sati lustfully? Moreover he has committed a sin by discharging his semen. Hence I shall kill him.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Brahma begs for mercy and at last, Vishnu acts as a mediator and pacifies Shiva and urges him not to kill Brahma and Shiva agrees. Another version of the story is mentioned in Vamana Purana,</p>
<p>Vamana Purana 2.35-37 &#8220;Discerning forthwith the faces resembling the Sun, the face of Brahman remarked thus, &#8216;Bubbles are formed when water is disturbed, Is there any valour in them&#8217;? The great Sankara who was enraged to hear this severed with the tip of his nail the head of Brahman which had spoken to him rudely. Thus chopped, the head fell on the left paml of Sankara himself and never dropped down from his hand.&#8221; Tr. Anand Swarup Gupta</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SHIVA VS AURVA</span></strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s not actually a fight. Shiva burns up the hermitage of sage Aurva for which Aurva curses him.</p>
<p>Varaha Purana 147.9-14 &#8220;Then in that famous tirtha known as Goniskramana, lord Siva came near him. Aurva was then going to the river Ganga to gather lotus flowers. Knowing him thus out of the hermitage, Siva entered it. It was auspicios, beautiful and full of fruits and flowers. But it was soon reduced to ashes by the heat of the halo of Siva. After burning that hermitage, Siva quickly returned to (his abdode in) the Himalayas. [19-] From that moment Siva, although he is the lord of the world, began to be tormented by great heat, and he told Parvati: &#8216;Seeing the penance of Aurva, the gods were afraid and they told me: &#8216;The heat of the penance of this Aurva affects the whole world. But he does not desire anything. How can we remedy thiss?&#8217; When told thus, I caste my eye on his hermitage. In a moment it was burnt down, and we returned. Being sorry and angry at this, Aurva cursed me, and that has resulted in this torment of mine.&#8221; Tr. Venkitasubramonia Iyer, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">KRISHNA VS SHIVA</span></strong></p>
<p>Aniruddh the grandson of Krishna fell in love with Uma the daughter of Banasura. So he followed her to her palace and was captured by Banasura&#8217;s men. Aniruddha didn&#8217;t return home for months and Sage Narada informed that Aniruddha has been captured by Banasura. So the battle between Krishna and Banasura ensued. Banasura was a devotee of Shiva and several other Shiva&#8217;s followers were harassed by Krishna so Shiva decided to help Banasura in the battle. Kartikeya son of Shiva also helped him. Banasura along with Shiva were overpowered by Krishna so Shiva requested Krishna not to kill Banasura so Krishna only cuts off the hands of Banasura.</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 10.63.12-14 &#8220;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Lord Śiva, wielder of the trident, shot various weapons at Lord Kṛṣṇa</span>, wielder of Śārṅga. But Lord Kṛṣṇa was not in the least perplexed: He neutralized all these weapons with appropriate counterweapons. Lord Kṛṣṇa counteracted a brahmāstra with another brahmāstra, a wind weapon with a mountain weapon, a fire weapon with a rain weapon, and Lord Śiva&#8217;s personal pāśupatāstra weapon with His own personal weapon, the nārāyaṇāstra. After bewildering Lord Śiva by making him yawn with a yawning weapon, Lord Kṛṣṇa proceeded to strike down Bāṇāsura&#8217;s army with His sword, club and arrows.&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 10.63.22 &#8220;After Lord Śiva&#8217;s followers had been driven away, the Śiva-jvara, who had three heads and three feet, pressed forward to attack Lord Kṛṣṇa. As the Śiva-jvara approached, he seemed to burn everything in the ten directions. Seeing this personified weapon approach, Lord Nārāyaṇa then released His own personified fever weapon, the Viṣṇu-jvara. The Śiva-jvara and Viṣṇu-jvara thus battled each other. The Śiva-jvara, overwhelmed by the strength of the Viṣṇu-jvara, cried out in pain. But finding no refuge, the frightened Śiva-jvara approached Lord Kṛṣṇa, the master of the senses, hoping to attain His shelter. Thus with joined palms he began to praise the Lord. The Śiva-jvara said: I bow down to You of unlimited potencies, the Supreme Lord, the Supersoul of all beings. You possess pure and complete consciousness and are the cause of cosmic creation, maintenance and dissolution. Perfectly peaceful, You are the Absolute Truth to whom the Vedas indirectly refer.&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SHIVA VS VISHNU</span></strong></p>
<p>There is another battle between Shiva and Krishna. And in this battle, Shiva helps Kasiraja and is defeated by Krishna. But in Skanda Purana it is a battle between Shiva and Vishnu. The discus of Krishna manifests itself as Vishnu. The story is that a King named Paundraka claims to be Vasudeva, this angers Krishna and he prepares for a battle against the imposter Vasudeva (Paundraka). King Paundraka is helped by his friend who is also a king of Kasi named Kasiraja. Since Kasiraja was a devotee of Shiva he propitiates Shiva for help in the battle against Krishna and Shiva agrees to help him,</p>
<p>Skanda Purana II.ii.12.14-18 &#8220;&#8230;Nila mountain is in the third Yojana (i.e. 3X12 Kms.). This is the holy spot of the Lord of Gauri named Ekamrakavana. Not far off, O king, is the place where, being afraid, he sought refuge. Indradyumna said: Why was the Lord of Gauri (Siva) frightened? With whom did he seek refuge?&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Skanda Purana II.ii.12.45-57 &#8220;O king, many king ruled over that city. Formerly in Dvapara Yuga, there was a king there (commonly) called Kasiraja. By means of severe penance he propitiated Lord Sambhu with this aim in his mind: &#8216;I will excel in war Acyuta (Krsna), the conquerer of kings, the chief of whom is Jaraasandha.&#8217; The Pinaka-bearing Lord (Siva) who was propitiated, granted him that boon: &#8216;O suppressor of enemies, you will conquer the Slayer of Kamsa in battle. For your sake I shall fight seated on my Bull, along with (my attendants) Pramathas&#8230;That Lord (Krsna) who is the immanent soul (of all), knew the incident of that sort, and sent his Discus for killing Kasiraja. The infuriated Discus that was very fierce in appearance, had the refulgence of a thousand suns. It knew the power of the mind of Visnu. It cut off the head of Kasiraja and burned to ash his army as well as that city. On seeing that extremely violent action Pasupati (Siva) became furious. Surrounded by his Ganas and seated on his Bull, the Pinaka-bearing Lord rushed at it. Then Sambhu looked at the Sudarsana Discus at the outset and discharged his Pasupata missile in front of it, like an ominous calamity. Formerly Sambhu had secured a boon from Visnu who had been pleased by his devotion: &#8216;On being remembered by you I shall invigorate your missile. But if you go against me, it will become lustreless (and ineffective.&#8217; When this Pasupata missile which was (usually) terrible, became futile and when Varanis was burned, the Bull-bannered Lord became afraid. Then he eulogized the Primordial Purusottama, the cause of all the worlds.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Skanda Purana II.ii.12.65-77 &#8220;When (the Lord) who burned the Tripuras eulogized thus, Adhoksaja (Visnu) manifested himself after casting off the form of the Discus. His face (indicated that he was) delighted. The glorious Lord held the conch, the discus and the iron club. He was seated on Garuda as if on a lotus seat&#8230;Though he was an ocean of mercy, he spoke the husband of Girija (who was) firghteneed, as if he waas angry with him. Sri Bhagavan said: How has such an evil-mindedness beset you at this time? O Sambhu, for the sake of an insect (i.e. an insignificant) king, you have come to fight with me! How many examples of my power have not been known to you, O Durjati (Siva). It is true that your Pasupati missile cannot be vanquished by Suras and Asuras. The Discus is a form of my anger. I t cannot spare even you&#8230;Now if you wish to sport about with Gauri here for a long time, if you wish that this city of Varanasi should stay for a long time (do as follows). On the shore of the Southern Sea there is a holy spot well known after my name, viz. Sripurusottama. It is adorned by Nila mountain&#8230;O annihilator of Tripuras, stay there fearlessly along with Parvati.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Skanda Purana II.ii.12.80-83 &#8220;Narada said: On being told thus by Vasudeva the Three-eyed Lord bent down his head. With palms joined in reverence he spoke to the slayer of Madhu: Mahadeva said: O Lord of Devas, O Lord of the universe, O Lord, O dispeller of the agony of those who bow down (to you) carrying out your behest will be the cause of my welfare, O Lord of the worlds. On account of my stupidity, O Lord, I had been arrogant. There, O Lord, your own blessing is the cause of my fickleness. Since you command me, O Lord of Devas, to proceed to Purusottama, I shall carry out your behest reverently and proceed to the auspicious holy place that bestows salvation&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Krishna beheads Kasiraja with his Sudarshan Chakra as mentioned in Srimad Bhagavatam 10.66.22.</p>
<p>There was another battle between Shiva and Vishnu. Where Shiva kills Vishnu&#8217;s three sons in the form of a bull for creating havoc and Vishnu fights Shiva and is defeated by that Bull, Vishnu wasn&#8217;t aware that the bull was actually Shiva,</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Satarudra Samhita 3, chapter 23, verses 3-12 &#8220;Then the bull attacked Visnu&#8217;s sons wielding their bows for fighting, deluded by Siva&#8217;s Maya and proud of their great strenght and exploit. O excellent sage, the sons of Visnu becamame furious. Those heroes roared loudly and rushed against Siva. Rudra in that form of a bull was furious at those sons of Visnu who rushed at him. He kicked them with his hoofs and tore them with his horns. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">When their limbs were split by Rudra, they swooned and lost their lives. They were immediately destroyed</span>. When they were killed Visnu the foremost of the strong came out shouting loudly and hastened towards Siva<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">. On Seeing Siva in the form of the bull going along after killing his sons, Visnu hit him with divine arrows and missiles</span>. Then the infuriated Siva, the highly powerful one in the form of a bull stood like a mountain and caught hold of all those milssiles of Visnu&#8230;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The lord leaped up suddenly and kicked the infuriated Visnu who was deluded and could not realise him. The lord then tore him with his horns</span>. Unable to bear the onslaught, Visnu deluded by Maya was exhausted and utterly shattered.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Satarudra Samhita 3, chapter 23, verses 13-16 &#8220;When his pride fell off, Visnu was dejected, and dispirited. He then realised that Siva was sporting about in the form of a bull. Then on realising that Siva himself had come in the form of a Bull, Visnu spoke in a shrill voice with drooping shoulders and palms joined in reverence. Visnu said: O lord of the gods, O ocean of mercy, O lord Siva, I had been deluded by your Maya and my mind had been confused. O lord, I fought with you, Siva. Taking pity on me, O lord, let this offence be excused.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SHIVA&#8217;S VIRABHADRA VS VISHNU&#8217;S NARASIMHA</span></strong></p>
<p>The story of Vishnu’s Narasimha avatar killing Hiranyakashipu with his claws by placing him on his lap is well known. This story ends with the killing of Hiranyakaship in Vaishnavite Puranas, however, it has an addition in Shaivite Puranas which says that this avatar of Vishnu was killed by Shiva’s Sharaba form and this story can be found only in Shaivite Puranas to show Shiva as superior to Vishnu. The summary of the story is that fiery Narasimha didn’t just stop after killing Hiranyakaship, Narasimha created havoc on the earth and was going to annihilate the universe. Gods propitiated “The Destroyer” Shiva to stop it and save the world. Hence, Shiva sent his Virabhadra form to pacify Narasimha avatar. Virabhadra praised Narasimha and requested him to stop the annihilation of the universe as “The Destroyer” is only Shiva but all in vain. Sweet words of Narasimha instead infuriated Narasimha and he held the Virabhadra form. Thence Virabhadra form disappeared with a change in environment marking the advent of the most fierce form of Shiva known as Sharaba. This form is explained in the following way,</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Satarudrasamhita 3, chapter 12, verses 2-11 &#8220;Nandisvara said: Thus admonished by Virabhadra, the Man-lion became furious. He roared and began to seize him with force. In the meantime, the splendour of Siva rose up unbearably enveloping the sky all around. It was terrible and cause for imminent fear. Then in a trice the form of Virabhhadra became invisible&#8230;Even as all the gods stood watching with the auspicious shouts of victory, Lord Siva became manifest in the form the Annihilator. He had a thousand hands and wore matted hair. His head was adorned with wings and beak. His body was fierce and fully developed. His fangs were very sharp. Adamantine claws were his weapons. His neck was black in colour. He had a huge arms and four legs. He was blazing like fire. His voice was resonant and terrible like the rumbling sound of the clouds that gather at the end of a Yuga. His three eyes were as wide and blazing as the fire of the evil spirit of great fury. His fangs and lips were clearly visible. He was producing a hissing sound of Humkara. Siva of such a form appeared in sight.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>The following verses show Virabhadra’s attempt to calm Narasimha which further infuriated Narasimha,</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Satarudrasamhita 3, chapter 11, verses 25-27 &#8220;[Virabhadra says] O lord Narasimha, O soul of the universe, subdue this extremely terrible body yourself in my presence. Nandisvara said; Urged thus with quiet peaceful words of Virabhadra, the arrogant man-lion assumed a more terrible anger&#8230;The Man-lion said: Go back the way you have come from. Do not speak offending words. I am now going to annihilate the universe of the mobile and immobile beings.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>The following verses show how he killed Narasimha and skinned him to wear it as a garment.</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Satarudrasamhita 3, chapter 12, verses 12-36 &#8220;At his very vision Visnu lost his strength and exploit. He assumed a lustre of the flickering glow-worm beneath the sun. Fluttering with his wings, and tearing the navel and legs he bound the legs of the Man-lion with his tail and his hands with his own hands. He struck his chest, caught hold of Visnu. It expanded in the sky along with the gods and sages. Like a vulture seizing a serpent he fearlessly caught hold of Visnu, lifted him up and fell him to the ground. At the time of flight he was excessively oppressed being hit with the wings. Then Lord Siva took Visnu and flew him. All the gods followed him eulogising him with the words of obeisance. Brahma and other sages bowed to him with reverence and love. Being led thus Visnu was helpless. His face was pallid and sorrowful. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">With palms joined in reverence he eulogised Lord Siva with prayers of simple words</span>. After eulogising Mrda with the hundred and eight names of the lord, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Nrsimha requested lord Sarabha again. &#8216;O great lord, whenever my ignorant mind becomes defiled by arrogance, it shall be removed by you alone&#8217;</span> Nandisvara said: Thus saying with love to Siva, the Man-lion turned submissive and bowed to him. Visnu was utterly defeated and came to the end of his life&#8230;Lord Virabhadra, the leader of the Ganas, of great strength, peeled off the hide of the Man-lion and went to the mountain taking it with him. From that time Siva began to wear the hide of the Man-lion. His head was the leading bead in his necklace of skulls.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Linga Purana says that only bones were left with a face but Shiva Purana says that Virabhadra/Sharabha used Narasimha’s head as bead in his necklace of skulls. Sharabha killing Narasimha is also mentioned in other verses. Brahma says in Skanda Purana,<br />
Skanda Purana I.iii(U).16.17 &#8220;If you had not killed Nrhari (Man-lion) by assuming the form of Sarabha (i.e. a fabulous eight footed animal) alone, he would have destroyed the universe like Hiranyakasipu.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">INDRA VS SHIVA</span></strong></p>
<p>Mahabharata, Drona Parva 7, Section 202, Verses 82-84 &#8220;When the triple city began to burn, the goddess Durga went to see the sight, with a child on her lap having only five clumps of hair on its head. Uma then asked the gods who that child was. The malevolent Indra then tried to strike him with the thunder-bolt. Thereupon the all-powerful Lord of all the worlds, possessed of the six excellent qualities the Bhagas, smilingly paralysed the arm of the enraged Indra wielding the thunder bolt.&#8221; Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">MARUTS VS INDRA</span></strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.170.2 The Maruts are thy brothers. Why, O Indra, wouldst thou take our lives? Agree with them in friendly wise, and do not slay us in the fight.</p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.171.6 Do thou, O Indra, guard the conquering Heroes, and rid thee of thy wrath against the Maruts…</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">KRISHNA VS INDRA</span></strong></p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 5.30.51-68 &#8220;&#8230;and Indra accordingly, attended by the army of the celestials, marched to attack Hari, in defence of the Parijata tree. The gods were armed with clubs, swords, maces, and darts; and Indra wielded the thunderbolt. As soon as Govinda saw the king of the gods advancing against him on his elephant, attended by the immortals, he blew his shell so that the sound filled all the regions, and he showered smilingly myriads of arrows upon his assailants&#8230;The son of Devaki thew his mace at the club of Yama, and cast it broken upon the ground: he cut in bits the litter of the lord of the sun: he severed Agni into a hundred parts with his arrows, and scattered the Vasus through the realms of space: with his discus he cut off the points of tridents of Rudras, and cast themselves upon the earth: and with the shafts shot from his bow he dispersed the Sadhyas, Visvas, Maruts, and Gandharbas, like fleeces of cotton from the pods of the wings and nails, and bit and bruised and scratched the deities who opposed his lord&#8230;When all other weapons had been cut to pieces, Indra stood armed with his thunderbolt, and Krshna with the discus Sudarsana. Beholding them thus prepared to fight, all the people of the three spheres exclaimed, &#8216;Alas! alas!&#8217; Indra launched his bolt, but in vain, for Hari caught and arrested it&#8230;&#8221; Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>H.H. Wilson summarizes this as,</p>
<p>&#8220;Krishńa restores her earrings to Adití, and is praised by her: he visits the gardens of Indra, and at the desire of Satyabhámá carries off the Párijáta tree. Śachí excites Indra to its rescue. Conflict between the gods and Krishńa, who defeats them. Satyabhámá derides them. They praise Krishńa.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">VISHNU VS LAKSHMI</span></strong></p>
<p>Now, this is a good lesson to all married men, do not provoke your wife and do not talk about other women, she can even behead you. Lakshmi beheads Vishnu using a curse because Vishnu laughed at her unnecessarily,</p>
<p>Srimad Devi Bhagavatam 1.5.74-86 &#8220;Does anything take place in this world without any cause? <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Now hear why Hari&#8217;s head was cut off</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Once on a time, seeing the beautiful face of His dear wife Laksmî Devî, Hari laughed in presence of Her</span>. At this Laksmî Devî came to understand that &#8220;He has seen surely something ugly in my face and therefore He laughed; otherwise why my Husband would laugh at seeing me. But what reason can there be as to see ugliness in my face after so long a time. And why shall <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">He laugh without seeing something ugly, without any cause. Or it may be, He has made some other beautiful woman as my co-wife</span>&#8220;. Thus arguing variously in her mind, Mahâ Laksmî gradually got angry and Tamo guna slowly possessed Her. Then, by turn of Fate, in order that god&#8217;s work might be completed, very fierce Tamas Sakti entered into Her body. She got very angry and slowly said:&#8211; &#8220;Let Thy head fall off&#8221;. Thus, owing to feminine nature and the destiny of Bhagvan, Laksmî cursed without any thought of good or bad, causing Her own suffering. By the Tâmasî S&#8217;akti possessing Her, she thought that a co-wife would be more painful than Her widowhood and thus She cursed Him. Falsehood, vain boldness, craftiness, stupidity, impatience, over-greediness, impurity, and harshness are the natural qualities of women. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Owing to that curse, the head of Vasudeva has fallen into the salt ocean</span>. Now I will fix the head on His body as before…&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">VISHNU VS GODS</span></strong></p>
<p>Gods accidentally or deliberately cut off the head of Vishnu. Vishnu slept placing his head at the end of a bow. Gods created white ants and made a deal with them and made them gnaw the bowstring. When they did so it cut off the head of Vishnu,</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana 14.1.1.6-9 Now he who is this Vishnu is the sacrifice; and he who is this sacrifice is yonder Âditya (the sun). But, indeed, Vishnu was unable to control that (love of) glory of his; and so even now not every one can control that (love of) glory of his. Taking his bow, together with three arrows, he stepped forth. He stood, resting his head on the end of the bow. Not daring to attack him, the gods sat themselves down all around him. Then the ants said&#8211;these ants (vamrî), doubtless, were that (kind called) &#8216;upadîkâ &#8216;&#8211;&#8216;What would ye give to him who should gnaw the bowstring?&#8217;&#8211;&#8216;We would give him the (constant) enjoyment of food, and he would find water even in the desert: so we would give him every enjoyment of food.&#8217;&#8211;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">&#8216;So be it,&#8217; they said. Having gone nigh unto him, they gnawed his bowstring. When it was cut, the ends of the bow, springing asunder, cut off Vishnu&#8217;s head</span>.</p>
<p>Srimad Devi Bhagavatam 1.5.23-36 &#8220;Brahmâ said :&#8211; We will give you, too, share in this our Yajña (sacrifice); so hear me; do our work and rouse Visnu from His sleep. During the time of performing Homa whatever ghee will fall outside the Homa-Kund (the sacrificial pit) will fall to your share; so be quick and do this. Sûta said:&#8211; Thus ordered by Brahmâ, the Vamrî insect soon ate away the fore end of the bow that rested on the ground. Immediately the string gave way and the bow went up; the other end became free and a terrible sound took place. The Devas bcame afraid; the whole universe got agitated; the earth trembled. The sea became swollen; the aquatic animals became startled; violent wind blew; the mountains shook; ominous meteors fell. The quarters assumed a terrific aspect; the Sun went down the horizon. In that time of distress the Devas became anxious what evil might come down. O ascetics! while the Devas were thus cogitating, the head with crown on it of the Devadeva Visnu vanished away ; no body knew where it fell. When the awful darkness disappeared, Brahmâ and Mahâdeva saw the disfigured body of Visnu with its head off. Seeing that headless figure of Visnu they were greatly surprised; they were drowned in the ocean of cares and, overwhelmed with grief, began to weep aloud…&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">INDRA VS ARJUNA</span></strong></p>
<p>Although Arjuna wasn&#8217;t a god but his adviser was Krishna so the story can be mentioned here. Actually, it was not a battle between Arjun and Indra but between Arjuna and Ashwasena but Indra decided to fight noticing that his friend&#8217;s son Ashwasena was going to get killed by Arjuna,</p>
<p>Mahabharata Adi Parva 1.229 &#8220;But Aswasena, the mighty son of Takshaka, was there. He made great efforts to escape from that fire; but confined by Arjuna&#8217;s shafts he succeeded not in finding a way. It was then that his mother, the daughter of a snake, determined to save him by swallowing him first. His mother first swallowed his head and then was swallowing his tail. And desirous of saving her son, the sea-snake rose (up from the earth) while still employed in swallowing her son&#8217;s tail. But Arjuna as soon as he beheld her escaping, severed her head from her body by means of a sharp and keen-edged arrow. Indra saw all this, and desiring to save his friend&#8217;s son, the wielder of the thunderbolt, by raising a violent wind, deprived Arjuna of consciousness.&#8221; Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">INDRA VS SAGARA&#8217;S SONS</span></strong></p>
<p>Indra uses his tactics to kill the sons of king Sagara,</p>
<p>As per the story mentioned in Srimad Bhagavatam 9.8. There was a king named Sagara who was the ancestor of Hindu god Ram. He had 60,000 sons. Instructed by sage Aurva, King Sagara performed Ashvamedha sacrifice but Indra stole the horse and left it in sage Kapila&#8217;s Ashram. Indra made Sagara&#8217;s sons lose their intelligence and disrespected the sage. As the sage was meditating and as soon as he opened his eyes the sons of Sagara were burned with the fire emanating from their own bodies</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">INDRA VS VISHWARUPA</span></strong></p>
<p>This is another version of Indra killing Vishwarupa. Geeta Kasturi summarizes the story as,</p>
<p>&#8220;The story goes that rishi Vishvarupa was very fond of his mother. She was from the family of asuras. Prompted by the affection for her, he used to give a portion of the sacrificial oblations secretly to the asuras. Indra detected the treachery of the rishi and cut off the three heads of Vishvarupa.&#8221;</p>
<p>This story iss mentioned in Srimad Bhagavatam (Bhagavad Purana) and Devi Bhagavatam,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 6.9.4 &#8220;Indra, the king of gods, noticed his contempt and faithlessness to gods and his sham righteousness. Being afraid (lest Asuras should be powerful) he immediately cut down (Visvarupa&#8217;s) heads in wrath.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Srimad Devi Bhagavaram 3.12.25 verses says that Vishwarupa would utter Mantras beneficial to gods when they were present and in the absence of gods he would pray for the welfare of Daityas.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">INDRA VS MUNI DADHYAM</span></strong></p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 7.36.28. “O Best of Mountains! It is very difficult to acquire Brahma Jñâna. Hear a story. A Muni named Dadhyam of Atharvana family went to Indra and prayed to him to give Brahma Jñâna. Indra said: &#8220;I would give you Brahma-Jñâna, but if you impart it to any other body, I would sever your head.&#8221; Dadhyarna agreed to this and Indra gave him the Brahma-Jñâna. After a few days, the two As&#8217;vins came to the Muni and prayed for Brahma Vidyâ, The Muni said:&#8211; &#8220;If I give you the Brahma-Vidyi, Indra, will cut off my head.&#8221; Hearing this the two As&#8217;vins said:&#8211; &#8220;We will cut your head and keep it elsewhere and we will attach the head of a horse to your body. Instruct us with the mouth of this horse and when Indra will cut off your this mouth, we will replace your former head.&#8221; When they said so, the Muni gave them the Brahma-Vidyâ. Indra cut off his head by his thunderbolt. When the horse-head of the Muni was cut off, the two physicians of the Devas replaced his original head. This is widely known in all the Vedas.” Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">VASHISHTHA VS VISHWAMITRA</span></strong></p>
<p>Vishwamitra came to the hermitage of sage Vashishtha. Vashishtha had a genie of the lamp-like cow perhaps known as Kamdhenu who would grant all desires. Vishwamitra became very excited about the cow so he wanted to obtain it and he asked Vasishtha for it and said that in return he would give him many cows. But Vasishtha refused so Vishwamitra became angry and wanted to take it away by force. Vishwamitra&#8217;s sons were killed by Vashistha and to avenge it Vishwamitra started performing austerities in the forest in order to obtain a boon from Shiva. Vrishadwaja (appellation of Shiva) decided to bestow a boon. Vishwamitra asks him to confer the science of archery with all its mysteries and mantras as well as its virtues and also weapons. Then Vishvamitra goes to Vasishtha&#8217;s hermitage and attacks him</p>
<p>Ramayana of Valmiki, Bala Kanda 1.55.5-7 &#8220;And seeing the army annihilated by the high-souled Vasishtha, the hundred sons of Vicwamitra, equipped with various weapons, rushed in high ire against that best of mantra-reciting ones. Thereupon, uttering a roar, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">that might ascetic consumed them quite. And in a moment, Vicwamitra&#8217;s sons together with horse and car and foot were reduced to ashes by the high-souled Vasishtha</span>.&#8221; Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Vishwamitra instigated Rakshasas to kill Vashishtha&#8217;s son and Vashishtha&#8217;s sons were also killed. And in grief, Vashishtha&#8217;s tried to commit suicide by jumping from a mountain but he fell on a heap of cotton, then he torched the forest and entered it but it didn&#8217;t burn him and then he tied a weight to his neck and drowned himself in the waters but even that didn&#8217;t kill him. He came to know that his daughter in law is pregnant so he gave up the idea of committing suicide,</p>
<p>Mahabharata Adi Parva 1.178.41-49 &#8220;Beholding Saktri thus slain and devoured, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Viswamitra repeatedly urged that Rakshasa (who was within the monarch) against the other sons of Vasishtha. Like a wrathful lion devouring small animals, that Rakshasa soon devoured the other sons of the illustrious Vasishtha that were junior to Saktri in age</span>. But Vasishtha, learning that all his sons had been caused to be slain by Viswamitra, patiently bore his grief like the great mountain that bears the earth. That best of Munis, that foremost of intelligent men, was resolved rather to sacrifice his own life than exterminate (in anger) the race of Kusikas. The illustrious Rishi threw himself down from the summit of Meru, but he descended on the stony ground as though on a heap of cotton. And, O son of Pandu, when the illustrious one found that death did not result from that fall, he kindled a huge fire in the forest and entered it with alacrity. But that fire, though burning brightly, consumed him not. O slayer of foes, that blazing fire seemed to him cool. Then the great Muni under the influence of grief, beholding the sea, tied a stony weight to his neck and threw himself into its waters. But the waves soon cast him ashore. At last when that Brahmana of rigid vows succeeded not in killing himself by any means, he returned, in distress of heart, to his asylum.&#8221; Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>

<h2><a id="sins-hell"></a>Sins leading to hell</h2>
<p>Hinduism too has the concept of heaven and hell but unlike Abrahamic religions, Hinduism has temporary heaven and hell. The reason I am mentioning it here is because it refutes the claim of deceitful Hindus on the internet who claims that &#8216;You are free to do anything, you will not be put into hell for doing this or that thing&#8217;. Hinduism lists several sins that could lead one to hell, I am mentioning some of them like not worshiping Shivling leads one to hell, who doesn’t observe Yajnas, those who don’t follow the path laid down by Vedas, etc.,</p>

<p>Shiva Purana, Uma Samhita 5.10.19-20 &#8220;If men, out of greed, pluck and sniff at flowers of the temple parks, or wear them on their heads, their heads are covered with iron spikes and their noses are filled with plenty of acid and other things.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Linga Purana Section II.18.60-62 &#8220;&#8230;The lord said thus:-&#8216;O excellent-faced lady, a person who applies Bhasman is on a par with my son Ganesa. What is repugnant to them should be eschewed. A householder who is devoid of Brahman (Vedic knowledge) and who does not wear the caste mark Tripundra falls into the depths of hell. All his holy rites of worship, charitable gifts and holy ablutions are in vain like the Homa performed in the ashes.&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Vayu Purana Section II.21.59-61 &#8220;Brhaspati said: The man who after hearing this explanation of the procedure of Sraddhas, becomes malicious, is an atheist enveloped in darkness. He will drown himself in the terrible hell. He who has perfectly controlled his mind, finds all his great ailments terminated. He who is not mindful of the Asramas (stages of life) stated in the Vedas attains the Kumbhika hell. He attains the status of a thief and gets his tongue cut. Those who censure Yoga become lumps of clay in the ocean and decay as long as earth exists. Hence, this is the Dharma (virtue) intended in the Sraddha that it should be performed by a man with faith (in it.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare, edited by G.P. Bhatt</p>

Deshpande</p>
<p>Shiva Purana Vayaviyasamhita 6, Section II, 41.38 &#8220;This excellent gem of Sivapurana, should not be mentioned to those who do not know the Vedas, nor should it be imparted to a disciple who is not a devotee of Siva nor to an atheist.

<p>Brahmanda Purana 2.3.19.57b-58a &#8220;After hearing these rules and regulations regarding Sraddha, if any man does not perform it, he is an atheist and he shall fall into the terrible hell enveloped in darkness.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Kurma Purana II.24.7 &#8220;Either due to atheistic feelings or due to lethargy, if anyone does not wish to maintain sacrificial fires, nor does he perform Yajnas, he falls into many hells.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Skanda Purana III.iii.22.39-41 &#8220;Men who censure a man conversant with the Puranas or the story that dispels sins, become dogs in a hundred births.

<h3><a id="hinduism-salvation"></a>Hinduism is the only way to salvation</h3>
<p>Contrary to the much hype by Hindus. One should worship a Deva, believe in the Vedas, and sacrifice to the gods in order to attain salvation, if he doesn&#8217;t then he keeps taking rebirth and is also put in hell in between the cycles of birth as punishment. Attaining heaven is the main aim of Abrahamic religions but attaining salvation is the main aim of Hinduism. It&#8217;s mentioned in the Vedas,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 9.73.9 &#8220;The thread of the cosmic sacrifice, spread over the ultraphychic filter, extends as if, by its act up to the tip of venerable Lord&#8217;s tongue; the prudent devotees attain it; <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">but he who is incompetent and faithless shall sink into the pit of hell</span>, even whilst he is in this world.&#8221; Tr. Svami Satya Prakash Saraswati</p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.164.39 &#8220;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">They are atheists and of weak intellect, and continually remain sunk in the depths of misery and pain who do not believe in, know</span>, and commune with, Him who is Resplendent, All-glorious, All-Holy, All-knowledge, sustainer of the sun, the earth and other planets, Who pervades all like ether, is the Lord of all and is above all devatas. It is by the knowledge and contemplation of God alone that all men attain true happiness.&#8221; Tr. Dr. Chiranjiva Bhardwaja, as mentioned in the book Satyarth Prakash, By Swami Dayanand Saraswati, Ch 7, page 203.</p>
<p>Krishna said,</p>
<p>Gita 9.3 &#8220;Those who are not faithful in this devotional service cannot attain Me, O conqueror of enemies. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Therefore they return to the path of birth and death in this material world</span>.&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 11.21.1 &#8220;The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Those who give up these methods for achieving Me</span>, which consist of devotional service, analytic philosophy and regulated execution of prescribed duties, and instead, being moved by the material senses, cultivate insignificant sense gratification, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">certainly undergo the continual cycle of material existence</span>.&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>He also said,</p>
<p>Gita 8.11-13 &#8220;Persons who are learned in the Vedas, who utter oṁ-kāra, and who are great sages in the renounced order enter into Brahman. Desiring such perfection, one practices celibacy. I shall now brieﬂy explain to you this process by which one may attain salvation. The yogic situation is that of detachment from all sensual engagements. Closing all the doors of the senses and ﬁxing the mind on the heart and the life air at the top of the head, one establishes himself in yoga. After being situated in this yoga practice and vibrating the sacred syllable oṁ, the supreme combination of letters, if one thinks of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and quits his body, he will certainly reach the spiritual planets.&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Gita 4.40 &#8220;The ignorant fool, one without faith in Vedic scriptures, and one afflicted by inner doubt and uncertainty is ruined and for one afflicted by doubt and uncertainty there is no happiness in this world nor the next.&#8221;</p>
<p>Brahma Purana 65.71-73 &#8220;Thus O brahmins is the greatest abode of Visnu endowed with all enjoyable pleasures and attributes. It is conducive to the pleasures of everyone. It is holy and full of mysteries. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Atheists and profligates do not go there</span>. Nor do the following go there viz.-the ungrateful and those who are of uncontrollable sense-organs. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The devotees of Visnu who worship Vasudeva the preceptor of the universe with devotion, go to the world of Visnu</span>.&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Skanda Purana II.ii.26.28-33 &#8220;&#8230;One who installs the idol of Hari in accordance with the injunctions in the Mansion does not get involved in the bondage of physical bodies. He goes to the great region of Visnu.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Narada Purana I.41.106 &#8220;It is only through the repetition of the names of Hari that redemption is attained by the people who commit sins, who are beyond the pale of Vedic path and who are wanting in mental purity.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 7.1.32 &#8220;Somehow or other, one must consider the form of Kṛṣṇa very seriously. Then, by one of the five different processes mentioned above, one can return home, back to Godhead. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Atheists like King Vena, however, being unable to think of Kṛṣṇa&#8217;s form in any of these five ways, cannot attain salvation</span>. Therefore, one must somehow think of Kṛṣṇa, whether in a friendly way or inimically.&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 5.26.3 &#8220;…And for one who acts impiously and ignorantly because of atheism, the resultant hellish life is the worst. Because of ignorance, every living entity has been carried by various desires into thousands of different hellish planets since time immemorial. I shall try to describe them as far as possible.&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagvatam 6.1.40 &#8220;The Yamadūtas replied: That which is prescribed in the Vedas constitutes dharma, the religious principles, and the opposite of that is irreligion. The Vedas are directly the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Nārāyaṇa, and are self-born. This we have heard from Yamarāja.&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Srimad Devi Bhagavatam 6.6.29-32. &#8220;The Munis said:&#8211; &#8220;O King! All the creatures certainly enjoy the fruits of their Karmas, whether good or bad; how then, can persons, of perverted intellect, obtain peace when they do mischief to others. The treacherous persons certainly go to hell and suffer miseries always. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The slayers of Brâhmanas and the drunkards may get liberation; but never the faithless</span> and those who go against their friends get off free; <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">these will have to suffer undoubtedly in the hells</span>.&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>

<p>Ramayana of Valmiki, Kishkindha Kanda 4.17.36 &#8220;The regicide, the brahmincide, the slayer of the cow, the thief and the one who finds pleasure in the destruction of other beings, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">the unbeliever and the one who weds before his elder brother, all these enter hell</span>&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Hari Prasad Shastri</p>

<p>Srimad Devi Bhagavatam 6.11.57-65. &#8220;Vyâsa said:&#8211; O King! There is only one path and none other which can save a man from the sin of this Kâlî; and that is this:&#8211; The Jîvas must meditate on the lotus-feet of the Highest Devî for the purification of all their faults and sins. O King! There is so much strength in Her sin-destroying Name, that the amount of sin in this world falls much less in proportion to that. Where, then, is the cause of fear? Her Name, uttered at random, even in an unconscious state, bestows so much unspeakable results that even Hari, Hara and others have not the capacity to know that.&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>

<h2><a id="atheism"></a>Atheism</h2>
<p>This is a very important topic for discussion. Hindus claim that you can even be an atheist and attain salvation. I don&#8217;t really know what is the basis of this claim. They should furnish references showing that even an atheist who doesn&#8217;t believe in god and Veda, who never sacrificed for Devas or worshipped them can go to heaven temporarily and attain salvation. I am not challenging them but asking for educational purposes. Buddhism and Jainism are condemned in Hindu scriptures because of their atheistic doctrines then how can Hindus claim that you can be an atheist? Why do Hindu scriptures lay stress on the atheistic doctrines of Buddhism and Jainism while condemning them and rejecting them as false religions? Now they cite Mimamsa philosophy to support their argument, such atheistic doctrines are later entrants to Hinduism probably to counter Buddhism. Do they even know what Mimamsa is? Mimamsa has both theistic and atheistic doctrines, it rejects a personal god but believes in the authority of the Vedas. Now you tell me, is there any atheist on the face of this earth who claims the Vedas to be authoritative? Atheism is strongly condemned in Hindu scriptures, Vedas even call for the death of godless atheists. Buddha is criticized for rejecting the Vedas so how can Hindus claim this? If they want to prove that Atheists can attain salvation then they should furnish references showing that a man who doesn&#8217;t believe in god, in Vedas, in Brahmins, who doesn&#8217;t worship and who doesn&#8217;t sacrifice can attain salvation. That&#8217;s it. No need for further discussion. Hindu scholars have also translated the word Nastika as an infidel. Nastika in Sanskrit is literally translated as Atheist. But in Vedic (Hindu scriptures) terminology an atheist doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean the one who doesn&#8217;t believe in god, but it has several meanings like a non-Hindu is also considered to be an atheist, a censurer of Vedas is also considered an atheist, etc, let me present some sources,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 9.13.9 “O Pavamamas, driving off the godless, looking on the light, Sit in the place of sacrifice.” Tr. Ralph. T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>Rig Veda 7.6.3 “The foolish, faithless, rudely-speaking niggards, without belief or sacrifice or worship,— Far far sway hath Agni chased those Dasytis, and, in the cast, hath turned the godless westward.” Tr. Ralph. T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>Kurma Purana II.24.10 &#8220;He who is one who maintains sacrificial fires but does not wish to perform sacrifice to the lord by means of meditation, is a confused person. He should not be conversed with. What more (need be said) that man is an atheist.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Varaha Purana 58.5-6 &#8220;Visnu should be considered as Rudra and Laksmi as Gauri. He who speaks of difference between them is lowly (Adhama) and should be considered an atheist outside the field of dharma.&#8221; Tr. Venkitasubramonia Iyer, J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 4.2.30 &#8220;Bhṛgu Muni continued: Since you blaspheme the Vedas and the brāhmaṇas, who are followers of the Vedic principles, it is understood that you have already taken shelter of the doctrine of atheism.&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>&#8220;The &#8216;infidel&#8217; is one who has no religion, his son is &#8216;the son of an infidel&#8217;. <strong>Vijnanesvara in Mitakshara on Yajnavalkya Smriti verse 244</strong></p>
<p>Swami Prabhupada wrote, &#8220;…An atheist is called a demon, and it is a fact that even a person born of good parents can turn into a demon by bad association…&#8221; <strong>Swami Prabhupada on Srimad Bhagavatam 3.3.6</strong><br />

<p>Swami Prabhupada also wrote, &#8220;Bhṛgu Muni, in cursing Nandīśvara, said that not only would they be degraded as atheists because of this curse, but they had already fallen to the standard of atheism because they had blasphemed the Vedas, which are the source of human civilization. Human civilization is based on the qualitative divisions of social order, namely the intelligent class, the martial class, the productive class and the laborer class. The Vedas provide the right direction for advancing in spiritual cultivation and economic development and regulating the principle of sense gratification, so that ultimately one may be liberated from material contamination to his real state of spiritual identification (ahaṁ brahmāsmi). As long as one is in the contamination of material existence, one changes bodies from the aquatics up to the position of Brahmā, but the human form of life is the highest perfectional life in the material world. The Vedas give directions by which to elevate oneself in the next life. The Vedas are the mother for such instructions, and the brāhmaṇas, or persons who are in knowledge of the Vedas, are the father. Thus if one blasphemes the Vedas and brāhmaṇas, naturally one goes down to the status of atheism. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The exact word used in Sanskrit is nāstika, which refers to one who does not believe in the Vedas but manufactures some concocted system of religion</span>…&#8221; <strong>Swami Prabhupada on Srimad Bhagavatam 4.2.30 </strong>http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_4.2.30</p>
<p><strong>He also wrote</strong>, &#8220;The Buddhists are called atheists because they have no respect for the Vedas, but those who defy the Vedic conclusions, as above mentioned, under the pretense of being followers of the Vedas, are verily more dangerous than the Buddhists.&#8221; <a href="http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_Introduction" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_Introduction<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 4.2.30 &#8220;By blaspheming the principles of the Vedas, which are the pure and supreme path of the saintly persons, certainly you followers of Bhūtapati, Lord Śiva, will descend to the standard of atheism without a doubt.&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>

<p>Vishnu Smriti 37.44. Reviling the Veda; [30-31] Studying irreligious books; Atheism;</p>
<p>Vamana Purana 40.35-36 &#8220;Therefore Dharma is not to be shunned, for Dharma is the supreme goal. Men devoid of Dharma go to the wide Raurava hell. Dharma, they say, enables a safe passage in heaven and here and Adharma leads to downfall in this world and the next.&#8221; Tr. Anand Swarup Gupta</p>
<p>Narada Purana I.15.79-80 &#8220;I shall tell you the sufferings of the atheists who turn their faces away from Hara and Hari. They will be compelled to eat salt for ten million years.

O ruler of men, in other hells also (they are tortured) like this.&#8221;  Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 11.5.15 &#8220;These godless people hate Lord Hari-their very indwelling self who abides in the bodies of others as well (as their Soul); and fixing their attachment to their mortal body and its relatives (wives, sons, etc.), they fall down deep into hell.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Kurma Purana II.19.31-32 &#8220;If any Brahmana does not practise his duty either due to atheism or due to lethargy, he falls into the terrible hells and is reborn as a crow. There is no other way for liberation excepting performance of the duties of one&#8217;s own Asrama (stage of life). Hence one should perform the holy rites for the satisfaction of Paramesthin (god Brahma).&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 3.17.5-7 “PARÁŚARA.&#8211;The Rig, Yajur, and Sáma Vedas constitute the triple covering of the several castes, and the sinner who throws this off is said to be naked (or apostate).

Therefore that which is not against the Vedas can be taken as proof; otherwise not. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Whoever acts Dharma according to other proofs than what is ordained in the Vedas, goes to the hell in the abode of Yama to get his lesson</span>.

Any other S&#8217;âstras can be taken as authoritative when it is fundamentally coincident with the Vedas. Else it can never be accepted.

The sinner, sore afflicted, rusheth about hither and thither. The leaves of the palmyra palm growing in the wood have two sharp edges like that of swords, and these teat his body grievously.

<h3><a id="examples"></a>Examples</h3>
<p>There are some examples where demons devoted to Devas were killed soon after they left the Vedic religion and embraced other religions like Buddhism and Jainism. There is a story of the sons of Raji being killed by Indra after Brihaspati deludes them to leave the Vedic religion and converts them to Jainism.</p>
<p>Matysa Purana 24.47-49 &#8220;&#8230;<span style="color: #ff0000;">Brihaspati then went and deluded the other sons of Raji with </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">false philosophy and established the Jina religion</span> opposed to the Vedas, though himself a knower of the Vedas and <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Indra on finding the sons of Brihaspati propagating a religion different from the Vedas based on a show of reason only killed them with his mighty thunderbolt</span>.&#8221; Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>Rig Veda 8.85.15 might be related to this verse.</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 4.19.6-7 &#8220;…replied Vrihaspati, &#8220;I had been applied to by you before, I could have done anything for you that you wished; as it is, I will endeavour and restore you in a few days to your sovereignty.&#8221; So saying, he commenced a sacrifice for the purpose of increasing the might of Indra, and of leading the sons of Raji into error, and so effecting their downfall. Misled by their mental fascination, the princes became enemies of the Brahmans, regardless of their duties, and contemners of the precepts of the Vedas; and thus devoid of morality and religion, they were slain by Indra, who by the assistance of the priest of the gods resumed his place in heaven…&#8221; Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 9.17.15 &#8220;Brhaspati, then offered oblations to fire (with malevolent purpose against the sons of Raji and made them stray from the path of religion) and Indra slew them once and all as they swerved from the path (of righteousness) and not a single son (of Raji) survived.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Also mentioned in Vishnu Purana book 4 chapter 9 which H.H. Wilson summarizes as &#8220;Descendants of Raji, son of Áyus: Indra resigns his throne to him: claimed after his death by his sons, who apostatize from the religion of the Vedas, and are destroyed by Indra. Descendants of Pratíkshatra, son of Kshatravriddha.&#8221;</p>
<p>A story in Shiva Purana goes like this,</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Rudra Samhita 2, Yuddhakanda 5, chapter 4, verses 1 &#8220;[Sanathkumara said] For causing obstacles in their virtuous activities, Visnu of great brilliance, created a Purusa* born of himself. [9-12] <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Let your name be Arihat</span>. You will have other auspicious names too. I shall assign to you a place afterwards. Now hear with reverence what is relevant to the context. O you who wield Maya, create a deceptive sacred text of sixteen hundred thousand verses, contrary to Srutis and Smritis wherein Varnas and Asramas shall be eschewed. Let that holy text be in Apabramsa language&#8230;I shall bestow on you the ability to create it. Different kinds of magic arts shall be subsevient to you. [18-20] O ascetic, no doubt, Vedic and Smarta rites flourish and shine there. But these shall certainly be exploded through this Vidya. O you shaven head, you shall go there for destroying the residents of the three cities. Revealing the Tamasika rites, destroy the three cities. After that, O great one, you shall go to the desert region and stay there carrying on your own duties and activities till the advent of the Kali age. When the Kali age begins let your Dharma be revealed. You shall then continue to do so by means of disciples and disciple&#8217;s disciples.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Rudrasamhita 2, Yuddha Khanda 5, chapter 10, verse 29 &#8220;Since they had refrained from the worship of Siva, hundreds of Asuras were burnt by the fire generated by the arrow. They cried &#8216;Ha Ha&#8217; in distress.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>This story is about the burning of Tripura. This is about Jina (Jain) religion. As per this story, the residents of Tripura followed the Vedic religion and they couldn&#8217;t be killed so Vishnu created an illusory form and named him Arihat and when the residents abandoned the Vedic religion, they were burnt alive. The translator Jagdish Lal Shastri writes on the footnote of Shiva Purana, Rudra Samhita 2, Yuddhakanda 5.4.1,</p>
<p>&#8220;*According to the present context Visnu created a delusive teacher called Mayamoha who created a Mayasastra of sixteen lakhs of slokas in Apabhramsa, preaching Jina Dharma for misguiding the Asuras. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mayamoha created four sorts of preachers for the propagation of Jina Dharma</span>. He preached non-violence, forbade Srauta and Smarta rituals, discarded Varnasrama system, created an order for women that resulted in leaving their home and leading the life of nuns. In some versions, the role is assigned to Brhaspati, the preceptor of the Gods who in the guise of their preceptor Sukra deludes the Asuras&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana also has a similar story wherein demons were killed after they abandoned the Vedic religion and embraced Jainism and Buddhism. H.H. Wilson writes on chapter 4.17-18</p>
<p>&#8220;Of heretics, or those who reject the authority of the Vedas: their origin, as described by Vaśisht́ha to Bhíshma: the gods, defeated by the Daityas, praise Vishńu: an illusory being, or Buddha, produced from his body.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Buddha goes to the earth, and teaches the Daityas to contemn the Vedas: his sceptical doctrines: his prohibition of animal sacrifices. Meaning of the term Bauddha. Jainas and Bauddhas; their tenets. The Daityas lose their power, and are overcome by the gods. Meaning of the term Nagna. Consequences of neglect of duty. Story of Śatadhanu and his wife Śaivyá. Communion with heretics to be shunned.&#8221;</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 3.17.35-44 &#8220;…Upon the conclusion of their prayers, the gods beheld the sovereign deity Hari, armed with the shell, the discus, and the mace, riding on Garud́a. Prostrating themselves before him, they addressed him, and said, &#8220;Have compassion upon us, O lord, and protect us, who have come to thee for succour from the Daityas. They have seized upon the three worlds, and appropriated the offerings which are our portion, taking care not to transgress the precepts of the Veda. Although we, as well as they, are parts of thee, of whom all beings consist, yet we behold the world impressed by the ignorance of unity, with the belief of its separate existence. Engaged in the duties of their respective orders, and following the paths prescribed by holy writ, practising also religious penance, it is impossible for us to destroy them. Do thou, whose wisdom is immeasurable, instruct us in some device by which we may be able to exterminate the enemies of the gods.&#8221; <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #000000;">When the mighty Vishńu heard their request, he emitted from his body an illusory form</span>, which he gave to the gods, and thus spake <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">This deceptive vision shall wholly beguile the Daityas, so that, being led astray from the path of the Vedas, they may be put to death; for all gods, demons, or others, who shall be opposed to the authority of the Veda, shall perish by my might</span>, whilst exercised for the preservation of the world. Go then, and fear not: let this delusive vision precede you; it shall this day be of great service unto you, oh gods!&#8221; Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 3.18.1-11 &#8220;PARÁŚARA.&#8211;After this, the great delusion, having proceeded to earth, beheld the Daityas engaged in ascetic penances upon the banks of the Narmadá river; and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">approaching them in the semblance of a naked mendicant, with his head shaven, and carrying a bunch of peacock&#8217;s feathers</span>, he thus addressed them in gentle accents: &#8220;Ho, lords of the Daitya race! wherefor is it that you practise these acts of penance? is it with a view to recompense in this world, or in another?&#8221; &#8220;Sage,&#8221; replied the Daityas, &#8220;we pursue these devotions to obtain a reward hereafter; why should you make such an inquiry?&#8221; &#8220;If you are desirous of final emancipation,&#8221; answered the seeming ascetic, &#8220;attend to my words, for you are worthy of a revelation which is the door to ultimate felicity. The duties that I will teach you are the secret path to liberation; there are none beyond or superior to them: by following them you shall obtain either heaven or exemption from future existence. You, mighty beings, are deserving of such lofty doctrine.&#8221; By such persuasions, and by many specious arguments, did this delusive being mislead the Daityas from the tenets of the Vedas…&#8221; Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>This is a reference to Digambara Jains. Jain saints still carry peacock feathers with their heads shaven and roam naked.</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 3.18.7-14 &#8220;…might be the duty of those who go naked, or who go clothed in much raiment: and so the Daityas were seduced from their proper duties by the repeated lessons of their illusory preceptor, maintaining the equal truth of contradictory tenets; and they were called Arhatas, from the phrase he had employed of &#8220;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Ye are worthy (Arhatha) of this great doctrine;&#8221; that is, of the false doctrines which he persuaded them to embrace</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The foes of the gods being thus induced to apostatize from the religion of the Vedas</span>, by the delusive person sent by Vishńu, became in their turn teachers of the same heresies, and perverted others; and these, again, communicating their principles to others, by whom they were still further disseminated, the Vedas were in a short time deserted by most of the Daitya race…&#8221; Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>And then reference to Buddhist monks is made,</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 3.18.14-26 &#8220;…<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Then the same deluder, putting on garments of a red colour</span>, assuming a benevolent aspect, and speaking in soft and agreeable tones, addressed others of the same family, and said to them, &#8220;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">If; mighty demons, you cherish a desire either for heaven or for final repose, desist from the iniquitous massacre of animals (for sacrifice)</span>, and hear from me what you should do. Know that all that exists is composed of discriminative knowledge. Understand my words, for they have been uttered by the wise. This world subsists without support, and engaged in the pursuit of error, which it mistakes for knowledge, as well as vitiated by passion and the rest, revolves in the straits of existence.&#8221; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">In this manner, exclaiming to them, &#8220;Know!&#8221; (Budhyadwam), and they replying, &#8220;It is known&#8221; (Budhyate), these Daityas were induced by the arch deceiver to deviate from their religious duties (and become Bauddhas)</span>, by his repeated arguments and variously urged persuasions, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">When they had abandoned their own faith, they persuaded others to do the same</span>, and the heresy spread, and many deserted the practices enjoined by the Vedas and the laws. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The delusions of the false teacher paused not with the conversion of the Daityas to the Jaina and Bauddha heresies, but with various erroneous tenets he prevailed upon others to apostatize</span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">until the whole were led astray, and deserted the doctrines and observances inculcated by the three Vedas</span>. Some then spake evil of the sacred books; some blasphemed the gods; some treated sacrifices and other devotional ceremonies with scorn; and others calumniated the Brahmans. &#8220;The precepts,&#8221; they cried, &#8220;that lead to the injury of animal life (as in sacrifices) are highly reprehensible. To say that casting butter into flame is productive of reward, is mere childishness. If Indra, after having obtained godhead by multiplied rites, is fed upon the wood used as fuel in holy fire, he is lower than a brute, which feeds at least upon leaves. If an animal slaughtered in religious worship is thereby raised to heaven, would it not be expedient for a man who institutes a sacrifice to kill his own father for a victim…&#8221; Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 3.18.30-36 &#8220;…By such and similar lessons the Daityas were perverted, so that not one of them admitted the authority of the Vedas. When the Daityas had thus declined from the path of the holy writings, the deities took courage, and gathered together for battle. Hostilities accordingly were renewed, but the demons were now defeated and slain by the gods, who had adhered to the righteous path. The armour of religion, which had formerly protected the Daityas, had been discarded by them, and upon its abandonment followed their destruction. Thus, Maitreya, you are to understand that those who have seceded from their original belief are said to be naked, because they have thrown off the garment of the Vedas…&#8221; Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 3.18.49-50 &#8220;…Let therefore a prudent person carefully avoid the conversation, or the contact, and the like, of those heretics who are rendered impure by their desertion of the three Vedas. The ancestral rite, although performed with zeal and faith, pleases neither gods nor progenitors if it be looked upon by apostates…&#8221; Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Killing those who left Shaivite Hinduism and embraced Buddhism</span></p>
<p>Shiva Purana, RudraSamhita 2, Yuddha Khanda section 5, chapter 6, verses 28 &#8220;O lord, favourably disposed towards your devotees, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">those Asuras have resorted to Buddha&#8217;s religion</span> and philosophy, thanks to our good fortune and hence they have eschewed all Vedic sacred rites.[36-37] Shiva said:- But the great Asuras are my firm devotees. They shall be killed only by me, for they have been forced to abandon their excellent virtue under false persuasion. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Let Visnu or any one else slay them now that they have been made to abandon their Dharma</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The Asuras of the three cities have become devoid of devotion to me</span>.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>So demons couldn&#8217;t be killed because they followed the Vedic path. If demons committed sins then why weren&#8217;t they killed? Why was there a need to convert them to Buddhism and Jainism? Does being a Hindu makes one immune to all sins? If demons got power from the Vedic religion then why didn&#8217;t Hindu gods from whom the religion emanates stop it? Vishnu in Vishnu Purana 3.17.42-44 clearly says that those being led astray from the path of the Vedas shall be put to death. This one sentence of Vishnu is enough to prove the point that they were killed only because of their apostatizing from Vedic religion. Vishnu Purana book 3 chapter 18 even says that those Daityas who embraced Buddhism and Jainism and also persuaded others to do the same were led astray, meaning they followed the false religion.</p>

<h2><a id="blasphemy"></a>Blasphemy</h2>
<p>Seems like Hindu gods didn&#8217;t like to hear criticism. There are references to the punishment of blasphemers in this world and hereafter for censuring gods, Vedas, Puranas, and even for censuring Brahmins. Krishna said,</p>
<p>Gita 16.18-20 &#8220;Bewildered by false ego, strength, pride, lust and anger, the demons become envious of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is situated in their own bodies and in the bodies of others, and <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">blaspheme against the real religion</span>. Those who are envious and mischievous, who are the lowest among men, I perpetually cast into the ocean of material existence, into various demoniac species of life. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Attaining repeated birth amongst the species of demoniac life</span>.&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Gita 9.11-12 &#8220;Fools deride Me when I descend in the human form. They do not know My transcendental nature as the Supreme Lord of all that be. Those who are thus bewildered are attracted by demonic and atheistic views. In that deluded condition, their hopes for liberation, their fruitive activities, and their culture of knowledge are all defeated.&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Kurma Purana I.16.168b-170a &#8220;Those who consider Visnu as the unmanifest Atman and who are endowed with faith, but who worship Isana with a different vision (i.e. regard him as different from Visnu) are not my beloved ones. Those deluded persons who hate the creator of the world are roasted and cooked in Raurava and other hells and are not released there from even after hundreds and crores of kalpas.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Krishna Janma Khanda 40.116-141 &#8220;&#8230;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">A sinner who slanders Brahma, the creator of the world, the goddess Durga who is the best of female deities, Laksmi, Saraswati, Sita, Tulsi, Ganga, the Vedas, the mother of the Vedas, a vow, devotion, mystic formula pertaining to worship of the spiritual guide who gives formula will dwell in the hell called the &#8216;Blind well&#8217; for half the period of the longevity allotted to Brahma, where bitten by snakes he will scream dreadfully</span>. Whoever slanders Lord Harisikesa Visnu, literally, lord of senses) regarding him as an ordinary god or talks ill of the Puranas (which engender faith in Hair and are more praiseworthy than the S&#8217;rutis) or blames the cow herdess, Raddha, who sprang out of half of the body of Krisna or the ever-adorable Brahmins must dwell in the hell called Avatoda so long as Brahma exists. He dwells there with his feet upwards and face downwards surrounded by snakes. There, bitten by fearful snakes, he screams horribly and oppressed by hunger, he consumes saliva, ordure and urine. Then the fearful myrmidons of Yama in anger thrust torches into his mouth, chastise him in the morning, noon and evening, storm and thunder. He is then very much frightened and with the torments caused by beating he is rendered thirsty and drinks urine to quench his thrust.&#8221; Tr. Rajendra Nath Sen.</p>
<p>Padma Purana IV.17.14-18 &#8220;Formerly in Tretayuga there was a sinful brahmana by name Sudarsana. O best brahmana, on the day of (i.e. sacred to) Visnu he would always eat (food, i.e. would not observe a fast). He always censured the sacred texts and always condemned the vows&#8230;O brahmana, when once the time of death arrived, he died. The messengers of Yama came (to his place), and binding him they took him to Yama&#8217;s abode&#8230;[22-28] Suta said: O brahmana, then, by Yama&#8217;s order his terrible messengers threw him into faeces (where he remained) for more than a hundred ages of Manu. Freed from there he became (i.e. was born as) a village pig on the earth. For a long time he would remain in hell due to his having eaten food on the day of (i.e. sacred to) Visnu&#8230;&#8221; Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p>Kurma Purana II.16.16 &#8220;One should not even mentally think of those people who censure the Vedas, Devas and the Brahmanas.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Skanda Purana V.ii.68.24-33 &#8220;&#8230;Those who commit breach of trust, those who have sex with other men&#8217;s wives and those who speak ill of the Vedas, attain the state of Pisaca. Men who always decry the Puranas and Dharmasastras and who calumniate others become Pisacas&#8230;&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare<br />
Pisacas means ghosts.</p>
<p>Skanda Purana I.iii(U).5.23 &#8220;A person with malice towards Visnu shall become a lizard and one who is malicious to Siva shall become a mouse.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Skanda Purana IV.ii.74.120 &#8220;Those who censure Mahadeva, those senseless ones who censures the holy spot and those who censure the Purana, should never be talked to.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Skanda Purana IV.ii.75.&#8221;A deluded fool engaged in censuring Siva, a censurer of Saivite scriptures- there is no expiation for him. No such redemption is seen in any scripture by anyone. He who performs the act of censuring Siva should be known as a soul-killer, a murderer of the three worlds. He is baser than the basest. He should not be talked to. Those who are engaged in censuring Siva in the midst of the devotees of Siva, fall into the terrible hell as long as the Sun and the Moon (shine).&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Ramcharitmanas, Uttarakanda, Chopai 130, verse 12 A reviler of Lord Hara and his own preceptor takes the form of a frog (after his death) and his birth in that form is repeated a thousand times. A reviler of the Brāhmaṇas, after suffering tortures in a number of hells, is born on earth in the form of a crow.</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Vidyesvarasamhita 1.24.45-46 &#8220;Fie upon the forehead that is devoid of ash. Fie upon the village that has no Siva temple. Fie upon that life that does not worship Siva. Fie upon the lore that does not refer to Siva. Great indeed is the sin accruing even from the sight of those who censure Siva who is the support of three worlds and those who censure the man wearing Tripundra on his forehead. They are on a par with pigs of rubbish, demons, donkeys, dogs, jackals and worms. Such sinful persons are hellish fiends even from their verse birth.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Padma Purana V.20.39-44 &#8220;&#8230;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Those sinners who (even) once censure the salagrama stone, are cooked in the Kumbhipaka (hell) till deluge</span>.

<p>Vamana Purana 12.3-4 &#8220;Those who always censure the Vedas, gods and the Brahmanas, and the sinners who do not respect the teachings of the Puranas and Itihasas, those who find fault with their preceptors, those who hinder the performance of sacrifices, those who prevent donor from making gifts &#8211; all fall in these hells.&#8221; Tr. Anand Swarup Gupta</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Uma Samhita 5.10.21-23 &#8220;Red-hot three pointed iron rods are thrust and pushed through the chest, neck, tongue, tooth-joints, palate, lips, nostrils and all the limb-joints of those persons who slander and censure the noble-preacher of virtue, devotees of the gods, fire-god and preceptor as well as the eternal scriptural texts.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Mahabharata Vana Parva 3.31 &#8220;A rejector of proofs, a slanderer of the interpretation of the Vedic scriptures, a transgressor urged by lust and covetousness, that fool goeth to hell.&#8221; Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Kurma Purana II.34.87-89 &#8220;If one spits at or reviles in front of Devas and the sages, one should burn one&#8217;s tongue by means of a firebrand. Gold too should be given as gift. If any Brahmana passes urine in the garden of Devas (i.e. in the precincts of shrines) even for once, his penis should be cut off for the sake of expiation and he should perform Candrayana rite. If out of delusion, an excellent Brahmana passes urine in the sanctum sanctorum of a temple; his penis should be cut off. He should perform the Candayana rite.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Brahma Purana Gautami Mahatmya 100.44-46 &#8220;The Vaiya said: I think that Dharma (Virtue) is the greatest thing. You can do whatever you please. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The sinner who censures brahmin, preceptors, Devas, Vedas, Dharma and Visnu should not be touched</span>.

<p>Brahma Purana 105.40-45 &#8220;&#8230;All these have death under delusion-the perjuror, he who tells lies, he who kills others and he who censures the Vedas. The attendants of Yama are terrible. They have putrid odour. They have massive iron clubs in their hands. These persons are wicked in their designs. When they appear in front of him the dead man begins to tremble.

<p>Kurma Purana II.16.38-40 &#8220;…One should scrupulously avoid blaspheming Devas and the Vedas.

<p>Ramcharitmanas, Uttarakanda, Chopai 120, verse 13 “Those conceited persons who revile the gods and the Vedas are cast into the hell known as Raurava.

<p>Skanda Purana I.iii(U).5.17-18 &#8220;Sinners are made to bear heavy burdens by the messengers of Yama. A Brahmana-slayer shall be (reborn as) a tuberculosis patient&#8230;He who censures the VEdas shall become a Candala.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 2.7.11-13 “…and he who is disrespectful to his spiritual guide, who is abusive to his betters, who reviles the Vedas, or who sells them, who associates with women in a prohibited degree, into the Lavańa (salt) hell…” Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 1.6.29-31 &#8220;Those, however, in whose hearts the dross of sin derived from Time (Kála) was still more developed, assented not to sacrifices, but reviled both them and all that resulted from them, the gods, and the followers of the Vedas. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Those abusers of the Vedas, of evil disposition and conduct, and seceders from the path of enjoined duties, were plunged in wickedness</span>… [36-41] For those who neglect their duties, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">who revile the Vedas, and obstruct religious rites, the places assigned after death are the terrific regions of darkness, of deep gloom, of fear, and of great terror; the fearful hell of sharp swords, the hell of scourges and of a waveless sea</span>.” Tr.

<p>Garuda Purana 4.5-12 &#8220;…Those who despise places of pilgrimage, good men, good actions, teachers and Shining Ones; those who disparage the Purāṇas, the Vedas, the Mīmāṁsā, the Nyāya and the Vedānta…&#8221; Tr. Ernest Wood and S.V. Subrahmanyam</p>
<p>Sins that are equal to Brahmin-slaughter</p>
<p>Brahma Purana, Gautami-Mahatmya 94.35 &#8220;He who out of hatred censures Devas, Vedas, spiritual learning and the assemblage of virtuous brahmins shall be a brahmin-slayer.&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana 2.3.19.59b-60 &#8220;One who censures and reviles at yogins, meditators and those who desire Moksa, shall fall into a terrible hell.

<p>Markandeya Purana 14.43-44 &#8220;&#8230;Those who have repeated the S&#8217;astra improperly; those who have given utterance to an evil word; those who have blasphemed the Veda, the gods, the dvijas and their guru; for so many year terrible bird with adamant beaks tear out those men&#8217;s very tongues as they are continually reproduced.&#8221;</p>
<p>Markandeya Purana 14.63-64 &#8220;And base men who have hearkened to blasphemy against gurus, the gods, and dvijas, and against the Vedas,-these servants of Yama continually drive iron wedges, red as fire, into the ears, of such wicked men who rejoice in such things though they bewail the while Whoever, led by anger and covetousness, have broken up and destroyed beautiful rest-houses, the abodes of gods and brahmanas, and assemblages in the temple of the gods,-Yama&#8217;s exceedingly cruel servants continually flay the skins of those men from their body by means of these sharp instruments.&#8221;</p>
<h3><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Examples</span></strong></h3>
<p>Parvati commands Hindus to kill the person who revils Shiva,</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Rudrasamhita 2, Parvatikhanda Section III.28.38-39 &#8220;[Parvati said] A person who disparages Siva is definitely worthy of being killed by Siva&#8217;s attendants. If it is a brahmin he must be dismissed or the hearer shall go away from that place immediately. This wicked man will again disparage Siva. Since he is a brahmin, he is not to be killed. He shall be abandoned. He shall not be seen at all.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 4.4.17-18 &#8220;Satī continued: If one hears an irresponsible person blaspheme the master and controller of religion, one should block his ears and go away if unable to punish him. But if one is able to kill, then one should by force cut out the blasphemer&#8217;s tongue and kill the offender, and after that one should give up his own life. Therefore I shall no longer bear this unworthy body, which has been received from you, who have blasphemed Lord Śiva. If someone has taken food which is poisonous, the best treatment is to vomit.&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Swami Prabhupada wrote &#8220;The answer to that argument is that Satī was not vilifying but defending. If possible she should have cut out Dakṣa&#8217;s tongue because he blasphemed Lord Śiva. In other words, since Lord Śiva is the protector of religion, a person who vilifies him should be killed at once, and after killing such a person, one should give up one&#8217;s life. That is the process, but because Dakṣa happened to be the father of Satī, she decided not to kill him but to give up her own life in order to compensate for the great sin she had committed by hearing blasphemy of Lord Śiva. The instruction set forth here in Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam is that one should not tolerate at any cost the activities of a person who vilifies or blasphemes an authority. If one is a brāhmaṇa he should not give up his body because by doing so he would be responsible for killing a brāhmaṇa…&#8221; <strong>Swami Prabhupada on Srimad Bhagavatam 4.4.17</strong> <a href="http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_4.4.17" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_4.4.17<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>Brahmins killed a King named Vena for blasphemeing Vishnu,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 4.14.30-35 &#8220;My dear Vidura, all good fortune unto you. The foolish King, who thought himself very learned, thus insulted the great sages, and the sages, being broken hearted by the King&#8217;s words, became very angry at him. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">All the great saintly sages immediately cried: Kill him! Kill him</span>! He is the most dreadful, sinful person. If he lives, he will certainly turn the whole world into ashes in no time. The saintly sages continued: This impious, impudent man does not deserve to sit on the throne at all. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">He is so shameless that he even dared insult the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Viṣṇu. But for King Vena, </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">who is simply inauspicious, who would blaspheme the Supreme Personality of Godhead</span>, by whose mercy one is awarded all kinds of fortune and opulence? The great sages, thus manifesting their covert anger, immediately decided to kill the King. King Vena was already as good as dead due to his blasphemy against the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus without using any weapons, the sages killed King Vena simply by high-sounding words. After all the sages returned to their respective hermitages, the mother of King Vena, Sunīthā, became very much aggrieved because of her son&#8217;s death. She decided to preserve the dead body of her son by the application of certain ingredients and by chanting mantras [mantra-yogena].&#8221; Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>This is the same King Vena who embraced Jainism.</p>
<p>Some foolish minorities in India blame politicians for communal clashes, saying that they do it for elections. It&#8217;s somehow true, but Hindus don&#8217;t think like that. I haven&#8217;t seen any Hindu blaming politicians for communal clashes rather he will directly abuse the religion and blame the entire community. When dealing with the saffronized textbook, minorities say that Britishers deliberately distorted history as part of their Divide and Rule policy. But Hindus don&#8217;t say that. It were not politicians or Britishers who commanded Hindu rulers like Pushyamitra, Kinnara, Shashanka, Chola kings, etc to kill Jains and Buddhists, it were not politicians or the Britshers who ordered Hindu scholars like Adi Shankaracharya and Kumarila Bhatta to insult Jainism and Buddhism and persecute their followers, from the persecution of Buddhists and Jains, killing nearly a million Muslims in post-Independce riots, 1984 Anti-Sikh riots, pulling down the mosque, numerous riots where Muslims were targeted, anti-Christian Kandhamal riots, vandalization of Churches and Mosques, numerous hate speeches against minorities by Hindu leaders, there is something common. All these drew inspiration from the hate preached by their religion. I may sound like a Hindutvadi because I am speaking in their language that&#8217;s because I am responding to them in the language they understand the most.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Written by Sulaiman Razvi</p>
<p>Caste system is one of the evils of Hindu religion that still exists in the society. Caste system is nothing but isolating the low castes from the society. It divides people within the Hindu fold. The condition of low caste people has been miserable. Low castes people suffered the Brahminical oppression. The Untouchables were not allowed within the gates of Pune city under the reign of Peshwas and Marathas. In Gujarat the Untouchables were forced to wear horns. In Bombay they were not allowed to wear clean and untorn clothes. Read the article <a href="/index.php/2014/01/01/manu-and-shudras/" data-wpel-link="internal">Manu and the Shudras</a> for more information on the condition of low castes in ancient India. Low caste women were not allowed to cover their breasts. This was abolished by Tipu Sultan. But was again reinforced after his death. In the 18<sup>th</sup> century, Low caste women lead <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channar_revolt" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Channar revolt<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> which resulted in many low caste Hindus converting to Christianity. Oppression by Brahmins made low castes people embrace other faiths especially Islam. Swami Vivekananda wrote,</p>
<p><span id="more-2274"></span></p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p>“Why amongst the poor of India so many are Mohammedans? It is nonsense to say, they were converted by the sword. It was to gain their liberty from the . . . zemindars and from the . . . priest” <a href="http://www.ramakrishnavivekananda.info/vivekananda/volume_8/epistles_fourth_series/034_diwanji.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">[ Source ]<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p></blockquote>
<p>Islam came in India as a savior to the low castes. The low castes were attracted towards the equality given in Islam unlike Hinduism which discriminated people based on their birth. Although the Indian constitution guarantees equal right to every citizen irrespective of religion or caste. The menace of caste system still exists in India. A temple was washed after Bihar chief minister Jitan Ram Manjhi visited it [<a href="http://ibnlive.in.com/news/temple-was-washed-after-i-visited-it-says-bihar-cm-jitan-ram-manjhi/502685-3-232.html" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">1<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>], Dalits threatened the priests that they will convert to Islam if they are prohibited from entering the temple [<a href="http://www.firstpost.com/india/ghar-wapsi-fallout-meet-our-demands-else-well-convert-to-islam-say-dalits-2039485.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">2<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>], a Dalit man was set afire for fetching water at a hand pump [<a href="http://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/dalit-villager-set-afire-for-fetching-water-at-hand-pump-in-mp-s-sagar-dist/article1-1352018.aspx" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">3<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>], another Dalit man was killed for ringtone praising Dr. B.R.

<p>The National Human Rights Commission Report on the Prevention of Atrocities against Scheduled Castes says that, “every 18 minutes a crime is committed against a Dalit. Every day 3 Dalit women are raped, 2 Dalits are murdered and 2 Dalits Houses are burnt in India, 11 Dalits are beaten. Every week: 13 Dalits are murdered, 5 Dalits home or possessions are burnt, 6 Dalits are kidnapped or abducted.”</p>

<p>“…in 27.6% of India’s villages, Dalits are prevented from entering police stations. In 25.7% of the country’s villages, Dalits are prevented from entering ration shops. In 35% of villages, Dalits are barred from selling produce in local markets. In 47% of villages with milk cooperatives, Dalits are prevented from selling milk, and in 25% of such villages, they are prevented from buying milk altogether.</p>
<p>Further, according to official Indian crime statistics, 27 atrocities against Dalits are committed every day. 13 Dalits are murdered every week. 3 Dalit women are raped every day. A crime is committed against a Dalit every 18 minutes. This, despite the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989. Worse, these crimes are on the rise. According to data released by NACDOR, a total of 3,198 cases related to atrocities on dalits have been registered between 2004 and 2013 as against 1,305 from 1994 to 2003. These crimes rose by another 19 percent in 2014. According to statistics compiled by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), crimes against SCs rose to 47,064 in 2014 from 39,408 in 2013. In 2012 there were 33,655 crimes against dalits, about the same as in 2011…”</p>

<p>There have been thousands of caste related violence in India, you can refer to Wikipedia’s article <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caste-related_violence_in_India" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Caste-related violence in India<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. All these caste based violence perpetrated by higher caste people is wholly inspired by religious doctrine. Hindu god Rama is said to have beheaded a Shudra named Shambuka just because he was practising religious rite. With such kind of stories is sure to inspire radicals. Some apologists try to show that there is no caste system in Hinduism, that it is actually is based on profession one acquires. I would have appreciated their effort if they really wanted to emancipate the low castes. But there is actually a motive behind it. Politicians try to befriend Dalits only to garner votes and to use low caste people in riots. While religious leaders do it to get as many followers as they can, because more followers means more donations and popularity. One such Hindu reformer was Dayanand Saraswati who said that Veda treats all castes alike. But he said this only to get followers. He didn’t abolish the caste system, but upheld the caste system. He discriminated between the castes. He opined that the duty of a Shudra is to serve the Dvijas and held Manu Smriti has authoritative text, read the article <a href="/index.php/2014/05/01/mulshankar-and-casteism/" data-wpel-link="internal">Mulshankar and Casteism</a> for more information. Hindu terror organizations conducts Ghar Wapsi programs, rallies against minorities but they never conduct any event or program for the betterment of the low caste Hindus. Purusha Sukta is said to be the root of caste system in Hinduism, it is mentioned in Veda,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.90.12 The Brahman was his mouth, of both his arms was the Rājanya made. His thighs became the Vaiśya, from his feet the Śūdra was produced.<br />

<h1>Birth based caste system</h1>
<p>As we all know, caste system in Hinduism is birth based and not based on the profession acquired by the individual.</p>
<p>Apastamba Dharma Shastra 1.1.1.4-5 [There are] four castes Brahmana, Kshatriyas, Vaishya, and Shudra. Among these, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">each preceding (caste) is superior by birth</span> to the one following.</p>
<p>Mahabharata 13.143.6 “The illustrious one said, ‘The status of a Brahmana, O goddess, is exceedingly difficult to attain. O auspicious lady, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">one becomes a Brahmana through original creation or birth</span>. After the same manner the Kshatriya, the Vaisya, and the Sudra, all become so through original creation.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Kisari Mohan Ganguli writes,</p>
<p>”Nisargat is literally through creation or original nature, or birth. Of course, what is implied is that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">one becomes a Brahmana, or Kshatriya, or Vaisya or Sudra, through original creation as such, by the Self-born, that is, birth</span>.” [ <a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m13/m13b108.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Source<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> ]
<p>Narada Purana I.24.7-9 “Those castes are said to be four, viz., the Brahmans, Ksatriyas, Vaisyas and Sudras. Among these the Brahmana is the foremost. The Brahmanas, Ksatriyas and Vaisyas- these three are called Dvijas (the twice-born), because at first they are born of their mothers and later on, they are consecrated by means of sacred thread with due repetition of the Mantras (which constitute the second birth). <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Thus twice-born-ness is attained by these three classes</span>. All holy rites and duties must be performed by these castes in accordance with the specific duties prescribed for their castes. By failing to perform the holy duties prescribed for one’s own caste, one is called a heretic by learned men.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>It is mentioned in Bhagavat Purana,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 11.5.5 “But Brahmanas, Ksattriyas and Vaisyas, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">by virtue of their original birth</span>, and second birth through their Upanayana (investiture of the sacred thread) ceremony (become eligible for studies, performance of sacrifices, etc.)…” Tr. G.V. Tagare, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Manu 10.5 In all castes (varna) those (children) only which are begotten in the direct order on wedded wives, equal (in caste and married as) virgins, are to be considered as <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">belonging to the same caste (as their fathers</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">)</span>.</p>
<p>Acharya Medhatithi writes on Manu Smriti 2.148</p>
<p>“Jati stands for ‘Janma’, birth.”</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Uma Samhita 44.13 ”O excellent sage, birth as a man is very difficult to obtain; especially that as a Brahmin…” Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Padma Purana II.38.20b-24 “[The Sages said:] The three castes viz. brahmanas, ksatriyas and vaissyas are twice born. This (i.e. the Veda) is an ancient sacred text meant for all the castes. The beings behave according to the Vedic practices; therefor they (continue to) live. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">You are born in the family of Brahman. (So) you are a brahmana only</span>.” Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>Agni Purana 162.3-7 “…By reading the Vedas and practicing equally to all, a man enters the region of paradise. This is the prerogative of the twice born castes, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">specifically belonging to a Brahamana as his birth right</span>, as he might read the Vedas and realise the truths inculcated therein by living any of the four orders of life. A Brahmana by dwelling in this world, may attain the Supreme Brahma.” Tr. M.N. Dutt-</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>Vasistha Dharma Shastra 4.1-3 <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The four castes are distinguished by their origin</span> and by particular sacraments. There is also the following passage of the Veda, ‘The Brâhmana was his mouth, the Kshatriya formed his arms, the Vaisya his thighs; the Sûdra was born from his feet.’ <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">It has been declared in (the following passage of) the Veda that (a Sûdra) shall not receive the sacraments</span>, ‘He created the Brâhmana with the Gâyatrî (metre), the Kshatriya with the Trishtubh, the Vaisya with the Gagatî, the Sûdra without any metre.’</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>Mahabharata 13.27.3-6 “O best of kings, how may one, if he happens to be a Kshatriya or a Vaisya or a Sudra, succeed in acquiring the status of a Brahmana? It behoveth thee to tell me the means. Is it by penances the most austere, or by religious acts, or by knowledge of the scriptures, that a person belonging to any of the three inferior orders succeeds in acquiring the status of a Brahmana? Do tell me this, O grandsire!’ “Bhishma said, ‘The status of a Brahmana, O Yudhishthira, is incapable of acquisition by a person belonging to any of the three other orders. That status is the highest with respect to all creatures. Travelling through innumerable orders of existence, by undergoing repeated births, one at last, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">in some birth, becomes born as a Brahmana</span>.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>Skanda Purana clearly states that a Shudra must not study, must not sacrifice, he has to stay in the same state as at birth which is contrary to what apologists claim that a Shudra by studying Veda becomes a Brahmin,</p>
<p>Skanda Purana V.iii.122.16 ”A separate duty has not been assigned by Paramesthin to the Sudra. He need not have any Mantra, consecration or pursuit of lores. He need not have any conventional study of the science of words (i.e. Grammar) and special worship of deities. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">He has to be, day and night, in the same state as at birth</span>.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 10.3 <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">On account of his pre-eminence, on account of the superiority of his origin</span>, on account of his observance of (particular) restrictive rules, and on account of his particular sanctification <span style="color: #ff0000;">the Brahmana is the lord of (all) castes (varna)</span>.</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 1.98-99 <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The very birth of a Brahmana</span> is an eternal incarnation of the sacred law; for he is born to (fulfil) the sacred law, and becomes one with Brahman. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">A Brahmana, coming into existence</span>, is born as the highest on earth, the lord of all created beings, for the protection of the treasury of the law.</p>
<p>Katyayana Samhita 8.6 “Many wives of the same caste and of other castes existing, the rite of churning, for producing the Fire, should be done by the chaste wives of the same caste, on account of the superiority of birth.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Mahabharata, Santi Parva 12 Section 72 “…Matariswan answered, ‘The Brahmana, O best of kings, has sprung from the mouth of Brahman. The Kshatriya has sprung from his two arms, and the Vaisya from his two thighs. For waiting upon these three orders, O ruler of men, a fourth order, viz., the Sudra, sprung into life, being created from the feet (of Brahman). Originally created thus, <span style="color: #ff0000;">the </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Brahmana takes birth</span><span style="color: #ff0000;"> on earth as the lord of all creatures</span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">his duty</span> being the keep of the Vedas and the other scriptures. Then, for ruling the earth and wielding the rod of chastisement and protecting all creatures, the second order, viz., the Kshatriya was created. The Vaisya was created for supporting the two other orders and himself by cultivation and trade, and finally, it was ordained by Brahman that the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sudra should serve the three orders as a menial</span>.’ “Pururavas said, ‘Tell me truly, O god of Winds, to whom, this earth righteously belong. Does it belong to the Brahmana or to the Kshatriya?’ “The god of Winds said, ‘<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Everything that exists in the universe belongs to the Brahmana in consequence of his birth and precedence</span>. Persons conversant with morality say this. What the Brahmana eats is his own. The place he inhabits is his own. What he gives away is his own. He deserves the veneration of all the (other) orders. He is the first-born and the foremost. As a woman, in the absence of her husband, accepts his younger brother for him, even so the earth, in consequence of the refusal of the Brahmana, has accepted his next-born, viz., the Kshatriya, for her lord…” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>

<h2>Caste is based on Karma and caste of parents</h2>
<p>As per Hinduism, a person attains specific caste due to the deeds of past life, Krishna said,</p>
<p>Gita 18.41 “Of Brahmanas, Kshtriyas and Vaishyas, as also the Sudras, O Arjuna, the duties are distributed according to the qualities born of their own nature.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Ramanuja Acharya writes on this verse,</p>
<p>”The character of Brahmanas, Ksatriyas, Vaishyas, and Sudras arise from their various inherent dispositions. In other words their past Karma is the cause of their being born in a specific social group…”</p>
<p>Swami Swarupananda writes on Gita 18.41,</p>
<p>“According to the Karma or habits and tendencies formed by desire, action, and association in the past life manifesting themselves in the present as effects. Or, nature (Svabhava) may here mean the Maya made up of three Gunas, the Prakriti of the Lord”</p>
<p>It is mentioned in Brahma Vaivarta Purana,</p>
<p>Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Krishna Janma Khanda 74.10 ”According to Karma, some go to heaven or are severally born in the houses of a Brahmin, Ksatriya, Vaisya or a Sudra.” Tr. Rajnedra Nath Sen</p>
<p>Chandogya Upanishad 5.10.7. ‘Those whose conduct has been good, will quickly attain some good birth, the birth of a Brahmana, or a Kshatriya, or a Vaisya. But those whose conduct has been evil, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">will quickly attain an evil birth, the birth of a dog, or a hog, or a Kandala</span>.” Tr. Swami Nikhilanda</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><strong>CHILD BORN TO PARENTS OF DIFFERENT CASTES</strong></p>
<p>A Brahmin couple begets a Brahmin child, a Shudra couple begets a Shudra child.</p>
<p>Mahbharata 13.48 The Brahmana may take four wives, one from each of the four orders. In two of them (viz.,the wife taken from his own order and that taken from the one next below), he takes birth himself (the children begotten upon them being regarded as invested with the same status as his own)… A Kshatriya may take three wives… The Vaisya may take two spouses…<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The Sudra can take only one wife, viz., she that is taken from his own order. The son begotten by him upon her becomes a Sudra</span>….</p>
<p>But if parents belong to different caste then the child will not belong to either his mother or father’s caste,</p>
<p>Manu 10.5 In all castes (varna) those (children) only which are begotten in the direct order on wedded wives, equal (in caste and married as) virgins, are to be considered as <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">belonging to the same caste (as their fathers</span>).</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti 16.1-3 Sons [begotten] on women equal in caste [to their husbands] are equal in caste [to their fathers]. [Sons begotten] on women of lower castes, become of the caste of their mothers. Sons begotten on women of higher castes are despised by the twice-born.</p>
<p>Agni Purana 150.9-11 ”The duties which appertain to the Shudra caste, O thou best of the Bhrigus, are to serve the Brahmins and to practice the handicrafts. Since the investiture with the holy thread, a member of the twice born caste is supposed to take a second spiritual birth, and I shall describe the castes which children born of parents not members of the same caste, would respectively belong to. A child born of parents belonging to different castes would get the caste of its mother, but on the contrary a child born of a Shudra father by a Brahmin mother would be a Chandala.” Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 10.6. Sons, begotten by twice-born man on wives of the next lower castes, they declare to be similar (to their fathers, but) blamed on account of the fault (inherent) in their mothers.</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 10.16 From a Sudra spring in the inverse order (by females of the higher castes) three base-born (sons, apasada), an Ayogava, a Kshattri, and a Kandala, the lowest of men;</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>Manu Smriti 10.6-23 gives a list of castes that springs up due to inter-caste marriage. It is mentioned in Yajnavalkya,</p>
<p>Yajnavalkya Smriti verse 90 <span style="text-decoration: underline;">By men of the same caste (Varna) in women of the same caste (Varna) are born sajati (sons of equal birth or caste)</span>. In blameless marriages sons (are begotten continuing the line.</p>
<p>Like Manu, Yajnavalkya also goes on mentioning the list of castes from verse 91. However this system mentioned may not be applicable in the case of Niyoga. Because all men of Kshatriya caste were killed so the Kshatriya ladies went to Brahmins for contracting Niyoga and their son were considered Kshatriyas,</p>
<p>Mahabharata “1.104 And the illustrious scion of Bhrigu’s race, by means of his swift arrows annihilated the Kshatriya tribe one and twenty times. “And when the earth was thus deprived of Kshatriyas by the great Rishi, the Kshatriya ladies all over the land had offspring raised by Brahmanas skilled in the Vedas. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">It has been said in the Vedas that the sons so raised belongeth to him that had married the mother</span>. And the Kshatriya ladies went in unto the Brahamanas not lustfully but from motives of virtue. Indeed, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">it was thus that the Kshatriya race was revived</span>.”” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Sons born to father of higher caste (like Brahmin) are considered to be Brahmin in quality only, though of low caste than their father. It is mentioned in Manu Smriti,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 10.67-69 The decision is as follows: ‘He who was begotten by an Aryan on a non-Aryan female, may become (like to) an Aryan by his virtues; <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">he whom an Aryan (mother) bore to a non-Aryan father (is and remains) unlike to an Aryan</span>.’ The law prescribes that neither of the two shall receive the sacraments, the first (being excluded) on account of the lowness of his origin, the second (because the union of his parents was) against the order of the castes. As good seed, springing up in good soil, turns out perfectly well, even so <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">the son of an Aryan by an Aryan woman is worthy of all the sacraments</span>.</p>
<p>Some scholars interpret the ‘Sacraments’ here as minor sacrifice like Pakayajna which can be performed by low caste also. It is mentioned in Mahabharata,</p>
<p>Mahabharata 13.48.5 “The son that is begotten by a Brahmana upon a Sudra wife is called Parasara, implying one born of a corpse, for the Sudra woman’s body is as inauspicious as a corpse. He should serve the persons of his (father’s) race. Indeed, it is not proper for him to give up the duty of service that has been laid down for him.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>So this is yet another proof that caste is based on birth in a particular family, If a baby is born in a Brahmin family then he is a Brahmin but if he is born to a Shudra parents then he is Shudra by default which is his permanent caste for entire lifetime.</p>

<p>Mahabharata 12.188.5 “The complexion the Brahmanas obtained was white; that which the Kshatriyas obtained was red; that which the Vaisyas got was yellow; and that which was given to the Sudras was black.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Mahbharata 9.38.1-2 “Vaishampayana said, &#8220;Then Valadeva, O king, proceeded to Vinasana where the Sarasvati hath become invisible in consequence of her contempt for Sudras and Abhiras. And since the Sarasvati, in consequence of such contempt, is lost at that spot, the Rishis, for that reason, O chief of the Bharatas, always name the place as Vinasana.” Tr. Kisari Mohan Ganguli</p>
<p>Swami Prabhupada the founder of ISKCON said that Shudra must not be given freedom and must not be treated equally.</p>
<p>Swami Prabhupada said, “<em>Śūdra</em> is to be controlled only. They are never given to be freedom. Just like in America. The blacks were slaves. They were under control. And since you have given them equal rights they are disturbing, most disturbing, always creating a fearful situation, uncultured and drunkards. What training they have got? They have got equal right? That is best, to keep them under control as slaves but give them sufficient food, sufficient cloth, not more than that. Then they will be satisfied.” <strong>Room Conversation Varṇāśrama System Must Be Introduced — February 14, 1977, Māyāpura<br />

<p>Swami Prabhupada says Shudras have no brain,</p>
<p>“Sudras [black people] have no brain,” he said. “In America also, the whole [of] America once belonged to the Red Indians. Why they could not improve? The land was there. Why [did] these foreigners, the Europeans, came and improved [it]? So sudras cannot do this. They cannot make any [improvements].”<br />

<p><strong>Greeting a Shudra is prohibited</strong>,</p>
<p>Atri Samhita 1.308 “He, who unknowingly salutes a lowcaste person, should immediately bathe and get [himself] purified by taking clarified butter.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<h2>Speaking with a low caste is prohibited</h2>
<p>Hinduism the so called most tolerant religion prohibits a Dvija to converse with a low caste,</p>
<p>Apastamba Dharma Shastra 2.1.2.8. As it is sinful to touch a Candala, [so it is also sinful] to speak to him or to look at him. The penance for these [offences will be declared].</p>
<p>Usana Samhita Chapter 2, Verse 4-6 “After conversing with a Chandala or a Mlechchha, after talking with abandoned women or with Sudras…drinking or touching urine and excreta, one should rinse his mouth again, even if he has rinsed it once…” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti 71.58-59 “Nor converse with a woman in her flow. Nor with the degraded and low-caste men.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<h2>One shouldn’t even look at the Shudra</h2>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana 14:1:1:31 <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">And whilst not coming into contact with Sûdras</span> and remains of food; for this Gharma is he that shines yonder, and he is excellence, truth, and light; but woman, the Sûdra, the dog, and the black bird (the crow), are untruth: <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">he should not look at these</span>, lest he should mingle excellence and sin, light and darkness, truth and untruth.</p>
<p>Usana Samhita 9.53 “By taking food, out of ignorance, after seeing a Mahapatakin, a Chandala, or a woman in [her] menses, one is purified [by fasting] for three nights.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Parashara Smriti 6.22 Having seen a Chandala, a Brahmana should cast look at the sun; having touched a Chandala a Brahaman should bathe with all his wearing apparels on.</p>
<p>One should avoid journey if one sees a Chandala,</p>
<p>Agni Purana chapter 230 “…A pregnant woman, a widow, drugs such as the Pinyaka, etc., a Chandala, a member of the Shvapacha or any other vile caste, a butcher, or a killer of birds, should be removed from the presence of a man, about to start a journey…” Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Hinduism also says that one should avoid the sight of a person who cooks for Shudra, who burns corpses of Shudra, a Chandala and equates them to bastard, theives etc,</p>
<p>Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Krishna Janma Khanda 78.33-41 “O father, now I am going to describe to you things whose sight is sinful. Bad dream is the root of sin and sole cause of calamity. The sight of the following…the cook of a S’udra, one who burns the corpse of a S’udra, a Brahmin who eats food prepared in connexion with the funerals of a S’udra…a S’udra, a widow, a Candal…a bastard, a thief, a liar…a Brahmin who is the husband of a barren woman, a S’udra who commits adultery with a Brahmin woman…” Tr. Rajendra Nath Sen</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 4.140. Let him not journey too early in the morning, nor too late in the evening, nor just during the midday (heat), nor with an unknown (companion), nor alone, nor with Sudras.</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<h2>Even stepping on Shadow of low caste is prohibited</h2>
<p>Dr. B.R. Ambedkar <a href="/index.php/2014/01/01/manu-and-shudras/" data-wpel-link="internal">wrote</a>, “Under the rule of the Marathas and the Peshwas the Untouchables were not allowed within the gates of Poona city, the capital of the Peshwas between 3 p. m. and 9 a. m. because, before nine and after three, their bodies cast too long a shadow; and whenever their shadow fell upon a Brahmin it polluted him, so that he dare not taste food or water until he had bathed and washed the impurity away. So also no Untouchable was allowed to live in a walled town ; cattle and dogs could freely enter but not the Untouchables.”</p>
<p>Usana Samhita 9.89 “By getting on the shadow of a lowcaste person, one should drink clarified butter after bathing. By looking at the Sun in an impure state, one should recite the Mantram Agnindraja.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Kurma Purana II.34.80 “…On treading the shadow of a Candala, one shall take bath and drink ghee.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><strong>Some other verses about discriminating the low caste</strong></p>
<p>Skanda Purana III.ii.40.63 “The Sudras who become antagonistic to those Brahmanas who were honoured by Brahma, Visnu and Siva go to the Raurava hell.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Narada Purana I.12.12 “Whatever is given in charity to one who habitually partakes of Sudra’s food or to one who cremates the corpses of Sudras or to one who takes food prepared by an unchaste woman, becomes futile.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Narada Purana I.23.26 “The observer of the holy rite should never talk to one who nourishes his progeny through a Sudra woman, to the husband of a Sudra woman and to one who performs sacrifices on behalf of those who are not eligible for the same.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><strong>PROHIBITED FOR A SHUDRA SERVANT TO MAKE WEALTH</strong></p>
<p>Mahabharata 12.60.28-29 “<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">A Sudra should never amass wealth, lest, by his wealth</span>, he makes the members of the three superior classes obedient to him. By this he would incur sin. With the king’s permission, however, a Sudra, for performing religious acts, may earn wealth.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Mahabharata 12.166.8 &#8220;The Shudra is not competent to celebrate a sacrifice. The king should, therefore, take away (wealth for such a purpose) from a Shudra&#8217;s house.&#8221; Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>So a Shudra servant cannot even amass wealth and rather has to seek permission from the king for making wealth.</p>
<p>Mahabharata 12.60.36 “The Sudra should never abandon his master, whatever the nature or degree of the distress into which the latter may fall. If the master loses his wealth, he should with excessive zeal be supported by the Sudra servant<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">. A Sudra cannot have any wealth that is his own</span>. Whatever he possesses belongs lawfully to his master.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 8.417 <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Let a Brahmana unhestitangly appropriate to himself whatever (his) Sudra (Slave) has earned</span>, inasmuch as nothing can be belong to the latter, he being himself an enjoyable good of the Brahmana.</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 10.129 No collection of wealth must be made by a Sudra, even though he be able (to do it); for a Sudra who has acquired wealth, gives pain to Brahmanas.</p>

<h2>Penance for killing a Shudra</h2>
<p>The penance for killing a Shudra is as same as killing animals in many Hindu texts while Manu Smriti prescribes death penalty for killing a Brahmin,</p>
<p>Mahabharata 12.165.56 “Having slain a dog or bear or camel, one should perform the same penance that is laid down for the slaughter of a Sudra.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Agni Purana 169.25-32 “…A man having killed a cat, a mongoose, a frog, a dog, a Godha, an owl, and a crow, should practice the penance he ought to have done, if he had killed a Shudra…” Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Following is the punishment to be meted out to a Shudra if he kills a Brahmin,</p>
<p>Narada Purana I.30.17-18 “On killing an ordinary Brahmana (by birth only who has not studied the Vedas, etc.), he should perform the expiatory rite for one year. O Brahmana, thus the mode of expiating for killing a Brahmana has been stated. The expiation for a Ksatriya is twice this and that for a Vaiya is thrice: Learned men know that the <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Sudra who kills a Brahmana is to be pounded to death with a club</span>.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p><a href="#top" class="broken_link">top</a></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<h2>Touching low castes makes on impure</h2>
<p>Hindu text prohibits a Dvija (Brahmin, Kshatriya &amp; Vaishya) to touch low castes especially Chandalas. And the penance for touching low castes is to consume Panchagavya which is a mixture of five products of cow like Cow Urine, Cow Dung, Milk, Curd and Clarified Butter. Which means that low castes in Hinduism are considered worse than cow dung and urine. There are four castes in Hinduism and there is no fifth caste. Groups like Chandala, Musahar… are outcasts i.e., they are outside the pale of four Varnas. They are called Achoots (Untouchables) in Hinduism. This may be because it is prohibited for Dvijas to touch them. Hindu text mentions Low castes, women in her menses on par with dogs and pigs and states by by touching this a Dvija ought to get cleansed. Hindu text goes on to say that a low caste intentionally touching a high caste person must be put to death,</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti 5.104 If one who (being a member of the Kandala or some other low caste) must not be touched, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">intentionally defiles by his touch</span> one who (as a member of a twice-born caste) may be touched (by other twice-born persons only), <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">he shall be put to death</span></strong>.</p>
<p>Another clear translation,<br />
Vishnu Smriti 5.103 “A man belonging to a caste that is not touched, and willingly touching the three [higher] castes, shall be killed.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Angiras Samhita 1.39 “When [a Brahmana] is touched by a woman in [her menses], <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">by a dog or by a Sudra</span>, he <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">becomes purified by the Panchagavya</span> after fasting for a night.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Angiras Samhita 1.9-10 “If he on any occasion, touched by a Sudra who has not washed his mouth after taking meals, he should bathe and recite [the Gayatri] and shall become purified by [fasting for] half a day. If a Vipra is [similarly] touched by a Vaisya, a dog or a Sudra, he shall after fasting for one night become purified with the Panchagavya” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dath</p>
<p>Parasara Smriti 7.22 “A Brahmana, who touched a dog, or a Sudra before washing his mouth, after eating, should fast for a day, and take the compound known as Panchagavyam in order to recover his cleanness.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Yama Samhita verse 41 “A twice-born person, who has the leavings of food in his mouth, on being touched by such a person, a dog, or a Sudra become purified with the Panchagavya, after fasting for a night.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Apastamba Samhita 5.1-2 “What would be the form of expiatory penance for a twice-born one, who, touched by a Chandala, drinks water before performing an A’chamanam? A Brahmana under the circumstance, should regain his purity by fasting for three nights and by taking Panchagavyam, while the term of the penance is two days only for a Kshatriya, its other factors remaining the same.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Apastamba Samhita 7.5 “A woman in her menses, happened to be touched by a S’vapak or a Chandala, should fast for three nights and recover her purity by taking Panchagavyam, thereafter.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Apastamba Samhita 7.19 “A Brahmana-woman in her menses, happening to be touched by a S’udra woman, similarly circumstanced as herself, should regain her purity by fasting for a whole day and night, and by taking Panchagavyam.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Usana Samhita 8.75 “By touching a Chandala, a woman who has given birth to a Child, a dead body, a woman in [her] menses or those touched by her, or any outcaste, one should bathe for purification. If, out of mistake, one touches an article touched by a Chandala, a woman who has given birth to a child, or a dead body, purification is attained by bathing, rinsing the mouth and [thereafter] reciting the Gayatri.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Atri Samhita 1.263-4 “By touching a Chandala, an outcaste, a Mlechchha, a wine-bowl, or a woman in [her] menses, a twice-born person should not take his meals. If [he is touched by any of these] while taking [his] meals, [he must at once stop.] Thereafter he should not take his meals; and giving up his food, he should bathe. And being commanded by the Brahmanas, he should fast for three nights. And taking Yavaka (food prepared from barley) together with clarified butter, he should complete the sacrifice” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Atri Samhita 1.185 “…if a twice-born person being anointed with oil or clarified butter, touches a Chandala; he should, after fasting for a day and night, purify [himself] with the Panchagavya.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Atri Samhita 1.233 “The foremost of the twice-born, when, having still the leavings of food in his mout, touched by a caste outside [the pale of the recogniged castes], should, after fasting for five nights, get purified with the Panchagavya.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Atri Samhita 1.273 “By being touched by dogs, Chandalas, or crows, a woman in her menses should remain fasting till [the menstrual period] and should get herself purified by bathing in time.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Samvarta Samhita verses 178 “By touching Chandala, an outcaste, a dead-body, a lowcaste, a woman in her menses, and a woman in a state of impurity consequent on child-birth, one should bathe with the cloth on.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Apastamba Samhita Chapter 4 Verse 5 “…While the term of the penance should be extended to six days in case where he might have touched a Chandala before rinsing his mouth with water, after a meal.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Usana Samhita Chapter 5 Verse 30-32 “…One should not touch a person of grim visage, a Mlechchha and a woman in menses.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Angiras Samhita 1.37-38 “One does not become of pure conduct so long as the menstrual flow continues. When the menses is stopped, a woman may be employed in domestic works and known for sexual purpose. On the first day [of the menses], she is a Chandala woman; on the second, she is the murderer of a Brahmana; on the third, she is called a washer-woman; and on the fourth day, she becomes purified.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dath</p>
<p>Narada Purana I.14.2-3 “I shall mention the atonement to the person who, while taking food, touches an impure or a fallen person or a Candala, either out of anger or due to ignorance. Such a person shall perform bath three times a day (trisavana snana) either for three days or for six days. A Brahmana becomes pure by sipping paca-gavya (the five products of the cow taking collectively, viz. milk, curds, clarified butter, urine, and cowdung).” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti 23.41 Mire and water in the ruts on a high road, defiled by the touch of a dog, of a crow, or of a low caste person, as well as buildings constructed of baked bricks are purified by the winds.</p>
<p>Kurma Purana II.34.65 “A Brahmana, while Ucchista (with particles of food in the mouth or on hand) willfully touches Candalas or fallen persons (outcastes) should observe the Prajapatya vow for purification.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Garuda Purana 1.222.20-21 “…A brahmin defiled by the touch of a dog or a Sudra defiled by Ucchista shall fast for a night and drink Pancagayva. He shall become pure. Touched by an outcaste he shall fast for five nights.” Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>

<h1>Torturing the low caste</h1>
<p>Agni Purana 227.21-31 “…a Shudra using force to a Kshatriya should have his tongue cut off. A Shudra who would aspire to give moral instructions to a Brahmana, should be punished by the king…” Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti 5.24 “If one delivers religious instructions with haughtiness, the king shall pour hot oil into his mouth.” Tr. Manmath Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 8.282-3 If out of arrogance he spits (on a superior), the king shall cause both his lips to be cut off; if he urines (on him), the penis; if he breaks wind (against him), the anus. If he lays hold of the hair (of a superior), let the (king) unhesitatingly cut off his hands, likewise (if he takes him) by the feet, the beard, the neck, or the scrotum.</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 8.272. If he arrogantly teaches Brahmanas their duty, the king shall cause hot oil to be poured into his mouth and into his ears.</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 8.270-1 <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">A once-born man (a Sudra), who insults a twice-born man with gross invective, shall have his tongue cut out</span>; for he is of low origin. If he mentions the names and castes (gati) of the (twice-born) with contumely, an iron nail, ten fingers long, shall be thrust red-hot into his mouth.</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 227.73-75 <span style="text-decoration: underline;">“A Sudra should be deprived of his tongue if he abuses violently a twice-born</span>, if his offence be moderate; if his offence be highest, he is to be fined Uttama Sahasa. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">A king should be put a red, hot iron spike twelve Angulas long in the mouth of a Sudra who vilifies violently one, taking his name</span>, caste and house. A Sudra who teaches Dharma to the twice born should also be punished by a sovereign by getting hot oil poured into his ears and mouth.” Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>The irony is that a Shudra is given corporal punishment for abusing Dvijas (Twice-born) while a Brahmin or other castes are not,</p>
<p>Gautama Dharma Shastra 12.11-13 But a Brahmana (who abuses) a Kshatriya (shall pay) fifty (Karshapanas), One half of that (amount if he abuses) a Vaisya, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">(and if he abuses) a Sudra, nothing</span>.</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 227.67-68 ”A Ksatriya who abuses a Brahmana should be fined 100 Panas, a Vaisya doing so should be fined 200 Panas, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">and a Sudra if he does so should be sentenced to capital punishment</span>. A Brahmana who abuses a Ksatriya should be fined 50 Panas, if he abuses a Vaisya, he should be fined 25 Panas <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">and if he abuses a Sudra the fine should be 12 Panas</span>.” Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 8.279-280 With whatever limb a man of a low caste does hurt to (a man of the three) highest (castes), even that limb shall be cut off; that is the teaching of Manu. He who raises his hand or a stick, shall have his hand cut off; he who in anger kicks with his foot, shall have his foot cut off.</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>If a Shudra is accused of committing some crimes, then he should prove his innocence by drinking poison, by means of fire ordeals etc.,</p>
<p>Agni Purana 255.32-47 “The accused should fast and bathe at sunrise with all his clothes on the day of the test, and pass through his ordeal in the presence of the king and the Brahmanas. An old, infant, blind, lame, invalid, or a female accused should be tested with the ordeal by scale, while the innocence of a Shudra, should be ascertained by means of the ordeal by fire, water, or the seven Yava (barley) weights of poison… In the ordeal by fire, the palms of the accused, should be first examined as to whether it had not been plastered over with clay… Then the accused should address the fire god as follows:- ”Thy seat is in the inside of all creatures, O Fire, and thou art the witness of acts of merit and demerit. I have held thee in my palms, speak truth, O god, as a witness of my innocence.” Then a red hot iron ball, weighing fifty Palas should be placed on his palms, covered as above and the accused or the person suspected, should be asked to slowly walk over seven Mandalas or rings… In an ordeal by poison, the accused should first address the poison to be imbibed… Thus having addressed the poison (born of a hill), he should imbibe the same in the presence of the assembled Brahmanas. His innocence should be established, if he could assimilate the poison safely without rethcing or vomiting.” Tr. M.N Dutt</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 9.248. But the king shall inflict on a base-born (Sudra), who intentionally gives pain to Brahmanas, various (kinds of) corporal punishment which cause terror.</p>

<h1>Discrimination on food</h1>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="380" height="276" class="wp-image-8412 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Picture-8.jpeg" alt="https://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/dalits-water-dyuurwlxcaaj6n4.jpeg?w=380&amp;h=276" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Picture-8.jpeg 380w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Picture-8-300x218.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 380px) 100vw, 380px" /></p>
<p>Most of the crimes against Dalits is inspired by Hindu religious texts. There have been numerous cases where Dalit cooks were fired from their job because upper caste Hindus refused to eat food cooked by them, such as <a href="https://www.news18.com/news/india/up-students-refuse-mid-day-meal-prepared-by-lower-caste-cook-school-throws-out-food-after-protest-1871653.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">school children refusing to eat food<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> cooked by a Dalit cook and then threw the food, another <a href="http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-caste-hindu-parents-oppose-dalit-cooking-food-for-their-children-in-a-govt-school-in-tn-2639266" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Dalit cook was fired<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> after caste Hindu parent protested, a <a href="http://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/dalit-man-set-afire-for-fetching-water-at-hand-pump-in-mp/story-uUEGOUJbPUaqPivKfDdmfK.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Dalit man was set afire<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> for fetching water from a well, a <a href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/10-year-old-dalit-boy-thrashed-for-touching-mid-day-meal-utensils-in-rajasthan/1/490040.html" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Dalit boy was beaten up<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> for touching utensils of upper caste Hindus.</p>
<p>Forget about a Shudra eating with upper castes, a Shudra isn’t even allowed to eat cow dung and drink cow urine,</p>
<p>Apastamba Samhita 5.4 “Sudras should not be enjoined to drink Panchagavyam, inasmuch as they are not privileged to utter any Mantras. A Sudra, guilty of any delinquency, should regain his purity by confessing it to a Brahmana and by making gifts.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<h2>Eating remnants of Dvija master’s meal</h2>
<p>As per Hindu text the Shudra servant or slave must eat the remnants of his Dvija master’s meal,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 10.125 <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The remnants of their food must be given to him</span>, as well as their old clothes, the refuse of their grain, and their old household furniture.</p>
<p>Mahabharata 13.143.29 “As regards food, he should eat that which remains after the needs of all persons have been satisfied.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 5.140. Sudras who live according to the law, shall each month shave (their heads); their mode of purification (shall be) the same as that of Vaisyas, and <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">their food the fragments of an Aryan’s meal</span>.</p>
<p>Shudra here refers to those Shudras who are servants in the house of Dvijas and it also refers to Slaves. The Dvijas are not even allowed to give the leavings of their food to other Shudras,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 4.80-81; Vasistha 18.14 Let him not give to a Sudra advice, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">nor the remnants (of his meal), nor food offered to the gods</span>; nor let him explain the sacred law (to such a man), nor impose (upon him) a penance. For he who explains the sacred law (to a Sudra) or dictates to him a penance, will sink together with that (man) into the hell (called) Asamvrita.</p>
<p>It’s the highest level of hypocrisy, a Brahmin should feed his Shudra servant with the remnants of his meal but if a Brahmin accidentally eats the remnants of the food partaken by a Shudra or even in the company of a Shudra then he is to perform penance,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 11.153. But he who has eaten the food of men, whose food must not be eaten, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">or the leavings of women and Sudras</span>, or forbidden flesh, shall drink barley (-gruel) during seven (days and) nights.</p>

<h2>The penance for eating the remnants of Shudra meal is as follows</h2>
<p>Garuda Purana ch 231 “Articles of Indian bell metal, smelled by kine or defiled by the touch of residue of a Sudra’s meal, or by the contact of a dog or a crow, are purified by being rubbed with ten kinds of ashes. Having partaken his meal out of the saucer of a Sudra, a Brahmana shall regain his purity by fasting for a day, and by taking Panchgavya as well.” Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Garuda Purana 1.222.2 “If inadvertenly a brahmin takes food defiled by the Ucchista (residual of food partaken) of a Sudra he should fast for a day and night and drink Pancagavya. He shall be purified.” Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Atri Samhita 1.72 “By taking forbidden food, the residue of a food partaken of by a Sudra or a woman, or by eating forbidden meat, one should drink the extract of barley for seven nights. [74] By being touched by castes that should not be touched, one should bathe. He, who takes the residue of their food, should perform a distressing penance for six months.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti 51.57-58 “Having eaten the food of a Chandala, one shall fast for three nights. A Paraka penance is the expiation for eating the cooked food of a Chandala.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>For those who don’t know about Panchagavya. Let me tell you Panchagavya is the mixture of five products of cow, they are cow dung, urine, milk, curd and ghee. The leavings of a Shudra is considered so worst, And ironically it is cleansed by consuming cow urine and dung. Shudras are much worst than animal’s dung and urine as per Hindu text. Apastamba allows Dvija to partake the food cooked by a Shudra. Dayanand Saraswati had also used this verse from Apastamba to support his view that food cooked by a Shudra in the house of a Brahmin may be eaten. But Dayanand is said to have refused to partake the food in a Brahmin’s house that was cooked by a Shudra. So he didn’t practice it himself then how can he advocate this to others. As I said earlier, trying to give rights to low castes was a drama just to get followers. Dayanand didn’t abolish the evil Vedic caste system but upheld it. Read the article <a href="/index.php/2014/05/01/mulshankar-and-casteism/" data-wpel-link="internal">Mulshankar and Casteism</a>. As Dayanand had used the verse from Apastamba to support his view, let me quote a verse from Apastamba prohibiting it,</p>
<p>Apastamba Dharma Sutra 1.6.18. According to some (food offered by people) of any caste, who follow the laws prescribed for them, except that of Sudras, may be eaten.</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<h2>Eating food in the company or in the house of a low caste is prohibited</h2>
<p>Mahabharata 13.136.20-22 “<span style="color: #ff0000;">The Brahmana who takes his food in the company of Sudras is purged from all impurity by duly observing the ceremonies of purification</span>. The Brahmana who takes his food in the company of Vaisyas is absolved from sin by living on alms for three successive nights. If a Brahmana takes his food with Kshatriyas, he should make expiation by bathing with his clothes on.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Angiras Samhita 1.4 “When one drinks water lying stale in a vessel in the house of a lowcaste person, he should perform a penance. [7] By drinking, unknowingly, water from degraded castes, a Brahmana, fasting for a day and night, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">becomes purified with the Panchagavya</span>.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dath</p>
<p>Likhita Samhita verse 70 “By unwillingly partaking of boiled rice (lit. any kind of food) in a Chandala’s house, as well as of that prepared by a fallen or degraded person, one should live on water alone for a fortnight. The term of the penance should be extended to a month in cases where the delinquency has been knowingly committed.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<h2>Eating food cooked by low caste</h2>
<p>Other Hindu texts doesn’t prohibit a Brahmin from partaking food in the company of upper three castes (Brahmin, Kshatriya and Vaishya) but it clearly prohibits them from partaking food with Shudra (Anarya) and Mleccha (Non Hindus).</p>
<p>Angiras Samhita 1.48 “He, who continually partakes of a Sudra’s food for one month, becomes a Sudra in this birth and is born as a dog after death.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Brahma Purana 115.24 ”The food cooked by a Sudra is despised by gods and noble men, O goddess. That which is uttered by Brahma is authoritative.” Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 4.223. A Brahmana who knows (the law) must not eat cooked food (given) by a Sudra who performs no Sraddhas; but, on failure of (other) means of subsistence, he may accept raw (grain), sufficient for one night (and day).</p>
<p>Garuda Purana 1.115.7. ”Women perish due to their beauty, penance due to fury, the way due to an undue length and pious brahmana by taking sudra’s food.” Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Kurma Purana II.17.1 ”A Brahmana should not eat food offered by a Sudra whether out of delusion or otherwise. He who eats it, except an emergency, is born as a Sudra.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Narada Purana I.26.33 “One should avoid even from a distance, the wind from the winnowing basket, the smoke from the burning corpse, eating the cooked food of a Sudra and the contact with the paramour of a Sudra woman.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Atri Samhita 1.195-6 “A washerman, a cobbler, an actor, a Varuda, a Kaivarta, a Meda, and a Bhilla these seven are known in the Smriti, as degraded castes. By knowing their women, taking their food and accepting gifts from them, if willingly one should perform Prajapatya for a year; and, if unknowingly, two Chandrayanas.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Atri Samhita 1.168-173 “A twice-born person, who take food from a washer-man or from an actor, or from one who lives on bamboo work, should perform a Chandrayana. By knowing women of lowcastes, taking their meals and lying with them on the same bed, one should get [himself] purified with a Paraka. By drinking the water [that lies’ in a Chandala’s vessel, the foremost of the twice-born should live, for thirty-seven days, on barley and the urine of a cow. A Brahmana, who unknowingly partakes of cooked food touched by outcastes or by women in [their] menses, should perform half a Prajapatya. The [following are the means of] expiation for the four castes when they [happen to] partake of a Chandala’s food. A Brahmana should perform a Chandrayana; and a Kshatriya, a Santapanam. A Vaisya should perform a penance and live on the Panchagavya for six nights. A Sudra should perform [the same] for three nights and purify [himself] by making gifts.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Atri Samhita 1.248 “By knowingly drinking water from the Sudras, a Brahmana should fast for a day and night and [then] after bathing, should get [himself] purified with the Panchagavya.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Atri Samhita 1.208 “The celestials do not partake of the food nor drink the water offered by the foremost of the twice-born, who eats the food of a drunkard or of a Chandala.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Apastamba Samhita 9.40 “A Brahmana, drinking water in touch with a Chandala, should regain his purity by fasting for a day and night and by bathing thrice during the fast.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Angiras Samhita 1.53-55 “If a twice-born person, being fed by a Sudra’s food, procreates sons, those sons belong to him (i.e., the Sudra who gives the food): for semen originates from food. Any article touched by a Sudra, or any residue of his food, should not be given to a twice-born out of carelessness or with the one palm. So the ascetic Apastamva has said. One may always take a Brahmana’s food; a Kshatriya’s, on Parva-days; a Vaisya’s, in times of calamity; but never a Sudra’s.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<h2>A Dvija is punished for dying with the food of a Shudra in his stomach</h2>
<p>Mahabharata 13.143.18 “The food of a Sudra, O goddess, is always disapproved of by the high-souled deities. Even this, I think, is the authority enunciated by the Grandsire with his own mouth. If a Brahmana, who has set up the sacred fire and who performs sacrifices, were to die with any portion of a Sudra’s food remaining undigested in his stomach, he is sure to take birth in his next life as a Sudra.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Vasistha Dharma Shastra 6.27-28 <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">If a Brahmana dies with the food of a Sudra in his stomach, he will become a village pig (in his next life)</span> or be born, in the family of that (Sudra). For though a (Brahmana) whose body is nourished by the essence of a Sudra’s food may daily recite the Veda, though he may offer (an Agnihotra) or mutter (prayers, neverthless) he will not find the path that leads upwards.</p>
<p>Vyasa Samhita 4.64 “He, who dies with a Sudra’s boiled rice in his stomach, is sure to be reborn as a hog, and all his progeny will belong to the same genus, after death.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Skanda Purana VII.I.223.50 “If a Brahmana dies with the food offered by a Sudra remaining undigested within his belly he certainly becomes a Preta even if he has learned all the six Angas of the Vedas.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Preta means ghost.</p>
<p>Skanda Purana V.iii.11.30-31 ”Brahamana’s food is (regarded as) Amrta (Nectar); Ksatriya’s food is remembered as milk; Vaisya’s food is mere food, and Sudra’s food is proclaimed as blood. Those excellent Brahmanas who get nourished with Sudra’s food and juice and later die, become deprived of Tapas and knowledge and are born as crows and vultures.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Varaha Purana 174.42 ”He who dies with the food given by a Sudra within him, becomes a ghost.” Tr. Venkitasubramonia Iyer, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Mahabharata 13.141.38 “Another duty of the Brahmana consists in avoiding the food prepared by the Sudra.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Vasistha Dharma Sutra 10.31; 20.17; Skanda Purna V.iii.50.6-8 also prohibits the twice born from partaking the food of Shudras.</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<h2>Vessels touched by low caste becomes unclean &amp; also prohibition to use utensils of Shudras</h2>
<p>Usana Samhita 9.49 “By drinking water touched by a Chandala, the foremost of the twice-born becomes purified [by fasting] for three nights or by taking the Panchagavyam.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Samvarta Samhita verse 30 “He, who takes his food or drink from a Sudra’s hands, should get himself purified with the Panchagavya after fasting for a day and night. [32] By taking food in a vessel belonging to a Sudra or in a broken plate, one should get himself purified with the Panchagavya after fasting for a day and night.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Parasara Smriti 7.24 Vessels of bell metal, smelled by kine, or defiled by the touch of dogs, crows, etc., or out of which Sudras have taken their food, should be purified by rubbing them with ten kings of ashes.</p>
<p>Vyasa Samhita 3.53 “Boiled rice procured with one’s own earnings, or kept in a vessel which is not defiled by the touch of wine, nor licked by a dog, nor smelled by a cow, nor touched by a crow or a Sudra, is always pure.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Samvarta Samhita verse 194 “By taking food from the vessel of a degraded caste, or from that of a woman in menses, one would become purified, in half-a-month, by living upon barley and the urine of a cow.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Samvarta Samhita verses 182 “By drinking well water contaminated by a Chandala’s vessel, one becomes purified by living on barley and the urine of a cow for three nights.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Dr. B.R. Ambedkar lead <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahad_Satyagraha" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Mahad Satyagraha<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> in 1927 to allow untouchables to use public water tanks, this discrimination can be found in Hindu texts,</p>
<p>Parasara Smriti 6.24 “Having drunk the water of a well which has been defiled by the touch of a Chandalas water pot, a Brahmana should live on barley and cow’s urine for three days, whereby he would regain his personal cleanness.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Apastamba Samhita 2.2 “Having drunk water in a Prapa, or that lieing accumulated in a forest or in the furrows of a ploughed field, as well as that which is flowing out of a pond, or is owned by a Svapak or a Chandala, one should regain one’s purity by drinking Panchagavyam. [5] Having drunk water out of, or bathed in, a well or tank, caused to be excavated by another, one should regain one’s purity by drinking Panchagavyam.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>

<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<h2>Leftover food of Shraddhas to Shudras</h2>
<p>Guess what? Hinduism doesn’t even permit the Shudras to eat the leavings of a Shraddha,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 3.249 The foolish man who, after having eaten a Sraddha (-dinner), gives the leavings to a Sudra, falls headlong into the Kalasutra hell.</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana 2.3.15.56 ”The leavings of food from a Sraddha should not be given to women or Sudras.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Out of compassion a Brahmin may give the fragments of his Shraddha meal to his Shudra servant but never to other Shudras.</p>
<p>A sacrifice called Bhuta Yajna can be performed with the remaining food (not leftover food) and this is to be given to dogs, pigs and Chandalas,</p>
<p>Markandeya Purana 29.45-46 “Having done reverence to the gods, and the pitri and guests, relatives likewise, and female relations, and gurus also, the griha stha who has substance <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">should scatter the fragments on the ground for both dogs and low caste men and birds</span>.”</p>
<p>Kurma Purana II.18.105-6 “With the cooked food that remains after the offering unto Devas, one should offer Bhuta Bali. This should be known as Bhuta Yajna. It is the bestower of prosperity unto all embodied beings. O excellent Brahmanas, the cooked food should be given to dogs, cooker of dogs (i.e. Candalas), fallen persons (i.e. outcastes) and birds, on the ground outside.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 3.92. Let him gently place on the ground (some food) for dogs, outcasts, Kandalas (Svapak), those afflicted with diseases that are punishments of former sins, crows, and insects.</p>
<p><a href="#top" class="broken_link">top</a></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<h2>Shudra’s food at sacrifices</h2>
<p>It is mentioned in Smritis that the food offered to gods and manes will not be accepted if the sacrifice is assisted by the Shudra wife,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 3.18 ”The oblations, offered by a twice-born one who is assisted by a Sudra woman in the capacity of his principal married wife in the rite of a Pitri or Daivaa Sraddha ceremony, neither the manes, nor the divinity partake of. Even by practicing hospitality to Atithis, he cannot ascend to heaven, after death.” Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti 26.7 The gods and Pitris do not accept the oblations offered to them by (twice born ones), who perform the Daiva and Pritri (sacrifices), or propitiate the Atithis, in the company of their Sudra wives; such men go to hell.</p>
<p><a href="#top" class="broken_link">top</a></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<h1>Barred from sacrifices</h1>
<p>It is mentioned in Veda,</p>
<p>Krishna Yajur Veda 7.1.1.5 [After it the Anustubh metre] was created, the Vairaja Saman, of men the Çudra, of cattle the horse. Therefore the two, the horse and the Çudra, are dependent on others. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Therefore the Çudra is not fit for the sacrifice</span>, for he was not created after any gods.</p>
<p>Shudra is prohibited to participate in sacrifice just because of his birth in a Shudra family and one of the main reason behind Shudra been prohibited to participate in sacrifice is because it includes recitation of Vedic mantras and Shudras are clearly prohibited from uttering any Vedic mantra. Adi Shanakaracharya writes,</p>
<p>”But this scriptural ability is denied by the prohibition of the right to study. As for the text, ”The Sudra is unfit for performing a sacrifice” (Tai. S.VII.i.1.6), since it is based on a logic having common application, it suggests that the Sudra has no right to knowledge as well, for the logic applies both ways.” <strong>Shankaracharya on Brahma Sutra 1.3.34, Tr. Swami Gambhiranand</strong></p>
<p>It is mentioned in Brahmana,</p>
<p>Pancavimsa Brahmana 6.1.11 Out of his feet, his firm support, he created the twenty one fold (stoma); along with it of the metres the anustubh came into existence, of the deities none, of the men the Sudra. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Therefore the Sudra is, it is true, rich in cattle, but excluded from the sacrifice</span>, for he has no deity, as no deity had come into existence after him.</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Kailasa Samhita 6.12.22 ”The Vedas enjoin rituals for the first three castes. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Sudras are excluded since their only activity is service</span>.” Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Mahabharata 5.29.26 “The following are the duties declared for a Sudra from the olden times. He should serve the Brahmanas and submit to them; <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">should not study; sacrifices are forbidden to him</span>; he should be diligent and be constantly enterprising in doing all that is for his good. The king protects all these with (proper) care, and sets all the castes to perform their respective duties. He should not be given to sensual enjoyments. He should be impartial, and treat all his subjects on an equal footing.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 11.13. (Or) the (sacrificer) may take at his pleasure two or three (articles required for a sacrifice) from the house of a Sudra; <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">for a Sudra has no business with sacrifices</span>.</p>
<p>Mahabharata 12.165.8 “<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The Sudra has no competence for performing a sacrifice</span>. The king should, therefore, take away (wealth for such a purpose) from a Sudra house of ours.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Varaha Purana 211.4 ”Three castes participate in sacrifices and share their benefits in general. The Sudras are kept out by Brahmins from those that are purified by Vedas.” Tr. Venkitasubramonia Iyer, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Mahabharata 13.91.43-44 “From the place where the Sraddha is being performed, the Chandala and the Swapacha should be excluded, as also all who wear clothes steeped in yellow, and persons affected with leprosy, or one who has been excasted (for transgressions), or one who is guilty of Brahmanicide, or a Brahmana of mixed descent or one who is the relative of an excasted man. These all should be excluded by persons possessed of wisdom from the place where a Sraddha is being performed…” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Vayu Purana Part 2, 16.24 ”The naked and similar (apostates and non-Vedic sects) people should not see the Sraddha rite. This is the rule. Such Sraddhas as are seen by these, do not reach PItrs or Pitamahas.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Ganesh Vasudeo Tagare writes,</p>
<p>”…The text not only includes non Vedic sects like Jains and Buddhists but includes apostate Brahmins, atheists, committer of gross sins (maha-patakas).</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana 2.3.11.87 <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">”The following should always be avoided in the Sraddha ceremonies; Sudras</span>, milk of Avi (a variety of sheep), the varieties of grass named Balbaja, Virana and Otuvala, pebbles and Laddus (a sweetmeat?)” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Kurma Purana II.16.54 ”Instructions regarding observance of holy vows should not be given to a Sudra; a learned man should not expound Dharma unto him. No one should submit to anger and avoid hatred and passion.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Kurma Purana I.12.25b-26 ”The Almighty Lord created Brahamanas from his mouth and the Ksattriyas from his arms. The Lord created Vaisyas from both of his thighs. The grand-sire of the universe created Sudras from the pain of his feet. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Brahma created all castes excepting the Sudras, for the purpose of (performance of) sacrifices</span>.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Likhita Samhita verse 6 “The [three] twice-born castes have equal rights in both Ishta and Purtta works. A Sudra is entitled to [perform] Purtta [works] but not Vedic rites.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Manu 10.126. A Sudra cannot commit an offence, causing loss of caste (pataka), <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">and he is not worthy to receive the sacraments; he has no right to (fulfil) the sacred law </span>(of the Aryans, yet) there is no prohibition against (his fulfilling certain portions of) the law.</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 4.81 “The Brahmana, who gives religious instructions to a Sudra, or advises him to practise a religious vow, is drowned with that Sudra in the hell of Asamvritam (unrestrained darkness).” Tr. Manmath Nath Dutt</p>

<h2>Prohibition to perform sacrifice for low castes</h2>
<p>A good reply to apologists from Mahabharata,</p>
<p>Mahabharata 13.128.5 “That man who thinks it all right when a Sudra ignites the fire upon which he is to pour libations or who does not see any fault when women who are incompetent to assist at Sraddhas and other rites are allowed to assist at them, really becomes stained with sin.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Varaha Purana 112.16-22 ”One who receives Kapila as a gift from a Sudra should be considered as most lowly like a Candala. Therefore let not a Brahmin receive the offering from Sudras. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">They are to be kept far away like dogs during sacrifices</span>. They are discarded by the manes during new moon and full moon. They should not be spoken to and nothing should be received from them because they do only sinful deeds. Those (Sudras) who drink (the milk of) Kapila make their forefathers eat the filth in the earth for long. Note what happens to the Sudraas who feed on the milk, ghee and butter of the Kapila’s cows. They go to the terrible hell called Raurava. After living there for a hundred crores of years, they are born as dogs.” Tr. Venkitasubramonia Iyer, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Mahabharata 13.23.16 “Those Brahmanas who pour libations on the sacred fire for Sudras, or who are preceptors of Sudras, or who as servants of Sudra masters, do not deserve to be invited.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Narada Purana I.15.32b-34 “The Brahman who, on being invited by a Sudra, partakes of his food, should be known as a wine addict. He is excluded from all holy rites. That mean fellow who does the work of an attendant with the permission of a Sudra, incurs a sin equal to drinking of wine…” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Markandeya Purana 14.83 By receiving favours from an outcaste, by performing sacrifices for an outcaste, by constant attendance on an outcaste a man ever reaches the condition of an insect that lives among stones.</p>
<p>Markandeya Purana 15.1 For accepting anything of value from an outcaste, let a dvija be born an ass; but let him who sacrifices for the outcaste become a worm, on his release from hell.</p>
<p>Vamana Purana 12.86 “He who accepts Daksina from Candalas or Sudras, the priest and the person employing the priest to perform a sacrifice, every one of them is born as a big insect inside stone slabs.” Tr. Anand Swarup Gupta</p>
<p>Brahma Purana 108.37 “A Brahmana though well versed in the Vedas is born as an ass if he receives charity from a fallen person. [40-43]If he officiates at a sacrifice performed by a low person, he is born a worm and in the form of a worm he lives for fiteen years. Released from the form of worm he is born an ass and in the form of an ass he lives for five years; in the form of a cock for five years; in the form of a jackal for five years; then he is born in the form of man; then a jealous person; then an animal…” Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Yama Samhita verse 29-32 “…one who officiates as a priest for those to whom no such service should be given…all these should be carefully shunned at a Sraddha and [while making gifts].” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Gautama Dharma Shastra 20.1 Let him cast off a father who assassinates a king, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">who sacrifices for Sudras</span>, who sacrifices for his own sake (accepting) money from Sudras…</p>
<p>Usana Samhita 4.23-30 “The following are disqualified to be present at the Sraddha ceremony:- Those, who sell the Sruti; those who marry widows; those, who enter in to a locked room without the permission of the owner; and those, who officiate as priests for inferior castes; are described as out-castes.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Usana Samhita 9.56 “By officiating as a priest for servants, [or by helping] others (i.e., other castes) in other rites, by performing rites causing death to another person, and other unworthy deeds, [a Brahmana] becomes purified by three distressing penances.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>

<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<h2>Proof that Shudras were kept away from sacrifices</h2>
<p>Mahabharata 2.35.8-10 ”That (sacrificial) platform, crowded with the celestials, Brahmanas and the great Rishis, all endued with the Vedas, looked as beautiful as the sky studded with the stars .O king <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">there was no sudra or any man without vows near the inner (sacrificial) platform of Yudhisthira’s palace</span>. Seeing the prosperity of the prosperous and intelligent Dharmaraja, which was the result of that sacrifice, Narada became exceedingly happy.” Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Shudras are not allowed to participate in sacrifice or perform it. However Hinduism allows Shudra to perform minor sacrifices but without uttering any Mantra, they are to be kept away from sacrifices due to the fact that Shudras are not allowed to hear any Mantra,</p>
<p>Mahabharata 12.60 “Sacrifice has been laid down as a duty of the three other orders. It has been ordained for the Sudra also, O Bharata! A Sudra, however, is not competent to utter swaha and swadha or any other Vedic mantra. For this reason, the Sudra, without observing the vows laid down in the Vedas, should worship the gods in minor sacrifices called Paka-yajnas.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Other than the sacrifice to Manes, Shudras cannot perform any other sacrifice. As it is said that serving the twice born (Dvija) is equivalent to sacrifice for the Shudras,</p>
<p>Vayu Purana Part 1, 57.50 “Aranbha (expedition or enterprise) was a sacrifice for Ksattriyas. Havis (offering of ghee etc.) was the Yajna of Vaisyas. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Sudras had service as Yajna</span> and excellent Brahmanas had Japa (chanting of Mantras) as their Yajna.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Above verse from Vayu Purana is talking about the Treta Yuga. Treta Yuga is the second Yuga among the four Yugas or ages of mankind in Hinduism. It says that service to Dvija was the Yajna of the Shudras which shows that Shudras were not allowed to perform sacrifice in such earlier period also. However this is not just limited to the Treta Yuga but also applicable in the present Kali Yuga, it is mentioned in Mahabharata,</p>
<p>Mahabharata 12.232 “The growing of corn is the sacrifice laid down for the Vaisyas. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Serving the three other orders is the sacrifice laid down for the Sudras</span>.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>

<h2>Touch of dogs, pigs and low castes invalidates a sacrifice</h2>
<p>Manu Smriti 3.240-1 What (any of) these sees at a burnt-oblation, at a (solemn) gift, at a dinner (given to Brahmanas), or at any rite in honour of the gods and manes, that produces not the intended result. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">A boar makes (the rite) useless</span> by inhaling the smell (of the offerings), a cock by the air of his wings, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">a dog by throwing his eye (on them), a low-caste man by touching (them)</span>.</p>

<h1>Difficult for a Shudra to worship</h1>
<p>Skanda Purana II.iv.3.35-37 ”He who worships and bows to the idols installed by Sudras, goes to hell along with ten ancestors and ten descendants. If one touches the idol worshipped by a Sudra, he will burn (get burnt) his family up to the seventh generation. Hence one must enquire and worship an idol that has been installed by Brahmanas.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Varaha Purana 186.49-50 “But a Salagrama should not be touched by men of inferior caste or by women and Sudras. If a woman or Sudra touches it even out of curiosity, the result will be torment in hell till deluge.” Tr. Venkitasubramonia Iyer, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Narada Purana III.67.33 “One should not worship an idol if it crooked, burnt, or broker, if its head is split, or if it is looking upwards, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">or if it is touched by an amyaja (outcaste) and others</span>.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>A Shudra is not even allowed to utter Om.</p>
<p>Narada Purana III.70.72-73 “This is called Visnu Gayatri which removes all sins. Tara=om., hrt=namah, then bhagavan ending in the dative case, then vausdevaya. This great mantra consisting of twelve syllables gives enjoyment and salvation. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">This is to be used without tara=om by women and sudras</span> but by the twice born it is used with tara=om.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>A Shudra should also avoid Vedic Japa,<br />
Narada Purana, Uttarabhaga 61.51-53 “The procedure for the holy dip and the repetition of Japas is, in regard to the three castes, the same as mentioned in the Vedas. O fair lady, in regard to the Sudras and the women the repetition of the Vedic texts is to be avoided…” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>It is mentioned in Mahabharata,</p>
<p>Mahabharata 13.23.7 “Food that has been eaten by a <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">person incompetent to utter the syllable Om</span>, or that has been eaten by a person bearing arms, O Bharata, or that has been eaten by a wicked person should be known to form the portion of Rakshasas*.” Tr. Kisari Mohan Ganguli</p>
<p>Kisari Mohan Ganguli writes in the footnote,</p>
<p>”* i.e., any food, a portion of which has been eaten by any of these persons, is unworthy of being given away. If given, it is appropriated by Rakshasas. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">One incompetent to utter Om is, of course, a Sudra</span>.” [ <a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m13/m13a023.htm" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Source<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> ]
<p>Skanda Purana V.iii.228.9 “The following six things cause downfall of women and Sudras: japa, penance, pilgrimage, renunciation of the world, practice of Mantras and initiation for the adoration of a deity” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>

<h1>Barred from studying Vedas</h1>
<p>Not even a single Hindu text permits a Shudra to study Vedas. Puranas explicitly says that since Vedas cannot be learned by Shudra and women, the God composed Itihasa (Ramayana, Mahabharata) and Puranas for them,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 1.4.25 ”<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The</span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;"> degenerated twice-borns, the Sudras and women are barred from the holy truths of the Vedas</span>, and, out of compassion for them, Maharshi Vyasa composed the Mahabharata.” Tr. J.M. Sanyal</p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 1.3.18-24 “…knowing this in every Dvâpara Yuga Bhagavân expounds the holy Purâna Samhitas. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The more so because women, S’udras, and the lower Dvijas are not entitled to hear the Vedas; for their good, the Purânas have been composed</span>…” Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>But Shudras should hear Puranas behind a screen,</p>
<p>Garuda Purana I.20.13-14 “None of the other classes (Vaisya or Sudra) is authorized to hear the Purana. If, by mistake, he narrates it to an unworthy person, he becomes the object of censure. But, if he narrates the Purana from behind the screen, then both the deserving and the undeserving person become worthy to hear.” Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Same is repeated in Natya Shastra, Gods along with Indra approached Brahma and said,</p>
<p>Natsya Shastra 1.12-13 As the Vedas are not to be listened to by those born as Sudras, be pleased to create another Veda which will belong to all the Colour-groups (Varna). ‘Let it be so’, said he in reply and then having dismissed the king of gods (Indra) he resorted to yoga (concentration of mind) and recalled to mind the four Vedas.”</p>
<p>Brahma Purana 64.19 ”In regard to the people of the first three castes the rite of holy bath and the reception of Mantras is in the manner mentioned in the Vedas. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The utterance of the Vedic passage is to be avoided by women as well as Sudras</span>.” Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Garuda Purana gives an accounts of sins that will lead to hell in chapter 4 and it says that if a Shudra studies Vedas then he will go to hell,</p>
<p>Garuda Purana 4.22 “The Śūdra who studies the letter of the Vedas, who drinks the milk of the tawny cow, who wears the sacred thread or consorts with Brāhmiṇ women. [23] Having come all along the path the sinful reach the abode of Yama, and having come, by command of Yama, the messengers hurl them into that river again.” Tr. Ernest Wood and S.V. Subrahmanyam</p>
<p>Parasara Smriti 1.64 “Drinking the milk of a Kapila cow, knowing a Brahmana woman, and reciting the Vedas are the acts, by doing which a Sudra is punished with hell.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Apastamba Dharma Shastra 1.1.1.6 (For all these), excepting Sudras and those who have committed bad actions, (are ordained) the initiation, the study of the Veda, and the kindling of the sacred fire; and (their) works are productive of rewards (in this world and the next).</p>
<p>It is mentioned in Bhagavat Purana that twice born men only are entitled for performing sacrifices and to learn Vedas,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 11.17.40 “All twice-born men — brāhmaṇas, kṣatriyas and vaiśyas — must perform sacrifice, study the Vedic literature and give charity. Only the brāhmaṇas, however, accept charity, teach the Vedic knowledge and perform sacrifice on behalf of others.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 7.11.13 “He is called a dvija or twice-born one whose (sixteen) purifying rites (accompanied by recitation of mantras) have been performed without any break in succession, and to whom god Brahma has designated as such. Performance of sacrifices, study of scriptures and charity are prescribed for all twice-born classes (viz. Brahmana, Ksattriya and Vaisya) who are of pure birth and conduct. It is for these that duties incumbent on different stages of life (asrama) are prescribed.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>But a Brahmin alone can teach the Vedas,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 1.103. A learned Brahmana must carefully study them, and he must duly instruct his pupils in them, but nobody else (shall do it).</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 10.1. Let the three twice-born castes (varna), discharging their (prescribed) duties, study (the Veda); but among them the Brahmana (alone) shall teach it, not the other two; that is an established rule.</p>
<p>If all the three castes have learned the Vedas then why does it differentiates the Brahmins, Kshatriyas and Vaishyas? As apologists claim that one who is learned in the Vedas is a Brahmin. And when Kshatriya and Vaishya are conversant with the Vedas then why a Brahmin alone should teach it why cannot a Kshatriya or a Vaishya teach the Veda?</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>

<h2>Scholars prohibiting teaching of Vedas to Shudras</h2>
<p>Acharya Medhatithi writes on Manu Smriti 2.241,</p>
<p>“Though the term ‘non Brahmana’ denoting all the three castes, except the Brahmana, stands for all men, yet the Shudra could not be meant here; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">for the Shudra is not entitled to learn the Veda</span>; and it is only when one has learn something that he can teach it. ‘But by transgressing the scriptural ordinance, the Shudra also might learn the Veda, just as the Ksattriya and the Vaishya do the work of teaching (which is not permitted).’ <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">This also cannot be; because it has been laid down that is the Shudra happens to learn the Veda, his body should be cut up</span>. And since the penalty is so severe, it follows that the act if a grievous sin.”</p>
<p>Adi Shankaracharya writes in the commentary of Gita 18.41,</p>
<p>“Sudras are separated from others who are all mentioned together in one compound word, because <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Sudras are of one birth and are debarred from the study of the Vedas</span>…” Tr. Mahadeva Shastri</p>
<p>Adi Shankaracharya also writes on Brahma Sutra 1.3.38</p>
<p>“38. And on account of the prohibition, in Smriti, of (the Sûdras’) hearing and studying (the Veda) and (knowing and performing) (Vedic) matters.</p>
<p>The Sûdras are not qualified for that reason also that Smriti prohibits their hearing the Veda, their studying the Veda, and their understanding and performing Vedic matters. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The prohibition of hearing the Veda is conveyed by the following passages: ‘The ears of him who hears the Veda are to be filled with (molten) lead and lac,’ and ‘For a Sûdra is (like) a cemetery, therefore (the Veda) is not to be read in the vicinity of a Sûdra</span>.’ From this latter passage the prohibition of studying the Veda results at once; for how should he study Scripture in whose vicinity it is not even to be read? There is, moreover, an express prohibition (of the Sûdras studying the Veda). ‘His tongue is to be slit if he pronounces it; his body is to be cut through if he preserves it.’ The prohibitions of hearing and studying the Veda already imply the prohibition of the knowledge and performance of Vedic matters; there are, however, express prohibitions also, such as ‘he is not to impart knowledge to the Sûdra,’ and ‘to the twice-born belong study, sacrifice, and the bestowal of gifts.’–From those Sûdras, however, who, like Vidura and ‘the religious hunter,’ acquire knowledge in consequence of the after effects of former deeds, the fruit of their knowledge cannot be withheld, since knowledge in all cases brings about its fruit. Smriti, moreover, declares that all the four castes are qualified for acquiring the knowledge of the itihâsas and purânas; compare the passage, ‘He is to teach the four castes’ (Mahâbh.).–It remains, however, a settled point that they do not possess any such qualification with regard to the Veda.”</p>
<p>Ramanuja Acharya writes on Brahma Sutra 1.3.38,</p>
<p>“38. And on account of the prohibition of hearing, studying, and performance of (Vedic) matter.<br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The Sûdra is specially forbidden to hear and study the Veda and to perform the things enjoined in it.</span> ‘For a Sûdra is like a cemetery, therefore the Veda must not be read in the vicinity of a Sûdra;’ ‘Therefore the Sûdra is like a beast, unfit for sacrifices.’ And he who does not hear the Veda recited cannot learn it so as to understand and perform what the Veda enjoins. The prohibition of hearing thus implies the prohibition of understanding and whatever depends on it.”</p>
<p>Madhvacharya first tries to say that Shudra can also study scriptures but later clearly prohibits a Shudra from studying Vedas,</p>
<p>“…For, in the text, ‘Let the Brahmana be initiated at the age of eight and let him be taught scripture,’ the ceremony of purification is mentioned as the immediate preliminary condition to teaching scripture. And in the case of the Sudra, the absence of this ceremony of purification is spoken of in the Paingin’s Sruti. ‘The Sudra has no consecrated fire, no sacrifice, no prayers, no ceremonies (to be performed); no process of purification, no austerities (to be practised). <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Hence the Sudra is not eligible for the study of Scripture</span>…Haridrumata having (first) concluded that ‘A non-brahmin is not capable of such truthful answer,’ (ib), and consequently Satyakama was not a Sudra, proceeded to perform the ceremony of initiation for him. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Hence the Sudra is not eligible for the study of the Vedas. For the Sudra is prohibited (from the study of the Vedas) as in the Gautama Dharma Sastra</span>, ‘The ears of him (the Sudra) who hears the Veda are to be filled with molten lead and lac, his tongue is to be slit if he pronounces it, his heart is to be cut open, if he attempts to know its meaning.’ And Smriti says, ‘the Sudra has no (consecrated) fire (to be maintained), no sacrifices (to be performed); so possibly he could not study the Vedas; however, free service to the three higher classes is prescribed for the Sudra, as the means of higher life’…” <strong>Madhvacharya on Brahma Sutra 1.3.36-38, Tr. S.Subba Rau</strong></p>
<p>Vijnanesvara writes in Mitakshara,</p>
<p>“Manu has also shown that the twice born alone are entitled to study the Dharma Sastras and a Brahmana alone can teach them and no one else.” <strong>Vijnanesvara in his book Mitakshara on Yajnavalkya Smriti verse 3</strong></p>
<p>Keshava Kashmiri writes on Bhagavad Gita 18.41</p>
<p>“…The Brahmins the priestly class, the <em>ksatriyas</em> or royal warrior class and the <em>vaisya’s</em> the mercantile and agricultural class are all spoken of in unison because they only have the right to initiation making them qualified to study the Vedic scriptrures, engage in <em>yagnas</em> or ritualistic propitiation and worship. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Whereas the </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;"><em>sudra</em></span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;"> or servant class are mentioned separately as they have not the qualification for initiation and study of the Vedic scriptures</span> but all are factually the product of their own innate natures.</p>
<p>To study the Vedic scriptures and perform <em>yagna</em> the prerequisite of initiation essential and required. A <em>sudra</em> is a fourth class citizen who may perform unauthorised activities without sin because they are only once born from the womb not twice born by the spiritual master. I<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">t is prohibited in the Vedic scripture to initiate a </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;"><em>sudra.</em></span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;"> If done it will bring calamity upon the spiritual master, his dynasty and the whole kingdom. There are direct references in the Vedic scriptures prohibiting </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;"><em>sudras</em></span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;"> from initiation</span>. Such passages as: The <em>sudra</em> carries the dead body to the cremation ground that is a <em>sudra</em> and if a <em>sudra</em> hears a mantra his ears should be filled with wax, if he recites a mantra his tongue should be cut out and if he memorises a mantra his life should be taken. So it can be understood that in ancient times the prohibitions of a <em>sudra</em> were strictly enforced…” <strong>Keshava Kashmiri on Bhagavad Gita 18.41</strong></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>Sridhara Swami writes on Bhagavad Gita 18.41</p>
<p>“…Now Lord Krishna commences a new theme with this verse explaining that the duties of the different classes of Vedic society such as <em>brahmana</em> or priestly class, <em>ksatriya</em> or royal and warrior class, <em>vaisya</em> or agricultural and mercantile class as well as <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;"><em>sudra</em></span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;"> or menial worker class which is the only one not qualified to take part in any Vedic activity as they serve the other three classes</span>.

<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>It is mentioned in Bhagvad Gita,</p>

<p>Hindu scholar named Swami Swarupananda writes,</p>
<p>”Of inferior birth…Shudras because by birth, the Vaishyas are engaged only in agriculture, etc., and <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">the women and Shudras are debarred from the study of the Vedas</span>.” <a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/sbg/sbg14.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Source<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>

<h2>Prohibtion to teach Vedas</h2>
<p>Skanda Purana III.ii.6.79 ”One should never teach a Vedic Mantra to a Sudra. (Thereby) the Brahmana becomes deficient in his Brahmanical powers and the Sudra in his merit” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>It is mentioned in Manu Smriti that sacrificing for a lower castes, or assisting them in sacrifice and teaching them is prohibited,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 10.109-111 <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">On (comparing) the acceptance (of gifts from low men), sacrificing (for them), and teaching (them), the acceptance of gifts is the meanest (of those acts) and (most) reprehensible for a Brahmana</span> (on account of its results) in the next life. (For) assisting in sacrifices and teaching are (two acts) always performed for men who have received the sacraments; but the acceptance of gifts takes place even in (case the giver is) a Sudra of the lowest class. The guilt incurred by offering sacrifices for teaching (unworthy men) is removed by muttering (sacred texts) and by burnt offerings, but that incurred by accepting gifts (from them) by throwing (the gifts) away and by austerities.</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 11.181 “By sharing the same bed, or cushion, or by riding in the same car with, or by eating in the company of a degraded person for a year, a man becomes degraded’ by teaching the Vedas to such a person, or by officiating as a priest at a sacrifice instituted by him, or by contracting any marital relation with him, one becomes degraded on the same day.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Same is repeated in Vasishta,</p>
<p>Vasistha Dharma Shastra 1.22 Now they quote also (the following verse): He who during a year associates with an outcast becomes (likewise) an outcast; not by sacrificing for him, by teaching him or by (forming) a matrimonial (alliance with him), but by using the same carriage or seat.</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti 71.48-52 “Let him not teach lessons to a Sudra. Nor give the leavings of his plate or the residue of clarified butter he has drunk to a Sudra. Nor sesame. Nor instructions in religion. Nor in the mode of practising Vratas.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Skanda Purana V.iii.228.8-9”One should not give knowledge, leavings of food or Havis to a Sudra. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">He should not be taught righteous and pious rites nor should he be initiated in Vratas</span>. The following six things cause downfall of women and Sudras: japa, penance, pilgrimage, renunciation of the world, practice of Mantras and initiation for the adoration of a deity” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Mahabharata 13.10.66-70 “<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Unto Sudras, therefore, the Brahmanas should never give instructions</span>. Hence, O king, the Brahmana should avoid imparting instructions (to such as are low-born), for it was by imparting instruction to a low-born person a Brahmana came to grief. O best of kings, the Brahmana should never desire to obtain instruction from, or impart instruction to, a person that belongs to the lowest order<span style="color: #ff0000;">. Brahmanas and Kshatriyas and Vaisyas, the three orders, are regarded as twice-born. By imparting instruction unto these, a Brahmana does not incur any fault</span>. They, therefore, that are good, should never discourse on any subject, for imparting any instruction, before persons of the inferior order.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>Vasistha Dharma Shastra 20.45. Property received from outcasts, after forming alliances with them either by (teaching) the Veda (and by sacrificing) or by marriage, must be relinquished. Let him not associate with such (men).</p>

<h2>Shudras studying Vedas is one of the evils</h2>
<p>Shudras studying the Veda and performing sacrifice are some of the evils of Kali Yuga predicted in Hindu scriptures,</p>
<p>Linga Purana Section I.40.40-41 ”Some sell Vedas and others sell Tirthas (holy waters) i.e. make illegal gain out of these. When Kali yuga begins heretics will be born who will be opposed to the system of four castes and stages of life. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Sudras will learn the Vedas and will become experts in the meaning of Dharma</span>.” Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Tulsi Ramayana, Uttara Kanda, Doha 98A-B.1 Dominated by women, my lord, all me dance to their tune like a monkey controlled by its trainer. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Sudras instruct the twice born in spiritual wisdom and, wearing the sacred thread</span>, accept the worst type of gifts.</p>
<p>Kurma Purana I.30.21-22 ”In Kaliyuga, the Brahmanas, dependent on the Sudras, hover round and serve the Sudras seated in their vehicles and eulogise them by songs of praise and prayer. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Dependent on Sudras, they teach them Vedas</span>. Due to the calamity of appeasing those without Vedas, they resort to terrible atheism.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 273.46-47 ”Thenceforward all this world will fall upon very bad times. Men will be liars, greedy, and destitute of righteousness, affection and wealth. The religion of Srutis and Smritis will become very lax, and so also will be destroyed the orders and castes. The people will be of mixed origin, weak in body and will be led astray and deluded. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Brahmanas will sacrifice for Sudras (or will study under Sudraas) and Sudras will take to teaching Mantras</span>.” Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 144.40-42 ”Many with them profess to be Brahmajnanis, because, thereby, they will easily earn their livelihood. Some hypocrites will mark their bodies with Vedic symbols also. In the Kaliyuga any body will study the Vedas; <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Sudraas will be experianced in the Vedas</span>. So there will be many false religionists.” Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>Narada Purana I.41.54-55 “The Sudras will not serve the twice-born. Assuming the airs of heretics, the base-born assume and practice holy rites of the Brahmanas. The Sudras will clothe themselves in ochre-robes; they will have matted hair; they will smear ashes all over their bodies. Thus equipped and employing deceptive arguments, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">they will begin to expatiate on Dharma</span>. [58-] Occupying excellent seats, Sudras will expatiate on Dharma-religious duties-to Brahmans who habitually destroy Dharma. These and many other heretics such as nude ascetics (Digambaras), red-roled mendicants, will roam about; most of whom will be decrying the Vedas. [71] After the advent of the Kali age, Sudras and outcastes will become kings and the Brahmans will be engaged in rendering service to them. They will be begging for alms” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Vayu Purana Part 1, 58.46 “Then, when the end of the age approaches, even the great goddess like the earth will yield but little fruit. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Sudras will begin to perform penance</span>” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Mahabharata 13.94.11 “[Rishi Agastya said] That Time has come upon us. Hence, Righteousness is afflicted. It is meet that I should go to heaven for good, before unrighteousness assails the world and establishes itself here! Before the time comes <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">when Brahmanas, loudly uttering the fully Vedas, within the precincts of villages and inhabited places, cause the Sudras to hear them</span>, before the time comes when kings often against the rules of Righteousness from motives of policy, I shall go to heaven for good.” Tr.

<h2>Shudras hearing or reciting the sacred text</h2>
<p>Hinduism prohibits Dvijas (upper three castes) from reciting Vedas in the presence of Shudras,</p>
<p>Narada Purana I.15.100-1 “<span style="text-decoration: underline;">I shall mention the fruits of sins accruing to those who engage themselves in the recitation and study of the Vedas in the vicinity of women and Sudras</span>. Listen to it attentively. They are compelled to stand with their heads down and legs upwards. Thus, they are nailed to two pillars and are compelled to inhale smoke continuously in this posture. They stay thus for the period of year of god Brahma.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 4.99. Let him not recite (the texts) indistinctly, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">nor in the presence of Sudras</span>; nor let him, if in the latter part of the night he is tired with reciting the Veda, go again to sleep.</p>
<p>Usana Samhita 3.65 “No study [is allowed] in a village inhabited by low-caste people, near an irreligious person, when cries are heard and where there is a multitude of men.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Vasistha Dharma Shastra 18.11-14 Some call that Sudraa race a burial-ground. There (the Veda) must not be recited in the presence of a Sudra. Now they quote also the (following) verses, which Yama proclaimed: <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">‘The wicked Sudra-race is manifestly a burial ground. Therefore (the Veda) must never be recited in the presence of a Sudra</span>. Let him not give advice to a Sudra’…</p>
<p>Apastamba Dharma Shastra 1.3.9.6 He shall never study in a burial ground nor anywhere near it within the throw of a Samya. [8-9] But if that place is known to have been a burial ground he shall not study (there). <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">A Sudra and an outcast are (included by the term) burial ground, (and the rule given, Sutra 6, applies to them.)</span></p>
<p>Linga Purana Section I.85.161 ”The repeater of the mantras shall not perform japa in the open street, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">or in the presence of the Sudras</span> or in a ground smeared with blood, or sitting in a cot.” Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Usana Samhita 8.72 “By reciting the Vedas, dharma-Sastras and the Puranas before the Chandalas, one is purified by the Chandrayana. There is no other means of redemption for him.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti 30.4-15 “For the whole day and night the Vedas should not be studied on the eighty or the fourteenth day of the moon’s (wane or increase)…Nor near the Sudras and the degraded.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">It is prohibited for a Shudra to hear the Vedas</span></strong>,</p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 11.15.11-20 “As a man of a lowest caste acts contrary <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">and incurs a sin if he hears the Veda mantra</span>…” Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Mahabharata 2.44.15 “Desirous of speedy death, this fool had desired Rukmini. But the fool obtained her not, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">like a Sudra failing to obtain the audition of the Vedas</span>.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>If the Shudra somehow manages to hear the Vedas then he is punished in the following way,</p>
<p>Katyayana Smriti verse 486 “The king should punish a sudra, who forsakes the order of sannyasins (after having entered it) and who intently practises japa (silent muttering of prayers) and homa, with death (or corporal punish) or he should be punished with double the fine.” Tr. P.V. Kane</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><strong>If a Shudra pronounces the Vedic text then his tongue should be clipped off and body must be mutilated, </strong></p>
<p>Gauatama Dharma Shastra 12.4-6 Now if he listens intentionally to (a recitation of) the Veda, his ears shall be filled with (molten) tin or lac. If he recites (Vedic texts), his tongue shall be cut out. If he remembers them, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">his body shall be split in twain</span>.</p>
<p>Atri Samhita 1.19 “The Sudra who engages in the recitation [of the Gayatri] and the offering of oblations to the Sacred Fire, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">should be killed by the king</span>; for by that he becomes the destroyer of the kingdom as the water is of fire.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Skanda Purana V.iii.200.6 ”It has been decided that for merely pronouncing the Veda (Vedic text by a Sudra) the tongue of that Sudra should be cut off by Ksatriyas who are the protectors of Dharma” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Brihaspati Smriti 20.12 (A Sudra) teaching the precepts of religion, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">or uttering the words of the Veda</span>, or insulting a Brahman, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">shall be punished by cutting out his tongue</span>.</p>

<h1>Proof that Veda was not taught to Shudras</h1>
<p>Skanda Purana III.i.10.32 ”The Sudra named Drdhamati came to the hermitage and was honoured by the ascetics. He prostrated in front of them with the eight limbs (touching the ground). [34-44] Then he felt inclined to perform an excellent penance. So he approached the Kulapati (Head sage of the hermitage) and spoke these words… O sage of good holy rites, initiate me in the Yaga rite. O Brahmana, I belong to the Sudra community, O excellent one. I wish to render services to you. Be pleased with me who have sought refuge in you. When this was spoken by the Sudra<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">, the Brahmana spoke to him</span>: <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">A Sudra being low low birth cannot be initiated in a sacrifice</span>. Be pleased to listen. If you are so inclined, be engaged in service. No (religious) instructions is to be given to one of low caste. In instructing him, the preceptor incurs great sin. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">A learned man shall not teach a Sudra, nor should he perform a Yaga on his behalf</span>… <span style="text-decoration: underline;">If a Brahmana were to teach a Sudra these subjects, the other Brahmanas shall banish him from the village, from Brahmana community. One shall abandon like a Candala, the Brahmana who instructs a Sudra</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">One should avoid from afar a Sudra who is literate</span>. Hence, welfare unto you. Render service unto Brahmanas with reverence. Service to the twice-born has been prescribed by Manu and others (as the duty) of a Sudra.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Drdhamati was not taught Vedas just because he belonged to Shudra caste.</p>
<p>Ramanuja Acharya and Adi Shankaracharya writes that Gautama Rishi started teaching Vedas to Jabala only after he ascertained that Jabala was not a Shudra. They also prohibit teaching Veda to Shudras</p>
<p>Acharya Ramanuja writes in the commentary of Brahma Sutra 1.3.37</p>
<p>“37. And on account of the procedure, on the ascertainment of the non-being of that.<br />
That a Sûdra is not qualified for knowledge of Brahman appears from that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">fact also that as soon as Gautama has convinced himself that Gâbâla, who wishes to become his pupil, is not a Sûdra, he</span> proceeds to teach him the knowledge of Brahman.”</p>
<p>Shankaracharya writes on Brahma Sutra 1.3.37,</p>
<p>” 37. And on account of (Gautama) proceeding (to initiate Gâbâla) on the ascertainment of (his) not being that (i.e. a Sûdra).</p>
<p>The Sûdras are not qualified for that reason also that Gautama, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">having ascertained Gâbâla not to be a Sûdra from his speaking the truth, proceeded to initiate and instruct him</span>. ‘None who is not a Brâhmana would thus speak out. Go and fetch fuel, friend, I shall initiate you. You have not swerved from the truth’ (Kh. Up. IV, 4, 5); which scriptural passage furnishes an inferential sign (of the Sûdras not being capable of initiation).”</p>
<p>Gautama Rishi started teaching Vedas to Jabala only after knowing that he was not a Shudra, this shows that Veda was not taught to Shudras.</p>

<h2>Teaching Vedas to Shudras was considered a taboo</h2>
<p>Sita the wife of Rama said,</p>
<p>Ramayana of Valmiki, Sundara Khanda 28.5 “I may be slain by that dreadful monster but I can no more give him my affection than a <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">brahmin can impart the teachings of the Veda to one of low caste</span>.” Tr. Hari Prasad Shastri</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 9.18.14 “And we are even more respectable because we are in the dynasty of Bhṛgu. Yet although this woman’s father, being among the demons, is our disciple, she has put on my dress, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">exactly like a śūdra taking charge of Vedic knowledge</span>.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 4.2.13 “To this proud, impious fellow who has given up performance of religious acts, and has violated all the bounds (of religious prosperity), I gave my young daughter though <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">reluctant to do so, as one would be to impart the sacred beautiful word (Vedas) to a Sudraa (who is not eligible to receive Vedic lore)</span>.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 10.38.4 “<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Just as recitation and study of the Vedas is impossible to a person born in the Sudra class</span>, I consider that gaining even the sight of Krsnaa of excellent renown is very difficult for me, inasmuch as my mind is addicted to sensual pleasures.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Mahabharata, Adi Parva 1.160 “How shall I be able to place this sole daughter of thy house–this innocent girl–in the way along which her ancestors have always walked? How shall I then be able to impart unto this child every desirable accomplishment to make him virtuous as thyself, in that season of want when I shall become masterless? Overpowering myself who shall be masterless, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">unworthy persons will demand (the hand of) this daughter of thine, like Sudras desiring to hear the Vedas</span>.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>

<h1>Duty of a Shudra</h1>
<p>Garuda Purana ch 96 ”the sole duty of a Shudra is to render personal service to the foremost of the twice born castes.” Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 30.5 For Brahman (Priesthood) he binds a Brahman to the stake; for Kshatra (Royalty) a Râjanya; for the Maruts a Vaisya; for Penance [service] a Sudra;</p>
<p>Vamana Purana, Saromahatmya 22.38-39 “In its middle is a mighty Banyan tree, the embodiment of Sthanu. From Him have issued the castes, Brahmans, Ksatriyas, Vaisyas, and Shudras were born from Him to render service to the twice born…” Tr. Anand Swarup Gupta</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 3.8.33-34 “Attendance upon the three regenerate castes is the province of the Śúdra, and by that he is to subsist, or by the profits of trade, or the earnings of mechanical labour. He is also to make gifts; and he may offer the sacrifices in which food is presented, as well as obsequial offerings.” Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Narasima Purana 58.10-13 &#8220;The Sudra should serve all these three varnas and serve the Brahmanas like a slave. He should donate from his earning without asking for anything form others. He should do agriculture for survival. He should worship the stars every month as per the religion and justice and always wear old apparel. He should clean the pots used by the Brahmanas keep attachment with his own wife.&#8221; Tr. Joshi K.L. Shastri and Bindiya Trivedi</p>
<p>Sankha Samhita 1.5 Serving the Brahmanas, and performance of different handicrafts should be the specific duties of a Sudra. Practice of forbearance, truthfulness, and self-control, and cleanliness of body and spirit are equally obligatory on all, without any distinction of caste.</p>
<p>Katyayana Smriti verse 722 “One may make the sudra work as a slave, whether he be purchased or not purchased; the creator himself created him for slavery.” Tr. P.V. Kane</p>
<p>Mahabharata 13.141 “<span style="text-decoration: underline;">The service of the three regenerate classes constitutes the high duty of the Sudra</span>. That Sudra who is truthful in speech and who has subdued his senses is regarded as having acquired meritorious penances. Verily, the Sudra, who having got a guest, discharges the duties of hospitality towards him, is regarded as acquiring the merit of high penances. That intelligent Sudra whose conduct is righteous and who worships the deities and Brahmanas, becomes endued with the desirable rewards of righteousness.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 10.123. The service of Brahmanas alone is declared (to be) an excellent occupation for a Sudra; for whatever else besides this he may perform will bear him no fruit.</p>
<p>The same is repeated in Apastamba Dharma Shastra 1.1.1.7; Vishnu Smriti 2.8; Manu Smriti 10.334 and Yajnavalkya Smriti 1.120. Shudra’s duty is to serve the twice born but it is prohibited for twice born to serve low caste people,</p>
<p>Padma Purana V.9.40-47 …A brahmana should always avoid serving low people….</p>

<h2>Punishment for not carrying out his duties</h2>
<p>Parasara Smriti 2.16 By not in any way serving the Brahmanas, and by doing heinous acts, a Sudra becomes short lived, and goes to hell, after death. These duties are imperatively obligatory on the men of four castes.</p>
<p>Skanda Purana III.ii.40.56 ”If a Sudra created for service does not serve Brahmanas, nor does he give the means of sustenance (to them), Hanuman becomes angry with him.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p><a href="#top" class="broken_link">top</a></p>

<h1>Prohibition to intermingle</h1>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana 3:1:1:10. Let him not commune with every one; for he who is consecrated draws nigh to the gods, and becomes one of the deities. Now the gods do not commune with every one, but only with a Brahman, or a. Râganya, or a Vaisya; for these are able to sacrifice. Should there be occasion for him to converse with a Sûdra, let him say to one of those, ‘Tell this one so and so! tell this one so and so!’ This is the rule of conduct for the consecrated in such a case.</p>
<p>Samvarta Samhita verses 197 “By associating with an outcast for a month or a half, one would become purified, in half-a-month, by living upon barley and the urine of cow.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Parasara Smriti 6.43 “One should immediately come out of the room in which a Chandala has entered, and throw away all the earthen pots kept therein.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Angiras Samhita 1.49-50 “[Partaking of] a Sudra’s food, associating with a Sudra, sitting with a Sudra, acquiring knowledge from a Sudra, degrade even one burning with Brahma-energy. The twice-born person, who utters benediction before a Sudra and salutes him, that Brahmana as well as the Sudra go to hell.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Kurma Purana II.16 28-29 “The following eleven defects caused by mingling of the castes are called sins of intermixture (Samkarya Dosas) viz. sharing the same bed, sharing a common seat, sitting in the same row, sharing of the same vessel, partaking of the cooked food together, presiding over the sacrifices, teaching, marriage alliance, taking of food together, studying together, and jointly presiding over the sacrifices.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Inter-dining, sharing the same seat and doing other things together is a sign of civilization and a humane act while the Hindu scriptures views it as an evil thing.</p>
<p>Kurma Purana II.16.26-27 ”An excellent Brahmana shall not stay anywhere else except within half a Krosa of the holy river (1 Krosa=3 Km). He shall not stay near the village of the Sudras. He should not live in the same place with that of fallen castes, Candalas, Pukkasas, foolish fellows, arrogant persons, Sudras and the people of the lowliest castes called Antavasayins.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti 35.2-4 “He, who associates with an outcaste, for a year, becomes himself an outcast. Likewise, by riding in the same carriage, by sharing the same bed, and by eating (in the same row) with him.” Tr. Manmatha Nath dutt</p>
<p>Skanda Purana III.ii.6.76-77 ”Close association with fallen people is but conducive to one’s own fall. One should never offer a higher seat or rostrum to a Sudraa. (Thereby) a Brahmana becomes deficient in his Brahmanical powers and a Sudraa in his merits. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Instruction in Dharma to Sudras shall obstruct one’s own progress and glory</span>.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>A Shudra is punished if he sits on the same seat with a Brahmin</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 8.281. A low-caste man who tries to place himself on the same seat with a man of a high caste, shall be branded on his hip and be banished, or (the king) <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">shall cause his buttock to be gashed</span>.</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti 5.20 “If one (i.e., a low-caste man) sits on the same seat [with a superior caste] he, having his hip branded, shall be banished.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Varaha Purana 112.25-27 ”Once a Brahmin receives a gift from a Sudra, his ancestral manes fall into filth. No other Brahmin shall speak with him or share a seat with him. He is to kept afar. The Brahmin who, however, chances to speak with him or share a seat, shall perform Prajapatyakrcchra ceremony for purification.” Tr. Venkitasubramonia Iyer, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Vamana Purana, Saromahatmya 28.43-44 “At the time of creation Sankara was worshipped by the Lord on the northern bank of the Sarasvati known by the name Caturmukha. Having saluted Him with faith, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">a man is absolved of all sins, arising out of lustful intermixture of castes and interdining</span>.” Tr. Anand Swarup Gupta</p>
<p>Narada Purana I.41.33-38 “The Brahmanas and other castes get mixed with other castes mutually; all castes will be more or less like the Sudras, overwhelmed by lust and fury, confounded and afflicted by unncessary distress. In the Kali Yuga the excellent men become mean and the base men rise to excellence…Brahmanas become the pall-bearers of the Sudras…” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Narada Purana I.14.60b-62a “If one is touched by persons belonging to Candala and Svapaca castes, ablution (for purification) is enjoined even at night, but he shall not stay there with those low castes, at night, he will regain purity immediately after taking bath. If unknowingly a person had been careless enough to stay there (with low castes) at night, his sin is increased a hundred-fold.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Following verse shows prevalence of caste system under the reign of Rama,</p>
<p>Skanda Purana III.ii.30.93-94 “Ther was neither mental anguish nor illnes, O king, in the kingdom of Rama. All the women were chaste; all the men were devoted to their parents. Brahmanas were devoted to the (study of) Vedas always; Ksatriyas served Brahmanas. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Men of Vaisya caste continued to be devoted to Brahmanas and cows</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">There was no mixture of castes</span> and no transgression of duties. There was no barren or wretched woman; no woman had only a single child or had her child dead.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>This was the so called ideal state (Ram Rajya) of Rama.</p>
<p>Skanda Purana VII.I.206.6-7 “[Isvara said] If a Brahmana cooks food on behalf of a Sudra in the manner of Upaniksepa that food shall also be Abhojya (unfit for consumption) and the Brahmana falls down. The food of a Sudra, the association of a Sudra, occupying the same seat as the Sudra, and learning a lore from a Sudra – these will cause the fall of even the resplendent one.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>

<h2>Intermingling of castes is evils of Kali Yuga</h2>
<p>Linga Purana Section I.40.6-8 “Men perish. Ksatriyas and Vaisyas decline gradually. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">In Kali Sudras claim kinship with brahmins through their learning through interdining and sharing seats and beds</span>. Kings become mostly Sudras and they harass brahmins. Killing of foetus and murder of heroes become prevalent. Sudras adopt the conduct of life prescribed for the Brahmins and the brahmins adopt the ways of Sudras.” Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana 1.2.31.42 “Span of life, intellect, strength, beauty and prestige of the family dwindle down and become extinct. The Sudraas take to the conduct of life of the Brahmanas and the Brahmanas behave and act like Sudras.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Kurma Purana I.30.18 ”O tormentor of enemies, Sudras will be occupying lofty seats in the middle of Brahmanas. In Kali age, as a result of the influence of times, the king will dishonour the Brahmins.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Narasima Purana 54.44-46 &#8220;The Brahmanas, Ksatriyas, Vaisya and Sudra all will have over excitement and sensuality and reproduce a hybrid generation by mixing with one another. In the state of such a hybrid generation, relations like teacher and student, father and son, husband and wife will be kicked off&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Joshi K.L. Shastri and Bindiya Trivedi</p>

<p>Hinduism prohibits inter-caste marriage to an extent. It permits a Brahmin to take wives of all four castes, but at the same time also prohibits to take a Shudra wife, Yajnavalkya and Vasishta are of the same view. However this has been interpreted by some scholars as, a Brahmin can take a Shudra wife but he should not have sexual intercourse with her in her ‘courses’ which can impregnate her, in other words it prohibits a Brahmin from begetting child on a Shudra wife, a Shudra wife is taken only for sexual gratification. As per Hindu scriptures a Dvija should take his first wife from his own caste and then of succeeding castes. A Kshastriya can take wives of his own caste, a Vaishya and a Shudra wife, a Vaishya can marry women from Vaishya and a Shudra caste while a Shudra can take only one wife from his own caste.</p>
<p>Gita 1.41-43 “By the prevalence of impiety, O Krishna, the women of the family becomes corrupt. Women corrupted, there will be intermingling of castes (Varna-Samkara), O descendant of Vrishnis. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Confusion of castes leads the family of these destroyers of families also to hell</span>; for, their forefathers fall (down to hell), deprived of the offerings of pinda (rice-ball) and water. By these evil deeds of the destroyer of families which cause the intermingling of castes, the eternal dharmas of castes and families are subverted.” Tr. A. Mahadeva Sastri</p>
<p>Madhavacharya writes on Gita 1.41 “When there is a resultant intermixture of castes due to the destruction of the family structure; those who are responsible are damned to hell; but not only these ruinous family members. Their forefathers are also sent to hell as well due to the cessation of the ritual offerings of food and water that are no longer given due to the fact that there no longer exist any male descendants to perform such rites”</p>
<p>Sridhar Swami writes on Gita 1.41 “When this happens there is an intermingling of castes and the ancestors of these destroyers of the family fall from heaven as they are deprived of their periodic ritual offerings of food and water.”</p>
<p>Kesava Kasmiri writes on Gita 1.41-42 “In regard to the result of undesirable progeny. The intermixture of castes that follow the family customs and honor the age-old Vedic traditions with those that do not causes a degradation in society and leads the family to a hellish existence. Not only this but the anscestors of such a family also suffer as well because there is no descendant qualified to perform the propitiatory rites prescribed in Vedic scriptures such as <em>sraddha</em> and <em>tarpana.</em> . Being deprived of these oblations due to the absence of qualified progeny as a result of destruction of the family structure the ancestors fall down from heaven and go directly to the hellish planets. In the previous verse the effects of the intermixture of castes as described in the Vedic scriptures regarding the ancestors has been determined. Now Arjuna describes the misery experienced for those who are responsible for causing this intermixture of castes beginning with <em>dosair</em> <em>etaih.</em> Due to these evils the essential duties prescribed in the Vedic scriptures for the four castes which are the authorised and proven means leading humanity to the highest good and which are faithfully instructed by holy sages and spiritual masters are all forsaken.”</p>
<p>Swami Nikhilananda writes on Gita 1.41-42 “…Mixing of castes – One of the evil consequences of the depletion of the number of men in society is that the women break the caste rules and traditions as regards marriage. Marriage outside one’s caste is considered irregular by the Hindu law-givers. Rice-balls and water- The reference is to the Hindu religious rites for the dead, known as the Sraddha ceremony, in which rice-balls and water are offered by the eldest son for the satisfaction of the soul of the deceased. This ceremony cannot be performed by children born of irregular marriages, that is to say, marriage in which husband and wife belong to different caste, Deprived of the rice balls and water, the soul of the deceased, according to Hindu tradition, goes to hell…”</p>
<p>Usana Samita 9.51 “By marrying in another caste (i.e., a Sudra maiden), one (i.e., a Brahmana) becomes a Mahapatakin (great sinner). By associating with such a sinner, one also becomes a sinner.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Agni Purana 150.14-15 A marriage should take place only between the members of the same class, the union of a person belonging to a higher class with one of the lower being always forbidden…” Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 9.34.32-91 “…This is a general remark; now hear everything in particular. O Chaste One! The Brâhmin wives of S’ûdras or the S’ûdra wives of Brâhmanas are Atyâgamyâs (very unfit to be approached) and blameable both in the Vedas and in the society. A S’ûdra going to a Brâhmanî woman commits one hundred Brahmahattyâs; so a Brâhmana woman going to a S’ûdra goes to the Kumbhîpâka hell. As a S’ûdra should avoid a Brahmâni, so a Brâhmana should avoid a S’ûdra woman…” Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Vamana Purana 35.21-27 “…intermixing in all the varnas (castes), abandonment of Omkara…marrying a low-caste woman like a Candala…all these entail suffering in hell.” Tr. Anand Swarup Gupta</p>
<p>Skanda Purana V.i.29.27-33 “…An uncivilized Brahmana who carnally serves a Sudra woman and one who marries a Sudra woman, both of them fall into the hell…” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Death Penalty for Intercaste marriage</span></h3>
<p>If a Shudra wants to marry a Brahmin women then he is given death sentence.</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 227.131 “If a low caste man wants to marry a high caste girl and does so would be punished with death; similarly a high class woman marrying a low caste man should be punished with death.” Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>Hindu texts award lesser punishment for a Brahmin man committing adultery but awards death penalty to Shudra if he commits adultery with high caste woman. It says that the Shudra must be burnt alive,</p>
<p>Vasistha Dharma Shastra Chapter 21 Verses 1-3 If a Sûdra approaches a female of the Brâhmana caste, (the king) shall cause the Sûdra to be tied up in Vîrana grass and shall throw him into a fire. He shall cause the head of the Brâhmanî to be shaved, and her body to be anointed with butter; placing her naked on a black donkey, he shall cause her to be conducted along the highroad. It is declared that she becomes pure (thereby). If a Vaisya approaches a female of the Brâhmana caste, (the king) shall cause the Vaisya to be tied up in Lohita grass and shall throw him into a fire. He shall cause the head of the Brâhmanî to be shaved, and her body to be anointed with butter; placing her naked on a yellowish donkey, he shall cause her to be conducted along the highroad. It is declared in the Veda that she becomes pure (thereby). If a Kshatriya approaches a female of the Brâhmana caste, (the king) shall cause the Kshatriya to be tied up in leaves of Sara grass and shall throw him into a fire. He shall cause the head of the Brâhmanî to be shaved, and her body to be anointed with butter; placing her naked on a white donkey, he shall cause her to be conducted along the highroad. It is declared in the Veda that she becomes pure (thereby).</p>
<p>Arthashastra of Chanayka Book 4 Chapter 13 A Kshatriya who commits adultery with an unguarded Bráhman woman shall be punished with the highest amercement; a Vaisya doing the same shall be deprived of the whole of his property; and a Súdra shall be burnt alive wound round in mats.</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 8.374 “For having sexually visited a woman of any twice-born caste, whether protected or unprotected by her husband, a S’udra shall be punished with the mutilation of his reproductive organ and a confiscation of all his goods and estates in the first named instance (i.e., for knowing an unprotected twice-born woman), and in the last named case he shall pay the penalty with his life and all his goods and estates will be escheated to the sovereign.” Manmatha Natha Dutt</p>
<p>Gautama Dharma Shastra Chapter 23 Verse 14-15 14. A woman who commits adultery with a man of lower caste the king shall cause to be devoured by dogs in a public place. He shall cause the adulterer to be killed (also).</p>
<p>Gautama Dharma Shastra 12.2 If he [Shudra] has criminal intercourse with an Aryan woman, his organ shall be cut off, and all his property be confiscated.</p>
<p>Apastamba Dharma Shastra Prasna II, Patala 10, Khanda 27 Verse 9 A Sûdra (who commits adultery) with a woman of one of the first three castes shall suffer capital punishment</p>
<p>Mahabharata 13.48 “It is only from sexual union of women with persons who should not have such union with them that mixed classes spring up.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Mahabharata 13.91.88.90 “That Sudra who has sexual intercourse with a Brahmana woman, has, after death, to take birth as a hog. As soon as he takes birth in the porcine order he dies of disease, O king. The wretch has next to take birth as a dog. O king, in consequence of his dire act of sin. Casting off his canine form he regains upon the exhaustion of his demerit, the status of humanity. The Sudra who begets offspring upon a Brahmana woman, leaving off his human form, becomes reborn as a mouse.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Garuda Purana ch 95 “A Brahmana is at liberty to take a wife from any of the first three social orders, or to put it more explicitly, a Brahmana shall marry a girl either of his own caste, or one belonging to the warrior (Kshatriya), or to the trading (Vaishya) community. Similarly a Kshatriya shalll marry a Kshatriya or a Vaishya girl, while a Vaishya shall take a wife from his own community, the marriage of a Shudra girl with a member of any of the twice born castes being hereby absolutely forbid.” Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Manu 3.14. A Sudra woman is not mentioned even in any (ancient) story as the (first) wife of a Brahmana or of a Kshatriya, though they lived in the (greatest) distress.</p>
<p>Some interpret it as, a Brahmin should not take a Shudra wife as his first wife. He can take four wives of succeeding castes i.e., first a Brahmin, second a Kshatriya and so on, His Brahmin wife is considered superior among wives of other castes.</p>
<p>Hindu text goes on to depict Shudra wives as sex objects when it says that a Brahmin can marry a Shudra only for sexual pleasure,</p>
<p>Vasistha Dharma Shastra 18.17-18 Let him not approach a wife of the Sudra caste after he has built the fire altar for a Srauta sacrifice. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">For a Sudra wife who belongs to the black race, (is espoused) for pleasure, not in order to fulfil the law</span>.</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti 26.5 ”The Sudra wife of a Brahmana can never be for virtue. She is only the object of enjoyment of a passionate Brahmana.” Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>The son of a Brahmin born to Shudra mother shall not inherit anything,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 9.155-6 The son of a Brahmana, a Kshatriya, and a Vaisya by a Sudra (wife) receives no share of the inheritance; whatever his father may give to him, that shall be his property. All the sons of twice-born men, born of wives of the same caste, shall equally divide the estate, after the others have given to the eldest an additional share.</p>

<h1>Segregation of humans into castes</h1>
<p>Hinduism even discriminates between the style of living. Nothing can be more disgusting than this,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 10.51-54 But the dwellings of Kandalas and Svapakas shall be outside the village, they must be made Apapatras, and their wealth (shall be) dogs and donkeys. Their dress (shall be) the garments of the dead, (they shall eat) their food from broken dishes, black iron (shall be) their ornaments, and they must always wander from place to place. A man who fulfils a religious duty, shall not seek intercourse with them; their transactions (shall be) among themselves, and their marriages with their equals. Their food shall be given to them by others (than an Aryan giver) in a broken dish; at night they shall not walk about in villages and in towns.</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>Hinduism also divides the lifestyle of persons belonging to different castes, it says all castes should dress differently, should have different names, should make houses differently, it completely divides their way of living,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 2.30-32 But let (the father perform or) cause to be performed the Namadheya (the rite of naming the child), on the tenth or twelfth (day after birth), or on a lucky lunar day, in a lucky muhurta, under an auspicious constellation. Let (the first part of) a Brahmana’s name (denote something) auspicious, a Kshatriya’s be connected with power, and a Vaisya’s with wealth, but a Sudra’s (express something) contemptible. (The second part of) a Brahmana’s (name) shall be (a word) implying happiness, of a Kshatriya’s (a word) implying protection, of a Vaisya’s (a term) expressive of thriving, and of a Sudra’s (an expression) denoting service.</p>
<p>Agni Purana 152.2-8; Vishnu Purana 3.10.8-12 ”The name of a Brahmin child should end with the term ”Sharma” (the happy one), the name of a child of the Kshatrya caste should end with the term ”Varma” (the defender or protector) <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">while those of a Vaishya or a Shudra child should respectively end with the terms ”Gupta” and ”Dasa” (slave)</span>.” Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>Manu Smriti 3.8-9 Let him not marry a maiden (with) reddish (hair), nor one who has a redundant member, nor one who is sickly, nor one either with no hair (on the body) or too much, nor one who is garrulous or has red (eyes), Nor one named after a constellation, a tree, or a river, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">nor one bearing the name of a low caste</span>, or of a mountain, nor one named after a bird, a snake, or a slave, nor one whose name inspires terror.</p>
<p>Hinduism also makes discrimination in marriages,</p>
<p>Agni Purana 153.1-4 “…A Kshatriya woman having been duly wedded, should hold an arrow in her hand, a Vaishya bride should hold a paddy measure while a Shudra girl should hold a cotton string in her hand just after the wedding ceremony had been gone through…” Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Method of building houses should also be different,</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 253.13-14 ”In laying the foundations of a building or digging a tank or well first it is necessary to test the nature of the soil before commencing the operations and lying Vastua. White earth is lucky for the Brahamanas, red is good for the Ksatriyas, yellow earth for the Vaisyas, and black earth is auspicious for the Sudras. This can be ascertained by digging. The earth tasting sweet is good for the Brahmanas…and astringent earth is good for the Sudras.” Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>Natya Shastra II.46-57 Direction of pillars (first to be raised) should be different as per castes</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>Garuda Purana 1.213.143 “The procedure of bath has been laid down thus by great men. While taking bath Brahmins, Ksatriyas and Vaisyas have to repeat Mantras. A Sudra has to observe silence during bath and perform Namaskara also silently.” Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Garuda Purana chapter 94 ”A member of any of the twice born castes, shall first take two draughts of water to rinse his lips with, and then cleanse his face with undisturbed and frothless water. The twice born shall purify their breasts, throats, palates and umbilical regions with water. It will be enough for women and Shudras to purify their regions of back and umbilicus.” Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>Discrimination even at performing funeral rites,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 5.92. Let him carry out a dead Sudra by the southern gate of the town, but (the corpses of) twice-born men, as is proper, by the western, northern, or eastern (gates).</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 5.104. Let him not allow a dead Brahmana to be carried out by a Sudra, while men of the same caste are at hand; for that burnt-offering which is defiled by a Sudra’s touch is detrimental to (the deceased’s passage to) heaven.</p>
<p>Agni Purana 158.38-51 ”A Brahmana who has followed the dead body of a Shudra to the burning ground or has joined with friends of such a deceased in mourning his death, becomes pure at the expiry of three days. On a Shudra woman having been delivered of a child in the house of a Brahmana, or a Shudra having, departed his life therein, the master of the house should abstain from making any gift or from undertaking any religious ceremony for the attainment of any object, for that entire day. Cooking pots and other articles of pottery should be thrown away and the flows an walls should be plastered over with a fresh coating of clay, whereby the house would be again clean and pure…” Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti 29.1-4 “one shall not allow the dead body of a twice-born person to be carried by a Sudra. Nor [that of a] Sudra by a twice-born person…The Sudras [shall never carry the dead body of a] twice-born one even if he be their father.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas and Shudras should have umbrellas of different colors,</p>
<p>Varaha Purana 128.38 ”The white umbrella is for the Brahmin, red for Ksatriya, yellow for Vaisya, and blue for Sudra.” Tr. Venkitasubramonia Iyer, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>

<h1>Sinners will take birth as low castes</h1>
<p>Garuda Purana 4.58-63 Thus, it is declared, O Tarksya, that there are many torments for the sinful. Why should I explain them fully, when they are spoken of in all the S’astras? Being tortured thus, men and women by thousands are baked in dreadful hells until the coming of the deluge. Having eaten there their undecaying fruits they are born again. By order of Yama they return to the earth and become unmoving and other creatures: Trees, bushes, plants, creepers, rocks and grasses, these are spoken of as unmoving; enveloped in great delusion, Insects, birds, animals and fish;–it is said that there are eighty-four hundred thousands of fates of birth-fates. All these evolve thence into the human condition; having come back from hell <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">they are born in the human kingdom amongst low outcastes</span>, and even there, by the stains of sin, become very miserable.</p>
<p>Garuda Purana 5.11 Who steals jewels is born in a low caste…</p>
<p>Apastamba Dharma Sutra, Prasna 2, Patala 1, Kanda 2.6 Thus after having undergone a long punishment in the next world, a person who has stolen (the gold of a Brahmana) or killed a (Brahmana) is born again, in case he was a Brahmana as a Kandala, in case he was a Kshatriya as a Paulkasa, in case he was a.

<h1>Response to Apologists</h1>
<p>Dalits suffered the Brahmincal oppression for ages then why suddenly some people has to show equality in Hindu scriptures instead of rejecting such anti Human scriptures? If Hindu scriptures really advocated equality for all then why did the Brahmins hid those verses in their dhotis? As I said earlier they have no sympathy towards the low caste people, all they want is votes and followers. In present age they cannot enforce their inhumane Brahmin laws moreover the constitution of India giving equal rights to everyone (including Dalits) is being one of the main reason some have started to show equal status (and also to present Hinduism in good light).</p>
<p>Akhil Bhartiya Kshetriya Brahmin Mahasangh criticized Baba Ramdev’s statement that “I have studied Vedas hence I am a Brahmin”<br />
Nakul Pandey said that one becomes a Veda master by learning the Vedas but not a Brahmin. Birth, education and Karma is the neccisity to be a Brahmin, Pandey said.<br />

<p>Converts to get caste, gotra of Hindu ancestors: Yogi Adityanath<br />
<a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Converts-to-get-caste-gotra-of-Hindu-ancestors/articleshow/45515721.cms" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Converts-to-get-caste-gotra-of-Hindu-ancestors/articleshow/45515721.cms<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>So Hindu scholars are still acknowledging the fact that caste is based on birth. The most common explanation given by Hindu apologists is that,</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><strong>CLAIM</strong>:- Hinduism doesn’t believe in caste system. Caste system was actually based on the profession, by the passage of time this system became caste system. It wasn’t based on their birth but it was wholly based on the profession acquired by the individual. If a Shudra studies the Vedas, he becomes a Brahmin.</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE:-</strong></p>
<p>I don’t need to refute this point, because the greatest scholar of Hinduism, Adi Shankaracharya had refuted this long ago,</p>
<p>“The pûrvapakshin maintains that the Sûdras also have such a claim… Smriti moreover speaks of Vidûra and others who were born from Sûdra mothers as possessing eminent knowledge.–Hence the Sûdra has a claim to the knowledge of Brahman.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">To this we reply that the Sûdras have no such claim</span>, on account of their not studying the Veda. A person who has studied the Veda and understood its sense is indeed qualified for Vedic matters; but a <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Sûdra does not study the Veda, for such study demands as its antecedent the upanayana-ceremony, and that ceremony belongs to the three (higher) castes only</span>. The mere circumstance of being in a condition of desire does not furnish a reason for qualification, if capability is absent. Mere temporal capability again does not constitute a reason for qualification, spiritual capability being required in spiritual matters. And spiritual capability is <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">(in the case of the Sûdras) excluded by their being excluded from the study of the Veda</span>.–The Vedic statement, moreover, that the Sûdra is unfit for sacrifices intimates, , because founded on reasoning, that he is unfit for knowledge also;”<br />
<strong>Shankaracharya on Brahma Sutra 1.3.34</strong></p>
<p>He also said in his commentary of Brahma Sutra 1.3.36,</p>
<p>“36. On account of the reference to ceremonial purifications (in the case of the higher castes) and on account of their absence being declared (in the case of the Sûdras).</p>
<p>That the Sûdras are not qualified, follows from that circumstance also that in different places of the vidyâs such ceremonies as the upanayana and the like are referred to.”</p>
<p>The statement that ‘Shudra becomes a Brahmin if he studies the Vedas’ is a white lie. Because not even a single Hindu scripture allows a Shudra to study Vedas. As Shankaracharya rightly pointed out that a Shudra cannot study the Vedas as learning the Veda requires one to go through the Upanayana ceremony and this ceremony is permitted only for upper three castes. Smritis gives instructions only to Dvija children but they doesn’t even mention about Shudra children, It is mentioned in Manu Smriti,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 2.35-40 According to the teaching of the revealed texts, the Kudakarman (tonsure) must be performed, for the sake of spiritual merit, by all twice-born men in the first or third year. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">In the eighth year after conception, one should perform the initiation (upanayana) of a Brahmana, in the eleventh after conception (that) of a Kshatriya, but in the twelfth that of a Vaisya</span>. (The initiation) of a Brahmana who desires proficiency in sacred learning should take place in the fifth (year after conception), (that) of a Kshatriya who wishes to become powerful in the sixth, (and that) of a Vaisya who longs for (success in his) business in the eighth. The (time for the) Savitri (initiation) of a Brahmana does not pass until the completion of the sixteenth year (after conception), of a Kshatriya until the completion of the twenty-second, and of a Vaisya until the completion of the twenty-fourth. After those (periods men of) these three (castes) who have not received the sacrament at the proper time, become Vratyas (outcasts), excluded from the Savitri (initiation) and despised by the Aryans. With such men, if they have not been purified according to the rule, let no Brahmana ever, even in times of distress, form a connexion either through the Veda or by marriage.</p>

<p>As you can see Manu only gives instructions about when Dvija students should be initiated but not about Shudra students, Yajnavalkya is of the same view,</p>
<p>Yajnavalkya Smriti verse 14 In the eighth year of conception or in the eighth (year of) birth, the Upanayana ceremony of the Brahmanas, of the Ksatriyas in the eleventh; of the Vaisyas in eleven plus one. Some say according to family custom. It is mentioned in</p>
<p>It is mentioned in Agni Purana,</p>
<p>Agni Purana 152.2-8 ”The rite of Chudakaranam (binding of the tuff of hair on the crown of a child) together with that of Upanayanam (investiture with the holy thread in the case of a Brahmana child) should be performed in its eighth year or in the eighth year counted from the period of jestation, while the same should be performed in the eleventh and the twelfth year (counterd from the period of gestation) in the case of a Kshatriya, and Vaishya child respectively.” Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Acharya Medhatithi writes,</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">“…</span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #000000;">Of these four, three castes are ‘twice born’, the initiatory rite being prescribed for them. </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">‘One caste’ is the Shudra; there is no Initiatory Rite for him</span><span style="color: #000000;">; since the injunction of this rite </span><span style="color: #000000;">contains the distinct mention of the three castes, Brahmanas and the rest; e.g., the Brahmana shall be initiated in the eight year, the Ksattriya in the eleventh and the Vaishya in the twelfth; and </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">nowhere is the name of the Shudra mentioned</span><span style="color: #000000;">…” </span><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Medhatithi on Manu Smriti 10.4</span></strong></p>
<p>Vyasa Samhita 1.5-6 “The term ‘twice-born’ denotes the Brahmanas, Kshatriyas, and Vaishyas. Only these three orders are entitled to practise religious rites propounded in the Srutis, Smritis and Puranas in exclusion of all other castes. The fourth order is the Sudra, hence the Sudras, are entitled to practise religious rites, but they are not privileged to recite any Vedic Mantras, nor to pronounce the terms Savaha, Svadha and Vashat.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Apastamba Samhita 5.3 “No expiatory penance, vow, Tapassya, or Homa exists for a member of the fourth social order (Sudra).” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Narada Purana I.24.19-27 “(The duties of a Brahmana are:) He should offer charitable gifts to the Brahmans; he should worship the gods by means of sacrifices; for the sake of livelihood he may beg for alms; he should teach others. He should perform sacrifices on behalf of those who are eligible for the same; he should perpetually offer water libations; he should learn the Vedas and maintain sacrificial fires…(The duties of a Ksatriya are): O excellent Brahman, a Ksatriya should give charitable gifts to Brahmanas, he should learn the Vedas; he should worship Devas by performance of sacrifices…O excellent Brahman, breeding of cattle, commerce, agriculture and study of the Vedas are glorified as the duties of the Vaisya also…A Sudra also should give charitable gifts, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">but he should not perform domestic sacrifices involving cooking. He should render service to the Brahmans, Ksatriyas and the Vaisyas</span>.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Narada Purana says that Brahmins, Kshatriya and Vaishya should study Vedas but Shudras should engage themselves only in serving the twice-born. As you can see Hindu texts gives instructions on when Brahmin, Kshatria and Vaishya children should be initiated for Vedic study but they don’t mention about Shudra children as Shudra by birth has no right to study the Veda, they are completely barred from the Vedas.</p>

<p><strong>PERFORMANCE OF SACRIFICE IS PERMITTED ONLY FOR THREE CASTES</strong></p>
<p>Manu Smriti 2.16 “He, whose all life, from the rite of Nisheka to that of funeral, is governed by the regulations of the Sastrass, is alone competent to read, or to hear this Sastra, and no other.” Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>

<p>Yajnavalkya Smriti verse 10 “The castes are the Brahmanas, the Ksatriyas, the Vaisyas and the Sudras. Only the first three (of these) are twice-born, the performance of the ceremonies beginning with the rite of impregnation and ending (with the funeral rites) in the cremation ground, of these only, is prescribed with sacred formulas.”</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti 2.2-3 “The first three of these are (called) twice-born. For them the whole number of ceremonies, which begin with the impregnation and end with the ceremony of burning the dead body, have to be performed with (the recitation of) Mantras.</p>
<p>Mahabharata 3.149 “while to serve the twice-born orders is said to be the duty of the Sudra. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The Sudras cannot beg alms, or perform </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">homas</span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">, or observe vows</span>; and they must dwell in the habitation of their masters.” Tr.

<p><strong>Another claim is that</strong></p>
<p>If a Brahmin doesn’t study the Vedas then he becomes a Shudra</p>
<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Brahmin whether learned or illiterate is still a Brahmin due to his birth</span></h3>
<p>It’s true to an extent. If a Brahmin doesn’t study the Vedas then he looses his rank. This is actually quoted out of context. When Hindu text says “loses the rank of a Brahmin”, it connotes degradation and losing the authority to perform rites. It doesn’t literary mean that the Brahmin just by refusing to study the Vedas becomes low caste. However there are expiations for all such sins in which the Brahmin looses his rank but there is absolutely no instruction which can elevate a Shudra to the status of a Brahmin in the same life. Can any apologist quote a single verse which says that if a Shudra studies the Vedas then he can become Brahmin in the very same life? It is mentioned in Upanishad,</p>
<p>Chandogya Upanishad 6.1.1. Harih, Om. There lived once Svetaketu Aruneya (the grandson of Aruna). To him his father (Uddilaka, the son of Aruna) said: ‘Svetaketu, go to school; for there is none belonging to our race, darling, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">who, not having studied (the Veda), is, as it were, a Brahmana by birth only</span>.’</p>
<p>As you can see, a Brahmin is still considered a Brahmin just on the basis of his birth even if he has not studied the Veda. For detailed explanation on this Brahmin loosing his status issue, read the article <a href="/index.php/2014/05/01/response-to-manu-smriti-and-shudras/" data-wpel-link="internal">Response to Manu Smriti and Shudras</a>. Hindu scripture rather says that a Brahmin whether he has learned the Vedas or not is still a Brahmin. It is mentioned in Mahabharata,</p>
<p>Mahabharata 3.199.88 “Whether the <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Brahmana be cognisant of the </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Vedas</span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;"> or ignorant of them</span>, whether they be pure or impure, they should never be insulted, for Brahmanas are like fires.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>How can one remain a Brahmin if is he is ignorant of Vedas? As it is claimed by apologists that one ignorant of Vedas becomes a Shudra.</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>Mahabharata and Smriti shows that even if one is ignorant of the Vedas then he is still a Brahmin due to his birth (in a Brahmin family). Mahabharata and Maharshi Manu lists learned Brahmin and unlearned Brahmin separately,</p>
<p>Mahabharata 12.180 “Thou, O Kasyapa, art a human being! Amongst human beings, thou art again a Brahmana. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Among Brahmanas, thou art again one that is conversant with the Vedas</span>.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 1.96-97 Of created beings the most excellent are said to be those which are animated; of the animated, those which subsist by intelligence; of the intelligent, mankind; and of men, the Brahmanas; <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Of Brahmanas, those learned (in the Veda)</span>; of the learned, those who recognise (the necessity and the manner of performing the prescribed duties); of those who possess this knowledge, those who perform them; of the performers, those who know the Brahman.</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 9.317. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">A Brahmana, be he ignorant or learned</span>, is a great divinity, just as the fire, whether carried forth (for the performance of a burnt-oblation) or not carried forth, is a great divinity.</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 2.118. A Brahmana who completely governs himself, though he know the Savitri only, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">is better than he who knows the three Vedas</span>, (but) does not control himself, eats all (sorts of) food, and sells all (sorts of goods).</p>
<p>This again implies that one need not study Vedas to be a Brahmin as it is all based on one’s birth. A Brahmin whether learned or unlearned is a Brahmin. Hindu apologists should know that a learned Brahmin is called Vipra. There is an example too in Puranas where a man born in a Brahmin family was still considered a Brahmin despite not knowing Vedas and engaged in sinful activities,</p>
<p>Varaha Purana 167.3-4 “Varaha said:- In Ujjayini <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">there was a Brahmin</span> who never cared for the rules of virtuous life. He never worshipped gods and never bowed to the saints. He never bathed in any holy tirtha. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">He knew neither the Vedas nor the Vedangas</span>. He was lustful and longed for the wives of others.” Tr. Vekitasubramonia Iyer, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Vyasa Samhita 4.41-43 “One, born of the seeds of a Brahmana but not purified with any of the purificatory rites or Mantras, and making use of his caste as a means of livelihood, is called a Sama Brahmana. A Brahmana, unto whom all the purificatory rites of Garbhdanam, etc., have been performed, but who has neither read nor taught any part of the Vedas, is called a Vruva Brahmana. A Brahmana, who practises penitential austerities and performs the rite of Homa, every day, and teaches the Vedas with their Kalpas and Rahasyas, is called an Acharyaya.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Parasara Smriti 8.11 “Brahmanas, who are ignorant of the Vedas, and Gayatri and Sandhya, and those who do not cast any oblation in the sacrificial fire and live by agriculture, are only Brahmanas in name.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Vyasa Samhita 4.33 “A gift should be made to an erudiate person living at a distance in preference to an illiterate on living close by one’s house. Nothing can be humiliating (insulting) to an illiterate Brahmana.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Usana Samhita 3.118 “An illiterate Brahmana, accepting funeral cakes, gold, kine, horses, lands and sesame seeds, gets consumed like a wood” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>Manu Smriti 2.157-8 “Like unto a wooden elephant or a leathern deer, a Brahmana, who has not studied, bears only the name of a Brahmana. As a eunuch is (sexually) fruitless (unsuccessful) in respect of a woman, as (sexually) fruitless is the meeting of two cows, as fruitless is the gift to an ignorant, so fruitless (is the life of a) Brahmana who has not studied the Riks (i.e., the Vedas).” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>Vyasa Samhita 4.37-38 “A Brahmana, who has not studied the Vedas, does, like a wooden elephant, or a leather-deer, but bear the name of the genus he belongs to. Like a deserted hamlet, like a waterless well, a Brahmana, who has not read the Vedas, is a Brahmana only in name.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>The above verses praises a learned Brahmin over an unlearned Brahmin just as it is mentioned in Manu,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 1.95-99 “Of the created things the animate creatures are the highest; of the animate creatures the intelligent ones are the highest, of the intelligent creatures men are the highest, and among men the Brahmanas are the highest. Among Brahmanas the erudite ones are the highest, among the erudite Brahmanas those, who think it their duty to perform the Sastric rites, are the highest, among the latter those, who perform such rites, are the highest, and among the performers of rites the knowers of Brahma are the highest. The Brahmana has originated as the eternal embodiment of virtue. His origin is for the furtherance of virtue; he becomes of the essence of Brahma. Born as a Brahmana, he wields the supremacy of the world, the ruler of all creatures, the custodian of the treasure of virtue.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 12.92. After giving up even the above-mentioned sacrificial rites, <span style="color: #ff0000;">a Brahmana should exert himself</span> in (acquiring) the knowledge of the Soul, in extinguishing his passions, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">and in studying the Veda</span>.</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>Apologists have one more explanation. They say if a Brahmin is of evil behavior or behaves like a Shudra then he becomes a Shudra. This is wrong because it is mentioned in Manu Smriti,</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>Manu Smriti 10.73 Having considered (the case of) a non-Aryan who acts like an Aryan, and (that of) an Aryan who acts like a non-Aryan, the creator declared, ‘Those two are neither equal nor unequal.’</p>

<p>Above is Rameshvar Bhatt’s Hindi translation. The meaning of this verse is simple, A Sudra by behaving like a Brahmin doesn’t become a Brahmin likewise a Brahmin by behaving like a Shudra doesn’t become a Shudra. This is based on Pundit Tulsiram’s interpretation and various other scholars are of the same view. I am reproducing Pundit Tulsiram’s translation with commentary of Manu Smriti 10.73,<br />

<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>It is mentioned in Mahabharata,</p>
<p>Mahabharata 13.151.20-23 “<span style="color: #ff0000;">Even the Brahmana that is destitute of knowledge is a god</span> and is a high instrument for cleansing others. He amongst them, then, that is possessed of knowledge is a much higher god and like unto the ocean when full (to the brim). <span style="color: #ff0000;">Learned or unlearned, Brahmana is always a high deity</span>. Sanctified or unsanctified (with the aid of Mantras), Fire is ever a great deity. A blazing fire even when it burns on a crematorium, is not regarded as tainted in consequence of the character of the spot whereon it burns. Clarified butter looks beautiful whether kept on the sacrificial altar or in a chamber. So, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">if a Brahmana be always engaged in evil acts, he is still to be regarded as deserving of honour</span>. Indeed, know that the Brahmana is always a high deity.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>There is another verse in Manu Smriti which refutes the claim of apologists.</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 10.96 A man of low caste who through covetousness lives by the occupations of a higher one, the king shall deprive of his property and banish.</p>
<p>If caste system is based on profession then why punish the low caste for living the occupation of higher one? Hindu text also says that in time of distress when one cannot make a living with the occupation of one’s caste can live by the occupation of other castes but it doesn’t say that by acquiring the profession of higher caste the Shudra becomes a Brahmin.</p>
<p>Moreover it is prohibited to change profession,</p>
<p>Vasistha Dharma Shastra 19.7-8 Let the king, paying attention to all the laws of countries, (subdivisions of) castes (gati) and families, make the four castes (varna) fulfil their (respective) particular duties. Let him punish those who stray from (the path of duty).</p>
<p>Atri Samhita 1.17 “The king, who punishes them who, renouncing their own religion, follow another’s, becomes glorified in the celestial region. By following his own religion even a Sudra enjoys the celestial region. Another’s religion should be renounced like the most beautiful wife of another person.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>And a Dvija can live by other professions also and that doesn’t change his caste,</p>
<p>Parasara Smriti 2.15 “Even an agriculturist Kshatriya should propitiate the gods and Brahmanas with the produce of his fields. A Vaisya, or a Sudra should always live by trade, agriculture, or handicraft.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Gautama Dharma Shastra 7.6-7 On failure of the (occupation lawful for a Brahmana) he may live by the occupations of a Kshatriya. On failure of those, he may live by the occupations of a Vaisya.</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 10.81-82 But a Brahmana, unable to subsist by his peculiar occupations just mentioned, may live according to the law applicable to Kshatriyas; for the latter is next to him in rank. If it be asked, ‘How shall it be, if he cannot maintain himself by either (of these occupations?’ the answer is), he may adopt a Vaisya’s mode of life, employing himself in agriculture and rearing cattle.</p>
<p>Agni Purana 258.80-83 “… A Shudra living like a Brahmana and performing religious rites exclusively belonging to the creed of the latter, should be liable to pay a fine of eighteen hundred Panas…” Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 7.11.16-17 allows a Brahmin to take Vaishya’s occupation but no where it says that by doing so the Brahmin will become a Vaishya. I don’t have to explain this as this verse speaks for itself. There is another such verse mentioned in Tulsi Ramayana,</p>
<p>Tusli Ramayana, Aranya Kanda, Doha 33.1 A Brahmana, even though he curse you, beat you or speak harsh words to you, is still worthy of adoration; so declare the saints. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">A Brahmana must be respected, through lacking in amiability and virtue; not a Sudra, though possessing a host of virtues and rich in knowledge</span>.</p>
<p>Krishna says in Gita that one should stick to the profession even if they are imperfect in it. Now you tell me if caste was based on profession then why it’s prohibited to change the profession? Have a look at what Krishna says,</p>
<p>Gita 18.41-48 “Of Brâhmanas and Kshatriyas and Vaishyas, as also of Sudras, O scorcher of foes, the duties are distributed according to the Gunas born of their own nature. The control of the mind and the senses, austerity, purity, forbearance, and also uprightness, knowledge, realisation, belief in a hereafter,—these are the duties of the Brâhmanas, born of (their own) nature. Prowess, boldness, fortitude, dexterity, and also not flying from battle, generosity and sovereignty are the duties of the Kshatriyas, born of (their own) nature. Agriculture, cattle-rearing and trade are the duties of the Vaishyas, born of (their own) nature; and action consisting of service is the duty of the Sudras, born of (their own) nature. Devoted each to his own duty, man attains the highest perfection. How engaged in his own duty, he attains perfection, that hear…<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Better is one’s own Dharma, (though) imperfect, than the Dharma of another well-performed. He who does the duty ordained by his own nature incurs no evil</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">One should not relinquish, O son of Kunti, the duty to which one is born, though it is attended with evil; for, all undertakings are enveloped by evil, as fire by smoke</span>.” Tr. Swami Swarupananda</p>
<p>Swami Prabhupada discourages ‘changing of castes’ and advises that a Shudra should remain a Shudra,</p>
<p>“Not that a śūdra man is by force become a brāhmaṇa. You cannot improve. That is not possible. But even if he remains a śūdra and does accordingly, he will get the same position as devotee. Sva-karmaṇā tam abhyarcya sam&#8230; [Bg. 18.46]. He&#8217;ll get the perfection. At the present moment the idea is: if one remains a śūdra, then he cannot get perfection. No. Even a śūdra can get perfection provided he does the work of a śūdra perfectly. Therefore why a śūdra artificially should be a brāhmaṇa? Let them, let him remain a śūdra, and if he follows strictly the rules and regulation of śūdra, he&#8217;ll also be as good as a brāhmaṇa. The same example: Just like head is as important as my leg. It is not that because it is leg, it is less important than my head. And if you ask the head, &#8220;Do the work of a leg,&#8221; it is impossible. And if you ask the leg to work as a brain, that is impossible. Let him remain brain, let him remain leg, and do your duty and you become perfect.” <strong>Room Conversation<br />

<p>It is mentioned in Manu Smriti,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 8.20-21 <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">”The</span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;"> Judicial officer of a king must be a Brahmana even if he be a mere Brahmana by birth</span><span style="color: #ff0000;"> (and bereft of the virtues of his order), </span>or a mere professional adjudicator of issues, and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not a Sudra under any circumstances whatsoever</span>.” Tr.

<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>If the Shudra is competent enough, possess all knowledge then why a ignorant Brahmin is still considered superior than him just because of his birth as a Brahmin? Padma Purana VII.23.29 says that king named Nityodaya was a Shudra by caste but being a King didn’t change his caste. Caste system is not based on education, it’s based on birth. Normally a father would give best education to his child but Hindu text says that a son born to Dvija is still not Dvija if the mother belongs to low caste,</p>
<p>Mahabharata 13.47.17 “The son born of the Sudra wife should not be regarded as invested with the status of a Brahmana in consequence of his being unskilled (in the scriptures and the duties ordained for the Brahmana). Only those children that are born of wives belonging to the three higher orders should be regarded as invested with the status of Brahmanas.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>

<p>Apologists misinterpret Hindu text to show that some personalities attained higher castes. It’s true that one attains higher caste in the next life but in no way can one attain higher caste in the same life. As per Hindu text it is only in next birth that a man attains higher caste or is degraded to lower caste.</p>
<p>Apastamba Dharma Sutra 2.5.11.10-11 In successive births men of the lower castes are born in the next higher one, if they have fulfilled their duties. In successive births men of the higher castes are born in the next lower one, if they neglect their duties.</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 10.42. By the power of austerities and of the seed (from which they sprang), <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">these (races) obtain here among men more exalted or lower rank in successive births</span>.</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 9.334-5 <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">But to serve Brahmanas (who are) learned in the Vedas</span>, householders, and famous (for virtue) is the highest duty of a Sudra, which leads to beatitude. (A Sudra who is) pure, the servant of his betters, gentle in his speech, and free from pride, and always seeks a refuge with Brahmanas, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">attains (in his next life) a higher caste</span></p>
<p>Mahabharata, Anusasana Parva, 13.28 “…If born as human being, he is sure to take birth as a Pukkasa or a Chandala. Verily, one having taken birth in that sinful order of existence, viz., Pukkasa, one, O Matanga, has to wander in it for a very long time. Passing a period of one thousand years in that order, one attains next to the status of a Sudra. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">In the Sudra order, again, one has to wander for a long time. After thirty thousand years one acquire the status of a Vaisya</span>. There, in that order, one has to pass a very long period. After a time that is sixty times longer than what has been stated as the period of Sudra existence, one becomes a person of the fighting order. In the Kshatriya order one has to pass a very long time. After a time that is measured by multiplying the period last referred to by sixty, one becomes born as a fallen Brahmana. In this order one has to wander for a long period. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">After a time measured by multiplying the period last named by two hundred, one becomes born in the race of such a Brahmana</span> as lives by the profession of arms. There, in that order, one has to wander for a long period. After a time measured by multiplying the period last named by three hundred, <span style="color: #ff0000;">one takes birth in the race of a Brahmana that is given to the recitation of the Gayatri and other sacred Mantras</span>. There, in that order, one has to wander for a long period. After a time measured by multiplying the period last named by four hundred, one takes birth in the race of such a Brahmana as is conversant with the entire Vedas and the scriptures…” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>So no matter what you do, you should perform duties prescribed for your castes and only after few thousand years you can attain higher caste.</p>
<p>Some examples:-</p>
<p>Skanda Purana V.ii.22 A Kshatriya king was a Shudra named Somaka in one of his previous birth.</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 1.13.15 Yama was cursed by Sage Manduka and was born as a Shudra</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 7.15.72-73 Sage Narada was cursed to become Shudra from the womb of a maidservant and after his birth by serving the Brahmins he took birth as a Brahmana.</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Kotirudra Samhita 4.9.3 A Brahmin lady named Saumini had become an outcaste in her next birth.</p>
<p>Mahabharata 13.10 In consequence of the merit he acquired by those practices, the Sudra in the next life, took birth in the family of a great king, and in course of time became possessed of great splendour</p>
<p>Prabhupada writes on SB 4.30.48 ” In this connection the word mahad-avajñānāt is significant. King Dakṣa was the son of Lord Brahmā; therefore in a previous birth he was a brāhmaṇa.<br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">But because of his behaving like a non-</span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">brāhmaṇa</span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;"> (</span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">abrāhmaṇa</span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">) by insulting or disrespecting </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Lord Mahādeva, he had to take birth within the semen of a </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">kṣatriya</span> — that is to say, he became the son of the Pracetās.”</p>
<p>A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada on Bhagvad Purana 4.30.48 <a href="http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_4.30.48" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_4.30.48<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>As you can read, all these people attained higher or were degraded to lower caste only in their next birth. As it is mentioned in the Hindu law book Apastamba 2.5.11.10-11 that only in successive births men take higher caste or are degraded to low caste. And why should god assign this? Is Hindu god a job recruiter who commands that people born in specific caste must perform specific job. Dr. B.R. Ambedkar was born in a Dalit family but due to his hard work he became the first Minister of Law and Justice and was also the chairman of Constitution drafting committee. It’s not like if a person is born in family of specific should continue to do his family business, people have varied interests. Wasn’t Hindu god aware of this fact? This is my reply to the apologists.</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>Caste system is an integral part of Hinduism, you cannot be a Hindu and reject caste system. Caste system is an evil which Hinduism has produced and upheld in India. Message of god is eternal it cannot be outdated like Hinduism. It is no different than the racial discrimination fought by Nelson Mandela. Such evil thing surely cannot be from god.</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>

<p>Read the new article <a href="/index.php/2014/12/27/hinduism-lust/" data-wpel-link="internal">Hinduism and Lust</a> for obscenity in other Hindu sciptures</p>
<p>This article is not intended to offend Hindus, I have written this article only for those Hindus who thinks only Hinduism is a pure religion free from obscenity and all other religions are full of obscenities. Such people are perverts that’s why they only look for sex related things in other religions, their minds are filled with lust.</p>
<p>Sexuality was not a secret thing in Vedic period as it is evident from Hindu places of worship like Khajuraho, Ajanta, Ellora temples and scriptures like Kama Sutra and various other Hindu texts which openly spoke or showed pornography.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.indiatimes.com/culture/who-we-are/14-temples-in-india-where-you-get-a-lot-more-than-just-the-traditional-prasad-231878.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">http://www.indiatimes.com/culture/who-we-are/14-temples-in-india-where-you-get-a-lot-more-than-just-the-traditional-prasad-231878.html<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>It was only in recent times when Hinduism was influenced by other religions that it took shelter in modesty. Despite such facts some Hindu fanatics do not hesitate mocking other religions especially other religious personalities. I am reproducing some verses from Vedas, which is the oldest text of Hinduism.</p>
<p><span id="more-5660"></span></p>
<p><strong>SEX POSITIONS IN VEDAS</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.110.5 Spacious doors remain wide open like beautiful wives for their husbands. O divine doors, great and all-impellers, be easy of access to the gods.<br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="510" height="199" class="wp-image-7366" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2014-05-rig-.png" alt="https://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/rig-veda-10-110-5.png?w=510&amp;h=199" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2014-05-rig-.png 510w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2014-05-rig--300x117.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 510px) 100vw, 510px" /></p>
<p>Yaska Acharya explains this verse as</p>
<p>Nirukta 8.10 ”Having spaciousness, make yourself wide open as exceedingly beautiful wives do their thighs for their husbands in sexual intercourse. The thighs are the most beautiful parts (of the body)…” Tr. Lakshman Swarup</p>
<p>The next verse is even more obscene,</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 19.88 ‘‘Just as a wife, the recipient of semen, at the time of cohabitation keeps her head opposite to the head of the husband, and her face opposite to that of his, so should both husband and wife perform together their domestic duties. A husband is a protector like a physician. He lives happily like a child, and with tranquillity produces progeny with penis keen with ardour.” Tr. Devi Chand (Arya Samaj)</p>
<p>Following is the Arya Samaj Hindi translation with commentary</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="526" height="250" class="wp-image-7367" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2014-05-yaju.png" alt="https://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/yajur-veda-19-88.png?w=526&amp;h=249" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2014-05-yaju.png 526w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2014-05-yaju-300x143.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 526px) 100vw, 526px" /></p>

<p>A verse in Atharva reads as follows,</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 14.2.38 “O Men, you are the strengtheners. You inspire into this lady well-wisher of you and your family the spirit of procreating children. This woman is such an entity in whom the men sow semen-seed, who desiring progeny spread her thigh towards her husband and in whom the husband like you and us thrust organ with the desire of children. O happy bride-groom mount over thigh of your wife and touch with hand, in a joyus spirit your wife. You both delighted with joy procreate children…”” Tr. Acharya Vaidyanath Shastri (Arya Samaj)</p>
<p>Another verse reads as,</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 14.2.71 ”O bride, I am Amah and you are Saa I am Saman and you are Rik and I am sun and you earth. Let both of us unite together and procreate progeny.” Tr. Vaidyanath Shastri (Arya Samaj)</p>
<p>As per Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 6.4.20-22 this verse should be recited before sexual intercourse after embracing each other. The passage from Brihadaranyaka Upanishad which is a commentary on this verse also tells a sex position in obscene manner, for more information readers are requested to go through the article <a href="/index.php/2014/12/27/hinduism-and-lust/" data-wpel-link="internal">Hinduism and Lust</a></p>
<p><strong>TRANSGENDERISM/HOMOSEXUALITY IN VEDAS</strong></p>
<p>We read in newspaper about some Hindu scholars condemning homosexuality. But do they have any evidence that prohibits homosexuality in Hinduism? Hindu scholars fail to furnish any reference from authoritative text like Vedas which condemns homosexuality but still some try to term homosexuality as irreligious act. Fortunately there are some Hindu scholars like Shri Shri Ravishankar who honestly accept such facts, below are two snapshots of his tweets<br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="406" height="429" class="wp-image-7368" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2014-05-homo.jpeg" alt="https://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/homosexuality-shiva-vishnu-ravishankar.jpg?w=406&amp;h=429" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2014-05-homo.jpeg 406w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2014-05-homo-284x300.jpeg 284w" sizes="(max-width: 406px) 100vw, 406px" /></p>
[Source: <a href="http://www.firstpost.com/india/homosexuality-not-a-crime-in-hinduism-says-sri-sri-ravi-shankar-1283843.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right"><strong>http://www.firstpost.com/india/homosexuality-not-a-crime-in-hinduism-says-sri-sri-ravi-shankar-1283843.html</strong><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>]
<p>Although we are aware of the homosexual act of Vishnu and Shiva but homosexuality/transgenderism is present in Vedas too. In Veda Indra transformed himself into a woman,</p>
<p>अददा अर्भां महते वचस्यवे कक्षीवते वर्चयामिन्द्र सुन्वते |<br />
मेनाभवो वर्षणश्वस्य सुक्रतो विश्वेत ता ते सवनेषु परवाच्या ||</p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.51.13 To old Kaksivin, Soma-presser, skilled in song, O Indra, thou didst give the youthful Vrcaya. Thou [Indra], very wise, was wife [Mena] of Vrisanaiva; those deeds of thine must all be told at Soma feasts.</p>
<p>Griffith has translated the word Mena as daughter/child but according to Brahmana, Purana and lexicons the word Mena denotes wife, woman, or female of any animal. Griffith wrote, &#8220;Mena: according to a later legend, Indra became, himself, the daughter of King Vrishanasva.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yaska Acharya gives the following meaning for Mena (also spelled Menah),<br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="300" height="46" class="wp-image-7369" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2014-05-niru.jpeg" alt="https://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/nirukta-3-21.jpg?w=300&amp;h=46" /></p>
<p>Nirukta 3.21 ”Menah and Gnah are (synonyms) of Women.” Tr. Lakshman Swarup</p>
<p>”मेना Mena – Wife, female”- Cappeller’s Sanskrit English Dictionary</p>
<p>It is also confirmed in Satapatha Brahmana that Indra became the wife of Vrishanasva,</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana 3.3.4.18. ‘Come, O Indra!’ Indra is the deity of the sacrifice: therefore he says, ‘Come, O Indra!’ ‘Come, O lord of the bay steeds! Ram of Medhatithi ! Wife of Vrishanasva ! Bestriding buffalo! Lover of Ahalya’ Thereby he wishes him joy in those affairs of his.</p>
<p>Baudhayana Srauta Sutra XIX.10 &#8220;&#8230;Indra, do thou come. Thou with the tawny seeds come, Ram of Medhatithi. Mena of Vrsanasva. Buffalo leaping down. Lover of Ahalya. Brahmana of Kusika&#8217;s clan. Thou that callest thyself Gautama&#8230;&#8221; Tr. C.G. Kashikar</p>
<p>Maitrayani Samhita 2.5.5 ”When Indra became Vrishanasva’s Mena [or wife] he was seized by Nirrti, Calamity. When he chased it away, that Calamity became a castrated animal. Whoever thinks he is seized by Calamity, Darkness, he should sacrifice this castrated animal to Indra.”-Tr. Feller.</p>
<p>Indra is considered the wife of Vrishanasva in Satapatha Brahama, as we all know Indra lusted after Ahalya thus he is also called the lover of Ahalya in the Satapatha Brahmana. From major sources like Satapatha Brahmana, Baudhayana Srauta Sutra, and Maitrayani it is proved that Indra indeed became the wife of Vrishnasva. Another transgender story is mentioned in the Atharva Veda where Indra assumed the form of a woman to have sex with an Asuri named Vilistenga.</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 7.38.2 This Herb wherewith the Asuri drew Indra downward from the Gods, With this same Herb I draw thee close that I may be most dear to thee.</p>
<p>Kathaka Samhita 13.5 &#8220;Indra desired the Danavi Vilistenga. He went to the Asuras and became a woman among women and a man among men. He thought he was seized by Nirrti (the goddess of Calamity or Misfortune). He saw (as a sacrificial offering) this castrated animal consecrated to Indra and to Nirrti. In that form in which he went about (i.e. castrated), such an animal he offered in sacrifice.&#8221; Tr. Danielle Feller</p>
<p>This story is further elaborated in Brhaddevata. According to Shaunaka Rishi, Indra after transforming himself into a woman had sex with a Danavi which can be considered Lesbianism.</p>
<p>Brhaddevata VI.76-76 &#8220;In &#8216;Downward&#8217; (adhah: viii.33.19) a girl addressed Indra (who appeared) with the characteristics of a woman&#8217; for the chastiser of Paka (Indra) made love to that Danava maiden, the eldest sister of Vyamsa, by reason of his (Indra&#8217;s youthful desire (yuva-kamya)&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Arthur Anthony Macdonnel</p>
<p>Arthur Anthony Macdonnel wrote in the footnotes,</p>
<p>&#8220;That is, this stanza is addressed by a Danavi to Indra who has assumed the form of a woman. According to Sayana on RV. viii.33.19 this stanza is addressed to Asanga Playogi when he was a woman (cp. above, vi.41). And has assumed the disguise of a woman because Vyamsa was his enemy.&#8221;</p>
<p>There is another transgender story mentioned in Rig Veda which says that Asanga son of Playoga had become a woman after he was cursed by gods,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 8.33.19 Cast down thine eyes and look not up. More closely set thy feet. Let none See what thy garment veils, for thou, a Brahman, hast become a dame.<br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="106" class="wp-image-7370" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2014-05-rig-1-1.png" alt="https://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/rig-veda-8-33-19.png?w=500&amp;h=105" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2014-05-rig-1-1.png 500w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2014-05-rig-1-1-300x64.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is elaborated in later texts as,</p>
<p>Brhaddevata of Shaunaka VI.41 &#8220;The seer turned that Asanga, who had been a woman, into a man (again)&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Arthur Anthony Macdonnel</p>
<p>Sankhayana Srauta Sutra XVI.11.16-18 &#8220;The sixth is that relating to Medhatithi, how Asanga, the son of Plyoga, being a woman became a man&#8230;&#8221; Tr. W. Caland</p>
<p><strong>Rape</strong></p>
<p>There’s a verse in Rig Veda which reads as,</p>
<p>यः सत्राहा विचर्षणिरिन्द्रं तं हूमहे वयम |<br />
सहस्रमुष्क तुविन्र्म्ण सत्पते भवा समत्सु नो वर्धे ||</p>
<p>yaḥ satrāhā vicarṣaṇirindraṃ taṃ hūmahe vayam |<br />
sahasramuṣka tuvinṛmṇa satpate bhavā samatsu no vṛdhe ||</p>
<p>Rig Veda 6.46.3 “We invoke that Indra who is the destroyer of mighty foes, the supervisor (of all things): do thou, the many-organed, the protector of the good, the distributor of wealth, be unto us (the insurer of) success in combats.” Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>The Sanskrit word mentioned here to describe Indra is Sahastra+Mushka which means thousand vaginas/testicles. Some translators including Griffith has translated this word as “thousand powers” but I do not agree with it since the word Mushka ( मुष्क ) clearly means Vagina/Testicles, Mushka here definitely means vagina because there is evidence from other Hindu text to support “thousand vagina” definition. Whether the word Mushka means Vagina or testicle is not an issue but a Vedic god described as being with “A Thousand Testicles” in holy scripture is surely obscene. One can check the meaning of Mushka ( मुष्क ) in V.S Apte’s dictionary available online <a href="http://dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/contextualize.pl?p.4.apte.2383229" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">uchicago.edu<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> and also from another online dictionary <a href="http://spokensanskrit.org/index.php?mode=3&amp;script=hk&amp;tran_input=mushka&amp;direct=au" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Spokensanskrit.de<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. The story as mentioned in Skanda Purana V.iii.136.2-16; Brahma Purana, Gautami-Mahatmya 16.59 states that Indra was cursed by Sage Gautama to be with one thousand Vaginas all over the body as Indra had raped Sage Gautam’s wife Ahalya which I have explained briefly in <a href="/index.php/2014/12/27/hinduism-and-lust/" data-wpel-link="internal">Hinduism and Lust</a> article. Sayana interprets the word Sahasra Mushka as Sahasra-Shepha (thousand penises),</p>

<p>Maharshi Yaska mentions a strange story about the birth of Asvins (the twin horsemen). Which is a elaboration of Rig Veda Mandal 10, hymn 17. The story says Saranyu was unwilling to have sex with Vivasvat and ran away but Vivasvat chased her and raped her. Yaska writes,</p>
<p>Nirukta 12.10 ”Saranyu daughter of Tvastr bore twins, Yama and Yami, to Vivasvat the sun. She having substituted another lady of similar appearance, and having assumed the shape of a mare, ran away. He, Vivasvat, the sun, having also assumed the shape of a horse, pursued her, and joined her. Thence the Asvins were born. Manu was born from the lady of similar appearance.” Tr. Lakshman Swarup</p>
<p>This story of Vivasvat raping his wife by inserting penis in her mouth is further elaborated in Brahma Purana 4.42-43; Shiva Purana, UmaSamhita 5.35.32-34; Matsya Purana 11.34-37 and Brahmanda Purana 2.3.59.74-76 which I have mentioned in <a href="/index.php/2014/12/27/hinduism-and-lust/" data-wpel-link="internal">Hinduism and Lust</a> article under Oral Sex category. The question is how sun god was aroused seeing his wife who was in the form of a mare? It must have been that Vedic god Vivaswat was sexually attracted towards animals that’s the reason he raped his wife whilst she was in the form of a mare. But Vedas also has mention of bestiality.</p>
<p><strong>SEX WITH ANIMALS</strong></p>
<p>Some protestant Hindus proudly promote Vedas as philosophical, free from all vulgarities. But in reality there is no limit for Vulgarity in Vedas. It even promotes sex with animals let alone adultery and pornography. Sex with animals in Hinduism is not a vulgar thing, Ancient Hindu temples like Khajuraho, Ajanta, Ellora clearly depicts men and girls having sex with animals.</p>
<p><strong>ASHVAMEDHA YAJNA </strong></p>
<p>Read the article <a href="/index.php/2018/05/14/ashvamedha-yajna-the-obscene-ritual/" data-wpel-link="internal">Ashvamedha Yajna The Obscene</a> for more evidence</p>
<p>Ashvamedha Yajna is a ritual performed by Queens (particularly by chief queen) for fertility and also to gain power in the kingdom. The Ashvamedha Yajna includes slaughtering the horse, then follows the obscene Queen’s intercourse with the horse, then the horse is cut into pieces and cooked. However some Hindus due to extreme obscenity reject these facts and are giving their personal interpretations. They even deny the fact that Horse was slaughtered during the ritual, I request the readers to go through the article <a href="/index.php/2018/01/01/meat-consumption-in-hinduism/" data-wpel-link="internal">Meat Consumption in Hinduism</a>.</p>
<p>It is mentioned both in Krishna and Yajur Veda, but the this sacrifice mentioned in Krishna Yajur Veda is obscure because the author has omitted those verses,</p>
<p>Krishna Yajur Veda 7.4.19 The wicked horse is sleeping. O fair one, clad in fair raiment in the world of heaven be ye two covered ….{…several verses omitted from original translation…} <a href="http://sacred-texts.com/hin/yv/yv07.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Sacred-texts.com<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>It is mentioned in Shukla Yajur Veda,</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 23.19-21 All wife of the host reciting three mantras go round the horse. While praying, they say: ‘O horse, you are, protector of the community on the basis of good qualities, you are, protector or treasure of happiness. O horse, you become my husband’. After the animal is purified by the priest, the principal wife sleeps near the horse and says: ‘O Horse, I extract the semen worth conception and you release the semen worth conception. The horse and principal wife spread two legs each. Then the Ardhvaryu(priest) orders to cover the oblation place, raise canopy etc. After this, the principal wife of the host pulls penis of the horse and puts it in her vagina and says: “This horse may release semen in me. Then the host, while praying to the horse says: “O horse, please throw semen on the upper part of the anus of my wife. Expand your penis and insert it in the vagina because after insertion, this penis makes women happy and lively.</p>
<p><strong>LICENTIOUS ACT OF VEDIC GODS</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 7.33.11 Born of their love for Urvasi, Vasistha thou, priest, art son of Varuna and Mitra; And as a fallen drop, in heavenly fervour, all the Gods laid thee on a lotus-blossorn.<br />

<p>Above is Pundit Ram Govind Trivedi’s Hindi translation. Yaska Acharya writes on this verse,</p>
<p>Nirukta 5.13 “Urvashi is (the name of) a naiad, (so called because) she pervades wide regions (uru + as- to pervade ‘), or she pervades by means of thighs [Sexual Intercourse] …On seeing her, the seminal fluid of Mitra and Varuna fell down. Tr. Lakshman Swarup</p>
<p>It is mentioned in Bhagwad Purana/Srimad Bhagavatam (ISKCON translation)</p>
<p>Bhagavad Purana (Srimad Bhagavatam) 6.18.6 Upon seeing Urvaśī, the celestial society girl, both Mitra and Varuṇa discharged semen, which they preserved in an earthen pot. The two sons Agastya and Vasiṣṭha later appeared from that pot, and they are therefore the common sons of Mitra and Varuṇa. Mitra begot three sons in the womb of his wife, whose name was Revatī. Their names were Utsarga, Ariṣṭa and Pippala.</p>
<p>Bhagavad Purana (Srimad Bhagavatam) 9.13.6 After saying this, Mahārāja Nimi, who was expert in the science of spiritual knowledge, gave up his body. Vasiṣṭha, the great-grandfather, gave up his body also, but through the semen discharged by Mitra and Varuṇa when they saw Urvaśī, he was born again.</p>
<p>Brhaddevata V.149-150 &#8220;Of these two Adityas, when they saw the nymph Urvasi at a sacrificial session, the semen was effused. It fell into a jar containing water that stood overnight. Now at the same moment two vigorous ascetics, the seers Agastya and Vasistha, there came into being.&#8221; Tr. Arthu Anthony Macdonnel</p>
<p><strong>VEDIC GODS HAVING SEX WITH THE SAME WOMAN AND IMPREGNATING HER</strong></p>
<p>”Pushan, inspire her who is most auspicious, in whom men may sow seed, who most affectionate. may be devoted to us, and in whom animated by desire we may beget progeny. (The Gandharvas) gave Surya to thee, Agni, with her bridal ornaments ; do thou, Agni, give (us) husbands our wife back again with male offspring. Agni gave the wife back again with life and splendour; may he who is her husband enjoying long life live a hundred years. Soma first obtained the bride;the Gandharva obtained her next ; Agni was thy third husband ; thy fourth (husband) is born of man. Soma gave her to the Gandharva; the Gandharva gave her to Agni ; Agni has given her to me and wealth and sons.” Rig Veda 10.85.37-41, Tr. Wilson [See below for Arya Samaj translation]
<p>This is also mentioned in Atharva Veda,</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 14.2.3-4 She was the wife of Soma first: next the Gandharva was thy lord. Agni was the third husband: now one born of woman is thy fourth. Soma to the Gandharva, and to Agni the Gandharva gave. Now, Agni hath bestowed on me riches and sons and this my bride.</p>
<p>It is mentioned in Agni Purana,</p>
<p>Agni Purana 165.19-20 ”The gods first enjoy the women, then the Moon-god, after them the Gandharvas, subsequently the Fire-god, and last of all the mortals; and hence they can never be polluted.” Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Atri Samhita 1.190 “Women were first enjoyed by the Celestials; then by the moon, the Gandharvas and the Fires. Afterwards came men to enjoy them. They are never affected by any sin.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Arya Samaji scholar named Vaidyanath Shastri tries to link 4th verse of Atharved to Niyoga, another scholar named Kshemkarandas Trivedi explains 4th verse in terms of Niyoga, Another proof is that Swami Dayanand Saraswati had also used a verse from the same hymn, He used Atharva Veda 14.2.18 as well as verses from Rig Veda 10.85 hymn as evidence for Niyoga. Pandit Jaydev Sharma endorsed Dayanand Saraswati’s views and commenting on 4th verse he makes a mention of the passage written by Dayanand. Swami Dayanand Saraswati wrote,</p>
<p>‘’A. ~ “O woman! Thy first husband with whom thou art united by marriage is named Soma, called so because he was a chaste bachelor (before marriage). Thy second husband with whom thou art connected by Niyoga is named Gaandharva, called so because he had already lived with another woman (to whom he had been united by marriage). Thy third husband, (by Niyoga) is named Agni (fire), called so because he so very passionate. All thy other husbands from the fourth to the eleventh are called men.’’ <strong>Satyarth Prakash, Ch 4, p.136, by Swami Dayanand Saraswati, Tr. Chiranjiva Bhardwaja</strong>.</p>
<p>The fact that Arya Samaj scholars are trying to link these verses to Niyoga proves that sex is involved hence also proves that Vedic deities had sex with the same woman and impregnated her. Still some people may regard this as allegorical to escape but explanation from Agni Purana and Swami Dayanand is enough to prove the point. This verse can also be used to prove Polyandry. They try their level best to hide these vulgar things, example is the passage by Dayanand who tries to turn the names of Vedic deities to normal men. The verses I quoted above are perhaps not related to Niyoga but Dayanand Saraswati tries to justify the filthy act of gods by linking it to Niyoga (Which is also a filth).</p>
<p><strong>ADULTERY AND PROSTITUTION IN VEDA</strong></p>
<p>Swami Parmeshwaranand writes</p>
<p>”Jara [Lover] is always explained as Upapati (paramour) by Sayana. There is hardly any reference in the Rig Veda which might suggest that a lover was looked down upon or was considered morally wrong or corrupt. Sayana also does not consider loving sinful.”</p>
<p>As Swami Parmeshwaranand said Jara, which is translated as Lover, Paramour and Gallant wasn’t considered wrong, in fact Vedas promotes adultery, Maharishi Manu writes,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 5.56 There is no sin in eating meat, in (drinking) spirituous liquor, and in carnal intercourse, for that is the natural way of created beings, but abstention brings great rewards</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rig Veda mentions story of Apala the daughter of Atri who suffered from skin-disease. She was married but her husband had left her. Indra was attracted to her, she chewed Soma plant which was then drunk by Indra from her mouth. To cure her, Indra dragged her through the wide hole of his chariot, the narrower hole of the cart, and the small hole of the yoke, and she cast off three skins. The first skin became a hedgehog, the second an alligator, and the third a chameleon.</p>
<p>Rig Veda 8.80.1-7 &#8220;A young woman going to the water found Soma in the path; as she carried it home she said, I will press thee for Indra, I will press thee for Sakra. Thou who goest from house to house a hero bright in thy splendour, drink this Soma pressed by my teeth, together with fried grains of barley, the karambha, cakes, and hymns&#8230;May (Indra) repeatedly make us powerful, may he do abundantly for us, may he repeatedly make us very rich; often hated by our husband and forced to leave him, may we be united to Indra. These three places, do thou cause them all to grow, my father&#8217;s (bald) head, his (barren) field, and my body. This field which is our (father&#8217;s), and this my body, and the head of my father, do thou make all these bear a crop. Thrice, Satakratu, didst thou purify Apala, in the hole of the chariot, in the hole of the cart, and in the hole of the yoke, and thou didst make her with a skin resplendent like the sun.&#8221; Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Shaunaka wrote on these verses,</p>
<p>Brhaddevata VI.99-106 &#8220;There was once a girl Apala, daughter of Atri, who suffered from skin-disease. With her Indra fell in love, having seen her in the lonely hermitage of her father. Now by penance she became aware of all Indra&#8217;s intentions. Taking a water-pot she went to fetch water. Seeing Soma at the edge of the water, she praised him with a stanza in the forest. This matter is related in the (stanza) &#8216;A maiden to the water&#8217; (kanya vah: viii.91.1). She pressed Soma in her mouth: and having pressed it she invoked Indra with the (stanza), &#8216;Thou that goest&#8217; (asau ya esi: viii.91.2); and Indra drank it from her mouth, after he had eaten cakes and meal from her house. And she praised him with stanzas, but with a triplet (viii.91.4-6) she addressed him (saying), &#8216;Make me, O Sakraa, to have abundant hair, (and) to be faultless-limbed, (and) fair-skinned.&#8217; Indra passing (praksipya) her through the carriage aperture (between the body of the car and the yoke, drew her forth three times. Then she became fair-skinned. Her first skin which was cast off became a porcupine (salyaka), but the next became an alligator (godha), and the last a chameleon (krkalasa).&#8221; Tr. Arthu Anthony Macdonnel</p>
<p>There are numerous verses which praises adultery,</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 5.5.3 Thou clingest close to every tree, as a fond damsel clasps her love.<br />

<p>Rig Veda 3.52.3 ”Relish, O illustrious Lord, our delicious roasted corn and butter. Derive enjoyment from our praises, as a lover from his beloved.” Tr. SatyaPrakash Saraswati (Arya Samaj)</p>
<p>Wilson’s translation for this verse,</p>
<p>”Eat, Indra, our (offered) cakes and butter; derive enjoyment from our praises, as a lover from his mistress.”</p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.134.3 ”…O Vayu, come and wake up and energise life like a lover who wakes up and impassions a sleeping beauty…” Tr. Tulsi Ram (Arya Samaj)</p>
<p>Rig Veda 3.33.10 Yea, we will listen to thy words, O singer. With wain and car from far away thou comest. Low, like a nursing mother, will I bend me, and yield me as a maiden to her lover.</p>
<p>Maharishi Yaska writes,</p>
<p>Nirukta 2.27 “We bend down for thy sake, as a nursing mother for her son, or as a maiden bends herself to embrace her lover.” Tr. Lakshman Swarup</p>
<p>Verses from Rig Veda 6.75.4, 9.96.23 and 9.101.14 likens the meeting of lovers to Hindu gods, But what’s more interesting is that the Vedic heroes are considered Maiden’s lovers. However Agni being maiden’s lover is regarded by some as allegorical, but still this doesn’t disapprove the existence of illicit relationship and it promotes adultery,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.66.4 Yama, indeed, is what is born, Yama, what shall be born; he [Agni] is the maidens’ lover, the matrons’ lord.</p>
<p>सेनेव सर्ष्टामं दधात्यस्तुर्न दिद्युत तवेषप्रतीका |<br />
यमो ह जातो यमो जनित्वं जारः कनीनां पतिर्जनीनाम ||<br />

<p>These verses clearly shows that adultery wasn’t deemed morally wrong, this is why there are numerous verses praising adultery but no where prohibits it. Prostitution was also prevalent in the Vedic period. It is still prevalent in some temples especially in south India where girls are forced to become Devdasi. Devdasi actually means slave or servant of god but they are sexually tortured by the Brahmins, these licentious priests sanction <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacred_prostitution" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Sacred Prostitution<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, which is also known as Temple prostitution. However looking in the Vedas one can find the origins of prostitution.</p>

Rig Veda 1.167.4 Far off the brilliant, never-weary Maruts cling to the Sadharani as a joint possession…</p>
<p>The Sanskrit word used here is Sadharani (after separating the words) referring to common woman, public woman or prostitute.</p>
<p>“Sadharani or Samanya (common), synonyms for prostitute, distinguish her as a woman possessed by not one man; this is the desideratum”- (Bhattacharji 1987, 33). [<a href="https://digital.library.txstate.edu/bitstream/handle/10877/4716/SOHAL-THESIS-2013.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Source<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>]
<p>Monier Williams translates it as ”Common to all”. Wilson also translates it as common woman or it may also be referring to a common wife like Draupadi.</p>
<p>Temple prostitution or sacred prostitution is still prevalent in many parts of India,<br />
As per Theguardian.com’s 2011 report “The National Commission for Women estimate that there are 48,358 Devadasis currently in India.”</p>

<p>And as per TheHindu.com</p>
<p>Quoting the National Commission for Women, the authority says there are 2.5 lakh “Devadasi” girls who have been dedicated to Yellamma and Khandoba temples on Maharastra-Karnataka border. This includes 16,624 from Andhra Pradesh, 22,941 from Karnataka and 2,479 from Maharastra. The Devadasi system is prevalent in 10 districts of north Karnataka and 14 districts in Andhra Pradesh.</p>

<p>As per Vedas everyone is born with a destined profession including prostitution based on their past deeds, it is mentioned that</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 30.5 ”For Brahman (Priesthood) he binds a Brahman to the stake… for Kama [Sex] a harlot…”</p>
<p>Some people try to explain this verse by misquoting it, they translate it as,</p>
<p>” May the Lord (of world as well as country) give due reward or punishment to various people – Brahmin for promotion of wisdom…”</p>
<p>I am reproducing two Hindi translations by Shri Ram Sharma Acharya and Swami Karpatri Maharaj<br />

<p>Word by Word translation,</p>
<p>Brahmane Brahmanam = For priesthood (he binds) a Brahmin.</p>
<p>Kshatriya Rayanam = For a Kshatriya Rajanya (Kingdom, Governance).</p>
<p>Tapse Shudram = For penance a Shudra.</p>
<p>Tamse taskaram = For darkness a robber.</p>
<p>Narkaya Virhanam = For hell a homicide.</p>
<p>Paapmane Klibam = For misfortune/Sin a eunuch.</p>
<p>Akrayayo Ayogum = For venality a Ayogu</p>
<p>Kamaya Punscalum = For desire a Harlot</p>
<p>Atikrushtaya Magadham = For excessive noise a Magadha</p>
<p>The writer can do us a favor by quoting the Sanskrit words which he translated as ”May the lord give due reward or punishment to various people”. Some also try to explain it by adding these two words ”Cast aside” before harlot, I request them too to show which Sanskrit words are translated into ”Cast aside”. Those Hindus are leaving an example of how religious scripture undergoes corruption, they are adding their own words. That verse doesn’t have any Sanskrit words which can be translated as ”may lord give reward or punishment” or ”Cast aside”. Now they may argue that it is mentioned in Yajur Veda 30.3 and this verse is in continuity. If it so then why didn’t they mention it before? First of all if the verse is in continuity then why is the 4<sup>th</sup> verse omitted, Why have they jumped from 3<sup>rd</sup> to 5<sup>th</sup> verse when they claim that Vedas were arranged chronologically. Does that mean Rishis made a blunder in arranging these verses here? Moreover the deities of verses 3 and 5 are different so how can it be in continuity? The 3<sup>rd</sup> verse doesn’t state anything like ”May the lord give due reward or punishment”, it says</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 30.3 Savitar, God, send far away all troubles and calamities [from us], And send us only what is good.<br />

<p>It may not be a sin to become prostitute as Ishwar himself has assigned these professions to humans. There is no free will to choose the profession you desire, For Brahman Ishwar binds priesthood and for prostitutes he binds Kama (lust, desire, sexuality), Ishwar even says that he has created Woman for Lust. How can we consider Ishwar to be God after reading such verses. Is women created for mere sexual enjoyment in Vedas? Yaska Acharya also writes in his book,</p>
<p>Nirukta 4.15 “Kanya (maiden) is (so called because) she is an object of love…” Tr. Lakshman Swarup</p>
<p>Look at the phrase used here ”Object of love”, which clearly implies that Women in Hinduism is nothing more than a Sex object.</p>
<p><strong>Sex Slaves</strong></p>

<p><strong>Women in Paradise</strong></p>
<p>Ishwar has arranged thousands of Virgins for Brahmins not just on the earth but in the paradise too,</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 4.34.2 ”The persons firm in their faith, purified, cleansed with their sacerdotal acts and pure in their conscience attain the state of splendid purity. The all-pervading Divinity does not burn or deprive of their organ of enjoyment and generation and in the state of Svarga they have many women, one for each one as his wife.” Tr Vaidyanath Shastri (Arya Samaj)<br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="522" height="121" class="wp-image-7383" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2014-05-atha.gif" alt="https://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/atharva-veda-4-34-2.gif?w=522&amp;h=121" /></p>
<p>There is no word after Strenaam, but Vaidyanath Shastri tries to create monogamy in heaven by adding his own words ”one for each one as his wife”. But Panini in Ashtadhyayi 4.1.87 has interpreted the word Strenaam as ‘Collection of Females’, so in heaven they get plenty of women not just one woman or wife (as claimed by Vaidyanath) which is evident from the Hindi translation by Shri Ram Sharma Acharya also. Another Hindu scholar named M.R. Rajesh translates it as,</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 4.34.2 ”Bereft of physical bodies, pure, cleansed with the wind, brilliant, they go to a brilliant world. The fire does not cause burning in their male organ. In the world of happiness they get plenty of women.” Tr. M.R. Rajesh</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>NIYOG PRATHA</strong></p>
<p>Niyog Pratha is the ugly practice where the wife copulates with other men to beget children, it is also a license for Brahmins to enjoy numerous women as Vedic law permits them to copulate with any women they desire if they are unable to control their passion. Following verse is taken as a proof for Niyoga from the Vedas,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.40.2 Where are ye, Aśvins, in the evening, where at morn? Where is your haltingplace, where rest ye for the night? Who brings you homeward, as the widow bedward draws her husband’s brother, as the bride attracts the groom?</p>
<p>Yaska explains this verse as,</p>
<p>Nirukta 3.15 ”Where do you remain at night, and where during the day? Where do you obtain the necessities of life, and where do you dwell? Who puts you to bed as a widow her husband’s brother? From what (root) is Devara derived ? (He is)so called (because) he is the second husband…” Tr. Lakshman Swarup</p>
<p>The one who is to contract Niyoga with the widow is known as Appointed Husband or Devar. The brother of the deceased is most preferred in the case of Niyoga, after that Sapinda (Close relatives) and Niyoga with high caste Brahmins is also preferable as a widow can’t contract Niyoga with lower caste. It is recommended to contract Niyoga with higher caste men only as they are said to be so called ‘Intellectuals’. Above verse from Vedas as well as Nirukta talks about Niyoga. Arya Samaji scholar named Chiranjiva Bhardvaja explains the word Devar (in Niyoga sense) in the amendment of his translation in the 4th chapter of Satyarth Prakash,</p>
<p>”*Q. ~ Supposing the deceased husband of a widow had no younger brother, with whom should she contract Niyoga?<br />
A. ~ With her devar, but the word devar does not mean what you think. For the Nirukta says “The second husband by Niyoga of a widow, be he the younger brother of her deceased husband or his elder brother, or of a man of her won Class or of a higher Class, is called Devar.” <strong>explanation by Dr. Chiranjiva Bhardwaja, page 134, Ch 4, Satyarth Prakash.</strong></p>
<p>Some Hindus especially Aryas are shying away from this topic and even defying their guru Swami Dayanand Saraswati (Mulshankar) who immensely supported Niyoga. Stalwarts of Arya Samaj viewed Niyoga as legit and that it is sanctioned by the Vedas. Rig Veda hymn 10 of chapter 10 endorses Niyoga (as per Arya Samaj translation), Following is the snapshot of the header from their website<br />

<p>It states,</p>
<p>”This hymn is a dialogue between Yama and Yami i.e. between husband and wife. The husband on being impotent allows his wife to contract Niyoga…” [Source: <a href="http://aryasamajjamnagar.org/rugveda_v5/pages/p464.gif" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">http://aryasamajjamnagar.org/rugveda_v5/pages/p464.gif ]<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>It is mentioned in Rigved,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.40.2 ”O man and woman (connected by Niyoga), just as a widow, cohabits with her husband by Niyoga and produces children for him, and a wife cohabits with her husband by marriage and produces children for him, likewise (it may be asked) where both of you were during the day and during the night, and where you slept, who you are, and what your native place is.” taken from the book Satyarth Prakash, Ch 4, p.134,  Tr. Chiranjiva Bhardwaj (Arya Samaj)</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 14.2.18 “Do thou O woman that givest no pain to thy husband or Devar (husband by Niyoga), art kind to animals in this Order of householders, walk assiduously in the path of righteousness and justice, art well-versed in all the Shastras, hast children and grandchildren, givest birth to valiant the brave boys, desirest a second husband (by Niyoga), and bestoweth happiness on all, accept a man of they choice as thy husband or Devar , and always perform the Homa which is the duty of every householder.” taken from the book Satyarth Prakash, Ch 4, p.135, Tr. Chiranjiva Bhardwaja (Arya Samaj),</p>
<p>What’s more uglier is that Rishis created this practice to legitimize their desire. It enables a Brahmin to have sex with numerous women. Mulshankar (Dayanand) writes in his book,</p>
<p>”Those, however, who cannot control their passions may beget children by having recourse to Niyoga”- Satyarth Prakash, by Swami Dayanand Saraswati, Ch 4, page 130, Tr. Chiranjiva Bhardwaja.</p>

<p><strong>BRIDE SELLING IN VEDA</strong></p>
<p>When the bridegroom was crippled, mentally unstable or lacked qualification then he purchased the bride from father with huge amount,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.109.2 &#8220;O Indra and Agni (Electricity and fire or father and Acharya) I have heard that you are more munificent givers than an un-worthy son-in-law or the brother of the bride&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Acharya Dharma Deva Vidya Martanda (Arya Samaj)</p>
<p>Nirukta 6.9 &#8220;I have heard that you are more liberal indeed than a would be son-in-law, i.e. one whose son-in-lawship is not quite complete. It is well known that the people in the south apply the term vijamata to the husband of a purchased maiden. By this is meant a bridegroom, whose relationship is not complete as it were&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Lakshman Sarup</p>
<p>This type of marriage is permissible in later texts where it is known as Asura/Manusha form of marriage. Refer the article <a href="/index.php/2014/12/27/hinduism-and-lust/" data-wpel-link="internal">Hinduism and Lust</a> for more information.</p>
<p><strong>INCEST IN VEDAS</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 6.55.4 Pushan, who driveth goats for steeds, the strong and Mighty, who is called His Sister’s lover, will we laud.</p>
<p>Yaska Acharya explains this as,</p>
<p>Nirukta 3.16 ”The author calls dawn his sister, from companionship, or drawing the juices. Or else this human lover may have been meant; the enjoyment in that case will refer to the woman, derived from (the root) bhaj (to enjoy)” Tr. Lakshman Swarup</p>
<p>Nowadays some defensive Hindus try to turn every obscene verse into metaphor to find a easy route to escape, but according to Yaska Acharya this refers to a human lover. Agni is also described as his sister’s lover,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.3.3 ”Attendant on the Blessed Dame the Blessed hath come: the Lover followeth his Sister. Agni, far-spreading with conspicuous lustre…”</p>
<p>Leave aside brother sister relationship, Vedas even promote Son-Mother incest,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 6.55.5 ”I glorify Pushan, the husband of his mother:may the gallant of his sister hear us ; may the brother of Indra be our friend.” Tr. Wilson</p>
<p>As we have already seen, it talks about a human lover (Nirukta 3.16). Vedas speak of brother sister’s incest in several hymns including the Rig Veda 10.10 and Atharva Veda 18.1.8 which is a dialogue between Yama and Yami. But I find no reference of Ishwar prohibiting it. Yami in Rigved 10.10.5; Atharved 18.1.5 says that Tvashtar made them husband and wife in the womb of their mothers only, though Yama rebukes her saying it has not been done before. Veda also allows incest between father and daughter, it is mentioned in Rig Veda</p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.61.5-7 “(Rudra), the benefactor of man, whose eager virile energy was developed, drew it back when disseminated (for the generation of offspring)again the irresistible (Rudra) concentrates (the energy) which was communicated to his maiden daughter. When the deed was done in mid-heaven in the proximity of the father working his will, and the daughter coming together, they let the seed fall slightly; it was poured upon the high place of sacrifice. When the father united with the daughter, then associating with the earth, he sprinkled it with the effusion[Semen]: then the thoughtful gods begot Brahma : they fabricated the lord of the hearth (of sacrifice) ; the defender of sacred rites.” Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Following Hindi translation is by Pandit Ram Govind Trivedi<br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="464" height="325" class="wp-image-7385" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2014-05-rig-1-1.jpeg" alt="https://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/rig-veda-10-61-5-7.jpg?w=464&amp;h=325" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2014-05-rig-1-1.jpeg 464w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-vedkabhed-files-wordpress-com-2014-05-rig-1-1-300x210.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 464px) 100vw, 464px" /></p>
<p>Some scholars say Rig Veda 10.61.5-7 verses are about the creation of universe after the union of father with his daughter. This is supported by Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, Upanishad also permits sex with daughter, its mentioned in Brihadaranyaka Upanishad that men were born after God had intercourse with his daughter,</p>
<p>Birhadaranyaka Upanishad 1.4.3 ”He was not at all  happy.  Therefore people (still)  are not happy when alone.  He desired a mate. He became as big as man and wife embracing each other. He parted this very body into two. From that came husband and wife. Therefore, said Yajnavalkya, this  (body) is one-half of oneself, like one of the two halves  of a split pea. Therefore this  space is indeed filled by the wife.  He was united with her.  From that men were born.” Tr. Swami Madhavananda</p>
<p>AdiShankara Acharya writes on this verse,</p>
<p>‘’He, the Viraj called Manu, was united with her, his daughter called Satarupa, whom he conceived of as his wife. From that union men were born.’’ by Shankara on Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 1.4.3, Shankara Bhashya, p.101, Tr. Swami Madhavananda.</p>
<p>Hindus argue that this incest is merely allegorical and thus shouldn’t be taken literally. It maybe allegorical but it does not negate the fact that incest is permitted by the Vedas after all many such verses are used by Hindus to prove their points. Was Ishwar short on words that he used such vulgar words in ‘Holy’ Vedas? Why have a lengthy discussion on this incest issue? Hindus just have to provide a verse from Vedas wherein Ishwar (God) prohibits incest, That’s it. No need to waste time and energy in lengthy discussions, If there is not a single verse in Vedas that prohibits incest then why defend it? on the other hand there are several Vedic verses that promotes incest.</p>
<p>My other question is that if incest was considered a serious offense then how could Ishwar inspire such incestuous verses so easily?</p>
<p>Wasn’t Ishwar aware of the fact that this could be used to justify incest? Inspiration of such incestuous verses only signifies that incest wasn’t considered a taboo.</p>
<p>Hindus are requested to prove incest is prohibited in Vedas, Quote a single verse wherein Ishwar (Aum) prohibits brother-sister, father-daughter, mother-son incest, if you can’t then you shouldn’t be defending it. And why does Ishwar have to inspire verses in such obscene language? Why can’t he reveal in some nice poetry. The composer of these verses must be a pervert that’s why there are these kind of obscene verses.</p>
<p>I’m sure no one can ever prove that. Now let’s have a look at some unholy words used by Ishwar in the so called ”Holy” Vedas.</p>
<h3><strong>Men only with Long Penis can impregnate women</strong>,</h3>
<p>Atharva Veda 20.126.17; Rig Veda 10.86.16-17 ”He whose organ [Penis] even in dream and even before cohabitation discharges genitive fluid may not be capable of having progeny. He whose long-shaped organ enters deep in the womb straight may be capable of having progeny. Almighty God is rarest of all and supreme over all. Tr. Vaidyanath Shastri (Arya Samaj)</p>
<p>Following is the Hindi translation of Rig Veda 10.86.16-17 by Pandit Ram Govind Trivedi (Puranik Hindu),<br />

<p><strong>Rishi Bhauma asking for his share of women,</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 9.67.12 This Soma juice, O glowing God, flows like pure oil, effused for thee: He shall give us our share of maids.</p>
<h3><strong>Stretching the Vagina</strong></h3>
<p>”O pregnant woman; I the physician and surgeon open your organ; Stretch the mouth of the womb; separate the embryo from arteries adjacent to it…”- Atharva Veda hymn 1.11.5, Tr. Vaidyanath Shastri (Arya Samaj)</p>
<p>Even if Ishwar wanted to convey a message, it would have been better for him to use some decent words, not words like only long penis penetrating deep into vagina can impregnate or I am stretching the labia of vagina. Now let’s see some more vulgar words used by Ishwar.</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 20.9 ”May my memory, navel, knowledge, anus, my wife’s productive womb [Yoni/Vagina], my testicles the givers of pleasure through cohabitation<strong>, </strong>my sovereignty and penis flourish…” Tr. Devi Chand (Arya Samaj)</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 19.76 ‘‘The generative organ [Penis] releases urine, but when it enters the womb [Vagina], it releases semen…” Tr. Devi Chand</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 5.25.1 ‘The phallus of man which sows the seminal fluid, lays in the female organ as feather on a shaft, the seed of embryo which is drawn from limb to limb and from cloud and heavenly region.’ Tr. Vaidyanath Shastri (Arya Samaj)</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 8.10 ”…O’ master of a devoted wife, full of prowess and semen, thou art the progenitor of offspring. Impregnate semen in me…” Tr. Devi Chand (Arya Samaj)</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 5.25.8 ”Says wife to her husband at the time of pregnation ceremony [Sexual intercourse]— O husband! please rise up, put forth your manly strength, lay the germ of embryo in the womb…” Tr. Vaidyanath Shastri (Arya Samaj)</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 19.87 ‘‘A husband full of semen like a pitcher, enjoyer, progenitor of children…” Tr. Devi Chand (Arya Samaj)</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 19.84 ”Those learned persons get progeny, who chase afar folly and ill intention, generate near at hand, by milk and medicinal juices, through generative organ, pure, disease-destroying, children-producing semen…” Tr. Chand (Arya Samaj)</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 12.3.29 ”…Let these drops mingle with these rices as woman sees her husband and embraces him for cohabitation” Tr. Vaidyanath Shastri(Arya samaj)</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 12.93 ”O married man, God has created the various herbs, whose king is Soma, that overspread the earth. With their aid, grant semen for this woman, and spread the knowledge of these medicines unto all.” Tr. Devi Chand (Arya Samaj)</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 6.101.1 ”O man! be strong through practice of continee, gain vitality through vital air, strengthen your body and invigorate extensively your limbs, so that the genitive organ of yours develop in proportion to your body and with that you attend your wife in sexual function.” Tr. Vaidyanath Shastri</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 6.101.2-3 “O man of medical science! extend the organ of the importent man like the bow with medicine through which the physicians make the debilitated man strong and stimulant and through which the ailing man excitant. I, the physician extend the potential power of your organ of generation like the bow-string on its arch, O feeble one! and you like the lion pouncing on dear enjoy the sex with your wife without being subject of any agony and discomfiture.” Tr. Acharya Vaidyanath Shastri (Arya Samaj)</p>
<p>Indra the Testicle breaker</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 6.138.2. “Turn him into a eunuch that wears his hair dressed, and into one that wears a hood! Then Indra with a pair of stones shall break his testicles both!” Tr. Maurice Bloomfield</p>

<p>Atharva Veda 14.1.36 &#8220;Let Ashvinau, Prana and Apana adorn this bride with that sheen or splendour by whatever are filled these Akshas, the organs of body, by whatever is endowed the Sura woman having good bodily strength, by whatever is in the thigh of the woman having great sexual appetite.&#8221; Tr. Acharya Vaidyanath Shastra (Arya Samaj)</p>
<p><strong>Mahanagni (Great naked woman)</strong></p>
<p>Mahanagni is mentioned in <a href="https://sacred-texts.com/hin/av/av20136.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Atharva Veda Kanda 20, Adhyaya 136<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, but due to obscenity of the hymn about size of sexual organ and &#8216;Big Naked Woman&#8217; Griffith translated them in Latin.</p>
<p>Brhaddevata i.55 &#8220;&#8230;the harlot (mahanagni: AC. XX.136.5) would be a lascivious verse&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Arthur Anthony Macdonell</p>
<p>Swami Parmeshwarananda wrote,</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;the Vedic religion had developed the concept of the &#8216;Great naked woman&#8217;, the Mahanagni, as early as the period of the Atharvaveda (AV) some hymns from which are known to form part of the Khila hymns of the Rgveda. At one place in the AV, Mahanagni (another reading is Mahanaghni, but only at this place) is alluded to in the mantras in the context of marriage; and the gods Asvins are invoked to protect the bride by their powers by which they got sprinkled the genitals of Mahanagni (AV XIV.4, 36 yena mahanaghnya jaghanam&#8230;abhy&#8217; asicyanta.<br />
In the same context we have some ritual-detail; for, along with the genital of Mahanaghni, wine and the dice are also referred to have been sprinkled (Ibid. yena va sura yena aksa abhy&#8217; asicyanta). This will indicate that the sprinkling of the genitals of the Mahanagani, together with the wine and the dice probably formed some sort of a ritual; and, very probably, it was done for prosperity; it is the ritual-belief of the propitation of this naked goddess that further entered the ritual of marriage, as a charm for the happy married life for the bride. However, the propitation of Mahanagni is not exclusively associated with marriage, it was a much wider practice, and was extended to the ritual of marriage&#8230;Mahanaangi is told that &#8216;he&#8217; is roaring, being unsatisfied; she should be easy, and lift her thighs (RV-Khila V.22.6; AV XX.136.5 with variant reading). Mahanagni strides over the mortar and says, &#8216;As do they pound you, so do they mine&#8217; (RV ib. 7=AV ib. 6). Mahanagni rinses the &#8216;cock&#8217; with the wooden peg (TV ib.8=AV ib.10 mahannagni krakravakum samyaya pari-dhavati); and now, the singer says that he does not know, &#8216;the beast carries the woman by head!&#8217; (AV ib.10 ayam na vidma, yo mrgah sirsna harati dhaninkam; RV 8 has it as, &#8216;This bamboo-stic (tajanam) we do not know; the woman dhanaka) becomes &#8216;endowed with the head&#8217; (? sirsna bhavati dhanaka).

Then we have references to the male partner of Mahanagni, who is called Mahanagna.

<p>Yajur Veda 6.14 ‘‘O disciple, through various sermons, I enjoin upon thee to purify thy voice, thy breath, thy eye, thy ear, thy navel, thy penis, thy anus ; and all thy dealings.” Tr. Devi Chand (Arya Samaj)</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 21.55 ”…just as God, the Dispeller of misery, like pleasure-giving water and semen-virile, invests in this world the soul…” Tr. Devi Chand (Arya Samaj)</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 25.1 ”…Acquire the knowledge of oozing semen from testicles…” Tr. Devi Chand (Arya Samaj)</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 6.72.1-2 “…so He makes the genital organ endowed with vigour of yours endowed with vigour, O man! in proportion to the stature of the one limb with other limb. As the genital organ of male made stout with the power of vital air, becomes capable of impregnation and as proportionate is the organ of well-developed man so great stout proportionately be your organ, O man of house hold life.” Tr. Acharya Vaidyanath Shastri (Arya Samaj)</p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.126.6-7 “She, who, when her desires are assented to, clings as tenaciously as a female weael, and who is ripe for enjoyment, yields me infinite delight. Approach me, (husband); deem me not immature: I am covered with down like a ewe of the Gandharins.” Tr. Wilson<br />

<p>Atharva Veda 14.1.22 ”You attain a long life, not short of hundred years obeying the rules of disciplined cohabitation without spoiling the semen in vain and according to the law of Dharma play your role accompanied by sons, grandsons…” Tr. Vaidyanath Shastri</p>
<p>Here Ishwar is asking husband and wife to have disciplined sex i.e., they should have sex just like Ishwar has prescribed them.  It is considered a sin if semen is spoiled i.e., one should not let semen fall on earth the proper place for depositing semen is Vagina only (as per Hindu texts and scholars), it is mentioned in Upanishad,</p>
<p>Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 6.4.4-5 ”Having known this, Uddalaka the son of Aruna, Naka the son of Mudgala and Kumaraharita said: ”Many mortals, brahmins only in name, perform the sexual act without knowledge of what has been said and depart from this world impotent and without merit.” Even if this much semen of one asleep or of one awake is spilled, He should touch it and repeat the following mantra: ”Whatever semen of mine has split on earth, whatever flowed to plants, whatever to water, I reclaim it.” With these words he should take the semen with his ring finger and thumb and rub it between his breasts or eyebrows, repeating the following mantra: ”Let the semen return to me, let Vigour come to me again, let glow and good fortune come to me again. May the deities who dwell in the sacrificial fire put the semen back in its proper place.” Tr. Swami Nikhilanda</p>
<p>‘If a virgin girl is married to suitable man he can tell her any thing of sexual nature that would not be treated obscene. That will be taken only as the science of sex.- Vaidyanath Shastri (Arya Samaj) on Atharva Veda book 20, hymn 133, Vol 2, p.716, Published by Arya Pratinidhi Sabha, New Delhi-2, 2003 Reprint.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following verse says that Vedic god Varuna had become impotent whose virility was restored by Gandharva via a herb and it also has many obscene words,</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 4.4.1-7 “This is that herbacious plant which is dug out from the earth by a physician for the use of the man whose potency is lost. We also dig out that remedial plant which stimulates the nerves and organ. Let the dawn be stimulant, let the sun be stimulant, let our words be stimulant and let the remedial plant which is the protective force for creatures and which is most effective, be stimulant to impotent nerve with its might energy. O man! let this herb make your nerve so stronger and more stimulant that in spite of impotency your strong body and nerve be active like him who is under the fever of passion…O physician, O nourisher, O enlightened woman, O protector of knowledge! You all by your restorative efforts make the organ of the impotent man strong like the bow. O man! I, the physician by the proper remedial treatment make your genital organ strong like a bow-string tight on its bow-ends. Let you be free from agony for ever and step on in your house-hold life. O physician! You are the expert of body and limbs. Please restore into the impotent man that power which horse, ass, the goat, ram and possess in them.” Tr. Acharya Vaidyanath Shastri (Arya Samaj)</p>
<p>Acharya Vaidyanath Shastri’s translation is not clear, following is the much more clear English translation of Maurice Bloomfield</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 4.4.1-7 “1. Thee, the plant, which the Gandharva dug up for Varuna, when his virility had decayed, thee, that causest strength, we dig up. Ushas (Aurora), Sûrya, (the sun), and this charm of mine; the bull Pragâpati (the lord of creatures) shall with his lusty fire arouse him! This herb shall make thee so very full of lusty strength, that thou shalt, when thou art excited, exhale heat as a thing on fire! The fire of the plants, and the essence of the bulls shall arouse him! Do thou, O Indra, controller of bodies, place the lusty force of men into this person! Thou (O herb) art the first-born sap of the waters and also of the plants. Moreover thou art the brother of Soma, and the lusty force of the antelope buck! Now, O Agni, now, O Savitar, now, O goddess Sarasvatî, now, O Brahmanaspati, do thou stiffen the pasas as a bow! I stiffen thy pasas as a bowstring upon the bow. Embrace thou (women) as the antelope buck the gazelle with ever unfailing (strength)! The strength of the horse, the mule, the goat and the ram, moreover the strength of the bull bestow upon him, O controller of bodies (Indra)!</p>
<p>Pasas means penis, Acharya Vaidyanath has also translated words like penis as genital organ to make it look less obscene.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 25.26 ”This perishable body made of earth, the home of all organs is created for the enjoyment of the soul. God, for the excellent enjoyment of this active soul, grants this enjoyable object.” Tr. Devi Chand (Arya Samaj)</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 25.7 ”…Strengthen scrotum with the testicles. Examine the strength of a horse from his penis. Produce progeny with semen. Digest meals with the force,Strengthen your belly by free discharge of digested food through anus.” Tr. Devi Chand (Arya Samaj)</p>
<p>Can Hindus or Aryas read these verses in front of their parents, elders or other people? Can god really use such vulgar language in the Holy Book? This might be the reason why Aryas are ill mannered, always uses foul language, and perhaps this is why they look only for porn in other scriptures. What is the wisdom behind revealing such obscene words like ”penis releases urine but when it enters the womb [Yoni] it releases semen” weren’t Aryans aware of cohabitation that Ishwar had to inspire it? The sentence of Yajur Veda 25.7 is useless now as Horses are not required. If horse’s strength was examined by his penis then how did the Aryas examine the strength of Humans? the next line says ‘Produce progeny with semen” as if people produce progeny from cooking oil. Why give such vulgar unnecessary knowledge? Such book which is no different than a porn literature can never be the word of God. Hindus should study these verses carefully instead of blindly following their scholars.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="color:#333333;">Written by Abd al-Muhsin Al Hindy</p>
<p style="color:#333333;">In this part we will see some more heinous acts legislated by the barbaric Vedas. We’ve seen how Hindūs are ever zealous in maligning Islām, alleging it to be ‘violent’ , intolerant but have the people seen the true ‘teachings’ of this self-claimed ‘ahinsac’(non-violent) religion? Let’s read the ‘unholy’ verses of their so-called Holy book ‘vedas’.</p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span id="more-852"></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:#000080;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><strong style="font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">Intolerance and killing in vedas</span></span></strong><strong style="font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"> &#8211;</span></strong></span></span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:red;">“<strong style="font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">Food to him</span></strong> </span>who knows the science of air, and to him <strong style="font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:red;">who is the chief killer</span></span></strong><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:red;">. </span>Homage to the expert in the construction of houses, and to their protector. Food to the wealthy, and to him who makes the wicked weep. Homage to him who abhors sin and to him who practices Virtue”</span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">&#8211; [Yajurveda Ch 16, verse 39, pg.173, Tr. Devi Chand]</span></span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">“We learned persons accept as our ruler, thee, the introducer of new plans for our advancement, the master of loyal subjects, the embodiment of virtue, the most advanced in noble qualities and acts,<span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:red;"> <strong style="font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">the queller of the irreligious</span></strong>, </span>the pure, the specimen of endurance, the master of prowess, and the helper and educator of all.”</span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">– [Yajurveda Ch 7, verse 36, pg.77, Tr. Devi Chand]</span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">The verse quoted above speak for themselves, the second verse commands killing of irreligious and here this is one of the reasons why<strong style="font-style:inherit;"><em style="font-weight:inherit;">‘learned person’</em></strong> are accepting, a ruler, due to his intolerance towards who are irreligious! While the first verse praises ‘Chief-killer’ by stating food to him who’s the chief killer! We need no more statements from the vedas; these amply put our point in place. And these are the verses from the book of a religion which often labels itself as ‘ahimsac’ (non-violent). Such cults and religions often label themselves as non-violent in order to hide the true face of their creed.</span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:#000080;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><strong style="font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">Killing irreligious foes in Vedas-</span></strong></span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:red;">“O king, <strong style="font-style:inherit;">make progress</strong> in <strong style="font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">thy duty of administration</span></strong>, extend happiness to the virtuous. <strong style="font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">O terrible chastiser, burn down the irreligious foes.</span></strong> O splendid person, humiliate and consume utterly like dried up stubble, him, who encourages our foe.”</span></span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">– [Yajurveda, Ch 13, verse 12, pg.138, Tr. Devi Chand]</span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">Above verse <strong style="font-style:inherit;">commands</strong> protestant <strong style="font-style:inherit;">Hindū King</strong> to burn down irreligious foes like stubble, this is what protestant Hindūs call ‘tolerance’. And this is reagarded as progress in the administrative duty of a <strong style="font-style:inherit;">Hindū King! </strong>We’ve always found Hindūs criticizing Muslims and belittling them as barbarians, because few so-called Muslims rulers allegedly have been intolerant and have killed thousands of Hindūs, while conquering India. This is the <strong style="font-style:inherit;"><em style="font-weight:inherit;">‘Classical hypocrisy’</em></strong> of Hindūs; they’ve always criticized people for being barbaric, intolerant and violent against Hindūs, but what about these unholy verses from their so-called holy books? Islām never allowed such barbaric acts , but if some Muslim indulge into such acts then he’s to be blamed not Islām, but Islāmophobes like Agniveer have always blamed Islām – this shows their bias, irrationality and unreasonable state of mind. But now we question, what about Hindūism which quite evidently is commanding Hindūs to kill innocents because they are irreligious?</span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">Burning of irreligious people! , still we find protestant Hindūs adamantly criticizing Islām and other faiths with so-called intolerance, extremism, fundamentalism and violence, when their religion itself is the paragon of such barbaric thing</span></span>s.</span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:#000080;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><strong style="font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">Mass-carnage, killing of innocents – children, females, sick, old, commanded and encouraged in vedas:</span></strong></span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">Now let’s see what the barbaric Vedas have to say about this, we’ll</span></span></span><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"> show our readers what the so-called “Ahinsac” (non-violent) Vedas command.</span></span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:red;">“<strong style="font-style:inherit;">O friendly countrymen, encourage the commander of the army</strong></span>, and begin the battle with him, who with his physical, mental and militarystrength,<span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:red;"> <strong style="font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">cleaves the enemies’ families</span>, <span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">usurps their land</span></strong>, </span>is armed with weapons, <span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:red;">slay’s the foes</span></span>, subdues the enemy in the battle, and conquers him.” – [Yajurveda, Chapter 17, verse 38, pg-182, Tr. Devi Chand]</span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:red;">“<strong style="font-style:inherit;">May the commander of the army</strong></span>, who, with<span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:red;"> <strong style="font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">surpassing vigour pierces in the battles the families of the enemies</span></strong>, <strong style="font-style:inherit;">is pitiless</strong>,<strong style="font-style:inherit;"> wild with anger</strong>, </span>unconquerable by foes, conqueror of the enemy’s forces, unequalled in fight, and victor, protect our armies.”</span></span></p>

<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">Interestingly, Vedas teach protestant Hindūs to usurp the lands of those who’ve been invaded, annihilate, and tear apart the families of the enemy! Another Vedic verse commands the King <em style="font-weight:inherit;">(in Hindi translation and ‘Indra’ in English translation and Original Sanskrit )</em> to expel the enemies out of their homes and kill/demolish those who fight Hindūs</span></span></span></p>

<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">Look at these inhuman verses from the vedas! Now what does the hatemongers (agniveer et .el)say? We know they do not have any answers nor will they will dare to answer us. This is what is called ‘hypocrisy’ and Mūlshankar and his blind-followers are full with it. We wonder why these people cry about the alleged killing of innocents by Arab invaders, when their own ‘holy’ book orders to Hindu commander-in-chief to mercilessly kill the whole families including children, old, sick, women …etc Why these islamphobes complaining when their own ‘holy’ book, call for mass carnage of innocents! Why? Because they are Hypocrites, what more proof will an unbiased person need?<br />

<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">Now let’s go to looting, . Let’s see what the Hindū scriptures state about it. Looting is the way to prosperity this is the principle expounded by the Vedas, and other protestant Hindū texts.</span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">“<strong style="font-style:inherit;">Chariots and horses, elephants, parasols, money, grain, cattle, <span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:red;">women</span>, all sorts of (marketable) goods and valueless metals</strong><strong style="font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">belong to him who takes them (singly) conquering (the possessor).</span></strong>”</span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">– [Manu Smriti, Chapter 7, verse 96, pg 231]</span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">Now, when Manu Shāstra itself says that all the marketable goods and other materials belong to the conqueror, then why is it the followers of Manu Shāstra (protestant Hindūs) are found crying when Arab invaders took few things similar to it? Why? Answer is Hypocrisy! It’s not this simple, in fact according to Vedas battles are considered as source of prosperity as battles include looting. Read with your own eyes.</span></span></p>

<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">Just compare these barbaric teachings of Vedas to the divine merciful teachings of Islām; we’ve stated the Islāmic stance of the issues relayed above.

Well, if no then let us explore these things right from the vedas.So does vedas ask Hindūs to dominate the world, by occupying it and conquering it with force? Does vedas ask Hindūs to spread Vedic dharma with sword? Nope we won’t answer! Let the vedas speak for themselves,</span></span></p>

<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">The verse, speaks for itself! We need not expound on it in detail, simply put the above verse asks Hindūs to subdue all the regions of the world, and win it with force and destructive military weapons. This verse asks Hindūs to dominate the world, and subdue it, still we find these Hindūs claiming to be Ahinsac?</span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">And, so does another verse in the vedas ask Hindūs to conquer and dominate the world with force,</span></span></p>

<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">Nope, Vedas have more to say, they ask the Hindū King to take everything under his control right from animals to every human on earth, everything.</span></span></p>

<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">So why do we find, Hindūs criticizing Muslims, for conquering and invade India? When their own vedas asks them to invade every nation, every part on earth, subdue it, conquer it and take everything under control! Coming to the duties of king as legislated by, and what do vedas legislate and sanctify the King for?</span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">“O king, just as the wise and aged persons, in this world, created by the Effulgent God, accept thee, with the force and strength of vital breaths, and attraction and retention of breath, the source of strength; <strong style="font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">so do I.

<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">What did our readers read? Yes, Vedas santify the Hindū king to ruler over the world, in short asking him to conquer the entire world, cut the throats of sinners, remove the foes of Hindūs! And these people call themselves Ahinsac! Is there any bigger lie than this? And here again we prove how vedas command Hindūs to subdue other civilizations and religions and rule the world with brute-force.And what more duties do the vedas, have legislated for the Hindū kings? Again let the Vedas speak for it,</span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">“<strong style="font-style:inherit;">O king, thou art our leader</strong>; thou putteth upon the path of rectitude, even the leaders of a high order.

<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">So we learn, that the <strong style="font-style:inherit;">foremost </strong>duty of a Hindū king is to maintain and strengthen Hindū <em style="font-weight:inherit;">(Vedic)</em> supremacy and rule over the earth, another very important duty is to propogate so-called religious truths <em style="font-weight:inherit;">(i.e. Vedic Dharma)</em> And still we find Hindūs <em style="font-weight:inherit;">(protestant and Orthodox)</em> criticizing Islām, for proselytisation and conquering the world with force <em style="font-weight:inherit;">(an allegation!)</em>, whereas the same things are taught, legalised and prescribed by vedas, so why criticize Islām?Let’s move further and see some how do the vedas ask its followers to preach the vedic dharma, we’ve seen how the vedas asks Hindū kings to uphold the Vedic Supremacy and spread the so-called vedic-truths.So do vedas allow using “sword” for the spread of vedic Dharma? Or is sword used by Hindūs to spread their religion? Or what do a Hindū King have to do to spread his Vedic truth and how? And how is a Hindū King need to spread Vedic dharma? Well, parts of these questions are pretty clear, from the earlier quoted Vedic verses, but let’s focus a bit more on preachng of Vedic dharma and the methods shown by vedas.</span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:#000080;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><strong style="font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">Vedic dharma and the sword – An unbreakable relationship:</span></strong></span></span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">So why do vedas sanctify Hindū Kings or command Hindū Kings to subdue all regions, conquer all parts of the earth and control every being?Why is this the foremost duty of a Hindū King? Well, so that the same sword used to subdue all the civilizations of earth could be used to spread the Vedic dharma! And this is quite explicit from the following verse.</span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><strong style="font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">“O learned person</span></strong>, just as the sun kindled in forefront of Mornings, with forward light, long-active, waxing mighty, with thirty three supernatural powers of nature, the Thunder-wielder, smites dead the cloud, and throws light on the portals, so do thou <strong style="font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:red;">with the help</span></span></strong><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:red;"><strong style="font-style:inherit;">of warriors kill the foes,</strong></span><strong style="font-style:inherit;"> and <span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:red;">open the doors of knowledge and religion</span></strong></span>.”</span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">– [Yajurveda Ch 20, verse 36, pg.221, Tr. Devi Chand]</span></span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">This is crystal clear! Above Vedic verse <span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">commands killing foes and opening the doors of knowledge and religions</span>, meaning that the Vedic dharma is to be spread with sword after conquering the lands, curtailing the army of enemies! And we find protestant Hindūs claiming Islām was spread with sword when their own religion commands to spread their Vedic dharma with sword so what should such a behaviour be labeled as? Hypocrisy! Look how Hindū Kings and soldiers are asked to spread their religion with sword! What more proof will an unbias person need to acknowledge the hypocrisy of Mūlshankar and his cult?</span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">Once a Hindū King is in power or is ruling any tribe/nation/island his <strong style="font-style:inherit;">foremost</strong> duty according to vedas is to “<strong style="font-style:inherit;">strengthen thy rule over the Earth</strong><em style="font-weight:inherit;">”, (foremost because this same sword and rule then can be used to force vedic dharma on the conquered people)</em><strong style="font-style:inherit;"> </strong>then<strong style="font-style:inherit;"> </strong>he is to look after the administration…etc of the earth and then he is <strong style="font-style:inherit;">“propagate the religious truth”.</strong>So we see that the reason behind subduing the entire earth and controlling it is the “<strong style="font-style:inherit;">foremost” </strong>duty of king so that vedic dharma can easily be forced upon the people!</span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">Now let’s see how vedas are to be preached? Well, again let vedas talk,</span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">“<strong style="font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">For them</span></strong>, who are the protectors of paths and pedestrians, the producers of corn on the earth, <strong style="font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:red;">who fight with full force, against their enemies</span>, <span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:red;">we transport our weapons to places a thousand leagues afar.</span></strong><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:red;"> <strong style="font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">For them, who with arrows in their hand, and armed with sword</span></strong></span><strong style="font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">, <span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:red;">preach the study of the vedas</span></span></strong> <strong style="font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">and the <span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:red;">use of ships</span>, we <span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:red;">send out weapons</span> to <span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:red;">places a thousand leagues afar</span></span></strong>.”</span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">– [Yajurveda, Ch. 16, verses 61-62, pg175-176, Tr. Devi Chand]</span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">This is the way how vedas are preached! Hindūs fight the enemy with full force and transport weapons to thousands of leagues far so as to spread their Vedic dharma.And Hindūs are also commanded, to preach the study of vedas armed with sword and arrows, and using the ships to send out weapons to the Hindū armies killing, looting, usurping lands and forcing Vedic dharma on other civilizations, preaching with swords and hands in arrow inorder to awe-inspire the people so that they may leave their religions and embrace the vedic dharma..The above verse clearly instructs the Hindūs to launch a dharma Yudh against other civilizations and nations; so as to annihilate their enemies and spread the vedas with sword, nothing can be clearer than this.Sword and deadly weapons used for preaching!</span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">No wonder the vedas, praise those who carry swords, quiver sharp weapons and bows!</span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">“Food to the bold, the prudent and the mild. <strong style="font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:red;">Homage to him who carries sword and quiver</span></span>. <span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:red;">Homage to him who hath sharp weapons</span>, and is equipped with brave warriors. <span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:red;">Food to him who possesses good weapons and good bows</span>.</strong>” – [Yajurveda, Ch. 16, Verse 36, pg. 172. Tr. Devi Chand]</span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">People carrying harmful and deadly weapons are praised by vedas! And now we know why! We think it is crystal clear that vedas instruct Hindū kings, and Hindūs to dominate the world, subdue other civilizations and religions on it and control everything on it, so as to open the door for Vedic dharma and spread it and preach it with sword.</span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">We’ve seen protestant Hindūs spewing venom against Islam alleging that it was spread through swords whereas their own “Holy” books instruct them to do so. So what is such behaviour called? Well this has been apparent throught out the article and we’ve asked this question again and again so that our readers may see the extent of, these Islāmopobes in unethicalness. Well, such behaviour is called “double standards” or “hypocrisy”.</span></span></p>
<p style="color:#333333;">Jesus Christ (peace be upon him) Aptly said</p>
<blockquote style="font-weight:bold;color:#000000;">
<p style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;">“Judge not, that you be not judged. For with the judgment you pronounce you will be judged, and with the measure you use it will be measured to you. Why do you see the speck that is in your brother’s eye, but do not notice the log that is in your own eye? “</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Written by Ibn Muhammad</p>
<p>Islam is being severely attacked, bashed, mocked by a certain dedicated team in cyberspace. A large number of these ‘Islam Haters’ happen to be Hindu fanatics. Obviously, their sole agenda is to create aversion in the minds of common people against Islam. Their full time job is to prove that the Islam promotes violence and terrorism. Some of these people are zealous evangelists of Vedas and claim that Vedas are the only books promoting peace. They claim that once everyone accepts the Vedas, peace and prosperity would been seen everywhere. How true is this claim? For those of you who have been conditioned to believe that Vedas promote peace, this article might change your perception of the Vedic Dharma.</p>
<p>According to Hindus, in Satyug, people were pious and upright, who did not know fighting. The use of lethal weapons was unknown. It was like Heaven on Earth. Hindus also tell us that Vedas are from the beginning of the world. Combining these two beliefs, it follows that Vedas must have nothing corcerning warfare, killing, plunder, etc. However, if Vedas do speak about warfare and killing, there are two only two choices for Hindus; accept that Vedas are not from the beginning of the world, but were written much later or accept that Vedas introduced killing and warfare in the world.</p>
<p><span id="more-850"></span></p>
<p><strong>The Warrior Gods of Vedas</strong></p>
<p>The Vedic gods are always depicted as being busy in war and destroying the enemies. Let us see god Indra</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="651" height="290" class="wp-image-7337" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-i1-wp-com-www-islamhinduism-com-images-sto.gif" alt="https://i1.wp.com/www.islamhinduism.com/images/stories/rig_10_48_6to7.gif" /></p>
<p><strong>“These, breathing loud in fury, two and two, who caused Indra to bring his bolt of thunder to the fray, The challengers, I struck with deadly weapon down: firm stand what words the God speaks to his worshippers. This One by stronger might I conquered singly; yea, also two: shall three prevail against me? Like many sheaves upon the floor I thrash them. How can my foes, the Indraless, revile me?” [Rigveda 10:48:6-7]</strong></p>
<p>Indra Ji cannot tolerate anyone opposing him and whoever is guilty of opposing him will be crushed like sawdust.</p>
<p>Indra Ji was invoked by the Aryans to loot the cows of non Aryan tribes and Indra Ji did not disappoint the Aryans. In Vedic times, there lived an untouchable people in a village named Kikat, in todays Bihar. The used to rear cattle. Obviously to the Aryans this was a crime. So they invoked their god Indra to wage war against them and loot their cows.</p>
<p><strong>“O Indra, what do the cows make for you among the Kikatas. They neither yield milk for your offerings, nor do they warm the vessel of libation. Bring to us these cows, bring to us also the wealth of Pramagand (their King). O Brave one, grant us the possessions of the people of low status.” [Rigveda 3:53:14]</strong></p>
<p>On the basis of this clear pronouncement, non-Aryans and untouchables have no right to keep cows. Aryans and Brahmins whenever they wish can kill them and appropriate their possessions. Hindu culture thus becomes the culture of the progress, civilization and welfare of the Aryan people alone.</p>
<p>Indra Ji is very ruthless against his opponents. He can go to any extent to ruin them, even kidnapping women. Rigveda 5:30:7-9 mentions the following</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="671" height="405" class="wp-image-7338" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-i0-wp-com-www-islamhinduism-com-images-sto.gif" alt="https://i0.wp.com/www.islamhinduism.com/images/stories/rig_5_30_8.gif" /></p>
<p><strong>7 Thou, Maghavan, from the first didst scatter foemen, speeding, while joying in the milk, the Giver. There, seeking man’s prosperity, thou torest away the head of Namuci the Dasa.</strong></p>
<p><strong>8 Pounding the head of Namuci the Dasa, me, too thou madest thine associate, Indra! Yea, and the rolling stone that is in heaven both worlds, as on a car, brought to the Maruts.</strong></p>
<p><strong>9 Women for weapons hath the Dasa taken, What injury can his feeble armies To me? Well he distinguished his two different voices, and Indra then advanced to fight the Dasyu.</strong></p>
<p>Indra Ji is given many epithets like <em>Vajradhaari, vṛtrahan, Dasyuhan, </em>etc. How can peace prevail in the world when these kinds of prejudiced teachings are there in the Vedas?</p>
<p>Vedic wars were mainly fought to gain cattle and other booty, as is clearly mentioned in Rigveda 6:26:1-2</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="643" height="280" class="wp-image-7339" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-i0-wp-com-www-islamhinduism-com-images-sto-1.gif" alt="https://i0.wp.com/www.islamhinduism.com/images/stories/rig_6_26_1.gif" /></p>
<p><strong>1. O INDRA, hear us. Raining down the Soma, we call on thee to win us mighty valour. Give us strong succour on the day of trial, when the tribes gather on the field of battle.</strong></p>
<p><strong>2 The warrior, son of warrior sire, invokes thee, to gain great strength that may be won as booty: To thee, the brave man’s Lord, the fiends’ subduer, he looks when fighting hand to hand for cattle.</strong></p>
<p>Like Indra, other deities are also of a warrior mentality. Again and again prayers are made to them to obtain the wealth of the enemies and conquer their territories.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Inhumane Principles of Vedic Warfare with special reference to Arya Samaj</strong></p>
<p>Now see the extreme sadist mentality of Vedic followers, who fought wars to gain cows and wealth. Their are specific prayers in the Vedas about conquering the foes and gaining their wealth. The conquered people were later humiliated in the most abusive ways. For example, Rigveda 10:166 says,</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="649" height="629" class="wp-image-7340" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-i1-wp-com-www-islamhinduism-com-images-sto-1.gif" alt="https://i1.wp.com/www.islamhinduism.com/images/stories/rig_10_166.gif" /></p>
<p><strong>“1. MAKE me a bull among my peers, make me my rivals, conqueror: Make me the slayer of my foes, a sovran ruler, lord of kine</strong></p>
<p><strong>2 I am my rivals’ slayer, like Indra unwounded and unhurt, And all these enemies of mine are vanquished and beneath my feet.</strong></p>
<p><strong>3 Here, verily, I bind you fast, as the two bow-ends with the string. Press down these men, O Lord of Speech, that they may humbly speak to me.</strong></p>
<p><strong>4 Hither I came as conqueror with mighty all-effecting power, And I have mastered all your thought, your synod, and your holy work.</strong></p>
<p><strong>5 May I be highest, having gained your strength in war, your skill in peace my feet have trodden on your heads. Speak to me from beneath my feet, as frogs from out the water croak, as frogs from out the water croak.”</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>BURN THE ENEMIES ALIVE<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Yajurveda Chapter 13; Mantra 12 says</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="523" height="273" class="wp-image-7341" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-i2-wp-com-www-islamhinduism-com-images-sto.gif" alt="https://i2.wp.com/www.islamhinduism.com/images/stories/yajur_13_12.gif" /></p>
<p><strong>“O King, make progress in thy duty of administration, extend happiness to the religious. O terrible chastiser, burn down the irreligious foes. O splendid person, humiliate and consume utterly like dried up stubble, him, who encourages our foe.”</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>BURN THE KITCHENS/KITCHEN GARDENS OF THE ENEMIES<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Yajurveda Chapter 13; Mantra 13 says</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="516" height="325" class="wp-image-7342" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-i1-wp-com-www-islamhinduism-com-images-sto-2.gif" alt="https://i1.wp.com/www.islamhinduism.com/images/stories/yajur_13_13.gif" /></p>
<p><strong>“O King, rise high, punish the wicked foes righteously, manifest the objects prepared by our steady scholars, enhance pleasures. Destroy the kitchens and other places of plundering of the vigorous enemies. Kill the foes. I settle you with fire’s ardour.”</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>PUT YOUR ENEMIES IN THE JAWS OF FEROCIOUS ANIMALS<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Yajurveda Chapter 15; Mantra 15 says</p>
<p><strong>“…Let injurious animals like Lions and others that eat fresh and grass be destroyed.  Let murderous crowds of men that destroy others like a powerful weapon, be killed.  Let virtuous rulers protect us from those animals, and make us comfortable.  In the jaws of these animals we place the ferocious man whom we hate and who hates us.“</strong></p>
<p>I am sure that our society will not allow Vedic followers to kill the Lions. A person who has common sense, will never accept this unscientific teaching.  Lions by nature, eat flesh.  This verse wants to make them herbivorous. If this teaching is implemented, Lions will become extinct.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>WHO ARE THE ENEMIES?<br />
</strong></p>
<p>But there is still one thing unclear. Who are the enemies whose inhumane killing is being encouraged in the above mantras? Well, let the Vedas answer for themselves.</p>
<p>Atharvaved 12:5:62 says,</p>
<p><strong>“Rend, rend to bits, rend through and through, scorch and consume and burn to dust, the one who rejects the Vedas.”</strong></p>
<p>I do not think the above verse leaves any ambiguity as to who the enemies mentioned in the Vedas are. The mantra speaks for itself. It also prescribes the most gruesome forms of slaughter of those who disbelieve in the Vedas.</p>
<p>The same Sookt (hymn) also commands the following in mantras 65-71,</p>
<p><strong>65) So, O Goddess, do thou from him, the Brāhmans’ tyrant,  criminal, niggard, blasphemer of the Gods,  66) With hundred-knotted thunderbolt, sharpened and edged with razor-blades, 67)Strike off the shoulders and the head. 68) Snatch thou the hair from off his head, and from his body strip the skin: 69) Tear out his sinews, cause his flesh to fall in pieces from his frame. 70) Crush thou his bones together, strike and beat the marrow out of him. 71) Dislocate all his limbs and joints.</strong></p>
<p>I wonder what type of mindset would have written this horrendous stuff? This extreme sadist mentality which relishes in instructing such horrible torture deserves to be banned forever before it is put to practice.  One can imagine what would have happened at the time when such teachings would have been enforced thousands of years back. These teachings were recently put into effect when innocent Muslims were burnt alive and tortured in the Indian State of Gujrat, Christians were burnt alive in many places of India especially in Orrisa. Jains and Buddhists in ancient times and Muslims, Christians and Sikhs in recent times have been made the experimental mice of these teachings.</p>
<p>Also supportig the idea that the enemies mentioned in the Vedas in fact refer to people of other religions, we have the following prayer made in Atharvaved 20:93:1.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="537" height="255" class="wp-image-7343" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-i1-wp-com-www-islamhinduism-com-images-sto-3.gif" alt="https://i1.wp.com/www.islamhinduism.com/images/stories/atharva_20_93_1.gif" /></p>
<p><strong>May our hymns give you great delight. Display your bounty, Thunderer. Drive off the enemies of the Vedas.”</strong></p>
<p>The next mantra mentions</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="477" height="216" class="wp-image-7344" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-i2-wp-com-www-islamhinduism-com-images-sto-1.gif" alt="https://i2.wp.com/www.islamhinduism.com/images/stories/atharva_20_93_2.gif" /></p>
<p><strong>“Crush with your foot the niggard churls who bring no gifts. Mighty are you: There is not one to equal you.”</strong></p>
<p>The above mantras also make the identity of the enemy clear. The enemies are those who do not pray to the Vedic gods and bring them no gifts. The same is mentioned in Rigveda 8:53:1-2.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>PLUNDER THE ENEMIES WEALTH<br />
</strong></p>
<p>As has been said before that Vedic wars were motivated to a great extent by capturing more wealth, I will now provide even more evidence for this.</p>
<p><strong>“Handless be these our enemies! We enervate their languid limbs. So let us part among ourselves, in hundreds, Indra! all their wealth.” [Atharvaved 6:66:3]</strong></p>
<p>Rigveda 1:7:4 mentions,</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="473" height="298" class="wp-image-7345" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-i2-wp-com-www-islamhinduism-com-images-sto-2.gif" alt="https://i2.wp.com/www.islamhinduism.com/images/stories/rig_1_7_4.gif" /></p>
<p><strong>“Help us, O Indra, in the frays, yea, frays, where thousand spoils are gained, With awful aids, O awful One.”</strong></p>
<p>In Rigveda 10:84:2 it is said,</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="475" height="315" class="wp-image-7346" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-i2-wp-com-www-islamhinduism-com-images-sto-3.gif" alt="https://i2.wp.com/www.islamhinduism.com/images/stories/rig_10_84_2.gif" /></p>
<p><strong>Flashing like fire, be thou, O conquering Manyu, invoked, O Victor, as our army’s leader. Slay thou our foes, distribute their possessions: show forth thy vigour, scatter those who hate us.</strong></p>
<p>At many places such prayers are made to destroy the enemies and gain their wealth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>BOOTY OF WAR<br />
</strong></p>
<p>What constitutes the booty of war in the Vedic religion? Maharishi Manu describes the war booty on the basis of the Vedas.</p>
<p><strong>“Chariots and horses, elephants, parasols, money, grain, cattle, women, all sorts of (marketable) goods and valueless metals belong to him who takes them (singly) conquering (the possessor).”</strong></p>
<p><strong>“A text of the Veda (declares) that (the soldiers) shall present a choice portion (of this booty) to the king; what has not been taken singly, must be distributed by the king among all the soldiers.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Manu Smriti 7:96-97]</strong></p>
<p>Women also are considered part of the war booty in the above passages and are to be divided like other objects.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>No Universal Brotherhood in the Vedas<br />
</strong></p>
<p>The texts of the Vedas and other Hindu scriptures clearly show that they do not regard non-Aryans races as brothers, nor did they wish any good to the non-worshippers of the Aryan gods. They only wished their extirpation and their annihilation. Out of a large number of passages bearing on this subject, I quote the following:</p>
<p><strong>“He who dwells fixed in the atmosphere, smiting the blasphemers of the god that do not sacrifice, to him be reverence with ten sakvarî-stanzas!” [Atharvaved 11:2:23]</strong></p>
<p>The texts of the Vedas seem to leave no doubt that they recognize a distinction between the tribe to which the authors of the hymns belonged and a hostile people who observed different rites, and were regarded with contempt and hatred by the superior race. Their is no doubt that in many passages of the Rigveda the words <em>Dasa </em>and <em>Dasyu</em> are applied to the aboriginal tribes of India. Let us see what Maharishi Manu says,</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="372" height="59" class="wp-image-7347" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-i2-wp-com-www-islamhinduism-com-images-sto-4.gif" alt="https://i2.wp.com/www.islamhinduism.com/images/stories/manu_10_45.gif" /></p>
<p><strong>“All those tribes in this world, which are excluded from (the community of) those born from the mouth, the arms, the thighs, and the feet (of Brahman), are called Dasyus, whether they speak the language of the Mlecchas or that of the Aryans. [Manu 10:45]</strong></p>
<p>The distinction between Aryas and Dasyus is not on the basis of character but on the basis nationality as is clearly demarcated by Manu Smriti 2:21-23.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="363" height="175" class="wp-image-7348" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-i1-wp-com-www-islamhinduism-com-images-sto-4.gif" alt="https://i1.wp.com/www.islamhinduism.com/images/stories/manu_2_21-23.gif" /></p>
<p><strong>“21. That (country) which (lies) between the Himavat and the Vindhya (mountains) to the east of Prayaga and to the west of Vinasana (the place where the river Sarasvati disappears) is called Madhyadesa (the central region).</strong></p>
<p><strong>22. But (the tract) between those two mountains (just mentioned), which (extends) as far as the eastern and the western oceans, the wise call Aryavarta (the country of the Aryans).</strong></p>
<p><strong>23. That land where the black antelope naturally roams, one must know to be fit for the performance of sacrifices; (the tract) different from that (is) the country of the Mlecchas (barbarians).”</strong></p>
<p>Only Aryavarta aka India is the place where noble people are found and the rest of the world is filled with evil people. Thus as per the Vedic worldview, Aryas as called Aryas (Noble) because they belong to the Aryavarta and Mlecchas and Dasyus are called so not because they are evil but because they are foreigners.</p>
<p>So, Vedas give the following solution to deal with the Dasyus who do not share the faith of the Aryas.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="619" height="113" class="wp-image-7349" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-i2-wp-com-www-islamhinduism-com-images-sto-5.gif" alt="https://i2.wp.com/www.islamhinduism.com/images/stories/rig_1_176_4.gif" /></p>
<p><strong>“Slay everyone who pours no gift, who, hard to reach, delights thee not. Bestow on us what wealth he hath: this even the worshipper awaits.” [Rigveda 1:176:4]</strong></p>
<p>What language could be stronger against one’s enemies than this?  This is sheer bigotry. The quotations already made sufficiently illustrate the hatred of the Aryans for the other religions. For more of this bigotry you can see Rigveda 8:2:18, 8:45:23, 8:51:12, 8:53:1,2.</p>
<p>As far as we have seen, there is no trace to be found in the hymns of the Vedas about the brotherhood of man.  On the other hand, there is abundant evidence of an intense hostility cherished towards the non Aryan tribes.</p>
<p>There was also not the very best of feelings even among the Rishis towards one another. There are unmistakable references in the hymns to a deadly feud between Rishi Vashishtha and Rishi Vishvamitra and of a curse laid on the former by the latter. The details of these feuds will be dealt with in another article.</p>
<p>This article is an attempt to refute the Vedic propagandists who are so eager to malign Islam and yet choose to turn a blind eye to their own scriptures. I can only remind them of this wise saying of Jesus Christ (peace be upon him),</p>
<p><strong>“Judge not, that you be not judged. For with the judgment you pronounce you will be judged, and with the measure you use it will be measured to you.  Why do you see the speck that is in your brother’s eye, but do not notice the log that is in your own eye? ” [Mark 7:1]</strong></p>

<p>Written by Sulaiman Razvi</p>
<p>Gambling is a vice which leads to loss of one’s wealth, brings destruction to family and it also leads to various other evils. Gambling makes one believe in luck rather than hard work, people resort to gambling as a short cut way to gain wealth. But this evil has sanctions in the Hindu religion. Whenever we imagine Hinduism and Gambling the first thing that comes to our mind is the Mahabharata episode with Shakuni holding dice in his hand. Gambling in India is much older than the Mahabharata period, one can find mention of gambling in Vedas also. Agni Purana chapter 91 has a superstitious ritual of making gambling board and throwing dice to know the future. It was not just money, property, cow or horses which were put at stake during the play but even humans especially wives were also staked in gambling. The examples are Draupadi by Pandava and Urvashi by Indra. Gambling is not something unknown to Hindus, Hindus spend whole night playing various types of gambling during the eve of Diwali. Dr. B.R. Ambedkar wrote in his book Riddles in Hinduism, “The Aryans were a race of gamblers. Gambling was developed to science in very early days of the Aryan Civilization so much so that they had even devised certain technical terms. The Hindus used the words Krita, Treta, Dwapara and Kali as the names of the four Yugas or periods into which historical times are divided. As a matter of fact originally these are the names of the dices used by the Aryans at gambling. The luckiest dice was called Krita and the unluckiest was called Kali. Treta and Dwapara were intermediate between them. Not only was gambling well developed among the ancient Aryans but the stakes were very high. Gambling with high money stakes have been known elsewhere. But they are nothing as compared with those which are known to have been offered by the Aryans. Kingdoms and even their wives were offered by them as stakes at gambling. King Nala staked his kingdom and lost it. The Pandavas went much beyond. They not only staked their kingdom they also staked their wife Draupadi and lost both. Among the Aryans gambling was not the game of the rich. It was a vice of the many. So widespread was gambling among the Ancient Aryans that the burden of all the writers of the Dharma Sutras (Shastras?) was to impress upon the King the urgency of controlling it by State Authorities under stringent laws”.</p>
<p><span id="more-4859"></span></p>
<p>Dr. Ambedkar also wrote, “Coming to Kali it is one of the cycles made up of four Yugas: Krita, Treta, Dwapar and Kali. What is the origin of the term Kali? The terms Krita, Treta, Dwapar and Kali are known to have been used in the three different connections. The earliest use of the term Kali as well as of other terms is connected with the game of dice. From the Rig-Veda it appears that the dice piece that was used in the game was made of the brown fruit of the Vibhidaka tree being about the size of a nutmeg, nearly round with five slightly flattened sides. Later on the dice was made of four sides instead of five. Each side was marked with different numerals 4, 3, 2 and 1. The side marked with 4 was called Krita, with 3 Treta, with 2 Dwapara and with 1 Kali.”</p>
<p>As Dr. Ambedkar said, four Yugas (stages of life) are named after dice throws. Dice were four sided, the side marked with 4 was called Krita, with 3 Treta, with 2 Dwapara and with 1 Kali. As per Chandogya Upanishad 4.1.4 the best throw or the winning throw was called Krita (another name for Satyayug), and the worst throw was called Kali. Chaupar form of gambling was most popular. The Sanskrit word Aksha (spelt Aksa) is generally used in Hindu text for Dice, in the Vedas dice were also called Babhru (brown) because nuts of Vibhidaka tree were used as dice in the Vedic period and later on cowries were also used while the oblong stick like dice known as Pasa were more popular. As per Rig Veda 1.41.9 a total number of four dices were used in the play and as per Satapatha Brahama 5:4:4:6 five dice were used in the play during Rajasuya ceremony. Gambling seems to have been part of amusement of the Kshatriya caste, Matsya Purana 61.32-33 states that a king Named Nimi used to play with women the game of dice, Markandeya Purana 20.1-5 mentions a king named Satrujit who &#8216;enjoyed himself both with gambling pastimes, and in the discipline of all kinds of weapons&#8217;.</p>
<p>Manu was a critic of gambling while there are various other lawmakers such as Yajnavalkya, Vasistha, Narada, Kautilya (Chanayakya)… commentators like Vijnaneswara, Haradatta who not only allowed gambling but even allowed gambling houses to run under state’s supervision. Puranas seems to be unfavourable to gambling while also providing some rituals and spells to ensure success in gambling. Same is the case with the Vedas, Rig Veda seems to censure gambling while the Atharva Veda has hymns for success in gambling. Seems like the early Aryans in Rigvedic period were averse to gambling and later developed fondness for gambling in the Atharvavedic period.</p>
<p>As per Gaudiya Vaishnavite (ISKCON) text, Kalidasa used to play dice in jest,</p>
<p>CC Antya Lila 16.6-7 “Kālidāsa was a very advanced devotee, yet he was simple and liberal. He would chant the holy name of Kṛṣṇa while performing all his ordinary dealings. When he used to throw dice in jest, he would chant Hare Kṛṣṇa while throwing the dice.”</p>
<p>In Kalki Purana 33.23 Kalki avatar is described as holding a conch, dice, club, lotus and bow in his hands. These two are not the only religious personalities of Hinduism who enjoyed gambling, there are other gods in Hinduism as well who enjoyed gambling very much and some were even addicted to it.</p>
<h1>Gods Playing Game of Dice</h1>

<p><strong>Shiva &amp; Parvati</strong></p>
<p>Have you ever wondered why Hindus gambles during their festival Diwali? Well, to learn about it you need to look it up in their texts. It is said that gambling during the day of Diwali was started by Shiva and his wife Parvati. Parvati invoked Lakshmi before the game started who seems to have helped her win the game, Shiva lost everything he had and the last stake was that he should remove his clothes, Shiva lost the last bet too and denuded himself. Parvati then declared that it is auspicious to gamble on this Pratipad, and the person who gambles on this day would mint money throughout the year,</p>
<p>Skanda Purana Book II, Section IV, Chapter 10, verse 20 “Sankara and Bhavani played the game of dice by way of fun formerly. Sambhu was defeated by Gauri in the game and let off naked. For that reason Sankara became miserable while Gauri was ever happy.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare.</p>
<p>Parvati also said that gambling only on the eve of Diwali is allowed. Shiva and Parvati playing dice is also mentioned in Skanda Purana I.i.34.76 and Padma Purana VI.122.21-32 which I have mentioned below,</p>
<p>Padma Purana Section VI, Chapter 122, verses 21-32 &#8220;&#8230;Siva and Bhavani took to playing with dice as a sport. Laksmi, propitiated by Bhavani remained in the form of a cow. Formerly Parvati vanquished Siva in the game of dice, and sent him away naked. So this Siva is unhappy. Gauri always remains happy. He who gets victory first (passes) the year happily&#8230;On the first day, when the sun has risen, Govardhana should be worshipped in the morning and one should play the game of dice at night. Then cows should be decorated&#8230;&#8221; Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p><strong>Krishna</strong></p>
<p>While watching Draupadi’s Cheerharan a question may have arose in the mind that why didn’t Krishna stop it? Why didn’t he stop the Pandavas and Kauravas from gambling? Well, the answer is Krishna wasn’t just fond of women or enjoying liquor but he was also addicted to gambling. He used to gamble with his wives, concubines and friend,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 10.69.19-22 “Nārada then entered the palace of another of Lord Kṛṣṇa’s wives, my dear King. He was eager to witness the spiritual potency possessed by the master of all masters of mystic power. There he saw the Lord playing at dice with His beloved consort and His friend Uddhava.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 10.56.5 “As the people looked at Satrājit from a distance, his brilliance blinded them. They presumed he was the sun-god, Sūrya, and went to tell Lord Kṛṣṇa, who was at that time playing at dice.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 10.66.36 “Distraught with fear, the people cried out to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who was then playing at dice in the royal court: “Save us! Save us, O Lord of the three worlds, from this fire burning up the city!”.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Varaha Purana 160.52-53 &#8220;At Uttarakoti (the northern end), there is again Ganesa. Here Lord Krsna was playing dice with the Gopis. Merrily playing with them, the Lord won all of them and their wealth in the game. He gave them all to the Gopas who commemorated the event there.&#8221; Tr. Venkitasubramonia Iyer</p>
<p>Aniruddha the son of Krishna was also fond of gambling,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 10.62.28-31 “Very agitated to hear of his daughter’s corruption, Bāṇāsura rushed at once to the maidens’ quarters. There he saw the pride of the Yadus, Aniruddha. Bāṇāsura saw before him Cupid’s own son, possessed of unrivaled beauty, with dark-blue complexion&#8230; As He sat opposite His most auspicious lover, playing with her at dice, there hung between His arms a garland of spring jasmines that had been smeared with kuṅkuma powder from her breasts when He had embraced her. Bāṇāsura was astonished to see all this. Seeing Bāṇāsura enter with many armed guards, Aniruddha raised His iron club and stood resolute, ready to strike anyone who attacked Him.</p>
<p><strong>Balrama</strong></p>
<p>Balarama is sometime considered an avatar of Vishnu. As per Hindu text, Balarama was addicted to gambling. Balarama is said to have played dice with Rukmi the brother in law of Krishna. It is said that Rukmi wanted to avenge the elopement of his sister Rukmini by Krishna so he challenged Balarama the brother of Krishna in the game of dice who accepted it without hesitation though he wasn’t an expert at it. Balarama lost many bets to Rukmi but won the final bet which was very big. Then an argument ensued between Rukmi and Balarama that Balarama had cheated him (Rukmi) and that Rukmi is the real winner. Balarama couldn’t tolerate this so he killed Rukmi for such petty argument,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 10.61.27- “After the wedding, a group of arrogant kings headed by the King of Kaliṅga told Rukmī, “You should defeat Balarāma at dice. He’s not expert at dice, O King, but still He’s quite addicted to it.” Thus advised, Rukmī challenged Balarāma and began a gambling match with Him. In that match Lord Balarāma first accepted a wager of one hundred coins, then one thousand, then ten thousand. Rukmī won this first round, and the King of Kaliṅga laughed loudly at Lord Balarāma, showing all his teeth. Lord Balarāma could not tolerate this. Next Rukmī accepted a bet of one hundred thousand coins, which Lord Balarāma won. But Rukmī tried to cheat, declaring “I’m the winner!”.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Same is repeated in Brahma Purana 92.11-22 and also mentioned in Vishnu Purana,</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 5.23.10-28 “After the wedding had been solemnized, several of the kings, headed by him of Kalinga, said to Rukmin, &#8220;This wielder of the ploughshare is ignorant of the dice, which may be converted into his misfortune: why may we not contend with him, and beat him, in play?&#8221; The potent Rukmin replied to them, and said, &#8220;So let it be:&#8221; and he engaged Balaráma at a game of dice in the palace. Balaráma soon lost to Rukmin a thousand Nishkas: he then staked and lost another thousand; and then pledged ten thousand, which Rukmin, who was well skilled in gambling, also won. At this the king of Kalinga laughed aloud, and the weak and exulting Rukmin grinned, and said, &#8220;Baladeva is losing, for he knows nothing of the game; although, blinded by a vain passion for play, he thinks he understands the dice.&#8221; Halayudha, galled by the broad laughter of the Kalinga prince, and the contemptuous speech of Rukmin, was exceedingly angry, and, overcome with passion, increased his stake to ten millions of Nishkas. Rukmin accepted the challenge, and therefore threw the dice. Baladeva won, and cried aloud, &#8220;The stake is mine.&#8221; But Rukmin called out as loudly, that he was the winner. &#8220;Tell no lies, Bala,&#8221; said he: &#8220;the stake is yours; that is true; but I did not agree to it: although this be won by you, yet still I am the winner.&#8221; A deep voice was then heard in the sky, inflaming still more the anger of the high-spirited Baladeva, saying, &#8220;Bala has rightly won the whole sum, and Rukmin speaks falsely: although he did not accept the pledge in words, he did so by his acts (having cast the dice).&#8221; Balaráma thus excited, his eyes red with rage, started up, and struck Rukmin with the board on which the game was played, and killed him… When Krishńa heard that Rukmin had been killed by his brother, he made no remark, being afraid of Rukminí on the one hand, and of Bala on the other…” Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p><strong>Indra</strong></p>
<p>Indra the king of all gods staked Urvashi in gambling with Pramati,</p>
<p>Brahma Purana, Gautami Mahatmya 101.9-12 &#8220;Indra said to Pramati: &#8216;In the same manner, give as requital your virtuous right hand along with its protecting cover as well as arrows. We shall gamble.&#8217; After entering into an agreement like this both of them began to play at dice. Pramati won the stake, viz., Urvasi, the divine damsel. After winning her Pramati said to Indra audaciously. Pramati said: (Offer) something else as requital. I shall then, O lord, play at dice with you. Indra said: O king, (I offer as stake) the thunderbolt worthy of Devas and the excellent chariot famous for having been used in various campaigns.&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<h1>Hindu Scriptures on Gambling</h1>
<p>Some Hindu texts not just allows gambling but even legalises gambling houses and levies tax on it, the winner must also set aside a portion of the gains for the king. The gambling houses are regulated by the state and there must also be a superintendent of the gaming house supervising the game. In case there is a dispute between two parties, then either the superintendent or other gamblers must settle the dispute and in case if other gamblers are enemies of either party then the dispute is to be settled by the king. Some text says that the gamblers needs to take permission for gambling from the king, in case he plays without government’s permission then he is punished by the authority. There are also strict rules set by the authority, those who cheat in gambling are punished severely by the state and sometimes they are even banished from the state.</p>
<p>Swami Prabhupada the founder of ISKCON implied that gambling is permissible for Kshatriyas,</p>
<p>“A <em>kṣatriya</em> is not supposed to refuse to battle or gamble when he is so invited by some rival party…” <strong>Swami Prabhupada on Gita 1.37-38</strong> <a href="http://www.vedabase.com/en/bg/1/37-38" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">http://www.vedabase.com/en/bg/1/37-38<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>Yajnavalkya Smriti Chapter II, Verses 199-203 &#8220;The keeper of a gambling-house shall take from a gambler five per cent. When the wager is a hundred [panas or upwards], and ten per cent, in other cases. Being well protected [by the king], he shall give the promised share [of his gains] to the king; he shall recover the wager, and pay it to the winner, [and] being over patient, [shall speak] the truth. [Payment of] that which has been won publicly in an assembly of gamesters in the presence of the master of a gaming house, and when the king&#8217;s share has been paid, shall be enforced, but not otherwise. The superintendents and witnesses in [gaming] transactions [should be] gamblers themselves. A man who plays with false dice, or by deceit, shall be branded and banished by the king. Gaming should be allowed under one supervision, as being a means of detecting thieves. This very law should be understood to apply in the case of Samahvaya [prize-fighting].&#8221; Tr. Vishwanath Narayan Mandlik</p>
<p><strong>Vijnanesvara in his Mitakshara comments on the above verses</strong>, &#8220;The officer of the gambling house, for whom provision has thus been made-he being protected from rogues and gamesters by the king-shall pay to the king a portion as agreed upon. Similarly, he should recover the amount of the wager i.e., should recover it from the losing party, by accepting a pledge or by arrest etc. And having recovered that amount, he, the keeper, should pay it to the winner i.e., the successful party. Also, being (ever) patient, he should always declare a true decision to the gamblers. That has been stated by Narada: &#8216;The master of the gaming house shall arrange the game, and pay the stakes won therein&#8217;.&#8221;<br />
<em>As mentioned in Legal and Constitutional History of India: Ancient, Judicial and Constitutional System, p.212, by Rama Jois, Published by Universal Law Publishing, 2004.</em></p>
<p>Apastamba Dharma Shastra, Prasna 2, Patala 10, Khanda 25, verses 12-13 In the midst of the assembly-house, (the superintendent of the house) shall raise a play-table and sprinkle it with water, turning his hand downwards, and place on it dice in even numbers, made of Vibhîtaka (wood), as many as are wanted. Men of the first three castes, who are pure and truthful, may be allowed to play there.</p>
<p>Commenting on Apastamba, Haradatta says that Gambling should be played in gambling house only, and the king is supposed to punish those who play it elsewhere. Translator of Apastamba Dharma Shastra also quoted commentary of Hindu scholar Haradatta in footnotes, Haradatta wrote,</p>
<p>&#8220;Having played there, they shall give a fixed sum to the gambling-house keeper and go away. The latter shall, every day or every month or every year, give that gain to the king. And the king shall punish those who play elsewhere or quarrel in the assembly-house&#8221;<br />

<p>Narada declares gambling to be lawful amusement, when carried on in a public gaming-house with prior permission of the king.</p>
<p>Narada Smriti 18.2-8 The master of the gaming-house shall arrange the game and pay the stakes which have been won; the profit of such a conductor of games shall amount to ten percent. When the dice on being thrown fall twice in a game at dice, those acquainted with (playing at) dice allot the victory to the adversary and the defeat to the gambler. When a dispute has arisen among gamblers, let (other) gamblers be appealed to; they shall act both as judges and as witnesses in a dispute of this sort. No gambler shall ever enter into another gaming-house before having paid his debt; he must not disobey the master of the gaming-house, and must pay of his own accord what he owes to him. Wicked men who play with false dice shall be driven out of the gaming-house, after a wreath of the punishment ordained for them. If a man gambles with dice, without authorization from the king, he shall not get his stake, and shall have to pay a fine. Or let the gamblers pay to the king the share due to him and play in public, thus no wrong will be committed.</p>
<p>Brihaspati mentions why Manu prohibits gambling and then mentions rules for gamblers and gambling houses,</p>
<p>Brihaspati Smriti 26.1-8 &#8220;Gambling has been prohibited by Manu, because it destroys truth, honesty, and wealth. It has been permitted by other (legislators) when conducted so as to allow the king a share (of every stake). It shall take place under the superintendence of keepers of gaming-houses, as it serves the purpose of discovering thieves. The same rule has to be observed in bets on prize-fights with animals&#8230;A wager (or game) shall be made in public; false gamblers shall be banished. When there is a point at issue between the two parties (in a game or wager, other) gamblers shall examine (and decide) the matter; if they are enemies (of either party), the king shall decide the dispute&#8230;The keeper of the gaming-house shall receive the stakes and pay the victorious gambler and the king; he shall also act as witness in a dispute, assisted by three other gamblers.</p>
<p>Katyayana Smriti verse 935-943 &#8220;If it (gambling) has to remain (has to be allowed) he (the king) should allow it to be done openly with an (ornamental) arcch erected near the door (of the gambling hall) in order that respectable people may not mistaken (about its real nature) and he should make it yield revenue (tax). The keeper of the gaming house should make the gambling go on and should himself pay to the king (the latter&#8217;s) dues. He (the keeper) should take from the defeated party ten percent as his profit. The keeper should give to the winner his money (out of his own pocket) and he should recover from the defeated gambler within three fortnights or at once; there is no doubt (about this rule). Where (the throw) of a man playing with dice in gambling is the same or double (of the previous throw) there the (former) gambler is the winner and his protection (from the other gamblers) is to be arranged for. Or the gambler (himself), after giving to the king his share (of revenue) as declared, should carry on gambling openly. In this way he will be guilty of no fault. The keeper of the gaming house should make the defeated gambler forcibly pay what (the defeated) has to pay in the same place (i.e. in the gaming hall) and not elsewhere; since the procedure (in gambling matters) entirely rests with the keeper of the gaming house. A person ignorant (of gambling) if defeated (in gambling) should be released (from his liability), but one who knows gambling should not be released if he is defeated in secret (gambling); when one knowing gambling has lost his all (in a wager), he should not be made to pay his all. In disputes (among gamblers), in (deciding on) victory, in the matter of the gain (to the winner), and as regards the means (i.e. dice) of those who are (alleged to be) playing with false dice, the keeper of the gaming house, if he is honest, is the final authority.&#8221; Tr. P.V. Kane</p>
<p>Kautilya’s Arthashastra allows gambling and states that it could be helpful to identify thieves as there is more possibility of thieves coming in gambling-hall to try their luck with stolen money, other than that it also states how much percentage the superintendents should charge from winners and those who cheat in the play,</p>
<p>Kautilya Arthashastra, Book 3, Chapter 20, Verses 12-14 &#8220;With a view to find out spies or thieves, the Superintendent of gambling shall, under the penalty of a fine of 12 panas if played elsewhere, centralise gambling&#8230;The Superintendents of gambling shall, therefore, be honest and supply dice at the rate of a kakani of hire per pair. Substitution by tricks of hand of dice other than thus supplied shall be punished with a fine of 12 panas. A false player shall not only be punished with the first amercement and fines leviable for theft and deceit, but also be made to forfeit the stakes he has won. The Superintendent shall take not only 5 per cent of the stakes won by every winner, and the hire payable for supplying dice and other accessories of dice play, but also the fee chargeable for supplying water and accommodation, besides the charge for license&#8230;&#8221; Tr. R. Shamasastry</p>
<p>Other than the Smritis the Purana also sets guidelines for gambling. Matsya Purana gives guidelines to servant of the state,</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 216.8 &#8220;In course of gambling and at the game of dice one should show his skill to the king but make the latter win.&#8221; Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, edited by B.D Basu</p>
<p>Agni Purana allows gambling with prior permission of the king and also states the amount of fine and punishment to those who cheat in gambling,</p>
<p>Agni Purana 253.13-30 &#8220;&#8230;Gambling (divine) consists in playing with dice, rods and Vajra, while the play known as human gambling consists in playing the game, known as the Panchakrida. A non-conformity to the king&#8217;s law or an act in direct contravention of a royal edict or order, constitutes an offence&#8230;&#8221; Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Agni Purana 257.47-53 &#8220;In duels or in gambling, the king shall receive five percent., of the fine imposed, while the king&#8217;s due is ten percent., on all fines realised from cheats and swindlers. Witnesses wilfully perjuring themselves in courts of justice, or gamblers winning any stake by foul play, should be banished from the country, branded with the insignia of the king.&#8221; Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Dice was also played as part of the Rajasuya ceremony which is the consecration ceremony of the king, although it’s not actually gambling but seems to be ritualistic play,</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana 5:4:4:6-23 He then throws the five dice into his hand, with (Vâg. S. X, 28), &#8216;Dominant thou art: may these five regions of thine prosper!&#8217;&#8211;now that one, the Kali, is indeed dominant over the (other) dice, for that one dominates over all the dice: therefore he says, &#8216;Dominant thou art: may these five regions of thine prosper!&#8217; for there are indeed five regions, and all the regions he thereby causes to prosper for him…Thereupon the tribesman and the Pratiprasthâtri, with that sacrificial sword, prepare the gaming-ground, (close) by the original fire, with the puroruk verse of the Sukra. The Sukra is the eater: he thereby makes (him) the eater…The Adhvaryu then takes clarified butter in four ladlings, places a piece of gold on the gaming-ground, and offers with (Vâg. S. X, 29), &#8216;May ample Agni, the lord of rites, delighted,&#8211;may ample Agni, the lord of rites, accept of the butter, hail!&#8217; He (the Adhvaryu) throws down the dice, with, &#8216;Hallowed by Svâhâ, strive ye with Sûrya&#8217;s rays for the middlemost place among brethren!&#8217; For that gaming-ground is the same as &#8216;ample Agni,&#8217; and those dice are his coals, thus it is him (Agni) he thereby pleases; and assuredly in the house of him who offers the Râgasûya, or who so knows this, the striking 1 of that cow is approved of. On those dice he says, &#8216;Play for the cow!&#8217; The two draught oxen of the original (hall-door) fire are the sacrificial fee.</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana 5:3:1:10 And on the following day, having brought together gavedhukâ (seeds) from the houses of the Keeper of the dice (akshâvâpa) and the Huntsman (govikartana), he prepares a gavedhukâ pap for Rudra at the house of him who is consecrated. These two, while being two jewels (of the king), he makes one for the purpose of completeness. And as to why he performs this offering,&#8211;Rudra is hankering after that (cow) which is killed here in this hall; now Rudra is Agni (fire), and the gaming-board being fire, and the dice being its coals, it is him (Rudra) he thereby pleases. And verily whosoever, that knows this thus, performs the Râgasûya, in his house that approved (cow) is killed. And he, the keeper of dice, and the huntsman, are (each of them) assuredly one of his (the king&#8217;s) jewels: it is for these two that he is thereby consecrated, and these two he makes his own faithful followers. The sacrificial fee for this (jewel) is a bicoloured bullock&#8211;either one with white fore-feet, or a white-tailed one,&#8211;a claw-shaped knife, and a dice-board with a horsehair band; for that is what belongs to those two.</p>
<p>Eggeling wrote, “In Taitt. Br. I, 7, 10 the game at dice, at the Râgasûya, is referred to as follows:&#8211;With, &#8216;This king has overcome the regions,&#8217; he hands (to the king) five dice; for these are all the dice: he thereby renders him invincible. They engage (to play) for a dish of rice (odana), for that is (a symbol of) the chief: he thus makes him obtain every prosperity. He addresses them (with the epithets of) &#8216;far-famed, most prosperous, true king.&#8217; The Commentary and Sûtras then supply the following explanations:&#8211;The keeper of the dice (akshâvâpa), having (marked off and) raised the gambling-ground (by means of the wooden sword), and sprinkled it, throws down more than a hundred&#8211;or more than a thousand&#8211;gold dice. From them he takes five dice and hands them to the king: these, as representing the five regions, are taken to include all those dice.”</p>

<p>It’s not just the Puranas and Shastra which gives these details. There are dedicated hymns in Atharva Veda to ensure success in gambling. Mostly the Apsaras were invoked during prayers for success in gambling. There are total number of 4 hymns with various other verses dedicated for ensuring success in gambling,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 4.38.1-4 “Hither I call the Apsaras, victorious, who plays with skill, Her who comes freely fort to view, who wins the stakes in games of dice. Hither I call that Apsaras who scatters and who gathers up. The Apsaras who plays with skill and takes her winnings in the game. Dancing around us with the dice, winning the wager by her play. Hither I call that Apsaras, the joyous, the delightful one—Those nymphs who revel in the dice, who suffer grief and yield to wrath.” Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>Another English translation,</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 4.38.1-4 “The successful, victorious, skilfully gaming Apsarâ, that Apsarâ who makes the winnings in the game of dice, do I call hither. The skilfully gaming Apsarâ who sweeps and heaps up (the stakes), that Apsarâ who takes the winnings in the game of dice, do I call hither. May she, who dances about with the dice, when she takes the stakes from the game of dice, when she desires to win for us, obtain the advantage by (her) magic! May she come to us full of abundance! Let them not win this wealth of ours! The (Apsarâs) who rejoice in dice, who carry grief and wrath-that joyful and exulting Apsarâ, do I call hither.” Tr. Maurice Bloomfield</p>
<p>Another English translation,</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 4.38.1-4 &#8220;The up-shooting, all conquering, successfully-playing Apsaras, that wins (kr) the winnings in the pool (?glaha) that Apsaras I call on here. The distributing (vi-ci), on strewing (a-kir), successfully-playing Apsaras, that seizes (grah) the winnings in the pool that Apsaras I call on here. She who dances about with the dice (?aya), taking to herself the winning from the pool let her, trying to gain (?) for us the winnings, obtain the stake (?praha) by magic (maya); let her come to us rich in milk; let them not conquer from us this riches. She who delights (pra-mud) in the dice (aksa), bringing (bhr) pain and anger the rejoicing, the delighting one: that Apsaras I call on here.&#8221; Tr. William Dwight Whitney</p>

Bear butter to the Apsarases, O Agni, and to the Dice bear dust and sand and water…Evil be mine opponent&#8217;s luck! Sprinkle thou butter over us. Strike, as a tree with lightning flash, mine adversary in the game. The God who found for us this wealth for gambling, to cast the dice and count the winning number…As I invoke the Gods at need, as I have lived in chastity, May these, when I have grasped the Dice, the brown, be kind to one like me.” Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>Another English translation,</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 7.109.1-7 &#8220;This homage to the formidable brown one, who among the dice is self-controller; with ghee do I aid (?) Kali; may he be gracious to us in such plight. Do thou, O Agni, carry ghee for the Apsarases, dust for the dice, gravel and waters; enjoying in their respective shares the oblation-giving, the gods revel in both kinds of oblations&#8230;Let them make the rival gambler subject to me. Ill luck (?) to the opposing player; do thou shed upon us with ghee; smite thou him who plays against us as a tree with a thunderbolt. He who made this riches for our playing, who the taking (?) and leaving of the dice that god, enjoying this libation of ours&#8230;If (yat) a supplicant I call on the gods, if we have dwelt in Vedic studentship, if I take up the brown dice let them be gracious to us in such plight.&#8221; Tr.

<p>Part of the grandiose anti-Muslim conspiracy theory espoused by Islamophobes today includes the idea that Muslims are, in the words of Robert Spencer, involved in “large scale deception campaigns today.” <a href="http://spencerwatch.com/#F1" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><sup>[1]</sup><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> Spencer dedicates chapter 6 of his book <em>The Politically Incorrect Guide to Islam (and the Crusades</em>) to convince his readers that Islamic law allows for and even encourages lying “if it fosters the growth of Islam.” <a href="http://spencerwatch.com/#F2" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><sup>[2]</sup><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> In this manner, moderate Muslim-Americans are cast away as “stealth jihadists”, who are simply using deception to further their belligerent faith.  Any Muslim who says otherwise is accused of lying.  When moderate Muslims express their peaceful views, these are dismissed as “deception campaigns.”  On the other hand, when extremist and fundamentalist Muslims express their belligerent views, these are accepted as being “<em>real </em>Islam.”</p>

<h3><a name="Is-Lying-Acceptable-in-Certain-Circumstances"></a>Is Lying acceptable in certain circumstances?</h3>
<p>The Prophet Muhammad repeatedly commanded his followers to be truthful.  Lying is no small sin in Islam, and in fact leads to Hell.  Robert Spencer himself acknowledges as much, saying:</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p>Muhammad minced no words about the necessity of telling the truth: “It is obligatory for you to tell the truth, for truth leads to virtue and virtue leads to Paradise, and the man who continues to speak the truth and endeavors to tell the truth is eventually recorded as truthful with Allah, and beware of telling of a lie for telling of a lie leads to obscenity and obscenity leads to Hell-Fire, and the person who keeps telling lies and endeavors to tell a lie is recorded as a liar with Allah.” <a href="http://spencerwatch.com/#F3" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><sup>[3]</sup><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p></blockquote>
<p>There are dozens of other Prophetic traditions that say the same.</p>
<p>However, Spencer argues in his book that while lying is generally prohibited, “Islam allows for lying…in certain circumstances.”  <a href="http://spencerwatch.com/#F4" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><sup>[4]</sup><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> Having established this, Spencer boldly entitles the chapter “Islamic Law: Lie, Steal, and Kill,” arguing that Islam is the one religion on earth that advocates lying.  On the same page, Robert Spencer opposes “the idea that Islam shares the general moral outlook of Judaism and Christianity.”  In particular, “Islam doesn’t have a moral code analogous to the Ten Commandments.”  By this, he means to say that the religion of Islam does not hold fast to the 9th Commandment, which prohibits lying: “Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor.”</p>
<p>Before we proceed, it should be very clear that it is Robert Spencer himself who opens up the chapter by comparing the Judeo-Christian belief system to Islam.  Therefore, when we question this comparison, let our opponents not cry “<em>tu quoque, tu qouque!</em>” as they always do whenever we point out their bold-faced hypocrisy and double standards.  What Spencer is saying is quite clear: unlike other religions, Judaism and his own Christianity in particular, Islam advocates lying in certain circumstances.</p>
<p>The revelation, that Islam allows for lying in certain circumstances, is supposed to shock the mind. <em>Ohmigosh, how could a religion sanction lying!?</em> But if we move past sanctimonious outrage, we realize that any moral code, be it based in religious faith or atheistic humanism, should allow for lying <em> in certain circumstances</em>.  That’s the most obvious thing in the world.  If, for example, the Nazis knock on your door and ask you “are you hiding any Jews in your attic?”, would Robert Spencer demand you to be truthful and say “yes”?  In that circumstance, lying should not only be allowed, but encouraged or even obligated.  A moral code that did not allow for a lie in this circumstance would be highly flawed. This is simply common sense.  No moral code, be it religious or otherwise, ought to command honesty <em>without exception</em>.  It’s common sense that there should be some exceptions to truth-telling.</p>
<p>In Islam, the Prophet Muhammad allowed for three (and only three) exceptions to the rule of truth-telling:</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p>Lying is not permitted except in three cases: (1) a man’s speaking to his wife to make her happy; (2) lying at times of war; (3) and lying in order to reconcile between people. <a href="http://spencerwatch.com/#F5" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><sup>[5]</sup><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p></blockquote>
<p>Let us review each of these scenarios one by one.</p>
<h3><a name="man-speaking-wife"></a>A Man&#8217;s speaking to his wife to make her happy</h3>
<p>Under Islamic law, a husband is permitted to lie to his wife if she asks him “do I look beautiful?”  So as not to hurt her feelings, the husband may claim she is the most beautiful woman on earth, even if in reality she looks horribly ugly.  This permission is given to the husband, argue Islamic jurists, to safeguard the woman’s feelings.  It would be cruel, they say, to be honest in this case. (One cannot help but be reminded of the epic <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3Dcdy3orO6tQA" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Geico commercial<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>.)</p>
<p>Lest our opponents, the self-proclaimed defenders of the Judeo-Christian tradition, doth protest too much, let us note that the Jewish tradition itself discussed <em>this very situation</em> in none other than the Talmud.  In the book entitled <em>The Book of Jewish Values</em>, Rabbi Joseph Telushkin says:</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p><strong>When, If Ever, Is It Permitted to Lie? (2): Judaism and White Lies</strong></p>
<p>The Talmud records an unusual debate between the houses of Hillel and Shammai concerning the words celebrants should sing when dancing in front of a newly married woman. According to the House of Hillel, the dancers should chant the same words in front of all brides: “What a beautiful and graceful bride!” Their opponents, the House of Shammai, disagree. “If she is lame or blind, are you going to say of her, ‘What a beautiful and graceful bride?’ Does not the Torah command, ‘Stay away from falsehood?’” (Exodus 23:7) They thus oppose reciting a standard formula; rather, each bride should be described “as she is” (see Ketubot 17a). <a href="http://spencerwatch.com/#F6" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><sup>[6]</sup><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p></blockquote>
<p>The opinion of the house of Hilel, that a lie should be uttered in this case, became “accepted as Jewish law”:</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p>Hillel’s position is accepted as Jewish law.  One praises the beauty of all brides.  <a href="http://spencerwatch.com/#F7" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><sup>[7]</sup><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p></blockquote>
<p>Rabbi Telushkin continues:</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p>If somebody at a party asks you how they look, and you think they don’t look well at all, a blunt statement of what you feel may cause the person terrible discomfort, and accomplish no good whatsoever…There are indeed times when a petty lie is preferrable to an ugly truth. <a href="http://spencerwatch.com/#F8" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><sup>[8]</sup><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p></blockquote>
<p>Christians have also debated this topic.  Professor Michael Heiser, an instructor at the <em>MEMRA Institute for Biblical &amp; Ancient Studies</em> and Academic Editor for <em>Bible Study Magazine</em>, argues that the 9th Commandment does not prohibit <em>all </em>lies.  In a post entitled <a href="http://michaelsheiser.com/TheNakedBible/2010/03/lying-and-deception/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Lies and Deception<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, this professor gives his Biblical view that “deception” is sanctioned in certain circumstances:</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p>Let’s think about some real life situations. I do not believe the ninth commandment was given to force full, exhaustively detailed “truth telling” to questions like the following:</p>
<p>1. Do I look fat in this dress?<br />
2. Doctor, did my little boy suffer before he died?<br />
3. How do I look?</p></blockquote>
<p>Not only is deception permitted to a Christian (in certain circumstances, of course), but the Christian God and a Christian prophet (Samuel) engaged in deception.  Prof. Heiser writes:</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p>In regard to the 1 Samuel 16 incident and the “does God lie?” question, I do not think God lied.  He did, however, certainly deceive…Samuel also did not lie…But, again, he plainly withheld information and deceived Saul’s men. Both God and Samuel were deceivers in this passage, but neither were liars. God may use deception to punish evil, but he does not lie.</p></blockquote>
<p>Imagine Robert Spencer’s reaction if an Islamic scholar said that God deceives to punish the evil of unbelievers.  Just imagine.</p>
<p><a name="lying-to-reconcile"></a>Lying in order to reconcile people</p>
<p>Another exception in Islam with regard to telling the truth is when it comes to reconciling people.  This, argue Muslims, is based on Islam’s emphasis on peace.  The Prophet Muhammad said:</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p><em>He who makes peace between the people by inventing good information or saying good things, is not a liar. <a href="http://spencerwatch.com/#F9" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><sup>[9]</sup><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> </em></p></blockquote>
<p>The Islamophobic website <em>ReligionofPeace.com</em> mocks this Prophetic saying, arguing that it justifies lying.  Yet, these “defenders of the Judeo-Christian tradition” do not realize that the exact same thing is found in their own religious tradition.  Rabbi Telushkin writes:</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p>According to Jewish law, one also should not go about telling people critical comments you hear made about them.  Indeed, if somebody asks you what another person said about him, you should leave out the negative comments by the other person…</p>
<p>When it comes to trying to reconcile feuding parties, Jewish law is remarkably tolerant of “white lies.”  Of Aaron, Moses’ brother and Israel’s first high priest, the Rabbis relate that he would utilize untruthful means to make peace between peopel who had fought.  He would go to one, telling how sad his adversary was about the dispute, and how ashamed and disheartened he felt.  Then he would go to the other and tell him the same thing.  As the Midrash concludes, “Later, when the two met, they would embrace and kiss each other” (The Fathers According to Rabbi Nathan 12:3)…</p>
<p>Jewish tradition endorses Aaron’s behavior…In instances of personal feuding, when truth and peace conflict, peace usually should take precedence. <a href="http://spencerwatch.com/#F10" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><sup>[10]</sup><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p></blockquote>
<p>Christian professor <a href="http://michaelsheiser.com/TheNakedBible/2010/03/lying-and-deception/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Dr. Michael Heiser<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> recognizes something similar in his own religious belief system:</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p>The ninth command was not given so evil could progress; it was given to STOP evil. It was not given to force us to hurt people’s feelings or crush their spirit, either. Withholding information is virtuous in these instances for reasons that should be obvious in context.</p></blockquote>
<p>Will these self-declared “defenders of the Judeo-Christian tradition” now burn in their own fury?</p>
<p><a name="Lying-war"></a>Lying in times of war</p>
<p>It is this third instance of permissible lying that Robert Spencer et al. make the most fuss about, especially the Prophet Muhammad’s statement that “war is deceit/deception.”</p>
<p>As mentioned by our very own <em> Inconnu</em>, the Prophet Muhammad made this statement during the Battle of the Trench.  The Confederates were threatening to use their overwhelming numbers to destroy the fledgling Islamic city-state of Medina.  They lay siege to the beleaguered city, and the entire religion of Islam was on the brink of being snuffed out entirely.  It was in this particular circumstance that a man named Nuaym ibn Masud was instructed by the Prophet Muhammad to break the deadly siege.  Nuaym said he could do this, but that “this requires me to lie.”  The Prophet replied with those now infamous words “war is deception.” And so Nuaym went to the various factions making up the Confederates and convinced them of the supposed disloyalty of their own allies.  This sowed discord and disunity in the enemy ranks, which the Muslims capitalized on to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat. <a href="http://spencerwatch.com/#F11" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><sup>[11]</sup><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>Two things are of note here.  First, the fact that Nuaym protested that “this requires me to lie” implies that he was cognizant of the fact that the Prophet Muhammad and the religion of Islam forbid lying in general.  Otherwise, he would not have said it.  It thus indicates that the early Muslims were known for their honesty.  Second, the context of the statement is imperative to understand:  The city of Medina was under siege, and the defenders of the city were heavily outnumbered by a ratio of more than 3:1.  This was a situation of “national importance.”  Lives would have been lost had these lies not been said.  It is strange that the extreme right-wingers like Robert Spencer can justify the nuclear annihilation of Japanese cities because “lives would have been lost” but can’t seem to understand why the Prophet Muhammad justified lying in this particular scenario.  Which is worse?  Nuclear annihilation or lying?</p>
<p>The idea that it would be necessary to lie during war is so self-explanatory that I feel a bit silly needing to draw this out.  But because Robert Spencer makes a great fuss about this, let me go over the top with this.  The idea that “war is deceit/deception” has been accepted since time immemorial.  As our very own Inconnu writes:</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p>In fact, “War is deceit” is one of the oldest military principles in history. It is found in none other than <em><a href="http://www.chinapage.com/sunzi-e.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">The Art of War <span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></em>by Sun Tzu, a Chinese strategist from the Sixth Century B.C. This book is the oldest military treatise in the world. In Part I, principle No. 18 says:</p>
<p><em>All warfare is based on deception</em>.</p></blockquote>
<p>This book forms the foundation of modern military thinking, and is listed in the <em>United States Marine Corps Professional Reading Program</em>.  The book is required reading for CIA officers, and recommended reading for all U.S. military intelligence personnel.   The book is required to be stocked in every major military library.  Is Robert Spencer being unpatriotic and un-American by criticizing the foundation principle of our U.S. military, namely that “all warfare is based on deception”?  But Spencer’s double standard is quite clear: it’s OK when Evangelical Christians in the U.S. military believe such a thing, but completely unacceptable if Muslims do.</p>
<p><em>Inconnu </em>goes on:</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p>How about the <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/%7Eplomio/history.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" data-wpel-link="external">Trojan Horse<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, a story from one of the oldest poems in Western Civilization? …Why doesn’t Spencer condemn the Greeks, the Fathers of Western Civilization, for practicing deceit in times of war?</p>
<p>Not only did Sun Tzu write of deception in warfare, but Italian Renaissance thinker <a href="http://www.strategypage.com/on_point/2004630.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Niccolo Machiavelli <span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>wrote:</p>
<p><em>Though fraud in other activities may be detestable, in the management of war it is laudable and glorious, and he who overcomes the enemy by fraud is as much to be praised as he who does by force.</em></p>
<p>How about more recent times? During World War II, there was a military operation called <a href="http://www.normandiememoire.com/NM60Italien/2_histo2/histo2_p5_gb.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">“Operation Fortitude.”<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> It was a disinformation campaign to deceive the Germans about the Normandy invasion:</p>
<p><em>“Fortitude” was the codename given to the decoy (or disinformation) mission mounted by the Allies to deceive the Germans about the date and above all the place of the landings…[The Germans] had to be made to think that a whole group of [Allied] armies was present in Kent, opposite the Pas-de-Calais.</em></p>
<p><em>To deceive the German observation planes…the local estuaries, creeks and harbours were crammed with dummy landing craft, made out of bits and bobs…For the benefit of the Germans, a team of technicians maintained constant radio traffic between totally fictitious units.</em></p>
<p><em>Fortitude succeeded beyond anyone’s wildest dreams. Long after June 6<sup>th</sup>, Hitler remained convinced that the Normandy Landings were a diversionary tactic to induce him to move his troops away from the Pas-de-Calais<strong>,</strong> so that a decisive attack could then be launched there. He therefore kept his best units in readiness there, until the end of July, desperately scanning an empty horizon, while the fate of the war was being decided in Normandy.</em></p>
<p>Dr. Joseph Caddell, Lecturer on Military History at North Carolina State University, <a href="http://www.fas.org/irp/eprint/deception.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">wrote<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> in 2004:</p>
<p><em>Deception in warfare is probably as old as armed conflict itself. The logic of confusing an adversary is obvious, and the rewards can be realized very quickly.</em></p>
<p>On the website of the <a href="http://www.au.af.mil/au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" data-wpel-link="external">Air University<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, the military education system for the United States Air Force, there is a list of numerous books, documents, and periodicals that chronicle deception in WW I and WW II. Here is just some of the examples of the books written about deception in warfare:</p>
<p><em>Barros, James and Gregor, James. Double Deception: Stalin, Hitler, and the Invasion of Russia. DeKalb, IL, Northern Illinois University Press, 1995. 307 p. <strong>Book call no.: 940.532247 B277d </strong></em></p>

<p>I think <em>Inconnu </em>makes his point very clear, but allow me to give another example:  The <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/army/arcent.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">U.S. military<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> used deception during the invasion of Iraq:</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p>Its war plan successfully deceived the Iraqis regarding disposition of allied ground forces</p></blockquote>
<p>Is Robert Spencer being unpatriotic and un-American for criticizing the U.S.’s tactic of using deception in their invasion of a Muslim-majority country?  If the U.S. military can be justified in its use of deception to <em>invade </em>and occupy a far weaker country, then how is the Prophet Muhammad to be faulted for using deception during war to <em> defend </em>his city-state from attack and destruction by a far superior force?</p>
<p>How about CIA officers trying to infiltrate the ranks of Al-Qaeda?  Should they not utilize deceit in order to safeguard their cover?</p>
<p>This is of course a completely absurd line of attack Robert Spencer has employed against Islamic law. But to completely cripple Spencer’s argument, let us once again turn to the Judeo-Christian tradition that Spencer so valiantly defends and promotes in his book.  Once again, a familiar pattern emerges: Spencer criticizes something about Islam that is found in his own religious belief system as well.</p>
<p><em>The Menorah: A Monthly Magazine for the Jewish Home</em> expounds:</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p>Deception in war…is legitimate according to Jewish law.  Joshua used stratagem in capturing the city of Ai (Josh. viii), and the same was copied against Bejamin (Jud. xx).  Ehud ben Gera killed Eglon, King of Moab, by disguise and deceit (Jud. iii., 20-22)…In our own times Gen. Fred Funston devised an artful plan to entrap Emilio Aguinaldo.  Such deceit, however, is recommended in order to avoid needless bloodshed and hasten peace. <a href="http://spencerwatch.com/#F12" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><sup>[12]</sup><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p></blockquote>
<p>Notice that the excerpt above seems to indicate that deceit is not only <em>permitted </em>in Jewish law but <em>recommended </em>in times of war.  Rabbi Telushkin says the same in his book entitled <em>A Code of Jewish Ethics</em>, and even indicates that assassinations by stealth are permitted according to the Bible:</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p>During a war, one may deceive enemies.  The Bible relates how Ya’el, a Kenite woman, invited the fleeing Canaanite general Sisera into her tent: “Turn aside, my Lord, turn aside to me; have no fear,” she told him, before lulling Sisera to sleep and then killing him…The prophetess Deborah praised Ya’el for her deception of Sisera (Judges 5:24-26; see also Judges 4:17-21)</p>
<p>…In short, in the proper circumstances, deception is not only tolerated, but applauded. <a href="http://spencerwatch.com/#F13" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><sup>[13]</sup><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p></blockquote>
<p>In the example of Ya’el and Sisera, we have Biblically-sanctioned treachery and assassination.  To bring this topic closer to home for Robert Spencer, let us quote from the Christian tradition.  <em>The British and Foreign Evangelical Review </em>says of Ya’el and Sisera:</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p>That there was treachery, is admitted on all hands.  The whole question resolves itself into this: Did Sisera deserve to be treacherously dealt with?  Was Jael [Ya’el] justified in taking the advantage of him [as] she did? …If the deceptions of war we noticed just now [in the Bible] are not immoral, then we regard Jael’s act as morally defensible…She must use stratagem to kill him. <a href="http://spencerwatch.com/#F14" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><sup>[14]</sup><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p></blockquote>
<p>In a section entitled <em>When Deceptions becomes Legitimate</em>, <em>The British and Foreign Evangelical Review</em> writes:</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p>Again, we find in the conquest that the Israelites were directed [by God] to practise certain deceptions upon their enemies…The moral aspect of these cases of deception on the part of God…[are justified by the] general understanding that in such circumstances “everything is fair” that can secure an advantage…There is no moral delinquency, therefore, in denying the whole truth to men, that is, in practising deception upon them, when it is understood that deception is part of the risk of war. <a href="http://spencerwatch.com/#F15" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><sup>[15]</sup><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p></blockquote>
<p>Should we berate Christians for their belief in lying during war and that “‘everything is fair’ that can secure an advantage”?  Can one imagine Robert Spencer’s reaction if a Muslim said that “everything is fair” if it secures an advantage for Islam?</p>
<p>Dr. Hans Martensen, the nineteenth century Catholic bishop who penned the epic book <em>Christian Dogmatics: Compendium of the Doctrines of Christianity</em>, writes in his book entitled <em>Christian Ethics</em>:</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p>Mutual deception cannot in this respect be condemned, since both sides are agreed in employing against each not force alone, but craft, together with all the artifices of war. <a href="http://spencerwatch.com/#F16" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><sup>[16]</sup><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p></blockquote>
<p>Dr. Mortensen is stressing an important point here, which I will return to later: <em>deception is mutually expected in war</em>.</p>
<p>In any case, it could be said–using the emotive language of Robert Spencer–that <em>deception in war is part of Christian ethics</em>.  Christian professor <a href="http://michaelsheiser.com/TheNakedBible/2010/03/lying-and-deception/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Dr. Michael Heiser<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> concurs that the “act of deception” and even “outright lie” is tolerated in war, even “HOLY war.”  In a post entitled “Does God lie,” <a href="http://michaelsheiser.com/TheNakedBible/2010/03/does-god-lie/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Prof. Heiser<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> says that God uses deception, and even argues that Jesus himself used deception:</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p>We know that there are specific statements asserting very clearly that God does not tell lies (e.g., <a href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/esv/Num.%2023.19" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Num. 23:19<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>; <a href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/esv/Titus%201.2" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Titus 1:2<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>). However, God does use deception.  Some of you no doubt will want to define lying so that it includes deception, but that is not only unwise, it puts you (and God) in a theological pickle…Why did Jesus demand deception (withholding the truth) on occasion? Why is that permissible?</p></blockquote>
<p>Why is it that Robert Spencer takes great offense to the Islamic prophet using deception in war to defend his city-state and religion from being wiped off the map, but on the other hand takes no issue with the Biblical prophet Joshua using deception in war, by the Command of God no less, to invade the city of Ai?  In a book entitled <em>The Art of Darkness: Deception and Urban Operations</em>, we read:</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p>In roughly 1200 BC, Joshua captured the city of Ai by means of deception. <a href="http://spencerwatch.com/#F17" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><sup>[17]</sup><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p></blockquote>
<p>The<em> Wiersbe Bible Commentary</em>, after citing numerous examples of Biblically sanctioned deception during war, concludes:</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p>Many people have been honored for deceiving the enemy during wartime and saving innocent lives, and this was war! <a href="http://spencerwatch.com/#F18" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><sup>[18]</sup><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p></blockquote>
<p>The gentleman Robert Spencer doth protest too much methinks.</p>
<h3><a name="Lying-to-Unbelievers"></a>Lying to Unbelievers</h3>
<p>Robert Spencer has implied in his book and website that Muslims are instructed to be honest only to fellow Muslims, and that they can lie to unbelievers.  Says Spencer:</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p>Muhammad minced no words about the necessity of telling the truth…However, as with so many other Islamic principles, this is largely a matter between believers.  When it comes to unbelievers–particularly those who are at war with Muslims–Muhammad enunciated a quite different principle: “War is deceit.” Specifically, he taught that lying was permissible in battle. <a href="http://spencerwatch.com/#F19" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><sup>[19]</sup><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p></blockquote>
<p>As I have said in <a href="http://spencerwatch.com/2010/08/11/is-robert-spencer-a-scholar-on-spencer%E2%80%99s-credentials-and-methodology/" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">my previous article<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> criticizing Robert Spencer’s methodology, he mixes half-truths (70% of his writings) with outright lies (the remaining 30%).  Here is where Spencer slips in a bold-faced lie.  (The irony of using deception while writing an article on deception should not be lost.)  In the text above, Spencer implies that Muslims don’t have to be honest with non-Muslims.  However, the reality is that the Prophet Muhammad never said that a Muslim can lie to a non-Muslim.  What he <em>did </em>say was:</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p>Lying is not permitted except in three cases: (1) a man’s speaking to his wife to make her happy; (2) lying at times of war; (3) and lying in order to reconcile between people. <a href="http://spencerwatch.com/#F20" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><sup>[20]</sup><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p></blockquote>
<p>Do you see the word “unbeliever”, “non-Muslim”, or “infidel” anywhere there?  No, no, and no.  Lying is permitted during war, and this has nothing to do with being a Muslim or non-Muslim.  Being a non-Muslim in this case is merely incidental.  Spencer’s insinuation to the contrary is dishonest and…deceitful.  Had the Prophet Muhammad wanted to say that lying to unbelievers is permitted, then he would simply have said as much: “Lying is not permitted except in three cases…(2) lying to unbelievers.”  But he didn’t.  And I challenge Spencer to bring forth a single quote from the Quran or the Prophetic traditions saying anything of the sort.</p>
<p>In fact, the early Muslims fought a civil war (the Battle of Siffin): Muslims vs. Muslims.  And guess what?  In this battle, one side used deception to cause discord in the opposing side’s ranks.  In Islamic history, this is one of the famous examples of the use of a ploy during battle.  To give a modern day example, the fundamentalist Taliban–whom Spencer considers “the <em>real </em>Muslims”–used deception to kill their fellow Muslim, a war hero who led the Northern Alliance. Deception, then, is merely a consequence of war.  Spencer is needlessly trying to make this into a Muslim vs. non-Muslim thing, when in fact it is simply a matter of war.  When Nuaym ibn Masud said that the ploy would require him to lie, the Prophet Muhammad did not justify it by saying “oh well, they are infidels anyways.”  Instead, he said that it was a time of war and therefore permissible.  The fact that Nuaym even asked indicates that the Muslims at that time did <em>not </em>think it was permissible to lie to unbelievers, nor were ever taught such.</p>
<p>The Prophet Muhammad was known by the name of <em>Al-Amin</em> (The Trustworthy), and even his greatest enemies did not know of him as a liar.  The only “lie” they counted against him was his claim to be a prophet of God.  Abu Sufyan, the leader of the Quraish (the archenemy of the Muslims at the time), was asked by Heraclius about the Prophet Muhammad’s honesty.  Heraclius asked: “Have you ever accused him of telling lies?…Does he break his promises?”  To both these questions, Abu Sufyan was forced to respond in the negative.   The Prophet Muhammad was known as being honest to all, regardless of religion.  Muslims today remember him as being honest to both Muslims and non-Muslims, which indicates that the religion of Islam honors honesty towards all human beings, irrespective of religious affiliation.</p>
<p>The Quran repeatedly mentions that the believers are those who stay honest to their oaths with the non-Muslims, and criticizes the Quraish idolaters for their failure to live up to their word.  After the battle of Uhud, the Muslims enter into a degrading peace treaty with the non-Muslims, and the Prophet Muhammad not only lives up to his side of the bargain, but also says that he does not even want to give a hint of not being honest to the agreement.  The Prophet was entrusted on numerous occasions with the wealth of non-Muslims, and he never violated or usurped their belongings.  And in the capacity of a merchant, he was just and honest with non-Muslims when it came to business transactions.  One could certainly argue that the Prophet Muhammad’s purported honesty may be a thing of legend, i.e. Islamic hagiography, but this is irrelevant: what is important here is that Muslims remember the Prophet as being honest to non-Muslims, a fact that indicates that Islam values honesty towards all human beings, including those outside the faith.</p>
<p>Clearly, Spencer has used deception to craft his argument, trying to conflate being non-Muslim with being at war.  The burden of proof is on Robert Spencer to prove his claim that Islam honors honesty only towards Muslims.  Can he show even one Quranic verse or Prophetic saying that advocates anything of the sort?</p>
<h3><a name="constitutes-war"></a>What constitutes war?</h3>
<p>Now Spencer and co. will claim that Muslims consider themselves at war with the United States and/or Western Christendom, so this allows them to lie.  After all, isn’t a state of war in the eyes of the beholder?  Yet, all of these arguments can equally be used against Judaism and Christianity.  As we have demonstrated earlier, Jews and Christians are allowed to lie during times of war.  The United States is at war with at least two Muslim-majority countries, and many would argue–such as Robert Spencer and other nutty right-wing extremists–that we are at war with radical Islam.  If this is so, does this mean that Robert Spencer and co. are allowed to lie and use deception in their campaign against radical Islam?  Ahh, perhaps this explains Spencer’s recurrent use of deceitful argumentation!  Suffice to say that any argument that the Islamophobes craft against Islam using this line of reasoning can be equally applied to Judaism and Christianity.</p>
<p>Having said that, Islamic law clearly defines what a war is.  It is an open state of hostilities, in which both sides recognize that they are at war with each other.  I explained in this article <a href="http://www.loonwatch.com/2009/11/major-nidal-hasan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">here<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> (see the comments as well) why a Muslim-American cannot consider himself at war with the United States.  Hence, Robert Spencer’s claims against Islam and Muslim-American spokesmen have no theological grounding.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Islam differentiates between “deceit/deception” and “treachery.”  The former is permitted in war, whereas the latter is not.  While it is true that the Prophet Muhammad said “war is deceit/deception”, one of his commandments to the Muslim soldiers was “do not be treacherous.” <a href="http://spencerwatch.com/#F21" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><sup>[21]</sup><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> So there is a difference in Islam between deceit and treachery, the former which is allowed and the latter which is not.  One Islamic apologist explained it as follows:</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p>Deceit in war simply means deceiving your enemy into thinking that your strategy is A while it is actually B. A perfect example is the deception that the Muslims employed on the kuffar in the Battle of the Ditch. Treachery means betrayal of a trust. Hence, you can deceive in war without being treacherous <strong>because you were never loyal to your enemy in the first place in order to have betrayed them.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>This is similar to what Dr. Hans Mortensen said as I quoted above, namely that there is a mutual expectation of deceit/deception during war.</p>
<p>The ultraconservative Islamic website, <a href="http://www.islam-qa.com/en/ref/10138" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Islam-qa.com<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, explains the difference between deceit/deception and treachery:</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light">[Question:] Does Islam permit deception in war? Is this considered to be betrayal and treachery?</p>
[Answer:] Praise be to Allaah.</p>
<p>Allaah has forbidden treachery and has condemned those who do it. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>
<p>“They are those with whom you made a covenant, but they break their covenant every time and they do not fear Allaah” [al-Anfaal  8:56]
<p>And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:</p>
<p>“Every betrayer will have a banner on the Day of Resurrection, by which he will be known.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6966; Muslim, 1736)</p>
<p>Al-Bukhaari narrated that Ibn ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: ‘The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘There are four characteristics, whoever has them all is a pure hypocrite: when he speaks, he lies; when he makes a promise he breaks it; when he is entrusted with something he betrays that trust; and when he argues, he speaks in an obscene manner. Whoever has one of these traits has a trait of hypocrisy until he gives it up.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 3878; Muslim, 58)</p>
<p>And it was narrated that Maalik said: “I heard that ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Abbaas said: ‘There is no people who betrays their covenant but Allaah gives their enemies power over them.” (al-Muwatta’, Baab ma jaa’a fi’l-wafa’ bi’l-‘ahd)</p>
<p>Yet despite this condemnation of betrayal, Islam allows deception in war in order to attain victory. Al-Nawawi said: “The scholars are agreed that it is permissible to deceive the kuffaar [infidels] <strong>in war</strong> in any way possible, <strong>except if that would mean breaking the terms of a treaty or trust, in which case it is not permitted.”</strong></p>
<p>The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “War is deceit.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 3029; Muslim, 58).  One of the most dangerous elements of deceit is taking the enemy by surprise and catching them unawares before they can get ready to fight. When the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) wanted to head for Makkah in order to conquer it, he ordered the Muslims to get ready without telling anyone of his intention until after they had set out for Makkah, and after taking all precautions to prevent news of that reaching the mushrikeen. And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to send out many raiding parties, and he would tell them to travel by night and conceal themselves by day so that they could catch the enemy unawares.</p>
<p>Although it is permissible to use deception in war, we say that Islam has attained a high standard of ethics with regard to the use of these tricks in war. Among the most prominent examples of that are the following:</p>
<p>‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab wrote to the commander of an army that he had sent out: “I have heard that some men among you look for kaafirs, then when they run to hide in difficult mountainous terrain they say, ‘Do not be afraid,’ then when they catch up with them they kill them. By the one in whose hand is my soul, if I hear that anyone has done that I will chop off his head.”</p>
<p>It was narrated that Abu Muslimah said: “ ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab said: ‘By the One in Whose hand is my soul, if any one of you were to point to the sky [i.e., a gesture to imply that he will not harm him] to make a mushrik come down to him and then kill him, I would kill him for that.’”</p>
<p><strong>Islam has forbidden treachery, and treachery is not one of the kinds of tricks and deception that are permitted in war. </strong>This Islamic sharee’ah makes a distinction between the kinds of deceit that are permitted and that which involves treachery and breaks treaties. See al-‘Allaaqaat al-Khaarijiyyah fi Dawlat al-Khilaafah, 197. Islam Q&amp;A Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid</p></blockquote>
<p>Notice the quote from the classical Islamic scholar who clearly said:</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p>The scholars are agreed that it is permissible to deceive the kuffaar [infidels] <strong>in war</strong> in any way possible, <strong>except if that would mean breaking the terms of a treaty or trust, in which case it is not permitted.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>According to Islamic law, the status of citizenship is considered a trust.  It cannot be violated.  Therefore, it would be impermissible for a Muslim-American to violate his American citizenship.  As such, it would be completely forbidden in Islam for a Muslim-American to plot against the United States of America.  Such a person would be resurrected on the Day of Judgment with the Banner of Treachery, according to Islamic theology.</p>
<p>According to Islamic law, when a person enters a non-Muslim country using a visa, by doing so he enters into a covenant of peace with them.  It thereby becomes forbidden for such a person to plot against them, and their wealth, lives, and property are considered sacrosanct.  As the classical Islamic jurist Imam Shafi’i opined: “If he is safe from them, they should be safe from him.”  In other words, a Muslim may not plot against the non-Muslims who allowed him to enter their country.  During the lifetime of the Prophet Muhammad, a man named Mughira bin Shuba converted to Islam while living in the lands of the non-Muslims.  Upon his conversion, Mughira killed the men while they were caught unaware, and ran off with their wealth.  When Mughira fled to the lands of Islam with this wealth, the Prophet Muhammad rejected his action, calling it “treachery.”  The Prophet said: “The wealth…is obtained through treachery, and we have no need of it.”  The ultraconservative Islamic website <a href="http://www.islam-qa.com/en/ref/14367/stealing" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right"><em>Islam-qa.com</em><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> says:</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p>When a Muslim enters a kaafir country, it is as if he entering into a peaceful agreement with them – which is the visa which is given to him to enable him to enter their country – so if he takes their wealth unlawfully, then he is breaking that agreement, in addition to being a thief.</p>
<p>The wealth that he steals from them is haraam. It was narrated that al-Mugheerah ibn Shu’bah kept company with some people during the Jaahiliyyah. He killed them and took their wealth, then he came and entered Islam. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “As for your Islam, I accept it, and as for the wealth, I have nothing to do with it.” According to a report narrated by Abu Dawood, “As for your Islam, we accept it, and as for the wealth it is obtained through treachery, and we have no need of it.”</p>
<p>(Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 2583; Abu Dawood, 2765; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood, 2403)</p>
<p>Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar said:</p>
<p>The phrase “and as for the wealth, I have nothing to do with it” means, I will not touch it because it was obtained through treachery. What we learn from this is that it is not permissible to take the wealth of the kuffaar [non-Muslims] by treachery when they have trusted you and granted you safety, because when people accompany one another (when travelling), they do so on the basis of mutual trust, and that trust should not be betrayed, whether the other person is a Muslim or a kaafir…</p>
<p>Fath al-Baari, 5/341</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p>Al-Shaafa’i (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: When a Muslim enters dar al-harb (the non-Muslim lands) on peaceful terms, and finds himself in position to take something of their wealth, it is not permissible for him to take it, whether it is a little or a lot, because if he is safe from them, they should be safe from him…</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p>Al-Sarkhasi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: It is not right for a Muslim who is on peaceful terms with them to betray them, because betrayal is haraam. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Every betrayer will have a banner by his backside on the Day of Resurrection, by which his betrayal will be known.”</p>
<p>If he betrays them and steals their wealth, and brings it to the Muslim lands, it is not right for a Muslim to buy from him if he knows about that, because he has obtained it in an evil manner, and buying from him is encouraging him in that, which it is not right for the Muslim to do. The basic principle in this matter is the hadeeth of al-Mugheerah ibn Shu’bah (may Allaah be pleased with him), when he killed his companions and brought their wealth to Madeenah and became Muslim, and asked the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to take the khums of his wealth, and he said, “As for your Islam, we accept it, and as for the wealth it is obtained through treachery, and we have no need of it.”</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p>Al-Mabsoot, 10/96</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="quote-light"><p>Al-Mabsoot, 10/96</p></blockquote>
<p>It is very clear: Islam does not permit Muslim-Americans to engage in treachery against their fellow American citizens, or against the American state.  Deceit/deception is only allowed against those with whom one is at war with, not against those who “have trusted you and granted you safety.”  Muslim-Americans are granted safety and refuge in the United States, and therefore it is not permissible to betray this trust, especially not by treachery.</p>
<p>It is not even allowed to steal electricity from the government, let alone plot against it!  The <a href="http://www.islam-qa.com/en/ref/42513/stealing" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">same website<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> says:</p>
<h3>
<a name="stealing-phone-time"></a>Stealing phone time from a Kaafir [Unbeliever] State</h3>
<blockquote class="quote-light">[Question:] I decided to ask about…stolen phone time….Many people justify [stealing phone time] by saying that the government is not Muslim and is hostile towards Islam and Muslims, so we are entitled, indeed obliged, to corrupt their economy. So they regard this as permissible if the phones belong to the government.</p>
[Answer:] It is not permissible for you to transgress against the property of this government even if they are kaafirs, because they have trusted you and have allowed you to enter their land on the basis of this trust, and you have promised to respect their trust and not betray it. Simply by entering their land you have given them this covenant and promise, otherwise they would not have allowed you to enter.  The Muslim should not break his promise or covenant deceitfully or betray a trust. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>
<p>“And fulfil (every) covenant. Verily, the covenant will be questioned about”</p>
[al-Isra’ 17:34]
<p>“O you who believe! Fulfil (your) obligations”</p>
[al-Maa’idah 5:1]
<p>And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The signs of the hypocrite are three: when he speaks he lies, when he makes a promise he breaks it, and when he is entrusted with something, he betrays that trust.” Agreed upon; narrated from Abu Hurayrah. Muslim added: “… even though he prays and fasts and claims to be a Muslim.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Notice that this ultraconservative Islamic website forbids even waging “stealth economic jihad” against the United States.  Treachery is not permitted at all.  The idea, then, that Muslim-Americans are conspiring against their government, supposedly because “war is deceit/deception”, is completely bogus.  It is alarmism of the highest order.</p>
<p>Although Robert Spencer will insist on interpreting the religion of Islam for Muslims, what is known to Muslims is that the deceit/deception being referred to by the Prophet Muhammad was simply fooling the enemy that one’s troops are located at X location instead of Y.  Or to make the enemy think that the assault will come during the evening but in fact it comes at noon.  To analogize all this to World War II, the type of deception that is permitted in Islam would be the Allies’ fooling the Nazis as to where the invasion would take place.  The forbidden type, i.e. treachery, would be the Nazis’ attacking the Soviet Union in violation of their mutual pact.</p>
<p><strong>Do Robert Spencer’s Claims Sound Familiar?</strong></p>
<p>Notice the title of Robert Spencer’s chapter: “Islamic Law: Lie, Steal, and Kill.”  And he says further that Islam “sanctions lying, stealing, and killing in order to advance Islam.” <a href="http://spencerwatch.com/#F22" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><sup>[22]</sup><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> Spencer’s claims against Islam are in fact frighteningly similar to those made against Judaism by anti-Semites.  <a href="http://www.jewishresponse.com/" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Bein Yisroel Lo’amim<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, which describes itself as “a global Jewish organization with the goal of undermining the foundations of anti-Semitism that have led to so many tragedies in the past”, declares (emphasis is ours):</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p>Many anti-Semites, in their efforts to vilify the Jewish people, have focused on certain passages in the Talmud which, they claim, prove <strong>that the Talmud considers gentiles [non-Jews] less than human and permits Jews to kill, steal from and cheat gentiles.</strong> Such propaganda, supported with inaccurate, misleading and out of context quotations, has always existed, and formed the substance of many Jewish-gentiles debates over the centuries. However, today the problem is perhaps greater than ever due to the widespread accessibility of this material via the Internet.</p></blockquote>
<p>Just as anti-Semites have always claimed that Talmudic law “permits Jews to kill, steal, and cheat gentiles [non-Jews]“, so do Islamophobes like Robert Spencer claim that Islamic law “sanctions lying, stealing, and killing” against non-Muslims.  One hundred years from now people will wonder how people could have actually believed such nonsense about Islam, just as today we wonder how people could have believed such stuff about Judaism. And let’s be clear: the anti-Semites bring forth their “proof” just as Islamophobes do.  anti-Semites quote extensively from the Talmud, the most authoritative book of Judaism.  For example, one <a href="http://www.revisionisthistory.org/talmudtruth.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">anti-Semitic website<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> cites the following proof from the Talmud:</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p><strong>Hitting a Jew is the same as hitting God</strong></p>
<p>Sanhedrin 58b. If a heathen (gentile) hits a Jew, the gentile must be killed.</p>
<p><strong>O.K. to Cheat Non-Jews</strong></p>
<p>Sanhedrin 57a . A Jew need not pay a gentile (“Cuthean”) the wages owed him for work.</p>
<p><strong>Jews Have Superior Legal Status </strong></p>
<p>Baba Kamma 37b. “If an ox of an Israelite gores an ox of a Canaanite there is no liability; but if an ox of a Canaanite gores an ox of an Israelite…the payment is to be in full.”</p>
<p><strong>Jews May Steal from Non-Jews</strong></p>
<p>Baba Mezia 24a . If a Jew finds an object lost by a gentile (“heathen”) it does not have to be returned. (Affirmed also in Baba Kamma 113b).</p>
<p>Sanhedrin 76a. God will not spare a Jew who “marries his daughter to an old man or takes a wife for his infant son or returns a lost article to a Cuthean…”</p>
<p><strong>Jews May Rob and Kill Non-Jews</strong></p>
<p>Sanhedrin 57a . When a Jew murders a gentile (“Cuthean”), there will be no death penalty. What a Jew steals from a gentile he may keep. Baba Kamma 37b. The gentiles are outside the protection of the law and God has “exposed their money to Israel.”</p>
<p><strong>Jews May Lie to Non-Jews</strong></p>

<p>In fact, just Google the words “Judaism cheat Gentiles”, “Talmud cheat Gentiles”, and similar such search phrases, and you will find dozens of anti-Semitic websites.  In reality, they look no different than the sites geared against Islam.  Just replace “Judaism” with “Islam” and “Talmud” with “Quran.”  The anti-Semitic site I quoted above places a disclaimer that they are not racists, just as Robert Spencer always has to clarify that he opposes white supremacists who use his material.  The <a href="http://www.revisionisthistory.org/talmudtruth.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">anti-Semitic site<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> reads, in a very Jihad Watch sort of way:</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p>The racist, white supremacist “Stormfront” organization has illegally appropriated this Talmud articles against our wishes and without our permissible.  (Legal action has been initiated and litigation is pending).  We are opposed to all forms of racism, whether “white Aryan” or rabbinic.</p></blockquote>
<p>Those of you who follow Robert Spencer’s site will realize the similarities, even to the laughable “legal action has been initiated…”  (What ever happened to Spencer’s supposed litigation against whoever registered <a href="http://www.loonwatch.com/2009/11/loonwatch-exclusive-robert-spencers-fkallahcom-fkislamcom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">FuckIslam.com<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> and redirected to his site?  I guess most court systems do not permit people to sue their own selves.)</p>
<p>Notice the similarity between the title of the anti-Semitic article, <em>Truth about the Talmud: Racist, Rabbinic Hate Literature</em>, and Robert Spencer’s <em>Truth about Muhammad: Founder of the World’s Most Intolerant Religion</em>. Likewise, Jihad Watch claims Robert Spencer is “the acclaimed scholar of Islam”, just as the anti-Semitic website claims that the author of the article is the “foremost scholar of Judaism in the English-speaking world.” The anti-Semitic site is a bit more modest, in that it constrains it to “the English-speaking world” only!</p>
<p>The anti-Semitic site goes on to say that they are not racists, since Judaism is a religion not  a race.  Sound familiar?  It’s exactly what the Islamophobes say to justify their bigotry towards Islam.  And if they are pushed more, they might say they are only opposed to “radical Islam” just as the anti-Semitic site will claim that it is only opposed to “rabbinical Judaism.”  The fact that the Islamophobic rhetoric is so similar to anti-Semitic propaganda is worrisome indeed.</p>
<p>Ironically, Robert Spencer’s books against Islam read very similar to anti-Christian books as well. For example, Spencer has penned a book entitled<em> The Complete Infidel’s Guide to the Koran</em>, a title remarkably similar to T. Joyner Drolsum’s anti-Christian work entitled <em>Unholy Writ: An Infidel’s Critique of the Bible</em>.  Spencer entitles chapter 6 of his book “Islamic Law: Lie, Steal, and Kill.”  How remarkably similar is this title to Drolsum’s section heading of “Biblically Sanctioned Lying, Killing, and Stealing”, the only difference being in the order of the words!  Drolsum argues that “there are numerous instances in the bible” of lying, killing, stealing, “often with God’s blessing”, which “appear to be something of a divinely sanctioned double standard” between believers and unbelievers.  He goes on to say that “God promotes killing elsewhere in the bible and is often directly involved in it” and that “Paul and others are willing to lie a little to further God’s truth (Rom 3:7; 2 Cor. 12:16). <a href="http://spencerwatch.com/#F23" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><sup>[23]</sup><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>Although I will refrain from commenting on the alleged “double standard” of the God of the Bible, I will certainly comment on the double standard of Robert Spencer:  how many times will I hammer him with his inconsistencies?  How many times will he be caught sparing no stone when it comes to Islam, while found living in the flimsiest of glass houses himself?</p>
<h3><a name="Lying-about-the-religion"></a>Lying about the Religion</h3>
<p>Robert Spencer claims that Muslims are permitted to lie about their religion. Hence, Muslim-American spokesmen will come on television and routinely lie about Islam, according to Spencer.  However, the truth is that it is Spencer who is lying, and no such belief exists in the Islamic religion.  There are, as we have seen, only three permitted instances of lying, and this is not one of them.</p>
<p>In fact, lying about the religion is considered more heinous than a regular lie, and constitutes an act of disbelief (kufr).  It is classified as a “lie against God and His Messenger”, and leads straight to Hell.  For example, a Muslim is not permitted to say to a non-Muslim that beer is permitted in Islam, even if he wishes by this to entice the person to Islam.  Not only is this not acceptable, but such a Muslim would be considered an apostate from the religion, because he lied about Islam (which is considered a lie against God and His Messenger).  Similarly, a Muslim who denies that jihad is an active part of Islam is considered an apostate, which is why mainstream Muslims expelled Ahmadis/Qadianis from Islam.  (I will write an article on the topic of jihad in the future, and in that I will explain that jihad does not mean what many people think it does.)</p>
<p>There is not a single instance in the life of the Prophet Muhammad in which he lied about Islam or allowed anyone else to do that.  Spencer’s claim–that Islam permits lying about the religion to further it–is complete fabrication.  It is Spencer who is lying when he claims that Islam allows for lying about the religion.  The reality is the exact opposite: lying about the religion is completely forbidden.  This is why many Muslims are cautious about giving religious rulings, for fear that they mistakenly say something about Islam that is not really true.  If this is their attitude with simple mistakes, one can imagine the opposition to intentional lying.  The burden of proof is on Spencer to prove otherwise.</p>
<h3><a name="Lying-further-religion"></a>Lying to Further the Religion</h3>
<p>Closely linked to the above claim is the idea, furthered by Robert Spencer, that Muslims are allowed to lie in order to “further the religion of Islam.”  This is, once again, a fanciful argument.  There is no proof whatsoever that Muslims are allowed to do this.  The burden of proof is on Spencer to provide a verse from the Quran or Prophetic tradition in which this is allowed.</p>
<p>What kind of vile religion would permit lying in order to further the religion, wonders an incredulous Spencer.  The gentleman doth protest too much.  Although some Christian theologians were staunchly against all lies, other major Christian thinkers were less particular about it, especially if it would further the interests of the church.  <a href="http://www.jlaw.com/Articles/hf_LyingPermissible.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Martin Luther<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, the founder of Protestant Christianity, felt that “lying for the sake of the Christian church would not be a sin.”  Luther wondered:</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p>What harm would it do, if a man told a good strong lie for the sake of the good and for the Christian church…a useful lie, a helpful lie, such lies that would not be against God… <a href="http://spencerwatch.com/#F24" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><sup>[24]</sup><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p></blockquote>
<p>Can one imagine Spencer’s reaction if an Islamic text said that “lying for the sake of the Islamic religion would not be a sin”?  But for some reason, this statement–ascribed to the founder of Protestantism–does not find Spencer’s ire.</p>
<p>And what about Spencer’s own Catholicism?  <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09469a.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">The Catholic Encyclopedia<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> writes that “St. John Chrysostom held that it is lawful to deceive others for their benefit, and Cassian taught that we may sometimes lie as we take medicine, driven to it by sheer necessity.”  So would “deceiving others” to bring them to Christ be considered “for their benefit”?</p>
<p>The gentleman doth protest too much methinks!</p>
<h3><a name="Taqiyya-and-Kitman"></a>Taqiyya and Kitman</h3>
<p>One of the favorite buzz words of Islamophobes is “taqiyya!”  They translate it to mean “holy lying” (alternatively as “holy hypocrisy” or “religious deception”) and say that it is a central tenet of Islam that Muslims are allowed to lie to non-Muslims.  When moderate Muslim spokesmen declare Islam to be a religion of peace, Islamophobes like Robert Spencer will accuse these Muslims of “taqiyya!”  Spencer explains in his book:</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p>The doctrines of religious deception (taqiyya and kitman) are most often identified with Shi’ite Islam and are ostensibly rejected by Sunnis (over 85 percent of Muslims worldwide) because they were sanctioned by the Prophet.  However, they can still be found in traditions that Sunni Muslims consider most reliable…When Shi’ite Muslims were persecuted by Sunnis, they developed the doctrine of taqiyya, or concealment…</p>
<p>Closely related to this is the doctrine of kitman, or mental reservation, which is telling the truth, but not the whole truth, with an intention to mislead.  Sunnis have also practiced them throughout Islamic history, because of their Qur’anic foundation.  Ibn Kathir, who was no Shi’ite, explains that “the scholars agreed that if a person is forced into disbelief, it is permissible for him to either go along with them in the interests of self-preservation, or to refuse.” <a href="http://spencerwatch.com/#F25" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><sup>[25]</sup><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p></blockquote>
<p>Taqiyya is a doctrine that developed in Shi’ism, exactly for the reason that Spencer stated, namely persecution at the hands of the majority Sunnis.  Based on this belief, Shi’ites could pretend to be Sunnis in order to avoid torture and death.  In other words, if a Sunni tyrant threatened to kill a Shi’ite, that Shi’ite could claim to be a pious Sunni and thereby save his life.  Although it is a Shi’ite-specific doctrine, it is true that there is some justification for such a belief in Sunni canonical sources.  In fact, Robert Spencer himself quotes the relevant Quranic verse, namely 16:106, which reads:</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p>Anyone who, after having once accepted faith in God, verbally renounces his faith and of his own accord opens his heart to unbelief, on such falls the condemnation of God, and a tremendous penalty awaits such.  This, to be sure, does not apply to those who do it under duress if their hearts are full of faith. (Quran, 16:106)</p></blockquote>
<p>If we read <em>Azbab ul-Nuzul</em> (<em>The Reasons for Revelation</em>), we find the context of this verse:</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p>Said Ibn ‘Abbas said: “This verse was revealed about Ammar ibn Yasir. The idolaters had taken him away along with his father Yasir, his mother Sumayyah, [etc.]…and tortured them. As for Sumayyah, she was tied up between two camels and stabbed with a spear in her female organ…[and] killed. Her husband Yasir was also killed…As for ‘Ammar, he was coerced to let them hear what they wanted to hear [i.e. renunciation of Islam]. God’s Messenger was told that Ammar has renounced faith, but he said: ‘Never, Ammar is filled with faith from his head to his toes; faith is admixed with his flesh and blood!’ Ammar then went to see God’s Messenger, crying.  God’s Messenger used his hands to wipe Ammar’s tears, and said: ‘If they return to you, let them hear again what you told them’. Then Almighty God revealed this verse [16:1o6].”</p>
<p>Mujahid said: “This verse was revealed about some Meccans who accepted faith [i.e. Islam]… The Quraysh caught up with them…and coerced them to renounce their faith. It is about them that this verse was revealed.”</p></blockquote>
<p>It amazes me that Robert Spencer would take any issue with this.  If Al-Qaeda captured some Christian missionaries and threatened to kill them unless they declare belief in Islam, would any sane person take issue with a feigned confession?  Even U.S. law takes into account acts done under duress.</p>
<p>This, i.e. renouncing Islam under duress, is the only application of “taqiyya” that exists in Sunni Islam, which 85% of Muslims follow.  Virtually all Shi’ites believe in a similar restriction of taqiyya.  Did some fringe Shi’ite sects of the past develop the doctrine of Taqiyya more elaborately?  I honestly don’t know because I haven’t studied such a topic (and neither has Robert Spencer).  I <em>have </em>read accusations by Sunnis against Shi’ism that say so (and Robert Spencer often reproduces these charges), but excuse me if I take that with a grain of salt.  It’s a bit like taking information about Catholicism from a fundamentalist Evangelical Protestant. But in any case, what is 1,000% certain is that Sunni Muslims do not believe in any other application of taqiyya except renouncing Islam under duress, i.e. torture and death.</p>
<p>Once again, we find Robert Spencer throwing stones from his glass house.  “Taqiyya” is permitted in the Judeo-Christian tradition itself.  Although there is some debate wether renouncing one’s faith is permitted or not, Judaism permits lying to save one’s own life. <a href="http://www.jlaw.com/Articles/hf_LyingPermissible.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">JLaw.com<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, a website dedicated to expounding Jewish law, declares:</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p>There is no question that Jewish law obligates one to prevaricate in order to save one’s own life or the life of another person.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.myjewishlearning.com/beliefs/Issues/War_and_Peace/Combat_and_Conflict/Types_of_War/Nuclear_War.shtml" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Rabbi Michael Broyde<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> writes:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.myjewishlearning.com/practices/Ethics/Talk_and_Gossip/Types_of_Speech/Truth_and_Lies/When_Life_is_at_Stake.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Rabbi Joseph Telushkin<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> writes:</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p>Jewish law condemns as foolish and immoral both telling the truth to an evil person and thereby enabling him to go on doing evil, or telling the truth to an evil person that leads to your [own] murder.</p></blockquote>
<p>And he says further:</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p>We are permitted to lie, or otherwise deceive, unscrupulous people even if we only suspect that our lives may be in danger. <a href="http://spencerwatch.com/#F26" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><sup>[26]</sup><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p></blockquote>
<p>The Christian tradition has generally been less tolerant towards lying, as Rabbi Telushkin explains:</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p>Some of the greatest figures in Christian theology and Western thought have argued that lying is always wrong, even when life is at stake. Saint Augustine, the great fourth-century Church Father (in his treatise “On Lying”) argued that lying bars one from eternal life; hence, it makes no sense to give up one’s place in the next world to save another life if it means having to lie: “Does he not speak most perversely who says that one person ought to die spiritually, so another may live? …Since, then, eternal life is lost by lying, a lie may never be told for the preservation of the temporal life of another.”</p>
<p>Some fifteen hundred years after Saint Augustine, Immanuel Kant, in an effort to establish a universally binding secular ethic, also condemned all lying, whatever the circumstances. Thus, Kant taught (in his <em>Critique of Practical Reason</em>) that if a man fleeing for his life is hiding in our house, and the would-be murderer asks whether “our friend who is pursued by him has taken refuge in our house,” we are forbidden to lie or mislead him.</p></blockquote>
<p>The <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10195b.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Catholic Encyclopedia<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> expounds:</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p>According to the common Catholic teaching it is never allowable to tell a lie, not even to save human life.</p></blockquote>
<p>The stricter Christian position can be partially explained by the fact that after the rise of Augustine the Christians were never generally faced with a situation like the Inquisition.  In other words, they had the convenience of theorizing about the greatness of martyrs, without facing the fear of having their religion being wiped off the face of the earth by those in power.  (Contrary to the misconception harbored by Islamophobes, the Christians under Islamic law were generally never forced to convert en mass to Islam as Jews and Muslims were in many parts of Christendom.)</p>
<p>After World War II, this absolutist position against lying became less tenable.  The question arose: was it permissible to lie to Nazi stormtroopers when they ask you “are you hiding any Jews in your attic?” Should we now berate Robert Spencer’s Catholic faith, and say that it is his faith that is responsible for the killing of so many Jews during the Holocaust? Should we impugn his entire faith for the lackluster response of the Catholic church to the plight of Jews during this period of intense persecution?</p>
<p>In any case, many Christians now believe that lying to save life is generally permitted. Christian professor <a href="http://michaelsheiser.com/TheNakedBible/2010/03/does-god-lie/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Dr. Michael Heiser<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> includes the question “Are you hiding Jews in your attic?” as one of those instances in which it is permitted to lie.  Surely this is the more sensible position.  If the church permitted lying to further Christianity, as Martin Luther and others believed, then surely it would be permitted to lie to save life.</p>
<p><a href="http://ericsammons.com/blog/2010/03/25/can-we-lie-to-save-lives/" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Eric Sammons<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, a Catholic speaker and head of evangelization at St. John Neumann parish, writes (emphasis is ours):</p>
<h3><a name="save-life"></a>Can we lie to save lives?</h3>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p><strong>Can we lie to save lives?</strong></p>
<p>One of the classic moral dilemmas of the 20th century was the case of hiding Jews during Nazi Germany. If a Nazi officer comes to the door asking if any Jews are in the house, are you morally permitted to lie to the officer in order to protect the lives of those Jews hiding within? …The answer is that telling an untruth in such a situation <em>is not a lie</em>, and therefore<strong> it can be moral to be deceptive in such situations…</strong>So we cannot “lie” to save a life, but we can tell an untruth if necessary, but in doing so, that is not a lie.</p></blockquote>
<p>Similarly, Islamic jurists discussed and debated this situation.  Their rulings are remarkably similar to Jewish and Christian opinions on the matter.  George F. Hourani discusses how Islamic jurists of one theological school argued that lying was permitted in such a case, whereas another argued “one can always escape from such a dilemma by insinuations or silence…[instead of] a direct lie.” <a href="http://spencerwatch.com/#F27" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><sup>[27]</sup><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> An application of this came during World War II, when for example<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Grand-Mosque-Paris-Muslims-Holocaust/dp/0823421597" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right"> a French mosque<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> hid and saved almost two thousand Jews from their Nazi tormentors.  Is this the <em>kitman </em>(i.e. “mental reservation” or “half-truths”) that Spencer so opposes?</p>
<p>All three Abrahamic traditions (Judaism, Christianity, and Islam) discussed the hypothetical situation in which hoodlums–bent on murdering a man hiding inside your house–knock on your door and ask if that man is inside.  The Jewish tradition, as we have seen, is unequivocal in the fact that in this case lying is permitted. As for Christianity, the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10195b.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Catholic Encyclopedia<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> says (emphasis is ours):</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p>According to the common Catholic teaching it is never allowable to tell a lie, not even to save human life. A lie is something intrinsically evil, and as evil may not be done that good may come of it, we are never allowed to tell a lie. However, we are also under an obligation to keep secrets faithfully, and sometimes the easiest way of fulfilling that duty is to say what is false, or to tell a lie. Writers of all creeds and of none, both ancient and modern, have frankly accepted this position. They admit the doctrine of the lie of necessity, and maintain that when there is a conflict between justice and veracity it is justice that should prevail. The common Catholic teaching has formulated <strong>the theory of mental reservation</strong> as a means by which the claims of both justice and veracity can be satisfied.</p></blockquote>
<p>The entry goes on to talk about the Catholic doctrine of “mental reservation”.  If, for example, hoodlums demand to know if a man is hiding inside your home, it is permissible to deceive them using mental reservation:</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p>Such expressions as “He is not at home” were called <em>equivocations</em>, or <em>amphibologies</em>, and when there was good reason for using them their lawfulness was admitted by all. If the person inquired for was really at home, but did not wish to see the visitor, the meaning of the phrase “He is not at home” was restricted by the mind of the speaker to this sense, “He is not at home for you, or to see you.” Hence equivocations and amphibologies came to be called mental restrictions or reservations…</p>
<p>All Catholic writers were, and are, agreed that when there is good reason, such expressions as the above may be made use of, and that they are not lies. Those who hear them may understand them in a sense which is not true, but their self-deception may be permitted by the speaker for a good reason.</p></blockquote>
<p>Deception using “mental reservation” is therefore permitted in Catholicism, if for “a good reason.”  What’s quite surprising is that this is in fact the exact same belief in Shi’ism that Robert Spencer takes offense to, namely <em>kitman</em>.  Let’s recall Spencer’s own definition of kitman, as follows:</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p><em>Closely related to this [i.e. taqiyya] is the doctrine of kitman, or mental reservation, which is telling the truth, but not the whole truth, with an intention to mislead. </em> <a href="http://spencerwatch.com/#F28" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><sup>[28]</sup><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p></blockquote>
<p>What is truly mind-boggling is that Robert Spencer takes offense to kitman <em>which he himself translates as “mental reservation” </em>when in fact his own religious creed believes in mental reservation!  Spencer didn’t even choose to translate the word kitman differently! To reiterate: Spencer opposes Shi’ite Islam’s belief in mental reservation, but either ignores or is oblivious to the Catholic doctrine in support of mental reservation!  This is truly amazing, and really makes me think that Spencer seriously thought nobody would challenge his writing. His own religious doctrine sanctions the use of kitman if there is “a good reason” to use it.</p>
<p>When the Nazis rounded up Jews, many Jews claimed to be Christians in order to save themselves and their children.  This is “taqiyya” in every sense of the word.  (The word “taqiyya” is properly translated to “religious dissimulation” and is accepted in Judaism as it is in Shi’ism.)  Would Robert Spencer like to condemn these Jews for engaging in taqiyya?  As we can see, taqiyya and kitman are both found in the Judeo-Christian tradition.</p>
<p>Of course, the reality is that most Muslims have never even heard of the words “taqiyya” or “kitman” until Islamophobes bring them up.  Usually what happens is that an Islamophobe will mention these words, and then the bewildered Muslim will have to go look up the meaning of these words, usually finding definitions on an Islamophobic website.  Taqiyya and kitman are obscure words that were only found in any real significance in old Shi’ite texts, mostly in regards to situations of mass religious persecution.  Today, these two words have fallen into utter disuse and are only invoked by Islamophobes.  Contrary to the claims made by Robert Spencer and co., taqiyya and kitman do not form a fundamental part of Islam.  Rather, these are two doctrines that have fallen into disuse and obscurity, and were in fact never developed doctrines in mainstream Islam.</p>
<h3><a name="Showing-friendship-to-disbelievers"></a>Showing friendship to disbelievers Outwardly but not Inwardly?</h3>
<p>In the same chapter of his book, Robert Spencer quotes verse 3:28 in the Quran, which reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p>Let not the believers take the disbelievers for <em>awliya </em>(friends) rather than believers; and whoever does this God will have nothing to do with him, except by way of precaution when you fear them. (Quran, 3:28)</p></blockquote>
<p>Spencer follows this verse by saying:</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p>Remember that the next time you see a Muslim [American] spokesman on television professing his friendship with non-Muslim Americans and his loyalty to the United States. <a href="http://spencerwatch.com/#F29" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><sup>[29]</sup><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p></blockquote>
<p>In this manner, Spencer uses verse 3:28 to support his xenophobic conspiracy theory: Muslim-Americans, especially their nefarious spokesmen, are just professing loyalty to the United States (“taqiyya!”) but in reality plotting to overthrow Western democracy to replace it with Islamist Sharia.  This is the basis for his alarmist claim that Muslim-American organizations are involved in “stealth jihad.” His claim seems outlandish at first, but he convinces his audience by pointing to the verse above, which says that you can only take non-Muslims as friends “by way of precaution”, i.e. taqiyya.  Spencer then quotes the <em>tafsir </em>(commentary) of this verse, written by Ibn Kathir, a prominent medieval jurist.  Spencer explains verse 3:28 as follows:</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p>In other words, don’t make friends with unbelievers except to “guard yourselves from them”: Pretend to be their friends so that you can strengthen yourself against them.  The distinguished Qur’anic commentator Ibn Kathir explains that, in this verse, “Allah prohibited His believing servants from becoming supporters of the disbelievers, or to take them as comrades with whom they develop friendships, rather than the believers.”  However, exempted from this rule were “those believers who in some areas or times fear for their safety from the disbelievers.  In this case, such believers are allowed to show friendship to the disbelievers outwardly, but never inwardly.”</p></blockquote>
<p>In fact, Ibn Kathir goes on to say:</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p>Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Ad-Darda’ said, “We smile in the face of some people although our hearts curse them.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Based on this, the Islamophobes argue that the Muslim-Americans, especially those pesky spokesmen, are smiling at our faces while their hearts curse us!  It’s right there in the Quran and the classical commentary of the Quran!</p>
<p>Case closed?  Not really.  A closer analysis of verse 3:28 gives another picture.  While it is true that many fundamentalist Muslims believe it is forbidden to become friends with non-Muslims, moderate Muslims believe the term <em>awliya </em>does not properly translate to “friends.”  Rather, the Arabic term <em>awliya </em>refers to a <em>specific </em>type of friendship, an <em>unequal friendship</em> to be exact.  It refers to a relationship wherein a Muslim is considered an inferior, receiving protection from the non-Muslim; in particular, the Muslim is at the mercy of the non-Muslim.  A better translation of the word <em>awliya </em>would be “protecting friends”, or simply “patrons.”  There is abundant proof for this, but to do the topic justice I will write another article on it in the near future.</p>
<p>Suffice to say, there are very <a href="http://www.gotquestions.org/friendships-unbelievers.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">similar verses in the Bible<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> that seem to say that a Christian should not be friends with infidels.  In particular, <strong>2 Corinthians 6:14</strong> forbids being friends with infidels, i.e. “do not be yoked with unbelievers”, but many Christians understand it to mean “do not be <em>unequally </em>yoked with unbelievers”, very similar to how Muslims view 3:28 as referring to <em>unequal </em>friendships.</p>
<p>The prohibition of taking disbelievers as <em>awliya </em>is repeated in verse 60:1, wherein God says:</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p>O you who believer, do not take My enemies–who are your enemies as well–as your <em>awliya</em>–offering them your love, even though they have rejected the Truth that has come to you, and have on the contrary driven out the Prophet and yourselves from your homes, simply because you believe in your Lord God!  (Quran, 60:1)</p></blockquote>
<p>Just a few lines down, God clarifies that He is only talking about those disbelievers who oppress the Muslims by fighting them for their faith and driving the Muslims out of their homes:</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p>As for those disbelievers who do not fight against you on account of your faith, and who do not expel you from your homelands, God does not forbid you to show them kindness and equity, for verily God loves the equitable!  God only forbids you from taking as <em>awliya </em>(protecting friends) those who fight you for your faith, and who drive you out of your homes and support others in driving you out.  Those who seek their protection are indeed wrongdoers.  (Quran, 60:8-9)</p></blockquote>
<p>We see here quite clearly how the Islamophobes take verses out of context, reproducing the first part but not the second part which explains that the Quran is only referring to those disbelievers who oppress the Muslims.  Even if we–for argument’s sake–accept the definition of awliya as simply “friends”, the Quranic verse would only prohibit taking those disbelievers as friends who oppress the Muslims…not <em>all </em>non-Muslims.</p>
<p>Furthermore, 3:28 was revealed in a certain context: the Prophet Muhammad had begun preaching his new religion in Mecca, his birthplace.  The pagans of Mecca oppressed and tortured his followers.  As has been discussed earlier, the Prophet Muhammad gave permission to some of the weaker and more vulnerable converts to pretend to renounce their faith in order to avoid being tortured and killed.  (This developed into the Shi’ite doctrine of taqiyya.)  Eventually, the persecution reached such a level that the Prophet ordered his followers to flee to the city of Yathrib (Medina), an event that came to be known as the <em>Hijra</em> (Emigration).  However, some of the early Muslims were too weak to travel and/or were prevented from leaving by the pagans of Mecca.  It was these that were permitted to use “taqiyya” to save their lives.</p>
<p>The pagans of Mecca threatened to destroy the city-state of Medina, and with it the religion of Islam.  They established a network of spies in Medina, by reaching out to some of the non-Muslims of Medina as well as some of the Muslims weak in faith.  The looming threat of a pagan conquest of Medina caused many of the weaker willed Muslims to lose their faith in the Prophet; many of them sought the protection of the Meccan pagans.   It was <em>these </em>Muslims that the Quran was calling out in verse 3:28 and 60:1, urging the Muslims not to “take the disbelievers (i.e. the pagans plotting to overthrow Medina) for <em>awliya </em>(protecting friends) rather than believers (the Prophet and the defenders of Medina).”</p>
<p>The words “except by way of precaution when you fear them” was referring to those Muslims left behind in Mecca, reassuring them that they were not to be faulted for trying to save their lives (from torture and death) by using “taqiyya.”  However, a key point here is that the Muslims of Mecca were commanded to flee to Medina, and whoever did not do so was considered sinful, <em>except those physically incapable of doing so</em>.  The Quran says:</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p>When the angels collect the souls of those who die in sin against themselves (because they did not emigrate from Mecca), the angels will ask: “What was wrong with you?”  The people will answer: “We were too weak on earth.”  The angels will say: “Was God’s earth not spacious enough for you to migrate to some other place?”  For such the goal is Hell, what an evil refuge!  Except those who are truly weak and prevented by the oppressors, those men, women, and children who have no means in their power to emigrate.  For these, there is hope that God will forgive them: for God blots out sins and forgives again and again.  He who forsakes his home in the Cause of God finds the earth wide and spacious, with many places of refuge.  Should he die as a refugee from his home, his reward from God is sure.  God is Most Forgiving and Most Merciful.  (Quran, 4:97-100)</p></blockquote>
<p>Clearly, it is not appropriate to analogize the circumstance in verse 3:28 to the situation of Muslim-Americans today.  Unlike the Muslims of pagan Mecca who were tortured and killed if they professed their faith in Islam, Muslim-Americans have freedom of religion.  The state will not kill Muslim-Americans for being Muslim.  Yes, if Muslim-Americans are ever rounded up and sent to concentration camps, as some of the Islamophobes so desire, then in that situation a Muslim-American could use taqiyya to deny that he is a Muslim.  But what relevance is taqiyya when their lives are not at stake?  Even the verse that Spencer himself quotes, verse 3:28, says “except by way of precaution<em> when you fear them</em>.”  Do Muslim-Americans fear for their lives?  Spencer doesn’t even believe that Islamophobia is real, let alone the idea that Muslim-Americans fear for their lives due to their profession of faith, so how does this verse apply at all?</p>
<p>It would only apply to a situation such as the Inquisition in Spain.  And even in this case, the first option would <em>not </em>be taqiyya.  Rather, the Muslims would be commanded to emigrate to another place, such as to the Muslim majority world, wherein they could freely practice their religion.  Any Muslim who willingly stayed behind in Spain and pretended to become Christian would be considered sinful (and go to Hell!).  God would only forgive those Muslims who were physically incapable of leaving Spain, due to handicap or prevention by the Spanish authorities.  Therefore, we see that taqiyya is a last case option, and only when there is no other choice.  Even if a Muslim-American felt like he was tortured or killed for his faith in the United States, he would still have the option of migrating to another country.  Taqiyya would simply not be an option, and anyone who resorted to that would be considered sinful and Hell-bound.</p>
<p>Furthermore, taqiyya has nothing to do with lying about Islam, or lying to further one’s religion.  Rather, taqiyya simply means <em>lying about one’s own faith, denying one’s Muslim identity</em> in order to save one’s life.  So how does it make sense for Robert Spencer and co. to claim that Muslim-American spokesmen are “doing taqiyya”?  Those spokesmen are not only boldly claiming their Muslim-ness, but they are claiming to be the spokesmen of Muslims!  Surely, Spencer should only accuse non-Muslims of taqiyya; for example, nutty Spencer has alluded to the fact that <a href="http://www.loonwatch.com/2010/05/robert-spencer-watch-obama-may-be-a-mooslim/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">President Obama may be a Muslim doing taqiyya<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>.  But even that doesn’t make sense, since it is not as if Obama would be killed if he openly stated he was Muslim!</p>
<p>The reality is that Robert Spencer et al. throw around the word “taqiyya” with little care for its actual meaning.  It’s an attempt to prey on the ignorance of the masses, who have no idea what the word means.  It is quite sloppy rhetoric, with no real substantive value.</p>
<h3><a name="Kol-Nidre"></a>Kol Nidre</h3>
<p>If Robert Spencer vilifies Islam because of the concept of taqiyya, then let him also vilify Judaism for the belief in <em>Kol Nidre</em>. This is a prayer said by Jews every year on Yom Kippur, which reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p>All vows and oaths, all promises and obligations, all renunciations and responses, that we shall make from this Yom Kippur till the next–may it come to us in peace–all of them we retract. May we be absolved of them all, may we be released from them all, may they all be null and void, may they all be of no effect. May these vows not be vows, may these oaths not be oaths, may these responses not be responses.</p></blockquote>
<p>Anti-Semites have used this Jewish prayer to vilify Judaism, arguing that it exonerates Jews from all truth-telling to Gentiles (non-Jews): all vows, oaths, promises, and obligations to infidels–for the entire year–can be broken.  Just imagine, simply imagine, if this prayer was an Islamic one!  Imagine the reaction of Robert Spencer!</p>
<p>Jewish apologists argue, quite rightfully, that this prayer was historically used in a time of great persecution, and must therefore be understood in that context: Christian authorities were forcing Jews to take oaths against their own faith.  But an anti-Semite would not care for such details, and still rejoice in the fact that “Judaism allows its adherents to lie to infidels!”  How is Spencer’s argument against Islam any different?  If anything, due to the seemingly explicit text of the Kol Nidre, a stronger argument could be made against Judaism’s Kol Nidre than Shi’te Islam’s taqiyya.</p>
<p>Benjamin Sarlin of <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2009-02-24/the-anti-islam-film-everyones-talking-about/p/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">The Daily Beast<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> noted the marked similarity between the Islamophobic taqiyya line of argument with the Kol Nidre tool used by anti-Semites:</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p>“Have you heard of ‘<em>taqiyya</em>?’” [Geert] Wilders said, referring to a provision in Islamic law in which believers can conceal their faith in order to escape physical harm and persecution. “<em>Taqiyya </em>means Muslims can lie. They are even rewarded to lie, and they should lie. I’m not saying all do, but most of the time it’s Muslims living under non-Muslim rule in non-Muslim countries. <em>Taqiyya </em>means that they can fool and lie and are allowed, even have incentive, to lie until they become stronger and change their tune.”</p>
<p>The explanation bore a creeping resemblance to anti-Semites’ historic use of the Kol Nidre prayer on Yom Kippur, in which religious oaths made before God are declared void, to inaccurately claim that Jews had carte blanche to lie.</p></blockquote>
<p>The white supremacist website <a href="http://whiterevolution.com/?p%3D1315" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">WhiteRevolution.com<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> boasts an article entitled <a href="http://whiterevolution.com/?p%3D1315" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Kol Nidre: Judaism’s License to Lie<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>.  How remarkably similar is this to an Islamophobic website entitled <a href="http://greathindu.com/2009/06/hindus-beware-taqiyya-is-the-islamic-licence-to-lie/" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Taqiyya is Islamic license to lie<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>.  The racist white supremacist website explains what Kol Nidre is, and then asks the readers: “Can you trust your Jewish Congressman?”  (I’ll give you one guess as to what the answer is!)  And once again, quite similarly, we find that Islamophobes–such as <a href="http://amboytimes.typepad.com/the_amboy_times/2006/12/keith_ellison_t.html" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">this website<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> that links back to Spencer’s Jihad Watch–asks about a Muslim Congressman: “Will he be allowed to practice taqiyya?”</p>
<p>If a Jewish person says that he doesn’t believe in Kol Nidre–at least not in the way the anti-Semite claims–then the anti-Semite nullifies this by saying that the Jew is just lying (and will be forgiven because of Kol Nidre).  Likewise, if a Muslim claims that he doesn’t believe in taqiyya–at least not in the way that the Islamophobe claims–then this will be nullified by saying that the Muslim is just lying (and using taqiyya).</p>
<p>An <a href="http://radioislam.org/judaism/satank3.htm" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">anti-Semite<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> asks “How can a Jew take an oath of loyalty to America, when he is allowed by his religion to lie and disregard this oath if it benefits him or his people?”  Likewise, Robert Spencer’s <a href="http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q%3Dcache:WV6qnkXengYJ:www.jihadwatch.org/2009/08/fitzgerald-salam-al-marayati-loyalty-and-patriotism.html+http://www.jihadwatch.org/2009/08/fitzgerald-salam-al-marayati-loyalty-and-patriotism.html%26cd%3D1%26hl%3Den%26ct%3Dclnk%26gl%3Dus" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Jihad Watch<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> argues that a Muslim-American taking an oath of loyalty to America is “the purest taqiyya, or kitman, or combination of both…” and that such “an oath, given to an Infidel polity” is invalid in Islam.</p>
<p>If we were to use the tactics of Robert Spencer against any other religion, including Judaism and Christianity, we could fill pages and pages with alarmist accusations.  For example, in his book entitled <em>A Code of Jewish Ethics</em> Rabbi Telushkin lists over thirty different instances in which a Jew is permitted to lie.  If Islam is to be considered a “lying religion” for permitting three instances of lying, then what can be said of a religion that permits 30+ instances of lying?  Rabbi Telushkin says that one of those instances of “permitted lying” in the Bible was with regard to lying to idolaters in order to kill them for their idolatry:</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p>Jewish law normally opposes “sting operations” in which police or other government officials lie and attempt to bribe or otherwise induce a person to commit a crime…However, the Bible does record a “sting operation” that was set up to catch only those who were engaging in behavior that Judaism regards as abhorrent: idolatry.  Fifty-one of the Torah’s 613 commandments oppose idol worship.  During a spread of such worship in ancient Israel–a veritable life-and-death struggle betwene the God of Israel and the god Baal–King Jehu pretended to be a follower of Baal (as his father, Ahab, had been).  The king then invited the priests of Baal to a large religious gathering.  When they arrived, the Bible reports, “Jehu acted with guile in order to exterminate the worshippers of Baal” (II Kings 10:18-19). <a href="http://spencerwatch.com/#F30" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><sup>[30]</sup><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p></blockquote>
<p>Can one imagine the reaction of Robert Spencer and co. if it had been an Islamic cleric that cited the Quran to claim that it is permitted to lie to infidels in order to kill them?</p>
<p><strong>Spencer Tries to Slip Another Lie into His Work</strong></p>
<p>As I was reviewing the section entitled “Lying: It’s wrong–except when it isn’t” in order to ensure that I had refuted each and every line Robert Spencer wrote, I noticed this doozie here:</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p>Jihadists today have spoken of the usefulness of deceptive practices. <a href="http://spencerwatch.com/#F31" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><sup>[31]</sup><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p></blockquote>
<p>Oh yeah, which ones?  Who and where?  What have they said?  Notice Spencer slips this in, without providing a single quote or reference to back his claim.  I’ve never seen an Al-Qaeda member or some other “jihadist” invoke taqiyya or kitman.  Far from it: they seem to openly declare their enmity and hatred for infidels.  They may have brutish beliefs, but they are painfully honest about these beliefs.  Although Al-Qaeda and co. operate sleeper cells, I’ve never seen any proof that they justify these based on any doctrine of taqiyya or kitman.  I’ve never seen any of the jihadists invoke taqiyya; instead, they vilify Shi’ites for believing in this doctrine.</p>
<h3><a name="Conclusion"></a><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>
<p>The irony is not lost on the perceptive reader that Robert Spencer and the Islamophobes use deceptive arguments to claim that Muslims are engaging in “large-scale deception campaigns today.” <a href="http://spencerwatch.com/#F32" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><sup>[32]</sup><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> It is paranoid alarmism of the worst order, designed to spread anti-Muslim sentiment.  Spencer’s vitriol is similar to the anti-Muslim polemic used by the Church during the Crusades, which does not come as a surprise, considering that his book opens up with the Crusader slogan “Deus Vult!” (God wills it!) and the very last word in it is “Crusade.”  What is contained between “Deus Vult!” and “Crusade” is the propaganda needed to wage this Crusade that God so willed.</p>
<p>Taqiyya simply means that a Muslim can renounce his faith in order to save his life from torture or death.  The doctrine of taqiyya is found in Judaism, which commands its followers to save their own lives even by lying.  Many Christian thinkers also believe this is something permissible.  As for kitman, this means “mental reservation” (i.e. telling half the truth in order to mislead someone), and is a doctrine accepted by the Church.   Kitman is also accepted in Judaism.</p>
<p>If Muslims are to be vilified for believing in lying and using deceit in war, then Jews are to be condemned even more for believing that lying is permissible to kill idolaters for their idolatry.  If Muslims are to be vilified for allowing lying to save life, then Christians are to be vilified more for the belief that lying is permitted to further the interests of the Church.  Naturally, our opponents will balk and cry “<em>tu quoque, tu quoque</em>!”  They wish Islam to be judged by a standard that their own religious belief cannot withstand.  These Islamophobes engage in “mental reservation” when they mention half-truths about Islam.  One must wonder if Robert Spencer believes it is permissible to lie in order to further the interests of the Catholic church?  Considering that he is a fervent anti-Muslim Catholic apologist, it would not be hard to believe.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Written by Sulaiman Razvi</p>
<p>Vulgarity in Vedas is already discussed in the article <a href="/index.php/2014/05/15/there-is-indeed-obscenity-in-vedas/" data-wpel-link="internal">Obscenity in Vedas</a>. In this article, I shall deal with vulgarities in other Hindu scriptures. Hindus&#8217; favourite topic to discuss is sexuality. Hindu fanatics enjoy a lot mocking others religions with fake references and the only solution to this seems to be showing some facts about their gods and sages from their own books. As I said in the article Obscenity in Vedas, I have no intention to mock Hindu religious personalities or hurt the sentiments of Hindus. Their vilification of other religions doesn’t seem to end and it looks like just a refutation to Hindu fanatics isn’t enough, Hinduism has to be decoded to show those fanatics what they follow. Hindu fanatics just by watching epic movies like Mahabharata and Ramayana on television start believing Hinduism to be the most decent religion and are under the impression that Hindu gods were the greatest being on earth. As far as my knowledge is concerned, Hindus started writing against Islam from the 19<sup>th</sup> century onwards, Muslim scholars at that time only refuted those Islamophobic books but they didn’t expose Hinduism, this was like encouragement to Hindus. Filth of every kind is found in Hinduism whether it is rape, bride/daughter selling, pedophilia, sodomy, homosexuality, molestation, prostitution, a pornographic book like Kamasutra, or obscene idols on temples in spite of all these Hindus have the audacity to point fingers at others. Can you imagine how Hindus would have made fun of other religions if they had even 10% of the filth found in Hinduism?</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, Hindu gods were no different from present Swamis and other Hindu priests who are caught in rape and murder cases. The shameless act of their gods is well preserved in their own scriptures. If a religion can be blamed for terrorism only because of its few followers, then why Hinduism shouldn’t be blamed for the rapists&#8217; Swamis who are caught in large numbers? After all, Swamis are representatives of the Hindu religion, then why spare them? Rape and Murder have become like eligibility to become Swami. I was embarrassed to write this article because many verses are so obscene that they cannot be discussed openly. Nowadays Hindus are very actively insulting other religions on the internet, this compelled me to write this article.<br />
<span id="top"></span></p>
<h2><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Description of Women</span></h2>
<p>Hindu texts’ description of Women is an insult to all women. It insults women in the following way,</p>
<p>Mahabharata 13.40 “Bhishma said, ‘It is even so as thou sayest, O thou of mighty arms. There is nothing untrue in all this that thou sayest, O thou of Kuru’s race, on the subject of women. In this connection I shall recite to thee the old history of how in days of yore the high-souled Vipula had succeeded in restraining women within the bounds laid down for them. I shall also tell thee, O king, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">how women were created by the Grandsire Brahman and the object for which they were created by Him. There is no creature more sinful, O son, than women. Woman is a blazing fire. She is the illusion</span>, O king, that the Daitya Maya created. She is the sharp edge of the razor. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">She is poison. She is a snake</span>. She is fire. She is, verily, all these united together. It has been heard by us that all persons of the human race are characterised by righteousness, and that they, in course of natural progress and improvement, attain to the status of deities. This circumstance alarmed the deities. They, therefore, O chastiser of foes, assembled together and repaired to the presence of the Grandsire. Informing Him of what was in their minds, they stood silent in his presence, with downcast eyes. <span style="color: #ff0000;">The puissant Grand sire having ascertained what was in the hearts of the deities, created women</span>, with the aid of an Atharvan rite. In a former creation, O son of Kunti, women were all virtuous. Those, however, that sprang from this creation by Brahman with the aid of an illusion became sinful. The grandsire bestowed upon them the desire of enjoyment, all kinds of carnal pleasure. Tempted by the desire of enjoyment, they began to pursue persons of the other sex. The puissant lord of the deities created Wrath as the companion of Lust. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Persons of the male sex, yielding to the power of Lust and Wrath, sought the companionship of women. Women have no especial acts prescribed for them. Even this is the ordinance that was laid down</span>. The Sruti declares that women are endued with senses the most powerful, that they have no scriptures to follow, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">and that they are living lies</span>.” Tr. Kisari Mohan Ganguli</p>
<p>This passage from Mahabharata shows that in the beginning all men were righteous and due to their righteousness they were going to attain the status of Deity. But Hindu gods were afraid and wondered how to stop them and for this reason they created women. Although the creator of the universe Brahma himself lusted after his own daughter. This shows that women have no especial acts prescribed and are created only to make men fall from righteousness. The next passage is from Srimad Bhagavatam which is also known as Bhagvad Purana,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 9.14.36-38 ”Urvasi said: My dear King, you are a man, a hero. Don’t be impatient and give up your life. Be sober and don’t allow the senses to overcome you like foxes. Don’t let the foxes eat you. In other words, you should not be controlled by your senses. Rather, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">you should know that the heart of a woman is like that of a fox</span>. There is no use making friendship with women. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Women as a class are merciless and cunning</span>. They cannot tolerate even a slight offense. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">For their own pleasure they can do anything irreligious</span>, and therefore they do not fear killing even a faithful husband or brother. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Women are very easily seduced by men</span>…” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>The description of women given by another Apsara to a Sage named Narada is also an insult, I won’t highlight those ugly words,</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, UmaSamhita 5.24.16-36 ”There is none more sinning and more sinful than women. Women are at the root of all sins…Women usually do not observe the limitations of conventional decency. If at all they stand by them with their husbands it is because no man makes advances to them or because they are afraid of their husbands…They carry on their dalliances with any man ugly or beautiful…Even women of noble families aspire for the life of lascivious women who in their prime of youth adorned with lovable ornaments and beautiful wearing garments move about frivolously…Women become desperate when they do not get men…women are not satiated with the number of men they cohabit with. O excellent sage, there is another secret of all women that immediately on seeing a man their vaginal passage begins to exude slimy secretions. On seeing a man fresh and clean from his bath with his body perfumed with sweet scents, the vaginal passage of women begins to exude like water dripping from a leather bag…on hearing her words Narada was satisfied in his mind. Considering it to be the truth.” Tr. Board of Scholars, Edited by Jagdish Lal Shastri</p>
<p>The entire chapter 24 of Shiva Purana is dedicated in insulting women. Had this been the personal views of Apsara there wouldn’t be an entire chapter for this and even Sage Narada considered it to be truth and was satisfied by her words. The founder of ISKCON Swami Prabhupada writes,</p>
<p>”<span style="color: #ff0000;">The heavenly pleasure for the conditioned soul is sexual pleasure</span>, and this pleasure is tasted by the genitals. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The woman is the object of sexual pleasure</span>, and both the sense perception of sexual pleasure and the woman are controlled by the Prajapati, who is under the control of the Lord’s genitals…” A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada on Srimad Bhagavatam 2.10.26 [ <a href="http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_2.10.26" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_2.10.26<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> ]
<p>Mahabharata 5.39.67 ”The fruits of the Vedas are ceremonies performed before the (homa) fire; the fruits of an acquaintance with the scriptures are goodness of disposition and conduct. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The fruits of women are the pleasures of intercourse and offspring</span>.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>I shall not indulge further in what Hindu scriptures say about women. An entire book can be written on this issue. As for now, these references will suffice. So in short women are like sly foxes, cunning, poisonous snakes, sex-maniac, bad luck, destitute of knowledge and intelligence, can’t inherit property… But are an object of lust and a child production factory.

<p>Swami Balendu spills the beans. Says rape is nothing rare in Hindu scriptures and done by Gods themselves. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/swamijibalendu/posts/rape-is-nothing-rare-in-hindu-scriptures-but-instead-of-being-condemned-it-is-go/10151277031878439/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Click here<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> for his Facebook post.</p>

<p>Swami Prabhupada the founder of ISKCON writes,</p>
<p><strong>”…</strong>In this regard, the word vikhyātam is very significant. A man is always famous for his aggression toward a beautiful woman, <span style="color: #ff0000;">and such aggression is sometimes considered rape</span>. Although rape is not legally allowed, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">it is a fact that a woman likes a man who is very expert at rape</span>.” A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada on Srimad Bhagavatam 4.25.41 [ <a href="http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_4.25.41" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_4.25.41<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> ]
<p>Readers are requested to read the commentary on next verse also after going to the above given link. Swami Prabhupada also writes,</p>
<p>”Both man and woman desire one another; that is the basic principle of material existence. Women in general always keep themselves beautiful so that they can be attractive to their lusty husbands. When a lusty husband comes before his wife, the wife takes advantage of his aggressive activities and enjoys life. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Generally when a woman is attacked by a man-whether her husband or some other man—she enjoys the attack, being too lusty</span>…”A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhu on Srimad Bhagavatam 4.26.26 [ <a href="http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_4.26.26" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_4.26.26<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> ]
<p>Is it really true that women enjoy being raped? And does she really like rapists? What made such a great scholar like Swami Prabhupada utter this? Well, actually almost every Hindu god raped women, Below are some references. Almost every rapist Hindu scholar claims to be an incarnation of Krishna,</p>
<p>Asaram pretended to be Krishna to sleep with innocent women.<br />

<p>Matsya Purana not only allows sex with a prostitute and concubine, but also allows gang rape of a concubine/prostitute, the fine is her payment.</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 227.142-6 &#8220;&#8230;a twice born indulging with a whore should be made to pay her wages&#8230;If a man after bringing a harlot does not indulge with her, the king should make him pay her twice as much and should levy a similar amount of fine for himself. Dharma will not thereby be upset. If a number of people forcibly indulge with a concubine, the king should make each one of them pay her double the amount of her wages.&#8221; Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>VISHNU</strong></p>
<p>Vishnu is said to have raped Tulsi/Vrinda by assuming the guise of her husband. What can be more disgusting than a god raping a chaste lady? And much worse is the celebration of this rape as a festival, yes you read it right. Hindus proudly celebrate the rape of Vrinda by Vishnu as a festival called Tulsi Vivah.</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Rudra Samhita 2, Yudha Khanda 5, Ch 23.38-45 ”On seeing her husband, Vrnda too was delighted. She forgot her sorrow. She considered everything a dream. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Delighted in the heart and with all the dormant passions kindled up, </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">she sported with him</span><span style="color: #ff0000;"> for many days in the middle of that forest</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Once at the end of the sexual intercourse she realised that it was Visnu. Vrnda rebuked him angrily and spoke thus. Vrnda said:—Fie on this misdeed of Visnu in outraging the modesty of another man’s wife</span>. I have now realised you as the wielder of illusion, <span style="color: #ff0000;">appearing in the guise of an ascetic</span>. Sanatkumara said:—O Vyasa, saying thus in great anger she showed her brilliant powers as a staunch <span style="color: #ff0000;">chaste lady by cursing Visnu</span>. “O base foe of the Daityas, defiler of other people’s virtue, O wicked one, take this curse from me, greater in force than all persons. The two persons whom you made to appear in front of me shall become Raksasas and abduct your wife. You will be distressed on account of separation from your wife roaming about with Sesa ‘lord of snakes’ who posed as your disciple here. You will seek the help of monkeys in the forest.” Tr. Board of Scholars, Edited by Jagdish Lal Shastri</p>
<p>This story is also supported by Skanda Purana II.iv.21-10-24, Shiva Purana, Rudra Samhita 2, Yudha Khanda 5, Ch 41 verses 1-35, Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Prakriti Khanda 21.18-31 and also mentioned in Devi Bhagavatam 9.24.14-22 with a slight variation, readers can check Devi Bhagavatam verses which are available online at <a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/db/bk09ch24.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Sacred-texts.com<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. I will avoid posting the same story from different scriptures as I don’t want to flood this article with several passages. The variation of this story is in only in names, the name of Tulasi also appears as Vrinda and her husband Shankachuda’s name is replaced by Jalandhar.</p>
<p>This poor lady named Vrinda/Tulasi was a devotee of Vishnu, it must have been so disheartening for her to be raped by the man whom she worshipped so devotedly every day. As per Shiva Purana, Rudra Samhita section 5, Ch 41.3-5 Vishnu assumed the form of her husband and raped her on the behest of Shiva. It was Shiva who ordered such a heinous act. This was done with an intention to kill her husband on the battlefield, it is said that her husband Shankachuda/Jalandhar couldn’t be killed unless the chastity of his wife is outraged. Shiva is part of Trimurti and is considered the Destroyer but Shiva the so-called Destroyer couldn’t destroy Jalandhar/Shankachuda so he commanded Vishnu to go and rape Vrinda/Tulsi. She cursed Vishnu to become a rock and that in his next incarnation (as Rama) his wife (Sita) will be kidnapped by a demon and he will have to seek the help of monkeys (Hanuman/VanarSena). As per this story, Ravana made no mistake by kidnapping Sita the wife of Rama, as this was already destined to happen. And was a result of Ram’s past deeds (rape of Vrinda/Tulasi).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>INDRA</strong></p>
<p>Indra was quite popular among gods and sages for ravishing others’ wives and had done this to Ahalya by assuming the form of her husband Sage Gautama,</p>
<p>Skanda Purana V.iii.136.2-16 ”There was a Brahmana named Gautama who was like another Brahma. He was endowed with truthfulness and piety. He was engrossed in the Vanaprastha stage of life. His blessed wife named Ahalya was very famous in all the three worlds as a woman endowed with beauty and prime of youth. Satakratu [Indra], the king of Devas, was infatuated by the exceptional beauty of Ahalya. The Slayer of Bala, therefore, tempted her. ”O beautiful lady of uncensured features, resort to me, the king of Devas, Sport about with me. You shall be one honoured in all the three worlds. What will you do with this Brahmana who has become lean and emaciated due to his over-zealousness for purity and conventional rites and austerities and Vedic studies! O lady of beautiful eyes, you must be rather undergoing sufferings now.”…<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Getting an opportunity, he assumed the excellent guise of the sage and carnally delighted Ahalya who believed (that he was Gautama) in the inner apartment</span>. Within a moment thereafter, O descendant of Bharata, the excellent sage hurriedly entered the apartment. On seeing Gautama come Purandara became terrified and he went out. Seeing him he thought (knew) that it was Sakra. So Gautama became highly enraged and he cursed Devendra: ”Since you could not control your senses, be one with a thousand vaginal apertures.” On being cursed thus, Devendra was instantly covered with a thousand vaginal apertures.” Tr. Ganesh Vasudeo Tagare</p>
<p>This story is also mentioned in Brahma Purana, Gautami-Mahatmya Part IV.16.39-44 and Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Krishna Janma Khanda chapter 61. When Indra saw sage Gautama going out with his disciples, he took it as an opportunity and raped Ahalya by assuming Gautama’s form and Ahalya wasn’t aware of this, As per Brahma Purana Gautami-Mahatmya part IV.16.51 she asked Indra ‘who are you’ and she suddenly got up from the bed. When Gautama caught Indra’s licentious act he cursed Indra as well as his wife Ahalya. The curse on Indra by Gautama is quite funny. As a result of the curse, Indra lost his testicles and penis and also had one thousand marks of vagina all over his body,</p>
<p>Brahma Purana, Gautami-Mahatmya 16.59 Gautama said:- ”Sin has been committed by you due to your passion for the vagina. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Hence become a person with a thousand vaginas in your body</span>”. Tr. Board of Scholars, Edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Mahabharata 12.343.19-57 ”In consequence of his </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">licentious assault on Ahalya</span><span style="color: #000000;">, Indra was cursed by Gautama, her husband, through which Indra got a green beard on his face. Through that curse of Kausika </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Indra lost, also, his own testicles</span><span style="color: #000000;">, which loss was afterwards (through the kindness of the other deities) made up by the substitution of the testicles of a ram.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</span></p>
<p>This is also mentioned in,</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana 1.2.27.23 ”Formerly, the penis of Indra along with his scrotum, O sage conversant with virtue, was made to fall down on the earth by the infuriated sage Gautama.” Tr. Ganesh Vasudeo Tagare</p>
<p>Swami Prabhupada wrote,</p>
<p>”…Once he [Indra] raped the wife of Gautama Muni by using his disappearing art, and similarly by becoming invisible he stole the horse of Maharaja Prthu….” A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada on Srimad Bhagawatam 4.24.5 [ <a href="http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_4.24.5" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_4.24.5<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> ]
<p>Indra somehow got the scrotum of a ram fixed in his body, and the marks of thousand vaginas were later turned into thousand visions.</p>
<p>Brahma Vaivarta Purana mentioned the rape of Rambha by Indra. Rambha was the daughter of Sucandara and wife of King Janamejaya. King Janamejaya had planned to perform Ashvamedha Yajna but Indra stole the sacrificial horse, Indra raped queen Rambha in the stable after which she committed suicide due to the assault by Vedic Devta Indra. Indra wasn’t remorseful but he feared consequences by king Janamejaya and fled to Indralok. This seems to be another version of the story mentioned in Harivamsa Purana Bhavishya Parva 3.5.11-13 which I discussed in <a href="/index.php/2018/05/14/ashvamedha-yajna-the-obscene-ritual/" data-wpel-link="internal">Ashvamedha Yajna</a> article.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Krishna Janma Khanda, chapter 14, verses 45-51 &#8220;&#8230;now I am going to narrate the story of Rambha to you, Rambha was born in the land of Bharata as daughter of Sucandara&#8230;the king Sucandra gave away his daughter in marriage to Janamejaya along with several riches&#8230;The king enjoyed her company at several places. Once the king started and Asvamedha sacrifice. At that point of time Indra stole away the sacrificial horse and concealed himself in the royal palaces. Thinking that the Sacrificial horse would be quite beautiful she went to the stable alone playfully. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><u>On reaching the horse, Indra appeared on the scene and forcibly enjoyed her company. He had sex with her in spite of her objecting to it</u></span>. After the performance, Indra was fainted and he lost the senses about the day or night. The beautiful ladies coming in touch with Indra ended her life and Indra getting terrified from the king went back to the heaven.&#8221; Tr. Shanti Lal Nagar, edited by Acharya Ramesh Chaturvedi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>SHIVA</strong></p>
<p>Bhagavad Purana states that Shiva tried to force himself on a naked woman,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 8.12.26-30 ”<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The beautiful woman was already naked</span>, and when She saw Lord Siva coming toward Her, She became extremely bashful. Thus She kept smiling, but She hid Herself among the trees and did not stand in one place. His senses being agitated, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Lord Siva, victimized by lusty desires, began to follow Her</span>, just as a lusty elephant follows a she-elephant. After following Her with great speed, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Lord Siva caught Her by the braid of Her hair and dragged Her near him</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Although She was unwilling, he embraced Her with his arms</span>. Being embraced by Lord Siva like a female elephant embraced by a male, the woman, whose hair was scattered, swirled like a snake. O King, this woman, who had large, high hips, was a woman of yogamaya presented by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">She released Herself somehow or other from the fond embrace of Lord Siva’s arms and ran away</span>.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>This is sexual harassment and if a man does this in the present age he would surely be put behind the bars for an attempt to rape. The above verses are explained briefly in the LGBT section. This is Shiva’s rape of Vishnu (Mohini).</p>
<p><strong>SOMA</strong></p>
<p>Soma is said to have raped Brihaspati’s wife Tara,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 9.14.4 ”After conquering the three worlds [the upper, middle and lower planetary systems], Soma, the moon-god, performed a great sacrifice known as the Rājasūya-yajña. Because he was very much puffed up, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">he forcibly kidnapped Bṛhaspati’s wife, whose name was Tara”</span>. Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Krishna Janma Khanda 80.9-19 ”[Tara to Soma]…And if you commit rape with me, you will surely be guilty of woman slaughter. But when the Moon, without minding her words was about to commit rape with her, the dispassionate chaste woman cursed him thus…<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">In spite of the curse however, the Moon, held her and associated with her</span>. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Afterwards, holding the sorrowful, weeping wife of the Guru in his lap, he left that place</span>.” Tr. Rajendra Nath Sen</p>
<p>It is also mentioned in Brahmanda Purana 2.3.72.29. Brihaspati is considered the Guru of all Gods. Soma without thinking about violating the bed of the guru raped the preceptor’s wife. But Brihaspati was not an angel, he too had raped a woman.</p>
<p><strong>BRIHASPATI</strong></p>
<p>Brihaspati the Guru of all Gods raped his own pregnant sister-in-law named Mamata. A man with what kind of heart would do that?</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 49.17-28 ”Suta said:- Brihaspati, whilst staying on Earth, one day saw the wife of his brother, Usija, who was big with child, and addressed her thus:- ”Dress thyself well and let us enjoy.” She, being thus addressed, replied to Brihaspati thus:- ”The embryo in my womb is mature and is already reciting the Vedas. Thy seed will also not be fruitless and thy proposal is sinful.” Hearing which, Brihaspati said:- ”I need not to be taught morality by thee, O sweet one.” <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">After saying that, he carried out his desire by force</span>…” Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, Edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>This rape is also mentioned in Vayu Purana Part 2, 37.140 and  <a href="http://sacred-texts.com/hin/m01/m01105.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Mahabharata Adi Parva 1.104<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> but the translator K.M. Ganguli has translated those particular lines of Mahabharata into Latin language. This story of Mamata’s rape is also mentioned in Srimad Bhagavatam,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 9.20.36 ”When the demigod named Bṛhaspati was attracted by his brother’s wife, Mamata, who at that time was pregnant, he desired to have sexual relations with her. The son within her womb forbade this, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">but Bṛhaspati cursed him and forcibly discharged semen into the womb of Mamata</span>.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>The rape of Mamata is also mentioned in Brahmanda Purana 2.3.74.37-42. It was like a battle of rape going on between Hindu gods like Soma, Indra, and Brihaspati. All of them raped women which is also mentioned in Purana in one single passage,</p>
<p>Srimad Devi Bhagavatam 4.15.59-64 ”Look! <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The Moon stole away per force knowingly the wife of Brihaspati; Indra, knowing what is religion stole away the wife of Gautama; Brihaspati enjoyed forcibly the wife of his younger</span>; and also he outraged his elder brother’s wife in her pregnant state and cursed the boy in the womb…” Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p><strong>VARUNA</strong></p>
<p>Varuna is the god of water. He is praised in several hymns of the Vedas. A story mentioned in the Mahabharata tells us Varuna’s rape of Bhadra another wife of Utathya,</p>
<p>Mahabharata 13.154.10-17 ”…’Hear now, O king, the story of Utathya who was born in the race of Angiras. The daughter of Soma, named Bhadra, came to be regarded as unrivalled in beauty. Her sire Soma regarded Utathya to be the fittest of husbands for her…the handsome <span style="color: #ff0000;">Varuna had, from a long time before, coveted the girl</span>. Coming to the woods where Utathya dwelt, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Varuna stole away the girl when she had plunged into the Yamuna for a bath. Abducting her</span> thus, the Lord of the waters took her to his own abode…There, within that palace, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">the Lord of waters; O king, sported with the damsel. A little while after, the fact of the ravishment of his wife was reported to Utathya</span>…” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p><strong>SURYA</strong></p>
<p>Surya is the Sun-God and several hymns of Vedas are dedicated to him. He raped the virgin Kunti. Kunti was just examining her mystic power and the sun god appeared before her and was smitten with passion after seeing young and beautiful Kunti and then raped her.</p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 2.6.13-35 ”…Surya Deva said :– “O Kunti! What for you called me, by virtue of the Mantra? Calling me, why do you not worship me, standing before you? O beautiful blue one! <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Seeing you, I have become passionate; so come to me. By means of the mantra, you have made me your subservient so take me for intercourse</span>.” Hearing this, Kunti said:– “O Witness of all! O knower of Dharma! <span style="color: #ff0000;">You know that I am a virgin girl</span>. O Suvrata! I bow down to you; I am a family daughter; <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">so do not speak ill to me</span>.” Surya then said :– “If I go away in vain, I will be an object of great shame, and, no doubt, will be laughed amongst the gods; So, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">O Kunti! If you do not satisfy me, I will immediately curse you</span></strong> and the Brahmin who has given you this mantra. O Beautiful one! If you satisfy me, your virginity will remain; no body will come to know and there will be born a son to you, exactly like me.” <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Thus saying Surya Deva enjoyed the bashful Kunti</span>, with her mind attracted towards him; He granted her the desired boons and went away. <span style="color: #ff0000;">The beautiful Kunti became pregnant and began to remain in a house, under great secrecy</span>. Only the dear nurse knew that; her mother or any other person was quite unaware of the fact. In time, a very beautiful son like the second Sun and Kartikeya, decked with a lovely Kavacha coat of mail and two ear-rings, was born there.” Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Their conversation is mentioned in detail in Srimad Bhagavatam,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 9.24.33-36 As soon as Kunti called for the demigod of the sun, he immediately appeared before her, and she was very much surprised. She told the sun-god, “<span style="color: #ff0000;">I was simply examining the effectiveness of this mystic power. I am sorry I have called you unnecessarily. Please return and excuse me</span>.” The sun-god said: O beautiful Pritha, your meeting with the demigods cannot be fruitless. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Therefore, let me place my seed in your womb so that you may bear a son</span>. I shall arrange to keep your virginity intact, since you are still an unmarried girl. After saying this, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">the sun-god discharged his semen into the womb of Pritha</span> and then returned to the celestial kingdom. Immediately thereafter, from Kunti a child was born, who was like a second sun-god. Because Kunti feared people’s criticisms, with great difficulty she had to give up her affection for her child. Unwillingly, she packed the child in a basket and let it float down the waters of the river. O Maharaja Parikshit, your great-grandfather the pious and chivalrous King Pandu later married Kunti.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>This son was later known as Karna. Kunti somehow tried to resist the rape by warning him not to do this, by telling him that she is from a good family, that she was only examining her powers, she is a virgin but all in vain. When Surya thought his sweet words are not going to seduce Kunti he threatened to curse her as a last resort. Poor Kunti had no choice but to get raped by the sun god. Surya devoid of any morality didn’t even care about rape and adultery, He just wanted to relieve his desire forcefully and went away but the poor Kunti had to pay the price for this act. As Kunti was not ready for all these things, she had to abandon her illegitimate child to avoid a bad name for her family and embarrassment. Kunti later married King Pandu. And after her marriage, the Sun god again had sex with Kunti but this time it was consensual sex which is explained in the Niyoga Section. The series of rape by the sun god doesn’t end her, He is said to have raped his own wife. He assumed another form and approached her. She tried to resist the rape but the Sun god successfully carried out his act. This is explained in the Oral Sex Section.</p>
<p><strong>ASHWINKUMARA</strong></p>
<p>Ashvinkumara was the son of the Sun God. He is said to have raped a Brahmin lady and impregnated her.</p>
<p>Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Brahma Kanda, 10.125-134 Saunaka was astonished at the words of Sauti and said, ‘Sir, what irony of fate led Aswinkumara, the offspring of the sun, to copulate with a Brahmin woman? Kindly narrate this incident and gratify my curiosity” Santi, the best of saints replied, ”O best of Munis, impossible are the ways of Providence . Once upon a time, this tranquil, strong offspring of the sun was enamoured of a Brahmin woman while she was going out on pilgrimage. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Though he was dissuaded by her again and again he </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">forcibly took her to a grove, ravished and impregnated her</span>. The lady, bewildered with shame and fear caused her own miscarriage…” Tr. Rajendra Nath Sen</p>
<p>Like father like son. Modern-day examples of Surya and Ashvinkumara are Asaram and his son Sai Narayana who are both convicted of raping women. Had these father-son duo (Asaram-Narayan) existed in the Vedic period they would have been worshiped by the people.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">BRAHMA</span></strong></p>
<p>Brahma the creator is said to have raped his own daughter Saraswati. It is explained in detail in the article <a href="/index.php/2016/05/05/brahmas-incestuous-relationship-with-his-daughter/" data-wpel-link="internal">Brahma’s incestuous relationship with his daughter</a> Saraswati.</p>
<p><strong>RAPE AND ABDUCTION ARE LEGITIMIZED</strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="237" height="392" class="wp-image-8857 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Picture-6.jpeg" alt="https://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/rape-ravana-gods-fb_img_1481030254745.jpg?w=237&amp;h=392" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Picture-6.jpeg 237w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Picture-6-181x300.jpeg 181w" sizes="(max-width: 237px) 100vw, 237px" /></p>
<p>The Hindu scripture lists several forms of marriage, one of them is known as Rakshasa marriage. Rape and abduction of females are legitimized under this form of marriage. Maharshi Manu explains Rakshasa marriage in the following way,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 3.33 The forcible abduction of a maiden from her home, while she cries out and weeps, after (her kinsmen) have been slain or wounded and (their houses) broken open, is called the Rakshasa rite.</p>
<p>Swami Prabhupada writes,</p>
<p>”…There are other kinds of marriage, such as gāndharva marriage and marriage by love, which are also accepted as marriage. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Even if one is forcibly kidnapped and later on accepted as a wife, that is also accepted</span>…” A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada on Srimad Bhagawatam 3.22.15 [ <a href="http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_3.22.15" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_3.22.15<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> ]
<p>This form of marriage is permitted for the Kshatriya caste,</p>
<p>Manu 3.24 “The four forms (of Marriage) the seers have ordained as proper for Brahmanas; only the Rakshasa form as proper for Kshatriyas, and the A’sura form as proper for Vais’yas and S’udras.” Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>It is also mentioned in Mahabharata,</p>
<p>Mahabharata 1.73.8-11 ”…There are, in all, eight kinds of marriages. These are Brahma, Daiva, Arsha, Prajapatya, Asura, Gandharva, Rakshasa, and Paisacha, the eighth. Manu, the son of the self-create, hath spoken of the appropriateness of all these forms according to their order. Know, O faultless one, that the first four of these are fit for Brahmanas, and the first six for Kshatriyas. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">As regards kings, even the Rakshasa form is permissible</span>. The Asura form is permitted to Vaisyas and Sudras. Of the first five the three are proper, the other two being improper. The Paisacha and the Asura forms should never be practised. These are the institutes of religion, and one should act according to them. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The Gandharva and the Rakshasa form are consistent with the practices of Kshatriyas</span>…” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Brihadarayaka Upanishad also promotes rape,</p>
<p>Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 6.4.7 ”If she does not willingly yield her body to him, he should buy her with presents. If she is still unyielding, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">he should strike her with a stick or with his hand and overcome her</span>, repeating the following mantra: “With power and glory I take away your glory.” Thus she becomes discredited.” Tr. Swami Nikhilananda</p>
<p>As far as enjoying numerous women is concerned, the Brahmins exclusively enjoy this right through Niyoga. Which we have already read in the article <a href="https://vedkabhed.wordpress.com/2014/05/15/there-is-indeed-obscenity-in-vedas/" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Obscenity in Vedas<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>.</p>
<p>Hinduism blames the victim in the case of rape, it says that by getting raped the woman incurs sin. Women have always been made to suffer in case of rape. When Ahalya was raped by Vedic god Indra, Ahalya’s husband Gautama Rishi didn’t accept Ahalya rather he cursed her. Sita too had to burn herself in Agni Pariksha because she was suspected of committing infidelity with Ravana who had abducted her. Parashar Smriti states a ritual by which a rape victim can “regain her purity.”</p>
<p>Parasara Smriti 10.25-26 “A woman forcibly ravished by a man, in captivity, as well as she, who accommodates a man on account of being physically over-powered, or out of a sense of danger to her life, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">should regain her purity by practising a Santapanam penance</span>. This is what has been enjoined by Parasara. A woman, who having been once ravished by another man, turns back with repugnance from the path of inequity, should expiate her sin by practising a Prajapatya penance, whereby she would be pure after her next monthly period.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>A case was also reported ‘<a href="https://www.thequint.com/news/india/asked-to-throw-a-feast-by-panchayat-to-purify-daughter-says-rape-victims-father" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">We Were Told to Throw Feast to Purify Her<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>’: Rape Victim’s Father living in Madhya Pradesh’s Rajgarh</p>

<p>For people in heaven, Ishwar has arranged hundreds and thousands of Apsaras or ‘Harlot’ as per the term used by Hindus on this issue. Hindu fanatics try to make a mockery of Muslims on this issue but have they ever read what their scripture says about it? Ironically for them having wives in heaven is a lusty concept but they are okay with worshipping Krishna who had 16108 wives and numerous concubines. Hinduism states that those who die on the battlefield, those who do service to cows, and those who perform certain rituals will enjoy Apsaras in Svarga.</p>
<p>Parashara Smriti 3.28-29 <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Celestial damsels seize for themselves, and take delight with the hero</span>, whose body is wounded or cut by arrows, clubs, or maces. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Thousands of celestial damsels, rush forward in a hurry towards a hero killed in battle</span>, each proclaiming, ‘He is my lord, he is mine’.</p>
<p>Parashara Smriti 3.31 If victorious, wealth is won; <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">if death results, beautiful women fall to his share</span>; since this corporeal frame is liable to perish in an instant’s time, why should we be shy of meeting death on a field of battle?</p>
<p>Mahabharata 12.98.46-51 ”Foremost of Apsaras, numbering by thousands, go out with great speed (for receiving the spirit of the slain hero) coveting him for their lord.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Hindu fanatics should somehow make sure that their wives don’t immolate themselves in their funeral pyre. Because if the wife immolates with her husband then he can’t enjoy Virgins in heaven,</p>
<p>Srimad Devi Bhagavatam 3.15.10-13 ”<span style="color: #ff0000;">Some warriors on being slain in the battle instantly arose in a celestial car to the heavens </span>and <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">was seen addressing the celestial nymph, who came already within his embrace</span>, thus “O one of beautiful thighs. Behold! how my beautiful body is lying on the earth below!” <span style="color: #ff0000;">Another warrrior thus slain got up in the heavens on a celestial car, </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">came in possession of a celestial nymph</span> and when he was sitting with her in the car, <span style="color: #ff0000;">his former wife in the earth made herself a sati and burnt herself up in the funeral pyre</span>, thus got a celestial body, came up to the heavens; and <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">that chaste virtuous woman drew away perforce her own husband away from that celestial nymph</span>. Two warriors, went up, slew each other and lay down dead at the same time. They went up in the heavens at the same time and there began quarrel with each other and fight with their weapons for <span style="color: #ff0000;">one and the same celestial nymph</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Some hero got in the heavens a nymph more lovely and beautiful</span> than himself and he thus became very much attached and devoted her. He began to describe his own heroic qualities and also to copy dotedly the qualities of his lover so that she might remain faithfully attached to him.” Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>His fellow warriors enjoyed the virgins but this poor guy couldn’t because his wife immolated herself in his pyre. And took him away forcibly from the celestial nymph (Apsara).</p>
<p>Mahabharata 13.79.27 ”That man who habitually makes gifts of kine comes to be regarded as the foremost of his species. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">When thus proceeding to Heaven, he is received by a thousand celestial damsels of beautiful hips and adorned with handsome robes and ornaments</span>. These girls wait upon him there and minister to his delight. He sleeps there in peace and is awakened by the musical laughter of those gazelle-eyed damsels, the sweet notes of their Vinas, the soft strains of their Vallakis, and the melodious tinkle of their Nupuras. ” Tr.

<p>Mahabharata 3.42.23 ”…It is through thy grace, O mountain, that Brahmanas and Kshatriyas and Vaisyas <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">attain heaven, and their anxieties gone, sport with the celestials</span>…” ” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Mahabharata 13.106.53-55 ”’…That man who, unafflicted by disease and free from every malady, observes a fast, verily acquires, at every step the merits that attach to Sacrifices. Such a man ascends to Heaven on a car drawn by swans.

It is blessed, holy land and destructive of the world. It is most excellent of all the worlds. it is named (Visnu-loka) after the name of Visnu. It is a sacred abode full of mysteries.

<p>Swami Prabhupada wrote</p>
<p>“People in general are not very intelligent, and due to their ignorance they are most attached to the fruitive activities recommended in the karma-kāṇḍa portions of the Vedas. They do not want anything more than sense gratificatory proposals for enjoying life in heaven, where wine and women are available and material opulence is very common…They are generally sensual, and they do not want anything other than the heavenly pleasures of life. It is understood that there are gardens called nandana-kānana in which there is good opportunity for association with angelic, beautiful women and having a profuse supply of somarasa wine. Such bodily happiness is certainly sensual; therefore there are those who are purely attached to material, temporary happiness, as lords of the material world.” <strong>Swami Prabhupada on Gita 2.42-43</strong><br />

<p><strong>Who are the Apsaras (Nymphs/Heavenly Virgins)?</strong></p>
<p>Srimad Devi Bhagavatam 9.1.96-143 ”…those that are sprung from Tamo Guna are recognised as worst and belonging to the unknown families. They are very scurrilous, cheats, ruining their families, fond of their own free ways, quarrelsome and no seconds are found equal to them. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Such women become prostitutes in this world and Apsaras in the Heavens</span>…” Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>In other words, Ishwar provides the Dvijas (Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaisyas) with numerous prostitutes in heaven. Especially for those who are slain on the battlefield. After reading these verses will Hindu fanatics post these verses on their social media accounts?</p>

<h2><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Gods and Rishis Lusting after Women</span></h2>
<p>Gods and Rishis lusted after women. They were aroused by seeing young girls even in their old stricken age. How can I forget to mention Indra in this list after all he frequently lusted after others&#8217; wives, I am not saying this but a Sage himself had said it,</p>
<p><strong>INDRA</strong></p>
<p>Mahabharata 13.40.13-18 ”…The Creator himself is incapable of restraining them within the limits that are proper: what need then be said of men? This, O chief of men, I heard in former days, viz., how Vipula had succeeded in protecting his preceptor’s spouse in ancient times. <span style="color: #ff0000;">There was in days of yore a highly blessed Rishi of the name of Devasarman of great celebrity. He had a wife, Ruchi </span>by name, who was unequalled on earth for beauty. Her loveliness intoxicated every beholder among the deities and Gandharvas and Danavas. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The chastiser of Paka, viz., Indra, the slayer of Vritra, O monarch, was in particular enamoured of her and coveted her person</span>. The great ascetic Devasarman was fully cognisant of the disposition of women. He, therefore, to the best of his power and energy, protected her (from every kind of evil influence). <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The Rishi knew that Indra was restrained by no scruples in the matter of seeking the companionship of other people’s wives. It was for this reason that he used to protect his spouse, putting forth all his power</span>…” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>So now I am free from all the allegations that I am using bad words against Indra, as the Rishi himself has described the truth about Indra.</p>
<p>Indra in old age had lusted after another lady named Sukala and tried to make sexual advances to her, but she in anger insulted him,</p>
<p>Padma Purana II.58.25-28a ”Sukala said:- Well being to you. I am protected by the magnanimous sons of my husband, and by companions; so I am not at all alone. From whom (then) do I have fear? I am protected by brave men everywhere. I do not have much time to talk. I am engaged in my duty towards him. O you very intelligent one, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">why do you not feel ashamed of dallying with me while your eyes are trickling (i.e. while you are old)</span>. Who are you that you have come here, and are not afraid even of death?” Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p>Indra addressed Ahalya the wife of Sage Gautama in the following way,</p>
<p>Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Krishna Janma Khanda 61.22-41 ”…What an indescribable asceticism the great devotee Gautama had practiced by virtue of which he luckily secured the possession of a very beautiful wife! By the worship of the eternal goddess of Nature, (Parvati) who is the emblem of the spell of Visnu and by the adoration of Kamala, he was undoubtedly secured a wife like Kamala having looks of a lotus, who is a woman of the first four classes (Padmini), of slender waist, huge buttocks, hard breast; of the colour of heated gold, of fine teeth and soft and pure complexion, the touch of whose body is agreeably warm in winter and delightfully cool in summer. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Fair one, Cupid versed in sexual science or the lustful moon-god alone knows how to cohabit with a damsel like you</span>. How can Gautama resourceful only in meditations know that? <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">In sexual science I am a past-master, and on this score I am always eulogised by the above named clever individuals and by the celestial whores Urvasi</span> etc. O nymph possessing an excellent face, I shall make Sachi your maid-servant…” Tr. Rajendra Nath Sen</p>
<p><strong>VISHNU</strong></p>
<p>Narada Purana, Uttarabhaga 28.35-37 “Visnu whom people meditate upon and truly remember, who is called Yogamurti (Embodiment of Yoga) and who is eternal, was enamoured of courtesans…” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p><strong>SHIVA</strong></p>
<p>Shiva shamelessly went to the pine forest and seduced the wives of sages, He went to the pine forest in Bhikshatana form, readers can Google the image of Bhikshatana which is fully nude with a snake tied around his waist,</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Kotirudra Samhita 4.12.8-13 ”Once the leading Brahmin devotees of Siva engrossed in the meditation of Siva went into the forest for bringing sacrificial twigs. In the meantime Siva himself assuming a very hideous form came there in order to test their devotion. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">He was very brilliant but stark naked</span>. He had smeared ashes all over his body as the sole ornament. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Standing there and holding his penis he began to show all sorts of vicious tricks</span>. It was with a mind to do something pleasing to the forest-dwellers that Siva, favourite of the devotees, came to the forest at his will. The wives of the sages were extremely frightened at this sight. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The other women excited and surprised approached the lord</span>. Some embraced him. Others held his hands. The women were engrossed in struggling with one another. ” Tr. Board of Scholars, Edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Skanda Purana V.iii.38.23-38 ”…One lady who was over proud of her beauty and youthful form forgot to breast-feed her son lying on her lap. On seeing Mahadeva, another lady became struck by the arrows of Kama. She pressed down her protruding breasts with her arms…” Tr. Ganesh Vasudeo Tagare</p>
<p>Previous verses of Shiva Purana tell us that Shiva went there to test them. As far as my opinion on this issue is concerned, Shiva actually wanted to enjoy sages’ wives on the pretext of the test, just like Krishna stole the clothes of Gopis to watch them naked and later gave a lame reason for this. In the Skanda Purana I.i.34.116-129, Parvati the wife of Shiva says that Shiva went to Daruvanam forest nude only to seduce women of sages on the pretext of begging alms, Parvati had denuded Shiva in front of gods and their servants after Shiva lost the bet in the game of dice,</p>
<p>Skanda Purana, Part 1, Mahesvarakhanda book 1, Kedarkhanda section 1, chapter 34, verses 11-129 “After saying thus, Parvati, the goddess, beloved of Sankara, became furious. She held Sankara by the hand. The lady of slender limbs took away the serpent Vasuki from his neck. Similarly she removed many other ornaments also. The infuriated lady hurriedly took away the ornaments of Sambhu. His crescent moon and his excellent elephant hide removed. The serpents Kambala and Asvatara tha thad been worn by Mahesa as ornaments were removed by the great goddess laughingly with tricky words. Even his loincloth was taken away laughingly with the utterance of tricky words. At that time the Ganas and the friends (of Parvati) felt embarrassed and ashamed. (The friends and others) turned their faces away. Bhrngi of great oenance, Candi, Munda, Mahaloman, Mahodara and many other Ganas became miserable. On seeing them in that plight, Mahesa became ashamed. Sankara who became angry spoke these words to Parvati: ‘All these sages are laughing satirically. Similarly Brahma, Visnu and these Devas, Indra and others all of them laughing (at me)…On being told thus by Sambhu, the Yogin, Parvati, the chaste lady of charming face, laughed and spoke these words: ‘<span style="text-decoration: underline;">What have you to do with a loincloth</span>? You are a sage of sanctified soul. (Some time back) <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">you wandered through Daruvana with the cardinal points alone for your garment (i.e. you were naked). Under the pretext of begging for alms, the wives of the sages were enchanted</span>. While you were going, you were greatly adored by them. Your loincloth fell down (penis?) there…” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>It is proved that the purpose of Shiva going to the pine forest in a nude state was only to enjoy sages’ wives. For the sake of the argument let’s accept that Shiva’s motive was really to test them. My question is, Is it befitting for a god to hold his erected penis in hand and appear fully naked before chaste women? Imagine someone doing this to your mother, sister, or daughter, you will start beating the guy and this is what the Rishis did, yes you read it right. Shiva was beaten up severely by the Rishis and even his penis was cut off,</p>
<p>Kurma Purana II.38.52 ”The sages said: A certain highly brilliant person has entered the holy Daruvana along with his wife, who was very beautiful in all her limbs. But he was naked. The lordly person fascinated our entire women and daughters, with his charming personality. While his beloved defiled our sons. We heaped various imprecations and curses on him but they were defied and set at nought. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">He was beaten soundly by us</span>. His Linga was struck down.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>This story of Shiva being beaten up is supported by Brahmanda Purana,</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana I.2.27.45 ”<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">He [Shiva] was scolded and beaten</span>. His Linga (?penis) was taken out. It is to alleviate his anger that we have sought refuge in you.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>For a brief explanation of this Linga story read the article <a href="/index.php/2014/05/15/analysis-of-lingam/" data-wpel-link="internal">What</a> is Shivling? Shiva surely deserved to be beaten up for doing this vulgar act. But this wasn’t the full stop of his shameless act, he did this again and was again beaten up,</p>
<p>Skanda Purana V.i.26.71-72”After the Manvantara came to a close and Vaivasvata Manvantara arrived again, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Mahesvara entered the sacrificial hall of Brahma with the same guise of and insance person with erected penis</span>. [75-77b] Other asked him whether it was one of his Vratas and if so by whom was it demonstrated. They continued: ”<span style="color: #ff0000;">There are women here</span>. How is it that this has been committed by you…You are worthy of being killed by us today.” <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">On being hit and hurt by the Brahmanas</span>, thus, Sankara, the great holy Lord, smiled and told all those Brahmanas: ”Why do you hit me-a lunatic who has lost his senses? Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>What else can be said about such a person? I don’t have any words to describe such a shameless deed.</p>
<p><strong>VISHWAKARMA</strong></p>
<p>Vishwakarma was enamored of an Apsara named Ghirtachi who was going for pilgrimage. He invited her for having sex, but she refused. He even tried to rape her, but she resisted the rape just by warning him about the consequences.</p>
<p>Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Brahma Khanda, 10.24-31 Sauti answered, ‘O best of saints, once upon a time the celestial nymph Ghritachi, being extremely excited with passion put on a lovely dress and proceeded in the direction of Puskara for pilgrimage iin the mean time, Viswakarma cheefully arrived there from the solar region and suddenly observed the sportive damsel. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">As soon as he saw her, he was pierced with the darts of Cupid</span>. Having lost all control over his will he demanded carnal intercourse from that nymph…” Tr. Rajendra Nath Sen</p>
<p><strong>ASHWINS</strong></p>
<p>Ashwins lusted after the wife of old Rishi Chyavana named Sukanya. They tried to seduce her but all in vain so at last, they gave her an offer that they will rejuvenate her old husband and in return, she will have to marry one of them. After consulting with her husband she agreed. So Ashwins told Chyavan to enter the water so he entered the water. Ashwins were playing tricks here and they too entered the water and when three of them (two Ashwin brothers and Chyavana) came out of the water all of them had the same appearance. Rishi Chyvana was rejuvenated. Ashwins made the same appearance in order to disflower Sukanya. This story of Rishi Chyavana been rejuvenated is also mentioned in Rig Veda, Nirukta, several Puranas, and Pancavimsa Brahmana.</p>
<p>Mahabharata 3.123.1-9 “Lomasa said, ‘Once on a time, O king, those celestials, namely the twin Aswins, happened to behold Sukanya, when she had (just) bathed, and when her person was bare. And seeing that one of excellent limbs, and like unto the daughter of the lord of celestials, the nose-born Aswins neared her, and addressed her, saying, ‘O thou of shapely thighs, whose daughter art thou? And what doest thou in this wood? O auspicious one, O thou of excellent grace, we desire to know this, do thou therefore tell us.’ Thereupon she replied bashfully unto those foremost of celestials. ‘Know me as Sarayati’s daughter, and Chyavana’s wife…O thou of luminous smiles? O divinely beautiful damsel, do thou, forsaking Chyavana accept one of us for husband. It behoveth thee not to spend thy youth fruitlessly…” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p><strong>SEVERAL GODS LUSTING AFTER URJA THE DAUGHTER OF MOON GOD</strong></p>
<p>Brahma Purana 110.13-15 ”When the holy god Moon did not see his daughter Urja, he was upset. Where she may have gone? He thought to himself. The Soma came to know the facts. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">He knew that manes were after her, that they were sexually inclined to her </span>and had accepted by the virtue of their penance. The moon was overcome with anger.” Tr. Board of Scholars, Edited by J.L. Shastri’</p>
<p><strong>RISHIS</strong></p>
<p>A sage named Chyavana was attracted to a Princess named Sukanya,</p>
<p>Mahabharata 3.122.1-11 “Lomasa said, ‘A son was born to the great saint Bhrigu, Chyavana by name…Now after the lapse of a long space of time, that ruler of earth, Saryati by name, for amusement visited this pleasant and excellent lake. With him were four thousand females, espoused by him, O son of Bharata’s race! <span style="text-decoration: underline;">there was also his only daughter endued with beautiful brows, named Sukanya</span>. She surrounded by her maids, and decked out with jewels fit for the celestials, while walking about, approached the anthill where Bhrigu’s son was seated. And surrounded by her maids, she began to amuse herself there, viewing the beautiful scenery, and looking at the lofty trees of the wood. And she was handsome and in the prime of her youth; and she was amorous and bent on frolicking. And she began to break the twigs of the forest trees bearing blossoms. And Bhrigu’s son endued with intelligence beheld her wandering like lightning, without her maids, and wearing a single piece of cloth and decked with ornaments. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">And seeing her in the lone forest, that ascetic of exceeding effulgence was inspired with desire</span>. And that regenerate Rishi possessing ascetic energy, who had a low voice, called the auspicious one,–but she heard him not.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>This is also mentioned in Srimad Bhagavatam 9.3. The Princess named Sukanya accidentally harmed Rishi Chyavana who had assumed the form of an earth worm. He was going to curse her, but then the king who was the father of Sukanya urged Chyavana not to curse his daughter then Chyavana agreed on one condition that he should give his daughter to him in marriage as he was sexually aroused seeing her.</p>
<p>There is a story of another sage named Pippalada who was very old and had also threatened to curse the king if he doesn’t give his daughter to him, unlike Chyavana he wasn’t harmed at all by the Princess. He became lustful after seeing the beautiful daughter of the king even in his old stricken age,</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Satarudra Samhita 3.25.2-14 ”Once while going to the river Pushpabhadra for his ablution, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">the great sage saw the beautiful youthful maiden Padma, a part of Siva herself. Desirious of getting her</span>, the sage traversing the world and an expert in following the established conventions went to the abode of king Anaranya, her father…<span style="color: #ff0000;">The sage repeated the request, saying ”Give me your daughter devoutly. </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Otherwise I will reduce everything to ashes along with you</span>.”…Then the king was much frightened and he lamented again and again. <span style="color: #ff0000;">He gave his daughter Padma, fully bedecked in ornaments to the old sage</span>. After marrying her Padma, the daughter of the king and part of Siva, the sage Pippalada joyously took her to his hermitage… <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Then the excellent sage Pippalada, a part of Siva, became a young man by means of his divine sport and sported with that young lady</span>. Ten noble sons, all of them great sons, were born to the sage.” Tr. Board of Scholars, Edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Another Sage named Suci was attracted to the wife of a Rakshasa,</p>
<p>Skanda Purana III.i.11.44-56 ”There was a sage named Suci in that forest. He was engaged in penance and meditation. He was devoted to the study of the Vedas. That lady of excellent complexion went to his hermitage. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">On seeing her the sage became afflicted with erotic passion and he lost all his steadiness and composure</span>. Approaching the beautiful lady, the excellent sage spoke thus: Suci said:- O young lady, welcome to you. O lady of bright smiles, whose wife are you? What is the task for which you have come to this extremely dreadful forest? You are excessively tired. Stay within this hut of mine. On being told thus, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">that lady of beautiful buttocks</span> replied to the sage: ”O sage, I am the wife of a Raksasa named Trivakra. I am Susila by name. I have come to this forest with a desire to gather some flowers. I have no son, O sage. My husband eagerly wishers for a son and hence I have been urged by him, ‘Propititate sage Suci and get a son from him.’ On being directed by my husband thus, I have approached you. Beget a son of me, O sage. Take pity on me.” On being told thus sage Suci spoke to her thus: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">O Susila, I am highly delighted now on seeing you</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fulfil the ocean of the wishes of mine</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">After saying thus the sage sported with her for three days</span>. Then the delighted sage said to Susila of beautiful features: ”<span style="color: #ff0000;">You will have in your womb a very powerful son</span> named Kapalabharana.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>A sage Vedasiras ejaculated seeing an Apsara Suci, not to confuse this Suci as Sage Suci,</p>
<p>Skanda Purana IV.ii.59.19-21 “Formerly there was a sage of great penance named Vedasiras, born in the family of Bhrgu. It was as though he was another embodied form of the Vedas. While that sage was performing the penance, Suci, the most excellent one of the celestial damsels, endowed with beauty and well-shaped limbs came into his view. Merely at her sight the mind of the sage became extremely agitated. He had an emission of semen immediately. The excellent celestial damsel became frightened.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>The sage said that semen should not go waste hence she must swallow it. So she swallowed the semen and became pregnant with a baby girl and the sage named her Dhutapapa.</p>
<p>Leave aside those Rishis getting aroused on seeing beautiful girls, an old sage named Saubhari was aroused just by seeing the sexual intercourse of fishes,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 9.6.39-43 ”Saubhari Ṛṣi was engaged in austerity, deep in the water of the river Yamuna, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">when he saw a pair of fish engaged in sexual affairs. Thus he perceived the pleasure of sex life</span>, and induced by this desire he went to King Mandhata and begged for one of the King’s daughters. In response to this request, the King said, “O brahmaṇa, any of my daughters may accept any husband according to her personal selection.” Saubhari Muni thought: <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">I am now feeble because of old age</span>. My hair has become grey, my skin is slack, and my head always trembles. Besides, I am a yogi. Therefore women do not like me. Since the King has thus rejected me, I shall reform my body in such a way as to be desirable even to celestial women, what to speak of the daughters of worldly kings. Thereafter, when Saubhari Muni became quite a young and beautiful person, the messenger of the palace took him inside the residential quarters of the princesses, which were extremely opulent. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">All fifty princesses then accepted him as their husband, although he was only one man</span>.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>When the Sages possessing mystic powers can do these things then why can’t a normal Brahmin do the same?</p>
<p>Brahma Purana 120.120-122. ”The Siddha roamed over the earth as he pleased. The excellent lady Urvasi went to Varanasi and took her bath in the waters of Matsyodari assuming her divine form. This foolish Brahman too had gone to the river Matsyodari. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">On seeing Urvasi bathing there he was overwhelmed by passionate love that agitated him too much</span>.” Tr. Board of Scholars, Edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>An old-aged Brahmin was so aroused that he ordered his sons to get a woman to satisfy him,</p>
<p>Padma Purana II.1.28-30 ”Having ordered the glorious one, devoted to this father, the brahmana (i.e. Sivasarman), thinking of the second son, called (him viz.) Vedasarman (and said to him): <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">”Go by my order; being stuperfied by passion of love (i.e. sex) I cannot stand without a woman (by my side).</span>” He presented, by means of his magical power, a woman full of all charm (before Vedasarman). (He told him:0 ”O boy, determined for me, bring this woman to me.” Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p>A sage named Ruru also lusted after a youthful girl,</p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 2.8.24-49 ”…the chief <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Apsara Menaka held sexual intercourse with Visvavasu Gandharva</span> on the banks of a river and became pregnant. She went out from that place to the hermitage of Sthulakes’a on the river bank and gave birth to a very beautiful daughter. Seeing this girl quite an orphan and very beautiful, the Muni Sthulakes’a began to rear up her and named her Pramadvara. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">This all-auspicious girl Pramadvara attained youth in due course when the Muni Ruru saw her and became smitten with passion</span>.” Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>

<h2><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Bizarre Birth</span></h2>
<p>The prime minister of India Narender Modi said that there must have been some plastic surgeon who fixed the head of an elephant to Ganesha and started the practice of plastic surgery. Well, there were many more ‘Scientific’ techniques used by Hindu gods and sages to procreate children. We only know about test-tube babies and surrogate babies, but there were many kinds of babies especially pot babies in ancient India.</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 3.20.23 ”<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Lord Brahmā then gave birth to the demons from his buttocks</span>, and they were very fond of sex. Because they were too lustful, they approached him for copulation.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Forget buttocks, babies can be born from male organs too,</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Rudra Samhita 2, Yudha Khanda 5, Ch 14.1”It is by repeating this mantra that Sukra came out of the belly of <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Siva through the penis</span>, like the powerful semen.” Tr. Board of Scholars, Edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana I.2.8.25 Since the lord [Brahma] created the Asuras at night from his loins through the vital breaths, and as they were born during the night, they are invincible during the night.</p>

<p>Drinking semen can also lead to pregnancy,</p>
<p>Mahabharata 1.3 ”…The Rishi thus addressed, answered Janamejaya, ‘O Janamejaya, this my son, deep in ascetic devotions, accomplished in the study of the Vedas, and endued with the full force of my asceticism, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">is born of (the womb of) a she-snake that had drunk my vital fluid</span>…” Tr.

<p>Vishnu Purana 4.2.13-17 “Yuvanaswa had no son, at which he was deeply grieved. Whilst residing in the vicinage of the holy Munis, he inspired them with pity for his childless condition, and they instituted a religious rite to procure him progeny. One night during its performance the sages having placed a vessel of consecrated water upon the altar had retired to repose. It was past midnight, when the king awoke, exceedingly thirsty; and unwilling to disturb any of the holy inmates of the dwelling, he looked about for something to drink. In his search he came to the water in the jar, which had been sanctified and endowed with prolific efficacy by sacred texts, and he drank it. When the Munis rose, and found that the water had been drunk, they inquired who had taken it, and said, “The queen that has drunk this water shall give birth to a mighty and valiant son.” “It was I,” exclaimed the Raja, “who unwittingly drank the water!” <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">and accordingly in the belly of Yuvanaswa was </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">conceived a child, and it grew, and in due time it ripped open the right side of the Raja, and was born</span>, and the Raja, did not die…” Tr.

<h2><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Gods and Rishis Ejaculating</span></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1557" height="1713" class="wp-image-8859 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Kama-Baba-Rishis-ejaculated.jpeg" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Kama-Baba-Rishis-ejaculated.jpeg 1557w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Kama-Baba-Rishis-ejaculated-273x300.jpeg 273w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Kama-Baba-Rishis-ejaculated-768x845.jpeg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Kama-Baba-Rishis-ejaculated-1396x1536.jpeg 1396w" sizes="(max-width: 1557px) 100vw, 1557px" /></p>
<p>We hear from Hindus about how pious Rishis were, that they practiced celibacy and didn’t even marry. This is not true, Gods had many wives and almost all Rishis were married and had children. Leave aside marriage, Rishis even in their old stricken age were so sexually aroused that just a sight of a beautiful girl resulted in emission of semen. Some of the Sages include seven main Rishis like Bhardvaja, Kratu, Vasista, Gautama, etc. I will start by mentioning stories of Gods and later of Rishis,</p>
<p><strong>SHIVA</strong></p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 8.12.32-33 “Just as a maddened bull elephant follows a female elephant who is able to conceive pregnancy, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Lord Siva followed the beautiful woman and discharged semen</span>, even though his discharge of semen never goes in vain. O King, where so ever on the surface of the globe <span style="color: #ff0000;">fell the semen of the great personality of Lord Siva, mines of gold and silver later appeared</span>.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Shiva is considered the ascetic god, I wonder what kind of asceticism is this? Due to this emission of Shiva’s semen, the monkey god Hanuman was also born which is explained in Adultery Section. Shiva was so maddened about Mohini that he followed her in a fully nude state and even ejaculated. It is said that this happened before Parvati the wife of Shiva and her head was lowered in shame because her husband was lusting after another woman in her presence. This chapter of Srimad Bhagavatam is briefly explained in the LGBT Section.</p>
<p><strong>BRAHMA</strong></p>
<p>Brahma ejaculated seeing the face of Shiva’s wife,</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Rudra Samhita 2, Sati Khanda 2, chapter 19, verses 26-28 ”Then, O sage, afflicted by the cupid and delighted in the heart of hearts, I [Brahma] lifted her veil and stared into the face of Sati. I looked at the face of Sati many a time. I was helpless in curbing the onset of a sensuous organism. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Four drops of my semen virile got displaced and fell on the ground</span> like drops of dew as a result of staring into her face.”, Tr. Board of Scholars, Edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>This story is also supported by Brahma Purana Gautami-Mahatmya 3.15. As we all know Brahma was an old man, he is sometimes considered the grandfather. But this grandfather couldn’t even resist his lust for his granddaughter. He discharged semen after seeing the face of Sati the wife of Shiva. Shiva came to know about this and he was so agitated that he was about to kill Brahma. But Brahma later repented and begged for forgiveness. Then Shiva forgave Brahma. Isn’t it ironic that Shiva became angry just because Brahma ejaculated on seeing his wife but Shiva had no problem at all commanding Vishnu to rape the chaste lady named Vrinda (Tulsi)? As we have already read that even Shiva ejaculated on seeing Mohini (Vishnu), Shiva even tried to seduce sages’ wives after appearing naked, and as per Mahabharata, he had sex with wives and daughters of Rishis in the Daruvanam forest. When Shiva can do all these shameless things then why get angry when someone else does the same thing with your wife? Hindu gods did the same act, again and again, they did not consider it to be wrong. Brahma is said to have ejaculated on seeing the wives of gods, Apsaras, and other women,</p>
<p>Vayu Purana, Part 2, 4.29-31 ”The brilliantly shining goddess Earth, the quarters, the intermediate quarters, the Lords of quarters, the celestial virgins, the wives of Devas, the mothers and Ayu all these were present there in embodied form in front of the Lord (Brahma) who was performing the Yajna assuming the form of Varuna. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">On seeing the ladies, the semen virile of Svayambhu fell</span> on the ground…” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Brahma Khanda 11-20 ”This Khma who wields the following arrows, namely, killing. stupifying, soporific, emaciating and maddening, experimentally discharged the arrrows on all and, at the desire of the Supreme Being every one was excited with lust. To crown all, the great anchorite, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Brahma looked with wistful eyes at Rati and immediately his semen was discharged</span>…” Tr. Rajendra Nath Sen</p>
<p>Brahma is said to have ejaculated seeing Amogha the wife of sage Santanu,</p>
<p>Padma Purana Section 1 Sṛṣṭi-khaṇḍa, Chapter 55, verses 16b-18a. “<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The grandsire of all the worlds, after seeing Amoghā, ejaculated</span>. From that is said to be the rise of Lauhitya. It purifies all people. It is full of all sacred places; resorting to which a man goes to the healthy world of Brahmā.” Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p>This story is further elaborated in the Niyoga section. Brahma had again ejaculated on seeing a nymph,</p>
<p>Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Krishna Janma Khanda 131.2-10 Subsequently at that place nymphs who had sprung out of the body of Visnu and who were the digits of Visnu began to dance and chant Visnu’s hymns in a melodious tone. <span style="color: #ff0000;">The paternal grandfather Brahma, observing their hard buttocks, thick spherical breasts</span> and smiling lotus faces, was excited with passion. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">He could not control his heart; his semen was discharged</span>; and out of shame he concealed it on the ground with his cloth. O Saunaka, after the music was over, he threw the semen along with the cloth rendered hot by lust into the sea of milk.” Tr. Rajendra Nath Sen</p>
<p>Is it befitting for gods to watch semi-naked and full-naked girls dancing? This gathering was also attended by Agni and he is also said to have discharged his semen and tried to hide it similarly.</p>
<p><strong>AGNI</strong></p>
<p>Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Krishna Janma Khanda 131.34-38 Once upon a time, all the gods having assembled in the council of the gods, the celestial whores busied themselves with dancing and singing. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">On that occasion, the fire-god (having seen Rambha with graceful buttocks), was excited with passion and discharged his semen</span>…” Tr. Rajendra Nath Sen</p>
<p>Rambha was an Apsara (Nymph) she was also the concubine of the King of Gods Indra. What can be said about such gods who are so lecherous?</p>
<p><strong>MITRA AND VARUNA</strong></p>
<p>Mitra and Varuna are said to have ejaculated on seeing Apsara Urvashi,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 6.18.6 ”<span style="color: #ff0000;">Upon seeing Urvasi, the celestial society girl, both Mitra and Varuṇa discharged semen</span>, which they preserved in an earthen pot. The two sons Agastya and Vasiṣṭha later appeared from that pot, and they are therefore the common sons of Mitra and Varuṇa. Mitra begot three sons in the womb of his wife, whose name was Revatī. Their names were Utsarga, Ariṣṭa and Pippala.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>This story is also supported by Rig Veda 7.33.1 and Nirukta 5.13. All these gods and Rishis had such a unique technique of begetting sons from a pot. Now it may help Hindu fanatics who say Science in ancient India was at its peak and Ganesha’s head was really fixed by a plastic surgeon, they can claim that pot babies were actually test-tube babies.</p>
<p><strong>RISHIS</strong></p>
<p>When gods can do such acts then why can’t sages do the same? Rishi Bhardvaja is said to have ejaculated on seeing an Apsara (nymph) named Ghritachi, the old Rishi Bhardwaja went to Ganga to perform ablutions, and the nymph Ghritaci too had gone there to perform holy rites which includes dipping into Ganges river, Seeing her wet body and disheveled dress the Rishi was aroused and out of desire his semen came out,</p>
<p>Mahabharata 1.131.1-9 “Vaisampayana said, ‘There dwelt at the source of the Ganga, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">a great sage named Bharadwaja</span>, ceaselessly observing the most rigid vows. One day, of old, intending to celebrate the Agnihotra sacrifice he went along with many great Rishis to the Ganga to perform his ablutions. Arrived at the bank of the stream, he saw Ghritachi herself, that Apsara endued with youth and beauty, who had gone there a little before. With an expression of pride in her countenance, mixed with a voluptuous languor of attitude, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the damsel rose from the water after her ablutions were over. And as she was gently treading on the bank,</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">her attire which was loose became disordered. Seeing her attire disordered, the sage was smitten with burning desire. The next moment his vital fluid came out</span>, in consequence of the violence of his emotion. The Rishi immediately held it in a vessel called a Drona. Then, O king, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Drona sprang from the fluid thus preserved in that vessel by the wise Bharadwaja</span>. And the child thus born studied all the Vedas and their branches.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>This story is also mentioned in Mahabharata 1.168. Another Rishi named Vyasa had ejaculated on seeing Ghritachi but this didn’t occur at the Ganges river,</p>
<p>Srimad Devi Bhagavatam 1.14.1-70 ”…<span style="color: #ff0000;">The Muni Vyasa </span>Deva tried his best and exerted his power of patience to its utmost, <span style="color: #ff0000;">but failed to control his restless mind to enjoy the woman</span>. Though he was very energetic, and he tried repeatedly to control his heart, <span style="color: #ff0000;">enchanted with the beautiful form of Ghritachi</span>, yet he could not, as due to a state of things pre-ordained by God, control his mind. At this state, when he was rubbing the fire sticks to get the sacred fire, the two pieces of wood used in kindling the fire, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">his seed (semen) fell upon the Arani</span> (the two pieces of wood used in kindling the sacred fire). But he did not take any notice of that, and he went on rubbing the firesticks when arose from that Arana the wonderfully beautiful form of S’uka deva<span style="color: #ff0000;">, looking like a second Vyasa. This boy, born of Arana fuel</span>, looked there brilliant like the blazing fire of the sacrificial place, whereon oblations of ghee are poured… ” Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>This story is also mentioned in Narada Purana II.58.19-27 and Mahabharata 12.325. A Rishi named Vibhandaka had also discharged his semen when he spotted a beautiful woman near a lake,</p>
<p>Mahabharata 3.110.34-35 ”And that son of Kasyapa, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Vibhandaka, having proceeded to a big lake</span>, devoted himself to the practice of penances. And that same saint, comparable to a god, laboured for a long period. And once while he was washing his mouth in the waters, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">he beheld the celestial nymph Urvasi–whereupon came out his seminal fluid</span>.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>There is a story of another sage named Mankana who was the son of Kashyap, He ejaculated seeing Apsara Rambha while both were taking bath,</p>
<p>Vamana Purana, Satomahatmya 17.2-5 “Lomaharsana said The sage Mankana was the mind-born son of Kasyapa. He was ready to bathe with his valkala in his hand. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">There came Rambha taking good, bright and charming other Apsarases and began to take their bath by his side. At this due to excitement of passion his semen dropped in the water</span>. The great sage collected that semen in a jar. That semen in the jar became differentiated into seven portions. Out of them were born seven Rsis who are known as the Marut hosts.” Tr. Anand Swarup Gupta</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">A Rishi named Vibhandaka had also discharged his semen when he spotted a beautiful woman near a lake,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Mahabharata 3.110.34-35 “And that son of Kasyapa, Vibhandaka, having proceeded to a big lake, devoted himself to the practice of penances. And that same saint, comparable to a god, laboured for a long period. And once while he was washing his mouth in the waters, </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000; font-size: 12pt;">he beheld the celestial nymph Urvasi–whereupon came out his seminal fluid</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</span></p>
<p>This proves that women who go to Banaras (Vanarasi) for pilgrimage are not safe from the lustful Hindu priests. The Hindu priests would have no problem watching lustfully the wet bodies of women as they are aware of what their greatest Rishis did. There is another version of this story mentioned in Mahabharata,</p>
<p>Mahabharata 9.38 “Listen now to a great feat of Mankanaka, who had from his youth led the life of a brahmacari. While employed in performing his ablutions in the river, <span style="color: #ff0000;">he beheld </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">(one day), O Bharata, a woman of faultless limbs</span> and fair brows, bathing in the river at will, her person uncovered. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">At this sight, O monarch, the vital seed of the Rishi fell unto the Sarasvati</span>. The great ascetic took it up and placed it within his earthen pot. Kept within that vessel, the fluid became divided into seven parts. From those seven portions were born seven Rishis from whom sprang the (nine and forty) Maruts.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Just like Rishi Mankanaka another Rishi named Dadhica had emitted his semen into the river Sarasvati after seeing Apsara Alambusa,</p>
<p>Mahabharata 9.51.5-9 “In days of yore, O monarch, there was an intelligent sage of great ascetic merit. He was celebrated by the name of Dadhica. Possessing a complete control over his senses, he led the life of a brahmacari…At last the chastiser of Paka, for tempting the sage, despatched unto him the exceedingly beautiful and celestial apsara, by name Alambusa. Thither where on the banks of the Sarasvati the high souled sage was engaged in the act of gratifying the gods, the celestial damsel named above, O monarch, made her appearance. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Beholding that damsel of beautiful limbs, the vital seed of that ascetic of cleansed soul came out</span>.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>There is a story mentioned about a father and his son who were archers, they were descendants of Rishi,</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 50.10 “<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">At the sight of a nymph, Satyadhriti cast his seed </span>in a pool of water, out of which, one son and a daughter were born.” Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, Edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>Like Father like Son,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 9.21.35 “The son of Satananda was Satyadhṛti, who was expert in archery, and the <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">son of Satyadhṛti was Saradvan</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">When Saradvan met Urvasi, he discharged semen</span>, which fell on a clump of sara grass. From this semen were born two all-auspicious babies, one male and the other female.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>This is also mentioned in Vayu Purana,</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Vayu Purana 37.196-8 &#8220;&#8230;Ahalya bore Satananda the excellent sage to Saradvata. His son was Satyadhrti of great fame. He was a master of the science of archery. On seeing an Apsaras (celestial damsel) in front, the semen virile of Satyadhrti was emitted in the bush of Sara grass and twins were born.&#8221; G.V Tagare</span></p>
<p>Kratus had also done this act,</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Rudra Samhita 2, Sati Khanda 2, Ch 3, verse 51-55 ”From the drops of sweat that fell from Daksa’s body, a splendid woman endowed with good qualities was born. She was of slender body with symmetrical hips. Her waist was well shaped; small curly hairs embellished it. She was soft in body with fine teeth. She had a shining golden complexion. In her body, she was perfect. Her face shone like the full moon and full blown lotus. Her name was Rati. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">She was capable of captivating even the sages</span>. Excepting Kratu, Vasistha, Pulastya and Angiras the six viz. Marici and others successfully curbed their senses and their activities. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">O excellent sage, the semen virile of the four Kratu and others fell on the ground</span> from which other types of manes were born.” Tr. Board of Scholars, Edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>A sage named Suparsva had emitted his semen after he spotted a Rakshasi girl,</p>
<p>Varaha Purana 95.18-20 ”There a young and beautiful Raksasa girl by name Indumati, bathing naked, was seen by this sage. Then he had an emission which he dropped in a stony crevice at the river (and it got mixed with water).” Tr. Venitasubramonia Iyer, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>A Sudra woman named Kalavati wife of Drumila went to Kashyapa Rishi for contracting Niyoga. But Kashyap Rishi didn’t contract Niyoga with her as he feared that he may lose his status if he engages in sexual intercourse with a Shudra woman. But an Apsara was passing by, seeing the Apsara the Rishi ejaculated,</p>
<p>Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Brahma Kanda 20.33-46 ”…At that time, Menaka was passing by that way, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">At the sight of her thigh and breast the semen of the saint was discharged</span>. Thereupon the woman Kalavati drank it cheerfully, went to her husband, bowed to him and told him everything about, her pregnancy…” Tr. Rajendra Nath Sen</p>
<p>Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Brahma Khanda 20.12-20 ”Santi replied, At Kanauj one Drumila had a barren wife named Kalavati devoted to her husband. She was barren through the faults of her husband. By the command of her husband she once upon a time went to Kasyapa Muni who dwelt in a forest…. [21-32] The Muni addressed her thus ‘Who are you in this solitary forest? Whose wife are you? Why have you come here… ”O best of the twice born aint I he daughter of a cow herd, the wife of Drumila. By the command of my husband. I have come to you as I desire to have a son. Kindly impregnate me. You should not slight a woman who has come to you voluntarily…” Tr. Rajendra Nath Sen</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Rishi Devarata was sitting on the bank of a river in a forest named Kamyaka, seeing naked Apsara Menaka the Rishi ejaculated, </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Skanda Purana VI.29.36-47 &#8220;In the meanwhile, at the advent of spring season, Meanaka, the excellent Apsara (celestial woman), happened to come to the mortal world. In course of her wandering, she reached the excellent forest named Kamyaka&#8230;It was there </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">that the tiger among sages, remembered as Devarata, stayed&#8230;Once he was sitting on the bank of the river. The celestial damsel of excellent complexion was distressed due to the heat of the sun. Even as the sage was watching she disrobed herself revealing her exquisitely divine features and entered the water. On seeing the lady of excellent limbs diving into the water expanse, instantly the leading sage involuntarily discharged his semen. In the meantime an extremely thirsty doe came there. The water of the river with which the semen of the sage had got mixed was completely drunk up by her. By the power of the sage whose semen could never be futile, the doe conceived a human foetus&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Ganesh Vasudeo Tagare</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Devas sending Apsaras to seduce Rishis</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Gods were a</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">lways afraid of sages, that the sages</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> may attain the status of god</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">hood</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> or higher than that through their penances thus few Gods </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">especially Indra </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">sent Apsaras to seduce them and to interrupt their penance. A sage named Kandu was seduced by an Apsara named Pramlocha. And both of them enjoyed each other for hundreds of years, </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Vishnu Purana 1.50.11-15 “…There was formerly (said Soma) a sage named Kandu, eminent in holy wisdom, who practised pious austerities on the lovely borders of the Gomati river. The king of the gods sent the nymph Pramlocha to disturb his penance, and the sweet-smiling damsel diverted the sage from his devotions. They lived together, in the valley of Mandara, </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000; font-size: 12pt;">for a hundred and fifty years; during which, the mind of the Muni was wholly given up to enjoyment</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">…” Tr. H.H. Wilson</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">This is also mentioned in Srimad Bhagavatam 4.30.13.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><br />
A sage named Devadutta was pe</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">r</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">forming penance and Indra feared that the sage may replace h</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">im from his status so to stop the sage’</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">s penance he sent a</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">n Apsara to interrupt the</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> penance,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Varaha Purana 145.29-35 “Hearing that music beautiful with the Pancama svara the mind of the sage became perturbed. Kamadeva tirelessly shot his arrows again on him…Hit by the arrows of Kamadeva, the great sage appraoched her with a smile. She too looked at him amorously but with shyness. Attracting the mind of the sage with her irresistible charms, she continued to play the ball unmindful of flowers falling from her dishevelling hair. At that time the Malaya wind blew off her garment freeing it from its knot and the girdle holding it…[40-1] The he held that smiling damsel by the right hand. He embraced her and gave her delight. Day and night he enjoyed with her every pleasure helped by the power he had acquired by his penence.” Tr. Venkitasubramonia Iyer, edited by J.L. Shastri</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Vishwamitra was performing penance for a very long time, Indra being afraid that Vishwamitra may replace him as the king of god ordered Menaka to seduce Vishwamitra and interrupt his penance, Indra also ordered Maruts (i.e., winds) to help Menaka in the task, Menaka was successful in seducing Vishwamitra and their sexual union gave birth to a </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">daughter named Shakuntala. Shakuntala was abandoned and she was raised by Kanwa hence she came to be regarded as the daughter of Kanwa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Mahabharata, Adi Parva 1, Section 71, verses 20-26 “Viswamitra, of old, having been engaged in the austerest penances alarmed Indra, the chief of the celestials, who thought that the mighty ascetic of blazing energy would, by his penances, hurl him down from his high seat in heaven.&#8217; Indra, thus alarmed, summoned Menaka and told her, &#8216;Thou, O Menaka, art the first of celestial Apsaras. Therefore, O amiable one, do me this service. Hear what I say. This great ascetic Viswamitra like unto the Sun in splendour, is engaged in the most severe of penances. My heart is trembling with fear. Indeed, O slender-waisted Menaka, this is thy business. Thou must see that Viswamitra of soul rapt in contemplation and engaged in the austerest penances, who might hurl me down from my seat. Go and tempt him and frustrating his continued austerities accomplish my good. Win him away from his penances, O beautiful one, by tempting him with thy beauty, youth, agreeableness, arts, smiles and speech.” Tr. Kisari Mohan Ganguli</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Mahabharata, Adi Parva 1, section 72, verses 1-10 “Kanwa continued, &#8216;And Sakra, thus addressed by her, then commanded him who could approach every place (viz., the god of the wind) to be present with Menaka at the time she would be before the Rishi. And the timid and beautiful Menaka then entered the retreat and saw there Viswamitra who had burnt, by his penances, all his sins, and was engaged still in ascetic penances. And saluting the Rishi, she then began to sport before him. And just at that time Marut robbed her of her garments that were white as the Moon. And she thereupon ran, as if in great bashfulness, to catch hold of her attire, and as if she was exceedingly annoyed with Marut. And she did all this before the very eyes of Viswamitra who was endued with energy like that of fire. And Viswamitra saw her in that attitude. And beholding her divested of her robes, he saw that she was of faultless feature. And that best of Munis saw that she was exceedingly handsome, with no marks of age on her person. And beholding her beauty and accomplishments that bull amongst Rishis was possessed with lust and made a sign that he desired her companionship. And he invited her accordingly, and she also of faultless features expressed her acceptance of the invitation. And they then passed a long time there in each other&#8217;s company. And sporting with each other, just as they pleased, for a long time as if it were only a single day, the Rishi begat on Menaka a daughter named Sakuntala. And Menaka (as her conception advanced) went to the banks of the river Malini coursing along a valley of the charming mountains of Himavat. And there she gave birth to that daughter. And she left the new-born infant on the bank of that river and went away.” Tr. Kisari Mohan Ganguli</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Mahabharata, Shalya Parva 9, section 51, verses 5-10 “Vaishampayana continued, &#8220;In days of yore, O monarch, there was an intelligent sage of great ascetic merit.

Beholding that damsel of beautiful limbs, the vital seed of that ascetic of cleansed soul came out. It fell into the Sarasvati, and the latter held it with care. Indeed, O bull among men, the River, beholding that seed, held it in her womb. In time the seed developed into a foetus and the great river held it so that it might be inspired with life as a child.

<h2><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Adultery/Fornication with Women</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Gods and Rishis had illicit relationship</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">s</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> with several women. Gods and sages had no problem committing adultery with several women, As we read the words of Indra who calls himself ‘Master in Sexual Science’, Shiva and Krishna were also considered ‘Lusty’. Committing adu</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">ltery is a matter of shame for</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> religious leaders and </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">devout </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">people but for Hindu gods and sages</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">,</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> it was a matter of pride and enjoyment. One of the most popular </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">gods</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> among these is Krishna who was considered a womanizer by his rivals. </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Rishi Durvasa, an Apsara as well as Hindu god encourages adultery, </span></p>

<p><strong>VISHNU</strong></p>
<p>Vishnu as well as his Mohini avatar addresses Brahma in the following way,</p>
<p>Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Krishna Janma Khanda 33.1-11 ”…Then Mohini ridiculed him saying ”O Lord, a being who, allured only by hints from a woman, drags her to his side and enjoys her society is regarded as the best person. Whoever having clearly perceived the intentions of a woman commits sexual intercourse with a woman after he is entreated by her to do so is regarded as the second best. And a wretch who being entreated by a passionate woman fails to commit sexual intercourse with her even in solitude does not deserve to be called a man but a eunuch…” Tr. Rajendra Nath Sen</p>
<p>Brahma Vaivarata Purana, Krishna Janma Khanda, 33.47-63 “Hari smiled when he heard all this and addressed him with words, delightful, substantial, truthful and beneficial to the world thus: “O Brahma, you are conversant with the Vedas. You are chief of the spiritual guides of the learned; and yet you have performed and act which cannot be committed by a murderer. Why did you subdue your passions? Nay, even in India, if a woman excited with passion accidently appears before a man and desires his company, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">the latter, even if dispassionate, should not reject her offer</span>. If he rejects her offer, he is defrauded in several ways in this world and goes to hell in the next world…” Tr. Rajendra Nath Sen</p>
<p>A Hindu Purana proves how lecherous Hindu gods were, not to confuse Srimad Devi Bhagavatam as Srimad Bhagavatam (Bhagavad Purana),</p>
<p>Srimad Devi Bhagavatam 4.13.11-13. “O Giver of honour! When all the Devas, Vas’istha, Vâmadeva, Vis’vamitrâ, Brihaspatî  and other ascetic Munis get themselves overpowered by lust and anger, when their intelligence gets destroyed by covetousness and avarice, when they are addicted to vices and are expert in fraud, pre-text and trickery, then what fate, alas! can you expect of Dharma and what help is there of any religious persons! Alas! lndra, Agni, Moon, and Brahmâ when these get overpowered by the strong influence of lust, are in illicit love with others’ wives, where is the goodness and virtuous behavior in this Trilokî?” Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p><strong>KRISHNA</strong></p>
<p>Hindu apologists are masters of deceit and lies, they invent lies in such a clean manner that it deceives the gullible people. One such deceit is in defending the acts of Krishna. They say Krishna and Gopis were playing together when they were kids and in the play, Krishna and Gopis circumambulated the fire hence those 16008 Gopis accidentally became the wives of Krishna. Another rebuttal made by apologists is that, those 16008 girls belonged to a lower caste and were captured by a demon when Krishna defeated the Demon he married them to uplift their status.</p>
<p>All these explanations are wrong, the second explanation is true to an extent. Krishna did liberate girls from a demon and later married them, but those were only sixteen thousand and one hundred (16,100) girls and were all royal Princesses belonging to the Kshatriya caste.</p>
<p>Linga Purana section 1.69.82 “The excessively strong one, of unequalled exploit, Krsna took up sixteen thousand one hundred girls for his own pleasure.” Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 10.59.33 ”There Lord Kṛṣṇa saw <span style="color: #ff0000;">sixteen thousand </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">royal maidens</span>, whom Bhauma had taken by force from various kings.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 10.59.42 ”Then the imperishable Supreme Personality, assuming a separate form for each bride, duly married all the princesses simultaneously, each in her own palace.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Swami Prabhupada writes,</p>
<p>”<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">There were 16,100 beautiful girls who were daughters of many kings</span> and were forcibly stolen by Bhaumasura, who kept them captive for his carnal desire. These girls prayed piteously to Lord Kṛṣṇa for their deliverance, and the merciful Lord, called by their fervent prayer, released them all by fighting and killing Bhaumāsura. All these captive princesses were then accepted by the Lord as His wives…” A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada on Srimad Bhagavatam 1.10.29 [ <a href="http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_1.10.29" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_1.10.29<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> ]
<p>So those were 16,100 Princess and later Krishna married additional 8 wives on various occasions,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 10.58.55 Lord Devakī-suta, the chief of the Yadus, then took His dowry and Satyā to Dvārakā and continued to live there happily.</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 10.58.56 Bhadrā was a princess of the Kaikeya kingdom and the daughter of Lord Kṛṣṇa’s paternal aunt Śrutakīrti. The Lord married Bhadrā when her brothers, headed by Santardana, offered her to Him.</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 10.58.57 Then the Lord married Lakṣmaṇā, the daughter of the King of Madra. Kṛṣṇa appeared alone at her svayaṁvara ceremony and took her away, just as Garuḍa once stole the demigods’ nectar.</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 10.58.58 Lord Kṛṣṇa also acquired thousands of other wives equal to these when He killed Bhaumāsura and freed the beautiful maidens the demon was holding captive.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 10.58.31 My dear King, Lord Kṛṣṇa forcibly took away Princess Mitravindā, the daughter of His aunt Rājādhidevī, before the eyes of the rival kings. Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 1.10.29 ”The children of these ladies are Pradyumna, Sāmba, Amba, etc. Ladies like Rukmiṇī, Satyabhāmā and Jāmbavatī were forcibly taken away by Him from their svayaṁvara ceremonies after He defeated many powerful kings, headed by Śiśupāla. And other ladies were also forcibly taken away by Him after He killed Bhaumāsura and thousands of his assistants. All of these ladies are glorious.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Srimad Devi Bhagavatam 4.24.41-42 ”Afterwards He [Krishna] brought also Jâmbavatî, Satyabhâmâ, Mitravindâ, Kâlindî, Lak<span style="text-decoration: underline;">s</span>manâ, Bhadrâ, and auspicious Nâgnajitî (the daughter of the king Nagnajit) <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">on various occasions and married them. O Lord of the earth! These eight women were the best and most beautiful of S’rî Krisna’s wives</span>.” Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Krishna married Rukmini after abducting her in a Rakshasa form of marriage which is described in Hindu scriptures as Rukmini herself wanted this to happen and later when Rukmi the brother of Rukmini came to know about it he fought Krishna to get back his sister,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 10.54.32-33 “<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Seeing Lord Kṛṣṇa ready to kill her brother, saintly Rukmiṇī was filled with alarm</span>. She fell at her husband’s feet and piteously spoke as follows. Śrī Rukmiṇī said: O controller of all mystic power, immeasurable one, Lord of lords, master of the universe! O all auspicious and mighty-armed one, please do not kill my brother” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 10.54.35 “Lord Kṛṣṇa tied up the evil-doer with a strip of cloth. He then proceeded to disfigure Rukmī by comically shaving him, leaving parts of his mustache and hair. By that time the Yadu heroes had crushed the extraordinary army of their opponents, just as elephants crush a lotus flower.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 4.24.40 “At the marriage ceremony of S’is’upâla, at the palace of the king of Vidarbha, Janârdan Visnu carried away by force Rukminî, the bride elect from the Svayambara assembly (where  the husband is self elected by the bride herself) and <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">afterwards married her according to the rule called Râkhsasa Vidhi </span>(one of the eight forms of marriage in Hindu Law in which a girl is forcibly seized and carried away after the defeat or destruction of her relatives in battle).” Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Krishna had also beaten up Mitravinda’s brother before marrying her,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 10.83.12 “Śrī Mitravindā said: At my svayaṁvara ceremony He came forward, defeated all the kings present — including my brothers, who dared insult Him — and took me away just as a lion removes his prey from amidst a pack of dogs. Thus Lord Kṛṣṇa, the shelter of the goddess of fortune, brought me to His capital city. May I be allowed to serve Him by washing His feet, life after life.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Krishna also beat Jambavati’s father before marrying her, Jambavati after fighting Krishna for 27 days presented his daughter to Krishna,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 10.83.10 “Śrī Jāmbavatī said: Unaware that Lord Kṛṣṇa was none other than his own master and worshipable Deity, the husband of Goddess Sītā, my father fought with Him for twenty-seven days. When my father finally came to his senses and recognized the Lord, he took hold of His feet and presented Him with both me and the Syamantaka jewel as tokens of his reverence. I am simply the Lord’s maidservant.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Krishna married 16,100 princesses after liberating them from a demon and he also married eight other princesses on various occasions. Apart from 16,108 wives, Krishna had several hundred or thousands of concubines/girlfriends, they were mostly Gopis the milk-maids. Among all, Krishna’s favourite girlfriend was Radha who was his maternal aunt, it is uncertain whether Krishna married her or not but many major sources don’t speak anything about their marriage. Several verses from Purana show that his concubines/girlfriends known as Gopis (milk-maids) had husbands and even children,</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 5.13.55-61 “The Gopis repeatedly exclaimed, “Bravo, Krishna!” to his song. When leading, they followed him; when returning, they encountered him; and, whether he went forwards or backwards, they ever attended on his steps. Whilst frolicking thus with the Gopis, they considered every instant without him a myriad of years; and, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">prohibited in vain by husbands</span>, fathers, brothers, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">they went forth at night to sport with Krishnna</span>, the object of their affection…” Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Gopis addresses Balrama the elder brother of Krishna after Krishna abandoned them,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 10.65.11-12 “For Kṛṣṇa’s sake, O descendant of Dāśārha, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">we abandoned our mothers, fathers, brothers, husbands, children</span> and sisters, even though these family relations are difficult to give up. But now, O Lord, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">that same Kṛṣṇa has suddenly abandoned us and gone away</span>, breaking off all affectionate ties with us. And yet how could any woman fail to trust His promises?” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>So this proves that those Gopis were already married and even had children. This shows that apart from 16,108 wives he had illicit relationship with Gopis. I wonder what kind of married woman would leave her husband and children to become a concubine? It may have been that they were forced into concubinage by Krishna. He not just had illicit relations with Gopis but with other independent women too, Krishna had sex with a hunchback woman in her own house,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 10.48.6-7 ”Calling forward His beloved, who was anxious and shy at the prospect of this new contact, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">the Lord pulled her by her bangled hands onto the bed. Thus He enjoyed with that beautiful girl</span>, whose only trace of piety was her having offered ointment to the Lord. — Simply by smelling the fragrance of Kṛṣṇa’s lotus feet, Trivakra cleansed away the burning lust Cupid had aroused in her breasts, chest and eyes. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">With her two arms she embraced between her breasts her lover, Śrī Kṛṣṇa</span>, the personification of bliss, and thus she gave up her long-standing distress.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Krishna Janma Khanda 72.56-69 ”…So saying, Krishna, the asylum of fortune, held the licentious woman to his breast. Made her naked, associated with her and kissed her. Then the hump-backed woman, while relishing the initial sexual intercourse, dragged Krisna to her arms like Kamala and kissed his cheek. Both the pair were particularly proficient in matters relating to sexual intercourse from which they did not desist for a moment. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The intercourse took several forms</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Then Lord Krisna lacerated the rising breast and the loins of the woman with the strokes of his keen nails and her lips with the bite of his teeth</span>. Later on, at day-break, when he passed the semen, the beautiful hump-backed woman in the excess of her enjoyments fainted…” Tr. Rajendra Nath Sen</p>
<p>He had committed fornication with an independent woman named Naradi,</p>
<p>Narada Purana, Uttarabhaga 80.31-32 “When the messengers returned, Naradi was called by the lover of cowherdesses. After bowing down to the lord, she went near him bashfully. The man of taste (Lord Krsna) embraced her, had the sportful dalliance with her and then dismissed her. Gradually she came once again to the lake Puspasaras.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Krishna’s act with Radha</p>
<p>Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Krishna Janma Khanda 127.1-21 ”…Lord Krisna dragged her to his beast and kissed her lips (upper and lower), the chin and both the sides of her cheek. Radha also kissed the handsome lunar face of Krisna and with both her hands pressed Krisna, the Lord of her life, to her bosom. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Lord Krisna committed the desired act of sexual intercourse in sixteen ways as prescribed by the sexual science</span> and calculated to please both man and wife. He lacerated the whole constitution of Radha with marks of nail and bit her lips whereby there was a thrill of raptures in his body and he experienced a feeling of lassitude…” Tr. Rajendra Nath Sen</p>
<p><strong>Sex with other Concubines</strong></p>
<p>Let me show you how this vulgar act of Krishna is praised in the Hindu scripture. And how he used to fornicate with them,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 10.33.16-17 ”In this way Lord Kṛṣṇa, the original Lord Nārāyaṇa, master of the goddess of fortune, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">took pleasure in the company of the young women of Vraja by embracing them, caressing them</span> and glancing lovingly at them as He smiled His broad, playful smiles. It was just as if a child were playing with his own reflection.— Their senses overwhelmed by the joy of having His physical association, <span style="color: #ff0000;">the gopis could not prevent their hair, their dresses and the cloths covering their breasts from becoming disheveled</span>. Their garlands and ornaments scattered, O hero of the Kuru dynasty.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 10.29.45-46 ”Sri Kṛṣṇa went with the gopis to the bank of the Yamuna, where the sand was cooling and the wind, enlivened by the river’s waves, bore the fragrance of lotuses. There Kṛṣṇa threw His arms around the gopīs and embraced them. <span style="color: #ff0000;">He aroused Cupid in the beautiful young ladies of Vraja by touching their hands, hair, </span><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">thighs, belts and </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">breasts</span></strong>, by playfully scratching them with His fingernails, and also by joking with them, glancing at them and laughing with them. In this way the Lord enjoyed His pastimes.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Skanda Purana II.iii.4.17 ”With the tip of his nail with which he had pierced the neck of hyena, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">he pinched the breasts of the cowherd lasses</span>. He has been sportingly given many form by young women. Let this Sesa (?) be for (i.e. bring about) calmness and peace.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Krishna Janma Khanda 46.61-71 ”…On the other hand Siva was also engaged in the sexual act.” Saint Narayana said, ‘Lord Krishna having said so to the glancing, smiling Radha went along with her to the sandal forest…O saint, Radha and the Lord of the sphere became paralysed through the pleasure of sexual intercourse and being intimately associated with one another, they spent their time there…” Tr. Rajendra Nath Sen</p>
<p>Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Krishna Janma Khanda 69.1-11 ”…Lord Krisna who was anxious to enjoy the taste of the Rasa <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">copulated with the clever Radha according to the measure supplied by sixty-four practical arts</span> in the sphere of the Rasa.’ At that time the loins and the spherical breast of Radha were lacerated with the injuries inflicted by the nails of Krisna; the vermillion-mark on the partings of her hairs on the head was obliterated; and her chignon was relaxed. Later on, the naked Radha thrilling with raptures and fainting with the excess of pleasure was harboured by the goddess of sleep.” Tr. Rajendra Nath Sen</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 3.3.21 ”The Lord enjoyed His pastimes, both in this world and in other worlds [higher planets], specifically in the association of the Yadu dynasty. At leisure hours offered by night, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">He enjoyed the friendship of conjugal love with women</span>.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 10.30.33-34 <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Certainly Kṛṣṇa sat down here with His girlfriend</span></p>
<p>to arrange Her hair. <span style="color: #ff0000;">The lusty boy </span>must have made a crown for that lusty girl out of the flowers He had collected. — [Śukadeva Gosvāmī continued:] <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Lord Kṛṣṇa enjoyed with that gopī, although He enjoys only within, being self-satisfied</span> and complete in Himself. Thus by contrast He showed the wretchedness of ordinary lusty men and hardhearted women.<br />
Kurma Purana 1.26.14-16 ”A certain fawn eyed damsel, fascinated by passionate love, approached Krsna and kissed his lotus like face. Catching hold of the hand of Govinda, the first cause of the wordls, a certain girl who was deluded by his Maya, took him to her own house. Assuming multifarious forms sportively, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">the lotus-eyed Lord Krsna fulfilled their desires</span>.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Krishna Janma Khanda 105.1-10 <span style="color: #ff0000;">”He put on her forehead a beautiful mark of vermillion and painted lines of cosmetics on her breast</span>. He also painted the members of her lotus feet with lac dye and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">then with his nails constructed an artificial lotus on her loins and breast</span>. Then Krisna got up and along with Radha went to the local lovely pond fall of water…” Tr. Rajendra Nath Sen</p>
<p>Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Krishna Janma Khanda 52.20-28 ”…There Krisna assumed several forms at once and the sametime and indulged with the cow-herdesses in the sport which enchants licentious people. He held in his embrace the passionate Radha and went up to the temple of lust constructed by the Viswa-Karma. Afterwards at that place he slept with Radha on a bed redolent of the Champaka and annointed her with sandal, aloe, musk and saffron. The lustful Krisna versed in sexual science sported with the licentious Radha in several ways.” Tr. Rajendra Nath Sen</p>
<p>Brahma Vairvarta Purana, Krishna Janma Khanda 29.1-10 ”…Some passionate milk-maid said to Krishna, the lord of her life, ”Krisna, wrap me in your yellow dress.” Someone said to Krisna, the Lord of the universe, ”Lord, apply vermillion to my forehead.” Someone arrived there soon and said, ”Lord, arrange the lock of my hair and bind my chignon.” Some milk-maid bent on her toilet deputed Krisna to fetch sandal foliage for her ear-rings. Someone by mysterious signs explained to him what was passing in her heart and with a face beaming with smiles looked at him soliciting sexual intercourse. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Some milk-maids dragged him by force, snatched from his flute, took away his yellow dress, made him naked and smiled</span></strong>. Some dignified girl said to the conqueror of Madhu, ”Lord, paint the nails of my feet with lac-dye.” Someone said affectionately to him, ”O Lord of my life, paint my cheek and breast with lines of cosmetics of various colours.” Tr. Rajendra Nath Sen</p>
<p>It is mentioned in Brahma Vaivarta Purana Krishna Janma Khanda 53.16-27 that Krishna did all those things mentioned above which the Gopis demanded. He did these shameless act with the milk maids who had husbands and children. It doesn’t behove for a god to act in this manner. The above verse from Brahma Vaivart Purana shows that he was denuded by those milk maids and instead of being embarrassed and feeling guilty he smiled like a shameless person. Can such person be considered a god?</p>
<p><strong>Krishan’s grandson Pradumyna</strong></p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Rudra Samhita 2, Yuddha Khanda section 5, Ch 52, verses 50-53 “Then taking leave of her friend, and knowing him to be the grandson of Ksna, Citralekha got ready to go to Dvaraka with the velocity of the mind…Then in the park of the <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">harem the son of Pradyumna was seen by her playing with women and drinking wine</span>. He was dark complexioned but beautiful in every limb, smiling in the prime of youth.” Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p><strong>SHIVA</strong></p>
<p>In the Mahabharata, Shiva is said to have fornicated with wives and daughters of Rishis,</p>
<p>Mahabharata 13.14.157 “He sports with the daughters and wives of the Rishis. His hair is long and erect. He is perfectly nude for he has the horizon for his dress. He has terrible eyes.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>As per a story from Shiva Purana, Shiva is said to have assumed the form of a merchant to test a prostitute, Shiva had fornicated with the prostitute named Mahananda, I wonder if it was really a test or if he wanted to enjoy on the pretext of the test?</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Satarudra Samhita 3, Chapter 26, verses 1-31 &#8220;O dear sage, listen to me. I shall tell you about Vaiśyanātha, the incarnation of Śiva, the supreme soul that yields great bliss. Formerly, in Nandigrāma there was a prostitute known as Mahānandā. She was very beautiful and a devotee of Śiva. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Once Śiva assumed the form of a merchant</span> and visited her house to test her. He had assumed the auspicious form of a devotee&#8230;The beautiful prostitute worshipped and welcomed the visitor with great joy.

She then went to sleep on the couch brilliant with a soft bed.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Shiva in order “to test” the devotion of a couple, went to their house as a Brahmin guest, the husband Sudarshana had advised his wife to treat their guests well as guests are equivalent to Shiva. Finding that Sudarshana was not in the house, Shiva had sex with the wife of Sudarshana, meanwhile, Sudarshana arrived at his home but Shiva brazenly and shamelessly told him that he is having sex with Sudarshana’s wife, Sudarshana instead of rebuking Shiva was “delighted” and went away.</p>
<p>Linga Purana, Section I, chapter 29, verses 46-64 &#8220;Formerly, a householder known as Sudarsana, vowed to conquer the God of Death. He said to his chaste wife. &#8216;O lady of good holy rites, fine eye-brows and good fortune, listine to what I say, assiduously. Never should you dishonour the guests who visit your gouse. Since everyone of the guests is the Pinaka bearing lord, you should dedicate even your self to the guest and adore him&#8230;O excellent brahmins, in order to test their devotion, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Dharma himself assumed the form of a brahmin</span> and came to the house of the sage&#8230;Dharma disguised as a brahmin said &#8216;O gentle lady where has your noble husband Sudarsana gone? O noble lady, enough of this cooked rice and other eatable! <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">I say, you should dedicate yourself (to me)</span>&#8216; Remembering what had been previously mentioned by her husband that chaste lady full of bashfulness and with closed eyes, began to move (towards him)&#8230;all the same, she made up her mind to dedicate herself to Dharma there itself at the behest of her own husband. In the meantime, Sudarsana, the husband of that lady, came to the threshold and called to her &#8216;Come, come, O gentle lady? Where have you been?&#8217; It was the guest himself who replied to him. &#8216;O Sudarsana, O highly blessed one, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">I am now engaged in sexual intercourse with this wife of yours</span>. What should be done here may kindly be mentioned. O leading brahmin, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">the sexual intercourse is concluded</span>. O excellent brahmin, I am satisfied.&#8217; <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Sudarsana the noble brahmin then said in great delight:- &#8216;O excellent brahmin, enjoy her as you please. I shall go away now</span>.&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edied by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Padma Purana I.56.1-10 states that Shiva saw some beautiful Gandharis, Kinnaras and humans and wanted to have sex with them, he cast a spell on them which dragged them into the sky, where he had sex with them, meanwhile Parvati saw all that and became angry, she assumed a form and assaulted those women, as a result, their faces were disfigured, she also cursed them due to which they became Chandalas.</p>
<p>Padma Purana, Sṛṣṭi-khaṇḍa 1, chapter 56, verses 1-10 &#8220;Formerly, Śarva (i.e. Śaṅkara), having seen youthful and beautiful women of Gandharvas, Kinnaras and human beings, and with <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">his mind set on them</span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">pretended to be intent on practising penance</span>, and with a spell dragged them far away into the sky. Then the great lord, the conqueror of the god of love, having fashioned a very delightful cottage, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">sported (there) with them</span>. In the meanwhile, Gaurī’s mind became excited. By means of meditation she saw the lord of the world, sporting with women. Knowing his intention she became angry. Then taking the form of Kṣemaṅkarī[1], she entered (the sky), and saw, far away in a lonely region of the sky, Hara (i.e. Śiva), whose lustre was like that of the god of love, who was in the midst of beautiful women, who, the best man, was bright, who, having again and again embraced the women, was sporting with them, who was kissing them excessively, and who was tormented by the passion of love. Seeing this, Kṣemaṅkarī, came down&#8230; Dragging them (by seizing) their hair, she angrily kicked them by her foot. All the women reached (i.e. fell on) the ground, and suddenly their faces were disfigured. With their bodies scorched by Umā’s, curse they came under the sway of Mlecchas. Those women, widows or with their husbands alive are known as Cāṇḍāla. Even now they would experience the curse given by Umā.&#8221; Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p><strong>VISHNU</strong></p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Satarudra Samhita 3, 22.45-46 In the meantime Visnu saw those damsels born of nectar sprays who were haughty due to their divine beauty and whose faces resembled the full moon. Fascinated by the cupid’s arrow <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Visnu attained highest pleasure only there. He began to indulge in sexual dalliance with those women</span> of exquisite beauty…” Tr. Board of Scholars, Edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p><strong>KARTIKKEYA</strong></p>
<p>Kartikkeya was the son of Shiva. His mother Parvati told him to enjoy his life as wished. He took advantage of this and started committing adultery with the wives of gods. Many heaven dwellers tried to stop him but he didn’t so they requested Parvati to do something. Urged by those people Parvati changed the appearance of women as herself whom Kartikkeya was approaching, so at last this stopped Kartikeya from committing adultery,</p>
<p>Brahma Purana: Gautami Mahatmya 11.2-5 “When the asura Taraka was killed and the three worlds became quiet and normal, Parvati spoke to her eldest son Karttikeya with great pleasure: ‘By my consent and the grace of your father, be delighted in your mind. Enjoy as you please the worldly pleasures in the three worlds, which are dear to your mind.’ Thus addressed by his mother, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Visakha (Karttikeya) the beloved of gods, sported about as be pleased with the wives of gods. The wives of gods also sported about. While the wives of gods were being enjoyed</span>, O Narada, the heaven-dwellers were not able to prevent Karrtikeya.” Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p><strong>INDRA</strong></p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 9.40.13-25 ”Nârâyana said :– In ancient days<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">, Indra the Lord of the three worlds, intoxicated with wine and becoming lustful and shameless, began to enjoy Rambhâ</span> in a lonely grove. After having enjoyed her, he became attracted to her; his mind being wholly drawn to her, he remained there in that forest, his mind becoming very passionate.” Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p><strong>OTHERS</strong></p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 8.5.1-31 “Here the Devas live always with numerous hordes of women and have their free amorous, dealings with them, to their heart’s contents and they hear the sweet songs sung by the Gandharbas and Kinnaras, the Upa Devatâs about their own glorious deeds.” Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>There are two versions on the birth of the monkey god Hanuman, it is said that his biological father was the wind god Vayu and other version shows he was actually Shiva’s incarnation born from Shiva’s sperm,</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana 2.3.7.223-227 ”…Kesari married the daughter of Kunjara named Anjana. That lady of great purity and good fortune went to a park named Pumsavana. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Vayu (the wind-god) made advances to the lady who was proud of her youth.</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Hanuman was born of her union with Vayu</span> the (source of) life into the entire universe…” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>This is also mentioned in Valmiki Ramayana,</p>
<p>Valmiki Ramayana Kishkindha Kanda 4, Sarga 66, Verses 17-18 “On listening the words of Anjana the Air-god spoke this in reply, ‘oh, high-hipped one, I don’t dishonour you, hence let there be no fear in your heart, for I am the all-permeating Air-god. By which reason I embraced you and impregnate myself within you, by that reason you are impregnated in a supersensory manner, thereby you will beget a valiant son endowed with intellect.” Tr. K.M.K. Murthy</p>
<p>It is mentioned in Shiva Purana that after Shiva emitted his semen, the semen was taken via leaf and poured into the ears of Anjani by the sages. Later Hanuman was born as a reincarnation of Shiva</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Sataruda Samhita 3.20.3-7 ”Once lord Siva of wonderfu sports saw Visnu in the form of an enchantress with glittering qualities. As if hit by the arrows of Cupid, Siva let fall his semen dislodged from its seat, for Rama’s work. Eagerly urged by him mentally for Rama’s work the seven celestial sages retained that semen in a leaf. For Rama’s work that semen was poured through the ears of Anjani, the daughter of Gautama, by those sages. In due course Siva was born of it in the form of a monkey named Hanumat. He had great strength and exploit.” Tr. Board of Scholars, Edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p><strong>DATTATREYA AND LAKSHMI</strong></p>
<p>Purana obscurely states that Dattatreya had sex with Lakshmi,</p>
<p>Markandeya Purana 18.23-32 “Thus exhorted the gods then went to <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Dattatreya’s hermitage, and they beheld the high-souled Muni, attended by Lakshmi</span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">hymned by Gandharvas and engrossed in quaffing spirituous liquor</span>…Daddatreya addressed the prostrate gods, ‘What desire ye of me, that ye do me this obeisance…<span style="text-decoration: underline;">I am drinking strong drink</span>, I have remnants of food in my mouth, nor I subdued my senses. How is it, O gods, ye seek for victory over your enemies even from me?’ <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The gods spoke. Thou art sinless</span>, O lord of the world; no stain hast thou, into whose heart, purified by the ablution of learning, has entered the light of knowledge. True is this, o gods! all learning have I, who am impartial in view: <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">but by reason of association with this woman</span> I am now impure after eating. For commerce with women when continually pursued tends to depravity. Thus addressed, the gods then spoke again. This woman, O sinless brahman! is the mother of the world; she is not depraved…”</p>
<p>Lakshmi was present there and then he tells the gods that he had copulation with this woman (i.e. Lakshmi), Padma Purana tells us that Dattatreya had sex with Lakshmi though it doesn’t mention Lakshmi but the above verse attests to this statement,</p>
<p>Padma Purana II.103.110-113 “Atri’s son Dattatreya, the high-souled brahmana, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">the great sage, with his eyes red due to (having drunk) spirituous liquor, was sporting with a woman</span>. The virtuous one, intoxicated by wine, having seated a young, auspicious woman, best of all women, on his lap, sang, danced and heavily drank liquor…” Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p><strong>MITRA</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Vishnu created Urvashi and made her head of all Apsaras, Mitra had sexual relationship with him. This story seems to be another version of Mitra-Varuna ejaculating on seeing Urvashi.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Matsya Purana 61.25-26 &#8220;This is the nymph Urvasi, O Devas! and I have created her to become the head of all Apsaras. Then the God Mitra called her, and asked her to enjoy with Him, which she accepted.&#8221; Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, edited by B.D. Basu</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> </span></p>
<p><strong>RISHIS</strong></p>
<p>Aniruddha the grandson of Krishna had fornicated with Uma the daughter of Bana,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 10.62.22 “When Usa beheld Him, the most beautiful of men, her face lit up with joy. She took the son of Pradyumna to her private quarters, which men were forbidden even to see, and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">there enjoyed with Him</span>.” Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">An Apsara named Somada served Muni Chuli, who satisfied with her service asked her wishes, she told him that she wishes for a son but that she is unmarried and doesn’t wish to get married and requests the Muni to bestow a son, the Muni through his so called power of mind impregnated her,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Valmiki Ramayana, Bala Kanda 1, Sarga 33, verses 13-18 &#8220;Even she is obedient in his respect, and dedicating herself in ministering to him she stayed there righteously. After some time that sage Chuli has become satisfied with her service&#8230;Perceiving that the sage is contented that female celestial Somada who is aware of making good sentences is highly delighted and spoke with her melodious voice to that pedantic sage. I am unmarried and nobody&#8217;s wife, safe you be, and as I took shelter under your kindness it will be apt of you to endow me a son with your faculty of asceticism.&#8217; So said Somada to sage Cuulii. That Brahma-sage Cuuli benignantly bestowed her with a unique and Brahma-like son who is renowned as Brahmadatta, as well as his own brainchild.&#8221; Tr. Desiraju Hanumanta Rao</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The sage Gautama who cursed Indra for ravishing his wife had too ejaculated on seeing Saradvati after having sex with her,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Shiva Purana, UmaSamhita 5, chapter 4, verses 32-33 ”The sage Gautama had his mind deluded by Siva’s Maya. On seeing Saradvati in the nude </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000; font-size: 12pt;">he was excited and he indulged in sexual intercourse with her. He collected the semen emitted in a wooden bowl</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">.” Tr. Board of Scholars, Edited by J.L. Shastri</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Rishi Medhavin commit</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">s</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> adultery with Apsara Manjugosha in the forest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Padma Purana VI.46.9-24 &#8220;A celestial nymph known as Manjughosa started to infatuate an excellent sage named Medhavin, best among sages, who was a celibate and lived there&#8230;Having seen the best sage staying there, that Manjugosha was overpowered by Cupid (i.e. passion of love) and she sang gently. That best sage, having seen her singing like that, with her bracelets jingling and her anklets and girdle tinkling, was forcibly deluded by Cupid with his army. That beautiful woman Manjughosa, seeing that sage like that, approached him and deluded him with feminine conquettish gestures; and keeping her lute down (on the ground) she embraced that lord of sages, as a creeper would encircle a tree shaking due to the velocity of the wind. That best sage, Medhavin, too rejoiced with her. Seeing in that (forest) only her excellent body, his auspicious nature left him, and he was influenced by the nature of Cupid. The lover did not know (i.e. care for) night or day, while rejoicing with her.&#8221; Tr. N.A Deshpande</span></p>
<p>Apart from committing adultery, the gods were also fond of stealing the garments of women. The below section also includes Gods and Rishis committing adultery.</p>

<p>Hindu gods were also fond of stealing the garments of women to watch their naked bodies. This is venerated on temples through idols, there are idols of this shameless act by their Bhagwans in temples. Hindus boldly hang the portrait of Krishna stealing the clothes of Gopis while the Gopis coming out of the water in a fully nude state. However Krishna was not the only God who did this, several other gods did this act too,</p>
<p>Mahabharata 1.72.1-9 “Kanwa continued, ‘And Sakra, thus addressed by her, then commanded him who could approach every place (viz., the god of the wind) to be present with Menaka at the time she would be before the Rishi. And the timid and beautiful Menaka then entered the retreat and saw there Viswamitra who had burnt, by his penances, all his sins, and was engaged still in ascetic penances. And saluting the Rishi, <span style="color: #ff0000;">she then began to sport before him. </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">And just at that time Marut robbed her of her garments that were white as the Moon</span>. And she thereupon ran, as if in great bashfulness, to catch hold of her attire, and as if she was exceedingly annoyed with Marut. And she did all this before the very eyes of Viswamitra who was endued with energy like that of fire. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">And Viswamitra saw her in that attitude</span>. And beholding her divested of her robes, he saw that she was of faultless feature. And that best of Munis saw that she was exceedingly handsome, with no marks of age on her person. And beholding her beauty and accomplishments that bull amongst Rishis was possessed with lust and made a sign that he desired her companionship. And he invited her accordingly, and she also of faultless features expressed her acceptance of the invitation. And they then passed a long time there in each other’s company. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">And sporting with each other, just as they pleased, for a long time as if it were only a single day, the Rishi begat on Menaka a daughter named Sakuntala</span>.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Krishna stole the garments of Gopis just to enjoy watching their naked bodies and later gave a lame excuse,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 10.22.16-17 “The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: If you girls are actually My maidservants, and if you will really do what I say, then come here with your innocent smiles and <span style="color: #ff0000;">let each girl pick out her clothes</span>. If you don’t do what I say, I won’t give them back to you. And even if the king becomes angry, what can he do? <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Then, shivering from the painful cold, all the young girls rose up out of the water, covering their pubic area with their hands</span>.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Krishna had done a similar act to his aunt Radha in front of all the Gopis,</p>
<p>Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Krishna Janma Khanda 28.117-132 …<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Hari snatched away the cloth of Radha and thus denuded her</span>. Then he tore her wreath and loosened her chignon…Hari embraced the naked Radha, sank into the water and after having played therein got up again along with her. Then Krishna after having displayed the abashed, naked Radha to the cowherdesses threw her again at a distance into the water….Then Radha dragged Hari and gave him a push whereupon the Lord of the universe was immersed in deep water at a distance. But shortly afterwards he emerged from the liquid with a smile, <span style="color: #ff0000;">kissed and embraced the naked Radha, again and again</span>…After the play was over, the naked Lord and Radha both came to the coast and demanded their clothes from one another….” Tr. Rajendra Nath Sen</p>
<p>For fun, Indra blew the garments of girls taking bath,</p>
<p>Matysa Purana 27.3-5 ”…Accepting the request of the Devas, the Maghavan, along with them, set out on his mission and, in the way, he came across a group of women in the forest. He saw those damsels bathing and enjoying themselves, as they do in they do in the pleasure-garden of Kuvera. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Then Indra, in the form of a gust of wind, blew away and mixed up their garments</span>. At that, all the maidens, hastily coming out of water, dressed themselves with the clothes as they found them.” Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, Edited by B.D. Basu</p>

<h2><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Dancing Girls</span></h2>
<p>The gods were no different from present-day lecherous people, they had the habit of fornicating with women, drinking liquor, and even watching girls dancing. We have already seen an instance of the assembly of gods where the Apsaras were dancing.</p>
<p>As per Ramayana of Valmiki, Uttarakhanda 7, Sarga 42, Verses 18-23 Rama the so called Maryada Purshottom (ideal man) is said to have made his wife Sita drink wine and then enjoyed the dance of women. I have mentioned this in <a href="/index.php/2019/04/11/intoxicant-consumption-in-hinduism/" data-wpel-link="internal">Intoxicant Consumption in Hinduism </a>article.</p>
<p>Below are some verses from Srimad Bhagavatam about Krishna dancing with Gopis.</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 10.33.2 ”There on the Yamuna’s banks Lord Govinda then began the pastime of the rasa dance in the company of those jewels among women, the faithful gopis, who joyfully linked their arms together. [7-8] As the gopis sang in praise of Krishna, their feet danced, their hands gestured, and their eyebrows moved with playful smiles. With their braids and belts tied tight, their waists bending, their faces perspiring, the garments on their breasts moving this way and that, and their earrings swinging on their cheeks, Lord Krishna’s young consorts shone like streaks of lightning in a mass of clouds. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Eager to enjoy conjugal love</span>, their throats colored with various pigments, the gopis sang loudly and danced. They were overjoyed by Krishna’s touch, and they sang songs that filled the entire universe. [10-12] When one gopi grew tired from the rasa dance, She turned to Krishna, standing at Her side holding a baton, and grasped His shoulder with Her arm. The dancing had loosened Her bracelets and the flowers in Her hair. Upon the shoulder of one gopi Krishna placed His arm, whose natural blue-lotus fragrance was mixed with that of the sandalwood pulp anointing it. As the gopi relished that fragrance, her bodily hair stood on end in jubilation, and she kissed His arm. Next to Krishna’s cheek one gopi put her own, beautified by the effulgence of her earrings, which glittered as she danced. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Krishna then carefully gave her the betel nut He was chewing</span>. [17-18] Their senses overwhelmed by the joy of having His physical association, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the gopis could not prevent their hair, their dresses and the cloths covering their breasts from becoming disheveled</span>. Their garlands and ornaments scattered, O hero of the Kuru dynasty. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The wives of the demigods, observing Krishna’s playful activities from their airplanes, were entranced and became agitated with lust</span>. Indeed, even the moon and his entourage, the stars, became astonished. [22] <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Lord Krishna’s garland had been crushed during His conjugal dalliance with the gopis and colored vermilion by the kunkuma powder on their breasts</span>…” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Other gods also enjoyed dance of women and nymphs,</p>
<p>Skanda Purana V.iii.172.1-2 ”Sri Markandeya said: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Then all the sages and Devas with Indra at their head came to the meritorious hermitage</span> of Mandavya on the banks of Narmada. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The courtesans began to dance to the tunes of the songs of the celestial damsels</span>. Lights shone and conchs and Dundubhi drums were sounded.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Brahma Khanda 13.1-10 ”…Having tasted the pleasures of a kingdom for some time in the company of his wives, once upon a time, singing the eulogies of Hari, he suddenly came to Brahma at the shrine of the Puskara. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">At that time Brahma was witnessing the dance of a celestial nymph called Rambha along with other gods</span>. Suddenly he (Upavarhana) became impatient at the sight of her thigh (beautiful like plantain) and hard, spehrical rising breast exposed by the wind. His semen was discharged…” Tr. Rajendra Nath Sen</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana 2.3.31.22-23 &#8220;There he saw Brahma of unmeasured prowess, seated on a beautiful throne set with gems and jewels. He was adorned with ornaments set with gems and jewels. He was surrounded by leading Siddhas and sages engaged in meditation. He was gaily and smilingly watching the dance of Vidyadhara damsels.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Skanda Purana I.iii (P).12.81-83 &#8220;Surrounded and accompanied by sages and Devas and in accompaniment to the songs of the music party of Tumbura interspersed with the continuous dances of the celestial damsels, the Bull-emblemed Lord was seen there seated on his bull. Siva, the receptacle of sympathy, the enemy of the god of Love and great on account of his fortitude, gracefully approached Siva who was standing with the head bent low. Dispelling her bashfulness he placed her on his lap and became delighted. Accompanied by Lalita, his beloved, and surrounded by the assembly of Suras and leading sages, he witnessed the graceful dances of the celestial damsels to the accompaniment of music He repeatedly witnessed this with great eagerness.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Skanda Purana III.i.28.72-76 &#8220;Once, accompanied by all the immortal ones, the Slayer of Bala and Vrtra (i.e. Indra) was engaged in witnessing the dance of the celestial damsels in his court. King Puruavas too had come then to the court of Devas in order to witness the dance of the womenfol of Suras, the heaven-dwellers&#8230;&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>

<h2><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Sex Life</span></h2>
<p>Many gods especially Krishna’s sex life is highly praised in the Hindu scripture. Here is how they had sex with their wives,</p>
<p><strong>KRISHNA</strong></p>
<p><strong>Krishna with his Wives</strong></p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 10.90.10-11 <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Under the drenched clothing of the queens, their thighs and breasts would become visible</span>. The flowers tied in their large braids would scatter as they sprayed water on their consort, and on the plea of trying to take away His syringe, they would embrace Him. <span style="color: #ff0000;">By His touch their lusty feelings would increase</span>, causing their faces to beam with smiles. Thus Lord Kṛṣṇa’s queens shone with resplendent beauty. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Lord Kṛṣṇa’s </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">flower garland would become smeared with kuṅkuma from their breasts</span>, and His abundant locks of hair would become disheveled as a result of His absorption in the game. As the Lord repeatedly sprayed His young consorts and they sprayed Him in turn, He enjoyed Himself like the king of elephants enjoying in the company of his bevy of she-elephants.</p>
<p>Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Krishna Janma Khanda 112.34-46 ”O Narada, later on, Lord Krisna in due order by turns committed sexual intercourse on the auspicious day prescribed by the Vedas with seven women, viz., Kalindi, Satyabhama, Satya, NagnaJiti, sati, Jambavati and Laksmana. In course of time, each of these seven women bore ten sons and one daughter…” Tr. Rajendra Nath Sen</p>

<p>Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Krishna Janma Khanda 46.30-44 ”At that time, Parvati (who is the direct emblem of energy) and the powerful Sankara were not in the least exhausted by the above act…At that time they slept on a bed covered with flowers and with their heart animated with joy and with their bodies thrilling with raptures, they were pierced with the darts of Cupid, fainted and thus passed their days<span style="text-decoration: underline;">. Both of them who were expert in sexual science were rendered stark-naked through excess of pleasure</span>; and their bodies were marked with the injuries inflicted by teeth and nails. The sandal-paste, aloe-paste and musk of their bodies and the vermillion on the forehead of Parvati disappeared; the garland of both were torn and the chignon of Gauri was relaxed. O fair one, at the time of intercourse her anklet, bracelet, anklet and earrings continued to resound…The earth being overloaded with the energy of Siva, the supporter of the world, was about to be rent asunder and quaked along with mountains, forests and oceans…” Tr. Rajendra Nath Sen</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Rudra Samhitra 2, Sati Khanda 2, 21.19-24 ”Sometimes Siva would become invisible through his Maya and suddenly embrace her when she would become terrified and agitated. Sometime with musk <span style="text-decoration: underline;">he would make marks like bees on her breasts</span> that resembled the buds of a golden lotus. Sometimes he would take the necklace off her <span style="text-decoration: underline;">breasts and press them with his hands</span>…Even as she was looking on, sometimes <span style="text-decoration: underline;">he would come to her lofty breasts saying with laughter, this dark spot ”Kalika” on your breasts</span> is your companion of the same colour as it contains the same letter as are found in your name ‘Kalika’.” Tr. Board of Scholars, Edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 6.17.7 ”Lord Śiva, whose hair is matted on his head, has certainly undergone great austerities and penances. Indeed, he is the president in the assembly of strict followers of Vedic principles. Nonetheless<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">, he is seated with his wife on his lap in the midst of saintly persons and is embracing her</span> as if he were a shameless, ordinary human being.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Rudra Samhita 2, Kumara Khanda 4, 1.24 ”For a thousand years according to the calculation of the gods, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Siva the Yogin has been engaged in sexual dalliance</span>. He does not desist from it.” Tr. Board of Scholars, Edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Skanda Purana I.iii(P).13.11-12”On hearing these words of the Goddess, Sambhu, the Lord of Sonacala, the bestower of boons, granted everything desired by her as a boon. He was desirous of having sexual intercourse with her. Out of eagerness Siva asked her to applied the fascinated musk (to herself).” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Once Shiva was so much aroused that he repeatedly told Nandi to bring Parvati, he also told that Parvati should dress herself properly. Shiva couldn’t even wait till she prepared her toilet and sent Nandin again and again. So some girls especially Uma the daughter of Bana thought it would be nice idea to assume the form of Parvati and copulate with Shiva, she was very desirous of cohabiting with Shiva because previously she had seen Shiva and Parvati engaged in intercourse. So she tried to assume the form of Parvati and approach Shiva but Parvati learnt about it and stopped her, Parvati later told her that a person will come in her dream and rape her and he will be her future husband. And that guy was the grandson of Krishna named Anirudha. There is little variation in the story, it is uncertain whether Parvati told this to Uma when Uma saw Shiva and Parvati copulating or when Uma was going to assume the form of Parvati when Shiva was aroused.</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Rudra Samhita 2, Yudha Khanda 5, 51.35-43 ”Then being glanced at by Kama who was not vanquished, the crescent-crested <span style="color: #ff0000;">lord Siva highly indulgent in sports spoke to Nandin</span>. Go and quickly from this forest and tell the dark complexioned Parvati everything and bring her here from Kailasa after she has bedecked herself… O excellent sage, then, at his importunity, Parvati, devoted to her husband, began to bedeck herself ardently…Siva who was extremely agitated told Nandin again. ”Dear, go again and fetch Parvati from there”. ”Yes, sir”, said he. He went to Parvati of sweet appearance and said: ”Your lord wishes to see you beautifully and gorgeously dressed. O goddess, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Siva is eagerly waiting for various sports</span>. O daughter of the mountain, please go <span style="color: #ff0000;">since the lord is distressed with passion</span>.”[61-62] Then the goddess Parvati bedecked herself zealously and went to Siva. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">She then sported with him</span>. O sage, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">at the end of the dalliance Lord Siva vanished</span> from the place accompanied by his wife, the Ganas and the gods.” Tr.

<p><strong>MANSAROVAR A HONEYMOON SPOT IN ANCIENT INDIA</strong></p>
<p>Indian government spends crores of rupees for Hindu pilgrims as a subsidy to travel to Mansarovar. But this pilgrimage site namely Mansarovar was more like a honeymoon spot used by Hindu gods and sages,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 3.23.39-40 ”In that aerial mansion he traveled to the pleasure valleys of Mount Meru, which were rendered all the more beautiful by cool, gentle, fragrant breezes that stimulated passion. In these valleys, the treasurer of the gods, Kuvera, surrounded by beautiful women and praised by the Siddhas, generally enjoys pleasure. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Kardama Muni also, surrounded by the beautiful damsels and his wife, went there and enjoyed for many, many years</span>. Satisfied by his wife, he enjoyed in that aerial mansion not only on Mount Meru but in different gardens known as Vaiśrambhaka, Surasana, Nandana, Puṣpabhadraka and Caitrarathya, and by the <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Mānasa-sarovara Lake</span>.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Mahabharata 1.157.22-31 ”…Hidimva sported with the Pandava and studied to make him happy. So also, in inaccessible regions of forests, and on mountain-breasts overgrown with blossoming trees on lakes resplendent with lotuses and lilies, islands of rivers and their pebbly banks, on sylvan streams with beautiful banks and mountain-currents, in picturesque woods with blossoming trees and creepers in Himalayan bowers, and various caves, on crystal pools smiling with lotuses, on sea-shores shining with gold and pearls, in beautiful towns and fine gardens, in woods sacred to the gods and on hill-sides, in the regions of Guhyakasand ascetics, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">on the banks of Manasarovara abounding</span> with fruits and flowers of every season Hidimva, assuming the handsomest form, sported with Bhima and studied to make him happy. Endued with the speed of the mind, <span style="color: #ff0000;">she sported with Bhima in all these regions, till in time, she conceived and brought forth a mighty son begotten upon her by the Pandava</span>…” Tr.

<h2><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Sex Slaves</span></h2>
<p>There is a story mentioned in Matsya Purana which tells us how the Devas used to capture women of non-Hindus (considered demons here) and forced them into prostitution. Can the Hindu digest these verses and show them to others so that everyone may know what Hinduism is really about? The verses are pretty clear and are self-explanatory s so I won’t be explaining or summarizing them,</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 71.26-30 ”Once upon a time thousands and thousands of the demons (Danavas, Asuras, Daityas and Raksasas) were killed in the war between the Devas and the demons. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Indra told their numberless widows and those women who were forcibly seized and enjoyed</span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">to lead the life of prostitutes and remain devoted to the kings and the Devas</span>. Indra continued, ‘You should look upon, with equal eye, the kings your masters and on Sudra. All of you will attain prosperity, according to your fate. <span style="color: #ff0000;">You should satisfy those who </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">would come to you with adequate sum of money to enjoy your company</span>, even if they be poor. ” Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, Edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>Indra told the widows of Demons (Non-Hindus) how they should lead their prostitution life,</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 71.44-45 ”That Brahmana should be well fed and be devoutly looked upon as cupid, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">for the sake of sexual enjoyment</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Each and every desire of that Brahmana should be satisfied by the woman devote</span>. She should, with all heart and soul and with a smile on her face, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">yield herself up to him</span>.” Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, Edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 71.56-59 <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">“</span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Henceforth, any Brahmana coming to them for the sake of sexual enjoyment on a Sunday, should be respected and honoured</span>. If with the consent of that Brahmana, another handsome person come to them, these women should, with love and affection and to the best of their ability, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">perform all the fiftyeight kinds of observances of Love, favourite of man and gods, which would lead to pregnancy</span> and which is not harmful to their soul’s welfare. ” Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, Edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>Bhishma had also taken women captives with him,</p>
<p>Mahabharata 1.102 ”Bhishma cut off, with his arrows, on the field of battle, bows, and flagstaffs, and coats of mail, and human heads by hundreds and thousands…Then that foremost of all wielders of weapons having vanquished in battle all those monarchs, pursued his way towards the capital of the Bharatas, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">taking those maidens with him</span>.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Hinduism clearly sanctions slavery, readers can go through the article <a href="/index.php/2014/01/01/slavery-in-hinduism/" data-wpel-link="internal">Slavery in Hinduism</a>. As discussed in this article in the Rape category under the sub-category Rape and Abduction is legitimized, that Hinduism permits Rakshasa form of marriage for the Kshatriya caste, It can be considered rape because it is done after the family of the girl is slain and she is forcibly taken away, Mahabharata 13.44 says that bridegroom may forcibly take away the girl he likes to marry even after killing or beheading the girl’s kinsmen and Manu Smriti 3.33 says that sometimes the girl forcibly taken away may cry and weep and this is permitted in Mahabharata 1.73.</p>
<p>Many Hindu scriptures speak about female slaves and having sexual relation with them,</p>
<p>Narada Smriti 12.78 “<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Intercourse is permitted with a wanton woman, who belongs to another than the Brahman caste, or a prostitute, or a female slave</span>, or a female not restrained by her master (nishakasini), if these women belong to a lower caste than oneself; but with a woman of superior caste, intercourse is prohibited.” Tr. Julius Jolly</p>
<p>Katyayana Smriti verse 723 “When a master has sexual intercourse with his female slave and the latter then gives birth to a son, the master looking to the seed (which was his own) should make the female slave free from slavery together with her progeny.” Tr. P.V. Kane</p>
<p>Agni Purana 211.37-43 ”…By making the gift of a female slave to one of the foremost of the Brahmanas, a man becomes an inmate of the region of the Apasaras (nymphs)…” Tr. Manmath Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Hinduism also levies custom duties on importing female slaves,</p>
<p>Agni Purana 223.23-29 ”…Duties payable on importing female slaves into the country should be determined with a due regard to the country imported from and the time of the import. The duties payable on animals and gold shall be a fifth and sixth part of the original value, while a sixth part of their value should be paid as the kings dues on importing articles of perfumery, cereals, flowers, roots…” Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Krishna also gave many females slaves,</p>
<p>Mahabharata 4.72.19-26 ”…And Krishna gave unto each of the illustrious sons of Pandu numerous female slaves, and gems and robes…” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Krishna’s father Vasudeva also had over a thousand concubines,</p>
<p>Mahabharata 16.7.37-38 ”The Brahmanas and Kshatriyas, and Vaisyas, and wealthy Sudras, set out, keeping before them the 16,000 women that had formed Vasudeva’s harem, and Vajra, the grandson of the intelligent Krishna.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Hindu god Rama’s father named Dasharath also had many concubines, I am reproducing the passage where Dashrath’s organizes Ashvamedha Yajna,</p>
<p>Valmiki Ramayan, Bala Kanda 1.14.35 ”Thus, the officiating priests of the ritual, namely hota, adhwaryu and udgaata have received in their hand the Crowned Queen, the neglected wife, and <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">a concubine</span> of the king, next as a symbolic donation in the ritual by the performer, the king.” Tr. Shri Desiraju Hanumanth Rao</p>
<p>Hindu scriptures on concubines of Kings,</p>
<p>Natya Shastra 34.26-29 I shall now describe the classes and function of women who live in the harem and have dealings with the king. They are the chief queen (maha-devi), other queens (devi), his high born wives (sramini), ordinary wives (sthayini), concubines (bhogini) craft women (silpakarini), acresses (natakiya), dancers (nartaki), maids in constant attenance (ancarika), maids of special work (paricarka), maids in constant movement (sancarika), maids for running errands (presana-carika), Mahattaris (matron), old dames (sthavira). Ayuktikas and (overseer), Pratiharis (usher), maidens (kumari).</p>
<p>Natya Shastra 34.40 Concubines (bhogini) to a king are known as well-behaved, gentle [in manners], not very hanghty, and they are indifferent [to rivals], modest, affectionate but not held in high honor.</p>
<p>It’s mentioned in Narada Purana,</p>
<p>Narada Purana 35.43 “A son born of a virgin girl is called ‘Kanina’, and that born of pregnant before marriage is called ‘Sahodhaka’. One purchased by price is called ‘Krita’, ‘Punarbhava’ is two-fold.” Tr. Anand Swarup Gupta</p>
<p>Maharshi Manu on types of Slaves,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 8.415 ”A captive of war, a slave for maintenance, the son of a female slave, one purchased for money, a slave obtained as a present, a hereditary one, and one condemned to slavery for any offence, these are the seven kinds of slave (lit., sources of slavery)” Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Female slaves can’t perform the rites of a wife,</p>
<p>Baudhyana Dharma Sutra, Prasna 1, Adhyaya 11, Kandika 21 Now they quote also (the following verse): ‘It is declared that a female who has been purchased for money is not a wife. She cannot (assist) at sacrifices offered to the gods or the manes. Kasyapa has stated that she is a slave.</p>
<p>What does that mean? It means a female slave can do other works of a wife (like carnal pleasure) but not the sacrificial rites of the wife.</p>
<p><a href="#top">top</a></p>
<h2><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Bride selling</span></h2>
<p>Leave aside this purchasing of female slaves, Hinduism even brings a kind of marriage into slavery. As we know there are many forms of marriage in Hinduism, one of them is Manusha rite commonly known as Asura form of marriage. Vasistha explains it as,</p>
<p>Vasistha Dharma Shastra 1.35-36 “If, after making a bargain (with the father, a suitor) <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">marries (a damsel) purchased for money, that (is called) the Manusha-rite</span>. The purchase (of a wife) is mentioned in the following passage of the Veda, ‘Therefore one hundred (cows) besides a chariot should be given to the father of the bride.” Tr. Georg Buhler</p>
<p>Gautama Dharma Shastra 4.11-15 “If those who have (authority over) a female are propitiated by money, (that is) an Asura wedding&#8230;The first four (rites) are lawful; Some say, (the first) six.” Tr. George Buhler</p>
<p>Baudhayana Dharma Shastra Prasna I, Adhyaya 11, Kandika 20 (I, II, 20), Verses 7-8 &#8220;(If the bridegroom receives the maiden) after gladdening (the parents) by money, (that is) the rite of the Asuras (asura). (If the maiden is wedded) after being forcibly abducted, (that is) the rite of the Rakshasas (rakshasa). [12] <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Among these the sixth and the seventh agree with the law of Kshatriyas</span>. For power is their attribute.&#8221; Tr. George Buhler</p>
<p>Baudhayana permits Asura (Manusha) form of marriage for Kshatriya whereas Manu Smriti prohibits it for Kshatriya and permits them for Vaishyas and Shudras and in some cases for Brahmanas also.</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 3.20-24 “Now listen to (the) brief (description of) the following eight marriage-rites used by the four castes (varna) which partly secure benefits and partly produce evil both in this life and after death. (They are) the rite of Brahman (Brahma), that of the gods (Daiva), that of the Rishis (Arsha), that of Pragapati (Pragapatya), that of the Asuras (Asura), that of the Gandharvas (Gandharva), that of the Rhashasas (Rakshasa), and that of the Pisakas (Paisaka). Which is lawful for each caste (varna) and which are the virtues or faults of each (rite), all this I will declare to you, as well as their good and evil results with respect to the offspring. One may know that the first six according to the order (followed above) are lawful for a Brahmana, the four last for a Kshatriya, and the same four, excepting the Rakshasa rite, for a Vaisya and a Sudra. The sages state that the first four are approved (in the case) of a Brahmana, one, the Rakshasa (rite in the case) of a Kshatriya, and the Asura (marriage in that) of a Vaisya and of a Sudra.” Tr. George Buhler</p>
<p>One may get confused when one reads 25<sup>th</sup> verse of this chapter, but according to Medhatithi that law is laid down only for the Kshatriyas. He also states that several forms of marriage are permitted but specific forms are superior. In case one is not able to find a bride to perform marriage in the superior form then he may recourse to other options or forms of marriage. He also states that Asura marriage which is a purchase of the bride for money from the father of the bride is specifically allowed for the Vaishya and Shudra castes and also allowed for Brahmana as an option. It is also mentioned in Narada Purana 26.15-18 that on failing to get a bride in acceptable forms of marriage a Brahmana may adopt any of the eight forms of marriage.</p>
<p><strong>Acharya Medhatithi writes on Manu Smriti 3.24-25</strong>, &#8220;&#8230;For the Vaishya and the Shudra, it is the &#8216;Asura&#8217; alone. Among those that have been sanctioned (before) and prohibited now, there is to be option; so that one may have recourse to the optional forms only when those that have been sanctioned absolutely in all cases are not possible&#8230;[25] The law laid down in this verse pertains to the Ksattriya and the rest, not to the Brahmana&#8230;The conclusion on this point is as follows :- For the Brahmana there are six forms of marriage; of these the &#8216;Brahma&#8217; is the best of all; inferior to that are the &#8216;Daira&#8217; and the &#8216;Prajapatya;&#8217; inferior to these is the Arsa, then the &#8216;Gandharva,&#8217; then the Asura&#8230;As regards the &#8216;Asura&#8217; form, since it has been specifically prescribed for the Vaishya and the Shudra, it implies the exclusion of the Brahmana and the Ksattriya from it. And yet we have the distinct injunction of six forms as permitted for the Brahmana (in 23 above). From all which it follows that there is option; but it is an option with the restriction that one is to recourse to the second option only in the event of the first option being impossible&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Ganganath Jha</p>
<p>Garuda Purana permits Asura marriage for the Vaishyas,</p>
<p>Garuda Purana I.95.10-11 &#8220;In the Asura form of marriage, money is taken&#8230;The first four types of marriage are recommended for brahmins; the Gandharva and the Raksasa type for kings; the Asura type for vaisyas and the despicable last type for the sudras.&#8221; Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti 24.24 and Asvalayana Grihya Sutra 1.6.6 also mentions Asura marriage. Bhishma also talks about prevalence of these forms of marriages,</p>
<p>Mahabharata Adi Parva 1, Section 116, Verses 8-10 &#8220;Bhishma said:- The wise have said that after inviting an accomplished man, a maiden may be bestowed on him decked with ornaments and accompanied with valuable presents as much as lie in the power of the bestower to give. Others may bestow their daughters by accepting a couple of kine. Some again may bestow their daughters by taking a fixed sum, and some again take away maidens by force. Some marry with the consent of the maidens and some by dragging them into consent&#8230;&#8221; Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Skanda Purana also states that Asura form of marriage was prevalent among Kshatriyas and Vaishyas,</p>
<p>Skanda Purana IV.i.38.7 &#8220;Generally speaking, the marriages of the types of Gandharva, Asura and Raksasa are in vogue among Ksatriyas and Vaisyas&#8230;&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>This will be an eye opener for some Hindus, because those poor Hindu used to say Marriage in Hinduism is a very spiritualistic matter and very unique compared to other religions. Is that the ‘Uniqueness’ they talk about? Purchasing a wife like a one purchases a commodity.</p>

<h2><span style="font-size: 16pt;">LGBT</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">LGBT stands for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">,</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> and Transgender. To be precise Hinduism sanctions Transgenderism and Lesbianism. Many gods committed transgenderism. Which has compelled Hindu scholars to accept LGBT. The most famous story about LGBT in Hinduism is that of Shiva and Vishnu. Here is a verse from Skanda Purana which is addressed to Shiva,</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">SHIVA AND VISHNU</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Skanda Purana I.iii(U).20.32-33 ”Be victorious, O Lord, whose head is adorned with Ganga and the crescent moon, O Lord, who have fascinated the minds of the wives of all sages by means of your handsome features. Be victorious, O Lord, who are possessed of the glory of the god of Love due to the close contact of the daughter of the Mountain. Be victorious, O Lord, </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000; font-size: 12pt;">who are an expert in the repetition of the (sexual) play over the body of Naranaya</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> adopted by means of Maya (?).” Tr. G.V. Tagare</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Narayana and Hari are the synonyms of Vishnu, Hara, Sankara, Shambhu are synonyms of Shiva’s name. This verse shows that Shiva had sex with Vishnu. As per story mentioned in Srimad Bhagavatam, Vishnu assumed the form of a beautiful woman, This form of Vishnu is known as Mohini. He assumed this form to lure and defeat the demons. Later on Shiva requested Vishnu to assume the form which is pleasing to the lusty people, Shiva wanted to see his Mohini form. Thus requested by Shiva, Vishnu assumed the form of Mohini. Shiva despite knowing that it was Vishnu just couldn’t resist his desire and followed Vishnu in front of his wife and even discharged semen out of desire. Both Mohini and Shiva were naked and Shiva forcefully embraced Vishnu (Mohini).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Agni Purana 3.17-20 He [Vishnu] was then requested by Hara to show (this form) unto him. The Divine Hari then displayed his female form unto Rudra. Overpowered by his (Vishnu’s) illusory power, </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-size: 12pt;">Shambhu, renouncing Gouri</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">, longed for that damsel. </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-size: 12pt;">He became naked and looked like a maniac</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">. He held the woman by the hair and she, releasing her hairs, ran away. He too followed her. </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-size: 12pt;">Wherever dropped Hara’s seminal fluid</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> there sprang up fields of his phallic emblem and gold.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The story mentioned in Srimad Bhagavatam will briefly explain this,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Srimad Bhagavatam 8.12.15-16 ”The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: When the demons took away the jug of nectar, I assumed the form of a beautiful woman to bewilder them by directly cheating them and thus to act in the interest of the demigods. O best of the demigods, </span><span style="color: #ff0000; font-size: 12pt;">I shall now show you My form that is very much appreciated by those who are lusty</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">. Since you want to see that form, I shall reveal it in your presence. [19] Because the ball was falling down and bouncing up, as She played with it Her breasts trembled, and because of the weight of those breasts and Her heavy flower garlands, Her waist appeared to be all but breaking at every step, as Her two soft feet, which were reddish like coral, moved here and there. [21] As She played with the ball, the sari covering Her body became loose, and Her hair scattered. She tried to bind Her hair with Her beautiful left hand, and at the same time She played with the ball by striking it with Her right hand. This was so attractive that the Supreme Lord [Vishnu], by His internal potency, in this way captivated everyone. [24-26] Thus Lord Śiva saw the woman, every part of whose body was beautifully formed, and the beautiful woman also looked at him. Therefore, thinking that She was attracted to him, Lord Śiva became very much attracted to Her. Lord Śiva, his good sense taken away by the woman because of lusty desires to enjoy with Her</span><span style="color: #ff0000; font-size: 12pt;">, became so mad for Her that even in the presence of Bhavānī [Shiva’s wife] he did not hesitate to approach Her</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">. The beautiful woman was already naked, and when She saw Lord Śiva coming toward Her, She became extremely bashful. Thus She kept smiling, but She hid Herself among the trees and did not stand in one place. [28-32] After following Her with great speed, Lord Śiva caught Her by the braid of Her hair and dragged Her near him. Although She was unwilling, he embraced Her with his arms. Being embraced by Lord Śiva like a female elephant embraced by a male, the woman, whose hair was scattered, swirled like a snake. O King, this woman, who had large, high hips, was a woman of yoga-māyā presented by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. She released Herself somehow or other from the fond embrace of Lord Śiva’s arms and ran away. As if harassed by an enemy in the form of lusty desires, Lord Śiva followed the path of Lord Viṣṇu, who acts very wonderfully and who had taken the form of Mohinī. Just as a maddened bull elephant follows a female elephant who is able to </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">conceive pregnancy, Lord Śiva followed the beautiful woman and discharged semen, even though his discharge of semen never goes in vain.” Tr.

<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">As per Brahmanda Purana a son was born to Shiva-Vishnu known as Shasta.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Brahmanda Purana Lalita Mihatmya 6.7-9 “The second form appeared when the churning for the sake of Nectar was being carried out. That form fascinated Sarva (Siva). It cannot be comprehended by the mind or expressed through words. On seeing it, even isa (god Siva) became charmed and enchanted although he is omniscient. When prohibited by her, he left off Parvati all of a sudden and he indulged in sexual intercourse with her (i.e. Mohini). He begot of her (the son) Sasta, the supressor of Asuras.” Tr. G.V. Tagare </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Shasta is popularly known as </span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayyappan" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right"><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #0000ff; font-size: 12pt;">Ayyappa</span><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> in south India. He is also known by the name Hari-Hara. As he was born from Hari (Vishnu) and Hara (Shiva).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Apologists try to give lame explanation for this homosexual act, they say that Shiva did not have sex (read rape) with Vishnu but with Mohini who was a woman. For the sake of the argument even if I accept this to be true then does that mean it is permissible to have sex with a transgender? As Vishnu transforme</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">d himself into a woman and in this </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">modern </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">age</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> it’s possible for a man to become woman after going through some surgeries. Moreover this is not a avatar of Vishnu its just his form, when you search the meaning of Avatar on Google you will find the following meaning </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">”</span><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-size: 12pt;">a manifestation of a deity or released soul in </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000; font-size: 12pt;">bodily form on earth</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">; an incarnate divine teacher” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Some examples are Krishna and Ram, the two avatars of Vishnu who had taken birth on the earth through human parents. But unlike these two Mohini didn’t took birth on earth. Gods like Shiva assumed forms of beggar and other people to carry on their so called test on people, so Hindus don’t say ”so and so beggar tested those people” but they say “Shiva assumed the form to test them” similarly Mohini was Vishnu itself this is why some Hindu </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">scholars permits homosexuality on the basis that Shiva and Vishnu were engaged in this act,</span><br />

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">SHIVA AND AGNI</span></strong></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">There is one more story of LGBT of Shiva. Where Shiva ejaculated his semen into the mouth of the fire god Agn</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">i, after Agni interrupted his </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">sexual dalliance</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> of Shiva with his wife</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">. The context of this story is that all the gods were frightened by a demon named Taraka who was causing trouble on earth, no god could defeat him except Shiva. But Shiva was engaged in sexual intercourse with his wife for a very long time. All the gods waited for it to finish, but Shiva did not stop that. So at last the gods sent Agni to summon Shiva to kill the demon </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Taraka. Agni went to the palace after assuming the form of a bird and interrupted their intercourse. Shiva in anger ejaculated the semen in Agni’s mouth,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Brahma Purana, Gautami-Mahatmya 58.16-24 ”At the instance of Devas the fire-god assumed the form of a parrot and went to the place where the lord of the worlds was sporting with Uma…The lord of Devas called the fire-god moving about in front of him, in the form of a bird and said, ”O Agni, you have been recognised through various ways. Do not speak anything. Open your mouth. Take this in and carry it with you.” After saying this </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000; font-size: 12pt;">lord Sambhu discharged a great deal of semen into the mouth of fire-god</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">. With this semen within him Agni could not at all go. Utterly tired, Agni sat down on the bank of Ganga. He then discharged a greater portion </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000; font-size: 12pt;">of that semen into Krttikas wherefrom Karttika was born</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">. </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000; font-size: 12pt;">The remaining portion of the semen of Sambhu that had been within his body, Agni split into two and deposited into his beloved wife Svaha</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> who was particularly eager to have a child.” Tr. Board of Scholars, Edited by J.L. Shastri </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">This is also mentioned in Mahabharata 9.44.6-11 with a slight variation. Kartikkeya is considered the son of Shiva and Agni as per Vamana Purana as the semen was swallowed by Agni,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Vamana Purana 31.26-28 “O Brahman, in the meantime Brahman said to Agni ‘How old and grown up is your son, Guha now’? Hearing his words, and not knowing his son, Agni said to Brahman, I do not know who is Guha,’ Being pleased, the Lord said, ‘You drank the semen of Sankara in the past, so a child, the lord of the three worlds has been born in the thickest of reeds.” Tr. Anand Swarup Gupta</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">As per another version, the sages’ wives who were bathing in the river were also impregnated as Agni had deposited a portion of the semen in the river. Later all those wives aborted</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> their pregnancies</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> except Arundhati. Agni is an intermediary, i.e. whatever is put in Agni reaches the god as a result th</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">e</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> semen of Shiva went into the stomach of all the gods and they were impregnated by it,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Shiva Purana, Rudra Samhita 2, Kumara Khanda 4. Ch 2.25 ”The gods are wont to partake of the offerings of food etc. consigned to the fire in accordance with the Vedic text. Hence the gods became pregnant.” Tr. Board of Scholars, Edited by J.L. Shastri</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The gods later vomited the semen on the behest of Shiva,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Shiva Purana, Rudra Samhita 2, Kumara Khanda 4. Ch 2.30-38 ”We have become pregnant and also scorched by your semen. O Siva, take pity on us. Remove our miserable plight…[Shiva said] At my Behest you shall vomit this semen virile of mine. you will be happy thereby. Accepting this command with bent head Visnu and </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000; font-size: 12pt;">the other gods immediately vomited it out after duly remembering Siva the imperishable</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">” Tr. Board of Scholars, Edited by J.L. Shastri</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">KRISHNA AND ARJUNA</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">According to Tamil versions of the Mahabharata, the god Krishna – an incarnation of Vishnu – also took the form of Mohini and married Aravan. This was in order to give Aravan the chance to experience love before his death, as he had volunteered to be sacrificed. Krishna remained in mourning in the Mohini form for some time after Aravan’s death. This marriage and death of Aravan are commemorated annually in a rite known as Thali, during which Hijra (Indian “third gender”) take on the role of Krishna-Mohini and “marry” Aravan in a mass-wedding, followed by an 18-day festival. The festival ends with a ritual burial of Aravan, while the Hirjas mourn in Tamil style: by beating their chests in ritual dances, breaking their bangles and changing into white mourning clothes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">According to Padma Purana Krishna is said to have </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">been in a </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">relationship with Arjuna. Arjuna was desirous of knowing the secrets of Vrindavan or the Ras Leela you can say. So he prayed to a goddess named Tripura who fu</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">lfilled his</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> desire by turning Arjuna into a woman</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">. Arjuna became a woman after he </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">dipped into a lake. This form of Arjun has been called as Arjuni and Arjuniya in the Padma Purana. Arjuni went to Krishna who then had sex with Arjuna,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Padma Purana Patalakhanda 5, Chapter 74, Verses 61-74a “Then having heard the words, when Arjuna plunged into the water of the lake…The charmingly smiling one got up and on seeing around, was confused. He instantly saw himself (to be turned into) a wonderful, excellent lady, who had a slim, fair, charming body like the rays of pure gold…” Tr. N.A Deshpande</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Padma Purana Patalakhanda 5, Chapter 74, Verses 177b-196a “…Arjuniya, having seen in confusion on the left side of the pleasing goddess Radhika, propitiating and offering a tambula to him of a bright smile, was overcome with the passion of love. </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000; font-size: 12pt;">Then, Srikrsna, who knew everything, knowing her to be like that, seized her hand, and he the lord, the great master of magical art secretly sported with her in the entire pleasure-forest</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">. Then putting his sport-like arm on her should and coming to Sarada, said to her: ‘Bathe quickly this slim-bodied lady of a gentle smile, fatigued due to sport, in this western lake.’ Then that goddess Sarada (took her) to the western lake, (and) said to her, ‘Take bath’. The fatigued one did like that. </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000; font-size: 12pt;">She who got to the interior of the water, again turned into Arjuna</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> and got up at the place where the lord of gods and the chief of the beautiful Vaikuntha stood. Seeing Arjuna dejected and broken-minded, Krsna kindly touched him with his hand and put him (back) to his nature.” Tr. N.A Deshpande </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Arjuna the biggest devotee of Krishna is said to have transformed himself into a eunuch,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Mahabharata 4.45.13-14 “</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">…Indeed, thou seemest to me to be Mahadeva, or Indra, or the chief of the Gandharvas, dwelling in the guise only of one of the third sex.’ “Arjuna said, ‘I tell thee truly that I am only observing this vow for a whole year agreeable to the behest of my elder brother. O thou of mighty arms, I am not truly one of the neuter sex, but I have adopted this vow of eunuchism from subservience to another’s will and from desire of religious merit. O prince, know me now to have completed my vow…” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">KRISHNA AND NARADA</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Krishna also had sex with Narada Muni in the same way,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Padma Purana, Patalakhanda 5, Chapter 75, Verses 24b-32a “Narada said: This is a great secret, the secret of secrets. Formerly Brahma told me that secret about Vrndavana (when I had said to him): ‘O lord of gods, O father, tell me the secret of Vrndavana.’ Hearing this desire (of mine), he remained silent for a moment. Then he said to me: ‘O child, go to Maha (i.e. great) Visnu, my lord. Undoubtedly I must also go there with you.’ Saying so, and taking me (with him) he went to the abode of Visnu. He told Maha Visnu what I had said to him. Hearing that Maha Visnu himself ordered the self-born one (i.e. Brahma). ‘By my order, you take the sage Narada, and arrange for his bath in the lake called Amrta.’ Having entered the Amrta lake, I took bath there. Just at that moment I was (i.e. I found myself) near women, beyond (i.e. on the other side of) the lake (I was) turned into a woman, endowed with all (good) charachteristics…” Tr. N.A. Deshpande</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Padma Purana, Patalakhanda 5, Chapter 75, Verses 39B-53 “With them, (we) went where the eternal Krsna remained. The lord, who was merely of the form of the Good, the Intelligence and the Joy, and o that of a woman, and whose heart was delighted due to the women, again and again said to me: ‘Come along O dear one, O beloved, embrace me devoutly.’ O you best brahmana, </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000; font-size: 12pt;">there only he enjoyed (with me) for a year</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">. Then that best lover said to that goddess Radhika: ‘This was my natural form there, which had taken the form of Narada. Take her to the Amrta lake, and arrange for her bath.’…After that goddess Radhika took me to the lake, waited there, and went (back) near the feet of the Moon in the form of Krsna. </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000; font-size: 12pt;">Then immediately after plunging (into the lake) I came (back) as Narada</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">…” Tr. N.A. Deshpande </span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">NARADA AND KING TALADHVAJA</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Sage Narada had </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">a </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">relationship with a King named Taladhvaja as per the version available in Srimad Devi Bhagavatam,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Srimad Devi Bhagavatam Book 6, Chapter 28, Verses 37-54 “…O Nârada! Look! Look! How clear crystal-like is the water of this pool like the heart of a saint; see how it smells also fragrantly in contact with the lotuses on it.” When the Bhagavân spoke thus to me; I kept my lute and deer skin aside and gladly went to the edge of the tank. Washing then my hands and feet I tied my hair lock and, taking Kus’a grass, I performed my Âchaman and, purifying myself, began to bathe myself in that tank. While I was bathing, Hari was looking at me; by the time I took a dip, I saw that I quitted my male form and got a beautiful female form. Hari took away, then, my deer skin and lute and mounting on Garuda went away in a moment to His own residence. Getting the female form and decorated with excellent ornaments, my memory of my previous male form vanished at once; I forgot all about my famous lute and forgot also Jagannâtha, the Deva of the Devas. </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000; font-size: 12pt;">I then came out of the tank in that enchanting woman form</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">, saw the pool of water filled with clear limpid water and adorned with lotuses. Seeing that, I began to think :– “What is this?” and I became very much </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">astonished. While I was thus meditating in my woman form, a king, named Tâladhvaja, came there, all on a sudden, on a chariot, accompanied by numerous elephants and horses. The King looked like a second Cupid…” Tr. Swami Vijnananda</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Srimad Devi Bhagavatam Book 6, Chapter 29, Verses 13-20. “</span><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-size: 12pt;">The King then began to sport with me amorously according to the rules of the Kâma S’âstra in various ways and with great enjoyments and pleasures</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">. He then left all his kingly duties and state affairs and he began to remain day and night with me deeply immersed in amorous sports; so much his mind was merged in me in these plays that he could not notice the long time that passed away in the interval. He used to drink the Vâru</span><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-size: 12pt;">n</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">î wine and, forsaking all the state affairs, began to enjoy me in nice gardens, beautiful lakes, lovely palaces, beautified houses, excellent mountains and enviable forests and became completely subservient to me. O Dvaipâyana! Being incessantly engaged with the King in amorous sports and remaining obedient to him, my previous body, male ideas, or the birth of Muni, nothing whatsoever came in my memory. I remained always attached to him…” Tr. Swami Vijnananda</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Srimad Devi Bhagavatam Book 6, Chapter 30, Verses 1-14. Nârada said :– O Best of Munis! The King was greatly astonished to see me dip in the tank in a female figure and get up from the tank in a male figure and thought, “Where is my dearest wife? And how is this Nârada Muni suddenly come here!” The King, not seeing his wife, lamented very much and cried frequently, “O my dear Wife! Where have you gone, leaving me here thus. Without you, O One of spacious hips! My life, palace and kingdom, all, are quite useless…” Tr. Swami Vijnananda</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">BUDHA (SON OF SOMA) AND KING</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Another form of LGBT is also found in Srimad Bhagavatam. Some sages went to the abode of Shiva but as soon as they spotted Shiva and Parvati engaged in sexual intercourse they immediately went away. To please Parvati, Shiva said that anyone coming near his area shall become a woman. A king accident</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">al</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">ly stepped into that area and became a woman, later (s)he had sex with the son of moon god Soma named Budha,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Vayu Purana, Part 2.23.15-18 …He who is revered in the three worlds is famous as Sudyumna. He has attained the form of a lady. That noble lady returned to her father after securing the boon. After getting an opportunate moment, she was invited for love making (sexual intercourse) by Budha (the planet mercury). From Budha, the son of Soma, Puruavas, the son of Ila was born. After giving birth to the son born of Budha, she became Suyumna again. Sudyumna had three sons, all extremely virtuous” Tr. G.V. Tagare</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Srimad Bhagavatam 9.1.30-35 ”When the goddess Ambikā saw the great saintly persons, she was very much ashamed because at that time she was naked. She immediately got up from the lap of her husband and tried to cover her breast. Seeing Lord Śiva and Pārvatī engaged in sexual affairs, all the great saintly persons immediately desisted from going further and departed for the āśrama of Nara-Nārāyaṇa. Thereupon, just to please his wife, Lord Śiva said, “Any male entering this place shall immediately become a female!” Since that </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">time, no male had entered that forest. But now King Sudyumna, having been transformed into a female, began to walk with his associates from one forest to another. </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000; font-size: 12pt;">Sudyumna had been transformed into the best of beautiful women who excite sexual desire</span> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">and was surrounded by other women. Upon seeing this beautiful woman loitering near his āśrama, </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000; font-size: 12pt;">Budha, the son of the moon, immediately desired to enjoy her</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">. </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000; font-size: 12pt;">The beautiful woman also desired to accept Budha</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">, the son of the king of the moon, as her husband. </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000; font-size: 12pt;">Thus Budha begot in her womb a son named Purūravā</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">This is also mentioned in Matsya Purana 11.50 and Brahmanda Purana 2.3.60.15-17. </span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">MITRA AND VARUNA</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Shatapatha Brahmana also promotes Homosexuality, it is about the homosexual act of the Vedic gods Mitra-Varuna,</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><br />
Satapatha Brahmana 2.4.4.19 </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000; font-size: 12pt;">In that same night Mitra implants seed in Varuna</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">, and when it (the moon) then it is produced from that seed…</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">OTHERS</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">There’s a story of King Dilipa</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> the ancestor of Rama</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> in a Bengali Ramayana called Krittvasa Ramayana. In this Ramayana it is stated that King Dilip died without having any son. His kingdom had become kingless, the gods were worried so Shiva ordered King Dilipa’s two wives to have sex with each other like a man. One of the wife conceived a son who was later known as Bhagiratha. There are two versions in the Krittvasa Ramayana, I am mentioning only one, the second version names the two queens as Chandra and Mala.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Krittvasa Ramayana, Adi Kanda “Dilipa ruled like Indra, the king of the gods, but was sad as he did not have a son. Leaving behind his two wives in the city of Ayodhya, Dilipa went in search of the Ganga….On his death the city of Ayodhya was kingless…Riding his bull, Shiva went to Dilipa’s two queens and said to them: ‘By my blessings, one of you will have a son.’ Hearing Shiva’s words, the two women said: ‘We are widows, how can we have a child?’ Shankara replied: ‘You two have intercourse with one another. By my blessings one of you will have a lovely child.’ Having bestowed this boon, the god who destroys the three worlds went his way. The two wives of Dilipa took bath. They lived together in extreme love. After days, one of them menstruated. Both of them knew one another’s intentions and enjoyed love play, and one of them conceived….” Tr. Kumkum Roy</span><br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>As mentioned in the book Same-Sex Love in India, by Ruth Vanita, Published by Penguin UK, 20-Oct-2008</em></span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">There is another version mentioned in </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">the </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Bengali version of Padma Purana,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Padma Purana, Svarga Khanda 16.6-24 “King Dilipa had no son, and after a long time, he died. His two wives were constantly sad. They went to the hermitage of the sage Vasistha and said to him, ‘The dynastic line descended from King Sagara has been broken, and the kingdom has been attacked by enemies. Tell us what to do.’ When he heard this, the great sage thought deeply about the matter, and when he had made his decision he said to the two queens, ‘This human dynasty will not be terminated. A noble son will be born to the two of you, fine ladies with beautiful eyes. I will make a supreme effort on your behalf.’ When he had said this, Vasistha cooked up a consecrated pot of rice and milk (caru) that was infused with all good qualities, using the proper ritual for one who wished to have a son. Then he said to the two noble women, ‘One of you must eat this consecrated pot of rice and milk, and the other must have intercourse with her in the manner of a man.’ When the women heard this, they did what the great sage had told them to do. The eldest queen became pregnant, and after the usual time brought forth a son. But since the boy had been born without any semen of a man, he was born without any bones, and was just like a ball (pinda) of flesh. The two queens named him Bhaghiratha…” Tr.

<h2><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Niyoga</span></h2>
<p>Niyog Pratga is the Vedic practice where the childless or sonless widow sleeps with another man and conceives the child, but the child would be considered the son of the deceased father and not his biological father. The Brother of the deceased person is preferred to contract Niyog with the widow after that close relatives were given preferences. Niyoga is sanctioned by Hindu scriptures. Swami Vivekananda writes about Niyoga,</p>
<p>“…Another cause was instrumental in bringing this about — the change in the system of marriage. The earliest system was a matriarchal one; that is, one in which the mother was the centre, and in which the girls acceded to her station. This led to the curious system of the Polianders [polyandrous], where five and six brothers often married one wife. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Even the Vedas contain a trace of it in the provision, that when a man died without leaving any children, his widow was permitted to live with another man, until she became a mother; but the children she bore did not belong to their father, but to her dead husband</span>…” By Swami Vivekananda, Ideals of Womanhood,(<em>BrooklynStandard Union</em>, January 21,1895) <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Complete_Works_of_Swami_Vivekananda/Volume_2/Reports_in_American_Newspapers/Ideals_of_Womanhood" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Complete_Works_of_Swami_Vivekananda/Volume_2/Reports_in_American_Newspapers/Ideals_of_Womanhood<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>It is mentioned in Shastras,</p>
<p>Gautama Dharma Shastra 18.4-6 “A woman whose husband is dead and who desires offspring (may bear a son) to her brother-in-law… (On failure of a brother-in-law she may obtain offspring) by (cohabiting with) a Sapinda, a Sagotra, a Samanapravara, or one who belongs to the same caste.” Tr. Georg Buhler</p>
<p>Baudhyana Dharma Shastra Prasna II, Adhyaya 2, Kandika 4, verses 7-9 “widow shall avoid during a year (the use of) honey, meat spirituous liquor, and salt, and sleep on the ground. Maudgalya (declares that she shall do so) during six months. After (the expiration of) that (time) she may, with the permission of her Gurus, bear a son to her brother in law, in case she has no son.” Tr. Georg Buhler</p>
<p>It is mentioned in Puranas,</p>
<p>Garuda Purana chapter 95 ”The younger brother of a husband, may go unto a childless wife of his elder brother for the purpose of begetting an offspring on her person with the permission of his elders, first had and obtained in that behalf, and with his body annointed with clarified butter.” Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Another version of this Purana translated by J.L. Shastri is given below,</p>
<p>Garuda Purana I.95.16-17 “For producing a son and a heir in the family the brother-in-law or a cousin or a person of the same clan can have intercourse with an issueless widow till she conceives. If he touches her after that he becomes degraded. The son born thus is the legitimate son of the deceased husband.” Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Kurma Purana 2.22.98 ”…a son born of the Niyoga rite should perform Sraddha to his progenitor as well as the dead husband of his mother. Then he shall be the true heir. If a son is born out of the semen virile without the sanction of Niyoga, the son should offer Pindas to the progenitor. However, he may perform Sraddha to the Ksetrin (mother’s husbands).” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>It is mentioned in Vishnu Smriti,</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti 15.1-3 Now there are twelve kinds of sons. The first is the son of the body, viz. he who is begotten (by the husband) himself on his own lawfully wedded wife. The second is the son begotten on a wife, viz. one begotten by a kinsman allied by funeral oblations, or by a member of the highest caste, on an appointed (wife or widow).</p>
<p>It is mentioned in Yajnavalkya Smriti,</p>
<p>Yajnavalkya Smriti, Book 1 Achara Adhyaya, chapter 3, verse 68 ”The younger brother of the husband, a Sapinda or a Sagotra, being anointed with clarified butter, and with the permission of the Guru, may go to a sonless widows, when in season, with the desire of raising a son.” Tr. R.B.S. Chandra Vidyarnava</p>
<p>Maharshi Manu writes,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 9.190 “Let the widow of a deceased, sonless man get a son procreated on her person by a man of her husband’s Gotra (i.e., his younger brother, or a Sapinda relation), and let the entire estate of that deceased person be invested in that son.” Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Vasistha Dharma Shastra 17.56 “After the completion of six months she shall bathe, and offer a funeral oblation to her husband. (Then) her father or her brother shall assemble the Gurus who taught or sacrificed (for the deceased) and his relatives, and shall appoint her (to raise issue to her deceased husband)…Let him approach (the widow) in the muhuarta sacred to Pragapati (behaving) like a husband, without (amorously) dallying with her, and without abusing or ill-treating her.”</p>
<p>Katyayana Smriti verse 859 “When a person begets a fruit (a son) with the consent of the owner of the field (husband of the wife), both of them are entitled to the fruit (the son), since a fruit is not produced in the absence of one (of the two).” Tr. P.V. Kane</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 9.59 ”In the absence of a son, a woman wishing to obtain a progeny, shall lie down under an appointment, with a younger brother, or with a Sapinda relation, of her husband for the procreation of a son.” Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 3.173 ”He, who, otherwise than under an appointment of begetting a son on her, visits the widow of his deceased elder brother, out of passion, is called the husband of a deceased elder brother’s widow.” Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Niyoga in Manu is obscure. There are a couple of stories that prove Niyoga existed in the Vedic period, Niyoga was perhaps also used to satisfy the desire which is evident from the story of Muni Vyasa and maidservant. Sage Vasistha the common son of Mitra-Varuna had contracted Niyoga with the wife of a King,</p>
<p>Mahabharata 1.179.33-47 ”…O best of Brahmanas, I desire to obtain from thee that by which, O foremost of all that are conversant with the Vedas, I may be freed from the debt I owe to the race of Ikshvaku! O best of men, <span style="color: #ff0000;">it behoveth thee to grant me, for the perpetuation of Ikshvaku’s race, a desirable son</span> possessing beauty and accomplishments and good behaviour.’ “The Gandharva continued, ‘Thus addressed, Vasishtha, that best of Brahmanas devoted to truth replied unto that mighty bowman of a monarch, saying, <span style="color: #ff0000;">‘I will give you</span>…After the royal sage had entered his capital, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">the queen, at the king’s command, approached Vasishtha. The great Rishi, making a covenant with her, united himself with her according to the high ordinance</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">And after a little while, when the queen conceived</span>, that best of Rishis, receiving the reverential salutations of the king, went back to his asylum. The queen bore the embryo in her womb for a long time. When she saw that she did not bring forth anything, she tore open her womb by a piece of stone. It was then that at the twelfth year (of the conception) was born Asmaka, that bull amongst men, that royal sage who founded (the city of) Paudanya.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>This story is also mentioned in Srimad Bhagavatam 9.9 and Narada Purana,</p>
<p>Narada Purana, Uttarabhaga 28.32 “O Brahmana, the activities of the Lord are beyond human scrutiny though he abides by the favourably Dharma. Vyasa the son of Parasara, is himself the classifier of the Vedas. He was a man of truthful vision. His very form is worthy of being worshipped. (But) he was born of the semen virile of one who destroyed the virginity (of a woman). Hence he is called a Kanina (son of an unmarried girl). Moreover, he had sexual intercourse with the wives of his younger brothers.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Satyavati requested Vyasa who was born of her from Parasara, to have sons from the queens of his younger brother Vicitravirya as mentioned in Mahabharata Adi Parva section 104 &amp; 105</p>
<p>This king was cursed thus he couldn’t impregnate his wife and requested Vasistha to impregnate her. But why did Vasistha do that when he could have just discharged semen in a pot and given birth to a son just like he was born or else he could have used his mystic power to remove the curse. Another sage named Dirghatama had done a similar act with the wife of King Bali named Sudeshana but the King wasn’t cursed,</p>
<p>Mahabharata 1.104.37-47 ”The virtuous Vali, ever devoted to truth, then learning who the man was that was thus saved by him, <span style="color: #ff0000;">chose him for raising up offspring</span>. And Vali said, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">‘O illustrious one, it behoveth thee to raise upon my wife a few sons</span> that shall be virtuous and wise.’ Thus addressed, the <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Rishi endued with great energy, expressed his willingness</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. Thereupon king Vali sent his wife Sudeshna unto him</span>. But the queen knowing that the latter was blind and old went not unto him, she sent unto him her nurse. And upon that Sudra woman the virtuous Rishi of passions under full control begat eleven children of whom Kakshivat was the eldest…Thy unfortunate queen Sudeshna, seeing me blind and old, insulted me by not coming herself but sending unto me, instead, her nurse.’ The king then pacified that best of Rishis and sent unto him his queen Sudeshna. The Rishi by merely touching her person said to her, ‘Thou shalt have five children…” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Let me show you the ugly side of this Rishi Dirghatama,</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 48.67-76 ”After that, King Bali appeased that sage and was furious with his wife; and sent her again well-dressed, after her toilet, to the sage, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">when the seer said. ”O. Devi! Cast off your bashfulness and then lick the whole of my body with your tongue</span>, after rubbing it with salt, curds and honey; you will then attain your wish and get sons.” The queen followed the directions of the seer, but omitted to lick the hind private parts. When the sage said; ”O, blessed one! Your eldest son will be without that part of the body which you have omitted to lick.” The queen said:- ”Sire! It is not worthy of you to bless me with such an offspring. Be pleased at my devotion and show your mercy to me.” Dirghatama said:- ”O, Blessed one, through your fault this will happen exactly as I have told you and this son of yours will not delight you in any way, but your grandson will; he will, however, not feel the necessity of the missing part of his body.” Then the sage, touching her abdomen, said, ”<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">O, queen because you have licked all parts of my body </span>except the privates, your sons will be like the full moon, and, in all you will be blessed with five sons of Divine beauty who will be most illustrious, renowned, righteous and performers of sacrifices.” Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, Edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>Why does the Rishi need to do this shameless act? We read in scriptures that gods and sages possess mystic power and are capable to do anything. Even if the king is impotent or infertile then why doesn’t he use the spells mentioned in the Vedas for fertility? If the Virility spells in the Vedas are useless then why keep them in the Vedas just tear them and throw them away. Why corrupt the society with such vulgar Vedic Hindu practices?</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Brahma had gone to sage Santanu’s house, however</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">,</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> Santanu was not present at that time and Brahma was welcomed by Santanu’s wife Amogha, seeing the beautiful wife of sage Santanu, Brahma ejaculated on </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">their </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">seat and left the house. When sage Santanu came to of all this, instead of becoming furious, he asked his wife Amogha to drink Brahma’s semen in order to conceive a son, as commanded by her husband, Amogha d</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">rank the semen and was impregnated</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Padma Purana Section 1 Sṛṣṭi-khaṇḍa, Chapter 55, verses 19b-30a “There was a well-known sage, Śantanu by name, who was honoured by gods and whose lustre was like that of the lotus-born one (i.e. Brahmā). (His) beautiful and youthful (wife) was known as Amoghā. Once Brahmā went to her house to meet her husband (Śantanu). At that time, the best sage (i.e. Śantanu) had gone to the forest for (collecting) flowers etc… Seeing that woman of a spotless body, the Creator was overpowered with the passion of love&#8230;</span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000; font-size: 12pt;">The semen of the supreme soul, Brahmā, fell on the bedstead</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">. Then Brahmā, being afflicted and distressed, quickly left. Then the sage came home, and saw (Brahmā’s) semen on the seat. He asked the beautiful woman (his wife): “Who had come here?” Then that brāhmaṇa understood it by means of meditation. “</span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000; font-size: 12pt;">O good woman, please preserve by my order the very important semen of Brahmā. A son, who alone will purify all the worlds, will be born (to you)</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">. Our desire which is all auspicious will (now) be fulfilled.” Then the chaste, illustrious woman, obeying his order, drank, for the birth of a son, the semen of Brahmā, the supreme soul.” Tr. N.A. Deshpande</span></p>
<p>A sage named Angira had also contracted Niyoga with the wife of Rathitara,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 9.6.2-3 “<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Rathītara had no sons, and therefore he requested the great sage Aṅgirā to beget sons for him</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Because of this request, Aṅgirā begot sons in the womb of Rathītara’s wife</span>. All these sons were born with brahminical prowess.— Having been born from the womb of Rathītara’s wife, all these sons were known as the dynasty of Rathītara, but because they were born from the semen of Aṅgirā, they were also known as the dynasty of Aṅgirā. Among all the progeny of Rathītara, these sons were the most prominent because, owing to their birth, they were considered brāhmaṇas.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>King Pandu was also born of Niyoga. After his marriage, he urged his wife Kunti to contract Niyoga with other men and beget offspring. Pandu’s biological father was Muni Vyasa,</p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 6.25.1-10 ”Vyasa said :– OKing! The mother became astonished to hear me. Becoming very anxious for a son, she began to speak to me. O Child! <span style="color: #ff0000;">The wife of your brother, the daughter Ambalika of Kasiraj, is a widow</span>; she is very sorrowful; she is endowed with all auspicious signs and endowed with all good qualities; <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">better cohabit with that beautiful young wife and get a child according to the tradition of the S’istas</span>…Seeing me an ascetic with matted hairs on my head and void of every love sentiment, perspiration came on her face; her body turned pale and her mind void of any love towards me. When I saw that lady trembling and pale beside me, I angrily spoke :– “O One of beautiful waist! When you have turned out pale, considering your own beauty, let your son be of a pale colour.” Thus saying <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">I spent there that night with Ambalika. After enjoying her</span> I took farewell from my mother and went to my place.” Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>It is also mentioned in Mahabharata Adi Parva 106. Muni Vyasa was appointed to cohabit with the princess but at first, the princess sent a maid. Despite knowing that it was a maidservant Muni Vyasa enjoyed her. Vyasa speaks about it in the following way,</p>
<p>Srimad Devi Bhagvatam 6.25.11-21 ”<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ambika sent to me a maid-servant of Vichitravîrya</span>, full of youth and beauty, and adorned with various ornaments and clothings. That maid-servant of beautiful hairs and of a swan-like gait adorned with garlands and red sandal-paste, came to me with many enchanting gestures and making me take my seat on the cot, became herself merged in love sentiments. O Muni! <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">I became pleased with her gestures and amorous sports and passed the night, full of love towards her and played and cohabited with her</span>.” Tr. Vijnananda</p>
<p>The story of Muni Vyasa cohabiting with the maid servant is also mentioned in Srimad Devi Bhagavatam 2.6.1-12. King Pandu was afflicted with a curse and thus couldn’t approach his wife for sexual intercourse. But he did not hesitate in ordering his wife to cohabit with other men,</p>
<p>Mahabharata 1.120.26-41 “Hearing these words of the ascetics, Pandu, remembering the loss of his procreative powers owing to the curse of the deer, began to reflect deeply. <span style="color: #ff0000;">And calling his wedded wife the excellent Kunti, unto him, he told her in private, ‘Strive thou to raise offspring at this time of distress</span>… <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The religious institutes mention six kinds of sons that are heirs and kinsmen</span>, and six other kinds that are not heirs but kinsmen. I shall speak of them presently. O Pritha, listen to me. They are: 1st, the son begotten by one’s own self upon his wedded wife; <span style="color: #ff0000;">2nd, the son begotten upon one’s wife by an accomplished person from motives of kindness</span>; <span style="color: #ff0000;">3rd, the son begotten upon one’s wife by a person for pecuniary consideration</span>; 4th, the son begotten upon the wife after the husband’s death; 5th, the maiden-born son; 6th, the son born of an unchaste wife; 7th, the son given; 8th, the son bought for a consideration; 9th, the son self-given; 10th, the son received with a pregnant bride; 11th, the brother’s son; and 12th, the son begotten upon a wife of lower caste. On failure of offspring of a prior class, the mother should desire to have offspring of the next class<span style="color: #ff0000;">. In times of distress, men solicit offspring from accomplished younger brothers</span>. <span style="color: #ff0000;">The self-born Manu hath said that men failing to have legitimate offspring of their own may have offspring begotten upon their wives by others</span>, for sons confer the highest religious merit. Therefore, O Kunti, being destitute myself of the power of procreation, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">I command thee to raise good offspring through some person who is either equal or superior to me</span></strong>. O Kunti, listen to the history of the daughter of Saradandayana who was appointed by her lord to raise offspring. That warrior-dame, when her monthly season arrived, bathed duly and in the night went out and waited on a spot where four roads met. She did not wait long when a Brahmana crowned with ascetic success came there. The daughter of Saradandayana solicited him for offspring. After pouring libations of clarified butter on the fire (in the performance of the sacrifice known by the name of <em>Punsavana</em>) she brought forth three sons that were mighty car-warriors and of whom Durjaya was the eldest, begotten upon her by that Brahmana. O thou of good fortune, do thou follow that warrior-dame’s example at my command, and speedily raise offspring out of the seed of some Brahmana of high ascetic merit.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>King Pandu also ordered his wife Kunti to conceive children with the Sun god Surya,</p>
<p>Mahabharata 1.123.1-9 “Vaisampayana said, ‘O Janamejaya, when Gandhari’s conception had been a full year old, it was then that Kunti summoned the eternal god of justice to obtain offspring from him. And she offered without loss of time, sacrifices unto the god and began to duly repeat the formula that Durvasa had imparted to her some time before. Then the god, overpowered by her incantations, arrived at the spot where Kunti was seated in his car resplendent as the Sun. Smiling, he asked, ‘O Kunti, what am I to give thee?’ And Kunti too smiling in her turn, replied, ‘Thou must even give me offspring.’ <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Then the handsome Kunti was united (in intercourse) with the god of justice</span> in his spiritual form and obtained from him a son devoted to the good of all creatures. And she brought his excellent child, who lived to acquire a great fame…<span style="text-decoration: underline;">And this first child of Pandu shall be known by the name of Yudhishthira</span>. Possessed of prowess and honesty of disposition, he shall be a famous king, known throughout the three worlds.”</p>
<p>Not to confuse this consensual sex with the rape. When Surya raped Kunti a son named Karna was born, see Devi Bhagavatam 2.6.36-48 and it happened before her marriage. While the above one happened after her marriage to King Pandu and a son name Yuddhishtira was born. So both these are two different stories. As Hindu scripture permits Niyoga, King Pandu had no problem with it at all. He kept on asking (or forcing) his wife to contract Niyoga with many men, finally, the distressed Kunti resisted it and addressed Pandu in the following way,</p>
<p>Mahabharata 1.123.75-77 “The celebrated Pandu, tempted by the desire of having more children wished to speak again unto his wedded wife (for invoking some other god). But Kunti addressed him, saying, ‘The wise do not sanction a fourth delivery even in a season of distress. The woman having intercourse with four different men is called a Swairini (heanton), while she having intercourse with five becometh a harlot. Therefore, O learned one, as thou art well-acquainted with the scripture on this subject, why dost thou, beguiled by desire of offspring, tell me so in seeming forgetfulness of the ordinance?&#8217;” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>This is just a reason given by Kunti to stop her husband from violating her by other men. Vedic law permits a woman to cohabit with up to 11 men to beget children. When Parashurama the sixth avatar of Vishnu annihilated Kshatriya men 21 times, the female Kshatriyas went to Brahmins to contract Niyoga and begat progeny who was Kshatriyas as the law of Niyoga is that the son belongs to the deceased father but not to the biological father who contracted Niyoga. Kshatriya women contracted Niyoga with Brahmin twenty-one times,</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana 2.3.46.29-33 “After killing all the Ksatriyas on the surface of the Earth, Rama became calm…Ksatriya kings were begotten of the widowed wives of those Ksatriyas by Brahmanas. Again he (Rama) killed hundreds and thousands of such kings. In two years, Rama made the Earth devoid of Ksatriyas once again…<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Again, O king, enlightened Ksatriyas </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">were procreated by the Brahmanas</span>. Rama killed them entirely like the god of death, the destroyer of the Earth.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Mahabharata 1.104.4-7 “And the illustrious scion of Bhrigu’s race, by means of his swift arrows annihilated the Kshatriya tribe one and twenty times. “And when the earth was thus deprived of Kshatriyas by the great Rishi, the Kshatriya ladies all over the land had offspring raised by Brahmanas skilled in the Vedas. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">It has been said in the Vedas that the sons so raised belongeth to him that had married the mother</span>. And the Kshatriya ladies went in unto the Brahamanas not lustfully but from motives of virtue. Indeed, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">it was thus that the Kshatriya race was revived</span>.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>

<h2><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Bestiality</span></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="443" height="326" class="wp-image-8863 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Picture-11-326h.jpeg" alt="https://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/bestiality-gods-khajuraho-temple-ashvamedha.jpg?w=443&amp;h=326" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Picture-11-326h.jpeg 443w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Picture-11-326h-300x221.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 443px) 100vw, 443px" /></p>
<p>Hinduism also allows Bestiality i.e. sex with animals. As I already mentioned, Shiva had raped Agni whilst Agni was in the form of a bird which is a case of bestiality, let me quote that passage again,</p>
<p>Brahma Purana, Gautami-Mahatmya 58.16-24 ”At the instance of Devas the <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">fire-god assumed the form of a parrot</span> and went to the place where the lord of the worlds was sporting with Uma…The lord of Devas called the fire-god moving about in front of him, in the form of a bird and said, ”O Agni, you have been recognised through various ways. Do not speak anything. Open your mouth. Take this in and carry it with you.” <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">After saying this lord Sambhu discharged a great deal of semen into the mouth of fire-god</span>. With this semen within him Agni could not at all go. Utterly tired, Agni sat down on the bank of Ganga. He then discharged a greater portion of that semen into Krttikas wherefrom Karttika was born. The remaining portion of the semen of Sambhu that had been within his body, Agni split into two and deposited into his beloved wife Svaha who was particularly eager to have a child.” Tr. Board of Scholars, Edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>A passage from Mahabharata shows that a Rishi named Kindama used to have sex with other deer as he was uncomfortable having sex with humans,</p>
<p>Mahabharata 1.118.5-38 “Vaisampayana said, ‘O king, one day Pandu, while roaming about in the woods (on the southern slopes of the Himavat) that teemed with deer and wild animals of fierce disposition, saw a large deer, that seemed to be the leader of a herd, serving his mate. Beholding the animals, the monarch pierced them both with five of his sharp and swift arrows winged with golden feathers. O monarch, <span style="color: #ff0000;">that was no deer that Pandu struck at, but a Rishi’s son of great ascetic merit who was enjoying his mate in the form of a deer</span>. Pierced by Pandu, while engaged in the act of intercourse, he fell down to the ground, uttering cries that were of a man and began to weep bitterly…[Rishi in deer form said] The time of sexual intercourse is agreeable to every creature and productive of good to all. O king [Pandu], <span style="color: #ff0000;">with this my mate I was engaged in the gratification of my sexual desire</span>. But that effort of mine hath been rendered futile by thee…I am, O king [Pandu], a Muni who liveth on fruits and roots, though disguised as a deer…<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">I was engaged in sexual intercourse with this deer, because my feelings of modesty did not permit me to indulge in such an act in human society</span>. In the form of a deer I rove in the deep woods in the company of other deer. Thou hast slain me without knowing that I am a Brahmana, the sin of having slain a Brahmana shall not, therefore, be thine. But senseless man, as you have killed me, disguised as a deer, at such a time, thy fate shall certainly be even like mine. When, approaching thy wife lustfully, thou wilt unite with her even as I had done with mine… Tr. Kisari Mohan Ganguli</p>
<p>Rishi Kindama was able to have sex with deer, I wonder how he was sexually attracted to deers? Maharshi Manu writes that many sages were born after sages had cast their semen in animals,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 10.72 ”Since through their excellent energies (potency), seeds, cast in the wombs of beasts (by the holy sages), fructified in the shapes of human beings, who became honoured and commendable Rishis in life; the seed is commended (as of greater importance in an act of fecundation).” Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-8864 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Bestiality-Complete-Untitled.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Ved Vyasa was attracted to Apsara Ghritachi even after she had assumed the form of a parrot,</p>
<p>Narada Purana II.58.18-25 “After having obtained that excellent boon from the Lord, Vyasa, the son of Satyavati, was one day engaged in churning the sacrificial sticks, with the desire of making a fire (for sacrificial purpose). At that time, the illustrious sage happened to see a heavenly damsel called Ghrtaci who, in consequence of her brilliant splendour, possessed excellent beauty. Seeing that celestial damsel, in that forest, the great sage Vyasa became instantly passionately enamoured of her. After making Vyasa deeply agitated with passion, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">the most beautiful Ghrtaci, transforming herself into a she-parrot, approached him. Even after seeing the celestial lady disguised in another form, he was overcome with cupid (passionate love) who spread in every part of his body</span>…Due to the inevitablity of Destiny (lit.what was to happen) the heart of the sage was fascinated by the (beautiful) form (of Ghrtaci). With the desire to do this (viz. the kindling of fire) while he was suppressing his passion with special efforts, all of sudden his semen fell on the churning sticks. It was thus that the great ascetic Suka was born, while Vyasa continued the churning of sacrificial sticks.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>There is another version of this story Devi Bhagavatam 1.14.1-70.</p>
<p>A demon named Rambha was a devotee of the fire god Agni. Not to confuse this demon Rambha as the Apsara named Rambha. He was desirous of having progeny. Agni accepted his prayer and said that he should immediately copulate with any specie and he will get a progeny.</p>
<p>Srimad Devi Bhagavatam 5.2.27-31 ”…Vyasa said :– O king! Hearing thus the sweet words of Fire, Rambha quitted the hold of his hairs and said :– O Lord of the Devas! If thou art pleased, grant my desired boon that a son be born unto me, who will destroy the forces of my enemy and who will conquer the three worlds. And that son be invincible in every way by the Devas, Danavas and men, very powerful, assuming forms at will, and respected by all. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The Fire</span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;"> said</span> :– O highly Fortunate! You will get your son, as you desire; therefore desist now from your attempting suicide. O highly fortunate Rambha! <span style="color: #ff0000;">With any female of whichever species, you will co-habit, you will get a son</span>, more powerful than you; there is no doubt in this. Vyasa said :– O king! Hearing thus the sweet words of the Fire as desired, Rambha, the chief of the Danavas, went, surrounded by Yaksas, to a beautiful place, adorned with picturesque sceneries; when one lovely she-buffalo, who was very maddened with passion, fell to the sight of Rambha. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">And he desired to have sexual intercourse with her, in preference to other women. The she-buffallo, too, gladly yielded to his purpose and Rambha had sexual intercourse with her</span>, impelled as it were by the destiny. The she-buffalo became pregnant with his semen virile…” Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Why does a Vedic god Agni command his devotee to have sex with ‘any specie’? The word of god becomes the command and can be taken as permissibility. The excerpts from Manu Smriti itself are enough to prove bestiality was practiced in the Vedic period.</p>
<p>There’s a story in Vishnu Purana about King Satadhanu who had taken birth as a dog due to committing the ‘sin’ of speaking with an infidel. His wife after taking rebirth as the daughter of Kasi recognized her husband and married him while he was still a dog,</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 3.18.64-67 “With the eye of divine intelligence she knew that her own husband had been regenerate as a dog, and going once to the city of Vaidiśá she saw the dog, and recognised her former lord in him. Knowing that the animal was her husband, she placed upon his neck the bridal garland, accompanying it with the marriage rites and prayers…” Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Hinduism also encourages Ashwamedha Yagna, let’s not go into details of this ritual. This ritual was performed by the king and his wives and also had the involvement of priests to chant Mantras. This ritual involved killing the horse, the chief queen would then place the penis of the dead horse in her vagina, and she would ask the dead horse to release semen in her. This ritual was done in front of the king and priests. Ram’s mother Kaushalya is said to have spent a night with the dead horse.

<h2><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Sex Positions</span></h2>
<p>Why the word of god has to explain sex position? It’s not porn literature after all. We have already read in the article Obscenity in Veda how the Vedas talk about sex positions. When Vedas the highest authoritative text can teach such vulgar things then why can’t other Hindu scriptures?</p>
<p>Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 6.4.9-10 ”If a man desires his wife with the thought: ”May she enjoy love with me.” <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Then, after inserting the member in her, joining mouth to mouth and stroking her organ</span>, he should utter the following mantra ”O semen, you have been produced from my every limb…Bring this women under my control, like a deer pierced by a poisoned arrow.” Now, the wife whome he desires with the thought: ”May she not conceive”- <span style="text-decoration: underline;">after inserting the member in her and joining mouth to mouth, she should inhale and exhale</span>, repeating the following mantra: ”with power, with semen, I reclaim the semen from you.” Thus she comes to be without semen.” Tr. Swami Nikhilananda</p>
<p>There is another verse in Brihadaranyaka Upanishad which is based on Vedas,</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 14.2.71 ”O bride, I am Amah and you are Saa I am Saman and you are Rik and I am sun and you earth. Let both of us unite together and procreate progeny.” Tr. Vaidyanath Shastri (Arya Samaj)</p>
<p>Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 6.4.20-22 Then he embraces her, repeating the following mantra: I am the vital breath and you are speech. You are speech and I am the vital breath. I am Saman and you are Rig; I am heaven and you are earth. Come, let us strive together so that we may have a male child.” <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Then he spreads apart her thighs, repeating the following mantra: “Spread yourselves apart, Heaven and Earth.” Inserting the member in her and joining mouth to mouth</span>, he strokes her three times from head to foot, repeating the following mantra:” Let Vishnu make the womb capable of bearing a son! Let Tvashtra shape the various limbs of the child! Let Prajapati pour in the semen! Let Dhatra support the embryo! O Sinivali, make her conceive; O goddess whose glory is widespread, make her conceive! May the two Atvins, garlanded with lotuses, support the embryo! “Let the two Atvins chum the womb with the two golden arani sticks! I am placing a seed in your womb to be delivered in the tenth month. As the earth has fire in its womb, as heaven is pregnant with the sun, as the quarters are impregnated by air, so I am impregnating you by placing this seed in your womb.” After the reciting of the mantra, he utters his own name and that of his wife and places the seed.” Tr. Swami Nikhilananda</p>
<p>The Padma Purana also shows vulgarity,</p>
<p>Padma Purana II.53.98-109 ”…O messenger, the organs of generation of the male and also of the female throb. Then the male and the female, being inflamed with passion, unite. The body (of the male) is rubbed with the body (of the female). Due to coitus a momentary pleasure is produced…” Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p>Padma Purana V.100.59b-77 ”…O king, there is the itching for sex in all beings. The penis of the man expands, so also the vulva of the woman. The woman and the man, getting mad, are then united. Due to rubbing of one body with another, there is a momentary pleasure…” Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p><a href="#top">top</a></p>
<h2><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Oral Sex</span></h2>
<p>There is a story of the sun god raping his wife by inserting his male organ into her mouth,</p>
<p>Brahma Purana 4.42-43 “The Lord assumed the form of a horse and approached her as she grazed about fearlessly in the form of a mare. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">It was in her mouth that he had his sexual intercourse</span>, as she began fidgeting due to her suspicion that he might be a person other than her own husband. She let out the semen of Vivasvat through her nostrils.” Tr. Board of Scholars, Edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>This is also mentioned in Shiva Purana,</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, UmaSamhita 5.35.32-34 ”He assumed the form of a horse and approached her for sexual indulgence with her who could not be overwhelmed by any living being due to her lustre and observance of restraint. O sage, in the course of the sexual activity <span style="color: #ff0000;">she suspected him to be another man</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Hence she received the semen through the mouth into the nostril</span>. Thence were born the twin gods Asvins, the foremost among physicians.” Tr. Board of Scholars, Edited by Jagdish Lal Shastri</p>
<p>This story is also mentioned in Matsya Purana 11.34-37 and Brahmanda Purana 2.3.59.74-76. This is also mentioned in Nirukta and Vedas although it doesn’t give much detail like the above verses. Kama Sutra also speaks about oral sex, although I shouldn’t quote Kama Sutra here but as evident, other Hindu scriptures are no less than Kama Sutra and I find no difference between them,</p>
<p>Kama Sutra 2.9 When, holding the man’s lingam with his hand, and placing it between his lips, the eunuch moves about his mouth, it is called the ‘nominal congress’. When, covering the end of the lingam with his fingers collected together like the bud of a plant or flower, the eunuch presses the sides of it with his lips, using his teeth also, it is called ‘biting the sides’. When, being desired to proceed, the eunuch presses the end of the lingam with his lips closed together, and kisses it as if he were drawing it out, it is called the ‘outside pressing’. When, being asked to go on, he puts the lingam further into his mouth, and presses it with his lips and then takes it out, it is called the ‘inside pressing’. When, holding the lingam in his hand, the eunuch kisses it as if he were kissing the lower lip, it is called ‘kissing’. When, after kissing it, he touches it with his tongue everywhere, and passes the tongue over the end of it, it is called ‘rubbing’. When, in the same way, he puts the half of it into his mouth, and forcibly kisses and sucks it, this is called ‘sucking a mango fruit’. And lastly, when, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">with the consent of the man, the eunuch puts the whole lingam into his mouth, and presses it to the very end, as if he were going to swallow it up, it is called ‘swallowing up</span>‘.</p>
<p><a href="#top">top</a></p>
<h2><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Masturbation</span></h2>
<p>The Padma Purana clearly shows how a woman masturbates, but why the word of god should do that?</p>
<p>Padma Purana V.112.23a-33a “On the death of the husband before (her death) she should not enter fire (with the thought) ‘In my widowhood, all this wealth will be useful for my religious merit.’ Resolving like this with (i.e. in) her mind, when widowhood has come, she, when she gets and itching of the vulva (i.e. has a desire for sex) by day or at night, she said (i.e. would say), after having gone to a lonely place and after having uncovered (i.e. taken off) her garment, to her vulva these words, through grief, and with her hand on her generative organ: ”O vulva, what have you done? What sin have you committed? Or is it the sin of the penis due to having got into you? Or is it the sin of the doer due to avoiding service like me?” Even then when the itch is produced, she would put her finger (into her vulva); and due to the feeling of the itch she would do strange movements after that. Having rubbed it with her hands, having struck it and having expanded it, she, being extremely pained, repeatedly shook her feet. She, after having embraced the (piece of) wood of the cot, and pressed her breasts (against it) as she liked, became sad due to peculiar disposition of her mind…” Tr. Board of Scholars; G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Mahabharata 3.224.7 “Markandeya continued, ‘Then Agni, filled with great joy and delight, married Swaha in the guise of Siva, and that lady joyfully cohabiting with him, held the semen virile in her hands.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Kama Sutra 5.6 The women of the royal harem cannot see or meet any men on account of their being strictly guarded, neither do they have their desires satisfied, because their only husband is common to many wives. For this reason among themselves they give pleasure to each other in various ways as now described. Having dressed the daughters of their nurses, or their female friends, or their female attendants, like men, they accomplish their object by means of bulbs, roots, and fruits having the form of the lingam, or they lie down upon the statue of a male figure, in which the lingam is visible and erect.</p>
<p><a href="#top">top</a></p>
<h2><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Open/Group Sex</span></h2>
<p>Many Hindu gods and sages used to have sex in the open mostly in the forest without any hesitation. Many times their act was seen by other people also. One such story is of Indra copulating with Paulomi and this act was seen by a sage named Anga,</p>
<p><strong>INDRA</strong></p>
<p>Padma Purana II.30.76-85 ”O brahmanas, once the brahmana, the very lustrous and vigorous son of Atri went to the Nandana (garden); there is saw Indra, Pakasasana. He saw Indra, who was accompanied by hosts of celestial nymphs and Gandharvas and Kinnaras…who was adorned with all ornaments, <span style="color: #ff0000;">who was engaged in sexual sports</span>, who possessed an unlimited prowess…By his side he saw the blessed virtuous Paulomi, charming and auspicious, glorious with beauty, lustre and penance, shining with good fortune and chastity. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">With her that Indra enjoyed in the Nandana forest. Seeing his sport</span>, the best brahmana Anga (thought): ‘Lucky is the king of gods who is surrounded by such (beings). Oh, (great) is the power of his penance, due to which he has obtained such a great (i.e. high) position.” Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p>Another act of Indra,</p>
<p>Mahabharata 3.115.17 ”…And the mighty ruler of the Haihaya tribe placing himself on his celestial car, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">affronted Indra, while that deity was enjoying himself with Sachi, his queen</span>. Then, O Bharata’s son, the blessed and the revered god (Vishhnu) held a consultation with Indra…” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p><strong>SHIVA</strong></p>
<p>Shiva was an ascetic by name only. He did many shameless acts, Rishis spotted Shiva and his wife having sex and they also saw Shiva’s wife topless,</p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 1.12.1-53 ”…Once on a time, Sanaka and other Risis went to this forest to pay a visit to Sankara, illuminating the ten quarters by their holy aura. But then <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Bhagavan Sankara was in amorous dealings with Sankari</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The beautiful Devi Ambika was then naked and sitting on the lap of Sankara</span> and therefore became very much ashamed at their sight…” Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>This is also mentioned in Brahmanda Purana 2.3.60.24-26a, But this didn’t stop Shiva from cohabiting in the open. He once again cohabited in a forest and was seen by the sage Bhrigu who later cursed him,</p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 4.20.36-37 “O King! When Mahadeva [Shiva], being infatuated with Kama, went into the forest of Bhrigu and <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">becoming naked, began to copulate</span>, the ascetic Bhrigu, seeing him in that state, exclaimed “O You are very shameless” and cursed Him thus :– Let your penis drop off just now. Mahadeva, then to satisfy his thirst for passion, began to drink the water of the lake Amrita Vapi, dug by the Danavas.” Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Once Uma the daughter of demon Bana observed the act between Shiva and Parvati and was struck with passion,</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 5.32.11-13 “PARASARA.–<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Usha, the daughter of Bana, having seen Parvati sporting with her lord, Sambhu</span>, was inspired with a wish for similar dalliance…” Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>There is a story in Skanda Purana although it’s not about Shiva or his wife having open sex but about his wife’s breasts seen by demons when her upper garments were tossed while playing with a ball,</p>
<p>Skanda Purana IV.ii.65.26-27 “The brilliance of her body was completely revealed as the upper cloth over her breasts was tossed about. The lotus like palms of the goddess became excessively red as she continuously beat the springing ball. Her eyebrows seemed to dance as her eyes closely followed the ball. Mrdani, the beautiful mother of the universe, was playing thus and she was seen by the Ditijas (demons) named Vidala and Utpala who happened to go through the firmament…” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p><strong>VISHNU</strong></p>
<p>Narada Muni went to Sveta Dipa the residence of Vishnu where he spotted Vishnu having sex with his wife and also saw the breasts of Vishnu’s wife Lakshmi,</p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 6.28.1-11 ”…<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Thus the Bhagavan Narayana was playing in amorous movements with the daughter of the ocean</span>, fully capable to give one delight and enjoyment. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Seeing me</span>, the lovely Devi Kamala, dear to Vasudeva, full of youth and beauty, decorated with ornaments, endowed with all auspicious signs, superior to all the women, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">went away at once (to another room)</span> from the presence of Janardana. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The breast of Laksmi Devi was becoming visible even through the cloth thrown over it</span>…” Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Vishnu’s avatar Krishna had also done a similar act with his girlfriend Viraja, His aunt cum concubine Radha was enraged because of that. Viraja due to Radha’s fear committed suicide,</p>
<p>Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Prakriti Khanda 49.1-9 ”…Once upon a time, Lord Krisna, well decked was sporting with a cow herdess named Viraja on a part of the Sata Sringa mountain situatied in Vrindavana at the Goloka…Their sexual intercourse was interminable Krisna and Viraja both expert in sexual intercourse enjoyed the pleasures of that intercourse. For one Manwantra according to the calculation of the residents of the Goloka, free from death and birth their intercourse lasted. Four female messengers of Radha went and informed Radha of the matter. Radha was thereupon highly incensed and threw down the garland from her breast…She ascended,, with millions of her beloved female companions…This car was faster in speed than the mind. Sudama, the friend of Krisna as soon as he perceived the approach of Radha, warned Krisna and ran away with his associates. Afraid of forfeiting the love of his beloved Radha, Krishna left the chaste Viraja and disappeared. Viraja, too, through Radha’s fear, committed suicide…” Tr. Rajendra Nath Sen</p>
<p><strong>RISHIS AND OTHERS</strong></p>
<p>An old sage named Parasara became passionate after he saw a girl named Satyavati on the boat and wanted to have sex right on the boat before everyone,</p>
<p>Mahabharata 1.63.69-84 “…While engaged in this vocation, Satyavati was seen one day by the great Rishi Parasara, in course of his wanderings. As she was gifted with great beauty, an object of desire even with an anchorite, and of graceful smiles, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">the wise sage, as soon as he beheld her, desired to have her</span>. And that bull amongst Munis addressed the daughter of Vasu of celestial beauty and tapering thighs, saying, ‘Accept my embraces, O blessed one!’ <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Satyavati replied, ‘O holy one, behold the Rishis standing on either bank of the river. Seen by them, how can I grant thy wish</span>?’ “Thus addressed by her, the ascetic thereupon created a fog (which existed not before and) which enveloped the whole region in darkness. And the maiden, beholding the fog that was created by the great Rishi wondered much. And the helpless one became suffused with the blushes of bashfulness…”<span style="text-decoration: underline;">And Satyavati gratified with having obtained the excellent boon in consequence of which she became sweet-scented</span> and her virginity remained unsullied <span style="color: #ff0000;">conceived through Parasara’s embraces. And she brought forth the very day, on an island in the Yamuna, the child begot upon her by Parasara</span>…” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>This is also mentioned in Shiva Purana Umasamhita 44.23. The poor girl named Satyavati couldn’t openly refuse as she was afraid that the Rishi may curse her. So she tried many other things given below,</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Umasamhita 5.14.18-25 ”Afflicted with lust the sage caught hold of the lass. Tremblingly the lass spoke to the merciful sage. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">”O great sage, I have foul smell and black complexion</span>…<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Afflicted by lust the sage caught hold of her again. On seeing him bent upon seizing her she said again</span>. ”It is mentioned in the Vedas that sexual intercourse shall be indulged in at night; not during the day…Hence please wait till the night falls. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Now all the men will see us and so shall my father who stands at the other bank</span>.” On hearing the words uttered by her, the leader sage immediately created a screen of snow, thanks to his strength of his merit.” Tr. Board of Scholars, Edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>As far as my opinion is concerned I consider this to be no different from prostitution. In prostitution, money is exchanged for illicit sex and here the Rishi offered her pleasant smell and beautiful form. This old Rishi was so aroused that he didn’t care about her foul smell or her ugly appearance, he held her hand and wanted to have sex right on the boat, he didn’t even care about other people standing on the other side of the shore. All he wanted was carnal satisfaction. Who knows the people on the other side may have seen this act but turned a blind eye because this was such a disgusting act.</p>
<p>A Rakshasa king spotted a Rishi having sex with his wife,</p>
<p>Narada Purana I.9.52 “Moving about on the banks of the Narmada, that Raksasa (king) who frightened all the world, happened to see a certain sage engaged in amorous sports with his beloved.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>On seeing Gandharvas making love a sage became very passionate,</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Rudra Samhita 2, Parvati Khanda 4, 34.9-10 ”The Gandharva was an expert in the science of erotics. He was in the company of a woman. He was therefore completely submerged in the ocean of pleasure, <span style="color: #ff0000;">sexual dalliance and was lusty</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">On seeing him the great sage became very lustful</span>. He lost interest in penance and began to think of acquiring a wife.” Tr. Board of Scholars, Edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>King of Gandharva had also copulated in open and was seen by a Brahmin woman,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 9.16.2-3 Once when Reṇukā, the wife of Jamadagni, went to the bank of the Ganges to get water, she saw the King of the Gandharvas, decorated with a garland of lotuses and sporting in the Ganges with celestial women [Apsarās]. She had gone to bring water from the Ganges, but when she saw Citraratha, the King of the Gandharvas, sporting with the celestial girls, she was somewhat inclined toward him and failed to remember that the time for the fire sacrifice was passing.</p>
<p><strong>GROUP SEX</strong></p>
<p>What else can be more disgusting than this? Balrama the elder brother of Krishna went to the Gopis which were abandoned by Krishna, they addressed him in the following way,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 10.65.11-12 “For Kṛṣṇa’s sake, O descendant of Dāśārha, we abandoned our mothers, fathers, brothers, husbands, children and sisters, even though these family relations are difficult to give up. But now, O Lord, that same Kṛṣṇa has suddenly abandoned us and gone away, breaking off all affectionate ties with us. And yet how could any woman fail to trust His promises?” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Balrama followed the footsteps of his younger brother Krishna. Balrama had sex with all of them instead of telling them to lead a chaste life,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 10.65.17-18 ”Lord Balarama, the Personality of Godhead, resided there for the two months of Madhu and Mādhava, and during the nights <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">He gave His cowherd girlfriends conjugal pleasure</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">In the company of numerous women, Lord Balarama enjoyed in a garden</span> by the Yamunā River. This garden was bathed in the rays of the full moon and caressed by breezes bearing the fragrance of night-blooming lotuses.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Swami Prabhupada tries his level best to show that these Gopis were different from those enjoyed by Krishna. But Srimad Bhagavatam10.65.9-10 clearly tells that those Gopis who were enjoyed by Balrama were the same Gopis that Krishna had enjoyed. Balrama like his brother Krishna was not ashamed at all copulating with numerous women at the same time. Another passage from Srimad Bhavatam shows that Apsaras also have a group sex,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 4.6.25 ”My dear Kṣattā, Vidura, the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">celestial damsels come down to those rivers in their airplanes with their husbands, and after sexual enjoyment</span>, they enter the water and enjoy sprinkling their husbands with water.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>As per the story mentioned in Srimad Bhagavatam a sage named Kardama divided himself into 9 men and impregnated his wife with 9 discharges,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 3.23.47 ”The powerful Kardama Muni was the knower of everyone’s heart, and he could grant whatever one desired. Knowing the spiritual soul, he regarded her as half of his body. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Dividing himself into nine forms, he impregnated Devahuti with nine discharges of semen</span>.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p><a href="#top">top</a></p>
<h2><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Immorality</span></h2>
<p>Hinduism has many more immoral things prescribed in the scripture. When Shiva’s wife died, he held her dead body and kissed her frequently which can be considered Necrophilia,</p>
<p>Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Krishna Janma Khanda 43.1-24 ”…Lamenting thus and afflicted with grief, he held the dead body of his beloved wife to his breast and kissed and embraced it again and again. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Siva pressed his lips to the lips of his beloved</span> and embracing her repeatedly swooned again” Tr. Rajendra Nath Sen</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Padma Purana 1.31.123-127 states that Shiva offered his testicles to a hungry Shivaduti as food, </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Padma Purana, Srsti Khanda section 1, chapter 31, verses 123-127 &#8220;Thus addressed Maheśvara, the god of gods, told them in the vicinity of Pārvatī about their food: “I have accomplished the food prepared in many ways. All that is exhausted. And no other (kind of </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">food) is seen here&#8230;. I shall give you as food which has never been tasted before by anyone. Below my navel are these two circular long and fruit-like testicles. Even with this food you will have great satisfaction.” Tr. N.A. Deshpande</span></p>
<p>Vishnu exchanged his wives, he gave his wives to Shiva and Brahma,</p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 9.6.45-67 “…Now go in full Amsas to Brahmâ and become His wife. Let Gangâ go also in Her fullness to S&#8217;iva. Let Padmâ remain with Me. Padmâ is of a peaceful nature, void of anger, devoted to Me and of a Sâttvika nature&#8230;” Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Also mentioned in Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Prakriti Khanda, Chapter 6, Verse 13-60</p>
<p>It is mentioned in Shastra that if a younger brother gets married before his elder brother is married then he should give his wife to the elder brother and later take her back after his elder brother has copulated with his wife,</p>
<p>Vasistha Dharma Shastra 20.8-10 Now he who has taken a wife before his elder brother shall perform a Krikkhra penance and an Atikrikkra penance, give (his wife) to that (elder brother), marry again, and take (back) the same (woman whome he wedded first). The husband of a younger sister married before her elder sister shall perform a Krikkhra penance during twelve days, marry and take to him that (elder sister). The husband of an elder sister married after the younger one shall perform a Krikkhra penance and an Atikrikkhra penance, give (his wife) to that (husband of the younger sister and marry again).</p>
<p>This is also mentioned in Mahabharata,</p>
<p>Mahabharata 12.165.67-70 “If a younger brother weds before his elder brother, then the younger brother, the elder brother and the woman that is married, all three, in consequence of such wedding, become fallen. All of them should observe the vows prescribed for a person who has neglected his sacrificial fire, or practise the vow of Chandrayana for a month, or some other painful vow, for cleansing themselves of their sin. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The younger brother, wedding, should give his wife unto his unmarried elder brother</span>. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Afterwards, having obtained the permission of the elder brother, the younger brother may take back his wife</span>.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Manu Smriti censures the marriage of a younger brother while the elder brother remains single,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 3.171-2 He must be considered as a Parivettri who marries or begins the performance of the Agnihotra before his elder brother, but the latter as a Parivitti. The elder brother who marries after the younger, the younger brother who marries before the elder, the female with whom such a marriage is contracted, he who gives her away, and the sacrificing priest, as the fifth, all fall into hell.</p>
<p>A story in Skanda Purana goes like this,</p>
<p>Skanda Purana I.i.21.112-115 “On being rebuked thus by Rati, the excellent sage Narada himself hurriedly went to Sambara, the leading Daitya. He intimated to the king of Daityas that Madana had been burned by Rudra who had become furious. Then he continued: ‘His wife is a noble-minded lady. Bring her here, O highly fortunate one. Make her your wife, O mighty one. Among all those beautiful ladies who have been brought by you, that Rati, the wife of Madana, will be the most beautiful one.’ On hearing these words of the celestial sage of sanctified soul, he went to that place where the highly splendid lady was staying.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Rati insults Sage Narada for his overtures. Sage Narada takes revenge by instigating Sambara, king of Daityas, to abduct Rati and marry her. He abducts her but couldn’t marry her as he is unable to touch her as Rati decreed that he would be reduced to ashes if he touches her so he makes her the chief of his kitchen under the name of Mayavati. Such was the character of the Hindu sage that he instigated a Daitya king to abduct and marry her just because she insulted him.</p>
<p>Ravana describes the beauty of Sita,<br />
Valmiki Ramayana, Aranya Kanda 3.46.16-20 “While standing before her then Ravana eyed at the auspicious wife of Rama, whose lips and teeth are fine, visage is shiny like a full moon, and who is presently tortured by her tearful lamentation and sitting in the straw-cottage, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">and he approached that lotus-petal eyed Vaidehi who is dressed in ochry silks</span>, as that night-walker is gladdened at his heart for her solitude. Glittering like the glitter of gold, silkened in ochry silks, you are like a lotus-tendril garlanded with divine lotuses as your ensemble, who are you?” Thus Ravanan started addressing Seetha. “Oh, rosy faced one, are you the personified numen of Respect, Renown or Resplendence, or the Felicitous Lakshmi herself, or oh, curvaceous one, are you a nymphal Apsara, or the numen of Benefactress, or a self-motivated woman, or Rati Devi, the consort of Manmatha, the Love God. “Your hips are beamy, thighs burly akin to elephant’s trunks, <span style="color: #ff0000;">and these two breasts of yours that are ornamented with best jewellery are rotund, rubbing and bumping each other, and they are swinging up and up, their nipples are brawny and jutting out, and they are smoothish like palm-fruits, thus they are covetable for they are beautiful</span>.” Tr. Shri Desi Raju Hanumantha Rao</p>
<p>Sita was wearing a silk saree so it’s possible that her breasts and nipples were visible through that saree or it could be that she had denuded herself.</p>
<p><strong>BLACK MAGIC</strong></p>
<p>Hinduism teaches extremely obscene black magic spells and techniques.</p>
<p>Khadira Grihya Sutras 1.4.15-16. At the time of her courses <span style="text-decoration: underline;">he should touch with his right hand her secret parts with (the verse)</span>, ‘May Vishnu make thy womb ready’ (MB. I, 4, 6). When (that verse) is finished, he should cohabit with her, with (the verse), ‘Give conception’ (l.l. 7).</p>
<p>Narada Purana III.84.32-35 “In the north-eastern corner he shall duly worship Vighnaraja accompanied by his beloved. He is shining with goad and noose in his hands. His fingers are engaged in touching the beloved’s private parts. He is naked and holds a skull filled with wine. With the tusk he is holding a bowl that shines and from which jewels roll down. He shall worship Pusti who is also naked. Her features resembles saffron. She is unfettered in her intoxicated gestures and movements. With one hand, she holds a red lotus and with the other she touches penis. She is pink in colour. She has embraced her lover. The two treasures are to be worshipped…” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Narada Purana III.84.24-26 “He who meditates on the vaginal passage of a woman splashed with the menstrual blood and repeats the mantra ten thousand times, shall certainly fascinate and captivate the people by means of sweet poesy. The devotee shall meditate on Kali as follows: She is stationed on the chest of Shiva who is on the Yantra with fifteen corners. She is engaged in amorous battle with lord Mahakala and is smiling sweetly. The devotee himself shall perform sexual intercourse. even as he does so he shall repeat the mantra a thousand times. [29] While during the day, the devotee should take sacrificial meals and during the night while engaged in sexual intercourse he should repeat the mantra a hundred thousand times. He shall thereby become a king” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p><strong>Technique to secure the love of Husband</strong></p>
<p>Agni Purana 302.7-18 ”…The above Mantra sacred to the goddess Chamunda, should be deemed as the best of charms. A wife, should wash her vagina with the expressed juice of the drugs known as the Triphala, whereby she would be able to win her husband’s affections for good. Similarly a wife should apply over her private parts, a paste composed of Ashvagandha, barley, turmeric, camphor, Pippali, the eight sorts of grain known as the Ashtadhanya, Vrihati, and twenty black pepper, who would thereby retain the affection of her husband for the last day of her life…” Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Below is the verse telling how to secure the love of husband and how to stop him from going to other women,</p>
<p>Garuda Purana, Dhanvantari Samhita 203. ”…A plaster composed of Samdhava, Krishna Lavanam, galls of fishes, and sugar pasted together with honey and clarified butter may be applied by a woman to her own private parts before sharing the bed of a man. The man, who will know her thus, will never visit any other woman in his life…” Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Agni Purana 313.15-23 ”…The same Mantra, repeated by a man or a wife at the time of sexual intercourse, would captivate his or her mind forever. A man, fondly looking at the nudity of a woman, or touching her while repeating the Mantra, is sure to enthrall her mind for good…” Tr. M.N Dutt</p>
<p>Hindu scriptures has such techniques for men also,</p>
<p>Garuda Purana Ch 208 ”O thou supreme deity, O thou beloved of Parvati, let a man, during an act of sexual congress, take his own seed, and smear the left leg of the woman therewith with this left hand, whereby he is sure to bring her under his control. O thou supreme deity, the application of a plaster composed of pigeon’s dung and rock-salt pasted together with honey by a man, before an act of coitus, to his own reproductive organ, enables him to bring the woman under his control. Take five red flowers of different species, and Privangu, equal in weight with these flowers; and paste them together. The plastering of his reproductive organ with this paste, before an act of sexual union, gives a man the power of fascinating the woman.” Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Demons suck the blood of menstruating women,</p>
<p>Garuda Purana 2.22.61-62 ”[Ghosts said] We lick up the urine mixed with semen from the vaginal passage of the widow having illicit intercourse with her paramour. Dear friend, I am ashamed to tell you about the food we take. O pious brahmana, we lick up the menstrual blood from the generative organ of a woman.” J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Giving breasts to Brahmana to suck before son. A woman insisted a Brahmana to suck her breasts and he did it,</p>
<p>Skanda Purana V.iii.20.47-48 Sri Devi said:- If a righteous son well-known all over the world is to be born to me, I will first breast-feed a Brahmana and then alone my son. O great sage, such a son has been born to me. O eminent Brahmana, if you wish to be alive suck the breasts.” Tr. G.V. tagare</p>
<p>The above verses may sound decent after reading Narada Purana verses. The Narada Purana contains many absurd black magic spells,</p>
<p>Narada Purana III.84.22-24 ”In the cremation ground the devotee shall sit naked on the chest of a corpse. Repeating the mantra he shall offer a thousand flowers of the arka plant smearing them with his own semen. With these flowers he shall devotedly worship the goddess. Ere long, he shall become the lord of the earth. He who meditates on the vaginal passage of a woman splashed with the menstrual blood and repeats the mantra ten thousand times, shall certainly fascinate and captivate the people by means of sweet poesy.” Tr. Board of Scholars, Edited by J.L. Shastri</p>

<p>Narada Purana III.87.32-36 ”On the fourteenth day of the dark fortnight, during the pitch dark midnight, the devotee shall take bath and wear red garments, garlands and unguents. He must bring a woman of youthful charms to represent the deity Chinnamasta and worship her. She must be beautiful and capable of having intercourse with five men, be of smiling look and have her hair dishevelled. She should be made satisfied by offering her ornaments. She must be made naked and worshipped and then he must repeat the mantra ten thousand times. After giving her offering and spending the night she should be sent away fully contended with gifts of wealth. He shall then deef the brahmins with different kinds of food. In this manner, he shall attain good fortune, sons, grandsons, wealth, fame, good wife, longevity, happiness, virtue and desired things.” Tr. Board of Scholars, Edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Narada Purana III.84.32-33 ”In the north-eastern corner he shall duly worship Vigjnaraja accompanied by his beloved. He is shining with goad and noose in his hands.

<p>In ancient India Brother and sister used to marry each other, says Swami Chandermoli<br />

<p>As per Brihadaranyaka Upanishad all creatures were born after God raped his own daughter,</p>
<p>Birhadaranyaka Upanishad 1.4.3-4 “He was not at all happy. Therefore people (still) are not happy when alone. He desired a mate. He became as big as man and wife embracing each other. He parted this very body into two. From that came husband and wife. Therefore, said Yajnavalkya, this (body) is one-half of oneself, like one of the two halves of a split pea. Therefore this space is indeed filled by the wife. He was united with her. From that men were born. She thought, ‘How can he be united with me after producing me from himself? Well, let me hide myself.’ She became a cow, the other became a bull and was united with her; from that cows were born. The one became a mare, the other a stallion; the one became she-ass, the other became a he-ass and was united with her; from that one hoofed animals were born. The one became a ewe, the other became a ram and was united with her; from that goats and sheep were born. Thus did he project everything that exists in pairs, down to the ants.” Tr. Swami Madhavananda</p>
<p>Adi Shankaracharya wrote on this verse,</p>
<p>‘’He, the Viraj called Manu, was united with her, his daughter called Satarupa, whom he conceived of as his wife. From that union men were born.’’ by Shankara on Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 1.4.3, Shankara Bhashya, p.101, Tr. Swami Madhavananda.</p>
<p>Manu and his daughter Ida incest,</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana 1:8:1:7-10 &#8220;Being desirous of offspring, he engaged in worshipping and austerities. During this time he also performed a pâka-sacrifice: he offered up in the waters clarified butter, sour milk, whey, and curds. Thence a woman was produced in a year: becoming quite solid she rose; clarified butter gathered in her footprint. Mitra and Varuna met her. They said to her, &#8216;Who art thou?&#8217; &#8216;Manu&#8217;s daughter,&#8217; she replied. &#8216;Say (thou art) ours,&#8217; they said. &#8216;No,&#8217; she said, &#8216;I am (the daughter) of him who begat me.&#8217; They desired to have a share in her. She either agreed or did not agree, but passed by them. She came to Manu. Manu said to her, &#8216;Who art thou?&#8217; &#8216;Thy daughter,&#8217; she replied. &#8216;How, illustrious one, (art thou) my daughter?&#8217; he asked. She replied, &#8216;Those offerings (of) clarified butter, sour milk, whey, and curds, which thou madest in the waters, with them thou hast begotten me. I am the blessing (benediction): make use of me at the sacrifice! If thou wilt make use of me at the sacrifice, thou wilt become rich in offspring and cattle. Whatever blessing thou shalt invoke through me, all that shall be granted to thee!&#8217; He accordingly made use of her (as the benediction) in the middle of the sacrifice; for what is intermediate between the fore-offerings and the after-offerings, is the middle of the sacrifice. With her he went on worshipping and performing austerities, wishing for offspring. Through her he generated this race, which is this race of Manu; and whatever blessing he invoked through her, all that was granted to him. Now this (daughter of Manu) is essentially the same as the Idâ&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Julius Eggeling</p>
<p>Krishna’s son by Rukmini was Pradumnya. When he was seven days old he was carried away by an Asura prince named Samvara and was entrusted to the care of his childless wife Mayavati (Harivamsa, Visnu Parva, 104, 6-7). When Pradumnya grew up into manhood Mayavati one day offered her love to him. He was at first shocked at this unseemly behaviour having been under the impression that she was his mother. Knowing from her the fact of this birth in the Yadava family he killed Samvara and married her (Vishnu Purana 5.27; Srimad Bhagavatam 10.55).</p>
<p>Another wife of Pradumnya was Rukmavati, who was the daughter of his maternal uncle Rukmi (Srimad Bhagatan 10.61). Here is again a case of marriage within the prohibited degree.</p>
<p>Pradumnya’s son Aniruddha similarly married his maternal uncle’s daughter, Rochna, who was the grand-daughter of Rukmi (Srimad Bhagavatam 10.61).</p>
<p>Samba was the son of Krishna born to his wife Jambavati. Krishna’s sixteen thousand wives were sexually aroused seeing their step son Samba. So Krishna in anger cursed his son.</p>
<p>Varaha Purana 177.2-31 “When Krsna was living there with his wives and sons, once Narada stepped in…But Narada took Krsna aside and spoke to him in private. ‘I have to tell you something in secret. Please liten. Your son Samba is young, eloquent and handsome is longed by all the women here. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The Supreme God gave you these sixteen hundred divine women for your pleasure. Their minds get agitated (with love) when they see Samba, and this (scandal) has spread even in Brahmaloka</span>…By calling Samba and all this multitute of women and seating them here, I shall show you whether what I say is true or false…Then Samba entered with folded hands and waited to know the command (of Krsna). Seeing the exceptionally handsome Samba, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">all those noble women felt agitated in mind even when Krsna was watching them</span>. Then Krsna asked these beloved women of his to get up and go to their homes and they did so… Looking at Narada, Krsna bent down his face in shame. He then told Narada in detail about the nature of women and their conduct leading to sin. ‘They have no consideration of time, of secrecy of what they do. Still they pass to be virtous. Women irrespective of their age, whether they be girls, teenagers, middle-aged or advanced in age, get their passion excited at the sight of a handsome man. O great sage, this is natural to them… A chariot does not move, ‘ (he said), ‘with a single wheel alone. It is only with the response of men do women get excited with passion. They get gratified by the looks of men. Seeing (your other son) Pradyumna, they become highly shy. But by seeing Samba, they become stricken with passion and the sandal paste and such other things (on his body) act as additional excitants. So Samba must be held responsible for ruining your women and you cannot obliterate the scandal that has reached even Satyaloka…Krsna then cursed Samba to become ugly and immediately he became a leper. Foul smelling blood began to ooze from his body which became full of wounds.” Tr. Venkitasubramonia Iyer, J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Skanda Purana VII.I.101.1-38 “At this very juncture (came) venerable sage Narada…In the court of his wandering at will, he always used to come to Dvaravati to pay a visit to Vasudeva. As he came on quickly all the Yadava youths beginning with Pradyumna remained with their heads (politely) bent down…but Samba due to the inevitability of the curse, slighted the noble souled Narada as usual. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Being very proud of his youth and handsome features he was forever indulgent in sexual dalliance and liquor</span>. On seeing him impolite and rude, Narada thought thus: Today I shall try to curb this impolite one…After thinking thus, he spoke to Vasudeva: O most excellent one among Devas, here there are sixteen thousand women. O my Lord, their emotional fondness for Samba is much…On hearing these words from Narada, Kesava began to think. What has thus been mentioned by Narada may have some truth in it…Narada went away as he came. A few days thereafter, he returned to Dvaraka. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">On that day the Lord was engaged in drinking liquor after enjoying aquatic sports along with all the members of his Antahpura (inner apartment)…Staying there the Lord drank the liquor of great auspicious flavour</span>. In the meantime, fully aware that the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">women were inebriated due to liquor</span>, Narada spoke to Samba: ‘O princely youth, do come and stand here. The Lord calls you. It is not proper on my part to stay on there.’ Urged by Narada…Samba entered quickly and bowed down to his father. He took the seat pointed out by Visnu with natural feeling. In the meantime those women there who were deficient in self control became highly agitated as soon as they saw Samba. As they were staying within the Antahpura so long, they had not seen him before. The liquor had its own effect in making them forget everything. Further they were naturally devoid of self control. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Hence their loins became moistened. On seeing an excellent man, the excellent organ of generation of women becomes moistened and dump</span> even if they are observing celibacy or are Yoginis…After sending Samba in, Narada also came hurriedly closely on the heels of Samba. On seeing the sage coming with pleasant manners, all those women suddenly got up; they were tipsy. Even as Vasudeva was watching, when they got up suddenly their valuable garments got torn and fell down into the pots (of liquor). The clothes clinging to their loins (underwear) also fell separately. On seeing it Hari became angry, he cursed those women: O women, since your minds strayed elsewhere unmindful of me, you will not get into the regions occupied by your husband at the close of your life. Slipping down from the world of your husband as well as from the path of heaven, you will have no refuge and will fall into the clutches of robbers. As a result of this defect and curse, those women, at the time of Krsna’s heavenward departure, were abducted by robbers belonging to Pancanada even as Arjuna was looking on.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>There is another version of this story,</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 70.2- “Siva said:- There will be 16,000 wives of Krisna in the Yuga mentioned before. When once, in the spring time, those ladies, having decorated themselves with ornaments, would be drinking together on the banks of a pond studded with full budded lotus flowers, dancing with the wind and resounding with the melodious notes of the cuckoo and musical tunes of the big black bee, they will see Lord Samba, beautiful like Cupid, having eyes handsome like those of a gazelle, and wearing the garlands of malati, passing by. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">They will cast on him amorous glances, their hearts being fired with lustful feelings and they being targets of the arrows of Cupid</span>. Lord Krishna will come to know all that with his mental vision, and will curse them as follows: ‘Because you cherished the desire of amorous pastime during my absence, all of you will be taken away by bandits.” Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>During the propagation of living beings, Manu sprang from the lower half of Brahma and Satarupa from the left-hand side of Brahma’s body. And these two siblings then begat a couple of children,</p>
<p>Srimad Devi Bhagavatam 3.13.15-16 “Next Svayambhava Manu sprang from the lower half of Brahma; and the daughter named Satarupa came out of the left hand side of the Brahma’s body. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The two sons Priyavrata and Uttânapâda were born of Manu in the womb of S’atarûpâ</span> and the three daughters, very beautiful and fair complexioned, were also born of him.” Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Another version shows that when Prajapati created sons and a daughter from himself his sons were attracted to their sister and out of desire they discharged semen which Brahma preserved in a bowl</p>
<p>Kausitaki Brahmana 6.1.1-12 “P<span style="text-decoration: underline;">rajapati, being desirous of propagation, underwent penance; from him when heated were born five, Agni, Vayu, Adityaa, Candramas, and Usas as fifth</span>. He said to them, ‘Do ye also practise fervour.’ They consecrated themselves; then when they had consecrated themselves and had acquired fervour, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Usas, offspring of Prajapati, taking </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">the form of an Apsaras, came out in front of them; to her their minds inclined; they poured out seed</span>; they went to Prajapati, their father, and said, ‘We have poured out seed; let it not remain here’. Prajapati made a golden bowl, an arrow breadth in height and similar in breadth; in it he poured the seed; then arose he of a thousand eyes, of a thousand feet, with a thousand fitted (arrows).” Tr. A.B. Keith</p>
<p>Hindus view marriages with cousins as incestuous, but Krishna himself is said to have married his paternal aunt’s daughter. Mitravinda was the daughter of Rajadhidevi who was the sister of Krishna’s father Vasudeva making Mitravinda the first cousin of Krishna,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 10.58.31 “My dear King, Lord Kṛṣṇa forcibly took away Princess Mitravindā, the daughter of His aunt Rājādhidevī, before the eyes of the rival kings.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Krishna is said to have married another cousin named Bhadra,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 10.58.56 “Bhadrā was a princess of the Kaikeya kingdom and the daughter of Lord Kṛṣṇa’s paternal aunt Śrutakīrti. The Lord married Bhadrā when her brothers, headed by Santardana, offered her to Him.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 10.83.15-16 “Śrī Bhadrā said: My dear Draupadī, of his own free will my father invited his nephew Kṛṣṇa, to whom I had already dedicated my heart, and offered me to Him as His bride. My father presented me to the Lord with an akṣauhiṇi military guard and a retinue of my female companions. My ultimate perfection is this: to always be allowed to touch Lord Kṛṣṇa’s lotus feet as I wander from life to life, bound by my karma.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>I find it quite ironic that Hindus make fun of Muslims for marrying first cousin, Consanguineous marriages or marriage with cousins is prevalent among Hindus, as per National Family Health Survey 5 (NFHS-5) survey, 10.1% of Hindu women married to a blood relative. Whereas Hindus, accuse Muslims of “marrying sisters” despite the fact that a sizeable Hindu population has married their cousins, above all their Krishna is said to have married his first cousins. Some Hindus in Karnataka, Telangana, and parts of Maharashtra marry their niece.</p>
<p>Krishna also had affair with his maternal aunt Radha who was married to Rayana the brother of Yashoda who was the mother of Krishna,</p>
<p>Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Prakriti Khanda, Chapter 49, Verses 36-43 &#8220;In the Varaha-kalpa, Radhika was born in the village of Gokula in the family of a Vaisya cowherd. She was born without any human contact&#8230;After the expiry of twelve years, finding her becoming youthful, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">she was married to a trader named Rayana</span>; at the time of her marriage only a shadow of Radha was married to the trader while the real Radha herself disappeared. After the expiry of fourteen years Krsna, the lord of the universe appeared there as an infant&#8230;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">This Rayana was the real brother of Yasodha the mother of Krsna</span> who happened to be an amsa of Krsna in Gokula and was his maternal uncle in the sacred forest of Vrndavana. Brahma the creator of the universe had performed the marriage of Radha with Krsna. Radha whose lotus-like feet were beyond the sight of cowherds even in dream, the same <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Radha enjoyed the lap of lord Krsna and her shadow was very much present in the house of Rayana</span>.&#8221; Tr. Shanti Lal Nagar</p>
<p>Krishna though his &#8220;mystical powers&#8221; appeared in the dream of Gopis and his mother, after having sex with Gopis in their dreams the adult Krishna sucked the breast of his mother Yashoda. Though it was a dream but adult Krishna did this being in full consciousness,</p>
<p>Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Krishna Janma Khanda, Chapter 98, Verses 41-44 &#8220;In spite of that I shall honour your words, I shall go to Radhika, the cowherdesses and my mother Yasoda in dream. On hearing this the glorious Uddhava went back to his abode. Then lord Krsna reached Gokula which was suffering from separation. In the dream he assured Radhika and bestowed the divine knowledge on her and satisfied the cowherdesses with various types of sports. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">He sucked the breast of Yasoda</span> who was enjoying the deep sleep and asurring the cowherds and the cowherd boys variouslly, he returned to Mathura.&#8221; Tr. Shanti Lal Nagar, edited by Acharya Ramesh Chaturvedi</p>
<p>Krishna and his foster mother Yashoda were lovers says Hindu scholar Sadhguru, “Yashoda was the foster mother of Krishna. She loved him. But, this love was not merely a motherly love. It was till Krishna was an infant. Krishna grew too fast. Then, that love changed into that of a lover. She started doing Rasa with Krishna&#8230;”<br />

<p>Baudhyana permits cousin marriages for south Indian Hindus,</p>
<p>Baudhayana Dharma Shastra, Prasna I, Adhyaya 1, Kandika 2, verses 3-5 They are, to eat in the company of an uninitiated person, to eat in the company of one’s wife, to eat stale food, to marry the daughter of a maternal uncle or of a paternal aunt…He who follows (these practices) in any other country than where they prevail, commits sin.</p>
<p>A story in Mahabharata says that after Asura Ilwala killed the pitrs of Rishi Agastya, they requested Agastya to beget a son that would save them from the pit (hell). As requested by them Rishi Agastya first creates a girl with an intention of marrying her. Logically this makes her the daughter of Rishi Agastya. After creating her, Rishi Agastya gives her to a childless king who was performing penance to obtain progeny, and the king adopts the girl child who was named Lopamudra. After reaching the proper age fit to beget a child, Rishi Agastya marries her and begets a child,</p>
<p>Mahabharata 3.96.18-25 “…Agastya replied, saying, ‘Ye Pitris, I will accomplish your desire. Let this anxiety of yours be dispelled.’ And the illustrious Rishi then began to think of perpetuating his race. But he saw not a wife worthy of him on whom he himself could take his birth in the form of a son. The Rishi accordingly, taking those parts that were regarded as highly beautiful, from creatures possessing them, created therewith an excellent woman. And the Muni, endued with great ascetic merit, thereupon gave that girl created for himself to the king of the Vidharbhas who was then undergoing ascetic penances for obtaining offspring. And that blessed girl of sweet face (thus disposed of) then took her birth (in Vidarbha’s royal line) and, beautiful as the effulgent lightning, her limbs began to grow day by day…” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Mahabharata 3.97.8-9 “…And at these words of his daughter, O monarch, the king gave away Lopamudra unto the illustrious Agastya with due rites. And obtaining her as wife…” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>A sage named Yajnavalkya accidentally impregnated his own sister,</p>
<p>Skanda Purana V.iii.42.8-12 ”She attended to his needs and stayed there performing penance. On a certain occassion, she had her monthly course during the day when she took her bath. She saw a rag kept concealed and so wore it as her undergarment. In the meantime, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">at night Yajnavalkya had an erotic dream in a place where there was none. As a result of the dream, there was an emission of semen in his loin cloth</span>. It resembled a drop of blood…The poor Brahmana woke up and found the piece of cloth defiled. He thought it not worthy of being touched and so cast it off and washed himself clean in accordance with the injunctions in the Smrti texts. Bath at night has been prohibited. So the Brahmana went to sleep again. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">At midnight the woman took this cloth and covered her vaginal aperture</span>.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>She later abandoned the child,</p>
<p>Skanda Purana V.iii.42.16-24 ”O lady of auspicious Vratas, it is none of your faults nor mine. Of the foetus in your womb, fate alone is the cause. It has to be carefully preserved by you forever. It should not be destroyed. It should be awaited till the whole period is over.” The chaste lady was ashamed. Yet she said in distress, ”So be it”. She nurturted the child in the womb till the normal deliver. As soon as the child was born, the Brahmana lady came to the root of a banyan tree. Abandoning the child there she spoke thus: ”May all those living beings in all the worlds, mobile and immoble, protect this child abandoned by me.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Is it really possible that a woman conceives a child just by wearing a loin cloth in which semen was emitted? In my opinion, this sage Yajnavalkya had intercourse with her and later gave this lame excuse. The semen dries quickly and it needs to be put into the female organ to impregnate a woman, how did she conceive the child just by wearing that loin cloth. It is very doubtful.</p>

<h2><a id="Prostitution"></a><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Prostitution</span></h2>
<p>Some Hindu text prohibits prostitution but some also permit it. Devdasi means servant of god, Devdasi should dance in the temple and she is also forced into prostitution and sexually abused by the Brahmins. Although Devdasi is banned by the government but Temple prostitution or sacred prostitution is still prevalent in many parts of India,<br />
According to a report by a one-man commission headed by Justice Raghunath Rao in 2015, there are 80,000 Devdasi in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh states.<br />
<a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Devadasi-system-still-exists-in-Telangana-AP-says-report/articleshow/46337859.cms" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Devadasi-system-still-exists-in-Telangana-AP-says-report/articleshow/46337859.cms<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>As per Theguardian.com’s 2011 report “The National Commission for Women estimate that there are 48,358 Devadasis currently in India.”<br />
<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/jan/21/devadasi-india-sex-work-religion" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/jan/21/devadasi-india-sex-work-religion<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>And as per TheHindu.com “Quoting the National Commission for Women, the authority says there are 2.5 lakh “Devadasi” girls who have been dedicated to Yellamma and Khandoba temples on Maharastra-Karnataka border. This includes 16,624 from Andhra Pradesh, 22,941 from Karnataka and 2,479 from Maharastra. The Devadasi system is prevalent in 10 districts of north Karnataka and 14 districts in Andhra Pradesh.”<br />

<p>One can find the permissibility of this evil practice in Hindu scriptures,</p>
<p>Padma Purana V.113.40-46b ”Vasistha said:- O king, you have not asked enough. That is said to be holy which enables one to be more sportive, O king. He should make Siva’s temple white with whitewash on all sides. He should have women who are endowed with beauty and graceful movements, adorned with all ornaments, skilled in (singing) many good songs, and proficient in various kinds of dancing…All should be beautiful and should have graceful movements. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">All should be of firm breasts. They should be skilled in the ways of sexual love</span> and should be trustworthy…O king, he who has <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">caused women like this to dance (even) on one day, gets into a (divine) aeroplane in a year</span>.” Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p>Vijay Mallya should learn something from these verses, As Kingfisher airline has incurred a huge loss. Is it a temple or a nightclub that asks its followers to construct a temple and make girls dance before men? A story mentioned in Padma Purana shows that Krishna cursed his 16100 wives to become prostitutes (after his death) as they were enamored seeing their step-son Samba. Krishna&#8217;s wives are then instructed by sage Dalbhya Caikitayana on how to lead their life in temple prostitution. This chapter of Padma Purana is titled “The vows of Prostitutes”, the title of the chapter itself is a summary of the chapter which shows that temple prostitution is permissible in Hinduism,</p>
<p>Padma Purana 1.23.74b-87a “The Lord said: O Brahman, born from the lotus, in the same city there will be sixteen thousand wives of Vasudeva. Krsna, the universal soul, having eyes like those of a deer, the dignified scion of Yadu family, who had put the garland of Malati flowers on his head, and being adorned with his praiseworthy wives, will enjoy with them in a garden rich with flowers, and situated on the bank of a lake, in the spring season abounding in cuckoos and swarms of bees. Samba, Jambavatl’s son, adorned with all (kinds of ornaments), going along with the path nearby, really of the form of Cupid, will be longingly seen by the ladies and passion will be aroused in the hearts of them who will be tormented by the arrows of Cupid. He, the lord of the world, the omniscient master, having perceived it with his eye of contemplation, will say to them: “The evil being will kidnap you, since you have thus entertained the passion of love (for Samba) in my presence.” Then the revered lord, the cause of beings, the holder of the bow made of horn, being propitiated (by the ladies) tormented with the curse, will say this: “(You will observe) the vow, beneficial in the future, which sage Dalbhya, emancipator of the fishermen living in the north and of an unlimited (generosity of) mind will tell you.” Saying so and leaving them, the lord vanished. Then after a (long) time when the burden (on the earth as a result of the great Bharatawar) will be lightened and when the fight with clubs (among the Yadavas) will be over, when Kesava will have come back to the heaven, when the entire Yadu-family will be no more, when even Arjuna will be defeated by the thieves, when Krsna’s wives will be kidnapped and will be enjoyed by the fishermen for a hundred million years and when they will be (thus) tormented, a devout soul, Dalbhya by name, with great penance (to his credit) will come there.”</p>
<p>Padma Purana 1.23.91-121 “O revered sir, all of us have been perforce enjoyed by the evil beings; we have slipped from (i.e. erred in) our duty. You are our refuge. O brahmana, you have been formerly instructed by the intelligent Kesava. Why have we become prostitutes after having come in contact with the lord? <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">O you, whose wealth is penance, explain to us the duties of the prostitutes</span>.” I shall tell you what Dalbhya Caikitayana said to them. Dalbhya said: Formerly Narada approached you, who were proud, while (you were) sporting in the water of the Manasa lake. All of you were daughters of Agni and were the nymphs in olden days. Not saluting Narada through haughtiness you asked the sage conversant with deep and abstract meditation: “Advise us as to how Narayana will be our husband.” From him, this boon and this curse came forth (i.e. Narada gave this boon to and pronounced this curse on the ladies) in ancient days: “By giving a couple of beds with articles of gold (to a brahmana) on the twelfth day of the bright fortnight of Caitra and Vaisakha, Narayana will certainly be your husband (i.e. you will obtain Narayana as your husband); (and) since, you asked me (a question) without saluting me, due to your selfish addiction to your beauty and good fortune, you will be kidnapped by thieves and will become prostitutes.” Thus, due to the curse of Narada and also that of Kesava, all of you, deluded by passion, have become prostitutes. O you excellent ladies, listen, even now, to what I shall say. The lord of lords, the best speaker, formerly said to the hundreds and thousands of thousands of the wives of the demons, the Asuras (the evil spirits—enemies of gods), the sons of Diti and the goblins, when these (ladies) were married and enjoyed by force (by the gods), after hundreds of the Asuras and demons were killed by the gods in the war between gods and Asuras (that took place) in ancient days: “<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">O you devout and beautiful ladies, now live as prostitutes in king’s </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">residences and in temples of gods</span>; you will obtain your livelihood from the king and the master; and all of you will have good fortune as per your capacity. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">He, who enters your house with the fee should be served by you with attitude of love void of deceit</span>… At that time, he, having the five arrows as his soul (i.e. Cupid), will go (i.e. remain) near Hari. She should worship the lotus-eyed (god i.e. Visnu), followed by eulogies of Cupid. She should worship the feet (of the image of the deity saying:) ‘My salutation to Kama’; (she should worship) the shanks (saying:) ‘My salutation to Vaimohakarin’; (she should worship) the generative organ (of the image of the deity saying:) ‘My salutation to Kandarpanidhi…Having thus worshipped Govinda, the lord of the form of Ananga, the lady having made an offering with sandal, flowers and incense, and then having invited a Brahmana knowing customary observances, who has mastered the Vedas and who is without any deformity, and then having honoured him with adoration of sandal, flowers etc. she should give the brahmana rice of the measure of a prastha along with a pot of ghee, (saying:) ‘May Madhava be pleased’. <span style="color: #ff0000;">She should bear in mind that the best Brahmana, who has eaten well according to his sweet will, is Kamadeva meant for Rati. The lady should do whatever the best Brahmana desires</span>.”</p>
<p>Padma Purana 1.23.130b-142 “Then having circumambulated and allowed the best Brahmana to go, she should take all (the articles) like the bed, the seat, to the Brahmana’s house. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Since then whosoever comes to her house for sexual enjoyment should be similarly honoured on a Sunday and should always be adored. Thus till the thirteenth month arrives, she should gratify a Brahmana and then send him to his house</span>; with his permission (she may entertain) a handsome (person) till he arrives (to her residence). When she has a difficulty as a result of impurity due to child-birth or abortion or from the king or a difficulty due to divine or human (forces) or due to an eclipse, then she should offer herself according to her capacity, for fifty-eight times. This (vow) I have especially narrated to you, since this is the duty that should be always performed by the prostitutes in this world…”</p>
<p>Sage Dalbhya instructs them to lead prostitution just like Indra had commanded the wives of slain demons mentioned in Matsya Purana 71.26-59 which I have already mentioned in Sex Slaves category, readers are requested to read Matsya Purana 71.26-59 again to better understand this.  Agni Purana 211.37-43 also talks about gifting female slaves to Brahmins which I have mentioned in Sex Slaves category.</p>
<p>Krishna states what is done to women by priests in Soma sacrifice,</p>
<p>Garuda Purana 3.28.79 &#8220;Neither men nor women nor ascetics have any dread or shame in this respect. Men can copulate even with their sisters, that too at the day time, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">just as the priests do with the women at the Soma sacrifice</span>.’’ Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>There is a story of a Rishi named Galava who engaged his daughter into prostitution just to get horses, The story is very long and mentioned in three different sections of Mahabharata hence it’s not possible to mention every detail but I will post the summarized version created by Ibn Muhammad,</p>
<p>Mahabharata Udyog Parva section 115 “She is my daughter. She is extremely beautiful and virtuous. She is desired by every male in three worlds. She can charm any Sur, Asur, Aryan or non-Aryan. I offer my daughter to you. You can sell her to any king and manage to have your gurudakhshina.”</p>
<p>Mahabharata Udyog Parva, Section 116 “So, Rishi Galav, without any qualms of conscience, accepts the king’s daughter and mortgages her to Ayodhya’s king Haryashaw and in return gets 200 horses. He takes 200 horses, leaving Madhavi to bear a son to the king.”</p>
<p>Mahabharata Udyog Parva, sections 117 and 118 “The Rishi Galav then searched another buyer for Madhavi and this time it is king Divodas who gives 200 horses in the bargain. (Udyog Parv, section117). Then he takes her to king Ushinao and manages to strike a better bargain. He receives now 400 horses. (Udyog Parv, section 118).</p>
<p>There is a story mentioned in Brahma Purana that says that Devas exchanged Saraswati with the Asuras for Soma Ras</p>
<p>Brahma Purana Gautami Mahatmya 35.6-13 “…If Devas are prepared let them come there for sacrifice. Gandharvas are always fond of women. Exchange me for Soma”. ”So be it”, said Devas who firmly agreed to what was said by Sarasvati. Through the messengers they invited Devas, Yaksas, Gandharvas and Nagas severally to the sacred mountain. There-after, O sage, the name of that mountain became Devagiti. There came Devas, Gandharvas, Yaksas, Raksasas, Siddhas, sages and the eight species of inferior gods… [Indra said] Exchange the nectar-souled Soma of yours for Saraswati. [Brahma said] At the instance of Indra those Gandharvas, passionate over women, gave Soma to Devas and took Saraswati. Devas possessed Soma and Gandharvas possessed Saraswati.” Tr. Board of Scholars, Edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti states that a group must earn their livelihood by doing Mujra and public women (prostitution),</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti 16.12 “Vaidehakas must earn their livelihood by keeping [dancing girls and other public] women and profiting by what they acquire.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Written by Sulaiman Razvi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Qur’an states that Allah has created everything, the Bible states that God has created it, every religion whether Islam or Christianity takes a firm stand about the creator of the universe. But Vedas seems to be confused as to who created the universe. Vedas doesn’t answer who is the creator. There is no unanimous statement about who really created the universe among Hindus, some say Shiva created this entire universe, some say Vishnu or his avatars created it, some claim Brahma created it, All these stories are of Puranas and Upanishads, but we have to see only what the Vedas says about the creator because Vedas are the oldest scripture of Hinduism. Vedas also makes blunder about the process of creation. I won’t be explaining Vedic verses briefly, verses are pretty easy to understand. Readers themselves can draw conclusions after reading the verses. I am using Hindi translations of Swami Karpatri, Shri Ram Sharma and Shripad Damodar.</p>
<p><span id="more-1192"></span></p>
<p>Veda mentions different gods as the creator of the universe, Rig Veda 2.20.1; 2.13.5 says Indra created the earth, Rig Veda 10.82.1 and Yajur Veda 17.25 says Vishwakarma created the heaven and earth, Rig Veda 10.190.3 says Dhatar created the heaven, earth, sun and the moon. Atharva Veda 9.5.20 says that the breast of the God Aja became the earth, we read in Purusha Sukta that the feet of the lord became the earth, all these Vedic verses contradict each other. Atharva Veda 13.1.6 states that Rohita created the heaven and earth. A verse states that Prajapati created the universe, another verse in Yajur Veda 14.30 states that Prajapati prayed to a Divine Speech and thence earth and heaven were produced. Some also say the creation took place after the association of father and daughter mentioned in Rig Veda 10.61.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Who created living creatures?</strong></p>
<p>Vedas is confused about who created the humans or all creatures, It’s mentioned in Yajur Veda</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 14.28 With one they praised; creatures were produced…With five they praised; beings were created</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="465" height="154" class="wp-image-7269" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201.png" alt="https://truthabouthinduism.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/081514_0918_vediccontra1.png?w=625" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201.png 465w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/07/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201-300x99.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 465px) 100vw, 465px" /></p>
<p>According to scholars, Prajapati prayed to a divine speech and after that creatures were produced, So Prajapati is the creator of living beings here. Rig Veda says it were Vedic deities Indra and Varuna who created all living creatures,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rig Veda 7.82.5 O Indra-Varuna, as ye created all these creatures of the world by your surpassing might…</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="443" height="167" class="wp-image-7270" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201-1.png" alt="https://truthabouthinduism.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/081514_0918_vediccontra2.png?w=625" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201-1.png 443w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/07/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201-1-300x113.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 443px) 100vw, 443px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Atharva Vedas has another story, it says Vedic god Rohita created the creatures,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 13.1.52 Rohita made the earth to be his altar, heaven his Dakshina. Then heat he took for Agni, and with rain for molten butter he [Rohita] created every living thing [or universe].</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s analyse the Purusha Sukta. Purusha Sukta is often quoted to show the process of creation. Some Hindu scholars even say that scientists must read Purusha Sukta to know about the creation and cosmos, they say this Sukta is very unique. I can’t figure out what’s so unique about this Sukta. Later I found that its uniqueness lies in its riddles, It has so many contradictions. It’s about gods sacrificing Purusha and each of his body part becomes the creation. The word Purusha here may or may not denote Man. Purusha is literally translated as Man, but majority of scholars translates it (in this verse) as Supreme Soul (God), according to Mahidhara and Sayana it is Spirit or Man, other scholars translates it as Almighty God and Universe. If Purusha is the Almighty god then how come the Almighty God (Purusha) himself was born? Veda says,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.90.5 From him Viraj was born; again Purusa from Viraj was born…</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-7271" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201-2.png" alt="https://truthabouthinduism.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/081514_0918_vediccontra3.png?w=625" width="570" height="139" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201-2.png 418w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/07/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201-2-300x73.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 570px) 100vw, 570px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The word Viraj or Virat here is translated by some as universe. But scholars have different opinion on this word. Majority of scholars including Sayana and Mahidhara say it’s an egg. Some say it’s the egg from which the universe or Men were born, some also say it’s known as Adi Purusa. The word Viraj occurs in Atharva Veda 11.4.12 as Prana (Vital Spirit), in Atharva Veda 9.2.5 Viraj is translated as milch cow, and by Arya Samaj scholars as Splendid Speech [Goddess]. Some interpret Rig Veda 10.90.5 as, The almighty God created Viraj, and Viraj then created the Men (Purusha) or living creatures, they translate the latter word Purusha literally as Men. This is wrong since the creation of men and other living beings occurs in verses 8, 10 and 12. There is also a reference (Manu 3.195) which shows that Viraj had sons. Maharishi Manu also makes blunder about the creation which contradicts Vedas also, but on this Viraj issue he tries to make it simple saying that it was Brahma who produced Viraj, He writes</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 1.31-32 But for the sake of the prosperity of the worlds he caused the Brahmana, the Kshatriya, the Vaisya, and the Sudra to proceed from his mouth, his arms, his thighs, and his feet. Dividing his own body, the Lord became half male and half female; with that (female) he produced Virag.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So this affirms the statement of some scholars who say that Purusha is the unborn Almighty God and from him Viraj was born. But it makes the situation more complex because Vedas states in the beginning only Viraj was present and from him Purusha was born,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 19.6.9 In the beginning rose Viraj: Purusha from Viraj was born. As soon as he was born he spread westward and eastward o’er the earth.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now this is senseless and as complicated as the saying ”What came first the chicken or the egg?” This is a clear contradiction, because Purusha is unborn they say and from Purusha, Viraj was born. But this verse states the In the beginning rose (Sambhavat) Viraj and from him Purusha was born. To strengthen my argument I would like to quote next two verses of Atharva Veda 19.6.9 which would also clear the mist,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 19.6.10-11 When Gods performed the sacrifice with Purusha as their offering. Spring was the butter, summer was the fuel, autumn was the gift. That sacrifice, first-born Purusha, they hallowed with the sprinkled Rains. The Deities, the Sadhyas, all the Vasus sacrificed with him.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="602" height="141" class="wp-image-7273" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201-4.png" alt="https://truthabouthinduism.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/081514_0918_vediccontra5.png?w=625" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201-4.png 602w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/07/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201-4-300x70.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So this shows that the sacrificed Purusha was born from Viraj. Purusha was the first to take birth from Viraj. So how is it possible that the Almighty God (Purusha) himself was born from an egg (Viraj)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Who was Sacrificed?</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.90.6 When Gods prepared the sacrifice with Purusa as their offering, Its oil was spring, the holy gift was autumn; summer was the wood.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="601" height="109" class="wp-image-7274" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201-5.png" alt="https://truthabouthinduism.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/081514_0918_vediccontra6.png?w=625" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201-5.png 601w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/07/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201-5-300x54.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 601px) 100vw, 601px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is mentioned in Krishna Yajur Veda,</p>
<p>Krishna Yajur Veda 6.3.5 The Sadhya gods were in this world and nothing else living. They offered Agni as a sacrifice to Agni [Fire], for they found nothing else to offer; thence indeed these creatures were born; in that he casts the fire on the fire after producing it, (it serves for) the propagation of offspring.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How the creation of universe (or of earth) took place?</strong></p>
<p>While Purusha Sukta is often quoted, The Rig Veda 10.72 hymn is often ignored by the scholars. Both have similarity and difference. The similarity is that both these Suktas talk about how the creation took place and the difference is that both these Suktas give a complete different picture about creation of universe. According to Purusha Sukta the earth was gendered from the Almighty god’s feet (Rigved 10.90.14), while the 72<sup>nd</sup> hymn states that the earth was born from a tree,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.72.1-4 Let us proclaim with a clear voice the generations of the gods (the divine company), who, when their praises are recited, look (favourably on the worshipper) in this latter age. Brahmanaspati filled these (generations of the gods) with breath as a blacksmith (his bellows) in the first age of the gods the existent was born of the non-existent. In the first age of the gods the existent was born of the non-existent; after that the quarters (of the horizon) were born, and after them the upward-growing (trees). The earth was born from the upward-growing (tree), the quarters were born from the earth; Daksha was born from Aditi, and afterwards Aditi from Daksha. – Tr. Wilson</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Founder of Arya Samaj Swami Dayanand Saraswati argued against the creation of universe out of nothing. He criticized the Qur’an’s concept of creation out of nothing which is similar to this 72<sup>nd</sup> hymn of Rigved Mandal 10. Hindu scholars gave more importance to the Purusha Sukta and rejected the 72<sup>nd</sup> Sukta. Both these Suktas of the same Rig Veda are contradictory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>So who really created the universe?</strong></p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.90.6 When <strong>Gods</strong> prepared the sacrifice with Purusa as their offering, Its oil was spring, the holy gift was autumn; summer was the wood.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="494" height="90" class="wp-image-7276" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201-7.png" alt="https://truthabouthinduism.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/081514_0918_vediccontra8.png?w=625" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201-7.png 494w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/07/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201-7-300x55.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 494px) 100vw, 494px" /></p>
<p>Vedas doesn’t give the list of gods who sacrificed Purusha. But it’s mentioned in Atharva Veda 13.1.55 that Rohita brought the world which rose from the sacrifice (of Purusha). It either means that Rohita alone sacrificed Purusha or Rohita was among the gods or Rishis who sacrificed Purusha. Rohita is considered a sage in that verse. It’s mentioned in Rigved,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.129.6-7 Who verily knows and who can here declare it, whence it was born and whence comes this creation? The Gods are later than this world’s production. Who knows then whence it first came into being? He, the first origin of this creation, whether he formed it all or did not form it, Whose eye controls this world in highest heaven, <strong>he verily knows it, or perhaps he knows not</strong>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Swami Vivekananda’s English translation,</p>
<p>”[6] Who knew the way? Who there declared Whence this arose? Projection whence? <strong>For after this projection came the gods</strong>. Who therefore knew indeed, came out this whence?</p>
[7] This projection whence arose, Whether held or whether not, He the ruler in the supreme sky, of this He, O Sharman! knows, or know not He perchance”- Rig Veda 10.129.6-7, Tr. Swami Vivekananda. [Source: <a href="http://www.swamivivekananda.org.in/main/e-library/hymns/the-hymn-on-creation/" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">http://www.swamivivekananda.org.in/main/e-library/hymns/the-hymn-on-creation/<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> ]
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When Gods are later than this world’s production then who sacrificed Purusha? As we read in Purusha Sukta that it were the Gods who sacrificed Purusha. According to Vedas It was only after the sacrifice of Purusha that entire universe including this world came into existence. Manu also alludes that the Rishis were born after the creation of universe (Manu 1.34-35). So how is it possible that this creation took place without the gods? And who really sacrificed Purusha then?</p>
<p>When the Vedas which was believed by every Hindu god as highest authoritative text doesn’t have the answer about who really created the universe, then why do you believe it to be the word of god? Some may try to twist and turn these verses to hide the fallacies of Vedas, but truth will remain truth. They may deceive themselves but intellectuals will definitely find the truth. It is clear that the composer or God of Vedas is not the creator. Vedas juggles about the creator, but it’s not difficult to find the real creator of this world.</p>
