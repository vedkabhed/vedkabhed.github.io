<p>Written by Sulaiman Razvi</p>
<p>Meat especially that of cow is the centre of controversy in India. People are lynched and raped on rumours of beef consumption but such mentality didn&#8217;t exist in Vedic period, people in the Vedic period relished beef and meat of other animals. There are clear references in Vedas about meat consumption, but some Hindu scholars don&#8217;t translate it literally despite the fact that it is supported by other Hindu texts. Vedas no-where says that &#8216;You shouldn&#8217;t have meat&#8217;, Hindu scriptures doesn&#8217;t prohibit meat consumption, it&#8217;s only Hindu scholars that prohibits it. In the Vedas the cattle were gifted to other Deities, because it was a source of money during the Vedic period. A historian William Butler writes,</p>
<p>&#8220;The people among whom the Veda were composed, as here introduced to us, had evidently passed the nomadic stage. Their wealth consisted of Horses, Cattle, Sheep, Goats and Buffaloes. Coined money, and indeed money in any shape, was unknown. We meet but two allusions to gold, except for the purpose of ornaments. The cow was to the Vedic Hindu at once food and money.&#8221;<br />

<p>A recent survey found that 70% Indians are non-vegetarians. <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.in/2016/06/18/over-70-indians-are-meat-eaters-but-indian-tv-continues-to-vil/" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">http://www.huffingtonpost.in/2016/06/18/over-70-indians-are-meat-eaters-but-indian-tv-continues-to-vil/<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>While according to BBC report, just 20% of Indians are vegetarians,<br />
&#8220;But new research by US-based anthropologist Balmurli Natrajan and India-based economist Suraj Jacob, points to a heap of evidence that even these are inflated estimations because of &#8220;cultural and political pressures&#8221;. So people under-report eating meat &#8211; particularly beef &#8211; and over-report eating vegetarian food.<br />
Taking all this into account, say the researchers, only about 20% of Indians are actually vegetarian &#8211; much lower than common claims and stereotypes suggest.<br />
Hindus, who make up 80% of the Indian population, are major meat-eaters. Even only a third of the privileged, upper-caste Indians are vegetarian.&#8221;<br />

<p>As per National Family Health Survey (NHFS-5) 2019-21, 52.5% Hindu men and 40.7% Hindu women are non vegetarians.<br />

<p>India is also the world&#8217;s largest exporter of beef.<br />
<a href="http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-on-top-in-exporting-beef/article7519487.ece" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-on-top-in-exporting-beef/article7519487.ece<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>Despite these facts Hindus views non-vegetarians especially Muslims as demons equivalent to cannibals. Hindu apologists says that veg diet is healthy and non-veg diet is unhealthy but they aren&#8217;t aware of the fact that veg diet doesn&#8217;t provide required amount of nutrients and there are several risks associated with veg diet, vegetarians suffer from B12 deficiency. Vitamin B12 is found in non-veg food and egg is a key source of vitamin B12. You may like to go through the following links,</p>

<p><strong>Hindu Scholars on Meat Consumption</strong></p>
<p>Swami Vivekananda writes that Aryans used to relish beef,</p>
<p>&#8220;There was a time in this very India when, without eating beef, no Brahmin could remain a Brahmin&#8221; The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda, Volume 3 <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Complete_Works_of_Swami_Vivekananda/Volume_3/Lectures_from_Colombo_to_Almora/Reply_to_the_Address_of_Welcome_at_Madura" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Complete_Works_of_Swami_Vivekananda/Volume_3/Lectures_from_Colombo_to_Almora/Reply_to_the_Address_of_Welcome_at_Madura<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>Adishankaracharya writes,</p>
<p>&#8220;Odan&#8217; (rice) mixed with meat is called &#8216;Mansodan&#8217;. On being asked whose meat it should be, he answers &#8216;Uksha&#8217;. &#8216;Uksha&#8217; is used for an ox, which is capable to produce semen. Or the meat should be of a &#8216;Rishabh&#8217;. &#8216;Rishabh&#8217; is a bull more advanced in years than an &#8216;Uksha&#8217;.&#8221; <strong>Adishankaracharya in his commentary on Brihadaranyak Upanishad 6/4/18</strong></p>
<p>Ramanujacharya writes,</p>
<p>&#8220;In the Agnisomiya sacrifice no real harm is caused to the animal victim; for according to the Vedic Texts, the victim —a goat, after abandoning an inferior body, will attain a higher rebirth, with a beautiful body. The Text pertaining to immolation declares: — &#8216;O animal, by this (immolation) you never die, you are not destroyed. You will pass through happy paths to the realm of the gods, where the virtuous, not the sinful reach. May the god Savitar give you a suitable place.&#8217; (Yajñ, 4.6.9.46; Taitt. Br. iii 7.2).<br />
Likewise the attainment of more beautiful bodies by those who die here in this war [which is like a sacrifice] has been declared in the Gita (2.22). Hence, just as a surgeon makes an incision and performs other surgical procedures for the purpose of curing a patient, the immolation of the sacrificial animal in the Agnisomiya and other sacrifices contributes to its welfare.&#8221; <strong>Ramanujaacharya in his commentary on Bhagavad Gita 2.32</strong></p>
<p>If you ask Hindus as to why we shouldn&#8217;t have meat, they give irrational answer, they say &#8216;We should not slaughter animals because animals feel pain&#8217;. This answer is not convincing and is only a shift of logic. Before it was discovered that even Plants have life they used to say &#8216;We should not slaughter animals because they have life&#8217; and now they started this &#8216;Animals feel pain&#8221; issue. Here are some excerpts from Hindu texts which shows how the logic was changed,</p>
<p>Mahabharat Book 13, Section 115 &#8220;… Thou hast said so while discoursing formerly upon the ordinances in respect of Sraddhas. How can meat, however, be procured without slaying a living creature…&#8221; Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Mahabharata Book 13, Section 116 &#8220;…Flesh cannot be had from grass or wood or stone. Unless a living creature is slain, it cannot be had. Hence is the fault in eating flesh&#8230;&#8221; Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Founder of Arya Samaj Swami Dayanand Saraswati writes in his book,</p>
<p>&#8220;It is childish to say that there is no sin in eating meat…for meat cannot be had without killing animals, and it can never be right to hurt or kill animals without an offence.- Satyarth Prakash, Swami Dayanand Saraswati, p.342, Tr. Chiranjiva Bhardwaj.</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 5.48. Meat can never be obtained without injury to living creatures, and injury to sentient beings is detrimental to (the attainment of) heavenly bliss; let him therefore shun (the use of) meat.</p>
<p>These passages doesn&#8217;t say that we shouldn&#8217;t have meat because they feel pain but it says that we should not slaughter animals because they have life, they are living creatures. However these passages shouldn&#8217;t be taken as prohibition for meat consumption because Vedic deities used to consume beef every day, but meat consumption appears occasionally, i.e., for sacrifices in later texts. Manu Smriti 5.48 is explained in Vasistha Dharma Shastra 4.5-8 and Mahabharata 13.116 permits meat consumption on the condition that it is first offered to the gods and Pitrs (ancestors). I have explained those verses from Manu Smriti in this article. Researchers have found that even plants feel pain,</p>
<p>Researchers Have Found That Plants Know They Are Being Eaten<br />

<a href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/education/story/jagadish-chandra-bose-proved-plants-have-life/1/664259.html" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">http://indiatoday.intoday.in/education/story/jagadish-chandra-bose-proved-plants-have-life/1/664259.html<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>Doctors say that meat of fish, chicken and egg are very good for health then why should anyone abstain from it? Although it&#8217;s proved that even plants have life and feels pain but if vegan Hindus don&#8217;t eat meat merely because animals feel pain then will they eat egg? Egg doesn&#8217;t feel pain when you make omelette from it or boil it, so will Brahmins eat egg if the issue is all about pain? If the issue is about pain then will they be okay with slaughtering animals after proper anaesthesia is administered?</p>

<h3><a id="post-6065-Buddhism-Jainism"></a>Influence of Buddhism and Jainism on Hinduism</h3>
<p>Hundreds and thousands of animals were slaughtered as per Hindu texts. But animal slaughter became a taboo in Hindu society only after Hinduism was influenced by other religions like Buddhism and Jainism.</p>
<p>Swami Prabhupada the founder of ISKCON writes in the commentary of Bhagwad Purana 1.3.24,</p>
<p>&#8220;…Lord Buddha superficially denied the authority of the Vedas. This rejection of the Vedas by Lord Buddha was adopted in order to save people from the vice of animal-killing as well as to save the poor animals from the slaughtering process of their big brothers who clamor for universal brotherhood, peace, justice and equity. There is no justice when there is animal-killing. Lord Buddha wanted to stop it completely, and therefore his cult of ahimsa was propagated not only in India but also outside the country…&#8221; <strong>Swami Prabhupada on Bhagwad Purana 1.3.24</strong> [ <a href="http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_1.3.24" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_1.3.24<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> ]
<p>So Buddha rejected the authority of Vedas because Vedas sanctions animal slaughter and Hindus of his time sacrificed animals and he wanted them to stop this Vedic practice. Swami Vivekananda is of the same view. He writes,</p>
<p>&#8220;In what way do you see this importance of Buddhism in India today?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;It is obvious and overwhelming. You see India never loses anything; only she takes time to turn everything into bone and muscle. Buddha dealt a blow at animal sacrifice from which India has never recovered; and Buddha said, &#8216;Kill no cows&#8217;, and cow-killing is an impossibility with us.&#8221; <strong>The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda, Volume 5</strong><br />
<a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Complete_Works_of_Swami_Vivekananda/Volume_5/Interviews/Reawakening_Of_Hinduism_On_A_National_Basis" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Complete_Works_of_Swami_Vivekananda/Volume_5/Interviews/Reawakening_Of_Hinduism_On_A_National_Basis<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>Some scholars also say that people during Buddha&#8217;s time misinterpreted Vedas and started slaughtering animals in Vedic Yajnas, so to stop animal slaughter Buddha completely rejected the Vedas and established anti-Vedic philosophy called Buddhism. My question is, if Vedas do not sanction animal slaughter and people only misinterpreted the Vedas then why didn&#8217;t Buddha the avatar of Vishnu (as per Hinduism) revive the Vedas? Why wasn&#8217;t he born as a revivalist who should&#8217;ve correctly interpreted the meaning of the Vedas?</p>
<p>Following verses from Skanda Purana shows that animal slaughter was prevalent in 10<sup>th</sup> century during the reign of Kumarapala,</p>
<p>Skanda Purana III.ii.36.62 &#8220;[Kumarapala said] O Brahmanas, I shall not abide and honour the Royal Charter issued by Rama. I disown the Brahmanas who indulge in violence and kill animals in Yajna. There is no question of my having any respect for and devotion to these killers.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Kumarapala was a 10th century A.D king who had embraced Jainism, This shows that Brahmins were engaged in slaughtering animals in 10th century also. There is a story of another king named Vena who had also embraced Jainism and stopped animal slaughter in Vedic Yajnas,</p>
<p>Padma Purana II.37.32b-42 &#8220;[The sinful one said] I shall tell you another fierce act (mentioned) in the Vedas. When a guest goes (ie. arrives) to the house, a brahmana (kills and) cooks (the flesh of) a goat. (They kill) a horse in a horse- sacrifice, and a bull in a bull sacrifice; a man in human sacrifice and goats in a Vajapeya sacrifice. O great king, a great slaughter of many animals is done at a Rajasuya sacrifice. At a Pundarika sacrifice one would kill (i.e. one kills) an elephant, and at an elephant sacrifice (they kill) an elephant. At the Sautramani sacrifice a beast is seen to be fit for being sacrificed. Thus, O prince, listen how at rites of various forms of killing of beasts of various species is laid down…&#8221; Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p>Buddhism and Jainism were wiped out from India by Hindu kings and scholars probably because of their dominance and confrontation with Hinduism. Animal slaughter in Vedic sacrifices and rituals was often the main topic of debate between Buddhist/Jain and Brahmins where Buddhist/Jains had some valid points against Brahmin beliefs. Vishnu Purana says that demons after embracing Buddhism and Jainism started criticizing animal slaughter sanctioned by the Vedas, One of the main point raised by Buddhist/Jain converts was,</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 3.18.21-30 “The delusions of the false teacher paused not with the conversion of the Daityas to the Jaina and Bauddha heresies, but with various erroneous tenets he prevailed upon others to apostatize, until the whole were led astray, and deserted the doctrines and observances inculcated by the three Vedas. Some then spake evil of the sacred books; some blasphemed the gods; some treated sacrifices and other devotional ceremonies with scorn; and others calumniated the Brahmans. &#8220;The precepts,&#8221; they cried, &#8220;that lead to the injury of animal life (as in sacrifices) are highly reprehensible. To say that casting butter into flame is productive of reward, is mere childishness. If Indra, after having obtained godhead by multiplied rites, is fed upon the wood used as fuel in holy fire, he is lower than a brute, which feeds at least upon leaves. If an animal slaughtered in religious worship is thereby raised to heaven, would it not be expedient for a man who institutes a sacrifice to kill his own father for a victim? If that which is eaten by one at a Śráddha gives satisfaction to another, it must be unnecessary for one who resides at a distance to bring food for presentation in person.&#8221; Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Swami Dayanand Saraswati also writes about this,</p>
<p>&#8220;Eleven arguments in favored by the Charvaka Faith</p>
<p>3.&#8221;If the animal offered as sacrifice goes to heaven, why does not the Yajmana (master of ceremonies) send his parents, etc., to heaven, by killing them by way of sacrifice.&#8221; <strong>Satyarth Prakash, Ch 11, page 508, by Swami Dayanand Saraswati, Tr. Chiranjiva Bhardwaja</strong></p>
<p>Dayanand replies to this argument in the following way,</p>
<p>&#8220;3, 4, 5. The Veda and other Shaastras do not at all sanction animal sacrifice; the practice of offering oblations to the manes of departed ancestors is an invention of priests, because it is opposed to the Vedic and Shaastric teachings and finds sanction only in the Puraana like the Bhagvat. We have, therefore, nothing to say against the refutation of this doctrine.&#8221; <strong>Satyarth Prakash, Ch 11, page 509, by Swami Dayanand Saraswati, Tr. Chiranjiva Bhardwaja</strong></p>
<p>Swami Dayanand Saraswati cleverly tries to get rid of it by saying there is no sanction in Vedas. It&#8217;s true that Shraddha to Pitrs (ancestors) is not mentioned in Vedas but oblation to departed ancestors is mentioned in Shastras and animal slaughter is mentioned in Vedas and supported by other texts like Brahmanas, Puranas so there is no way out but to accept that Vedas permits animal slaughter. All these verses shows that Hindus used to slaughter animals till Buddhism and Jainism became prevalent and also shows that Hinduism was later influenced by these religions and adopted vegetarianism and later on animal slaughter was considered sinful in Hindu society.</p>

<p>मेष [Mesha] = Ram/Sheep.</p>
<p>पचत [Pachat] = Cooked</p>
<p>Above is Shri Ram Sharma&#8217;s Hindi translation.</p>
<p>Apologist present some verses which according to them prohibits meat consumption but those verses are quoted out of context, those verses have historical context, for instance it&#8217;s mentioned in the Vedas</p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.87.16 The <strong>fiend</strong> [non Aryan, Dasyu, Rakshas, Mleccha] who smears himself with flesh of cattle, with flesh of horses and of human bodies, Who steals the milch-cow&#8217;s milk away, O Agni,-tear off the heads of such with fiery fury.</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 1.16.4 If thou [Foreigners] destroy a cow of ours, a human being, or a steed, We pierce thee with this piece of lead so that thou mayst not slay our men.</p>
<p>These verses refer to the foreigners/Non Aryans [Maleccha, Rakshasa] or enemies of deities of Vedic period, that they should not kill the Aryans, cows or horses OF THE Aryans as Cows and Horses were sources of wealth and horses were also used for warfare, you can have meat of other castes or of foreigners (non Aryans). Who would like their wealth to be destroyed? Just like stealing milk of cow is wrong similarly killing animals belonging to other people is considered sinful in those verses. The verse Rig Veda 10.87.16 also prohibits stealing milk but it doesn&#8217;t mean that you shouldn&#8217;t consume milk, you can have milk after buying it similarly you can have meat after buying meat or animal. There may be some confusion among Hindus whether to eat cow or not but there is hardly any prohibition in Vedas to slaughter bull although Vedas do not prohibit any kind of meat.</p>
<p>Some Hindus might say those verses I mentioned above has historical context but they shouldn&#8217;t be viewed in a context as all verses are eternal and it&#8217;s applicable for all ages. Does that mean you should eat dog&#8217;s intestines when you are in deep distress? Because the Vedas says,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 4.18.13 In deep distress I cooked a dog&#8217;s intestines. Among the Gods I found not one to comfort. My consort I beheld in degradation. The Falcon then brought me the pleasant Soma.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="473" height="105" class="wp-image-6075" src="http://vedkabhed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/http-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-2016-8.png" alt="http://truthabouthinduism.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/112016_1617_meat9.png" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/http-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-2016-8.png 473w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/07/http-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-2016-8-300x67.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 473px) 100vw, 473px" /></p>
<p>This verse has a historical context which I am not going to explain, does that mean you should eat dog&#8217;s intestines when you are anxious?</p>
<p>The reason why it&#8217;s difficult to find verses on meat consumption in the Vedas (from few Hindu translators) is because some Hindu scholars don&#8217;t view the animal sacrifice as literal slaughtering but they view it as charity or symbolic slaughtering. So Hindus should ask their scholars to literally translate the Sanskrit verses on meat consumption and I am sure all their doubts on meat eating will be cleared. Vedic verses clearly uses words like Mamsa (Meat), Pachat (Cook) etc., Which is pretty clear for meat consumption but some Hindu scholars likes to add their own words into it, they give their own meanings.</p>
<p>Some Hindu apologists might say Yajnas does not contain killing, Yajnas are non-violent etc.,  But they cannot deny the fact that the animals which were brought as oblation were thrown into the fire,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.91.14-15 He [Agni/Fire] <strong>in whom</strong> horses, bulls, oxen, and barren cows, and rams, when duly set apart, are <strong>offered up</strong>,- To Agni, Soma-sprinkled, drinker of sweet juice, Disposer, with my heart I bring a fair hymn forth. Into thy [Agni&#8217;s] mouth is poured <strong>the offering</strong>, Agni, as Soma into cup, oil into ladle…</p>

<p>Manu Smriti 3.76 An oblation duly thrown into the fire, reaches the sun; from the sun comes rain, from rain food, therefrom the living creatures (derive their subsistence).</p>
<p>Rig Veda 3.59.5 The great Aditya, to be served with worship, who stirreth men, is gracious to the singer. To Mitra, him most highly to be lauded, offer in fire [the] oblation that he loveth.</p>

<p>Satapatha Brahmana 6.2.1.14 Now when he slaughters those animals, he prepares a home for Agni; for nowhere but in his home does one enjoy himself. But the home means food: it is that he lays down in, front, and when Agni sees that, he turns unto him.</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana 11:7:1:1- He performs the animal sacrifice. Now the animal sacrifice means cattle: thus, when he performs the animal sacrifice (pasubandha, the binding of the animal), it is in order that he may be possessed of cattle…And when he performs the animal sacrifice, he renews his fires, and so, along with the renewal of his fires, does the Sacrificer (renew himself), and along with the Sacrificer his house and cattle. And beneficial to life, indeed, is that redemption of his own self; for whilst he is offering the Sacrificer&#8217;s fires long for flesh; they set their minds on the Sacrificer and harbour designs on him. In other fires people do indeed cook any kind of meat, but these (sacrificial fires) have no desire for any other flesh but this (sacrificial animal), and for him to whom they belong.</p>
<p>Asvalayana Grihya Sutra, IV Adhyaya, 8 Kandika, 25 &#8220;The husks and chaff (of the rice), the tail, the skin, the head, the feet (of the sacrificial animal) he should throw into the fire.</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 20.79 O Agni [Fire], within thy mouth is poured the offering, as Soma into cup, ghee into ladle…</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="477" height="105" class="wp-image-6078" src="http://vedkabhed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/http-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-2016-11.png" alt="http://truthabouthinduism.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/112016_1617_meat12.png" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/http-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-2016-11.png 477w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/07/http-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-2016-11-300x66.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 477px) 100vw, 477px" /></p>
<p>Read Rig Veda 1.162.19 which I have mentioned above which talks about meat balls of horse put into the fire, We can obtain meat balls only after killing the horse, So it is a undeniable fact that animals were killed in the Yajna.  As I said earlier Hindu scholars don&#8217;t view the sacrifice as literal for instance Veda says</p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.104.3 To make thee [Indra] start, a strong true draught I offer to thee, the Bull [as a oblation], O thou whom Bay Steeds carry.</p>
<p>Rig Veda 5.29.8 When thou [Indra] three hundred buffaloes&#8217; flesh hadst eaten, and drunk, as Maghavan, three lakes of Soma, All the Gods raised as &#8217;twere a shout of triumph to Indra praise because he slew the Dragon.</p>
<p>I have given the Hindi translation of Rig Veda 5.29.8 by Pundit Ram Govind Trivedi. Some scholars have skipped the Sanskirt word Maas (Meat/Flesh) in their translation, A Hindu scholar Ram Acharya has translated the verse 5.29.8 as Indra &#8221;ACCEPTED&#8221; the three hundred buffaloes instead of &#8220;Eaten&#8221; he has also omitted the word Maas (Flesh/Meat), even if he just accepted the buffaloes then it means later he ate them because Veda commands Indra and Agni to eat the oblation which they receive,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.116.8 Eat, Indra, <strong>these oblations which approach thee</strong>: be pleased with food made ready and with Soma.</p>

<p>Rig Veda 2.1.13-14 The A&#8217;dityas have made thee, Agni, their mouth; the pure (deities) have made thee, Kavi, their tongue: the (gods), the givers of wealth, depend upon thee at sacrifices; they eat the offered oblation through thee [Agni]. All the benignant immortal gods eat the offered oblation through thee, as their mouth: mortals taste the flavour (of all viands) through thee: thou art born pure, the embryo of plants.</p>

<p>Indra, Agni and other gods were commanded to eat the offered oblations, therefore they did consume meat. In Vedas, there are two more verses about bulls brought for sacrifice,</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 9.4.9 …that Brahman gives a thousand who offers up the Bull as his oblation.</p>

<p>We have already read that the cattle which were brought as oblation/offerings were put in the fire and later on eaten, so it is a pretty much clear that Hindu deities used to partake beef.</p>
<p>Hindu extremists make so much hue and cry over cow slaughter today but cow slaughter was a common practice in Vedic period,</p>
<p>Krishna Yajur Veda 2.5.5.3-4 On the full moon (the Soma) is pressed for the gods; during this half-month it is pressed forth for them, and a cow for Mitra and Varuna is to be slaughtered for them at the new moon. In that he sacrifices on the day before…In that he sacrifices at the new moon with clotted curds for Mitra and Varuna, the cow which is slaughtered for the gods becomes his also.</p>
<p>Krishna Yajur Veda 2.2.9.6 At the time of the (offering of the) cow, he should offer on one potsherd to Mitra and Varuna, this (offering) corresponds to his foe&#8217;s cow which is to be slaughtered</p>
<p>Krishna Yajur Veda 5.1.8 …if he were to let them go after circumambulation with fire, he would disturb the sacrifice; if he were to keep them until the conclusion, the heads would be exhausted; in that he offers the animals, he wins thereby animals; in that he lets them go after circumambulation with fire, (it serves) to prevent the exhaustion of the heads; he concludes (the rite) with (an animal) for Prajapati; Prajapati is the sacrifice; verily he concludes the sacrifice in the sacrifice…</p>

<h3><a id="post-6065-Ashvamedha-Yajna"></a>Ashvamedha Yajna</h3>
<p>Veda clearly speaks of animal killing and putting it in the Agni (Fire) during Yajna, one of the most popular hymn about animal slaughter is from the Rig Veda about Horse sacrifice (Ashvamedha Yajna). Ashvamedha mentioned in Rig Veda deals with slaughtering and cooking of the sacrificial horse. I am using English translation of H.H Wilson and Hindi translation of Pundit Ram Govind Trivedi,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.162.9 “Whatever the flies may eat of the raw flesh of the horse; whatever (grease) is smeared upon the brush or upon the axe ; (what is smeared) upon the hands or the nails of the immolator, may all this be with thee, (horse), among the gods.” Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s see what other scriptures says about Horse Sacrifice</p>
<p>Krishna Yajur Veda 5.4.12.1 It is the twenty onefold day, <strong>on which the horse is slain</strong>, there are twelve months, five seasons; these worlds are three</p>
<p>Krishna Yajur Veda 5.3.12. The eye of Prajapati swelled, that fell away, that became a horse; because it swelled (áçvayat), that is the reason why the horse (áçva) has its name. By the horse sacrifice the gods replaced it. He who sacrifices with the horse sacrifice makes Prajapati whole; verily he becomes whole; this is the atonement for everything, and the cure for everything. All evil by it the gods overcame; by it also the gods overcame (the sins of) Brahman- slaying; all evil [1] he overcomes, he overcomes Brahman-slaying who sacrifices with the horse sacrifice, and he who knows it thus. It was the left eye of Prajapati that swelled; therefore they cut off from the horse on the left side, on the right from other animals. The mat is of reeds; the horse has its birthplace in the waters, the reed is born in the waters; verily he establishes it in its own birthplace. The Stoma is the fourfold one; the bee tore the thigh of the horse, the gods made it whole with the fourfold Stoma; in that there is the fourfold Stoma, (it is) to make whole the horse.</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagawatam (Bhagvad Purana) 4.19.11 “When Pṛthu Mahārāja was performing the last horse sacrifice [aśvamedha-yajña], King Indra, invisible to everyone, stole the horse intended for sacrifice. He did this because of his great envy of King Pṛthu.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Commentary: &#8220;King Indra is known as śata-kratu, which indicates that he has performed one hundred horse sacrifices (aśvamedha-yajña). We should know, however, that the animals sacrificed in the yajña were not killed. If the Vedic mantras were properly pronounced during the sacrifice, the animal sacrificed would come out again with a new life.&#8221; <strong>Swami Prabhupada on Srimad Bhagavatam 4.19.11</strong></p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana 11.2.5.1. And, verily, even on this occasion, they slaughter the sacrificial horse (Asvamedha) as a sacrifice to the gods…</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana 13:2:1:1-2 Pragâpati assigned the sacrifices to the gods; the Asvamedha he kept for himself. The gods said to him, &#8216;Surely, this–to wit, the Asvamedha–is a sacrifice: let us have a share in that also.&#8217; He contrived these Anna-homas (food-oblations) for them: thus when he performs the Annahomas, it is the gods he thereby gratifies. With ghee he makes offering, for ghee is fiery mettle: by means of fiery mettle he thus lays fiery mettle into him (the horse and Sacrificer). With ghee he offers; for that–to wit, ghee–is the gods&#8217; favourite resource: it is thus with their favourite resource he supplies them.</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana 11:2:5:5 Verily, then, for him who, knowing this, offers both the Agnihotra and the Full and New-moon sacrifices, they slaughter the sacrificial horse month by month; and month by month the Asvamedha is offered for him, and his Agnihotra and Full and New-moon sacrifices come to pass into the Asvamedha.</p>
<p>Valmiki Ramayan Bala Kanda 1, Sarga 14, Verses 33-38 “With great delight coming on her Queen Kausalya reverently made circumambulations to the horse, and symbolically killed the horse with three knives. Queen Kausalya desiring the results of ritual disconcertedly resided one night with that horse that flew away like a bird…Then the priest, one with controlled senses and rich in scriptural wealth, took up the omentum [fat] of the horse and cooked it as per scriptures while dropping into the altar of fire to bake as a food to the celestials…Those remaining body parts that horse are there, the sixteen officiating priests have procedurally oblated all of them into fire.” Tr. Desiraju Hanumanta Rao</p>
<p>Brahma Purana 104.137 &#8220;After performing these tasks Rama the most excellent among the virtuous performed ten horse-sacrifices where flesh was offered to the deities.&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Swami Vivekananda and Swami Dayanand Saraswati said that whatever from the Puranas (or other text also) contradicts the Vedas then it must be rejected without any mercy. And verses from Shatapatha Brahmana and Puranas confirms that the horse was slaughtered in Ashvamedha Yajna. So there is no way that apologists can now twist verses from Vedas about Horse-sacrifice.</p>

<h3><a id="post-6065-Cows-Guests"></a>Killing cows and offering its meat to guests</h3>
<p>Cattle were slaughtered for guests. But as per Swami Vivekananda this practise was later stopped. Sometimes we may wonder how an animal like cow became so sacred that Hindus started worshiping it and also prohibited its slaughter. When you ask any Hindu why he considers the Cow to be his Mother, he will tell you that &#8216;Since cow gives us milk, we consider it to be our mother&#8217;.</p>
<p>In the Vedas even the earth is considered a Mother. The reason for this may be because food grows from the soil. So Hindus considers all such things to be their mother whichever provides them with food. As we have already read some references about cattle used as source of money and ploughing the fields. It could be that people in ancient India heavily relied on Agriculture. Many farmers in India still plough fields with the help of Bulls and Cows. So killing cattle would result in heavy loss for such people, thus the prohibition of killing cows may have enacted. Swami Vivekananda writes,</p>
<p>&#8220;you read in the Vedas how, when a Sannyasin, a king, or a great man came into a house, the best bullock was killed. How in time it was found that as we were an agricultural race, killing the best bulls meant annihilation of the race. Therefore the practice was stopped, and a voice was raised against the killing of cows. Sometimes we find existing then what we now consider the most horrible customs.&#8221; <strong>The Complete Works of Swami Vivekandan, Volume 3</strong><br />

<p>Hindu scriptures commands to slaughter cattle or goat for the guests,</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti 51.64 When honoring a guest, at a sacrifice, or when worshipping the manes, or the gods, a man may slay cattle, but not otherwise on any account.</p>
<p>Sankhayana Grihya Sutra 2.15.1-3 Should any one of the six persons (mentioned in the Srauta-sutra and in the Sutras 4-9) to whom the Arghya reception is due, visit (him), let him make (ready) a cow, a goat, or what (sort of food) he thinks most like (thereto). Let the Argha not be without flesh. On the occasion of a sacrifice and of a wedding let (the guest) say, &#8216;Make it (ready).&#8217;</p>
<p>Kausitaki Brahmana 1.15 …Just as in the world when a human king has come, or another deserving person, they slay an ox or a cow that miscarries; so for him they slay in that they kindle the fire, for Agni is the victim of the gods.</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana 3:4:1:2. Now as to why it is called &#8216;guest-offering.&#8217; He, the purchased Soma, truly comes as his (the sacrificer&#8217;s) guest,–to him (is offered) that (hospitable reception): even as for a king or a Brâhman one would cook a large ox or a large he-goat–for that is human (fare offered to a guest), and the oblation is that of the gods–so he prepares for him that guest-offering.</p>
<p>Asvalayana Grihya Sutra 1.24.33 Let the Madhuparka not be without flesh, without flesh.</p>
<p>Madhuparka means offerings to the guest. Krishna tells Yuddhisthira,</p>
<p>Mahabharata Book 14, Section 2 “…And then Kesava (Krishna) accosted him,&#8211;&#8216;If a person indulges excessively in sorrow for his departed forefathers, he grieves them. (Therefore, banishing grief), do thou (now) celebrate many a sacrifice with suitable presents to the priests; and do thou gratify the gods with Soma liquor, and the manes of thy forefathers with their due food and drink. Do thou also gratify thy guests with meat and drink and the destitute with gifts commensurate with their desires…” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>On the occasion of Rukmini&#8217;s marriage with Krishna, Rukmi tells his father to slaughter a lakh cows, two lakh deers, 4 lakhs of rabbits and tortoise, ten lakhs of goats and 40 lakhs of sheep,</p>
<p>Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Krishna Janma Khanda 105. 47-67 &#8220;Get also slaughtered a lakh of cows, two lakhs of deer, 4 lakhs of rabbits and tortoise. Reverentially sacrifice to the village goddess on the night of the ful moon ten lakhs of goats and sheep four times the number of the last named and get the flesh properly cooked for food. O lord of the world, get also vegetables cooked for the purpose. The monarch Bhismaka having heard the words of his son took his family priest aside and also sent a suitable Brahmin to Dwarka. He fixed a date which was regarded auspicious unanimously&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Rajendra Nath Sen</p>
<p>Cow is also called Aghnya, Yaska in Nirukta has given two definitions for this word, one is that cow is not to be killed and another one is that cow is called Aghnya because it is a destroyer of sins. Cow is destroyer of sin because sacrificing it emancipates ones sins,</p>
<p>Grihya Sutra of Hiranyakesin I Prasna, 4 Patala, 14 Section, verses 11-16 &#8220;That (cow is either killed or let loose. If he chooses to let it loose, (he murmurs), &#8216;This cow will become a milch cow&#8217;&#8230;If it shall be killed, (he says), &#8216;A cow art thou; sin is driven away from thee. Drive away my sin and the sin of N.N.! Kill ye him whoever hates me. He is killed whosoever hates me. Make (the cow) ready!&#8217; If (the cow) is let loose, a meal is prepared with other meat, and he announces it (to the guest) in the words, &#8216;It is ready!&#8217; He replies, &#8216;It is well prepared; it is Virag; it is food. May it not fail! May I obtain it&#8230;Give food to the Brahmanas!&#8217; After those (Brahmanas) have eaten, (the hose) orders blameless (?) food to be brought to him (i.e. to the guest).</p>
<p>Scholars have opined that milch cows were not slaughtered and only barren cows were slaughtered as slaughtering milch cows would result in heavy loss.</p>

<h3><a id="post-6065-Meat-Consumption"></a>Meat consumption in other Hindu scriptures</h3>
<p>Hindu text even permits the meat of cow,</p>
<p>Apastamba Dharma Shastra Prasna I, Patala 5, Khanda 17, 30-31 (But the meat) of milch-cows and oxen may be eaten. The Vâgasaneyaka declares &#8216;bull&#8217;s flesh is fit for offerings.&#8217; 37. Five-toed animals (ought not to be eaten) with the exception of the iguana, the tortoise, the porcupine, the hedgehog, the rhinoceros, the hare, and the Pûtikhasha.</p>
<p>Vasistha Dharma Shastra 14.46. It is declared in the Vâgasaneyaka, that (the flesh of) milch-cows and oxen is fit for offerings.</p>
<p>Hinduism also permits meat of the following animals, birds and fishes,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 5.18 The porcupine, the hedgehog, the iguana, the rhinoceros, the tortoise, and the hare they declare to be eatable; likewise those (domestic animals) that have teeth in one jaw only, excepting camels.</p>
<p>Padma Purana III.56.31b-46 &#8220;&#8230;O best ones, Prajapati Manu has said that these animals with five claws may be always eaten: alligator, tortoise, hare, rhinoceros, porcupine. He may also eat fish with scales, and the flesh of (the deer called) ruru after having presented them to deities and brahmanas, and not otherwise. O best brahmanas, so also (the flesh of) a peacock, a patridge, a pigeon, a cataka, rhinoceros, a crane, a swan. Thus said Prajapati (Manu). These fish, viz. (the glittering fish) saphari, simhatunda, pathina and rohita are directed as fit to be eaten. With a desire (to retain the status) as a twice-born he should eat the flesh of these after it is sprinkled over; even if he is about to loose his life he should duly use it. He should not at all eat flesh. He who eats what remains, is not smeared (with sin). If he is weak, he should eat flesh as medicine, or by an order or for sacrificial purposes. He, who would give up flesh when invited at a sraddha or a rite in honour of a deity, goes to (i.e. lives) in hell for as many years as the number of hair of the beast&#8230;&#8221; Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p>Agni Purana 168.12-23 &#8220;&#8230;Animals having five nails such as the Shallaki, the Godha, the rhinoceros, and the tortoise are clean animals; and accordingly their flesh may be taken without any impunity. Flesh of animals other than the five mentioned in the preceding line, should be deemed impure. There is no harm in eating such fishes as Pathin, Rohita, and Sinhatunda&#8230;&#8221; Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Yajnavalkya Smriti verse 177-8 Of the five toed animals, the porcupine the iguana-lizard, the tortoise, the hedge-hog; and the hare; among fishes the Simhatundaka and the Rohita. So also the pathina, the Rajiva, the sasalka may be eaten by the twice born classes.</p>
<p>Brahma Purana 113.111-2 &#8220;The following can be eaten: hare, tortoise, alligator, porcupine and the fish with darts (?) The village boar and the cock should be avoided. In the following circumstances, even if one eats meat, one is not defiled: if it is the remnant of offerings unto the Pitrs, Devas etc. or if it is cooked in Sraddha at the request of the brahmins and is sprinkled with the holy water or if it is taken as a medicine.&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Vamana Purana 15.2-3 &#8220;Rice cooked well with oil or ghee, even if it be stored for a long time is fit to be eaten. Rice without any oil or ghee, and delicate preparations of milk, meat of the rabbit, porcupine, alligator, hedgehog, fish and tortoise, pulses and similar other things are fit to be eaten, said Manu.&#8221; Tr. Ananda Swarup Gupta</p>

<p>Sankha Samhita 13.25 &#8220;A Sraddha ceremony performed by offering oblations of Vala Sakas, bird&#8217;s flesh, the flesh of a rhinoceros, or a large-scaled fish, bears infinite fruit. This is the opinion of Yama, the law-giver.&#8221; Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Sankha Samhita 17.22 &#8220;Golden coloured godhas, tortoises, porcupines, hares, although they belong to the group of five nailed creatures, are animals whose flesh may be eaten; but having killed of any of these animals, one should practise the above-said penance.&#8221; Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Sankha Samhita 17.27 &#8220;Pheasants, peacocks, Lavaakas, Kapinjaras, Vartakas, and Bardhrinasas are birds, whose flesh, according to holy Yama, may be always eaten.&#8221; Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Usana Samhita 3.107 &#8220;This Sraddha is called Pindanvaharyakam. In the afternoon of the day, when the waning of the Moon takes place, the twice-born should perform it with sanctified fish and meat.&#8221; Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Manu Smriti clearly allow consumption of meat,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 5.29  What is destitute of motion is the food of those endowed with locomotion; (animals)  without fangs (are the food) of those with fangs, those without hands of those who possess hands, and the timid of the bold.</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 5.30 The eater who daily even devours those destined to be his food, commits no sin; for the creator himself created both the eaters and those who are to be eaten (for those special purposes).</p>
<p>Above Manu Smriti verse might sound contradicting to other verse of Manu which says,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 5.41 On offering the honey-mixture (to a guest), at a sacrifice and at the rites in honour of the manes, but on these occasions <strong>only</strong>, may an animal be slain; that (rule) Manu proclaimed.</p>
<p>What some Hindu apologists do is they quote these two verse and says &#8220;See these two verses are contradicting each other, one says we can slaughter animals only on occasions but other says we can slaughter animals daily so this proves Manu Smriti is interpolated&#8221; It&#8217;s so easy to say fake translation and Manu Smriti is corrupted to escape the argument, But the next verse explains it,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 5.32 He who eats meat, <strong>when he honours the gods and manes</strong>, commits no sin, whether he has bought it, or himself has killed (the animal), or has received it as a present from others.</p>
<p>So the condition to eat the meat is, he should honor the god, if he doesn&#8217;t then it&#8217;s a minor offense.</p>
<p>Internet Arya Samajis considers Manu Smriti to be unauthentic. Manu Smriti is the second most authentic scripture of Arya Samaj, Vedas are the most sacred Sruti and the Manu Smriti is the most authentic Smriti, Swami Dayanand Saraswati the founder of Arya Samaj writes in his book,</p>
<p>Q. ~ Well sir! Have you no faith even in what the Parashar says:<br />
A. ~ …. <strong>Among the Smrities, the Manu Smriti alone is authentic.- Satyarth Prakash</strong> pg 142, Tr. Chiranjiva Bhardwaja</p>
<p>Dayanand recommended reading Manu Smriti to understand several things, Moreover he used approximately 250 verses of Manu Smriti in his book Satyarth Prakash, If Manu Smriti is so corrupted (corrupted according to some keyboard warriors) then why did Dayanand used 250 Shlokas of Manu Smriti in his book Satyarth Prakash? This proves Manu Smriti is the most authentic Smriti of Arya Samaj no matter today if some keyboard warriors reject it. In a debate between Dayanand and an Orthodox Hindu named Tara Charan, Dayanand accepted that Manu Smriti and few other texts are authoritative and they are based on the Vedas</p>
<p>Some Hindu apologists try to show there is no violence in Yajnas therefore killing animals during Yajna is prohibited, let me give an example to refute this point. Drinking alcohol is illegal in Saudi Arabia, if you trade or drink alcohol there you will be imprisoned, but in India drinking or trade of alcohol is legal and you won&#8217;t be imprisoned for it similarly killing animals in Yajnas is permissible and is a non-violent act.</p>

<h3><a id="post-6065-Sacrifice-Ritual"></a>Animal sacrifice for Vedic sacrifice and rituals</h3>
<p>Hinduism permits slaughtering the following animals for Vedic sacrifices and rituals,</p>
<p>Sankha Samhita 13.25 &#8220;A S&#8217;raddha ceremony performed by offering oblations of Vala Sakas, bird&#8217;s flesh, the flesh of a rhinoceros, or a large scaled fish, bears infinite fruit. This is the opinion of Yama, the law-giver.&#8221; Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana even say that meat is the best food,</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana 11.7.1.3. Now, when he performs the animal offering. He thereby redeems himself–male by male, for the victim is a male, and the Sacrificer is a male. And this, indeed, to wit, flesh, is the best kind of food: he thus becomes an eater of the best kind of food. Let not a year pass by for him without his offering; for the year means life: it is thus immortal life he thereby confers upon himself.</p>
<p>Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 6.4.18 And if a man wishes that a learned son should be born to him, famous, a public man, a popular speaker, that he should know all the Vedas, and that he should live to his full age, then, after having prepared boiled rice with meat and butter, they should both eat, being fit to have offspring. The meat should be of a young or of an old bull.</p>

mouth is the Ahavaniya-fire; and this is done to increase our bodily vigour, to gain the world of purity, and for the sake of immortality.</p>

Let him present to the manes balls of meat mixed with curds, barley, and jujubes, with the part of his hand sacred to the gods, or with that sacred to Prajápati.

They can be eaten after offering them to the deities and the Brahmanas and not otherwise. The Prajapati has said that the peacock, the francoline patridge, the Kapinjala (a variety of the ruddy goose), the rhenocero and the panther can be eaten. O leading sages, among fishes, these are mentioned as worthy of being eaten, viz: the Rajivas (lotus-like ones) the Simhatundas (lion-snouted), the Pathinas and the Rohitas. The flesh of these must be sprinkled with holy water and consecrated before eating if the Brahmanas so desires. One shall eat meat in accordance with the injunctions or as enjoined at a time when life is in danger.

But those who make the division otherwise are like scoundrels and miscreants who kill an animal merely (for gratifying their lust after flesh. This division of the sacrificial animal was invented by the Rishi Devabhaga, a son of Sruta. When he was departing from this life, he did not entrust (the secret to any one). But a supernatural being communicated it to Girija, the son of Babhru. Since his time men study it.&#8221; Tr. Martin Haug</p>

<h3><a id="post-6065-Shraddha-Pitrs"></a>Animal slaughter at Shraddha for Pitrs (ancestors)</h3>
<p>Mahabharata book 13 section 88 Manu has said that if a Sraddha is performed with a copious measure of sesame, such Sraddha becomes inexhaustible. Of all kinds of food, sesame seeds are regarded as the best. With fishes offered at Sraddhas, the Pitris remain gratified for a period of two months. With mutton they remain gratified for three months and with the flesh of the hare for four. With the flesh of the goat, O king, they remain gratified for five months, with bacon for six months, and with the flesh of birds for seven. With venison obtained from those deer that are called Prishata, they remain gratified for eight months, and with that obtained from the Ruru for nine months, and with the meat of the Gavaya for ten months. With the meat of the buffalo their gratification lasts for eleven months. With beef presented at the Sraddha, their gratification, it is said, lasts for a full year. Payasa mixed with ghee is as much acceptable to the Pitris as beef. With the meat of the Vadhrinasa the gratification of the Pitris lasts for twelve years. The flesh of the rhinoceros, offered to the Pitris on the anniversaries of the lunar days on which they died, becomes inexhaustible. The potherb called Kalasaka, the petals of the Kanchana flower, and meat of the goat also, thus offered, prove inexhaustible.</p>
<p>Apastamba Dharma Shastra, Prasna II, Patala 7, Khanda 16.3-4 At that (rite) the Manes (of one&#8217;s father, grandfather, and great-grand father) are the deities (to whom the sacrifice is offered). But the Brâhmanas, (who are fed,) represent the Âhavanîya-fire. That rite must be performed in each month [26] Beef satisfies (the Manes) for a year.</p>
<p>Apastamba Dharma Shastra, Prasna II, Patala 7, Khanda 17.1-3 (If) rhinoceros&#8217; meat (is given to Brahmanas seated) on (seats covered with) the skin of a rhinoceros, (the Manes are satisfied) for a very long time. (The same effect is obtained) by (offering the) flesh (of the fish called) Satabali, And by (offering the) meat of the (crane called)</p>
<p>Gautama Dharma Shastra 15.15. The Manes are satisfied for a month by gifts of sesamum, Masha-beans, rice, barley, and water, For (three) years by fish and the flesh of common deer, spotted deer, hares, turtles, <strong>boars</strong>, and sheep,For twelve years by cow&#8217;s milk and messes made of milk, For a very long time by the flesh of (the crane called) Vardhrinasa, by Ocyrnurn sanctum (sacred Basil), and by the flesh of goats, (especially) of a red (he-goat), and of a rhinoceros, (if these dishes are) mixed with honey.</p>
<p>Maharishi Manu writes,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 3.266-72 I will now fully declare what kind of sacrificial food, given to the manes according to the rule, will serve for a long time or for eternity. The ancestors of men are satisfied for one month with sesamum grains, rice, barley, masha beans, water, roots, and fruits, which have been given according to the prescribed rule, Two months with fish, three months with the meat of gazelles, four with mutton, and five indeed with the flesh of birds, Six months with the flesh of kids, seven with that of spotted deer, eight with that of the black antelope, but nine with that of the (deer called) Ruru, Ten months they are satisfied with the meat of boars and buffaloes, but eleven months indeed with that of hares and tortoises, One year with cow-milk and milk-rice; from the flesh of a long-eared white he-goat their satisfaction endures twelve years. The (vegetable called) Kalasaka, (the fish called) Mahasalka, the flesh of a rhinoceros and that of a red goat, and all kinds of food eaten by hermits in the forest serve for an endless time.</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 2.16.1-3 “AURVA continued.–&#8221;Ancestors are satisfied for a month with offerings of rice or other grain, with clarified butter, with fish, or the flesh of the hare, of birds, of the hog, the goat, the antelope, the deer, the gayal, or the sheep, or with the milk of the cow, and its products. They are for ever satisfied with flesh (in general), and with that of the long-eared white goat in particular. The flesh of the rhinoceros, the Kálaśáka potherb, and honey, are also especial sources of satisfaction to those worshipped at ancestral ceremonies.” Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Yajnavalkya Smriti verse 258-59 (The Pitris are satisfied) verily for a moth with the havisya (sacrificial food), but for a year with the milk rice, with the fish, with the meat of gazelles, with mutton, with the flesh of birds, with the flesh of kids, with flesh of spotted deer. With the flesh of black antelope, with that of Ruru deer, with the meat of boars, and with the meat of hares respectively for a period progessively increasing by a month are satisfied when offered to the Grandfathers here.</p>
<p>Markandeya Purana 32.2-5; Matsya Purana 17-31-36 The Pitris are satisfied with clarified butter and rice for a month. The paternal grandfathers receive satisfaction with fish meat for two months. Venison should be known to satisfy the pitris for three months; and the flesh of hares nourishes the pitris for four months; bird&#8217;s flesh satisfies them for five months; hog&#8217;s flesh for six months; goat&#8217;s flesh for seven months; and flesh of the black antelope for eight months; flesh of the ruru deer gives them satisfication for nine months, without doubt; flesh of gayal gives satisfaction for ten months.</p>
<p>Same is repeated in in Kurma Purana II.20.37-54 which also talks about giving meat to Brahmins as food. Narada Purana Uttarabhaga 44.51; Vayu Purana 21-2-9; Agni Purana 117.44-48; Padma Purana 1.9.153-157; Agni Purana 163.28-39; Brahma Purana 111.15-33; Brahmanda Purana 2.3.19.2-10 similar thing is also said in Garuda Purana I.99.37- 38; Matsya Purana 15.34-35; Matsya Purana 204.6-9; Narada Purana II.51.142b-145a; Padma Purana 1.9.62-63 including the following verses,</p>
<p>Markandeya Purana 35.2-4 &#8220;&#8230;The hare, the tortoise, the gosamp, the porcupine, and the rhinoceros, my son, these indeed may be eaten; and domestic pig and fowl should be eschewed. The remains of food at a sraddha after the pitris and gods and other recipients have been satisfied may be eaten at the desire of the brahmanas. A man who eats flesh that has been killed for the purpose of medicine is not defiled.&#8221;</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti 30.34 Now he who studies the hymns of the Rig-veda (regularly), feeds the manes with clarified butter. 37 He who studies the Atharva-veda, (feeds them) with meat.</p>
<p>Markandeya Purana 32.31-34 &#8220;At this ceremony also songs in honour of the pitris are sung by those who recite the Veda, songs which were formerly sung by the pitris to king Puruavas. &#8220;When will any one of use have a son, the chief among his race, who, eating the remains food left by yogis, will offer the pinda on earth? Or will offer pinda, buffalo-beef, the clarified butter, or the vegetable kala mixed with sesamum-seed, or khichree at Gaya for our monthly satisfaction? May we obtain the offering to the Visvadevas and the soma juice, buffalo-beef, and the finest clarified butter, and the divine food by getting a young rhinoceros!&#8221;</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti 80.1-14 Sesamum, rice, barley, beans, water, roots, fruits, vegetables, Syâmâka grain, millet, wild rice, kidney-beans, and wheat satisfy (the manes) for a month; The flesh of fishes (excepting those species that are forbidden), for two months; The flesh of the common deer, for three months; The flesh of sheep, for four months; The flesh of birds (of those kinds that may be eaten), for five months; The flesh of goats, for six months; The flesh of the spotted deer, for seven months; The flesh of the spotted antelope, for eight months; Beef, for nine months; Buffalo&#8217;s meat, for ten months; The meat of a hornless goat, for eleven months; The milk of a cow, or preparations from it, for a year. On this subject there exists a stanza, which the manes utter: &#8216;(The pot-herb) Kâlasâka (sacred basil), (the prawn) Mahâsalka, and the flesh of the (crane called) Vârdhrînasa[1], (and of) a rhinoceros having no horn, is food which we always accept.&#8217;</p>
<p>Agni Purana 117.44-48 &#8220;Now I shall discuss the nature of satisfaction which the different sorts of cakes or oblations respectively impart to the souls of one&#8217;s ancestors. Oblations composed of cereals grown in villages as well as forest fruits, bulbs and roots last one&#8217;s forefathers for a month, while those consisting of fishes and venison would serve them well for double or triple that division of time. The peculiar kind of venison known as the Rouravas would gratify them for five months, whereas games and wild fowls would last them for four months. The departed soul are supposed to live satisfactorily upon goat&#8217;s meat for six months, meat of tortoise, pork, mutton, and buffalo flesh lasting them for seven, eight, nine and ten months respectively. Sweetened porridge and butter of cow milk offered in a clarified state would gratify them for a whole year, while the meat of a full grown sacrificial goat (Vardrinasa) as well as the sword of a rhinoceros, flesh of an antelope or that of a red goat and honey should be considered as their full and proper ration for a period of three consecutive&#8217; months. Offerings made during the rainy season consist of fishes having large scales, while a Shraddha ceremony performed on the day on which the moon enters the asterisk Magha should be supposed as hearing immortal fruits.&#8221; Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Usana Samhita 3.137-141 &#8220;one should, with care, give at a Sraddha, deer, lamb and tortoise. With fish and meat, [the Manes attain to gratification for] two months; and [for] three months, with the meat of deer. With mutton, [they are gratified for] four months; with the meat of birds, [for] five months; with the meat of goat, [for] six months; and with the meat of Ruru deer, [for] nine months. With the meat of buffalo and pork, [they] are gratified for ten months; and with the meat of hare and tortoise, for eleven months. With cow&#8217;s milk and Payasa (milk and boiled-rice), [they attain to gratification for] one year. With the meat of rhinoceros, [they attain to] gratification for twelve years. Black pot herbs, sea-scrabs, meat of rhinoceros and black goat, honey and all other roots leads to their everlasting gratification.&#8221; Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Grihya Sutra of Hiranyakesin II Prasna, 5 Patala, 15 section, 1-9 On the following day he sacrifices a cow to the Fathers&#8230;When it has been sprinkled and fire has been carried round it, they kill it to the west of the fire, its head being turned to the west, its feet to the south. After it has been killed, he silently &#8216;strengthens&#8217; its sense-organs (by touching them) with water, and silently takes out the omentum, the heart, and the kidneys.…He sacrifices the omentum entirely. The other parts (Sutra 5) he should offer to the Brahmanas and should feed them (with those parts of the cow). When the food (for the Brahmanas) is ready, he cuts off (the Avadanas) together from the mess of boiled rice, and form the pieces of meat, and mixing them with clarified butter he makes oblations thereof with the verses, &#8216;Behold the Ekashtaka, the giver of food with meat and ghee, (which is offered) with (the word) svadha. By the Brahmanas that food is purified. May it be an imperishable (blessings to me! Svadha! Adoration!&#8217;</p>
<p>Grihya Sutra of Apastamba Patala 8, Section 22, 3-5 &#8220;On the following day he touches a cow with a Darbha blade, with the words, &#8216;I touch thee agreeable to the Fathers.&#8217; having silently offered five Agya oblations, and having cooked the omentum of the (cow), and performed the &#8216;spreading under&#8217; and the sprinkling over (of Agya), he sacrifices (the omentun) with the next (verse, II, 20, 28) with a Palasa leaf from the middle or the end (of the stalk). (He sacrifices) boiled rice together with the meat (of the cow) with the next (verses, II, 20, 29-35)</p>
<p>Asvalayana Grihya Sutra, 1 Adhyaya, 11 Kandika, 1-10 &#8220;Now (follows) the ritual of the animal sacrifice&#8230;To the west of the Samitra (fire) he (the Samitri) kills (the animal), the head of which is turned to the east or to the west, the feet to the north; and having placed a grass-blade on his side of the (animal&#8217;s) navel, (the &#8216;performer&#8217;) draws out the omentum, cuts off the omentum, seizes it with the two Agnisrapanis, sprinkles it with water, warms it at the Samitra (fire), takes it before that fire, roasts it, being seated to the south, goes round (the two fires), and sacrifices it.</p>
<p>Instructions on animal sacrifice is also mentioned in Asvalayana Grihya Sutra, II Adhyaya, 4 Kandika, 13; Asvalayana Grihya Sutra, IV Adhyaya, 8 Kandika, 16-18</p>
<p>Gutama Dharma Shastra 17.37-38 And (animals) that must be slain for (the fulfilment of) the sacred law. Let him eat (the flesh of animals) killed by beasts of prey, after having washed it, if no blemish is visible, and if it is declared to be fit for use by the word (of a Brahmana). I.e animals offered at Sraddhas and Srauta-sacrifices, though under other circumstances forbidden, may be eaten both by the priests and other Brahmanas.</p>
<p>Padma Purana 1.33.80 &#8220;O you of a good vow, satisfy the brahmanas with musk, and flesh and various kinds of grains, and by offering a Sraddha.&#8221; Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p>All these animals sacrificed to gods and manes is supposed to be eaten by the Brahmin priest. Some Aryas may cry that this has nothing to do with Hinduism, these are interpolated texts. But for their kind information, interpolation can occur only in one text, the same interpolation cannot happen in several texts like Manu Smriti, Yajnvalkya Smriti, Mahabharata, Vishnu, Markandeya, Matsya Puranas, Dharma Shastras and so on. The fact that this Shraddha for Pitrs occurs in so many Smritis and Puranas proves that Sages who wrote these books agreed with it, so do Hindus mean to say they know more about Hinduism than their sages?</p>

<h3><a id="post-6065-Rejecting-Meat"></a>Rejecting meat offered at Vedic sacrifice and ritual is sinful</h3>
<p>Hindu texts even say that one who refuses to eat meat offered to gods and manes at Shraddha is punished after death,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 5.35 But a man who, being duly engaged (to officiate or to dine at a sacred rite), refuses to eat meat, becomes after death an animal during twenty-one existences.</p>
<p>Vasistha Dharma Shastra 11.34 &#8216;But an ascetic who, invited to dine at a sacrifice of the manes or of the gods, rejects meat, shall go to hell for as many years as the slaughtered beast has hairs.&#8217;</p>
<p>Kurma Purana 2.17.40 &#8220;If a person invited for the Sraddha or the worship of a deity eschews meat he may have to be in the hell as many years as there are hairs on the body of the animal.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Kurma Purana II.22.74-75 &#8220;An excellent Brahmana engaged in the Sraddha should not avoid anything served. He should not refuse even the meat offered. One should not look at the food served to another person. If the Brahmanas who engaged in the Pitr rite, does not partake of the meat served, he is reborn as an animal for twenty-one births.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Vyasa Samhita 3.56-57 &#8220;A Brahmana, engaged in the celebration of a religious sacrifice, becomes degraded by not taking meat. A Kshatriya should eat the cooked flesh of a quarry after having propitiated therewith the gods and his departed manes. A Vaishya can take meat, lawfully obtained for money, after having worshipped therewith his departed manes.&#8221; Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>

<h3><a id="post-6065-Animals-Sacrifice"></a>Animals are created for sacrifice</h3>
<p>Manu Smriti 5.31-42 The consumption of meat (is befitting) for  sacrifices,&#8217; that is declared to be a rule made by the gods; but to persist (in using it) on other (occasions) is said to be a proceeding worthy of Rakshasas. He who eats meat, when he honours the gods and manes, commits no sin, whether he has bought it, or himself has killed (the animal), or has received it as a present from others…After death the guilt of one who slays deer for gain is not as (great) as that of him who eats meat for no (sacred) purpose. But a man who, being duly engaged (to officiate or to dine at a sacred rite), refuses to eat meat, becomes after death an animal during twenty-one existences…If he has a strong desire (for meat) he may make an animal of clarified butter or one of flour, (and eat that); but let him never seek to destroy an animal without a (lawful) reason. As many hairs as the slain beast has, so often indeed will he who killed it without a (lawful) reason suffer a violent death in future births. Svayambhu (the Self-existent) himself created animals for the sake of sacrifices; sacrifices (have been instituted) for the good of this whole (world); hence the slaughtering (of beasts) for sacrifices is not slaughtering (in the ordinary sense of the word)&#8230;On offering the honey-mixture (to a guest), at a sacrifice and at the rites in honour of the manes, but on these occasions only, may an animal be slain; that (rule) Manu proclaimed. A twice-born man who, knowing the true meaning of the Veda, slays an animal for these purposes, causes both himself and the animal to enter a most blessed state.</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti 51.61 It is for sacrifices that beasts have been created by the self-existent (Brahman) himself. Sacrificing causes the whole universe to prosper; therefore is the slaughter (of beasts) for a sacrifice no slaughter.</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti 51.65 That twice-born man who, knowing the exact truth (promulgated) in the Veda, slays cattle for the sacrifices (ordained in the Veda) will convey himself and the cattle (slain by him) to a blissful abode.</p>
<p>Chandogya Upanishad 8.15.1  …never giving pain to any creature, except at the tirthas  (sacrifices, &amp;c.), he who behaves thus all his life, reaches the world of Brahman, and does not return, yea, he does not return..</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam (Bhagvad Purana) 11.5.11 “In this material world the conditioned soul is always inclined to sex, meat-eating and intoxication. Therefore religious scriptures never actually encourage such activities. Although the scriptural injunctions provide for sex through sacred marriage, for meat-eating through sacrificial offerings and for intoxication through the acceptance of ritual cups of wine, such ceremonies are meant for the ultimate purpose of renunciation.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Mahabharata Book 3, Section 207 “And in days of yore, O Brahmana, two thousand animals used to be killed every day in the kitchen of king Rantideva…&#8217;The sacred fire is fond of animal food,&#8217; this saying has come down to us. And at sacrifices animals are invariably killed by regenerate Brahmanas, and these animals being purged of sin, by incantation of hymns, go to heaven. If, O Brahmana, the sacred fire had not been so fond of animal food in ancient times, it could never have become the food of any one. And in this matter of animal food, this rule has been laid down by Munis:–Whoever partakes of animal food after having first offered it duly and respectfully to the gods and the manes, is not polluted by the act. And such a man is not at all considered to have partaken of animal food…” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.163.12-13 “The strong Steed hath come forward to the slaughter, pondering with a mind directed God-ward. The goat who is his kin is led before him the sages and the singers follow after. The Steed is come unto the noblest mansion, is come unto his Father and his Mother. This day shall he approach the Gods, most welcome: then he declares good gifts to him who offers.” Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>Above verses from Mahabharata and Veda says that animals killed in Vedic sacrifice goes to heaven, on this statement I would like to mention the argument of Jains and Buddhists against this,</p>
<p>&#8220;If an animal slaughtered in religious worship is thereby raised to heaven, would it not be expedient for a man who institutes a sacrifice to kill his own father for a victim?&#8221;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a id="post-6065-Killing-nonviolent"></a>Killing animal is non-violent</h3>
<p>Vedic verses clearly tells us that killing animal is part of Yajna (sacrifice). Maharshi Manu also writes that slaughtering animals for sacrifices is non-violent,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 5.44 Know that the injury to moving creatures and to those destitute of motion, which the Veda has prescribed for certain occasions, is no injury at all; for the sacred law shone forth from the Veda.</p>
<p>Whether animals should be killed in Yajna (Sacrifices) or not is explained in detail in the Devi Bhagawatam,</p>
<p>Devi Bhagwatam 1.18.48-61 &#8220;…O King! One can see before one&#8217;s eyes that the drinking of Soma rasa, the killing of animals, the eating of fish and flesh and so are advised in the Vedas; so much so that in the sacrificial ceremony named Sautrâmana the rule of drinking wine and many other vratas are clearly mentioned; even gambling is advised in the Vedas. So how can Mukti be obtained by following the Veda Dharma? It is heard that, in ancient times, there was a great king, named S&#8217;as&#8217;avindu, very religious, truthful, and performing sacrifices, very liberal; he protected the virtuous, and chastised those that were wicked and going astray. He performed many Yajñas, where many cows and sheep were sacrificed according to the rules of the Vedas and abundant Dakshinâs (sacrificial fees) were presented to every one that performed their parts in the sacrifices. In these sacrifices, the hides of the cows that were sacrificed as victims, were heaped to such an enormous extent that they looked liked a second Bindhyâchal mountain. Then the rains fell and the dirty water coming out of that enormous heap of skins flowed down and gave rise to a river which was thence called the Charmanvatî river… Janaka said :– &#8220;The killing of animals in a sacrificial ceremony is not killing; it is known as Ahimsa [Non Violence]; for that himsa [Violence] is not from any selfish attachment; therefore when there is no such sacrifice and the animals are killed out of selfish attachment, then that is real himsâ; … O Dvija! Really speaking, the killing of animals done by the house-holder attached to senses and their objects, and done under their impulses can be taken into account as a real act of killing; but, O Mahâbhâga of those whose hearts are not attached to anything of those self controlled persons, desirous of moksa, if they do an act of Himsa out of a sense of duty, with no desires of fruits and with their hearts free from egoism that can never be reckoned as a real act of killing.&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 3.26.32-34 &#8220;Those who eat meat, they can sacrifice animals in this worship of the Devî; and, for this purpose, goat and wild boars are the best. O sinless one! The goats, etc., offered as a sacrifice before the Devî attain to unending heavens. Therefore persons offering the sacrifices of goats do not incur any sin. O king! The goats, etc., and other beast offered as a sacrifice before the Devas undoubtedly go to the heavenly regions; therefore, in all the S&#8217;âstras, it has been decided that this killing of animals in a sacrifice is considered as non-killing.&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti 51.67 That slaughter which is in accordance with the precepts of the Veda, and has been fixed for this world of movable and immovable creatures, should be considered as no slaughter at all; because it is from the Veda that law shines forth.</p>
<p>Kalki Purana 26.12 &#8220;&#8230;The Vedas therefore say that killing in a righteous battle or in a sacrificial performace does not constitute killing.&#8221; Tr. Bhumipati Das, edited by Purnaprajna Das</p>
<p>Following verse from Vasistha explains Manu Smriti 5.48 which is used by Hindu apologists to prohibit meat consumption in Manu,</p>
<p>Vasistha Dharma Shastra 4.5-8 The Manava (Sutra states), &#8216;Only when he worships the manes and the gods, or honours guests, he may certainly do injury to animals.&#8217; On offering a Madhuparka (to a guest), at a sacrifice, and at the rites in honour of the manes, but on these occasions only may an animal be slain; that (rule) Manu proclaimed.&#8221;Meat can never be obtained without injuring living beings, and to injure living beings does not procure heavenly bliss; therefore the (sages declare) the slaughter (of beasts) at a sacrifice not to be slaughter (in the ordinary sense of the word).&#8217; &#8216;Now he may also cook a full-grown ox or a full-grown he-goat for a Brâhmana or Kshatriya guest; in this manner they offer hospitality to such (a man).</p>

<h3><a id="post-6065-Examples"></a>Examples of meat consumption</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Krishna</strong></p>
<p>Krishna recommended slaughtering animals for worshipping Govardhan Mountain and also ate the flesh of animals that was offered by the people,</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 5.10.36-49 “Let prayer and offerings then be addressed to the mountain Govarddhana, and kill a victim in due form. Let the whole station collect their milk without delay, and feed with it the Brahmans and all who may desire to partake of it. When the oblations have been presented, and the Brahmans have been fed, let the Gopas circumambulate the cows, decorated with garlands of autumnal flowers. If the cowherds will attend to these suggestions, they will secure the favour of the mountain, of the cattle, and also mine.&#8221; When Nanda and the other Gopas heard these words of Krishńa, their faces expanded with delight, and they said that he had spoken well. &#8220;You have judged rightly, child,&#8221; exclaimed they; &#8220;we will do exactly as you have proposed, and offer adoration to the mountain.&#8221; Accordingly the inhabitants of Vraja worshipped the mountain, presenting to it curds and milk and flesh; and they fed hundreds and thousands of Brahmans, and many other guests, who came to the ceremony, even as Krishńa had enjoined: and when they had made their offerings, they circumambulated the cows and the bulls, that bellowed as loud as roaring clouds. Upon the summit of Govarddhana, Krishńa presented himself, saying, &#8220;I am the mountain,&#8221; and partook of much food presented by the Gopas; whilst in his own form as Krishńa he ascended the hill along with the cowherds, and worshipped his other self. Having promised them many blessings, the mountain-person of Krishńa vanished; and the ceremony being completed, the cowherds returned to their station.” Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>H.H. Wilson also writes about it in his introduction of translation of Vishnu Purana,</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;and says that at Krsna&#8217;s advice Nanda and the other cowherds worshipped the mount Govardhana with the offer of various kinds of foods including meat of a sacrificial animal killed on that occasion and that Krsna took his seat on the mount, identifying himself with it, and ate up much of the food thus offered by the cowherds&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>It is also mentioned in Harivamsha Purana,</p>
<p>Harimvsha Purana 2.17.15-21 &#8220;Let us kill the animals such as buffalos to be eaten. Let this sacrifice be conducted with all gopas…Along with a pond of curd, a vortex of ghee, a river of milk, a variety of meat and a mountain of cooked rice, the entire complex of vraja including the happy gopa-s and beautiful gopi-s proceeded for the hill sacrifice…At the start of the sacrifice, the items were offered to the fire as ordained. The gopa-s performed the sacrifice along with brahmins on an auspicious day. At the end of the sacrifice, by illusion, Krishna became the hill and consumed the best rice, milk, curd and meat which were offered.&#8221; Tr. A. Purushothaman and A. Harindranath</p>
<p>This is also mentioned in Brahma Purana,</p>
<p>Brahma Purana 79.21 &#8220;[Krishna said] Hence, let the mountain Govardhana be honoured and worshipped with all due offerings after killing the sacrificial animal in accordance with injunctions. [25] Vyasa said: O brahmins, on hearing these words of his, Nanda and other residents of the colony became delighted with their faces beaming with pleasure. They said &#8216;Well said, well said, my boy&#8230;Accordingly the residents of colony performed Yajna unto the mountain. They offered oblations unto the mountain by curds, milk puddings, meat etc.&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Hundreds of animals were slaughtered and wine was drunk by Krishna&#8217;s family and Pandavas,</p>
<p>Mahabharata Virata Parva 4, Section 72, Verses 19-28 &#8220;And Krishna gave unto each of the illustrious sons of Pandu numerous female slaves, and gems and robes. And then the nuptial festival set in between the families of the Matsya king and the Pandavas. And then conchs and cymbals and horns and drums and other musical instruments appointed by the Pandavas, began to play in the palace of Virata. And deer of various kinds and clean animals by hundreds were slain. And wines of various kinds and intoxicating juices of trees were profusely collected.&#8221; Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>

<p>This proves that meat was part of his lavish lifestyle in the palace. Rama also used to relish pork, meat of deer and other animals in the forest after the exile,</p>
<p>Valmiki Ramayana, Ayodhya Kanda 2.52.102 &#8220;Famished, they (Rama and Lakshmana) killed a boar, a rishya (whitefooted male antelope), a spotted deer and a great deer with black stripes. They partook the meat and reached a tree by evening where they rested for the night.&#8221; Tr. <a href="https://www.valmiki.iitk.ac.in/sloka?field_kanda_tid=2&amp;language=dv&amp;field_sarga_value=52" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">IIT Kanpur<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>Valmiki Ramayana Ayodhya Kanda 2.96.1-2 &#8220;Having shown Mandakini River in that manner to Seetha, the daughter of Mithila, Rama set on the hill-side in order to gratify her appetite with a piece of flesh. Rama, whose mind was devoted to righteousness stayed there with Seetha, saying; &#8220;This meat is fresh, this is savoury and roasted in the fire.&#8221; Tr. Shri K.M.K. Murthy</p>
<p>Sita addressed Ravana (who was in the guise of an ascetic) in the following way,</p>
<p>Valmiki Ramayana 3.47.22b-23 &#8220;Be comfortable for a moment, here it is possible for you to make a sojourn, and soon my husband will be coming on taking plentiful forest produce, and on killing stags, mongooses, wild boars he fetches meat, aplenty.&#8221; Tr. Desiraju Hanumanth Rao</p>
<p>This is what Rama said to Lakshamana on hunting a golden deer,</p>
<p>Valmiki Ramayana, Aranya Kanda 3.43.31 &#8220;Kings pursuing games of hunting in great forests, oh, Lakshmana, will be felling deer either for the sake of flesh, or just for the purpose of sporting archery.&#8221; Tr. Desiraju Hanumant Rao</p>
<p>Ramayana of Valmiki, Ayodhya Kanda 2, Sarga 55, verse 33 “Thereafter having travelled only a couple of miles the two brothers Rama and Lakshmana killed many consecrated deer and ate in the river-forest of Yamuna.” Tr. K.M.K. Murthy</p>
<p>Bali addresses Rama,</p>
<p>Ramayana of Valmiki, Kishikindha Kanda 4, Sarga 17, Verse 39 &#8220;Raghava, five kinds of five-nailed animals, viz., a kind of wild rodent, a kind of wild-boar, a kind of lizard, a hare and fifthly the turtle are edible for Brahmans and Kshatriya-s.&#8221; Tr. Desiraju Hanumanta Rao</p>
<p>Rama&#8217;s father Dashratha was an avid hunter,</p>
<p>Valmiki Ramayana, Ayodhya Kanda 2.63.21-25 &#8220;With a wish to do hunting as an exercise in that most comfortable season, I went along Sarayu River, in a chariot, wearing bow and arrows. Without my senses under control and with an intent to kill there a (wild) buffalo or an elephant or any other wild animal coming in the night at that place for the purpose of drinking water, I was ready with my bow at a solitary place. Hearing the sound, I killed turning towards it, a wild animal, which came to the bank of Sarayu River and another violent beast too which came there. Meanwhile, in that darkness and not within the react of the eye, I heard the sound of a pitcher being filled up, the sound of which appeared like that of an elephant. With an intent to hit that elephant, I drew out a shining arrow resembling a serpent, targeted towards the direction sound and discharged it.&#8221; Tr. Shri K.M.K Murthy</p>
<p>Some Hindus says that meat shouldn&#8217;t be consumed in Kali Yuga. But they are unaware of the fact that Kalki avatar who will be born in Kali Yuga will offer meat to Brahmins as per Kalki Purana,</p>
<p>Kalki Purana 30.10-13 &#8220;Lord Kalki sumptuously fed all the brahmanas the four kinds of food that are chewed, licked, sucked, and rank, and this included vegetable preparations, soup, cakes, meat, fruit, roots, and many other items&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Bhumipati Das, edited by Purnaprajna Das</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Shiva</strong></p>
<p>Mahabharata Book 13, Section 161, Verse 7 &#8220;And since he burns and oppresses, is keen and fierce, and endued with great energy, and is engaged in eating flesh and blood and marrow, he is said to be Rudra.&#8221; Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.30.202 &#8220;Hail to the one greedy of raw and cooked meat&#8230;[211] Obeisance to the jackal (fond of) embryo meal&#8230;&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Kalki</strong></p>
<p>Kalki avatar tells to perform horse sacrifice,</p>
<p>Kalki Purana 3.42 &#8220;(Lord Kalki said:) Many pious human beings become degraded in this age of Kali. But because of My presence, they will all become pious once again. Now I would like that all of you worship Me by the performance of a Rajasuya sacrifice and a horse sacrifice.&#8221; Tr. Bhumipati Das, edited by Purnaprajna Das</p>
<p>Kalki Purana also says that Vishnuyasa father of Kalki avatar will perform horse sacrifice. This proves that Ashvamedha Yajna (horse sacrifice) is permissible in Kali Yuga also. Secondly, Vedas are said to be eternal which permits animal slaughter so there is no prohibition to consume meat in Kali Yuga. Mahabharata also shows that Brahmins used to relish meat,</p>
<p>Mahabharata Book 3, Section 96 &#8220;…The Brahmana, however, did not grant the Asura a son like Indra. And at this, the Asura was inflamed with wrath against the Brahmana. And from that day, O king, the Asura Ilwala became a destroyer of Brahmanas. And endued with power of illusion the angry Asura transformed his brother into a ram. And Vatapi also capable of assuming any form at will, would immediately assume the shape of a ram. And the flesh of that ram, after being properly dressed, was offered to Brahmanas as food. And after they had eaten of it, they were slain. For whomsoever Ilwala summoned with his voice, he would come back to Ilwala even if he had gone to the abode of Yama, in re-embodied form endued with life, and show himself to Ilwala. And so having transformed the Asura Vatapi into a ram and properly cooked his flesh and feeding Brahmanas therewith, he would summon Vatapi…&#8221; Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Ashwamedha Yajna mentioned in Mahabharata,</p>
<p>Mahabharata Book 14, Section 89 “Vaisampayana said, &#8216;Having cooked, according to due rites, the other excellent animals that were sacrificed, the priests then sacrificed, agreeably to the injunctions of the scriptures, that steed (which had wandered over the whole world). After cutting that horse into pieces, conformably to scriptural directions, they caused Draupadi of great intelligence, who was possessed of the three requisites of mantras, things, and devotion, to sit near the divided animal. The Brahmanas then with cool minds, taking up the marrow of that steed, cooked it duly, O chief of Bharata&#8217;s race. King Yudhishthira the just, with all his younger brothers, then smelled, agreeably to the scriptures, the smoke, capable of cleansing one from every sin, of the marrow that was thus cooked. The remaining limbs, O king, of that horse, were poured into the fire by the sixteen sacrificial priests possessed of great wisdom.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p><strong>OTHERS</strong></p>
<p>Rishi Agastya is said to have eaten beasts and birds and even a Asura who was in the form of a ram,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 5.22-23 Beasts and birds recommended (for consumption) may be slain by Brahmanas for sacrifices, and in order to feed those whom they are bound to maintain; for Agastya did this of old. For in ancient (times) the sacrificial cakes were (made of the flesh) of eatable beasts and birds at the sacrifices offered by Brahmanas and Kshatriyas.</p>
<p>Vasistha Dharma Shastra 14.15. For it is declared in the Veda, &#8216;At a sacrificial session (sattra), which lasted one thousand years, Agastya went out to hunt. He had sacrificial cakes prepared with the meat of beasts and fowls good (to eat).&#8217;</p>
<p>Mahabharata Book 3, Section 199 &#8220;Lomasa said, &#8216;When Ilwala learnt that those kings along with the great Rishi had arrived on the confines of his domain, he went out with his ministers and worshipped them duly. And that prince of Asuras received them hospitably, entertaining them, O son of the Kuru race, with well dressed meat supplied by his brother Vatapi (transformed into a ram). Then all those royal sages, beholding the mighty Asura Vatapi, who had been transformed into a ram thus cooked for them, became sad and cheerless and were nearly deprived of themselves. But that best of Rishis&#8211;Agastya&#8211;addressing those royal sages, said, &#8216;Yield ye not to grief, I will eat up the great Asura.&#8217; And the mighty Rishi then sat himself down on an excellent seat, and the prince of Asuras, Ilwala, began to distribute the food smilingly. And Agastya ate up the whole of the meat supplied by Vatapi (transformed into a ram).” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Following verse shows that animal sacrifice was performed to please departed manes,</p>
<p>Brahma Purana 5.47-50 &#8220;&#8230;On the Astaka day Iksvaku commanded Vikuksi &#8216;O powerful one, kill some rabbits and bring their flesh for performing Sraddha.&#8217;O Brahmins, after planning to perform the Sraddha rite before executing it he ate part of the meat of the rabbit which was meant for the Sraddha&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>This is also mentioned in Devi Bhagavatam and Srimad Bhagavatam 9.6.6-8 and Devi Bhagavatam,</p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 7.59.1-11. Vyâsa said :&#8211; O King! Once on a time, the time for Astaka S&#8217;râddha (the funeral ceremony in honour of the departed) arrived. Seeing this, the King Iksâku ordered his son Vikuksi:&#8211; &#8220;O Child! Go immediately to the forest and bring carefully pure sanctified meat for the S&#8217;râddha purposes; see, that there be no neglect of duty.&#8221; Thus ordered, Vikuksi instantly went to the forest equipped with arms. He hunted in the forest lots of boars, pigs, deer, and hare. But he was so very tired with his journey in the forest and got so hungry that he forgot everything about the Astaka S&#8217;râddha and ate one hare there in the forest. The remaining excellent meat he brought and handed over to his father. When that meat was brought to be sprinkled for purification, the family priest Vas&#8217;istha, on seeing it, at once came to know that some portion had already been eaten and it was the remaining part. The leavings of food are not fit for the sprinkling purposes; this is the S&#8217;âstric rule…&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 5.20.16-50 &#8220;&#8230;The Râjasik Brâhmanas were versed in the Vedas and acted as priests to the Ksattriyas and ate flesh as sanctioned by recognised rules. They were busy with their six duties&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Sons of Pandu killed many animals and offered them to Brahmins,</p>
<p>Mahabharata Book 3, Section 80 &#8220;And, O chief of the Bharata race, those mighty warriors endowed with great prowess slew with pure arrows various kinds of sacrificial animals for the Brahmanas. And those tigers among men and repressors of foes, daily slaying those wild animals and sanctifying them properly, offered them unto the Brahmanas.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Mahabharata Book 1, Section 116 says that Rishi Vyasa divided meat ball into 100 pieces and gave it to Gandhari so she can conceive 100 sons.</p>
<p>Munis also used to partake meat,</p>
<p>Mahabharata Book 3, Section 159 &#8220;Having heard from that one of incomparable energy, (Arshtishena), that advice conducive to their welfare, those foremost of the Bharatas, began to behave always accordingly. Those best of men, the Pandavas, dwelt upon the Himavan, partaking of the food eaten by the Munis, and luscious fruit, and the flesh of deer killed with unpoisoned shafts and various kinds of pure honey.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Mahabharata Book 2, Section 4 &#8220;Vaisampayana said,&#8211;&#8220;Then that chief of men, king Yudhishthira, entered that palatial sabha having first fed ten thousand Brahmanas with preparations of milk and rice mixed with clarified butter and honey with fruits and roots, and with pork and venison. The king gratified those superior Brahmanas, who had come from various countries with food seasoned with seasamum and prepared with vegetables called jibanti, with rice mixed with clarified butter, with different preparations of meat&#8211;with indeed various kinds of other food, as also numberless viands that are fit to be sucked and innumerable kinds of drinks, with new and unused robes and clothes, and with excellent floral wreaths.&#8221; Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Some Hindus might try to twist the Vedic verses by saying they does not mean what they say, they are allegorical. You cannot say verses from Manu Smriti, Upanishad, Brahmanas etc., are allegorical, all those verses including the Vedic verses on meat consumption are literal. There is no prohibition of meat consumption in Hindu scriptures, so Hindus should not just enjoy eating meat secretly at night but they should start eating openly during day also.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">Written by Abd Al Muhsin Al Hindy<br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">The proponents <em>(blind-follower&#8217;s)</em> of protestant Hinduism stress that their cult<em> (and Vedic Hinduism)</em> is strictly monotheistic and has nothing to do with dualism, polytheism, pantheism, monistic or any other conception of God but monotheism. Whereas the orthodox Hindus maintain the opposite, that Vedic Dharma <em>(Vedic Religion)</em> is not monotheistic and the cult <em>(Protestant Hinduism, so-called Arya Samāj)</em> is unorthodox and deviated. In order to solve this <em>&#8216;mystery&#8217;</em>, we&#8217;ll be showing <span style="text-decoration:underline;">few more proofs</span>, which will prove that protestant Hinduism is purely non-monotheistic, wearing garb of monotheism in order to delude and lead people astray, especially those who try to seek truth. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">This sub-section aims at exposing the polytheist <em>(i.e. protestant Hindus) </em>posing as monotheists</span>. In the previous sub-section<em> (i.e. <strong>&#8216;A) Is Protestant Hinduism Monotheistic?&#8217;</strong>) ,</em>we&#8217;ve already provided many proofs, to prove the non-monotheistic nature of protestant Hinduism, still we want to block any mice holes through which any such false claim could be made or even be thought of.<br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span id="more-1648"></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><strong>b.1) Ishwar is Dependent not Independent – </strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">We&#8217;ve seen the <strong>&#8216;proposed definition&#8217;</strong> for Omnipotence by the protestant Hindus, now its time to put this proposed definition to scrutiny and see whether it can rightly depict the true picture of Protestant Hindu god Ishwar. Again in a precise manner we&#8217;ll be stating the &#8216;proposed definition&#8217; as given by protestant Hindus – </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><span style="color:#ff9900;"><strong>Agniveer </strong></span>the new Islāmophobe <em>(once was a &#8220;wannabee&#8221; but now is full-fledged Islāmophobe)</em>, hate-monger wrote –</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">&#8220;<strong>Omnipotence means that Ishwar <span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;">does not need help of any other entity</span> to conduct His duties</strong> – creation, management, destruction of universe. He is self-sufficient to conduct His duties&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Moolshankar Tiwāri <em>(Dayānanda Saraswati)</em> wrote – </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">&#8220;It really means that God <strong>does not require the least assistance</strong> from any person in all His works such as Creation, Sustenance and Dissolution of the Universe, and administration</span> of Divine Justice. In other words, He does all His works with His own infinite power.&#8221; –  [SP, Ch 7, pg. 208, Tr.Chiranjiva] [See Sub-section a.2 for the complete source]</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Moolshankar <em>(Dayānanda Saraswati)</em> wrote – </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">&#8220;…<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>God stands in need of nobody&#8217;s least help</strong></span> in doing His work of creation, preservation, and destruction, and in doing equitable justice to souls according to their merits and demerits. In other words, <strong>He accomplishes all His works out of His own infinite power</strong>.&#8221;                                                   </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">In the earlier sub-section we had hinted at the dependent nature of Ishwar, and Inshā&#8217;Allāh we&#8217;ll expound on it more in this sub-section, as we read above, that the proposed definition of <strong>&#8220;Omnipotence&#8221;</strong> is <strong>&#8220;[Ishwar]</strong><br />
<strong><span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;">does not need help of any other entity</span>&#8221; </strong>as stated by the Islāmophobe Agniveer. But does Ishwar stands true to this <strong>&#8216;proposed definition&#8217;? </strong>We learn that according to Mooshankar, his god Ishwar needs nobody&#8217;s help? Well that&#8217;s quite contradictory to the apparent facts, which we&#8217;ve seen and other are mentioned below.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">We&#8217;ve have sufficiently shown the distorted nature of the <strong>&#8216;proposed definition&#8217;</strong> of <strong>Omnipotence</strong> by Moolshankar, and shown his deception, now we seek to elaborate something which readers may have noticed in our early points but may not have fathomed it completely. Above we saw the definition of <em>&#8220;Omnipotence&#8221; </em>by Protestant Hindus where they claim that Omnipotence means &#8220;<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">God does not require the least assistance from any person</span>&#8221; or &#8220;Ishwar does not need help of any other entity&#8221; or &#8220;<span style="text-decoration:underline;">God stands in need of nobody&#8217;s least help</span>.&#8221;</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">The problem with their &#8216;<strong>proposed definition&#8217; </strong>is that their god Ishwar does not stand true even upon this definition<span style="text-decoration:underline;">! Ishwar does require </span>the assistance<em> (help)</em> of Ātmā <em>(Human Souls)</em> and Prakriti <em>(Primordial matter)</em> for the creation of this universe. </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">All of his duties (<em>Ishwar&#8217;s)</em> are dependent on basically two things – Ātmā <em>(Human Souls)</em> and Prakriti <em>(Primordial matter)</em>, hence he is not self-sufficient nor is he independent of others and their help.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">For instance, what if Ātmā <em>(Human Souls)</em> refuse to <em>(or don&#8217;t)</em> inhabit the bodies created by Ishwar using Prakriti? As according to protestant Hinduism, Ātmā <em>(Human Souls)</em> are &#8216;sat&#8217; <em>(eternal)</em> and have &#8216;chit&#8217; <em>(conscious)</em> , where as Ishwar is &#8216;sat&#8217; <em>(eternal)</em> has chit <em>(conscious)</em> and has &#8216;ānanda&#8217; <em>(bliss)[hence protestant god Ishwar is known as Satchidananda], and prakriti( primordial matter)</em>  is only &#8216;sat&#8217;<em>(eternal)</em> and lacks the other 2 attributes.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">As these souls have conscious they are responsible whether or not to associate themselves with the bodies…etc made using prakriti, by Ishwar. And this is what is stated by a Protestant Hindu Pandit in his book – </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><strong>&#8220;Souls tend to <span style="color:red;">associate</span> themselves with matter </strong><span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;">but are free</span><strong> to do so with God</strong>. In the former case they are subject to births and deaths, in the latter case they acquire bliss which is a divine attribute. <strong>In both cases it retains its individuality being uncreated and indestructible.</strong>&#8220;</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">       – [The Handbook of Ārya Samāj, pg 41, Pandit Vishnu Lāl Sharmā, Ārya Pratinidhi Sabhā]</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">We question, what if all the Ātma <em>(Human Souls)</em> refuse to associate themselves with Ishwar and matter <em>(Ishwar made Bodies…etc)</em>? The <strong>making</strong> of this universe cannot be completed, without their help and co-operation! Now you need not be &#8216;scholar&#8217; or even a &#8216;graduate&#8217; from MIT, Harvard or NASA to predict and guess the outcome of such situation! It&#8217;s evident that Ishwar is NOT Self-sufficient and requires assistance<em> (needs prakriti)</em> from prakriti for making universe and co-operation from Ātmā to make the universe working. So who does Ishwar need and depend?</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">1)      Ātmā <em>(Human Souls)</em></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">2)      Prakriti<em>(Primordial matter)</em></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Ishwar depends and needs Prakriti <em>(Primordial matter)</em> for creating this universe, hence he cannot be self-sufficient or independent.Moreover Ishwar also requires  Ātmā <em>(Human Souls)</em>to make his universe <strong>&#8220;living&#8221;</strong> or <strong>&#8220;active&#8221;</strong> as mere bodies without souls are nothing but matter. Hence for a <strong>&#8220;working&#8221;</strong>, <strong>&#8220;active&#8221;</strong> universe Ishwar heavily depends upon his two other partners named above.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Now let&#8217;s assume for the sake of argumentation, that – </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Ātmā <em>(Human Souls)</em> totally including everyone of the souls, agree to either associate with, matter <em>(Ishwar&#8217;s making i.e. Universe, Human Bodies…Etc)</em> or Ishwar, so will then Ishwar be Omnipotent according to the <strong>&#8216;proposed definition&#8217;</strong> of omnipotence by protestant Hindus?</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Of course not as, even then Ishwar will still be dependent on prakriti<em>(Primordial Matter)</em>, for making universe, Human bodies, animal bodies…etc as Ishwar cannot create primordial matter<em>(prakriti)</em> nor destroy it, he is a mere &#8216;Fashioner&#8217; or &#8216;Engineer&#8217; of it ,in terms of Agniveer.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Hence in no way, either by the correct definition of &#8216;Omnipotence&#8221; or by the distorted definition <em>(<strong>&#8216;proposed definition&#8217; </strong>by protestant Hindus)</em> is Ishwar OMNIPOTENT.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">This ultimately proves that God is purely in need of the other 2 co-eternal entities. Hence even the &#8216;proposed&#8217; definition of Omnipotence <em>(i.e. &#8220;<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">God does not require the least assistance from any person</span>&#8221; or &#8220;<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Ishwar does not need help of any other entity&#8221;</span> or &#8220;<span style="text-decoration:underline;">He is self-sufficient to conduct His duties</span>.&#8221;)</strong></em> is too big for Ishwar. And that he <em>(Ishwar) </em>does not stand up to this definition. This materialistic view of creation makes protestant Hinduism very close to materialism; it would be ridiculous of thinking them to be monotheistic in any sense.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Now, that we&#8217;ve learned how desperately Ishwar&#8217;s in need of prakriti and Human souls, but let&#8217;s see another scenario, where Ishwar has run into bankruptcy. Moolshankar<em><span style="color:black;"> (Day</span>ā<span style="color:black;">nanda Saraswati)</span></em>, wrote in his <span style="color:black;"><strong><em>&#8216;Bible of Hate&#8217;</em></strong><br />
<em>(Satyarth Prak</em></span><em>ā<span style="color:black;">sh)</span></em> :</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><strong>13. No, there can be no dearth of souls, because the emancipated souls are replaced by new ones that God creates.</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><strong>A </strong>– &#8220;…Fifthly, if you say that God creates new souls, <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>the material out of which He creates them will eventually run short</strong></span>; because a bank, however wealthy it may be that has a constant drain on it, but has no income, is sure to become bankrupt sooner or later.&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">                                             – [Satyarth Prakash, Ch 9, pg. 287, Tr.Chiranjiva Bhardawaja]</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><strong>Q. God replaces the saved souls with the newly created souls on earth. So they never come to an end.</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><strong>A </strong>&#8211; &#8220;…If God creates new souls, <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>the material out of which He creates them, will be exhausted</strong></span>; for, however much a treasure may be, it will sooner or later run out, if there be nothing bat drawings upon it and no puttings in it.&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">                                              &#8211; [Satyarth Prakash, Ch 9, pg. 264, Tr.Durga Prasad]</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">What, you&#8217;ve read above is a question posed to Moolshankar related to emancipation souls <em>(he was trying to refute the notion that souls are created at which he fails drastically)</em>, and while answering this question Moolshankar states that <span style="text-decoration:underline;">&#8220;matter&#8221; is limited and will get exhausted one day or the other</span>. It&#8217;s the protestant Hindu belief that except god <em>(Ishwar)</em> the other 2 entity are finite. Hence this makes Moolshakar assert that &#8220;prakriti&#8221; <em>(Primordial matter)</em> is limited and one day will get depleted.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">This belief of limited or finite prakriti <em>(Primordial matter)</em> strengthens our argument of Ishwar being dependent and provides a blow to the so-called, distortedly fake, Omnipotence of Ishwar. </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Mavericks like us would question – </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><strong>What if prakriti <em>(Primordial matter)</em> gets depleted? </strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<div style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Well, Ishwar will no longer be able to provide for the Humans Souls <em>(Ātmā)</em> for their sustenance. And then Ishwar will be in a big trouble! And when Ishwar cannot provide for Humans Souls <em>(Ātmā)</em> living in material bodies engineered by Ishwar using prakriti <em>(Primordial matter)</em> then by effect Ishwar will cease to be the Sustainer of his own engineering&#8217;s <em>(i.e Human Bodies,Universe…etc)</em> So this rips Ishwar from the attribute of <em>&#8220;Sustainer&#8221;</em> too.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></div>
</li>
<li>
<div style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Seccondly, this strengthens our claim that Ishwar is extremely dependent on prakriti <em>(Primordial Matter)</em>.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></div>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><strong>b.2) Attributes of Ishwar – </strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Attributes and names of God are the crux of theology of any religious denomination and these attributes are very intrinsic to the concept of God, as these attributes define and make us understand what God is – to an extent. Since early times, mankind has been in an abyss of darkness due to its misunderstanding of these attributes of God, it&#8217;s these attributes which play a major role in conceptualizing the &#8216;Concept of God&#8217; in any religion, and if these attributes are misunderstood then the consequences are devastating. We&#8217;ll be having a concise look at the names and attributes of Ishwar as stated and understood by Moolshankar <em>(Dayānanda Saraswati)</em></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">&#8220;<strong>Virat</strong>-The word virat (an illumer) is derived from the root &#8216;raj&#8217;: to illume or shine, with the prefix &#8216;vi&#8217; and &#8216;kvipa&#8217; termination. He who illumes and manifests the world in various forms, is called Virat. Hence it means God.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Here above, we&#8217;ve enumerated few <em>(reproducing all names would take a huge amount of space, and would be un-yielding)</em> names of protestant Hindu god Ishwar, as enlisted by Moolshankar in his <strong>&#8216;Bible of Hate&#8217;</strong><em> (i.e. Satyarth Prakāsh).</em> There is huge controversy what these name mean, for instance Orthodox Hindus maintain that <strong>&#8216;Agni&#8217; </strong>means fire primarily where as Moolshankar believes it to be a name of Ishwar. We won&#8217;t be delving into this controversy as it&#8217;s beyond the scope of this article<em> (treatise)</em>, the purpose of mentioning this was to show the vast differing between mainstream Hinduism and protestant Hinduism, and to expose these so-called names of God, we need just a single verse from the divine revelation from Allāh Azz wa Jall our alone One true God.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">The Noble Qur&#8217;ān says which means,</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><strong><span style="color:purple;">&#8220;You do not worship besides Him but only names which you have</span><br />
<span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;">named <em>(forged)</em></span><br />
<span style="color:purple;">– you and your fathers – for which Allāh has sent down no authority.</span></strong><br />
<span style="color:purple;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">The command <em>(or the judgement)</em> is for none but All</span>ā<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>. He has commanded that you worship none but Him <em>(i.e. His Monotheism)</em>; that is the <em>(true)</em> straight religion, but most men know not.&#8221;</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">We see how the Noble Qur&#8217;ān refutes the misdoings of people like Moolshankar, his predecessors and other polytheists, the above divine verse from the Noble Qur&#8217;ān clearly states that the different names, which are claimed to be of the one true Almighty God <em>(Allāh)</em> by the polytheists like protestant Hindus are just FORGERIES by these protestant Hindus and their deviant predecessors. These protestant Hindus like their idol worshipping predecessors have merely concocted names which have no authority from the true Almighty God<em> (Allāh)</em>.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">The above verse, also makes it clears, that this protestant Hindu POLYTHEISM has no authority from the One True Almighty God <em>(Allāh)</em>, hence we Muslims would like to call our protestant Hindu truth-seekers and our readers to the straight path – True Religion , Islām. </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Now coming to the attributes of Ishwar – the protestant Hindu god, we&#8217;ve earlier stated/proved few attributed of Ishwar they are – </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">We learn that Moolshankar holds his god Ishwar the so-called supreme spirit to be incomparable, also his interpretation of Vedas assert to this.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">But according to the same Yajurveda , which first states that Ishwar is &#8216;Incomparable&#8217; but later on compares him to a <strong>&#8216;shining man of knowledge&#8217; –</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

Amazing, isn&#8217;t it? How incoherent are Vedas! I think this should be enough to prove our point, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">also another important point to be noticed is &#8220;anthropomorphism&#8221;, Yajurveda clearly states the Hindu protestant God Ishwar, shines <span style="color:red;"><strong>LIKE</strong></span> the shining man of knowledge</span>! This is explicit anthropomorphism, of which few instances were quite evident from Moolshankar&#8217;s <em>(and his blind-follower)</em> writings which we had quoted in earlier sections.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">We think it&#8217;s completely proven with no ounce of doubt left, that Ishwar is Comparable and that Vedas are self-contradictory. Still for the sake of argumentation and nailing the issue lets see some other facts which prove Ishwar to be completely comparable.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Above quoted statements of Moolshankar<em> (Dayānanda Saraswati)</em> prove the following things – </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">1)      <strong>Ishwar</strong> and <strong>Human Souls </strong><em>(Ātmā) </em>are <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>beginning-less</strong></span><br />
<em>(also prakriti as stated in Section A).</em></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">2)      <strong>Human Souls </strong><em>(Ātmā)</em>and <strong>Ishwar </strong>have by nature <strong>IDENTICAL attributes </strong>for instance<strong> ,</strong> they both are CONSCIOUS ,pure, immortal, virtuous…etc</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">So what does this prove? Such belief-system legitimizes <strong>&#8220;Comparing&#8221;</strong> the protestant Hindu god <strong>Ishwar </strong>to <strong>Human Souls</strong><em> (Ātmā)</em><strong> and prakriti </strong><em>(Primordial matter)</em><strong> as all the 3 entities are – </strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><strong>a)</strong>      <strong><em>Beginning-less</em>, b) <em>Eternal,</em> c) <em>Uncreated</em></strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">So it&#8217;s possible to say that <em>&#8216;Ishwar is Eternal like(identical) prakriti&#8217;</em> or <em>&#8216;Ishwar is beginning-less like(identical) Human Souls&#8217;</em> or <em>&#8216;Ishwar and other 2 entities are alike in 3 attributes namely beginning-less, Eternal, Uncreated-ness&#8217;</em></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">The problem is with <strong>IDENTICAL</strong> attributes <em>(Eternal,Uncreated,beginning-less,…etc)</em>, these identical attributes make Ishwar comparable and co-equal to the other 2 entities, which is violation of monotheism, and disqualifies protestant Hinduism from the claim of being Monotheistic.</span><br />
<strong>Identical</strong> attributes prove that Ishwar is identical to and resembles somewhat to Human Souls <em>(Ātmā)</em>and prakriti <em>(Primordial Matter)</em>, to some extent.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><strong>b.2.2) Is Ishwar Coequal –</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">According to Moolshankar&#8217;s <em>(Dayānanda Saraswati)</em> belief, Ishwar is not coequal as stated by him in Satyarth Prakash- </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">   &#8220;<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>There is none beside, Thee, who is equal</strong></span> to Thee or above Thee.&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">                                          – [Satyarth Prakash, Ch.1 pg. 35Tr.Chiranjiva Bhardawaja]</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><span style="color:black;">&#8220;The Great Eternal Spirit undergoes no modifications, requires no instruments to work with, <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>has <span style="color:red;">no equal<span style="color:black;"> nor any superior</span></span></strong></span>. He is the Supremely Powerful Being, endowed with innate Omniscience, Omnipresence and Infinite activity.&#8221; SHWETA SHWETAR UPANISHAD 6, 8.&#8221;                              &#8211; [</span>Satyarth Prakash, Ch.1 pg. 218 ,Tr.Chiranjiva Bhardawaja]</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Although, Moolshankar <em>(Dayānanda Saraswati)</em> seems to be zealously ascribing non-coequality to his Ishwar, the reality of the matter is totally different which we want to shed light upon. So does Ishwar have someone equal to him or equal to him in anything? Yes, of course he is <em>(coequal)</em> as proven above <em>(earlier-subsection)</em>, Ishwar is coequal to Human Souls <em>(Ātmā)</em> and prakriti <em>(Primordial Matter)</em>.Ishwar is coequal as he has <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>identical </strong>attributes which make him coequal in </span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><em>1)</em>      <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Eternity</em></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><em>2)</em>      <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Uncreated-ness</em></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><em>3)</em>      <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Beginning-less-ness.</em></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">As all the 3 entities are eternal, uncreated and beginning-less. Hence Ishwar is coequal undoubtedly. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Also Ishwar is co-equal in Consciousness, virtue, purity with Human Souls <em>(Ātm</em></span><em>ā<span style="text-decoration:underline;">)</span></em> as these are <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>identical attributes</strong> shared by the two, as stated by Moolshankar</span>. Not only is Ishwar Co-equal in eternity with the above stated entities but also with other as stated by Moolshankar –</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">&#8220;…<span style="color:black;text-decoration:underline;"><strong>the prakriti, the souls, time and space which are all uncreated and eternal.&#8221;</strong></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">                                                                           – [Satyarth Prakash , Ch 8, pg 253, Tr.Chirajiva Bhardawaja]</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"> Earlier, we&#8217;ve stated the major 3 eternal entities but there are few other entities which are eternal and Uncreated according to Moolshankar Tiwāri <em>(Dayānanda Saraswati)</em> they are <strong>time</strong> and <strong>space</strong>. So it&#8217;s perfectly fine to say that, Ishwar is Coequal in <strong><em>Eternity</em></strong> and <strong><em>Uncreated-ness</em></strong> not only with Human Souls <em>(Ātmā)</em>and prakriti <em>(Primordial Matter)</em> but also with <strong>time</strong> and <strong>space</strong>.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Apart from these proofs there are other proofs which we want to put light upon which will explicitly and evidently prove that Ishwar is coequal to Human Souls <em>(Ātmā)</em>and prakriti <em>(Primordial Matter)</em>…etc</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Protestant Hindu theology, states that the number of cause of this universe are as follows –</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;text-decoration:underline;"><strong>5. How many causes are there of the Universe</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:black;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><strong>A.-<span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;">Three </span></strong><span style="color:black;">&#8211; <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">The efficient , the material and the common</span>. </strong>The <strong>efficient cause </strong>is the one by whose directed activity a thing is made, and by the absence of whose directed activity nothing is made. It does not change itself, though it works changes in other things. The <strong>material cause </strong>is one without which nothing can be made. It undergoes changes, is made and un-made. The <strong>common cause </strong>is one that is an instrument in the making of a thing, and is common to many things. The <strong>efficient cause </strong>is of two kinds:- <span style="text-decoration:underline;">The <strong>Primary efficient cause </strong>is the Supreme Spirit – the Governor </span></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Of all, Who creates the universe out of the prakriti (matter), sustains it, and then resolves it into its elementary form. </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;text-decoration:underline;">The <strong>secondary efficient cause </strong>is the soul. It takes different materials out of the universe created by God and moulds them into different shapes. </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">The <strong>material cause </strong>is the prakiti which is the material used in the making of the universe. Being devoid of intelligence it can neither make nor unmake itself, but is always mad or unmade by a conscious intelligent being; though here and there even one kind of dead matter (but those changes are never ordered). Let us take an illustration. God made seeds (of different kinds), when they fall into a suitable soil and get the proper amount of water and nourishment, they develop into trees; but if they come in contact with fire they perish. All ordered changes in material things depend for their occurrence on God and the soul. </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;text-decoration:underline;"><strong>All such means as knowledge, strength and hands, and instruments, time and space, that are required for the making of thing constitute its common cause. </strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Now take for illustration a pot. The potter is its efficient cause clay its material cause, whilst the rod, the wheel and other instruments, time, space, light, eyes, hands (of the potter), knowledge and the necessary labour, etc., constitute its common cause. <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Nothing can be made or unmade without these three causes.</strong></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Moolshankar <em>(Dayānanda Saraswati) wrote in his <strong>&#8216;Bible of Hate&#8217; </strong>(i.e Satyarth Prakāsh)</em> that the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Universe has 3 Causes</span>, and without which the existence of Universe is impossible, these three causes are –</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><strong>1)</strong> The <strong><em>Efficient Cause</em></strong>: <em>(it has two types)</em></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><strong>a)</strong><br />
<em><strong>Primary Efficient Cause </strong>(Ishwar –protestant Hindu god).</em></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><strong>b)</strong><br />
<strong><em>Secondary Efficient Cause</em></strong><br />
<em>(Ātmā – Human Souls).</em></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><strong>2)</strong> The <strong><em>Material Cause</em></strong><br />
<em>(Prakriti – Primordial Matter).</em></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><strong>3)</strong> The <strong><em>Common Cause</em></strong><br />
<em>(&#8216;<span style="color:black;"><strong>common cause </strong>is one that is an instrument in the making of a thing&#8217; for instance knowledge, strength, hands, instruments, time and space).</span></em></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Earlier we proved that Ishwar is not a <em>&#8220;Creator&#8221;</em> but he is only a <em>&#8220;Maker&#8221; &#8220;Engineer&#8221;</em>…etc but this is the partial truth Ishwar isn&#8217;t the <strong><em>&#8220;Maker&#8221;</em></strong> or <strong><em>&#8220;Engineer&#8221;</em></strong> of the universe in complete sense he is just a <em>&#8220;part&#8221;</em> or one of the causes which <em>&#8220;engineer&#8221;</em> or <em>&#8220;make&#8221;</em> the universe and his other partners are listed above. This again evidently proves that Ishwar is coequal with –</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

<ul>
<li>

</span></div>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Ishwar has equal partners <em>(entities)</em>, which assisted him in <em>&#8216;managing&#8217;</em> and <em>&#8216;engineering&#8217;</em> of the universe <em>(who are equally important in engineering of the universe)</em>, which ultimately makes these entities as <strong><em>&#8216;Coequal&#8217;</em></strong> to Ishwar as without these the bringing about of universe is impossible. Hence these coequal causes of the universe are coequal to Ishwar. Later on Moolshankar states that the making of universe requires 6 Causes!</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Now mark how the descriptions of the six shaastraas harmonize with each other. </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:black;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">• The Mimaansaa says, &#8220;Nothing in this world can be produced without proper <span style="color:red;"><strong>application</strong><span style="color:black;">.&#8221; </span></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">• The Niyaaya says, &#8220;Nothing can be produced without the <span style="color:red;"><strong>material cause</strong></span>.&#8221; </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">• TheVaisheshika says, &#8220;Nothing can be done or made without the expenditure of <span style="color:red;"><strong>time</strong></span>.&#8221; </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">• The Yoga says, &#8220;Nothing can be made without the <span style="color:red;"><strong>requisite skill, knowledge and thought.</strong></span>&#8221; </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">• The Saankhya says, &#8220;Nothing can be made without the definite <span style="color:red;"><strong>combination of atoms</strong></span>.&#8221; </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">                  • The Vedaanta says, &#8220;Nothing can be made without a<strong><br />
<span style="color:red;">Maker</span></strong>.&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>This shows that the Creation of the world requires six different causes which have been described separately one by each separate Shaastra. There is no contradiction in these descriptions. The</strong> six Shaastras together serve to explain the phenomenon of Creation in the <strong>same way as six men would<span style="color:red;"> help<span style="color:black;"> each other</span></span></strong> to put a thatch on the roof of a house</span>.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">                                                                – [Satyarth Prakash, Ch 8, pg.260, Tr. Chiranjiva Bhardawaja]</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Above Moolshankar<em>(Dayānanda Saraswati)</em>, states that the so-called <em>&#8220;Creation&#8221;</em> of universe, requires 6 different Causes they are – application, material cause, time ,skill<em>(with knowledge and thought)</em>,  Combination of atoms and Maker.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Basically these are the same three causes which according to Moolshankar brought about the universe, except that here he <em>(Moolshankar)</em> expands the three causes to 6, but we think it&#8217;s quite incoherent to do so, as &#8220;<span style="color:red;"><strong>combination of atoms</strong></span>&#8221; come under material Cause<em>(atoms)</em> and Common Cause <em>(combining – application of atoms) </em>and &#8220;<span style="color:red;"><strong>requisite skill, knowledge and thought.&#8221;</strong></span> Also come under Common cause so does<strong><span style="color:red;"> &#8220;application&#8221;</span>, </strong>and the other 2 causes are clearly same<em>(Maker=Ishwar,Material, Cause=prakriti.</em>Hence it&#8217;s quite incoherent of Moolshankar to first propose 3 causes of the world then to make them 6.We also read Moolshankar stating that the so-called &#8220;Creation&#8221; of the Universe with six causes is just like six men who <strong>HELP </strong><em>(again Moolshankar himself implies that Ishwar needs help of other 5 causes, hence Ishwar is not Omnipresent even according to the proposed definition)</em>each other in putting a thatch on the roof of the house.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">The problem arises from the necessity of at least 3 causes of the Universe which necessitates that Ishwar is Co-equal. As it could be questioned <em>&#8220;Can the making, engineering of Universe be brought about without the material cause or by Ishwar alone&#8221;? </em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Of Course not, this evidently equates Ishwar <em>(Primary Efficient Cause)</em> and other causes as they all are equally important for the engineering of Universe. Hence this proves Ishwar<em>(Primary Efficient Cause)</em> to be Co-equal in work of engineering or making the Universe, with other Causes.</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Lastly, what we&#8217;ve discovered is that according to protestant Hindu theology Ishwar is coequal in Eternity, Uncreated-ness , Beginning-less with <strong>Ātmā </strong><em>(Human Souls) , </em><strong>Prakriti</strong><em>(Primordial matter), </em>also he<em>(Ishwar)</em> is co-equal with time and space in terms of uncreated-ness and eternity. Ishwar <em>(in terms of engineering the universe)</em> also is co-equal with all the causes which bring about the Universe, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">he <em>(Ishwar)</em> may not be totally/Completely equal to his counterparts <em>(Ātm</em></span><em>ā<span style="text-decoration:underline;"> ,Prakriti,time, space…etc)</span></em> but he indeed is equal to them in man<span style="text-decoration:underline;">y terms as proven above.</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Earlier we had presented a verse from the Noble, Holy Qur&#8217;ān [<strong>&#8220;<span style="text-decoration:underline;">There is nothing like Him(Allāh)</span>&#8220;</strong>] which should have made the Islāmic stance very clear with regard to <strong><em>&#8216;Incomparability&#8217;</em></strong> and <strong><em>&#8216;Coequality&#8217;</em>  </strong>but we would like to present another proof which may annihilate any doubt persisting in the minds of our readers. Allāh the Most-Merciful says which means –</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">This Soorah <em>(Chapter)</em> of the Noble, Holy Qur&#8217;ān is known as <span style="color:black;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong><em>at-Tawheed</em></strong></span><br />
<em>(The Oneness of All</em></span><em>āh, His Attributes and Names, – Belief in Absolute Monotheism)</em>, which shows how important it&#8217;s for every monotheist to believe in the <strong><em>&#8216;Incomparability&#8217; </em></strong>and<strong> &#8216;<em>non- Coequality&#8217;</em><br />
</strong>of God.  The famous exegete <span style="color:black;">al-Im</span>ā<span style="color:black;">m, <span style="color:blue;">Imad Ad-Din Isma&#8217;il bin &#8216;Umar bin Kathir<span style="color:black;"> wrote in his Commentary </span><em>Tafsir al-Qur&#8217;ān al-&#8216;Adhim</em></span> commenting on this verse–</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">&#8220;<span style="color:black;">So how can He</span><em>(Allāh)</em><span style="color:black;"> have a peer among His creatures who can be equal to Him, or a relative who can resemble Him Glorified, Exalted and far removed is Allah from such a thing.&#8221;</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">And <span style="color:blue;">Ibn Abi Hātim</span> and <span style="color:blue;">At-Tirmidhî</span> recorded –</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">&#8220;This <em>(Verse)</em> means there is none similar to Him<em> (Allāh)</em>, none equal to Him and there is nothing at all like Him&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">And Ash-Shaykh <span style="color:blue;">&#8216;Abdur-Rahmān ibn Nāsir as-Sa&#8217;dî</span>wrote in <em>&#8216;Tayseer al-Karim-ur-Rahmān Fe Tafseer Kalām Al-Mannān&#8217;</em>–</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">&#8220;There is nothing like Him<em> (Allāh)</em>, in His Names, His Attributes His actions, Blessed and Exalted is He&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">We hope this concise, presentation of Islāmic stance on the issue we are dealing with should quench the thirst of knowledge seekers for now and clear doubts. We learn that Islām calls people to a pure Monotheistic; complete way of life, unlike other &#8216;religions&#8217; which lead them into a pit of darkness. Also we learn how stringently and absolutely Islām is Monotheitic and that protestant Hinduism no where near it. The above verse is explicit and needs not explanation at all; we think this should make the Islāmic point of view evident and clear any misconception of Truth-seekers or our readers, if there.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Does, Ishwar &#8216;steal&#8217;? Or is &#8216;stealing&#8217; one of the characteristics of Ishwar? This is an important issue as this will help our truth-seekers see the reality without any mist or fog, people may have seen numerous of concted claims which aim to debase the Most-High , Most-Merciful Allāh Azz wa Jall by protestant Hindus, in fact their articles are filled with insults directly or indirectly , but our aim here is not to debase or insult anyone <span style="text-decoration:underline;">as this is not from our manners,</span> but our aim is just to bring out the TRUTH, so that people may be guided and made aware of certain facts.So is Ishwar a stealer?</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Well, let Yajurveda answer it, this Veda mentions the following verses- </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">&#8220;Mighty God, through the veda, singing Thy praise, I pray unto Thee. The sacrificer through oblations and praises hankers after Thee. O God worshipped by many, never disrespected, give us in this world your knowledge. <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong><span style="color:red;">Steal </span>not our life</strong>.</span>&#8220;</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">                                                                  – [Yajurveda Chapter 18, Verse 49, pg-198-99 Tr. Devi Chand]</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">&#8220;O Worshipful God, with my prayer, I attain unto Thee through vedic knowledge. A worshipper longs to realise Thee with his oblations. O praiseworthy God, worthy of respect, give us Thy knowledge in this world, <strong><span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;">steal</span><span style="text-decoration:underline;"> not our life from us</span>.&#8221;</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">We hope the above mentioned verses establish the fact, that according to the Vedas Ishwar is considered as an <strong><em>&#8216;Stealer&#8217; </em></strong>who steals away the life of humans, isn&#8217;t it amazing how Ishwar label&#8217;s himself <em>(according to protestant hindus , Ishwar revelead Vedas)</em><br />
<em>&#8220;Stealer&#8221;</em>. We wonder, what&#8217;s the use of such useless and insulting attribute to be applied to God. Again, human attributes <em>(characterstics)</em> that too negative characterstics are applied to God the Almighty, such an insult of God was never expected from theist, forget those claiming to be monotheists. Vedas are clear here <em>(these are words of Vedas not ours)</em>, that Ishwar is a stealer we need not write more, it is enough for those who truly seek truth. </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Have you ever heard that humans can unite with God! Well if not then we welcome you all to learn how to have a union with God as per Moolshankar and his cult.According to Moolshankar humans can unite with God by performing <em>(practicing) <strong>&#8216;<span style="color:black;">Sandhyaopaasanaa&#8217;</span></strong></em>specifically speaking by doing<span style="color:black;"><strong> &#8216;Upaasanaa&#8217;</strong> – Communion.</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">&#8220;The word <strong>upaasanaa </strong>literally means to come close to. All that is required in order to come close to God by the practice of the the Octapartite (eight parts or stages) yoga and directly see the Omnipresent, Omniscient God should be accomplished.&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">By doing <span style="color:black;"><strong>&#8216;Upaasanaa&#8217;</strong>, a man can be united with God!

</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:black;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">&#8220;When a man desires to engage in <strong>Upaasanaa </strong>(communion), let him resort to a solitary, clean place and get comfortably seated, practise <strong>Praanaayaama </strong>(control of breath) reatrain the senses from the pursuit of outward objects, <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>fix his mind on <span style="color:red;">one<span style="color:black;"> of the following places</span></span></strong></span>:- <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>the navel, the heart, the throat, eyes, the top of the head or the spine.</em></span> Let him, then, discriminate between his own soul and the Supreme Spirit, get absorbed in contemplation of the latter and commune with Him. When a man follows these practices his mind as well as the soul becomes pure and imbued with righteousness. <span style="color:red;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>His knowledge and wisdom advance day by day till he obtains salvation.</strong></span><span style="color:black;"><br />
<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>He who contemplated the Deity in this way for even one hour out of the twenty-four hours always continues to advance spiritually.&#8221;</strong></span></span></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Above we&#8217;ve seen how to perform communion with God <em>(Ishwar)</em> as per Moolshankar, but did anyone notice something fishy? Yes, we did.One of the benefits of <span style="color:black;"><strong>&#8216;Upaasanaa&#8217; or Communion </strong>with Ishwar is that people performing this communion advance in <strong><em>&#8216;Wisdom&#8217;</em></strong> and <strong><em>&#8216;Knowledge&#8217;</em></strong>!! Reading this we were intimidated to question, so if <strong>&#8216;Upaasanaa&#8217;</strong> can advance people in <strong><em>&#8216;Wisdom&#8217;</em></strong> and <strong><em>&#8216;Knowledge&#8217;</em></strong> as per claims, so can upaasanaa increase the knowledge of people without studying? It&#8217;s for first time; we&#8217;ve heard that just by breathing in and out while concentrating on one of yours of body part like navel you&#8217;ll advance in <strong><em>&#8216;Knowledge&#8217;</em></strong>! <span style="text-decoration:underline;">So will a student appearing for matriculation <em>(10<sup>th</sup>)</em> without studying anything and just by doing upaasanaa pass with the finest marks<em> (first rank)</em>? </span></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Not only this but people attain <strong><em>superhuman psychic power</em></strong> and <strong><em>absolute knowledge</em></strong><br />
<em>(Moolshankar advances his stance from <strong>&#8216;advance in knowledge&#8217;</strong> to <strong>&#8216;absolute knowledge&#8217;</strong>)</em> by doing upaasanaa as stated by Moolshankar – </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">&#8220;The great sage Vyasa holds that when a man attains a beatified state in this life by virtue of <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>direct communion with God and acquisition of superhuman psychic powers and absolute knowledge</strong></span>, he recovers his original pure self and enjoys extreme bliss.&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"> <span style="color:black;">We wonder, if people had just started performing upaasanaa and had not studied, would we humans have reached this stage of scientific development.</span><br />
<span style="color:black;">Obviously, the answer is no, upaasanaa in no way increases a person&#8217;s knowledge as knowledge can only be acquired by study and not just concentrating at your navel or head..Etc! In addition, we think no rational person can believe that just by doing upaasanaa one can attain <strong><em>&#8216;absolute knowledge&#8217; </em></strong>or <strong><em>&#8216;</em></strong></span><strong><em>superhuman psychic powers&#8217;</em></strong>. In fact humans cannot have<strong><br />
<span style="color:black;"><em>&#8216;absolute knowledge&#8217;</em></span></strong> as perfectly complete knowledge is of God and none other. Humans attaining <span style="color:black;"><strong><em>&#8216;absolute knowledge&#8217;</em><br />
</strong>or perfect/ complete knowledge is impossible as this is attributed to God exclusively as God by nature and definition has perfectly complete or absolute knowledge, hence stating that God and humans both have absolute knowledge is equaling God and humans which is polytheism showing anthropomorphic tendencies .  </span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">We hope that this method of increasing or advancing knowledge isn&#8217;t prescribed to scienctist, researcher…etc especially that of our country as we love our country and would love to see it at the pinnacle of scientific developments which is not possible via performing upaasanaa. Here are few verses from Vedas which proudly state this pagan concept.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><strong>Attain to Godhead through Upaasanaa – </strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">The above verse states how one can attain to Godhead! And that is by upaasanaa.There are more such polytheistic verses in the polytheistic Vedas which teach such utter pagan polytheism which is vulgar to monotheists.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">How does being united with God sound to a monotheist? Well, obscenely insulting to God! We as monotheist would like to reprimand and disparage this polytheistic concept where man and God are said to be united! This is polytheism par excellence. Associating man with God is such a filthy idea, but our protestant Hindu brothers/sisters here are not only associating but also uniting him with man.!! Communion and unification of God with man, isn&#8217;t an allegation but an insult to God which no monotheist will ever tolerate, nor do we, hence we ask protestant Hindus to correct their deviated beliefs and seek truth that they may be guided.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Above we read Moolshankar, propogating the pagan polytheistic concept of communion or unification with Ishwar. Look at this hypocritical double-standard nature of protestant Hindus, where accuse orthodox <em>(mainstream)</em> Hindus of polytheism and on the other side themselves are immersed in pure polytheism.This communion where Ishwar and human soul become <strong><em>&#8216;One&#8217;</em></strong> or <strong><em>&#8216;unified&#8217;</em></strong> is pathetic and irrational.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><span style="color:black;">Let us show our readers the incoherency of protestant Hindu theology – according to protestant Hindu theology, <strong>Ishwar is <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>&#8216;inseparably one&#8217;</em></span><br />
</strong>with thefollowing <em>[see the sub-section (</em></span><em>b.3) for the reference and more on the topic]</em><span style="color:black;"> : </span><strong>Ātmā </strong><em>(Human Souls) , </em><strong>Prakriti</strong><em>(Primordial matter)</em><strong>.</strong> If Ishwar is already<em> (inherently)</em> &#8216;<span style="color:black;"><strong><em>&#8216;inseparably one&#8217;</em></strong> with </span>Ātmā, prakriti …etc then what&#8217;s the use of upasanaa? According to protestant Hindu Ishwar is omnipresent, he pervades everything that exists, hence is <em>&#8216;inseparably one&#8217;</em> with everything that exists.So if Ishwar is already united with everything then what&#8217;s the use of Upaasanaa, in any sense? Mooshankar states upaasanaa helps us <strong>&#8216;come<span style="color:black;"> close to God&#8217;</span></strong>.But the rational question is if Ishwar is already pervading everything including humans then why is upasanaa needed, because when both Ishwar and human souls are <span style="color:black;"><strong><em>&#8216;inseparably one&#8217;</em></strong> and <strong><em>&#8216;close&#8217;</em></strong> to each other upaasanaa is useless?</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"> <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Claiming that Ishwar is <strong><em>&#8216;inseparably one&#8217;</em></strong> with everything but still far and away from everything is like stating 1+1 = 2 at first , then claiming 1+1 = 1; is this rational?</span> Only one of the two statements can be true. Either Ishwar pervades everything hence necessarily he is <strong><em>&#8216;inseparably one&#8217;</em></strong> which make them one and there is no more closeness than being <strong><em>&#8216;one&#8217;</em></strong>. Or Ishwar and other entities aren&#8217;t <strong><em>&#8216;inseparably one&#8217;</em></strong> and are not <strong><em>close</em></strong> to each other.Claiming that both the statements are true is logical fallacy and incoherency of protestant Hindu theology.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">And here&#8217;s the logical fallacy found in the Vedas – </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>&#8220;God moves in the eyes of fools.</strong></span> He is motionless. <strong>He is <span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;">far distant</span> from the irreligious and ignorant</strong>, and near the yogis. <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">He is within this entire universe, and surrounds it externally.</span>&#8220;</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>

</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">The above statement shows the logical incoherency of Vedas and protestant Hindu thelogy, the verse firstly states that God moves in the eyes of the fools, this proves he is near them then goes on to state that God is far distant from the irereligious and ignorant then further states that he is within the entire universe and surrounds it externally.!!What a show of illogicalness, if God <em>(Ishwar) </em>is within entire universe and surrounds it then how can he be <strong><em>&#8216;far distant&#8217;</em></strong> from the irreligious? This is explicitly contradictory as Ishwar due to his omnipresence cannot in any sense be <strong><em>&#8216;far distant&#8217; </em></strong>from anyone his omnipresence necessitate his being <strong><em>&#8216;inseparably one&#8217; </em></strong>and <strong><em>close </em></strong>with everything that exist.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Finally, this concept of <strong><em>&#8216;unification&#8217;</em></strong> or <strong><em>&#8216;communion&#8217;</em></strong> is polytheistic and cannot be fathomed by a rational mind as this is against the general percepts of rationality and logicality. Also this concept preaches polytheism in the vilest form, this <strong><em>&#8216;unification&#8217;</em></strong> or <strong><em>&#8216;communion&#8217;</em><br />
</strong>is nothing but labeled as Shirk <em>[associationism- setting up partners or associating false gods with Allāh(ta&#8217;āla…etc), please refer to Islāmic texts for the complete meaning of Shirk]</em>in Islām and this shirk necessitates <em>(leads) </em>a person to be a polytheist.We think we have amply provided our readers with evidences proving protestant Hinduism to be polytheistic but here&#8217;s the clincher with which we intend to conclude this section(b.2.4).Protestant Hindu pandit Vishnu Lāl wrote –</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">As we&#8217;ve stated, attributes or characterstics of God are the crux of any theology and people have erred a lot, and few of those who erred are the <strong><em>&#8216;Guru and Chela&#8217;</em></strong><br />
<em>[Moolshankar and Agniveer]</em>. Agniveer exposes his illiteracy in Islām and not only in Islām but also contradicts Moolshankar, did agniveer really read the <em>&#8216;Bible of Hate&#8217; (Satyarth Prakāsh</em>)? Seemingly Agniveer never read the complete Satyarth Prakāsh or why would he contradict Moolshankar.Agniveer commented/wrote in his article<em> (This article of agniveer exposes the novice nature of Agniveer in comparative religion and his total ignorance of Islām, we&#8217;ve would have with pleasure refuted his ignorant and illiterate allegations but this would disturb the flow of this article hence we will prevent ourself from doing so, Inshā&#8217;Allāh his baseless allegations will be refuted soon.)</em> – </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">   <strong>&#8220;<span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;">Sharing attributes</span> with Allah is nothing but <span style="color:red;">Shirk</span>&#8220;</strong> &#8211;</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Though Agniveer does not understand the concept of Shirk, but here he does contradict his own creed by stating that <strong><em>&#8216;Sharing attributes with Allāh&#8217; </em></strong>is <em><strong>&#8216;Shirk&#8217; </strong>(please refer to authentic Islāmic texst for the complete and correct understanding and meaning of Shirk) </em>by which he means<strong><br />
<span style="color:red;">polytheism</span></strong>. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Hence agniveer states that if God shares any of his attributes with humans then that is gross polytheism.</span>But what does Moolshankar state, and is Agniveer a polytheist according to his own words? <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Let us display, how Agniveer clearly states protestant Hinduism to be polytheistic</span>.Moolshankar wrote – </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">31. <strong>God and the soul possess the attributes of Existence, Consciousness and Blissfulness common to each other and are therefore, one. Why do you then refute this belief?</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:black;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">A.-<span style="color:red;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>The fact of two things possessing a few attributes common to each other does not make them one.</strong></span><span style="color:black;">Take for instance, solids and liquids and fire, all these are inanimate and visible but that does not make them one. <strong>The dissimilar attributes differentiate them</strong>. The hardness and prevent them from being considered as one. Or take another illustration. Both a man and an ant see with their eyes, eat with their mouths and walk with their feet, yet they are not one and the same, having their bodily forms different from each other, a man having two feet whilst an ant many, and so on.</span></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Now coming to the, the confession of Agniveer that protestant Hinduism is polytheistic, according to Agniveer sharing common attributes is polytheism. We think we&#8217;ve shown a lot of common attributes between Ishwar, Ātmā <em>(Human Souls)</em> and Prakriti <em>(Primordial matter),</em> for instance all of them have share identical attributes namely,<strong> Eternal, uncreated, beginning-less</strong> hence according to Agniveer himself, protestant Hindus are polytheist! But amazingly Agniveer conflicts Moolshankar by stating that <strong><em>&#8216;sharing attributes&#8217;</em></strong> means polytheism.Hence Agniveer himself accepts that he is a polytheist <em>(if he believes in protestant Hinduism)</em>.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Now let us come to our stance – we shall make our stance crystal clear; the correct rational belief is thus:</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">·         <span style="text-decoration:underline;">&#8216;Attributing attributes/characterstics <strong><span style="color:red;">identical</span><br />
</strong>to that of human, animal…etc <em>(attributes of creation, or anything unworthy)</em> to God is <strong>polytheism</strong>&#8216;.&#8217;God and humans…etc <em>(creation) </em>cannot have <strong>COMMON</strong><em> (identical)</em> attributes, having common<em> (identical)</em> attributes is pure <strong>polytheism</strong>&#8216;</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">For instance Ishwar has both<strong> identical</strong> and <strong>common</strong><em> (common attributes usually mean identical to some one&#8217;s hence they are called common)</em> attributes to that of Ātmā <em>(Human Souls)</em> and Prakriti <em>(Primordial matter)</em>, namely all share or have attributes eternal, uncreated, and beginning-less, these three attributes are not only identical but also common.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Let us make one thing crystal clear, there is a huge difference between IDENTICAL and SIMILAR <em>(in name only)</em> attributes, God and humans may have attributes similar <em>(in name only)</em> for instance both God and humans have a similar attribute <em>(in name only)</em> called <strong><em>&#8216;existence&#8217;</em></strong>. Both God and humans <strong><em>&#8216;exist&#8217;.</em><br />
<span style="text-decoration:underline;">But the modality of existence of God is <em>unknown</em>, his existence befits his Majesty and Might and is not like our existence</span>, only the name of the attribute is similar. </strong>For example, we all have heard the famous electronic cum computer manufacturing company <strong><em>&#8216;Apple&#8217;</em></strong> so is this <strong><em>&#8216;Apple&#8217;</em></strong> company similar to an <strong><em>&#8216;Apple&#8217;</em></strong><br />
<em>(fruit)</em>? Of course not, only the name is similar. Or is the famous software company <strong><em>&#8216;Oracle&#8217;</em></strong> same to an <em><strong>&#8216;Oracle&#8217;</strong> (an authoritative person who divines the future,a shrine where an oracular god is consulted)? </em>Of course not, they only have similar name and nothing else, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">so the modality of existence of God is unknown and his existence has no comparison/resemblance nor is similar to anything</span> , we hope our readers and truth-seeker&#8217;s remember the sublime, glorious verse from the noble qur&#8217;an which we quoted earlier – </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:purple;font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><strong>                                         &#8220;<span style="text-decoration:underline;">There is nothing like Him(</span>Allāh)&#8221;</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Any attribute of God cannot be identical to that of any creature nor does God have common attributes with his creature, though he may have attributes with similar name.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Does similarity in attribute name necessitate God and man to be similar?</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Though the question is inherently ridiculously hilarious, as it is well established that similarity in names does not necessitate that God and humans are similar.Nonetheless we&#8217;ll be delving into such ridiculous question in order to make this matter clear for our readers.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Similarity in name <em>(of attributes)</em> in no sense necessitates, that God is similar to the one who&#8217;s name <em>(of attribute)</em> is similar.As the name of attribute of God is Perfect <em>[as God Himself is All-Perfect, also its (name of attribute) divinely revealed and is eternal]</em> where as the name <em>(of attribute)</em> of human…etc<em> [who&#8217;s name (of attribute) is similar]</em> are created not perfect nor are divinely revealed or eternal. Hence God has no resemblance whatsoever with his creature in anything, nor resemblance with any attributes of any creature.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">There are many such rationally proved reasons which prove that similarity in name of attributes does not make two things similar, but we&#8217;ve restricted ourself as this topic is out of the scope, of this article.We hope the matter is clear. We would have written more for the benefit of our readers but this would disturb the flow of our article ,also this topic is out of scope of this article as stated earlier, Inshā&#8217;Allāh we&#8217;ll someday write on this subject too, as time permits us.We&#8217;ve read Agniveer admitting protestant Hinduism being polytheistic; also he contradicts his <strong><em>&#8216;Idol&#8217;</em></strong> named Moolshankar. All these things should be enough for a sincere truth-seeker.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><strong>b.3) <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Protestant Hindu Trinity [<span style="color:red;">Vedic Trinity</span>]</span> –</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><span style="color:black;">As we have seen, that the protestant Hindus <span style="text-decoration:underline;">basically</span> believe in 3 uncreated, eternal, beginning-less, non-destructible entities they are – <strong>Param</strong></span><strong>ā<span style="color:black;">tm</span>ā<span style="color:black;">, Prakriti, </span>Ātmā<span style="color:black;">.</span></strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">And these three are also very important in <em>&#8216;engineering&#8217;</em> or <em>&#8216;making&#8217;</em> the universe as Ishwar<em>(<span style="color:black;">Param</span>ā<span style="color:black;">tm</span>ā<span style="color:black;">)</span></em><br />
<span style="color:black;">is the <strong><em>Primary Efficient Cause</em></strong> whereas Prakriti <em>(Primordial matter)</em> is the <strong><em>Material Cause</em></strong> and </span>Ātmā <em>(Human Souls)</em> is the <strong><em>Secondary Efficient Cause</em></strong>. And these three play an important role in protestant Hindu theology in factuality these are the major role players and everything in protestant Hindu theology revolves around these three entities, and we wonder how come these people label themselves as monotheists? The <strong>&#8216;protestant Hindu trinity&#8217;</strong>, just like everything in Christianity revolves around the Christian concept of trinity <em>(i.e. The Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost/Spirit) </em>everything in protestant Hindu theology revolves around these 3 entities which constitutes to the major part of their creed. The protestant Hindu trinity is made up of –</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">1)<strong> Paramātmā</strong><br />
<em>(Ishwar/God)</em></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">2)<strong> Prakriti</strong><br />
<em>(Primordial matter)</em></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">3)<strong> Ātmā</strong><br />
<em>(Human Souls)</em></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">The above three entities make up the <strong><em>&#8220;Trinitarian Doctrine&#8221;</em></strong> of protestant Hinduism, though not exactly identical to that of Christianity, nonetheless both share the confusing and irrational trinity in theology. According to protestant Hindus Ishwar is <strong><em>&#8220;Father&#8221;</em></strong> of all Humans and other creatures, as stated in Vedas – </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">We learn that Moolshankar<em> (Dayānanda Saraswati)</em> believed Ishwar to be the <strong>Father of all</strong>, and not only Father but <strong>&#8220;Father of Fathers&#8221;</strong> and also the <strong>&#8220;Great-Grandfather&#8221;</strong>. So we again see similarity between the protestant Hindu trinity and the Christian trinity. But does this end here? No not at all, another zealously fanatic protestant Hindu pandit states – </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">&#8220;We have heard it contended by Christian divines that the <span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;"><strong>fatherhood of God</strong></span> and the brotherhood, of man were first preached by Christ.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Amazingly, not only Ishwar is <strong><em>Father</em></strong>, but also the <strong><em>mother</em></strong> and also the <strong><em>Son</em></strong> ,now this really is interesting!  Ishwar seems to be really multi-faceted entity, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">its evident how protestant Hindus are trying hard to match-up with so-called Christian concepts of &#8216;peace&#8217; &#8216;Fatherhod&#8217; and &#8216;brotherhood&#8217;</span>. But in doing so they have erred gravely and exposed their incoherent <em>&#8216;conceptualization&#8217;</em> and understanding of God. </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">The problem with <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Christianity is their claim of God being 3 different entities still is 1</span>, it&#8217;s something similar to protestant Hindu theology, where the 3 entities are eternal, uncreated and beginning-less still only Ishwar has the right to be God or is known as God and the other 2<em>(entities i.e. Ātmā and Prakriti)</em> aren&#8217;t, while the other 2 entities have a large amount of action and role to play<em>(if not equal)</em> also Ishwar is totally dependent on these two for nearly everything right from engineering the universe to giving &#8216;bliss&#8217; to the human souls<em>(on Moksha)</em>. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">We read that Ishwar is – Father of Fathers, Great-Grandfather, Father, Mother and the Son<em> (a step ahead of Christian dogmas)</em></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">It would be a beneficial to note another important point which we&#8217;ve been stressing and proving since the beginning of this article cum treatise, is the anthropomorphic tendencies of protestant Hinduism, again here they expose how greatly they view God in human framework or conceptualize God in human-resembling manner. Above protestant Hindus are zealously eager to prove that their god Ishwar is the paragon of <strong><em>&#8220;Fatherhood&#8221;</em></strong> through which they aim to prove their god is loving like a <em>&#8220;Father&#8221;</em> and that this concept of <em>&#8220;Fatherly love&#8221; </em>was present in the Vedas even before the existence of Bible, but in doing so they follow the Christian and anthropomorphize God and resemble His relation with His creatures similar to that of Human bonds and relationship. What the protestant Hindus don&#8217;t realize, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">is that the relation of man and God is way too pure, spiritual and higher than that of man with his Father, mother or Son</span>. And it would be a great oppression against humanity, asceticism and spirituality on the part of protestant Hinduism to undermine and debase the pure relation of man with God by resembling and equaling it with human relationships. Concluding the paragraph, we learn that Ishwar is – The Father [<em>and relations like (Son, Mother, Great-grand Father), Humans have]</em> in the protestant Hindu trinity.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">In order to strengthen the proofs of our statements here&#8217;s some more evidences, where the relation between God and Humans is identified and resembled with that relationships between humans.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Above quoted statement <em>(pg.225)</em> of <em>&#8216;pandit&#8217;</em> Moolshankar <em>(Dayānanda Saraswati),</em> explicitly defines the relation between <strong>Ātmā</strong> (<em>Humans Souls)</em> and <strong>Ishwar </strong><em>(protestant Hindu god),</em> like that of the Father and the Son! Other instances of the relation between God and Soul provided by Mooshankar seem to be fine, like <em>&#8216;<span style="color:black;">the Ruler and the ruled&#8217;</span></em><br />
<span style="color:black;"><em>[God is the Ultimate Ruler and rules over everything]</em>, <em>&#8216;Master and the servant&#8217;</em>, &#8216;served and the servitor&#8217;, &#8216;the supporter and the supported&#8217;, all these instances are fine as they don&#8217;t debase the relationship of God to mere Human relations like that of the &#8216;Father and Son&#8217;. </span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><span style="color:black;">And in the quote from pg.<em> (205, above the quote of pg.225)</em> &#8216;pandit&#8217; Moolshankar </span><em>(Dayānanda Saraswati) </em>wrote <em>&#8220;</em><span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Let all men look up to me alone as children do to their parents&#8221;</strong></span> what more evidence would a unbiased person need to acknowledge the fact that protestant Hinduism debases and undermines the pure relation between God and man with that of <em>&#8216;Father/Mother and the Son&#8217;</em>. It&#8217;s to be noted that the relation between a mother and a son or the father and son is very important and high amongst humans, also should be respected highly but resembling the relation between God and humans to that of human bonds/relationships is a fatal error which would lead to the corruption and undermining spirituality.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">The trinitarian doctrine of protestant Hindus is confusing and incoherent to a rational mind; it is far removed from being anywhere near to rationality. Christians claims their &#8216;concept of triune&#8217; to be monotheistic so is the claim of protestant Hinduism with different variables and few constants. </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">In Christianity, the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit are 3 different/distinct entities, still they are not 3 Gods but they are 1 God. Something similar in essence is propounded by, Moolshankar<em> (Dayānanda Saraswati)</em> –</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:black;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">&#8220;<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>God and the soul are two <span style="color:red;">distinct<span style="color:black;"> entities</span></span></strong></span> by virtue of being different in nature and of being possessed of dissimilar attributes and characteristics. <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>They are, however, <span style="color:red;">inseparable one<span style="color:black;"> from the other,</span></span></strong></span> being related to each other as the <strong>pervader </strong>and the <strong>pervaded </strong>and have <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>certain attributes in common.</strong></span> Just as a material object has always been and shall always be, distinct from the space in which it exists and as the two have never been, <span style="color:red;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>nor shall ever be one and the same<span style="color:black;">, even so are God and the soul to each other.</span></strong></span> Their mutual relation is that of the pervader and the pervaded, of father and son and the like.</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><span style="color:black;">Also, Moolshankar</span><em> (Dayānanda Saraswati)</em><span style="color:black;">wrote,</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">&#8220;It is only because He is even more subtle than the soul and the prakriti, and pervades them, that He can grasp them and transform them into this visible universe.&#8221; </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>

</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><span style="color:black;">As can be read above, according to Moolshankar</span><em>(Dayānanda Saraswati)</em><span style="color:black;"> , Ishwar is the subtlest of the 3 entities and pervades all. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">All the 3 entities are distinct but still are inseparable</span>, seem to be using some sought of glue! As per protestant Hindu theology , the 3 eternal , uncreated, beginning-less entities <em>(i.e Ishwar,Prakriti and </em></span><em>Ātmā) </em>are distinct but are <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>&#8216;inseparable one&#8217;</strong></span>, which simply means and that they are –Ishwar, <span style="color:black;">Prakriti and </span>Ātma, <strong>&#8216;DISTINCT&#8217;</strong>  but are <strong>&#8216;NOT SEPRATE&#8217;</strong>. So what does this mean? Moolshankar is trying to teach us two things –</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:black;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><strong>1)</strong>      &#8220;<span style="text-decoration:underline;">They<em> [2 entities] </em>are, however<strong>, <span style="color:red;">inseparable one</span></strong><span style="color:black;">from the other<strong>&#8220;</strong></span></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:black;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><strong>2)</strong>     <strong>&#8220;</strong>Just as a material object has always been and shall always be, distinct from the space in which it exists and as the two have never been, <span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;"><strong>nor shall ever be one and the same<span style="color:black;">, even so are God and the soul to each other.&#8221;</span></strong></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><span style="color:black;">Moolshankar claims Ishwar <em>and </em></span>Ātmā to be <strong>&#8216;insperable one&#8217; </strong>but further goes on claiming that Ishwar and human souls (<em>Ātmā)</em> cannot become ONE and the same. What he&#8217;s trying to imply is that Ishwar and human souls (<em>Ātmā)</em> are distinct/different entities with few similar attributes that cannot be divided/parted/disjoined or separated, but they are not the same. </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><span style="color:black;">After reading the meanings, I guess the matter will be more clear, and our readers will understand, Moolshankar is trying to state that Ishwar is different not like Humans souls except few common attributes , but they are <strong><em>&#8216;inseparably one&#8217;</em><br />
</strong>meaning joined and cannot be divided , which ultimately leads us to the conclusion – <span style="text-decoration:underline;">They<em>[Ishwar,Prakriti,</em></span></span><em><span style="text-decoration:underline;"> Ātm</span>ā<span style="text-decoration:underline;">] </span></em>are one with many different attributes among which some are common and identical to all three<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>[ like earlier proved all three have identical eternity, uncreated-ness, beginning-less-ness<span style="color:black;">, commonly shared which make them co-equal in that attributes.]</span></em></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><span style="color:black;">This is something close and similar to the Christian concept of <strong>&#8216;triune&#8217;</strong>. 3 different entities but still One <em>(or 3 in 1)</em>, same here with a minor difference <em>&#8216;3 different&#8217;</em> entities<em> (as Ishwar pervades everything including Prakriti)</em> but are <strong>&#8216;<span style="text-decoration:underline;">inseparable one</span>&#8216;</strong> or <strong><em>joined/undivided</em></strong>. Irrational and illogical concept also very lowly to a mind of monotheist, who believes in perfect Uniqueness of God. This issue needs a detail exposure, but unfortunately presently it&#8217;s beyond the scope of the article, Insh</span>ā&#8217;Allāh, we&#8217;ll expound in it in greater detail later, as time permits, but briefly it&#8217;s a gross violation of Monotheism.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><span style="color:black;">The above belief is labeled as <strong><em>&#8220;Shirk&#8221;</em></strong> in Isl</span>ā<span style="color:black;">m or <strong><em>&#8220;Associationism&#8221;</em></strong>, above Moolshankar adamantly states God and humans souls to be &#8216;inseparable one&#8217; which is pure instance of polytheism. Here he adjoins and associates, Human Souls to God, which is superfluously polytheism. Such a belief can hardly be recognized as <em>&#8220;Monotheistic&#8221;</em>, in-fact this is more than polytheism it can be better labeled as <em>&#8220;Polytheism&#8221;.</em> It&#8217;s irrational even to think of such bizarre belief, where God is <strong>JOINED/ UNITED</strong> and cannot separate himself from other things.</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;text-decoration:underline;"><strong>We would, here like to shed light upon, the double-standards and hypocritical nature of protestant Hindus,</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><strong><span style="color:#ff9900;">Agniveer</span>,</strong> the Islāmophobe and hate-monger wrote – </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Not only this, <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Vedas also <span style="color:red;">refuse existence of any</span> angel or <span style="color:red;">Prophet or</span> incarnation who is necessarily required to act as an <span style="color:red;">agent</span> between You and Ishwar.</strong></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">To give a rough analogy:</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Ishwar of Vedas = God of Christianity minus the concept of Trinity minus the necessity to surrender to Jesus</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Ishwar of Vedas = Allah of Islam minus the necessity to accept Muhammad as final Prophet.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">In other words, If someone says first part of Shahada : <em>lâ ilâha illallâh</em> (There is no other God except one and only Allah) <span style="color:red;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>but rejects the second part</strong></span> : </span><em>Muhammadur rasûlullâh</em> (Muhammad is his messenger), that is close to concept of Vedic God.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;text-decoration:underline;"><strong>In Islam, it is <span style="color:red;">Shirk or greatest sin</span> to worship anything except Allah. If you take this concept further and also refuse to accept any Muhammad or Gabriel as necessary to be remembered apart from Allah, you are avoiding Shirk as per Vedas.</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Here we see ignorance of Agniveer at its best and his pathetically low level of Islāmic knowledge and understanding. It seems we need to give Agniveer, the hate-monger few baby lessons about Islām, so let&#8217;s start.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">The first, delusion we see is the claim that Vedas refuse to acknowledge any <em>&#8216;Prophet&#8217; </em>&#8220;who is necessarily required to act as an agent between You and Ishwar&#8221;. The thing that amazes us, the most, is this person&#8217;s confident lies <em>(though being white lies)</em> and misinterpretations of religious texts of Islām.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">It&#8217;s totally wrong, absurd and misleading that, Vedas don&#8217;t have <strong><em>&#8216;Agents&#8217;</em></strong>, to prove it let&#8217;s go to the inventor of this protestant Hindu cult, that&#8217;s Moolshankar and he wrote – </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">In addition, Durgā Prasād translates it as,</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><strong>Q. To whose mind and at what time did God reveal the Vedas ?</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><strong>A <span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;">&#8211;</span></strong> In the beginning of the creition God revealed a Veda to the soul of <span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;">each of the four sages, called Agni, Vayu, Adittya, and Angira…</span>God caused them communicated through Agni and others to the mind of Brahma. See what Manu says, I. 23,</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">In the beginning the Great God, having made men, blessed Brahma with the four Vedas through the four sages, called Agni and others Brahma received the Rig, Yajur, Sanaa and Atharva Vedas from Agni Vayu, Aditya, and Angira.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">                                 – [Satyrath Prakash Ch 7, pg.229 Tr. Durga Prasad]</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">What we have seen is that protestant Hindu god <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Ishwar revealed Vedas to <strong>four Rishis</strong></span><br />
<span style="text-decoration:underline;">and through them Brahma learnt these Vedas, so what does this mean</span>? It&#8217;s clear that here these <strong><em>&#8220;Rishis&#8221;</em></strong> are nothing but some sought of <strong><em>&#8216;Prophets&#8217; (or may be &#8216;Agents&#8217;)</em></strong>. And it&#8217;s amazing to see that Agniveer wrote – </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:black;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"> <span style="color:red;">&#8220;<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Vedas also refuse existence </strong></span>of any angel or <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Prophet</strong></span> or incarnation <span style="text-decoration:underline;">who is necessarily required to act as <strong>an agent between You and Ishwar</strong></span>.&#8221;</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">So again here Agniveer&#8217;s claim, of Vedas refusing to believe the existence of <em>&#8216;Prophets'(or so-called Agents)</em> is refuted by his own leader&#8217;s and his own belief <em>(we think he is a protestant Hindu isn&#8217;t he, hence blind-following of Moolshankar is obligatory on him isn&#8217;t it?Thats what they are taught!)</em>. The meaning of Rishis <em>(here -as used by Moolshankar)</em> is in fact is quite similar, to the notion of a Prophet and we also read above that<strong><em>&#8216;through the medium of the four Rishis&#8217;</em></strong> Brahma was instructed the knowledge of Vedas. So this simply proves how the four Rishis acted as <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>&#8216;Agents&#8217;</strong></span> between Brahma and Ishwar, and in fact all the others<em>( excluding the four Rishis) </em>learnt the knowledge of Vedas via these four Rishis , hence it&#8217;s evident that these Rishis are mere <strong><em>Agents</em></strong> between Ishwar and people. Somewhat <em>(to an extent)</em> similar to, the Prophets conveyed the message and knowledge of Divine Inspiration and revelation so did the rishis do.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Hence, the claim made by Agniveer, of Vedas refusing to accept an agent or prophet is contradictory to Agniveer&#8217;s own creed! We think it&#8217;s pretty much apparent that protestant Hindu&#8217;s have 4 agents from whom they understood Vedas. Now coming to a question of similar nature asked by the master<em> (swāmi)</em> of Agniveer – Moolshankar.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Moolshankar wrote – </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><strong>53. &#8220;Nor is God minded to lay open the secret thing to you but God chooseth what he will of his apostles to know them. Believe therefore, in God and his apostles.&#8221; (3:174) </strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">C. ~ <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Why does this verse inculcate faith in Mohammad along with that in God,</strong></span> when the Mohammedans process to believe in none but God, and hold that none is worthy of sharing homage with Him? Hence they cannot call God Incomparable. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">If it be argued that this verse only teaches that people should have faith in Mohammad as a Prophet, we should like to know where is the necessity of Mohammad (being regarded as a Prophet).</span> If God cannot accomplish His desired object without making him His Prophet, He is certainly powerless.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">                                                       &#8211; [Satyarth Prakash, Ch14, pg.673 Tr.Chiranjiva Bhardawaja]</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Well, we&#8217;ve proved, that Vedas have the concept of <em>&#8216;agents&#8217;</em> and something similar is being questioned by Moolshankar , but firstly its to be noted that Moolshankar has misquoted the Holy, Noble Qur&#8217;ān, here the Ayat quoted <em>(3:174)</em> by Moolshankar is provided , and it in no way matches with that of Moolshankar&#8217;s citation. Here&#8217;s the Ayat as per the reference provided by Moolshankar.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Right translation of interpretation of meaning of the Ayat reference provided –</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:purple;font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">&#8220;So, they returned with grace and bounty from Allāh. No harm touched them; and they followed the good Pleasure of Allāh. And Allāh is the Owner of Great Bounty.&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">                                                          -[ <span style="color:black;">Soorah Aal-&#8216;Imraan(3), Ayat 174]</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"> This is typical of protestant Hindus including the likes of Agniveer, who often misquote, misinterpret and provide unknown-faulty translation of Islāmic texts.Nonetheless, here we shall answer the silly objections raised by Moolshankar, despite of the fact that we do not have the correct reference, but have understood the basic objection. Moolshankar here is trying to question the belief in Prophets held by Muslims. So why do Muslims believe in Prophets<em> (&#8216;Alayhimus Salām)?</em> The questioned can be simply answered by another question. <em>&#8220;Why do protestant Hindus believe in the 4 rishis&#8221;,</em> why do they not reject these rishis? Of course, because it was to them, the Vedas were revealed as per protestant Hindu theology.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Now answering the question of Agniveer and Moolshankar which is better articulated by Agniveer, he wrote<em> (earlier full source is provided, see above) – </em></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">&#8220;Ishwar of Vedas = Allah of Islam minus the necessity to accept Muhammad as final Prophet.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">In other words, If someone says first part of Shahada : <em>lâ ilâha illallâh</em> (There is no other God except one and only Allah) <span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;"><strong>but rejects the second part</strong></span> : <em>Muhammadur rasûlullâh</em> (Muhammad is his messenger), that is close to concept of Vedic God.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>In Islam, it is <span style="color:red;">Shirk or greatest sin</span> to worship anything except Allah. If you take this concept further and <span style="color:red;">also refuse to accept any Muhammad or Gabriel </span>as necessary to be remembered apart from Allah, <span style="color:red;">you are avoiding Shirk as per Vedas</span>.</strong></span>&#8220;</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Let us teach Agniveer some basics of Islām, his illiteracy of Islām is apparent and is disgusting that such a person is criticising Islām, who does not even know nick about Islām. Nonetheless, let us educate him. Firstly, this illiterate does not even know what the shahādatayn<em> (loosely, &#8216;testimony of faith&#8217;)</em> means! Before going further let me provide our readers with correct meaning of <em>&#8216;Shirk&#8217;</em> in Islām, Agniveer clearly lack basic comprehension of Islām, hence has stated, &#8220;<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">In Islam, it is <span style="color:red;">Shirk or greatest sin</span></span>&#8220;. &#8216;Shirk&#8217;</strong> does not literally mean <strong>&#8220;Greatest Sin&#8221;</strong> as stated by Agniveer.<strong> &#8216;Shirk&#8217;</strong> to state in a very concise set of words <em>(loosely)</em>, means <span style="color:red;"><strong>&#8220;Assocationism&#8221;</strong></span> or <span style="color:red;"><strong><em>&#8220;Associating or setting up partners with All<span style="color:#ff6600;">ā<span style="color:red;">h&#8221;</span></span></em></strong> as done by protestant Hinduism. Hence, </span><strong><em>&#8216;Shirk&#8217;</em></strong> is an act that&#8217;s considered the evilest and greatest sin, which takes you out of the fold of Islām.<em>[Please refer to Islāmic texts to comprehend the correct meaning of Shirk , as explaining it in detail here is out of the scope of this article]</em></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"> Expounding on <strong>Shahādatayn</strong>, in brief (there could be volumes written) –</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><strong><em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Meaning of [Lā ilāha illallāh]</span> &#8211;</em><span style="text-decoration:underline;"> </span></strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">That none has the right to be worshiped and deified except Allāh, the only one Almighty true God. It is the belief and affirmation no one deserves to be worshipped except Allāh , it&#8217;s obligation and action upon it.So <strong>&#8216;<em>Lā ilāha&#8217;</em></strong><em> negates anyone besides Allāh deserving of worship no matter who it is.And <strong>&#8216;illallāh&#8217;</strong> affirms the fact that only Allāh has right to be worshipped and derserves to be worshipped. Elucidating a little bit more,</em></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;text-decoration:underline;"><strong><em>Lā ilāha illallāh, has 2 pillars- Which are :</em></strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><strong><em>1)</em></strong>      <strong><em>Negation (nafee) 2) Affirmation (ith&#8217;baat)</em></strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;text-decoration:underline;"><strong><em>The first pillar: Negation</em></strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><strong>Lā ilāha</strong>, <span style="color:red;">negates </span>all the types of shirk, and neccissitates in disbelieving in everything, that is worshipped besides Allāh.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;text-decoration:underline;"><strong><em>The second pillar: Affirmation</em></strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><strong><em>&#8216;</em>Illallāh<em>&#8216;, </em></strong><span style="color:red;">affirms</span> that none deserves to be worshipped, except Allah and necessitates acting upon it.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Here are few scholar&#8217;s who expounded on it, <em>(We&#8217;ll quote them in brief)</em> –</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><strong>Ash-Shaykh al-Islām al-Imām <span style="color:blue;">Ibn Taymiyyah</span><br />
</strong>wrote<strong> – <span style="text-decoration:underline;">&#8220;(Al-Ilāh)</span></strong> is <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>al-Ma&#8217;looh</strong> (the one who&#8217;s deified) and al-Ma&#8217;looh is the one who&#8217;s deserving of Worship&#8221;</span>Thus, the meaning of it: That none has the right to be [deified and] worshipped, except Allaah.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><strong>Al-Imām <span style="color:blue;">al-Qurtubee</span></strong> wrote – <span style="text-decoration:underline;">&#8220;<em><strong>Lā ilāha illallāh </strong>: </em>That there is none other worthy of worship besidesAllāh</span>&#8220;</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><strong>Al-Imām al-Hāfidh <span style="color:blue;">al-Hakamee</span></strong> wrote – <span style="text-decoration:underline;">&#8220;So the meaning of <strong>Lāilāhaillallāh<em> is : There is no deity worthy of worship in truth , besides Allah </em>(lā Ma&#8217;bood bi haqq illallāh)</strong></span><strong>&#8220;</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><strong>Al-Imām <span style="color:blue;">Abdur Rahmān ibn Hasan aal ash-Shaykh</span><em> – </em></strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">&#8220;And the meaning of <strong><em>&#8216; </em>Lā ilāha illallāh &#8216;</strong>There is no deity worthy of worship in truth , besides Allah(lāMa&#8217;bood bi haqq illallāh)&#8221;</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><strong>Hence anyone who basically knows what<em> &#8216;</em>Lā ilāha illallāh&#8217; means, would not indulge in such silly and incoherent question as done by the &#8216;Guru and Chela&#8217; <em>(Moolshankar and Agniveer)</em>.</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Now coming to the second part of the <strong>Shahādatayn </strong>that is<strong> – </strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">&#8216;<strong>Muhammadur rasūlullāh<em>&#8216;</em></strong></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"> This part itself is a proof that the <strong>Shahādah </strong>does not contain anything near to shirk! We think that the this part makes it crystal clear that <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Muhammad is the Messenger of Allāh</span> and this indirectly refutes those who claimed prophets to be children of God or incarnate of God hence this part is a refutation and rebuking against the polythiestic nature of those who made man God, and nowhere does it associate man and God.Now lets expound briefly on this part of <strong>Shahādatayn. </strong>This is the inward and outward recognition of the fact that<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>&#8216;Muhammad</strong></span><em> (sal-Allāhu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam)</em><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;"> is the Slave and Messenger of All</span>ā<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h to all the people ,who&#8217;s to be followed&#8217;. And this part also has two pillars – </span></strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">The <strong><span style="color:red;">negation</span> of &#8216;exaggeration&#8217;, &#8216;divinity&#8217; &#8216;adulation&#8217;</strong>….etc </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;text-decoration:underline;"><strong><em>The second pillar: Affirmation</em></strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">The <strong><span style="color:red;">affirmation</span> of &#8216;Slave-ship&#8217; and &#8216;Messengership&#8217; </strong>of Muhammad<em> (sal-Allāhu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam)</em>, meaning him <em>(Muhammad)</em> being the <strong>&#8216;Slave&#8217; and &#8216;Messenger&#8217; </strong>of Allāh to all the Humanity<strong>.</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">In-fact to refute <em>[silly conjectures of protestant Hindus]</em> there are many verses in the noble, holy Qur&#8217;an, which evidently refute the conjectures of protestant Hindus, for instance – </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>

</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">We see how the noble Prophet claimed to be a mere <em>&#8216;Slave&#8217;</em> of Allāh and also forbade people from &#8216;exaggerating&#8217; or adulating him like the Christians did to Jesus and made him a god! Like the Hindus<em>(orthodox)</em> make anyone who claims to be a <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>&#8216;incarnate of God&#8217;</em></span> a God.There should be no more objection or silly conjectures as this is totally enough even for dummies to understand the Islāmic stance on Prophets.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"> We think by now, it should be clear that the <strong>&#8216;Shahādatayn&#8217;</strong> does not associate <strong>&#8216;Muhammad&#8217;</strong><em> (sal-Allāhu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam)</em>to Allāh Azz wa Jall in fact it disassociates Muhammad from divinity, exaggeration and makes him a mere slave and messenger of the only one true Almighty God, to all the Humanity.And in factuality the <strong>&#8216;Shahādatayn&#8217; </strong>itself is proof of monotheistic nature of Islām.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><span style="color:#ff9900;"><strong>Agniveer</strong></span>the Hate-monger wrote – </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">&#8220;<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>If you take this concept further and <span style="color:red;">also refuse to accept any Muhammad or Gabriel </span>as necessary to be remembered apart from Allah, <span style="color:red;">you are avoiding Shirk as per Vedas</span>.</strong></span>&#8220;</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Poor agniveer, here explicitly humilates himself by exposing his , total ignorance of Islām and even of minor concepts of it <em>(Isl</em>ā<em>m)</em>.Firstly, Vedas nowhere teach the sublime and truthful concept of Shirk<em>(denouncing,rejection,censuring of Shirk)</em> in-fact Vedas are <strong><em>&#8216;Book of Polytheism&#8217;</em></strong> who have taught polytheism ,wearing the garb of monotheistic book <em>(as per protestant Hinduism)</em>.We&#8217;ve seen many instance of such polytheism advocated by Vedas in the preceding sub-sections.Any intelligent man ,after reading the above words of agniveer would be forced to question himself- <strong><em>&#8220;How come remembering God and his &#8220;Slave and Messenger&#8221; constitute to Shirk?&#8221;</em></strong>Such incompetent and logically devoid question, stemmed only due to the ignorance of Islāmic concepts on the part of protestant Hindus.Also such belief <em>(so-called &#8216;remembering&#8217; of Muhammad as a messenger and slave of Allāh)</em> is hilariously irrational, how can remembering God and stating a Human to be his slave and Messenger make upto shirk? If this is the belief of protestant Hindus then just by saying <em>&#8220;Oh! How perfectly did God make humans&#8221;</em> would make people polytheist isn&#8217;t it? God and humans are remembered together here!! Hilarious!! O you protestant Hindus go and learn the meaning of Shirk and the basic concepts of Islām, then talk, as your ignorance will only humiliate you before the entire world.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Now, coming to a similar question asked by Moolshankar- </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">&#8220;<span style="color:black;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">If it be argued that this verse only teaches that people should have faith in Mohammad as a Prophet, we should like to know where is the necessity of Mohammad (being regarded as a Prophet).</span> If God cannot accomplish His desired object without making him His Prophet, He is certainly powerless.&#8221;</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Well, this silly conjecture or at-most objection can be answered by simply asking <strong><em>&#8216;Why does protestant Hinduism inculcate faith in the 4 &#8216;rishis to be seers to whom Vedas were revealed</em></strong>? Why don&#8217;t the protestant Hindus reject these rishis?  Or believe as many Hindus believe Vedas to be the the work of these rishis? We think many would have received the answer by now, but still to make it clear, we&#8217;ll concisely state reasons why it is a necessity for Muhammad<em>(sal-Allāhu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam)</em> being regarded as a Prophet.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">1)      <strong>Because, the holy, Noble Qur&#8217;ān was revealed to Muhammad</strong><em>(sal-Allāhu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam)</em><strong>, which necessitates him to be the Messenger</strong>.It&#8217;s foolish to pose such a question <em>(i.e. &#8220;<span style="color:black;">where is the necessity of Mohammad (being regarded as a Prophet&#8221;)</span></em>.It&#8217;s clearly established that the o<span style="color:black;">ne who receives the &#8216;revelation&#8217; from God is a Prophet/Messenger! So where&#8217;s the necessity to ask such a silly question? We think that Moolshankar did not even comprehend the meaning of <em>&#8216;Messenger&#8217;</em> or what intelligent person would ask such a question? </span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">2)      <strong>Believing in the Messenger-ship <em>(or Prophethood)</em> of Muhammad</strong><em> (sal-Allāhu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam)</em><strong>is necessary as this proves that he is a mere <em>&#8216;Slave&#8217;</em> and <em>&#8216;Messenger&#8217;</em> of Allāh also this is a helps stop people making Muhammad as an &#8216;<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Avatār</span>&#8216; of God, like in Hinduism every other reformer<em>(this was with reformers , just thing what they may have done with Messengers</em>) is made an incarnate of God.This acts as an repellent against those who seek to apply <em>&#8216;divinity&#8217;</em> to the prophets or Messengers.</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><strong>3)</strong>      <strong>The belief or faith in a messenger is a necessary part, because without believing a person to be a messenger how can one believe in the book or inspiration/revelation he&#8217;s received, for instance , why do protestant hindus believe in the 4 people to be rishis to whom the vedas were revealed? Why just not believe in the vedas<em> (while rejecting the rishis)</em>? Is not such question foolishly hilarious? It is just like believing in<em> (the truth of)</em> a news flashed on news channel, while maintaining the news channel to be <span style="text-decoration:underline;">always </span>spreading false and fake news.</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><strong>The answer is simple, disbelieving in the messengership of a messenger also necessitates disbelieve in the revelation he has been provided with. Hence if protestant Hindus were to disbelieve that the vedas were revealed to the four rishis, they would be rejecting the vedas, as how can a rational person believe in the revealtion of a messenger and reject him? Hence, the protestant Hindus believe in the four rishis. Thus, disbelief in a messenger necessitates disbelief in the revealtion he has come with.</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">There are numerous reasons and points which could be stated here but for the sake of brevity we&#8217;ve stated only a few.The above silly question , evidently exposes the credentials of Moolshankar, we wonder how can such a person be labeled <em>&#8220;<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Maharishi</span>&#8220;</em> by his blind-follwers who could not even grasp easy concepts like such , and posed such ridiculously baseless question.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Lastly, Moolshankar again exposing his irrational mind wrote – </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">&#8220;If God cannot accomplish His desired object without making him His Prophet, He is certainly powerless.&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">We&#8217;ve seen who&#8217;s powerless and who&#8217;s not in the sub-section of Ishwar being Omnipotent or not.Above statement of Moolshankar is just like stating that <em>&#8220;</em><span style="color:black;">If Ishwar cannot accomplish His desired object without making him the 4 people his rishis, He is certainly powerless</span><em>&#8220;</em> So is this true, protestant hindus? Well, the answer will be in negative. Therefore, why this double-standard.The answer to Moolshankar&#8217;s defunct question is <em>&#8220;God does what He wills&#8221; (The perrogative belongs to Him alone)</em> and it is the humans who need Prophets and Messengers so that they may be guided not God.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Now coming to one of the reasons for debunking this conjecture or useless-objections of Agniveer and Moolshankar was to show their double standards and hypocricy.We included the refutation of the conjectures, in this subsection for this particular reason, so that people may see the true face of these quacks and ignobles claiming to be Scholars and nobles. We left our reader with the bizzare and absurd belief of Ishwar,Ātma and Prakriti being <strong><em>&#8216;inseparably one&#8217;</em></strong> or JOINED, UNDIVIDED.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Here we can see the double standards and hyocricy of Moolshankar and protestant Hindu who criticize Islām, for the Shahādatayn containing the mention of Prophet Muhammad, and stating it to be &#8216;Shirk'(poor polemics don&#8217;t even know the meaning of &#8216;shirk&#8217;), which has been totally debunked. But what of Protestant Hinduism? They <strong><em>adjoin</em></strong>Ātmā, Prakriti to Ishwar stating them to be &#8216;<strong><em>inseparably one&#8217; </em></strong>still claim to be &#8216;monotheist&#8217;! We would like to question what can this be called? If just the mere mention of Prophet Muhammad as being the slave and Messenger of Allāh, is polytheism <em>(as claimed),</em> then what would they label this belief of theirs? Well this is pure polytheism where God <em>(whom they call Ishwar)</em> is JOINED to Ātmā, prakriti and is <strong><em>&#8216;inseparably one&#8217;</em></strong>.We wonder who taught Moolshankar and his blind-followers the meaning of <em>&#8220;Monotheism&#8221;</em>.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">This <span style="color:red;"><strong><em>&#8216;unification&#8217;</em></strong></span> of the three eternal entities <em>[Paramātmā (Ishwar), Ātmā, Prakriti]</em> is purely an instance of Shirk or associationism, and this theory of unification is stated in Vedas – </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>&#8220;Let thy soul be <span style="color:red;">united</span> with God</strong></span>.

</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">There are plently of verses<em>(see the sub-section b.2.4 for more about this polytheistic concept)</em> exposing this polytheistic doctrine of unification of God and Human souls in vedas, but we&#8217;ve resorted to only two as these are satisfactorily enough to expose this vilest form of polytheism, in fact it&#8217;s no less than pantheism.The verses claim unification of God and human souls.Now may we ask, if the mere utterance of name of prophet Muhammad as the slave and messenger of Allāh the Almighty, in Shahādatayn is polytheism as per protestant Hindus then what would this <strong><em>&#8216;<span style="text-decoration:underline;">unification</span>&#8216;</em></strong> of God <em>(Ishwar – Paramātmā)</em> and Human Souls (<em>Ātmā)</em> be labeled as? Well, the answer is simple and outrightly evident; this is nothing but pure <span style="text-decoration:underline;">polytheism</span> under guise of monotheism. Let us provide another instance of pure and outright exclamation of associationism (Shirk) which necessitates polytheism by the protestant Hindu pandit-scholar – </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><strong>&#8220;Souls tend to <span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;">associate</span> themselves with matter but are free to do so with God.&#8221;</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">This is pure polytheism, where <em>Ātmā</em> is associated or set up as a partner to God! Isn&#8217;t this enough for true, sincere truth-seeker? We think there can be no more explicit statement then this though there are many such statements available in the works of protestant Hindu scholars.So may we ask Agniveer <em>&#8216;What is this&#8217;</em>? This is nothing more than pure polytheism.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Christianity and protestant Hinduism both have three different, distinct entities, but are one <em>(&#8216;inseparably one&#8217; according to protestant Hindus)</em>. Both the concepts be it chrisitian or protestant Hinduism both constitute to <em>&#8220;polytheism&#8221;</em> as both associate , 2 entities to God <em>(if not more)</em> and claim that they are one. Both these denominations, believe all the three entities to be distinct and different still to be one in the case of protestant Hinduism <strong><em>&#8216;inseparably one&#8217;</em></strong>. Though there are differences in this concept, in essence it is same. This concept is a violation and insult to monotheism, which takes these belief systems out of the fold of monotheism.Both even are similar in claiming monotheism , both claim to be monotheistic in nature . However, the problematic issue is that none of the two stands true to the test of monotheism.So in essence the Christian trinity is not different from the protestant Hindu trinity<em> (Vedic Trinity)</em>, both share the same belief of 3 different entities being inseparably one, give or take few issues. The basic framework of thining about god in both chrisitianity and protestant Hinduism is same.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">In essence, protestant Hinduism is similar to Christianity. It&#8217;s widely accepted by many academicians, scholars and even orthodox Hindus that Protestant Hinduism has been inspired by Christians and has adapted/edited Hindu beliefs in order to respond to Christians by making Hinduism something &#8216;modern&#8217;, and also have tried to make Hinduism something like Christianity in terms of <em>&#8220;Love&#8221;</em>, <em>&#8220;Proselytism&#8221;</em> et al. As the Hindu-fascist<em> (more correctly Hindutva-vadi)</em> Shrikant G. Talageri states in his book <em>&#8216;The Rigveda – A Historical Analysis&#8217;</em>, in Section III- Appendices -:</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">&#8220;The Christian missionaries treated Hinduism as inferior to Christianity on various counts: namely, idol-worship, polytheism, etc. Instead of countering these religious prejudices and pointing out that there was nothing superior to polytheism in monotheism, or superior to idolworship in Christian forms of worship, <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>the Arya Samaj <span style="color:red;">adopted</span> these prejudices</strong></span>, and sought to counter the Christian propaganda by insisting that Hinduism, in its pristine and &#8220;pure&#8221; form, as represented in the Vedas, was more monotheistic and non-idol-worshiping than Christianity itself. <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">This was rather like accepting and adopting the European prejudice which treats white-skinned people as superior to dark-skinned people, and then trying to show that Indian skins are whiter than European skins!</span><br />
</strong>Another point of Christian superiority to Hinduism, in the eyes of the Christian missionaries, was the claim that Christianity had One Divine Book which was the revealed word of God, while the Hindus had a large and miscellaneous assortment of religious books. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">The Arya Samaj sought to counter this by raising the Vedas to that status: the Vedas thus became the one and only Divine Book (the four Samhitas being treated as parts of one indivisible whole) revealed by God</span>.&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Anyone, who has read Satyarth Prakāsh and other protestant Hindu manuals, books, will take no time to acknowledge the influence and impact of Christianity on protestant Hinduism and the consequences of such influence and impact. Though Moolshankar had put all his energy to <strong><em>&#8216;reform&#8217;</em></strong> Hinduism by reinterpreting Vedas and other Shashtras as per his whims, it&#8217;s to be noted that all such things done were in line with Christian principles and methods and were done in- order to present Hinduism as a competitor against so-called monotheistic<em>(undoubtedly Polytheistic)</em> and modern faith like Christianity.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">And as Ronald Neufeldt writes,</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">&#8220;Even in the case of Dayānanda, whose relationships with Christians tended to be polemical, one finds an emphasis on a personal God who rules in terms of justice, compassion and orderliness and the assertion that these beliefs are in accord with the dictates of conscience and reason. <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Clearly there is much here that parallels the language of missionaries and indologists alike, and in some cases at least there is the <span style="color:red;">admission of indebtedness to the teachings of bible and the missionaries.</span></strong></span>&#8220;</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Also as Harold Coward writes,</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><strong>&#8220;Dayananda made Hinduism a religion of the book by adopting the Protestant principle of <em>sola scriptura</em> and applying it to the Vedas&#8221;</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"> – [&#8220;Dayananda&#8217;s Approach to Other Religions&#8221;, in G.R.Garg, <em>World Perspectives on Swami  Dayananda Saraswati</em>, pg. 267, 1984] </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">Moolshankar used the protestant principle of <strong><em>&#8216;Sola Scriptura&#8217;</em></strong> , and demoted Upanishads, Brahmanas…etc to the level of smriti <em>(from shruti)</em> and only the Samhitā portion were or are called as <em>&#8216;Vedas&#8217;</em> by him and his blind-followers. In fact if we were to see today, we can find numerous similarities between protestant Hinduism and Christianity with regards to their presentation, organization and proselytizing…etc. For instance we can see how , fanatics like Mahendra Pāl, Agniveer et al. use <em>&#8216;Character Assassination'(to malign noble Prophet Muhammad Sallal lāhu alayhi wa Sallam)</em> as a tool against Islām, this was first used by Christians against Muslims as they very well-knew, Islām taught and commanded strict mannerism and respect, even toward bitter enemies , hence by attacking the character of the noble Prophet they were sure that Muslims won&#8217;t get so lowly and unethical, due to stringent Islāmic mannerism and secondly the high respect Muslims held for Jesus Christ , as we believe him to be prophet of the Almighty ,hence <em>(Muslims)</em> would not retaliate by abusing, debasing or maligning Jesus. Protestant Hinduism also follows something similar to protestant chrisitianity and that&#8217;s the watchword by Luther – <em>&#8220;back to Bible&#8221;</em>, where as Moolshankar cried out – <em>&#8220;back to Vedas&#8221;</em>.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">And this same <em>&#8216;Character Assassination&#8217;</em> is used by protestant Hindus against Islām; moreover they<em> (protestant Hindus like Agniveer et al) </em>use the same arguments and claims concocted by the Christian missionaries and Christian Islāmophobes. Their style of proselytizing and converting people is similar to that of Christians, using <em>&#8216;deception&#8217;</em> and are <em>&#8216;double-faced&#8217;</em>, at times they&#8217;ll be talking of global peace, brotherhood and behind the back they&#8217;ll be found abusing and maligning your religion, on false accounts and fake information. </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">If anyone were to read polemical works by protestant Hindus against Islām , he would fore sure be struck by the striking similarity between their<em>(protestant Hinduism and Christianity)</em>methods, works and arguments, in factuality most of the arguments hurled at Islām by protestant Hindus are borrowed from Christian Orientalists and missionaries. There are tremendous amount of similarities between these two paragons of polytheism and false-hood, but due to space and time scarcity we won&#8217;t be dealing with those, in here for now.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
