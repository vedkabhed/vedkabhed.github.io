<p>Written by Sulaiman Razvi</p>
<p>Hinduism is perhaps the only religion in the world which has a deity of liquor called Varuni and a god like Shiva associated with Bhang (cannabis). Intoxicant consumption is not unknown in Hindu society. In fact, intoxicants like Bhang and liquor have become ceremonial beverages during Hindu festivals like Holi and Diwali. Bhang (hemp/cannabis) in the form of drink is widely consumed by Hindus during the festival Holi. Even Sadhus spend their lives smoking weed to please their lord Shiva though it is in violation of NDPS act. Dr. B.R. Ambedkar wrote in his book Riddles in Hinduism, &#8220;The ancient Aryans were also a race of drunkards. Wine formed a most essential part of their religion. The Vedic Gods drank wine. The divine wine was called Soma. Since the Gods of the Aryans drank wine the Aryans had no scruples in the matter of drinking. Indeed to drink it was a part of an Aryan&#8217;s religious duty&#8230;Who were denied Soma drank Sura which was ordinary, unconsecrated wine sold in the market. Not only the male Aryans were addicted to drinking but the females also indulged in drinking. The Kaushitaki Grihya Sutra I.11-12 advises that four or eight women who are not widowed after having been regaled with wine and food should be called to dance for four times on the night previous to the wedding ceremony.&#8221;<br />
<span id="more-4848"></span></p>
<p>Consumption of liquor is clearly prohibited in Hindu scriptures and it is considered a great sin (Mahapataka) but some texts allow it under certain conditions, moreover, there are plenty of examples of Gods, Rishis and even Goddesses enjoying liquor. Some text even suggests the use of liquor for offering a libation to Hindu deities. There are approximately 11 types of liquors mentioned in Hindu scriptures such as Sura which is made from grains and was perhaps the most popular drink back then, Maireya which is Rum and made from treacle or molasses, Paista which is made from rice, Madhvika made from flowers, Madhuka made from honey, Panasa taken from jack fruit, Draksa made from grapes, Khajura sambhava made from date fruits, Nalikeraja prepared from coconut palm, Gaudi prepared from molasses, Arista which is a fermented liquor made from soapberry. Wine is praised in various ways in Hinduism, As per Agni Purana 84.1-2 dreaming about ‘wine in the night preceding the day of the ceremony, should be held as the most auspicious ones’, As per Srimad Bhagavatam 5.1.32-33 there are seven islands on Earth which are separated by seven oceans and the oceans are of salt water, sugarcane juice, wine, clarified butter, milk, curds and pure water.</p>
<p>Kumraila Bhatta a 8<sup>th</sup> century Hindu reformer observes, &#8220;Among the people of modern days we find the Brahmana women of the countries of Ahicchatra and Mathura to be addicted to drinking.&#8221; (Tantra-vartika, I.III.4). He condemned this practice in the case of Brahmins only, but not of Ksatriya and Vaisya men and women, if the liquor was distilled from fruits or flowers (Madhvi) and molasses (Gaudi) and not from grains (Sura). Madhavacharya in his Sankara Dig Vijaya Canto 15, verses 1-23 wrote that Adi Shankaracharya along with King Sudhanva traveled to Karnataka where they happened to confront Kapalikas a Shaivite sect who were engaged in drinking liquor in their worship like the Saktas. Then they had a debate on the issue. Which shows that Sadhus consumed liquor in 8<sup>th</sup> century also. Consumption of liquor by Kapalin (Shaivite sect of Hinduism) is much older than this, It is mentioned in Skanda Purana I.i.1.33-34 that Kapalins were engaged in drinking liquor. Liquor or cannabis consumption is not a taboo in the Shaivite sect because of that they are censured by Vaishnavite Hindus. Srimad Bhagavatam a Vaishnavite Purana censures Kapalins in the following way,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 4.2.28-29 “One who takes a vow to satisfy Lord Śiva or who follows such principles will certainly become an atheist and be diverted from transcendental scriptural injunctions. Those who vow to worship Lord Śiva are so foolish that they imitate him by keeping long hair on their heads. When initiated into worship of Lord Śiva, they prefer to live on wine, flesh and other such things.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p><strong>Swami Prabhupada wrote</strong>: “It is sometimes seen that devotees of Lord Śiva imitate the characteristics of Lord Śiva. For example, Lord Śiva drank an ocean of poison, so some of the <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">followers of Lord Śiva imitate him and try to take intoxicants like gāñjā (marijuana)</span>. Here the curse is that if someone follows such principles he must become an infidel and turn against the principles of Vedic regulation. It is said that such devotees of Lord Śiva will be sac-chāstra-paripanthinaḥ, which means “opposed to the conclusion of śāstra, or scripture.’…” <strong>Swami Prabhupada on Srimad Bhagavatam 4.2.28</strong> <a href="http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_4.2.28" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_4.2.28<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>

<h1>Definition of Sura &amp; Asura</h1>
<p>Devas in Hinduism are also called Sura and their enemies i.e. Demons are called Asuras, In later texts like Itihaas and Purana the definition of Sura and Asura given is that the Devas were imbibers of wine hence they were called Sura (literal meaning is liquor) and the demons did not accept liquor hence they were called A-Sura. As per stories mentioned in Hindu texts, Varuni (liquor) was born during the second churning of the ocean (Samundra Manthan) by Devas and Danavas. The Devas accepted her while the Danavas rejected her.</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana, Lalita-Mahatmya 9.66-69 &#8220;When the ocean of Milk was once again churned by the Devas and Danavas, goddess Varuni with tremulous eyes on account of inebriety, rose up even as the Siddhas in the firmament began to think &#8216;What is this&#8217;? She smilingly stood in front of the Asuras. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Daityas did not accept her. </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Therefore</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> they become Asuras</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">They were given the appellation Asura in the sense &#8216;Those who do not have Sura (liquor)</span>&#8216;. Thereupon, she stood in front of Devas. On the direction given by paramesthin (Brahma) Deva joyously accepted her. In view of the fact that they accepted Sura, they became glorified by the appellation Sura.&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Ramayana of Valmiki, Bala Kanda 1, Sarga 45, verses 36-37 &#8220;Oh, Rama, the sons of Diti, namely asuraa-s, have not espoused that daughter of Rain-god, but oh, brave Rama, the sons of Aditi on their part, namely sura-s, have espoused that impeccable Vaaruni. Thereby the sons of Diti are called a suraa-s, and the sons of Aditi are called suraa-s, and gods are delighted and rejoiced on espousing Vaaruni.&#8221; Tr. Desiraju Hanumanta Rao</p>
<p>Mahabharata mentions the vow of Asura which was to abstain from drinking alcohol,</p>
<p>Mahabharata Vana Parva 3, Section 255&#8243;&#8230;And I shall observe the Asura vow&#8230;&#8221; Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Kisari Mohan Ganguli writes, &#8220;The vow of the Asuras was (according to the Burdwan Pundits) never to drink wine&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m03/m03255.htm#fn_83" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m03/m03255.htm#fn_83<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>Varuni is the liquor deity of Hinduism, some texts calls her the wife of Varuna and some considers her the daughter of Varuna. Wine was born after churning of the ocean as per Hindu texts,</p>
<p>Mahabharata Udyoga Parva 5, Section 102 “…<span style="color: #000000;">The gods, uniting with the Asuras, and making the Mandara mountain their pole, churned the waters of the ocean and obtained the wine called Varuni…” Tr. K.M. Ganguli </span></p>
<p>Mahabharata Udyoga Parva 5, Section 98 “…<span style="color: #000000;">Behold now, O companion of the Lord of the celestials, that abode, made entirely of gold, and full of the wine called </span><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Varuni</em></span><span style="color: #000000;">. Indeed, having obtained that wine, the gods acquired their god-heads…” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Consumption of Alcohol by Gods and Goddesses</h1>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Rama &amp; Sita</span></strong></p>
<p>Rama the Maryada Purshottom (ideal man) is said to have made his wife Sita drink wine and then enjoyed the dance of women,</p>
<p>Ramayana of Valmiki, Uttarakhanda 7, Sarga 42, Verses 18-23 &#8220;Like unto Purandara with Sachi <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">he took Sita by the hand, made her sit and drink the wine</span> distilled in the province of Mira. And in no time the servants brought for him <span style="color: #ff0000;">well-cooked meat</span> and various fruits. Being inebriate the beautiful <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Apsaras, well-skilled in the art of singing and dancing, began to dance before Rama</span> in the company of Kinnaris. The virtuous souled Rama, the foremost of those who know how to please, satisfied those beautiful damsels adorned with various ornaments.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">This verse appears in the 52nd Sarga of M.N. Dutt&#8217;s translation but actually, it is supposed to be in the 42nd Sarga. Following is another English translation by Hindu scholar Hari Prasad Shastri,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Valmiki Ramayana, Uttarakhanda 7, Sarga 42, Verses 18-23 &#8220;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Taking Sita by the hand, Kakutstha gave her delicious wine made of distilled honey to drink</span>, as formerly Puandara had offered to Sachi. Thereafter pure viands and fruits of every kind were brought by servants, whilst lovely Apsaras, skilled in the arts of singing and dancing, began to perform in the Prince&#8217;s presence and troops of Nymphs and Uragas, surrounded by the Kinneris intoxicated with wine, danced before Kakutstha, and the virtuous Rama, the most captivating of warriors, delighted those ravishing and charming women.&#8221; Tr. Hari Prasad Shastri</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Following is the Hindi translation with Sanskrit text by Chaturvedi Dwaraka Prasad Sharma,</span></p>

<p>The Sanskrit word mentioned here is Madhu Maireya which is a type of liquor made from honey, Panini defines the word Madhu Maireya as,</p>
<p>Ashtadhyaya Panini, Book VI, Ch 11, verse 70 &#8220;&#8230;Thus ग्रुंडमेरेय: &#8216;the wine maireya prepared from treacle or molasses&#8217;. <span style="color: #ff0000;">मधुमैरेय:</span> &#8216;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">maireya prepared from honey</span>&#8216;. Why do we say when denoting &#8216;an ingredient?&#8217; Observe परममैरेय: Why do we say &#8216;before मेरेय?&#8217; Observe पुष्पासव: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Every sort of spirituous liquor except</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> सुरा</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">is called </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">मेरेय</span>.” Tr. Srisa Chandra Vasu</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="989" height="257" class="wp-image-8880 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Ashtadhyayi-Panini-6.jpeg" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Ashtadhyayi-Panini-6.jpeg 989w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Ashtadhyayi-Panini-6-300x78.jpeg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Ashtadhyayi-Panini-6-768x200.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 989px) 100vw, 989px" /></p>
<p>The above passage also makes the definition of the word Sura (सुरा) clear. Swami Vivekananda wrote,</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p>“…Instances are found in the Râmâyana and the Mahâbhârata of the drinking of wine and the taking of meat by Rama and Krishna, whom they worship as God. Sita Devi vows meat, rice, and a thousand jars of wine to the river-goddess, Gangâ!”<br />
<a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Complete_Works_of_Swami_Vivekananda/Volume_5/Writings:_Prose_and_Poems/The_East_and_The_West/Food_and_Cooking" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Complete_Works_of_Swami_Vivekananda/Volume_5/Writings:_Prose_and_Poems/The_East_and_The_West/Food_and_Cooking<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p></blockquote>
<p>When Hanuman met Sita in the Ashok Vatika, he informed Sita about the condition of Rama, he told Sita that Rama has given up consumption of liquor and meat due to the grief of being separated from her,</p>
<p>Ramayana of Valmiki, Sundara Khanda 5, Sarga 36, verse 41 &#8220;Rama is not eating meat, nor indulging even in spirituous liquor. Everyday, in the evening, he is eating the food existing in the forest, well arranged for him.&#8221; Tr. K.M.K. Murthy</p>
<p>We know that Rama was a meat-eater, when he was about to go to Vanvaas (exile into the forest) he lamented that he would have to live in the forest without meat. So this verse indicates that Rama also consumed liquor. A verse from Ayodhya Kanda of Valmiki Ramayana states that Sita vowed to offer hundred cups of wine to the goddess if her wish is fulfilled,</p>
<p>Ramayana of Valmiki, Ayodhya Kanda 2, Sarga 55, verses 19-20 &#8220;Having come near the middle of the Kalindi, Sita prayed unto her, saying, &#8216;Hail to thee, O goddess! I cross thee. If my husband can successfully perform his vow. I will worship thee with a thousand cows and a hundred vessels of wine.&#8221; Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Hanuman</span></strong></p>
<p>The ardent Bhakt of Rama is also said to have taken intoxicants,</p>
<p>Mahabharata Vana Parva 3, Section 145, Verse 86 “…The powerful Hanuman, however, opening his eyes partially looked at him (Bhima) with disregard, with eyes reddened with intoxication&#8230;” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Krishna</span> </strong></p>
<p>In the Mahabharata, Sanjay describes Krishna and Arjuna in the company of Draupadi and Satyabhama (wife of Krishna and an incarnation of Bhudevi), exhilarated by Bassia wine,</p>
<p>Mahabharata, Udyog Parva 5, Section 59, verses 2-5 &#8220;Sanjaya said, &#8216;Listen, O king, as I tell thee the state in which I found Krishna and Dhananjaya. I will also, O Bharata, tell thee what those heroes said; O king, with looks bent down and hands joined together, and with senses well restrained, I entered the inner apartments for conferring with those gods among men. Neither Abhimanyu nor the Twins can repair to that place where <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">are the two Krishnas and Draupadi and lady Satyabhama. There I beheld those chastisers of foes, exhilarated with Bassia wine</span>, their bodies adorned with garlands of flowers.” Tr. Kisari Mohan Ganguli</p>
<p>Renowned Hindu scholar Kumarila Bhatta explained this verse of Mahabharata and justified it by saying that by drinking wine Krishna and Arjuna didn’t transgress the law. Kumarila Bhatta wrote that Sura (prepared from grain) is prohibited whereas Krishna and Arjuna drank Madhu which is not prohibited and that Kshatriyas and Vaishyas can have Madhu and Sidhi (types of liquors made from honey and molasses),</p>
<p>Tantra Vartika, Adhyaya 1, Pada III, Adhi 4(a) “Then remains the case of Krshna and Arjuna being drunk with wine, and having married the daughters of their respective maternal uncles, both being instances of direct transgressions of the law. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">But it is only the wine distilled from grains, which is called &#8216;Sura&#8217;, that is prohibited for the three higher castes;</span> says the Smrti: &#8216;Sura is the impure essence of the grains and it is evil that is spoken of as impure; hence the Brahmana, the Kshatriya and the Vaicya should never drink Sura.&#8217; <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">As for the particular wines &#8216;Madhu&#8217; (wine distilled from certain fruits, as grapes and the like), and the &#8216;Sidhu&#8217; (that distilled from molasses), these are not prohi</span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">bited for the Kshatriya and the </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Vaicya</span>, as &#8216;all intoxicating drinks&#8217; have been prohibited for the Brahmana alone. Though there is a passage that declares &#8216;all the three kinds of wine, the Gaudi (that distilled from molasses) Paishthi (that distilled from grains) and Madhu (distilled from fruits), being the same, they should not be drunk by the Brahmavadis,&#8217; yet here the word &#8216;Brahmavadi&#8217; should be taken as denoted the Brahmanas only, as the word literally means &#8216;one who is capable of teaching Brahma,&#8217; or &#8216;whose duty it is to teach Brahma&#8217;, or &#8216;whose excellence lies in such teaching&#8217;, and as the root &#8216;Vada&#8217; is synonymous with &#8216;Bru&#8217; such duties are distinctly restricted to the Brahmana alone, by such texts as &#8216;from among the three higher castes, the Brahmana alone should teach&#8217;&#8230;Hence we take the passage &#8216;All the three kinds of wine, etc,&#8217; to mean that just as the one, Sura distilled from grains, is not drinkable by the three higher castes, so are all the three undrinkable by the Brahmana otherwise, if the simple prohibition of wine in general were meant, then the words &#8216;Yathava, etc.,&#8217; and &#8216;Brahmavadibhih&#8217; would be totally redundant. The mention of &#8216;the three castes&#8217; we shall supply from out of another verse. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">For this reason, the fact of Krshna and Arjuna both Kshatriyas being intoxicated with &#8216;Madhu&#8217; (grape wine) is in no way a transgression of the law</span>. And, as a matter of fact, we have Vedic texts that distinctly show (1) that the prohibition of wine is for others (i.e, Brahmanas), and also (2) that is distinctly permissible (in the case of others)&#8230;hence the Brahmana should not drink the wine; lest he be attached to evil&#8217;, and (2) &#8216;The Kshatriya should say to the Brahmana &#8216;the drinking of wine does no harm to him who knows this&#8217;, and this latter is with the reference to the &#8216;Madhu&#8217; and the &#8216;Sidhu&#8217; (and not the &#8216;Sura&#8217; which is in no case allowed to anyone else but the Cudra)&#8230;” Tr. Ganganath Jha</p>
<p>As far as my opinion is concerned, Even Sura is not prohibited for Brahmins as Vedas the eternal law for Hindus gives instructions on the consumption of Sura for Brahmins and Kshatriyas. Padma Purana states that Krishna used to drink wine in the company of his wives who also enjoyed wine,</p>
<p>Padma Purana V.89.53-59a &#8220;Then the two, O brahmana, being tired due to many pastimes proper for the times in the groves endowed with vernal breezes on all sides, resort, with their attendants, to the root of a tree, and sitting on a divine seat, drink liquor, O best sage. Then the two, intoxicated due to the liquor, with their eyes closed due to sleep, holding each other&#8217;s hands, being under the influence of Cupid&#8217;s arrows, and desiring to sport, enter, with their words and mind stumbling on the path. There they sport like a female elephant and (the male elephant) the lord of the herd. All the friends also, intoxicated by wine, and with their eyes troubled by sleep (i.e. drowsy) sleep all around in the charming bowers. Again and again incited by his beloved, Krsna, the lord, would go near all, with a separate body (for each) and simultaneously. Having satisfied all of them as a lord of elephants satisfies the female elephants, he would, along with his beloved and with them, go to the lake to sport.&#8221; Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p>A story mentioned in Skanda and Samba Purana goes like this, Narada Muni visited Krishna, and all the Yadu boys received him with their heads bowed down in respect but Samba the son of Krishna didn’t greet him properly, So Narada thought of teaching him a lesson. So he told Krishna that his 16100 wives were sexually attracted to Samba. Krishna doesn’t believe him. Then Narada visits him again after a gap of a few days, there he sees that Krishna along with his wives were engaged in drinking liquor. Narada takes this as an opportunity to teach Samba a lesson so he tells Samba that his father i.e. Krishna is calling him. Samba goes there and sits next to his father Krishna. Intoxicated wives of Krishna becomes sexually aroused seeing the handsome boy and their private parts becomes moistened so much that even their underwear becomes drenched due to arousal. Then suddenly Narada Muni enters the place and all the wives of Krishna gets up to pay respect to Narada Muni and then all their dresses slip from their bodies including their wet underwear. Krishna then curses his wives. So it shows that Krishna used to quaff liquor along with his wives, story mentioned in Skanda Purana is too long, I have tried my best to shorten it while the Samba Purana is a summarized version by Wendy Doniger. The Skanda Purana verse also states that Samba used to enjoy liquor and had illicit relationships with women,</p>
<p>Samba Purana 3.6-55 &#8220;One day Narada came to Dvaraka to see Krsna. All the Yadu boys received him with respect, but Samba, proud of his young beauty and deluded by the fated, inevitable force of the curse, disregarded Narada. To teach Samba a lesson, Narada told Krsna that all of Krsna&#8217;s sixteen thousand wives were in love with Samba. Samba was summoned, and the women, whose minds were blurred by wine, showed inmistakable signs of passion when Samba appeared&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Skanda Purana Book VII, Section I, Chapter 101, verses 1-38 &#8220;At this very juncture (came) venerable sage Narada&#8230;In the court of his wandering at will, he always used to come to Dvaravati to pay a visit to Vasudeva. As he came on quickly all the Yadava youths beginning with Pradyumna remained with their heads (politely) bent down&#8230;but Samba due to the inevitability of the curse, slighted the noble souled Narada as usual. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Being very proud of his youth and handsome features he was forever indulgent in sexual dalliance and liquor</span>. On seeing him impolite and rude, Narada thought thus: Today I shall try to curb this impolite one&#8230;After thinking thus, he spoke to Vasudeva: O most excellent one among Devas, here there are sixteen thousand women. O my Lord, their emotional fondness for Samba is much&#8230;On hearing these words from Narada, Kesava began to think. What has thus been mentioned by Narada may have some truth in it&#8230;Narada went away as he came. A few days thereafter, he returned to Dvaraka. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">On that day the Lord was engaged in drinking liquor after enjoying aquatic sports along with all the members of his Antahpura (inner </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">apartment)&#8230;</span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Staying </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">there the Lord drank the liquor of great auspicious flavour</span>. In the meantime, fully aware that the <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">women were inebriated due to liquor</span>, Narada spoke to Samba: &#8216;O princely youth, do come and stand here. The Lord calls you. It is not proper on my part to stay on there.&#8217; Urged by Narada&#8230;Samba entered quickly and bowed down to his father. He took the seat pointed out by Visnu with natural feeling. In the meantime those women there who were deficient in self control became highly agitated as soon as they saw Samba. As they were staying within the Antahpura so long, they had not seen him before. The liquor had its own effect in making them forget everything. Further they were naturally devoid of self control. Hence their loins became moistened. On seeing an excellent man, the excellent organ of generation of women becomes moistened and dump even if they are observing celibacy or are Yoginis&#8230;After sending Samba in, Narada also came hurriedly closely on the heels of Samba. On seeing the sage coming with pleasant manners, all those women suddenly got up; they were tipsy. Even as Vasudeva was watching, when they got up suddenly their valuable garments got torn and fell down into the pots (of liquor). The clothes clinging to their loins (underwear) also fell separately. On seeing it Hari became angry, he cursed those women: O women, since your minds strayed elsewhere unmindful of me, you will not get into the regions occupied by your husband at the close of your life. Slipping down from the world of your husband as well as from the path of heaven, you will have no refuge and will fall into the clutches of robbers. As a result of this defect and curse, those women, at the time of Krsna&#8217;s heavenward departure, were abducted by robbers belonging to Pancanada even as Arjuna was looking on.&#8221; Tr. Ganesh Vasudeo Tagare</p>
<p>Mahabharata Virata Parva 4, Section 72, Verses 19-28 &#8220;And Krishna gave unto each of the illustrious sons of Pandu numerous female slaves, and gems and robes. And then the nuptial festival set in between the families of the Matsya king and the Pandavas. And then conchs and cymbals and horns and drums and other musical instruments appointed by the Pandavas, began to play in the palace of Virata. And deer of various kinds and clean animals by hundreds were slain. And wines of various kinds and intoxicating juices of trees were profusely collected.&#8221; Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Krishna in the following verse is mentioned as Rama,</p>
<p>Skanda Purana VII.I.202.10-11 &#8220;Rama with the plough as his weapon, went to the city of Dvaravati teeming with delighted and contented people. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">There he indulged in a drunken bout with the persons (ladies) </span>of his Antahpura. After imbibing wine, he seized a mace with his hand and went to the splendid garden of Raivatodyana accompanied by Revati and others. Moving in the midst of groups of women, he went along with faltering steps like an inebriated person&#8230;&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Skanda Purana VII.I.202.31-32 &#8220;The Brahmanas assembled there, were well-versed in the Puranas and were glad to listen to the stories and conducts of the primordial celestial sages. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">On seeing Rama with eyes reddened due to drinking wine</span> they thought, &#8216;He is thoroughly drunk&#8217;, and hurriedly got up and began to honour and adore Halayudha excepting Suta who continued to sit.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Suta kills the Brahmins so Krishna feels the guilt of drinking wine, vows to abstain from wine drinking and also orders corporal punishment to those guilty of drinking wine therefrom. But was the law ever implemented? Because his beloved brother Balrama was addicted to wine and Krishna’s son Samba and grandson Pradumnya is also said to have relished wine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Balarama</strong></p>
<p>Krishna’s brother Balarama was addicted to drinking liquor, several texts mentions this habit of Balarama,</p>
<p>Brahma Purana 90.5-7 &#8220;Roaming about that spot Balarama inhaled the intensive odour of wine. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">After smelling it he experienced the delight that he previously used to have in wine</span>. O sages, thereafter, Balarama saw a current of liquor suddenly falling form Kadamba. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">He derived great joy therefrom. He drank it joyously</span> in the company of cowherds and cowherdesses&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Harivamsa Purana, Visnu Parva 2.41.5-13 &#8220;Then the valiant, auspicious Sankarsana (Balarama), appearing like an elephant roamed on the peak of the mountain, without Krishna. He went under the shade of the kadamba (Nauclea Cadamba) tree, fully blossomed, enjoying the breeze with a faint smell, comfortably. While he was enjoying the breeze there, the smell of (vinous) spirituous liquor entered his nose. Immediately he was affected by the desire to have Varuni, (spirituous liquor). His face appeared dim like the face of an intoxicated person in the afternoon. Then the lord immediately remembered the ancient incident of partaking Amrita (nectar). Then, searching for spirituous liquor, he saw that tree. The water from the rain clouds, showered on the fully blossomed, beautiful tree became the spirituous liquor in the hollows of the tree. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">After drinking that liquor again and again with desire, his body was swaying with intoxication</span>. The eyes on the face of the intoxicated Balarama, with the colour of the moon in winter, started moving and rolling. Born in the hollows of kadamba, that liquor named KdambarI (kadamba liquor) is Varuni in the body form, the nectar liquor of the deva-s.&#8221; Tr. A. Purushothaman and A. Harindranath</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 5.251-11 “Varuńa, in order to provide for his recreation, said to his wife Váruńí (the goddess of wine), &#8220;Thou, Madirá, art ever acceptable to the powerful Ananta; go therefore, auspicious and kind goddess, and promote his enjoyments.&#8221; Obeying these commands, Váruní went and established herself in the hollow of a Kadamba tree in the woods of Vrindávana. Baladeva, roaming about, came there, and smelling the pleasant fragrance of liquor, resumed his ancient passion for strong drink. The holder of the ploughshare observing the vinous drops distilling from the Kadamba tree, was much delighted, and gathered and quaffed them along with the herdsmen and the Gopís, whilst those who were skilful with voice and lute celebrated him in their songs. Being inebriated with the wine…Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>

He was singing amidst a crowd of young women, and since <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">He had drunk vāruṇī liquor</span>, His eyes rolled as if He were intoxicated. His body shone brilliantly as He behaved like an elephant in rut…Angered, Lord Balarāma, the best of fighters, hurled a rock at him, but the cunning ape dodged the rock and grabbed the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Lord’s pot of liquor</span>. Further infuriating Lord Balarāma by laughing and by ridiculing Him, wicked Dvivida then broke the pot and offended the Lord even more by pulling at the girls’ clothing. Thus the powerful ape, puffed up with false pride, continued to insult Śrī Balarāma.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Harivamsa Purana 2.46.21-23 &#8220;Meanshile, Gopas, knowledgeable about the place and time, presented the liquor, Varuni to Balarama, the learned soul. At that time, Balarama drank (the liquor) surrounded by the acquaintances. Balarama, who had gone to the interior of the forest drank the stimulating liquor.&#8221; Tr. A. Purushothaman and A. Harindranath</p>
<p>Brahma Purana 84.34-45 &#8220;There in the waters of Yamuna he saw Balarama with a thousand hoods&#8230;His ear-rings were fine.

Next they offered her food containing all good qualities, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">and a sweet inebriating drink called āsavam</span>.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Swami Prabhupada insists that Asava is not liquor but an Ayurvedic drink made from herbs, but then he translates the same word Asava as beer in Srimad Bhagavatam 4.18.16.</p>
<p>Matangi is one of the Mahavidyas, ten Tantric goddesses and a ferocious aspect of Devi, the Hindu Divine Mother. She is considered to be the Tantric form of Sarasvati,</p>
<p>Skanda Purana III.ii.18.146-7 &#8220;They should perform four circumambulations. The couple should cover themselves with a silken cloth and go ahead. After sprinkling water over Matangi the excellent Madhvika (honey that intoxicates) should be taken. The intelligent devotee should worship Matangi with vacal and instrumental music.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-size: 16pt;">RISHIS</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Dattatreya</span></strong></p>
<p>The Markandeya Purana tells us that once when the gods were defeated by the demons in a battle, they approached Brihaspati for help. Brihaspati sent them to Muni Dattatreya the son of Rishi Atri. When the gods approached Dattatreya, they found him drinking wine in the company of Lakshmi with whom he also had sex. The gods prayed to him for help, but he pointed out his own faults, drinking, attachment, affection and sexual enjoyment of women. But then the gods told him that he is sinless and he is not stained by these acts,</p>
<p>Markandeya Purana 18.23-32 &#8220;Thus exhorted the gods then went to <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Dattatreya&#8217;s hermitage, and they beheld the high-souled Muni, attended by Lakshmi</span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">hymned by Gandharvas and engrossed in </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">quaffing spirituous liquor</span>&#8230;Daddatreya addressed the prostrate gods, &#8216;What desire ye of me, that ye do me this obeisance&#8230;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">I am drinking strong drink</span>, I have remnants of food in my mouth, nor I subdued my senses. How is it, O gods, ye seek for victory over your enemies even from me?&#8217; <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The gods spoke. Thou art sinless</span>, O lord of the world; no stain hast thou, into whose heart, purified by the ablution of learning, has entered the light of knowledge. True is this, o gods! all learning have I, who am impartial in view: <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">but by reason of association with this woman</span> I am now impure after eating. For commerce with women when continually pursued tends to depravity. Thus addressed, the gods then spoke again. This woman, O sinless brahman! is the mother of the world; she is not depraved&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Lakshmi was present there and then he tells the gods that he had copulation with this woman (i.e. Lakshmi), Padma Purana tells us that Dattatreya had sex with Lakshmi though it doesn’t mention Lakshmi but the above verse attests to this statement,</p>
<p>Padma Purana II.103.110-113 &#8220;Atri&#8217;s son Dattatreya, the high-souled brahmana, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">the great sage, with his eyes red due to (having drunk) spirituous liquor, was sporting with a woman</span>. The virtuous one, intoxicated by wine, having seated a young, auspicious woman, best of all women, on his lap, sang, danced and heavily drank liquor&#8230;&#8221; Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p>Another verse shows that Dattatreya asked a king to bring him some meat and wine and the king presented the same,</p>
<p>Padma Purana II.103.124-8 &#8220;When a long time of many days passed, Dattatreya, in an intoxicated condition, said to the best king: &#8216;Do as I tell you. Give me wine in a cup; and the meal of flesh that is got cooked.&#8217; Hearing those words of him, that Ayu, the lord of the earth, being eager, speedily got wine in a cup, and quickly cut off well-cooked flesh with his hand, and, O best one, the best king, gave these to Dattatreya. That best sage became happy in mind&#8230;&#8221; Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Kashyapa</span></strong></p>
<p>According to Puranas, Kashyapa was a drunkard, he was addicted to wine and thus he was given the name Kashya (wine) + Hasya (laughter),</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana 2.3.1.120-1 &#8220;When Daksa was over-bearing in his speech in regard to his daughters, the holy lord became angry. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Then he drank Kasya. Liquor is called by the name Kasya</span>. The word Kasi should be understood to have the sense of Hasya (Humour, wit). The speech and mind are mentioned by the word Kasya. Liquor is remembered by Brahmanas by means of the word Kasya. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The sage is called Kasyapa due to his drinking liquor</span>.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Vayu Purana, Section II, Ch 4, verse 114-5 &#8220;Kasyapa was the knower of the sun (?) Hence he was on a par with Brahma. In every Manvantara, he is born through a part of Brahma. The subjects were angered by Daksa, it is said (?) for the sake of (his) daughters. Then he drank wine. The word &#8216;Kasya&#8217; means wine. Hascekasa should be known as Brahma&#8217;s Kasya. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Kasya is remembered by Brahmanas as wine. Because he drank Kasya (wiine) he is called Kasyapa</span>.&#8221; Tr. G.P. Bhatt, edited by G.V. Tagare</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Consumption by Kings</span></strong></p>
<p>Liquor drinking seems to have been part of the life of nobles in the Vedic and Puranik period, there are some references to the consumption of liquor by kings,</p>

When thou, with might <span style="text-decoration: underline;">hadst drunk the draught that gladdens</span>, Sarasvatī, O Maghavan, refreshed thee.” Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>Griffith has translated the word Sura as draught here. These verses are also repeated in Yajur Veda 20.76-78 where Griffith has mentioned the word Sura in his translation and I have further explained it in this article in the Sautramani sacrifice category. These verses are elaborated in Baudhayana Srauta Sutra,</p>
<p>Baudhayana Srauta Sutra XVII.35 &#8220;…The Maitravruna recites as the puronuvakya the verse, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">&#8216;O Asvins the guardians of the auspicious, do you two partaking of the Sura-soma in association with the demon Namuci help Indra in his deeds</span>.&#8217; Having crossed the alter and having caused to announce, he says (to the Maitravaruna), &#8216;Do you impel (the Hotr to recite the yajya for the Sura-soma set forth for the Asvins, Sarasvati and Sutraman Indra.&#8217; The Maitravaruna pronounces the call, &#8216;Let the Hotr recite the yajya for the Asvins, Sarasvati and Sutraman Indra. These Sura-soma (o gods) set forth for you-powerful, exhilerating, prepared out of the mixture&#8230;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">May the Avins, Sarasvati and Sutraman Indra the Vrtra-killer enjoy them; may they drink the sweet wine</span>, become exhilarated and enjoy. O Hotr, do you recite the yajya. The Hotr recites the yajya, &#8216;O Asvins, do you favour us with your deed like the parents their son. O Indra, when thou didst consume the Sura-soma in order to achieve good deeds and to possess powers, Sarasvati healed thee&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Chintaman Ganesh Kashikar</p>

<h2><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sautramani and Rajasuya Sacrifices</span></strong></h2>
<p>Wine and Soma are used in the Sautramani sacrifice. Yajur Veda chapters 19 and 21 deal with offering and consumption of Sura (liquor) and Soma mixture in sacrifices like Sautramani, Rajasuya and offerings to departed manes. Satapatha Brahmana, Kanda 12, Adhayaya 7, Brahmana 3, Verses 1-22 describes the Sautramani ritual. It is stated in the same chapter in verse 4 that Sautramani is to be performed to get rid of enemies. Yajur Veda describes the Sautramani sacrifice which is further elaborated in the Srauta Sutra and Brahmana. Indra, Ashwins, Saraswati, and Agni were the first to perform this sacrifice, Veda states that they quaffed Sura-Soma mixture. And that’s how this sacrifice started, Sura-Soma mixture is offered to deities as well as to one&#8217;s ancestors and it is to be consumed by the Brahmin priests as well.</p>
<p><strong>Preparation of Sura (liquor) in the Sautramani sacrifice</strong></p>
<p>Baudhayana Srauta Sutra XXVI.22 &#8220;The Sura to be prepared for the Sautramani contains the grains as one fourth part or one fifth part, sprouting grass and young blades: The sprouting grass is of barley and young blades are of paddy. Beans are intended for fermentation. Now this filtering basket is wooden or of split bamboo or earthen; it has however a leather spread over it. This (sacrificer) is one who has pressed Soma and who has also filtered wine. The pressing leads him to the yonder world; the filtering of wine grants him welfare here.&#8221; Tr. C.G. Kashikar</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana, Kanda 12, Adhayaya 8, Brahmana 2, verses 8-11 &#8220;The malted rice, indeed, is of the form of the morning-pressing, for the morning-pressing is this (terrestrial) world, and the latter relates to the Asvins, and Âsvina milk he pours (into the Surâ-liquor) the first night: he thus provides him (the Sacrificer 1) with the morning-pressing&#8211;with its own world, with its own deity, with its own form. And the malted barley is of the form of the midday-pressing, for the midday-pressing is the air, and the latter relates to Sarasvatî and the Sârasvata milk he pours (into the Surâ) the second night: he thus provides him with the midday-pressing&#8211;with its own world, with its own deity, with its own form. And the fried rice is of the form of the evening-pressing, for the evening-pressing is the sky, and the latter relates to Indra, and Aindra milk he pours (into the Surâ) the third night: he thus provides him with the evening-pressing&#8211;with its own world, with its own deity, with its own form. The milk of one (cow) he pours (into the Surâ) the first night, the milk of two the second night, and the milk of three the third night: he thus provides him with the pressings, in accordance with their forms, and in accordance with their deities.&#8221; Tr. Julius Eggeling</p>

<p><strong>Details on the offering of Sautramani Sacrifice</strong></p>
<p>I will be mentioning some verses from Yajur Veda chapter 19 and I will also add elaborations of those verses from Satapatha Brahmana, Baudhayana Srauta Sutra and Sankhayana Srauta Sutra. I will underline those sentences of Brahmana and Srauta Sutra which are taken from the Vedas.</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 19.1 &#8220;Sweet with the sweet, I sprinkle thee with Soma, strong with the strong, the nectar with the nectar, the honey-sweet with what is sweet as honey, Soma art thou. Get dressed for the Asvins. Get dressed for Sarasvati. Get dressed for Indra and the Good Deliverer.&#8221; Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith<br />

<p>Above Hindi translation is by Swami Karpatri Maharaj. This verse elaborated in Satapatha Brahmana as,</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana, Kanda 12, Adhyaya 7, Brahmana 3, Verses 5-6 “With (Vâg. S. XIX, 1), <span style="text-decoration: underline;">&#8216;Thee, the sweet (liquor I mix) with the sweet (Soma)</span>,&#8217; <span style="color: #ff0000;">he compounds (the ingredients for the preparation of) the Surâ-liquor, and makes it </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">palatable</span>;&#8211;&#8216;the strong with the strong,&#8217; he thereby bestows energy on him (the Sacrificer);&#8211;&#8216;the immortal with the immortal,&#8217; he thereby bestows life on him &#8216;the honeyed with the honeyed,&#8217; he thereby bestows flavour to it (the liquor);&#8211;&#8216;I mix with the Soma,&#8217; he thereby makes it (the Surâ-liquor) a form of Soma. &#8216;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Thou art Soma: get thee matured for the Asvins! get thee matured for Sarasvatî! get thee matured for Indra Sutrâman!</span>&#8216; for these were the deities who first prepared that sacrifice, and with their help he now prepares it; and, moreover, he thereby provides these deities with their share. He distils it with a view to (its being like) the Soma-pressing. For three nights it remains standing, for the Soma remains standing for three nights after it has been bought: he thus makes it a form of Soma.” Tr. Julius Eggeling</p>
<p>Mahidhara a commentator on Veda writes on Yajur Veda 19.1 about the preparation of the Sura,</p>
<p>“Having purchased (a) malted rice (sashpa), malted barley (tokma), and fried rice (lâgâh), and (b) various vegetable substances (called with the generic name of nagnahu) serving as spices and ferments, such as the bark of Vatica robusta, three myrobalans (nutmeg, areca-nut, and cloves), ginger, hog-weed, &amp;c., he takes them into the fire-house, and pounds the two lots separately. He then prepares two gruels or mashes of rice and millet respectively, adding more water than is ordinarily used, puts them on the fire till they boil over, and catches the overflowing water in two separate vessels. He then acids thereto one-third part of the (still separate) pounded malted rice and barley and fried rice (or one-sixth part into each vessel), and likewise one-half of the spice (or one-fourth part into each vessel): this mixture, called mâsara (serving both as malt and as flavouring matter), is allowed to dry and is then pounded. One-half of the remaining pounded malted rice and barley and fried rice, as well as the whole of the remaining spices, is then, in equal parts, added to the two mashes, which are thereupon poured into a large vessel, after which the pounded &#8216;mâsara&#8217; is mixed with the compound whilst the above formula is pronounced; and the pot is deposited in a hole dug in the south-western corner of the fire-shed (sâlâ), where it remains standing for three days (and nights), during which the milk of one, two, and three cows respectively, and the remaining quantities of malted and fried grain are gradually added to it.” Tr. Julius Eggeling</p>
<p>Asking the Soma to get dressed is probably talking about fermentation as stated in the Baudhaya Srauta Sutra which is an elaboration of Yajur Veda 19.1,</p>
<p>Baudhayana Srauta Sutra XVII.32 &#8220;&#8230;He piles the cooked rice around the wooden filter. Having covered it, he touches it with the formula, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">&#8216;Thou art Soma; do thou be fermented for the Asvins, fermented for Sarasvati, fermented for Sutraman Indra</span>.&#8217; The Sura mixed up together is retained for three consecutive (nights). &#8216;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Soma, after having been purchased, stays on for three nights</span>.&#8217; So says the Brahmana. When it dawns after three nights, an animal-sacrifice of three or four animals is performed. The alter prescribed for the Sautramani is measured for the sacrificer on the preceeding day. Having strewn it around, he carries the Stambayajus.&#8221; Tr. Chintaman Ganesh Kashikar</p>
<p>The Black Yajur Veda 6.1.6.5 gives mythical reason behind keeping Soma for three days/nights which shall be discussed later in this article.</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 19.4-5 &#8220;By means of this eternal sieve may Sûrya&#8217;s Daughter purify The Soma that flows forth from thee. Soma with Wine, pressed; filtered for the banquet, cleanses priest, noble, brilliancy and vigour.&#8221; Tr. Ralph. T.H. Griffith</p>

<p>Satapatha Brahmana elaborates these verses as,</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana, Kanda 12, Adhyaya 7, Brahmana 3, Verse 12 “With (Vag. S. XIX, 4), &#8216;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">She purifieth thy liquor</span>.&#8217; purifies (the Sura) in the case of one wishing for prosperity:- &#8216;thy Soma, she, the daughter of Surya:&#8217; the daughter of Surya (the sun) assuredly is Faith, and by faith that (liquor) becomes Soma-juice, and by faith he makes it to be Soma-juice; &#8216;with the perpetual tail,&#8217; for with a tail-whisk that (liquor) is purified. With (Vâg. S. XIX, 5), <span style="text-decoration: underline;">&#8216;The Brahman and Kshatra he purifieth</span>,&#8217; he purifies the milk: he thus produces the Kshatra from out of the Brahman, for from out of the priesthood the nobility is produced;&#8211;&#8216;the fiery spirit and energy;&#8217; fiery spirit and energy, vital power, he thus bestows on him;&#8211;&#8216;with the Surâ the Soma,&#8217; for with the Surâ-liquor is Soma;&#8211;&#8216;the juice, is distilled,&#8217; for from the distilled the juice is obtained;&#8211;&#8216;for joy,&#8217; to joy (intoxication), indeed, the Soma juice contributes, and to joy also does the Surâ-liquor: he thus secures both the joy of the Soma, and the joy of the Surâ;&#8211;&#8216;with the pure juice, O god, satiate the deities!&#8217; that is, &#8216;with the pure juice satisfy thou the deities;&#8217;&#8211;&#8216;with sap bestow thou food on the Sacrificer,&#8217; sap and food he thereby bestows on the Sacrificer. The cups of milk are taken first, then the cups of Surâ-liquor: he thereby makes the peasantry obedient to the nobility.” Tr. Julius Eggeling</p>
<p>Baudhayana Saruta Sutra elaborates it as,</p>
<p>Baudhayana Srauta Sutra XVII.34 &#8221; While the Adhvaryu is engaged in his duties, the Pratiprashatr filers the wine by means of the woollen filter with its fringe towards the north, with the verse, &#8216;May the daughter of Surya filter O Indra for thee the mixture of wine regarded as Soma with the evernew woollen filter.&#8217; If the sacrificer is purged of Soma (he shall filter it) with the verse, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">&#8216;The swift wine, cleansed by the filter, the associate friend of Indra has passed downwards</span>&#8230;&#8221; Tr.

<p>Yajur Veda 19.7 “For each of you is made a God-appointed place: so grant to me a portion in the highest sphere. Surâ the strong art thou. This here is Soma. Entering thine own place do me no mischief.” Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>

<p>This is elaborated in the Satapatha Brahman,</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana, Kanda 12, Adhyaya 7, Brahmana 3, Verse 14-15 “With (Vâg. S. XIX, 7), &#8216;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Separately, indeed, a seat, acceptable to the gods, hath been prepared for you two</span>,&#8217; he fills the (three) cups of Surâ-liquor; for separate, indeed, are the Soma-juice and the Surâ-liquor; and &#8216;acceptable to the gods&#8217; he says, because these two are indeed acceptable to the gods; and &#8216;separately a seat hath been prepared&#8217; he says, because there are two altar-grounds;&#8211;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">&#8216;do not ye mingle in the highest heaven</span>!&#8217; he thereby keeps him (the Sacrificer) from evil;&#8211;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">&#8216;the potent Surâ-liquor thou art</span>,&#8217; he thereby makes Surâ to be Surâ;&#8211;&#8216;and this is Soma,&#8217; he thereby makes Soma to be Soma;&#8211;&#8216;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">entering thine own seat, injure me not</span>!&#8217; he thereby turns it (the Surâ-liquor) away to its own seat for his own safety. With a single (verse) he fills them: singly and solely on the Sacrificer he thus bestows fame, for the Surâ-liquor is fame. Verily, the cups of milk are the nobility (chieftaincy), and the cups of Surâ-liquor are the peasantry (clan): thus, were he to draw (the cups) without interlinking them, he would detach the peasantry from the nobility, and the nobility from the peasantry, and would cause confusion between the higher and lower, and a failure of the sacrifice. He draws them so as to be interlinked and thereby combines the peasantry with the nobility, and the nobility with the peasantry, for the prevention of confusion between the higher and lower, and for the success of the sacrifice.&#8221; Tr. Julius Eggeling</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana 12:7:3:8 “There are both milk and Surâ-liquor; for milk is Soma, and the Surâ-liquor food: through the milk he secures the Soma-drink, and through the Surâ-liquor food. And milk is the nobility (chieftaincy), and Surâ-liquor the peasantry (clan); the milk he purifies after purifying the Surâ-liquor: he thus produces the nobility from out of the peasantry, for the nobility is produced from out of the peasantry.” Tr. Julius Eggeling</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Yajur Veda 19.7 is also elaborated in Aitareya Brahmana which explains the Rajasuya sacrifice. In the consecration ceremony (Rajasuya?) of king mentioned in Aitareya Brahmana, the king is required to drink Sura (liquor) along with Soma which is given by the Brahmin priest,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Aitareya Brahmana, Book 8, Chapter 2, Para 8 “…The spirituous liquor represents the Kshattra, and further, the juice in the food; thus both the Kshattra and the juice in the food, are placed in him…Now he gives into his hand a goblet of spirituous liquor, under the recital of the verse, svadishthaya madishthaya, (9.1.1) i.e. ‘Purify, O Soma! with thy sweetest most exhilarating drops (the sacrificer), thou who art squeezed for Indra, to be drunk by him.’ After having put the spirituous liquor into his hand, the priest repeats a propitiatory mantra (which runs thus): <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">‘To either of you (spirituous liquor and Soma!) a separate residence has been prepared, and allotted by the gods. Do not mix with one another in the highest heaven; liquor! thou art powerful; Soma! thou art a king. Do not harm him (the king)! may either go to his own place</span><span style="color: #444444;">.’ </span>(Here is said), that the drinking of the<span style="color: #444444;"> </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Soma and that of liquor, exclude one another (they are not to be mixed). After having drunk it</span><span style="color: #444444;">…</span>Thus he finally places the liquor in his friend (gives him a share in it).” Tr. Martin Haug</span></p>
<p>Chapter 20 of Aitareya Brahmana deals with the pouring of various liquids over the king’s head by the priest and also deals with the drinking of liquor. By means of Mantra the liquor was transformed into real Soma which is then drunk by the king,</p>
<p>Aitareya Brahmana, Book 8, chapter 4, Para 20 “…Then the priest gives into his hands a goblet filled with spirituous liquor, repeating the mantra, svadishthaya. He then should drink the remainder (after previous libations to the gods)…<span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Soma beverage which is (in a mystical way) contained in the spirituous liquor, is thus drunk by the king</span>, who is inaugurated by means of Indra’s inauguration ceremony (the ceremony just described)…The drinking of spirituous liquor, or Soma, or the enjoyment of some other exquisite food, affects the body of the Kshattriya who is inaugurated by means of Indra’s great inauguration ceremony…” Tr. Martin Haug</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 19.7 is also elaborated in Baudhayana Srauta Sutra,</p>
<p>Baudhayana Srauta Sutra XVII.36 “(He recites) the verse) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">&#8216;Do you offer heartfelt sweet praise to Agni the drinker of wine, receiving Soma on the surface, the creator of all and whom horses, oxen, bulls, barren cows, sheeps released (by the sacrificer) are offered</span>,&#8217; and makes the offering at the second Vasat-uttering. He pours down the remnants of the cup for the Asvins into that for Sarasvati; the remnants of the cup for Sarasvati into that for Indra. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">A brahmana consumes it with the two verses</span>: &#8216;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">(O Sura and Soma) god has erected separate resorts for you; do not be mixed up in the high above. Thou art powerful Sura; this is Soma. Entering into thy own abode, do not injure me</span>. Whatever has remained here out of the juicy pressed drink, which Indra rank for his powers&#8230;He fills in the cups with the sediment of the Sura; he fixes the feath of the eagle into the cup of Butea frondosa&#8230;.He takes the sura with the excessive substance and pours it inot the sieve of a hundred pores with the formula, &#8216;O Pitrs with Soma as the first, be gratified.&#8217; When the liquid passes through the sieve, all offer prayers with eight verses&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Chintaman Ganesh Kashikar</p>
<p>Above passage from Baudhayana is also an elaboration of following Yajur Veda verses,</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 20.76-78 &#8220;Ye Asvins and Sarasvati, joint drinkers of the Sura draught, In Namuchi of Asura birth, gave aid to Indra in his deeds. As parents aid a son, both Asvins aided thee, Indra, with their wondrous powers and wisdom. When thou with might hadst drunk the draught that gladdens, Sarasvati, O Bounteous Lord, refereshed thee. He in whom horses, bulls, oxen, and barren cows, and rams, when duly set apart, are offered up, To Agni, Soma-sprinkled, drinker of sweet juice, Disposer, with thy heart bring forth a pleasant hymn.&#8221; Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>Griffith has translated the word “Sura” as “Draught” and “Sweet juice” here. Part of the above passage where Ashwins are said to have helped Indra to kill Namuchi is also mentioned in Baudhayana Srauta Sutra XVII.35 and Yajur Veda 20.59 which I have quoted in this article and let me again quote a few sentences of Baudhayana for your ease,</p>
<p>Baudhayana Srauta Sutra XVII.35 “…Getting up taking the two cups, the Adhvaryu says &#8216;Do you recite the puronuvakya for the Sura-soma taken for the Asvins, Sarasvati and Sutraman Indra. &#8216;The Maitravruna recites as the puronuvakya the verse, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">&#8216;O Asvins the guardians of the auspicious, do you two partaking of the Sura-soma in association with the demon Namuci help Indra in his deeds</span>.&#8217; Having crossed the alter and having caused to announce, he says (to the Maitravaruna), &#8216;Do you impel (the Hotr to recite the yajya for the Sura-soma set forth for the Asvins, Sarasvati and Sutraman Indra.&#8217; The Maitravaruna pronounces the call, &#8216;Let the Hotr recite the yajya for the Asvins, Sarasvati and Sutraman Indra. These Sura-soma (o gods) set forth for you-powerful, exhilerating, prepared out of the mixture&#8230;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">May the Avins, Sarasvati and Sutraman Indra the Vrtra-killed enjoy them; may they drink the sweet wine</span>, become exhilarated and enjoy. O Hotr, do you recite the yajya. The Hotr recites the yajya, &#8216;O Asvins, do you favour us with your deed like the parents their son. O Indra, when thou didst consume the Sura-soma in order to achieve good deeds and to possess powers, Satasvati healed thee&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Chintaman Ganesh Kashikar</p>
<p>Sankhayana elaborates it as,</p>
<p>Sankhayana Srauta Sutra XV.15.1-14 &#8220;Now the sautramani. (The victims at this occasion are) a red he goat for the Asvins, a ewe for Sarasvati, a bull for Indra the protecting (sutraman) After encircling with the firebrand has been performed on these, they proceed with the surasoma. Over the flowing (sura) they mutter&#8230;Or the verses addressed to the Fathers. The inviting (verse for the libation of the sura is) &#8216;Ye both, O Asvins, the cheering)&#8217; The formula of prompting is Let the hotr worship the Asvins, Sarasvati, Indra the protecting&#8230;The mantra to accompany the partaking of the sura is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">&#8216;The (Soma), which the Asvins took from the asura Namuci which Sarasvati pressed out to obtain</span> strength, this king Soma the bright, sweet drop, I here partake of.&#8217; If he starts from the moaning that <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">a brahmana must be engaged for a reward to drink the (remainings of the) sura</span>, the beverage (the rest of the sura) is poured out for him.&#8221; Tr. W. Caland</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 19.32 &#8220;The rite with sacred grass, wine, store of heroes, the mighty ones speed on with adorations. May we, sweet-singing sacrificers, setting Soma mid Gods in heaven, give joy to Indra.&#8221; Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith<br />

<p>Satapatha Brahmana elaborates on this verse as,</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana, Kanda 12, Adhayaya 8, Brahmana 1, verse 2 &#8220;He (the Adhvaryu) offers (of the three cups of milk) with (Vâg. S. XIX, 32), &#8216;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">By their devotions the buffalos quicken the sacrifice</span>,&#8217;&#8211;the buffalos, doubtless, are the officiating priests, and devotion is sacrifice: through the priests he causes the sacrifice to prosper, and through the sacrifice the sacrificer;&#8211;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">&#8216;the barhis-seated one, supplied with Surâ and goodly heroes</span>,&#8217; supplied with Surâ, indeed, is this barhis-seated sacrifice, to wit, the Sautrâmanî: by means of the barhis (the sacred grass on the Vedi), and the sacrifice, he causes him to prosper;&#8211;&#8216;they who bestow Soma,&#8217;&#8211;they thus bestow the Soma-drink upon him;&#8211;&#8216;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">with the deities in heaven</span>,&#8217;&#8211;they thus place him with the deities in heaven;&#8211;&#8216;may we enjoy ourselves,&#8217;&#8211;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">the Soma-juice, indeed, conduces to joy, and so does the Surâ-liquor</span>: both the joy of Soma and the joy of Surâ he thus secures;&#8211;&#8216;worshipping Indra with good hymns of praise!&#8217;&#8211;for the hymn of praise is food for the gods, and the sacrifice also is food: by sacrifice, by food, he thus makes him successful. Having sacrificed, they drink (of the milk), and thereby increase what is prosperous with him.&#8221; Tr. Julius Eggeling</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 19.33 “All essence of thine own in plants collected, all strength of Soma when poured out with Surâ—Therewith impel with joy the sacrifice, Sarasvatî, the Asvins, Indra, Agni.” Tr. Ralph T.H Griffith<br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="508" height="108" class="wp-image-8888 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Picture-10-508w108h.jpeg" alt="yv 19.33 Swami Karpatri" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Picture-10-508w108h.jpeg 508w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Picture-10-508w108h-300x64.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 508px) 100vw, 508px" /></p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana elaborates it as,</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana, Kanda 12, Adhayaya 8, Brahmana 1, Verse 12 &#8220;He (the Pratiprasthâtri) offers (libations from the cups of Surâ-liquor), with (Vâg. S. XIX, 33), <span style="text-decoration: underline;">&#8216;What essence there is of thine, gathered from the plants</span>,&#8217; for this Surâ-liquor, indeed, is the essence of both the waters and the plants: by the essence of both the waters and the plants he thus causes him to prosper;&#8211;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">&#8216;the strength of the Soma-juice together with the Surâ-liquor</span>,&#8217;&#8211;he thereby secures what strength there is in the Soma-juice and in the Surâ-liquor;&#8211;&#8216;by that exhilarating drink quicken thou the Sacrificer,&#8217;&#8211;that is, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">&#8216;by that exhilarating drink gladden thou the Sacrificer;&#8217;&#8211;&#8216;Sarasvatî, the Asvins, Indra, and Agni</span>,&#8217;&#8211;by deities he (the priest) thus causes the sacrifice to prosper, and by deities and sacrifice the Sacrificer. Having made the offering, they drink (the liquor), and thereby cause to prosper what is unprosperous with him.&#8221; Tr. Julius Eggeling</p>
<p>Veda also mentions offering liquor to departed manes. The sacrificer is not supposed to drink liquor as it is meant only for offering in this case,</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 19.36 &#8220;To Fathers who claim Svadha be Svadha and homage! To Grandfathers who claim Svadha be Svadha and homage! To Great-grandfathers who claim Svadha be Svadha and homage! The Fathers have eaten. The Fathers have rejoiced. The Fathers have been satisfied. Fathers, be ye purified.&#8221; Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>It is elaborated in the Satapatha Brahmana,</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana, Kanda 12, Adhayaya 8, Brahmana 1, verses 6-8 “…this Soma-drink falls to the share of the fathers and grandfathers of whoever drinks (the liquor) on this occasion. Having shifted three coals of the southern fire to outside the enclosing-stones 1, he may there offer (of the liquor) with these (three) utterances (Vâg. S. XIX, 36):&#8211; &#8216;To the Svadhâ-loving Fathers be Svadhâ, adoration!&#8217; he thereby places the Fathers with the Svadhâ in the world of the Fathers.&#8211;&#8216;To the Svadhâ-loving grandfathers he Svadhâ, adoration!&#8217; he thereby places the grandfathers with the Svadhâ in the world of the grandfathers.&#8211;&#8216;To the Svadhâ-loving great-grandfathers be Svadhâ, adoration!&#8217; he thereby places the great-grandfathers with the Svadhâ in the world of the great-grandfathers. Having fetched water, he pours it (into the cups) with, &#8216;The Fathers have drunk:&#8217; he thereby bestows food on them;&#8211;&#8216;the Fathers have enjoyed themselves:&#8217; he thereby causes them to enjoy themselves;&#8211;&#8216;the Fathers have become satisfied:&#8217; he thereby satisfies them;&#8211;&#8216;may the Fathers cleanse themselves!&#8217; he thereby purifies all of them from the first downwards, for the Sautrâmanî is a means of purification.&#8221; Tr. Julius Eggeling</p>
<p>The following verse is about offering various animals to Vedic deities, it is also about offering liquor and asking them to drink it,</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 21.29-31 &#8220;Let the Hotar sacrifice with fuel to Agni in the place of libation, to the Asvins, Indra, Sarasvatî. A grey-coloured he-goat with wheat, jujube-fruit and sprouts of rice becomes a sweet salutary remedy, splendour, might, milk, Soma. Let them enjoy sweet butter with foaming liquor. Hotar, present offerings of butter. Let the Hotar, Tanunapat, worship Sarasvati. A sheep, a ram, a salutary remedy on the honey-sweet path, bearing to the Asvins and Indra heroic strength, with jujebe-fruit, Indra-grains, sprouts of rice, becomes a salutary remedy, milk, Soma. Let them enjoy Sweet butter with foaming liquor. Hotar, present offerings of butter&#8230;Let the Hotar, magnified with oblations, offering sacrifice, worship Sarasvati and Indra, increasing them with strength, with a bull and a cow. Strength and medicine to the Asvins and Indra are meath with jujube-fruit, Masara with parched grain, milk, Soma. Let them enjoy sweet butter with foaming liquor&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>It is elaborated in Sankhayana as,</p>
<p>Sankhayana Srauta Sutra XIV.13.1-9 &#8220;At this rite two animals a grey he goat to the Asvins a ewe to Sarasvati, are immolated in addition to the savana victim. To Indra Sutraman a barren cow of the same kind is immolated in addition to the usual one. The reason why these victims are thus tied (and slaughtered) is the wish not to depart from the sautramani. After the Savana cakes of the morning (service) they put the fuel to the fire outside and go on with the (i.e. pour out the libation of) surasoma&#8230;Now, in that for Indra Sutraman a barren cow is immolated in addition to the usual one, (the reason thereof is) along with Indra Sutraman the sautramani is completed.&#8221; Tr. W. Caland</p>
<p>Baudhayana Srauta Sutra elaborates these verses as,</p>
<p>Baudhayana Srauta Sutra XVII.35 &#8220;He carried those (cups) towards the east or north along the rear of the handles of the ladles. He takes the wine together with excessive substance and moves towards the southern fire&#8230;he formally dedicates the animals a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">gray coloured (goat) to the Asvins, a male sheep to Sarasvati and a bull to Indra</span>. He dedicates a goat to Brhaspati as the fourth animal if the sacrificer has purged Soma. After having offered their omenta as prescribed, the Adhvaryu takes up the cups for the Asvins and Sarasvati; the Pratiprasthatr takes the one for Indra. Getting up taking the two cups, the Adhvaryu says &#8216;Do you recite the puronuvakya for the Sura-soma taken for the Asvins, Sarasvati and Sutraman Indra. &#8216;The Maitravruna recites as the puronuvakya the verse, &#8216;O Asvins the guardians of the auspicious, do you two partaking of the Sura-soma in association with the demon Namuci help Indra in his deeds.&#8217; Having crossed the alter and having caused to announce, he says (to the Maitravaruna), &#8216;Do you impel (the Hotr to recite the yajya for the Sura-soma set forth for the Asvins, Sarasvati and Sutraman Indra.&#8217; The Maitravaruna pronounces the call, &#8216;Let the Hotr recite the yajya for the Asvins, Sarasvati and Sutraman Indra. These Sura-soma (o gods) set forth for you-powerful, exhilerating, prepared out of the mixture&#8230;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">May the Avins, Sarasvati and Sutraman Indra the Vrtra-killer enjoy them; may they drink the sweet wine</span>, become exhilarated and enjoy. O Hotr, do you recite the yajya. The Hotr recites the yajya, &#8216;O Asvins, do you favour us with your deed like the parents their son. O Indra, when thou didst consume the Sura-soma in order to achieve good deeds and to possess powers, Sarasvati healed thee&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Chintaman Ganesh Kashikar</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana, Kanda 12, Adhayaya 8, Brahmana 2, verse 15 &#8220;All (the praishas) contain (the word) &#8216;payas&#8217; (milk), for in the form of milk Soma is (here) pressed; they all contain (the word) &#8216;Soma,&#8217; for the sake of (conformity with) the Soma-pressing; they all contain (the word) &#8216;parisrut&#8217; (spirituous liquor), for in the form of spirituous liquor Soma is (here) pressed; they all contain (the word) &#8216;ghrita&#8217; (ghee), for this&#8211;to wit, ghee&#8211;doubtless is manifestly a form of the sacrifice: he thus makes it to be manifestly a form of the sacrifice; they all contain (the word) &#8216;madhu&#8217; (honey), for this&#8211;to wit, honey&#8211;is manifestly a form of Soma: he thus makes it to be manifestly a form of Soma.&#8221; Tr. Julius Eggeling</p>
<p>Yajur Veda verse mentions the word Parisrut which is a semi-fermented liquor according to the translator Julius Eggeling while Griffith translates it as foaming liquor. Both the sacrificer and priests have to drink Parisrut liquor offered to gods,</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana, Kanda 12, Adhayaya 8, Brahmana 2, verse 21 &#8220;This Sautrâmanî, then, is manifestly a Soma-sacrifice; and were the Sacrificer alone to drink (the liquor), it would be either an ishti-offering, or an animal sacrifice; but, for the sake of conformity of the liquor) to the Soma, all the priests drink thereof, for all the priests drink of the Soma-juice.&#8221; Tr. Julius Eggeling</p>
<p>Following Yajur Veda verses states that Agni, Sarasvati and Indra had drunk the Sura-Soma mixture,</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 21.59-60 “To-day this Sacrificer cooking viands, cooking sacrificial rice-cakes, binding a goat for the Asvins, a ram for Sarasvatî, a hull for Indra, pressing Surâ and Soma juices for the Asvins, Sarasvatî, and Indra the Good Deliverer, has chosen Agni as Hotar. To-day the divine Vanaspatî has done good service to the Asvins with a goat, to Sarasvatî with a ram, to Indra with a bull. They have eaten these from the marrow onwards, they have accepted the cooked viands, they have waxed strong with the rice-cakes. The Agnis, Sarasvatî, and Indra have drunk the Surâ and Soma draughts.” Tr. Ralph. T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>The following is the Hindi translation by Dr. Ganga Sahay Sharma,</p>

<p>This is in continuation from verse 1, so supplementary texts mentioned for Yajur Veda 21.29-31 can be read for understanding above Yajur Veda 21.59-60 verses.</p>
<p>Also check the meaning of Sura given by Panini in his Ashtadhyayi and Hindu reformer Kumarila Bhatta in his Tantra Vartika.</p>
<h2>Parisrut</h2>
<p>Julius Eggeling writes in the footnotes of Satapatha Brahmana, &#8220;According to Sayana, the difference between sura and parisrut would seem to be that the former beverage is prepared from mature shoots (of rice, &amp;c.), and the latter from such as are not quite ripe.&#8221; It is stated that Parisrut is neither Soma nor Sura. Parisrut seems to have been a semi-fermented liquor. Also see Yajur Veda 21.29 which is mentioned in the category Sautramani sacrifice and is further elaborated in Brahmana and Srauta Sutra. Satapatha Brahmana, Kanda 12, Adhayaya 8, Brahmana 2, verse 15 also mentions drinking Soma and Parisrut in Sautramani ritual.</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 20.59-65 The Asvins brought from Namuchi pressed Soma bright with <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">foaming juice</span>. Sarasvatî with sacred grass brought that to Indra for his drink. The Asvins, and the Three, apart, Sarasvatî, Idâ, Bhâratî, As drink to gladden Indra, poured strong Soma with the foaming juice. Praising with <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">foaming liquor</span> at due times, Indra, Vanaspatî, Sarasvatî as cow gave forth sweet beverage with the Asvins Twain.&#8221; Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>Read Baudhayana Srauta Sutra XVII.35 and Sankhayana Srauta Sutra XV.15.1-14 mentioned above which elaborates Yajur Veda 20.59-65. Griffith has translated the word Parisrut as foaming juice as well as foaming liquor.</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 19.95 &#8220;Splendour of victims, powerful oblation, honey and meath with milk and foaming liquor, Healing Sarasvatî effused, and Asvins; from pressed and unpressed Soma, deathless Indu.&#8221; Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 2.34 &#8220;Bearers of vigour and immortal fatness, milk and sweet beverage and foaming liquor, ye are a freshening draught. Delight my Fathers.&#8221; Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>Julius Eggeling in his translation of Satapatha Brahmana mentions Katyayana Samhita in the footnotes which elaborates the above Yajur Veda verse as,</p>
<p>Kâtyâyana Samhita IV, I, 15 “Having made (them) wash themselves as before, and having loosened (visramsya) the tuck, he makes obeisance with &#8216;adoration to your vigour, O fathers!&#8217; &amp;c. (Vâg. S. II, 32 a-f)&#8230; He pours [the water, left in the pitcher, on the cakes] with &#8216;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ye (O waters) are a refreshing draught, ye, that bring sap, immortal ghee and milk and foaming mead: gladden my fathers!&#8217; (Vâg. S. II, 34.)</span> 20, [The Adhvaryu] having laid (the cakes on the dish) the sacrificer smells at them. 21, The firebrand and the once-cut stalks of grass (he throws) into the fire. 22, The wife, if desirous of a son, eats the middle cake with, &#8216;Bestow offspring on me, O fathers, a boy crowned with lotuses; that there may he a man here!&#8217; (Vâg. S. II, 33.)…” Tr. Julius Eggeling</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 19.79 &#8220;Seeing the foaming liquor&#8217;s sap, Prajapati with the bright drank out the bright, the milk, the Soma juice, the Soma juice, BY Law, etc.&#8221; Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>

<p>Griffith has translated the word Parisrut as foaming drink in this verse and in the footnotes, he provides an explanation,</p>
<p>&#8220;Foaming drink: parisutas; a beverage prepared from herbs, a sort of beer.&#8221;</p>

<h1>Hindu Scriptures on Liquor Drinking</h1>
<p>Narada Purana not only allows one to drink liquor after offering it to gods but it also gives details on the preparation of three types of liquors,</p>
<p>Narada Purana III.90.11-22 &#8220;This Vidya is exhilarating as the intoxicating liquor. It is the means of crossing over distress. I shall now tell you the precise preparation of it. The liquor they classify into three types: Gaudi, Paisti and Madhvi. Put jaggery in hot water and stir it well. The pollen powder of the flower dhataki (grislea tomentosa) shall be put into it and the whole solution is kept in a glass jar. It is stored under ground but at dawn and at dusk the solution is stirred well with the hands. After a month is over when the sediments go to the bottom, it is filtered. This can be used for worship. This is called Gaudi because it is prepared from Guda. Similarly, that which is got by adding honey is called Madhvi. O dear one, listen to the Paisti variety. Rice should be boiled slowly and cooked in two and a half times more water (than the rice). It should be left over for three days. Then the powdered sprout of the embylic Myrobalan is put into it. Keep this in an airy place for a day where there is not much of wind. Water is then poured into it and stirred well. This is then filtered. It is then called Paistika Madhu. Artificial liquor is prepared in two ways extracting from trees or squeezing from fruits. Listen to the mode of its preparation. By its taste the mind gets repose. Bunches of grapes, or date fruits or the flowers of Bassia latifolia are put into water and boiled to half the original quantity. To this add a small quantity of distilled spirit and keep it undisturbed for two days. After filtering the same it becomes tasty and auspicious, worthy of being offered for worship. I causes full repose of the mind. As to the second variety it is prepared from the coconut, Hintala or palm trees. The milk that exudes from the stalk of the fruit must be taken fresh from the tree. It is tasty. Take the water out of the coconut fruit. Put a little camphor therein. The juice of Arecanut half the quantity of the former. Mix both and keep it in the sunlight. This immediately becomes liquor which the gods are very fond of.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Another verse from Narada Purana permits one to drink a certain amount of liquor after offering it to deities,</p>
<p>Narada Purana III.90.23-28 &#8220;Or the devotee shall offer for the arghya to the goddess the liquor which has been mentioned here. It must be offered immediately which will be fruitful. The aspirant while remaining in trance should drink it always restricting his diet. Never should a siddha drink it unless it has been first offered to the goddess. It should be drunk until the mind is wholly absorbed in the Goddess. If he drinks more than that he shall become a sinner immediately. He who drinks wine with wilful desire without serving it to the god becomes a sinner. He should be punished by the king for he is the worshipper of avidya &#8230;The devotee with the previously-mentioned form should worship the deities of the above-mentioned forms. He should worship them in the proper sequence with the offering if wine, fish and meat duly consecrated.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Baudhayana Dharma Shastra permits the drinking of Rum only for South Indian Hindus,</p>
<p>Baudhayana Dharma Shastra, Prasna 1, Adhyaya 1, Kandika 1, verses 1-4 “There is a dispute regarding five (practices) both in the south and in the north…Now (the customs peculiar) to the north are, to deal in wool, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">to drink rum</span>, to sell animals that have teeth in the upper and in the lower jaws, to follow the trade of arms, to go to sea. He who follows (these practices) in any other country than where they prevail, commits sin.”</p>
<p>Indra questions Brihaspati about Asava (a type of liquor) and Brihaspati explains to him in detail and also about which type of liquor is permissible for Kshatriya, Vaishya after offering it to deities,</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana, Lalita-Mahatmya 7.63-76 &#8220;Indra said: &#8216;What is the nature of Asava? (Liquor). What is its defect? What is its merit? What type of cooked food is defective? Mention this in detail to me.&#8217; Brihaspati said: The different types of intoxicating beverages are as follows: Paiffika (made from flour or rice), Talaja (from the date palm), Kaira (cocounut palm-juice), Madhuka (made from honey or Madhuka flowers), Gudasambhava (prepared from molasses). In regard to sinful nature the later ones mentioned above are half as dreadful as the earlier ones. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Asava can be used as a beverage by the three castes beginning with the Ksatriyas</span>. Excepting a Brahmana lady, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">all women can drink liquors beginning with the third one i.e. Kaira (coconut palm juice, and prepared from honey and molasses)</span>. A widow, a virgin and a woman in her monthly period shall avoid drinking liquor. If a woman drinks liquor out of covetousness and not in the company of her husband, she is called Unmadini (a mad woman). One should avoid her like a Candala woman. The ratio of drinking liquors in the case of four castes beginning with the Brahmanas shall be ten to eight or six to four. In the case of women it shall be half of the above. If they drink in the company of their husbands it shall be one-fourth of the above. After drinking liquor out of delusion, a Brahmana should perform Krcchracandrayana expiation. Or he shall repeat Gayatri Mantra or Jatavedasa Mantra ten thousand times. If a man repeats Ambikahrdaya Mantra he shall become pure. A Ksatriya among the three castes shall be purified by repeating those Mantras half the number of times. In the case of women the number of repetitions shall be one-fourth or they can get the same done through Brahmanas. One should repeat the Mantras a thousand times under water and become purified thereby. Laksmi, Sarasvati, Gauri, Candika, Tripura, Ambika, Vaisnavi, Bhairavi, Kali and Mahendri are the mothers. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">There are other Sakti goddesses. In worshipping them the liquor prepared from honey is approved of</span>. A Brahmana who has mastered the Vedangas shall perform worship without wine &#8230;<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The base fellow who drinks liquor without worshipping Para Sakti </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">shall stay in hell called Raurava for a period calculated at the rate of a year for every d</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">r</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">op so consumed</span>.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Brahmins were not always barred from quaffing wine, in the Vedic period Kshatriyas and even Brahmins enjoyed wine especially after mixing it with Soma,</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 19.5 <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Soma with Wine, pressed</span>; filtered for the banquet, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">cleanses priest, noble</span>, brilliancy and vigour. God, with the Bright give Deities enjoyment: give food with flavour to the Sacrificer.</p>
<p>Following is the Sanskrit text with Hindi translation by Swami Karpatri Maharaj,</p>

<p>In the consecration ceremony (Rajasuya?) of the king mentioned in Aitareya Brahmana, the king is required to drink Sura (liquor) along with Soma which is given by the Brahmin priest,</p>
<p>Aitareya Brahmana, Book 8 , Chapter 2, Para 8 &#8220;&#8230;The spirituous liquor represents the Kshattra, and further, the juice in the food; thus both the Kshattra and the juice in the food, are placed in him&#8230;Now he gives into his hand a goblet of spirituous liquor, under the recital of the verse, svadishthaya madishthaya, (9.1.1) i.e. &#8216;Purify, O Soma! with thy sweetest most exhilarating drops (the sacrificer), thou who art squeezed for Indra, to be drunk by him.&#8217; After having put the spirituous liquor into his hand, the priest repeats a propitiatory mantra (which runs thus): <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">&#8216;To either of you (spirituous liquor and Soma!) a separate residence has been prepared, and allotted by the gods. Do not mix with one another in the highest heaven; liquor! thou art powerful; Soma! thou art a king. Do not harm him (the king)! may either go to his own place</span>.&#8217; (Here is said), that the drinking of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Soma and that of liquor, exclude one another (they are not to be mixed). After having drunk it</span>&#8230;Thus he finally places the liquor in his friend (gives him a share in it).” Tr. Martin Haug</p>
<p>Underlined sentences of the above passage are an elaboration of the following Yajur Veda verse,</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 19.7 For each of you is made a God-appointed place: so grant to me a portion in the highest sphere. Surâ the strong art thou. This here is Soma. Entering thine own place do me no mischief.</p>
<p>Following is the Sanskrit text along with the Hindi translation of Swami Karpatri Maharaj</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1239" height="345" class="wp-image-8892 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Picture-7-1.jpeg" alt="C:\Users\Hassan Razvi\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\INetCache\Content.Word\yv 19.7.jpg" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Picture-7-1.jpeg 1239w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Picture-7-1-300x84.jpeg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Picture-7-1-768x214.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1239px) 100vw, 1239px" /></p>
<p>Now, those who cry “fake translation” has no way to escape, Aitareya Brahmana attests Yajur Veda verse. Chapter 20 of Aitareya Brahmana deals with the pouring of various liquids over the king&#8217;s head by the priest and also deals with drinking liquor. By means of Mantra the liquor was transformed into real Soma which is then drunk by the king,</p>
<p>Aitareya Brahmana, Book 8, chapter 4, Para 20 &#8220;&#8230;Then the priest gives into his hands a goblet filled with spirituous liquor, repeating the mantra, svadishthaya. He then should drink the remainder (after previous libations to the gods)&#8230;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Soma beverage which is (in a mystical way) contained in the spirituous liquor, is thus drunk by the king</span>, who is inaugurated by means of Indra&#8217;s inauguration ceremony (the ceremony just described)&#8230;The drinking of spirituous liquor, or Soma, or the enjoyment of some other exquisite food, affects the body of the Kshattriya who is inaugurated by means of Indra&#8217;s great inauguration ceremony&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Martin Haug</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti prohibits all forms of wine for a Brahmin but permits certain types of liquor for Kshatriya and Vaishya,</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti 22.82-84 Distilled from sugar, or from the blossoms of the Madhûka. (Mâdhvi wine], or from flour: these three kinds of spirituous liquor have to be discerned; as one, so are all: none of them must be tasted by the twice-born. Again, distilled from the blossoms of the Madhûka tree (Madhûka wine), from molasses, from the fruits of the Tanka (or Kapittha tree), of the jujube tree, of the Khargûra tree, or of the breadfruit tree, from wine-grapes, from Madhûka blossoms (Mâdhvîka wine), Maireya, and the sap of the cocoanut tree: <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">These ten intoxicating drinks are unclean for a Brâhmana; but a Kshatriya and a Vaisya commit no wrong in touching (or drinking) them</span>.</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 5.56 There is no sin in eating meat, in (drinking) spirituous liquor, and in <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">carnal intercourse, for that is the natural way of created beings</span>, but abstention brings great rewards</p>
<p>Acharya Medhatithi writes on this verse that drinking wine is permissible for Kshatriyas. Arthashastra of Kautilya (Chanakya) allows the sale, purchase and drinking of liquor, it brings liquor manufacturers and shops under state regulation, an entire chapter is dedicated to it,</p>
<p>Kautilya’s Arthashastra, Book 2, chapter 25 “BY employing such men as are acquainted with the manufacture of liquor and ferments (kinva), the Superintendent of Liquor shall carry on liquor-traffic not only in forts and country parts, but also in camps. In accordance with the requirements of demand and supply (krayavikrayavasena) he may either centralize or decentralize the sale of liquor. A fine of 600 panas shall be imposed on all offenders other than those who are manufacturers, purchasers, or sellers in liquor-traffic. Liquor shall not be taken out of villages, nor shall liquor shops be close to each other. Lest workmen spoil the work in hand, and Aryas violate their decency and virtuous character, and lest firebrands commit indiscreet acts, liquor shall be sold to persons of well known character in such small quantities as one-fourth or half-a-kudumba, one kudumba, half-a-prastha, or one prastha. Those who are well known and of pure character may take liquor out of shop. Or all may be compelled to drink liquor within the shops and not allowed to stir out at once in view of detecting articles such as sealed deposits, unsealed deposits, commodities given for repair, stolen articles, and the like which the customer&#8217;s may have acquired by foul means. When they are found to possess gold and other articles not their own, the superintendent shall contrive to cause them to be arrested outside the shop. Likewise those who are too extravagant or spend beyond their income shall be arrested. No fresh liquor other than bad liquor shall be sold below its price. Bad liquor may be sold elsewhere or given to slaves or workmen in lieu of wages; or it may form the drink of beasts for draught or the subsistence of hogs. Liquor shops shall contain many rooms provided with beds and seats kept apart. The drinking room shall contain scents, garlands of flowers, water, and other comfortable things suitable to the varying seasons. Spies stationed in the shops shall ascertain whether the expenditure incurred by customers in the shop is ordinary or extraordinary and also whether there are any strangers. They shall also ascertain the value of the dress, ornaments, and gold of the customers lying there under intoxication. When customers under intoxication lose any of their things, the merchants of the shop shall not only make good the loss, but also pay an equivalent fine. Merchants seated in half-closed rooms shall observe the appearance of local and foreign customers who, in real or false guise of Aryas lie down in intoxication along with their beautiful mistresses. Of various kinds of liquor such as medaka, prasanna, ásava, arista, maireya, and madhu:&#8211; Medaka is manufactured with one drona of water, half, an ádaka of rice, and three prastha of kinva (ferment). Twelve ádhakas of flour (pishta), five prasthas of kinva (ferment), with the addition of spices (játisambhára) together with the bark and fruits of putraká (a species of tree) constitute prasanná. One-hundred palas of kapittha (Feronia Elephantum) 500 palas of phánita (sugar), and one prastha of honey (madhu) form ásava. With an increase of one-quarter of the above ingredients, a superior kind of ásava is manufactured; and when the same ingredients are lessened to the extent of one-quarter each, it becomes of an inferior quality. The preparation of various kinds of arishta for various diseases are to be learnt from physicians. A sour gruel or decoction of the bark of meshasringi (a kind of poison) mixed with jaggery (guda) and with the powder of long pepper and black pepper or with the powder of triphala (1 Terminalia Chebula, 2 Terminalia Bellerica, and 3 Phyllanthus Emblica) forms Maireya. To all kinds of liquor mixed with jaggery, the powder of triphala is always added. The juice of grapes is termed madhu. Its own native place (svadesa) is the commentary on such of its various forms as kápisáyana and hárahúraka. One drona of either boiled or unboiled paste of másha (Phraseolus Radiatus), three parts more of rice, and one karsha of morata (Alangium Hexapetalum) and the like form kinva (ferment). In the manufacture of medaka and prasanna, five karshas of the powder of (each of páthá (Clypea Hermandifolio), lodhra (Symplocos Racemosa), tejovati (Piper Chaba), eláváluka (Solanum Melongena) honey, the juice of grapes (madhurasa), priyangu (panic seeds), dáruharidra (a species of turmeric) black pepper and long pepper are added as sambhára, requisite spices. The decoction of madhúka (Bassia Latifolia) mixed with granulated sugar (katasarkará), when added to prasanna, gives it a pleasing colour. The requisite quantity of spices to be added to ásava is one karshá of the powder of each of chocha (bark of cinnamon), chitraka (Plumbago Zeylanica), vilanga, and gajapippalí (Scindapsus Officinalis), and two karshas of the powder of each of kramuka (betel nut), madhúka (Bassia Latifolia), mustá (Cyprus Rotundus), and lodhra (Symlocos Racemosa). The addition of one-tenth of the above ingredients (i.e., chocha, kramuka, etc.), is (termed) bíjabandha. The same ingredients as are added to prasanná are also added to white liquor (svetasurá). The liquor that is manufactured from mango fruits (sahakárasurá) may contain a greater proportion of mango essence (rasottara), or of spices (bíjottara). It is called mahásura when it contains sambhára (spices as described above). When a handful (antarnakho mushtih, i.e., so much as can be held in the hand, the fingers being so bent that the nails cannot be seen) of the powder of granulated sugar dissolved in the decoction of moratá (Alangium Hexapetalum), palása (Butea Frondosa), dattúra (Dattura Fastuosa), karanja (Robinia Mitis), meshasringa (a kind of poison) and the bark of milky trees (kshiravriksha) mixed with one-half of the paste formed by combining the powders of lodhra (Symplocos Racemosa), chitraka (Plumbago Zeylanica), vilanga, páthá (clypea Hermandifolia), mustá (cyprus Rotundus), kaláya (leguminous seeds), dáruharidra (Amonum Xanthorrhizon), indívara (blue lotus), satapushpa (Anethum Sowa), apámárga (Achyranthes Aspera) saptaparna (Echites Scholaris), and nimba (Nimba Melia) is added to (even) a kumbha of liquor payable by the king, it renders it very pleasant. Five palas of phánita (sugar) are added to the above in order to increase its flavour. On special occasions (krityeshu), people (kutumbinah, i.e., families) shall be allowed to manufacture white liquor (svetasura), arishta for use in diseases, and other kinds of liquor. On the occasions of festivals, fairs (samája), and pilgrimage, right of manufacture of liquor for four days (chaturahassaurikah) shall be allowed. The Superintendent shall collect the daily fines (daivasikamatyayam, i.e., license fees) from those who on these occasions are permitted to manufacture liquor. Women and children shall collect ‘sura,’ and ‘kinva,’ ‘ferment.’ Those who deal with liquor other than that of the king shall pay five percent as toll. With regard to sura, medaka, arishta, wine, phalámla (acid drinks prepared from fruits), and ámlasídhu (spirit distilled from molasses):&#8211; Having ascertained the day&#8217;s sale of the above kinds of liquor, the difference of royal and public measures (mánavyáji), and the excessive amount of sale proceeds realised thereby, the Superintendent shall fix the amount of compensation (vaidharana) due to the king (from local or foreign merchants for entailing loss on the king&#8217;s liquor traffic) and shall always adopt the best course.” Tr. R. Shamasastry</p>

<p>Satapatha Brahmana 12:7:3:88. There are both milk and Surâ-liquor; for milk is Soma, and the Surâ-liquor food: through the milk he secures the Soma-drink, and through the Surâ-liquor food. And milk is the nobility (chieftaincy), and Surâ-liquor the peasantry (clan); the milk he purifies after purifying the Surâ-liquor: he thus produces the nobility from out of the peasantry, for the nobility is produced from out of the peasantry.</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana also mentions Parishrut (spelt Parisrut) a type of liquor different from Sura,</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana 12:9:1:11. Verily, from this sacrifice the man is born and whatever food a man consumes in this world, that (food), in return, consumes him in yonder world. Now this sacrifice is performed by means of spirituous liquor, and spirituous liquor (parisrut is not to be consumed by a Brâhmana: he thus is born from that which is not (to be) consumed, and the food does not, in return, consume him in yonder world. Therefore this (sacrifice), the Sautrâmanî, is a Brâhmana&#8217;s sacrifice.</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana 5:1:2:14 …and the Parisrut-liquor is neither Soma nor Sura: this is why he buys the Parisrut for a piece of lead from a long haired man.</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana 5.5.4.19 &#8220;&#8230;Let him therefore rather throw them into the fermented liquor (Parisrut)&#8230;let him therefore throw it rather into the spirituous liquor.</p>

<h1>Soma</h1>
<p>Soma plant finds frequent mention in the Vedas. It was of great importance in the Vedic religion. Soma plant is said to have stems and leaves and used to grow in the mountains, Soma plant as a whole, as well as Soma Ras (juice), are also called Andhas. Soma the mythical plant is extinct. Let’s not discuss its botanical features since this article deals with only intoxication in Hinduism. Soma drink was prepared from the leaves of Soma plant by pressing them between stones. It was mixed with water, milk, curd and a few other edible things probably to lessen its intoxicating effect. As per Nirukta 11.2 the word Soma is derived from the root &#8220;Su&#8221; which means &#8220;To Press.&#8221; As per Nirukta 1.11 the word Sura (liquor prepared from grains) is also derived from the root &#8220;Su&#8221; which means &#8220;To press.&#8221; Both the words Sura and Soma are derived from the same root. Before we begin let’s have a look at what prominent Hindu scholars said about Soma,</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">VIEWS OF SCHOLARS</span></strong></p>
<p>Swami Vikvekananda the founder of Ramakrishna Mission wrote,</p>
<p>“And they had a popular plant called Soma. What plant it was nobody knows now; it has entirely disappeared, but from the books we gather that, when crushed, it produced a sort of milky juice, and that was fermented; and it can also be gathered that this <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">fermented Soma juice was intoxicating</span>. This also they offered to Indra and the other gods, and they also drank it themselves. Sometimes they drank a little too much, and so did the gods. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Indra on occasions got drunk</span>. There are passages to show that Indra at one time drank so much of this Soma juice that he talked irrelevant words.” <strong>The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda/Volume 1/Lectures And Discourses/Vedic Religious Ideals</strong><br />

<p>Sri Aurobindo the founder of Sir Aurobindo Ashram wrote,</p>
<p>&#8220;Soma is the Lord of the wine of delight, the wine of immortality. Like Agni he is found in the plants, the growths of earth, and in the waters. The Soma-wine used in the external sacrifice is the symbol of this wine of delight. It is pressed out by the pressing-stone (adri, gravan) which has a close symbolic connection with the thunderbolt, the formed electric force of Indra also called adri&#8230;&#8221; <strong>The Secret of the Veda, p.354, by Sri Aurobindo, Published by SriAurobindoAshram Publication Dept, 2003</strong></p>
<p>Swami Prabhupada the founder of ISKCON is of the same view that Soma was an intoxicating drink, however, he is also of the view that SomRas was not an ordinary intoxicating liquor, it was a special intoxicating liquor made for the gods. He wrote,</p>
<p>“…The demigods are accustomed to drinking the soma-rasa beverage, and therefore the drinking of wine and intoxication are not unknown to them…” <strong>Swami Prabhupada on Srimad Bhagavatam 1.15.34</strong><br />

<p>Dr. B.R Ambedkar the first Law Minister of India wrote,</p>
<p>“Drinking was another evil which was rampant among the Aryans. Liquors were of two sorts Soma and Sura. Soma was a sacrificial wine. The drinking of the Soma was in the beginning permitted only to Brahmins, Kshatriyas and Vaishyas. Subsequently it was permitted only to Brahmins and Kshatriyas. The Vaishyas were excluded from it and the Shudras were never permitted to taste it. Its manufacture was a secret known only to the Brahmins. Sura was open to all and was drunk by all. The Brahmins also drank Sura. Shukracharya the priest to the Asuras drank so heavily that in his drunken state he gave the life giving Mantra known to him only and with which he used to revive the Asuras killed by the Devas—to Katch the son of Brahaspati who was the priest of the Devas. The Mahabharat mentions an occasion when both Krishna and Arjuna were dead drunk. That shows that the best among the Aryan Society were not only not free from the drink habit but that they drank heavily. The most shameful part of it was that even the Aryan women were addicted to drink. For instance Sudeshna the wife of King Virat tells her maid Sairandhri to go to Kichaka’s palace and bring Sura as she was dying to have a drink. It is not to be supposed that only queens indulged in drinking. The habit of drinking was common among women of all classes and even Brahmin women were not free from it. That liquor and dancing was indulged in by the Aryan women is clear from the Kausitaki Grihya Sutra I. 11-12, which says; “Four or eight women who are not widowed, after having been regaled with wine and food are to dance for four times on the night previous to the wedding ceremony.” men, not to speak of women of the lower Varnas, as late as the seventh and eighth centuries- A.D. in the Central region of Aryavarta, is clear from Kumarila Bhatta’s Tantra- Vartika I (iii). 4, which states, “Among the people of modern days we find the Brahmin women of the countries of Ahicchatra and Mathura to be addicted to drinking”. Kumarila condemned the practice in the case of Brahmins only, but not of Kshatriyas and Vaishyas men and women, if the liquor was distilled from fruits or flowers (Madhavi), and Molasses (Gaudi) and not from grains (Sura).” <strong>Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Writings and Speeches, Vol 3, page 154-5 </strong><a href="https://mea.gov.in/images/attach/amb/volume_03.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">https://mea.gov.in/images/attach/amb/volume_03.pdf<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SOMA RAS</span></strong></p>
<p>As you may know, Aryan’s Vedic religion shares many similarities with the Zoroastrians. One of them is Soma plant. Soma in Zoroastrianism is known as Haoma. In the Zoroastrian text Yasna, Haoma (Soma) is considered a mildly intoxicant drink with no harm.</p>
<p>Yasna 10.8 “All other toxicants go hand in hand with Rapine of the bloody spear, but H(a)oma&#8217;s stirring power goes hand in hand with friendship. [Light is the drunkenness of H(a)oma (Pâzand).] Who as a tender son caresses H(a)oma, forth to the bodies of such persons H(a)oma comes to heal.” Tr. L.H. Mills</p>
<p>In the Puranas and Mahabharat, there’s a story of King of Gaya performing a sacrifice in which Indra drank Soma Ras so much that he became intoxicated, I am mentioning all those verses here,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 5.15.12 “In Mahārāja Gaya’s sacrifices, there was a great supply of the intoxicant known as soma. King Indra used to come and become intoxicated by drinking large quantities of soma-rasa. Also, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Viṣṇu [the yajña-puruṣa] also came and personally accepted all the sacrifices offered unto Him with pure and firm devotion in the sacrificial arena.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 4.1.14-18 &#8220;There was never beheld on earth a sacrifice equal to the sacrifice of Marutta: all the implements and utensils were made of gold. Indra was intoxicated with the libations of Soma juice, and the Brahmans were enraptured with the magnificent donations they received.&#8221; Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Mahabharata 12.29.35 “While the king of Anga performed his sacrifice by the hill called Vishnupada, Indra became intoxicated with the Soma he drank, and the Brahmanas with the presents they received.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Mahabharata 1.121.9 &#8220;&#8230;while he was performing a sacrifice the gods with Indra and the great Rishis came to him, and Indra was so intoxicated with the Soma juice he drank and the Brahmanas with the large presents they received&#8230;&#8221; Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Mahabharata 3.88.6-7 &#8220;&#8230;We have heard respecting the sacrificing king Nriga that which really took place while he was performing a sacrifice in the excellent tirtha called Varaha on the Payoshni. In that sacrifice Indra became intoxicated with quaffing the Soma, and the Brahmanas, with the gifts they received&#8230;&#8221; Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Markandeya Purana 129.15-16 &#8220;Equal to Marutta never lived a sacrificer on the face of the earth at whose sacrifice his dwelling house was cast and also golden palaces as largesse, Indra was made intoxicated with Soma and twice-born brahmanas with gifts&#8230;&#8221; Tr. F. Eden Pargiter</p>
<p>Following verses from Veda calls Soma as Mada (intoxicating), I am using Hindi translation by Pandit Ram Govind Trivedi,</p>
<p>ते तवा <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">मदा</span> इन्द्र मादयन्तु शुष्मिणं तुविराधसं जरित्रे |<br />

<p>As you can see, words like Madira (मदिरा) and Mada (मद) have been used in these verses, Madira and Mada both denotes intoxication. Even those fluent in Hindi language can define these words. The word Mada (intoxication) is mentioned in connection with Soma stating that Soma is Mada (intoxicating) in numerous verses such as Rig Veda 1.85.10; 9.107.14; 1.104.9; 2.19.1; 9.12.3; 6.43.1-4; 2.14.1; 9.6.6; Rig Veda 1.84.4 which is also mentioned in Sankhayana Srauta Sutra 12.26.7; Rig Veda Mandala 2, Hymn 15 boasts deeds of Indra done in Intoxication (Mada) of Soma which is translated as rapture by Griffith; Rig Veda 8.14.7 which is elaborated in Aitareya Brahmana 6.7.</p>
<p>V.S Apte defines the word Mada as,</p>

[<strong>The Practical Sanskrit-English Dictionary, by Vaman Shivram Apte, page 836, Published by Shiralkar &amp; Co., 1890</strong>]
<p>Arya Samaji scholar Svami Satya Prakash Sarasvati in his translation of Rig Veda defines it as,</p>
<p>Madah, intoxication; pleasure.<br />
[<strong>Rgveda Samhita, Volume III, page 881, by Svami Satya Prakash Sarasvati &amp; Satyakam Vidyalankar, Published by Veda Pratishthana</strong>]
<p>Ralph T.H. Griffith has translated it as rapture, gladdening, wild joy, etc., and the reason he gave for this is as follows. Ralph T.H Griffith commenting on Rig Veda 1.51.2 quotes Max Mueller on the word Mada (pronounced Mad),</p>
<p>&#8220;Rushing in rapture: when exhilarated by draughts of Soma. &#8216;Here again,&#8217; says Professor Max Muller, ‘The difficulty of rending Vedic though in English, or any other modern language, becomes apparent, for we have no poetical word to express a high state of mental excitement produced by drinking the intoxicating juice of the Soma or other plants, which has not something opprobrious mixed up with it, while in ancient times that state of excitement was celebrated as a blessing of the gods, as not unworthy of the gods themselves, nay, as a state in which both the warrior and the poet would perform their highest achievements. The German Rausch is the nearest approach to the Sanskrit mada.’</p>
<p>In this version, mada has generally been rendered by rapture, delight, transport, or wild joy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Griffith has mentioned Soma as liquor in the following verses like</p>
<p>Rig Veda 2.14.1 “MINISTERS, bring the Soma juice for Indra, pour forth the gladdening liquor with the beakers. To drink of this the Hero longeth ever; offer it to the Bull, for this he willeth.” Tr. Ralph T.H Griffith</p>
<p>Rig Veda 3.48.1 “SOON as the young Bull sprang into existence he longed to taste the pressed-out Soma&#8217;s liquor. Drink thou thy fill, according to thy longing, first, of the goodly mixture blent with Soma.”</p>
<p>Rig Veda 4.34.5 “Out of what substance was that chalice fashioned which ye made fourfold by your art and wisdom? Now for the gladdening draught press out the liquor, and drink, O Ṛbhus, of die meath of Soma.”</p>
<p>Rig Veda 4.44.4 “Borne on your golden car, ye omnipresent! come to this sacrifice of ours, Nāsatyas.</p>
<p>Drink of the pleasant liquor of the Soma give riches to the people who adore you.”</p>
<p>Griffith translated Rig Veda 9.32.1 as,</p>
<p>पर सोमासो मदच्युतः शरवसे नो मघोनः |<br />
सुता विदथे अक्रमुः ||</p>
<p>pra somāso madacyutaḥ śravase no maghonaḥ |<br />
sutā vidathe akramuḥ ||</p>
<p>Rig Veda 9.32.1 &#8220;The rapture-shedding Soma-drops, effused in our assembly, have Flowed forth to glorify our prince.&#8221; Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>This is elaborated in Panchavimsha Brahmana as,</p>
<p>Pancavimsa Brahmana XI.5.1 &#8220;(The verse beginning:) &#8216;Forth (has) the intoxicating madacyut) Soma&#8217; is the gayatri; intoxicating (having mada) (and) rich in sap is the afternoon service; he, thereby, puts intoxication (and) sap (in it)&#8230;&#8221; Tr. W. Caland</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">FERMENTED SOMA</span></strong></p>
<p>As far as my knowledge is concerned, Soma by itself was mildly intoxicating and was made fully intoxicating through the fermentation process. Veda and Brahmana indicate that Soma was fermented and Swami Vivekananda also mentions that Soma was fermented and that fermented juice was intoxicating. Veda, Brahmana and Srauta Sutra state that Soma was mixed with barley [Rig Veda 9.68.4; Atharva Veda 20.24.7], it was kept for three days probably for the fermentation to complete.</p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.187.9 &#8220;What Soma, we enjoy from thee in milky food or barley-brew, Vātāpi, grow thou fat thereby.” Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>Rig Veda 9.17.3 &#8220;Soma, with swelling waves, exhilarating, inebriating, flows to the straining-cloth, destroying the Rakshasas, and devoted to the gods.&#8221; Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Following verses mentions about a day or 3 days old Soma,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.45.10 &#8220;Bring with joint invocations thou, O Agni, the celestial host: Here stands the Soma, bounteous gods: drink this expressed ere yesterday.&#8221; Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>Rig Veda 3.58.7 &#8220;O Asvins, very mighty ones, with Vayu and with his steeds, one-minded, ever-youthful, Nasatyas, joying in the third day&#8217;s Soma, drink it, not hostile, very bounteous givers.&#8221; Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>There’s one more verse from Yajur Veda which talks about the fermentation of Soma, I have mentioned this in the Sautramani sacrifice, you can read Yajur Veda 19.1, Baudhayana Srauta Sutra XVII.32 and Satapatha Brahmana, Kanda 12, Adhyaya 7, Brahmana 3, Verses 5-6 mentioned above. William Scott Shelley has explained fermentation of Soma in the following way,</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p>“In the preparation of the Soma beverage, the Soma stalks were boiled [Satapatha Brahmana XII.7.3.6], and remained standing for three nights [Baudhayana Srauta Sutra XVII.32]. The Taiitriya Samhita contains the mythological justification for keeping Soma for three nights: &#8220;When the Soma was being borne away, the Gandharva Vicvavasu stole it. It was for three nights stolen; therefore after purchase the Soma is kept for three nights [Taittriya Samhita VI.1.6.4]. Referring to Sura, an alcoholic beverage produced from fermented grain, the Satapatha Brahmana states: &#8220;He distils (i.e., boils) it with a view to )its being alike) the Soma-pressing. For three nights it remains standing, for the Soma remains standing for three nights after it has been brought [Satapatha Brahmana XII.7.3.6].&#8221; The Atharva Veda also makes reference to &#8220;him that takes pains, and cooks and presses the soma [Atharva Veda XI.1.30].&#8221; According to the Vedic literature, the Soma liquor was fermented. The directions in the Soma rite include the word Parisrut, &#8220;spirituous liquor [Satapatha Brahmana XII.8.2.15],&#8221; and this is also indicated in the Rgveda by the term Vatapi, &#8220;fermenting&#8221; of the Soma liquor [Rgveda I.187.10]: &#8220;What, Soma, we enjoy from thee in milky food or barley-brew, Vatapi, grow thou fat thereby [Rgveda I.187.10].&#8221;</p>
<p>Following the fermenting of the liquor, the Soma stalks were removed from the vessel and crushed between two stones on a cowhide [Rgveda IX.65.25, IX.79.4, X.94.9], or with a mortar and pestle [Rgveda I.28.1-6, IX.46.3]. The Rgveda tells of Soma libations &#8220;fifteenfold strong [Rgveda X.27.2], and with the addition of water [Rgveda IX.75.9, IX.107.2], which diluted the mixture and caused crushed Soma stalks to swell [Rgveda VIII.9.19, IX.64.8, IX.107.12], the Soma juice was poured over the stalks upon the cowhide, and filtered through a strainer made of cloth or wool [Rgveda VIII.2.2, IX.12.4, IX.13.1]. The Soma stalks were brown (babhru), ruddy (aruna), or tawny (hari) color [Rg Veda VIII.9.19], and Soma juice was also brown [Rgveda IX.33.2, IX.63.4, 6], ruddy [Rgveda IX.45.3], or tawny [Rgveda IX.3.9, IX.98.7]. This beverage is described in the Rgveda as &#8220;good to taste and full of sweetness, verily it is strong and rich in flavour.&#8221; Indicating that the fermenting of the liquor preceeded the pressing, Soma was often drunk unmmixed [Rgveda I.135.3, V.2.3, VII.90.2, IX.72.4], or it was mixed with milk [Rgveda I.23.1, VIII.2.3, VIII.90.10, IX.11.2, 5, IX.64.28, IX.72.1, IX.101.12, IX.107.2], butter [Rgveda X.29.6], curd [I.5.5, V.51.7, VII.32.4, IX.11.6, IX.101.12], or barley [Rgveda I.187.9, III.35.3, 7, III.52.1, IX.68.4].&#8221;<br />

<h1>Cannabis</h1>
<p>In folk tradition, Shiva is often associated with cannabis, Sadhus imitates him by smoking weed. Swami Dayanand Saraswati was also <a href="/index.php/2013/09/14/the-problem-with-satyarth-prakash-dayanand-saraswati-arya-samaj/" data-wpel-link="internal">addicted to cannabis</a>. Vedas lists Bhanga (Cannabis) among the top five best herbs on the earth,</p>

Atharva Veda 2.4.5 &#8220;May this Jangida and Shana, the cannabis (probably as it is now known) save us from rheumatism. One of them, the Jangida is brought from the forest and another, the Shana is drawn out from various herbaceous saps.&#8221; Tr. Acharya Vaidyanath Shastri (Arya Samaj)</p>
<p>The Sanskrit word mentioned is Shana, which means Cannabis. In the Puranas, Cannabis is also known as Vijaya, following verse shows that Bhairava (form of Shiva) accepted it,</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana Lalita Mahatmya 9.73 &#8220;Then the gem named Kaustubha came up. Janardhana took it. Thereafter, the great medicinal herb named Vijaya (Hemp), that caused intoxication through the smell of its leaves, was born. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Bhairava accepted it</span>.&#8221; Tr.

<p>The following verse is about using cannabis in oblation,</p>
<p>Agni Purana 95.32-38 &#8220;&#8230;The oblation should be separately performed with the substances, known as the Vijaya (cannabis sativa), and Lakshmana, Vala (small cardamoms), Gaduchi&#8230;&#8221; Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>SCIENTIFIC ERRORS IN HINDUISM</strong></p>
<p>Written by Sulaiman Razvi</p>
<p>The Hindus claim that they were so scientifically advanced that everything was made by them. Later on the knowledge was either destroyed by Muhgals or the white people copied their ideas. As soon as something is discovered they claim that it was already mentioned in Hindu scriptures. Ironically such advanced people’s research is now limited in finding medicinal values of Cow Urine and Dung. They invented everything except for pen to note down their inventions. I will be mentioning some verses from my article <a href="http://vedkabhed.com/index.php/2014/05/14/scientific-errors-in-vedas-part-i/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Scientific Errors In Vedas<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> but without the Hindi translation as it makes the article very lengthy. This article deals with various scientific errors in Hindu scriptures including the Vedas. And I have written this according to my capability, if a scholar writes about scientific errors in Hinduism then he may find even more errors than I did. It is ridiculous to claim that Hinduism is a scientific religion, this article proves that the Rishis wrote down science of their period which is irrelevant to modern science. Some verses even start with “Scientists says” which suggests that science in Puranas was plagiarized from scientists of that time.</p>
<p>Scientific knowledge in Hindu scriptures is highly objectionable, Atharved 2.32.3 has chant to destroy pests, Atharva Veda 5.23.5 has chant to destroy worms, this is the scientific knowledge imparted by the Vedas. It is mentioned in Vishnu Purana book 5, chapter 11 that Indra was offended by the loss of his offerings, so he caused heavy rain to deluge Gokul, then Krishna held the mountain Govardhana to shelter the cowherds and their cattle. Although this can be dismissed as a miracle but the following scientific errors can’t be dismissed with the said excuse.</p>

<h1>Mountains had Wings</h1>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-6596" title="Vedic Science" src="http://vedkabhed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/word-image-2-300x220.jpeg" alt="Vedic Science" width="568" height="417" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/word-image-2-300x220.jpeg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/07/word-image-2-1024x751.jpeg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/07/word-image-2-768x563.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 568px) 100vw, 568px" /></p>
<p>Hinduism says that mountains had wings and used to fly and then Indra cut off their wings, the reason why Indra did this varies according to different Puranas, some say that their wings were becoming too large so Indra cut them off and then they became clouds, some says that Gods feared flying mountains would fall to the ground and kill</p>
<p>people so for this reason Indra cut off their wings. Mainak mountain was saved as he took shelter in Vayu Devta.</p>
<p>Valmiki Ramayana 5.1.123-5 “O son! Earlier in the Krita yuga, mountains had wings. With speed equal to that of Garuda and Vayu, they went in all directions. After that when those mountains were thus flying freely, Devas and living creatures together with sages obtained fear in the doubt that those mountains might fall down. Then the angry Devendra who performed a hundred Asvamedha rituals, cut off the wings of thousands of mountains by his weapon vajra then and there.” Tr. K.M.K Murthy</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 8.11.34 “Indra thought: Formerly, when many mountains flying in the sky with wings would fall to the ground and kill people, I cut their wings with this same thunderbolt.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 125.10-17 “…The clouds Puskarabartaka have been born from the wings (of the mountains). These wings are named Puskara and hold a huge volume of water hence these clouds are known as Puskaravarta. The valiant Indra cut down the wings of the mountains that used to fly at their will and cause ruin and destruction to the rising generation (of the universe)…” Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, Edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>Linga Purana I.54.46-48 “…The origin of the third type of clouds is from the wings of mountains chopped off by Indra.” Tr. Board of Scholars, Edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana I.2.22.41 “The wings of very powerful mountains that had increased in size and who used to go wherever as they pleased, were chopped off by Indra who wished to secure the welfare of all living beings.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Harivamsa Purana 3.40.19 “Knowing that the mountains are responsible for lack of firmness (immobility) of earth, the destroyer of strongholds (Indra), the lord, after installing the mountains at their own places, cut off their wings with his weapon, the hundred jointed (edged shataparva) Vajra.”</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.51.38 “The wings of the powerful mountains who could go as per their will and pleasure, had grown very large. Indra cut them off for the (welfare of all) living beings.” Tr. G.V. Tagare, Edited by G.P Bhatt</p>
<p>H.H. Wilson writes in the footnoes of the verse Rig Veda 2.12.2,<br />
“Yah parvatan prakupitan aramnat; the Scholiast says he quieted the mountains, going hither and thither, as long as they had wings: Indra cut them off.”</p>
<p>Swami Prabhupada also wrote,<br />
“In many descriptions in Vedic literature it is found that mountains also fly in the sky with wings. When such mountains are dead, they fall to the ground, where they stay as very large dead bodies.” <strong>Swami Prabhupada on Srimad Bhagavatam 8.11.12 </strong><br />

<p>According to Hinduism a woman conceives child after the semen mixes with her menstrual blood,</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 39.10 ”The menstrual flow of a woman suddenly develops conception as soon as it mingles itself with the semen virile of man, through the sap of the flowers of herbs.” Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, Edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>Varaha Purana 125.14 ”The generative fluid is in the female and the semen is in the male. In the womb they combine to form a being. This is due to my Maya.” Tr. Vekitasubramonia Iyer, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Following are the embryological developments mentioned in Hindu scriptures,</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana 2.3.72.42-47 “…Blood takes its origin from Rasa (a vital fluid constituent of the body) and it is said that the flesh originates from blood. The source of fat is from the flesh. It is defined that the bone originates from the fat. From the bone the pith and marrow take their origin and the origin of Semen is from the marrow. (?) Foetus originated from semen virile through its assimilative rasa bodily fluid. It is there that water is mixed initially (?). This is called the Saumya Rasi. The foetus that is solidified [lit. born of Asman, stone solid] is called the second Rasi. One should know that semen is of the nature of Soma and Menstrual blood is of the nature of fire. These two Evolutes follow Rasa…” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.14.17-22 “Then, at the time of conception, Kalana, the embryo at its first stage (in the form of a drop) is formed. In due course the Kalana develops into bubbles. Just as a lump of clay pressed by the wind in the potter’s wheel and shaped by the hands (of the potter) attains multifarious shapes, so also the foetus united with bones and impelled by the wind becomes a human body with proper forms, features and mind. The wind assembles them together. From the wind water is generated. From the water the vital breath is formed and through the vital breath the semen gets developed. Thirty three parts of blood (female contribution) and fourteen parts of the semen mixing together form only half a Pala (two karsas) and is deposited in the womb. The child in the womb is covered by the five vital breaths. From the father’s body he inherits his forms and features.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 39.14-16 “At the time of menstruation, the air draws the semen virile up, from the inside, after which it magnifies itself there; and then it develops into the embryo and assumes human or animal form (according to the kind of the womb where such development occurs)…” Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, Edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>The following excerpts from Brahma Vaivarta Purana and Skanda Purana provide details about Puranic Embryology,</p>
<p>Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Prakriti Khanda 35.121-141 “…As soon as the semen is cast into the womb it is mixed up with blood. If there is excess of blood, the issue takes the form of his mother, and if there is excess of semen, the issue takes his father’s form. The combination of the semen with the blood on even days, i.e. Sunday, Tuesday and Thursday, results in a male issue, otherwise, in a female issue…Semen and blood get united in one night. This union, followed by development from day to day. On the seventh day, the fetus takes the form of a jujube and it takes the form of a pillow in a month, the shape of a lump of flesh without hands and feet in three months and is vested with hands, legs and other members of the body in the fifth month. In the sixth month the body gets animation and consciousness, the animate body then knows the past, but like a bird in a cage, it suffers endless torments. The child in the womb occupies the most unholy place for residence, partakes of the remains of the food eaten by its mother and contemplates Hari in endless tortures. After four months of trouble the child impelled by the wind of the womb is born. But by the illusion of Hari, it forgets the past and oblivious of the quarters, time, space and the necessities…” Tr. Rajendra Nath Sen</p>
<p>Skanda Purana V.iii.159.33-53 “…when semen and blood become mixed due to the intercourse of a man and a woman, a creature is born undoubtedly…In the first month it is a phlegmatic mass with the full complement of the body ingredients. In the second month it is a lump of flesh; in the third it gets equipped with sense organs. From the element of ether it derives lightness, subtlety, sound, power of hearing, strength etc. From air the Atman obtains sense of touch, movement, digestive power and roughness. From fiery element the sense of vision, warmth, digestive capacity, colour, and illumination are obtained. It takes from watery elements chillness, fluidity, dampness and softness. From earth element it takes odour, sense of smell, weight and physical form. These are unborn Atman takes up in the third month and beings to throb. If the longing of a pregnant woman is not fulfilled, the foetus becomes defective. It may get ugliness or even death. Hence the woman should be kept pleased. In the fourth month the limbs get firmness. Blood begins to flow in the fifth month. Physical strength is obtained in the sixth month. Complexion is fixed and the nails and hairs grow at that time. In the seventh month, the foetus becomes endowed with consciousness and mind and the body has all the nails and hundreds of hairs. In the eighth month, the outer skin is fixed and the foetus becomes endowed with the power of memory. It is at this time that his sin pursues the foetus and the mother as well. Hence if the birth is premature and the child is born in the eighth month it dies invariably. Either in the ninth or the tenth month the child comes out naturally forced by the powerful winds at the time of delivery…Now it has its full complement of the limbs of the body. There are one hundred vulnerable joints with three hundred Asthas (bones?). There are seven skull pieces in the head created by the Self born Lord himself. O descendant of Bharata, there are three and half crores of hairs on the limbs. There are seventy two thousand Nadis (nerve vessels) fanning out.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Both these passages are contradicting each other. Hinduism believes that a woman becomes pregnant after semen mixes with her menstrual blood. Semen contains millions of sperm and a woman becomes pregnant when a sperm enters egg of the female and not when entire semen mixes with blood. Every Purana which talks about Embryology says that a woman becomes pregnant after her blood mixes with semen which is a scientific error. Foetus doesn’t take the form of a jujube in a week. The above verse from Brahma Vaivarta Purana says that foetus takes the shape of a lump of flesh without hands and feet in three months and is vested with hands and legs in the fifth month which is not correct because the foetus starts developing limbs in 8 weeks (2 months) and by 14th week (3 ½ month) the lower limbs are well developed, refer Mayo Clinic’c articles <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/prenatal-care/art-20045302?pg=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Link 1<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/fetal-development/art-20046151?pg=2" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Link 2<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>,</p>

<p>It also says that the baby “partakes of the remains of the food eaten by its mother” while the baby doesn’t eat food in the womb, it gets all nutrients from the umbilical cord. Now let’s move on to Skanda Purana. It says that in the third month the baby gets the power of hearing, whereas the baby begins to hear from the 18th week (4 ½ month), refer <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/fetal-development/art-20046151" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Mayo Clinic<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>‘s article. It also says that the baby obtains sense of movement, digestive power in the third month whereas this happens after the fourth month, Refer <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/fetal-development/art-20046151" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Mayo Clinic<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. Blood begins to flow in the 6th week and heart pumps about 100 pints of blood each day in 17th week (4 month &amp; 1 week) but Skanda Purana says that blood begins to flow in the fifth month, refer <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/fetal-development/art-20046151" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Mayo Clinic<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> and <a href="http://www.parents.com/pregnancy/stages/fetal-development/first-trimester-images-of-your-developing-baby/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Parents.com<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. Skanda Purana says that in the sixth month the baby grows hairs and nails and by seventh month it has all hairs and nails whereas baby’s fingernails starts forming in 10 weeks (2 months &amp; 2 weeks) and toenails appears in 14-15 (3 ½ months) weeks and develops in 17th week (4 months and 1 week), refer Mayo Clinic <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/prenatal-care/art-20045302?pg=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">link 1<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/fetal-development/art-20046151" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">link 2<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> and <a href="https://embryology.med.unsw.edu.au/embryology/index.php/Integumentary_System_-_Nail_Development" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">UNSW.edu.au<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. Hairs starts growing in 22 week (5 months &amp; 2 week) and gets a full head of hairs by 30th week (7 month &amp; 2 weeks), refer Mayo Clinic, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/fetal-development/art-20046151?pg=2" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">link 1<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> &amp; <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/fetal-development/art-20045997" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">link 2<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. Skanda Purana is bit correct about bones of baby but not precisely accurate, a new born baby has 270-350 bones. It says that baby’s skulll has 7 pieces whereas the skull of a baby consists of five main bones: two frontal bones, two parietal bones, and one occipital bone. These are joined by fibrous sutures, which allow movement that facilitates childbirth and brain growth, refer <a href="http://www.stanfordchildrens.org/en/topic/default?id=anatomy-of-the-newborn-skull-90-P01840" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Stanford Children’s Health<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> &amp; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fontanelle" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Wikipedia<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>.</p>
<p>Now let’s evaluate Embryology mentioned in Padma and Bhagavad Puranas,</p>
<p>Padma Purana II.66.22-38 …The semen with the blood (of the woman) would be (turned into) a foetus in a day. Then within five nights bubbles would be formed in the foetus. It takes the form of flesh in the five forms; neck, head, shoulder (s), spine and belly; so also hands and feet, the two sides, waists, and (the other parts of) the body; the limbs are produced one by one within two months. After three months, hundreds of sharp joints are produced (i.e. formed). Fingers etc. are produced (i.e. are formed) one by one in four months. After five months mouth, nose and ears are produced (i.e. formed). Within six months, the row of teeth, so also tongue and nails are formed, so also cavities in the ears are formed. So also are formed anus, penis, organ of generation and the male organ of generation. The joints which (are present) in the limbs, are formed within seven months. In the eight month the head with the entire body with limbs and with each limb clearly separated is formed. He is complete and endowed with five. Due to the power of the food of (i.e. eaten by) the mother and by the tastes of six kinds, fixed in the umbilical cord (i.e. the foetus) grows day by day.” Tr. N.A Deshpande</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 3.31.2-5 “On the first night, the sperm and ovum mix, and on the fifth night the mixture ferments into a bubble. On the tenth night it develops into a form like a plum, and after that, it gradually turns into a lump of flesh or an egg, as the case may be. In the course of a month, a head is formed, and at the end of two months the hands, feet and other limbs take shape. By the end of three months, the nails, fingers, toes, body hair, bones and skin appear, as do the organ of generation and the other apertures in the body, namely the eyes, nostrils, ears, mouth and anus. Within four months from the date of conception, the seven essential ingredients of the body, namely chyle, blood, flesh, fat, bone, marrow and semen, come into existence. At the end of five months, hunger and thirst make themselves felt, and at the end of six months, the fetus, enclosed by the amnion, begins to move on the right side of the abdomen. Deriving its nutrition from the food and drink taken by the mother, the fetus grows and remains in that abominable residence of stools and urine, which is the breeding place of all kinds of worms.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam says a head is formed in a month whereas head develops in 7<sup>th</sup> week (1 month &amp; 3 weeks) refer <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/prenatal-care/art-20045302?pg=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Mayo Clinic’s article<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. It says by the end of third month (i.e. on 3<sup>rd</sup> month) nails appear whereas baby’s fingernails starts forming in 10 weeks (2 months &amp; 2 weeks) and toenails appears in 14-15 weeks (around 3 ½ months) and develops in 17th week (4 months and 1 week), refer Mayo Clinic <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/prenatal-care/art-20045302?pg=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">link 1<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/fetal-development/art-20046151" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">link 2<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. Srimad Bhagavatam says that fingers, nostrils, toes, reproductive organ appears in third month whereas it occurs much early than that, fingers starts forming at 8<sup>th</sup> week (2 months), nostrils form at 7-8 week (around 2 months), toes forms at 9<sup>th</sup> week (2 month &amp; 1 week), genitals develops on 11<sup>th</sup> week (2 months &amp; 3 week), refer <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/prenatal-care/art-20045302?pg=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Mayo Clinic’s article<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>.</p>
<p>Now let’s evaluate Padma Purana. Padma Purana says fingers are formed in 4 months which is contrary to what is mentioned in Srimad Bhagavatam which says they are formed in 3 months but in reality this occurs much earlier than that, reference is already given above. It says after five months nose, ears are produced whereas ears starts developing much earlier than that i.e. in 8<sup>th</sup> week (2 months) and baby may begin to hear by 18<sup>th</sup> week (4 months &amp; 2 weeks), refer <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/prenatal-care/art-20045302?pg=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Link 1<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/fetal-development/art-20046151?pg=2" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Link 2<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. And nose is formed in 2<sup>nd</sup> month (week 8) refer <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/prenatal-care/art-20045302?pg=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Mayo Clinic<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. It says nails are formed in 6<sup>th</sup> month whereas baby’s fingernails starts forming in 10 weeks (2 months &amp; 2 weeks) and toenails appears in 14-15 weeks and develops in 17th week (4 months and 1 week), refer Mayo Clinic <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/prenatal-care/art-20045302?pg=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">link 1<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/fetal-development/art-20046151" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">link 2<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> and <a href="https://embryology.med.unsw.edu.au/embryology/index.php/Integumentary_System_-_Nail_Development" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">UNSW.edu.au<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. Padma Purana says that reproductive organs are formed in 6th month which is contrary to what is mentioned in Srimad Bhagavatam which says that reproductive organ is formed in 3 months which are both contradictory. Organ of generation develops on 11<sup>th</sup> week (2 months &amp; 3 week), refer <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/prenatal-care/art-20045302?pg=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Mayo Clinic’s article<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>.</p>

The following topic is also about Embryology in Hinduism.</p>
<p><a href="#top">top</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1><a id="post-6594-3"></a>Semen is produced?</h1>
<p>These verses even says that bone is produced from fat,</p>
<p>Brahma Purana 70.49 “Fat is produced from flesh; bone is produced from fat; marrow is generated from bone and semen is produced from marrow.” Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Also mentioned in Brahmanda Purana 2.3.72.44</p>
<p>Harivamsa Purana 1.40.48-56 “The distillate of various foods, rasa, vital-juice, produces blood, and flesh is produced from that blood; fat comes from flesh and bones from that fat; bones generate marrow and marrow generates seminal fluid, from which pregnancy occurs; hence, rasa, vital-fluid is substratum of all… Water is the primary principle of that rasa, vital-fluid, and this belongs to the soma, the moon, or, the nectarean principle of the moon, in the somatology – Greek – soma -atos ‘body’ and its formation… heat resides in the second half, say in menstrual blood… hence, the being of living beings is a compound of coolness and heatedness of the moon and fire. Thus the essence of all juice, the seminal fluid, is created by an excess of phlegm; blood is created by an excess billious matter. The seat of phlegm is the heart and the seat of bile is the navel. The heart, which is in the body, is known as the seat of the mind. The fire exists behind the cavity of the navel – jaThara agni – is none other than huta-ashana, the devourer of oblations, whose life-spirit is madhu-sUdana. Mind is known as prajApati, the phlegm as soma and the bile as agni. Thus the whole world is a commixture of heat and cold. Where a conception takes place, as is the formation of a cloud, the air enters there accompanied by the Absolute… It then creates the various limbs and nourishes them. Inside the body the vital air divides itself into five kinds of airs, namely prANa, apAna, samAna, samAna and vyAna, and gradually assumes proportions.” Tr. Desiraju Hanumant Rao</p>
<p>Vayu Purana II.35.45-46 ”From flesh fat is produced and bone is developed from fat. Pith and marrow are developed from bone and semen virile is generated from marrow; foetus is developed from semen through assimilative activity of Rasa bodily fluid (or through the activity rooted in sexual pleasure).” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p><a href="#top">top</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1><a id="post-6594-4"></a>Conceiving pregnancy at will without intercourse</h1>
<p>Hinduism says that sexual intercourse wasn’t needed to conceive birth in ancient period and offspring were begotten by flat of the will and in the succeeding Yuga women conceived pregnancies just by touch,</p>
<p>Mahabharata 12.207.38-40 “…Sexual congress, O chief of the Bharatas, was then not necessary for perpetuating the species. In those days offspring were begotten by flat of the will. In the age that followed, viz., Treta, children were begotten by touch alone. The people of that age even, O monarch, were above the necessity of sexual congress. It was in the next age, viz., Dwapara, that the practice of sexual congress originated, O king, to prevail among men. In the Kali age, O monarch, men have come to marry and live in pairs…” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Vayu Purana II.2.45 ”The creation of the earlier ones was due to thought, sight, and touch. Thenceforth, the subjects in this world were born of sexual intercourse.” Tr. G.V. Tagare, edited by G.P. Bhatt</p>
<p>Seer Urva is said to have created a son named Aurva with his mental ability,</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 175.43-44 ”…If one has the seed of asceticism within him, he can create a son from his mind…The ascetics ought to beget progeny out of the embryo created by their mind, and your address to me is bereft of dharma, and is like the speech of those who are not good. By the power of my innerself, I shall create a son, without the help of a woman, after illumining my mind with the glory of asceticism. I shall create such a son out of my soul, who would be ready to consume the creation. Afterwards the sage Urva, absorbed in his asceticism, throwing his thighs into the fire rubbed them with a kusu grass. Then the son in the form of Fire, desirous of consuming the universe, was produced from his thigh, by its own force without the help of any firewood. In such a way the fearful Aurva was begotten from the thigh of the seer Urva.” Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, Edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p><a href="#top">top</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1><a id="post-6594-5"></a>Conceiving pregnancy by drinking semen</h1>
<p>Hinduism also says that a woman can become pregnant by drinking semen. It even says that animals can become pregnant after drinking human semen,</p>
<p>Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Brahma Kanda 20.33-46 “…At that time, Menaka was passing by that way, At the sight of her thigh and breast the semen of the saint was discharged. Thereupon the woman Kalavati drank it cheerfully, went to her husband, bowed to him and told him everything about, her pregnancy…” Tr. Rajendra Nath Sen</p>
<p>Varaha Purana 95.20-21 “Finding the water fragrant (with it), Mahismati told her friends that she would drink it. She then drank the water containing the emission of the sage. As a result she conceived and in due time brought forth, a son named Mahisa, intelligent and valiant.” Tr. Venkitaasubramonia Iyer, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Skanda Purana III.iii.19.64 The semen virile of the royal sage Yupaketu fell into water. It is said that a harlot drank that water together with the semen and became pregnant” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Skanda Purana V.iii.5.27-37 “…O excellent king, Paramesthin Rudra sported about with Uma in the vast expanse of sea-like water. A splendid girl was born out of the sweat of Uma due to her delight. When Sarva’s chest pressed against the breasts of Uma, a great girl of lotus-like eyes issued forth from the sweat…” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 4.2.13-17 “Yuvanaswa had no son, at which he was deeply grieved. Whilst residing in the vicinage of the holy Munis, he inspired them with pity for his childless condition, and they instituted a religious rite to procure him progeny. One night during its performance the sages having placed a vessel of consecrated water upon the altar had retired to repose. It was past midnight, when the king awoke, exceedingly thirsty; and unwilling to disturb any of the holy inmates of the dwelling, he looked about for something to drink. In his search he came to the water in the jar, which had been sanctified and endowed with prolific efficacy by sacred texts, and he drank it. When the Munis rose, and found that the water had been drunk, they inquired who had taken it, and said, “The queen that has drunk this water shall give birth to a mighty and valiant son.” “It was I,” exclaimed the Raja, “who unwittingly drank the water!” and accordingly in the belly of Yuvanaswa was conceived a child, and it grew, and in due time it ripped open the right side of the Raja, and was born, and the Raja, did not die&#8230;&#8221; Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Animals becoming pregnant,</p>
<p>Skanda Purana III.iii.19.65 “After drinking the semen of Sage Vibhandaka together with water, a female deer became pregnant and gave birth to Rsyasrnga.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Mahabharata 1.3.17 “…The Rishi thus addressed, answered Janamejaya, ‘O Janamejaya, this my son, deep in ascetic devotions, accomplished in the study of the Vedas, and endued with the full force of my asceticism, is born of (the womb of) a she-snake that had drunk my vital fluid…” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 5.2.27-31 “…Vyasa said :– O king! Hearing thus the sweet words of Fire, Rambha quitted the hold of his hairs and said :– O Lord of the Devas! If thou art pleased, grant my desired boon that a son be born unto me, who will destroy the forces of my enemy and who will conquer the three worlds. And that son be invincible in every way by the Devas, Danavas and men, very powerful, assuming forms at will, and respected by all. The Fire [Agni] said :– O highly Fortunate! You will get your son, as you desire; therefore desist now from your attempting suicide. O highly fortunate Rambha! With any female of whichever species, you will co-habit, you will get a son, more powerful than you; there is no doubt in this. Vyasa said :– O king! Hearing thus the sweet words of the Fire as desired, Rambha, the chief of the Danavas, went, surrounded by Yaksas, to a beautiful place, adorned with picturesque sceneries; when one lovely she-buffalo, who was very maddened with passion, fell to the sight of Rambha. And he desired to have sexual intercourse with her, in preference to other women. The she-buffallo, too, gladly yielded to his purpose and Rambha had sexual intercourse with her, impelled as it were by the destiny. The she-buffalo became pregnant with his semen virile…” Tr.

<p>Rig Veda 8.6.5 &#8220;His might is manifest, for Indra folds and unfolds both heaven and earth, as (one spreads or rolls up) a skin.&#8221; Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Rig Veda 6.8.3 “Wonderful Mitra propped the heaven and earth apart, and covered and concealed the darkness with his light. He made the two bowls part asunder like two skins. Vaiśvānara put forth all his creative power.” Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>One can Google how a hide (skin of animal) is stretched and spread. Some Puranas describes the earth as lotus shaped,</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 2.12.36 “From the waters, which are the body of Vishnu, was produced the lotus shaped earth, with its seas and mountains.” Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.34.44 “The lotus that was fashioned by Visnu grew from his umbilicus. The earth along with the forests and the trees was evolved in the shape of a lotus.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam describes the planetary system or the earth as lotus shaped and Jambudvipa (Which is supposed to where we live) in the shape of leaf of a lotus flower,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 5.16.5 “The planetary system known as Bhū-maṇḍala resembles a lotus flower, and its seven islands resemble the whorl of that flower. The length and breadth of the island known as Jambūdvīpa, which is situated in the middle of the whorl, are one million yojanas [eight million miles]. Jambūdvīpa is round like the leaf of a lotus flower.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Markandeya Purana 156.22 also mentions Earth as a lotus. Puranas says that Vishnu flattened the Earth,</p>
<p>Padma Purana 1.3.55 “The beginningless supreme being, then having flattened the earth, piled the mountains on it according to (its) divisions.” Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 1.4.45-48 “The supreme being thus eulogized, upholding the earth, raised it quickly, and placed it on the summit of the ocean, where it floats like a mighty vessel, and from its expansive surface does not sink beneath the waters. Then, having levelled the earth, the great eternal deity divided it into portions, by mountains…” Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Kurma Purana I.6.25 “He levelled the earth and gathered the mountains together on it…” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Shiva Purana VayaviyaSamhita 7, Section I.11.34-35; Vayu Purana I.6.27 “The Boar brought the earth to its own place. It then assumed his natural form and fixed it there. He levelled the earth, fixed the mountains and set up the four worlds on the earth as before.” Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Veda says that the Earth is stretched or spread out. Hindus often uses such verses against other religions, wondering what they will have to say about these,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 3.6.5 Great are the deeds of thee, the Great, O Agni: thou by thy power hast spread out earth and heaven.</p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.62.3 Ye raised the Sun to heaven by everlasting Law, and spread broad earth, the Mother</p>

<p>Some translates words like Gau, Bhu Mandala as globe which is misleading, they try to insert their own definitions while according to Hinduism, the Earth is four-cornered, lotus shaped, shaped like a leaf of a lotus flower etc, but the idea of Earth as a flat circular disk is emphasised in the Puranas. Puranas describes the earth as a flat disc of enormous size. In its centre was Mount Meru, round which sun, moon and stars revolved. Around Meru were continents or regions (Dvipa), separated from the central peak by oceans, and named according to the great trees which stood on their shores opposite Meru. According to some Puranas there are Saptadvipas (four regions/continents/islands) in the world and as per some there are Chaturdvipa (four Dvipas) including Jambduvipa. Below the earth are seven levels of hell and above the earth is heaven, the earth is established on waters. This is the description of earth given in Hindu scriptures. The verses are not clear, but if you search Jambudvipa on Google then you will find stuff related to Earth as a Flat Circular disc also if you imagine the Earth as described in Puranas then you will get a flat circular earth.</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 2.2.4-36 “PARÁŚARA.–You shall hear, Maitreya, a brief account of the earth from me: a full detail I could not give you in a century. The seven great insular continents are Jambu, Plaksha, Sálmali, Kuśa, Krauncha, Śáka, and Pushkara: and they are surrounded severally by seven great seas; the sea of salt water (Lavańa), of sugar-cane juice (Ikshu), of wine (Surá), of clarified butter (Sarpi), of curds (Dadhi), of milk (Dugdha), and of fresh water (Jala). Jambu-dwípa is in the centre of all these: and in the centre of this continent is the golden mountain Meru…The capital of Brahma is enclosed by the river Ganges, which, issuing from the foot of Vishńu, and washing the lunar orb, falls here from the skies…” Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Agni Purana 212.33-35 “…Obeisance to the mount Meru, the representative of Vishnu on earth. Salutation unto the mountain which forms the main stay of the earth. I make obeisance to the mountain situate at the centre of the earth…” Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Harivamsha Purana 3.34.4 “Containing the earth within four boundaries, the Lord created the great ocean. At the centre of the earth, the golden mountain, meru was installed.” Tr. Desiraju Hanumanta Rao</p>
<p>Padma Purana VII.2.10-17 “…At the centre of the earth he produced the great mountain (viz. Meru) with jewelled peaks…” Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana I.2.21.13-16 “…The extent of the earth towards all the sides (quarters) from the middle of the Meru is remembered as one crore and eightynine lakhs (of Yojanas)…” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 2.4.87-93 “…In this manner the seven island continents are encompassed successively by the seven oceans, and each ocean and continent is respectively of twice the extent of that which precedes it…” Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Following verses shows that Mount Meru is in the middle of the earth with land surrounding it and the land is separated by oceans,</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.34.37 “From the unmanifest the great lotus of the earth is evolved. Its pericarp is the four-cornered Meru that is five times great.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 123.27-28 “Thus the seven dvipas are surrounded by the seven oceans…” Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, Edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>Linga Purana I.46.1 “The Earth consists of seven continents. It is full of rivers and mountains. It is surrounded by seven oceans all round and embellished by them.” Tr. Board of Scholars, Edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.34.46 “The four famous great continents are stationed on the petals. The powerful Meru is stationed on the pericarp.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Similar thing is mentioned in Mahabharata,</p>
<p>Mahabharata 6.6.18-21 “Besides Meru are situated, O lord, these four islands, viz., Bhadraswa, and Ketumala, and Jamvudwipa otherwise called Bharata, and Uttar-Kuru which is the abode of persons who have achieved the merit of righteousness. The bird Sumukha, the son of Suparna, beholding that all the birds on Meru were of golden plumage, reflected that he should leave that mountain inasmuch as there was no difference between the good, middling, and bad birds. The foremost of luminaries, the sun, always circumambulates Meru” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.34.56 “That Meru, the purifier of living beings, is encircled by worlds. Four islands are established on its different sides.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.50.68-70 “The entire earth is known as fifty crores (of Yojanas) in extent. From the middle of Meru on all four sides is half of it. Half the extent of the earth is stated in terms of Yojanas. The extent of the earth towards all the sides (quarters) from the middle of Meru is said to be eleven crores and eighty nine lakhs (of Yojanas) and fifty thousand.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana I.2.15.12-13 “Jambudvipa is immense and glorious with huge zones all round. It is encircled by nine worlds that evolve a number of living beings. It is surrounded on all sides by the briny sea the extent of which is equal to that of Jambudvipa itself.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Padma Purana 1.19.166-171 &#8220;&#8230;O you creator of the worlds, you are the protector and creator of us and (also) of the worlds. This flat world will be elevated by your favour&#8230;&#8221; Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p>The above verse mentions Vishnu’s boar avatar Varaha lifting up the “Flat world”, almost all ancient Hindu temples depict Varaha holding personified earth or Bhudevi and not flat or spherical earth. Many Hindus have falsely presented idols of Varaha from the 21<sup>st</sup> century as ancient ones where Varaha is depicted as holding up spherical earth, but all those false information has been debunked <a href="https://www.vishvasnews.com/english/viral/fact-check-this-varaha-statue-is-not-thousand-years-old-viral-claim-is-misleading/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">here<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. However, there are plenty of pictures from the medieval period depicting Varaha holding up flat earth. Though there are many pictures from the 17<sup>th</sup> to 19<sup>th</sup> century, I am reproducing a few pictures here,</p>

Idol of Varaha depicts it holding flat earth by its tusks at Adi Varaha Temple, Mathura. Though the date of this idol is unknown, it is believed to be the oldest Varaha temple. And finds mention in Varaha Purana chapter 163 stating that the idol was created by Sage Kapila.</p>

<h1><a id="post-6594-9"></a>Earth is immovable</h1>
<p>There are chapters in Puranas about movements of planets. It mentions revolution of all planets of our solar system like Venus, Mercury, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn and even satellite and star like Moon and Sun but nowhere mentions the movement of the Earth. Which proves that the Earth according to Hinduism is stationary.</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana 2.3.52.8 &#8220;The earth overwhelmed by the ocean began to quake though its name is Acala (immovable). There was a break and hindrance in the penance and abstract meditation of the ascetics.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Mahabharata, Anushasana Parva 12, Section 62, verse 2 &#8220;Bhishma said, &#8216;Of all kinds of gifts, the gift of earth has been said to be the first (in point of merit). Earth is immovable and indestructible&#8230;&#8221; Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Vamana Purana 8.26 &#8220;I bow down to the Worshipful Lord Visnu who raised the immovable earth with one single tusk, who sustains everything, and who sleeps absorbing the entire universe in Him.&#8221; Tr. Ananada Swarup Gupta</p>
<p>Mahabharata 13.62.2 “…Earth is immovable and indestructible…” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Mahabharata 5.76.7-8 “Behold, O Krishna, these the firmament and the earth which are immovable, immense, and infinite, and which are the refuge of, and in which are born these countless creatures.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.35.11; Linga Purana I.49.25b-27 “Meru has four great ranges (legs) in all the four quarters. Held by them, the earth with her seven continents does not move.” Tr. G.V. tagare</p>
<p>Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Krishna Janma Khanda 87.99-104 …Vrinda, so saying, remained there like the immoveable earth….” Tr. Various Sanskrit Scholars, Edited by B.D. Basu.</p>

<p>Brahmanda Purana 1.2.21.87-88 “Everyday the sun traverses those (zones) in due order. Just as the outer rim of the potter’s wheel comes back quickly (i.e. revolves), so also the sun functions quickly during his Souther transit. Hence, he traverses a major portion of the Earth in the course of a shorter period.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana I.2.23.44-45 “Thus the sun traverses the quarters by means of his swift chariot with one wheel. The horses are splendid but they do not have the usual place (? Akramaih). In the course of a day and night, the sun traverses the earth consisting of the seven continents and oceans by means of his chariot with a single wheel.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 126.41-46 “The Sun in course of one single day and night goes swiftly over the world consisting of the seven oceans and the seven islands, seating in His one-wheeled chariot and drawn by seven horses. The seven horses yoked to the Sun’s chariot are no other than the seven chhandas metres); they can assume forms at their will; they go as they like…Ascending on such a chariot the Sun travels the earth in course of one day (24 hours.) The horses were yoked at the beginning of Kalpa and carry on the Sun toll the end of the Great Dissolution (Maha Pralaya). Thus He goes on round and round, day and night, surrounded by the Valakhillya Munis…” Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, Edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 128.71-73 “The Sun moves lowest down of all the planets. Above Him the Moon travels. The stars travel above the Moon; above Moon, travels Mercury; above Mercury, travels Venus; above Venus, travels Mars; above Mars, travels Jupiter; above Jupiter, travels Saturn.” Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, Edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.52.43-44 “Thus the Sun moves ahead quickly in his celestial sphere by means of his single-wheeled chariot dragged by the unimpaired gentle horses. In the course of a day and night he traverses over the world of seven continents and oceans by means of his single wheeled chariot dragged by the seven horses.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.50.142 “Within a short time, therefore, the sun traverses the extensive earth. Within twelve Muhurtas it traverses quickly from the south to the north.” Tr. G.V. tagare</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana I.2.23.44-45 “Thus the sun traverses the quarters by means of his swift chariot with one wheel. The horses are splendid but they do not have the usual place (? Akramaih). In the course of a day and night, the sun traverses th earth consisting of the seven continenents and oceans by means of his chariot with a single wheel.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Linga Purana Section I.54.9-12 “…Similarly when the sucker of waters (i.e. the sun) moves about in the middle of Puskara the mountain to the north of Manasa, he traverses a thirtieth part of the earth in a Muhurta (48 mts). Understand this number in yojanas travelled in a Muhurta. The speed of the noble souled sun per Muhurta is three million one hundred and fifty thousand yojanas…” Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.50.119-121; Matsya Purana 124.40-60 “When the sun passes through the middle of the sky, it traverses one thirtieth of the diameter of the earth in a Muhurta (forty eight minutes). In regard to the distance traversed in Yojanas, know that it is three million one hundred and fifty thousand in full. This is the distance traverses by the sun in one Muhurta.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 5.22.5 “The sun-god, who is Nārāyaṇa, or Viṣṇu, the soul of all the worlds, is situated in outer space between the upper and lower portions of the universe. Passing through twelve months on the wheel of time, the sun comes in touch with twelve different signs of the zodiac…” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 5.22.7 “The sun-god has three speeds — slow, fast and moderate. The time he takes to travel entirely around the spheres of heaven, earth<br />
and space at these three speeds is referred to, by learned scholars, by the five names Saṁvatsara, Parivatsara, Iḍāvatsara, Anuvatsara and Vatsara.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana 8:7:2:5 …having once revolved round these worlds, that sun would not pass by them. Let him lay down the two last alongside the two first by reaching over them: he thus causes that sun to pass by these worlds; and hence that sun revolves incessantly round these worlds again and again (from left) to right.</p>
<p>Varaha Purana 26.8 “From its lustre arose twelve suns, and the principal one among these now revolves round the world.” Tr. Vankitasubramonia Iyer, Edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Mahabharata 6.6.7-16 “…This (the land where we are) is in the Varsha that is called after Bharata…Besides Meru are situated, O lord, these four islands, viz., Bhadraswa, and Ketumala, and Jamvudwipa otherwise called Bharata, and Uttar-Kuru…The foremost of luminaries, the sun, always circumambulates Meru, as also the moon with (his) attendant constellation, and the Wind-god too…” Tr.

<p>Rig Veda 1.35.9 “The gold-handed, all-beholding luminary travels between the two regions of heaven and earth, dispels diseases, and this, verily, is known as the sun, and it finally overspreads the sky, extending from the dark interspace to the celestial region” Tr. SatyaPrakash Saraswati.</p>
<p>Nirukta 7.23 The sun having first revolved towards the northern hemisphere, a person holds a polished (piece of) white copper, or crystal, focusing the sun-rays in a place where there is some dry cow-dung, without touching it… Now (had VaisVauara been the sun), there would have occurred expressions relating to VaisVanara in those same hymns and shares which are assigned to celestial deities, i.e. Savitr, [Surya], Pusan, Visnu, and [the VisVedevas.] And they would have praised him by (attributing to him) the functions of the sun, as thou risest, thou settest, thou revolvest, &amp;c.</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 13.2.6 “Hail to thy rapid car whereon, O Sūrya, thou circlest in a moment both the limits…[44] The suppliant&#8217;s way, filling the earth, the Mighty circleth the world with eye that none deceiveth…” Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.50.60 “Revolving all round, the Sun illuminates and protects the three worlds. Hence on account of illumination and protection, he is called ‘Ravi’. The root av means ‘illumination’ (and protection.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Following verses shows movements of the Sun,</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana I.2.21.35-36 “Understand the movement of the sun during the southern transit, as he goes to that quarter. His movement is above all the guardians of the quarters. During this southern transit, the sun rushes forward like an arrow that is discharged. He revolved always, taking the circle of luminaries with him.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana 1.2.21.45-46 “The sun revolves rapidly like the whirling firebrand. Moving about, the sun traverses the revolving constellations. Thus the sun thereby moves to the south among the four quarters. The sun rises and sets again and again.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 125.50-58 …The success of the sun’s chariot is due to the conjunction (with Dhruva). Thus this divine solar chariot moves about in the heaven. The pins of the yoke and axle are on its south. The pair of reins of the yoke and the wheel of this aerial chariot revolve round and round in all directions like the potter’s wheel…</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 5.22.6 “Thus the time the sun takes to rotate through half of outer space is called an ayana, or its period of movement [in the north or in the south].” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.51.68-69 “With that the lord Sun moves quickly in the heaven. There are two reins of the chariot tied to the tips of the pole and the axle. Propelled by Dhruva the chariot moves in the sky in a circular fashion.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.50.92-93 “Understand the solar movement when the sun reaches south during the southern transit all round above the guardians of the worlds. In his transit to the south, the sun moves fast like a discharged arrow. It takes the group of luminary bodies with it and revolves always.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.50.151-4 “During the northern transit, the movement of the moon (?) is slow during day and fast during night. During the southern transit the sun’s movement is dast during day and slow during night. Dividing nights and days thus by its special diverse movements, the sun traverses the path by its even (regular) and uneven (irregular) movement.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Many verses are clearly saying that the sun travels around the earth so there is no way for apologists to defend these verses. Also read categories like Sun moves in a chariot pulled by Seven Horses, Speed of Sun moving around the Earth which proves that the Sun indeed revolves around the earth as per Hinduism.</p>

<h1><a id="post-6594-11"></a>Sun moves in a chariot pulled by seven horses</h1>
<p>Sun travelling in a horse pulled by seven horses is quite similar to Greek mythology&#8217;s Sun god <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helios" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Helios<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. Indian Prime Minister from the Hindu nationalist party said that, <a href="http://www.hindustantimes.com/india/india-can-lead-fight-against-global-warming-pm-modi/story-2IKlOQEcBApVtoKw1XCaUI.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">In our mythology we have imagined the sun god Surya riding on seven horses<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. This has basis in Hindu scriptures which says,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.50.8; 1.50.1 O, Bright sun, a chariot named harit with seven horses takes you to sky</p>
<p>Mahabharata book 13.158.20-22 …the sun possessed of a thousand rays… He it is that constitutes the wheel of the year, having three naves and seven horses to drag it…He is the sun, the dispeller of all darkness.</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 5.21.12-19 “Thus the chariot of the sun-god, which is trayimaya, or worshiped by the words om bhur bhuvah svah, travels through the four residences…My dear King, the carriage of the sun-god’s chariot is estimated to be 3,600,000 yojanas [28,800,000 miles] long and one-fourth as wide [900,000 yojanas, or 7,200,000 miles]. The chariot’s horses, which are named after Gayatri and other Vedic meters, are harnessed by Arunadeva to a yoke that is also 900,000 yojanas wide. This chariot continuously carries the sun-god. Although Arunadeva sits in front of the sun-god and is engaged in driving the chariot and controlling the horses, he looks backward toward the sun-god…My dear King, in his orbit through Bhu-mandala [Earth], the sun-god traverses a distance of 95,100,000 yojanas [760,800,000 miles] at the speed of 2,000 yojanas and two krosas [16,004 miles] in a moment.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana I.2.23.50 “…The lord of the day (i.e. the sun) thus revolves and wanders by means of horses that gallop and that are as swift as birds.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Linga Purana I.55.81-82 “Thus the sun, the harbinger of the day moves ahead quickly in a single wheeled chariot drawn by seven green imperishable horses. He whirls day and night in his chariot which has a single wheel. He traverses in heaven over the seven continents and oceans with the help of seven groups.” Tr. Board of Scholars, Edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Devi Bhagwatam 8.15.40-45 “…The seat of the Sun on his chariot measures 36 Lakh Yoyanas wide. The Yuga measures in length one fourth of the above dimensions, that of his seat. The Chariot is moved by seven horses, consisting of the seven Chhandas, Gâyatrî, etc., driven by Aruna. The horses carry the Sun for the happiness of all. Though the charioteer sits in front of the Sun, his face is turned towards the west. He does his work as a charioteer in that state…” Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>It&#8217;s possibly inspired by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trundholm_sun_chariot" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Trundholm Sun Chariot<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> commonly found in the European mythologies. Some apologists tries to defend this by saying that seven horses mentioned here are not actually horses but seven rays. In many Hindu scriptures the Sun is described as of having a thousand rays not 7 rays and none of the Puranas or the Mahabharat explains seven horses as seven rays, so this proves that its apologists concocted explanation which has no basis. If seven horses are described as seven rays then does that mean the Moon too emits ten rays as Hindu scriptures describes moon moving in a chariot pulled by 10 horses. Sun is described in Hindu scriptures including the Vedas as of having 1000 rays not 7 rays, these 7 horses’ names are different than the names of rays of sun given in Hindu scriptures. Hindu scriptures clearly mentions that the seven horses are seven Vedic metres who have assumed the shape of horses. Some also explain it by saying that one wheel of the chariot signifies day or year, five spokes in it signifies five seasons etc. which is true to an extent but the one wheel represents year and five spokes of the chariot represents five seasons, the chariot is not a metaphor. Just as in the Tricolor (Indian flag) the saffron, white and green represents courage and sacrifice, peace and truth, and faith and chivalry respectively, the Ashoka Chakra in the middle represents the eternal wheel of law so the wheel of the chariot and its spokes too represent year and seasons in the same manner. Hindu scriptures even gives the size of Sun’s chariot, how will apologists explain that? If it is symbolic then why Hindu scriptures mentioned the size of chariot? And why do they say that Sun moves around in his chariot? Hindu scriptures also mentions chariot of moon what does it signify? Also check above topic especially Brahmanda Purana I.2.23.44-45 and Vayu Purana I.52.43-44 which clearly states about Sun revolving around the earth in a chariot pulled by horses and even has a charioteer in front. Logically speaking does the Sun rotates or revolves through rays if horses means rays? Before speaking about 7 horses of the sun, the Mahabharata verse mentions 1000 rays of the sun which makes it pretty clear that 7 horses aren’t really rays, moreover if seven horses of the sun means 7 rays of the sun then what does 10 horses of the moon means? Hindu text mentions 10 horses of the moon also, does that mean moon also emits 10 types of rays?</p>

<h1><a id="post-6594-12"></a>Even the Moon moves around the earth in a chariot pulled by horses</h1>
<p>Brahmanda Purana 1.2.23.50-51 “He is served by Gandharvas and groups of celestial damsels by means of sons and dances. The lord of the day (i.e. the sun) thus revolves and wanders by means of horses that gallop and that are as swift as birds. The chariot of Soma (the Moon) has three wheels. His horses have the lustre of Kunda (white jasmine) flowers. They are ten in number and they are yoked to the left as well as to the right. The moon traverses by means of this.” Tr. Board of Scholars, Edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.52.50-51 “The chariot of the Moon has three wheels. The horses are tied in pairs on either side. The chariot along with the horses and the charioteer has come out of the womb of the waters. The three wheels have a hundred spokes. Excellent white horses have been yoked thereto. They are ten in number. They are slender and divine. They are unimpeded and have the velocity of the mind. They are yoked but once (in the beginning of the Kalpa) and they travels till the end of the Yugas.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>

<h1><a id="post-6594-13"></a>Speed of Sun moving around the Earth</h1>
<p>Linga Purana Section I.54.9-12 “…Similarly when the sucker of waters (i.e. the sun) moves about in the middle of Puskara the mountain to the north of Manasa, he traverses a thirtieth part of the earth in a Muhurta (48 mts). Understand this number in yojanas travelled in a Muhurta. The speed of the noble souled sun per Muhurta is three million one hundred and fifty thousand yojanas…” Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.50.119-121 “When the sun passes through the middle of the sky, it traverses one thirtieth of the diameter of the earth in a Muhurta (forty eight minutes). In regard to the distance traversed in Yojanas, know that it is three million one hundred and fifty thousand in full. This is the distance traverses by the sun in one Muhurta.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>1 Muhurta = 48 minutes</p>
<p>1 Yojana = 8 miles (as per Hindu translators of Puranas)</p>
<p>3,150,000 Yojana*8 miles = 25,200,000</p>
<p>25,200,000/48 = 525,000 i.e. speed in one minute</p>
<p>525,000*60 = 31,500,000 miles per hour</p>
<p>According to modern science,<br />
“The Sun’s orbital speed around the Galaxy: ~200 km/s (720,000 km/h, 450,000 mph) The speed of the ground beneath your feet, as a result of the Earth’s rotation: 1000 km/h (600 mph) at the latitude of Sheffield (53 degrees); it goes up to 1670 km/h (1000 mph) at the equator.”<br />

<p>The orbital speed of the sun given in Vayu Purana is 31,500,000 mph and the orbital speed of the sun according to science is 450,000 mph which is nowhere close to the speed given in Puranas. Brahmanda Purana mentions a different speed, so let’s have a look at that too,</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana I.2.21.60-65 “…Thus, when the sun traverses the middle of the sky, it passes through parts of the earth in the course of a Muhurta as it were (?) Understand the number of Yojanas here in the course of a Muhurta. It is one hundred and eightyone thousand Yojanas. This is the speed of the sun in a Muhurta.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>181,000*8 = 1,448,000 miles</p>
<p>1,448,000/48 = 30,166 in a minute</p>
<p>30,166*60= 1,810,000 mph</p>
<p>This speed given is also not correct, the speed given in Srimad Bhagavata (Bhagavad Purana) is different so let’s evaluate its authenticity as well,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 5.21.12 “Thus the chariot of the sun-god, which is trayīmaya, or worshiped by the words om bhūr bhuvaḥ svaḥ, travels through the four residences mentioned above at a speed of 3,400,800 yojanas [27,206,400 miles] in a muhūrta.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>mph already given hence,</p>
<p>27,206,400/48 (1 Muhurta) = 566,800</p>
<p>566,800*60= 34,008,000 mph</p>
<p>Whereas the orbital speed of the sun is 450,000 mph.</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 5.21.19 “My dear King, in his orbit through Bhū-maṇḍala, the sun-god traverses a distance of 95,100,000 yojanas [760,800,000 miles] at the speed of 2,000 yojanas and two krośas [16,004 miles] in a moment.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>

<h1><a id="post-6594-14"></a>Moon travels faster than the Sun</h1>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 5.22.8 “Above the rays of the sunshine by a distance of 100,000 yojanas [800,000 miles] is the moon, which travels at a speed faster than that of the sun. In two lunar fortnights the moon travels through the equivalent of a saṁvatsara of the sun, in two and a quarter days it passes through a month of the sun, and in one day it passes through a fortnight of the sun.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>It says that the Moon travels faster than the Sun.</p>
<p>“The Moon orbits Earth at a speed of 2,288 miles per hour (3,683 kilometers per hour). During this time it travels a distance of 1,423,000 miles (2,290,000 kilometers).”</p>

<h1><a id="post-6594-16"></a>Moon has water</h1>
<p>Vayu Purana I.53.57 “The orb of the Moon is of solid water and the orb of the Sun is of solid refulgence.” Tr. G.V. Tagare, Edited by G.P Bhatt</p>
<p>Another Vayu Purana may be saying the same,</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.53.84-86 “Thus the abodes and their resident deities are mentioned. The abode of the thousand rayed Sun is full of fire and sparkling. The abode of the thousand rayed Moon is full of water and sparkling white. The abode of the five rayed charming planet Budha is dark in color.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Linga Purana I.52.3 “The storehouse of water in the sky which is called Soma (moon) is the support of all living beings. To Devas, it is the receptacle of nectar.” Tr. Board of Scholars, Edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana I.2.23.78-79 “The divine spheres of the sun and the moon are sparkling and white. They are of the form (or full of) of fire and water. They move about in the firmament. They resemble auspicious round pots. The sphere of the moon is remembered to be consisting of dense water. The white and brilliantly sparkling sphere of the sun is composed of dense fiery splendour.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Hinduism also says that Moon is born from waters,</p>

<p><a href="#top">top</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1><a id="post-6594-17"></a>How Full Moon occurs</h1>
<p>According to Hinduism, the Sun fills the moon with a nectar which lasts until 33330 Devas drinks it and turns it dark. The nectar is described as sweet like honey and consisting of the essence of the watery juice. It is the food of the Devas which makes them immortal. Seems this is the Soma Ras.</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.52.60-66 “Beginning with the second day in the dark half and ending with the fourteenth day Devas drink the watery wine, the nectar of the Moon that is essentially made up of water and that by nature consists of tasty essence. By the brilliance of the Sun the nectar is collected and prepared in the course of a fortnight. On the full moon night Devas, Pitrs and the sages attend the Moon facing the Sun. The digits being drunk decline gradually in the dark half and become refilled in the bright half. When days pass on gradually Devas drink the moon for half a month until the new moon day and go away. On the new moon day Pitrs resort to the Moon. When the fifteenth part of the digits is left over in the later part of the day, that part is used up by the groups of Pitrs. The remaining digit is drunk by Pitrs during the period of two Kalas. From the lunar rays the nectar of Svadha comes out on the new moon night. They drink the nectar and remain content for a month. They attain immortality.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 126.53-60 “…in the dark fortnight, the Moon wanes daily from the second day till the Chaturdasi tithi (the fourteenth day after the full Moon) when the Devas drink up the soft and excellent nectar of the Moon, sweet like honey and consisting of the essence of the watery juice. For half the month the nectar becomes stored up in the Moon by the Sun’s ray, so that the Devas would be able to drink it; and the quantity of this nectar becomes maximum on the full moon night when the Devas adore the Moon for another supply of the same, gathered from the Sun’s radiance in course of a fortnight.” Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, Edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 126.61-70 “…From the beginning of the dark fortnight the Moon turns black, wanes and becomes dull; His digits decline owing to His nectar being drunk up day by day. 33330 Devas drink the lunar ambrosia. The Moon thus declines during the dark fortnight and waxes until He becomes complete in the bright fortnight. Thus, drinking the nectar, the Devas, at the end of the fortnight, go away elsewhere on the Amasvasya (dark) night when the Pitris come to Him. When the still small portion of the 15th part of the Moon is left, they drink that in the afternoon on the next day for a brief period of two kalas and go away after the completion of this dark fortnight…” Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, Edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 2.12.1-9 “The radiant sun supplies the moon, when reduced by the draughts of the gods to a single Kalá, with a single ray; and in the same proportion as the ruler of the night was exhausted by the celestials, it is replenished by the sun, the plunderer of the waters: for the gods, Maitreya, drink the nectar and ambrosia accumulated in the moon during half the month, and from this being their food they are immortal. Thirty-six thousand three hundred and thirty-three divinities drink the lunar ambrosia. When two digits remain, the moon enters the orbit of the sun, and abides in the ray called Amá; whence the period is termed Amávásya. In that orbit the moon is immersed for a day and night in the water; thence it enters the branches and shoots of the trees; and thence goes to the sun.” Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>

<p>“The sun is nearly a perfect sphere. Its equatorial diameter and its polar diameter differ by only 6.2 miles (10 km). The mean radius of the sun is 432,450 miles (696,000 kilometers), which makes its diameter about 864,938 miles (1.392 million km). You could line up 109 Earths across the face of the sun. The sun’s circumference is about 2,713,406 miles (4,366,813 km).”</p>

<p>Size of the Moon</p>
<p>“The moon’s mean radius is 1,079.6 miles (1,737.5 kilometers). Double those figures to get its diameter: 2,159.2 miles<br />
(3,475 km). The moon’s equatorial circumference is 6,783.5 miles (10,917 km).</p>
<p>The moon’s surface area is about 14.6 million square miles (38 million square kilometers), which is less than the total surface area of the continent of Asia (17.2 million sq mi or 44.5 million sq km).”</p>

<p>Both the Sun and the Moon revolves around the Earth as per Hinduism and since the moon appears bigger to the naked eye than the sun so the Rishis may have thought that moon must be bigger in size than the sun.</p>
<p>Swami Prabhupada the founder of ISKCON stated that moon is farther than the sun and also considered moon landing to be an hoax,</p>
<p>“Another my challenge is that moon is beyond the sun. First planet is sun, and then moon. So if the sun is 93,000,000 miles and moon is above the sun 1,600,000, then how they can go to the moon planet in four days? It requires seven and a half months. That is my challenge.”<br />

<h1><a id="post-6594-20"></a>Size of Earth, Moon, Sun and other Planets</h1>
<p>Size of the Earth,</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana I.2.21.12 “…The entire Earth is remembered as fifty crores (of Yojanas) in extent.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 2.4.18 “…Such, Maitreya, is the earth, which with its continents, mountains, oceans, and exterior shell, is fifty crores (five hundred millions) of Yojanas in extent…” Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>500000000*8 = 4000000000 miles</p>
<p>And this number is nowhere close to the number proved by modern science, this number doesn’t match with either Earth’s radius or diameter.</p>
<p>“The radius of Earth at the equator is 3,963 miles (6,378 kilometers), according to NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center. However, Earth is not quite a sphere. The planet’s rotation causes it to bulge at the equator. Earth’s polar radius is 3,949 miles (6,356 km) — a difference of 14 miles (22 km).</p>
<p>Using those measurements, the equatorial circumference of Earth is about 24,900 miles (40,070 km). However, from pole-to-pole — the meridional circumference — Earth is only 24,812 miles (39,931 km) around. This shape, caused by the flattening at the poles, is called an oblate spheroid.”<br />

<p>Devi Bhagavatam 8.18.11-24 “…O Best of the twice-born! Below this Antarîksa is this earth, measuring one hundred Yoyanas…” Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Size of the Sun</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana I.2.21.69 “The circumference of the sun is estimated to be nine crores of Yojanas as well as fortyfive hundred thousands (i.e. 9,45,00000 Yojanas).” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana I.2.21.7 “The extent of the disc of the sun is nine thousand Yojanas. Its girth is three times the extent.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>The same book gives contradictory numbers, let’s evaluate both numbers,</p>
<p>9 crores of Yojanas is the circumference of the Sun as per Brahmana Purana,</p>
<p>90,000,000*8= 720,000,000 miles</p>
<p>9,45,00000*8= 756,000,000 miles</p>
<p>As per the second verse,</p>
<p>9,000*8= 72,000 miles</p>
<p>“The sun is nearly a perfect sphere. Its equatorial diameter and its polar diameter differ by only 6.2 miles (10 km). The mean radius of the sun is 432,450 miles (696,000 kilometers), which makes its diameter about 864,938 miles (1.392 million km). You could line up 109 Earths across the face of the sun.

<p>The numbers are again nowhere close. Also the diameter given below in Srimad Bhagavatam is inaccurate.</p>
<p>Size of the Moon,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 5.24.2 “The sun globe, which is a source of heat, extends for 10,000 yojanas [80,000 miles]. The moon extends for 20,000 yojanas [160,000 miles], and Rāhu extends for 30,000 yojanas [240,000 miles]…” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 8.18.1-9 “…So the sphere of the Moon extends upto the twelve thousand Yoyanas…” Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Diameter of Moon given in Srimad Bhagavatam</p>
<p>160,000 miles</p>
<p>Diameter of Moon given in Devi Bhagavatam</p>
<p>12,000*8= 96,000 miles</p>
<p>“The moon’s mean radius is 1,079.6 miles (1,737.5 kilometers). Double those figures to get its diameter: 2,159.2 miles<br />
(3,475 km). The moon’s equatorial circumference is 6,783.5 miles (10,917 km).<br />
The moon’s surface area is about 14.6 million square miles (38 million square kilometers), which is less than the total surface area of the continent of Asia (17.2 million sq mi or 44.5 million sq km).”<br />

<p>Size of Venus, Jupiter, Mars and Saturn. The size is given in ratios and not Yojanas and one can easily find the error in this when it says that Jupiter is less than Venus when Jupiter is the biggest planet of our solar system,</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana I.2.23.104-6; Matsya Purana 128.64-65 “The diameter and extent of the sphere of Bhargava (the Venus) it laid down as one sixteenth of that of the moon. Brhaspati (the Jupiter) should be known as one-fourth less than the Venus (i.e. three fourth of its size). The Mars and Saturn are remembered to be three fourths of Jupiter in extent. In diameter and extent, Mercury is three-fourths of either of them.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>The mean radius of moon in kilometres is 1737 divided by 16 is 108 kilometres, so Brahmanda and Matsya Purana are saying that the mean radius of Venus is 108 km when the actual mean radius of Venus is much bigger than the moon, the mean radius of Venus is 6051 km. Linga Purana gives different sizes of planets, I will just present the verse to you.</p>
<p>Linga Purana I.57.13-15 “The diameter, the circumference and the distance in yojanas of Bhargava (Venus) is a sixteenth part of that of the moon. Brhaspati (Jupiter) is of three-fourths of the size of Venus. Mars and Saturn are three-fourths of the size of Brhaspati. Budha (Mercury) is three-fourths of their size in extent and circumference.” Tr. Board of Scholars, Edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>The contradictions in these two verses proves that they were written on imaginations and whims and has no scientific basis.</p>

<h1><a id="post-6594-21"></a>Moon emits rays</h1>
<p>Vayu Purana I.51.20 “The hot rays emanate from the sun; the cool rays from the moon. These two powerful hot and cool rays sustain the universe.” Tr. G.V. Tagare, Edited by G.P Bhatt</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.52.49 “The Moon too moves among the stars that stay in the pathway of heaven (vithi). The increase and decrease of its rays are similar to the increase and decrease of the Sun” Tr. G.V. Tagare, Edited by G.P Bhatt</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana I.2.23.52 “…The shrinking and lengthening of its rays are remembered as being like those of the sun.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Linga Purana I.56.3 “The moon traverses in his chariot along with Devas and Pitrs. It has white rays in the form of sparkling water particles.” Tr. Board of Scholars, Edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.12.7; Atharva Veda 18.1.35 “In him the gods find pleasure at the sacrifice; they seat themselves on the altar of the sacrifices, They placed light in the sun; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">beams in the moon; and these untiring shed <span style="color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;">their light</span> around</span>.” Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 5.20.12 “[The inhabitants of Śālmalīdvīpa worship the demigod of the moon in the following words.] <span style="color: #ff0000;"><u>By his own rays</u></span>, the moon-god has divided the month into two fortnights, known as śukla and kṛṣṇa&#8230;” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Swami Prabhupada the founder of ISKCON writes on the next verse i.e., 13<sup>th</sup> verse,</p>
<p>“From the descriptions in this verse, we can make an educated guess about the nature of the flames on the moon. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><u>Like the sun, the moon must also be full of flames because without flames there cannot be illumination</u></span>. The flames on the moon, however, unlike those on the sun, must be mild and pleasing. This is our conviction. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><u>The modern theory that the moon is full of dust is not accepted in the verses of Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</u></span>. In regard to this verse, Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura says, suśaṣpāṇi sukomala-śikhās teṣāṁ rociṣā: the kuśa grass illuminates all directions, but its flames are very mild and pleasing. This gives some idea of the flames existing on the moon.” Swami Prabhupada on Srimad Bhagavatam 5.20.13<br />

<h1><a id="post-6594-22"></a>What causes hoarfrost/dew drops?</h1>
<p>Hinduism says that four elephants of the four quarters spraying water from their huge trunks causes hoarfrost. Or it may be referring to a cloud who could take shape of any. But I am sure that it talks about the elephants that’s holding up the earth because the 43rd verse states that “Elephants, mountains and clouds along with serpents belong to one and the same family” had it been a type of cloud then this verse wouldn’t have separated elephants from clouds and also the Brahmanda Purana makes it more clear.</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.51.45-47 “During Hemanta (early winter) Parjanya and the elephants of the quarters born of chilliness shower snow (drops) for making the corn flourish…The elephants of the quarters spray all round drops of water from the Ganga by means of their huge trunks. That (spray of water) is called the hoarfrost.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 2.9.16-18 “…the water, although that of the Gangá of the sky, is scattered, by the elephants of the quarters, not by the rays of the sun: it is only when such rain falls, and the sun is in the even asterisms, that it is distributed by his beams.” Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana I.2.22.47-52a “Smoke is conducive to development of all of them without any distinction. The most excellent among them is Parjanya. The Elephants of the quarters are four in number (Although) these are separate, the source of origin of elephants, mountains, clouds and serpents is the same and water is remembered as that origin. On being directed to make the plants and trees flourish, Parjanya and the Diggajas (Elephants of the quarters) showers snowdrops during Hemanta (early winter), born of cool virility. …With their huge trunks, the elephants of the quarters receive the waters oozing from the Ganga and scatter them in the form of water spray. That is remembered as dew drops.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>

<h1><a id="post-6594-23"></a>Sun emits different types of rays which are responsible for changes in Season</h1>
<p>As the Earth spins on its axis, producing night and day, it also moves about the Sun in an elliptical (elongated circle) orbit that requires 365 1/4 days to complete. The Earth’s axis is tilted at 23.5 degrees and is why we have seasons. When the Earth’s axis points towards the Sun, it is summer for that hemisphere. When the Earth’s axis points away, winter can be expected.</p>
<p>But according to Vedic Science we have seasons because the sun emits different types and specific number of rays and changes them to cause different seasons.</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana 1.2.24.32-33 “During Vasanta (spring) and Grisma (summer), the sun blazes by means of three hundred rays. During the rainy season and autumn he showers (rain) by means of four hundred rays. During Hemanta (early winter) and Sisira (later winter), he scatters snow by means of three hundred rays.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Linga Purana I.59.41-45 “…The thousand rays of the sun serve the purpose of the world. Reaching the earth they assume different forms by emitting snow, rain and heat…” Tr. Board of Scholars, Edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.52.36 “In accordance with the seasons, the Sun changes his rays, releasing heat in the summer, mist and fog in the winter and rain during the rainy season and demarcates day and night. He (thus) propitiates Devas, Pitrs and human beings.” Tr. G.V. Tagare, Edited by G.P Bhatt</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.53.25-27; Linga Purana I.59.31a-31b “During the spring and the summer he blazes with the three hundred rays. During rains and autumn he generates rain by the four (hundred rays). The Sun creates mist and fog by means of the three (hundred rays) during early and late winter. He deposits energy on the medicinal herbs. By means of Svadha he propitiates Pitrs. By means of nectar of three varieties he bestows immorality. Thus thousand rays of the Sun achieve the purpose of the worlds. They differ according to the season by exuding water, chilliness and heat.” Tr. G.V. Tagare, Edited by G.P Bhatt</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 128.24-25 “During spring and hot weather the sun imparts heat by his three hundred rays; during the rainy season and autumn causes rain by his four hundred rays; during the dewy and winter season imparts cold by his three hundred rays.” Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, Edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana also says that Sun moves in medium speed to make day and night equal in Autumn and Spring seasons,</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana I.2.21.142 “During the time in between the Autumn and the Spring, the sun proceeds with a medium speed and he resorts to its eastern peak.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>

<h1><a id="post-6594-24"></a>Moon causes rain</h1>
<p>Hindu scriptures correctly says that the sun takes up the water through rays but also makes an unscientific claim that the water is transferred to moon which then sends it to clouds (perhaps to Abhra clouds) that causes rain, some also say that the cloud named Abhra doesn’t cause rainfall while Linga Purana I.54.39-40 states that Abhra means ‘that which showers water’.</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana I.2.22.13-21 “…the sun takes away the water of the entire world, O excellent Brahmanas. The moon transmits the entire water drunk by the sun. The torrential currents of water (Downpour of rain) functions through Nadis (vein like vessels) accompanied by the wind. The water that oozes out of the moon remains in the food (i.e. plants and food crops). The water that has fallen down from the moon, from the sky, is conducive to the welfare of all the worlds. The entire universe has the moon as its support. This has been truthfully recounted. The Usna (hot virility) oozes out of the sun, and the Sita (chill virility) functions from the moon.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Linga Purana Section I.54.29-33 “The waters drunk by the sun penetrates the moon gradually and from the moon they drip down to the clouds. On being tossed about by the wind, the cluster of clouds causes shower on the earth…” Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.51.14-15 “The water drunk in by the sun gets transferred to the moon from the solar fire. Through the Nadis (tubular veins) full of wind the activity of sustaining the worlds begins. What exudes from the moon, the sun receives at its tips. When the wind blows the clouds let it shower on the earth.” Tr. G.V. Tagare, Edited by G.P Bhatt</p>
<p>Aitareya Brahmana Book 8, Para 28 “…The rain having rained enters into the moon…” Tr. Arthur Berriedale Keith</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 2.9.8-18 “…The sun with his scorching rays absorbs the moisture of the earth, and with them nourishes the moon. The moon communicates, through tubes of air, its dews to the clouds, which, being composed of smoke, fire, and wind (or vapour), can retain the waters with which they are charged: they are therefore called Abhras, because their contents are not dispersed When however they are broken to pieces by the wind, then watery stores descend, bland, and freed front every impurity by the sweetening process of time…” Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Linga Purana mentions strange water cycle,</p>
<p>Linga Purana I.54.65-68 “There is neither increase nor decrease of water, if we consider it duly. The wind presided over by Dhruva withdraws the rain. It falls off the planet sun and spreads through the sphere of the stars. At the close of the movement, it re-enters the sun and is presided over by Dhruva.” Tr. Board of Scholars, Edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Dhurva means Pole Star.</p>

<h1><a id="post-6594-25"></a>Unique way to cause rain</h1>
<p>A Hindu MP of India was ridiculed for saying that <a href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/smoke-from-yajna-goes-up-rainfall-comes-down-bjp-mps-formula-to-check-drought/1/666277.html" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Smoke from Yajna goes up, rainfall comes down<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. But what people may not be knowing is that he said this on the basis of Hindu scriptures, so those making fun of this statement should also make fun of Hindu scriptures which promotes such unscientific things,</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 2.16 “We perform the yajna for Vasus, Rudras and Adityas…The desired oblation (Ahuti) reaches the space, comes in contact with air and the light of that sun. It thence brings down rain for us…” Tr. Devi Chand</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 3.49 “The oblation full of cooked articles put into the fire, goes up to the sky. And returns there from full of rain.” Tr. Devi Chand</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 3.76. An oblation duly thrown into the fire, reaches the sun; from the sun comes rain, from rain food, therefrom the living creatures (derive their subsistence).</p>

<h1><a id="post-6594-26"></a>What causes Earthquakes and who lifts the Earth?</h1>
<p>Valmiki Ramayana says that four elephants are holding up the earth and if the easterly elephant namely Viruupaaksha moves its trunk then earthquakes occurs on earth,</p>
<p>Valmiki Ramayana 1.40.13-22 “While digging the earth there they beheld a mountain similar easterly elephant named Viruupaaksha, which is bearing the eastern side of earth’s surface on its head. Oh, Rama, the legatee of Raghu, that great easterly elephant Viruupaaksha is bearing the entire eastern earth along with its mountains and forests on its head. On certain occasions, oh, Rama of Kakutstha, when that great-elephant moves its head desiring respite in tiresomeness then earthquakes will occur on earth. After splitting the eastern direction then they split opened the southern direction, and even in southern direction they beheld an elephant that is similar to a very great mountain, and that is sustaining southerly side of earth on its head, and on seeing that mammoth elephant of venerable character, namely Mahapadma, they went into an inordinate astonishment. Even in the westerly direction those great mighty sons of Sagara beheld an infinite and mountain similar elephant of western direction, called Sumanasa. In the northern direction, oh, Rama, they beheld Bhadra, a snow-white elephant with an auspicious body bearing northern side of this earth.” Tr. Shri Desiraju Hanumanta Rao</p>
<p>6th century Indian astronomer named Varahamihira also writes about this,</p>
<p>क्षितिकंम्पमाहुरेके बृहदन्तर्जलनिवासिसत्वकृतम् ।<br />
भूभारखिन्नदिग्गजविश्रामसमुद्भवं चान्ये ॥१॥<br />
Brihatsamhita 32.1 “Some hold that an earth-quake is caused by huge animals living in the midst of the ocean, while others opine that it is the result of the rest that is availed of by the elephants of the quarters tired by the weight of the earth.” Tr. Panditbhushan V. Subrahmanya Shastri &amp; Vidwan M. Ramkrishna Bhat</p>
<p>I quoted it to show that elephants holding up the earth is literal and not simile and this view was widely held by Hindus even in the 6th century. Vishnu Purana says that Vishnu in the form of a snake named Shesha is holding up the world and the earth trembles if he yawns,</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 2.5.20-25 “…Śesha bears the entire world, like a diadem, upon his head, and he is the foundation on which the seven Pátálas rest. His power, his glory, his form, his nature, cannot be described, cannot he comprehended by the gods themselves. Who shall recount his might, who wears this whole earth, like a garland of flowers, tinged of a purple dye by the radiance of the jewels of his crests. When Ananta, his eyes rolling with intoxication, yawns, then earth, with all her woods, and mountains, and seas, and rivers, trembles…” Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Shiva Purana says that earthquakes occurs when Shesha stretches himself,<br />
Shiva Purana, Uma Samhita 5, chapter 15, verses 18-21 “Holding the sphere of the earth on his back, Sesa, the lord of Bhutas stands at the root of Patala. He is worshipped for his endless attributes. The power of his virility cannot be adequately described even by the ambitious gods nor can his form be known…With his eyes rolling due to inebriation when Sesa stretches himself, the earth quakes along with all its mountains, oceans and forests.” Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam and Devi Bhagavatam also says that four elephants are holding up the universe,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 5.20.39 “On the top of Lokāloka Mountain are the four gaja-patis, the best of elephants, which were established in the four directions by Lord Brahmā, the supreme spiritual master of the entire universe. The names of those elephants are Ṛṣabha, Puṣkaracūḍa, Vāmana and Aparājita. They are responsible for maintaining the planetary systems of the universe.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 8.14.1-29 “…The self-born Brahmâ has placed very big elephants on all sides of it. Hear their names. These are Risabha, Puspachûda, Vâmana, and Aparâjita. These four elephants are said to hold all the Lokas in their respective positions. The Bhagavân Hari gives strength to these elephants and to Indra and others who are reckoned to be His Vibhûtis (powers)…” Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam also says that Vishnu in the form of a dolphin or Gigantic porpoise is holding up the universe or earth,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 5.23.4 “Some persons describe this system of heavenly luminaries as being supported by the mystical Yogic powers of Lord Vasudeva who has assumed the form of a Gangetic porpoise.” Tr. G.V. Tagare, Edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Mahabharata and Puranas says that a snake named Shesha is holding up the Earth and that’s the reason snakes are found in the ground,</p>
<p>Mahabharata 3.202.12-13 “…then lay in Yoga sleep on the wide hood of the Snake Sesha of immeasurable energy, and the Creator of the Universe, that highly-blessed and holy Hari, knowing no deterioration, lay on the hood of that Snake encircling the whole Earth…” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 5.25.2 “Śukadeva Gosvāmī continued: This great universe, situated on one of Lord Anantadeva’s thousands of hoods, appears just like a white mustard seed. It is infinitesimal compared to the hood of Lord Ananta.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Mahabharata describes how Adishesha held the earth, I am quoting some excerpts from the section,</p>
<p>Mahabharata1.36.17-25 “Then Sesha replied, ‘O divine Grandsire, this is the boon desired by me; viz., may my heart always delight in virtue and in blessed ascetic penances, O Lord of all!’ Brahman said, ‘O Sesha, I am exceedingly gratified with this thy self-denial and love of peace. But, at my command, let this act be done by thee for the good of my creatures. Bear thou, O Sesha, properly and well this Earth so unsteady with her mountains and forests, her seas and towns and retreats, so that she may be steady.’ Sesha said, ‘O divine Lord of all creatures, O bestower of boons, O lord of the Earth, lord of every created thing, lord of the universe, I will, even as thou sayest hold the Earth steady. Therefore, O lord of all creatures, place her on my head.’ Brahman said, ‘O best of snakes, go underneath the Earth. She will herself give thee a crevice to pass through. And, O Sesha, by holding the Earth, thou shalt certainly do what is prized by me very greatly…Then the elder brother of the king of the snakes, entering a hole, passed to the other side of the Earth, and holding her, supported with his head that goddess with her belt of seas passing all round.’ Brahman said, ‘O Sesha, O best of snakes, thou art the god Dharma, because alone, with thy huge body, thou supportest the Earth with everything on her, even as I myself, or Valavit (Indra), can…The snake, Sesha, the lord Ananta, of great prowess, lives underneath the Earth, alone supporting the world at the command of Brahman. And the illustrious Grandsire, the best of the immortals, then gave unto Ananta the bird of fair feathers, viz., the son of Vinata, for Ananta’s help.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Swami Prabhupada wrote,</p>
<p>“The incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead known as Śeṣa or Ananta has unlimited strength, fame, wealth, knowledge, beauty and renunciation. As described in this verse, Ananta’s strength is so great that the innumerable universes rest on His hoods. He has the bodily features of a snake with thousands of hoods, and since His strength is unlimited, all the universes resting on His hoods feel no heavier than mustard seeds. We can just imagine how insignificant a mustard seed is on the hood of a serpent. In this connection, the reader is referred to Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta, Ādi-līlā, Chapter Five, verses 117-125. There it is stated that Lord Viṣṇu’s incarnation as the serpentine Ananta Śeṣa Nāga supports all the universes on His hoods. By our calculation, a universe may be very, very heavy, but because the Lord is ananta (unlimited), He feels the weight to be no heavier than a mustard seed.” <strong>Swami Prabhupada 5.17.21</strong> <a href="https://www.vedabase.com/en/sb/5/17/21" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">https://www.vedabase.com/en/sb/5/17/21<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>Vishnu Purana book 2, chapter 5 states that Sesha is a form of Vishnu but Mahabharata says that Sesha is a form of Shiva,</p>
<p>Mahabharata 13.14.151 “…Mahadeva is the soul of all creatures. He pervades all things. He is the speaker of all discourses (on duties and rituals)…He it is that assumes the form of Sesha who sustains the world on his head…”</p>
<p>It’s not just elephant, snake or dolphin that is holding up the earth, Hindu scriptures also says that Vishnu in the form of a boar is holding up the earth and also saving it from sinking in waters. The following topic is also related to this one.</p>

<p>Scientists are spending billions of dollars to find water on other planets but Vishnu’s avatar Varaha found water below the earth some 3000 years ago and also saved the earth from sinking into that water. The story of Varaha lifting up the earth in Puranas may have taken inspiration from Brahmanas,</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana 14:1:2:11 “Then (earth) torn up by a boar (he takes), with (Vâg. S. XXXVII, 5), &#8216;Only thus large was she in the beginning,&#8217;&#8211;for, indeed, only so large was this earth in the beginning, of the size of a span. A boar, called Emûsha, raised her up, and he was her lord Pragâpati: with that mate, his heart&#8217;s delight, he thus supplies and completes him 1;&#8211;&#8216;may I this day compass for you Makha&#8217;s head on the Earth&#8217;s place of divine worship: for Makha thee! for Makha&#8217;s head thee!&#8217; the import of this is the same as before.” Tr. Julius Eggeling</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, VayaviyaSamhita 7, Section I.11.31 “The he lifted the Earth sunk under water and held it on his curved fangs. He rose up from the nether worlds.” Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Harivamsha Purana 3.35.1 “(O janamejaya!) The earth which was installed on the top surface of the water body, did not sink, like a huge ship, due to its vast body.” Tr. Desiraju Hanumant Rao</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.50.7 “Waters lie within the earth and the earth is established over waters. The sky is above, the earth is below (it) and again waters are underneath.” Tr. G.V. Tagare, Edited by G.P Bhatt</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana I.I.5.10 On seeing that the earth had sunk into the water he thought- ”What form shall I assume and uplift the earth?”[15] Assuming this inimitable form of a boar, Hari entered the nether worlds for uplifting the earth.</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 3.13.31 “Lord Boar very easily took the earth on His tusks and got it out of the water. Thus He appeared very splendid. Then, His anger glowing like the Sudarśana wheel, He immediately killed the demon [Hiraṇyākṣa], although he tried to fight with the Lord.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 8.2.34-38 “…He came up from the Rasâtala and placed the earth on the waters. He then went away to His Vaikuntha abode…” Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 8.2.11-20 “The ocean was very much agitated with the fierce striking of the hairs of the Boar, when He entered into the waters, and spoke thus :– “O Deva ! O Thou, the destroyer of the afflictions of your refuges! Protect me.” Hearing the words of the ocean, the God Hari tore asunder all the aquatic animals and went down beneath the waters. Searching violently hither and thither, He knew the earth by her smell. At once the Bhagavân Hari, the Lord of all, went to Her and rescued the earth by raising Her up on his big teeth, the Earth that was the abode of all the beings. When the Bhagavân, the Lord of all the sacrifices, came up with the Earth on the top of His teeth, He looked beautiful like the elephant of a quarter taking out by the root and holding a thousand petalled lotus upon his tusks.” Tr. Swami Vijnananada</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 1.4.45-48 “The supreme being thus eulogized, upholding the earth, raised it quickly, and placed it on the summit of the ocean, where it floats like a mighty vessel, and from its expansive surface does not sink beneath the waters. Then, having levelled the earth, the great eternal deity divided it into portions, by mountains…” Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Harivamsa Purana 1.40.6 “We have heard that sage Krishna-dwaipAyana described this great boar incarnation before the twice-born ones when they assembled at a sacrifice, and detailed as to how that enemy-eradicator, Vishnu, incarnating himself as a boar, saved the earth sunk in the ocean with his tusks; now I would like to hear at length the various deeds performed by the intelligent slayer of enemies hari in his incarnation of boar.” Tr. Desiraju Hanumanta Rao</p>
<p>I remember, when I had posted a meme on my Facebook account about Varaha lifting up the Earth from waters, a Hindu tried to explain it by saying that the water mentioned in Purana is not actually water and later gave a lame explanation. Those who try to give “water” a metaphorical meaning should read following verses which refutes their claim,</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.6.10-27 ”Observing that the earth was overflowed with waters on all sides, (he thought to himself), ”Oh, what great form should I assume and uplift the earth”? He thought of the form of a Boar charmingly comfortable in sporting about in waters…It had a girth of ten and a height of a hundred Yojanas. It resembled a dark blue cloud in complexion. It grunted like the rumbling of thunder-clouds…Assuming this large immeasurable form of a boar, Visnu entered the nether regions in order to lift up the earth…. [25-27] Holding the Earth in his hands he brought it to its place. The supporter of the Earth at first mentally supported the earth and then released it. Over the flood of waters, the Earth floated like an immense boat. Due to the activities of the lord, it did not sink. With a desire to set up the universe, the lord lifted up the Earth. Then, he, the lotus-eyed lord, decided to divide the Earth. He levelled the Earth and created the mountains on it.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>

<h1><a id="post-6594-28"></a>Distance between Planets</h1>
<p>Brahma Purana 21.5-9 “O brahmins, the disc of the sun is stationed a hundred thousand Yojanas away from the earth. The disc of the moon is stationed a hundred thousand Yojanas away from the sun. Full hundred thousand Yojanas above the moon, the entire sphere of the stars shines. O brahmins, mercury (Budha) is two hundred thousand Yojanas above the sphere of stars…Saturn (Sauri) is stationed two hundred thousand Yojanas above Jupiter…” Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>The above verse says that the sun is a hundred thousand Yojanas away from the earth, so let’s do the calculation now,</p>
<p>1 Yojana = 8 miles</p>
<p>100,000*8= 800,000 miles</p>
<p>Distance between Earth and the Sun as per science</p>
<p>“149,600,000 kilometers (km) or 92,900,000 miles”<br />
<a href="https://www.nasa.gov/audience/foreducators/k-4/features/F_Measuring_the_Distance_Student_Pages.html" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">https://www.nasa.gov/audience/foreducators/k-4/features/F_Measuring_the_Distance_Student_Pages.html<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>

<p>The verse also says that the Saturn is stationed two hundred thousand Yojanas “ABOVE” Jupiter.</p>
<p>200,000*8= 1,600,000 miles</p>
<p>“The distance between Saturn and Jupiter is 4.32 AU. That’s approximately 646,270,000 km or 401,592,178 miles.”<br />

<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 5.22.8 “Similarly the Moon is observed to be a hundred thousand Yojanas above the rays (orb) of the Sun. As it is faster in velocity (than the sun), it goes ahead (of the Sun). It covers in two fortnights the circuit made by the Sun in one (complete) year; in two days and a quarter of that distance which the Sun traverses in a month; and in one day the distance the Sun requires a fortnight to cover.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>The distance between Moon and Sun mentioned in Srimad Bhagavatam is same as mentioned in Brahma Purana 21.5-9, so now let’s calculate the distance,</p>
<p>100,000*8= 800,000 miles</p>
<p>“The moon is 93205678.8356 miles away from the sun which is 150 million kilometres.”<br />

<p>Distance between Planets,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 5.22.14-17 “Situated 1,600,000 miles above Mercury, or 8,800,000 miles above earth, is the planet Mars. If this planet does not travel in a crooked way, it crosses through each sign of the zodiac in three fortnights and in this way travels through all twelve, one after another. It almost always creates unfavorable conditions in respect to rainfall and other influences. Situated 1,600,000 miles above Mars, or 10,400,000 miles above earth, is the planet Jupiter, which travels through one sign of the zodiac within the period of a Parivatsara. If its movement is not curved, the planet Jupiter is very favorable to the brāhmaṇas of the universe. Situated 1,600,000 miles above Jupiter, or 12,000,000 miles above earth, is the planet Saturn, which passes through one sign of the zodiac in thirty months and covers the entire zodiac circle in thirty Anuvatsaras. This planet is always very inauspicious for the universal situation. Situated 8,800,000 miles above Saturn, or 20,800,000 miles above earth, are the seven saintly sages, who are always thinking of the well-being of the inhabitants of the universe. They circumambulate the supreme abode of Lord Viṣṇu, known as Dhruvaloka, the polestar.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Above verse says that Mercury is 1,600,000 miles above Mars while according to science, The distance between Mercury and Mars is 1.14 AU. That’s approximately 170,030,000 km or 105,651,744 miles. It also says that Earth is 8,800,000 miles away from Mars while Earth is 0.52 AU away from Mars. That’s approximately 78,340,000 km or 48,678,219 miles.<br />

<p>It also makes the claim that “Situated 1,600,000 miles above Mars, or 10,400,000 miles above earth, is the planet Jupiter”</p>
<p>While as per science the distance between Mars and Jupiter is 3.68 AU. That’s approximately 550,390,000 km or 342,012,346 miles. And the distance between Earth and Jupiter is 4.2 AU. That’s approximately 628,730,000 km or 390,674,710 miles.<br />

<p>It then makes claim that “Situated 1,600,000 miles above Jupiter, or 12,000,000 miles above earth, is the planet Saturn”</p>
<p>While the fact is, The distance between Saturn and Jupiter is 4.32 AU. That’s approximately 646,270,000 km or 401,592,178 miles and the distance between Saturn and Earth is 8.52 AU. That’s approximately 1,275,000,000 km or 792,248,270 miles.</p>

<p>Following verses from Srimad Bhagavatam 5.22.12-13 are related to this subject. It makes the claim that Mercury is 1,600,000 miles above Venus or 7,200,000 miles above earth. While the distance between Mercury and Venus is 0.34 AU. That’s approximately 50,290,000 km or 31,248,757 miles. And the distance between Mercury and Earth is 0.61 AU. That’s approximately 91,691,000 km or 56,974,146 miles.<br />

<h1><a id="post-6594-29"></a>Sun, Venus and Mercury has same Orbits</h1>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 5.22.12 “Some 1,600,000 miles above this group of stars is the planet Venus, which moves at almost exactly the same pace as the sun according to swift, slow and moderate movements. Sometimes Venus moves behind the sun, sometimes in front of the sun and sometimes along with it. Venus nullifies the influence of planets that are obstacles to rainfall. Consequently its presence causes rainfall, and it is therefore considered very favorable for all living beings within this universe. This has been accepted by learned scholars.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 5.22.13 “Mercury is described to be similar to Venus, in that it moves sometimes behind the sun, sometimes in front of the sun and sometimes along with it. It is 1,600,000 miles above Venus, or 7,200,000 miles above earth. Mercury, which is the son of the moon, is almost always very auspicious for the inhabitants of the universe, but when it does not move along with the sun, it forbodes cyclones, dust, irregular rainfall, and waterless clouds. In this way it creates fearful conditions due to inadequate or excessive rainfall.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>

<h1><a id="post-6594-31"></a>Planets move propelled by the rope of wind</h1>
<p>Hinduism says that planets move due to wind as Hinduism believes that there is air in space,</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 128.14 “All these stars are tied to Dhruva: and they move on propelled by the wind. The Moon and the Sun move on in the celestial firmament, prompted by currents of strong wind. They glide on tied to the Dhruva. Their motions round the pole are brought about by these ropes made of wind.” Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, Edited by B.D. Basu</p>

<p>Vamana Purana 16.53 “Burnt by the fire of the eyes of Siva, the restless Surya immersed in the Asi and reaching Varuna, he had a dip in it as freely as he like.” Tr. Ananda Swarup Gupta</p>
<p>Rig Veda 7.55.7, Atharva Veda 4.5.1 The Bull [Vushab/Sun] who hath a thousand horns, who rises up from out the sea…</p>
<p>Kausitaki Brahmana 18.9 Him who yonder gives heat they seek by these pressings to obtain; the rising by the morning pressing, (the sun) in the middle (of his course) by the midday pressing, (the sun) as he sets by the third pressing. He, having entered the waters, becomes Varuna.</p>
<p>Aitareya Brahma Book 4, Chapter 20, verse 13 “…This (Aditya, the sun) is ‘the swan sitting in light’…he is ‘born from the waters’ (abja), for in the morning he comes out of the waters, and in the evening he enters the waters.” Tr. Martin Haug</p>

<h1><a id="post-6594-34"></a>How Eclipse occurs</h1>
<p>According to Vedic mythology a demon covers the Sun which causes solar eclipse.</p>
<p>Rig Veda 5.40.5-6 O Sūrya, when the Asura’s descendant Svarbhanu, pierced thee through and through with darkness, All creatures looked like one who is bewildered, who knoweth not the place where he is standing. What time thou smotest down Svarbhanu’s magic that spread itself beneath the sky, O Indra, By his fourth sacred prayer Atri disoovered Sūrya concealed in gloom that stayed his function.</p>
<p>Following verses may have taken inspiration from the above Vedic verse. A demon named Rahu which is a star according to Hinduism causes Solar and Lunar eclipses.</p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 8.18.1-9 “…The Asura Râhu thus covers his rays. So the sphere of the Moon extends upto the twelve thousand Yoyanas. Râhu covers the field of the thirteen thousand Yoyanas. So he covers both the Sun and the Moon. Desire to take the vengeance of the previous enmity, he covers them during the time of Parva (the festivals). This planet wants to cover them from a distance. Hearing this, the Bhagavân Visnu hurls His Sudars’an Chakra against Râhu. This Chakra (disc) is encircled with the fiery flames and is very terrible. When all the quarters were filled with its violent flames, Râhu became instantly alarmed and fled away from the distance. O Devarsi! This is known as the eclipse known amongst the mortals…” Tr. Swami Vijananda</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 5.24.1-3 “Śrī Śukadeva Gosvāmī said: My dear King, some historians, the speakers of the Purāṇas, say that 10,000 yojanas [80,000 miles] below the sun is the planet known as Rāhu, which moves like one of the stars. The presiding deity of that planet, who is the son of Siṁhikā, is the most abominable of all asuras, but although he is completely unfit to assume the position of a demigod or planetary deity, he has achieved that position by the grace of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Later I shall speak further about him. Rāhu tried to create dissension between the sun and moon by interposing himself between them. Rāhu is inimical toward both the sun and the moon, and therefore he always tries to cover the sunshine and moonshine on the dark-moon day and full-moon night…After hearing from the sun and moon demigods about Rāhu’s attack, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Viṣṇu, engages His disc, known as the Sudarśana cakra, to protect them. The Sudarśana cakra is the Lord’s most beloved devotee and is favored by the Lord. The intense heat of its effulgence, meant for killing non-Vaiṣṇavas, is unbearable to Rāhu, and he therefore flees in fear of it. During the time Rāhu disturbs the sun or moon, there occurs what people commonly know as an eclipse.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Swami Prabhupada writes on Srimad Bhagavatam 5.24.2-3 “As stated herein, the sun extends for 10,000 yojanas, and the moon extends for twice that, or 20,000 yojanas. The word dvādaśa should be understood to mean twice as much as ten, or twenty. In the opinion of Vijayadhvaja, the extent of Rāhu should be twice that of the moon, or 40,000 yojanas. However to reconcile this apparent contradiction to the text of the Bhāgavatam, Vijayadhvaja cites the following quotation concerning Rāhu; rāhu-soma-ravīṇāṁ tu maṇḍalā dvi-guṇoktitām. This means that Rāhu is twice as large as the moon, which is twice as large as the sun. This is the conclusion of the commentator Vijayadhvaja. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Viṣṇu, is always the protector of His devotees, who are also known as demigods. The controlling demigods are most obedient to Lord Viṣṇu, although they also want material sense enjoyment, and that is why they are called demigods, or almost godly. Although Rāhu attempts to attack both the sun and the moon, they are protected by Lord Viṣṇu. Being very afraid of Lord Viṣṇu’s cakra, Rāhu cannot stay in front of the sun or moon for more than a muhūrta (forty-eight minutes). The phenomenon that occurs when Rāhu blocks the light of the sun or moon is called an eclipse. The attempt of the scientists of this earth to go to the moon is as demoniac as Rāhu’s attack. Of course. their attempts will be failures because no one can enter the moon or sun so easily. Like the attack of Rāhu, such attempts will certainly be failures.” <strong>Swami Prabhupada on Srimad Bhagavatam 5.24.2-3<br />

<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 8.12.32-33 “While running after her, the semen of Siva of unfailing procreative capacity, went on escaping like that of a big bull leader of a herd pursuing a fecundable cow or as that of a rutting leader elephant running after a fertilizable she-elephant.

<h1> How mountains were formed</h1>
<p>Brahmanda Purana 1.2.7.9b-11 &#8220;As the previous creation was being burned formerly by the Samvartaka fire, the mountains of that period had been melted by that fire. They were then scattered by the wind. Due to chillness, they became solidified. Wherever the (molten rocks) were split there arose mountain. They are called Acalas (not-moving or immobile)&#8230;&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Vayu Purana 7- &#8220;On seeing the earth fully engulfed in waters, he entered the waters after assuming the form of a Boar. After lifting up the earth from the waters, he deposited the waters of the oceans in the oceans, of the rivers in the rivers and of the earth on the earth. Then he collected the mountains. When the previous creation was being burnt by the Samvartaka, fire of dissolution, the mountains lay destroyed and (scattered) all over the earth. In that one vast ocean, the (solidified) waters tossed by wind got collected together due to cold. Wherever they were (thus) stuck (heaped) together, there they became immovable. The mountains are called Acalas because they become motionless after being dried up and solidified&#8230;&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare, edited by G.P. Bhatt</p>

<p>Satapatha Brahmana 6:5:4:8 “May the divine women, with unclipped wings, dear to all the gods, bake thee, Aṅgiras-like, O fire-pan, in the lap of the earth!&#8217; for of old the divine women, with unclipped wings, dear to all the gods, did bake it, like Aṅgiras, in the lap of the earth; and with their help he now bakes it. But, surely, these are the stars,&#8211;the women (gani) are indeed the stars, for these are the lights of those righteous men (gana) who go to the celestial world: it is by means of the stars that he thus bakes it.” Tr. Julius Eggeling</p>

<p>Rig Veda 6.47.5 “This very same exilir of devotional love finds the wavy sea of brilliant colours in fore-front of the dawns, whose dwelling is in firmament.

<p>Written by Sulaiman Razvi</p>
<p>Caste system is one of the evils of Hindu religion that still exists in the society. Caste system is nothing but isolating the low castes from the society. It divides people within the Hindu fold. The condition of low caste people has been miserable. Low castes people suffered the Brahminical oppression. The Untouchables were not allowed within the gates of Pune city under the reign of Peshwas and Marathas. In Gujarat the Untouchables were forced to wear horns. In Bombay they were not allowed to wear clean and untorn clothes. Read the article <a href="/index.php/2014/01/01/manu-and-shudras/" data-wpel-link="internal">Manu and the Shudras</a> for more information on the condition of low castes in ancient India. Low caste women were not allowed to cover their breasts. This was abolished by Tipu Sultan. But was again reinforced after his death. In the 18<sup>th</sup> century, Low caste women lead <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channar_revolt" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Channar revolt<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> which resulted in many low caste Hindus converting to Christianity. Oppression by Brahmins made low castes people embrace other faiths especially Islam. Swami Vivekananda wrote,</p>
<p><span id="more-2274"></span></p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p>“Why amongst the poor of India so many are Mohammedans? It is nonsense to say, they were converted by the sword. It was to gain their liberty from the . . . zemindars and from the . . . priest” <a href="http://www.ramakrishnavivekananda.info/vivekananda/volume_8/epistles_fourth_series/034_diwanji.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">[ Source ]<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p></blockquote>
<p>Islam came in India as a savior to the low castes. The low castes were attracted towards the equality given in Islam unlike Hinduism which discriminated people based on their birth. Although the Indian constitution guarantees equal right to every citizen irrespective of religion or caste. The menace of caste system still exists in India. A temple was washed after Bihar chief minister Jitan Ram Manjhi visited it [<a href="http://ibnlive.in.com/news/temple-was-washed-after-i-visited-it-says-bihar-cm-jitan-ram-manjhi/502685-3-232.html" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">1<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>], Dalits threatened the priests that they will convert to Islam if they are prohibited from entering the temple [<a href="http://www.firstpost.com/india/ghar-wapsi-fallout-meet-our-demands-else-well-convert-to-islam-say-dalits-2039485.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">2<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>], a Dalit man was set afire for fetching water at a hand pump [<a href="http://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/dalit-villager-set-afire-for-fetching-water-at-hand-pump-in-mp-s-sagar-dist/article1-1352018.aspx" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">3<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>], another Dalit man was killed for ringtone praising Dr. B.R.

<p>The National Human Rights Commission Report on the Prevention of Atrocities against Scheduled Castes says that, “every 18 minutes a crime is committed against a Dalit. Every day 3 Dalit women are raped, 2 Dalits are murdered and 2 Dalits Houses are burnt in India, 11 Dalits are beaten. Every week: 13 Dalits are murdered, 5 Dalits home or possessions are burnt, 6 Dalits are kidnapped or abducted.”</p>

<p>“…in 27.6% of India’s villages, Dalits are prevented from entering police stations. In 25.7% of the country’s villages, Dalits are prevented from entering ration shops. In 35% of villages, Dalits are barred from selling produce in local markets. In 47% of villages with milk cooperatives, Dalits are prevented from selling milk, and in 25% of such villages, they are prevented from buying milk altogether.</p>
<p>Further, according to official Indian crime statistics, 27 atrocities against Dalits are committed every day. 13 Dalits are murdered every week. 3 Dalit women are raped every day. A crime is committed against a Dalit every 18 minutes. This, despite the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989. Worse, these crimes are on the rise. According to data released by NACDOR, a total of 3,198 cases related to atrocities on dalits have been registered between 2004 and 2013 as against 1,305 from 1994 to 2003. These crimes rose by another 19 percent in 2014. According to statistics compiled by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), crimes against SCs rose to 47,064 in 2014 from 39,408 in 2013. In 2012 there were 33,655 crimes against dalits, about the same as in 2011…”</p>

<p>There have been thousands of caste related violence in India, you can refer to Wikipedia’s article <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caste-related_violence_in_India" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Caste-related violence in India<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. All these caste based violence perpetrated by higher caste people is wholly inspired by religious doctrine. Hindu god Rama is said to have beheaded a Shudra named Shambuka just because he was practising religious rite. With such kind of stories is sure to inspire radicals. Some apologists try to show that there is no caste system in Hinduism, that it is actually is based on profession one acquires. I would have appreciated their effort if they really wanted to emancipate the low castes. But there is actually a motive behind it. Politicians try to befriend Dalits only to garner votes and to use low caste people in riots. While religious leaders do it to get as many followers as they can, because more followers means more donations and popularity. One such Hindu reformer was Dayanand Saraswati who said that Veda treats all castes alike. But he said this only to get followers. He didn’t abolish the caste system, but upheld the caste system. He discriminated between the castes. He opined that the duty of a Shudra is to serve the Dvijas and held Manu Smriti has authoritative text, read the article <a href="/index.php/2014/05/01/mulshankar-and-casteism/" data-wpel-link="internal">Mulshankar and Casteism</a> for more information. Hindu terror organizations conducts Ghar Wapsi programs, rallies against minorities but they never conduct any event or program for the betterment of the low caste Hindus. Purusha Sukta is said to be the root of caste system in Hinduism, it is mentioned in Veda,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.90.12 The Brahman was his mouth, of both his arms was the Rājanya made. His thighs became the Vaiśya, from his feet the Śūdra was produced.<br />

<h1>Birth based caste system</h1>
<p>As we all know, caste system in Hinduism is birth based and not based on the profession acquired by the individual.</p>
<p>Apastamba Dharma Shastra 1.1.1.4-5 [There are] four castes Brahmana, Kshatriyas, Vaishya, and Shudra. Among these, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">each preceding (caste) is superior by birth</span> to the one following.</p>
<p>Mahabharata 13.143.6 “The illustrious one said, ‘The status of a Brahmana, O goddess, is exceedingly difficult to attain. O auspicious lady, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">one becomes a Brahmana through original creation or birth</span>. After the same manner the Kshatriya, the Vaisya, and the Sudra, all become so through original creation.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Kisari Mohan Ganguli writes,</p>
<p>”Nisargat is literally through creation or original nature, or birth. Of course, what is implied is that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">one becomes a Brahmana, or Kshatriya, or Vaisya or Sudra, through original creation as such, by the Self-born, that is, birth</span>.” [ <a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m13/m13b108.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Source<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> ]
<p>Narada Purana I.24.7-9 “Those castes are said to be four, viz., the Brahmans, Ksatriyas, Vaisyas and Sudras. Among these the Brahmana is the foremost. The Brahmanas, Ksatriyas and Vaisyas- these three are called Dvijas (the twice-born), because at first they are born of their mothers and later on, they are consecrated by means of sacred thread with due repetition of the Mantras (which constitute the second birth). <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Thus twice-born-ness is attained by these three classes</span>. All holy rites and duties must be performed by these castes in accordance with the specific duties prescribed for their castes. By failing to perform the holy duties prescribed for one’s own caste, one is called a heretic by learned men.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>It is mentioned in Bhagavat Purana,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 11.5.5 “But Brahmanas, Ksattriyas and Vaisyas, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">by virtue of their original birth</span>, and second birth through their Upanayana (investiture of the sacred thread) ceremony (become eligible for studies, performance of sacrifices, etc.)…” Tr. G.V. Tagare, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Manu 10.5 In all castes (varna) those (children) only which are begotten in the direct order on wedded wives, equal (in caste and married as) virgins, are to be considered as <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">belonging to the same caste (as their fathers</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">)</span>.</p>
<p>Acharya Medhatithi writes on Manu Smriti 2.148</p>
<p>“Jati stands for ‘Janma’, birth.”</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Uma Samhita 44.13 ”O excellent sage, birth as a man is very difficult to obtain; especially that as a Brahmin…” Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Padma Purana II.38.20b-24 “[The Sages said:] The three castes viz. brahmanas, ksatriyas and vaissyas are twice born. This (i.e. the Veda) is an ancient sacred text meant for all the castes. The beings behave according to the Vedic practices; therefor they (continue to) live. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">You are born in the family of Brahman. (So) you are a brahmana only</span>.” Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>Agni Purana 162.3-7 “…By reading the Vedas and practicing equally to all, a man enters the region of paradise. This is the prerogative of the twice born castes, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">specifically belonging to a Brahamana as his birth right</span>, as he might read the Vedas and realise the truths inculcated therein by living any of the four orders of life. A Brahmana by dwelling in this world, may attain the Supreme Brahma.” Tr. M.N. Dutt-</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>Vasistha Dharma Shastra 4.1-3 <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The four castes are distinguished by their origin</span> and by particular sacraments. There is also the following passage of the Veda, ‘The Brâhmana was his mouth, the Kshatriya formed his arms, the Vaisya his thighs; the Sûdra was born from his feet.’ <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">It has been declared in (the following passage of) the Veda that (a Sûdra) shall not receive the sacraments</span>, ‘He created the Brâhmana with the Gâyatrî (metre), the Kshatriya with the Trishtubh, the Vaisya with the Gagatî, the Sûdra without any metre.’</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>Mahabharata 13.27.3-6 “O best of kings, how may one, if he happens to be a Kshatriya or a Vaisya or a Sudra, succeed in acquiring the status of a Brahmana? It behoveth thee to tell me the means. Is it by penances the most austere, or by religious acts, or by knowledge of the scriptures, that a person belonging to any of the three inferior orders succeeds in acquiring the status of a Brahmana? Do tell me this, O grandsire!’ “Bhishma said, ‘The status of a Brahmana, O Yudhishthira, is incapable of acquisition by a person belonging to any of the three other orders. That status is the highest with respect to all creatures. Travelling through innumerable orders of existence, by undergoing repeated births, one at last, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">in some birth, becomes born as a Brahmana</span>.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>Skanda Purana clearly states that a Shudra must not study, must not sacrifice, he has to stay in the same state as at birth which is contrary to what apologists claim that a Shudra by studying Veda becomes a Brahmin,</p>
<p>Skanda Purana V.iii.122.16 ”A separate duty has not been assigned by Paramesthin to the Sudra. He need not have any Mantra, consecration or pursuit of lores. He need not have any conventional study of the science of words (i.e. Grammar) and special worship of deities. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">He has to be, day and night, in the same state as at birth</span>.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 10.3 <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">On account of his pre-eminence, on account of the superiority of his origin</span>, on account of his observance of (particular) restrictive rules, and on account of his particular sanctification <span style="color: #ff0000;">the Brahmana is the lord of (all) castes (varna)</span>.</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 1.98-99 <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The very birth of a Brahmana</span> is an eternal incarnation of the sacred law; for he is born to (fulfil) the sacred law, and becomes one with Brahman. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">A Brahmana, coming into existence</span>, is born as the highest on earth, the lord of all created beings, for the protection of the treasury of the law.</p>
<p>Katyayana Samhita 8.6 “Many wives of the same caste and of other castes existing, the rite of churning, for producing the Fire, should be done by the chaste wives of the same caste, on account of the superiority of birth.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Mahabharata, Santi Parva 12 Section 72 “…Matariswan answered, ‘The Brahmana, O best of kings, has sprung from the mouth of Brahman. The Kshatriya has sprung from his two arms, and the Vaisya from his two thighs. For waiting upon these three orders, O ruler of men, a fourth order, viz., the Sudra, sprung into life, being created from the feet (of Brahman). Originally created thus, <span style="color: #ff0000;">the </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Brahmana takes birth</span><span style="color: #ff0000;"> on earth as the lord of all creatures</span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">his duty</span> being the keep of the Vedas and the other scriptures. Then, for ruling the earth and wielding the rod of chastisement and protecting all creatures, the second order, viz., the Kshatriya was created. The Vaisya was created for supporting the two other orders and himself by cultivation and trade, and finally, it was ordained by Brahman that the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sudra should serve the three orders as a menial</span>.’ “Pururavas said, ‘Tell me truly, O god of Winds, to whom, this earth righteously belong. Does it belong to the Brahmana or to the Kshatriya?’ “The god of Winds said, ‘<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Everything that exists in the universe belongs to the Brahmana in consequence of his birth and precedence</span>. Persons conversant with morality say this. What the Brahmana eats is his own. The place he inhabits is his own. What he gives away is his own. He deserves the veneration of all the (other) orders. He is the first-born and the foremost. As a woman, in the absence of her husband, accepts his younger brother for him, even so the earth, in consequence of the refusal of the Brahmana, has accepted his next-born, viz., the Kshatriya, for her lord…” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>

<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<h2>Caste is based on Karma and caste of parents</h2>
<p>As per Hinduism, a person attains specific caste due to the deeds of past life, Krishna said,</p>
<p>Gita 18.41 “Of Brahmanas, Kshtriyas and Vaishyas, as also the Sudras, O Arjuna, the duties are distributed according to the qualities born of their own nature.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Ramanuja Acharya writes on this verse,</p>
<p>”The character of Brahmanas, Ksatriyas, Vaishyas, and Sudras arise from their various inherent dispositions. In other words their past Karma is the cause of their being born in a specific social group…”</p>
<p>Swami Swarupananda writes on Gita 18.41,</p>
<p>“According to the Karma or habits and tendencies formed by desire, action, and association in the past life manifesting themselves in the present as effects. Or, nature (Svabhava) may here mean the Maya made up of three Gunas, the Prakriti of the Lord”</p>
<p>It is mentioned in Brahma Vaivarta Purana,</p>
<p>Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Krishna Janma Khanda 74.10 ”According to Karma, some go to heaven or are severally born in the houses of a Brahmin, Ksatriya, Vaisya or a Sudra.” Tr. Rajnedra Nath Sen</p>
<p>Chandogya Upanishad 5.10.7. ‘Those whose conduct has been good, will quickly attain some good birth, the birth of a Brahmana, or a Kshatriya, or a Vaisya. But those whose conduct has been evil, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">will quickly attain an evil birth, the birth of a dog, or a hog, or a Kandala</span>.” Tr. Swami Nikhilanda</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><strong>CHILD BORN TO PARENTS OF DIFFERENT CASTES</strong></p>
<p>A Brahmin couple begets a Brahmin child, a Shudra couple begets a Shudra child.</p>
<p>Mahbharata 13.48 The Brahmana may take four wives, one from each of the four orders. In two of them (viz.,the wife taken from his own order and that taken from the one next below), he takes birth himself (the children begotten upon them being regarded as invested with the same status as his own)… A Kshatriya may take three wives… The Vaisya may take two spouses…<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The Sudra can take only one wife, viz., she that is taken from his own order. The son begotten by him upon her becomes a Sudra</span>….</p>
<p>But if parents belong to different caste then the child will not belong to either his mother or father’s caste,</p>
<p>Manu 10.5 In all castes (varna) those (children) only which are begotten in the direct order on wedded wives, equal (in caste and married as) virgins, are to be considered as <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">belonging to the same caste (as their fathers</span>).</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti 16.1-3 Sons [begotten] on women equal in caste [to their husbands] are equal in caste [to their fathers]. [Sons begotten] on women of lower castes, become of the caste of their mothers. Sons begotten on women of higher castes are despised by the twice-born.</p>
<p>Agni Purana 150.9-11 ”The duties which appertain to the Shudra caste, O thou best of the Bhrigus, are to serve the Brahmins and to practice the handicrafts. Since the investiture with the holy thread, a member of the twice born caste is supposed to take a second spiritual birth, and I shall describe the castes which children born of parents not members of the same caste, would respectively belong to. A child born of parents belonging to different castes would get the caste of its mother, but on the contrary a child born of a Shudra father by a Brahmin mother would be a Chandala.” Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 10.6. Sons, begotten by twice-born man on wives of the next lower castes, they declare to be similar (to their fathers, but) blamed on account of the fault (inherent) in their mothers.</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 10.16 From a Sudra spring in the inverse order (by females of the higher castes) three base-born (sons, apasada), an Ayogava, a Kshattri, and a Kandala, the lowest of men;</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>Manu Smriti 10.6-23 gives a list of castes that springs up due to inter-caste marriage. It is mentioned in Yajnavalkya,</p>
<p>Yajnavalkya Smriti verse 90 <span style="text-decoration: underline;">By men of the same caste (Varna) in women of the same caste (Varna) are born sajati (sons of equal birth or caste)</span>. In blameless marriages sons (are begotten continuing the line.</p>
<p>Like Manu, Yajnavalkya also goes on mentioning the list of castes from verse 91. However this system mentioned may not be applicable in the case of Niyoga. Because all men of Kshatriya caste were killed so the Kshatriya ladies went to Brahmins for contracting Niyoga and their son were considered Kshatriyas,</p>
<p>Mahabharata “1.104 And the illustrious scion of Bhrigu’s race, by means of his swift arrows annihilated the Kshatriya tribe one and twenty times. “And when the earth was thus deprived of Kshatriyas by the great Rishi, the Kshatriya ladies all over the land had offspring raised by Brahmanas skilled in the Vedas. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">It has been said in the Vedas that the sons so raised belongeth to him that had married the mother</span>. And the Kshatriya ladies went in unto the Brahamanas not lustfully but from motives of virtue. Indeed, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">it was thus that the Kshatriya race was revived</span>.”” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Sons born to father of higher caste (like Brahmin) are considered to be Brahmin in quality only, though of low caste than their father. It is mentioned in Manu Smriti,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 10.67-69 The decision is as follows: ‘He who was begotten by an Aryan on a non-Aryan female, may become (like to) an Aryan by his virtues; <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">he whom an Aryan (mother) bore to a non-Aryan father (is and remains) unlike to an Aryan</span>.’ The law prescribes that neither of the two shall receive the sacraments, the first (being excluded) on account of the lowness of his origin, the second (because the union of his parents was) against the order of the castes. As good seed, springing up in good soil, turns out perfectly well, even so <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">the son of an Aryan by an Aryan woman is worthy of all the sacraments</span>.</p>
<p>Some scholars interpret the ‘Sacraments’ here as minor sacrifice like Pakayajna which can be performed by low caste also. It is mentioned in Mahabharata,</p>
<p>Mahabharata 13.48.5 “The son that is begotten by a Brahmana upon a Sudra wife is called Parasara, implying one born of a corpse, for the Sudra woman’s body is as inauspicious as a corpse. He should serve the persons of his (father’s) race. Indeed, it is not proper for him to give up the duty of service that has been laid down for him.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>So this is yet another proof that caste is based on birth in a particular family, If a baby is born in a Brahmin family then he is a Brahmin but if he is born to a Shudra parents then he is Shudra by default which is his permanent caste for entire lifetime.</p>

<p>Mahabharata 12.188.5 “The complexion the Brahmanas obtained was white; that which the Kshatriyas obtained was red; that which the Vaisyas got was yellow; and that which was given to the Sudras was black.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Mahbharata 9.38.1-2 “Vaishampayana said, &#8220;Then Valadeva, O king, proceeded to Vinasana where the Sarasvati hath become invisible in consequence of her contempt for Sudras and Abhiras. And since the Sarasvati, in consequence of such contempt, is lost at that spot, the Rishis, for that reason, O chief of the Bharatas, always name the place as Vinasana.” Tr. Kisari Mohan Ganguli</p>
<p>Swami Prabhupada the founder of ISKCON said that Shudra must not be given freedom and must not be treated equally.</p>
<p>Swami Prabhupada said, “<em>Śūdra</em> is to be controlled only. They are never given to be freedom. Just like in America. The blacks were slaves. They were under control. And since you have given them equal rights they are disturbing, most disturbing, always creating a fearful situation, uncultured and drunkards. What training they have got? They have got equal right? That is best, to keep them under control as slaves but give them sufficient food, sufficient cloth, not more than that. Then they will be satisfied.” <strong>Room Conversation Varṇāśrama System Must Be Introduced — February 14, 1977, Māyāpura<br />

<p><strong>Greeting a Shudra is prohibited</strong>,</p>
<p>Atri Samhita 1.308 “He, who unknowingly salutes a lowcaste person, should immediately bathe and get [himself] purified by taking clarified butter.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<h2>Speaking with a low caste is prohibited</h2>
<p>Hinduism the so called most tolerant religion prohibits a Dvija to converse with a low caste,</p>
<p>Apastamba Dharma Shastra 2.1.2.8. As it is sinful to touch a Candala, [so it is also sinful] to speak to him or to look at him. The penance for these [offences will be declared].</p>
<p>Usana Samhita Chapter 2, Verse 4-6 “After conversing with a Chandala or a Mlechchha, after talking with abandoned women or with Sudras…drinking or touching urine and excreta, one should rinse his mouth again, even if he has rinsed it once…” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti 71.58-59 “Nor converse with a woman in her flow. Nor with the degraded and low-caste men.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<h2>One shouldn’t even look at the Shudra</h2>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana 14:1:1:31 <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">And whilst not coming into contact with Sûdras</span> and remains of food; for this Gharma is he that shines yonder, and he is excellence, truth, and light; but woman, the Sûdra, the dog, and the black bird (the crow), are untruth: <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">he should not look at these</span>, lest he should mingle excellence and sin, light and darkness, truth and untruth.</p>
<p>Usana Samhita 9.53 “By taking food, out of ignorance, after seeing a Mahapatakin, a Chandala, or a woman in [her] menses, one is purified [by fasting] for three nights.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Parashara Smriti 6.22 Having seen a Chandala, a Brahmana should cast look at the sun; having touched a Chandala a Brahaman should bathe with all his wearing apparels on.</p>
<p>One should avoid journey if one sees a Chandala,</p>
<p>Agni Purana chapter 230 “…A pregnant woman, a widow, drugs such as the Pinyaka, etc., a Chandala, a member of the Shvapacha or any other vile caste, a butcher, or a killer of birds, should be removed from the presence of a man, about to start a journey…” Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Hinduism also says that one should avoid the sight of a person who cooks for Shudra, who burns corpses of Shudra, a Chandala and equates them to bastard, theives etc,</p>
<p>Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Krishna Janma Khanda 78.33-41 “O father, now I am going to describe to you things whose sight is sinful. Bad dream is the root of sin and sole cause of calamity. The sight of the following…the cook of a S’udra, one who burns the corpse of a S’udra, a Brahmin who eats food prepared in connexion with the funerals of a S’udra…a S’udra, a widow, a Candal…a bastard, a thief, a liar…a Brahmin who is the husband of a barren woman, a S’udra who commits adultery with a Brahmin woman…” Tr. Rajendra Nath Sen</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 4.140. Let him not journey too early in the morning, nor too late in the evening, nor just during the midday (heat), nor with an unknown (companion), nor alone, nor with Sudras.</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<h2>Even stepping on Shadow of low caste is prohibited</h2>
<p>Dr. B.R. Ambedkar <a href="/index.php/2014/01/01/manu-and-shudras/" data-wpel-link="internal">wrote</a>, “Under the rule of the Marathas and the Peshwas the Untouchables were not allowed within the gates of Poona city, the capital of the Peshwas between 3 p. m. and 9 a. m. because, before nine and after three, their bodies cast too long a shadow; and whenever their shadow fell upon a Brahmin it polluted him, so that he dare not taste food or water until he had bathed and washed the impurity away. So also no Untouchable was allowed to live in a walled town ; cattle and dogs could freely enter but not the Untouchables.”</p>
<p>Usana Samhita 9.89 “By getting on the shadow of a lowcaste person, one should drink clarified butter after bathing. By looking at the Sun in an impure state, one should recite the Mantram Agnindraja.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Kurma Purana II.34.80 “…On treading the shadow of a Candala, one shall take bath and drink ghee.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><strong>Some other verses about discriminating the low caste</strong></p>
<p>Skanda Purana III.ii.40.63 “The Sudras who become antagonistic to those Brahmanas who were honoured by Brahma, Visnu and Siva go to the Raurava hell.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Narada Purana I.12.12 “Whatever is given in charity to one who habitually partakes of Sudra’s food or to one who cremates the corpses of Sudras or to one who takes food prepared by an unchaste woman, becomes futile.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Narada Purana I.23.26 “The observer of the holy rite should never talk to one who nourishes his progeny through a Sudra woman, to the husband of a Sudra woman and to one who performs sacrifices on behalf of those who are not eligible for the same.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><strong>PROHIBITED FOR A SHUDRA SERVANT TO MAKE WEALTH</strong></p>
<p>Mahabharata 12.60.28-29 “<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">A Sudra should never amass wealth, lest, by his wealth</span>, he makes the members of the three superior classes obedient to him. By this he would incur sin. With the king’s permission, however, a Sudra, for performing religious acts, may earn wealth.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Mahabharata 12.166.8 &#8220;The Shudra is not competent to celebrate a sacrifice. The king should, therefore, take away (wealth for such a purpose) from a Shudra&#8217;s house.&#8221; Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>So a Shudra servant cannot even amass wealth and rather has to seek permission from the king for making wealth.</p>
<p>Mahabharata 12.60.36 “The Sudra should never abandon his master, whatever the nature or degree of the distress into which the latter may fall. If the master loses his wealth, he should with excessive zeal be supported by the Sudra servant<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">. A Sudra cannot have any wealth that is his own</span>. Whatever he possesses belongs lawfully to his master.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 8.417 <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Let a Brahmana unhestitangly appropriate to himself whatever (his) Sudra (Slave) has earned</span>, inasmuch as nothing can be belong to the latter, he being himself an enjoyable good of the Brahmana.</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 10.129 No collection of wealth must be made by a Sudra, even though he be able (to do it); for a Sudra who has acquired wealth, gives pain to Brahmanas.</p>

<h2>Penance for killing a Shudra</h2>
<p>The penance for killing a Shudra is as same as killing animals in many Hindu texts while Manu Smriti prescribes death penalty for killing a Brahmin,</p>
<p>Mahabharata 12.165.56 “Having slain a dog or bear or camel, one should perform the same penance that is laid down for the slaughter of a Sudra.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Agni Purana 169.25-32 “…A man having killed a cat, a mongoose, a frog, a dog, a Godha, an owl, and a crow, should practice the penance he ought to have done, if he had killed a Shudra…” Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Following is the punishment to be meted out to a Shudra if he kills a Brahmin,</p>
<p>Narada Purana I.30.17-18 “On killing an ordinary Brahmana (by birth only who has not studied the Vedas, etc.), he should perform the expiatory rite for one year. O Brahmana, thus the mode of expiating for killing a Brahmana has been stated. The expiation for a Ksatriya is twice this and that for a Vaiya is thrice: Learned men know that the <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Sudra who kills a Brahmana is to be pounded to death with a club</span>.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p><a href="#top" class="broken_link">top</a></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<h2>Touching low castes makes on impure</h2>
<p>Hindu text prohibits a Dvija (Brahmin, Kshatriya &amp; Vaishya) to touch low castes especially Chandalas. And the penance for touching low castes is to consume Panchagavya which is a mixture of five products of cow like Cow Urine, Cow Dung, Milk, Curd and Clarified Butter. Which means that low castes in Hinduism are considered worse than cow dung and urine. There are four castes in Hinduism and there is no fifth caste. Groups like Chandala, Musahar… are outcasts i.e., they are outside the pale of four Varnas. They are called Achoots (Untouchables) in Hinduism. This may be because it is prohibited for Dvijas to touch them. Hindu text mentions Low castes, women in her menses on par with dogs and pigs and states by by touching this a Dvija ought to get cleansed. Hindu text goes on to say that a low caste intentionally touching a high caste person must be put to death,</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti 5.104 If one who (being a member of the Kandala or some other low caste) must not be touched, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">intentionally defiles by his touch</span> one who (as a member of a twice-born caste) may be touched (by other twice-born persons only), <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">he shall be put to death</span></strong>.</p>
<p>Another clear translation,<br />
Vishnu Smriti 5.103 “A man belonging to a caste that is not touched, and willingly touching the three [higher] castes, shall be killed.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Angiras Samhita 1.39 “When [a Brahmana] is touched by a woman in [her menses], <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">by a dog or by a Sudra</span>, he <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">becomes purified by the Panchagavya</span> after fasting for a night.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Angiras Samhita 1.9-10 “If he on any occasion, touched by a Sudra who has not washed his mouth after taking meals, he should bathe and recite [the Gayatri] and shall become purified by [fasting for] half a day. If a Vipra is [similarly] touched by a Vaisya, a dog or a Sudra, he shall after fasting for one night become purified with the Panchagavya” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dath</p>
<p>Parasara Smriti 7.22 “A Brahmana, who touched a dog, or a Sudra before washing his mouth, after eating, should fast for a day, and take the compound known as Panchagavyam in order to recover his cleanness.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>

<p>Apastamba Samhita 5.1-2 “What would be the form of expiatory penance for a twice-born one, who, touched by a Chandala, drinks water before performing an A’chamanam? A Brahmana under the circumstance, should regain his purity by fasting for three nights and by taking Panchagavyam, while the term of the penance is two days only for a Kshatriya, its other factors remaining the same.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Apastamba Samhita 7.5 “A woman in her menses, happened to be touched by a S’vapak or a Chandala, should fast for three nights and recover her purity by taking Panchagavyam, thereafter.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Apastamba Samhita 7.19 “A Brahmana-woman in her menses, happening to be touched by a S’udra woman, similarly circumstanced as herself, should regain her purity by fasting for a whole day and night, and by taking Panchagavyam.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Usana Samhita 8.75 “By touching a Chandala, a woman who has given birth to a Child, a dead body, a woman in [her] menses or those touched by her, or any outcaste, one should bathe for purification. If, out of mistake, one touches an article touched by a Chandala, a woman who has given birth to a child, or a dead body, purification is attained by bathing, rinsing the mouth and [thereafter] reciting the Gayatri.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Atri Samhita 1.263-4 “By touching a Chandala, an outcaste, a Mlechchha, a wine-bowl, or a woman in [her] menses, a twice-born person should not take his meals. If [he is touched by any of these] while taking [his] meals, [he must at once stop.] Thereafter he should not take his meals; and giving up his food, he should bathe. And being commanded by the Brahmanas, he should fast for three nights. And taking Yavaka (food prepared from barley) together with clarified butter, he should complete the sacrifice” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Atri Samhita 1.185 “…if a twice-born person being anointed with oil or clarified butter, touches a Chandala; he should, after fasting for a day and night, purify [himself] with the Panchagavya.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Atri Samhita 1.233 “The foremost of the twice-born, when, having still the leavings of food in his mout, touched by a caste outside [the pale of the recogniged castes], should, after fasting for five nights, get purified with the Panchagavya.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Atri Samhita 1.273 “By being touched by dogs, Chandalas, or crows, a woman in her menses should remain fasting till [the menstrual period] and should get herself purified by bathing in time.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Samvarta Samhita verses 178 “By touching Chandala, an outcaste, a dead-body, a lowcaste, a woman in her menses, and a woman in a state of impurity consequent on child-birth, one should bathe with the cloth on.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>

<p>Usana Samhita Chapter 5 Verse 30-32 “…One should not touch a person of grim visage, a Mlechchha and a woman in menses.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Angiras Samhita 1.37-38 “One does not become of pure conduct so long as the menstrual flow continues. When the menses is stopped, a woman may be employed in domestic works and known for sexual purpose. On the first day [of the menses], she is a Chandala woman; on the second, she is the murderer of a Brahmana; on the third, she is called a washer-woman; and on the fourth day, she becomes purified.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dath</p>
<p>Narada Purana I.14.2-3 “I shall mention the atonement to the person who, while taking food, touches an impure or a fallen person or a Candala, either out of anger or due to ignorance. Such a person shall perform bath three times a day (trisavana snana) either for three days or for six days. A Brahmana becomes pure by sipping paca-gavya (the five products of the cow taking collectively, viz. milk, curds, clarified butter, urine, and cowdung).” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti 23.41 Mire and water in the ruts on a high road, defiled by the touch of a dog, of a crow, or of a low caste person, as well as buildings constructed of baked bricks are purified by the winds.</p>

<p>Garuda Purana 1.222.20-21 “…A brahmin defiled by the touch of a dog or a Sudra defiled by Ucchista shall fast for a night and drink Pancagayva. He shall become pure. Touched by an outcaste he shall fast for five nights.” Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>

<h1>Torturing the low caste</h1>
<p>Agni Purana 227.21-31 “…a Shudra using force to a Kshatriya should have his tongue cut off. A Shudra who would aspire to give moral instructions to a Brahmana, should be punished by the king…” Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti 5.24 “If one delivers religious instructions with haughtiness, the king shall pour hot oil into his mouth.” Tr. Manmath Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 8.282-3 If out of arrogance he spits (on a superior), the king shall cause both his lips to be cut off; if he urines (on him), the penis; if he breaks wind (against him), the anus. If he lays hold of the hair (of a superior), let the (king) unhesitatingly cut off his hands, likewise (if he takes him) by the feet, the beard, the neck, or the scrotum.</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 8.272. If he arrogantly teaches Brahmanas their duty, the king shall cause hot oil to be poured into his mouth and into his ears.</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 8.270-1 <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">A once-born man (a Sudra), who insults a twice-born man with gross invective, shall have his tongue cut out</span>; for he is of low origin. If he mentions the names and castes (gati) of the (twice-born) with contumely, an iron nail, ten fingers long, shall be thrust red-hot into his mouth.</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 227.73-75 <span style="text-decoration: underline;">“A Sudra should be deprived of his tongue if he abuses violently a twice-born</span>, if his offence be moderate; if his offence be highest, he is to be fined Uttama Sahasa. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">A king should be put a red, hot iron spike twelve Angulas long in the mouth of a Sudra who vilifies violently one, taking his name</span>, caste and house. A Sudra who teaches Dharma to the twice born should also be punished by a sovereign by getting hot oil poured into his ears and mouth.” Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>The irony is that a Shudra is given corporal punishment for abusing Dvijas (Twice-born) while a Brahmin or other castes are not,</p>
<p>Gautama Dharma Shastra 12.11-13 But a Brahmana (who abuses) a Kshatriya (shall pay) fifty (Karshapanas), One half of that (amount if he abuses) a Vaisya, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">(and if he abuses) a Sudra, nothing</span>.</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 227.67-68 ”A Ksatriya who abuses a Brahmana should be fined 100 Panas, a Vaisya doing so should be fined 200 Panas, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">and a Sudra if he does so should be sentenced to capital punishment</span>. A Brahmana who abuses a Ksatriya should be fined 50 Panas, if he abuses a Vaisya, he should be fined 25 Panas <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">and if he abuses a Sudra the fine should be 12 Panas</span>.” Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 8.279-280 With whatever limb a man of a low caste does hurt to (a man of the three) highest (castes), even that limb shall be cut off; that is the teaching of Manu. He who raises his hand or a stick, shall have his hand cut off; he who in anger kicks with his foot, shall have his foot cut off.</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>If a Shudra is accused of committing some crimes, then he should prove his innocence by drinking poison, by means of fire ordeals etc.,</p>
<p>Agni Purana 255.32-47 “The accused should fast and bathe at sunrise with all his clothes on the day of the test, and pass through his ordeal in the presence of the king and the Brahmanas. An old, infant, blind, lame, invalid, or a female accused should be tested with the ordeal by scale, while the innocence of a Shudra, should be ascertained by means of the ordeal by fire, water, or the seven Yava (barley) weights of poison… In the ordeal by fire, the palms of the accused, should be first examined as to whether it had not been plastered over with clay… Then the accused should address the fire god as follows:- ”Thy seat is in the inside of all creatures, O Fire, and thou art the witness of acts of merit and demerit. I have held thee in my palms, speak truth, O god, as a witness of my innocence.” Then a red hot iron ball, weighing fifty Palas should be placed on his palms, covered as above and the accused or the person suspected, should be asked to slowly walk over seven Mandalas or rings… In an ordeal by poison, the accused should first address the poison to be imbibed… Thus having addressed the poison (born of a hill), he should imbibe the same in the presence of the assembled Brahmanas. His innocence should be established, if he could assimilate the poison safely without rethcing or vomiting.” Tr. M.N Dutt</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 9.248. But the king shall inflict on a base-born (Sudra), who intentionally gives pain to Brahmanas, various (kinds of) corporal punishment which cause terror.</p>

<h1>Discrimination on food</h1>

<p>Most of the crimes against Dalits is inspired by Hindu religious texts. There have been numerous cases where Dalit cooks were fired from their job because upper caste Hindus refused to eat food cooked by them, such as <a href="https://www.news18.com/news/india/up-students-refuse-mid-day-meal-prepared-by-lower-caste-cook-school-throws-out-food-after-protest-1871653.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">school children refusing to eat food<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> cooked by a Dalit cook and then threw the food, another <a href="http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-caste-hindu-parents-oppose-dalit-cooking-food-for-their-children-in-a-govt-school-in-tn-2639266" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Dalit cook was fired<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> after caste Hindu parent protested, a <a href="http://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/dalit-man-set-afire-for-fetching-water-at-hand-pump-in-mp/story-uUEGOUJbPUaqPivKfDdmfK.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Dalit man was set afire<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> for fetching water from a well, a <a href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/10-year-old-dalit-boy-thrashed-for-touching-mid-day-meal-utensils-in-rajasthan/1/490040.html" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Dalit boy was beaten up<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> for touching utensils of upper caste Hindus.</p>
<p>Forget about a Shudra eating with upper castes, a Shudra isn’t even allowed to eat cow dung and drink cow urine,</p>
<p>Apastamba Samhita 5.4 “Sudras should not be enjoined to drink Panchagavyam, inasmuch as they are not privileged to utter any Mantras. A Sudra, guilty of any delinquency, should regain his purity by confessing it to a Brahmana and by making gifts.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<h2>Eating remnants of Dvija master’s meal</h2>
<p>As per Hindu text the Shudra servant or slave must eat the remnants of his Dvija master’s meal,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 10.125 <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The remnants of their food must be given to him</span>, as well as their old clothes, the refuse of their grain, and their old household furniture.</p>
<p>Mahabharata 13.143.29 “As regards food, he should eat that which remains after the needs of all persons have been satisfied.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 5.140. Sudras who live according to the law, shall each month shave (their heads); their mode of purification (shall be) the same as that of Vaisyas, and <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">their food the fragments of an Aryan’s meal</span>.</p>
<p>Shudra here refers to those Shudras who are servants in the house of Dvijas and it also refers to Slaves. The Dvijas are not even allowed to give the leavings of their food to other Shudras,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 4.80-81; Vasistha 18.14 Let him not give to a Sudra advice, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">nor the remnants (of his meal), nor food offered to the gods</span>; nor let him explain the sacred law (to such a man), nor impose (upon him) a penance. For he who explains the sacred law (to a Sudra) or dictates to him a penance, will sink together with that (man) into the hell (called) Asamvrita.</p>
<p>It’s the highest level of hypocrisy, a Brahmin should feed his Shudra servant with the remnants of his meal but if a Brahmin accidentally eats the remnants of the food partaken by a Shudra or even in the company of a Shudra then he is to perform penance,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 11.153. But he who has eaten the food of men, whose food must not be eaten, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">or the leavings of women and Sudras</span>, or forbidden flesh, shall drink barley (-gruel) during seven (days and) nights.</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<h2>The penance for eating the remnants of Shudra meal is as follows</h2>
<p>Garuda Purana ch 231 “Articles of Indian bell metal, smelled by kine or defiled by the touch of residue of a Sudra’s meal, or by the contact of a dog or a crow, are purified by being rubbed with ten kinds of ashes. Having partaken his meal out of the saucer of a Sudra, a Brahmana shall regain his purity by fasting for a day, and by taking Panchgavya as well.” Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Garuda Purana 1.222.2 “If inadvertenly a brahmin takes food defiled by the Ucchista (residual of food partaken) of a Sudra he should fast for a day and night and drink Pancagavya. He shall be purified.” Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Atri Samhita 1.72 “By taking forbidden food, the residue of a food partaken of by a Sudra or a woman, or by eating forbidden meat, one should drink the extract of barley for seven nights. [74] By being touched by castes that should not be touched, one should bathe. He, who takes the residue of their food, should perform a distressing penance for six months.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti 51.57-58 “Having eaten the food of a Chandala, one shall fast for three nights. A Paraka penance is the expiation for eating the cooked food of a Chandala.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>For those who don’t know about Panchagavya. Let me tell you Panchagavya is the mixture of five products of cow, they are cow dung, urine, milk, curd and ghee. The leavings of a Shudra is considered so worst, And ironically it is cleansed by consuming cow urine and dung. Shudras are much worst than animal’s dung and urine as per Hindu text. Apastamba allows Dvija to partake the food cooked by a Shudra. Dayanand Saraswati had also used this verse from Apastamba to support his view that food cooked by a Shudra in the house of a Brahmin may be eaten. But Dayanand is said to have refused to partake the food in a Brahmin’s house that was cooked by a Shudra. So he didn’t practice it himself then how can he advocate this to others. As I said earlier, trying to give rights to low castes was a drama just to get followers. Dayanand didn’t abolish the evil Vedic caste system but upheld it. Read the article <a href="/index.php/2014/05/01/mulshankar-and-casteism/" data-wpel-link="internal">Mulshankar and Casteism</a>. As Dayanand had used the verse from Apastamba to support his view, let me quote a verse from Apastamba prohibiting it,</p>
<p>Apastamba Dharma Sutra 1.6.18. According to some (food offered by people) of any caste, who follow the laws prescribed for them, except that of Sudras, may be eaten.</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<h2>Eating food in the company or in the house of a low caste is prohibited</h2>
<p>Mahabharata 13.136.20-22 “<span style="color: #ff0000;">The Brahmana who takes his food in the company of Sudras is purged from all impurity by duly observing the ceremonies of purification</span>. The Brahmana who takes his food in the company of Vaisyas is absolved from sin by living on alms for three successive nights. If a Brahmana takes his food with Kshatriyas, he should make expiation by bathing with his clothes on.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Angiras Samhita 1.4 “When one drinks water lying stale in a vessel in the house of a lowcaste person, he should perform a penance. [7] By drinking, unknowingly, water from degraded castes, a Brahmana, fasting for a day and night, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">becomes purified with the Panchagavya</span>.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dath</p>
<p>Likhita Samhita verse 70 “By unwillingly partaking of boiled rice (lit. any kind of food) in a Chandala’s house, as well as of that prepared by a fallen or degraded person, one should live on water alone for a fortnight. The term of the penance should be extended to a month in cases where the delinquency has been knowingly committed.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<h2>Eating food cooked by low caste</h2>
<p>Other Hindu texts doesn’t prohibit a Brahmin from partaking food in the company of upper three castes (Brahmin, Kshatriya and Vaishya) but it clearly prohibits them from partaking food with Shudra (Anarya) and Mleccha (Non Hindus).</p>
<p>Angiras Samhita 1.48 “He, who continually partakes of a Sudra’s food for one month, becomes a Sudra in this birth and is born as a dog after death.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Brahma Purana 115.24 ”The food cooked by a Sudra is despised by gods and noble men, O goddess. That which is uttered by Brahma is authoritative.” Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 4.223. A Brahmana who knows (the law) must not eat cooked food (given) by a Sudra who performs no Sraddhas; but, on failure of (other) means of subsistence, he may accept raw (grain), sufficient for one night (and day).</p>
<p>Garuda Purana 1.115.7. ”Women perish due to their beauty, penance due to fury, the way due to an undue length and pious brahmana by taking sudra’s food.” Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Kurma Purana II.17.1 ”A Brahmana should not eat food offered by a Sudra whether out of delusion or otherwise. He who eats it, except an emergency, is born as a Sudra.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Narada Purana I.26.33 “One should avoid even from a distance, the wind from the winnowing basket, the smoke from the burning corpse, eating the cooked food of a Sudra and the contact with the paramour of a Sudra woman.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Atri Samhita 1.195-6 “A washerman, a cobbler, an actor, a Varuda, a Kaivarta, a Meda, and a Bhilla these seven are known in the Smriti, as degraded castes. By knowing their women, taking their food and accepting gifts from them, if willingly one should perform Prajapatya for a year; and, if unknowingly, two Chandrayanas.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Atri Samhita 1.168-173 “A twice-born person, who take food from a washer-man or from an actor, or from one who lives on bamboo work, should perform a Chandrayana. By knowing women of lowcastes, taking their meals and lying with them on the same bed, one should get [himself] purified with a Paraka. By drinking the water [that lies’ in a Chandala’s vessel, the foremost of the twice-born should live, for thirty-seven days, on barley and the urine of a cow. A Brahmana, who unknowingly partakes of cooked food touched by outcastes or by women in [their] menses, should perform half a Prajapatya. The [following are the means of] expiation for the four castes when they [happen to] partake of a Chandala’s food. A Brahmana should perform a Chandrayana; and a Kshatriya, a Santapanam. A Vaisya should perform a penance and live on the Panchagavya for six nights. A Sudra should perform [the same] for three nights and purify [himself] by making gifts.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Atri Samhita 1.248 “By knowingly drinking water from the Sudras, a Brahmana should fast for a day and night and [then] after bathing, should get [himself] purified with the Panchagavya.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Atri Samhita 1.208 “The celestials do not partake of the food nor drink the water offered by the foremost of the twice-born, who eats the food of a drunkard or of a Chandala.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Apastamba Samhita 9.40 “A Brahmana, drinking water in touch with a Chandala, should regain his purity by fasting for a day and night and by bathing thrice during the fast.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Angiras Samhita 1.53-55 “If a twice-born person, being fed by a Sudra’s food, procreates sons, those sons belong to him (i.e., the Sudra who gives the food): for semen originates from food. Any article touched by a Sudra, or any residue of his food, should not be given to a twice-born out of carelessness or with the one palm. So the ascetic Apastamva has said. One may always take a Brahmana’s food; a Kshatriya’s, on Parva-days; a Vaisya’s, in times of calamity; but never a Sudra’s.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<h2>A Dvija is punished for dying with the food of a Shudra in his stomach</h2>
<p>Mahabharata 13.143.18 “The food of a Sudra, O goddess, is always disapproved of by the high-souled deities. Even this, I think, is the authority enunciated by the Grandsire with his own mouth. If a Brahmana, who has set up the sacred fire and who performs sacrifices, were to die with any portion of a Sudra’s food remaining undigested in his stomach, he is sure to take birth in his next life as a Sudra.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Vasistha Dharma Shastra 6.27-28 <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">If a Brahmana dies with the food of a Sudra in his stomach, he will become a village pig (in his next life)</span> or be born, in the family of that (Sudra). For though a (Brahmana) whose body is nourished by the essence of a Sudra’s food may daily recite the Veda, though he may offer (an Agnihotra) or mutter (prayers, neverthless) he will not find the path that leads upwards.</p>
<p>Vyasa Samhita 4.64 “He, who dies with a Sudra’s boiled rice in his stomach, is sure to be reborn as a hog, and all his progeny will belong to the same genus, after death.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Skanda Purana VII.I.223.50 “If a Brahmana dies with the food offered by a Sudra remaining undigested within his belly he certainly becomes a Preta even if he has learned all the six Angas of the Vedas.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Preta means ghost.</p>
<p>Skanda Purana V.iii.11.30-31 ”Brahamana’s food is (regarded as) Amrta (Nectar); Ksatriya’s food is remembered as milk; Vaisya’s food is mere food, and Sudra’s food is proclaimed as blood. Those excellent Brahmanas who get nourished with Sudra’s food and juice and later die, become deprived of Tapas and knowledge and are born as crows and vultures.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Varaha Purana 174.42 ”He who dies with the food given by a Sudra within him, becomes a ghost.” Tr. Venkitasubramonia Iyer, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Mahabharata 13.141.38 “Another duty of the Brahmana consists in avoiding the food prepared by the Sudra.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Vasistha Dharma Sutra 10.31; 20.17; Skanda Purna V.iii.50.6-8 also prohibits the twice born from partaking the food of Shudras.</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<h2>Vessels touched by low caste becomes unclean &amp; also prohibition to use utensils of Shudras</h2>
<p>Usana Samhita 9.49 “By drinking water touched by a Chandala, the foremost of the twice-born becomes purified [by fasting] for three nights or by taking the Panchagavyam.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Samvarta Samhita verse 30 “He, who takes his food or drink from a Sudra’s hands, should get himself purified with the Panchagavya after fasting for a day and night. [32] By taking food in a vessel belonging to a Sudra or in a broken plate, one should get himself purified with the Panchagavya after fasting for a day and night.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Parasara Smriti 7.24 Vessels of bell metal, smelled by kine, or defiled by the touch of dogs, crows, etc., or out of which Sudras have taken their food, should be purified by rubbing them with ten kings of ashes.</p>
<p>Vyasa Samhita 3.53 “Boiled rice procured with one’s own earnings, or kept in a vessel which is not defiled by the touch of wine, nor licked by a dog, nor smelled by a cow, nor touched by a crow or a Sudra, is always pure.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Samvarta Samhita verse 194 “By taking food from the vessel of a degraded caste, or from that of a woman in menses, one would become purified, in half-a-month, by living upon barley and the urine of a cow.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Samvarta Samhita verses 182 “By drinking well water contaminated by a Chandala’s vessel, one becomes purified by living on barley and the urine of a cow for three nights.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Dr. B.R. Ambedkar lead <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahad_Satyagraha" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Mahad Satyagraha<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> in 1927 to allow untouchables to use public water tanks, this discrimination can be found in Hindu texts,</p>
<p>Parasara Smriti 6.24 “Having drunk the water of a well which has been defiled by the touch of a Chandalas water pot, a Brahmana should live on barley and cow’s urine for three days, whereby he would regain his personal cleanness.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Apastamba Samhita 2.2 “Having drunk water in a Prapa, or that lieing accumulated in a forest or in the furrows of a ploughed field, as well as that which is flowing out of a pond, or is owned by a Svapak or a Chandala, one should regain one’s purity by drinking Panchagavyam. [5] Having drunk water out of, or bathed in, a well or tank, caused to be excavated by another, one should regain one’s purity by drinking Panchagavyam.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p><a href="#top" class="broken_link">top</a></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<h2>Leftover food of Shraddhas to Shudras</h2>
<p>Guess what? Hinduism doesn’t even permit the Shudras to eat the leavings of a Shraddha,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 3.249 The foolish man who, after having eaten a Sraddha (-dinner), gives the leavings to a Sudra, falls headlong into the Kalasutra hell.</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana 2.3.15.56 ”The leavings of food from a Sraddha should not be given to women or Sudras.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Out of compassion a Brahmin may give the fragments of his Shraddha meal to his Shudra servant but never to other Shudras.</p>
<p>A sacrifice called Bhuta Yajna can be performed with the remaining food (not leftover food) and this is to be given to dogs, pigs and Chandalas,</p>
<p>Markandeya Purana 29.45-46 “Having done reverence to the gods, and the pitri and guests, relatives likewise, and female relations, and gurus also, the griha stha who has substance <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">should scatter the fragments on the ground for both dogs and low caste men and birds</span>.”</p>
<p>Kurma Purana II.18.105-6 “With the cooked food that remains after the offering unto Devas, one should offer Bhuta Bali. This should be known as Bhuta Yajna. It is the bestower of prosperity unto all embodied beings. O excellent Brahmanas, the cooked food should be given to dogs, cooker of dogs (i.e. Candalas), fallen persons (i.e. outcastes) and birds, on the ground outside.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 3.92. Let him gently place on the ground (some food) for dogs, outcasts, Kandalas (Svapak), those afflicted with diseases that are punishments of former sins, crows, and insects.</p>
<p><a href="#top" class="broken_link">top</a></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<h2>Shudra’s food at sacrifices</h2>
<p>It is mentioned in Smritis that the food offered to gods and manes will not be accepted if the sacrifice is assisted by the Shudra wife,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 3.18 ”The oblations, offered by a twice-born one who is assisted by a Sudra woman in the capacity of his principal married wife in the rite of a Pitri or Daivaa Sraddha ceremony, neither the manes, nor the divinity partake of. Even by practicing hospitality to Atithis, he cannot ascend to heaven, after death.” Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti 26.7 The gods and Pitris do not accept the oblations offered to them by (twice born ones), who perform the Daiva and Pritri (sacrifices), or propitiate the Atithis, in the company of their Sudra wives; such men go to hell.</p>
<p><a href="#top" class="broken_link">top</a></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<h1>Barred from sacrifices</h1>
<p>It is mentioned in Veda,</p>
<p>Krishna Yajur Veda 7.1.1.5 [After it the Anustubh metre] was created, the Vairaja Saman, of men the Çudra, of cattle the horse. Therefore the two, the horse and the Çudra, are dependent on others. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Therefore the Çudra is not fit for the sacrifice</span>, for he was not created after any gods.</p>
<p>Shudra is prohibited to participate in sacrifice just because of his birth in a Shudra family and one of the main reason behind Shudra been prohibited to participate in sacrifice is because it includes recitation of Vedic mantras and Shudras are clearly prohibited from uttering any Vedic mantra. Adi Shanakaracharya writes,</p>
<p>”But this scriptural ability is denied by the prohibition of the right to study. As for the text, ”The Sudra is unfit for performing a sacrifice” (Tai. S.VII.i.1.6), since it is based on a logic having common application, it suggests that the Sudra has no right to knowledge as well, for the logic applies both ways.” <strong>Shankaracharya on Brahma Sutra 1.3.34, Tr. Swami Gambhiranand</strong></p>
<p>It is mentioned in Brahmana,</p>
<p>Pancavimsa Brahmana 6.1.11 Out of his feet, his firm support, he created the twenty one fold (stoma); along with it of the metres the anustubh came into existence, of the deities none, of the men the Sudra. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Therefore the Sudra is, it is true, rich in cattle, but excluded from the sacrifice</span>, for he has no deity, as no deity had come into existence after him.</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Kailasa Samhita 6.12.22 ”The Vedas enjoin rituals for the first three castes. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Sudras are excluded since their only activity is service</span>.” Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Mahabharata 5.29.26 “The following are the duties declared for a Sudra from the olden times. He should serve the Brahmanas and submit to them; <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">should not study; sacrifices are forbidden to him</span>; he should be diligent and be constantly enterprising in doing all that is for his good. The king protects all these with (proper) care, and sets all the castes to perform their respective duties. He should not be given to sensual enjoyments. He should be impartial, and treat all his subjects on an equal footing.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 11.13. (Or) the (sacrificer) may take at his pleasure two or three (articles required for a sacrifice) from the house of a Sudra; <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">for a Sudra has no business with sacrifices</span>.</p>
<p>Mahabharata 12.165.8 “<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The Sudra has no competence for performing a sacrifice</span>. The king should, therefore, take away (wealth for such a purpose) from a Sudra house of ours.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Varaha Purana 211.4 ”Three castes participate in sacrifices and share their benefits in general. The Sudras are kept out by Brahmins from those that are purified by Vedas.” Tr. Venkitasubramonia Iyer, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Mahabharata 13.91.43-44 “From the place where the Sraddha is being performed, the Chandala and the Swapacha should be excluded, as also all who wear clothes steeped in yellow, and persons affected with leprosy, or one who has been excasted (for transgressions), or one who is guilty of Brahmanicide, or a Brahmana of mixed descent or one who is the relative of an excasted man. These all should be excluded by persons possessed of wisdom from the place where a Sraddha is being performed…” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Vayu Purana Part 2, 16.24 ”The naked and similar (apostates and non-Vedic sects) people should not see the Sraddha rite. This is the rule. Such Sraddhas as are seen by these, do not reach PItrs or Pitamahas.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Ganesh Vasudeo Tagare writes,</p>
<p>”…The text not only includes non Vedic sects like Jains and Buddhists but includes apostate Brahmins, atheists, committer of gross sins (maha-patakas).</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana 2.3.11.87 <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">”The following should always be avoided in the Sraddha ceremonies; Sudras</span>, milk of Avi (a variety of sheep), the varieties of grass named Balbaja, Virana and Otuvala, pebbles and Laddus (a sweetmeat?)” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Kurma Purana II.16.54 ”Instructions regarding observance of holy vows should not be given to a Sudra; a learned man should not expound Dharma unto him. No one should submit to anger and avoid hatred and passion.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Kurma Purana I.12.25b-26 ”The Almighty Lord created Brahamanas from his mouth and the Ksattriyas from his arms. The Lord created Vaisyas from both of his thighs. The grand-sire of the universe created Sudras from the pain of his feet. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Brahma created all castes excepting the Sudras, for the purpose of (performance of) sacrifices</span>.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Likhita Samhita verse 6 “The [three] twice-born castes have equal rights in both Ishta and Purtta works. A Sudra is entitled to [perform] Purtta [works] but not Vedic rites.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Manu 10.126. A Sudra cannot commit an offence, causing loss of caste (pataka), <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">and he is not worthy to receive the sacraments; he has no right to (fulfil) the sacred law </span>(of the Aryans, yet) there is no prohibition against (his fulfilling certain portions of) the law.</p>

<h2>Prohibition to perform sacrifice for low castes</h2>
<p>A good reply to apologists from Mahabharata,</p>
<p>Mahabharata 13.128.5 “That man who thinks it all right when a Sudra ignites the fire upon which he is to pour libations or who does not see any fault when women who are incompetent to assist at Sraddhas and other rites are allowed to assist at them, really becomes stained with sin.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Varaha Purana 112.16-22 ”One who receives Kapila as a gift from a Sudra should be considered as most lowly like a Candala. Therefore let not a Brahmin receive the offering from Sudras. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">They are to be kept far away like dogs during sacrifices</span>. They are discarded by the manes during new moon and full moon. They should not be spoken to and nothing should be received from them because they do only sinful deeds. Those (Sudras) who drink (the milk of) Kapila make their forefathers eat the filth in the earth for long. Note what happens to the Sudraas who feed on the milk, ghee and butter of the Kapila’s cows. They go to the terrible hell called Raurava. After living there for a hundred crores of years, they are born as dogs.” Tr. Venkitasubramonia Iyer, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Mahabharata 13.23.16 “Those Brahmanas who pour libations on the sacred fire for Sudras, or who are preceptors of Sudras, or who as servants of Sudra masters, do not deserve to be invited.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Narada Purana I.15.32b-34 “The Brahman who, on being invited by a Sudra, partakes of his food, should be known as a wine addict. He is excluded from all holy rites. That mean fellow who does the work of an attendant with the permission of a Sudra, incurs a sin equal to drinking of wine…” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Markandeya Purana 14.83 By receiving favours from an outcaste, by performing sacrifices for an outcaste, by constant attendance on an outcaste a man ever reaches the condition of an insect that lives among stones.</p>
<p>Markandeya Purana 15.1 For accepting anything of value from an outcaste, let a dvija be born an ass; but let him who sacrifices for the outcaste become a worm, on his release from hell.</p>
<p>Vamana Purana 12.86 “He who accepts Daksina from Candalas or Sudras, the priest and the person employing the priest to perform a sacrifice, every one of them is born as a big insect inside stone slabs.” Tr. Anand Swarup Gupta</p>
<p>Brahma Purana 108.37 “A Brahmana though well versed in the Vedas is born as an ass if he receives charity from a fallen person. [40-43]If he officiates at a sacrifice performed by a low person, he is born a worm and in the form of a worm he lives for fiteen years. Released from the form of worm he is born an ass and in the form of an ass he lives for five years; in the form of a cock for five years; in the form of a jackal for five years; then he is born in the form of man; then a jealous person; then an animal…” Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Yama Samhita verse 29-32 “…one who officiates as a priest for those to whom no such service should be given…all these should be carefully shunned at a Sraddha and [while making gifts].” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Gautama Dharma Shastra 20.1 Let him cast off a father who assassinates a king, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">who sacrifices for Sudras</span>, who sacrifices for his own sake (accepting) money from Sudras…</p>
<p>Usana Samhita 4.23-30 “The following are disqualified to be present at the Sraddha ceremony:- Those, who sell the Sruti; those who marry widows; those, who enter in to a locked room without the permission of the owner; and those, who officiate as priests for inferior castes; are described as out-castes.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Usana Samhita 9.56 “By officiating as a priest for servants, [or by helping] others (i.e., other castes) in other rites, by performing rites causing death to another person, and other unworthy deeds, [a Brahmana] becomes purified by three distressing penances.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>

<h2>Proof that Shudras were kept away from sacrifices</h2>
<p>Mahabharata 2.35.8-10 ”That (sacrificial) platform, crowded with the celestials, Brahmanas and the great Rishis, all endued with the Vedas, looked as beautiful as the sky studded with the stars .O king <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">there was no sudra or any man without vows near the inner (sacrificial) platform of Yudhisthira’s palace</span>. Seeing the prosperity of the prosperous and intelligent Dharmaraja, which was the result of that sacrifice, Narada became exceedingly happy.” Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Shudras are not allowed to participate in sacrifice or perform it. However Hinduism allows Shudra to perform minor sacrifices but without uttering any Mantra, they are to be kept away from sacrifices due to the fact that Shudras are not allowed to hear any Mantra,</p>
<p>Mahabharata 12.60 “Sacrifice has been laid down as a duty of the three other orders. It has been ordained for the Sudra also, O Bharata! A Sudra, however, is not competent to utter swaha and swadha or any other Vedic mantra. For this reason, the Sudra, without observing the vows laid down in the Vedas, should worship the gods in minor sacrifices called Paka-yajnas.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Other than the sacrifice to Manes, Shudras cannot perform any other sacrifice. As it is said that serving the twice born (Dvija) is equivalent to sacrifice for the Shudras,</p>
<p>Vayu Purana Part 1, 57.50 “Aranbha (expedition or enterprise) was a sacrifice for Ksattriyas. Havis (offering of ghee etc.) was the Yajna of Vaisyas. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Sudras had service as Yajna</span> and excellent Brahmanas had Japa (chanting of Mantras) as their Yajna.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Above verse from Vayu Purana is talking about the Treta Yuga. Treta Yuga is the second Yuga among the four Yugas or ages of mankind in Hinduism. It says that service to Dvija was the Yajna of the Shudras which shows that Shudras were not allowed to perform sacrifice in such earlier period also. However this is not just limited to the Treta Yuga but also applicable in the present Kali Yuga, it is mentioned in Mahabharata,</p>
<p>Mahabharata 12.232 “The growing of corn is the sacrifice laid down for the Vaisyas. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Serving the three other orders is the sacrifice laid down for the Sudras</span>.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>

<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<h2>Touch of dogs, pigs and low castes invalidates a sacrifice</h2>
<p>Manu Smriti 3.240-1 What (any of) these sees at a burnt-oblation, at a (solemn) gift, at a dinner (given to Brahmanas), or at any rite in honour of the gods and manes, that produces not the intended result. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">A boar makes (the rite) useless</span> by inhaling the smell (of the offerings), a cock by the air of his wings, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">a dog by throwing his eye (on them), a low-caste man by touching (them)</span>.</p>

<h1>Difficult for a Shudra to worship</h1>
<p>Skanda Purana II.iv.3.35-37 ”He who worships and bows to the idols installed by Sudras, goes to hell along with ten ancestors and ten descendants. If one touches the idol worshipped by a Sudra, he will burn (get burnt) his family up to the seventh generation. Hence one must enquire and worship an idol that has been installed by Brahmanas.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Varaha Purana 186.49-50 “But a Salagrama should not be touched by men of inferior caste or by women and Sudras. If a woman or Sudra touches it even out of curiosity, the result will be torment in hell till deluge.” Tr. Venkitasubramonia Iyer, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Narada Purana III.67.33 “One should not worship an idol if it crooked, burnt, or broker, if its head is split, or if it is looking upwards, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">or if it is touched by an amyaja (outcaste) and others</span>.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>A Shudra is not even allowed to utter Om.</p>
<p>Narada Purana III.70.72-73 “This is called Visnu Gayatri which removes all sins. Tara=om., hrt=namah, then bhagavan ending in the dative case, then vausdevaya. This great mantra consisting of twelve syllables gives enjoyment and salvation. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">This is to be used without tara=om by women and sudras</span> but by the twice born it is used with tara=om.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>A Shudra should also avoid Vedic Japa,<br />
Narada Purana, Uttarabhaga 61.51-53 “The procedure for the holy dip and the repetition of Japas is, in regard to the three castes, the same as mentioned in the Vedas. O fair lady, in regard to the Sudras and the women the repetition of the Vedic texts is to be avoided…” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>It is mentioned in Mahabharata,</p>
<p>Mahabharata 13.23.7 “Food that has been eaten by a <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">person incompetent to utter the syllable Om</span>, or that has been eaten by a person bearing arms, O Bharata, or that has been eaten by a wicked person should be known to form the portion of Rakshasas*.” Tr. Kisari Mohan Ganguli</p>
<p>Kisari Mohan Ganguli writes in the footnote,</p>
<p>”* i.e., any food, a portion of which has been eaten by any of these persons, is unworthy of being given away. If given, it is appropriated by Rakshasas. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">One incompetent to utter Om is, of course, a Sudra</span>.” [ <a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m13/m13a023.htm" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Source<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> ]
<p>Skanda Purana V.iii.228.9 “The following six things cause downfall of women and Sudras: japa, penance, pilgrimage, renunciation of the world, practice of Mantras and initiation for the adoration of a deity” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>

<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<h1>Barred from studying Vedas</h1>
<p>Not even a single Hindu text permits a Shudra to study Vedas. Puranas explicitly says that since Vedas cannot be learned by Shudra and women, the God composed Itihasa (Ramayana, Mahabharata) and Puranas for them,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 1.4.25 ”<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The</span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;"> degenerated twice-borns, the Sudras and women are barred from the holy truths of the Vedas</span>, and, out of compassion for them, Maharshi Vyasa composed the Mahabharata.” Tr. J.M. Sanyal</p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 1.3.18-24 “…knowing this in every Dvâpara Yuga Bhagavân expounds the holy Purâna Samhitas. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The more so because women, S’udras, and the lower Dvijas are not entitled to hear the Vedas; for their good, the Purânas have been composed</span>…” Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>But Shudras should hear Puranas behind a screen,</p>
<p>Garuda Purana I.20.13-14 “None of the other classes (Vaisya or Sudra) is authorized to hear the Purana. If, by mistake, he narrates it to an unworthy person, he becomes the object of censure. But, if he narrates the Purana from behind the screen, then both the deserving and the undeserving person become worthy to hear.” Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Same is repeated in Natya Shastra, Gods along with Indra approached Brahma and said,</p>
<p>Natsya Shastra 1.12-13 As the Vedas are not to be listened to by those born as Sudras, be pleased to create another Veda which will belong to all the Colour-groups (Varna). ‘Let it be so’, said he in reply and then having dismissed the king of gods (Indra) he resorted to yoga (concentration of mind) and recalled to mind the four Vedas.”</p>
<p>Brahma Purana 64.19 ”In regard to the people of the first three castes the rite of holy bath and the reception of Mantras is in the manner mentioned in the Vedas. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The utterance of the Vedic passage is to be avoided by women as well as Sudras</span>.” Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Garuda Purana gives an accounts of sins that will lead to hell in chapter 4 and it says that if a Shudra studies Vedas then he will go to hell,</p>
<p>Garuda Purana 4.22 “The Śūdra who studies the letter of the Vedas, who drinks the milk of the tawny cow, who wears the sacred thread or consorts with Brāhmiṇ women. [23] Having come all along the path the sinful reach the abode of Yama, and having come, by command of Yama, the messengers hurl them into that river again.” Tr. Ernest Wood and S.V. Subrahmanyam</p>
<p>Parasara Smriti 1.64 “Drinking the milk of a Kapila cow, knowing a Brahmana woman, and reciting the Vedas are the acts, by doing which a Sudra is punished with hell.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Apastamba Dharma Shastra 1.1.1.6 (For all these), excepting Sudras and those who have committed bad actions, (are ordained) the initiation, the study of the Veda, and the kindling of the sacred fire; and (their) works are productive of rewards (in this world and the next).</p>
<p>It is mentioned in Bhagavat Purana that twice born men only are entitled for performing sacrifices and to learn Vedas,</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 11.17.40 “All twice-born men — brāhmaṇas, kṣatriyas and vaiśyas — must perform sacrifice, study the Vedic literature and give charity. Only the brāhmaṇas, however, accept charity, teach the Vedic knowledge and perform sacrifice on behalf of others.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 7.11.13 “He is called a dvija or twice-born one whose (sixteen) purifying rites (accompanied by recitation of mantras) have been performed without any break in succession, and to whom god Brahma has designated as such. Performance of sacrifices, study of scriptures and charity are prescribed for all twice-born classes (viz. Brahmana, Ksattriya and Vaisya) who are of pure birth and conduct. It is for these that duties incumbent on different stages of life (asrama) are prescribed.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>But a Brahmin alone can teach the Vedas,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 1.103. A learned Brahmana must carefully study them, and he must duly instruct his pupils in them, but nobody else (shall do it).</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 10.1. Let the three twice-born castes (varna), discharging their (prescribed) duties, study (the Veda); but among them the Brahmana (alone) shall teach it, not the other two; that is an established rule.</p>
<p>If all the three castes have learned the Vedas then why does it differentiates the Brahmins, Kshatriyas and Vaishyas? As apologists claim that one who is learned in the Vedas is a Brahmin. And when Kshatriya and Vaishya are conversant with the Vedas then why a Brahmin alone should teach it why cannot a Kshatriya or a Vaishya teach the Veda?</p>

<h2>Scholars prohibiting teaching of Vedas to Shudras</h2>
<p>Acharya Medhatithi writes on Manu Smriti 2.241,</p>
<p>“Though the term ‘non Brahmana’ denoting all the three castes, except the Brahmana, stands for all men, yet the Shudra could not be meant here; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">for the Shudra is not entitled to learn the Veda</span>; and it is only when one has learn something that he can teach it. ‘But by transgressing the scriptural ordinance, the Shudra also might learn the Veda, just as the Ksattriya and the Vaishya do the work of teaching (which is not permitted).’ <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">This also cannot be; because it has been laid down that is the Shudra happens to learn the Veda, his body should be cut up</span>. And since the penalty is so severe, it follows that the act if a grievous sin.”</p>
<p>Adi Shankaracharya writes in the commentary of Gita 18.41,</p>
<p>“Sudras are separated from others who are all mentioned together in one compound word, because <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Sudras are of one birth and are debarred from the study of the Vedas</span>…” Tr. Mahadeva Shastri</p>
<p>Adi Shankaracharya also writes on Brahma Sutra 1.3.38</p>
<p>“38. And on account of the prohibition, in Smriti, of (the Sûdras’) hearing and studying (the Veda) and (knowing and performing) (Vedic) matters.</p>
<p>The Sûdras are not qualified for that reason also that Smriti prohibits their hearing the Veda, their studying the Veda, and their understanding and performing Vedic matters. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The prohibition of hearing the Veda is conveyed by the following passages: ‘The ears of him who hears the Veda are to be filled with (molten) lead and lac,’ and ‘For a Sûdra is (like) a cemetery, therefore (the Veda) is not to be read in the vicinity of a Sûdra</span>.’ From this latter passage the prohibition of studying the Veda results at once; for how should he study Scripture in whose vicinity it is not even to be read? There is, moreover, an express prohibition (of the Sûdras studying the Veda). ‘His tongue is to be slit if he pronounces it; his body is to be cut through if he preserves it.’ The prohibitions of hearing and studying the Veda already imply the prohibition of the knowledge and performance of Vedic matters; there are, however, express prohibitions also, such as ‘he is not to impart knowledge to the Sûdra,’ and ‘to the twice-born belong study, sacrifice, and the bestowal of gifts.’–From those Sûdras, however, who, like Vidura and ‘the religious hunter,’ acquire knowledge in consequence of the after effects of former deeds, the fruit of their knowledge cannot be withheld, since knowledge in all cases brings about its fruit. Smriti, moreover, declares that all the four castes are qualified for acquiring the knowledge of the itihâsas and purânas; compare the passage, ‘He is to teach the four castes’ (Mahâbh.).–It remains, however, a settled point that they do not possess any such qualification with regard to the Veda.”</p>
<p>Ramanuja Acharya writes on Brahma Sutra 1.3.38,</p>
<p>“38. And on account of the prohibition of hearing, studying, and performance of (Vedic) matter.<br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The Sûdra is specially forbidden to hear and study the Veda and to perform the things enjoined in it.</span> ‘For a Sûdra is like a cemetery, therefore the Veda must not be read in the vicinity of a Sûdra;’ ‘Therefore the Sûdra is like a beast, unfit for sacrifices.’ And he who does not hear the Veda recited cannot learn it so as to understand and perform what the Veda enjoins. The prohibition of hearing thus implies the prohibition of understanding and whatever depends on it.”</p>
<p>Madhvacharya first tries to say that Shudra can also study scriptures but later clearly prohibits a Shudra from studying Vedas,</p>
<p>“…For, in the text, ‘Let the Brahmana be initiated at the age of eight and let him be taught scripture,’ the ceremony of purification is mentioned as the immediate preliminary condition to teaching scripture. And in the case of the Sudra, the absence of this ceremony of purification is spoken of in the Paingin’s Sruti. ‘The Sudra has no consecrated fire, no sacrifice, no prayers, no ceremonies (to be performed); no process of purification, no austerities (to be practised). <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Hence the Sudra is not eligible for the study of Scripture</span>…Haridrumata having (first) concluded that ‘A non-brahmin is not capable of such truthful answer,’ (ib), and consequently Satyakama was not a Sudra, proceeded to perform the ceremony of initiation for him. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Hence the Sudra is not eligible for the study of the Vedas. For the Sudra is prohibited (from the study of the Vedas) as in the Gautama Dharma Sastra</span>, ‘The ears of him (the Sudra) who hears the Veda are to be filled with molten lead and lac, his tongue is to be slit if he pronounces it, his heart is to be cut open, if he attempts to know its meaning.’ And Smriti says, ‘the Sudra has no (consecrated) fire (to be maintained), no sacrifices (to be performed); so possibly he could not study the Vedas; however, free service to the three higher classes is prescribed for the Sudra, as the means of higher life’…” <strong>Madhvacharya on Brahma Sutra 1.3.36-38, Tr. S.Subba Rau</strong></p>
<p>Vijnanesvara writes in Mitakshara,</p>
<p>“Manu has also shown that the twice born alone are entitled to study the Dharma Sastras and a Brahmana alone can teach them and no one else.” <strong>Vijnanesvara in his book Mitakshara on Yajnavalkya Smriti verse 3</strong></p>
<p>Keshava Kashmiri writes on Bhagavad Gita 18.41</p>
<p>“…The Brahmins the priestly class, the <em>ksatriyas</em> or royal warrior class and the <em>vaisya’s</em> the mercantile and agricultural class are all spoken of in unison because they only have the right to initiation making them qualified to study the Vedic scriptrures, engage in <em>yagnas</em> or ritualistic propitiation and worship. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Whereas the </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;"><em>sudra</em></span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;"> or servant class are mentioned separately as they have not the qualification for initiation and study of the Vedic scriptures</span> but all are factually the product of their own innate natures.</p>
<p>To study the Vedic scriptures and perform <em>yagna</em> the prerequisite of initiation essential and required. A <em>sudra</em> is a fourth class citizen who may perform unauthorised activities without sin because they are only once born from the womb not twice born by the spiritual master. I<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">t is prohibited in the Vedic scripture to initiate a </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;"><em>sudra.</em></span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;"> If done it will bring calamity upon the spiritual master, his dynasty and the whole kingdom. There are direct references in the Vedic scriptures prohibiting </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;"><em>sudras</em></span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;"> from initiation</span>. Such passages as: The <em>sudra</em> carries the dead body to the cremation ground that is a <em>sudra</em> and if a <em>sudra</em> hears a mantra his ears should be filled with wax, if he recites a mantra his tongue should be cut out and if he memorises a mantra his life should be taken. So it can be understood that in ancient times the prohibitions of a <em>sudra</em> were strictly enforced…” <strong>Keshava Kashmiri on Bhagavad Gita 18.41</strong></p>

<p>Sridhara Swami writes on Bhagavad Gita 18.41</p>
<p>“…Now Lord Krishna commences a new theme with this verse explaining that the duties of the different classes of Vedic society such as <em>brahmana</em> or priestly class, <em>ksatriya</em> or royal and warrior class, <em>vaisya</em> or agricultural and mercantile class as well as <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;"><em>sudra</em></span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;"> or menial worker class which is the only one not qualified to take part in any Vedic activity as they serve the other three classes</span>.

<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>It is mentioned in Bhagvad Gita,</p>
<p>Gita 9.32 ”For those who take refuge in Me. O Partha, though they be of sinful birth- women, Vaisyas, and Sudras even they attain the Supreme Goal.” Tr. Swami Nikhilananda</p>
<p>Hindu scholar named Swami Swarupananda writes,</p>
<p>”Of inferior birth…Shudras because by birth, the Vaishyas are engaged only in agriculture, etc., and <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">the women and Shudras are debarred from the study of the Vedas</span>.” <a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/sbg/sbg14.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Source<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>

<p>”The Vaisyas are engaged in agriculture and trade; <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">women and Sudras are debarred from the study of the Vedas</span>.

<h2>Prohibtion to teach Vedas</h2>
<p>Skanda Purana III.ii.6.79 ”One should never teach a Vedic Mantra to a Sudra. (Thereby) the Brahmana becomes deficient in his Brahmanical powers and the Sudra in his merit” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>It is mentioned in Manu Smriti that sacrificing for a lower castes, or assisting them in sacrifice and teaching them is prohibited,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 10.109-111 <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">On (comparing) the acceptance (of gifts from low men), sacrificing (for them), and teaching (them), the acceptance of gifts is the meanest (of those acts) and (most) reprehensible for a Brahmana</span> (on account of its results) in the next life. (For) assisting in sacrifices and teaching are (two acts) always performed for men who have received the sacraments; but the acceptance of gifts takes place even in (case the giver is) a Sudra of the lowest class. The guilt incurred by offering sacrifices for teaching (unworthy men) is removed by muttering (sacred texts) and by burnt offerings, but that incurred by accepting gifts (from them) by throwing (the gifts) away and by austerities.</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 11.181 “By sharing the same bed, or cushion, or by riding in the same car with, or by eating in the company of a degraded person for a year, a man becomes degraded’ by teaching the Vedas to such a person, or by officiating as a priest at a sacrifice instituted by him, or by contracting any marital relation with him, one becomes degraded on the same day.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Same is repeated in Vasishta,</p>
<p>Vasistha Dharma Shastra 1.22 Now they quote also (the following verse): He who during a year associates with an outcast becomes (likewise) an outcast; not by sacrificing for him, by teaching him or by (forming) a matrimonial (alliance with him), but by using the same carriage or seat.</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti 71.48-52 “Let him not teach lessons to a Sudra. Nor give the leavings of his plate or the residue of clarified butter he has drunk to a Sudra. Nor sesame. Nor instructions in religion. Nor in the mode of practising Vratas.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Skanda Purana V.iii.228.8-9”One should not give knowledge, leavings of food or Havis to a Sudra. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">He should not be taught righteous and pious rites nor should he be initiated in Vratas</span>. The following six things cause downfall of women and Sudras: japa, penance, pilgrimage, renunciation of the world, practice of Mantras and initiation for the adoration of a deity” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Mahabharata 13.10.66-70 “<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Unto Sudras, therefore, the Brahmanas should never give instructions</span>. Hence, O king, the Brahmana should avoid imparting instructions (to such as are low-born), for it was by imparting instruction to a low-born person a Brahmana came to grief. O best of kings, the Brahmana should never desire to obtain instruction from, or impart instruction to, a person that belongs to the lowest order<span style="color: #ff0000;">. Brahmanas and Kshatriyas and Vaisyas, the three orders, are regarded as twice-born. By imparting instruction unto these, a Brahmana does not incur any fault</span>. They, therefore, that are good, should never discourse on any subject, for imparting any instruction, before persons of the inferior order.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>Vasistha Dharma Shastra 20.45. Property received from outcasts, after forming alliances with them either by (teaching) the Veda (and by sacrificing) or by marriage, must be relinquished. Let him not associate with such (men).</p>

<h2>Shudras studying Vedas is one of the evils</h2>
<p>Shudras studying the Veda and performing sacrifice are some of the evils of Kali Yuga predicted in Hindu scriptures,</p>
<p>Linga Purana Section I.40.40-41 ”Some sell Vedas and others sell Tirthas (holy waters) i.e. make illegal gain out of these. When Kali yuga begins heretics will be born who will be opposed to the system of four castes and stages of life. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Sudras will learn the Vedas and will become experts in the meaning of Dharma</span>.” Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Tulsi Ramayana, Uttara Kanda, Doha 98A-B.1 Dominated by women, my lord, all me dance to their tune like a monkey controlled by its trainer. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Sudras instruct the twice born in spiritual wisdom and, wearing the sacred thread</span>, accept the worst type of gifts.</p>
<p>Kurma Purana I.30.21-22 ”In Kaliyuga, the Brahmanas, dependent on the Sudras, hover round and serve the Sudras seated in their vehicles and eulogise them by songs of praise and prayer. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Dependent on Sudras, they teach them Vedas</span>. Due to the calamity of appeasing those without Vedas, they resort to terrible atheism.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 273.46-47 ”Thenceforward all this world will fall upon very bad times. Men will be liars, greedy, and destitute of righteousness, affection and wealth. The religion of Srutis and Smritis will become very lax, and so also will be destroyed the orders and castes. The people will be of mixed origin, weak in body and will be led astray and deluded. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Brahmanas will sacrifice for Sudras (or will study under Sudraas) and Sudras will take to teaching Mantras</span>.” Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 144.40-42 ”Many with them profess to be Brahmajnanis, because, thereby, they will easily earn their livelihood. Some hypocrites will mark their bodies with Vedic symbols also. In the Kaliyuga any body will study the Vedas; <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Sudraas will be experianced in the Vedas</span>. So there will be many false religionists.” Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>Narada Purana I.41.54-55 “The Sudras will not serve the twice-born. Assuming the airs of heretics, the base-born assume and practice holy rites of the Brahmanas. The Sudras will clothe themselves in ochre-robes; they will have matted hair; they will smear ashes all over their bodies. Thus equipped and employing deceptive arguments, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">they will begin to expatiate on Dharma</span>. [58-] Occupying excellent seats, Sudras will expatiate on Dharma-religious duties-to Brahmans who habitually destroy Dharma. These and many other heretics such as nude ascetics (Digambaras), red-roled mendicants, will roam about; most of whom will be decrying the Vedas. [71] After the advent of the Kali age, Sudras and outcastes will become kings and the Brahmans will be engaged in rendering service to them. They will be begging for alms” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Vayu Purana Part 1, 58.46 “Then, when the end of the age approaches, even the great goddess like the earth will yield but little fruit. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Sudras will begin to perform penance</span>” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Mahabharata 13.94.11 “[Rishi Agastya said] That Time has come upon us. Hence, Righteousness is afflicted. It is meet that I should go to heaven for good, before unrighteousness assails the world and establishes itself here! Before the time comes <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">when Brahmanas, loudly uttering the fully Vedas, within the precincts of villages and inhabited places, cause the Sudras to hear them</span>, before the time comes when kings often against the rules of Righteousness from motives of policy, I shall go to heaven for good.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>

<h2>Shudras hearing or reciting the sacred text</h2>
<p>Hinduism prohibits Dvijas (upper three castes) from reciting Vedas in the presence of Shudras,</p>
<p>Narada Purana I.15.100-1 “<span style="text-decoration: underline;">I shall mention the fruits of sins accruing to those who engage themselves in the recitation and study of the Vedas in the vicinity of women and Sudras</span>. Listen to it attentively. They are compelled to stand with their heads down and legs upwards. Thus, they are nailed to two pillars and are compelled to inhale smoke continuously in this posture. They stay thus for the period of year of god Brahma.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 4.99. Let him not recite (the texts) indistinctly, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">nor in the presence of Sudras</span>; nor let him, if in the latter part of the night he is tired with reciting the Veda, go again to sleep.</p>
<p>Usana Samhita 3.65 “No study [is allowed] in a village inhabited by low-caste people, near an irreligious person, when cries are heard and where there is a multitude of men.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Vasistha Dharma Shastra 18.11-14 Some call that Sudraa race a burial-ground. There (the Veda) must not be recited in the presence of a Sudra. Now they quote also the (following) verses, which Yama proclaimed: <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">‘The wicked Sudra-race is manifestly a burial ground. Therefore (the Veda) must never be recited in the presence of a Sudra</span>. Let him not give advice to a Sudra’…</p>
<p>Apastamba Dharma Shastra 1.3.9.6 He shall never study in a burial ground nor anywhere near it within the throw of a Samya. [8-9] But if that place is known to have been a burial ground he shall not study (there). <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">A Sudra and an outcast are (included by the term) burial ground, (and the rule given, Sutra 6, applies to them.)</span></p>
<p>Linga Purana Section I.85.161 ”The repeater of the mantras shall not perform japa in the open street, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">or in the presence of the Sudras</span> or in a ground smeared with blood, or sitting in a cot.” Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Usana Samhita 8.72 “By reciting the Vedas, dharma-Sastras and the Puranas before the Chandalas, one is purified by the Chandrayana. There is no other means of redemption for him.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti 30.4-15 “For the whole day and night the Vedas should not be studied on the eighty or the fourteenth day of the moon’s (wane or increase)…Nor near the Sudras and the degraded.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">It is prohibited for a Shudra to hear the Vedas</span></strong>,</p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 11.15.11-20 “As a man of a lowest caste acts contrary <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">and incurs a sin if he hears the Veda mantra</span>…” Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Mahabharata 2.44.15 “Desirous of speedy death, this fool had desired Rukmini. But the fool obtained her not, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">like a Sudra failing to obtain the audition of the Vedas</span>.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>If the Shudra somehow manages to hear the Vedas then he is punished in the following way,</p>
<p>Katyayana Smriti verse 486 “The king should punish a sudra, who forsakes the order of sannyasins (after having entered it) and who intently practises japa (silent muttering of prayers) and homa, with death (or corporal punish) or he should be punished with double the fine.” Tr. P.V. Kane</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><strong>If a Shudra pronounces the Vedic text then his tongue should be clipped off and body must be mutilated, </strong></p>
<p>Gauatama Dharma Shastra 12.4-6 Now if he listens intentionally to (a recitation of) the Veda, his ears shall be filled with (molten) tin or lac. If he recites (Vedic texts), his tongue shall be cut out. If he remembers them, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">his body shall be split in twain</span>.</p>
<p>Atri Samhita 1.19 “The Sudra who engages in the recitation [of the Gayatri] and the offering of oblations to the Sacred Fire, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">should be killed by the king</span>; for by that he becomes the destroyer of the kingdom as the water is of fire.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Skanda Purana V.iii.200.6 ”It has been decided that for merely pronouncing the Veda (Vedic text by a Sudra) the tongue of that Sudra should be cut off by Ksatriyas who are the protectors of Dharma” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Brihaspati Smriti 20.12 (A Sudra) teaching the precepts of religion, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">or uttering the words of the Veda</span>, or insulting a Brahman, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">shall be punished by cutting out his tongue</span>.</p>

<h1>Proof that Veda was not taught to Shudras</h1>
<p>Skanda Purana III.i.10.32 ”The Sudra named Drdhamati came to the hermitage and was honoured by the ascetics. He prostrated in front of them with the eight limbs (touching the ground). [34-44] Then he felt inclined to perform an excellent penance. So he approached the Kulapati (Head sage of the hermitage) and spoke these words… O sage of good holy rites, initiate me in the Yaga rite. O Brahmana, I belong to the Sudra community, O excellent one. I wish to render services to you. Be pleased with me who have sought refuge in you. When this was spoken by the Sudra<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">, the Brahmana spoke to him</span>: <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">A Sudra being low low birth cannot be initiated in a sacrifice</span>. Be pleased to listen. If you are so inclined, be engaged in service. No (religious) instructions is to be given to one of low caste. In instructing him, the preceptor incurs great sin. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">A learned man shall not teach a Sudra, nor should he perform a Yaga on his behalf</span>… <span style="text-decoration: underline;">If a Brahmana were to teach a Sudra these subjects, the other Brahmanas shall banish him from the village, from Brahmana community. One shall abandon like a Candala, the Brahmana who instructs a Sudra</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">One should avoid from afar a Sudra who is literate</span>. Hence, welfare unto you. Render service unto Brahmanas with reverence. Service to the twice-born has been prescribed by Manu and others (as the duty) of a Sudra.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Drdhamati was not taught Vedas just because he belonged to Shudra caste.</p>
<p>Ramanuja Acharya and Adi Shankaracharya writes that Gautama Rishi started teaching Vedas to Jabala only after he ascertained that Jabala was not a Shudra. They also prohibit teaching Veda to Shudras</p>
<p>Acharya Ramanuja writes in the commentary of Brahma Sutra 1.3.37</p>
<p>“37. And on account of the procedure, on the ascertainment of the non-being of that.<br />
That a Sûdra is not qualified for knowledge of Brahman appears from that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">fact also that as soon as Gautama has convinced himself that Gâbâla, who wishes to become his pupil, is not a Sûdra, he</span> proceeds to teach him the knowledge of Brahman.”</p>
<p>Shankaracharya writes on Brahma Sutra 1.3.37,</p>
<p>” 37. And on account of (Gautama) proceeding (to initiate Gâbâla) on the ascertainment of (his) not being that (i.e. a Sûdra).</p>
<p>The Sûdras are not qualified for that reason also that Gautama, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">having ascertained Gâbâla not to be a Sûdra from his speaking the truth, proceeded to initiate and instruct him</span>. ‘None who is not a Brâhmana would thus speak out. Go and fetch fuel, friend, I shall initiate you. You have not swerved from the truth’ (Kh. Up. IV, 4, 5); which scriptural passage furnishes an inferential sign (of the Sûdras not being capable of initiation).”</p>
<p>Gautama Rishi started teaching Vedas to Jabala only after knowing that he was not a Shudra, this shows that Veda was not taught to Shudras.</p>

<h2>Teaching Vedas to Shudras was considered a taboo</h2>
<p>Sita the wife of Rama said,</p>
<p>Ramayana of Valmiki, Sundara Khanda 28.5 “I may be slain by that dreadful monster but I can no more give him my affection than a <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">brahmin can impart the teachings of the Veda to one of low caste</span>.” Tr. Hari Prasad Shastri</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 9.18.14 “And we are even more respectable because we are in the dynasty of Bhṛgu. Yet although this woman’s father, being among the demons, is our disciple, she has put on my dress, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">exactly like a śūdra taking charge of Vedic knowledge</span>.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 4.2.13 “To this proud, impious fellow who has given up performance of religious acts, and has violated all the bounds (of religious prosperity), I gave my young daughter though <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">reluctant to do so, as one would be to impart the sacred beautiful word (Vedas) to a Sudraa (who is not eligible to receive Vedic lore)</span>.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 10.38.4 “<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Just as recitation and study of the Vedas is impossible to a person born in the Sudra class</span>, I consider that gaining even the sight of Krsnaa of excellent renown is very difficult for me, inasmuch as my mind is addicted to sensual pleasures.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Mahabharata, Adi Parva 1.160 “How shall I be able to place this sole daughter of thy house–this innocent girl–in the way along which her ancestors have always walked? How shall I then be able to impart unto this child every desirable accomplishment to make him virtuous as thyself, in that season of want when I shall become masterless? Overpowering myself who shall be masterless, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">unworthy persons will demand (the hand of) this daughter of thine, like Sudras desiring to hear the Vedas</span>.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>

<h1>Duty of a Shudra</h1>
<p>Garuda Purana ch 96 ”the sole duty of a Shudra is to render personal service to the foremost of the twice born castes.” Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 30.5 For Brahman (Priesthood) he binds a Brahman to the stake; for Kshatra (Royalty) a Râjanya; for the Maruts a Vaisya; for Penance [service] a Sudra;</p>
<p>Vamana Purana, Saromahatmya 22.38-39 “In its middle is a mighty Banyan tree, the embodiment of Sthanu. From Him have issued the castes, Brahmans, Ksatriyas, Vaisyas, and Shudras were born from Him to render service to the twice born…” Tr. Anand Swarup Gupta</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 3.8.33-34 “Attendance upon the three regenerate castes is the province of the Śúdra, and by that he is to subsist, or by the profits of trade, or the earnings of mechanical labour. He is also to make gifts; and he may offer the sacrifices in which food is presented, as well as obsequial offerings.” Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Narasima Purana 58.10-13 &#8220;The Sudra should serve all these three varnas and serve the Brahmanas like a slave. He should donate from his earning without asking for anything form others. He should do agriculture for survival. He should worship the stars every month as per the religion and justice and always wear old apparel. He should clean the pots used by the Brahmanas keep attachment with his own wife.&#8221; Tr. Joshi K.L. Shastri and Bindiya Trivedi</p>
<p>Sankha Samhita 1.5 Serving the Brahmanas, and performance of different handicrafts should be the specific duties of a Sudra. Practice of forbearance, truthfulness, and self-control, and cleanliness of body and spirit are equally obligatory on all, without any distinction of caste.</p>
<p>Katyayana Smriti verse 722 “One may make the sudra work as a slave, whether he be purchased or not purchased; the creator himself created him for slavery.” Tr. P.V. Kane</p>
<p>Mahabharata 13.141 “<span style="text-decoration: underline;">The service of the three regenerate classes constitutes the high duty of the Sudra</span>. That Sudra who is truthful in speech and who has subdued his senses is regarded as having acquired meritorious penances. Verily, the Sudra, who having got a guest, discharges the duties of hospitality towards him, is regarded as acquiring the merit of high penances. That intelligent Sudra whose conduct is righteous and who worships the deities and Brahmanas, becomes endued with the desirable rewards of righteousness.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 10.123. The service of Brahmanas alone is declared (to be) an excellent occupation for a Sudra; for whatever else besides this he may perform will bear him no fruit.</p>
<p>The same is repeated in Apastamba Dharma Shastra 1.1.1.7; Vishnu Smriti 2.8; Manu Smriti 10.334 and Yajnavalkya Smriti 1.120. Shudra’s duty is to serve the twice born but it is prohibited for twice born to serve low caste people,</p>
<p>Padma Purana V.9.40-47 …A brahmana should always avoid serving low people….</p>
<p><a href="#top" class="broken_link">top</a></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<h2>Punishment for not carrying out his duties</h2>
<p>Parasara Smriti 2.16 By not in any way serving the Brahmanas, and by doing heinous acts, a Sudra becomes short lived, and goes to hell, after death. These duties are imperatively obligatory on the men of four castes.</p>
<p>Skanda Purana III.ii.40.56 ”If a Sudra created for service does not serve Brahmanas, nor does he give the means of sustenance (to them), Hanuman becomes angry with him.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p><a href="#top" class="broken_link">top</a></p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<h1>Prohibition to intermingle</h1>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana 3:1:1:10. Let him not commune with every one; for he who is consecrated draws nigh to the gods, and becomes one of the deities. Now the gods do not commune with every one, but only with a Brahman, or a. Râganya, or a Vaisya; for these are able to sacrifice. Should there be occasion for him to converse with a Sûdra, let him say to one of those, ‘Tell this one so and so! tell this one so and so!’ This is the rule of conduct for the consecrated in such a case.</p>
<p>Samvarta Samhita verses 197 “By associating with an outcast for a month or a half, one would become purified, in half-a-month, by living upon barley and the urine of cow.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Parasara Smriti 6.43 “One should immediately come out of the room in which a Chandala has entered, and throw away all the earthen pots kept therein.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Angiras Samhita 1.49-50 “[Partaking of] a Sudra’s food, associating with a Sudra, sitting with a Sudra, acquiring knowledge from a Sudra, degrade even one burning with Brahma-energy. The twice-born person, who utters benediction before a Sudra and salutes him, that Brahmana as well as the Sudra go to hell.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Kurma Purana II.16 28-29 “The following eleven defects caused by mingling of the castes are called sins of intermixture (Samkarya Dosas) viz. sharing the same bed, sharing a common seat, sitting in the same row, sharing of the same vessel, partaking of the cooked food together, presiding over the sacrifices, teaching, marriage alliance, taking of food together, studying together, and jointly presiding over the sacrifices.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Inter-dining, sharing the same seat and doing other things together is a sign of civilization and a humane act while the Hindu scriptures views it as an evil thing.</p>
<p>Kurma Purana II.16.26-27 ”An excellent Brahmana shall not stay anywhere else except within half a Krosa of the holy river (1 Krosa=3 Km). He shall not stay near the village of the Sudras. He should not live in the same place with that of fallen castes, Candalas, Pukkasas, foolish fellows, arrogant persons, Sudras and the people of the lowliest castes called Antavasayins.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti 35.2-4 “He, who associates with an outcaste, for a year, becomes himself an outcast. Likewise, by riding in the same carriage, by sharing the same bed, and by eating (in the same row) with him.” Tr. Manmatha Nath dutt</p>
<p>Skanda Purana III.ii.6.76-77 ”Close association with fallen people is but conducive to one’s own fall. One should never offer a higher seat or rostrum to a Sudraa. (Thereby) a Brahmana becomes deficient in his Brahmanical powers and a Sudraa in his merits. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Instruction in Dharma to Sudras shall obstruct one’s own progress and glory</span>.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>A Shudra is punished if he sits on the same seat with a Brahmin</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 8.281. A low-caste man who tries to place himself on the same seat with a man of a high caste, shall be branded on his hip and be banished, or (the king) <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">shall cause his buttock to be gashed</span>.</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti 5.20 “If one (i.e., a low-caste man) sits on the same seat [with a superior caste] he, having his hip branded, shall be banished.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Varaha Purana 112.25-27 ”Once a Brahmin receives a gift from a Sudra, his ancestral manes fall into filth. No other Brahmin shall speak with him or share a seat with him. He is to kept afar. The Brahmin who, however, chances to speak with him or share a seat, shall perform Prajapatyakrcchra ceremony for purification.” Tr. Venkitasubramonia Iyer, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Vamana Purana, Saromahatmya 28.43-44 “At the time of creation Sankara was worshipped by the Lord on the northern bank of the Sarasvati known by the name Caturmukha. Having saluted Him with faith, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">a man is absolved of all sins, arising out of lustful intermixture of castes and interdining</span>.” Tr. Anand Swarup Gupta</p>
<p>Narada Purana I.41.33-38 “The Brahmanas and other castes get mixed with other castes mutually; all castes will be more or less like the Sudras, overwhelmed by lust and fury, confounded and afflicted by unncessary distress. In the Kali Yuga the excellent men become mean and the base men rise to excellence…Brahmanas become the pall-bearers of the Sudras…” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Narada Purana I.14.60b-62a “If one is touched by persons belonging to Candala and Svapaca castes, ablution (for purification) is enjoined even at night, but he shall not stay there with those low castes, at night, he will regain purity immediately after taking bath. If unknowingly a person had been careless enough to stay there (with low castes) at night, his sin is increased a hundred-fold.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Following verse shows prevalence of caste system under the reign of Rama,</p>
<p>Skanda Purana III.ii.30.93-94 “Ther was neither mental anguish nor illnes, O king, in the kingdom of Rama. All the women were chaste; all the men were devoted to their parents. Brahmanas were devoted to the (study of) Vedas always; Ksatriyas served Brahmanas. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Men of Vaisya caste continued to be devoted to Brahmanas and cows</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">There was no mixture of castes</span> and no transgression of duties. There was no barren or wretched woman; no woman had only a single child or had her child dead.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>This was the so called ideal state (Ram Rajya) of Rama.</p>
<p>Skanda Purana VII.I.206.6-7 “[Isvara said] If a Brahmana cooks food on behalf of a Sudra in the manner of Upaniksepa that food shall also be Abhojya (unfit for consumption) and the Brahmana falls down. The food of a Sudra, the association of a Sudra, occupying the same seat as the Sudra, and learning a lore from a Sudra – these will cause the fall of even the resplendent one.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>

<h2>Intermingling of castes is evils of Kali Yuga</h2>
<p>Linga Purana Section I.40.6-8 “Men perish. Ksatriyas and Vaisyas decline gradually. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">In Kali Sudras claim kinship with brahmins through their learning through interdining and sharing seats and beds</span>. Kings become mostly Sudras and they harass brahmins. Killing of foetus and murder of heroes become prevalent. Sudras adopt the conduct of life prescribed for the Brahmins and the brahmins adopt the ways of Sudras.” Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Brahmanda Purana 1.2.31.42 “Span of life, intellect, strength, beauty and prestige of the family dwindle down and become extinct. The Sudraas take to the conduct of life of the Brahmanas and the Brahmanas behave and act like Sudras.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Kurma Purana I.30.18 ”O tormentor of enemies, Sudras will be occupying lofty seats in the middle of Brahmanas. In Kali age, as a result of the influence of times, the king will dishonour the Brahmins.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Narasima Purana 54.44-46 &#8220;The Brahmanas, Ksatriyas, Vaisya and Sudra all will have over excitement and sensuality and reproduce a hybrid generation by mixing with one another.

<p>Hinduism prohibits inter-caste marriage to an extent. It permits a Brahmin to take wives of all four castes, but at the same time also prohibits to take a Shudra wife, Yajnavalkya and Vasishta are of the same view. However this has been interpreted by some scholars as, a Brahmin can take a Shudra wife but he should not have sexual intercourse with her in her ‘courses’ which can impregnate her, in other words it prohibits a Brahmin from begetting child on a Shudra wife, a Shudra wife is taken only for sexual gratification. As per Hindu scriptures a Dvija should take his first wife from his own caste and then of succeeding castes. A Kshastriya can take wives of his own caste, a Vaishya and a Shudra wife, a Vaishya can marry women from Vaishya and a Shudra caste while a Shudra can take only one wife from his own caste.</p>
<p>Gita 1.41-43 “By the prevalence of impiety, O Krishna, the women of the family becomes corrupt. Women corrupted, there will be intermingling of castes (Varna-Samkara), O descendant of Vrishnis. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Confusion of castes leads the family of these destroyers of families also to hell</span>; for, their forefathers fall (down to hell), deprived of the offerings of pinda (rice-ball) and water. By these evil deeds of the destroyer of families which cause the intermingling of castes, the eternal dharmas of castes and families are subverted.” Tr. A. Mahadeva Sastri</p>
<p>Madhavacharya writes on Gita 1.41 “When there is a resultant intermixture of castes due to the destruction of the family structure; those who are responsible are damned to hell; but not only these ruinous family members. Their forefathers are also sent to hell as well due to the cessation of the ritual offerings of food and water that are no longer given due to the fact that there no longer exist any male descendants to perform such rites”</p>
<p>Sridhar Swami writes on Gita 1.41 “When this happens there is an intermingling of castes and the ancestors of these destroyers of the family fall from heaven as they are deprived of their periodic ritual offerings of food and water.”</p>
<p>Kesava Kasmiri writes on Gita 1.41-42 “In regard to the result of undesirable progeny. The intermixture of castes that follow the family customs and honor the age-old Vedic traditions with those that do not causes a degradation in society and leads the family to a hellish existence. Not only this but the anscestors of such a family also suffer as well because there is no descendant qualified to perform the propitiatory rites prescribed in Vedic scriptures such as <em>sraddha</em> and <em>tarpana.</em> . Being deprived of these oblations due to the absence of qualified progeny as a result of destruction of the family structure the ancestors fall down from heaven and go directly to the hellish planets. In the previous verse the effects of the intermixture of castes as described in the Vedic scriptures regarding the ancestors has been determined. Now Arjuna describes the misery experienced for those who are responsible for causing this intermixture of castes beginning with <em>dosair</em> <em>etaih.</em> Due to these evils the essential duties prescribed in the Vedic scriptures for the four castes which are the authorised and proven means leading humanity to the highest good and which are faithfully instructed by holy sages and spiritual masters are all forsaken.”</p>
<p>Swami Nikhilananda writes on Gita 1.41-42 “…Mixing of castes – One of the evil consequences of the depletion of the number of men in society is that the women break the caste rules and traditions as regards marriage. Marriage outside one’s caste is considered irregular by the Hindu law-givers. Rice-balls and water- The reference is to the Hindu religious rites for the dead, known as the Sraddha ceremony, in which rice-balls and water are offered by the eldest son for the satisfaction of the soul of the deceased. This ceremony cannot be performed by children born of irregular marriages, that is to say, marriage in which husband and wife belong to different caste, Deprived of the rice balls and water, the soul of the deceased, according to Hindu tradition, goes to hell…”</p>
<p>Usana Samita 9.51 “By marrying in another caste (i.e., a Sudra maiden), one (i.e., a Brahmana) becomes a Mahapatakin (great sinner). By associating with such a sinner, one also becomes a sinner.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Agni Purana 150.14-15 A marriage should take place only between the members of the same class, the union of a person belonging to a higher class with one of the lower being always forbidden…” Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 9.34.32-91 “…This is a general remark; now hear everything in particular. O Chaste One! The Brâhmin wives of S’ûdras or the S’ûdra wives of Brâhmanas are Atyâgamyâs (very unfit to be approached) and blameable both in the Vedas and in the society. A S’ûdra going to a Brâhmanî woman commits one hundred Brahmahattyâs; so a Brâhmana woman going to a S’ûdra goes to the Kumbhîpâka hell. As a S’ûdra should avoid a Brahmâni, so a Brâhmana should avoid a S’ûdra woman…” Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Vamana Purana 35.21-27 “…intermixing in all the varnas (castes), abandonment of Omkara…marrying a low-caste woman like a Candala…all these entail suffering in hell.” Tr. Anand Swarup Gupta</p>
<p>Skanda Purana V.i.29.27-33 “…An uncivilized Brahmana who carnally serves a Sudra woman and one who marries a Sudra woman, both of them fall into the hell…” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Death Penalty for Intercaste marriage</span></h3>
<p>If a Shudra wants to marry a Brahmin women then he is given death sentence.</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 227.131 “If a low caste man wants to marry a high caste girl and does so would be punished with death; similarly a high class woman marrying a low caste man should be punished with death.” Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>Hindu texts award lesser punishment for a Brahmin man committing adultery but awards death penalty to Shudra if he commits adultery with high caste woman. It says that the Shudra must be burnt alive,</p>
<p>Vasistha Dharma Shastra Chapter 21 Verses 1-3 If a Sûdra approaches a female of the Brâhmana caste, (the king) shall cause the Sûdra to be tied up in Vîrana grass and shall throw him into a fire. He shall cause the head of the Brâhmanî to be shaved, and her body to be anointed with butter; placing her naked on a black donkey, he shall cause her to be conducted along the highroad. It is declared that she becomes pure (thereby). If a Vaisya approaches a female of the Brâhmana caste, (the king) shall cause the Vaisya to be tied up in Lohita grass and shall throw him into a fire. He shall cause the head of the Brâhmanî to be shaved, and her body to be anointed with butter; placing her naked on a yellowish donkey, he shall cause her to be conducted along the highroad. It is declared in the Veda that she becomes pure (thereby). If a Kshatriya approaches a female of the Brâhmana caste, (the king) shall cause the Kshatriya to be tied up in leaves of Sara grass and shall throw him into a fire. He shall cause the head of the Brâhmanî to be shaved, and her body to be anointed with butter; placing her naked on a white donkey, he shall cause her to be conducted along the highroad. It is declared in the Veda that she becomes pure (thereby).</p>
<p>Arthashastra of Chanayka Book 4 Chapter 13 A Kshatriya who commits adultery with an unguarded Bráhman woman shall be punished with the highest amercement; a Vaisya doing the same shall be deprived of the whole of his property; and a Súdra shall be burnt alive wound round in mats.</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 8.374 “For having sexually visited a woman of any twice-born caste, whether protected or unprotected by her husband, a S’udra shall be punished with the mutilation of his reproductive organ and a confiscation of all his goods and estates in the first named instance (i.e., for knowing an unprotected twice-born woman), and in the last named case he shall pay the penalty with his life and all his goods and estates will be escheated to the sovereign.” Manmatha Natha Dutt</p>
<p>Gautama Dharma Shastra Chapter 23 Verse 14-15 14. A woman who commits adultery with a man of lower caste the king shall cause to be devoured by dogs in a public place. He shall cause the adulterer to be killed (also).</p>
<p>Gautama Dharma Shastra 12.2 If he [Shudra] has criminal intercourse with an Aryan woman, his organ shall be cut off, and all his property be confiscated.</p>
<p>Apastamba Dharma Shastra Prasna II, Patala 10, Khanda 27 Verse 9 A Sûdra (who commits adultery) with a woman of one of the first three castes shall suffer capital punishment</p>
<p>Mahabharata 13.48 “It is only from sexual union of women with persons who should not have such union with them that mixed classes spring up.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Mahabharata 13.91.88.90 “That Sudra who has sexual intercourse with a Brahmana woman, has, after death, to take birth as a hog. As soon as he takes birth in the porcine order he dies of disease, O king. The wretch has next to take birth as a dog. O king, in consequence of his dire act of sin. Casting off his canine form he regains upon the exhaustion of his demerit, the status of humanity. The Sudra who begets offspring upon a Brahmana woman, leaving off his human form, becomes reborn as a mouse.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Garuda Purana ch 95 “A Brahmana is at liberty to take a wife from any of the first three social orders, or to put it more explicitly, a Brahmana shall marry a girl either of his own caste, or one belonging to the warrior (Kshatriya), or to the trading (Vaishya) community. Similarly a Kshatriya shalll marry a Kshatriya or a Vaishya girl, while a Vaishya shall take a wife from his own community, the marriage of a Shudra girl with a member of any of the twice born castes being hereby absolutely forbid.” Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Manu 3.14. A Sudra woman is not mentioned even in any (ancient) story as the (first) wife of a Brahmana or of a Kshatriya, though they lived in the (greatest) distress.</p>
<p>Some interpret it as, a Brahmin should not take a Shudra wife as his first wife. He can take four wives of succeeding castes i.e., first a Brahmin, second a Kshatriya and so on, His Brahmin wife is considered superior among wives of other castes.</p>
<p>Hindu text goes on to depict Shudra wives as sex objects when it says that a Brahmin can marry a Shudra only for sexual pleasure,</p>
<p>Vasistha Dharma Shastra 18.17-18 Let him not approach a wife of the Sudra caste after he has built the fire altar for a Srauta sacrifice. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">For a Sudra wife who belongs to the black race, (is espoused) for pleasure, not in order to fulfil the law</span>.</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti 26.5 ”The Sudra wife of a Brahmana can never be for virtue. She is only the object of enjoyment of a passionate Brahmana.” Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>The son of a Brahmin born to Shudra mother shall not inherit anything,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 9.155-6 The son of a Brahmana, a Kshatriya, and a Vaisya by a Sudra (wife) receives no share of the inheritance; whatever his father may give to him, that shall be his property. All the sons of twice-born men, born of wives of the same caste, shall equally divide the estate, after the others have given to the eldest an additional share.</p>

<h1>Segregation of humans into castes</h1>
<p>Hinduism even discriminates between the style of living. Nothing can be more disgusting than this,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 10.51-54 But the dwellings of Kandalas and Svapakas shall be outside the village, they must be made Apapatras, and their wealth (shall be) dogs and donkeys. Their dress (shall be) the garments of the dead, (they shall eat) their food from broken dishes, black iron (shall be) their ornaments, and they must always wander from place to place. A man who fulfils a religious duty, shall not seek intercourse with them; their transactions (shall be) among themselves, and their marriages with their equals. Their food shall be given to them by others (than an Aryan giver) in a broken dish; at night they shall not walk about in villages and in towns.</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>Hinduism also divides the lifestyle of persons belonging to different castes, it says all castes should dress differently, should have different names, should make houses differently, it completely divides their way of living,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 2.30-32 But let (the father perform or) cause to be performed the Namadheya (the rite of naming the child), on the tenth or twelfth (day after birth), or on a lucky lunar day, in a lucky muhurta, under an auspicious constellation. Let (the first part of) a Brahmana’s name (denote something) auspicious, a Kshatriya’s be connected with power, and a Vaisya’s with wealth, but a Sudra’s (express something) contemptible. (The second part of) a Brahmana’s (name) shall be (a word) implying happiness, of a Kshatriya’s (a word) implying protection, of a Vaisya’s (a term) expressive of thriving, and of a Sudra’s (an expression) denoting service.</p>
<p>Agni Purana 152.2-8; Vishnu Purana 3.10.8-12 ”The name of a Brahmin child should end with the term ”Sharma” (the happy one), the name of a child of the Kshatrya caste should end with the term ”Varma” (the defender or protector) <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">while those of a Vaishya or a Shudra child should respectively end with the terms ”Gupta” and ”Dasa” (slave)</span>.” Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>Manu Smriti 3.8-9 Let him not marry a maiden (with) reddish (hair), nor one who has a redundant member, nor one who is sickly, nor one either with no hair (on the body) or too much, nor one who is garrulous or has red (eyes), Nor one named after a constellation, a tree, or a river, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">nor one bearing the name of a low caste</span>, or of a mountain, nor one named after a bird, a snake, or a slave, nor one whose name inspires terror.</p>
<p>Hinduism also makes discrimination in marriages,</p>
<p>Agni Purana 153.1-4 “…A Kshatriya woman having been duly wedded, should hold an arrow in her hand, a Vaishya bride should hold a paddy measure while a Shudra girl should hold a cotton string in her hand just after the wedding ceremony had been gone through…” Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Method of building houses should also be different,</p>
<p>Matsya Purana 253.13-14 ”In laying the foundations of a building or digging a tank or well first it is necessary to test the nature of the soil before commencing the operations and lying Vastua. White earth is lucky for the Brahamanas, red is good for the Ksatriyas, yellow earth for the Vaisyas, and black earth is auspicious for the Sudras. This can be ascertained by digging. The earth tasting sweet is good for the Brahmanas…and astringent earth is good for the Sudras.” Tr. Taluqdar of Oudh, edited by B.D. Basu</p>
<p>Natya Shastra II.46-57 Direction of pillars (first to be raised) should be different as per castes</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>Garuda Purana 1.213.143 “The procedure of bath has been laid down thus by great men. While taking bath Brahmins, Ksatriyas and Vaisyas have to repeat Mantras. A Sudra has to observe silence during bath and perform Namaskara also silently.” Tr. J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Garuda Purana chapter 94 ”A member of any of the twice born castes, shall first take two draughts of water to rinse his lips with, and then cleanse his face with undisturbed and frothless water. The twice born shall purify their breasts, throats, palates and umbilical regions with water. It will be enough for women and Shudras to purify their regions of back and umbilicus.” Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>Discrimination even at performing funeral rites,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 5.92. Let him carry out a dead Sudra by the southern gate of the town, but (the corpses of) twice-born men, as is proper, by the western, northern, or eastern (gates).</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 5.104. Let him not allow a dead Brahmana to be carried out by a Sudra, while men of the same caste are at hand; for that burnt-offering which is defiled by a Sudra’s touch is detrimental to (the deceased’s passage to) heaven.</p>
<p>Agni Purana 158.38-51 ”A Brahmana who has followed the dead body of a Shudra to the burning ground or has joined with friends of such a deceased in mourning his death, becomes pure at the expiry of three days. On a Shudra woman having been delivered of a child in the house of a Brahmana, or a Shudra having, departed his life therein, the master of the house should abstain from making any gift or from undertaking any religious ceremony for the attainment of any object, for that entire day. Cooking pots and other articles of pottery should be thrown away and the flows an walls should be plastered over with a fresh coating of clay, whereby the house would be again clean and pure…” Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti 29.1-4 “one shall not allow the dead body of a twice-born person to be carried by a Sudra. Nor [that of a] Sudra by a twice-born person…The Sudras [shall never carry the dead body of a] twice-born one even if he be their father.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas and Shudras should have umbrellas of different colors,</p>
<p>Varaha Purana 128.38 ”The white umbrella is for the Brahmin, red for Ksatriya, yellow for Vaisya, and blue for Sudra.” Tr. Venkitasubramonia Iyer, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>

<p>Linga Purana Section I.85.216 “He shall not partake of the cooked rice touched and <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">defiled by pigs, Candalas</span>, wicked people and cock. If he eats it he shall repeat the japa hundred and eight times.” Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 12.55 The slayer of a Brahmana enters the womb of a dog, a pig, an ass, a camel, a cow, a goat, a sheep, a deer, a bird, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">a Kandala</span>, and a Pukkasa.</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 3.239 <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">A Kandala, a village pig, a cock, a dog</span>, a menstruating woman, and a eunuch must not look at the Brahmanas while they eat</p>

<h1>Sinners will take birth as low castes</h1>
<p>Garuda Purana 4.58-63 Thus, it is declared, O Tarksya, that there are many torments for the sinful. Why should I explain them fully, when they are spoken of in all the S’astras? Being tortured thus, men and women by thousands are baked in dreadful hells until the coming of the deluge. Having eaten there their undecaying fruits they are born again. By order of Yama they return to the earth and become unmoving and other creatures: Trees, bushes, plants, creepers, rocks and grasses, these are spoken of as unmoving; enveloped in great delusion, Insects, birds, animals and fish;–it is said that there are eighty-four hundred thousands of fates of birth-fates. All these evolve thence into the human condition; having come back from hell <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">they are born in the human kingdom amongst low outcastes</span>, and even there, by the stains of sin, become very miserable.</p>
<p>Garuda Purana 5.11 Who steals jewels is born in a low caste…</p>
<p>Apastamba Dharma Sutra, Prasna 2, Patala 1, Kanda 2.6 Thus after having undergone a long punishment in the next world, a person who has stolen (the gold of a Brahmana) or killed a (Brahmana) is born again, in case he was a Brahmana as a Kandala, in case he was a Kshatriya as a Paulkasa, in case he was a. Vaisya as a Vaina.</p>
<p>Skanda Purana V.iii.171.14-22 “…O excellent Brahmanas, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">these people fall into terrible hell and are reborn as Candalas</span>: those who do not take holy bath regularly; those who do not practise Japa, Homa, worship of Suras, hospitality to other people, performance of Pitr Sraddha during Parvas and also regular Dana…” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Skanda Purana V.iii.155.79b-89a “…Those who utter falsehood jeopardising cows and Brahmanas fall into the Kalsutraka hell. The torture therein as per the authors of the scriptural texts is indeed terrible. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">After experiencing those sufferings those who come back in the human world are born as men of low caste</span>…” Tr.

<h1>Response to Apologists</h1>
<p>Dalits suffered the Brahmincal oppression for ages then why suddenly some people has to show equality in Hindu scriptures instead of rejecting such anti Human scriptures? If Hindu scriptures really advocated equality for all then why did the Brahmins hid those verses in their dhotis? As I said earlier they have no sympathy towards the low caste people, all they want is votes and followers. In present age they cannot enforce their inhumane Brahmin laws moreover the constitution of India giving equal rights to everyone (including Dalits) is being one of the main reason some have started to show equal status (and also to present Hinduism in good light).</p>

<p>Converts to get caste, gotra of Hindu ancestors: Yogi Adityanath<br />
<a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Converts-to-get-caste-gotra-of-Hindu-ancestors/articleshow/45515721.cms" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Converts-to-get-caste-gotra-of-Hindu-ancestors/articleshow/45515721.cms<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>So Hindu scholars are still acknowledging the fact that caste is based on birth. The most common explanation given by Hindu apologists is that,</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><strong>CLAIM</strong>:- Hinduism doesn’t believe in caste system. Caste system was actually based on the profession, by the passage of time this system became caste system. It wasn’t based on their birth but it was wholly based on the profession acquired by the individual. If a Shudra studies the Vedas, he becomes a Brahmin.</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE:-</strong></p>
<p>I don’t need to refute this point, because the greatest scholar of Hinduism, Adi Shankaracharya had refuted this long ago,</p>
<p>“The pûrvapakshin maintains that the Sûdras also have such a claim… Smriti moreover speaks of Vidûra and others who were born from Sûdra mothers as possessing eminent knowledge.–Hence the Sûdra has a claim to the knowledge of Brahman.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">To this we reply that the Sûdras have no such claim</span>, on account of their not studying the Veda. A person who has studied the Veda and understood its sense is indeed qualified for Vedic matters; but a <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Sûdra does not study the Veda, for such study demands as its antecedent the upanayana-ceremony, and that ceremony belongs to the three (higher) castes only</span>. The mere circumstance of being in a condition of desire does not furnish a reason for qualification, if capability is absent. Mere temporal capability again does not constitute a reason for qualification, spiritual capability being required in spiritual matters. And spiritual capability is <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">(in the case of the Sûdras) excluded by their being excluded from the study of the Veda</span>.–The Vedic statement, moreover, that the Sûdra is unfit for sacrifices intimates, , because founded on reasoning, that he is unfit for knowledge also;”<br />
<strong>Shankaracharya on Brahma Sutra 1.3.34</strong></p>
<p>He also said in his commentary of Brahma Sutra 1.3.36,</p>
<p>“36. On account of the reference to ceremonial purifications (in the case of the higher castes) and on account of their absence being declared (in the case of the Sûdras).</p>
<p>That the Sûdras are not qualified, follows from that circumstance also that in different places of the vidyâs such ceremonies as the upanayana and the like are referred to.”</p>
<p>The statement that ‘Shudra becomes a Brahmin if he studies the Vedas’ is a white lie. Because not even a single Hindu scripture allows a Shudra to study Vedas. As Shankaracharya rightly pointed out that a Shudra cannot study the Vedas as learning the Veda requires one to go through the Upanayana ceremony and this ceremony is permitted only for upper three castes. Smritis gives instructions only to Dvija children but they doesn’t even mention about Shudra children, It is mentioned in Manu Smriti,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 2.35-40 According to the teaching of the revealed texts, the Kudakarman (tonsure) must be performed, for the sake of spiritual merit, by all twice-born men in the first or third year. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">In the eighth year after conception, one should perform the initiation (upanayana) of a Brahmana, in the eleventh after conception (that) of a Kshatriya, but in the twelfth that of a Vaisya</span>. (The initiation) of a Brahmana who desires proficiency in sacred learning should take place in the fifth (year after conception), (that) of a Kshatriya who wishes to become powerful in the sixth, (and that) of a Vaisya who longs for (success in his) business in the eighth. The (time for the) Savitri (initiation) of a Brahmana does not pass until the completion of the sixteenth year (after conception), of a Kshatriya until the completion of the twenty-second, and of a Vaisya until the completion of the twenty-fourth. After those (periods men of) these three (castes) who have not received the sacrament at the proper time, become Vratyas (outcasts), excluded from the Savitri (initiation) and despised by the Aryans. With such men, if they have not been purified according to the rule, let no Brahmana ever, even in times of distress, form a connexion either through the Veda or by marriage.</p>

<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>As you can see Manu only gives instructions about when Dvija students should be initiated but not about Shudra students, Yajnavalkya is of the same view,</p>
<p>Yajnavalkya Smriti verse 14 In the eighth year of conception or in the eighth (year of) birth, the Upanayana ceremony of the Brahmanas, of the Ksatriyas in the eleventh; of the Vaisyas in eleven plus one. Some say according to family custom. It is mentioned in</p>
<p>It is mentioned in Agni Purana,</p>
<p>Agni Purana 152.2-8 ”The rite of Chudakaranam (binding of the tuff of hair on the crown of a child) together with that of Upanayanam (investiture with the holy thread in the case of a Brahmana child) should be performed in its eighth year or in the eighth year counted from the period of jestation, while the same should be performed in the eleventh and the twelfth year (counterd from the period of gestation) in the case of a Kshatriya, and Vaishya child respectively.” Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Acharya Medhatithi writes,</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">“…</span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #000000;">Of these four, three castes are ‘twice born’, the initiatory rite being prescribed for them. </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">‘One caste’ is the Shudra; there is no Initiatory Rite for him</span><span style="color: #000000;">; since the injunction of this rite </span><span style="color: #000000;">contains the distinct mention of the three castes, Brahmanas and the rest; e.g., the Brahmana shall be initiated in the eight year, the Ksattriya in the eleventh and the Vaishya in the twelfth; and </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">nowhere is the name of the Shudra mentioned</span><span style="color: #000000;">…” </span><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Medhatithi on Manu Smriti 10.4</span></strong></p>
<p>Vyasa Samhita 1.5-6 “The term ‘twice-born’ denotes the Brahmanas, Kshatriyas, and Vaishyas. Only these three orders are entitled to practise religious rites propounded in the Srutis, Smritis and Puranas in exclusion of all other castes. The fourth order is the Sudra, hence the Sudras, are entitled to practise religious rites, but they are not privileged to recite any Vedic Mantras, nor to pronounce the terms Savaha, Svadha and Vashat.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Apastamba Samhita 5.3 “No expiatory penance, vow, Tapassya, or Homa exists for a member of the fourth social order (Sudra).” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Narada Purana I.24.19-27 “(The duties of a Brahmana are:) He should offer charitable gifts to the Brahmans; he should worship the gods by means of sacrifices; for the sake of livelihood he may beg for alms; he should teach others. He should perform sacrifices on behalf of those who are eligible for the same; he should perpetually offer water libations; he should learn the Vedas and maintain sacrificial fires…(The duties of a Ksatriya are): O excellent Brahman, a Ksatriya should give charitable gifts to Brahmanas, he should learn the Vedas; he should worship Devas by performance of sacrifices…O excellent Brahman, breeding of cattle, commerce, agriculture and study of the Vedas are glorified as the duties of the Vaisya also…A Sudra also should give charitable gifts, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">but he should not perform domestic sacrifices involving cooking. He should render service to the Brahmans, Ksatriyas and the Vaisyas</span>.” Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Narada Purana says that Brahmins, Kshatriya and Vaishya should study Vedas but Shudras should engage themselves only in serving the twice-born. As you can see Hindu texts gives instructions on when Brahmin, Kshatria and Vaishya children should be initiated for Vedic study but they don’t mention about Shudra children as Shudra by birth has no right to study the Veda, they are completely barred from the Vedas.</p>

<p><strong>PERFORMANCE OF SACRIFICE IS PERMITTED ONLY FOR THREE CASTES</strong></p>
<p>Manu Smriti 2.16 “He, whose all life, from the rite of Nisheka to that of funeral, is governed by the regulations of the Sastrass, is alone competent to read, or to hear this Sastra, and no other.” Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>

<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>Yajnavalkya Smriti verse 10 “The castes are the Brahmanas, the Ksatriyas, the Vaisyas and the Sudras. Only the first three (of these) are twice-born, the performance of the ceremonies beginning with the rite of impregnation and ending (with the funeral rites) in the cremation ground, of these only, is prescribed with sacred formulas.”</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti 2.2-3 “The first three of these are (called) twice-born. For them the whole number of ceremonies, which begin with the impregnation and end with the ceremony of burning the dead body, have to be performed with (the recitation of) Mantras.</p>
<p>Mahabharata 3.149 “while to serve the twice-born orders is said to be the duty of the Sudra. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">The Sudras cannot beg alms, or perform </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">homas</span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">, or observe vows</span>; and they must dwell in the habitation of their masters.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p><strong>Another claim is that</strong></p>
<p>If a Brahmin doesn’t study the Vedas then he becomes a Shudra</p>
<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Brahmin whether learned or illiterate is still a Brahmin due to his birth</span></h3>
<p>It’s true to an extent. If a Brahmin doesn’t study the Vedas then he looses his rank. This is actually quoted out of context. When Hindu text says “loses the rank of a Brahmin”, it connotes degradation and losing the authority to perform rites. It doesn’t literary mean that the Brahmin just by refusing to study the Vedas becomes low caste. However there are expiations for all such sins in which the Brahmin looses his rank but there is absolutely no instruction which can elevate a Shudra to the status of a Brahmin in the same life. Can any apologist quote a single verse which says that if a Shudra studies the Vedas then he can become Brahmin in the very same life? It is mentioned in Upanishad,</p>
<p>Chandogya Upanishad 6.1.1. Harih, Om. There lived once Svetaketu Aruneya (the grandson of Aruna). To him his father (Uddilaka, the son of Aruna) said: ‘Svetaketu, go to school; for there is none belonging to our race, darling, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">who, not having studied (the Veda), is, as it were, a Brahmana by birth only</span>.’</p>
<p>As you can see, a Brahmin is still considered a Brahmin just on the basis of his birth even if he has not studied the Veda. For detailed explanation on this Brahmin loosing his status issue, read the article <a href="/index.php/2014/05/01/response-to-manu-smriti-and-shudras/" data-wpel-link="internal">Response to Manu Smriti and Shudras</a>. Hindu scripture rather says that a Brahmin whether he has learned the Vedas or not is still a Brahmin. It is mentioned in Mahabharata,</p>
<p>Mahabharata 3.199.88 “Whether the <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Brahmana be cognisant of the </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Vedas</span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;"> or ignorant of them</span>, whether they be pure or impure, they should never be insulted, for Brahmanas are like fires.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>How can one remain a Brahmin if is he is ignorant of Vedas? As it is claimed by apologists that one ignorant of Vedas becomes a Shudra.</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>Mahabharata and Smriti shows that even if one is ignorant of the Vedas then he is still a Brahmin due to his birth (in a Brahmin family). Mahabharata and Maharshi Manu lists learned Brahmin and unlearned Brahmin separately,</p>
<p>Mahabharata 12.180 “Thou, O Kasyapa, art a human being! Amongst human beings, thou art again a Brahmana. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Among Brahmanas, thou art again one that is conversant with the Vedas</span>.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 1.96-97 Of created beings the most excellent are said to be those which are animated; of the animated, those which subsist by intelligence; of the intelligent, mankind; and of men, the Brahmanas; <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Of Brahmanas, those learned (in the Veda)</span>; of the learned, those who recognise (the necessity and the manner of performing the prescribed duties); of those who possess this knowledge, those who perform them; of the performers, those who know the Brahman.</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 9.317. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">A Brahmana, be he ignorant or learned</span>, is a great divinity, just as the fire, whether carried forth (for the performance of a burnt-oblation) or not carried forth, is a great divinity.</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 2.118. A Brahmana who completely governs himself, though he know the Savitri only, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">is better than he who knows the three Vedas</span>, (but) does not control himself, eats all (sorts of) food, and sells all (sorts of goods).</p>
<p>This again implies that one need not study Vedas to be a Brahmin as it is all based on one’s birth. A Brahmin whether learned or unlearned is a Brahmin. Hindu apologists should know that a learned Brahmin is called Vipra. There is an example too in Puranas where a man born in a Brahmin family was still considered a Brahmin despite not knowing Vedas and engaged in sinful activities,</p>
<p>Varaha Purana 167.3-4 “Varaha said:- In Ujjayini <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">there was a Brahmin</span> who never cared for the rules of virtuous life. He never worshipped gods and never bowed to the saints. He never bathed in any holy tirtha. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">He knew neither the Vedas nor the Vedangas</span>. He was lustful and longed for the wives of others.” Tr. Vekitasubramonia Iyer, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Vyasa Samhita 4.41-43 “One, born of the seeds of a Brahmana but not purified with any of the purificatory rites or Mantras, and making use of his caste as a means of livelihood, is called a Sama Brahmana. A Brahmana, unto whom all the purificatory rites of Garbhdanam, etc., have been performed, but who has neither read nor taught any part of the Vedas, is called a Vruva Brahmana. A Brahmana, who practises penitential austerities and performs the rite of Homa, every day, and teaches the Vedas with their Kalpas and Rahasyas, is called an Acharyaya.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Parasara Smriti 8.11 “Brahmanas, who are ignorant of the Vedas, and Gayatri and Sandhya, and those who do not cast any oblation in the sacrificial fire and live by agriculture, are only Brahmanas in name.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Vyasa Samhita 4.33 “A gift should be made to an erudiate person living at a distance in preference to an illiterate on living close by one’s house. Nothing can be humiliating (insulting) to an illiterate Brahmana.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Usana Samhita 3.118 “An illiterate Brahmana, accepting funeral cakes, gold, kine, horses, lands and sesame seeds, gets consumed like a wood” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>Manu Smriti 2.157-8 “Like unto a wooden elephant or a leathern deer, a Brahmana, who has not studied, bears only the name of a Brahmana. As a eunuch is (sexually) fruitless (unsuccessful) in respect of a woman, as (sexually) fruitless is the meeting of two cows, as fruitless is the gift to an ignorant, so fruitless (is the life of a) Brahmana who has not studied the Riks (i.e., the Vedas).” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>Vyasa Samhita 4.37-38 “A Brahmana, who has not studied the Vedas, does, like a wooden elephant, or a leather-deer, but bear the name of the genus he belongs to. Like a deserted hamlet, like a waterless well, a Brahmana, who has not read the Vedas, is a Brahmana only in name.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>The above verses praises a learned Brahmin over an unlearned Brahmin just as it is mentioned in Manu,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 1.95-99 “Of the created things the animate creatures are the highest; of the animate creatures the intelligent ones are the highest, of the intelligent creatures men are the highest, and among men the Brahmanas are the highest. Among Brahmanas the erudite ones are the highest, among the erudite Brahmanas those, who think it their duty to perform the Sastric rites, are the highest, among the latter those, who perform such rites, are the highest, and among the performers of rites the knowers of Brahma are the highest. The Brahmana has originated as the eternal embodiment of virtue. His origin is for the furtherance of virtue; he becomes of the essence of Brahma. Born as a Brahmana, he wields the supremacy of the world, the ruler of all creatures, the custodian of the treasure of virtue.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 12.92. After giving up even the above-mentioned sacrificial rites, <span style="color: #ff0000;">a Brahmana should exert himself</span> in (acquiring) the knowledge of the Soul, in extinguishing his passions, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">and in studying the Veda</span>.</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>Apologists have one more explanation. They say if a Brahmin is of evil behavior or behaves like a Shudra then he becomes a Shudra. This is wrong because it is mentioned in Manu Smriti,</p>

<p>Manu Smriti 10.73 Having considered (the case of) a non-Aryan who acts like an Aryan, and (that of) an Aryan who acts like a non-Aryan, the creator declared, ‘Those two are neither equal nor unequal.’</p>

<p>Above is Rameshvar Bhatt’s Hindi translation. The meaning of this verse is simple, A Sudra by behaving like a Brahmin doesn’t become a Brahmin likewise a Brahmin by behaving like a Shudra doesn’t become a Shudra. This is based on Pundit Tulsiram’s interpretation and various other scholars are of the same view. I am reproducing Pundit Tulsiram’s translation with commentary of Manu Smriti 10.73,<br />

<p>It is mentioned in Mahabharata,</p>
<p>Mahabharata 13.151.20-23 “<span style="color: #ff0000;">Even the Brahmana that is destitute of knowledge is a god</span> and is a high instrument for cleansing others. He amongst them, then, that is possessed of knowledge is a much higher god and like unto the ocean when full (to the brim). <span style="color: #ff0000;">Learned or unlearned, Brahmana is always a high deity</span>. Sanctified or unsanctified (with the aid of Mantras), Fire is ever a great deity. A blazing fire even when it burns on a crematorium, is not regarded as tainted in consequence of the character of the spot whereon it burns. Clarified butter looks beautiful whether kept on the sacrificial altar or in a chamber. So, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">if a Brahmana be always engaged in evil acts, he is still to be regarded as deserving of honour</span>. Indeed, know that the Brahmana is always a high deity.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>There is another verse in Manu Smriti which refutes the claim of apologists.</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 10.96 A man of low caste who through covetousness lives by the occupations of a higher one, the king shall deprive of his property and banish.</p>
<p>If caste system is based on profession then why punish the low caste for living the occupation of higher one? Hindu text also says that in time of distress when one cannot make a living with the occupation of one’s caste can live by the occupation of other castes but it doesn’t say that by acquiring the profession of higher caste the Shudra becomes a Brahmin.</p>
<p>Moreover it is prohibited to change profession,</p>
<p>Vasistha Dharma Shastra 19.7-8 Let the king, paying attention to all the laws of countries, (subdivisions of) castes (gati) and families, make the four castes (varna) fulfil their (respective) particular duties. Let him punish those who stray from (the path of duty).</p>
<p>Atri Samhita 1.17 “The king, who punishes them who, renouncing their own religion, follow another’s, becomes glorified in the celestial region. By following his own religion even a Sudra enjoys the celestial region. Another’s religion should be renounced like the most beautiful wife of another person.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>And a Dvija can live by other professions also and that doesn’t change his caste,</p>
<p>Parasara Smriti 2.15 “Even an agriculturist Kshatriya should propitiate the gods and Brahmanas with the produce of his fields. A Vaisya, or a Sudra should always live by trade, agriculture, or handicraft.” Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Gautama Dharma Shastra 7.6-7 On failure of the (occupation lawful for a Brahmana) he may live by the occupations of a Kshatriya. On failure of those, he may live by the occupations of a Vaisya.</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 10.81-82 But a Brahmana, unable to subsist by his peculiar occupations just mentioned, may live according to the law applicable to Kshatriyas; for the latter is next to him in rank. If it be asked, ‘How shall it be, if he cannot maintain himself by either (of these occupations?’ the answer is), he may adopt a Vaisya’s mode of life, employing himself in agriculture and rearing cattle.</p>
<p>Agni Purana 258.80-83 “… A Shudra living like a Brahmana and performing religious rites exclusively belonging to the creed of the latter, should be liable to pay a fine of eighteen hundred Panas…” Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 7.11.16-17 allows a Brahmin to take Vaishya’s occupation but no where it says that by doing so the Brahmin will become a Vaishya. I don’t have to explain this as this verse speaks for itself. There is another such verse mentioned in Tulsi Ramayana,</p>
<p>Tusli Ramayana, Aranya Kanda, Doha 33.1 A Brahmana, even though he curse you, beat you or speak harsh words to you, is still worthy of adoration; so declare the saints. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">A Brahmana must be respected, through lacking in amiability and virtue; not a Sudra, though possessing a host of virtues and rich in knowledge</span>.</p>
<p>Krishna says in Gita that one should stick to the profession even if they are imperfect in it. Now you tell me if caste was based on profession then why it’s prohibited to change the profession? Have a look at what Krishna says,</p>
<p>Gita 18.41-48 “Of Brâhmanas and Kshatriyas and Vaishyas, as also of Sudras, O scorcher of foes, the duties are distributed according to the Gunas born of their own nature. The control of the mind and the senses, austerity, purity, forbearance, and also uprightness, knowledge, realisation, belief in a hereafter,—these are the duties of the Brâhmanas, born of (their own) nature. Prowess, boldness, fortitude, dexterity, and also not flying from battle, generosity and sovereignty are the duties of the Kshatriyas, born of (their own) nature. Agriculture, cattle-rearing and trade are the duties of the Vaishyas, born of (their own) nature; and action consisting of service is the duty of the Sudras, born of (their own) nature. Devoted each to his own duty, man attains the highest perfection. How engaged in his own duty, he attains perfection, that hear…<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Better is one’s own Dharma, (though) imperfect, than the Dharma of another well-performed. He who does the duty ordained by his own nature incurs no evil</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">One should not relinquish, O son of Kunti, the duty to which one is born, though it is attended with evil; for, all undertakings are enveloped by evil, as fire by smoke</span>.” Tr. Swami Swarupananda</p>
<p>Swami Prabhupada discourages ‘changing of castes’ and advises that a Shudra should remain a Shudra,</p>
<p>“Not that a śūdra man is by force become a brāhmaṇa. You cannot improve. That is not possible. But even if he remains a śūdra and does accordingly, he will get the same position as devotee. Sva-karmaṇā tam abhyarcya sam&#8230; [Bg. 18.46]. He&#8217;ll get the perfection. At the present moment the idea is: if one remains a śūdra, then he cannot get perfection. No. Even a śūdra can get perfection provided he does the work of a śūdra perfectly. Therefore why a śūdra artificially should be a brāhmaṇa? Let them, let him remain a śūdra, and if he follows strictly the rules and regulation of śūdra, he&#8217;ll also be as good as a brāhmaṇa. The same example: Just like head is as important as my leg. It is not that because it is leg, it is less important than my head. And if you ask the head, &#8220;Do the work of a leg,&#8221; it is impossible. And if you ask the leg to work as a brain, that is impossible. Let him remain brain, let him remain leg, and do your duty and you become perfect.” <strong>Room Conversation<br />

<p>It is mentioned in Manu Smriti,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 8.20-21 <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">”The</span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;"> Judicial officer of a king must be a Brahmana even if he be a mere Brahmana by birth</span><span style="color: #ff0000;"> (and bereft of the virtues of his order), </span>or a mere professional adjudicator of issues, and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not a Sudra under any circumstances whatsoever</span>.” Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>If the Shudra is competent enough, possess all knowledge then why a ignorant Brahmin is still considered superior than him just because of his birth as a Brahmin? Padma Purana VII.23.29 says that king named Nityodaya was a Shudra by caste but being a King didn’t change his caste. Caste system is not based on education, it’s based on birth. Normally a father would give best education to his child but Hindu text says that a son born to Dvija is still not Dvija if the mother belongs to low caste,</p>
<p>Mahabharata 13.47.17 “The son born of the Sudra wife should not be regarded as invested with the status of a Brahmana in consequence of his being unskilled (in the scriptures and the duties ordained for the Brahmana). Only those children that are born of wives belonging to the three higher orders should be regarded as invested with the status of Brahmanas.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>Apologists misinterpret Hindu text to show that some personalities attained higher castes. It’s true that one attains higher caste in the next life but in no way can one attain higher caste in the same life. As per Hindu text it is only in next birth that a man attains higher caste or is degraded to lower caste.</p>
<p>Apastamba Dharma Sutra 2.5.11.10-11 In successive births men of the lower castes are born in the next higher one, if they have fulfilled their duties. In successive births men of the higher castes are born in the next lower one, if they neglect their duties.</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 10.42. By the power of austerities and of the seed (from which they sprang), <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">these (races) obtain here among men more exalted or lower rank in successive births</span>.</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 9.334-5 <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">But to serve Brahmanas (who are) learned in the Vedas</span>, householders, and famous (for virtue) is the highest duty of a Sudra, which leads to beatitude. (A Sudra who is) pure, the servant of his betters, gentle in his speech, and free from pride, and always seeks a refuge with Brahmanas, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">attains (in his next life) a higher caste</span></p>
<p>Mahabharata, Anusasana Parva, 13.28 “…If born as human being, he is sure to take birth as a Pukkasa or a Chandala. Verily, one having taken birth in that sinful order of existence, viz., Pukkasa, one, O Matanga, has to wander in it for a very long time. Passing a period of one thousand years in that order, one attains next to the status of a Sudra. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">In the Sudra order, again, one has to wander for a long time. After thirty thousand years one acquire the status of a Vaisya</span>. There, in that order, one has to pass a very long period. After a time that is sixty times longer than what has been stated as the period of Sudra existence, one becomes a person of the fighting order. In the Kshatriya order one has to pass a very long time. After a time that is measured by multiplying the period last referred to by sixty, one becomes born as a fallen Brahmana. In this order one has to wander for a long period. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">After a time measured by multiplying the period last named by two hundred, one becomes born in the race of such a Brahmana</span> as lives by the profession of arms. There, in that order, one has to wander for a long period. After a time measured by multiplying the period last named by three hundred, <span style="color: #ff0000;">one takes birth in the race of a Brahmana that is given to the recitation of the Gayatri and other sacred Mantras</span>. There, in that order, one has to wander for a long period. After a time measured by multiplying the period last named by four hundred, one takes birth in the race of such a Brahmana as is conversant with the entire Vedas and the scriptures…” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>So no matter what you do, you should perform duties prescribed for your castes and only after few thousand years you can attain higher caste.</p>
<p>Some examples:-</p>
<p>Skanda Purana V.ii.22 A Kshatriya king was a Shudra named Somaka in one of his previous birth.</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 1.13.15 Yama was cursed by Sage Manduka and was born as a Shudra</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 7.15.72-73 Sage Narada was cursed to become Shudra from the womb of a maidservant and after his birth by serving the Brahmins he took birth as a Brahmana.</p>
<p>Shiva Purana, Kotirudra Samhita 4.9.3 A Brahmin lady named Saumini had become an outcaste in her next birth.</p>
<p>Mahabharata 13.10 In consequence of the merit he acquired by those practices, the Sudra in the next life, took birth in the family of a great king, and in course of time became possessed of great splendour</p>
<p>Prabhupada writes on SB 4.30.48 ” In this connection the word mahad-avajñānāt is significant. King Dakṣa was the son of Lord Brahmā; therefore in a previous birth he was a brāhmaṇa.<br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">But because of his behaving like a non-</span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">brāhmaṇa</span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;"> (</span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">abrāhmaṇa</span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">) by insulting or disrespecting </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">Lord Mahādeva, he had to take birth within the semen of a </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">kṣatriya</span> — that is to say, he became the son of the Pracetās.”</p>
<p>A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada on Bhagvad Purana 4.30.48 <a href="http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_4.30.48" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_4.30.48<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>As you can read, all these people attained higher or were degraded to lower caste only in their next birth. As it is mentioned in the Hindu law book Apastamba 2.5.11.10-11 that only in successive births men take higher caste or are degraded to low caste. And why should god assign this? Is Hindu god a job recruiter who commands that people born in specific caste must perform specific job. Dr. B.R. Ambedkar was born in a Dalit family but due to his hard work he became the first Minister of Law and Justice and was also the chairman of Constitution drafting committee. It’s not like if a person is born in family of specific should continue to do his family business, people have varied interests. Wasn’t Hindu god aware of this fact? This is my reply to the apologists.</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; height: 1em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></span></p>
<p>Caste system is an integral part of Hinduism, you cannot be a Hindu and reject caste system. Caste system is an evil which Hinduism has produced and upheld in India. Message of god is eternal it cannot be outdated like Hinduism. It is no different than the racial discrimination fought by Nelson Mandela. Such evil thing surely cannot be from god.</p>
