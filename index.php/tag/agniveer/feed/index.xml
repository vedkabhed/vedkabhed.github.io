										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Written by Abdul Fatir</p>
<p><span style="color:#741b47;font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><strong>Dr. Zakir Naik :</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;font-family:Arial;font-size:12pt;"><em><strong>I. ASTRONOMY</strong><br />
<strong>CREATION OF THE UNIVERSE: &#8216;THE BIG BANG&#8217;</strong></em><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;font-family:Arial;font-size:12pt;"><em>The creation of the universe is explained by astrophysicists in a widely accepted phenomenon, popularly known as the &#8216;Big Bang&#8217;. It is supported by observational and experimental data gathered by astronomers and astrophysicists for decades. According to the &#8216;Big Bang&#8217;, the whole universe was initially one big mass (Primary Nebula). Then there was a &#8216;Big Bang&#8217; (Secondary Separation) which resulted in the formation of Galaxies. These then divided to form stars, planets, the sun, the moon, etc. The origin of the universe was unique and the probability of it occurring by &#8216;chance&#8217; is zero. The Qur&#8217;aan contains the following verse, regarding the origin of the universe: <span style="text-decoration:underline;">&#8220;<strong>Do not the Unbelievers see That the heavens and the earth Were joined together (as one Unit of Creation), before We clove them asunder?</strong>&#8221; [Al-Qur&#8217;aan 21:30]</span></em><br />
</span></p>
<p><span id="more-626"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:red;"><strong>Agniveer :</strong></span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;font-family:Arial;font-size:12pt;">Very poor evidence indeed! And that too factually incorrect!<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;font-family:Arial;font-size:12pt;">Dr. Naik has let his imagination loose in correlating big bang with this verse (21:30) of the Quran. Let&#8217;s analyze this verse closely.<br />
</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color:#333333;font-family:Arial;font-size:12pt;">It starts with &#8220;<strong>do not the unbelievers SEE</strong>&#8221; – This can mean two things- a) that the phenomenon being talked about can be actually seen AND/OR b) that the phenomenon being talked about here is already KNOWN to the people who it is being addressed to (unbelievers in this case). <strong>Look at it any which way, it only proves that the phenomenon was already known (and possibly verifiable) to the addressees in advance</strong>. So <strong>there&#8217;s no new knowledge that is being revealed here</strong>. I don&#8217;t know why Dr. Naik chose such a self-defeating verse in the first place.<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:#93c47d;font-family:Arial;">My Response :</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:blue;">The first thing is that the Noble Qur&#8217;an is a revelation to the whole of humanity till the day of resurrection. The Noble Qur&#8217;an says :</span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:#274e13;"><span style="font-family:Arial;">It (Qur&#8217;an) is but a <span style="color:#6aa84f;background-color:white;text-decoration:underline;"><strong>reminder to the worlds.</strong></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;background-color:white;text-decoration:underline;"><strong> </strong></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://quran.com/38/87" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right"><span style="color:blue;font-family:Arial;font-size:12pt;text-decoration:underline;"><em>-Surah Sad (38:87)</em></span><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:blue;font-family:Arial;">This means that it is not must to interpret such verses in Qur&#8217;an according to the ignorant arabs 1400 years ago. This verse is actually addressed to the scientific people who now know about The Creation of Universe and still call it a <span style="text-decoration:underline;">&#8216;chance&#8217;</span> and <span style="text-decoration:underline;">reject the belief in Allah.</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:blue;font-family:Arial;">The verse does not mean to actually see but it means to know about The Big Bang. The verse is actually asking a question to today&#8217;s atheists : </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#6aa84f;font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:Arial;"><span style="background-color:white;"><em><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Then will they not believe?</strong></span><br />
</em></span><span style="color:blue;">by presenting such scientific info 1400 years ago. So, Mr. Agniveer&#8217;s understanding lacks here.</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:red;font-family:Arial;">Agniveer :</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:#333333;font-family:Arial;">Then the verse says &#8220;that the heavens and earth were joined together, before We clove them asunder?&#8221; – This rustic imagination has nothing to do with the big bang. <strong>The earth was formed billions of years after the big bang</strong>!! And most importantly, <strong>earth</strong> was not parted from the universe, it <strong>is, was and will remain a part</strong> of the Universe!</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:#6aa84f;font-family:Arial;">My Response :</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:blue;font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:Arial;">The phrase <span style="color:purple;"><em>Samawa&#8217;ti wal-ard </em><span style="color:blue;">meaning <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Heaven(s) and Earth</em></span> refers to<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong> the universe in totality</strong></span>. </span></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:blue;font-family:Arial;font-size:12pt;">The Big Bang model states that all matter was initally condensed to a point of Infinite Density and Zero Volume (Nothingness) and everything separated to form galaxies , stars , planets and other objects of space.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">(Source: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right"><span style="color:#3b5998;">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang</span><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>)</span><span style="color:blue;font-family:Arial;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:blue;font-family:Arial;font-size:12pt;">Noble Qur&#8217;an in the above verse says that the heavens<span style="color:#e06666;"><em> ( Arabic : <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Sama</span> : Meaning : Space excluding Earth  )<span style="color:red;"> </span></em><span style="color:blue;"> and the earth <span style="color:#e06666;"><em>( Arabic : <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Ard</span>  )</em><span style="color:blue;"> were a joint entity<span style="color:#e06666;"> ( Arabic : <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">ratq</span> : </em>Meaning : <em>blended , stitched , joint etc. )</em><span style="color:blue;"> and God separated them <span style="color:#e06666;">( Arabic :<em> <span style="text-decoration:underline;">fataqa</span> :</em> Meaning : <em>that something comes about by tearing apart or destroying the structure of <span style="text-decoration:underline;">ratq</span> )<span style="color:red;">.</span></em></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-1218" src="http://vedkabhed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1.jpg" alt="" width="514" height="238" /></p>
<p><span style="color:blue;font-family:Arial;font-size:12pt;">The Qur&#8217;an clearly states more than 1400 years ago exactly what has been proved less than 50 years ago that all universe ( Heavens and Earth ) was blended ( <em>ratq</em> ) into a single piece of Infinite Density and Allah separated it (<em>fataqa ) </em>which led to the formation of all celestial bodies.</span></p>

<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>does not say that the earth was formed as it is in present state at the same time</strong></span></span> (Big Bang) it says that the <em>Heavens and Earth </em>(Universe in totality , all celestial matter) was initially in a point (ratq) and then it separated and the matter that separated (later formed the Earth and other celestial objects)<span style="background-color:white;">.<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong> All the heavenly bodies (earth,stars,planets etc.) were formed from the same mass that expanded.</strong></span></span> (<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>This is what is meant by heavens and earth joint together</strong></span>) as Shabbir Ahmad explains in his translation of the Noble Verse :<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:#6aa84f;font-family:Arial;">Are not the disbelievers willing to consider that the heavens and the earth used to be one solid mass that We exploded into parting (79:30) and We made out of water every living thing? (24:45). Will they not then (some day) believe? (<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Numerous celestial bodies came into being and started swimming along in their orbits</span> (21:33), (36:40)).</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><br />
</span><span style="color:blue;font-family:Arial;text-decoration:underline;"><em>-Surah Anbiya (21:30)</em></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><br />
</span><span style="color:#6aa84f;font-family:Arial;"><br />
</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:blue;font-family:Arial;font-size:12pt;">Notice the importance of the word blend/stitch (ratq) here which refers to a point of enormous density.<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:blue;font-family:Arial;font-size:12pt;">The Qur&#8217;an refers to the gaseous celestial matter before the creation of heavenly bodies  perfectly as <span style="color:purple;"><em>dukhan.<a href="http://www.blogger.com/goog_24568309" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="color:blue;text-decoration:underline;"><br />

</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:blue;background-color:white;text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Nowhere does the Noble Qur&#8217;an say that the earth was thrown out of the universe. </strong></span><br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:red;font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt;text-decoration:underline;"><strong>EXPANSION OF THE UNIVERSE</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:8pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:blue;">It has been proved now by celestial observations that the galaxies are drifting away and the universe in expanding.</span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:blue;">Stephen Hawking says :</span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:#c27ba0;"><strong> <span style="background-color:white;text-decoration:underline;">The expansion of the universe was one of the most important intellectual discoveries of the 20th century, or of any century.</span></strong></span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:blue;font-family:Arial;"> Allah says in The Glorious Qur&#8217;an :</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><br />
</span><span style="color:blue;font-family:Arial;"><br />
</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:#6aa84f;font-family:Arial;background-color:white;text-decoration:underline;">And the heaven We constructed with strength, and indeed, <strong>We are [its] expander.</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><br />
</span><span style="color:blue;font-family:Arial;background-color:white;text-decoration:underline;"><em>-Surah Dhariyat (51:47)</em></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:#f1c232;font-family:Arial;background-color:white;">The above verse clearly states that <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong><em>the Universe is being expanded by Allah.</em></strong></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:red;font-family:Arial;">Agniveer :</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:#333333;font-family:Arial;">Another important thing to note is how conveniently (read unscientifically) Dr. Naik assumes the word &#8216;heaven&#8217; in the verse to mean &#8216;universe&#8217;. Unfortunately, despite this innovation, the verse turned out to be a scientific disaster and a non-revelation.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:#38761d;">My Response :</span><br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:blue;font-family:Arial;font-size:12pt;">The Arabic word used in the verse is <span style="color:purple;"><em>Sama </em><span style="color:blue;">which means heaven(s), sky, firmament etc. and <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Where did Dr. Zakir say that here only the word Heaven means Universe ?</strong></span>. Heaven(s) refers to all the celestial objects except earth and the phrase <span style="color:#274e13;"><em>Heavens and Earth </em><span style="color:blue;">when it occurs in The Noble Qur&#8217;an refers to the universe in totality.</span><br />
<span style="color:blue;text-decoration:underline;">A word can have a number of meaning in a language and disagreeing with it shows the ignorance of Agniveer.</span><br />
</span></span></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:red;">Agniveer :</span><br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:#333333;">By the way, the Quranic heaven is a 7 storied building/canopy over the earth. Interestingly, not only the Quranic heaven but the Quranic earth has seven layers too (Quran 65:12 [Yusuf Ali] <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>&#8220;Allah is He Who created seven Firmaments and of the earth a similar number</strong>.&#8221;</span><br />
(We would not be surprised if Dr. Naik comes up with some multiverse argument to explain the 7 universes, but what will he do about the 7 earths therein?)</span><br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:#38761d;font-family:Arial;">My Response :</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:blue;font-family:Arial;">The Noble Qur&#8217;an  states :</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:#6aa84f;font-family:Arial;background-color:white;">And We made the sky <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>a protected ceiling</strong></span>, but they, from its signs, are turning away.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"> <a href="http://quran.com/21/32" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right"><span style="color:blue;text-decoration:underline;"><em>&#8211;</em></span><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></span><span style="font-family:Arial;text-decoration:underline;"><em>Surah Anbiya (21:32)</em></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:blue;font-family:Arial;">The important thing is the word protected in the above verse and by protection it <span style="background-color:white;text-decoration:underline;"><strong>means the protection of earth by ozone layer.</strong></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:blue;font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:Arial;">The Arabic word translated and heaven is [<a href="http://quran.com/65/12" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">65:12</span><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>] is <span style="color:purple;"><em>Saba&#8217;a </em><span style="color:blue;">which means <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Seven or Many</strong></span>. So it could also mean many and indicate the multiverses but since multiverses are not an established fact I would not comment more on it.</span></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:blue;font-family:Arial;">Today science tells us that the universe is composed 20 % of ordinary matter and remaining 80 % of Dark Matter about which almost nothing is known. ( <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Source</span><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> )</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-IjmXjwrRZVw/TY3GgPksNOI/AAAAAAAAARw/dR83n1EeUrc/s1600/080998_Universe_Content_240.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img decoding="async" src="http://theindianmuslim.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/070515_1420_4.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:blue;font-family:Arial;">So , the remaining heavens could also mean the celestial matter called Dark Matter because The Noble Qur&#8217;an states :</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:#6aa84f;"><span style="font-family:Arial;">&#8220;And We have certainly beautified the nearest heaven with stars&#8230;.&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"> </span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://quran.com/67/5" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right"><span style="color:blue;font-family:Arial;font-size:12pt;text-decoration:underline;"><em>-Surah Mulk (67:5)</em></span><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:blue;font-family:Arial;">Regarding<span style="background-color:white;text-decoration:underline;"><strong> the Seven ( or many ) earths in Qur&#8217;an it is a miracle of The Noble Qur&#8217;an which will Insha&#8217;Allah be fulfilled in the near future because there is great possibility of other earth like planets</strong></span> and aliens on them according to science which could be many in number.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><br />
</span><span style="color:blue;font-family:Arial;">Agniveer&#8217;s , objection on many (or seven) earths shows their lack of scientific knowledge.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:red;font-family:Verdana;text-decoration:underline;"><strong>The seven heavens and seven earths is actually a miracle of The Noble Qur&#8217;an.</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:red;font-family:Arial;">Agniveer :</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:#333333;font-family:Arial;">So, after having analyzed the evidence (verse 21:30) we find that Quranic model of universe is very much against established scientific facts but it&#8217;s in perfect sync with Judaic, Greek view of its time. The author of Quran insists that the heavens can be <strong>seen</strong> by the unbelievers (or are already known to them).</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:#6aa84f;font-family:Arial;">My Response :</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:blue;font-family:Arial;font-size:12pt;">Claims already refuted above.<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:red;font-family:Arial;">Agniveer :</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:#333333;font-family:Arial;">To be doubly sure that the &#8216;heaven&#8217; of Quran is <strong>NOT</strong> the &#8216;universe&#8217;, we look at another verse which unambiguously states that the earth was created first and <strong>thereafter</strong> the heavens (<strong>Universe</strong> as per Dr. Naik) were created.<br />
Quran 2:29  &#8220;He it is Who created for you all that is on earth. <strong><em>Then He </em></strong>Istawâ (<strong><em>rose over</em></strong>) <strong><em>towards </em></strong>the<strong><em>heaven </em></strong>and made them <strong><em>seven heavens </em></strong>and He is the All-Knower of everything.&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:#6aa84f;font-family:Arial;">My Response :</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><br />
</span><span style="color:blue;"><span style="font-family:Arial;">The word used in above verse is <span style="color:purple;"><em>Summa </em><span style="color:blue;">which also means Then, Moreover , Besides , Simultaneously , Subsequently etc.</span></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><br />
</span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-RiUXK7K_Euc/TY3LlmerPjI/AAAAAAAAAR0/7YjUksfygHU/s1600/summa.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img decoding="async" src="http://theindianmuslim.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/070515_1420_5.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:blue;font-family:Arial;">So, if we translate it as besides or simultaneously then it is clear that the <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Heavens and Earth</span><br />
</em>were created at the same time which is in accordance with The Big Bang theory.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><br />
</span><span style="color:blue;font-family:Arial;"><br />
</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><br />
</span><span style="color:blue;font-family:Arial;">Moreover , The Noble Qur&#8217;an does not give a sequence for the creation of <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Heavens and Earth</span><br />
</em>which is indicated by the fact the sometimes Allah uses the word <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Heaven(s) before Earth</em></span> while in other verse <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Earth before Heaven.</em></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:#274e13;"><span style="font-family:Arial;">Indeed, your Lord is Allah , who created the heavens and earth in six <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">days</span> <span style="color:#cc0000;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">periods</span><span style="color:#274e13;">  and then established Himself above the Throne.</span></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"> </span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://quran.com/7/54" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right"><span style="color:blue;font-family:Arial;font-size:12pt;text-decoration:underline;"><em>-Surah A&#8217;raaf (7:54)</em></span><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"> </span><span style="color:blue;"><span style="font-family:Arial;">In the above verse Allah mentions <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Heavens before Earth</em></span> . In fact the only verse in which Allah actually mentioned the different events in creation is in <span style="color:#e69138;">Surah Nazi&#8217;at (79:27-30).</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><br />
</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:#274e13;"><span style="font-family:Arial;">Are you a more difficult creation or is the heaven? Allah constructed it.He raised its height, and He has equally ordered it, Its night He covers with darkness, and its forenoon He brings out (with light).And after that He <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">spread the earth</span> <span style="color:#cc0000;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">made the earth egg-shaped (like ostrich&#8217;s egg, round etc.)</span>.</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"> </span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://quran.com/79/27-30" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right"><span style="color:blue;font-family:Arial;font-size:12pt;text-decoration:underline;"><em>-Surah Nazi&#8217;at (79:27-30)</em></span><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"> </span><span style="color:blue;font-family:Arial;">It is clear from The Noble Qur&#8217;an that the <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Heavens and Earth</em></span> were created simultaneously by The Big Bang.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><br />
</span></span><span style="color:blue;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"><strong><br />
</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

<p><span style="color:#333333;font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:Arial;"><strong><br />
</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><br />
</span><span style="font-family:Arial;">Now going by Dr. Naik&#8217;s terminology ,you get from this verse:</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color:#333333;font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:Arial;"><em>a universe that was created after the earth was created !! (Allah had to rise over earth to reach the Universe…Enjoy the science!)</em></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><br />
</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color:#333333;font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:Arial;"><em>a universe that was smoke while the earth was solid!!!</em></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><br />
</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color:#333333;font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:Arial;"><em>a universe that was fragmented into 7 layers!!!</em></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><br />
</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color:#333333;font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:Arial;"><em>What a disaster!</em></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:#741b47;font-family:Arial;">Dr. Zakir Naik :</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:12pt;"><em>The striking congruence between the Qur&#8217;aanic verse and the &#8216;Big Bang&#8217; is inescapable! How could a book, which first appeared in the deserts of Arabia 1400 years ago, contain this profound scientific truth?<br />
</em></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:red;font-family:Arial;">Agniveer :</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:Arial;">Rather, these verses only corroborate that the author of the Quran was only reiterating what the Arabs of 7th century believed in: 7 layers of flat disc earth and 7 layers of solid canopies of heaven on top. All borrowed from Greek, Talmud myths and reproduced by the author of the Quran.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:Arial;">As if all this was not bad enough, Dr. Naik dishonestly translates the word &#8216;heaven&#8217; as &#8216;universe&#8217;…and despite that, his evidence not only falls short but goes anti the big-bang theory. We hope, being a modern rational man, he would do a &#8216;baba pilot&#8217; with the Quran as well after reading this article.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><br />

<p><span style="color:blue;font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:Arial;">All foolish claims refuted above. <span style="color:#990000;"><em>The Smoke objection and flat earth claim will be refuted later.</em></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><br />

<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong><em>My Response :</em></strong></span></p>
<p>There is no such thing as a &#8216;Modern Qur&#8217;an&#8217; , Qur&#8217;an is the same as was recited by The Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) 1400 years ago and was transferred to generations by recitation and memorization. We will provide dictionary references  for all our translations.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong><em>Agniveer :</em></strong></span></p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p>Modern Quran is supposed to be a perfect book, devoid of any errors. We have already analyzed in detail why this supposition is a great joke. In this brief article, we shall survey certain points where Quran contradicts itself.</p>
<p>The reasons for the contradictions are obvious:<br />
a. Quran was not supposed to be downloaded in the brain of Muhammad in one go. On contrary, as per the needs of the situations, Gabriel would come and Muhammad would have an epileptic fit, and Ayats would be revealed.</p>
<p>b. In any case, entire Quran is hearsay compiled by Muhammad&#8217;s followers much after his death. Now these followers were killing each other and even murdered the first compiler of Quran.</p>
<p>c. Most Ayats were revealed in the bed of Aisha. And Aisha was enemy of most beloved follower of Muhammad – Ali.</p>
<p>When fanatics like Zakir Nayak are caught with such contradictions, they run away saying, &#8220;Allah knows the best!&#8221;.</p>
<p>The current article is for the more rational ones though! You will see how Muslim fanatics would quote one stand to showcase Islam as noble, kind and gentle, and conveniently ignore the contradictions.</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong><em>My Response :</em></strong></span></p>
<p>Yes, The Noble Qur&#8217;an is a perfect book and I challenge you to give one error in the Noble Qur&#8217;an.</p>
<p>a) Yes , Gabriel (pbuh) recited the Qur&#8217;anic Verses to the Prophet. Muhammad (pbuh) had epilepsy , That&#8217;s a lie !!</p>
<p>b) Qur&#8217;an was continuously memorized by the companions of the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) and was written down.</p>

<p>c) Again that&#8217;s a lie.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s see what &#8220;contradictions&#8221; you bring up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong><em>Agniveer :</em></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>1. Good and Evil deeds</strong></span><br />
<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Stand: </span>Good and evil deeds are not equal. Reply to bad deeds done on you with good deeds. (Surah Hamim 34)</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Contradiction:</span></p>
<p>Take revenge of death for death – kill a free man in revenge of free, slave in revenge or slave and woman in revenge of woman! (Surah Bakar 178)</p>
<p>Allah is enemy of those who are enemy of Rasul and angels (Surah Raku 98)</p>
<p>I have created enmity and jealousy among them till doomsday (Surah Mayda 64)</p>
<p>Allah does not advise Kafirs (Bakar 264)</p>
<p>Be as hard with them as they were with you (Nahal 126)</p>
<p>Muslims, Fight the Kafirs around you so that they understand what hardness is (Tauba 123)</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong><em>My Response :</em></strong></span></p>
<p>And not equal are the good deed and the bad. Repel [evil] by that [deed] which is better; and thereupon the one whom between you and him is enmity [will become] as though he was a devoted friend.</p>
<p>-Surah Fussilat (41:34)</p>
<p>This means responding to bad against you with good deeds at a personal level but this does not mean that we become impotent and leave Justice aside. Now let us expose the misquotes of Mr. agniveer :<br />
<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>O you who have believed, prescribed for you is legal retribution for those murdered – the free for the free, the slave for the slave, and the female for the female. But whoever overlooks from his brother anything, then there should be a suitable follow-up and payment to him with good conduct.</strong></span> This is an alleviation from your Lord and a mercy. But whoever transgresses after that will have a painful punishment.</p>
<p>-Surah Baqarah (2:178)</p>
<p>This verse prescribes a judgment for those who are murdered , it is a law and not at a personal level.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Whoever is an enemy to Allah and His angels and His messengers and Gabriel and Michael </strong></span>&#8211; then indeed, Allah is an enemy to the disbelievers.</p>
<p>-Surah Baqarah (2:98)</p>
<p>This verse tells that whoever disbelieves deliberately and becomes an enemy of Allah and his angels and messengers then Allah too is like an enemy to such people.</p>
<p>And the Jews say, &#8220;The hand of Allah is chained.&#8221;<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong> Chained are their hands, and cursed are they for what they say.</strong></span> Rather, both His hands are extended; He spends however He wills. And that which has been revealed to you from your Lord will surely increase many of them in transgression and disbelief. <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>And We have cast among them animosity and hatred until the Day of Resurrection. Every time they kindled the fire of war [against you],</strong></span> Allah extinguished it. And they strive throughout the land [causing] corruption, and Allah does not like corrupters.</p>
<p>-Surah Maidah (5:64)</p>
<p>Allah does not cause animosity uselessly , it was a punishment for their continuous disbelief and abuses against Allah and waging war against the messenger of Allah.</p>
<p>O you who have believed, d<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>o not invalidate your charities with reminders or injury as does one who spends his wealth [only] to be seen by the people</strong></span> and does not believe in Allah and the Last Day. His example is like that of a [large] <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>smooth stone upon which is dust and is hit by a downpour that leaves it bare.</strong></span> They are unable [to keep] anything of what they have earned.<strong> And Allah does not guide the disbelieving people.</strong></p>
<p>-Surah Baqarah (2:264)</p>
<p>The verse clearly states that people who do good deeds only to show off are disbelievers. Disbeliever means who knows the truth and intentionally rejects it. So Allah does not guide such stubborn people.</p>
<p>And if you punish [an enemy, O believers], punish with an equivalent of that with which you were harmed. <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>But if you are patient – it is better for those who are patient.</strong></span></p>
<p>-Surah Nahl (16:126)</p>
<p>The verse means that if the enemies fight and wage war against you and afflict you with problems then we too have to fight against them but if you be patient it is better.</p>
<p>O you who have believed,<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong> fight those adjacent to you</strong></span> of the disbelievers and let them find in you harshness. And know that Allah is with the righteous.</p>
<p>-Surah Tawbah (9:123)</p>
<p>This verse talks about the fight going on in the battlefield. No army general will say <strong>&#8220;Don&#8217;t fight them , Run away !&#8221;</strong><br />
<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong><em>Agniveer :</em></strong></span></p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>2. Allah knows everything</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Stand: </span>He is beginning and He is end. He is evident and He is hidden. He knows everything. (Hadid 3)<br />
Whatever is there is skies and earth is known by Allah<strong><br />
<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>(Mayda 13)</em></span></strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Contradiction:</span></p>
<p>That day Allah will ask Hell if she has been filled and she shall answer that there is still some space left! (Kaaf 29)</p>
<p>He asked Earth and Sky whether they came with happiness or out of compulsion. Both said that they came with happiness. (Sajdah 11)</p>
<p><em>Why does Allah need to ask questions when he already knows the correct answer as well as the answer that the examinees would give? Or does he enjoy drama and nautanki? But then why is drama Haram in Islam then? Or may be He cannot tolerate anyone else doing drama except he himself!</em></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong><em>My Response :</em></strong></span></p>
<p>He is the First and the Last, the Ascendant and the Intimate, and He is, of all things, Knowing.</p>
<p>-Surah Hadid (57:3)</p>
<p>That is so you may know that Allah knows what is in the heavens and what is in the earth and that Allah is Knowing of all things.</p>
<p><span style="background-color:white;">-Surah Al-Maidah (5:97) </span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Wrong reference provided above its not [5:13] its [5:97].</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Regarding the verse where Allah will ask the Hell if it is filled its Surah Qaf Verse 30 not 29.</span></p>
<p>Allah is all-Knowing but he asks certain questions from his creation as is evident in the following verse of the Noble Qur&#8217;an :</p>
<p>And [beware the Day] when Allah will say, &#8220;O Jesus, Son of Mary, did you say to the people, &#8216;Take me and my mother as deities besides Allah ?'&#8221; He will say, &#8220;Exalted are You! It was not for me to say that to which I have no right. <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>If I had said it, You would have known it. You know what is within myself, and I do not know what is within Yourself. Indeed, it is You who is Knower of the unseen.</strong></span></p>
<p>-Surah Maidah (5:116)</p>
<p>Also by the following Hadith and many others :</p>
<p>Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p>Allah &#8216;s Apostle said, &#8220;Allah has some angels who look for those who celebrate the Praises of Allah on the roads and paths. And when they find some people celebrating the Praises of Allah, they call each other, saying, &#8220;Come to the object of your pursuit.&#8217; &#8221; He added, &#8220;Then the angels encircle them with their wings up to the sky of the world.&#8221; He added. &#8220;(after those people celebrated the Praises of Allah, and the angels go back), <span style="text-decoration:underline;">their Lord, asks them (those angels)</span>—-<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>though He knows better than them</strong></span>—-&#8216;<span style="text-decoration:underline;">What do My slaves say?</span>&#8216; The angels reply, &#8216;They say: Subhan Allah, Allahu Akbar, and Alham-du-lillah, Allah then says &#8216;Did they see Me?&#8217; The angels reply, &#8216;No! By Allah, they didn&#8217;t see You.&#8217;……..</p>
<p>-Bukhari :: Book 8 :: Volume 75 :: Hadith 417</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Regarding the verse where Allah asks the universe (i.e. Heaven) to come into being its Surah Fussilat Verse 11 not Surah Sajdah.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">And I don&#8217;t know what Mr. Agniveer wants to argue on that verse , Let me just explain the verse :</span></p>
<p>Then He directed Himself to the heaven while it was smoke and said to it and to the earth, &#8220;<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Come [into being]</strong></span>, willingly or by compulsion.&#8221; They said, &#8220;We have come willingly.&#8221;</p>
<p>-Surah Fussilat (41:11)</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Here Allah commands the heaven to come into being i.e. the creation of celestial bodies because before that heaven was in form of smoke , I doubt if Mr. Agniveer has understood the verse.</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong><em>Agniveer :</em></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>3. Relations in Paradise</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Stand: </span>When doomsday shall come, there shall remain no more relations and they shall not talk to each other.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Contradiction:</span></p>
<p>In Paradise, they shall go along with their wives and good children. (Raad 23)</p>
<p><em>Obviously it means that relations shall continue in Paradise. Hence Quran contradicts itself.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong><em>My Response :</em></strong></span></p>
<p>First of all there is no reference for your &#8220;Stand&#8221;. Perhaps you are talking about these verses of the Noble Qur&#8217;an :</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>On the Day</strong></span> a man will flee from his brother And from his mother and his father,And from his wife and his children.Each one of them, that Day, will have enough concern (of his own) to make him indifferent to the others.</p>
<p>-Surah Abasa (80:34-37)</p>
<p>You can clearly see the deception by Mr.Agniveer , the above verses are about <strong>The Day of Judgment </strong>meaning that on that day everyone will forget all relations and think about himself. And Surah Ra&#8217;d (13:23) says :</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Gardens (Paradise) of perpetual residence</strong></span>; they will enter them with whoever were righteous among their fathers, their spouses and their descendants. And the angels will enter upon them from every gate, [saying],</p>
<p>-Surah Ra&#8217;d (13:23)</p>
<p>This verse is talking about Paradise , I think Mr. Agniveer needs to learn Islam from basics to know the difference between Day Of Judgment and Paradise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong><em>Agniveer :</em></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>4. Master of destiny</strong><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Stand: </span>Allah is all-forgiving. If He wanted, He could have immediately punished them. But no one can move even a bit from His decision. (Kahf 48)</p>
<p>All promises of Allah are already written (Raad 38)</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Contradiction:<br />
</span></p>
<p>Whosoever wants rewards now, I give him immediately. Whosoever wants on doomsday, I give him then. And those who doubt, I shall take revenge from them soon. (Imran 145)</p>
<p>So people have a choice on when they want the rewards. This contradicts the original stand that Allah has already decided.</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong><em>My Response :</em></strong></span></p>
<p>Surah Kahf verse 48 reads :</p>
<p>And they will be presented before your Lord in rows, [and He will say], &#8220;You have certainly come to Us just as We created you the first time. But you claimed that We would never make for you an appointment.&#8221;</p>
<p>-Surah Kahf (18:48)</p>
<p>So we would like Mr. Agniveer to give the correct reference from where he is quoting ?</p>
<p>Surah Ra&#8217;d Verse 38 reads :</p>
<p>And We have already sent messengers before you and assigned to them wives and descendants. And it was not for a messenger to come with a sign except by permission of Allah . <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>For every term is a book (revealed)</strong></span>.</p>
<p>-Surah Ra&#8217;d (13:38)<br />
The verse tells that there were revelations in every age before The Noble Qur&#8217;an , Again we would like Mr. Agniveer to give the correct reference.</p>
<p>So there is no point of contradiction but still for Mr. Agniveer&#8217;s understanding let me explain Surah Ale-Imran Verse 145 :</p>
<p>And it is not [possible] for one to die except by permission of Allah at a decree determined. And whoever desires the reward of this world – We will give him thereof; and whoever desires the reward of the Hereafter – We will give him thereof. And we will reward the grateful.</p>
<p>-Surah Ale-Imran (3:145)</p>
<p>It means that whoever desires the worldly rewards will be given here but in the hereafter he will be among the losers but whoever desires reward of the hereafter will be given on the Day of Judgment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong><em>Agniveer :</em></strong></span></p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>5. Allah and Mischief</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Stand:</span>Allah does not want mischief (Bakar 205)</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Contradiction:</span></p>
<p>Allah said that He created big criminals in each habitation so that they keep doing mischief. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">(Anaam 123)</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong><em>My Response :</em></strong></span></p>
<p>Allah does not like mischief as evident in verse 205 of Surah Baqarah.</p>
<p>Surah Anaam verse 123 reads :</p>
<p>And thus We have placed within every city the greatest of its criminals to conspire therein. But they conspire not except against themselves, and they perceive [it] not.—Surah Anaam (6:123)</p>
<p>The verse does not say that created them to do mischief , they just conspire and plot but Allah the exalted says that<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong> they conspire not except against themselves, and they perceive [it] not.</strong></span>The Tafsir of the verse reads :</p>
<p>Ibn Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas explained the Ayah<br />
(. ..great ones of its wicked people to plot therein.) &#8220;We give the leadership to these wicked ones and they commit evil in it. When they do this, We destroy them with Our torment.&#8221; Mujahid and Qatadah said that in the Ayah,<br />
(great ones) refers to leaders.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong><em>Agniveer :</em></strong></span></p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>6. Allah&#8217;s consistency</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Stand: </span>I never change my stand and I never do injustice (kaaf 28)<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong><br />
</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Contradiction:</span></p>
<p>I can send an Ayat and then send a better or equivalent one (Bakar 106)</p>
<p>When I change an Ayat and send a new one to replace it, only I know the revelation (Nahl 101)</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong><em>My Response :</em></strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
[ Allah ] will say, &#8220;Do not dispute before Me, while I had already presented to you the warning.</p>
<p>-Surah Qaf (50:28)</p>
<p>So Please give the correct reference. Now let me explain Surah Baqarah Verse 106 :</p>
<p>We do not abrogate a verse or cause it to be forgotten except that We bring forth [one] better than it or similar to it. Do you not know that Allah is over all things competent?</p>
<p>-Surah Baqarah (2:106)</p>
<p>And when We substitute a verse in place of a verse – and Allah is most knowing of what He sends down – they say, &#8220;You, [O Muhammad], are but an inventor [of lies].&#8221; But most of them do not know.</p>
<p>-Surah Nahl (16:101)</p>
<p>It means that Allah reveals a judgment and law which is suitable for a specific time and area and after that time he substitutes it with something better or similar when time changes or there is a gradual change from one law to other.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong><em>Agniveer :</em></strong></span></p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>7. Per-capita power of a Muslim</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Stand: </span>Incite Muslims to fight, because if you stick to fighting, 20 of you will be more powerful than 200 kafirs and 100 will be more powerful than 1000 kafirs. (Anfal 65)</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Contradiction:</span></p>
<p>If you stick to fighting, 100 of you will be more powerful than 200 kafirs and 1000 will be more powerful than 2000 kafirs. (Anfal 66)</p>
<p><em>As per first Ayat, one Muslim was more powerful than 10 kafirs, but in next one, he is more powerful than only 2 kafirs. Allah forgot his maths perhaps!</em></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong><em>My Response :</em></strong></span></p>
<p>First of all the verses are talking about fighting with those who fought against the believers but if they incline to peace , peace is better :</p>
<p>And if they incline to peace, then incline to it [also] and rely upon Allah . Indeed, it is He who is the Hearing, the Knowing.</p>
<p>-Surah Anfal (8:61)</p>
<p><em>Secondly , only if Mr. Agniveer had read the verses properly in context he would have understood what it means :</em></p>
<p>O Prophet, urge the believers to battle. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">If there are among you twenty [who are] steadfast, they will overcome two hundred.</span> And if there are among you one hundred [who are] steadfast, they will overcome a thousand of those who have disbelieved because they are a people who do not understand.Now, <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Allah has lightened [the hardship] for you</strong></span>, and <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>He knows that among you is weakness.</strong></span> So if there are from you one hundred [who are] steadfast, they will overcome two hundred. And if there are among you a thousand, they will overcome two thousand by permission of Allah . And Allah is with the steadfast.</p>
<p>-Surah Anfal (8:65-66)</p>
<p><em>The verse are so clear that they don&#8217;t need an explanation still for people like Mr. Agniveer let me explain :</em></p>
<p><em>The first verse asks one believer to overcome ten disbelievers but in second later Allah eases the the task for the believers to overcome two disbeliever per believer <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>because they became weak after fighting.</strong></span></em></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong><em>Agniveer :</em></strong></span></p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>8.  Self-control</strong></span></p>

<p>Those who are not married should control themselves. (Nur 33)</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Contradiction:</span></p>
<p>Your slave girls are Halal (justified) for you and so are other women that you marry. (Nisa 24)</p>
<p>There is no sin in having sex with wives and slave-girls (Momunoon 6)</p>
<p><em>Obviously, concept of Brahmacharya and considering all women except one single wife as mother/sister in unheard in Islam. That is why even the hoax of self-control is contradicted by Quran itself!</em></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong><em>My Response :</em></strong></span></p>
<p>Islam calls for self-control i.e. not to commit adultery and unlawful sexual intercourse. Regarding slave girls <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Islam allows consensual sex with slave girls not rape</strong></span> only by their permission and it is lawful in Islam so where is the contradiction ?</p>
<p>So, Mr. Agniveer do Vedas prohibit polygamy ? Of Course not :</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>As yearning wives cleave to their yearning husband</strong></span>, so cleave our hymns to thee, O Lord most potent.</p>
<p>-Rig Veda [Book 1: Hymn 62 : Verse 11]
<p><em>So, before criticizing the Qur&#8217;an you need to learn your Vedas.</em></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Stand: </span>Allah listened to your prayers and sent 1000 angels to help Muslims and kill the kafirs. (Anakal 12)</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Contradiction:</span></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong><em>My Response :</em></strong></span></p>
[Remember] when your Lord inspired to the angels, &#8220;I am with you, so strengthen those who have believed. I will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieved, so strike [them] upon the necks and strike from them every fingertip.&#8221;</p>
<p>-Surah Anfal (8:12)</p>
<p>We do not send down the angels <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>except with truth</strong></span>; and the disbelievers would not then be reprieved.</p>
<p>-Surah Hijr (15:8)</p>
<p>Is there a contradiction here ? <img decoding="async" src="http://theindianmuslim.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/062415_1444_rebuttaltoa1.gif" alt="" />. Does the verse say that Allah does not send down angels at all ?</p>

<p>There is no contradiction , Allah challenges in Surah Isra verse 88 :</p>
<p>Say, &#8220;If mankind and the jinn gathered in order to produce the like of this Qur&#8217;an, they could not produce the like of it, even if they were to each other assistants.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Allah makes the challenge easier by asking to produce only ten Chapters in Surah Hud (not Had) verse 13 :</p>
<p>Or do they say, &#8220;He invented it&#8221;? Say, &#8220;Then bring ten surahs like it that have been invented and call upon [for assistance] whomever you can besides Allah , if you should be truthful.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Allah makes the challenge still easier by asking only one Surah like it in Surah Baqarah verse 23 :</p>
<p>And if you are in doubt about what We have sent down upon Our Servant [Muhammad], then produce a surah the like thereof and call upon your witnesses other than Allah , if you should be truthful.</p>
<p>So there is no contradiction Allah is simply making the challenge easy for you disbelievers.But you will never be able to do it.</p>

<blockquote class="quote-light"><p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong><em>Agniveer :</em></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Earth and Sky</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Stand:</span></p>
<p>I made sky with my own hands. (Zariyat 47)</p>
<p>Allah made sky and earth in 6 days and then sat on his throne. (Araf 54)</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Contradiction:</span></p>
<p>He asked Earth and Sky whether they came with happiness or out of compulsion. Both said that they came with happiness. (Sajdah 11)</p>
<p><em>Obviously this Ayat implies that Earth and Sky were already present but came from somewhere. But as per previous Ayats, they were created by Allah and not present before that!</em></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong><em>My Response :</em></strong></span></p>
<p>Allah created the heavens and the earth .<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Regarding the verse where Allah asks the universe (i.e. Heaven) to come into being its Surah Fussilat Verse 11 not Surah Sajdah.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">And I don&#8217;t know what Mr. Agniveer wants to argue on that verse , Let me just explain the verse :</span></p>
<p>Moreover He directed Himself to the heaven while it was smoke and said to it and to the earth, &#8220;<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Come [into being]</strong></span>, willingly or by compulsion.&#8221; They said, &#8220;We have come willingly.&#8221;</p>
<p>-Surah Fussilat (41:11)</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Here Allah commands the heaven to come into being i.e. the creation of celestial bodies because before that heaven was in form of smoke , I doubt if Mr. Agniveer has understood the verse.</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The verse says that the universe was in a state of <em>dukhan</em> (Smoke) which is scientifically miraculous because the universe was indeed in form of hot gaseous elements after Big Bang So , here Allah orders the smoke to<strong> come [into being] </strong>i.e. form celestial bodies out of that matter. It does not say that heaven was present before and Allah did not create it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong><em>Agniveer :</em></strong></span></p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>12. Rebirth</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Stand:</span></p>
<p>Those who refuse to believe in past life and Allah are full of ego and deny the truth. (Nahl 22)</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Contradiction:</span></p>
<p>Allah gave you birth first time and shall again raise you after doomsday. (Anukvoot 20)</p>
<p><em>First Ayat clearly refers to previous birth before existing one, but second Ayat denies it!</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong><em>My Response :</em></strong></span></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know from where Mr. Agniveer is quoting. Just have a look at what the verses say :</p>
<p>Your god is one God. But <span style="text-decoration:underline;">those who do not believe in the Hereafter</span> &#8211; their hearts are disapproving, and they are arrogant.</p>
<p>-Surah Nahl (16:22)</p>
<p>Say, [O Muhammad], &#8220;Travel through the land and observe how He began creation. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Then Allah will produce the final creation</span>. Indeed Allah , over all things, is competent.&#8221;</p>
<p>-Surah Ankaboot (29:20)</p>
<p>Who thinks that the above two verses contradict in any way needs a <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Psychiatrist .</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong><em>Agniveer :</em></strong></span></p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>13. Process of Creation</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Stand:</span></p>
<p>When Allah wants something to be created, he simply says, &#8220;Kun&#8221; and it gets created. (Nahl 40)</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Contradiction:</span></p>
<p>Allah created earth and sky in 6 days. (Hud 7)</p>
<p>Allah created earth and sky in 8 days. (Hamim 9-12)</p>
<p><em>Many Islamic experts would try to justify discrepancy in last 2 ayats through crazy arguments. Since none of them were present during creation, they are not the right authority to comment in first place! After all entire Islam is based on stories that one only hears but humanity has never and can never verify in this life.</em></p>
<p><em>Further what about one verse stating things happen by saying &#8220;Kun&#8221; and others saying they take up to 6-8 days? This is a blatant contradiction.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong><em>My Response :</em></strong></span></p>
<p>Indeed, Our word to a thing when We intend it is but that We say to it, &#8220;Be,&#8221; and it is.</p>
<p>-Surah Nahl (16:40)</p>
<p>And it is He who <span style="text-decoration:underline;">created the heavens and the earth in six periods</span></p>
<p>-Surah Hud (11:7)</p>
<p>Say, &#8220;Do you indeed disbelieve in He who created the earth in two days and attribute to Him equals? That is the Lord of the worlds.&#8221; And He placed on the earth firmly set mountains over its surface, and He blessed it and determined therein its [creatures&#8217;] sustenance in four days without distinction – for [the information] of those who ask.<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Simultaneously</strong></span> (<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Thumma</em></span>) He directed Himself to the heaven while it was smoke and said to it and to the earth, &#8220;Come [into being], willingly or by compulsion.&#8221; They said, &#8220;We have come willingly.&#8221;And He completed them as seven heavens within two days and inspired in each heaven its command. And We adorned the nearest heaven with lamps and as protection. That is the determination of the Exalted in Might, the Knowing.</p>
<p>-Surah Fussilat (41:9-12)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Surah Fussilat verses  9-12 say that Allah created the heavens and earth nowhere in these verses the word eight is mentioned , Mr. Agniveer has just counted the days given in each verse and his no knowledge of Arabic is exposed here the word in verse 12 is <em>Thumma</em> which means <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Then, Moreover , Besides , simultaneously</strong></span> etc.</p>

<p>Lanes Lexicon, Volume 1, Pages 390-391:<br />
<span style="color:navy;">&#8220;to pick up, collect, repair, heap up (thing in a place). thamma – over there, here, in that direction, there in, thither. thumma – then, afterwards, <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>moreover</strong></span>, mostly used as a conjunction indicating a sequence in line or order to be rendered as then/thereafter, also used as a more simple conjunction – <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>and</strong></span>.&#8221;</span><br />
I think Mr. Agniveer knows the meaning of simultaneously. So no need of more explanation here.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Allah decrees a matter he says to it &#8220;Be&#8221; and It is. Now, does that give us the time in which Allah created the heavens and earth by his <em>Kun</em> . The creation of universe was a long process not an instant coffee cup. Allah said &#8220;Be&#8221; and the creation happened , for Allah it was just the utterance and it gradually completed in six periods.The Arabic word for &#8220;be&#8221; in this verse is &#8220;Kun&#8221; (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111011205722/http:/corpus.quran.com/qurandictionary.jsp?root=kwn" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right"><span style="color:blue;text-decoration:underline;">*</span><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>) which comes from the root: Kaf-Waw-Nun which means</p>
<p><a href="http:/dictionary.sakhr.com/SearchResults.aspx" class="broken_link" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="color:blue;text-decoration:underline;">Sakhr Dictionary:</span></a><br />
<span style="color:navy;">&#8220;formalize , make , frame , constitute , compose , create , shape , form , <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>set up</strong></span> , fashion.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>So, Allah SET UP the heavens and Earth which means he began the creation, and it began. It began, and took 6 periods of time as I have proved</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong><em>Agniveer :</em></strong></span></p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Stand: </span>Do not bow down to anyone except Allah. (Hud 2)</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Contradiction:</span></p>
<p>Allah asked angels to bow down to Adam. Everyone did but Satan refused. Hence he was punished. (Taha 116)</p>
<p><em>So Satan faced the punishment for obeying Allah!</em></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong><em>My Response :</em></strong></span></p>
[<strong>Through a messenger, saying</strong>], <span style="text-decoration:underline;">&#8220;Do not worship except Allah</span> . Indeed, I am to you from Him a warner and a bringer of good tidings,&#8221;</p>
<p>-Surah Hud (11:2)</p>
<p>The verse is a <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>command to mankind</strong></span> not to worship anyone except Allah.</p>
<p>And [mention] when <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>We said to the angels</strong></span>, &#8220;Prostrate to Adam,&#8221; and they prostrated, except Iblees; he refused.</p>
<p>-Surah Taha (20:116)<br />
This was a command to Iblees and angels to prostate to Adam (peace be upon him) , it was just a command of Allah and not the prostration of Worship (Sajdah Ibadat). Satan did not refuse because he wanted to obey Allah , He refused because of Ego , Pride and Arrogance. Here is the verse (Mr. Agniveer is a Ph.D in misinterpreting verses) :</p>
[ Allah ] said, &#8220;<span style="text-decoration:underline;">What prevented you from prostrating when I commanded you</span>?&#8221; [Satan] said, &#8220;<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>I am better than him</strong></span>. <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>You created me from fire and created him from clay</strong></span>.&#8221;</p>
<p>-Surah Araf (7:12)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong><em>Agniveer :</em></strong></span></p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p>All open-minded people can clearly see that Quran is nothing but a hotch-potch of verses written by several people over several years and has nothing to do with the Supreme or Spirituality.</p>
<p>All wise people should discard false texts which are full of contradictions, promote intolerance, unscientific, full of petty stories and imaginations and come to path of Vedas.</p>
<p>Because Vedas alone are free from contradictions, contain no history, depict scientific principles and call for compassion for all living beings.</p>
<p>May the truth prevail!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong><em>My Response :</em></strong></span></p>
<p>So here we are Mr. Agniveer , all your false claims , mis-references , mistranslations , misinterpretations , partial quotes are refuted badly. So finally I just give u a challenge from the Noble Qur&#8217;an itself regarding the topic :</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong><em>Then do they not reflect upon the Qur&#8217;an?</em></strong></span><br />
<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>If it had been from [any] other than Allah</em></span>,<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong> they would have found within it much contradiction.</strong></span></p>
<p>-Surah Nisa (4:82)</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>I challenge Mr. Agniveer to come up with a single contradiction from The Noble Qur&#8217;an but its a matter of fact that he will never be able to do that.</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regarding your &#8220;<strong>scientific</strong>&#8221; , &#8220;<strong>uncorrupted</strong>&#8221; , &#8220;<strong>non-contradictory</strong>&#8221; and &#8220;<strong>eternal</strong>&#8221; Vedas we have written articles and will be writing more Insha&#8217;Allah.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I end by the following verse from the Noble Qur&#8217;an :</p>
<p>And say, &#8220;<strong>Truth has come</strong>, and <strong><em>falsehood has departed</em></strong>. <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Indeed is falsehood, [by nature], ever bound to depart.&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p>-Surah Al-Isra (17:81)</p>

</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">2. Muhammad said: Cut off your prayer when a dog, an ass, a pig, a Jew, or a woman passes in front you, but it will suffice if they pass in front of you at a distance of over a stone&#8217;s throw.  (Book #2, Hadith #0704)<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">3.  The Messenger of &#8216;Allah said: …y prayer would be cut off by (passing of an) ass, woman, and black Dog. When he was asked about the specialty of black dog, he said: The black dog is a devil.  (Muslim, Book #004, Hadith #1032)<br />

<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">4. Believers, approach not prayers with a mind befogged or intoxicated until you understand what you utter, nor when you are polluted, until after you have bathed. If you are ill, or on a journey, or come from answering the call of nature, or you have touched a woman, and you find no water, then take for yourselves clean dirt, and rub your faces and hands. Lo!

</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:#333399;"><strong><em>Abu Dharr reported: THE MESSENGER OF &#8216;ALLAH (may peace be upon him) SAID: When any one of you stands for prayer and there is a thing before him equal to the back of the saddle that covers him and in case there is not before him (a thing) equal to the back of the saddle, HIS PRAYER WOULD BE CUT OFF BY (passing of an) ASS, WOMAN, AND BLACK DOG. I said: O Abu Dharr, what feature is there in a black dog which distinguish it from the red dog and the yellow dog? He said: O, son of my brother, I asked the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) as you are asking me, and he said: The black dog is a devil.

</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><strong><br />
<span style="color:black;">Response: </span></strong><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><strong>The translation given is practically unreadable, so I am translating it again:</strong><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><strong>Abd Allah ibn al-Samit said: Abu Dharr said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger — Allah bless and salute him! — said:</strong><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><strong><em>&#8220;When one of you stands in prayer, what definitely constitutes a barrier for him is an object placed in front of him of the same height as the back of a camel-saddle. If it is not in front of him and of the same height as the back of a camel-saddle, then some [stray] donkey, or some woman passing, or some black dog will cut off his prayer.&#8221; I said: &#8220;O Abu Dharr! What is it that makes a black dog different from a red or yellow dog?&#8221; He replied: &#8220;O dear cousin! I asked Allah&#8217;s Messenger — Allah bless and salute him! — the exact same question. He said that the black dog is a devil.&#8221;</em></strong><br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><strong>Notes on the legal rulings based on this hadith and its meaning:</strong><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><strong>The passing of the above-mentioned in front of the person at prayer does not invalidate his prayer according to the vast majority of the Imams of Law, Salaf and Khalaf (early and late authorities) who concur that the meaning of &#8220;will cut off his prayer&#8221; is not literal but means: &#8220;will make his prayer imperfect&#8221; due to the distraction they will cause in people&#8217;s hearts, while Imam Ahmad considered that only the passing of a black dog actually invalidates it. This was mentioned by Imam al-Nawawi in Sharh Sahih Muslim and al-Mubarakfuri in Tuhfa al-Ahwadhi.</strong><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:black;"><strong>In other words the hadith does not view women as impure or equal to animals, thats nonsense, what the hadith ment is that women who pass by in front of a praying person , can distract that person during his prayer (which would make his prayer imperfect) , just like a dogg will distract his prayer. It&#8217;s like beauty and the beast, the beauty can distract his attention (due to it&#8217;s beauty) and the beast can distract his attention (due to it&#8217;s smell or sound/wildness etc) . </strong></span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:#333399;"><strong><em>Abu Huraira reported: THE MESSENGER OF ALLAH (may peace be upon him) SAID: A WOMAN, AN ASS AND A DOG DISRUPT THE PRAYER, but something like the back of a saddle guards against that. (Sahih Muslim, Book 004, <a href="http:/www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/muslim/004.smt.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="broken_link" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Number 1034</span></a>)</em></strong></span><br />
</span></p>

</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><strong><span style="color:black;">Again the hadith doesn&#8217;t say &#8216;nullify&#8217; but &#8216;disrupt&#8217; which in the other hadith quoted before is explained as &#8216;will cut off his prayer&#8217; , which means &#8216;</span>&#8220;will make his prayer imperfect&#8221; due to the distraction they will cause in people&#8217;s hearts.</strong><br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:black;"><strong>Response:</strong></span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:black;"><strong>This hadith shows that there is no difference between a menstruating or menstruating women, both can disrupt person his prayer, since it all had to do with distraction (see Imam nawawi&#8217;s sharch sahih muslim) in these hadith. The reason why this hadith uses the word &#8216;menstruating&#8217; women is because women are not allowed to pray during menstruation and therefor the women that would pass by in front of the praying men (during their 5 times a day obligated prayer) were menstruating women, thats why the prophet said &#8216;a menstruating women&#8217;. The fact that other hadith narrations don&#8217;t use the word &#8216;menstruation&#8217; proof that the hadith in question all has to do with things that can distract a person during his prayer. The menstruation itself has nothing to do with the issue of distraction during prayer, since the prophet (saw) himself prayed while his menstruating wife aicha (ra) was laying in bed in front him, and secondly since the prophet (saw) recited the quran while his menstruating wife aicha was close to him. The prophet (saw) also touched the clothes of his menstruating wife Maimuna during prayer.</strong></span><br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="background:white;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><strong>Narrated Aisha, Ummul Mu&#8217;minin: <em>I was sleeping in front of the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) with my legs between him and the qiblah.

<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:black;"><strong>Response:</strong></span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><strong><span style="color:black;">All these things clearly proof that it all has to do with distraction (things that mostly would distract a man during prayer) and nothing else. The thins mentioned by the prophet (saw) in this hadith could mostly distract a person during prayer <em>(women are mentioned, because a menstruating women does not have to pray, and therefor most likely would pass by in front of a man during prayer, since all persons are obligated to pray, except the menstruating women)</em> . A jew could distract a muslim during praying due to his typical outstanding jewish look (the long white beards/jewisch clothes etc. ) , also many jews and muslims were rivals back then (due to wars etc.) , seeing ones rival could off course distract oneself during prayer. The pig could distract the praying person due to its bad smell and loud sound, the magian could distract the praying person due to his outstanding look, the women could distract a person due to their beauty (while he should be 100% with his mind to Allah swt during prayer instead of women or other things) , in other words all these thoughts &#8216;</span>&#8220;will make his prayer imperfect&#8221; due to the distraction they will cause in people&#8217;s hearts.</strong><br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><strong>The hadith in question do not compare women at all with animals, secondly the hadith in question talks about things that mostly distract men from prayer, in other words it&#8217;s all about distraction and not about menstruation (since the prophet touched the clothes of his menstruating wife during prayer etc) or impurity of animals, this is not the point here. Let us take a final look again at the main hadith, and summarize all:</strong><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><strong>Abd Allah ibn al-Samit said: Abu Dharr said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger — Allah bless and salute him! — said:</strong><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><strong><em>&#8220;When one of you stands in prayer, what definitely constitutes a barrier for him is an object placed in front of him of the same height as the back of a camel-saddle. If it is not in front of him and of the same height as the back of a camel-saddle, then some [stray] donkey, or some woman passing, or some black dog will cut off his prayer.&#8221; I said: &#8220;O Abu Dharr! What is it that makes a black dog different from a red or yellow dog?&#8221; He replied: &#8220;O dear cousin! I asked Allah&#8217;s Messenger — Allah bless and salute him! — the exact same question. He said that the black dog is a devil.&#8221;</em></strong><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><strong><br />
Notes on the legal rulings based on this hadith and its meaning:</strong><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><strong>The passing of the above-mentioned in front of the person at prayer does not invalidate his prayer according to the vast majority of the Imams of Law, Salaf and Khalaf (early and late authorities) who concur that the meaning of &#8220;will cut off his prayer&#8221; is not literal but means: &#8220;will make his prayer imperfect&#8221; due to the distraction they will cause in people&#8217;s hearts, while Imam Ahmad considered that only the passing of a black dog actually invalidates it. This was mentioned by Imam al-Nawawi in Sharh Sahih Muslim and al-Mubarakfuri in Tuhfa al-Ahwadhi.</strong><br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><strong>The renowned sunni scholar Sheikh G.F. haddad Commented on the next hadith: </strong><br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><strong>`A&#8217;isha said: </strong><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><strong>&#8220;<em>Are you [the narrator of that hadith] equating us [women] with dogs and donkeys? It happened to me more than once that I was lying down in bed, and the Prophet — Allah bless and salute him! — would come in, the bed being between us, and pray. Disliking to stand up in his face, I would slink down towards the bottom of the bed until I cleared my bedcover</em>.&#8221;</strong><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><strong>Ibn Hajar in Fath al-Bari mentioned that al-Bukhari adduced this hadith to show that the fact that a man at prayer faces a woman does not necessaily distract him.</strong><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><strong>Among the benefits of `A&#8217;isha&#8217;s narration of the Prophet&#8217;s behavior — Allah bless and salute him — are the following:</strong><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><strong>1. An important elaboration on the general legal rulings inferred from the previous hadith, specifying that distraction is not an inevitable fact for all people. This is confirmed by another narration from `A&#8217;isha in Bukhari states that at other times she would continue to sleep, and that the Prophet — Allah bless and salute him — would touch her lightly upon prostrating so that she would withdraw her legs to make way for him, then she would stretch them again when he got up.</strong><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><strong>2. The clarification that women are less likely to cause distraction because they can take care to avoid whatever causes it, especially a spouse, as this situation is the likeliest to occur frequently in the life of Muslims.</strong><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><strong>3. The teaching that one should not mindlessly equate women with animals in the course of relating this authentic hadith.</strong><br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><strong>Osama&#8217;s note:</strong><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><strong>In other words it&#8217;s all about distraction (things that can distract a man during prayer, which would make his prayer less perfect) , a beautifull women can distract a man during prayer, just like a stinking ass or wild dogg can distract a man during prayer, this does not mean that women and asses/dogs are viewed equal (which is a redicilous claim) , it&#8217;s beauty and the beast, but both can distract a man during prayer. The fact that women are singled out in the hadith quoed by christian missionaries has to do with the fact , that women more likely can distract a men from prayer , then muslim-men can do to other muslim-men (when a man for example is offering an extra prayer on the street somewhere, cause normally during the 5 obligated prayer-times, all muslims have to pray, except menstruating women or little children) . However every person has it&#8217;s own nature and weakness, some can easily get distracted (even by other muslim-men) during prayer while others not, thats why the general rule is that nobody should pass by a praying person , women AND MEN. </strong><br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><strong>Sahih Bukhari, Volume 1, Book 9, Number 489 <em>Narrated Busr bin Said: that Zaid bin Khalid sent him to Abi Juhaim to ask him what he had heard from Allah&#8217;s Apostle about a person passing in front of another person who was praying. Abu Juhaim replied, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;If the person who passes in front of another person in prayer knew the magnitude of his sin he would prefer to wait for 40 (days, months or years) rather than to pass in front of him.&#8221; Abu An-Nadr said, &#8220;I do not remember exactly whether he said 40 days, months or years.&#8221; </em></strong><br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><strong>Here the prophet clearly tells us that such a person (could be man or woman) would commit a sin, why would he commit a sin ? Off course because he probably could distract a person during prayer, which could &#8216;cut off&#8217; that persons prayer (make his prayer less perfect or imperfect) . So both men and women can distract a person during prayer, which would &#8216;cut off&#8217; / make less perfect &#8216; someones prayer. The reason that women are sometimes singled out in a hadith, is because a beautifull women more likely distracts a man from prayer then an ordinary muslim-man and secondly in most cases during the normal 5 times a day obligated prayer, all men have to pray except menstruating women, thats why the prophet pointed out to &#8216;menstruating women&#8217; in the hadith and not to men, since they are obligated to pray. </strong><br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><strong>Sahih Bukhari Volume 1, Book 9, Number 487 &amp; 488: </strong> <strong><em>Narrated Abu Salih As-Samman: I saw Abu Said Al-Khudri praying on a Friday, behind something which acted as a Sutra. A young man from Bani Abi Mu&#8217;ait, wanted to pass in front of him, but Abu Said repulsed him with a push on his chest. Finding no alternative he again tried to pass but Abu Said pushed him with a greater force. The young man abused Abu Said and went to Marwan and lodged a complaint against Abu Said and Abu Said followed the young man to Marwan who asked him, &#8220;O Abu Said! What has happened between you and the son of your brother?&#8221; Abu Sa&#8217;id said to him, &#8220;I heard the Prophet saying, &#8216;If anybody amongst you is praying behind something as a Sutra and somebody tries to pass in front of him, then he should repulse him and if he refuses, he should use force against him for he is a satan.&#8217; &#8221; </em></strong><br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><strong>Here again we clearly see that a prayer can be distracted by anybody (men and women) who passes by in front of the praying person, the prophet clearly said: anybody ( ALSO MEN ! ) , so again the claim that &#8216; women are compared to doggs/asses &#8216; is foolishness and not true, since the hadith in question quoted by the christian missionaries only talks about things that can distract a man during prayer, this can also be man. </strong><br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><strong>Allah Almighty knows best. Blessings and peace on the best of creation, our Prophet Muhammad, and upon his Family and all his Companions.</strong><br />

</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:black;"><strong>: </strong>the Hadith mentioned above has come in most of the major books of Hadith in the words near to the ones quoted here.

<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:black;">It is evident from this text of the Hadith that this saying has been erroneously attributed to the Prophet (sws).<strong><br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Written by Abdul Fatir</p>
<p>Dr. Zakir Naik :</p>
<p>THE LIGHT OF THE MOON IS REFLECTED LIGHT</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">It was believed by earlier civilizations that the moon emanates its own light</span>. Science now tells us that the light of the moon is reflected light. However this fact was mentioned in the Qur&#8217;aan 1,400 years ago in the following verse:. &#8220;<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Blessed is He Who made Constellations in the skies, And placed therein a Lamp And a Moon giving light</strong></span>.&#8221; [Al-Qur&#8217;aan 25:61]
<p><span id="more-599"></span></p>
<p>The Arabic word for the sun in the Qur&#8217;aan, is shams. It is referred to as siraaj, which means a &#8216;torch&#8217; or as wahhaaj which means &#8216;a blazing lamp&#8217; or as diya which means &#8216;shining glory&#8217;. All three descriptions are appropriate to the sun, since it generates intense heat and light by its internal combustion. The Arabic word for the moon is qamar and it is described in the Qur&#8217;aan as muneer, which is a body that gives nur i.e. light. Again, the Qur&#8217;aanic description matches perfectly with the true nature of the moon, which does not give off light itself and is an inert body that reflects the light of the sun. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Not once in the Qur&#8217;aan, is the moon mentioned as siraaj, wahhaaj or diya or the sun as nur or muneer. This implies that the Qur&#8217;aan recognizes the difference between the nature of sunlight and moonlight.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">The Arabic word dahaha has been translated by A. Yusuf Ali as &#8220;vast expanse&#8221;, which also is correct. The word dahaha also means an ostrich-egg</span></p>
<p>Consider the following verses related to the nature of light from the sun and the moon: &#8220;It is He who made the sun To be a shining glory And the moon to be a light (Of beauty).&#8221; [Al-Qur&#8217;aan 10:5] &#8220;See ye not How Allah has created The seven heavens One above another, &#8220;And made the moon A light in their midst, and made the sun As a (Glorious) Lamp?&#8221; [Al-Qur&#8217;aan 71:15-16]&#8217;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Agniveer :</strong></p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p>As has been already shared, Aryabhatta not only explained that moon and other planets reflect the sun&#8217;s light but also explained eclipses. Dr. Naik needs to read about some great non-Arabic civilizations of the time (I wonder how he missed this one being born in a civilization as great as Indian – anyways).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>My Response :</strong></p>
<p>I agree that some people even before Aryabhatta reasoned that moon&#8217;s light is a reflection but what Dr. Zakir meant was that this idea was not unanimously accepted everywhere on earth until recent times.</p>
<p>The ancient Greek philosopher Anaxagoras (d. 428 BC) reasoned that the Sun and Moon were both giant spherical rocks, and that the latter reflected the light of the former.</p>
<p>Although the Chinese of the Han Dynasty believed the Moon to be energy equated to qi, their &#8216;radiating influence&#8217; theory also recognized that the light of the Moon was merely a reflection of the Sun.</p>
<p>As seen above it was put forward by ancient people but it was not accepted overall until recent scientific observations confirmed it.</p>
<p><strong>Agniveer :</strong></p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p>Now if Dr. Naik is to be believed, Nur means reflected light. No previous Islamic scholar has made this scandalous claim before – and do you know why? Because one of the 99 Names of the God of Quran (Allah) is AN-Nur. If we translate this word according to Dr. Naik&#8217;s definition Allah&#8217;s name would become:THE REFLECTED LIGHT! Now the question to ask Dr. Naik is that if Allah is &#8220;reflected light&#8221; who is the Original Light Source? [We await Dr. Naik&#8217;s answer to this question eagerly]</blockquote>
<p><strong>My Response :</strong></p>
<p>Meaning of the word Noor :</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial;">نور</span> (noor): <span style="font-family:Arial;">بيّن</span> (bayyan) reveal, reflect.</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial;">نور</span> (noor): be revealed, to be lighted, to receive light.</p>
<p>Sakhr Dictionary 2006/2007:</p>
<p>&#8220;light, brightness, illumination, glow, gleam.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Hans Wehr Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic, Page1009:</p>
<p>&#8220;light, beam, brightness, gleam, glow, illumination, lamp, indirect light.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now Agniveer claims that No previous Islamic scholar has made this scandalous claim before :</p>
<p>Ibn Kathir (May Allah Be Pleased With Him) (1301–1373) says in his Tafsir of The Noble Qur&#8217;an :</p>
<p>the sun rises each day and sets at the end of the day, giving one kind of light all the time, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">but it moves, rising and setting at different points in the summer and winter</span>, thus making the days and nights longer or shorter alternatively according to the season. Its authority is in the daytime, for it is the heavenly body that dominates the day. As for the moon, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Allah has decreed that it should pass through different phases</span>. At the beginning of the month, the moon appears small when it rises. It gives off little light, then on the second night its light increases and it rises to a higher position, and the higher it rises the more light it gives – <span style="text-decoration:underline;">even though it is reflected from the sun</span> – until it becomes full on the fourteenth night of the month.</p>
<p>Surah Furqan 25:61: Sher Ali:</p>
<p><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Blessed is HE Who has made in the heaven mansions of stars and has placed therein a Lamp producing light and a moon that reflects light.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Surah Furqan 25:61: Amatul Rahman Omaralt:</p>
<p><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Blessed is He Who has placed stars in the heaven and has set in it the glowing sun (that produces light) and the glittering moon (that reflects light).&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Coming to the name of Allah as An-Noor , it actually refers to the spiritual light of Allah which is reflected in theHeavens and Earth moreover the verse (24:35) in which Allah is referred as An-Noor smokes Agniveer itself (if thought that An-Noor actually refers to physical light of Allah) when read fully :</p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span">للَّهُ نُورُ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ ۚ مَثَلُ نُورِهِ كَمِشْكَاةٍ فِيهَا مِصْبَاحٌ ۖ الْمِصْبَاحُ فِي زُجَاجَةٍ ۖ الزُّجَاجَةُ كَأَنَّهَا كَوْكَبٌ دُرِّيٌّ يُوقَدُ مِن شَجَرَةٍ مُّبَارَكَةٍ زَيْتُونَةٍ لَّا شَرْقِيَّةٍ وَلَا غَرْبِيَّةٍ يَكَادُ زَيْتُهَا يُضِيءُ وَلَوْ لَمْ تَمْسَسْهُ نَارٌ ۚ نُّورٌ عَلَىٰ نُورٍ ۗ يَهْدِي اللَّهُ لِنُورِهِ مَن يَشَاءُ ۚ وَيَضْرِبُ اللَّهُ الْأَمْثَالَ لِلنَّاسِ ۗ وَاللَّهُ </span><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span">بِكُلِّ شَيْءٍ عَلِيمٌ</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Allah is the Light of the heavens and the earth</strong></span>. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">The example of His light is like a niche within which is a lamp, the lamp is within glass, the glass as if it were a pearly [white] star lit from [the oil of] a blessed olive tree, neither of the east nor of the west, whose oil would almost glow even if untouched by fire. Light upon light</span>. <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Allah guides to His light whom He wills</strong></span>. And Allah presents examples for the people, and Allah is Knowing of all things.</p>
<p>-Surah Nur (24:35)</p>
<p>The phrases <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Light of the heavens and the earth</strong></span> and<span style="text-decoration:underline;"> <strong>Allah guides to His light whom He wills</strong> </span>clearly show that it refers to the spiritual light of Allah which is reflected in the Universe. However for those who insist that it is physical the rest of example The example of His light is like a niche within which is a lamp, the lamp is within glass, the glass as if it were a pearly [white] star lit from [the oil of] a blessed olive tree, neither of the east nor of the west, whose oil would almost glow even if untouched by fire. shows that Allah has his own light which he reflects himself just like a halogen lamp which gives its own light and also has a reflector provided which reflects its own light.</p>
<p>Regarding Surah Nur 24:35: from reading the context, one will see that this verse is simply a metaphor. The parable of &#8220;the light of God&#8221; is not meant to express that God has light which is reflected from something else. It means he has his own light &amp; reflects light, which refers to spiritual light. The Arabic word used for &#8220;niche&#8221; in this verse is &#8220;mishka&#8221; (*). There is a prefix added to this noun &#8220;ka&#8221; making it as &#8220;kamishkatin&#8221; since the letter &#8220;ka&#8221; points to a resemblance of a thing to another or indicating a metaphor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Muhammad Asad&#8217;s commentary – Surah Nur 24:35:</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p>&#8220;The particle ka (&#8220;as if&#8221; or &#8220;as it were&#8221;) prefixed to a noun is called kaf at-tashbih (&#8220;the letter kaf pointing to a resemblance [of one thing to another]&#8221; or &#8220;indicating a metaphor&#8221;). In the above context it alludes to the impossibility of defining God even by means of a metaphor or a parable – for, since &#8220;there is nothing like unto Him&#8221; (42:11), there is also &#8220;nothing that could be compared with Him&#8221; (112:4). Hence, the parable of &#8220;the light of God&#8221; is not meant to express His reality – which is inconceivable to any created being and, therefore, inexpressible in any human language – but only to allude to the illumination which He, who is the Ultimate Truth, bestows upon the mind and the feelings of all who are willing to be guided. Tabari, Baghawi, and Ibn Kathir quote Ibn &#8216;Abbas and Ibn Mas&#8217;ud as saying in this context: &#8220;It is the parable of His light in the heart of a believer.&#8221;</p>
<p>* The &#8220;lamp&#8221; is the revelation which God grants to His prophets and which is reflected in the believer&#8217;s heart – the &#8220;niche&#8221; of the above parable (Ubayy ibn Ka&#8217;b, as quoted by Tabari) – after being received and consciously grasped by his reason (&#8220;the glass [shining brightly] like a radiant star&#8221;): for it is through reason alone that true faith can find its way into the heart of man.</p>
<p>* It would seem that this is an allusion to the organic continuity of all divine revelation which, starting like a tree from one &#8220;root&#8221; or proposition – the statement of God&#8217;s existence and uniqueness – grows steadily throughout man&#8217;s spiritual history, branching out into a splendid variety of religious experience, thus endlessly widening the range of man&#8217;s perception of the truth. The association of this concept with the olive-tree apparently arises from the fact that this particular kind of tree is characteristic of the lands in which most of the prophetic precursors of the Qur&#8217;anic message lived, namely, the lands to the east of the Mediterranean: but since all true revelation flows from the Infinite Being, it is &#8220;neither of the east nor of the west&#8221; – and especially so the revelation of the Qur&#8217;an, which, being addressed to all mankind, is universal in its goal as well.</p>
<p>* The essence of the Qur&#8217;anic message is described elsewhere as &#8220;clear [in itself] and clearly showing the truth&#8221; (cf. note 2 on 12:1); and it is, I believe, this aspect of the Qur&#8217;an that the above sentence alludes to. Its message gives light because it proceeds from God; but it &#8220;would well-nigh give light [of itself] even though fire had not touched it&#8221;: i.e., even though one may be unaware that it has been &#8220;touched by the fire&#8221; of divine revelation, its inner consistency, truth, and wisdom ought to be self-evident to anyone who approaches it in the light of his reason and without prejudice.</p>
<p>* Although most of the commentators read the above phrase in the sense of &#8220;God guides unto His light whomever He wills,&#8221; Zamakhshari gives it the sense adopted in my rendering (both being syntactically permissible).</p>
<p>* I.e., because of their complexity, certain truths can be conveyed to man only by means of parables or allegories: see notes 5 and 8 on 3:7.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p>Maududi&#8217;s commentary – Surah Nur 24:35:</p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p>&#8220;The phrase &#8220;heavens and the earth&#8221; in the Qur&#8217;an is generally used for the &#8220;universe&#8221;. Thus the verse would also mean: &#8220;Allah is the light of the whole universe&#8221;</p>
<p>Light is something which makes things visible; which is itself manifest and helps make other things manifest. The human mind conceives light in this very sense. Absence of light is termed darkness, invisibility and obscurity. On the other hand, when there is visibility and things become exposed to view, man says there is light. Allah has been called `Light&#8217; in this basic sense, and not in the sense of a beam of light which travels at the speed of 186,000 miles per second and stimulates the optic nerve through the retina. This conception of light has nothing to do with the reality of the meaning for which human mind has coined this word; rather the word light is used for all those lights which we experience in this physical world All human words used for Allah are used in their basic sense and meaning, and not with reference to their physical connotation. For instance, when, the word &#8220;sight&#8221; is used with respect to Allah, it does not mean that Allah has an eye like men and animals with which He sees. Similarly when we say that Allah &#8216;hears&#8217; or &#8216;grips&#8217; or &#8216;grasps&#8217;, it does not mean that He hears through ears, or grips or grasps with the hand like us. These words are used in a metaphorical sense and only a man of very poor intelligence would have the misconception that hearing or seeing or grasping is not possible except in the limited and specific sense in which we experience it. Similarly it will be short-sightedness to interpret the word &#8216;light&#8217; in the sense of physical light rays emanating from a luminous body and affecting the retina. This word is not applicable to Allah in its limited sense, but in its absolute sense. That is, He alone in this universe is the real and prime &#8220;Cause of manifestation&#8221;, otherwise there is nothing but darkness. here. Everything which gives light and illuminates other things has got its light from Him; it has no light of its own.</p>
<p>The word light is also used for knowledge, and ignorance is termed as darkness. Allah is the Light of the universe in this sense too, because the knowledge of Reality and of right Guidance can be obtained from Him alone; without having recourse to His `Light&#8217;, there will be nothing but darkness of ignorance and the resultant vice and wickedness in the world.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you can see, it is NOT literal that Allah is light, but metaphorical. It is metaphorical that the spiritual light and guidance comes from Allah. Since Allah is the sources of light and guidance, Allah reflects his own guidance and metaphoric light to the sincere and truthful believers. The parable in the verse shows that through the niche, the it reflects light. Similarly, Allah reflects his own light &amp; is the source of light. Zakir Naik already refuted this allegation in his debate against William Campbell over 10 years ago…</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;And he said that if it means &#8216;a reflection of light&#8217;, – and he quoted the Qur&#8217;an, Surah Al-Nur Chapter No.24, Verse No.35 and 36 that<span style="font-family:Tahoma;">�</span> &#8216;Allah Subhanawataala is &#8216;Nuras samawati wal ardz&#8217;. &#8216;Is the light of the heavens and the earth.&#8217; Read the complete verse, and analyze what does it says. It says<span style="font-family:Tahoma;">�</span> &#8216;Allah is the light&#8217;<span style="font-family:Tahoma;">�</span> &#8216;Nur.&#8217; It says<span style="font-family:Tahoma;">�</span> &#8216;Allah is the light of the Heavens and the Earth.&#8217; It is a similitude – like a niche, and within the niche there is lamp. The &#8216;lamp<span style="font-family:Tahoma;">�</span> word is there. So Allah Subhanawataala has got light of its own, and even reflected light. Like you see a halogen lamp – you know which are here. The lamp inside is like a &#8216;siraj&#8217; but the reflector is like moon – it is reflecting light. The lamp, the tube<span style="font-family:Tahoma;">�</span> the tube is having a light of its own, but the reflector of the halogen lamp is reflecting light – So both two in one. So Allah Subhanawataala, Alhamdulillah<span style="font-family:Tahoma;">�</span>besides having light of its own – as the Qur&#8217;anic verse says<span style="font-family:Tahoma;">�</span> In the niche there is a lamp, and that lamp light of Allah Subhanawataala, is its own light, and Allah reflects its own light. Dr. William Campbell says that<span style="font-family:Tahoma;">�</span> &#8216;The Qur&#8217;an says that<span style="font-family:Tahoma;">�</span> &#8216;Qur&#8217;an is nur&#8217;<span style="font-family:Tahoma;">�</span> It is reflecting light.&#8217; Of course – The Qur&#8217;an is reflecting the light and the guidance of Allah Subhanawataala. Regarding Prophet Mohammed Sallallahu alaihi wasallam being Siraj – Yes he is. The Hadith of the beloved Prophet is giving guidance to us. So Muhammad Sallallahu alaihi wassallam <span style="font-family:Tahoma;">�</span> he is also &#8216;nur&#8217; he is also &#8216;Siraj&#8217;- Alhamdullillah. He has his own knowledge also – Alhamdulillah. He has the guidance from Allah Subhanawataala-Alhamdulillah. So if you use this word &#8216;Nur&#8217; as reflected light, and Munir as reflected light, yet Alhamdulillah, you can prove it scientifically that the light of the moon is not its own light, but it is the reflected light.&#8221; (Source)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Islamphobe and hate maongers(as used by agniveer) use this verse to abjure the verity that &#8220;Moon has a reflected light&#8221; as per mention in Quran. Subsequently, they try to balance this idea with the &#8220;light of Allah&#8221; mentioned in verse 24:35, so to speak that it means Allah is also acquiring light from somewhere else (Nauzubillah). Usually they use this particular verse and just pick the first part of it where it says that Allah is the &#8220;light of heavens and the earth&#8221;; they deliberately hop the further part of the verse where the word &#8220;lamp&#8221; is used. So, if you take the first part of the verse literally, you cannot say that Allah is taking light from somewhere else because Allah&#8217;s light is described further in the verse where the word &#8220;lamp&#8221; is used.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To make it more clear we address this verse again.</p>
<p>&#8220;God is the Light of the heavens and the earth. The Parable of His Light is as if there were a Niche and within it a Lamp:…&#8221;(Quran 24:35)</p>
<p>if you replace the word &#8220;light&#8221; with &#8220;guidance&#8221; the verse would read</p>
<p>&#8220;God is the guidance of the heavens and the earth. The parable of his guidance is as if there were a niche and with it a lamp…&#8221; (Quran 24:35)</p>
<p>So the verse means that God is the ultimate source of this guidance and he Himself reflects this guidance on human beings.The Quran makes it very clear that it is a parable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Agniveer :</strong></p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p>Dr. Naik, probably embarrassed, has not shared the entire verses 71:15-16. Here they are</p>
<p>15-16 &#8220;See ye not how Allah has created the seven heavens one above another. And made the moon a light in their midst, and made the sun as a (Glorious) Lamp?&#8221; So what do we have here:</p>
<p>–Again the Greek/Judaic philosophical thought of 7 heavens in which various stars and planets and sun and moon can be SEEN by the naked eye. Hence Allah&#8217;s insistence in this verse too. He is asking everybody to look at the planets which are visible at dawn and dusk, the stars, the planets, the moon all believed to be stationed in their respective layers of the 7 layered heaven</p>
<p>–Another blunder is that Moon is placed IN BETWEEN (in the midst of) these Layers. Another verse tells us that stars are in the lower heavens.. implying that moon is farther than the stars from us.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>My Response :</strong></p>
<p>Do you not consider how Allah has created seven heavens in layers.And made the moon therein a [reflected] light and made the sun a burning lamp?</p>
<p>-Surah Nuh (71:15-16)</p>
<p>Allah asks the modern human&#8217;s of today that don&#8217;t they consider how Allah has made all this. Regarding 7 heavens it has been refuted above. Noble Qur&#8217;an does not say that moon is in between the heavens , it says that Allah has made the moon in the heaven (notice the word therein ) so Agniveer&#8217;s statement implying that moon is farther than the stars from us. falls apart.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Agniveer :</strong></p>
<blockquote class="quote-light"><p>Another big hole in this argument is that it ties Nur with Moon. Aryabhatta told us 100 years before Quran that ALL PLANETS reflect sun light. Earth is also a Nur (borrowing Dr. Naik innovative translation) when looked from the Moon. [Ask Rakesh Sharma or Neil Armstrong. Better use Google].</p></blockquote>
<p>My Response :</p>
<p>Is this an argument ? Does the Noble Qur&#8217;an deny that the Earth reflects light ?</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>The Holy Quran differentiates between the sunlight and moonlight.</p>
<p>In the words of Dr.Zakir Naik</p>
<p>&#8220;The Arabic word for Sun is &#8216;Shams&#8217;. It&#8217;s always described either as &#8216;Siraj&#8217; meaning a torch, or &#8216;Wahaj&#8217; meaning a blazing lamp, or &#8216;Diya&#8217; – &#8216;meaning a shining glory&#8217;. The Moon – the Arabic word is &#8216;Qamar&#8217;. It&#8217;s always described as &#8216;Munir&#8217;, meaning borrowed light or &#8216;Noor&#8217;, which is a reflection of light.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nowhere in the entire Quran is &#8220;munir&#8221; or &#8220;noor&#8221; used for something that emanates light or something that has its own light.</p>
<p>Muhammad Asad the famous translator and commentator explains:</p>
<p>&#8220;He is is who has made the sun a [source language=&#8221;of&#8221;][/source] radiant light and the moon a light [reflected]&#8221; (Quran 10:5)</p>
<p>Footnote #10</p>
<p>&#8220;The nouns diya and nur are often interchangeable, inasmuch as both denote &#8220;light&#8221;; but many philologists are of the opinion that the term diya (or daw&#8217;) has a more intensive connotation, and is used to describe &#8220;a light which subsists by itself, as that of the sun and fire&#8221; – that is , a source of light- while nur signifies &#8220;a light that subsists by some other thing&#8221; (Lane V, 1809, of the authority of Taj al-Arus): in other words, light due to an extraneous source or – as in the case of the moon – reflected light&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Still if one doesn&#8217;t agree I want to know why is there not one place in the Holy Quran where moonlight is described as Siraj&#8217; meaning a torch, or &#8216;Wahaj&#8217; meaning a blazing lamp, or &#8216;Diya&#8217; – &#8216;meaning a shining glory&#8217;??</p>
<p>Why is there not a single place where sunlight is described as &#8220;munir&#8221; or &#8221; noor&#8221;??</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reason is that the author of the Quran who is the All-Knowing Creator of this universe knows the difference between the two lights.</p>
<p>The above explanation is sufficient to prove that the light of the moon is not its own light but it&#8217;s reflected light.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:black;">Written by Abd al Muhsin al Ilaahbaad al Hindy<br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:black;"><strong>Quote: To explore the practical aspects of Islam further, we shall now review what Islam – through Hadiths (practical handbooks of Islam, belief in which is necessary to secure Heaven) instruct on hygienic practices. The choice is readers&#8217; whether they want to embrace this practicality or pray to remain impractical forever! I believe Islamic Research Foundation can shed some light on these areas of research which baffle the sensibility of any civilized human being.</strong></span><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:black;"><strong>(Most of these Hadiths explain everything themselves, we shall only comment in very few places, wherever necessary. As usual, they are lifted straight from Islamic sources with no modifications)</strong></span><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> <span id="more-595"></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:black;">Well, his<em>(Agniveer)</em> epilogue , is quite deceiving to be concise, he claims to provide unmodified Islamic information<em>(claims mainly Hadeeth)</em> , which is pretty false, as throught out the article he, has many times not provided any quote ,but just cited a reference, and on it has built his concocted and far-fetched, irrational views and claims.Also , his quotation from inauthentic,fabricated sources will be evident later , in this article, Inshaa&#8217;Allah.Also we&#8217;ll see the so-called <em>&#8220;impracticality&#8221;</em> of Islam, and have a brief look at the <em>&#8220;practicality&#8221;</em> of Vedic Dharma<em>(Hinduism).</em> This article will try and shed light on the various issues.</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:black;">Lastly I would have used both Scriptures from the Orthodox Hindus and from the Protestant Hindus<em>(so-called Arya Samajis)</em><br />
<span style="text-decoration:underline;">For instance , Manu Smriti/Manava Dharma Shastra<em>(with few interpolations)</em> is authoritative to Protestant Hindus , and Other Puranas,Smirits (Vishnu,Gautama..etc) are authoritative and holy according Orthodox Hindus, and Yajurveda Translation used is , of Protestant Hindu Interpretation</span>.I&#8217;ve tried to create a balance by using scriptures from both the camps , so as to shed some light for any Truth Seeker and also our general reader.Also , in quotes are the words of Agniveer, and elsewhere its stated as cited.</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:black;">Finally, I would like to ask people who are genuinely interested in Islam to browse through this website to learn about Islam –</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><a href="http:/www.islamreligion.com/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="color:blue;font-family:Times New Roman;text-decoration:underline;">www.islamreligion.com</span></a><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:black;"><strong>Now coming back to the topic and to proceed:</strong></span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:black;">Firstly the article is too caddish and impertinent which is the usual manner of Islamophobes like Agniveer and his loony-toon company , also this article hardly needs a refutation , as these so-called arguments prove nothing but the evil, deceiving, lying face of Protestant Hindus <em>[the self-claimed &#8220;Noble&#8221; (Arya) Samajis]</em>.Again as we all know that he is<em>(Agniveer)</em> &#8220;big&#8221; plagiarist this article to is adapted and mostly copied from Abul Qasems&#8217; <em>(an Islamophobe)</em> useless articles.</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:black;"><span style="font-size:12pt;">In the whole article Agniveer seems to be obsessed by the fact that Prophet Muhammad <em>(Sallal lahu Alayhi wa Sallam )</em>was Noblest Human ever and his followers held him so high that they even took his sweat and used it with perfumes as it had beautiful and very good fragrance and this indeed was a miracle , which people during his time witnessed.I think Agniveer is quite obsessed with the High rank Prophet Muhammad <em>(Salall lahu alayhi wa Sallam)</em> was provided by the Allâh</span> Almighty<em>(One True God)</em> and the reverence, people had for him.</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:black;">Now scrutinizing the article a bit exposes Agniveer and his deception ! I wonder who can he fool? As every Muslim knows , the importance Islam lays on Hygiene cleanliness , and purity. Agniveer and his article are only helpful to the blind followers like Protestant Hindus <em>(so-called Arya Samajis)</em> knowing the fact that hardly they know truth and nor they try to seek it.</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:black;"><strong>Quote: 1.Muhammad ordered his followers to drink the water which he rinsed his mouth wit!h</strong></span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:black;">Sahih Bukhari (1.187)</span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:black;">Narrated Abu Juhaifa: Allah&#8217;s Apostle came to us at noon and water for ablution (cleaning body) was brought to him. After he had performed ablution, the remaining water was taken by the people and they started smearing their bodies with it (as a blessed thing). The Prophet offered two rak`at of the Zuhr prayer and then two rak`at of the `Asr prayer while a short spear (or stick) was there (as a Sutra) in front of him. Abu Musa said: The Prophet asked for a tumbler containing water and washed both his hands and face in it and then <strong>threw a mouthful of water in the tumbler and said to both of us (Abu Musa and Bilal), &#8220;Drink from the tumbler and pour some of its water on your faces and chests.&#8221;</strong></span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;font-family:Times New Roman;">The Hadeeth quoted by Agniveer is quite clear and shows the reverence the Muslims had toward the Prophet Muhammad(Sallal lahu Alayhi wa Sallam).Now Agniveer exposes his sheer deception when he says<span style="color:red;"> &#8220;Muhammad ordered his followers to drink the water which he rinsed his mouth with&#8221;</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;font-family:Times New Roman;">The Hadeeth is clear that Prophet<span style="color:#666666;"> <span style="color:blue;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>&#8220;threw a mouthful of water in the tumbler&#8221;</strong></span><span style="color:#666666;"> <span style="color:black;">now , how do we throw a mouthful of water? Of course with Hands ! Nowhere does the Hadeeth talk of rinsing his mouth! Nowhere does Hadeeth say that Prophet spat the water in the tumbler, what the beloved prophet did was he threw extra water which he had in his hand, in tumbler which was a mouthful of amount , and the reasons for it are quite clear :</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:black;">1) Avoiding wastage of water and extravagant use of it.<br />
2) Arabia was and is a desert peninsula ,where people hardly had water to drink and in such times wasting water could be dangerous and regretful later.</span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:black;">Also the point should be noted that the people were very eager to use the water that Prophet Muhammad used . As this is quite noticeable from the Hadeeth. The people were eager to use the water from the tumbler which the Prophet had used for ablution. Which only proves the high esteem the Prophet of Mercy was held in by those who at first were thirsty of his blood and later embraced Islam and believe in him, this is the love the believers had for him as we all know the great miracles that were provided to him which were witnessed by these people.</span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt;"><strong>Quote: To prove his divine authority, Muhammad even let a sick boy drink the leftover water after he had performed ablution (Sahih Bukhari, 1.4.189).</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt;"><strong><br />
Another boy drank the leftover water/milk that Muhammad had drunk (Sahih Bukhari, 3.40.541, 554)As per Sahih Bukhari, Prophet&#8217;s spit after mouthwash, and water that remained after his cleaning of all body parts, had miraculous properties.</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">It&#8217;s really shameful even to see Agniveer , lying and twisting Hadeeth to deviate and fool people , above he alleges Prophet Muhammad to have <span style="color:red;">&#8220;let a sick boy&#8221;<span style="color:black;"> (Sa&#8217;ib) drink the so-called <span style="color:red;"><em>&#8220;leftover&#8221;</em><span style="color:black;"> water<em>(which was not leftover but the remaining water in the vessel from which Prophet drew some water to perform his ablution)</em> but as we read the full hadeeth the truth is crystal clear to us. Did the Prophet do so? Of course not, as the sick boy(Sa&#8217;ib) himself said<span style="font-size:12pt;"> &#8220;</span></span></span></span></span></span><span style="color:#7030a0;"><span style="font-family:Bookman Old Style;font-size:12pt;">then he(Prophet) performed ablution and I drank from the remaining water. <span style="color:#e36c0a;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">I stood behind him</span><span style="color:#7030a0;"> and saw the seal of Prophethood between his shoulders&#8221;</span></span></span><span style="color:black;font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt;">  </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:black;">The boy drank the remaining water in the vessel from which the prophet had drawn little water to perform his ablution, and while he <em>(Sa&#8217;ib the sick boy )</em>was drinking the water he was behind the Prophets back and the holy Prophet was busy praying. So what does this prove , it&#8217;s clear <span style="text-decoration:underline;">it proves that the water was not <em>&#8220;leftover&#8221;</em> but remaining water of the vessel from which Prophet had taken out some to perform his ablution</span> and while the sick boy drank the water from this vessel <span style="text-decoration:underline;">he was standing right back of Prophet and the prophet was busy praying</span>. This again proves the lying and twisting nature of Islamophobes. And anyone who reads the hadeeth in full will clearly see the deception of the claimant; hence Agniveer didn&#8217;t provide the full hadeeth, as this would expose him and his lies.</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:black;">Coming to the another two hadeeth which Agniveer has cited (i.e. Sahih Bukhari, 3.40.541, 554), both the hadeeth are quoted completely below.</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:51pt;"><span style="color:purple;font-family:Bookman Old Style;">Narrated Sahl bin Sa`d: A tumbler (full of milk or water) was brought to the Prophet who drank from it, while on his right side there was sitting a boy who was the youngest of those who were present and on his left side there were old men. The Prophet asked, &#8220;O boy, will you allow me to give it (i.e. the rest of the drink) to the old men?&#8221; The boy said, &#8220;O <span style="font-size:12pt;">Allâh</span>&#8216;s Apostle! I will not give preference to anyone over me to drink the rest of it from which you have drunk.&#8221; So, the Prophet gave it to him<span style="font-size:10pt;">. </span></span><span style="color:black;font-family:Garamond;font-size:9pt;">&#8211; (Saheeh al Bukhari , 3:40:541)</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:black;">And ,</span><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:51pt;"><span style="color:purple;font-family:Bookman Old Style;">Narrated Sahl bin Sa`d: Once a tumbler (full of milk or water)was brought to <span style="font-size:12pt;">Allâh</span>&#8216;s Apostle who drank from it, while on his right side there was sitting a boy who was the youngest of those who were present, and on his left side there were old men. The Prophet asked, &#8220;O boy ! Do you allow me to give (the drink) to the elder people (first)?&#8221; The boy said, &#8220;I will not prefer anybody to have my share from you, O <span style="font-size:12pt;">Allâh</span>&#8216;s Apostle!&#8221; So, he gave it to the boy.</span><span style="color:#7030a0;"> <span style="color:black;font-family:Garamond;font-size:9pt;">&#8211; (Saheeh al Bukhari , 3:40:554)</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:black;">As we can see both the Hadeeth are approximately same &#8211; ditto with same meaning with little variation in words. Now coming to the deception of Agniveer, we can see that the Hadeeth talks of a tumbler containing milk or water , which the prophet intended to give to the elder people who were seated to the left of the tumbler, so what this proves is the respect, love and mercy which prophet held for the Old and the love of kids for their Prophet. Also this Hadeeth proves how Islam bridges gap between generations and the rich and poor, the prophet gave the from the same tumbler from which drink he drank to those who were present there and the Kid was eager to take this drink as he knew the holiness of a drink by the hand of the Prophet, so did the others knew.</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:black;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Again, now we shall analyze distortion,twists and spins used by Agniveer to fool people, he wrote <span style="color:red;">&#8220;</span></span><span style="font-family:Verdana;">Another boy drank the leftover water/milk that Muhammad had drunk&#8221; </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">now again here he is trying to make the Prophet of Mercy as a <em>&#8220;tyrant&#8221;</em> asked people to consume his leftovers, but as we read that Prophet took his drink – water/milk ,from the tumbler and then passed it to other people so that they too could benefit from it, and this is what is called <strong>&#8220;Sharing&#8221;</strong>, and <strong>&#8220;love&#8221;</strong> for all people, which Islam preaches and this is totally alien to Agniveer , as it seems.</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:black;">So a question arises, <strong>&#8220;Is it wrong to share a drink from the same tumbler ?&#8221; </strong>Especially when you&#8217;re living in a Desert where one hardly has a few drops of water to drink ! </span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:black;">Concisely this hadeeth only proves , Islam and its equality and encouragement for sharing resources and increasing love between people, I am pretty sure that Agniveer will hardly contemplate this Hadeeth as these qualities are alien to him and his <strong>&#8220;Vedic Dharma.&#8221;</strong></span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;font-family:Garamond;font-size:14pt;text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Now let&#8217;s briefly see what do the <em>&#8220;Holy&#8221;</em> Dharma Shastras <em>(Hindu Law Books) </em>which the &#8220;Great&#8221; Hindu Sages like Parashar et al . conveyed to the Hindus and derived from the <em>&#8220;Holy&#8221;</em> Vedas! :::</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:51pt;"><span style="color:black;"><span style="font-family:Bookman Old Style;font-size:10pt;">&#8220;To eat a Shoodra&#8217;s food<span style="color:#f79646;">, <span style="color:red;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>to associate with him, to sit in the same place with, him, and receive knowledge by his instruction, would cause degradation</strong></span><span style="color:#f79646;"><br />
<span style="color:black;">even to one who resembles the kindled fire.&#8221;</span></span></span></span></span> <span style="color:black;font-family:Garamond;font-size:10pt;">( <strong>Parashara Smriti</strong> ,Ch 12 verse 34)</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:black;">I think these verse (laws) prove a lot of things to the Hindus, I think it also exposes their , discrimination toward , varying fractions of society<em>( the so-called Shudras)</em>. So I do not expect Agniveer to stand out for <strong>&#8220;equality&#8221;</strong>, <strong>&#8220;Sharing&#8221;</strong><br />
<strong>&#8220;Brotherly love&#8221; &#8220;Humanity&#8221;</strong> ..etc. when his <em>&#8220;great&#8221;</em> Vedic predecessors who are stilled revered by these Hindus as <em>&#8220;Sages&#8221;</em> were just the opposite, and so was their so-called <em>&#8220;great Vedic civilization&#8221;.</em></span><span style="font-size:12pt;"></p>
<p></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:black;"><strong><em>Quote: Comment: Could not the Prophet find more civilized way of blessing and treating people than providing them his excreta?

</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:black;">Here , Agniveer tries to promulugate , that <em>&#8220;Vedic Dharma&#8221;</em> is more civilized than the Only True Religion/Way of Life – Islam, we shall Inshaa&#8217;Allah, verify these claims and scrutinize it to show the people , so that the people may see and contemplate the truth.Futher , in the article, these pompous claims are verified in the light of truth, with facts and not just talk and useless, rhetoric.Also, we shall expose the truth , about </span><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:black;">the religion, which propagates drinking, excreta and using it, and praising it , as though it&#8217;s a potion of immortality.</span><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:black;">He<em>(Agniveer)</em> claims , Vedic Dharma conforms to the highest standard of Hygiene and considers that only wretched people use such <em>&#8216;Jootha'(i.e. &#8216;dirty water&#8217; , as written by hm)</em> !Let&#8217;s examine his claims and scrutinize it. A little , scrutiny will, reveal the truth and expose the agendas, propagandas against Islam.</span><br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:black;font-family:Garamond;font-size:14pt;"><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Exposing the Lie of <em>&#8220;Drinking&#8221;</em> and <em>&#8220;Using&#8221;</em> the <span style="color:red;">leftover water <span style="color:black;">in Islam</span></span></span> &#8211;</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:black;"><strong>Is it permissible in Islam to use the leftover water</strong> ? Or did the Prophet of Mercy Muhammad <em>(Sallal lahu alayhi wa Sallam)</em> permitted use of the leftover water ?</span><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:black;">Well , lets see what the Prophet of Mercy himself said about such water in the following hadeeth.</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:center;margin-left:31pt;"><span style="color:black;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">A Man who accompanied the Prophet <em>(Sallal lahu alayhi wa Sallam)</em> narrated that <span style="color:purple;">&#8221; The Messenger of Allâh ,<span style="color:red;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>forbade</strong></span><span style="color:purple;"> that a woman should wash by the water <strong>leftover</strong> by the man, or that a man should wash with the water <strong>leftover </strong>by the woman.&#8221; </span></span></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:black;font-size:8pt;">[Abu Dawud, An-Nasaii and Bulughul Maram min Adillat al-Ahkam , Book 1, no. 9]</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:black;">What we read above is a clear statement of the Prophet , prohibiting the usage of leftover water, I guess this should totally expose those who alleged prophet of making people drink, and use leftover water.</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:black;">We see the , truth of vedic liars and their concocted claims about Islam, which only <span style="text-decoration:underline;">blind followers</span> of Vedic Dharma<em>(Hinduism)</em> and none else can accept.Now its time to scrutinise the Hindu scriptures and see how hygienic they are and what do they mean by cleanliness and purity.</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:black;">The penance for Drinking Spiritual liquor ,according to the Manu Shastra/Smriti<em>(one of the most authentic Hindu Law Book)</em>:</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff6600;"><span style="font-family:Bookman Old Style;font-size:10pt;">&#8220;A twice-born man who has (intentionally) drunk, through delusion of mind, (the spirituous liquor called) Sura shall drink that liquor boiling-hot; when his body has been completely scalded by that, he is freed from his guilt;<span style="color:#ff9900;"> <span style="color:red;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Or he may <span style="color:green;">drink<span style="color:red;"> cow&#8217;s urine</span></span></strong></span><span style="color:#ff6600;">, water, milk, clarified butter or<span style="color:#ff9900;"> <span style="color:red;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>(liquid) cowdung boiling-hot</strong></span><span style="color:#ff6600;">, until<span style="color:#ff9900;"> <span style="color:#ff6600;">he dies;&#8221; </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span style="color:black;"><span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:10pt;">( The Laws of Manu, Ch 11 verses 91-92, Translated by George Bühler)</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:black;">Here the Twice-Born man refers to any human of the first three caste of hindu caste System.So drinking of Urine, Cowdung or Ordure is praiseworthy and a way to get rid of sins, amazing isn&#8217;t it?</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:black;font-family:Times New Roman;">Another Type of Penance is Samtapana Krikkhra wherein you eat and sustain on <span style="color:green;"><strong>&#8220;Excreta&#8221;</strong><span style="color:black;"> &#8211;</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:red;"><span style="font-family:Bookman Old Style;font-size:10pt;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>&#8220;<span style="color:green;">(Subsisting on) <span style="color:red;">the urine of cows, cowdung</span></span></strong></span><span style="color:#ff6600;">, milk, sour milk (yogurt), clarified butter, and a decoction of Kusa-grass, and fasting during one (day and) night, (that is) called a Samtapana Krikkhra.&#8221;</span></span></span><span style="color:black;"> <span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:10pt;">( The Laws of Manu, Ch 11 verse 213, Translated by George Bühler)</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:black;">Also this has been promoted in Vaishnava DharmaShastra/Sutras commonly known as Vishnu Smriti –</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="margin-left:14pt;"><span style="color:#ff6600;"><span style="font-family:Bookman Old Style;font-size:10pt;">&#8220;A Sudra (who has eaten the food) of another Sudra , while the latter was impure, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">must bathe (in a river) and <span style="color:green;">drink</span></span><span style="color:#ff6600;"><br />
<span style="color:red;"><strong>Pankagavya</strong><span style="color:#ff6600;">.&#8221;</span></span></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:black;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><strong>Note</strong> : The <em>&#8220;Pankagavya&#8221;</em>, or five productions of a cow, consist of milk, sour milk, butter, <span style="color:red;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">urine, and cow-dung</span><span style="color:black;">.<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></span></span><span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:10pt;">&#8211; [ Vishnu Smriti Ch 22, verse 18, pg 89, Translated by Julius Jolly ,Oxford , Clarendon Press , 1880]</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:black;">So what we learn is, its not Islam that has been calling people to eat, drink and sustain on <strong>&#8220;Excreta&#8221;</strong> as alleged by ill-intentioned lying hindus , but it&#8217;s the so-called &#8220;Holy&#8221; Vedic Dharma<em>(Hinduism)</em> which calls to eating and drinking of <strong>Excreta</strong>.And there are more verses like such where hindus are ordered to eat , and drink excreta, but I guess this shall suffice the truth seeker and expose the lies against the only true way of Life , that&#8217;s Islam.Inshaa&#8217;Allah we&#8217;ll see a lot more verses on cleanliness, hygiene and purification found in Hindu Scriptures which will help us understand what these terms mean in Hinduism.</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:black;"><strong>Quote: Let us explore this Science of Islam and Hygiene from the original texts</strong>:</span><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:black;">Agniveer writes about exploring Science of Islam and HYGIENE but his I mpertinent, imbecilic article proves , that he has been copying from his <strong><em>&#8221; Idols&#8217; &#8220;</em></strong> websites that are Christian missionary and Islamophobes and he too is a wannabee Islamphobe.

</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:black;"> I would like to take this as an opportunity to educate people about Islamic stance on cleanliness, hygience, purity, manners which will surely expose the deceiving face of Islamophobes and their lying nature of Islamophobes et al.</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:black;"><span style="font-size:12pt;">Let&#8217;s see what Islam teaches of hygiene, purity and cleanliness. Islam is a religion of cleanliness and hygiene unlike other pagan and human-invented religions like Sanatan Dharma<em>(Hinduism , Protestant Hinduism et al.)</em>, Christianity…etc. Islam stressed on cleanliness and hygiene very much as Allâh</span> the Most High says:</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:green;"><span style="font-family:Garamond;"><span style="font-size:12pt;"><strong>&#8220;Truly, Allâh loves those who turn unto Him in repentance<span style="color:yellowgreen;"><br />
<span style="color:red;">and <span style="text-decoration:underline;">loves those who purify themselves </span><span style="color:green;">(by taking a bath and cleaning and washing thoroughly their private parts, bodies, for their prayers, etc.).&#8221;</span></span></span></strong><span style="color:#666666;"> </span></span><span style="color:black;font-size:9pt;">(2:222)</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:green;"><span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:12pt;"><strong>&#8220;Never stand you therein. Verily, the mosque whose foundation was laid from the first day on piety is more worthy that you stand therein (to pray). In it are men who l ove to clean and to purify themselves.<span style="color:yellowgreen;"> <span style="color:red;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">And Allâh loves those who make themselves clean and pure</span><span style="color:yellowgreen;">  <span style="color:green;">(i.e. who clean their private parts with dust (i.e. to be considered as soap) and water from urine and stools, after answering the call of nature).&#8221;</span></span></span></span></strong></span><span style="color:#666666;"><span style="font-family:Bookman Old Style;font-size:10pt;"><strong> </strong></span><span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:9pt;">(9:108)</span><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt;"><br />
</span><span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:12pt;"><br />
<span style="color:red;"><strong>&#8220;<span style="text-decoration:underline;">O you who believe! When you rise up for prayer, wash your faces, and your hands up to the elbows, and wipe your heads (with wet hands), and (wash) your feet up to the ankles. And if you are in a state of major ritual  impurity (janaba), purify yourselves (by taking a bath)<span style="color:green;">.</span></span> <span style="color:green;">And if you are sick or on a journey, or one of you comes from the answering of call of nature, or you have had contact with women, and you find no water, then go to clean earth and wipe your faces and hands with some of it. Allâh does not want to place you in difficulty, but He wants to purify you and to perfect His grace upon you that you may give thanks.&#8221;</span></strong></span></span><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt;"> </span><span style="color:black;font-family:Garamond;font-size:9pt;">(5:6)</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:black;">These above quoted Holy Qur&#8217;anic verse state that <span style="font-size:12pt;">Allâh</span> the Most Merciful loves purity and those who purify themselves and those who are hygienic, these verses are enough to disprove any void/baseless allegations like Agniveer has alleged Islam with nonetheless as said earlier this will be taken as an opportunity to educate and teach people , about the cleanliness, purity, hygiene in Islam.Agniveer has hardly tried to research the subject or delved into Islamic literature to learn and read about Prophet Muhammad&#8217;s <em>(Sallal lahu Alayhi wa Sallam)</em> sayings and stance on cleanliness and hygiene which is clearly observable from his incoherent and deceptive article. Now we shall learn and contemplate Prophet&#8217;s words and stance on the subject.</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />

<p style="margin-left:51pt;"><span style="color:black;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">Narrated <span style="color:blue;">Abû Mâlik al-Hârith bin Âsim al-Ash&#8217;ari<span style="color:#444444;">: <span style="color:black;">Allâh<span style="color:#444444;">&#8216;s <span style="color:black;">Messenger said,</span></span></span></span></span></span><span style="color:#444444;"><span style="font-family:Georgia;font-size:12pt;"><br />

</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:black;">Purification or cleanliness is considered an inseparable part of faith in Islam and I believe this single hadeeth of the Prophet of mercy Muhammad <em>(Sallal lahu Alayhi wa Sallam)</em> rebuts all the lies concocted against him on the issue of hygiene and cleanliness, as we read above that in Islam cleanliness is half of faith , that is if you are clean and hygienic its as if you have acquitted half of faith, and as we see that this hadeeth is been recorded in Saheeh Muslim which Agniveer quotes extensively to promulgate his concocted lies , but fails to provide this hadeeth this exposes him and his false lies , agendas against Islam in full.</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:black;">Inshaa&#8217;Allah we&#8217;ll delve deep into this issue to show people the true Islamic stance on the subject.</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:black;">None of the prayers, are valid in Islam until and unless you are pefectly, pure.And as our beloved Prophet said that he disliked even taking the name of <span style="font-size:12pt;">Allâh</span> Azz wa Jall , while he was defiled or impure, this should clear all the misconceptions and concocted lies against the Prophet of mercy Muhammad <em>(Sallal lahu alayhi wa Sallam).</em></span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />

<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:51pt;"><span style="color:black;"><span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:12pt;">And <span style="color:blue;">Al-Mughirah Ibn Shu&#8217;bah<span style="color:black;"> reported</span></span></span><span style="color:#8064a2;"><span style="font-family:Bookman Old Style;"><span style="font-size:12pt;">; <span style="color:purple;"><strong>&#8220;Whoever has eaten from this malignant tree, should not approach our mosque until its smell completely vanishes</strong></span></span><span style="font-size:8pt;"><strong>.&#8221;</strong></span></span><span style="color:purple;"><span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:8pt;"><br />

</span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:black;">These Hadiths rebukes those who eat these raw legumes and threaten to exclude him from approaching the mosques. Lastly, cleanliness and pleasant appearance are of characteristics which allow relationships to strengthen amongst people. The sane human being will try to avoid people who are unkempt. Hence, the Prophet emphasized the importance of cleanliness , hygiene and purity. Similarly, there is a prohibition on eating garlic, onion, leek and food like it, before going to the mosque in order not to disturb others from the strong odor. If one insists on eating them, then he is not permitted to enter the mosque and is deprived of the congregational Prayer.</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:black;">Now proving some more points relating to cleanliness and hygiene which many non-muslim still fail to implement.</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><strong>Quote: 2. Islamic saliva and Muhammad&#8217;s Tongue!</strong><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">a. Muhammad used his saliva to soften a date, and then gave it to an infant to suck. (Sahih Muslim, 25.5340, 5341, 5345)<br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">b. When Anas&#8217;s son was born, Muhammad fed him with dates mixed with his (Muhammad&#8217;s) saliva and gave him the name Abdullah. (Sahih Muslim, 31.6013)<br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">c. Bukhari Volume 1, Book 4, Number 188:<br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">Narrated Ibn Shihab: Mahmud bin Ar-Rabi&#8217; who was the person on whose face the Prophet had ejected a mouthful of water from his family&#8217;s well while he was a boy, and &#8216;Urwa (on the authority of Al-Miswar and others) who testified each other, said, &#8220;Whenever the Prophet , performed ablution, his companions were nearly fighting for the remains of the water.&#8221;<br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
d. Muhammad&#8217;s saliva is good for children. He used to spit into the mouth of suckling children, and his saliva would satisfy them until nightfall. (Ash Shifa, p.184)<br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:red;font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt;"><br />
</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">e. <strong>If a baby sucked Muhammad&#8217;s tongue</strong>, the baby became quiet. (Ash Shifa, p.184)<br />

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:red;font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt;"><br />
</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">f. He gave al Hasan and al Husayn <strong>his tongue to suck</strong>. They had been weeping from thirst and upon sucking Muhammad&#8217;s tongue they became quiet. (Ash Shifa, p.184)<br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
g. <strong>People rubbed Muhammad&#8217;s spittle on their faces</strong>. (Ash Shifa, p.237)<br />
h. Muhammad recommended <strong>that you can spit on your cloth and then fold it and rub it. </strong>(Sahih Muslim, 4.1121)<br />
</span></p>

I. Spit three times to the left when someone questions who created Allah. (ibn Ishaq, p.270)<br />

<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:black;">j. Prophet spat on his clothes (Bukhari 1.4.242)</span><br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:black;">Inshaa&#8217;Allah, these conjectures and concocted claims will be refuted in full, to proceed :</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:black;font-family:Times New Roman;">The ahadeeth <span style="color:purple;"><em>(Saheeh Muslim, Book 25, ahadeeth 5340 , 5341,5345</em>) <span style="color:black;">quoted in point (<span style="color:red;">a<span style="color:black;">) only shows , how <strong>merciful</strong>,<strong>humble</strong> and <strong>ever-helpful</strong> Prophet Muhammad was, he even helped <span style="text-decoration:underline;">people in taking care of their children</span>, ,and with regards to chewing dates to soften them, so that a newly born child can eat it then , I don&#8217;t find any reason for any criticism, infact it&#8217;s a sign of mercy and love towards children.And this was also a norm which was followed then, and this is even done throught out the world, as this helps the child chew and digest the food , easily.</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:black;">These cited ahadeeth ,are infact prooving, the Islam, and the Prophet of Mercy&#8217;s love and care towards children, and his striving to provide them , the best in his capabilities.</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:black;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Now coming to the point (<span style="color:red;">b<span style="color:black;">) where Agniveer intentionally tries to deceive people by writing <span style="color:red;">&#8220;</span></span></span></span><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt;">When Anas&#8217;s son was born, <span style="color:red;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Muhammad fed him with dates mixed with his (Muhammad&#8217;s) saliva</span> and gave him the name Abdullah.&#8221;</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:black;">Let me quote excerpt of the Hadeeth to reveal his deception :</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:17pt;"><span style="color:purple;font-family:Bookman Old Style;font-size:10pt;">I<em>(Abu Talha , father of the child)</em> brought that child to him and placed it in his lap and Allâh&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) asked Ajwa dates of Medina to be brought and softened them in his month. When these had become palatable he placed them in the mouth of that child. The child began to taste them. Then Allâh&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: See what love the Ansar have for dates. He then wiped his face and named him &#8216;Abdullah.&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:black;font-family:Times New Roman;">Here again ,just as in the ahadeeth cited in point (<span style="color:red;">a<span style="color:black;">),Prophet Muhammad<em>(Sallal lahu Alayhi wa Sallam)</em> chewed the date so ,that it would be easier on the newlyborn child to consume them, nowhere does the hadeeth says that &#8220;<span style="color:red;">Muhammad fed him with dates mixed with his (Muhammad&#8217;s) saliva&#8221; <span style="color:black;">as implied by Agniveer, this is just another trick to deviate people , so its clear that Prophet Muhammad did not feed his Saliva to the child as claimed and hence he(Agniveer) made a new point for this single hadeeth just to fool people, when this hadeeth is same like the ones cited in point (<span style="color:red;">a<span style="color:black;">).</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:black;">And , Prophet Muhammad was indeed the most generous and merciful man , and this is what is well-know :</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:8pt;"><span style="color:purple;font-family:Bookman Old Style;font-size:10pt;">Abu Hurayra said, &#8220;When the Messenger of Allâh, may Allâh bless him and grant him peace, was brought new dates, he said, &#8216;O Allâh! Bless us in our city and in our mudd and sa&#8217; (units of measure) , blessing upon blessing.<span style="text-decoration:underline;">&#8216; Then he would give one to the youngest of the children with him</span>.&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:black;">This was our Prophet the most genrous man and the most kind too.These are the few chracterstics from him, which are enough to reveal the decption of polemics et al.</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:black;font-family:Times New Roman;">The Hadeeth <span style="color:purple;">(<em>i.e. Bukhari Vol 1, Book 4, Number 188 )</em><span style="color:#666666;"><br />
<span style="color:black;">quoted in point (<span style="color:red;">c<span style="color:black;">) is just repeated again , this was quoted earlier in the article, the hadeeth is as follow :</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left:11pt;"><span style="color:#333399;"><span style="font-family:Bookman Old Style;font-size:10pt;">Narrated Ibn Shihab: Mahmud bin Ar-Rabi&#8217; who was the person on whose face the Prophet had ejected a mouthful of water from his family&#8217;s well while he was a boy, and &#8216;Urwa (on the authority of Al-Miswar and others) who testified each other, said, &#8220;Whenever the Prophet , performed ablution, his companions were nearly fighting for the remains of the water.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:black;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">The hadeeth just talks about prophet ejecting a mouthful amount of water on the face of the boy<em>(Mahmud)</em> from his own<em>(Mahmud)</em> family&#8217;s well, and the reasons are not<span style="font-size:12pt;"> know , most </span>probably its was the boy&#8217;s own request , hence the narrators quoted al-Miswar and others who said <span style="color:#333399;">&#8220;</span></span><span style="font-family:Bookman Old Style;">Whenever the Prophet , performed ablution, his companions were nearly fighting for the remains of the water.&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"> As every one wanted the prophet of mercy to do something for him, and requested them to full fill their wish.And as we believe and is well-known about his miracles , this water too was of miraculous nature, unlike the usual water or dirty water. So what is apparent is that the boy himself may have request the prophet of mercy Muhammad <em>(Sallal lahu Alayhi wa Sallam)</em> to eject the water on his face so that he may be blessed.And we also learn that the water remaining in any tumbler,vessel or otherwise was fought over by the companions for its acquistion, as the Prophet was miraculous and his miracles were well know in both Muslim and non-Muslim circles.</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:black;">Now let&#8217;s have a brief look at the Hindu Scriptures and their love for hygience and cleanliness , which has been practices for centuries in India by Hindus.</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="margin-left:14pt;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:black;">The Upa-Purana says :</span></span><span style="color:#ff6600;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><em><br />
</em></span><span style="font-family:Bookman Old Style;font-size:10pt;">&#8220;Narayana said :—&#8221; O Narada! I am now talking of the three kinds of ashes ;<span style="color:red;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>hearing this even destroys one&#8217;s sins and brings in good fame. When a cow evacuates her dung ,just as the cow dang leaves her and is far from reaching the ground, one should catch it with one&#8217;s hand</strong></span><span style="color:#ff6600;"> and this cowdung burnt with &#8220;Sadyojatadi i.e. Brahma Mantra&#8221; becomes ashes which are called &#8220;Santika Bhasma,&#8221; i.e. <span style="color:red;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">ashes producing peace</span><span style="color:#ff6600;">. <span style="color:red;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Before the cowdung is about to reach the ground, the devotee should take it with his hand and uttering the six lettered Mantra</span><span style="color:#ff6600;">, he is to burn the cowdung. The ashes from this are called &#8221; Paustik Bhasma<span style="color:red;">&#8221; <span style="text-decoration:underline;">i.e. ashes leading to nourishment</span>.<span style="color:#ff6600;"> If the cowdung be burned with the Mantra &#8220;Haum,&#8221; the ashes of this are called &#8220;Kamala Bhasma&#8221; i.e., <span style="color:red;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">ashes leading to the granting of desires</span><span style="color:#ff6600;">.&#8221; <sup>1</sup></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span style="color:black;font-size:9pt;"> <span style="font-family:Garamond;"><sup>&#8211; </sup> [Srimad Devi Bhagvatam,Book 11, Ch 11, pg 1081 , Translated by Swami Vijananda ,3<sup>rd</sup> Ed., Panini Office- Allahabad]</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:black;">So according to this Upa-Purana , <span style="text-decoration:underline;">hearing this text <em>(presented above) </em>destroys sins, and brings good fame</span>, also we read and learn about , <span style="text-decoration:underline;">catching cow-dung and its when various virtues when , burnt with chants<em>(vedic mantras)</em></span>, so why is it that the prophet&#8217;s used water cannot be miraculous?Also elsewhere it&#8217;s stated( in a Purana, below) –</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="margin-left:14pt;"><span style="color:#ff6600;"><span style="font-family:Bookman Old Style;font-size:10pt;">&#8221; The support of everything is this cow … and <span style="text-decoration:underline;">her horns are pious acts ; her hair the excellent words of the good ; <span style="color:red;"><strong>her ordure and urine are tranquillity and prosperity</strong></span></span><span style="color:#ff6600;">…&#8221;</span></span></span><span style="color:black;"><span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:9pt;"> [ Markandeya Purana, Canto 29 ,verses 7-8, pg 152, Translated by F.Eden Pargiter, Published by the Asiatic Society, 1904]</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:black;">The preceding , texts shows the reverence, and love of hindus for cow-ordure,urine and these this are infact <em>&#8220;tranquility&#8221;</em> and <em>&#8220;prosperity&#8221;</em> , so why is it that prophet&#8217;s water when fought over by his companions<em>(for it&#8217;s acquisiton) </em>, is criticised when these hindus indulge in vilest of all things and praise those<em>(dirty,filthy,natsty..etc.)</em> things?</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:black;">Also the <em>&#8220;Holy&#8221; </em>veda says : </span><br />

<p><span style="color:black;"><span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:14pt;text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Also see how Hindus are give <span style="color:green;">Protection<span style="color:black;"> and seek <span style="color:green;">Protection<span style="color:black;"> &#8211;</span></span></span></span></strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:black;">This is the way hindus protect their children, so where&#8217;s all the talk about Hygiene and cleanliness?</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><span style="font-family:Garamond;text-decoration:underline;"><strong><span style="font-size:14pt;">Hindu Gods (great sages and people etc., to Protestant Hindu)</span><span style="font-size:14pt;"> look <span style="color:green;"><em>&#8220;Beautiful&#8221;</em><span style="color:black;"> in Cow Dung and Cow-Urine !:</span></span></span></strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#ff6600;"><span style="font-family:Bookman Old Style;font-size:10pt;">&#8220;When Krsna and Balarama, with the strength of Their legs, crawled in the muddy places created in Vraja by cow dung and cow urine… <span style="color:red;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Dressed with muddy earth mixed with cow dung and cow urine, the babies looked very beautiful</strong></span><span style="color:#ff6600;">, and when They went to Their mothers, both Yasoda and Rohini picked Them up with great affection, embraced Them and allowed Them to suck the milk flowing from their breasts.&#8221; </span></span></span> <span style="color:black;font-family:Garamond;"><span style="font-size:9pt;">[ Srimad Bhagvatam , Canto 10, Ch 8, text&#8217;s 22-23, Translated by A.C. Bhaktivedanta Prabhupada, Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International]</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:black;font-family:Times New Roman;">What, I see is various, animals according to the vedas posses various, qualities which are higher in degree to them like cow has qualities of Sun! And in the verse quoted before this verse , cows are claimed to be <span style="color:red;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>protectors</strong></span><span style="color:black;"> of the heaven and the earth! Again , it&#8217;s strange that these people talk of science.Or is it that the Hindu God<em>(Ishwar)</em> does not know the qualities of various animals and hence indulges in gross exaggeration?</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:black;">Also, <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>when cows can posses qualities of sun</strong></span>, and <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>be protectors of earth and heaven</strong></span> then ,I question whats the problem , when the prophet&#8217;s water is regarded as miraculous <em>(infact its blessedand miraculous)</em>, or blessed, they caddishly make fun of it, when he<em>(Prophet Muhammad Sallal lahu alayhi wa sallam)</em> was the final messenger of the One True Almighty God <em>(<span style="font-size:12pt;">Allâh</span>)</em>, and was blessed and given various miracles.And the creatures which the Veda exaggerate about are mere animals!<em>(Though they have their own qualitites and specialities which they are loved and respected for.)</em></span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:black;">In the Hindu Scriptures cows, horses..etc<em>.(who are mere animals)</em> and their ordure are given qualities which they don&#8217;t posses and are blatantly claimed to be <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>protectors</strong></span> of us<em>(earth and heaven)</em>. Well , this is adequate, to prove how, hygienic, practical, scientific Vedic Dharma<em>(Hinduism)</em> is<em>.</em>Also , today I have learned that people can even look good , covered in Urine and Cow Dung, not good but beautiful, it is really amazing to read these verse which shed light on the meaning of Hygiene , cleanliness and purity in Hinduism, Oh! Also Beauty!</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:black;"> It&#8217;s hilarious to read these verses , as they are proof for the human origin of these books<em>(Vedas et al.)</em>.</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:black;font-family:Times New Roman;">Now the points (<span style="color:red;">d,e,f,g<span style="color:black;">) all are quote from the book of al-Qâdî `Iyâd , that&#8217;s Ash-Shifâ&#8217; and here&#8217;s what the Muslims Scholars have to say about the authenticity of the book.Though the book is known as good refernce for spirituality<em>(and other subjects)</em> as it contains good advises for those who seeking to increase their consciousness of <span style="font-size:12pt;">Allâh<em>(One True Almighty God)</em></span> the All-Knowledgeable and spirituality.The great Islamic Scholar on the authenticity of the hadeeth found in the book –</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:14pt;"><span style="color:#3366ff;font-family:Bookman Old Style;font-size:10pt;"><em>Imam Shams al-Dîn al-Dhahabî in his immense biographical encyclopedia entitled Siyar A`lâm al-Nubalâ&#8217;. In his biographical entry on al-Qâdî `Iyâd (20/212-216), he writes: <strong>&#8220;His writings are valuable and one of his best works would have been his book al-Shifâ&#8217; <span style="color:red;">had it not been <span style="text-decoration:underline;">filled with fabricated hadîth</span>.<span style="color:#3366ff;">&#8220;</span></span></strong> </em></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:black;">I think this clears the fog , and we find Agniveer using inauthentic, fabricated hadeeth, to promulugate, and insinuate his lies against the Prophet of mercy Muhammad <em>(Sallal lahu Alayhi wa Sallam)</em>.The Hadeeth need to be proven first, to be authentic and the citations he has provided comes from the book , famous for fabricated, false ahadeeth.This should suffice , and I hope Agniveer, cites some authentic ahadeeth.Citing fabrications,inauthentic hadeeth, false translations…etc are common traits of Islamophobes.</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:black;font-family:Times New Roman;">The point (<span style="color:red;">h<span style="color:black;">) , is again a clear deception where Agniveer only cites the refernces and provide&#8217;s not the full hadeeth <em>(i.e Saheeh Muslim, Book 4, no. 1121)</em>, as this will expose his concoted claims and this is also one of the method used when you are quoting out of context, and indeed this is what Agniveer has done here.The Hadeeth is recorded in the <strong>&#8220;Book of Prayers&#8221;</strong>(vol. 4) of Saheeh Muslim, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">in which ahadeeth pertaining to Prayer are recorded</span>, this should clear the mist a bit, now revealing the fact that prophet Muhammad in the hadeeth was talking of spitting while in the Mosque<em>(in the hadeeth cited)</em> , the hadeeth goes like this :</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:14pt;"><span style="color:purple;font-family:Bookman Old Style;font-size:10pt;">&#8220;Messenger of Allâh (may peace be upon him) saw some sputum in the direction of the Qibla of <span style="text-decoration:underline;">the mosque</span>. He turned towards people and said: How Is it that someone amongst you stands before his Lord… So when any one of you spits, he must spit on his left side under his foot. But if he does not find (space to spit) he should do like this. Qasim (one of the narrators) spat in his cloth and then folded it and rubbed it.&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:black;">So we see that the Prophet is talking of spitting in the mosques<em> (in those times the mosques didn&#8217;t have tiles, or stones on the floor , its was ground,sand and the land without any tiles)</em> so if anyone who wanted to spit then he should spit under his left feet as this would be absorbed and covered in the sand, and if he does not find space or the floor is tiled <em>(as its not premissible to spit)</em> he should spat in his cloth <em>(people in those day were poor and could not afford hankerchiefs, infact some were so poor that they hardly had dresses to wear, or water to drink) </em>and rub it so that it absorbs it.I think people forget that ,this was more than 1400 years , ago in a desert peninsula, where people hardly had drops of water to drink, grains to eat ,and clothes to wear.And this is well-know, still polemic&#8217;s try and concoct against truth.</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:black;font-family:Times New Roman;">Point (<span style="color:red;">i<span style="color:black;">) talks of Prophet of Mercy Muhammad&#8217;s <em>(Sallal lahu Alayhi wa Sallam) </em>saying of spitting three times to your left when some one insinuatingly and to make you doubt , questions you <span style="color:purple;"><em>&#8220;Well, it is Allâh Who created the creation, but who created Allâh?&#8221;</em><span style="color:black;"><br />
<em>(as the pagans of Arab used to ask this to Muslims )</em>. The Prophet of Mercy commanded us to say <span style="color:purple;">&#8220;I affirm my faith in <em>Allâh.&#8221;</em><span style="color:black;"><br />
<strong>Or/and</strong>, spit three times to your left to debase the evil satan which encourages humans to question such imbecilic , and irrational questions.And this spitting is not spitting but blowing a few wind/moist to your left, and this too only where one is allowed to spit , like spitting on road is prohibitted in countries like K.S.A, so you need not spit either say the <em>&#8220;Verse&#8221;(or Du&#8217;aa), </em>or blow wind<em>(spit-less)</em> to your left to show the crooked satan his foolishness and debase him , that he isn&#8217;t only worth spitting.So basically here spitting , means sputum or saliva-less air blowed from the mouth.This hadeeth only proves the hatred and dislike of Muslims and Prophet of mercy toward <em>&#8220;Falsehood&#8221;</em> and <em>&#8220;Satan&#8221;</em> .</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:black;font-family:Times New Roman;">Point (<span style="color:red;">j<span style="color:black;">) has been earlier explained and refuted and debunked it&#8217;s the same as point (<span style="color:red;">h<span style="color:black;">).</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />

The moment you get too charitable and start distributing your saliva to world around, it becomes a disgusting dirty practice that spreads disease.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:black;">Well, these words/comment&#8217;s of Agniveer are hilarious,gravely misleading, and highly far-fetched, I pity <em>Agniveer</em> and his contemplating, interpretive skills , I would like to know who taught these skills to him, no doubt it&#8217;s the so-called <em>&#8220;Maharishis&#8221;</em><br />
<em>(Great Seers)</em>, <em>&#8220;Mahamunis&#8221;</em>, <em>&#8220;Yogis&#8221;</em> et al. who taught him these things. And I am amused to see the height of his imagination and conjectures. Wake up ,Agniveer can you come back to reality now , out of your imaginative world?Or if it pleases you, you can live in your delusions, as it&#8217;s all about personal quest for Truth, which the hindus dislike and despise taking in, which at least hurts them and detroys them.</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:black;">Earlier , Agniveer claimed , vedic dharma<em>(Hindu Religion)</em> to be <em>&#8220;Hygienic</em>&#8221; and Islam to be otherwise<em>(which is debunked earlier)</em> , now here are few sholka&#8217;s<em>(verses)</em> from the sacred <em>&#8220;Dharma Shastra&#8221;</em><br />

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:black;">Well, I think this verse makes it straight, so even according to the Shastras, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Saliva fallen on any body, also flies…etc. aren&#8217;t impure</span>, so why isn&#8217;t Agniveer found criticising this verse or may be he is unaware? Wasn&#8217;t he pompously claiming Vedic Dharma <em>(Hindus)</em> to be hygienic? Well, now that&#8217;s Hygienic Hindusim, anyone who&#8217;s attended elementary schooling know , the how inhygienic flies are. Flies can be quite dirty and besides contaminating food with eggs and maggots, they can also carry bacteria that cause intestinal diseases. Flies can travel from fecal material to our food very easily, carrying bacteria with them on body hairs or the sticky pads on their feet. When feeding, flies expel saliva and feces that may also contain bacteria. It has been shown that each house fly can easily carry over one million bacteria on its body. Some of the disease-causing agents shown to be transmitted by house flies to humans are: higellosis, salmonella, typhoid fever, dysentery <em>(diarrhea),</em> Escherichia coli, conjunctivitis <em>(pink eye)</em> and parasitic worms.Also we learn that Saliva , falling from mouth of anybody part doesn&#8217;t render it <em>(saliva and its owner)</em> impure, so why is Prophet&#8217;s blowing moist on left side, or spitting on cloth to avoid contanimating surrounding , been criticised? Well the anwers is ,bias Hindu minds.</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:black;font-size:14pt;"><strong><span style="font-family:Garamond;">This is Pure and Hygienic in Vedic Dharma(Hinduism)</span><span style="font-family:Old English Text MT;"> =&gt;</span></strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:black;">Also , here a nice method is been prescribed to purify the half-drunk water by Brahamans<em>(Priestly caste people),</em> that&#8217;s by pouring down it to the ground , and again now the water is recycled by the <em>&#8220;Vedic&#8221;</em> method and is pure to be consumed, so here dirty water<em>(as its been pured on the ground which has varying impurities) </em>plus half-drunk<em>(Jootha)</em> water becomes pure, and ready to consume, so this the vedic <em>&#8220;Hygiene&#8221;</em> and <em>&#8220;purity&#8221;.</em> So here we learn that saliva flying from mouth , on other is also not impure.</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />

</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
Sunaan Abu Dawud, Book 1, Number 0067:<br />
Narrated Abu Sa&#8217;id al-Khudri: I heard that the people asked the Prophet of Allah (peace_be_upon_him): Water is brought for you from the well of Buda&#8217;ah. It is a well in which dead dogs, menstrual clothes and excrement of people are thrown. The Messenger of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) replied: Verily water is pure and is not defiled by anything.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
<em>Comments: This explains why Muslim countries are among dirtiest places in world and breed dangerous diseases.</em><br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">The hadeeth quoted <span style="color:purple;"><em>(Sunan Abu Dawud, Book 1, no. 67)</em></span> , is talking about a well, unlike well&#8217;s found in other parts of world, which are usually human dugged , well bricked ones, here the Hadeeth is talking of a well of Buda&#8217;ah, which are not human dug but natural , discovered by man, thesee are usually very huge wells, sought og mini lakes..etc <span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">And this is what the great Islamic Scholar al-Imam <span style="color:blue;">Muhammad Shamsul Haq al-Azeemabaadi</span> commented on this hadeeth saying :<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:right;"><span style="color:red;"><span style="font-family:Bookman Old Style;font-size:10pt;">&#8220;Basically this is implying that because the well was so huge, such a small amount of impurities will not ruin the whole well&#8221;.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span><span style="font-family:Garamond;"><span style="font-size:12pt;">&#8211; </span><span style="font-size:8pt;">[Awn al-Mabud Sharh Sunan Abu Dawud, Kitab: Al Tahara, Bab: Ma Jaa&#8217;a Fi Ba&#8217;ir Bidaa&#8217;a, Commentary on Hadith no.<span style="color:black;"> 60]</span></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">So, its clear that these wells were very huge that small amount of impurities did not make it dirty or impure just like small impurities do not make a lake impure.I also wonder, in India and other countries, people usually bathe in lakes, pond and also wash their kine<em>(like buffalos, cows…etc)</em> , wash clothes and other things and then use the same water from the lake for drinking , this has been done for thousand of years, I guess Agniveer has acknowledged this fact recently.Infactuality Hindus even throw their dead bodies in the river Ganga<em>(considered Holy according to Orthodox Hindus)</em> and then use the same water for drinking, and other throw ashes after burning the dead in rivers, lakes, ponds and then use the same water for drinking, bathing, I&#8217;m pretty sure that Agniveer has recently acknowledge and have come to know about this lately. But what of his <em>&#8220;Hygienic&#8221;</em> Vedic Dharma? <span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">According to the Dharma Shastras too large tanks, aren&#8217;t defiled by dead animals and small impurities.<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left:72pt;"><span style="color:#ff9900;"><span style="font-family:Bookman Old Style;font-size:10pt;">&#8221; For small reservoirs of water and for ponds the same mode of purification has been prescribed as for wells, O Earth <span style="color:red;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>; but large tanks (excepting Tirthas) are not defiled (by dead animals, &amp;c.)</strong></span> </span></span></span><span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:8pt;">[ ( Vishnu Smriti, Ch-23 , verse 46, pg 103, Translated by Julius Jolly ,Oxford , Clarendon Press 1880]</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">So , its clear that even according to the smritis, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">large tanks are defiles and rendered impure by dead animals and other impure stuffs</span>.This is somehat like shooting in the leg , isn&#8217;t it?<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Also it will be informational to hindus to know that their Hindu Vedic Predecessors having beign using these materials<em>(Cow hair,tail, Bones,CowDung,..etc</em>) to mark the boundaries of and lands, farms and terrorities..etc.<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#ff6600;"><span style="font-family:Bookman Old Style;font-size:10pt;">&#8220;And as he will see that through men&#8217;s ignorance of the boundaries trespasses constantly occur in the world, let him cause to be made other hidden marks for boundaries, <span style="color:red;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Stones, bones, cow&#8217;s hair, chaff, ashes, potsherds, dry cowdung, bricks, cinders, pebbles, and sand</strong></span><span style="color:#ff6600;">.&#8221;</span></span></span></span><span style="font-family:Garamond;"> <span style="font-size:9pt;">(The Laws Of Manu, Ch 8 verses 149- 150, Translated by George Bühler)</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">So does the Brihaspati Smriti states – <span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:14pt;"><span style="color:#ff6600;"><span style="font-family:Bookman Old Style;font-size:10pt;">&#8220;By such visible signs as these a boundary line should always be caused to be marked; also, by other (marks) deposited underground which the earth is not likely to destroy. <span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Dry cowdung, bones, chaff, charcoal, stones, potsherds, sand, bricks, cows tails, cotton seeds, and ashes :&#8221;</strong></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>

</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">I wonder, why does Agniveer delve into baseless claims and talks like he did in the comment <span style="color:red;">&#8220;<em>Muslim countries are among dirtiest places in world and breed dangerous diseases&#8221;</em></span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Well, I guess the above verses prove a lot otherwise! Isn&#8217;t it? We read in the above verses that the Vedic predecessors of Hindus, used to bury and throw all type of dirty things like Cow-Dung,Urine ,Cow hairs and tails, broken pots<em>(Potsherds)</em> cinders, ashes and bones on the boundaries and bury them to mark boundaries,now this is polluting the environment which they indulged in, still Agniveer alleges muslim countries of being dirty whereas its clearly proven how dirty the vedic civilisation was, which dumped all their trash on the boundaries under the pretext of marking boundaries and called it hidden marking of boundaries,also I do not understand why these trash had to be used as <em>&#8220;hidden&#8221;</em> marks? Can&#8217;t they use somethig more environment friendly and clean things which did not stink and was pure!<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">I wonder this is enough to show , who were and are dirty, Muslims or Vedic Hindus?Its clear from the preceding verses, and there are many and many such verses , but this should suffice for the Truth seeker, also I would like to request hindus to be more responsible, concerning Cleanliness of the Soceity and environment, as it seems their ancestors totally ignored it, I would be Optimistic and hope that Hindus don&#8217;t follow their Vedic Predecessors.<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />

</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt;"><br />
Sahih Bukhari, Volume 1, Book 5, Number 260:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt;"><br />
Narrated Maimuna: The Prophet took the bath of Janaba (sexual relation or wet dream). He first cleaned his private parts with his hand, and then rubbed it (that hand) on the wall and washed it. Then he performed ablution like that for the prayer, and after the bath he washed his feet.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt;"><br />
<em>Comment: The purpose behind defiling the wall needs deep research.</em></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">The hadeeth quoted is <span style="color:purple;"><em>(i.e Saheeh al-Bukhari,vol-1,Book 5, no 260)</em></span> again this is to be noted that the Hadeeth is recorded in the 5<sup>th</sup> Book that is Book of Ghusl or Bathing! All the Hadeeth quoted in this Book are related to Bathing and basically sanitary-related activiites, this does explain things.<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">What here Prophet did was use the dust on the walls <span style="text-decoration:underline;">to rub</span> and clean his hands after he had cleaned his private parts<em>(so that they are cleaned nicely)</em>, that is <span style="text-decoration:underline;">he did not just use water</span> after cleaning hs private parts but also used sand as and cleaning agent, obviosly in those days there weren&#8217;t soaps and other cleaning agents available.Again this show how much the Prophet of Mercy was carefull about hygiene and cleanliness, he after cleaning his private parts rubbed his hands with dust as <span style="text-decoration:underline;">soaps and other washing/cleaning agents weren&#8217;t available </span>in those times, and then thouroughly wash them with waters.<span style="text-decoration:underline;">The reason why he would rub his hands with dust, sand or soil is to <strong>remove the bad smell</strong> left on the hands</span><em>[this has been expalined/stated by various scholars for instance Shaykh Sayyid Sabiq in Fiqh us-Sunah – at-Taharah wa Salah]</em>, and this again proves the high standard of hygience and cleanliness the prophet followed.Conisely speaking, the reason for using dust,soil <span style="text-decoration:underline;">was to make sure</span> that the hands is thoroughly clean and that there isn&#8217;t any bad smell left on the hands which will was very hygienic and impure.<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">And with regards to the hilarious comment by Agniveer <span style="color:red;">&#8220;The purpose behind defiling the wall needs deep research.&#8221;</span>,<span style="color:red;"><br />
</span>then its quite noteworthy to point here that the preceding hadeeth <span style="color:purple;">(i.e Saheeh al-Bukhari Vo-1, Book 5 no. 259)</span> says :<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:14pt;"><span style="color:purple;font-family:Bookman Old Style;font-size:10pt;">&#8220;Then he<em>(Prophet Muhammad)</em> washed his private parts <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>and rubbed his hands on the ground</strong></span>, washed them with water…&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">The Previous hadeeth<span style="color:purple;"><em>(no. 259)</em></span>, of the one quoted by Agniveer , quite clearly states that he rubbed <span style="text-decoration:underline;">his hands on the ground</span>. The wisdom behind using dust is quite understood I guess, and the reason why prophet Muhammad used the dust from the wall is that he did not find , dust and he used the easily available dust, as cleanliness is quite important in Islam, also a point should be noted that 1400 years ago the houses in Arabia were made of Mud , and the walls were of full of dusts, again here agniveer seems to neglect historical facts, to forward his lies.The walls of those times weren&#8217;t plastered with clay or plaster of paris and then emulsioned with colours, as its now, the walls back then were muddy, with dust and and sand on it.<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">I guess its again quite evident that Mr. Plagiarist<em>(Agniveer)</em> hasn&#8217;t done any research or exploration, but simply plagiarised from Islamophobic articles, or how is it possible that he would have missed the previous hadeeth of the one he quoted! Also its hilarious and quite funny , when Agniveer talks of <span style="color:red;">&#8220;deep research&#8221;</span>! Its quite amusing to see Agniveer deceiving his fellow folks<em>(Protestant Hindus)</em> , but I wonder how can he be so fanciful to think he could deceive Muslims?<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Now just have a brief look at Vedic Civilization and Hindu Scriptures and the standard of Hygiene it promotes , I promise Agniveer will be astounded –<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>

</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Now this is an amazing , thing isn&#8217;t it what great science !

</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">The quoted verse from the Purana and Manu Smriti and Vishnu Smritit declare dust and earth to be pure and purifier even if it may be contamnated!And the verse quoted from the Laws of Manu(manu Smriti) the last one, talks of putting earth or dust on head when settling the boundaries of terrotories, farms, lands etc. So what is this called? I think a in-depth research needs to be carried out in order to know why , puuting dirt on head is necessary while settling the boundaries of land?Well this is again shooting in the leg, isn&#8217;t it<em>(Agniveer has been shooting in his leg from the start of that article, pretty amazing to see it)</em>, I wonder if Agniveer had read what his Vedic Predecessors , especially the Sages have derived from the vedas and what the Manu Smriti said, which is considered the most authentic Dharma Shastra<em>(Hindu law books).</em> Well, we learn from the above quoted verses that Earth and dust are considered to be Pure and purifiers in Hindusim so much that they are to be scattered over the food if the food is defiled and this will render the food pure, amazing vedic science.Still , these Hindus try and concot lies against Islam and inorder to malign the Only true way of life<em>(Deen)</em> that&#8217;s Islam.<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Now coming to walls and defiling them which Mr. Plagiarist<em>(Agniveer) </em>talks of in his comment, then here are few exposures &#8211;<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#ff6600;font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size:10pt;"> &#8220;This Ayodhya, famed thro&#8217; the three worlds and encircled by sacred groves, appears to-day to have been shorn of its glory and happiness. <span style="color:red;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>The walls are white and have not been smeared with cowdung for some days.</strong></span><span style="color:#ff6600;"> The brahmanas that make this city their home, are masters of the vedas and the vedanta; self-restraint, self-control and other attendant virtues crown them with glory.&#8221;</span></span></span></span></p>

</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Well, I guess the above cited sacred Ithihasa book of Ramayana shows , how vedic hindus used to smear and plaster their home with cow-dung, which is still praticed in the rural India, now this is called defiling the wall.Also the floors of hindu houses in rural India are smeared and covered ans palstered by cow-dung , this is an ancient tradition still in pratice.This is <em>&#8220;Purification&#8221;</em> according to vedic Hindus!Here are few citations which show this so-called Purification tradition in ancient Vedic India and Hindu Scriptures.<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left:14pt;"><span style="color:#ff6600;"><span style="font-family:Bookman Old Style;font-size:10pt;">&#8220;Let him <span style="color:red;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>smear a pure</strong></span><span style="color:#ff6600;"> and secluded place with <span style="color:red;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>cowdung</strong></span><span style="color:#ff6600;">, and carefully make it sloping towards the south.&#8221;</span></span></span></span></span></span><br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#ff6600;font-family:Bookman Old Style;font-size:10pt;">&#8220;…The house <span style="color:red;"><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">should be washed with cow-dung</span> and water</strong><span style="color:#ff6600;">, mixed together.&#8221;</span></span></span><br />

<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Again quoting Manu Smriti :<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#ff6600;"><span style="font-family:Bookman Old Style;font-size:10pt;">&#8220;Grass, wood, and straw <span style="color:red;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>become pure</strong></span><span style="color:#ff6600;"> by being sprinkled (with water), <span style="color:red;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>a house by sweeping and smearing (it with cowdung or whitewash)</strong></span><span style="color:#ff6600;">, an earthen (vessel) by a second burning.&#8221;</span></span></span></span></span></span><br />

</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">So what we read and learn from the above quoted verses is that , smearing, plastering walls , floors with cow-dung is an ancient vedic tradtion which is still prevalent in rural India, and according to Hindu Scriptures purifying a house <span style="text-decoration:underline;">means smearing and flooring it with excreta, well wonderful purification , this is Vedic purification</span>, but in other parts of world its commonly known as filling you house with excreta if I am not wrong.Its really nice to see the <em>&#8220;practicality&#8221;</em> of Vedic Dharma(Hinduism) .<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Old English Text MT;font-size:14pt;"><strong>Quote :</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt;"><strong>5. Islamic perfume!</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt;"><br />
Ash Shifa (p.35) states that women collected Muhammad&#8217;s sweat, because his sweat smelled perfume. Asha Shifa continues:</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt;"><br />
The messenger of Allah slept on a rug in the house of Anas and perspired. <strong>Anas&#8217;s mother brought a long necked bottle in which to put his sweat</strong>. The Messenger of Allah asked her about this she said, &#8220;We put it in our perfume and it is the most fragrant of scents.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Here , the Book quoted is <span style="color:blue;">Ash-Shifa</span> by <span style="color:blue;">al-Qâdî `Iyâd</span>, the issue with this book has been earlier explained , this book is well-known to be filled with fabrications and false fabricated ahadeeth<em>(Narrations),</em> to say firstly.As now coming to issue of using the sweat of prophet and mixing it then its again plainly a miralce which the people duringg those times witnessed, which is historically indeniable fact.<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Now its to be noted that the people were eager to use the sweat of prophet and did so mostly without his knowledge for example its been narrated in Saheeh al-Bukhari :<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:14pt;"><span style="color:purple;"><span style="font-family:Bookman Old Style;font-size:10pt;">&#8220;Um Sulaim used to spread a leather sheet for the Prophet and he used to take a midday nap on that leather sheet at her home.&#8221; And <span style="color:red;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>&#8220;When the Prophet had slept</strong></span><span style="color:purple;">, she would take some of his sweat and hair and collect it (the sweat) in a bottle and then mix it with Suk (a kind of perfume) <span style="color:red;"><strong>while he was still sleeping</strong><span style="color:purple;">.&#8221;</span></span></span></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">So its to noted , that his fragrant sweat was used, when he was sleeping, and that this is a miracle which humans present at that time had witnessed, its again a proof how a messenger of the Almighty Allâh Azz wa Jall<em>(One True God)</em> , is blessed.<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Also , I don&#8217;t understand why does Agniveeer have problem with this, that is the love and respect the final Prophet Muhammad received from the people and the Miracles he was given by Allâh Azz wa Jall .When the human written vedas<em>(Hindu Scriptures)</em> holded as <em>&#8220;Holy&#8221;</em> by Hindus and Protestant Hindus declare Cows to be <span style="color:red;"><strong>&#8220;Protectors&#8221;</strong></span> of Earth and the Heaven.<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span><span style="font-size:8pt;"><em>(Yajurveda Ch 33 verse 19,See my refutation of Main point 2 for the full reference)</em><br />
</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">So whats the problem? Its hard to fathom that while the hindu scriptures declare cow to be <em>&#8220;protector&#8221;</em> of heaven and earth, a hindu is criticising Islam because the final Prophet for the whole Human-kind Muhammad came with miracles , and that his sweat was full of fragrance, which was used with perfume.<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">I wonder why hindus can have incoherent and irrational beliefs like <span style="text-decoration:underline;">cows being protectors of the earth and heaven</span>, and that <span style="text-decoration:underline;">cows,horses and goats possess the qualities of sun</span> and <span style="text-decoration:underline;">cow- ordure and urine are tranquillity and prosperity, and that being covered in Cow-dung and urine is beautiful </span>..etc. Then why cannot the extremely rational and coherent belief of Muslims that the Prophet of Mercy Muhammad had many Miracles and that his sweat was miraculously full of fragrance, which is also is a historical fact witnessed by people.Why cannot the God Almighty <em>(Allâh Azz wa Jall)</em> give his prophets miracles? Especially when he&#8217;s the final prophet for the guidance of Human-Kind. Or is it that according to Hindus and Protestant Hindus God is incapable of providing miracles? So is that the Hindu belief about and his capabilities God? <span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Also it would be worthy to quote Mahabharata , wherein its ordered never to have repugnance toward excreta of cow,and should take the names of cow whenever you had a bad dream.<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:14pt;"><span style="color:red;"><span style="font-family:Bookman Old Style;font-size:10pt;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>&#8220;One should never feel any <span style="color:green;">repugnance<span style="color:red;"> for the urine and the dung of the cow.</span></span></strong></span><span style="color:#ff6600;"> One should never eat the flesh of kine. As the consequence of this, one is sure to attain to great prosperity. One should always take the names of kine. One should never show any disregard for kine in any way. If evil dreams are seen, men should take the names of kine.&#8221;</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:14pt;"><span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:9pt;">&#8211; [The Mahabharata , Book 13: Anusasana Parva, <span style="color:black;">Part 2<strong><em><br />
</em></strong>,</span>Section <span style="color:black;">LXXVIII </span>, pgs 113 -114,Translated by Kisari Mohan Ganguli, 1883-1896]</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Well, I would really like to know , why is it that cow&#8217;s excreta shouldn&#8217;t been shown any repugnance,whereas the miraculous sweat which was fragrant of the prophet deemed as impure ? This is again, simply the bias of an hindu which keeps them away from truth.<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:black;"><strong>Now few questions clearly arise</strong>, they are 1) <span style="text-decoration:underline;">why do Hindus deem cows as protectors</span>, and that 2) they<em> (cows)</em> possess qualities of sun as stated in Veda, also 3) why is it that babies covered in mud mixed with cow-dung and urine look beautiful and 4) why is it that none should have any repugnance and aversion for cow-dung and urine?<em> (See my refutation of Main point 2 for the full references of all.)</em></span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:black;"> I would really like to know , when cows can be protectors of earth and heaven, and then cow ordure shouldn&#8217;t been shown any aversion then , why is the so-called &#8220;Islamic Perfume&#8221; considered by these protestant Hindu ir-rationalist&#8217;s as something&#8217;s &#8220;filthy&#8221; dirty? What are the reasons for it? Well, its been recorded that his <em>(Muhammad) </em>sweat had beautiful fragrance , which is a historically true, so comparing this fragrant sweat and cow ordure, urine is like likening dust and diamond. Also, I would like to briefly educate few, about sources of Perfumes, there are many sources of perfumes, like flora (plant) sources in which bark, seeds, leaves…etc. are used to make perfumes and the sources which I would like people to learn about is <strong>Animal Sources</strong> (Fauna), it seems Agniveer is unaware that thousands of perfumes available today in various markets, have various ingredients and many have faunal sources!</span><br />

</span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:black;">So, we learn that perfumes are made from various sources, and &#8220;excrement&#8221; of animals is one of them, also fatty compounds expelled from sperm of whale is used to make perfumes, well these are facts should be extinguisher for Agniveer&#8217;s ignorance and bias, as he seems to be unaware of simple and well-known things, it&#8217;s also interesting to mention that many perfumes also contain alcohol.</span><br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:black;">It&#8217;s quite, understood that either Mr. Plagiarist <em>(Agniveer)</em> was unknown of these facts of just hypocritically playing around and maligning Islam. So when perfumes can contain such things which help make them better then why not the sweat of Muhammad which was well-known to be fragrant! Well, if sweat of the Prophet (Muhammad) is considered dirty, where as it was fragrant then what about these perfumes? So are these excrement based perfume pure and clean? If not so why don&#8217;t I see Agniveer criticising it on his hilarious and non-Scholastic website? Silence is generally considered to be affirmation. Muslims believe that the Prophets sweat was fragrant and people even mixed it with perfume and used it, certain questions arise, 1) how was prophet&#8217;s perfume fragrant? And a simple answer to it is that this was a blessing of Allah<em> (the Only One True God)</em>, and cannot the Almighty God give his messengers certain provisions like this? Why not? Well at least Allah Azz wa Jall can <em>(the Only One True God), </em>as he is omnipotent and every-Merciful. The only problem is with the perception of God of Protestant Hindus, may be their so-called God is believed to be weak who cannot grant or bless people in such a way. </span><br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:black;"><strong>Rationally, the use of sweat of prophet is justified. When today people use things like &#8220;excreta&#8221;, alcohol etc. then why not the sweat of the prophet which was inherently fragrant. And only a bias person can allege Islam, with regard to this.</strong></span><br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:18pt;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:black;">Concisely putting it, the quotation provided by Agniveer only prove the miraculous nature of the final Prophet and the irrational, illogical beliefs of Hindus and their biased nature which tends to be whimsically inclined to follow falsehood. <em>[See other sections where drinking, bathing, and using Cow Urine and Ordure are permitted in Hindu Scriptures, people will be amazed at the double-standards of Hindus]</em></span><br />

When he finished, I walked with him and asked, &#8220;What about the bone and the animal dung?&#8221; He said, &#8220;They are of the food of Jinns. The delegate of Jinns of (the city of) Nasibin came to me−−and how nice those Jinns were−−and asked me for the remains of the human food. I invoked Allah for them that they would never pass by a bone or animal dung but find food on them.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

<em>Comment: We researched a lot, but find no Islamic Research Foundation (IRF) explaing the mystery behind cleaning private parts with stones, and that too with odd number of stones only. We request our Islamic scientists to unravel the practicality behind this custom.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">The first Ahadeeth quoted is <span style="color:purple;"><em>(Saheeh al-Bukharee, vol-4,Book 1, no 162)</em></span>and the other one which is only cited but not quoted is <span style="color:purple;">(no.63) <span style="color:black;">, here I quote both the hadeeth in full.First no. 62 then 63 respectively.</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:14pt;"><span style="color:purple;font-family:Bookman Old Style;font-size:10pt;">Narrated Abu Huraira: The Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever performs ablution should clean his nose with water by putting the water in it and then blowing it out, and whoever cleans his private parts with stones should do it with odd number of stones.&#8221; </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:14pt;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">And the next hadeeth , that is no 63 –<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:14pt;"><span style="color:purple;"><span style="font-family:Bookman Old Style;font-size:10pt;">Narrated Abu Huraira: Allâh&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;If anyone of you performs ablution he should put water in his nose and then blow it out and whoever cleans his private parts with stones should do so with odd numbers. <span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;">And whoever wakes up from his sleep should wash his hands before putting them in the water for ablution, because nobody knows where his hands were during sleep.&#8221; </span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">The Hadeeth <span style="color:purple;">no. 63</span> is only cited and not quoted<em>(on purpose to hide the great standards of prophets hygiene)</em> , as this hadeeth clearly shows how hygienic the prophet was, it clearly lays emphasis on washing your hands before, putting them in water as while a person is asleep he doesn&#8217;t not know where his hands were, meaning he could have touched his private parts or other areas which could lead in polluting the water , hence he ordered that people should wash their hands before putting them in water.Also we see Prophet Muhammad teaching people to clean their nose thoroughly during ablution , all these facts only proove how hygienic the prophet of mercy Muhammad<em>(Sallal lahu alayhi wa sallam) </em>was.<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Now coming to the next hadeeth quoted, it is <span style="color:purple;"><em>(Saheeh al-Bukhari vol-58 Book 5, no.200)</em><br />
</span>here&#8217;s the full text of the hadeeth :<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:14pt;"><span style="color:purple;font-family:Bookman Old Style;font-size:10pt;">Narrated Abu Huraira: That once he was in the, company of the Prophet carrying a water pot for his ablution and for cleaning his private parts. While he was following him carrying it(i.e. the pot), the Prophet said, &#8220;Who is this?&#8221; He said, &#8220;I am Abu Huraira.&#8221; The Prophet said, <strong>&#8220;Bring me stones in order to clean my private parts</strong>, and do not bring any bones or animal dung.&#8221; Abu Huraira went on narrating: So I brought some stones, carrying them in the corner of my robe till I put them by his side and went away. When he finished, I walked with him and asked, &#8220;What about the bone and the animal dung?&#8221; He said, &#8220;They are of the food of Jinns. The delegate of Jinns of (the city of) Nasibin came to me–and how nice those Jinns were–and asked me for the remains of the human food. I invoked Allâh for them that they would never pass by a bone or animal dung but find food on them.&#8221; </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">All the ahadeeth quoted his this section are quite self-explanatory and easily understandable, I don&#8217;t find a reason for any problem,as for the questions raised on usage of stones then let me explain it to the people in simple terms.<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">The reason why prophet Muhammad asked for stone while Abu Hurairah was carrying a water pot is, to teach people that even without water its possible to get oneself cleaned.<span style="text-decoration:underline;">This was purely for the educative purpose</span>, as we all know that Arabia is an desert peninsula where people hardly have<em>(and had)</em> water to drink , its only at times when you have water to clean your self or use while lavation.Hence during such times when water is unavailable clean stone could be used as they will help you clean yourself after urinating and discharge of ordure.<span style="text-decoration:underline;">This showed and informed people another clean way of cleaning themselves, hence it was purely for educative purposes.</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Secondly, its to be noted that stones are only recommended to use when <strong>you don&#8217;t have water</strong> for cleansing purpose</span>.As back then there were no toilet-papers! Again we see Agniveer neglecting historical facts! So if you don&#8217;t have water and no toilet-paper or any medium of cleansing your self , what will you do? I hope you don&#8217;t come out without cleaning yourself! The only way out is using stones,pebbles…etc which are easily available.<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Again we read Agniveer in his fanciful and hilarious comments asking IRF<em>[(Islamic Research Foundation)an foundation/institute runned by few studnets of knowledge]</em> to explain the so-called mystery of cleaning private parts with stones, I think if Agniveer had used little of his brain and tried to think, or an easy way out was reasearching about it, I am pretty sure that he would have received the answer to the question he had which he now claims to be a mystery, I would like to question Agniveer whether he even knows the meaning of the word <em>&#8220;mystery&#8221;</em> ? Well, it seems Agniveer hates reserching, this is what is apparent from his articles.<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Now coming to the question of using odd number of stones then it was an <em>advice/recommendation</em> of the prophet of mercy, to the people in order to limit people in using stones , for instance he recommended using odd number of stones that is either 1,3,5..etc this was clearly done so that people only use as much they need ,like if they are able to cleanse themselves with <em>&#8220;one&#8221;</em> stone thoroughly then use one or if not one then three which is enough. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">The sublime wisdom behind this recommendation was to teach people to be frugal in every matter and limit using stone as per need,</span><br />
<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Also its noteworthy to point out that this was a recommendation, whereas a human is free to use as many number of stones he wishes , except that he shouldn&#8217;t be extravagant but be frugal.<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">And and prophet of mercy himself used varying number of stones for instance in <span style="color:purple;"><em>(Saheeh al-Bukhari vol-4 Book 1, no 157)</em></span> The Prophet said</span><span style="font-family:Bookman Old Style;font-size:10pt;"><br />
<span style="color:purple;">&#8220;Fetch for me some stones for &#8216; cleaning the privates parts</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">…&#8221; <span style="text-decoration:underline;">without specifying any numbers or asking odd numbers of stones</span>.Also in another hadeeth the Prophet said to have used 2 stones for cleaning<span style="color:purple;">(no.158</span>).So this shows that using Odd numbers of stones like 1,3,5…etc is recommended as we muslims love the Pure Islamic Monotheism. <span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Now its time to learn about the so-called Vedic Hygiene and standard of Purification which Agniveer , is pompous about, and scrutinise truth.<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:14pt;text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Usage of Earth, soil for cleaning of Private Parts in Hindu Scriptures :</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left:14pt;"><span style="color:red;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">&#8220;In order to cleanse (the organs) by which urine and faeces are ejected<span style="color:#ff6600;"><strong>, <span style="color:red;">earth and water must be used</span></strong></span></span><span style="color:#ff6600;">, as they may be required, likewise in removing the (remaining ones among) twelve impurities of the body&#8221;</span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:10pt;"> -( The Laws of Manu, Ch 5 verse 134, Translated by George Bühler)</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Using of earth and water to cleanse the urinary and other defecating Organ, is prescribed by Manu Smriti in the above verse.And below is a little detailed desccription of this act of using earth to clean your private parts.<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:14pt;"><span style="color:#ff6600;"><span style="font-family:Bookman Old Style;font-size:10pt;">&#8220;He who desires to be <span style="color:red;">pure<span style="color:#ff6600;">, <span style="color:red;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>must clean the organ by one (application of) earth, the anus by (applying earth) three (times)</strong></span><span style="color:#ff6600;">, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">the (left) hand alone by (applying it) ten (times), and both (hands) by (applying it) seven (times).</span> Such is the purification ordained for <span style="color:red;"><strong>householders</strong><span style="color:#ff6600;">; (it shall be) <span style="color:red;"><strong>double for students</strong>, <strong>treble for hermits</strong><span style="color:#ff6600;">, but <span style="color:red;"><strong>quadruple for ascetics</strong><span style="color:#ff6600;">.&#8221;</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Bookman Old Style;"><br />
</span><span style="font-family:Garamond;">-( The Laws of Manu, Ch 5 verses 136-137, Translated by George Bühler)</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">So we read from the above verse that using earth/soil/sand to clean your urinary Organ and then the anus 3 times, then by left hand alone 10 times and then using <span style="text-decoration:underline;">BOTH</span> the hands seven times and this is the so-called <em>&#8220;purification&#8221;</em> and this is for householders where as students have to perform this process double time, hermits treble and ascetics quadruple times , well may I ask why is this inchorent way of &#8220;purifying&#8221; prescribed in ascending order , and what is the crime of petty students,hermits and ascetics that they have been burdened with such hectic,incoherent way of <em>&#8220;purification&#8221;</em> I am sure that the Protestant Hindus will have an scientific answer for this too!Its to be noted that here soil is applied the number of times specified, well I am sure Agniveer was unaware of this isn&#8217;t it?<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Now here&#8217;s another quote from a Upa-Purana which helps us understand the issue more clearly and gives a clear picture of purification in Vedic Dharma<em>(Hinduism)-</em><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:14pt;"><span style="color:#ff6600;"><span style="font-family:Bookman Old Style;">&#8220;Then he is to hold his genital organ with his hand and go to a river or any other watery place ; he is to fill his vessel with water then and go to some other place</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">.</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><br />
</span><span style="color:#ff6600;"><span style="font-family:Bookman Old Style;">The <span style="color:red;"><strong>Brahmana</strong><span style="color:#ff6600;"> is to use the <span style="color:red;"><strong>white earth</strong><span style="color:#ff6600;">, the <span style="color:red;"><strong>Ksattriya</strong><span style="color:#ff6600;"> is to take the <span style="color:red;"><strong>red earth</strong><span style="color:#ff6600;">, the <span style="color:red;"><strong>Vais&#8217;ya</strong><span style="color:#ff6600;"> is to use the <span style="color:red;"><strong>yellow earth</strong><span style="color:#ff6600;"> and the <span style="color:red;"><strong>Sudra</strong><span style="color:#ff6600;"> is to apply the <span style="color:red;"><strong>black earth</strong><span style="color:#ff6600;"> and with that he is to <span style="color:red;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">cleanse himself</span><span style="color:#ff6600;">. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">The earth under water, the earth of any temple, the earth of an anthill, the earth of a mouse hole, and the remmant of the earth used by another body for washing are not to bo used for cleansing purposes.</span><br />
<span style="color:red;"><strong>The earth for cleansing faeces is twice as much as that used in case of urine clearance ; in the cleansing after sexual intercourse thrice as much</strong><span style="color:#ff6600;">. In urine cleansing the earth is to applied in the organ of generation once, thrice in the hand. And in dirt clearing, twice in the organ of generation, five times in anus, ten times in the left hand and seven times in both the hands. Then apply earth four times first in the left feet and then on the right feet The house holder should clear thus : the Brahmachari is to do twice and the Yatis tour times. At every time the quantity of wet earth that is to bo taken is to be of the size of an Amalaki fruit ; never it is to be less than that. This is for the clearance in the day time. Half of these can be used in the night time… If, out of vanity or sloth, clearing be not done, for three nights, one is to fast,drinking water only, and then to repeat the Gayatri Mantra and thus be purified.&#8221;</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">And the above quote gives a various numbers , of amount time this process is to be done and the amount of Mud/earth to be used and all the other detail , I hope this will really be helful to the hindus!.Basically this quote ,from Devi Upa-Purana and the 2 earlier quotes from Manu Smriti, clearly show the extensive use od Mud/Earth used for cleansing purpose which is prescribed in a very extravagant way.<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">I would like to query , what is the rational wisdom behind this incoherent use of earth/Mud/dirt used for cleaning purpose, that to so extensively extravagantly? I find no rational or scientific basis for such practices.I hope that Protestant Hindus clarify why their Vedic ancestors prescribed such practices and performed them.And its quite amazing to find these hindus criticising Islam and its rational concepts of purification when their own scriptures are fanciful, incoherent and irrational.<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />

<p><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt;"><strong>7. It is permissible to eat without washing hand after coming out of privy (lavatory)!</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

Muslim, Book 3, Number 0725:<br />
Ibn &#8216;Abbas reported: The Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) came out of the privy, and he was presented with some food, and the people reminded him about ablution, but he said: Am I to say prayer that I should perform ablution ?</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

Book 3, Number 0726:<br />
Ibn &#8216;Abbas reported: We were with the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) and he had come out of the privy. Food was presented to him. It was said to him (by the Companions around him) : Wouldn&#8217;t you perform ablution? Upon this he said: Why, am I to say prayer that I should perform ablution ?</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

Book 3, Number 0728:<br />
Ibn Abbas, reported: The Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) came out of the privy after relieving himself, and food was brought to him and he took it, and did not touch water. In another narration transmitted by Sa&#8217;id b. al-Huwairith it is like this: It was said to the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) You have not performed ablution. He said: I do not intend to say prayer that I should perform ablution.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt;"><br />
<em>Comments: This explains why many Hindus used to avoid touching Muslims till recently. This has nothing to do with their ideology, but only relates to their hygiene habits which does not require one to wash hands even after excretion. Many sanitized people may vomit even on imagining such a thing. Hindu texts, on contrary, advise for highest levels of adherence to sanitized habits, and this remains a common bond across almost all sects of Hinduism.</em></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt;"><br />
<em>But are we expecting another fatwa from IRF or Deoband that Muslims are prohibited from washing hands after lavatory, especially when they plan to have food! After all their Prophet used to do so!</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">This section or main point is the most ridiculous and hilarious of all the sections from the article , I just don&#8217;t get how fanciful and imaginative and conjecturable Agniveer is, this section will expose Agniveer and his decpetion, I would really want Hindus and protestant Hindus to see their polemics , deceptive and lying nature and its wonder they call themselves <em>&#8220;Arya-Samaj&#8221; (Noble Society)</em> but infactuality they are <em>&#8220;Anarya-Samaj&#8221;</em><br />
<em>(Ignoble Society)</em> which has always indulged in lies and deception and all the immoral acts.<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Coming to the topic Agniveer, alleges that Islam premits eating without washing hands and that too, after coming out of privy<em>(lavatory,loo)</em>, this only exposes his gross ignorance and illiteracy of Islam.All the hadeeth he quotes <span style="color:purple;"><em>(i.e.Saheeh Muslim, Book 3,Ch 30 ,nos.725,726,727,728)</em>.</span><br />
<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Let me take this as an Oppurtunity to educate Agniveer and his fellow Protestant Hindus, about Islam and expose the ridiculous allegations of Agniveer.<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Let me first explain what does the word <em>&#8220;Ablution&#8221;</em> means! <span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />

<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><strong><em>&#8220;Wudhoo&#8221; </em></strong>is the action and <strong><em>&#8220;Wadoo&#8221;</em></strong> the water used therefore – and it is also a verbal noun; or they are two forms of the same word, both meaning the verbal-noun and maybe both referring also to the water used.<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:14pt;text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Wudhoo(Ablution) in the Sharee&#8217;ah(Islam) :</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><strong><em>&#8220;Wudhoo&#8221;</em>(Ablution)</strong> is using clean and cleansing <em>(Tuhoor)</em><br />
<span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;"><strong>water upon certain body parts </strong></span>as Allaah Ta&#8217;aala<em>(One True Almighty God)</em> has prescribed and explained.<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">What Agniveer has done here , is to deceive people into believing that Ablution<em>(Wudhoo)</em> simply means washing hands! <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Whereas Ablution<em>(Wudhoo)</em> in Islam is a ritual cleansing of certain body parts before praying and touching or reading the noble,holy Qur&#8217;aan</span>.All the 3 ahadeeth he&#8217;s quoted refer to the ritual cleansing of certain body parts<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong><em>(in short ,hands,face,mouth,nose,forearms up to elbow,head, ears, nape and the feets)</em></strong><br />
</span>done before praying, its quite nonsensical of him to consider ritual ablution meaning washing of hands!In all the ahadeeth above the prophet is explaining the companions and people that you need not perform ablution before eating, as they thought it was necessary.<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Ritual ablution(Wudhoo) is needed when you&#8217;re to pray or touch, read the noble,holy Qur&#8217;aan.Its not mandatory to do the ritual ablution(Wudhoo) for eating, you have to wash your hands thoroughly as it was the practice of Prophet Muhammad<em>(Sallal lahu alayhi wa sallam)</em><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">It is related by <span style="color:blue;">Sunan Al-Nasa&#8217;i</span> that the <span style="color:maroon;">Prophet Muhammad</span><em> (Sallal lahu alayhi wa sallam)</em></span><span style="font-family:Arial Black;"><strong><br />
<span style="color:fuchsia;">&#8220;<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Used to wash his hands whenever he wanted to eat</span>&#8220;</span></strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">And the <span style="color:maroon;">prophet</span> also said :</span><span style="color:purple;"><span style="font-family:Bookman Old Style;"><strong> &#8220;Whoever goes to sleep <span style="color:red;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">without washing his hands</span><span style="color:purple;"> from the traces of fatty foods, exposes himself to illness and should blame no one but himself.&#8221;</span></span></strong><span style="color:#009900;"><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span><span style="font-size:8pt;">&#8211; </span></span></span><span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:8pt;">[Abu Dawud (No.3852), Al-Tirmidhi (No.1861), Ibn Majah (No.3267)]</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">So we see that the noble prophet, always <span style="text-decoration:underline;">washed his hands before and after eating</span> thoroughly and cautioned people about it.I think this debunks all the allegations and lies of Agniveer.<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Regarding the washing of hands after coming out of privy then in Islam its mandatory</span>, and earlier in this refutation there many hadeeth where prophet Muhammad himself is described rubbing hands with soil inorder to get rid of bad<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span>smell,if any<em>(as in those days soaps… etc weren&#8217;t available) </em>and then washing the hands thoroughly with water. It&#8217;s a pity that Agniveer first quotes<em>(in section or mainpoint 4)</em> Prophet Muhammad washing his hands thoroughly after relieving himself, and later in his article<em>(here in section 7)</em> healleges that its permissible in Islam if you don&#8217;t wash your hands after relieving yourself, what a pity!This confused ,self-contradictory Protestant hindu even lacks the basic skills , and here he is alleging Islam with his funny, fanciful, whims.<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Concludingly,in<span style="text-decoration:underline;"> Islam its mandatory to wash your hands before and after eating and also ,after relieving oneself.Whereas ritual ablution<em>(Wudhoo)</em> is mandatory for touching,reading the holy Qur&#8217;an and for praying.I hope the readers have understood the difference between Ablution<em>(Wudhoo)</em> and washing of hands which agniveer deceitfully implies to be same thing, how ignorant of him.Whereas the hadeeth</span><span style="color:purple;"><em>(i.e. Saheeh al-Bukharee, Volume 1, Book 5, Number 260)</em></span>,<span style="text-decoration:underline;"> which he himself quotes in <span style="color:red;">section 4 clearly distinguishes between washing of hands and Ablution.</span></span> This should be enough for any truth seeker and readers, in recognising the deception of this Protestant Hindu,Agniveer.<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Agniveer again in a hilarious manner comments <span style="color:red;">&#8220;Hindu texts, on contrary, advise for highest levels of adherence to sanitized habits, and this remains a common bond across <span style="text-decoration:underline;">almost all sects of Hinduism</span>.&#8221;</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Let&#8217;s scrutinise the claims of this confused protestant hindu, and show our readers the truth of the matter.First lets see the hindu ablution.<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:14pt;text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Here is what a Hindu is supposed to do , <span style="color:red;">if while eating</span>, impure things like <span style="color:#339966;"><em>&#8220;semen</em>&#8220;,</span><br />

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">The same <span style="color:blue;">Gautama Smriti</span> also states that if a person becomes impure while holding something in his hands, he will become pure just by sipping water, without putting the material on the ground.<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">So all these texts clearly prescribe that, sipping of water without cleaning of the the impurity like urine, faeces and semen will render you pure.Also this is done while eating , I am pretty sure that anyone who hears such a thing will vomit and would feel unhealthy,forget doing this , it can only done by the so-called <em>&#8220;hygienic Hindus&#8221;</em> like the protestant hindus<em>(Arya Samajis)</em> isn&#8217;t it, this is the vedic method of purification.This sipping of water is also done by the Protestant Hindus, during Sandhya while reciting the mantra<em>(chants,verses</em>) from vedas like yajurveda..etcAnd in his comments Agniveer stated <span style="color:red;">&#8220;Hindu texts, on contrary, advise for highest levels of adherence to sanitized habits&#8221; </span>which is followed by all the sects in Hinduism <span style="text-decoration:underline;">so this is the high sanitised standard</span> which the Hindu texts advise and prescribe, I wonder if this is even seen as sanitised or not, as all around the world this will simply be labeled as filthy and unhygienic way of purification and eating habits.And this is why clean individuals like to stay away from hindus and their sacrifices and ceremonies , atleast those who didn&#8217;t knew will from now on will.There are many such verses a few which we have seen till know through out the article, but I think this will suffice any unbiased truth seeker,I hope that the truth seeker and our readers have seen a glimpse of hindu standards of hygiene and sanitation.<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />

</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt;"><br />
If one has seminal emission, but has to perform prayers, and finds no water, what do you do? Simple, strike ground with hands and then wipe face and palms! Refer to the SAHIH MUSLIM hadith given below:</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt;"><br />
Book 3, Number 0716:<br />
Abu Musa said to Abdullah: You have not heard the words of &#8216;Ammar: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) sent me on an errand and I had a seminal emission, but could find no water, and rolled myself in dust just as a beast rolls itself. I came to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) then and made a mention of that to him and he (the Holy Prophet) said: It would have been enough for you to do this. Then he struck the ground with his hands once and wiped his right hand with the <span style="color:blue;">help</span> of his left hand and the exterior of his palms and his face. &#8216;Abdullah said: Didn&#8217;t you see that Umar was not fully satisfied with the words of &#8216;Ammar only?</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt;"><br />
<em><strong>Comment: Doubt on this practical science of Hygiene &#8211;</strong> After hands have already become dirty after the emission and rubbing dust, why make face dirty now? Or is it used as a face-cleansing cream? Why not simply spare the face from seminal emission and dust?</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">The hadeeth quote by Mr.Plagiarist<em>(Agniveer) </em>is <span style="color:purple;"><em>(Saheeh Muslim,Book 3, no. 716</em>)</span> this is a huge hadeeth ,and Mr.Plagiarist has only quoted a part of it excluding the rest of the hadith this again, shows his evil intention and action of quoting out of context and misinterpreting the text.<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Here is the full hadeeth :<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:14pt;"><span style="color:purple;"><span style="font-family:Bookman Old Style;font-size:10pt;">Shaqiq reported: I was sitting in the company of Abdullah and Abu Musa when Abu Musa said: O &#8216;Abd al−Rahman (kunya of &#8216;Abdullah b. Mas&#8217;ud), <span style="color:red;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">what would you like a man to do about the prayer if he experiences a seminal emission or has sexual intercourse but <strong>does not find water for a month</strong></span><span style="color:purple;">? &#8216;Abdullah said: He should not perform tayammum even if he does not find water for a month. &#8216;Abdullah said: Then what about the verse in Sura Ma&#8217;ida:&#8221; <span style="color:#99cc00;">If you do not find water, betake yourself to clean dust&#8221;<span style="color:purple;">? &#8216;Abdullah said: If they were granted concession on the basis of this verse, there is a possibility that they would perform <strong>tayammum</strong> with dust on finding water very cold for themselves. Abu Musa said to Abdullah: You have not heard the words of &#8216;Ammar: The Messenger of Allâh (may peace be upon him) sent me on an errand and I had a seminal emission, but could find no water, and rolled myself in dust just as a beast rolls itself. I came to the Messenger of Allâh (may peace be upon him) then and made a mention of that to him and he (the Holy Prophet) said: It would have been enough for you to do thus. Then he struck the ground with his hands once and wiped his right hand with the help of his left hand and the exterior of his palms and his face. &#8216;Abdullah said: Didn&#8217;t you see that Umar was not fully satisfied with the words of &#8216;Ammar only?</span></span></span></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Firstly,its to be noted that the hadeeth is clearly <span style="text-decoration:underline;">talking of a situation when there is no water available, and that too for more than a month</span>! And here is the mercy from the Almighty Allâh Azz wa Jall<em>(One True God),</em> that Tayammum<em>(Dry Ablution)</em> is legislated for us, so as to help us be pure and even when water is unavailable.Analysing the hadeeth quoted , we find that rolling yourself up in clean dust is not permissible, and but what is permissible is the dry Ablution, and here is a brief expounding on it.<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:Garamond;"><strong>Dry Ablution in Islam :</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Literally <strong>&#8220;Tayammum&#8221;</strong> means <strong><em>&#8220;aim, purpose&#8221;</em><br />
</strong>and in Islamic law it means<strong><br />
<em>&#8220;aiming for or seeking soil (clean dust) to wipe ones face and hands with the intention of preparing oneself to pray and son on&#8221;</em></strong><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">And this dry ablution is been permitted by Allâh the most merciful in his noble Qur&#8217;aan:<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:14pt;"><span style="color:#99cc00;font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:Garamond;"><strong>&#8220;O you who believe! When you intend to offer As-Salât (the prayer), wash your faces and your hands (forearms) up to the elbows, rub (by passing wet hands over) your heads, and (wash) your feet up to the ankles. <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>If you are in a state of Janâba (i.e. after a sexual discharge), purify yourselves (bathe your whole body). But if you are ill or on a journey, or any of you comes from the Ghâ&#8217;it (toilet), or you have been in contact with women (i.e. sexual intercourse), and you <span style="color:olive;">find no water<span style="color:#99cc00;">, then perform Tayammum with clean earth and rub therewith your faces and hands. <span style="color:olive;">Allâh does not want to place you in difficulty<span style="color:#99cc00;">, but <span style="color:olive;">He wants to purify you</span></span></span></span></span></em></span><span style="color:#99cc00;">, and to complete His Favour to you that you may be thankful.&#8221;</span></strong></span></span><br />
<span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:9pt;">&#8211; (<span style="color:black;">Soorah al-Maa&#8217;idah, Ayat 6)</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">And this verse from the holy, noble Qur&#8217;aan makes it<em>(Dry Ablution)</em> pemissible for muslims to use clean dust, which is indeed a mercy for the human-kind, so as to make easy for them the spiritual and other purification.<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />

<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:14pt;"><span style="color:purple;font-family:Bookman Old Style;font-size:10pt;">&#8220;The Prophet (saying so) lightly stroked the earth with his hand once and blew it off, then passed his (left) hand over the back of his right hand or his (right) hand over the back of his left hand and then passed them over his face.&#8217; &#8221; </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">We learn that striking your hands<em>(till wrist not forearm)</em> on the ground, then blowing-off the dust from the hands and then wiping your face and hands upto-elbow is know as <em>&#8220;Dry ablution</em>&#8220;, this is the method performing it.<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:Garamond;"><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Prerequisites</span>/<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Preconditions</span> or <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Situations</span> when Tayammum<em>(Dry Ablution)</em> is allowed :</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Dry Ablution is only permissible in certain situations</span> some are stated above in the Qur&#8217;aanic verse <span style="text-decoration:underline;">like on being ill wherein using water could severe your illness or cause death</span>, or on a <span style="text-decoration:underline;">journey where you don&#8217;t have water</span>.Or due to extreme cold weather<em>(you fear death due to it or fatal sickness)</em>Or to save water for drinking<em>(fearing you go thirsty..etc)</em> due to its unavailablitiy like Imam Ahmad said <em>&#8220;Many companions performed dry ablution to save their water for drinking&#8221;</em><br />
<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">As for the inability to use water due to an illness or an extreme cold weather, one should bear in mind that the fear for one&#8217;s health must be certain and not imaginary. The illness that entitles one to perform dry ablution as that which might add to one&#8217;s physical <em>(health related) </em>injury. However, it does not necessarily mean that it has to be a near fatal illness. When dry Ablution is done because of extreme cold weather, it is allowed only when water may not be warmed up. In present times, hot water is readily available, nonetheless even if due to some reason one is unable to find heated water or heat water for use, he may resort to dry ablution, due to the danger to life.And here is what the great Islamic Scholars has to say in regards to it.<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />

If you are unable to do that and the cold is severe and is posing a danger to you, and there is no way for you to heat it or to buy some warm water from those who are around you, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">then you are excused, and dry ablution is sufficient</span> for you…&#8221;</span><br />

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:14pt;text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Tayammum(dry ablution) a life saver :</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:14pt;"><span style="color:purple;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;">Jâbir narrated :&#8221;We set out on a journey, and one of us was wounded by a stone on his head. [When he slept,] he had a wet dream, and so he asked his companions, &#8216;Do you see any concession for me to perform tayammum?&#8217; They replied: &#8216;We do not see any concession since you are able to use water.&#8217; Upon that, he took bath and died. When we came back to Allâh&#8217;s Messenger <em>(Sallal lahu alayhi wa Sallam),</em> he was informed of that. He said …It would have been enough for him to perform tayammum, or bandage his wound, wipe over the bandage and bathe the rest of his body.&#8221; </span><span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:9pt;">&#8211; (Sunan Abu Dâwud)</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">And we learn from the above hadeeth that Tayammum could have saved this persons life as in many countries<em>(cold)</em> bathing in old days was quite dangers due to cold, especially when heating measure weren&#8217;t available.<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">And <span style="font-size:12pt;">Allâh</span> the Most Merciful says in his Noble Qur&#8217;aan :</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="margin-left:14pt;"><span style="font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:green;font-family:Garamond;"><strong>&#8220;<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Do not <span style="color:red;">kill <span style="color:green;">yourselves</span></span></span>. Verily Allâh is All-Merciful towards you.&#8221;</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:9pt;"> &#8211; [Surah an-Nisâ´(4):29]</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Hence, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">we are to save ourselves from being extreme</span> and not be hard upon ourselves , especially when the Most Merciful himself eases difficulties for us.<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Again points which should be noted is that Islam has been revealed for all times and for all people, unlike other regional human-origin religions hence by this we realise that centuries ago in desert areas of the world like Sahara,gobi ,Arabian deserts and elsewhere , it was impossible to find water to drink(which is a fact,for instance in darfur where people don&#8217;t even have drops<em> of water to drink)</em> , forget of ablution, and in such circumstance what would a person do , if he did not get water for ablution or that water available was only sufficient for drinking or due to extreme cold like in polar regions and in siberian peninsula he was unable to perform the ablution?<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Well, Islam is the complete way of life<em>(Deen)</em>, which guides you to truth,salavation and bliss in this world and the here-after and here again Islam provides the answer, that is <em>&#8220;At-Tayammum&#8221;</em> or the Dry Ablution as Allâh Azz wa Jall<em>(One True God)</em> does not want to burden us with difficulties as he wants everyone to attain the eternal bliss of paradise.<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Now,coming to the certain objections which were implied by Mr.Playgiarist<em>(Agniveer).</em>He states few things, I would like to quote him , he wrote<em>(emphasis mine)</em><br />
<span style="color:red;">&#8220;After <span style="text-decoration:underline;">hands</span> have already become <span style="color:#99cc00;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">dirty after the emission<span style="color:red;"> and rubbing dust</span></span>, why make face dirty no<span style="color:red;">w?&#8221;</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">A short note, I wonder how did Agniveer conclude that hands had become dirty after seminal emission, I hope Agniveer knows the area from where seminal fluid gushes out or emitted as far I know its not hands!Its also to be noted that the dust which is rubbed on the hands is first blown-off and then the face is wiped, so subsequently there remains no dust on the hands or the face, which is quite evident from the above where the method of dry ablution is described.Even if there is some remanant of dust then know that it&#8217;s the clean dust which is used for purification, and dust it self is pure and indeed its widely accepted in the scientific fraternity the humans are made of dust , so if using this clean dust is dirty then the humans themselves are dirty inherently as they are made of dust and other contributing elements <span style="font-size:12pt;">like <span style="color:blue;text-decoration:underline;">iron</span>,<span style="color:blue;text-decoration:underline;">fluorine</span> ,<span style="color:blue;text-decoration:underline;">silicon</span>,<span style="color:blue;text-decoration:underline;">lead</span>,<span style="color:blue;text-decoration:underline;">copper</span> , <span style="color:blue;text-decoration:underline;">aluminum</span> and <span style="color:blue;text-decoration:underline;">zinc</span> …etc<br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Now coming to the other point ,from the above quote ,we learn that Agniveer holds/believes that emission of seminal fluid is dirty and so is rubbing of dust, and reason he claims so is because of his belief that dust and semen are impure and dirty, or why would a person call rubbing of dust and emission of seminal fluid as being dirty , if he believed they <span style="text-decoration:underline;">were not dirty or pure</span>,so <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>the point to be note here is that Agniveer believes that &#8220;semen&#8221; and &#8220;dust&#8221; are dirty and impure.</strong></span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">But , does his so-called high sanitised standard prescribing hindu texts believe dust and semen to be impure and dirty?Inshaa&#8217;Allah we&#8217;ll have a look at this.<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:14pt;text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Hindu Scriptures state <span style="color:green;">&#8220;Semen&#8221;</span> and <span style="color:green;">&#8220;Dust&#8221;</span> to be <span style="color:red;">Pure</span> :</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Yajurveda Samhita states <em>&#8220;Semen&#8221; </em>to pure ,<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:14pt;"><span style="font-family:Bookman Old Style;font-size:10pt;">&#8220;O&#8217; all learned people fully realise your conduct towards different objects of the universe, know ye the electricity that maintains all beautiful objects, the aged sun, the invisible matter brought into creation, the invigorating vital airs, <span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;"><strong>pure semen</strong></span> and the noble, active suppressor of foes. Thus ye become the utilisers of all objects, and eaters of milk products.&#8221;</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Garamond;"><span style="font-size:9pt;">&#8211; (Yajurveda, Ch 8, verse 57, pg-90, Translated by Devi Chand</span></span></p>

</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">We read that Yajurveda clearly declares <em>&#8220;semen&#8221;</em> to be pure which is just the opposite what Mr.Plagiarist<em>(Agniveer)</em> believes and thus according to him seminal fluid is dirty and a human becomes dirty after ejaculation<span style="color:#99cc00;"><em>(well according to Islam after ejaculation of &#8220;Sperm&#8221;or having sexual intercourse, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">bathing is mandatory</span> but if water is not found dry ablution can be done or after ejaculation of prostatic-seminal fluid it needs to be washed and ablution is to be done and again if water isn&#8217;t available dry ablution can be done)</em></span>of it , well it also noteworthy to point that while the &#8220;holy&#8221; veda declare &#8220;semen&#8221; to be pure ,where as Vishnu Smriti states semen to be impure<span style="font-size:10pt;"><br />
<em>(Ch-22 ,verse 81)</em></span> so does the most authentic and respected Manu Smriti simply states it to be impure and Vishnu Smriti also states the same in(<span style="font-size:10pt;"> (Vishnu Smriti, Ch-22 , verse 81)</span>.<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />

</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Now, this is contraditory but its well known that vedas are considered<em>(amongst hindus)</em> the ultimate authority, hence usually their<em>(vedas)</em> position is accepted, another thing to note is again here , the Manu prescribes using of earth<em>(dust,soil)</em> which is considered dirty according to Agniveer.We&#8217;ll now have a brief look at whether the Hindu scriptures consider dust,earth,soil…etc as dirty or impure?<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />

<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Now , I would like our readers to have a brief look at, the prescribed ablution in the Hindu scriptures &#8211;<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:14pt;"><span style="font-family:Bookman Old Style;font-size:10pt;"><em>&#8220;</em>Another son<em><sup>* </sup></em> stationed in the borders of- the cheeks for 19 half a muhurta, O brahman, consumes every undertaking, and eulogium, and sincerity. By addresses to brahmans, by 20 praise to the gods, and by extracting roots, O brahman, <span style="color:red;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>by <span style="color:green;">ablutions <span style="color:red;">with cows&#8217; urine</span></span></strong></span> and mustard seed, so also by worship paid to the constellations and </span>planets, and also by the observance of righteousness and the Upanishads, by repeatedly looking at weapons, and by contempt for birth Ganda-pranta-rati succumbs.&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="margin-left:14pt;"><span style="font-family:Bookman Old Style;font-size:10pt;"> (<em><sup>* </sup></em>Ganda-pranta-rati – the Reveller in the borders of the cheeks.)</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="margin-left:14pt;"><span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:9pt;"> &#8211; [Markandeya Purana, Canto 51, verses 20-21,pg 259, Translated by F.Eden Pargiter, Published by the Asiatic Society, 1904]</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">This was the remedy given to people and against, the evil child Ganda-pranta-rati<em>( the Reveller in the borders of the cheeks)</em>of Duhsaha and born on Nirmashti.This is child like other childern<em>(of Duhsaha)</em> is almost personification of physical injuries, moral vices and social offences.In this case , the child Ganda-pranta-rati is stationed in the borders of cheeks and destroyes all the eulogia,praise and other deeds,hence the remedy is provided that is <span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;"><strong>ablutions with cows&#8217; urine!</strong></span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Ablution with filth and excreta is fair for hindus but with clean dust is objectionable, this is sarcasmm and quite biased approach which all hindus have.Also , earlier I&#8217;ve quoted many smritis which show hindu purificatory methods and penances like in <strong>Parashar Smriti</strong></span><span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:10pt;">(Ch 6 verses 32 – 33) </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">a Brahman<em>(Priestly caste man)</em> is prescribed to purify himself with sustaining on half-barley steeped in <span style="text-decoration:underline;">cow&#8217;s urine</span> for 10 nights, in case hw eat food that belongs to Chandala<em>(Outcast)</em> caste.Also in <strong>Vishnu Smriti</strong>(</span><span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:10pt;">Ch 22, verse 18)</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"> is states that a Sudra<em>(Servile or low caste man)</em> is <span style="text-decoration:underline;">bathe and drink</span> Pankagavya<em>( the five productions of a cow, consist of milk, sour milk, butter, <span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;">urine, and cow-dung</span>)</em> if he happen to eat the food of another Sudra who happened to be in impure state.And such penances and purifactory methods have also been prescribed in Manu Smriti and other scriptures, which have been already quote earlier in the article.<span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Summing up, its quite strange that Agniveer&#8217;s having problem with rational purification concepts and methods in Islam<em>(like using clean dust if water not available)</em> where as his own scriptures like shastras,puranas and vedas are filled with irrational,impractical concepts of purification<em>(like ablution and bathing with cows urine an dung…etc)</em> and statements for instance,respect people living in sandy places in truth respect should given to every one whether he lives in sandy,distant,green places or anywhere else, regardless of his place of living.And still we see people like Agniveer claiming Hinduism<em>(Vedic Dharma)</em> to be practical and Islam otherwise, whereas infactuality its Islam which is practical ,as we have seen so far and Inshaa&#8217;Allah will see throughout the treatise<em>(article). </em><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />

</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:red;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"><em>The third set of religions is the Eastern Religions. These are the oldest and foundation of almost all religious and philosophical thoughts including arabic cults. They include a variety of names like <strong>Hinduism</strong>, Sikhism, Jainism, Buddhism, Vedic Dharma, Sanatan Dharma etc. If Hindu be the term depicting region on eastern side of Indus river, then all these collectively come under the umbrella of Hinduism or Hindutva. There are a huge number of sub-sects and varieties in these broad terms mentioned above. For example, in Sikhs we have Namdharis, Nirankaris, Udasis etc. In Jainism we have Shwetambar, Digambars and various sub-sects. Same with other terms as well.</em></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:red;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"><em>Despite this myriad diversity, which at times appear contradictory on surface, there are certain common binding traits in all these religions under the fold of Hinduism:</em></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:red;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"><em>a. None of these religions were founded by visionaries as defined in previous section. The founders of these religions instead were supposed to be exalted souls who realized truth in their own way. Thus no follower is expected to blindly believe in anything but explore truth in their own honest ways.</em></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">It&#8217;s a pity to see that Agniveer finally accepts that the founders of all Easterly Religions were supposed to be exalted souls who realized truth in their own way.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">These religions were not a religion from God, but a distorted form of the religion of Islam by exalted souls who realized truth in their own way and this has been clearly explained above in the First section of this article.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

<p><span style="color:red;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;text-decoration:underline;"><strong>PATIENCE: </strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Imâm Ahmad said: &#8220;Allâh has mentioned patience in the Qur&#8217;ân in ninety places.&#8221; Here, we will list the different contexts in which patience appears.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Patience in enjoined upon believers: </strong></span><span style="color:#333399;">&#8220;And be patient for your patience is but by Allâh…&#8221;<span style="color:black;"> (<strong>an-Nahl 16:127</strong>).</span></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

<p><span style="color:#333399;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">&#8220;…and be patient and persevering: for Allâh is with those who patiently persevere&#8221;<span style="color:black;"> (<strong>al-Anfâl 8:46</strong>).</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Allâh has mentioned patience alongside the pillars of Islâm and îmân, as He has mentioned it </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"><strong>alongside sâlah:</strong><span style="color:#333399;"> &#8220;Nay, seek (Allâh&#8217;s) help with patient perseverance and prayer…&#8221;<span style="color:black;"> (<strong>al-Baqarah 2:45</strong>);</span></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"><strong>alongside compassion:</strong><span style="color:#333399;"> &#8220;…those who believe and enjoin patience, (constancy, and self-restraint), and enjoin deeds of kindness and compassion…&#8221;<span style="color:black;"> (<strong>al-Balad 90:17</strong>);</span></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Allâh has made patience the means for attaining His love, His companionship, His help and support, and His good rewards. This is sufficient honour and blessings.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

<p><span style="color:red;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;text-decoration:underline;"><strong>FORGIVENESS:</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Correct and courteous words <span style="text-decoration:underline;">accompanied by forgiveness</span> are better than sadaqa followed by insulting words.

</span></span></p>

<span style="color:#333399;">&#8211; Cut off (from the wrist joint) the (right) hand of the thief, male or female, as a recompense for that which they committed, a punishment by way of example from Allah.

<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Islam enjoins that we offer our prayer in a state of Purity:</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"><strong>Qur&#8217;an 4:43</strong><span style="color:#333399;"> &#8211; O you who believe!

And if you are ill, or on a journey, or one of you comes after answering the call of nature, or you have been in contact with women (by sexual relations) and you find no water, perform Tayammum with clean earth and rub therewith your faces and hands (Tayammum). Truly, Allah is Ever OftPardoning, OftForgiving.</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">We are told not to eat Maytatah (a dead animal) or blood poured forth (by slaughtering or the like), or the flesh of swine (pork, etc.) for that surely is impure….<span style="color:black;"> (<strong>Qur&#8217;an 6:145</strong>)</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">From the above analogy, the Hindus undergo cycle of birth and death is because their souls are ignorant. Because had their soul not been ignorant, then they would have been like Muslims.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">If we look at it in a different angle, the Hindu souls are really ignorant about the truth of God, our only creator and the purpose of life in this world.

</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Human beings have the best faculty of reasoning and understanding. How a lame claim is that &#8216;human being is not expected to understand the complete truth in this life&#8217;.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Moreover, if a human doesn&#8217;t understand truth in this life, then according to your Birth-Rebirth Policy, he may not get another chance to understand and improve, because he doesn&#8217;t know whether he will be given a life of an animal, bird or human in the next supposedly life.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Now since a human according to you is not expected to understand the complete truth in this life, then it is obvious that he will commit sins and mistakes, and hence chances are less that he will again be born as a human.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Suppose that he is not born as a human, then he will not be able to understand the truth even more in his subsequent lives, because no other species has the sense to understand and reason more than a human.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">So you see, according to this Birth-Rebirth Policy, that person who had been born in some other form in his next life will again be born in an inferior form and again and again continue being born as inferior species, because his sense of understanding will subsequently go on decreasing continuously as he is being born in inferior species and he will not be able to understand the truth as because humans (the best advanced species) is not supposed to understand the Truth completely. This means that no one will attain the so called Moksha.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">We Muslims are commanded to offer Salaah (prayer) to Allah at least 5 times a day. During our Salaah we are in a state more advanced than meditation. We are in contact and communication with Our Creator. This not only purifies our soul, but also makes us realize the ultimate truth and bliss which we get by submitting our self to our creator.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

Therefore, there is no need to force anyone to embrace Islam. Rather, whoever Allah directs to Islam, opens his heart for it and enlightens his mind, will embrace Islam with certainty. Whoever Allah blinds his heart and seals his hearing and sight, then he will not benefit from being forced to embrace Islam.&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

<p><span style="color:#333399;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Well there is a very well known proverb which says:<span style="color:black;"> &#8220;<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Ulta Chor Kotwaal Ko daante</span>&#8221; <span style="color:#333399;">(The one who is a thief when asked, blames the Master).</span></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">The &#8216;Malpractices&#8217; of the Hindu&#8217;s of doing &#8216;Idol Worship&#8217; was taken up by some so called Muslims, and the result is quite obvious that we have people calling themselves Muslims, but still visiting &#8216;Graves&#8217; and &#8216;Shrines&#8217; to ask for help. These  Muslims are completely ignorant about the definition of a Muslim and also ignorant about the teachings of the Qur&#8217;an.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Like Christians ask from Jesus Christ (pbuh), similarly many so called Muslims have over exaggerated in praising Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) and asks from him rather than from the only true God.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">All these are contrary to the teachings of Islam and contrary to the guidance taught by our last and final Prophet Muhammad (pbuh).</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">All these were effects and &#8216;Malpractices&#8217; which intoxicated the Pure Religion, when Islam came to India. This was not the case from the beginning.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">It is quite evident that who introduced &#8216;Malpractices&#8217; whether, the Arabs or the one&#8217;s trying to malign and mix in the original religion, of submitting to God.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Wrong again! Neither Jainism, nor Buddhism nor Sikhism considers Vedas to be supreme.

<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Well, the supremecy battle in Hinduism is really interesting.

<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Surely this will not be a religion from our creator. Our Creator is the one who created us and surely He didn&#8217;t forget to choose the right way/religion for us. Why do we need to erect such religions then? This is the very reason which has resulted into coming up of different religions out of the only religion of submitting to God.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

<a title="http://agniveer.com/2697/why-vedas-cannot-be-changed/" href="http://agniveer.com/2697/why-vedas-cannot-be-changed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right"><span style="color:black;text-decoration:underline;">http://agniveer.com/2697/why-vedas-cannot-be-changed/</span><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Well I need to inform the people reading this that the Holy Qur&#8217;an, not only was it written down at the time of Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) but also memorized in seven different styles by many Huffaz and today there exist thousands of people who have the Qur&#8217;an in their hearts, the way it was revealed, even the pronunciation is saved. Bothe the memorized one and the written one matches exactly and has been the same since 1400 years ago.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Qur&#8217;an was written down as well as memorized while the Vedas as claimed by Arya Samajis were only memorized. The oldest of manuscripts of Vedas belonging to the Vajasaneyi tradition are dated from the 11th century onwards.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Even some Acharya of Hindus says that only 6% Vedas has been left now and in this age there is no use of them</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><a title="http://truthofhinduism.com/general/hinduism-scipturesbattle-supremacy/" href="/index.php/2014/05/14/hindu-scriptures-battle-of-supremacy/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;text-decoration:underline;">http://truthofhinduism.com/general/hinduism-scipturesbattle-supremacy/</span></a><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">This proves which of the books have greater chances of been preserved.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"><span style="color:#333399;">Forcing a religion or a Book is also prohibited in Islam, as explained earlier. Allah said in</span><br />
<span style="color:black;"><strong>Chapter 2 verse 256</strong></span>,</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">﴿لاَ إِكْرَاهَ فِى الدِّينِ﴾</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">(There is no compulsion in religion)</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Agniveer&#8217;s claim that the Vedas have been passed on till generations and is the same which their fathers and forefathers followed. They believe on it blindly even though it contains facts which go against established science. Allah answers this issue very well,</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"><span style="color:black;"><strong>Qur&#8217;an 43:22-24</strong></span> &#8211; <span style="color:#333399;">Nay! They say: &#8220;We found our fathers following a certain way and religion, and we guide ourselves by their footsteps.&#8221;And similarly, We sent not a warner before you (O Muhammad SAW) to any town (people) but the luxurious ones among them said: &#8220;We found our fathers following a certain way and religion, and we will indeed follow their footsteps.&#8221;(The warner) said: &#8220;Even if I bring you better guidance than that which you found your fathers following?&#8221; They said: &#8220;Verily, We disbelieve in that with which you have been sent.&#8221;</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"><span style="color:black;"><strong>Qur&#8217;an  2:170</strong></span> &#8211; <span style="color:#333399;">When it is said to them: &#8220;Follow what Allah has sent down.&#8221; They say: &#8220;Nay! We shall follow what we found our fathers following.&#8221; (Would they do that!) Even though their fathers did not understand anything nor were they guided?</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"><span style="color:black;"><strong>Qur&#8217;an  5:104</strong></span> &#8211; <span style="color:#333399;">And when it is said to them: &#8220;Come to what Allah has revealed and unto the Messenger (Muhammad SAW for the verdict of that which you have made unlawful).&#8221; They say: &#8220;Enough for us is that which we found our fathers following,&#8221; even though their fathers had no knowledge whatsoever and no guidance.</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:red;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"><em>Name of book, thus is not important. But the knowledge is. Let everyone follow the universal religion and whatever be the truth, we shall be guided towards that automatically in proportion to our efforts. </em></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:red;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"><em>Till the intelligent among us work towards such a performa of universal religion, neither shall we be able to discover the mystery behind life, nor can there be peace in world. What shall remain is only the jungle rule of those who desire dominance in name of religion through politics, force or deceit. </em></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:red;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"><em>Mere declaration that all religions are good, would be a fruitless exercise as we all internally know that this cannot be the case. A more sensible approach would be to actually work towards a truly good religion – a universal religion – through consensus and deliberations and then let that be the ONLY religion sufficient for human beings. As mentioned earlier, each society/ individual should be given liberty to fill in minor details as per their own needs, without transgressing the overall framework.</em></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"><em>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</em></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"><strong>Response:</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Of course name of the book is not important, but the knowledge is. So how will one come to have knowledge of what is the truth and the right way? We have to be practical and assess all the religious scriptures and then ultimately we will come to the truth.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">All religions are not equal, but they have some good things in them In the first section it has been proven as to why these religions are not equal and why they preach goodness.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">As told earlier we humans are no one to select what is best for us. We are no one to arrive at a consensus of selecting or creating any new religion because what is good for some may not be good for others. So this theory of giving each society/individual a liberty to fill in details so that a new religion can be formed is really a faulty philosophy.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Remember truth can only be one. Search it before it is too late.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">May we be guided to the truth by the guidance of our creator. May we strive and achieve the truth without an unbiased mind.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#ff6600;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Our last call is all praise is to Allah and may His Salah and Salam be upon our Prophet Muhammad and his family.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

Majority of us fail to understand the apparent confusion of so many religions, all seemingly claiming to be best. Religion has become the prime pretext for all the violence, terrorism, fights and havoc all around the world. Religion seems to be the primary theme governing the world politics and society, yet most of us do not know what exactly it is all about. Most of us simply know the names of major religions – <strong>Hinduism</strong>, Islam, Christianity, Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism, Bahai etc and keep hearing how basically all teach the same good things and how all religions are equal. We also keep hearing lot of irrational stuff from all religions and hence tend to believe somewhere deep inside that it should not be taken so seriously.</em></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Agniveer again shows his biasness and ignorance by claiming that Islam has been founded by a Prophet who saw things we could not see.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">The religion of Islam is the Religion which our God chose for us. No prophet founded it. It existed since time immemorial as is apparent from the First Part of this article: </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><a href="/2015/06/23/religion-demystified-demystifying-religion-in-true-sense-part-1/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="color:blue;text-decoration:underline;">http://www.systemoflife.com/answering-islamophobes/agniveer/224-religion-demystified-part-1-demystifying-religion-in-true-sense</span></a><br />

</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Well as regards to Prophets having mirage, then Agniveer should be well aware that &#8216;mirage is caused due to Reflection produced by bending of light rays coming from an already present object&#8217;. A mirage is a naturally occurring optical phenomenon in which light rays are bent to produce a displaced image of distant objects or the sky. </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Mirage is different from illusions. Things seen in Mirage do really exist, though not at that place but somewhere near that place, the reflection of which is seen as mirage. If that thing does not exist, then it&#8217;s mirage is not possible. Mirages are not illusions.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">So Agniveer wanted to prove by referring to Prophets having mirage that the Prophets description about miracles, Hell, heaven etc were &#8216;mirage&#8217; which Agniveer thought were illusions and not true.  But unfortunately, even if it was mirage (which is not the true case) then also the revelations and phenomenon and miracles were true, because mirage occurs only if that thing is present in reality.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"><strong>Response:</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"><span style="color:#333399;">Yes there is only One God who is our creator and the only one worthy to be thanked and worshipped.</span> (See the <strong>Qur&#8217;an Chapter 112 verse 1-4</strong>)</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"><span style="color:#333399;">The Qur&#8217;an mentions in several places that Allah created the heavens and the earth in six</span> &#8220;ayam&#8221; (aeons) <span style="color:#333399;">and then Istawa (rose over) the Throne (in a manner that suits His Majesty). One such verse is:</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"><strong>The Qur&#8217;an Surah Hadid Chapter 57 verse 4</strong>:</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">He it is Who created the heavens and the earth in six &#8220;ayam&#8221; (aeons) and then Istawa (rose over) the Throne (in a manner that suits His Majesty). He knows what goes into the earth and what comes forth from it, what descends from the heaven and what ascends thereto. And He is with you (by His Knowledge) wheresoever you may be. And Allah is the All-Seer of what you do.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"><span style="color:#333399;">The correct meaning in this verse is</span> &#8220;aeons&#8221; <span style="color:#333399;">for the Arabic term</span> &#8220;ayam,&#8221;<span style="color:#333399;"> which shows that heavens where created in 6 aeons, 6 long periods of time. Science does not contradict this at all, due to the fact there Science says it COULD have been created in 6 aeons.</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"><span style="color:#333399;">Allah is above the throne as</span><br />
<strong>Surah Hadid 57:4</strong><br />
<span style="color:#333399;">says, and it also symbolic that he has authority and rose over the throne, the throne of authority, signifying that he is the One and only creator of everything. Allah is LITERALLY above the throne, which no-one can imagine or see and which is nothing like us.</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">God sent Prophets to every nation, not only to guide and warn the less privileged people but also the privileged ones.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">By saying &#8216;Only by following the most latest prophet can one go to Heaven&#8217; Agniveer wanted to say that the diffenet prophets preached different things.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Again a blatant misconception/misinformation showing the biasness of Agniveer. Nowhere does the Qur&#8217;an or any authentic Ahadith says that questioning the prophet is like insulting God and will make us eligible for Hell.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">On the Contrary Islam encourages questioning, questions related to faith, Qur&#8217;an etc.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Islam forbids useless questions which were asked to the prophet (pbuh) like <strong>`who is my father?&#8217; `Where is my camel?</strong>&#8216;<strong> etc.</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">People used to ask such useless questions to the Messenger of Allah to mock him<strong>.</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Allah said in<span style="color:black;"><br />
<strong>Chapter 5 verse 101</strong>,</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">O you who believe! Ask not about things which, if made plain to you, may cause you trouble. But if you ask about them while the Quran is being revealed, they will be made plain to you. Allah has forgiven that, and Allah is Oft Forgiving, Most Forbearing.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">This Ayah refers to good conduct that Allah is teaching His believing servants, by forbidding them from asking about useless things. Since if they get the answers they sought, they might be troublesome for them and difficult on their ears. Al-Bukhari recorded that Anas bin Malik said, &#8220;The Messenger of Allah gave a speech unlike anything I heard before. In this speech, he said,</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">«لَو تَعْلَمُونَ مَا أَعْلَمُ، لَضَحِكْتُمْ قَلِيلًا، وَلَبَكَيْتُمْ كَثِيرًا»</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">(If you but know what I know, you will laugh little and cry a lot.) The companions of Allah&#8217;s Messenger covered their faces and the sound of crying was coming out of their chests. A man asked, `Who is my father&#8217; The Prophet said, `So-and-so&#8217;. This Ayah was later revealed,</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">﴿لاَ تَسْأَلُواْ عَنْ أَشْيَآءَ﴾</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">(Ask not about things&#8230;).&#8221; Muslim, Ahmad, At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasa&#8217;i recorded this Hadith.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Anas bin Malik narrated that once, the people were questioning the Messenger of Allah until they made him angry. So he ascended the Minbar and said,</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">«لَا تَسْأَلُونِي الْيَوْمَ عَنْ شَيْءٍ إِلَّا بَيَّنْتُهُ لَكُم»</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">(You will not ask me about anything today but I will explain it to you.) So the Companions of the Messenger of Allah feared that it was the commencement of a momentous event, and I looked to my right and left and found only people who covered their faces, crying. An argumentative man who was said to be the son of someone other than his true father asked, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Messenger! Who is my father The Prophet said, `Your father is Hudhafah.&#8221; `Umar stood up (when he saw anger on the Prophet&#8217;s face) and said, &#8220;We accept Allah as our Lord, Islam as our religion and Muhammad as our Messenger, I seek refuge with Allah from the evil of the Fitan (trials in life and religion).&#8221; The Messenger of Allah said,</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">«لَمْ أَرَ فِي الْخَيْرِ وَالشَّرِّ كَالْيَومِ قَطُّ، صُوِّرَتْ لِي الجَنَّةُ وَالنَّارُ حَتَّى رَأَيْتُهُمَا دُونَ الْحَائِط»</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">(I have never witnessed both goodness and evil like I have today. Paradise and the Fire were shown to me and I saw them before that wall.) This Hadith was recorded in the Two Sahihs from Sa`id. Al-Bukhari recorded that Ibn `Abbas said, &#8220;Some people used to question the Messenger of Allah to mock him. One of them would ask, `Who is my father,&#8217; while another would ask, `Where is my camel,&#8217; when he lost his camel. Allah sent down this Ayah about them.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">People used to question the Messenger of Allah to mock him, like `who is my father?&#8217; `Where is my camel?&#8217; etc.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"><strong>Such Useless questioning is prohibited in Islam. This verse of the Qur&#8217;an prohibits useless questions, and simultaneously encourages questioning about the verses of the Qur&#8217;an being revealed.</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">No big deal in that. It is quite logical. Yes this life is the only life. A person if he wants to improve, has to improve within this lifetime. If not, he will have to bear the punishment.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Now a days we find Hindu terrorists reigning supreme be it LTTE or any other group. I think this is because they think, that they have countless umber of lives and chances to improve. Let&#8217;s enjoy this life and we will improve in the next life. Let&#8217;s propagate false notions about various religions and degrade the inborn religion, Islam, hiding behind the bush, because we have many births to improve ourselves. We will not be questioned. We are not being tested.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">I think that this is the reason Priests like Swami Nityananda and many much more swamis have started their business of Sex-trading.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">It&#8217;s really pathetic!</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">The concept of &#8216;this life being the only life&#8217; and the result being &#8216;Hell or Heaven&#8217; is more logical rather than the concept of the cycle of birth and rebirth as propounded by the Hindus.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">If a class 10th student is told by his father that if he is doesn&#8217;t pass in the first attempt then he will be compelled to discontinue his studies. Then, how he will study? He will put all his efforts to pass exam in his first attempt itself. On contrary, those who think they have many attempts will put less effort.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Hell is eternal for only disbelievers. Any believer, after being punished for his sins in the Hell, will eventually at some point of time, be made dwellers of Heaven.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Every nation lays down certain rules and regulations for it&#8217;s citizens to follow. If one follows the basic regulations, then he is eligible to enjoy all the rights of the nation.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">If he violates certain regulations, then he commits a crime. He has to go through the penalty for sometime and after that he is free to enjoy the rights of that nation.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">If he violates all the basic regulations since the beginning and even after knowing his fault that he is going against the nation&#8217;s conduct, he violates the law just to serve his vain desires, then he is eligible for strict punishment only and can never enjoy the rights of the nation.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

<p><span style="color:#333399;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">There are several Ayat testifying to the fact that Allah alone is the One Who guides and misguides, and similarly several authentic Ahadith and verse in the Qur&#8217;an <span style="color:black;">(<strong>Surah Ahzab Chapter 33 verse 40</strong>)<span style="color:#333399;"> that Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) is the last of all messengers and apostle, contrary to the belief of the Qadiyani sect. They rely on their unclear understanding of an Ayat, thus avoiding what is clear and contradicts their desires. Theirs is the method of the people who follow their lust, desire and wickedness. An authentic Hadith narrated,</span></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">«إِذَا رَأَيْتُمُ الَّذِينَ يَتَّبِعُونَ مَا تَشَابَهَ مِنْهُ فَأُولئِكَ الَّذِينَ سَمَّى اللهُ فَاحْذَرُوهُمْ»</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">(When you see those who follow what is not so clear in it (the Qur&#8217;an), then they are those whom Allah has mentioned<span style="color:black;"> (<strong>refer to 3:7</strong>)<span style="color:#333399;">. Hence, avoid them.)</span></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">The Prophet was referring to Allah&#8217;s statement,</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Verily, no innovator in the religion could ever rely on any authentic evidence in the Qur&#8217;an that testifies to his innovation. The Qur&#8217;an came to distinguish between truth and falsehood, and guidance and misguidance.

<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">As explained earlier, Islam is the true and pure religion, from our Only Creator. It has no divisions. Those who have divided the religion or derived any New religion out of it, is surely going against the Qur&#8217;an and is diverting from true guidance. A true Muslim is the One following the Qur&#8217;an and the authentic sayings and guidance of the Messengers. There are many who claim to follow these but their practices and beliefs clearly contradicts the Qur&#8217;an.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

<strong>Qur&#8217;an in Chapter 6 verse 159</strong>: <span style="color:#333399;">Verily, those who divide their religion and break up into sects (all kinds of religious sects), you (O Muhammad SAW) have no concern in them in the least. Their affair is only with Allah, Who then will tell them what they used to do.</span></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"><strong>Qur&#8217;an 3: 103</strong> &#8211; <span style="color:#333399;">And hold fast, all of you together, to the Rope of Allah (i.e. this Quran), and <span style="text-decoration:underline;">be not divided</span> among yourselves,</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Surely those who deny the verses of the Qur&#8217;an, then whoever he might be, is not on true guidance.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">It is hard to see that among the options given for one in the West to select the True Religion, Agniveer didn&#8217;t mention Hinduism. I guess, he agrees that Hinduism is actually teachings of men, not of the Almighty God and the Western people knows this fact that they cannot be fooled with illogical Hinduism.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Truly, the religion with Allah is (submitting your will to Allah) Islam. Those who were given the Scripture (Jews and Christians) did not differ except, out of mutual jealousy, after knowledge had come to them.

<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">We Muslims, are commanded to inform others of the Truth of Islam, their inborn religion.

<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">(There is no compulsion in religion), meaning, &#8220;Do not force anyone to become Muslim, for Islam is plain and clear, and its proofs and evidence are plain and clear. Therefore, there is no need to force anyone to embrace Islam. Rather, whoever Allah directs to Islam, opens his heart for it and enlightens his mind, will embrace Islam with certainty. Whoever Allah blinds his heart and seals his hearing and sight, then he will not benefit from being forced to embrace Islam.&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">If we convey the message and the seeker of Truth realizes that Islam is the ultimate truth, then this is not called converting.

<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Only at times of war, when the disbelievers have cheated, then only Muslims are commanded to fight the disbelievers, but if they demand peace, reconciliation, then Muslims are ordered to be tolerant to them even at times of war.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Allah forbids unnecessary attacking or hurting the disbelievers.

Asma&#8217; refused to accept her mother&#8217;s gifts and did not let her enter her house. `A&#8217;ishah asked the Prophet about his verdict and Allah sent down the Ayah,<span style="color:black;"><br />

<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Islam is Alhamdolillah the Most tolerant of all religions, because it is the Only religion (the religion of submitting yourself to Almighty God) which our Creator chose for us.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Again the illiteracy of Agniveer is prominent when he claims that One has to blindly believe in all this to escape Hell and achieve Heaven.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Allah shows signs everywhere about the truth of Islam being the only religion of Our Creator. Among the six articles of faith there is not one which says that we have to believe in these miracles, even though these are true, to go to Heaven.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Moses (pbuh) did split the Red Sea with Allah&#8217;s permission.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Jesus (pbuh) was born miraculously without any male intervention, but by Allah&#8217;s permission.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Jesus (pbuh) was not crucified. He has been raised up alive and will come before the Day of Judgment.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Muhammad (pbuh) did split the moon.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Muhammad (pbuh) did go for Miraj, but not on a girl-faced donkey and neither through Miraj travels (which Agniveer falsely says without any proof. Agniveer&#8217;s lies are quite evident)</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Not only Muhammad (pbuh), every prophet of Allah received revelations.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">All these were Signs, rather than miracles. In the description of these events, The Qur&#8217;an does not use the technical Arabic word for miracle<span style="color:black;"><br />
<strong>المعجزات</strong> (Muadjiza)<span style="color:#333399;"> literally meaning &#8220;that by means of which [the Prophet] confounds, overwhelms, his opponents&#8221;. It rather uses the term &#8216;Ayah&#8217; (literally meaning sign).</span></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Though these are Signs performed with Allah&#8217;s permission, It is not an article of faith to believe in them to attain Paradise.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">But a believer believes that Allah can show us any signs if He wills.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">The Qur&#8217;an itself is a miracle. Moreover, there are numerous scientific miracles also mentioned in the Qur&#8217;an.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Islam is never silent on any issues if it is an important matter or a matter of concern, because it is the only universal religion not bounded to any specific types of people, region etc.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">One verse from the Word of Our Creator, the<span style="color:black;"><br />
<strong>Qur&#8217;an Chapter 6 verse 38</strong><br />
<span style="color:#333399;">answers your queries and reminds that Allah never neglects anything:</span></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">There is not a moving (living) creature on earth, nor a bird that flies with its two wings, but are communities like you. We have neglected nothing in the Book, then unto their Lord they (all) shall be gathered.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Allah&#8217;s statement,</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">﴿مَّا فَرَّطْنَا فِى الكِتَـبِ مِن شَىْءٍ﴾</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">(We have neglected nothing in the Book,) means, the knowledge about all things is with Allah, and He never forgets any of His creatures, nor their sustenance, nor their affairs, whether these creatures live in the sea or on land. In another Ayah, Allah said;</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">﴿وَمَا مِن دَآبَّةٍ فِي الاٌّرْضِ إِلاَّ عَلَى اللَّهِ رِزْقُهَا وَيَعْلَمُ مُسْتَقَرَّهَا وَمُسْتَوْدَعَهَا كُلٌّ فِى كِتَابٍ مُّبِينٍ ﴾</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">(And no moving creature is there on earth but its provision is due from Allah. And He knows its dwelling place and its deposit (in the uterus, grave, etc.). All is in a Clear Book.) ﴿<span style="color:black;"><strong>11:6</strong><span style="color:#333399;">﴾, there is a record of their names, numbers, movements, and lack of movement.</span></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">﴾Ibn Abi Hatim reported that Ibn `Abbas said about the<span style="color:black;"><br />
<strong>Qur&#8217;an Chapter 6 ayah 38</strong>,</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">﴿ثُمَّ إِلَى رَبِّهِمْ يُحْشَرُونَ﴾</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">(then unto their Lord they (all) shall be gathered.) &#8220;Death gathers them.&#8221; It was also said that the Day of Resurrection gathers them, for in another Ayah, Allah said;</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">﴿وَإِذَا الْوُحُوشُ حُشِرَتْ ﴾</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">(And when the wild beasts shall be gathered together.) ﴿<span style="color:black;"><strong>81:5</strong><span style="color:#333399;">﴾ `Abdur-Razzaq recorded that Abu Hurayrah said about Allah&#8217;s statement,</span></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">﴿إِلاَّ أُمَمٌ أَمْثَـلُكُمْ مَّا فَرَّطْنَا فِى الكِتَـبِ مِن شَىْءٍ ثُمَّ إِلَى رَبِّهِمْ يُحْشَرُونَ﴾</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">(but are Umam like you. We have neglected nothing in the Book, then unto their Lord they (all) shall be gathered.) &#8220;All creatures will be gathered on the Day of Resurrection, the beasts, birds and all others.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">The Qur&#8217;an applies the word &#8220;<span style="color:black;"><strong>Muslim</strong><span style="color:#333399;">&#8221; not only to humans but also to animals and the inanimate world. &#8220;The divine will manifests itself in the form of laws both in human society and in the world of nature.&#8221; In Islamic terminology, for example, a bee is a Muslim precisely because it lives and dies obeying the sharia that God has prescribed for the community of bees, just as a person is a Muslim by virtue of the fact that he or she submits to the revealed sharia ordained for humans in the Qur&#8217;an and Sunnah.</span></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">This fact is very much clear by the verse of the <span style="color:black;"><strong>Qur&#8217;an Chapter 22 verse 18</strong><br />
<span style="color:#333399;">where Allah says,</span></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">See you not that to Allah prostrates whoever is in the heavens and whoever is on the earth, and the sun, and the moon, and the stars, and the mountains, and the trees, and Ad-Dawab (moving living creatures, beasts, etc.), and many of mankind? But there are many (men) on whom the punishment is justified. And whomsoever Allah disgraces, none can honour him. Verily! Allah does what He wills.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Animals and other living things were created by Allah, the Lord of the Universe. They have their own independent existences and modes of living.  <span style="color:black;">(<strong>55:10</strong>)</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Allah says in<strong><br />
<span style="color:black;">The Qur&#8217;an in 3:185, 21:35 and 29:57</span></strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">&#8220;Every soul shall have a taste of death in the end to us shall you be brought back.&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">It is quite clear from the above verse that anything which has a soul will die. We know that plants die, we know that animals die, so they all have souls. And all of them will be returned to Allah and assembled together on the day of Judgment.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Many passages from the Qur&#8217;an and Ahadith state that all animals are endowed with spirit and mind and &#8220;…there is ample evidence in the Qur&#8217;an to suggest that animals&#8217; consciousness of spirit and mind is of a degree higher than mere instinct and intuition. We are told in the Qur&#8217;an that animals have a cognizance of their Creator and, hence, they pay their obeisance to Him by adoration and worship: Seest thou not that it is Allah Whose praises are celebrated by all beings in the heavens and on earth, and by the birds with extended wings? Each one knows its prayer and psalm, And Allah is aware of what they do.<span style="color:black;"> (<strong>Qur&#8217;an 24:41</strong>).</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">It is worth noting the statement that &#8216;each one knows its prayer and psalm&#8217;. The execution of a voluntary act, performed consciously and intentionally, requires a faculty higher than that of instinct and intuition. Lest some people should doubt that animals could have such a faculty, the following verse points out that it is human ignorance that prevents them from understanding this phenomenon: The seven heavens and the earth and all things therein declare His glory. There is not a thing but celebrates His adoration; and yet ye mankind! ye understand not how do they declare His glory…<span style="color:black;">(<strong>Qur&#8217;an 17:44</strong>).</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"><strong> Response:</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Wrong again !</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">No sensible Person will question against the Qur&#8217;an. If in doubt, one can surely question and ask the people and learned men who knows as is mentioned in the <strong>Qur&#8217;an 16:43</strong>.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Qur&#8217;an forbids unnecessary useless questions as already discussed earlier in answer to point (e).</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Again a lie that Muslim clerics can tolerate questioning of Allah, but not of Prophet. I don&#8217;t know how biased a person like Agniveer can be. He is claiming to be unbiased and on the other hand giving information about Hinduism in the disguise of Islam.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">See again answer to point (e).</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">If anyone starts examining the Qur&#8217;an critically then Insha&#8217;allah he/she will accept Islam, leave aside questioning as had been the case with many reverts to Islam. This is the reason Arya Samajis like Agniveer, and all those who are biased and bent on deviating people from the truth , don&#8217;t read or critically examine the Qur&#8217;an as a whole, because if they do so, they will insha&#8217;allah accept Islam.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">But as is obvious, Agniveer&#8217;s mission in this birth life and all his supposed cycles, is to hinder people from the Truth.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>

</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#003366;"><span style="font-family:Arial;"><span style="font-size:12pt;"> </span><span style="color:#333399;"><span style="font-size:10pt;">After going through Agniveer&#8217;s article, I found the need to really Demystify Religion in Real sense critically.</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;"><span style="font-family:Arial;"><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span><span style="color:black;font-size:18pt;"><strong>&#8216;Religion&#8217; what it actually means ?</strong></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">The word religion is sometimes used interchangeably with faith or belief system, but religion differs from private belief in that it has a public aspect.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">A religion, if it has to be from our Creator, Almighty God, it has to be universal and not bound and based to any &#8216;Man&#8217;, &#8216;Place&#8217;, &#8216;Region&#8217; and it cannot have any other founder except our Creator, Almighty God. It has to be a natural disposition. A natural realization, a natural instinct, a natural bond between us and our creator, which has to exist from the time the first man stepped on this world. It can not be founded later on.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">As soon as We begin to describe any religion as &#8216;the religion of the Hindus or Muslims&#8217;, or &#8216;the religion following the teachings of so and so&#8217;, or &#8216;the religion founded by so and so, except the True God&#8217;, or &#8216;the religion founded so many years back&#8217; we introduces a category which does not fit, the category of &#8216;religion&#8217;.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Having said this, let us look at some of the major religions and their possibilities of being the universal religion from Our creator.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#ff1975;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"><strong>Hinduism<span style="color:#333399;"> =</span></strong> According to Agniveer, Hinduism is the collection of Easterly Religion. It is a blanket term for an assortmen<span style="color:#333399;">t of religious beliefs whose founders were supposed to be exalted souls who realized truth in their own way. (See Agniveer&#8217;s same article under the heading Easterly Religion/Hinduism point (a)). It&#8217;s a Strange fact, but True, that even Agniveer believes that their so called religion was founded by exalted souls, and Not by our Creator, Almighty God.</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">&#8216;Hindu&#8217; is actually a Persian word that stands for the inhabitants of the region beyond the Indus Valley. Thus it is also cultural and region specific and hence cannot be a universal religion, existing from time immemorial.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#ff1975;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"><strong>Christianity</strong><span style="color:#333399;"> = Christianity (from the Greek word <span style="color:black;">Xριστός<span style="color:#333399;">, <span style="color:black;">Khristos<span style="color:#333399;">, &#8220;<span style="color:black;">Christ<span style="color:#333399;">&#8220;, literally &#8220;<span style="color:black;">anointed one<span style="color:#333399;">&#8220;) is a (supposedly) monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus of Nazareth as presented in the New Testament.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Here again we find that this religion is based on the teachings of a &#8216;Man&#8217; and hence Not founded by our Creator, Almighty God. People before Christ were not christians. Hence we find this is time specific religion.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#ff1975;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"><strong>Sikhism</strong><span style="color:#333399;"> = Sikhism is a monotheistic religion founded in the fifteenth century Punjab on the teachings of Guru Nanak Dev Ji and ten successive Sikh Gurus (the last one being the sacred text Guru Granth Sahib Ji)</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Same as above. Founded in the 15th century and based on the teachings of mortal &#8216;Men&#8217;, so it can not be a religion of God, because religion of God has to exist from the beginning.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">A Sikh is a disciple of the Guru (Guru Nanak and 10 successive Gurus). Again it is a person specific religion.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#ff1975;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"><strong>Buddhism</strong><span style="color:#333399;"> = Buddhism is a religion and philosophy encompassing a variety of traditions, beliefs and practices, largely based on teachings attributed to Siddhartha Gautama, commonly known as the Buddha (Pāli/Sanskrit &#8220;the awakened one&#8221;). The Buddha lived and taught in the northeastern Indian subcontinent some time between the 6th and 4th centuries BCE. Indigenous sources use terms like Dharma (&#8216;the Law&#8217;), Buddha-dharma (&#8216;Buddhist doctrine&#8217;), Buddha-śāsana (&#8216;teachings of the Buddha&#8217;) and Buddhavacana (&#8216;the word of the Buddha&#8217;).</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Same as above. A follower of Gautam Buddha, would be called a Buddhist. It is &#8216;Person&#8217; specific.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#ff1975;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"><strong>Jainism</strong><span style="color:#333399;"> = Jainism is an Indian religion that prescribes a path of non-violence towards all living beings. Its philosophy and practice emphasize the necessity of self-effort to move the soul towards divine consciousness and liberation. Jain Religion is not an apauruseya religion, i.e., a religion propounded by a non-human being or based on a sacred book of non-human origin. On the contrary it is a religion of purely human origin and is preached by one who has attained omniscience and self-control by his own personal efforts. In short, Jain Religion is the substance of the preaching of those perfect souls who have attained the state of Jainas.</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Again it is clearly, a religion not by Our Creator, Almighty God and is also not a religion which existed since time immemorial.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#ff1975;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"><strong>Zoroastrianism</strong><span style="color:#333399;"> = Zoroastrianism is a religion and philosophy based on the teachings of prophet Zoroaster (also known as Zarathustra, in Avestan). It was probably founded some time before the 6th century B.C. in Persia (Iran).</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Same as above. It is quite interesting to note that If many teachings and concepts within the Vedas are similar to those of Zoroastrian religion, and hence it is not surprising enough to conclude that Vedic Religion has been derived from Zoroastrianism, because the Parsis (Zoroastrians) consider their religion older than the Vedic Religion</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>

</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:red;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"><strong>Islam<span style="color:#333399;"><br />
</span></strong>= The word <span style="color:black;"><strong>إسلام</strong><span style="color:#333399;"> Islām is derived from Arabic triconsonantal root sīn-lām-mīm (SLM [<strong><br />
<span style="color:black;">س ل م</span></strong><span style="color:#333399;"> ])., meaning &#8220;submission&#8221; (i.e. entrusting one&#8217;s wholeness to the only one and True God). &#8220;One who submits&#8221; is signified by the participle <span style="color:black;"><strong>مسلم</strong><span style="color:#333399;">, Muslim (fem. <span style="color:black;"><strong>مسلمة</strong><span style="color:#333399;">, muslimah).</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">We Muslims refer to our creator, Almighty God with the name &#8220;Allah&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">This religion is not bound to any person, place, region, space etc and is neither defined in terms of these restrictions and limits contrary to the literal meanings of the various world&#8217;s major religions. This religion is not bound to anything except Our Creator.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:18pt;"><strong>Then which is actually the True Religion ?</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">For what does &#8216;Religion&#8217; now mean to the occidental? At best, for the ordinary man, it means a way of spending an hour or so on Sundays in practices which give him some support and strength in dealing with the problems of daily life, and which encourages him to be friendly towards other persons and to maintain the standards of sexual propriety; it has little or nothing to do with commerce or economics or politics or industrial relationships. At worst it fosters an attitude of complacency in the more prosperous individuals and breeds smugness.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Some people may even look at religion as an opiate developed by exploiters of the common people in order to keep them in subjection. How different from the connotations to the Muslim of the verse <span style="color:black;">(<strong>3:19</strong>): &#8216;<em>the true religion with God is submitting yourself to God (Islam)!</em>&#8216;</span> The word translated as &#8216;religion&#8217; is Deen, which, in Arabic, commonly refers to a whole way of life.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">It is not a private matter for individuals, touching only the periphery of their lives, but something which is both private and public, something which permeates the whole fabric of society in a way of which men are conscious. It is all in one theological dogma, forms of worship, political theory, and a detailed code of conduct, including even matters which the European would classify as hygiene or etiquette.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">The universatality of the religion of &#8216;Submitting to Our Creator&#8217; is quite obvious and this is the only religion which is universal in nature.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Thus after going through only the literal definition of the various major world religions, it is quite obvious that religion has to be something from our one and only creator and also Universal not bound to any limits and that only religion living upto it&#8217;s definition is Islam (Submitting to Our Creator).</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Given Below is the definition of a True Religion which is right and straight mentioned in the Qur&#8217;an and which is a universal definition and no one can object to that.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

The command (or the judgement) is for none but Allah. He has commanded that you worship none but Him (i.e. His Monotheism), that is the (true) straight religion, but most men know not.</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

No change let there be in Khalqillah (i.e. the Religion of Allah Islamic Monotheism), that is the straight religion, but most of men know not.

</span>&#8211; <span style="color:#333399;">And they were commanded not, but that they should worship Allah, and worship none but Him Alone (abstaining from ascribing partners to Him), and perform As-Salat (Iqamat-as-Salat) and give Zakat: and that is the religion Right and Straight.</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Abu Huraira reported Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: No child is born but upon Fitra. He then said. Recite: The nature made by Allah in which He created man, there is no altering of Allah&#8217;s nature; that is the right religion.&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

<p><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"><strong>Sahih Muslim :: Book 33 : Hadith 6426</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Abu Huraira reported Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: No babe is born but upon Fitra. It is his parents who make him a Jew or a Christian or a Polytheist. A person said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, what is your opinion if they were to die before that (before reaching the age of adolescence when they can distinguish between right and wrong)? He said: It is Allah alone Who knows what they would be doing.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Allah says in <span style="color:black;"><strong>The Qur&#8217;an in Chapter 3 verse 73</strong></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">﴿قُلْ إِنَّ الْهُدَى هُدَى اللَّهِ﴾</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">(Say: (O Prophet) &#8220;Verily, right guidance is the guidance of Allah.&#8221;)</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:18pt;"><strong>Can we say that My Religion is better than yours and more Superior?<br />
</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Absolutely No. Neither can a Jew argue by saying that `Our Book is the best Book and our Prophet (Musa) is the best Prophet. &#8216;</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Nor can a Christian argue like that and neither can any follower of Islam argue by saying, `There is no religion except Islam, our Book has abrogated every other Book, our Prophet is the Final Prophet.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"><span style="color:#333399;">Allah says in the</span><br />
<span style="color:black;"><strong>Qur&#8217;an in Chapter 4 verses 123-124</strong></span>:</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">It will not be in accordance with your desires (Muslims), nor those of the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians), whosoever works evil, will have the recompense thereof, and he will not find any protector or helper besides Allah.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">And whoever does righteous good deeds, male or female, and is a true believer in the Oneness of Allah (Muslim), such will enter Paradise and not the least injustice, even to the size of a Naqeera (speck on the back of a datestone), will be done to them.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Qatadah said, &#8220;We were told that the Muslims and the People of the Scriptures mentioned their own virtues to each other. People of the Scriptures said, `Our Prophet came before your Prophet and our Book before your Book. Therefore, we should have more right to Allah than you have.&#8217; Muslims said, `Rather, we have more right to Allah than you, our Prophet is the Final Prophet and our Book supersedes all the Books before it.&#8217; Allah sent down,</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">﴿لَّيْسَ بِأَمَـنِيِّكُمْ وَلا أَمَانِىِّ أَهْلِ الْكِتَـبِ مَن يَعْمَلْ سُوءًا يُجْزَ بِهِ﴾</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">(It will not be in accordance with your desires (Muslims), nor those of the People of the Scripture (Jews and Christians), whosoever works evil, will have the recompense thereof),</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">﴿وَمَنْ أَحْسَنُ دِيناً مِمَّنْ أَسْلَمَ وَجْهَهُ لله وَهُوَ مُحْسِنٌ﴾</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"><span style="color:#333399;">(And who can be better in religion than one who submits his face (himself) to Allah; and he is a Muhsin.) Allah then supported the argument of the Muslims against their opponents of the other religions.&#8221; Similar statements were attributed to As-Suddi, Masruq, Ad-Dahhak and Abu Salih. Al-`Awfi reported that Ibn `Abbas commented on this Ayah </span>﴿<span style="color:black;"><strong>4:123</strong></span>﴾<span style="color:#333399;">, &#8220;The followers of various religions disputed, the people of the Tawrah said, `Our Book is the best Book and our Prophet (Musa) is the best Prophet. &#8216; The people of the Injil said similarly, the people of Islam said, `There is no religion except Islam, our Book has abrogated every other Book, our Prophet is the Final Prophet, and you were commanded to believe in your Books and adhere to our Book.&#8217; Allah judged between them, saying,</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">﴿لَّيْسَ بِأَمَـنِيِّكُمْ وَلا أَمَانِىِّ أَهْلِ الْكِتَـبِ مَن يَعْمَلْ سُوءًا يُجْزَ بِهِ﴾</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">(It will not be in accordance with your desires, nor those of the People of the Scripture, whosoever works evil, will have the recompense thereof).&#8221; This Ayah indicates that the religion is not accepted on account of wishful thinking or mere hopes. Rather, the accepted religion relies on what resides in the heart and which is made truthful through actions. It is not true that when one utters a claim to something, he attains it merely on account of his claim. It is not true that every person who claims to be on the truth is considered as such, merely on account of his words, until his claim gains merit with proof from Allah. Hence Allah&#8217;s statement,</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">﴿لَّيْسَ بِأَمَـنِيِّكُمْ وَلا أَمَانِىِّ أَهْلِ الْكِتَـبِ مَن يَعْمَلْ سُوءًا يُجْزَ بِهِ﴾</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">(It will not be in accordance with your desires, nor those of the People of the Scripture, whosoever works evil, will have the recompense thereof), meaning safety will not be acquired by you or them just by wishful thinking. Rather, the key is in obeying Allah and following what He has legislated through the words of His honorable Messengers. This is why Allah said afterwards,</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">﴿مَن يَعْمَلْ سُوءًا يُجْزَ بِهِ﴾</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">(whosoever works evil, will have the recompense thereof,) Similarly, Allah said,</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">﴿فَمَن يَعْمَلْ مِثْقَالَ ذَرَّةٍ خَيْراً يَرَهُ &#8211; وَمَن يَعْـمَلْ مِثْقَالَ ذَرَّةٍ شَرّاً يَرَهُ ﴾</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">(So whosoever does good equal to the weight of an atom, shall see it. And whosoever does evil equal to the weight of an atom, shall see it.)</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">﴿وَمَنْ أَحْسَنُ دِيناً مِمَّنْ أَسْلَمَ وَجْهَهُ لله﴾</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">(And who can be better in religion than one who submits his face to Allah.) meaning, performs the good actions in sincerity for his Lord with faith and awaiting the reward with Allah,</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">﴿وَهُوَ مُحْسِنٌ﴾</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">(and he is a Muhsin) following the correct guidance that Allah legislated in the religion of truth which He sent His Messenger with. These are the two conditions, in the absence of which no deed will be accepted from anyone; sincerity and correctness. The work is sincere when it is performed for Allah alone and it becomes correct when it conforms to the Shari`ah. So, the deed becomes outwardly correct with following the Sunnah and inwardly correct with sincerity. When any deed lacks either of these two conditions, the deed becomes null and void.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">God chose only One way of life for all of Us, the way of submitting our will to Him.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Allah says to this Ummah in <span style="color:black;"><strong>The Qur&#8217;an 42:13</strong></span>:</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">﴿شَرَعَ لَكُم مِّنَ الِدِينِ مَا وَصَّى بِهِ نُوحاً وَالَّذِى أَوْحَيْنَآ إِلَيْكَ﴾</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">(He (Allah) has ordained for you the same religion which He ordained for Nuh, and that which We have revealed to you,) Allah mentions the first Messenger who was sent after Adam, that is, Nuh, peace be upon them, and the last of them is Muhammad . Then He mentions those who came in between them who were the Messengers of strong will, namely Ibrahim, Musa and `Isa bin Maryam. This Ayah mentions all five, just as they are also mentioned in the Ayah in Surat Al-Ahzab, where Allah says:</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">﴿وَإِذْ أَخَذْنَا مِنَ النَّبِيِّيْنَ مِيثَاقَهُمْ وَمِنْكَ وَمِن نُّوحٍ وَإِبْرَهِيمَ وَمُوسَى وَعِيسَى ابْنِ مَرْيَمَ﴾</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"><span style="color:#333399;">(And (remember) when We took from the Prophets their covenant, and from you, and from Nuh, Ibrahim, Musa, and `Isa son of Maryam.)</span> (<strong>33:7</strong>).</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:18pt;"><strong>Why do we need Messenger&#8217;s or Prophets?<br />
</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">The messenger&#8217;s duty is only to convey the message of Our Creator and this is mentioned in several places in the Qur&#8217;an</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"><span style="color:black;"><strong>Qur&#8217;an 24:54</strong></span> &#8211; <span style="color:#333399;"> ….If you obey him (the messenger), you shall be on the right guidance. The Messengers duty is only to convey (the message) in a clear way (i.e. to preach in a plain way).&#8221;</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"><span style="color:black;"><strong>Qur&#8217;an 13:40</strong></span> &#8211; <span style="color:#333399;"> (your duty is only to convey and on Us is the reckoning)</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"><span style="color:black;"><strong>Qur&#8217;an 24:54</strong></span> &#8211; <span style="color:#333399;"> The Messenger&#8217;s duty is only to convey in a clear way)</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"><span style="color:black;"><strong>Qur&#8217;an 88:21-22</strong></span> &#8211;  <span style="color:#333399;">(So remind them &#8212; you are only one who reminds. You are not a dictator over them.)</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:18pt;"><strong>Did different Prophets/Messengers preach different things?<br />
</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">The Message which all the Messengers brought was to worship Allah Alone, with no partner or associate, as Allah says:</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">﴿وَمَآ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ مِن رَّسُولٍ إِلاَّ نُوحِى إِلَيْهِ أَنَّهُ لا إِلَـهَ إِلاَّ أَنَاْ فَاعْبُدُونِ ﴾</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"><span style="color:#333399;">(And We did not send any Messenger before you but We revealed to him (saying): None has the right to be worshipped but I, so worship Me.)</span> (<strong>21:25</strong>).</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">And according to a Hadith (the Prophet said):</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">«نَحْنُ مَعْشَرَ الْأَنْبِيَاءِ أَوْلَادُ عَلَّاتٍ، دِينُنَا وَاحِد»</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">(We Prophets are brothers and our religion is one.) In other words, the common bond between them is that Allah Alone is to be worshipped, with no partner or associate, even though their laws and ways may differ, as Allah says.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">﴿لِكُلٍّ جَعَلْنَا مِنكُمْ شِرْعَةً وَمِنْهَـجاً﴾</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"><span style="color:#333399;">(To each among you, We have prescribed a law and a clear way) </span>(<span style="color:black;"><strong>5:48</strong></span>).</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:18pt;"><strong>How then did so many Religions come to evolve?</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">In the very Next verse<span style="color:black;"><strong> (The Qur&#8217;an 42:14) </strong><span style="color:#333399;">Allah says ;</span></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:right;"><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">﴿وَمَا تَفَرَّقُواْاللَّهِ إِلاَّ مَنبَعْدِ مَا جَآءَهُمُ الْعِلْمُ﴾</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">(And they divided not till after knowledge had come to them,) means, their opposition to the truth arose after it had come to them and proof had been established against them. Nothing made them resist in this manner except their transgression and stubbornness.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:18pt;"><strong>How come then that all religion preach goodness?<br />
</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">As already mentioned, different religions evolved from the same root Islam, due to the transgression, stubbornness, desires and group leadership of some so called spiritual people.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Since there had been from the very beginning, the only religion of submitting to God, it is obvious that all the different religions which came will have traits of goodness from the original religion.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">It&#8217;s similitude is like a barrel of Pure water (Islam) having various qualities, from which many different people took a bottle of and mixed their own motive, desires, etc in it and presented it in the form of a new religion. Hence it is obvious that these different bottles had some mixtures of good water in them, like different religions have some goodness. But the bottle did not have the same original pure water.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Similarly all religions though they preach goodness yet are not the same fully. They have been distorted from the same one religion of &#8216;Submitting to God&#8217;.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"><strong>We need to take water from the Pure Barrel, not from the bottles containing mixture.</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:18pt;"><strong>All religions basically teach followers to do good deeds. Why should a person only follow Islam? Can he not follow any of the religions?<br />
</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">As already mentioned, we should follow that which is pure, which is from God, which is without any mixture rather than following the one which has been mixed with various things including desire, malpractices, profits etc.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:purple;font-family:Helvetica;"><span style="font-size:18pt;"><strong>1) Introductory reply to topic</strong></span><span style="color:#666666;font-size:9pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:red;font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:Georgia;"><em>Agniveer states:</em></span><span style="color:#666666;font-family:Times New Roman;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-size:12pt;"><em><span style="color:#666666;font-family:Georgia;">The common Muslim belief is that Allah is a shapeless and omnipresent entity. This is not only an accurate description of qualities of All-powerful Ishwar, but also in lines with Vedas.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><br />
</span></em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Helvetica;font-size:9pt;"><span style="color:#339966;"><strong>Response:</strong></span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Helvetica;font-size:9pt;">The author don&#8217;t even know the actual belief of Muslims, A Muslim will never say Allah is omnipresent with his essence, but the belief of a Muslim is Allah is everywhere with his knowledge and Allah is over (<strong>Istawaa</strong>) <strong>the (Mighty) Throne</strong> in a manner that suits His Majesty, separate from his creation and we believe in his attributes without matching HIM with HIS creation (whoever does that he is not a muslim) because there is nothing like unto HIM (Allah).<span style="color:#666666;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#666666;font-family:Helvetica;font-size:9pt;">For proof see these Ayahs.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#666666;font-family:Helvetica;font-size:9pt;"><strong>[057:004]</strong> <span style="color:navy;">He it is Who created the heavens and the earth in six Days and <strong>then Istawa (rose over) the Throne </strong>(in a manner that suits His Majesty). He<strong> knows what goes into the earth </strong>and what comes forth from it, what descends from the heaven and what ascends thereto. And He is with you (by His Knowledge) wheresoever you may be. And Allah is the All-Seer of what you do (<span style="color:#666666;"><strong>Muhammad Al-Hilali &amp; Muhsin Khan)</strong>.<strong> </strong><br />
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#666666;font-family:Helvetica;font-size:9pt;"><strong>[042:011]</strong><span style="color:navy;">The Creator of the heavens and the earth. He has made for you mates from yourselves, and for the cattle (also) mates. By this means He creates you (in the wombs). <strong>There is nothing like unto Him, and He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer.</strong>(<span style="color:#666666;">Muhammad Al-Hilali &amp; Muhsin Khan)<br />
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:blue;font-family:Helvetica;font-size:9pt;"><strong>So, when starting of the article is so weak because they don&#8217;t know the creed of their opponent, how can their article be a credible any more? The whole article is answered in these few sentences but still we are replying to author&#8217;s arguments.</strong><span style="color:#666666;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:Georgia;font-size:12pt;"><em><span style="color:red;">Agniveer states:</span><br />
</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#666666;font-family:Georgia;font-size:12pt;"><em>However if we dwell into the modern Quran, we can witness an Allah which has a shape and size. This is in sharp contradiction to the established concept of Allah and hint at either there being tampering with original Quran or that Quran is not the final word of either Muhammad or Allah.<br />
</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Helvetica;font-size:9pt;"><span style="color:#339966;"><strong>Response:</strong></span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Helvetica;font-size:9pt;">What does he mean by Modern Qur`an?? The Qur`an never changed, it is the same as it was 1400 years ago, Alhumdu`lillah, Holy Qura&#8217;an says;<span style="color:#666666;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#666666;font-family:Helvetica;font-size:9pt;"><strong>[015:009] </strong><span style="color:navy;">Verily We: It is We Who have sent down the Dhikr (i.e. the Quran) and surely, We will guard it (from corruption). (<span style="color:#666666;">Muhammad Al-Hilali &amp; Muhsin Khan:)<br />
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#666666;font-family:Helvetica;font-size:9pt;">Check this link, &#8220;The Compilation of the Quran&#8221; (from kids corner of website because author don&#8217;t even know basics)</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:purple;font-family:Helvetica;"><span style="font-size:18pt;"><strong>2) <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Replying Agniveer&#8217;s 12 points against Qur`an</span></strong></span><span style="color:#666666;font-size:9pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:red;font-family:Helvetica;font-size:9pt;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Agniveer states:</em></span><span style="color:#666666;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#666666;font-family:Helvetica;font-size:9pt;"><strong><em>1. Surate Yunis, Ayat 6 states that Allah created the sky and earth in 6 days and then settled at the top in his throne.</em></strong><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#339966;font-family:Helvetica;font-size:9pt;"><strong>Response:</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Helvetica;font-size:9pt;">This is utter lie because this is what Allah says in <span style="text-decoration:underline;">SURAH YUNUS</span> (not Yunis)</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#666666;font-family:Helvetica;font-size:9pt;">[010:006]<span style="color:navy;"> Verily, in the alternation of the night and the day and in all that Allah has created in the heavens and the earth are Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) for those people who keep their duty to Allah, and fear Him much. (<span style="color:#666666;">Muhammad Al-Hilali &amp; Muhsin Khan)<br />
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Helvetica;font-size:9pt;">So, it is clearly seen that what the ayah says and what the author claimed about the ayah are two way different things?? I believe he just copied and pasted or he is willingly trying to deceive.<span style="color:#666666;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:red;"><span style="font-family:Helvetica;font-size:9pt;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Agniveer states:</em></span><span style="color:#666666;"><em> </em><br />
</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#666666;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;"><strong><em>2. Surate Hood, Ayat 7 states that Allah created the sky and earth in 6 days and his throne is over the water.</em></strong><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#666666;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;"><strong><em>Tafseer Husaini, a supposedly authoritative commentary on Quran states that Allah created a green stone before creating the world and saw it with anger. This caused the stone to become water. Then Allah created air and kept water over air. Then he made his throne above this water.</em></strong><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#666666;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;"><strong><em>It is obvious that writers of Quran were ignorant of science and hence thought that since rainfall comes from top, there must be water over air. And since there is so much empty space on top, Allah must be sitting there!</em></strong><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#339966;"><span style="font-family:Helvetica;font-size:9pt;"><strong>Response:</strong><span style="color:#666666;"><br />
</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:navy;font-size:9pt;"><strong>Firstly</strong> I have never ever heard about the tafsir of husaini, and i don&#8217;t know who is the author, this commentary is not authority in any case.</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;"><strong>Secondly ,this is Surah Hud ayah 7</strong><span style="color:#666666;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#666666;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;"><strong>[011:007]</strong> <span style="color:navy;">And He it is Who has created the heavens and the earth in six Days and His Throne was on the water, that He might try you, which of you is the best in deeds. But if you were to say to them: &#8220;You shall indeed be raised up after death,&#8221; those who disbelieve would be sure to say, &#8220;This is nothing but obvious magic.&#8221;(<span style="color:#666666;">Muhammad Al-Hilali &amp; Muhsin Khan)<br />
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#666666;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;"> Prophet peace be upon him said, «كَانَ اللهُ قَبْلَ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ، وَكَانَ عَرْشُهُ عَلَى الْمَاءِ، وَكَتَبَ فِي اللَّوْحِ الْمَحْفُوظِ ذِكْرَ كُلِّ شَيْء  »<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#666666;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;"> (Allah was before everything and His Throne was over the water. He then wrote in the Preserved Tablet (Loh e Mahfooz) mentioning everything.) (Commentry of Ibne kathir under the ayah 11:7)<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;"> So what is the problem here?? There is no beginning of Allah, and as we already made it clear, Allah is over <strong>(Istawaa) the (Mighty) Throne</strong> in a manner that suits His Majesty, separate from his creation and we believe in his attributes without matching with HIS creation(whoever matches he is not a muslim) because there is nothing like unto him (Allah).<span style="color:#666666;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#666666;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;"> <span style="color:#002060;"><strong>Check the following article regarding the belief of Muslims:</strong> <a href="http://www.as-salaf.com/article.php?aid=66&amp;lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right"><span style="color:#1284b9;">http://www.as-salaf.com/article.php?aid=66&amp;lang=en</span><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a><span style="color:#666666;"><br />
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#666666;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;"> <span style="color:navy;">The Istiwa of Allah Almighty does not resemble the istiwa of creation, rather, we believe that Allah istawa over His Throne in a manner befitting His Majesty, not like that of creation.<span style="color:#666666;"><br />
</span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:navy;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;"> Allah (swt) said : <strong>[42:11]</strong> There is nothing like Him, and He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer<span style="color:#666666;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:navy;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;"> And,<span style="color:#666666;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:navy;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;"> <strong>[112:4]</strong>And there is none coequal or comparable to Him<span style="color:#666666;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;"> The kayfiyyah (reality; how-ness) of Allah&#8217;s Istiwa is unknown to us, as Allah has not informed us, nor did His Messenger –sallallahu alayhi wa salamm-, on the details of this matter, and it is not permissible to ask about the kayfiyyah of His Attributes. Allah Almighty alone knows how He Rose (Istawa) over His Throne and our duty is to believe and submit without doubt.<span style="color:#666666;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:red;font-family:Helvetica;font-size:9pt;text-decoration:underline;"><em>Agniveer states:</em></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#666666;font-family:Helvetica;font-size:9pt;"><em> <strong>So much for Islamic science. However what is more important is that this makes clear that his throne is a finite object and hence Allah is also finite in size. Also since Allah is on his throne, he is not below the air and water. Thus the Allah of Quran is limited in shape and location, contrary to common belief of Muslims.</strong></em><br />

</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:navy;font-size:9pt;">Here Agniveer is comparing Allah and his throne to His creation, (which is Kufar). Also No Muslim believes that Allah has limitations rather, the scholars (may Allah have mercy on them) have stated that the Throne covers all of creation and is above it.</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#002060;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;">For more detail see, &#8220;Is the Throne above the seventh heaven?&#8221; source: http://islamqa.com/en/ref/47048<span style="color:#666666;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#666666;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;"> <span style="color:navy;">And if someone says that Muslim do believe in limitations, then that is with the meaning:&#8221; which distinguishes Him from anything else&#8221;;<span style="color:#666666;"><br />
</span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:navy;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;">Shaykh ul Islam ibn Taymiyyah discusses the statements of those from the Pious Predecessors who negated the usage of the word <strong>hadd(limit)</strong>, and those who used it, and explains that in reality both groups were saying the same thing, and the difference was merely of wording not of meaning:<span style="color:#666666;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:navy;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;">&#8220;If the understood meaning of this word is that Allah is in any way enclosed by His creation, then Allah is Greater and more Mighty, rather His Kursi is as the expanse of the Heavens and the earth…and if what is meant by this word is that he is distinct from His creation, then He is as the Imaams of Ahlus Sunnah said about Him: over His Heavens, above His Throne, distinct from creation.&#8221;<span style="color:#666666;"> [&#8216;at-Tadmuriyyah&#8217; (pg.46)of ibn Taymiyyah, check also for further details, &#8216;Talbees al-Jahmiyyah&#8217; (2/163)] <span style="color:#002060;">(See saying of Shaykh Ibne Tamiyah here: <a href="http://islamworld.net/docs/tay.html" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="color:#1284b9;">http://islamworld.net/docs/tay.html</span><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>)<br />

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#666666;font-family:Helvetica;font-size:9pt;"><strong><em>Please note that the concept of a shapeless, omnipresent Allah is inspired from Vedas, which form the foundation of all that is good and right in Quran.

</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:navy;font-size:9pt;">This is utter lie because no Muslim believe in Allah&#8217;s omnipresence, This is Agniveer belief, and If Vedas are still in orignal form, can they tell us to which Prophet Vedas were revealed??

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:#666666;font-size:9pt;"><strong><em>3. Surate Haka 17 states that eight people will lift the throne of Allah Miyan. Tafseere Husaini details it further by stating that those who will lift the throne of Allah will have faces like goats from mountains.

</strong></span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;"><strong>1stly</strong> there is nothing like ALLAH MIYAN??<span style="color:#666666;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;"><strong>2ndly</strong> Tafseer Husaini is no where evidence, and<span style="color:#666666;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;"><strong>3rdly</strong> this is not 7 skies but 7 layers.<span style="color:#666666;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;"> Ibn Katheer commented in his Tafseer on the saying of Allah (which means):<span style="text-decoration:underline;"> {who has created the seven heavens one above the another.}<strong>[67:3]</strong></span> which means layers one above another. With regard to whether these layers are successive one on top of the other, or they are separate and there is gap between them; there are two opinions about this.<span style="color:#666666;"><br />

<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;"> The most correct opinion, however, is that the layers are separate and there is gap between them. The evidence is the narration about <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Israa&#8217; and Mi&#8217;araaj</span> and other narrations. One of these narrations is classified as weak by some scholars. The narration is as following: <span style="text-decoration:underline;">The Prophet said: &#8220;And between each heaven and the other, there is a distance of travel of 500 years, and the thickness of each heaven is a distance of travel of 500 years.&#8221;<span style="color:#666666;"> [Ahmad].</span></span><br />

</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;"> Throne covers all of creation and is above it. The kayfiyyah (reality; how-ness) of Allah&#8217;s Istiwa is unknown to us, as Allah has not informed us, nor did His Messenger –sallallahu alayhi wa salamm-, on the details of this matter, and it is not permissable to ask about the reality,howness of His Attributes. Allah Almighty alone knows how He Rose (Istawa) over His Throne, and our duty is to believe and submit.<span style="color:#666666;"><br />

<p><span style="color:#666666;font-family:Helvetica;font-size:9pt;"><strong>Response<br />
</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:navy;font-size:9pt;">No where this verse says that ALLAH moves up and down in 1000 years, it is an utter lie, and how cleverly he said some experts say that this is description for angles.

</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;">1. Time of Allah is incomparable to earthly time<span style="color:#666666;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;">The Qur&#8217;an says in two verses, (22:47 and 32:5), that the measure of one day in the sight of Allah is equal to 1,000 years of our reckoning. In another verse (70:4) it says that the measure of one day in the sight of Allah is equal to 50,000 years of our reckoning.<span style="color:#666666;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;"> These verses generally mean that the time of Allah (swt) is incomparable to the earthly time. The examples given are of one thousand years and fifty thousand years of the earthly time. In other words thousands of years or a very, very long time of the earth is a day in the sight of Allah.<span style="color:#666666;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;">2. Yaum also means Period<span style="color:#666666;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;">The Arabic word used in all these three verses is yaum, which, besides meaning a day also means a long period, or an epoch. If you translate the word yaum correctly as &#8216;period&#8217; there will be no confusion.<span style="color:#666666;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#666666;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;"> <span style="color:#002060;"><strong>a) The verse from Surah Hajj reads as: </strong><span style="color:#666666;"><br />
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;">&#8220;Yet they ask thee to hasten on the Punishment! but Allah will not fail in His promise. Verily a Day in the sight of thy Lord is like a thousand years of your reckoning&#8221;<span style="color:#666666;">.[Al-Qur&#8217;an 22:47]
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#666666;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;"> <span style="color:navy;">When the unbelievers asked to hasten the punishment the Qur&#8217;an says Allah will not fail in His promise. Verily a period in the sight of Allah is like a thousand years of your reckoning.<span style="color:#666666;"><br />
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#666666;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;"> <span style="color:#002060;"><strong>b) The verse from Surah Al-Sajdah says:</strong><span style="color:#666666;"><br />
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;">&#8220;He rules (all) affairs from the heavens to the earth: in the end will (all affairs) go up? To Him, on a Day, the space whereof will be (as) a thousand years of your reckoning&#8221;.<span style="color:#666666;">[Al-Qur&#8217;an 32:5]
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;"><strong> This verse indicates that a period required for all the affairs to go up to Allah (swt), is a thousand years of our reckoning.</strong><span style="color:#666666;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#666666;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;"> <span style="color:#002060;"><strong>c) A verse from Surah Al-Maarij says: </strong><span style="color:#666666;"><br />
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;">&#8220;The angels and the spirit ascend unto Him in a Day the measure whereof is (as) fifty thousand years&#8221;<span style="color:#666666;">.[Al-Qur&#8217;an 70:4]
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#666666;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;"> <span style="color:navy;"><strong>This verse means that the period required for angels and the spirits to ascend unto Allah (swt) is fifty thousand years</strong><span style="color:#666666;">.<br />
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#666666;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;"> <span style="color:#002060;"><strong>d) The period for two different acts need not be the same. </strong><span style="color:navy;">For example the period required for me to travel to destination &#8216;A&#8217; say Vashi is one hour and the period required for me to travel to destination &#8216;B&#8217; i.e. Kashmir is 50 hours. This does not indicate that I am making two contradictory statements.<span style="color:#666666;"><br />
</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;">Thus the verses of the Qur&#8217;an don&#8217;t contradict each other and they are in perfect harmony with established modern scientific facts.<span style="color:#666666;"><br />

</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;">I wonder if he ever read holy Qur&#8217;an! Here are the verse 9,10 of surah waqiyah:<span style="color:#666666;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;"><strong>[056:009]</strong> And those on the Left Hand (i.e. those who will be given their Record in their left hands), Who will be those on the Left Hand? (As a disgrace for them, because they will enter Hell).<span style="color:#666666;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;"><strong>[056:010] </strong>And those foremost ((in Islamic Faith of Monotheism and in performing righteous deeds) in the life of this world on the very first call for to embrace Islam,) will be foremost (in Paradise).<span style="color:#666666;">(Muhammad Al-Hilali &amp; Muhsin Khan)<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;">So these verses are about those who will be given their Record of deeds in their left hands.<span style="color:#666666;"><br />

<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;">Musnad Imam Ahmad recorded from Anas bin Malik that the Prophet said about Allah&#8217;s saying;<br />

</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;">(And when his Lord appeared to the mountain, )<br />
<span style="color:#666666;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;">(Like this) then he held out the tip of his little finger. At-Tirmidhi recorded this in the chapter of Tafsir for this Ayah, then he said; &#8220;This Hadith is Hasan Sahih Gharib.&#8221; This was also recorded by Al-Hakim in his Mustadrak through the route of Hamad bin Salamah, and he said; &#8220;This Hadith is Sahih according to the criteria of Muslim and they did not record it.&#8221; And As-Suddi reported that `Ikrimah reported from Ibn `Abbas about Allah&#8217;s saying,<span style="color:#666666;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;"> (And when his Lord appeared to the mountain,) Only the extent of the little finger appeared from Him.<span style="color:#666666;"><br />

<span style="color:#666666;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;">And when his Lord revealed Himself, that is, [when] He manifested of His Light the equivalent of half a nail of a little finger, as stated in one hadīth verified by al-Hākim, to the mountain He leveled it to the ground (end).<span style="color:#666666;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;">So here we can see Allah manifested His Light the equivalent of half a nail of the little finger, and Allah Has Power over Everything.<span style="color:#666666;"><br />

</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;">First of all which tafsir agniveer studied?? So far he is quoting from the unknown &#8220;tafsir husaini&#8221;.<span style="color:#666666;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;">Well here is the ayah with commentaries.<span style="color:#666666;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;"> <strong>[024:035]</strong> Allah is the Light of the heavens and the earth. The parable of His Light is as (if there were) a niche and within it a lamp, the lamp is in glass, the glass as it were a brilliant star, lit from a blessed tree, an olive, neither of the east (i.e. neither it gets sun-rays only in the morning) nor of the west (i.e. nor it gets sun-rays only in the afternoon, but it is exposed to the sun all day long), whose oil would almost glow forth (of itself), though no fire touched it. Light upon Light! Allah guides to His Light whom He wills. And Allah sets forth parables for mankind, and Allah is All-Knower of everything.(end) <span style="color:#666666;">(Muhammad Al-Hilali &amp; Muhsin Khan)<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Tafsir Ibne Kathir says:</strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#666666;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;">Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas said:<span style="color:#666666;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;">(Allah is the Light of the heavens and the earth.) means, the Guide of the inhabitants of the heavens and the earth. Ibn Jurayj said: &#8220;Mujahid and Ibn `Abbas said concerning the Ayah:<span style="color:#666666;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;">(Allah is the Light of the heavens and the earth.) He is controlling their affairs and their stars and sun and moon.&#8221; As-Suddi said concerning the Ayah:<span style="color:#666666;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;">(Allah is the Light of the heavens and the earth.) by His Light the heavens and earth are illuminated. In the Two Sahihs, it is recorded that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said: &#8220;When the Messenger of Allah got up to pray at night, he would say:<span style="color:#666666;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;">(O Allah, to You be praise, You are the Sustainer of heaven and earth and whoever is in them. To You be praise, You are the Light of the heavens and the earth and whoever is in them. ) It was narrated that Ibn Mas`ud said, &#8220;There is no night or day with your Lord; the Light of the Throne comes from the Light of His Face.&#8221;<span style="color:#666666;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;">(The parable of His Light) There are two views concerning the meaning of the pronoun (His). The first is that it refers to Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, meaning that the parable of His guidance in the heart of the believer is (As a niche) this was the view of Ibn `Abbas.<span style="color:#666666;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;">The second view is that this pronoun refers to the believer, which is indicated by the context of the words and implies that the parable of the light in the heart of the believer is as a niche. So the heart of the believer and what he is naturally inclined to of guidance and what he learns of the Qur&#8217;an which is in accordance with his natural inclinations are, as Allah says:<span style="color:#666666;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;">(Can they who rely on a clear proof from their Lord, and whom a witness from Him recite it (can they be equal with the disbelievers))   ﴿  11:17  ﴾  . The heart of the believer in its purity and clarity is likened to a lamp in transparent and jewel-like glass, and the Qur&#8217;an and Shari`ah by which it is guided are likened to good, pure, shining oil in which there is no impurity or deviation.<span style="color:#666666;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;">(As (if there were) a niche) Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Muhammad bin Ka`b and others said, &#8220;This refers to the position of the wick in the lamp.&#8221; This is well-known, and hence Allah then says:<span style="color:#666666;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;">(and within it a lamp.) This is the flame that burns brightly. Or it was said that the niche is a niche in the house. This is the parable given by Allah of obedience towards Him. Allah calls obedience to Him as light, then He calls it by other numerous names as well. Ubayy bin Ka`b said, &#8220;The lamp is the light, and this refers to the Qur&#8217;an and the faith that is in his heart.&#8221; As-Suddi said, &#8220;It is the lamp.&#8221;<span style="color:#666666;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;">(the lamp is in a glass,) means, this light is shining in a clear glass. Ubayy bin Ka`b and others said, &#8220;This is the likeness of the heart of the believer.&#8221;<span style="color:#666666;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;">(the glass as it were a star Durriyyun,) Some authorities recite the word Durriyyun with a Dammah on the Dal and without a Hamzah, which means pearls, i.e., as if it were a star made of pearls (Durr). Others recite it as Dirri&#8217;un or Durri&#8217;un, with a Kasrah on the Dal, or Dammah on the Dal, and with a Hamzah at the end, which means reflection (Dir&#8217;), because if something is shone on the star it becomes brighter than at any other time. The Arabs call the stars they do not know Darari. Ubayy bin Ka`b said: a shining star. Qatadah said: &#8220;Huge, bright and clear.&#8221;<br />
<span style="color:#666666;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;">(lit from a blessed tree,) means, it is derived from olive oil, from a blessed tree.<br />
<span style="color:#666666;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;">(an olive,) This refers to the blessed tree mentioned previously.<span style="color:#666666;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;">(neither of the east nor of the west,) means, it is not in the eastern part of the land so that it does not get any sun in the first part of the day, nor is it in the western part of the land so that it is shaded from the sun before sunset, but it is in a central position where it gets sun from the beginning of the day until the end, so its oil is good and pure and shining. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Ibn `Abbas commented on:<span style="color:#666666;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;">(an olive, neither of the east nor of the west,) &#8220;This is a tree in the desert which is not shaded by any other tree or mountain or cave, nothing covers it, and this is best for its oil.&#8221; Mujahid commented on:<span style="color:#666666;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;">(neither of the east nor of the west, ) saying; &#8220;It is not in the east where it will get no sun when the sun sets, nor is it in the west where it will get no sun when the sun rises, but it is in a position where it will get sun both at sunrise and sunset.&#8221; Sa`id bin Jubayr commented:<span style="color:#666666;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;">(an olive, neither of the east nor of the west, whose oil would almost glow forth (of itself)) &#8220;This is the best kind of oil. When the sun rises it reaches the tree from the east and when it sets it reaches it from the west, so the sun reaches it morning and evening, so it is not counted as being in the east or in the west.&#8221;<span style="color:#666666;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;">(whose oil would almost glow forth (of itself), though no fire touched it.) `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam said (this means) because the oil itself is shining.<span style="color:#666666;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;">(Light upon Light!) Al-`Awfi narrated from Ibn `Abbas that this meant the faith and deeds of a person. As-Suddi said:<span style="color:#666666;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;">(Light upon Light!) &#8220;Light of the fire and the light of the oil: when they are combined they give light, and neither of them can give light without the other. Similarly the light of the Qur&#8217;an and the light of faith give light when they are combined, and neither can do so without the other.&#8221;<span style="color:#666666;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;">(Allah guides to His Light whom He wills.) means, Allah shows the way to the ones whom He chooses, as it says in the Hadith recorded by Imam Ahmad from `Abdullah bin `Amr, who said, &#8220;I heard the Messenger of Allah saying:<span style="color:#666666;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;">(Allah created His creation in darkness, then on the same day He sent His Light upon them. Whoever was touched by His Light on that day will be guided and whoever was missed will be led astray. Hence I say: the pens have dried in accordance with the knowledge of Allah, may He be glorified.)&#8221;<span style="color:#666666;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;">(And Allah sets forth parables for mankind, and Allah is All-Knower of everything.) Having mentioned this parable of the Light of His guidance in the heart of the believer, Allah ends this Ayah with the words:<span style="color:#666666;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;">(And Allah sets forth parables for mankind, and Allah is All-Knower of everything.) meaning, He knows best who deserves to be guided and who deserves to be led astray. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri said, &#8220;The Messenger of Allah said:<span style="color:#666666;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;">(Hearts are of four kinds: the heart that is clear like a shining lamp; the heart that is covered and tied up; the heart that is upside-down; and the heart that is clad in armor. As for the clear heart, it is the heart of the believer in which is a lamp filled with light; as for the covered heart, this is the heart of the disbeliever; as for the upside-down heart, this is the heart of the hypocrite, who recognizes then denies; as for the armor-clad heart, this is the heart in which there is both faith and hypocrisy. The parable of the faith in it is that of legume, a sprout that is irrigated with good water, and the likeness of the hypocrisy in it is that of sores that are fed by blood and pus. Whichever of the two prevails is the characteristic that will dominate.) Its chain of narrators is good (Jayyid) although they (Al-Bukhari and Muslim) did not record it.(end quote from tafsir Ibne Kathir)<span style="color:#666666;"><br />

<p><span style="color:blue;font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size:14pt;">I wonder if he read tafsir Ibne Kathir as </span><span style="color:red;"><span style="font-size:12pt;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">agniveer said:</span><span style="color:blue;"> <strong>A</strong>fter analyzing countless commentaries, I failed to understand the meaning of this confusing Ayat.</span></span><span style="color:#666666;font-size:9pt;"><br />

<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;">This person need some rest, see the ayahs nowhere any of the ayah says Angels refused to bow to Adam peace be upon him out of ego, these are <strong>verses from Al Baqarah</strong><span style="color:#666666;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;"><strong>[002:033]</strong> He said: &#8220;O Adam! Inform them of their names,&#8221; and when he had informed them of their names, He said: &#8220;Did I not tell you that I know the Ghaib (unseen) in the heavens and the earth, and I know what you reveal and what you have been concealing?&#8221;<span style="color:#666666;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;"><strong>[002:034]</strong> <strong>And (remember) when We said to the angels: &#8220;Prostrate yourselves before Adam.&#8221; <span style="text-decoration:underline;">And they prostrated except Iblees (Satan)</span>, he refused and was proud and was one of the disbelievers (disobedient to Allah).</strong><span style="color:#666666;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;"><strong>[002:035]</strong> And We said: &#8220;O Adam! Dwell you and your wife in the Paradise and eat both of you freely with pleasure and delight of things therein as wherever you will, but come not near this tree or you both will be of the Zalimoon (wrong-doers).&#8221;<span style="color:#666666;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;"><strong>[002:036]</strong> Then the Shaitan (Satan) made them slip therefrom (the Paradise), and got them out from that in which they were.

</span></span></p>

<p><span style="color:black;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;">Imam At-Tirmidhee (d. 279H) said in his Sunan (1/128-129), <span style="color:#666666;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:right;"><span style="color:black;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;">وقد قال غير واحد من أهل العلم في هذا الحديث وما يشبه هذا من الروايات من الصفات ونزول الرب تبارك وتعالى كل ليلة إلى السماء الدنيا قالوا قد تثبت الروايات في هذا ويؤمن بها ولا يُتَوَهَّم ولا يقال كيف<span style="color:#666666;"> <span style="color:black;"> . هكذا روي عن مالك و سفيان بن عيينة و عبد الله بن المبارك أنهم قالوا في هذه الأحاديث أمروها بلا كيف وهكذا قول أهل العلم من أهل السنة والجماعة وأما الجهمية فأنكرت هذه الروايات وقالوا هذا تشبيه وقد ذكر الله عز وجل في غير موضع من كتابه اليد والسمع والبصر فتأولت الجهمية هذه الآيات ففسروها على غير ما فسر أهل العلم وقالوا إن الله لم يخلق آدم بيده وقالوا إن معنى اليد ههنا القوة وقال إسحق بن إبراهيم   [الراهويه  ] إنما يكون التشبيه إذا قال يد كيد أو مثل يد أو سمع كسمع أو مثل سمع فإذا قال سمع كسمع أو مثل سمع فهذا التشبيه وأما إذا قال كما قال الله تعالى يد وسمع وبصر ولا يقول كيف ولا يقول مثل سمع ولا كسمع فهذا لا يكون تشبيها وهو كما قال الله تعالى في كتابه   : ليس كمثله شيء وهو السميع البصير<br />
</span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:navy;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;">It has been stated by more than one person from the People of Knowledge about such ahaadeeth, that there is no tashbeeh (resemblance) to the Attributes of Allaah, and our Lord &#8211; the Blessed and Most High &#8211; descends to the lowest heaven every night. So they say: &#8220;Affirm these narrations, have Eemaan (faith) in them, do not deny them, nor ask how.&#8221; The likes of this has been related from Maalik ibn Anas, Sufyaan ath-Thawree, Ibn Uyainah and Abdullaah ibn al-Mubaarak, who all said about such ahaadeeth: &#8220;Leave them as they are, without asking how.&#8221; &#8230;..Ishaaq ibn Ibraheem [ar-Raahawaih] said:<span style="color:#666666;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:navy;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;">Tashbeeh is if it is said: &#8220;Hand like my hand, or similar to my hand&#8221;, or it is said: &#8220;Hearing like my Hearing, or similar to my hearing&#8221;, then this is tashbeeh. But if what is being said is what Allah has said: Hand, Hearing, Seeing and it is not asked how, nor is it said: &#8220;Like my hearing, or similar to my hearing&#8221; &#8211; then it is not tashbeeh. Allaah, the Most Blessed, Most High, said in His Book (ash-Shooraa 42:11): &#8220;<strong>There is none like unto Him, and he is the all-Hearing, the all-Seeing</strong>&#8220;<span style="color:#666666;"><br />

<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;"><strong>Brother Bassam Zawadi</strong> quoted in his refutation of another anti Islamic person sam shamoun;<span style="color:#666666;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;">Al Imam al-Dhahabi says:<span style="color:#666666;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;">&#8220;Why do you say? A hand in reality is this bodily limb&#8217;? Rather, a &#8216;hand&#8217; is homonym, and it is in accordance with, and of the same category of what it is attributed to. Therefore, if the thing described therewith is an animal then the hand would be a bodily limb. If it were was statue made of brass and stone, the hand would also be of brass and stone. If it were an image drawn on the wall, the hand would be a drawing. If it were that of which neither there is a like, nor it is a body, the hand would also be that of which neither there is a like, nor it is a body&#8221;<span style="color:#666666;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;"> He also says:<span style="color:#666666;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;">&#8220;If it is said: In its conventional usage, a hand only refers to the limb that we all know of. We would say in reply: Similarly, in conventional usage, knowledge, hearing and seeing are only accidents that subsist in bodies. Where, then, is the difference?&#8221;<span style="color:#666666;"> (Ithbat al-Yad lilLahi subhanah p. 42-44 by al-Imam al-Dhahabi)<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#666666;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;"> <span style="color:navy;">Indeed, the same logic applies to the face and shin and the rest of Allah&#8217;s attributes.<span style="color:#666666;"><br />
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;">We say that Allah has knowledge. However, humans also have knowledge. So are we making Allah similar to His creation? Of course not, How come you might ask? The answer is because God&#8217;s knowledge is not like ours (His is infinite and He doesn&#8217;t need to acquire it). Therefore, why don&#8217;t we remain consistent and say the rest regarding all of Allah&#8217;s attributes such as His Hand and Face?<span style="color:#666666;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;">To know more about the inconsistency of those that take some of God&#8217;s attributes metaphorically please refer to the following articles.<span style="color:#666666;"><br />

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#666666;font-family:Helvetica;font-size:9pt;"><strong><em>Further Ayats detail that Hell is on left side of Allah&#8217;s throne and Heaven on right side. Thus there is no doubt that the Allah of Quran is a finite sized person.</em></strong><br />

<span style="color:#666666;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;">And your Lord, that is to say, His command, and the angels arrive rank on rank (saffan saffan is a circumstantial qualifier, meaning &#8216;standing in rows&#8217; or &#8216;made up of many ranks&#8217;),<span style="color:#666666;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;">So this is regarding his Command<span style="color:#666666;"><br />

<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Tafsir Ibne Kathir says:</strong></span><span style="color:#666666;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;">(And your Lord comes) meaning, for the session of Judgment between His creatures. This is after they requested the best of the Sons of Adam – Muhammad(SAW) &#8212; to intercede with Allah. This will occur only after they have requested the other great Messengers, one after another. Yet, all of them will say, &#8220;I cannot do that for you.&#8221; This will continue until the beseeching of the men reaches Muhammad (SAW), and He will say, &#8220;I will do it, I will do it.&#8221; So He will go and seek to intercede with Allah as the session of Judgment will have come, and Allah will allow him to intercede for that (the Judgment). This will be the first of the intercessions, and it is the praiseworthy station that has already been discussed in Surat Subhan (Al-Isra&#8217;). So Allah will come for the session of Judgment <strong>as He wills, </strong>and the angels will also come, lined up in rows upon rows before Him.(end)<span style="color:#666666;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;">The bottom line is Allah has power over all things and he will come as he wills and which suits His Majesty, We cannot match Him with His creation. agniveer states that <strong>Further ayats detail that Hell is on left side of Allah&#8217;s throne and Heaven on right side.</strong><span style="color:#666666;"><br />

<p><span style="color:#666666;"><span style="font-family:Helvetica;font-size:9pt;">  <span style="color:navy;">The sanskrit word used for heavenly location is VYOMAN SADNAY and swamiji says that &#8220;Ishwar vyapak bhavan mein stith hokar&#8221;.Now I will give you individual meaning of the hindi words.</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

now if you want to say that verse say this then it will be contrary to this verse</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Helvetica;font-size:9pt;"><strong>Now I will show you from your Veda that Ishwar has form and body</strong>. Also I will show you the deception of Swami Dayanand Saraswati when he left 12 words untranslated which said Ishwar has a body. I will also show you how Swamiji changes translation to suit is theological understanding that Ishwar is formless.<br />
Let me first show you how Swamiji has consistently translated the sanskrit word AGNI as &#8220;Ishwar&#8221; or &#8220;parmeshwar&#8221; everywhere. I will give only 2 samples so that it doesn&#8217;t become too long. See the images below<span style="color:#666666;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="http://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/061818_0602_testingalla2.jpg" alt="" /><span style="color:#666666;font-family:Helvetica;font-size:9pt;"><br />

<p style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="http://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/061818_0602_testingalla3.png" alt="" /><span style="color:#666666;font-family:Helvetica;font-size:9pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Helvetica;"><span style="font-size:12pt;">In both the above images Swamiji has translated AGNI as &#8220;Hey Parmeshwar&#8221; &#8220;O Ishwar&#8221; The references for the above images are: Yajur Veda Adhyay 1; Mantra 17 and 18</span><span style="color:#666666;font-size:9pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Helvetica;"><span style="font-size:12pt;">Now see the image below</span><span style="color:#666666;font-size:9pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="http://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/061818_0602_testingalla4.jpg" alt="" /><span style="color:#666666;font-family:Helvetica;"><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span><span style="font-size:9pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Helvetica;font-size:9pt;">Here Swamiji left 12 words untranslated. You know why? Read carefully what it says. You and Arya Samaj believe that Ishwar is Niraakaar (formless) but the Mantra was saying</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Helvetica;font-size:9pt;">AGNI = Ishwar<br />
TANU = embodied<br />
ASI = is/has<br />
It is saying Ishwar has a form/ body</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Helvetica;font-size:9pt;">Let us move forward. There is another place in Yajur Veda where the same above words have been used. The very first Mantra of 5th Adhyay of Yajur Veda,i.e., Yajur Veda Adhyay 5; Mantra 1<span style="color:#666666;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Helvetica;font-size:9pt;">See the image below. Here fortunately Swamiji has not taken out words but unfortunately has mistranslated it. See below<span style="color:#666666;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="http://vedkabhed.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/061818_0602_testingalla5.jpg" alt="" /><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Helvetica;"><strong>Here Swamiji has broken his own rule. The same word Agni appears here also, but he mistranslated it as</strong><br />
</span><span style="font-family:Mangal;">बिजुली</span><span style="font-family:Helvetica;"><br />
</span><span style="font-family:Mangal;">प्रसिद्ध</span><span style="font-family:Helvetica;"><br />
</span><span style="font-family:Mangal;">रूप</span><span style="font-family:Helvetica;"><br />
</span><span style="font-family:Mangal;">अग्नि</span><span style="font-family:Helvetica;"><br />
</span><span style="font-family:Mangal;">के</span><span style="font-family:Helvetica;"><br />
</span><span style="font-family:Mangal;">शरीर</span><span style="font-family:Helvetica;"><br />
</span><span style="font-family:Mangal;">समान</span><span style="font-family:Helvetica;"><br />
</span><span style="font-family:Mangal;">है</span><span style="font-family:Helvetica;"><br />
<strong>while as the correct translation as per Swamijis own rules is.<br />
AGNI = Ishwar<br />
TANU = body</strong> </span><span style="font-family:Mangal;">शरीर</span><span style="font-family:Helvetica;"><br />
<strong>ASI = is/has</strong> </span><span style="font-family:Mangal;">है</span><span style="color:#666666;font-family:Helvetica;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Helvetica;">So the Mantra is saying </span><span style="font-family:Mangal;">परमेश्वर</span><span style="font-family:Helvetica;"><br />
</span><span style="font-family:Mangal;">शरीर</span><span style="font-family:Helvetica;"><br />
</span><span style="font-family:Mangal;">धारी</span><span style="font-family:Helvetica;"><br />
</span><span style="font-family:Mangal;">है</span><span style="font-family:Helvetica;"> &#8220;parmeshwar shareer dhaari hai&#8221;. Ishwar has a body/form.<span style="color:#666666;"><br />
</span></span></span></p>

</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Helvetica;"><span style="color:navy;font-size:9pt;">This is mere statement of agniveer who is not authority, even if this is true then he said Ishwar communicates will all souls, then tell us how many hindus and christians and Muslims and atheists and all others communicated with God?? And he said (Whenever we do a right act, we get a feeling of satisfaction, enthusiasm or bliss. When we do something wrong, we get a feeling of fear, doubt or shame.) Tell us who is to decide what is right and what is wrong?? Maybe for me what is right is wrong for you and what is right for you are wrong for me, for example some people tease others and according to them it is right to tease but according to some people teasing is not right thing, who is to decide that what is wrong and what is right?? By your logic people will understand that god told teaser through inspiration that teasing is right and same God told the one who is against teaser that Teasing is wrong</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Helvetica;font-size:9pt;">Regarding your objection to using the angel as medium of communication. This is God&#8217;s prerogative. He can choose whatever way He sees fit and doesn&#8217;t need counsel from you. He is the Most Wise and your shortsightedness stands nowhere before God&#8217;s knowledge and Wisdom.<br />
Nowhere did Muslims ever say that God talks as we humans talk. God communicates in our human language coz that is the only language we understand.</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Helvetica;font-size:9pt;">In Islam Allah knows everything but is separate from the creation and above His creation. He is not the creation. Thus your conception is incorrect since you claim that God is in you and me. Let me correct your fallacies. All creatures do not have eyes and ears. So do you mean they do not know their surroundings? Many creatures use so many diverse methods of communication. Human talking is only one form of communication. If you say God communicates, then I would ask you that are you not ascribing animal qualities to God, since animals, insects, etc communicate as well?<span style="color:#666666;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Helvetica;font-size:9pt;">I hope you realize the fallacies of your arguments and come to the truth of Islam.<span style="color:#666666;"><br />

<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:navy;font-size:9pt;">The problem with Hinduism is that you philosophize everything, which ultimately is harmful for you.

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#666666;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;"><strong><em>g. More importantly, since Ishwar is perfect, there is no need for Him to keep sending new amendments of his message every now and then. He simply communicates the eternal Vedas during inception of civilization and then continues to guide us through inspiration, as discussed above.</em></strong><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:#666666;font-size:9pt;"> <strong>Response</strong><br />
</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;">Allah never changed the basic rule that is THERE IS NO ILAH(WORTHY OF WORSHIP) EXCEPT ALLAH, but he changed minor rules for example at the time of Adam peace be upon him marraige between brother and sister was allowed but in Shariyah of Muhammad peace be upon him it is Prohibited.<span style="color:#666666;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:navy;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;"> <strong>2ndly if Ved is perfect then it says</strong><span style="color:#666666;"><br />

</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Helvetica;"><span style="color:navy;font-size:9pt;">besides the above reference showing you that Ishwar is not everywhere, it also is a question for you. This verse is confused about who created the creation and whether Ishwar knows all or not. So this verse is in an agnostic tone. coz this verse is not sure if Ishwar knows all or not.</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Helvetica;font-size:9pt;"><strong>is this ishwar PERFECT</strong></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt;"><br />

</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#666666;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;"><strong><em>It seems that Muhammad wanted to convey this true nature of Ishwar, to best of his limited abilities crippled by his lack of education and epileptic disorder. However, due to conspiracy of his close mates, and his own ignorance to some extent, a defective quran was propagated after his death.</em></strong><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:#666666;font-size:9pt;"> <strong>Response</strong><br />
</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;">This is again a mere claim and lie from agniveer, I already provided the link of The Compilation of the Quran in this article above see that again.<span style="color:#666666;"><br />

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#666666;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;"><strong><em>Thus there are two Allah in Islam. One Allah is that of the Vedas and other is the limited defective Allah as explained above.</em></strong><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:#666666;font-size:9pt;"> <strong>Response</strong><br />
</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;">Qur`an says in Surah Ikhlas 112:1-4<br />
<span style="color:#666666;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;">Say: He is Allah, the One and Only! Allah, the Eternal, Absolute; He begetteth not nor is He begotten. And there is none like unto Him.<span style="color:#666666;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;"> So Allah is only one and he is not defective in any way Alhumdulillah.<span style="color:#666666;"><br />

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#666666;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;"><strong><em>Muslims would serve the true cause of Allah if they reject the defective Allah and embrace the true Ishwar of Vedas who is omnipresent, omnipotent and unchangeable.</em></strong><br />

</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;">Muslims and those who have little intellect will never accept the God who has many, many arms, bellies, mouths and eyes in his body as explained above from hindu texts. Allah is only one and Allah is your lord, our lord and lord of all the worlds their is no Ilah accept Allah.<span style="color:#666666;"><br />

<p><span style="color:#666666;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:9pt;"> MAY ALLAH SAVE US FROM DECIEVING AMEEN<br />

</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:navy;font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size:14pt;"><strong>Agniveer lied in whole of his article even in hinduism he don&#8217;t know the true concept of God.</strong></span><span style="color:#666666;font-size:9pt;"><br />
