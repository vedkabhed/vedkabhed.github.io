<p>Written by Sulaiman Razvi</p>
<p>Meat especially that of cow is the centre of controversy in India. People are lynched and raped on rumours of beef consumption but such mentality didn&#8217;t exist in Vedic period, people in the Vedic period relished beef and meat of other animals. There are clear references in Vedas about meat consumption, but some Hindu scholars don&#8217;t translate it literally despite the fact that it is supported by other Hindu texts. Vedas no-where says that &#8216;You shouldn&#8217;t have meat&#8217;, Hindu scriptures doesn&#8217;t prohibit meat consumption, it&#8217;s only Hindu scholars that prohibits it. In the Vedas the cattle were gifted to other Deities, because it was a source of money during the Vedic period. A historian William Butler writes,</p>
<p>&#8220;The people among whom the Veda were composed, as here introduced to us, had evidently passed the nomadic stage. Their wealth consisted of Horses, Cattle, Sheep, Goats and Buffaloes. Coined money, and indeed money in any shape, was unknown. We meet but two allusions to gold, except for the purpose of ornaments. The cow was to the Vedic Hindu at once food and money.&#8221;<br />

<p>A recent survey found that 70% Indians are non-vegetarians. <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.in/2016/06/18/over-70-indians-are-meat-eaters-but-indian-tv-continues-to-vil/" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">http://www.huffingtonpost.in/2016/06/18/over-70-indians-are-meat-eaters-but-indian-tv-continues-to-vil/<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>While according to BBC report, just 20% of Indians are vegetarians,<br />
&#8220;But new research by US-based anthropologist Balmurli Natrajan and India-based economist Suraj Jacob, points to a heap of evidence that even these are inflated estimations because of &#8220;cultural and political pressures&#8221;. So people under-report eating meat &#8211; particularly beef &#8211; and over-report eating vegetarian food.<br />
Taking all this into account, say the researchers, only about 20% of Indians are actually vegetarian &#8211; much lower than common claims and stereotypes suggest.<br />
Hindus, who make up 80% of the Indian population, are major meat-eaters. Even only a third of the privileged, upper-caste Indians are vegetarian.&#8221;<br />

<p>As per National Family Health Survey (NHFS-5) 2019-21, 52.5% Hindu men and 40.7% Hindu women are non vegetarians.<br />

<p>India is also the world&#8217;s largest exporter of beef.<br />
<a href="http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-on-top-in-exporting-beef/article7519487.ece" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-on-top-in-exporting-beef/article7519487.ece<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>Despite these facts Hindus views non-vegetarians especially Muslims as demons equivalent to cannibals. Hindu apologists says that veg diet is healthy and non-veg diet is unhealthy but they aren&#8217;t aware of the fact that veg diet doesn&#8217;t provide required amount of nutrients and there are several risks associated with veg diet, vegetarians suffer from B12 deficiency. Vitamin B12 is found in non-veg food and egg is a key source of vitamin B12. You may like to go through the following links,</p>

<p><strong>Hindu Scholars on Meat Consumption</strong></p>
<p>Swami Vivekananda writes that Aryans used to relish beef,</p>
<p>&#8220;There was a time in this very India when, without eating beef, no Brahmin could remain a Brahmin&#8221; The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda, Volume 3 <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Complete_Works_of_Swami_Vivekananda/Volume_3/Lectures_from_Colombo_to_Almora/Reply_to_the_Address_of_Welcome_at_Madura" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Complete_Works_of_Swami_Vivekananda/Volume_3/Lectures_from_Colombo_to_Almora/Reply_to_the_Address_of_Welcome_at_Madura<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>Adishankaracharya writes,</p>
<p>&#8220;Odan&#8217; (rice) mixed with meat is called &#8216;Mansodan&#8217;. On being asked whose meat it should be, he answers &#8216;Uksha&#8217;. &#8216;Uksha&#8217; is used for an ox, which is capable to produce semen. Or the meat should be of a &#8216;Rishabh&#8217;. &#8216;Rishabh&#8217; is a bull more advanced in years than an &#8216;Uksha&#8217;.&#8221; <strong>Adishankaracharya in his commentary on Brihadaranyak Upanishad 6/4/18</strong></p>
<p>Ramanujacharya writes,</p>
<p>&#8220;In the Agnisomiya sacrifice no real harm is caused to the animal victim; for according to the Vedic Texts, the victim —a goat, after abandoning an inferior body, will attain a higher rebirth, with a beautiful body. The Text pertaining to immolation declares: — &#8216;O animal, by this (immolation) you never die, you are not destroyed. You will pass through happy paths to the realm of the gods, where the virtuous, not the sinful reach. May the god Savitar give you a suitable place.&#8217; (Yajñ, 4.6.9.46; Taitt. Br. iii 7.2).<br />
Likewise the attainment of more beautiful bodies by those who die here in this war [which is like a sacrifice] has been declared in the Gita (2.22). Hence, just as a surgeon makes an incision and performs other surgical procedures for the purpose of curing a patient, the immolation of the sacrificial animal in the Agnisomiya and other sacrifices contributes to its welfare.&#8221; <strong>Ramanujaacharya in his commentary on Bhagavad Gita 2.32</strong></p>
<p>If you ask Hindus as to why we shouldn&#8217;t have meat, they give irrational answer, they say &#8216;We should not slaughter animals because animals feel pain&#8217;. This answer is not convincing and is only a shift of logic. Before it was discovered that even Plants have life they used to say &#8216;We should not slaughter animals because they have life&#8217; and now they started this &#8216;Animals feel pain&#8221; issue. Here are some excerpts from Hindu texts which shows how the logic was changed,</p>
<p>Mahabharat Book 13, Section 115 &#8220;… Thou hast said so while discoursing formerly upon the ordinances in respect of Sraddhas. How can meat, however, be procured without slaying a living creature…&#8221; Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Mahabharata Book 13, Section 116 &#8220;…Flesh cannot be had from grass or wood or stone. Unless a living creature is slain, it cannot be had. Hence is the fault in eating flesh&#8230;&#8221; Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Founder of Arya Samaj Swami Dayanand Saraswati writes in his book,</p>
<p>&#8220;It is childish to say that there is no sin in eating meat…for meat cannot be had without killing animals, and it can never be right to hurt or kill animals without an offence.- Satyarth Prakash, Swami Dayanand Saraswati, p.342, Tr. Chiranjiva Bhardwaj.</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 5.48. Meat can never be obtained without injury to living creatures, and injury to sentient beings is detrimental to (the attainment of) heavenly bliss; let him therefore shun (the use of) meat.</p>
<p>These passages doesn&#8217;t say that we shouldn&#8217;t have meat because they feel pain but it says that we should not slaughter animals because they have life, they are living creatures. However these passages shouldn&#8217;t be taken as prohibition for meat consumption because Vedic deities used to consume beef every day, but meat consumption appears occasionally, i.e., for sacrifices in later texts. Manu Smriti 5.48 is explained in Vasistha Dharma Shastra 4.5-8 and Mahabharata 13.116 permits meat consumption on the condition that it is first offered to the gods and Pitrs (ancestors). I have explained those verses from Manu Smriti in this article. Researchers have found that even plants feel pain,</p>
<p>Researchers Have Found That Plants Know They Are Being Eaten<br />

<a href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/education/story/jagadish-chandra-bose-proved-plants-have-life/1/664259.html" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">http://indiatoday.intoday.in/education/story/jagadish-chandra-bose-proved-plants-have-life/1/664259.html<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>Doctors say that meat of fish, chicken and egg are very good for health then why should anyone abstain from it? Although it&#8217;s proved that even plants have life and feels pain but if vegan Hindus don&#8217;t eat meat merely because animals feel pain then will they eat egg? Egg doesn&#8217;t feel pain when you make omelette from it or boil it, so will Brahmins eat egg if the issue is all about pain? If the issue is about pain then will they be okay with slaughtering animals after proper anaesthesia is administered?</p>

<h3><a id="post-6065-Buddhism-Jainism"></a>Influence of Buddhism and Jainism on Hinduism</h3>
<p>Hundreds and thousands of animals were slaughtered as per Hindu texts. But animal slaughter became a taboo in Hindu society only after Hinduism was influenced by other religions like Buddhism and Jainism.</p>
<p>Swami Prabhupada the founder of ISKCON writes in the commentary of Bhagwad Purana 1.3.24,</p>
<p>&#8220;…Lord Buddha superficially denied the authority of the Vedas. This rejection of the Vedas by Lord Buddha was adopted in order to save people from the vice of animal-killing as well as to save the poor animals from the slaughtering process of their big brothers who clamor for universal brotherhood, peace, justice and equity. There is no justice when there is animal-killing. Lord Buddha wanted to stop it completely, and therefore his cult of ahimsa was propagated not only in India but also outside the country…&#8221; <strong>Swami Prabhupada on Bhagwad Purana 1.3.24</strong> [ <a href="http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_1.3.24" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_1.3.24<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> ]
<p>So Buddha rejected the authority of Vedas because Vedas sanctions animal slaughter and Hindus of his time sacrificed animals and he wanted them to stop this Vedic practice. Swami Vivekananda is of the same view. He writes,</p>
<p>&#8220;In what way do you see this importance of Buddhism in India today?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;It is obvious and overwhelming. You see India never loses anything; only she takes time to turn everything into bone and muscle. Buddha dealt a blow at animal sacrifice from which India has never recovered; and Buddha said, &#8216;Kill no cows&#8217;, and cow-killing is an impossibility with us.&#8221; <strong>The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda, Volume 5</strong><br />
<a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Complete_Works_of_Swami_Vivekananda/Volume_5/Interviews/Reawakening_Of_Hinduism_On_A_National_Basis" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Complete_Works_of_Swami_Vivekananda/Volume_5/Interviews/Reawakening_Of_Hinduism_On_A_National_Basis<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>Some scholars also say that people during Buddha&#8217;s time misinterpreted Vedas and started slaughtering animals in Vedic Yajnas, so to stop animal slaughter Buddha completely rejected the Vedas and established anti-Vedic philosophy called Buddhism. My question is, if Vedas do not sanction animal slaughter and people only misinterpreted the Vedas then why didn&#8217;t Buddha the avatar of Vishnu (as per Hinduism) revive the Vedas? Why wasn&#8217;t he born as a revivalist who should&#8217;ve correctly interpreted the meaning of the Vedas?</p>
<p>Following verses from Skanda Purana shows that animal slaughter was prevalent in 10<sup>th</sup> century during the reign of Kumarapala,</p>
<p>Skanda Purana III.ii.36.62 &#8220;[Kumarapala said] O Brahmanas, I shall not abide and honour the Royal Charter issued by Rama. I disown the Brahmanas who indulge in violence and kill animals in Yajna. There is no question of my having any respect for and devotion to these killers.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Kumarapala was a 10th century A.D king who had embraced Jainism, This shows that Brahmins were engaged in slaughtering animals in 10th century also. There is a story of another king named Vena who had also embraced Jainism and stopped animal slaughter in Vedic Yajnas,</p>
<p>Padma Purana II.37.32b-42 &#8220;[The sinful one said] I shall tell you another fierce act (mentioned) in the Vedas. When a guest goes (ie. arrives) to the house, a brahmana (kills and) cooks (the flesh of) a goat. (They kill) a horse in a horse- sacrifice, and a bull in a bull sacrifice; a man in human sacrifice and goats in a Vajapeya sacrifice. O great king, a great slaughter of many animals is done at a Rajasuya sacrifice. At a Pundarika sacrifice one would kill (i.e. one kills) an elephant, and at an elephant sacrifice (they kill) an elephant. At the Sautramani sacrifice a beast is seen to be fit for being sacrificed. Thus, O prince, listen how at rites of various forms of killing of beasts of various species is laid down…&#8221; Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p>Buddhism and Jainism were wiped out from India by Hindu kings and scholars probably because of their dominance and confrontation with Hinduism. Animal slaughter in Vedic sacrifices and rituals was often the main topic of debate between Buddhist/Jain and Brahmins where Buddhist/Jains had some valid points against Brahmin beliefs. Vishnu Purana says that demons after embracing Buddhism and Jainism started criticizing animal slaughter sanctioned by the Vedas, One of the main point raised by Buddhist/Jain converts was,</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 3.18.21-30 “The delusions of the false teacher paused not with the conversion of the Daityas to the Jaina and Bauddha heresies, but with various erroneous tenets he prevailed upon others to apostatize, until the whole were led astray, and deserted the doctrines and observances inculcated by the three Vedas. Some then spake evil of the sacred books; some blasphemed the gods; some treated sacrifices and other devotional ceremonies with scorn; and others calumniated the Brahmans. &#8220;The precepts,&#8221; they cried, &#8220;that lead to the injury of animal life (as in sacrifices) are highly reprehensible. To say that casting butter into flame is productive of reward, is mere childishness. If Indra, after having obtained godhead by multiplied rites, is fed upon the wood used as fuel in holy fire, he is lower than a brute, which feeds at least upon leaves. If an animal slaughtered in religious worship is thereby raised to heaven, would it not be expedient for a man who institutes a sacrifice to kill his own father for a victim? If that which is eaten by one at a Śráddha gives satisfaction to another, it must be unnecessary for one who resides at a distance to bring food for presentation in person.&#8221; Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Swami Dayanand Saraswati also writes about this,</p>
<p>&#8220;Eleven arguments in favored by the Charvaka Faith</p>
<p>3.&#8221;If the animal offered as sacrifice goes to heaven, why does not the Yajmana (master of ceremonies) send his parents, etc., to heaven, by killing them by way of sacrifice.&#8221; <strong>Satyarth Prakash, Ch 11, page 508, by Swami Dayanand Saraswati, Tr. Chiranjiva Bhardwaja</strong></p>
<p>Dayanand replies to this argument in the following way,</p>
<p>&#8220;3, 4, 5. The Veda and other Shaastras do not at all sanction animal sacrifice; the practice of offering oblations to the manes of departed ancestors is an invention of priests, because it is opposed to the Vedic and Shaastric teachings and finds sanction only in the Puraana like the Bhagvat. We have, therefore, nothing to say against the refutation of this doctrine.&#8221; <strong>Satyarth Prakash, Ch 11, page 509, by Swami Dayanand Saraswati, Tr. Chiranjiva Bhardwaja</strong></p>
<p>Swami Dayanand Saraswati cleverly tries to get rid of it by saying there is no sanction in Vedas. It&#8217;s true that Shraddha to Pitrs (ancestors) is not mentioned in Vedas but oblation to departed ancestors is mentioned in Shastras and animal slaughter is mentioned in Vedas and supported by other texts like Brahmanas, Puranas so there is no way out but to accept that Vedas permits animal slaughter. All these verses shows that Hindus used to slaughter animals till Buddhism and Jainism became prevalent and also shows that Hinduism was later influenced by these religions and adopted vegetarianism and later on animal slaughter was considered sinful in Hindu society.</p>

<p>मेष [Mesha] = Ram/Sheep.</p>
<p>पचत [Pachat] = Cooked</p>
<p>Above is Shri Ram Sharma&#8217;s Hindi translation.</p>
<p>Apologist present some verses which according to them prohibits meat consumption but those verses are quoted out of context, those verses have historical context, for instance it&#8217;s mentioned in the Vedas</p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.87.16 The <strong>fiend</strong> [non Aryan, Dasyu, Rakshas, Mleccha] who smears himself with flesh of cattle, with flesh of horses and of human bodies, Who steals the milch-cow&#8217;s milk away, O Agni,-tear off the heads of such with fiery fury.</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 1.16.4 If thou [Foreigners] destroy a cow of ours, a human being, or a steed, We pierce thee with this piece of lead so that thou mayst not slay our men.</p>
<p>These verses refer to the foreigners/Non Aryans [Maleccha, Rakshasa] or enemies of deities of Vedic period, that they should not kill the Aryans, cows or horses OF THE Aryans as Cows and Horses were sources of wealth and horses were also used for warfare, you can have meat of other castes or of foreigners (non Aryans). Who would like their wealth to be destroyed? Just like stealing milk of cow is wrong similarly killing animals belonging to other people is considered sinful in those verses. The verse Rig Veda 10.87.16 also prohibits stealing milk but it doesn&#8217;t mean that you shouldn&#8217;t consume milk, you can have milk after buying it similarly you can have meat after buying meat or animal. There may be some confusion among Hindus whether to eat cow or not but there is hardly any prohibition in Vedas to slaughter bull although Vedas do not prohibit any kind of meat.</p>
<p>Some Hindus might say those verses I mentioned above has historical context but they shouldn&#8217;t be viewed in a context as all verses are eternal and it&#8217;s applicable for all ages. Does that mean you should eat dog&#8217;s intestines when you are in deep distress? Because the Vedas says,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 4.18.13 In deep distress I cooked a dog&#8217;s intestines. Among the Gods I found not one to comfort. My consort I beheld in degradation. The Falcon then brought me the pleasant Soma.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="473" height="105" class="wp-image-6075" src="http://vedkabhed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/http-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-2016-8.png" alt="http://truthabouthinduism.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/112016_1617_meat9.png" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/http-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-2016-8.png 473w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/07/http-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-2016-8-300x67.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 473px) 100vw, 473px" /></p>
<p>This verse has a historical context which I am not going to explain, does that mean you should eat dog&#8217;s intestines when you are anxious?</p>
<p>The reason why it&#8217;s difficult to find verses on meat consumption in the Vedas (from few Hindu translators) is because some Hindu scholars don&#8217;t view the animal sacrifice as literal slaughtering but they view it as charity or symbolic slaughtering. So Hindus should ask their scholars to literally translate the Sanskrit verses on meat consumption and I am sure all their doubts on meat eating will be cleared. Vedic verses clearly uses words like Mamsa (Meat), Pachat (Cook) etc., Which is pretty clear for meat consumption but some Hindu scholars likes to add their own words into it, they give their own meanings.</p>
<p>Some Hindu apologists might say Yajnas does not contain killing, Yajnas are non-violent etc.,  But they cannot deny the fact that the animals which were brought as oblation were thrown into the fire,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.91.14-15 He [Agni/Fire] <strong>in whom</strong> horses, bulls, oxen, and barren cows, and rams, when duly set apart, are <strong>offered up</strong>,- To Agni, Soma-sprinkled, drinker of sweet juice, Disposer, with my heart I bring a fair hymn forth. Into thy [Agni&#8217;s] mouth is poured <strong>the offering</strong>, Agni, as Soma into cup, oil into ladle…</p>

<p>Manu Smriti 3.76 An oblation duly thrown into the fire, reaches the sun; from the sun comes rain, from rain food, therefrom the living creatures (derive their subsistence).</p>
<p>Rig Veda 3.59.5 The great Aditya, to be served with worship, who stirreth men, is gracious to the singer. To Mitra, him most highly to be lauded, offer in fire [the] oblation that he loveth.</p>

<p>Satapatha Brahmana 6.2.1.14 Now when he slaughters those animals, he prepares a home for Agni; for nowhere but in his home does one enjoy himself. But the home means food: it is that he lays down in, front, and when Agni sees that, he turns unto him.</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana 11:7:1:1- He performs the animal sacrifice. Now the animal sacrifice means cattle: thus, when he performs the animal sacrifice (pasubandha, the binding of the animal), it is in order that he may be possessed of cattle…And when he performs the animal sacrifice, he renews his fires, and so, along with the renewal of his fires, does the Sacrificer (renew himself), and along with the Sacrificer his house and cattle. And beneficial to life, indeed, is that redemption of his own self; for whilst he is offering the Sacrificer&#8217;s fires long for flesh; they set their minds on the Sacrificer and harbour designs on him. In other fires people do indeed cook any kind of meat, but these (sacrificial fires) have no desire for any other flesh but this (sacrificial animal), and for him to whom they belong.</p>
<p>Asvalayana Grihya Sutra, IV Adhyaya, 8 Kandika, 25 &#8220;The husks and chaff (of the rice), the tail, the skin, the head, the feet (of the sacrificial animal) he should throw into the fire.</p>
<p>Yajur Veda 20.79 O Agni [Fire], within thy mouth is poured the offering, as Soma into cup, ghee into ladle…</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="477" height="105" class="wp-image-6078" src="http://vedkabhed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/http-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-2016-11.png" alt="http://truthabouthinduism.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/112016_1617_meat12.png" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/http-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-2016-11.png 477w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/07/http-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-2016-11-300x66.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 477px) 100vw, 477px" /></p>
<p>Read Rig Veda 1.162.19 which I have mentioned above which talks about meat balls of horse put into the fire, We can obtain meat balls only after killing the horse, So it is a undeniable fact that animals were killed in the Yajna.  As I said earlier Hindu scholars don&#8217;t view the sacrifice as literal for instance Veda says</p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.104.3 To make thee [Indra] start, a strong true draught I offer to thee, the Bull [as a oblation], O thou whom Bay Steeds carry.</p>
<p>Rig Veda 5.29.8 When thou [Indra] three hundred buffaloes&#8217; flesh hadst eaten, and drunk, as Maghavan, three lakes of Soma, All the Gods raised as &#8217;twere a shout of triumph to Indra praise because he slew the Dragon.</p>
<p>I have given the Hindi translation of Rig Veda 5.29.8 by Pundit Ram Govind Trivedi. Some scholars have skipped the Sanskirt word Maas (Meat/Flesh) in their translation, A Hindu scholar Ram Acharya has translated the verse 5.29.8 as Indra &#8221;ACCEPTED&#8221; the three hundred buffaloes instead of &#8220;Eaten&#8221; he has also omitted the word Maas (Flesh/Meat), even if he just accepted the buffaloes then it means later he ate them because Veda commands Indra and Agni to eat the oblation which they receive,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.116.8 Eat, Indra, <strong>these oblations which approach thee</strong>: be pleased with food made ready and with Soma.</p>

<p>Rig Veda 2.1.13-14 The A&#8217;dityas have made thee, Agni, their mouth; the pure (deities) have made thee, Kavi, their tongue: the (gods), the givers of wealth, depend upon thee at sacrifices; they eat the offered oblation through thee [Agni]. All the benignant immortal gods eat the offered oblation through thee, as their mouth: mortals taste the flavour (of all viands) through thee: thou art born pure, the embryo of plants.</p>

<p>Indra, Agni and other gods were commanded to eat the offered oblations, therefore they did consume meat. In Vedas, there are two more verses about bulls brought for sacrifice,</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 9.4.9 …that Brahman gives a thousand who offers up the Bull as his oblation.</p>

<p>We have already read that the cattle which were brought as oblation/offerings were put in the fire and later on eaten, so it is a pretty much clear that Hindu deities used to partake beef.</p>
<p>Hindu extremists make so much hue and cry over cow slaughter today but cow slaughter was a common practice in Vedic period,</p>
<p>Krishna Yajur Veda 2.5.5.3-4 On the full moon (the Soma) is pressed for the gods; during this half-month it is pressed forth for them, and a cow for Mitra and Varuna is to be slaughtered for them at the new moon. In that he sacrifices on the day before…In that he sacrifices at the new moon with clotted curds for Mitra and Varuna, the cow which is slaughtered for the gods becomes his also.</p>
<p>Krishna Yajur Veda 2.2.9.6 At the time of the (offering of the) cow, he should offer on one potsherd to Mitra and Varuna, this (offering) corresponds to his foe&#8217;s cow which is to be slaughtered</p>
<p>Krishna Yajur Veda 5.1.8 …if he were to let them go after circumambulation with fire, he would disturb the sacrifice; if he were to keep them until the conclusion, the heads would be exhausted; in that he offers the animals, he wins thereby animals; in that he lets them go after circumambulation with fire, (it serves) to prevent the exhaustion of the heads; he concludes (the rite) with (an animal) for Prajapati; Prajapati is the sacrifice; verily he concludes the sacrifice in the sacrifice…</p>

<h3><a id="post-6065-Ashvamedha-Yajna"></a>Ashvamedha Yajna</h3>
<p>Veda clearly speaks of animal killing and putting it in the Agni (Fire) during Yajna, one of the most popular hymn about animal slaughter is from the Rig Veda about Horse sacrifice (Ashvamedha Yajna). Ashvamedha mentioned in Rig Veda deals with slaughtering and cooking of the sacrificial horse. I am using English translation of H.H Wilson and Hindi translation of Pundit Ram Govind Trivedi,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.162.9 “Whatever the flies may eat of the raw flesh of the horse; whatever (grease) is smeared upon the brush or upon the axe ; (what is smeared) upon the hands or the nails of the immolator, may all this be with thee, (horse), among the gods.” Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s see what other scriptures says about Horse Sacrifice</p>
<p>Krishna Yajur Veda 5.4.12.1 It is the twenty onefold day, <strong>on which the horse is slain</strong>, there are twelve months, five seasons; these worlds are three</p>
<p>Krishna Yajur Veda 5.3.12. The eye of Prajapati swelled, that fell away, that became a horse; because it swelled (áçvayat), that is the reason why the horse (áçva) has its name. By the horse sacrifice the gods replaced it. He who sacrifices with the horse sacrifice makes Prajapati whole; verily he becomes whole; this is the atonement for everything, and the cure for everything. All evil by it the gods overcame; by it also the gods overcame (the sins of) Brahman- slaying; all evil [1] he overcomes, he overcomes Brahman-slaying who sacrifices with the horse sacrifice, and he who knows it thus. It was the left eye of Prajapati that swelled; therefore they cut off from the horse on the left side, on the right from other animals. The mat is of reeds; the horse has its birthplace in the waters, the reed is born in the waters; verily he establishes it in its own birthplace. The Stoma is the fourfold one; the bee tore the thigh of the horse, the gods made it whole with the fourfold Stoma; in that there is the fourfold Stoma, (it is) to make whole the horse.</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagawatam (Bhagvad Purana) 4.19.11 “When Pṛthu Mahārāja was performing the last horse sacrifice [aśvamedha-yajña], King Indra, invisible to everyone, stole the horse intended for sacrifice. He did this because of his great envy of King Pṛthu.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Commentary: &#8220;King Indra is known as śata-kratu, which indicates that he has performed one hundred horse sacrifices (aśvamedha-yajña). We should know, however, that the animals sacrificed in the yajña were not killed. If the Vedic mantras were properly pronounced during the sacrifice, the animal sacrificed would come out again with a new life.&#8221; <strong>Swami Prabhupada on Srimad Bhagavatam 4.19.11</strong></p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana 11.2.5.1. And, verily, even on this occasion, they slaughter the sacrificial horse (Asvamedha) as a sacrifice to the gods…</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana 13:2:1:1-2 Pragâpati assigned the sacrifices to the gods; the Asvamedha he kept for himself. The gods said to him, &#8216;Surely, this–to wit, the Asvamedha–is a sacrifice: let us have a share in that also.&#8217; He contrived these Anna-homas (food-oblations) for them: thus when he performs the Annahomas, it is the gods he thereby gratifies. With ghee he makes offering, for ghee is fiery mettle: by means of fiery mettle he thus lays fiery mettle into him (the horse and Sacrificer). With ghee he offers; for that–to wit, ghee–is the gods&#8217; favourite resource: it is thus with their favourite resource he supplies them.</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana 11:2:5:5 Verily, then, for him who, knowing this, offers both the Agnihotra and the Full and New-moon sacrifices, they slaughter the sacrificial horse month by month; and month by month the Asvamedha is offered for him, and his Agnihotra and Full and New-moon sacrifices come to pass into the Asvamedha.</p>
<p>Valmiki Ramayan Bala Kanda 1, Sarga 14, Verses 33-38 “With great delight coming on her Queen Kausalya reverently made circumambulations to the horse, and symbolically killed the horse with three knives. Queen Kausalya desiring the results of ritual disconcertedly resided one night with that horse that flew away like a bird…Then the priest, one with controlled senses and rich in scriptural wealth, took up the omentum [fat] of the horse and cooked it as per scriptures while dropping into the altar of fire to bake as a food to the celestials…Those remaining body parts that horse are there, the sixteen officiating priests have procedurally oblated all of them into fire.” Tr. Desiraju Hanumanta Rao</p>
<p>Brahma Purana 104.137 &#8220;After performing these tasks Rama the most excellent among the virtuous performed ten horse-sacrifices where flesh was offered to the deities.&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Swami Vivekananda and Swami Dayanand Saraswati said that whatever from the Puranas (or other text also) contradicts the Vedas then it must be rejected without any mercy. And verses from Shatapatha Brahmana and Puranas confirms that the horse was slaughtered in Ashvamedha Yajna. So there is no way that apologists can now twist verses from Vedas about Horse-sacrifice.</p>

<h3><a id="post-6065-Cows-Guests"></a>Killing cows and offering its meat to guests</h3>
<p>Cattle were slaughtered for guests. But as per Swami Vivekananda this practise was later stopped. Sometimes we may wonder how an animal like cow became so sacred that Hindus started worshiping it and also prohibited its slaughter. When you ask any Hindu why he considers the Cow to be his Mother, he will tell you that &#8216;Since cow gives us milk, we consider it to be our mother&#8217;.</p>
<p>In the Vedas even the earth is considered a Mother. The reason for this may be because food grows from the soil. So Hindus considers all such things to be their mother whichever provides them with food. As we have already read some references about cattle used as source of money and ploughing the fields. It could be that people in ancient India heavily relied on Agriculture. Many farmers in India still plough fields with the help of Bulls and Cows. So killing cattle would result in heavy loss for such people, thus the prohibition of killing cows may have enacted. Swami Vivekananda writes,</p>
<p>&#8220;you read in the Vedas how, when a Sannyasin, a king, or a great man came into a house, the best bullock was killed. How in time it was found that as we were an agricultural race, killing the best bulls meant annihilation of the race. Therefore the practice was stopped, and a voice was raised against the killing of cows. Sometimes we find existing then what we now consider the most horrible customs.&#8221; <strong>The Complete Works of Swami Vivekandan, Volume 3</strong><br />

<p>Hindu scriptures commands to slaughter cattle or goat for the guests,</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti 51.64 When honoring a guest, at a sacrifice, or when worshipping the manes, or the gods, a man may slay cattle, but not otherwise on any account.</p>
<p>Sankhayana Grihya Sutra 2.15.1-3 Should any one of the six persons (mentioned in the Srauta-sutra and in the Sutras 4-9) to whom the Arghya reception is due, visit (him), let him make (ready) a cow, a goat, or what (sort of food) he thinks most like (thereto). Let the Argha not be without flesh. On the occasion of a sacrifice and of a wedding let (the guest) say, &#8216;Make it (ready).&#8217;</p>
<p>Kausitaki Brahmana 1.15 …Just as in the world when a human king has come, or another deserving person, they slay an ox or a cow that miscarries; so for him they slay in that they kindle the fire, for Agni is the victim of the gods.</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana 3:4:1:2. Now as to why it is called &#8216;guest-offering.&#8217; He, the purchased Soma, truly comes as his (the sacrificer&#8217;s) guest,–to him (is offered) that (hospitable reception): even as for a king or a Brâhman one would cook a large ox or a large he-goat–for that is human (fare offered to a guest), and the oblation is that of the gods–so he prepares for him that guest-offering.</p>
<p>Asvalayana Grihya Sutra 1.24.33 Let the Madhuparka not be without flesh, without flesh.</p>
<p>Madhuparka means offerings to the guest. Krishna tells Yuddhisthira,</p>
<p>Mahabharata Book 14, Section 2 “…And then Kesava (Krishna) accosted him,&#8211;&#8216;If a person indulges excessively in sorrow for his departed forefathers, he grieves them. (Therefore, banishing grief), do thou (now) celebrate many a sacrifice with suitable presents to the priests; and do thou gratify the gods with Soma liquor, and the manes of thy forefathers with their due food and drink. Do thou also gratify thy guests with meat and drink and the destitute with gifts commensurate with their desires…” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>On the occasion of Rukmini&#8217;s marriage with Krishna, Rukmi tells his father to slaughter a lakh cows, two lakh deers, 4 lakhs of rabbits and tortoise, ten lakhs of goats and 40 lakhs of sheep,</p>
<p>Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Krishna Janma Khanda 105. 47-67 &#8220;Get also slaughtered a lakh of cows, two lakhs of deer, 4 lakhs of rabbits and tortoise. Reverentially sacrifice to the village goddess on the night of the ful moon ten lakhs of goats and sheep four times the number of the last named and get the flesh properly cooked for food. O lord of the world, get also vegetables cooked for the purpose. The monarch Bhismaka having heard the words of his son took his family priest aside and also sent a suitable Brahmin to Dwarka. He fixed a date which was regarded auspicious unanimously&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Rajendra Nath Sen</p>
<p>Cow is also called Aghnya, Yaska in Nirukta has given two definitions for this word, one is that cow is not to be killed and another one is that cow is called Aghnya because it is a destroyer of sins. Cow is destroyer of sin because sacrificing it emancipates ones sins,</p>
<p>Grihya Sutra of Hiranyakesin I Prasna, 4 Patala, 14 Section, verses 11-16 &#8220;That (cow is either killed or let loose. If he chooses to let it loose, (he murmurs), &#8216;This cow will become a milch cow&#8217;&#8230;If it shall be killed, (he says), &#8216;A cow art thou; sin is driven away from thee. Drive away my sin and the sin of N.N.! Kill ye him whoever hates me. He is killed whosoever hates me. Make (the cow) ready!&#8217; If (the cow) is let loose, a meal is prepared with other meat, and he announces it (to the guest) in the words, &#8216;It is ready!&#8217; He replies, &#8216;It is well prepared; it is Virag; it is food. May it not fail! May I obtain it&#8230;Give food to the Brahmanas!&#8217; After those (Brahmanas) have eaten, (the hose) orders blameless (?) food to be brought to him (i.e. to the guest).</p>
<p>Scholars have opined that milch cows were not slaughtered and only barren cows were slaughtered as slaughtering milch cows would result in heavy loss.</p>

<h3><a id="post-6065-Meat-Consumption"></a>Meat consumption in other Hindu scriptures</h3>
<p>Hindu text even permits the meat of cow,</p>
<p>Apastamba Dharma Shastra Prasna I, Patala 5, Khanda 17, 30-31 (But the meat) of milch-cows and oxen may be eaten. The Vâgasaneyaka declares &#8216;bull&#8217;s flesh is fit for offerings.&#8217; 37. Five-toed animals (ought not to be eaten) with the exception of the iguana, the tortoise, the porcupine, the hedgehog, the rhinoceros, the hare, and the Pûtikhasha.</p>
<p>Vasistha Dharma Shastra 14.46. It is declared in the Vâgasaneyaka, that (the flesh of) milch-cows and oxen is fit for offerings.</p>
<p>Hinduism also permits meat of the following animals, birds and fishes,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 5.18 The porcupine, the hedgehog, the iguana, the rhinoceros, the tortoise, and the hare they declare to be eatable; likewise those (domestic animals) that have teeth in one jaw only, excepting camels.</p>
<p>Padma Purana III.56.31b-46 &#8220;&#8230;O best ones, Prajapati Manu has said that these animals with five claws may be always eaten: alligator, tortoise, hare, rhinoceros, porcupine. He may also eat fish with scales, and the flesh of (the deer called) ruru after having presented them to deities and brahmanas, and not otherwise. O best brahmanas, so also (the flesh of) a peacock, a patridge, a pigeon, a cataka, rhinoceros, a crane, a swan. Thus said Prajapati (Manu). These fish, viz. (the glittering fish) saphari, simhatunda, pathina and rohita are directed as fit to be eaten. With a desire (to retain the status) as a twice-born he should eat the flesh of these after it is sprinkled over; even if he is about to loose his life he should duly use it. He should not at all eat flesh. He who eats what remains, is not smeared (with sin). If he is weak, he should eat flesh as medicine, or by an order or for sacrificial purposes. He, who would give up flesh when invited at a sraddha or a rite in honour of a deity, goes to (i.e. lives) in hell for as many years as the number of hair of the beast&#8230;&#8221; Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p>Agni Purana 168.12-23 &#8220;&#8230;Animals having five nails such as the Shallaki, the Godha, the rhinoceros, and the tortoise are clean animals; and accordingly their flesh may be taken without any impunity. Flesh of animals other than the five mentioned in the preceding line, should be deemed impure. There is no harm in eating such fishes as Pathin, Rohita, and Sinhatunda&#8230;&#8221; Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Yajnavalkya Smriti verse 177-8 Of the five toed animals, the porcupine the iguana-lizard, the tortoise, the hedge-hog; and the hare; among fishes the Simhatundaka and the Rohita. So also the pathina, the Rajiva, the sasalka may be eaten by the twice born classes.</p>
<p>Brahma Purana 113.111-2 &#8220;The following can be eaten: hare, tortoise, alligator, porcupine and the fish with darts (?) The village boar and the cock should be avoided. In the following circumstances, even if one eats meat, one is not defiled: if it is the remnant of offerings unto the Pitrs, Devas etc. or if it is cooked in Sraddha at the request of the brahmins and is sprinkled with the holy water or if it is taken as a medicine.&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Vamana Purana 15.2-3 &#8220;Rice cooked well with oil or ghee, even if it be stored for a long time is fit to be eaten. Rice without any oil or ghee, and delicate preparations of milk, meat of the rabbit, porcupine, alligator, hedgehog, fish and tortoise, pulses and similar other things are fit to be eaten, said Manu.&#8221; Tr. Ananda Swarup Gupta</p>

<p>Sankha Samhita 13.25 &#8220;A Sraddha ceremony performed by offering oblations of Vala Sakas, bird&#8217;s flesh, the flesh of a rhinoceros, or a large-scaled fish, bears infinite fruit. This is the opinion of Yama, the law-giver.&#8221; Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Sankha Samhita 17.22 &#8220;Golden coloured godhas, tortoises, porcupines, hares, although they belong to the group of five nailed creatures, are animals whose flesh may be eaten; but having killed of any of these animals, one should practise the above-said penance.&#8221; Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Sankha Samhita 17.27 &#8220;Pheasants, peacocks, Lavaakas, Kapinjaras, Vartakas, and Bardhrinasas are birds, whose flesh, according to holy Yama, may be always eaten.&#8221; Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Usana Samhita 3.107 &#8220;This Sraddha is called Pindanvaharyakam. In the afternoon of the day, when the waning of the Moon takes place, the twice-born should perform it with sanctified fish and meat.&#8221; Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Manu Smriti clearly allow consumption of meat,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 5.29  What is destitute of motion is the food of those endowed with locomotion; (animals)  without fangs (are the food) of those with fangs, those without hands of those who possess hands, and the timid of the bold.</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 5.30 The eater who daily even devours those destined to be his food, commits no sin; for the creator himself created both the eaters and those who are to be eaten (for those special purposes).</p>
<p>Above Manu Smriti verse might sound contradicting to other verse of Manu which says,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 5.41 On offering the honey-mixture (to a guest), at a sacrifice and at the rites in honour of the manes, but on these occasions <strong>only</strong>, may an animal be slain; that (rule) Manu proclaimed.</p>
<p>What some Hindu apologists do is they quote these two verse and says &#8220;See these two verses are contradicting each other, one says we can slaughter animals only on occasions but other says we can slaughter animals daily so this proves Manu Smriti is interpolated&#8221; It&#8217;s so easy to say fake translation and Manu Smriti is corrupted to escape the argument, But the next verse explains it,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 5.32 He who eats meat, <strong>when he honours the gods and manes</strong>, commits no sin, whether he has bought it, or himself has killed (the animal), or has received it as a present from others.</p>
<p>So the condition to eat the meat is, he should honor the god, if he doesn&#8217;t then it&#8217;s a minor offense.</p>
<p>Internet Arya Samajis considers Manu Smriti to be unauthentic. Manu Smriti is the second most authentic scripture of Arya Samaj, Vedas are the most sacred Sruti and the Manu Smriti is the most authentic Smriti, Swami Dayanand Saraswati the founder of Arya Samaj writes in his book,</p>
<p>Q. ~ Well sir! Have you no faith even in what the Parashar says:<br />
A. ~ …. <strong>Among the Smrities, the Manu Smriti alone is authentic.- Satyarth Prakash</strong> pg 142, Tr. Chiranjiva Bhardwaja</p>
<p>Dayanand recommended reading Manu Smriti to understand several things, Moreover he used approximately 250 verses of Manu Smriti in his book Satyarth Prakash, If Manu Smriti is so corrupted (corrupted according to some keyboard warriors) then why did Dayanand used 250 Shlokas of Manu Smriti in his book Satyarth Prakash? This proves Manu Smriti is the most authentic Smriti of Arya Samaj no matter today if some keyboard warriors reject it. In a debate between Dayanand and an Orthodox Hindu named Tara Charan, Dayanand accepted that Manu Smriti and few other texts are authoritative and they are based on the Vedas</p>
<p>Some Hindu apologists try to show there is no violence in Yajnas therefore killing animals during Yajna is prohibited, let me give an example to refute this point. Drinking alcohol is illegal in Saudi Arabia, if you trade or drink alcohol there you will be imprisoned, but in India drinking or trade of alcohol is legal and you won&#8217;t be imprisoned for it similarly killing animals in Yajnas is permissible and is a non-violent act.</p>

<h3><a id="post-6065-Sacrifice-Ritual"></a>Animal sacrifice for Vedic sacrifice and rituals</h3>
<p>Hinduism permits slaughtering the following animals for Vedic sacrifices and rituals,</p>
<p>Sankha Samhita 13.25 &#8220;A S&#8217;raddha ceremony performed by offering oblations of Vala Sakas, bird&#8217;s flesh, the flesh of a rhinoceros, or a large scaled fish, bears infinite fruit. This is the opinion of Yama, the law-giver.&#8221; Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana even say that meat is the best food,</p>
<p>Satapatha Brahmana 11.7.1.3. Now, when he performs the animal offering. He thereby redeems himself–male by male, for the victim is a male, and the Sacrificer is a male. And this, indeed, to wit, flesh, is the best kind of food: he thus becomes an eater of the best kind of food. Let not a year pass by for him without his offering; for the year means life: it is thus immortal life he thereby confers upon himself.</p>
<p>Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 6.4.18 And if a man wishes that a learned son should be born to him, famous, a public man, a popular speaker, that he should know all the Vedas, and that he should live to his full age, then, after having prepared boiled rice with meat and butter, they should both eat, being fit to have offspring. The meat should be of a young or of an old bull.</p>

mouth is the Ahavaniya-fire; and this is done to increase our bodily vigour, to gain the world of purity, and for the sake of immortality.</p>

Let him present to the manes balls of meat mixed with curds, barley, and jujubes, with the part of his hand sacred to the gods, or with that sacred to Prajápati.

They can be eaten after offering them to the deities and the Brahmanas and not otherwise. The Prajapati has said that the peacock, the francoline patridge, the Kapinjala (a variety of the ruddy goose), the rhenocero and the panther can be eaten. O leading sages, among fishes, these are mentioned as worthy of being eaten, viz: the Rajivas (lotus-like ones) the Simhatundas (lion-snouted), the Pathinas and the Rohitas. The flesh of these must be sprinkled with holy water and consecrated before eating if the Brahmanas so desires. One shall eat meat in accordance with the injunctions or as enjoined at a time when life is in danger.

But those who make the division otherwise are like scoundrels and miscreants who kill an animal merely (for gratifying their lust after flesh. This division of the sacrificial animal was invented by the Rishi Devabhaga, a son of Sruta. When he was departing from this life, he did not entrust (the secret to any one). But a supernatural being communicated it to Girija, the son of Babhru. Since his time men study it.&#8221; Tr. Martin Haug</p>

<h3><a id="post-6065-Shraddha-Pitrs"></a>Animal slaughter at Shraddha for Pitrs (ancestors)</h3>
<p>Mahabharata book 13 section 88 Manu has said that if a Sraddha is performed with a copious measure of sesame, such Sraddha becomes inexhaustible. Of all kinds of food, sesame seeds are regarded as the best. With fishes offered at Sraddhas, the Pitris remain gratified for a period of two months. With mutton they remain gratified for three months and with the flesh of the hare for four. With the flesh of the goat, O king, they remain gratified for five months, with bacon for six months, and with the flesh of birds for seven. With venison obtained from those deer that are called Prishata, they remain gratified for eight months, and with that obtained from the Ruru for nine months, and with the meat of the Gavaya for ten months. With the meat of the buffalo their gratification lasts for eleven months. With beef presented at the Sraddha, their gratification, it is said, lasts for a full year. Payasa mixed with ghee is as much acceptable to the Pitris as beef. With the meat of the Vadhrinasa the gratification of the Pitris lasts for twelve years. The flesh of the rhinoceros, offered to the Pitris on the anniversaries of the lunar days on which they died, becomes inexhaustible. The potherb called Kalasaka, the petals of the Kanchana flower, and meat of the goat also, thus offered, prove inexhaustible.</p>
<p>Apastamba Dharma Shastra, Prasna II, Patala 7, Khanda 16.3-4 At that (rite) the Manes (of one&#8217;s father, grandfather, and great-grand father) are the deities (to whom the sacrifice is offered). But the Brâhmanas, (who are fed,) represent the Âhavanîya-fire. That rite must be performed in each month [26] Beef satisfies (the Manes) for a year.</p>
<p>Apastamba Dharma Shastra, Prasna II, Patala 7, Khanda 17.1-3 (If) rhinoceros&#8217; meat (is given to Brahmanas seated) on (seats covered with) the skin of a rhinoceros, (the Manes are satisfied) for a very long time. (The same effect is obtained) by (offering the) flesh (of the fish called) Satabali, And by (offering the) meat of the (crane called)</p>
<p>Gautama Dharma Shastra 15.15. The Manes are satisfied for a month by gifts of sesamum, Masha-beans, rice, barley, and water, For (three) years by fish and the flesh of common deer, spotted deer, hares, turtles, <strong>boars</strong>, and sheep,For twelve years by cow&#8217;s milk and messes made of milk, For a very long time by the flesh of (the crane called) Vardhrinasa, by Ocyrnurn sanctum (sacred Basil), and by the flesh of goats, (especially) of a red (he-goat), and of a rhinoceros, (if these dishes are) mixed with honey.</p>
<p>Maharishi Manu writes,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 3.266-72 I will now fully declare what kind of sacrificial food, given to the manes according to the rule, will serve for a long time or for eternity. The ancestors of men are satisfied for one month with sesamum grains, rice, barley, masha beans, water, roots, and fruits, which have been given according to the prescribed rule, Two months with fish, three months with the meat of gazelles, four with mutton, and five indeed with the flesh of birds, Six months with the flesh of kids, seven with that of spotted deer, eight with that of the black antelope, but nine with that of the (deer called) Ruru, Ten months they are satisfied with the meat of boars and buffaloes, but eleven months indeed with that of hares and tortoises, One year with cow-milk and milk-rice; from the flesh of a long-eared white he-goat their satisfaction endures twelve years. The (vegetable called) Kalasaka, (the fish called) Mahasalka, the flesh of a rhinoceros and that of a red goat, and all kinds of food eaten by hermits in the forest serve for an endless time.</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 2.16.1-3 “AURVA continued.–&#8221;Ancestors are satisfied for a month with offerings of rice or other grain, with clarified butter, with fish, or the flesh of the hare, of birds, of the hog, the goat, the antelope, the deer, the gayal, or the sheep, or with the milk of the cow, and its products. They are for ever satisfied with flesh (in general), and with that of the long-eared white goat in particular. The flesh of the rhinoceros, the Kálaśáka potherb, and honey, are also especial sources of satisfaction to those worshipped at ancestral ceremonies.” Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>Yajnavalkya Smriti verse 258-59 (The Pitris are satisfied) verily for a moth with the havisya (sacrificial food), but for a year with the milk rice, with the fish, with the meat of gazelles, with mutton, with the flesh of birds, with the flesh of kids, with flesh of spotted deer. With the flesh of black antelope, with that of Ruru deer, with the meat of boars, and with the meat of hares respectively for a period progessively increasing by a month are satisfied when offered to the Grandfathers here.</p>
<p>Markandeya Purana 32.2-5; Matsya Purana 17-31-36 The Pitris are satisfied with clarified butter and rice for a month. The paternal grandfathers receive satisfaction with fish meat for two months. Venison should be known to satisfy the pitris for three months; and the flesh of hares nourishes the pitris for four months; bird&#8217;s flesh satisfies them for five months; hog&#8217;s flesh for six months; goat&#8217;s flesh for seven months; and flesh of the black antelope for eight months; flesh of the ruru deer gives them satisfication for nine months, without doubt; flesh of gayal gives satisfaction for ten months.</p>
<p>Same is repeated in in Kurma Purana II.20.37-54 which also talks about giving meat to Brahmins as food. Narada Purana Uttarabhaga 44.51; Vayu Purana 21-2-9; Agni Purana 117.44-48; Padma Purana 1.9.153-157; Agni Purana 163.28-39; Brahma Purana 111.15-33; Brahmanda Purana 2.3.19.2-10 similar thing is also said in Garuda Purana I.99.37- 38; Matsya Purana 15.34-35; Matsya Purana 204.6-9; Narada Purana II.51.142b-145a; Padma Purana 1.9.62-63 including the following verses,</p>
<p>Markandeya Purana 35.2-4 &#8220;&#8230;The hare, the tortoise, the gosamp, the porcupine, and the rhinoceros, my son, these indeed may be eaten; and domestic pig and fowl should be eschewed. The remains of food at a sraddha after the pitris and gods and other recipients have been satisfied may be eaten at the desire of the brahmanas. A man who eats flesh that has been killed for the purpose of medicine is not defiled.&#8221;</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti 30.34 Now he who studies the hymns of the Rig-veda (regularly), feeds the manes with clarified butter. 37 He who studies the Atharva-veda, (feeds them) with meat.</p>
<p>Markandeya Purana 32.31-34 &#8220;At this ceremony also songs in honour of the pitris are sung by those who recite the Veda, songs which were formerly sung by the pitris to king Puruavas. &#8220;When will any one of use have a son, the chief among his race, who, eating the remains food left by yogis, will offer the pinda on earth? Or will offer pinda, buffalo-beef, the clarified butter, or the vegetable kala mixed with sesamum-seed, or khichree at Gaya for our monthly satisfaction? May we obtain the offering to the Visvadevas and the soma juice, buffalo-beef, and the finest clarified butter, and the divine food by getting a young rhinoceros!&#8221;</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti 80.1-14 Sesamum, rice, barley, beans, water, roots, fruits, vegetables, Syâmâka grain, millet, wild rice, kidney-beans, and wheat satisfy (the manes) for a month; The flesh of fishes (excepting those species that are forbidden), for two months; The flesh of the common deer, for three months; The flesh of sheep, for four months; The flesh of birds (of those kinds that may be eaten), for five months; The flesh of goats, for six months; The flesh of the spotted deer, for seven months; The flesh of the spotted antelope, for eight months; Beef, for nine months; Buffalo&#8217;s meat, for ten months; The meat of a hornless goat, for eleven months; The milk of a cow, or preparations from it, for a year. On this subject there exists a stanza, which the manes utter: &#8216;(The pot-herb) Kâlasâka (sacred basil), (the prawn) Mahâsalka, and the flesh of the (crane called) Vârdhrînasa[1], (and of) a rhinoceros having no horn, is food which we always accept.&#8217;</p>
<p>Agni Purana 117.44-48 &#8220;Now I shall discuss the nature of satisfaction which the different sorts of cakes or oblations respectively impart to the souls of one&#8217;s ancestors. Oblations composed of cereals grown in villages as well as forest fruits, bulbs and roots last one&#8217;s forefathers for a month, while those consisting of fishes and venison would serve them well for double or triple that division of time. The peculiar kind of venison known as the Rouravas would gratify them for five months, whereas games and wild fowls would last them for four months. The departed soul are supposed to live satisfactorily upon goat&#8217;s meat for six months, meat of tortoise, pork, mutton, and buffalo flesh lasting them for seven, eight, nine and ten months respectively. Sweetened porridge and butter of cow milk offered in a clarified state would gratify them for a whole year, while the meat of a full grown sacrificial goat (Vardrinasa) as well as the sword of a rhinoceros, flesh of an antelope or that of a red goat and honey should be considered as their full and proper ration for a period of three consecutive&#8217; months. Offerings made during the rainy season consist of fishes having large scales, while a Shraddha ceremony performed on the day on which the moon enters the asterisk Magha should be supposed as hearing immortal fruits.&#8221; Tr. M.N. Dutt</p>
<p>Usana Samhita 3.137-141 &#8220;one should, with care, give at a Sraddha, deer, lamb and tortoise. With fish and meat, [the Manes attain to gratification for] two months; and [for] three months, with the meat of deer. With mutton, [they are gratified for] four months; with the meat of birds, [for] five months; with the meat of goat, [for] six months; and with the meat of Ruru deer, [for] nine months. With the meat of buffalo and pork, [they] are gratified for ten months; and with the meat of hare and tortoise, for eleven months. With cow&#8217;s milk and Payasa (milk and boiled-rice), [they attain to gratification for] one year. With the meat of rhinoceros, [they attain to] gratification for twelve years. Black pot herbs, sea-scrabs, meat of rhinoceros and black goat, honey and all other roots leads to their everlasting gratification.&#8221; Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>
<p>Grihya Sutra of Hiranyakesin II Prasna, 5 Patala, 15 section, 1-9 On the following day he sacrifices a cow to the Fathers&#8230;When it has been sprinkled and fire has been carried round it, they kill it to the west of the fire, its head being turned to the west, its feet to the south. After it has been killed, he silently &#8216;strengthens&#8217; its sense-organs (by touching them) with water, and silently takes out the omentum, the heart, and the kidneys.…He sacrifices the omentum entirely. The other parts (Sutra 5) he should offer to the Brahmanas and should feed them (with those parts of the cow). When the food (for the Brahmanas) is ready, he cuts off (the Avadanas) together from the mess of boiled rice, and form the pieces of meat, and mixing them with clarified butter he makes oblations thereof with the verses, &#8216;Behold the Ekashtaka, the giver of food with meat and ghee, (which is offered) with (the word) svadha. By the Brahmanas that food is purified. May it be an imperishable (blessings to me! Svadha! Adoration!&#8217;</p>
<p>Grihya Sutra of Apastamba Patala 8, Section 22, 3-5 &#8220;On the following day he touches a cow with a Darbha blade, with the words, &#8216;I touch thee agreeable to the Fathers.&#8217; having silently offered five Agya oblations, and having cooked the omentum of the (cow), and performed the &#8216;spreading under&#8217; and the sprinkling over (of Agya), he sacrifices (the omentun) with the next (verse, II, 20, 28) with a Palasa leaf from the middle or the end (of the stalk). (He sacrifices) boiled rice together with the meat (of the cow) with the next (verses, II, 20, 29-35)</p>
<p>Asvalayana Grihya Sutra, 1 Adhyaya, 11 Kandika, 1-10 &#8220;Now (follows) the ritual of the animal sacrifice&#8230;To the west of the Samitra (fire) he (the Samitri) kills (the animal), the head of which is turned to the east or to the west, the feet to the north; and having placed a grass-blade on his side of the (animal&#8217;s) navel, (the &#8216;performer&#8217;) draws out the omentum, cuts off the omentum, seizes it with the two Agnisrapanis, sprinkles it with water, warms it at the Samitra (fire), takes it before that fire, roasts it, being seated to the south, goes round (the two fires), and sacrifices it.</p>
<p>Instructions on animal sacrifice is also mentioned in Asvalayana Grihya Sutra, II Adhyaya, 4 Kandika, 13; Asvalayana Grihya Sutra, IV Adhyaya, 8 Kandika, 16-18</p>
<p>Gutama Dharma Shastra 17.37-38 And (animals) that must be slain for (the fulfilment of) the sacred law. Let him eat (the flesh of animals) killed by beasts of prey, after having washed it, if no blemish is visible, and if it is declared to be fit for use by the word (of a Brahmana). I.e animals offered at Sraddhas and Srauta-sacrifices, though under other circumstances forbidden, may be eaten both by the priests and other Brahmanas.</p>
<p>Padma Purana 1.33.80 &#8220;O you of a good vow, satisfy the brahmanas with musk, and flesh and various kinds of grains, and by offering a Sraddha.&#8221; Tr. N.A. Deshpande</p>
<p>All these animals sacrificed to gods and manes is supposed to be eaten by the Brahmin priest. Some Aryas may cry that this has nothing to do with Hinduism, these are interpolated texts. But for their kind information, interpolation can occur only in one text, the same interpolation cannot happen in several texts like Manu Smriti, Yajnvalkya Smriti, Mahabharata, Vishnu, Markandeya, Matsya Puranas, Dharma Shastras and so on. The fact that this Shraddha for Pitrs occurs in so many Smritis and Puranas proves that Sages who wrote these books agreed with it, so do Hindus mean to say they know more about Hinduism than their sages?</p>

<h3><a id="post-6065-Rejecting-Meat"></a>Rejecting meat offered at Vedic sacrifice and ritual is sinful</h3>
<p>Hindu texts even say that one who refuses to eat meat offered to gods and manes at Shraddha is punished after death,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 5.35 But a man who, being duly engaged (to officiate or to dine at a sacred rite), refuses to eat meat, becomes after death an animal during twenty-one existences.</p>
<p>Vasistha Dharma Shastra 11.34 &#8216;But an ascetic who, invited to dine at a sacrifice of the manes or of the gods, rejects meat, shall go to hell for as many years as the slaughtered beast has hairs.&#8217;</p>
<p>Kurma Purana 2.17.40 &#8220;If a person invited for the Sraddha or the worship of a deity eschews meat he may have to be in the hell as many years as there are hairs on the body of the animal.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Kurma Purana II.22.74-75 &#8220;An excellent Brahmana engaged in the Sraddha should not avoid anything served. He should not refuse even the meat offered. One should not look at the food served to another person. If the Brahmanas who engaged in the Pitr rite, does not partake of the meat served, he is reborn as an animal for twenty-one births.&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>Vyasa Samhita 3.56-57 &#8220;A Brahmana, engaged in the celebration of a religious sacrifice, becomes degraded by not taking meat. A Kshatriya should eat the cooked flesh of a quarry after having propitiated therewith the gods and his departed manes. A Vaishya can take meat, lawfully obtained for money, after having worshipped therewith his departed manes.&#8221; Tr. Manmatha Nath Dutt</p>

<h3><a id="post-6065-Animals-Sacrifice"></a>Animals are created for sacrifice</h3>
<p>Manu Smriti 5.31-42 The consumption of meat (is befitting) for  sacrifices,&#8217; that is declared to be a rule made by the gods; but to persist (in using it) on other (occasions) is said to be a proceeding worthy of Rakshasas. He who eats meat, when he honours the gods and manes, commits no sin, whether he has bought it, or himself has killed (the animal), or has received it as a present from others…After death the guilt of one who slays deer for gain is not as (great) as that of him who eats meat for no (sacred) purpose. But a man who, being duly engaged (to officiate or to dine at a sacred rite), refuses to eat meat, becomes after death an animal during twenty-one existences…If he has a strong desire (for meat) he may make an animal of clarified butter or one of flour, (and eat that); but let him never seek to destroy an animal without a (lawful) reason. As many hairs as the slain beast has, so often indeed will he who killed it without a (lawful) reason suffer a violent death in future births. Svayambhu (the Self-existent) himself created animals for the sake of sacrifices; sacrifices (have been instituted) for the good of this whole (world); hence the slaughtering (of beasts) for sacrifices is not slaughtering (in the ordinary sense of the word)&#8230;On offering the honey-mixture (to a guest), at a sacrifice and at the rites in honour of the manes, but on these occasions only, may an animal be slain; that (rule) Manu proclaimed. A twice-born man who, knowing the true meaning of the Veda, slays an animal for these purposes, causes both himself and the animal to enter a most blessed state.</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti 51.61 It is for sacrifices that beasts have been created by the self-existent (Brahman) himself. Sacrificing causes the whole universe to prosper; therefore is the slaughter (of beasts) for a sacrifice no slaughter.</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti 51.65 That twice-born man who, knowing the exact truth (promulgated) in the Veda, slays cattle for the sacrifices (ordained in the Veda) will convey himself and the cattle (slain by him) to a blissful abode.</p>
<p>Chandogya Upanishad 8.15.1  …never giving pain to any creature, except at the tirthas  (sacrifices, &amp;c.), he who behaves thus all his life, reaches the world of Brahman, and does not return, yea, he does not return..</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam (Bhagvad Purana) 11.5.11 “In this material world the conditioned soul is always inclined to sex, meat-eating and intoxication. Therefore religious scriptures never actually encourage such activities. Although the scriptural injunctions provide for sex through sacred marriage, for meat-eating through sacrificial offerings and for intoxication through the acceptance of ritual cups of wine, such ceremonies are meant for the ultimate purpose of renunciation.” Tr. Swami Prabhupada</p>
<p>Mahabharata Book 3, Section 207 “And in days of yore, O Brahmana, two thousand animals used to be killed every day in the kitchen of king Rantideva…&#8217;The sacred fire is fond of animal food,&#8217; this saying has come down to us. And at sacrifices animals are invariably killed by regenerate Brahmanas, and these animals being purged of sin, by incantation of hymns, go to heaven. If, O Brahmana, the sacred fire had not been so fond of animal food in ancient times, it could never have become the food of any one. And in this matter of animal food, this rule has been laid down by Munis:–Whoever partakes of animal food after having first offered it duly and respectfully to the gods and the manes, is not polluted by the act. And such a man is not at all considered to have partaken of animal food…” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.163.12-13 “The strong Steed hath come forward to the slaughter, pondering with a mind directed God-ward. The goat who is his kin is led before him the sages and the singers follow after. The Steed is come unto the noblest mansion, is come unto his Father and his Mother. This day shall he approach the Gods, most welcome: then he declares good gifts to him who offers.” Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>Above verses from Mahabharata and Veda says that animals killed in Vedic sacrifice goes to heaven, on this statement I would like to mention the argument of Jains and Buddhists against this,</p>
<p>&#8220;If an animal slaughtered in religious worship is thereby raised to heaven, would it not be expedient for a man who institutes a sacrifice to kill his own father for a victim?&#8221;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a id="post-6065-Killing-nonviolent"></a>Killing animal is non-violent</h3>
<p>Vedic verses clearly tells us that killing animal is part of Yajna (sacrifice). Maharshi Manu also writes that slaughtering animals for sacrifices is non-violent,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 5.44 Know that the injury to moving creatures and to those destitute of motion, which the Veda has prescribed for certain occasions, is no injury at all; for the sacred law shone forth from the Veda.</p>
<p>Whether animals should be killed in Yajna (Sacrifices) or not is explained in detail in the Devi Bhagawatam,</p>
<p>Devi Bhagwatam 1.18.48-61 &#8220;…O King! One can see before one&#8217;s eyes that the drinking of Soma rasa, the killing of animals, the eating of fish and flesh and so are advised in the Vedas; so much so that in the sacrificial ceremony named Sautrâmana the rule of drinking wine and many other vratas are clearly mentioned; even gambling is advised in the Vedas. So how can Mukti be obtained by following the Veda Dharma? It is heard that, in ancient times, there was a great king, named S&#8217;as&#8217;avindu, very religious, truthful, and performing sacrifices, very liberal; he protected the virtuous, and chastised those that were wicked and going astray. He performed many Yajñas, where many cows and sheep were sacrificed according to the rules of the Vedas and abundant Dakshinâs (sacrificial fees) were presented to every one that performed their parts in the sacrifices. In these sacrifices, the hides of the cows that were sacrificed as victims, were heaped to such an enormous extent that they looked liked a second Bindhyâchal mountain. Then the rains fell and the dirty water coming out of that enormous heap of skins flowed down and gave rise to a river which was thence called the Charmanvatî river… Janaka said :– &#8220;The killing of animals in a sacrificial ceremony is not killing; it is known as Ahimsa [Non Violence]; for that himsa [Violence] is not from any selfish attachment; therefore when there is no such sacrifice and the animals are killed out of selfish attachment, then that is real himsâ; … O Dvija! Really speaking, the killing of animals done by the house-holder attached to senses and their objects, and done under their impulses can be taken into account as a real act of killing; but, O Mahâbhâga of those whose hearts are not attached to anything of those self controlled persons, desirous of moksa, if they do an act of Himsa out of a sense of duty, with no desires of fruits and with their hearts free from egoism that can never be reckoned as a real act of killing.&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 3.26.32-34 &#8220;Those who eat meat, they can sacrifice animals in this worship of the Devî; and, for this purpose, goat and wild boars are the best. O sinless one! The goats, etc., offered as a sacrifice before the Devî attain to unending heavens. Therefore persons offering the sacrifices of goats do not incur any sin. O king! The goats, etc., and other beast offered as a sacrifice before the Devas undoubtedly go to the heavenly regions; therefore, in all the S&#8217;âstras, it has been decided that this killing of animals in a sacrifice is considered as non-killing.&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Vishnu Smriti 51.67 That slaughter which is in accordance with the precepts of the Veda, and has been fixed for this world of movable and immovable creatures, should be considered as no slaughter at all; because it is from the Veda that law shines forth.</p>
<p>Kalki Purana 26.12 &#8220;&#8230;The Vedas therefore say that killing in a righteous battle or in a sacrificial performace does not constitute killing.&#8221; Tr. Bhumipati Das, edited by Purnaprajna Das</p>
<p>Following verse from Vasistha explains Manu Smriti 5.48 which is used by Hindu apologists to prohibit meat consumption in Manu,</p>
<p>Vasistha Dharma Shastra 4.5-8 The Manava (Sutra states), &#8216;Only when he worships the manes and the gods, or honours guests, he may certainly do injury to animals.&#8217; On offering a Madhuparka (to a guest), at a sacrifice, and at the rites in honour of the manes, but on these occasions only may an animal be slain; that (rule) Manu proclaimed.&#8221;Meat can never be obtained without injuring living beings, and to injure living beings does not procure heavenly bliss; therefore the (sages declare) the slaughter (of beasts) at a sacrifice not to be slaughter (in the ordinary sense of the word).&#8217; &#8216;Now he may also cook a full-grown ox or a full-grown he-goat for a Brâhmana or Kshatriya guest; in this manner they offer hospitality to such (a man).</p>

<h3><a id="post-6065-Examples"></a>Examples of meat consumption</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Krishna</strong></p>
<p>Krishna recommended slaughtering animals for worshipping Govardhan Mountain and also ate the flesh of animals that was offered by the people,</p>
<p>Vishnu Purana 5.10.36-49 “Let prayer and offerings then be addressed to the mountain Govarddhana, and kill a victim in due form. Let the whole station collect their milk without delay, and feed with it the Brahmans and all who may desire to partake of it. When the oblations have been presented, and the Brahmans have been fed, let the Gopas circumambulate the cows, decorated with garlands of autumnal flowers. If the cowherds will attend to these suggestions, they will secure the favour of the mountain, of the cattle, and also mine.&#8221; When Nanda and the other Gopas heard these words of Krishńa, their faces expanded with delight, and they said that he had spoken well. &#8220;You have judged rightly, child,&#8221; exclaimed they; &#8220;we will do exactly as you have proposed, and offer adoration to the mountain.&#8221; Accordingly the inhabitants of Vraja worshipped the mountain, presenting to it curds and milk and flesh; and they fed hundreds and thousands of Brahmans, and many other guests, who came to the ceremony, even as Krishńa had enjoined: and when they had made their offerings, they circumambulated the cows and the bulls, that bellowed as loud as roaring clouds. Upon the summit of Govarddhana, Krishńa presented himself, saying, &#8220;I am the mountain,&#8221; and partook of much food presented by the Gopas; whilst in his own form as Krishńa he ascended the hill along with the cowherds, and worshipped his other self. Having promised them many blessings, the mountain-person of Krishńa vanished; and the ceremony being completed, the cowherds returned to their station.” Tr. H.H. Wilson</p>
<p>H.H. Wilson also writes about it in his introduction of translation of Vishnu Purana,</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;and says that at Krsna&#8217;s advice Nanda and the other cowherds worshipped the mount Govardhana with the offer of various kinds of foods including meat of a sacrificial animal killed on that occasion and that Krsna took his seat on the mount, identifying himself with it, and ate up much of the food thus offered by the cowherds&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>It is also mentioned in Harivamsha Purana,</p>
<p>Harimvsha Purana 2.17.15-21 &#8220;Let us kill the animals such as buffalos to be eaten. Let this sacrifice be conducted with all gopas…Along with a pond of curd, a vortex of ghee, a river of milk, a variety of meat and a mountain of cooked rice, the entire complex of vraja including the happy gopa-s and beautiful gopi-s proceeded for the hill sacrifice…At the start of the sacrifice, the items were offered to the fire as ordained. The gopa-s performed the sacrifice along with brahmins on an auspicious day. At the end of the sacrifice, by illusion, Krishna became the hill and consumed the best rice, milk, curd and meat which were offered.&#8221; Tr. A. Purushothaman and A. Harindranath</p>
<p>This is also mentioned in Brahma Purana,</p>
<p>Brahma Purana 79.21 &#8220;[Krishna said] Hence, let the mountain Govardhana be honoured and worshipped with all due offerings after killing the sacrificial animal in accordance with injunctions. [25] Vyasa said: O brahmins, on hearing these words of his, Nanda and other residents of the colony became delighted with their faces beaming with pleasure. They said &#8216;Well said, well said, my boy&#8230;Accordingly the residents of colony performed Yajna unto the mountain. They offered oblations unto the mountain by curds, milk puddings, meat etc.&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>Hundreds of animals were slaughtered and wine was drunk by Krishna&#8217;s family and Pandavas,</p>
<p>Mahabharata Virata Parva 4, Section 72, Verses 19-28 &#8220;And Krishna gave unto each of the illustrious sons of Pandu numerous female slaves, and gems and robes. And then the nuptial festival set in between the families of the Matsya king and the Pandavas. And then conchs and cymbals and horns and drums and other musical instruments appointed by the Pandavas, began to play in the palace of Virata. And deer of various kinds and clean animals by hundreds were slain. And wines of various kinds and intoxicating juices of trees were profusely collected.&#8221; Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>

<p>This proves that meat was part of his lavish lifestyle in the palace. Rama also used to relish pork, meat of deer and other animals in the forest after the exile,</p>
<p>Valmiki Ramayana, Ayodhya Kanda 2.52.102 &#8220;Famished, they (Rama and Lakshmana) killed a boar, a rishya (whitefooted male antelope), a spotted deer and a great deer with black stripes. They partook the meat and reached a tree by evening where they rested for the night.&#8221; Tr. <a href="https://www.valmiki.iitk.ac.in/sloka?field_kanda_tid=2&amp;language=dv&amp;field_sarga_value=52" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">IIT Kanpur<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>Valmiki Ramayana Ayodhya Kanda 2.96.1-2 &#8220;Having shown Mandakini River in that manner to Seetha, the daughter of Mithila, Rama set on the hill-side in order to gratify her appetite with a piece of flesh. Rama, whose mind was devoted to righteousness stayed there with Seetha, saying; &#8220;This meat is fresh, this is savoury and roasted in the fire.&#8221; Tr. Shri K.M.K. Murthy</p>
<p>Sita addressed Ravana (who was in the guise of an ascetic) in the following way,</p>
<p>Valmiki Ramayana 3.47.22b-23 &#8220;Be comfortable for a moment, here it is possible for you to make a sojourn, and soon my husband will be coming on taking plentiful forest produce, and on killing stags, mongooses, wild boars he fetches meat, aplenty.&#8221; Tr. Desiraju Hanumanth Rao</p>
<p>This is what Rama said to Lakshamana on hunting a golden deer,</p>
<p>Valmiki Ramayana, Aranya Kanda 3.43.31 &#8220;Kings pursuing games of hunting in great forests, oh, Lakshmana, will be felling deer either for the sake of flesh, or just for the purpose of sporting archery.&#8221; Tr. Desiraju Hanumant Rao</p>
<p>Ramayana of Valmiki, Ayodhya Kanda 2, Sarga 55, verse 33 “Thereafter having travelled only a couple of miles the two brothers Rama and Lakshmana killed many consecrated deer and ate in the river-forest of Yamuna.” Tr. K.M.K. Murthy</p>
<p>Bali addresses Rama,</p>
<p>Ramayana of Valmiki, Kishikindha Kanda 4, Sarga 17, Verse 39 &#8220;Raghava, five kinds of five-nailed animals, viz., a kind of wild rodent, a kind of wild-boar, a kind of lizard, a hare and fifthly the turtle are edible for Brahmans and Kshatriya-s.&#8221; Tr. Desiraju Hanumanta Rao</p>
<p>Rama&#8217;s father Dashratha was an avid hunter,</p>
<p>Valmiki Ramayana, Ayodhya Kanda 2.63.21-25 &#8220;With a wish to do hunting as an exercise in that most comfortable season, I went along Sarayu River, in a chariot, wearing bow and arrows. Without my senses under control and with an intent to kill there a (wild) buffalo or an elephant or any other wild animal coming in the night at that place for the purpose of drinking water, I was ready with my bow at a solitary place. Hearing the sound, I killed turning towards it, a wild animal, which came to the bank of Sarayu River and another violent beast too which came there. Meanwhile, in that darkness and not within the react of the eye, I heard the sound of a pitcher being filled up, the sound of which appeared like that of an elephant. With an intent to hit that elephant, I drew out a shining arrow resembling a serpent, targeted towards the direction sound and discharged it.&#8221; Tr. Shri K.M.K Murthy</p>
<p>Some Hindus says that meat shouldn&#8217;t be consumed in Kali Yuga. But they are unaware of the fact that Kalki avatar who will be born in Kali Yuga will offer meat to Brahmins as per Kalki Purana,</p>
<p>Kalki Purana 30.10-13 &#8220;Lord Kalki sumptuously fed all the brahmanas the four kinds of food that are chewed, licked, sucked, and rank, and this included vegetable preparations, soup, cakes, meat, fruit, roots, and many other items&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Bhumipati Das, edited by Purnaprajna Das</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Shiva</strong></p>
<p>Mahabharata Book 13, Section 161, Verse 7 &#8220;And since he burns and oppresses, is keen and fierce, and endued with great energy, and is engaged in eating flesh and blood and marrow, he is said to be Rudra.&#8221; Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Vayu Purana I.30.202 &#8220;Hail to the one greedy of raw and cooked meat&#8230;[211] Obeisance to the jackal (fond of) embryo meal&#8230;&#8221; Tr. G.V. Tagare</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Kalki</strong></p>
<p>Kalki avatar tells to perform horse sacrifice,</p>
<p>Kalki Purana 3.42 &#8220;(Lord Kalki said:) Many pious human beings become degraded in this age of Kali. But because of My presence, they will all become pious once again. Now I would like that all of you worship Me by the performance of a Rajasuya sacrifice and a horse sacrifice.&#8221; Tr. Bhumipati Das, edited by Purnaprajna Das</p>
<p>Kalki Purana also says that Vishnuyasa father of Kalki avatar will perform horse sacrifice. This proves that Ashvamedha Yajna (horse sacrifice) is permissible in Kali Yuga also. Secondly, Vedas are said to be eternal which permits animal slaughter so there is no prohibition to consume meat in Kali Yuga. Mahabharata also shows that Brahmins used to relish meat,</p>
<p>Mahabharata Book 3, Section 96 &#8220;…The Brahmana, however, did not grant the Asura a son like Indra. And at this, the Asura was inflamed with wrath against the Brahmana. And from that day, O king, the Asura Ilwala became a destroyer of Brahmanas. And endued with power of illusion the angry Asura transformed his brother into a ram. And Vatapi also capable of assuming any form at will, would immediately assume the shape of a ram. And the flesh of that ram, after being properly dressed, was offered to Brahmanas as food. And after they had eaten of it, they were slain. For whomsoever Ilwala summoned with his voice, he would come back to Ilwala even if he had gone to the abode of Yama, in re-embodied form endued with life, and show himself to Ilwala. And so having transformed the Asura Vatapi into a ram and properly cooked his flesh and feeding Brahmanas therewith, he would summon Vatapi…&#8221; Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Ashwamedha Yajna mentioned in Mahabharata,</p>
<p>Mahabharata Book 14, Section 89 “Vaisampayana said, &#8216;Having cooked, according to due rites, the other excellent animals that were sacrificed, the priests then sacrificed, agreeably to the injunctions of the scriptures, that steed (which had wandered over the whole world). After cutting that horse into pieces, conformably to scriptural directions, they caused Draupadi of great intelligence, who was possessed of the three requisites of mantras, things, and devotion, to sit near the divided animal. The Brahmanas then with cool minds, taking up the marrow of that steed, cooked it duly, O chief of Bharata&#8217;s race. King Yudhishthira the just, with all his younger brothers, then smelled, agreeably to the scriptures, the smoke, capable of cleansing one from every sin, of the marrow that was thus cooked. The remaining limbs, O king, of that horse, were poured into the fire by the sixteen sacrificial priests possessed of great wisdom.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p><strong>OTHERS</strong></p>
<p>Rishi Agastya is said to have eaten beasts and birds and even a Asura who was in the form of a ram,</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 5.22-23 Beasts and birds recommended (for consumption) may be slain by Brahmanas for sacrifices, and in order to feed those whom they are bound to maintain; for Agastya did this of old. For in ancient (times) the sacrificial cakes were (made of the flesh) of eatable beasts and birds at the sacrifices offered by Brahmanas and Kshatriyas.</p>
<p>Vasistha Dharma Shastra 14.15. For it is declared in the Veda, &#8216;At a sacrificial session (sattra), which lasted one thousand years, Agastya went out to hunt. He had sacrificial cakes prepared with the meat of beasts and fowls good (to eat).&#8217;</p>
<p>Mahabharata Book 3, Section 199 &#8220;Lomasa said, &#8216;When Ilwala learnt that those kings along with the great Rishi had arrived on the confines of his domain, he went out with his ministers and worshipped them duly. And that prince of Asuras received them hospitably, entertaining them, O son of the Kuru race, with well dressed meat supplied by his brother Vatapi (transformed into a ram). Then all those royal sages, beholding the mighty Asura Vatapi, who had been transformed into a ram thus cooked for them, became sad and cheerless and were nearly deprived of themselves. But that best of Rishis&#8211;Agastya&#8211;addressing those royal sages, said, &#8216;Yield ye not to grief, I will eat up the great Asura.&#8217; And the mighty Rishi then sat himself down on an excellent seat, and the prince of Asuras, Ilwala, began to distribute the food smilingly. And Agastya ate up the whole of the meat supplied by Vatapi (transformed into a ram).” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Following verse shows that animal sacrifice was performed to please departed manes,</p>
<p>Brahma Purana 5.47-50 &#8220;&#8230;On the Astaka day Iksvaku commanded Vikuksi &#8216;O powerful one, kill some rabbits and bring their flesh for performing Sraddha.&#8217;O Brahmins, after planning to perform the Sraddha rite before executing it he ate part of the meat of the rabbit which was meant for the Sraddha&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Board of Scholars, edited by J.L. Shastri</p>
<p>This is also mentioned in Devi Bhagavatam and Srimad Bhagavatam 9.6.6-8 and Devi Bhagavatam,</p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 7.59.1-11. Vyâsa said :&#8211; O King! Once on a time, the time for Astaka S&#8217;râddha (the funeral ceremony in honour of the departed) arrived. Seeing this, the King Iksâku ordered his son Vikuksi:&#8211; &#8220;O Child! Go immediately to the forest and bring carefully pure sanctified meat for the S&#8217;râddha purposes; see, that there be no neglect of duty.&#8221; Thus ordered, Vikuksi instantly went to the forest equipped with arms. He hunted in the forest lots of boars, pigs, deer, and hare. But he was so very tired with his journey in the forest and got so hungry that he forgot everything about the Astaka S&#8217;râddha and ate one hare there in the forest. The remaining excellent meat he brought and handed over to his father. When that meat was brought to be sprinkled for purification, the family priest Vas&#8217;istha, on seeing it, at once came to know that some portion had already been eaten and it was the remaining part. The leavings of food are not fit for the sprinkling purposes; this is the S&#8217;âstric rule…&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 5.20.16-50 &#8220;&#8230;The Râjasik Brâhmanas were versed in the Vedas and acted as priests to the Ksattriyas and ate flesh as sanctioned by recognised rules. They were busy with their six duties&#8230;&#8221; Tr. Swami Vijnananda</p>
<p>Sons of Pandu killed many animals and offered them to Brahmins,</p>
<p>Mahabharata Book 3, Section 80 &#8220;And, O chief of the Bharata race, those mighty warriors endowed with great prowess slew with pure arrows various kinds of sacrificial animals for the Brahmanas. And those tigers among men and repressors of foes, daily slaying those wild animals and sanctifying them properly, offered them unto the Brahmanas.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Mahabharata Book 1, Section 116 says that Rishi Vyasa divided meat ball into 100 pieces and gave it to Gandhari so she can conceive 100 sons.</p>
<p>Munis also used to partake meat,</p>
<p>Mahabharata Book 3, Section 159 &#8220;Having heard from that one of incomparable energy, (Arshtishena), that advice conducive to their welfare, those foremost of the Bharatas, began to behave always accordingly. Those best of men, the Pandavas, dwelt upon the Himavan, partaking of the food eaten by the Munis, and luscious fruit, and the flesh of deer killed with unpoisoned shafts and various kinds of pure honey.” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Mahabharata Book 2, Section 4 &#8220;Vaisampayana said,&#8211;&#8220;Then that chief of men, king Yudhishthira, entered that palatial sabha having first fed ten thousand Brahmanas with preparations of milk and rice mixed with clarified butter and honey with fruits and roots, and with pork and venison. The king gratified those superior Brahmanas, who had come from various countries with food seasoned with seasamum and prepared with vegetables called jibanti, with rice mixed with clarified butter, with different preparations of meat&#8211;with indeed various kinds of other food, as also numberless viands that are fit to be sucked and innumerable kinds of drinks, with new and unused robes and clothes, and with excellent floral wreaths.&#8221; Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Some Hindus might try to twist the Vedic verses by saying they does not mean what they say, they are allegorical. You cannot say verses from Manu Smriti, Upanishad, Brahmanas etc., are allegorical, all those verses including the Vedic verses on meat consumption are literal. There is no prohibition of meat consumption in Hindu scriptures, so Hindus should not just enjoy eating meat secretly at night but they should start eating openly during day also.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Written by Sulaiman Razvi<br />
</span></p>
[This article is incomplete, This article will be scrutinized, inshallah I will do it as soon as I get time]
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">The Holy Kaba was built by Prophet Adam A.S and was rebuilt Ibrahim A.S. It is known as Baith Allah or the House of Allah. The Kaaba is a direction for prayer. However some Islamophobes especially some Hindus allege that Muslims worship the Kaaba or the Black Stone and they accuse Muslims of being idolaters. First of all they have to know what exactly is Idol worship, only then they should accuse Muslims of Idolatry. Idol worship is a veneration or worship of the Idol of any God. Islam is known for its staunch monotheistic stand. Islam prohibits Idol worship, It is mentioned in the Qur&#8217;an,<br />
</span></p>
<p><span id="more-161"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">22:30 &#8221;…so shun the abomination of idols, and shun the word that is false.&#8221;<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">14:35 Remember Abraham said: &#8220;O my Lord! make this city one of peace and security: and <span style="text-decoration:underline;">preserve me and my sons from worshipping idols</span>.<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">5:90 O ye who believe! Intoxicants and gambling, <span style="color:red;">(dedication of) stones</span>, and (divination by) arrows, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">are an abomination― of Satan&#8217;s handiwork</span>: eschew such (abomination), that ye may prosper.<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">It is mentioned in Hadith,<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Sunan Abu Dawood (Kitab Al-Aqdiyah) [24:3592] Narrated Khuraym Ibn Fatik: The Apostle of Allah (peace be upon him) offered the morning prayer. When he finished it, he stood up and said three times: False witness has been made equivalent to attributing a partner to Allah. He then recited: &#8220;<span style="text-decoration:underline;">So avoid the abomination of idols</span> and avoid speaking falsehood as people pure of faith to Allah, not associating anything with Him.<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Muslims do not believe the Kaaba or Black Stone to be God. Kaaba is a direction,<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">&#8221;…when a person making supplication (du&#8217;a) faces the sky–just as those performing the prayer (Salat) face the Ka&#8217;bah, since the sky is the qiblah of those who supplicate, as the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Ka&#8217;bah is the qiblah of those who perform the prayer</span>…&#8221;-(Sahih Muslim bi Sharh al-Nawawi. 18 vols. Cairo 1349/1930. Reprint (18 vols. in 9). Beirut: Dar al-Fikr, 1401/1981, 5.24)<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">&#8216;<span style="text-decoration:underline;">&#8216;Allah&#8217;s direction of prayer is the Ka&#8217;bah</span>. (And if thou shouldst follow their desires) their religion and direction of prayer (after the knowledge which hath come unto thee) that the Religion of Allah is Islam and His direction of prayer is the Ka&#8217;bah&#8221;– Tanwir al Miqbas min Tafsir ibn Abbas 2:120<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">People used to stand on the Kaaba and give Azaan. Kaaba has been rebuilt several times, it was brought down by the Sahabas. Can any Hindu even think of destroying idol of their god? Ibn Az Zubayr brought Kaaba down to rebuild it and later it was again brought down and rebuilt by Ibn Hajjaj,<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">&#8221;he (Ibn Az Zubayr) decided to bring the Ka`bah down. The people hesitated to bring it down, fearing that the first person to climb on the House would be struck down. A man went on top of the House and threw some stones down, and when the people saw that no harm touched him, they started doing the same. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">They brought the House down to ground level</span>…`Abdul-Malik wrote back, `We do not agree with Ibn Az-Zubayr&#8217;s actions. As, for the Ka`bah&#8217;s height, leave it as it is. As for what he added from the Hijr, bring it down, and build the House as it was before and close the door.&#8217; <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Therefore, Al-Hajjaj brought down the House and rebuilt it as it was</span>.&#8221;- Tafsir Ibn Kathir [<a href="http://www.qtafsir.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=303&amp;Itemid=36" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Source<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>]
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Idolaters won&#8217;t stand on their idols nor they will destroy their Idols. How can such claims be made that Muslims worship the Kaaba or Black Stone when Quran and Hadiths clearly prohibit any form of Idol worship? Hazrat Umar R.A said,<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">&#8221;…No doubt, I know that you are a <strong>stone</strong> and can neither benefit anyone nor harm anyone. Had I not seen Allah&#8217;s Apostle kissing you I would not have kissed you.&#8221; Sahih Bukhari, Kitab al Hajj 26, Hadith no 667.<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Muslims do not believe the Kaaba to be God. Muslims do not worship the Kaaba. When some Hindus are told these facts they say,<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left:36pt;"><span style="color:#c00000;font-size:12pt;">&#8221;They too, whom you call Idol worshippers, do not regard the image as God. They profess to worship God behind the Idol/image&#8221;<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">How true it is, let&#8217;s analyse. Hindu scriptures clearly states that &#8216;You should establish an Idol of God and worship it for the Idol is God himself&#8217;. Whatever we or the Islamophobes says carries no weight unless it is backed by some evidence, let&#8217;s have a look at what Hindu scripture have to say about it because if they are accusing us of Idolatry then our way of worship must be similar with idol worshippers.<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Garuda Purana 12.17 Then the son should place upon the <span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;">bed a golden image, and having worshiped it</span>…<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Devi Bhagavatam 3.24.19 O sinless one! <span style="color:red;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Establish my image in this city and worship it</span><br />
</span>three times, morning, mid-day and evening carefully and with devotion<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Devi Bhagavatam 3.13.49 These Saktis, capable of bestowing all the desires, <span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;">will be worshipped in Pratimas(images of clay, etc.)</span> in the whole of India.<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Vishnudharmottara Purana, Kanda 3, Adhyay 93, 2 in the former three ages, Krta, Treta, and Dvapara men were able to see a god directly but in the Kali age ment have lost that faculty; <span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;">therefore they have to worship them (the gods) in an image</span>.<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Devi Bhagavatam 11.23.21-33 … one is to worship one&#8217;s own Deity <span style="color:red;"><strong>in front</strong></span><br />
<span style="color:red;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">of fire or the </span><strong>image of any god</strong></span>…<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">This shows that the Idol must be in front of the worshipper.<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">BhrGhSuPari Grihasutra 2.14.2 <span style="color:red;">Having prepared the image of the god and worshipping it </span>with the unbroken rice and flowers as available&#8230;<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">&#8221;It (clay) should be washed well and pasted with scented poweder and milk. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">The idol should be made</span> with the hands on a raises platform. All the limbs, joints, etc. should be perfectly shaped with the respective weapons of the deity concerned. It should be seated on Padmasana (lotus pose) <span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;">and worshipped respectfully</span>&#8221;.-Shiva Purana 1.1.16.6-7, Tr. J.L. Shastri<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">&#8221;O my child, <span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;">one should worship the beautiful and universally auspicious idol (of Devi) </span>which is the destroyer of great demons placing it on a car (chatior)&#8221;.-Devi Purana 30.6cd-7ab, Tr. R.S. Bhattacharya<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Harivamsa Purana, Vishnu Parva 2.74.52 Those who <span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;">make my idol with stones taken from you and worship [it]</span> daily with devotion shall eventually attain my path.<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">These verses clearly commands Hindus to worship the Idol of their god, but Quran nor any Hadith tells us to worship the Kaaba. Hindu texts and Scholars say that Idol is God himself. Pratima means Idol, image, picture of god but Swami Prabhupada the founder of ISKON translates Pratima as Deity Form or Deity because he considers the Idol to be another form or incarnation of God. This fact is enough to prove that Muslims do not worship the Kaaba as Quran, Hadiths nor Muslims says Kaaba is Allah (S.W.T). Let me quote few verses from Hindu scriptures and passages written by Hindu scholars on this issue,<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">&#8221;…think of the name as Brahman, and meditate upon it, <span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;">just as people worship the idol, thinking it to be Vishnu Himself</span>.- Chandogya Upanishad Commentary by Shankarcharya on 12.1.4 ,The Upanishads and Sri Sankara&#8217;s Commentary, Volumes 4-5, p.200.<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">It is mentioned in Srimad Bhagvatam (Bhagavad Purana),<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">dravyaiḥ prasiddhair mad-yāgaḥ <span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;">pratimā</span>diṣv amāyinaḥ bhaktasya ca yathā-labdhair hṛdi bhāvena caiva hi<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Bhagavat Purana (Srimad Bhagvatam) 11.27.15 <span style="color:red;">One should worship Me in My Deity forms [Pratima/Idol]</span> by offering the most excellent paraphernalia. But a devotee completely freed from material desire may worship Me with whatever he is able to obtain…</span><span style="font-size:14pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">śailī dāru-mayī lauhī lepyā lekhyā ca saikatī mano-mayī maṇi-mayī <span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;">pratimā</span>ṣṭa-vidhā smṛtā<br />
</span></p>
<p><a href="http://vedabase.com/en/sb/11/27/12" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-size:12pt;">Bhagavat Purana</span><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a><span style="font-size:12pt;"> (Srimad Bhagavatam) 11.27.12 <span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;">The Deity form[Idol] of the Lord is said to appear in eight varieties</span> — stone, wood, metal, earth, paint, sand, the mind or jewels.<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;"><strong>Swami Prabhupada states</strong>: Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī explains that certain Deity forms, such as those made of sand, are manifested for a brief time to fulfill a personal desire of the worshiper. Those, however, <span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;">who desire to attain pure love of God should worship the permanent form of the Deity (made, for instance, of marble, gold or brass)</span>, and they should maintain continual worship. In Kṛṣṇa consciousness there is no scope for neglecting the worship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Bhagwat Purana (Srimad Bhagavatam) 11.27.48 <span style="color:red;">Whenever one develops faith in Me in <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>My form [Idol] as the Deity</strong></span> or in other bona fide manifestations one should <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>worship Me in that form</strong></span></span>. I certainly exist both within all created beings and also separately in My original form, since I am the Supreme Soul of all.<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;"><strong>Swami Prabhupada states</strong>: The Supreme Personality of Godhead is worshiped according to the faith of a particular worshiper. The Deity form, arcā, is specifically mentioned here because Deity worship is essential for spiritual progress. <span style="color:red;">Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura mentions that inexperienced persons may think that the Deity [Idol] is meant for the sense gratification of the worshiper, since superficially the Deity [Idol] is made of external substances such as marble or brass</span>. But through the process of installing the Deity by <span style="color:red;"><strong>chanting of authorized mantras, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">one invites the Supreme Personality of Godhead to enter the Deity form [Idol]</span>.</strong></span> By regulated, faithful worship one gradually <span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;"><strong>understands that the Deity [Idol] is completely nondifferent from the Supreme Lord Himself</strong></span>…<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">&#8221;But, greater is the difficulty of those whose minds cling to the Unmanifested; for the goal of the Unmanifested is hard for the embodied being to reach.&#8221; Gita 12:5<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Swami Prabhupada writes on this verse &#8221;Therefore, the bhakti-yogi accepts the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Deity of Krishna as worshipable</span> because there is some bodily conception fixed in the mind, which can thus be applied. <span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;">Of course, worship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His form within the temple is not idol worship</span>. There is evidence in the Vedic literature that worship may be saguna and nirguna—of the Supreme possessing or not possessing attributes. Worship of the Deity in the temple is saguna worship, <span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;">for the Lord is represented by material qualities</span>. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">But the form of the Lord, though represented by material qualities such as <span style="color:red;">stone, wood or oil paint, is not actually material. That is the absolute nature of the Supreme Lord</span></span>…God has an authorized <span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;">representation in the Deity form [Idol]</span>, which is called arca-vigraha. This arca-vigraha is an incarnation of the Supreme Lord&#8221;.<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Swami Prabhupada on Bhagwad Purana (Srimad Bhagavatam) 4.30.27:<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;">The form of the Lord as worshiped in the temples is called arca-vigraha or arcavatara, the worshipable form [Idol Worship],</span><br />
<span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;">the Deity incarnation</span>. This facility is offered to neophyte devotees so that they can see the real form of the Lord face to face and offer their respectful obeisances and sacrifices in the form of arca. Through such facilities the neophytes gradually invoke their original Krsna consciousness. <span style="color:red;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Deity worship in the form of temple worship is the most valuable benediction </span><strong>given by the Lord to beginners</strong></span>. All neophytes must therefore engage in the worship of the Lord by keeping the arca-vigraha (arcavatara)[Idol] at home or in the temple.<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Another Hindu scholar named Swami Sivananda writes,<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">&#8221;<span style="color:red;">Though the image is worshipped</span>, <span style="color:red;">the devotee feels the presence of the Lord <span style="text-decoration:underline;">in it</span></span> and pours out his devotion unto it.…<span style="color:red;">When you worship an image</span>, you do not say: &#8220;This image has come from Jaipur. It was brought by Prabhu Singh. Its weight is 50 lbs. It is made of white marble. It has cost me Rs. 500/-.&#8221; <span style="color:red;"><strong>You superimpose all the attributes of the Lord on the image and pray</strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">: &#8220;</span><strong>O</strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Antaryamin (Inner Ruler)! </span><strong>You are</strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;"> all-pervading. You are omnipotent, omniscient, all-merciful. You are the source for everything. You are self-existent. You are Sat-Chit-Ananda. </span><strong>You</strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;"> are eternal, unchanging. You are the Life of my life, Soul of my soul! Give me light and knowledge! Let me dwell in Thee for ever.&#8221;</span></span> When your devotion and meditation become intense and deep, you do not see the stone image. You behold the Lord only who is Chaitanya. <span style="color:red;">Image-worship is very necessary for beginners</span>…For a beginner, Pratima is an absolute necessity. <span style="color:red;"><strong>By worshipping an idol</strong>, Isvara is pleased</span>…<span style="color:red;">Even so, the Lord is highly pleased when a small portion of His Virat (cosmic) body is worshipped. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">An idol is a part of the body of the Lord</span></span>. The whole world is His body, Virat form. The devotion goes to the Lord<span style="color:red;">. The worshipper superimposes on the image the Lord and all His attributes</span>. He does Shodasopachara for the idol, the sixteen kinds of paying respects or service to the Lord…<span style="color:red;"><strong>The idol speaks. It will answer your questions and solve your problems</strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">. The God in you has the power to awaken the latent </span><strong>Divinity in the idol</strong></span>…<span style="color:red;"><strong>The awakened Divinity in the idol</strong></span><br />
<span style="color:red;">acts as a guardian angel blessing all, conferring the highest good on those who bow to it…</span><br />
<span style="color:red;">The image in the temple at Tirupati assumed human form and gave witness in the court to help His devotees</span>.- All About Hinduism, By Sri Swami Sivananda, p.70-4<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">&#8221;To the worshipper <span style="text-decoration:underline;">who believes the symbol, any kind of image is the body of the Lord under the form of stone, clay, brass, picture, Saligrama, etc. Such worship can never be idolatry</span>. <span style="color:red;">All matter is a manifestation of God. God is present in everything which exists</span>. Everything is an object of worship, for all is a manifestation of God who is therein worshipped.&#8221; – All About Hinduism, By Swami Sivananda, p.72<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Muslims do not believe the Kaaba to be Allah nor do we adore the Kaaba as the Hindus does to their Idols thinking it to be god himself,<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;"> Bhagavat Purana (Srimad Bhagvatam) 11:30:7 There we should bathe for purification, fast, and fix our minds in meditation. <span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;">We should then worship the demigods by bathing their images</span>, anointing them with sandalwood pulp, and presenting them various offerings<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">So it is evident from all these verses that the Idolaters indeed think their Idols to be God. Another bogus claim made by some Hindus is that Kaaba was actually a Hindu temple and the Black Stone is actually Shiva Lingam. There is nothing to refute as there is no evidence which proves their point. There is absolutely no evidence at all. This hoax was started by a self-proclaimed historian (popularly known as Mythistorian by experts) who believed that all religious monuments and religions are corrupted form of Hinduism and that Christianity is altered version of Kishna Neti and Islam is the altered version of the Sanskrit word Ishalayam. He gave fake reference from an imaginary book created by him. Surprisingly Hindus believes this book exis and even quote, well, Islam is such a beautiful religion that anyone would like to link their religion with it. The Mythistorian&#8217;s work is full of mistakes and does not contain a single fact. He was ignorant of history. He made such poor remarks on other religions, for example he claimed that the Muslim&#8217;s Namaz is originally a Sanskrit word called Namah. I wonder whether he did some research or just wrote his frustrations. The Arabic word for prayer is Salah. Namaz is an Urdu word originated from Farsi, the word Namaz is used by Muslims of Indian subcontinent for prayer. He and his claims have been refuted by Imran Khan in his Blog <a href="http://kaabaisnotahindutemple.blogspot.in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Kaba Is Not a Hindu Temple<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. Readers can go through the blog and see the idiotic claims made by Hindu nationalist. Shri Shri Ravi Shankar had also made such claims but later in a debate with Dr. Zakir Naik he honestly acknowledged that his claims are incorrect. There is no evidence at all that could suggest the Kaaba was a Hindu temple. There is also no preserved history which could suggest that Hindus lived in Makka or went there. Even a Muslim can make such claims. For example,<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">&#8221;Hindu God Ram was a normal Muslim, his name is altered version of the Arabic word Akram. His brother Luxman was also a Muslim his original name was Luqman, and his close disciple was Humam Bajar Ali which was changed to Hanuman Bajrang Bali. The Hindu God Krishna was also a Muslim his real name was Karim Shah. Shiva was also a Muslim his original name was Shuaa&#8221;. </span></p>
<p>So does it make them Muslims?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Another bogus claim made by Hindus is that the Black Stone is Shiva Lingam. How can this be so when both these have different meanings and their own origin. The meaning and origin of Shiva Lingam is discussed briefly in the article <a href="/index.php/2014/05/15/analysis-of-lingam/" data-wpel-link="internal">An Analysis of Lingam</a>. As far as Black Stone is concerned. The Arabic word is Hajre Aswad. Hajr means stone, Aswad means black. While Lingam means make erected organ and Yoni denotes female genital organ. According to the tradition, the Hajre Aswad (Black Stone) was white and was sent from heaven,<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Sunan Al Tirmizi Sayyidina Book of Hajj 9, Hadith 878 &#8221;Ibn Abbas narrated that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (SAW) said, &#8220;The <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Black Stone was sent down from Paradise</span> and it was more <span style="text-decoration:underline;">white than milk</span>, but the sins of the children of Adam turned it black.&#8221;<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Hindus try to link Yoni (Literally female genital which is the base of Shivling) with the silver frame of Hajre Aswad. They are not aware of the fact that the silver frame was not present during the time of Prophet Muhammad (P.B.U.H). When the Black Stone was broken into pieces during a war, Its fragments were cemented into a silver frame by Abd Allah Ibn Zubayr. The Black Stone is from Heaven (Tirmizi 878) whereas Yoni (Female genital or Shivling&#8217;s base) worship was initiated after the curse. There are two stories concerning its origin. First one is when the Sage Bhrigu was dishonoured by Shiva as Shiva was busy with his wife Parvati so Bhrigu cursed him to be worshipped in Linga and Yoni form which he desired the most, another story is that Shiva was cursed by the sages to be worshipped in Penis form for seducing their wives, Shiva&#8217;s male organ fell down to earth and burned everything, Shiva told Brahma and Vishnu that it will become calm only when Parvati takes hold of it in Yoni (female genital) form. For more information, read the article <a href="/index.php/2014/05/15/analysis-of-lingam/" data-wpel-link="internal">Analysis of Lingam</a>. So how can some people claim Black Stone is Hindu Idol when both these have their own origin and definition? Some Hindu brothers are easily deceived by Islamophobes. One should not blindly follow what the person is saying. It is incorrect to liken Shivling with Black Stone because ShivLingam is risen out from the Vulva shaped base known as Yoni whereas Black Stone is not and Shiva Lingam is not cemented into the walls of temple like the Black Stone. There is no evidence of Lingam worship in Arabia nor there is a mention of such Idol. I request the readers to read the Blog <a href="http://kaabaisnotahindutemple.blogspot.in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Kaba is Not a Hindu Temple<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> as I don&#8217;t want to add any repetitive refutations.<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:13pt;text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Conclusion</strong></span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><strong>:-</strong> It is inappropriate to say that Muslims worship the Kaba or Black stone since Idol worship means worshipping the Idol thinking it to be God himself. Kaba is only a direction for worship. Quran nor the Hadith tell us to worship the Kaaba, Islam strictly prohibits idol worship.<br />

<p>Read the main article <a href="/index.php/2015/06/23/do-muslims-worship-the-kaaba-or-black-stone/" data-wpel-link="internal">Do Muslims Worship the Kaaba or the Black Stone?</a></p>
<p>Throughout the article, Hindu polemic has made many lame points in his frustration to label Muslims as idolators. He couldn&#8217;t prove anything with his childish arguments. He came up with some childish arguments like Why Muslims bow towards the Kaaba, why Muslims circumambulate it. He is unaware that Kaaba is not an idol, it is just a place of worship as Allah has clearly stated in Quran 3:96 that the first house of worship established for mankind was the Kaaba. Saying Muslims worship the Kaaba is like saying Christians worships Church or Hindus worships temples. Kaaba is just a direction for Muslims to pray, Muslims hundreds and thousands of miles away from Kaaba prays to its direction because the Kaaba is a Qibla (direction) for worship, the Qibla (direction) was changed during holy prophet from Bait ul Muqaddas in Palestine to Kaaba of Makkah as mentioned in Quran 2:144. Idols are usually in shape of respective gods whom their worshippers worship, and believing it to be their god is very necessary, this is the reason why many Hindus clothes idols of their gods so that their gods may not catch cold, they install air conditioners near idols so that their gods don&#8217;t feel heat during summer season, <a href="https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/heater-for-idol-in-ayodhya/cid/1330220" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">heater was installed for Rama in Ayodhya<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, <a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/videos/india-news/an-air-conditioner-for-lord-ganesha-please/video-4Duoq9LWt81v3TOjwVHSEJ.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Air conditioner was installed for Gchanesha’s idol<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, so this proves that Hindus indeed believe their idols to be god whereas Muslims do not believe the Kaaba to be Allah almighty. Agniveer/Satyagni has repeated many arguments in this same article so you may feel bored reading the same argument again and again.</p>
<p><span id="more-155"></span></p>
<p><strong>AGNIVEER WROTE:</strong></p>
<p>When Muslims are asked that why they bow towards Kaaba, kiss it, and circumambulate it and thus do same with Kaaba stone what any idolater does to his idol, they give few excuses to show that they don’t worship the Kaaba stone. For example</p>
<p><em>1. We don’t worship Kaaba. We worship only Allah.</em></p>
<p><em>2. Kaaba is only direction. It is not idol. We bow towards this direction for unity. We bow towards Kaaba we don’t bow to Kaaba!</em></p>
<p><em>3. No Muslim thinks of Kaaba stone as God/creator. But Hindus think of their idols as Gods and creator.</em></p>
<p><em>4. At the time of Muhammad, people used to stand on Kaaba and give Adhan. Which idol worshipper can do this to his idol?</em></p>
<p><em>5. O Hindus! Why to bow down to idols when it can neither benefit you nor harm you?</em></p>
<p>We have debunked these arguments way back thoroughly. We proved that though Muslims allege Hindus to be idolaters but they themselves are idol worshippers as well as human worshippers.</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>The so called ‘Detailed Analysis’ is refuted here <a href="https://thegreaterindia.wordpress.com/2015/06/23/rebuttal-to-agniveer-kaaba-idol-worship-2/" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">https://thegreaterindia.wordpress.com/2015/06/23/rebuttal-to-agniveer-kaaba-idol-worship-2/<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>AGNIVEER WROTE:</strong></p>
<p><strong>What is worship?</strong></p>
<p>Is there any universal definition of worship? No. There cant be. Simply because worship is the matter b/w worshipper and worshipped alone. It is none of any other’s business to force his definition of worship down the throat of others. I love God. When I worship, it is b/w me and my God. It is up to me what I say to God or with which feelings, words, and rituals I remember Him. Whether I praise Him or get angry at Him, its my choice. When we have all rights to love, get angry, get disagree with our parents, who can deny the same rights to me with my God who is my ultimate parent? Who the hell any human/agent/prophet is to teach me how should I remember my mother? Why should I borrow his words, feelings, rituals to remember my mother? Don’t I possess my own feelings and words? Only a moron will beg for the words and feelings from outside to remember his dearest one!</p>
<p>Muslims err at this point itself. They consider worship as yet another military practice that cant be carried out without proper (again definition of proper is as per their standards, not universal) dress, parade, words, and actions etc. Now first they militarize the worship and then start labeling others as not being appropriate with their “worship” and then force them towards their own style of worshipping. They think that God can understand only few words uttered in Arabic in the name of worship that too as taught by Muhammad. If someone uses different words/language, Allah will not count that worship and he will be shown the path of eternal hell at judgment night. Does all this look divine at all?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>Is this called a definition of worship? “<em>I love God. When I worship, it is b/w me and my God&#8230;. Whether I praise Him or get angry at Him, it’s my choice</em>’’ I thought he was going to tell us the definition of worship as per Vedas (as the pretend to believe only in Vedas) but rather he went on expressing his choices. He then said ‘’ <em>Who the hell any human/agent/prophet is to teach me how should I remember my mother</em>’’ Does Agniveer means to say that the Vedic prayer were taught to him divinely by Ishwar himself? He must have learned it from his teacher who got information from his scriptures which were revealed to Rishis (as they say), Similarly we Muslims were unaware of the true prayer and it was taught by Prophet because the people were unaware how to worship Allah SWT correctly. ‘’ <em>They consider worship as yet another military practice that cant be carried out without proper (again definition of proper is as per their standards, not universal) dress, parade, words, and actions etc</em>’’</p>
<p>Worship (Ibadat) means asking god for forgiveness, humility, remembrance of God, praising God, glorifying God, thanking God&#8230; The prostration, bowing down, Standing etc all has wisdom behind them</p>
<p>1.Standing (Qiyam)</p>
<p>First, we stand, raise our hands and say Allahu akbar (Allah is the greatest). Thus, man throws everything except Allah behind his back and becomes subject to His order and will. Servitude and slavery are registered like that. Thus, the worshipping of all of the beings is represented.</p>
<p>2. Bowing Down (Ruku)</p>
<p>After praising Allah as He deserves, man feels so weak in the presence of that loftiness that he bows down to show it and lowers his head as a sign of respect and says ‘Subhana Rabbiyal-Azim (Glorious is my Lord, the Great). The believer represents the worshipping of all beings that bow down by doing so.</p>
<p>3. Supplication (Dua)</p>
<p>Then, he straightens up, and thanks and praises Allah because He guided him to the right path. For a moment, he contemplates, while standing, the loftiness and grandeur of Allah and the simplicity and meanness of his act, then, he becomes terrified and appalled.</p>
<p>4. Prostration (Sajdah)</p>
<p>He prostrates and puts his forehead down feeling the modesty and weakness fully and says,</p>
<p>‘Subhana Rabbiyal-Ala (Glorious is my Lord, the Highest).</p>
<p>5. Sitting And Salutation</p>
<p>After repeating those acts in a series, he finds himself directly in the presence of Allah without any intermediaries and asks help from Him.</p>
<p>When two beings meet, a salutation takes place between them. In one part of the prayer (sitting), the person who prays repeats the same expressions of salutation that took place between Hazrat Muhammad (pbuh) and Allah during Miraj (ascension): (<a href="http://www.questionsonislam.com/index.php?s=show_qna&amp;id=2977" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Source<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>)</p>

<p>If you embrace the religion then can’t you memorize few verses of the holy Qur’an, Is it so hard for Agniveer to memorize few verses? This maybe the reason why there are no memorizer of Vedas but Memorizers of Qur’an can be found in thousands.</p>

<p>If a non-Arab convert is not able to recite the Qur&#8217;an and other parts of the salat in Arabic immediately after becoming Muslim, then there are differences of opinions in what he should do. According to the opinions of Imam Abu Yusuf (<a href="http://www.welcome-back.org/question/salat_english.shtml#fn_6" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><em>ra</em><span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>) and Imam Muhammad (ra) &#8211; two great disciples of Imam Abu Hanifa (ra) &#8211; such a person can translate them in his language and read them in salat. But he must immediately start learning to be able to make the salat in Arabic. Imam Abu Hanifa (ra) at first had the opinion that even if one is able to recite in Arabic, it is still acceptable for him to make salat in a non-Arabic language. But he later withdrew this opinion and accepted the opinions of his two great disciples &#8211; Imam Abu Yusuf (ra) and Imam Muhammad (ra). According to Imam Shaffi (ra), under no circumstances can salat be made in a language other than Arabic. If a person is unable to recite the Arabic words, then at least he should say a few brief words in the salat, such as ‘’Subhanallah’’ or ‘’Alhamdulillah’’, etc., but should soon start learning to make salat in Arabic. (For further research in this matter, see the famous explanatory volume of the &#8220;Hidaya&#8221; book called &#8220;Fathul Qadi&#8221;, vol. I, pp. 199-201; &#8220;Al Mabsut&#8221; by Imam Sarakhsi, vol. I, p. 37; and &#8220;Kashful Asrar&#8221; by Bazdabi, p. 25).

<p>Does Agniveer mean we can read Vedas in other language, then why do those guys keep saying Fake translation even to their Maharishi’s translation? Why did Ishwar taught such a complex language to Rishis which cannot be translated literally into other languages?</p>

<p>‘’ <em>Now first they militarize the worship and then start labeling others as not being appropriate with their “worship” and then force them towards their own style of worshipping</em>’’ If the Islamic way of worship is a military practice then what is the Vedic worship?</p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.176.4 Slay everyone who pours no gift, who, hard to reach, delights thee not. Bestow on us what wealth he hath: this even the worshipper awaits.</p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.113. 11 God, Sovran of the Wood, present this our oblation to the Gods, And let the giver be renowned.</p>
<p>Is Ishwar celebrating his birthday on daily basis that he needs gifts?</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 4:145 … and, untired, daily offer oblations in the fire.</p>
[Devi Chand] Yajur Veda  1.22 I fully harness the yajna for the attainment of happiness and material prosperity. This oblation is put into the fire, which expands, reaches in the middle region of the sun and moon and produces food-stuff.</p>

<p><strong>What is an idol?</strong></p>
<p>Is there any standard definition of idol? From rational perspective, yes. Idol is a material object that is used to perform rituals in prayers by anyone. It can be anything that is tangible. For example, a statue, a picture, a stone, books, etc. To some extent, according to some theologians, even intangible things like figures of speech can be idols as well, but we restrict ourselves to tangible things. So idol is anything concrete we can touch and see. Different idols have different reasons behind them, but they do not matter at this moment. Examples of idols are the Murtis and pictures of Hindu deities, the statue of Buddha, statue of Jesus, and Kaaba in mecca. All these examples are idols because they all have one thing in common, which is that they can be seen, touched and are used during performing rituals in prayers.</p>
<p>But with this our Muslim friends don’t agree. To them, every stone, except Kaaba, in the world, used to perform rituals like bowing etc is an idol. They will call stones of Hindu temples, Christian Churches, Buddhist temples etc as idols but refuse to accept that Kaaba is also an idol. We want to ask them what their definition of idol is and why that should be accepted universally? What is wrong in our definition other than that it does not match with that of Quran?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>My definition of Idol is very similar to that of others. It is not just illogical but pathetic to say that Muslims worship Kaaba, it’s like saying Hindus worship temple and Christians worship Church, Allah in Quran 3:96 clearly says that the first house of worship established for mankind was Kaaba, thus it is just a house of prayer not an idol or representation of Allah.</p>
<p>The reason why we don’t believe the Holy Kaaba to be an Idol is because we don’t believe the Kaaba to be God almighty. Believing that some Idol/Stone has the non bestowed power to benefit us is Idol worship because we believe Idols and stones which are worshiped by Idolators cannot help us[2], or asking that Idol hoping it help you by itself besides Allah is Idol worship[3] , bowing FOR the idol with the intention of worshiping it is Idol worship[4], glorifying the idol is idol worship, believing that it has divinity is Idol Worship or believing Allah has bestowed Divinity in it is Idol worship because Allah does not bestow divinity to any of his creation[5], these are my definitions for Idol and Idol worship, many Muslims may accept this definition and this is also similar to the definition given by Hindu scholars</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Though the image is worshipped, the devotee feels the presence of the Lord in it and pours out his devotion unto it.…When you worship an image, you do not say: “This image has come from Jaipur. It was brought by Prabhu Singh. Its weight is 50 lbs. It is made of white marble. It has cost me Rs. 500/-.” <strong>You superimpose all the attributes of the Lord on the image and pray</strong>: “<strong>O</strong>Antaryamin (Inner Ruler)! <strong>You are</strong> all-pervading. You are omnipotent, omniscient, all-merciful. You are the source for everything. You are self-existent. You are Sat-Chit-Ananda. <strong>You</strong> are eternal, unchanging. You are the Life of my life, Soul of my soul! Give me light and knowledge! Let me dwell in Thee for ever.” When your devotion and meditation become intense and deep, you do not see the stone image. You behold the Lord only who is Chaitanya. Image-worship is very necessary for beginners…For a beginner, Pratima is an absolute necessity. <strong>By worshipping an idol</strong>, Isvara is pleased…Even so, the Lord is highly pleased when a small portion of His Virat (cosmic) body is worshipped. An idol is a part of the body of the Lord. The whole world is His body, Virat form. The devotion goes to the Lord. The worshipper superimposes on the image the Lord and all His attributes. He does Shodasopachara for the idol, the sixteen kinds of paying respects or service to the Lord…<strong>The idol speaks. It will answer your questions and solve your problems</strong>. The God in you has the power to awaken the latent <strong>Divinity in the idol</strong>&#8230;<strong>The awakened Divinity in the idol</strong> acts as a guardian angel blessing all, conferring the highest good on those who bow to it… The image in the temple at Tirupati assumed human form and gave witness in the court to help His devotees. <strong><em>All About Hinduism</em> pg 70-74, By Sri Swami Sivananda</strong> [6]
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the definition of Idol Worship by a Hindu scholar named Swami Sivananda, We can see many points clearly contradicts the Kaaba Idol topic, for instance Allah does not give divinity to any of his creation, and Swami says ‘’The awakened DIVINITY IN THE IDOL’’, We say we don’t worship the Holy Kaaba but Swami writes ‘’BY WORSHIPING AN IDOL, ISHVAR IS PLEASED’’, We don’t ask the Kaaba hoping that IT (THE KAABA) will help us but Swami writes ‘’THE IDOL SPEAKS. IT WILL ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS AND SOLVE YOUR PROBLEMS’’, There are many more points which can be extracted from Swami Sivananda’s book which contradicts the Islamic way of worship.</p>

<p><strong>What is idol worship?</strong></p>
<p>Is there any standard definition of idol worship? No, but in broad terms, performing rituals keeping any idol (as described above) as focus in the process of worshipping (any type of worshipping) God may be called as idol worship. Swami Dayanand said that “treating inanimate entities as animates while worshipping is idol worship”. In this way, acts like bowing, kissing, circumambulating, singing songs, prayers in front of any idol (as described above) while worshipping should be considered as idol worship. Or in other words, the acts of treating inanimate entities as animate, without which worship cannot be performed, come under idol worship. This definition of idolatry looks complete and logical.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>I have already given the meaning of Idol and Idol Worship above which does not match with the Islamic way of worship, Idol worship in general term which almost all people agrees with is Worshiping any Idol as God/Worshiping the Idol. Agniveer gives a definition of Idol worship as ‘’<em>performing rituals keeping any idol (as described above) </em><strong><em>as focus in the process of worshipping</em></strong><em> (any type of worshipping) God may be called as idol worship</em>’’ He himself proves Muslims don’t worship the Kaaba, Muslims don’t focus on the Kaaba while offering Salat, But Hindus place the Idol in front of them to focus on it. Agniveer goes on saying ‘<em>’ In this way, acts like bowing, kissing, circumambulating, singing songs, prayers in front of any idol (as described above) while worshipping should be considered as idol worship</em>’’ Why does bowing, circumambulating, praying to in front of the Idol ‘’WHILE WORSHIPING IT’’ should be considered Idol worship? Does that mean we can circumambulate, bow or ‘’Pray To’’ someone else other than God while ‘’NOT’’ worshiping God? Is he saying it because his Vedas commands him to bow before Rishis, so that would become Idol worship, I can just label it as hypocrisy. You cannot use views of so called Vedic scholars to explain Islamic scriptures like Agniveer is saying ‘<em>’ In this way, acts like bowing, kissing, circumambulating, singing songs, prayers in front of any idol (as described above) </em><strong><em>while worshipping</em></strong><em> should be considered as idol worship</em>.’’ His Dayanand shared some similar views on Idolatry, I will explain why Dayanand gave such definition of Idolatry in this article. When I searched the definition of Idol worship online I got the following definitions</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/idol+worship" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Idol Worship<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> = the worship of idols; the worship of images that are not God</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These are the definitions I got online which I agree to, As a matter of fact my definition for idol worship is also same as above and also to the Puranas</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 3.13.49 These S’aktis, capable of bestowing all the desires, will be worshipped <strong>IN</strong> Pratimâs(images of clay, etc.) in the whole of India.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>‘’will be worshipped in Pratimas’’ means Worshiping the Idols as Gods.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But Agniveer gives some other meaning for it, let’s leave it for now because Agniveer makes his own verses and posts his personal views which sometime contradicts the views of his Maharishi Dayanand so why should we take his definition of Idol worship seriously.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>But the problem with Islam is that like “worship” and “idol”, it has its own definition of “idol worship” that is believed to be ultimate and to be forced down the throats of Non Muslims. First it says any stone other than Kaaba which is used by any Non Muslim in prayers is idol, and then it declares that any ritual performed at this idol (idol as per Islam) is idol worship. Now I have problem with this definition by Muslims.</p>
<p>Islamists defined idol worship the way they wanted and killed idolaters. Now its my turn to define idol worship and kill ignorance of Jihadis. Is there anyone who thinks that defining idol worship is the exclusive right of Jihadi butchers alone? Now I make a new definition of idol worship. In the whole world there is only one idol, Kaaba! And idol worship means bowing towards the direction of Kaaba, kissing it and circumambulating it (I have simply reversed the trend. I include/exclude everything under “idol” and “idol worship” what Jihadis excluded/included in their model of idolatry).  I now declare that Muslims are idol worshippers because</p>
<p><strong>1. Kaaba is an idol</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>These arguments of Agniveer sounds like a frustrated child arguing with elders with his stupid arguments, Why can’t you bring definition of Idolatry from scholars and your books which you call corrupted? Even in the article of Agniveer <a href="https://thegreaterindia.wordpress.com/2015/06/23/rebuttal-to-agniveer-kaaba-idol-worship-2/" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Kaaba Idol Worship<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> we have seen he presented his personal views and not a single verse from Puranas, Manu Smriti, Upanishads or the Vedas to support his arguments. Above I have provided definition of Idol worship from their own Hindu Scholar and I shall define it in much clear lines.</p>
<p>Kaaba is not and Idol, No Muslim Scholar says Kaaba is an Idol or Kaaba is God, they say</p>
<p>Allah&#8217;s direction of prayer is the Ka&#8217;bah. (And if thou shouldst follow their desires) their religion and direction of prayer (after the knowledge which hath come unto thee) that the Religion of Allah is Islam and His direction of prayer is the Ka&#8217;bah &#8211; Tafsir ibn Abbas 2:120</p>
<p>Allah says in the Qur’an 2:144 We see the turning of thy face (for guidance) to the heavens: now shall We turn thee to a Qiblah that shall please thee. Turn then thy face in the direction of the Sacred Mosque: wherever ye are, turn your faces in that direction.</p>
<p>The Holy Kaaba is just a Qiblah (Direction) whereas the Hindu scholars says their Idols are Gods or Incarnation of God.</p>

<p>I know many will label me as fanatic because I first assumed Kaaba to be idol and acts like bowing, kissing and circumambulating as worship and then I PROVED that Muslims are idolaters. But what can I do when this is what Muslims do to others? Did not they assume everything except Kaaba as idol and everything except bowing, kissing and circumambulating to Kaaba as idol worship and then allege every Non Muslim as idolater? Can someone imagine what kind of fanaticism Jihadis have been showing since the inception of Islam? Now to show our Muslim friends what it feels when someone argues with them the same way they argue others, here we are with the comments on the arguments given by Muslims when they are called as idol/Kaaba worshippers.</p>
<p>1. We don’t worship Kaaba. We worship only Allah.</p>
<p><strong>Comment-</strong> No by definition, you worship Kaaba, we just PROVED above!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>By what definition do you think we worship the Kaaba? Where is the proof, I don’t see it anywhere, First the author was supposed to study the definition of Idol Worship and then he should have written this article. We don’t worship the Kaaba we Worship Allah alone, It is non sense to say that a idolator does not believe his Idol to be God because Idol worship means believing the idol to be god and we don’t believe the Kaaba to be God thus it proves we don’t worship the Kaaba. Islam strictly prohibits worshiping Idols or anything besides Allah</p>
<p><em>29:17 &#8220;For ye do worship idols besides Allah, and ye invent Falsehood. the things that ye worship besides Allah have no power to give you sustenance: then seek ye sustenance from Allah, serve him, and be grateful to him: to Him will be your return.</em></p>
<p>14:30 And They set up (idols) As equal to Allah, to mislead (men) from the Path! say: &#8220;Enjoy (your brief power)! but Verily ye are Making straightway for Hell!&#8221;</p>
<p>Sahih al Bukhari Volume 1, Book 1, Number 6: Then I asked you what he ordered you to do. You replied that he ordered you to worship Allah and Allah alone and not to worship any thing along with Him and forbade you to worship idols and ordered you to pray, to speak the truth and to be chaste</p>

<p><em>2. Kaaba is only a Kiblah (direction). It is not idol. We bow towards this direction for unity. We bow towards Kaaba we don’t bow to Kaaba!</em></p>
<p><strong>Comment-</strong> Oh! I wonder how do our Jihadi friends kiss the “direction” and then circumambulate it Question is why you bow towards Kaaba? What is the logic other than Allah has commanded this? If commandment of Allah is enough then why this drama of giving arguments to prove that you are not idolater? Simply say we are not idolater because Allah says so! And Non Muslims are idolaters because Allah says so. Game is over<strong>!</strong> Why need arguments then? And have you ever imagined what will happen if Non Muslims start saying that their idol worship is commanded by their God and thus they do it. What answer do you have for it? The moment you ask for logic, they will ask logic behind direction of worship!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>We don’t kiss the Kaaba, we kiss the Black Stone because Prophet Muhammad did so,</p>
<p>Sahih al Bukhari Volume 2, Book 26, Number 667: Narrated &#8216;Abis bin Rabia:</p>
<p>&#8216;Umar came near the Black Stone and kissed it and said &#8220;No doubt, I know that you are a stone and can neither benefit anyone nor harm anyone. Had I not seen Allah&#8217;s Apostle kissing you I would not have kissed you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have seen from the book of Swami Sivananda that they (the idolators) believe the Idol can answer them and solve their problem, which we don’t believe and Hazrat Umar says ‘’I know that you are a stone and can neither benefit nor harm anyone’’ we don’t believe that the Black Stone has the non bestowed power to benefit or harm us otherwise IT WOULD HAVE BEEN idol worship. Is kissing an act of worship? Can Agniveer show us one verse which says kissing is an act of worship? Kissing the Black stone is not obligatory</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Muslims go to Makkah to glorify God, not to kiss a stone or worship a man or a semi-divinity. Kissing or touching the Black Stone at the Ka`bah is an optional action, not obligatory or prescribed. Those who kiss the Black Stone or touch it do not do it because they have faith in the Stone or attribute any superstitious qualities to it. Their faith is in God only. They kiss, touch or point at the Stone only as a token of<strong> </strong>respect or a symbol of love for Prophet Muhammad, who laid the Stone at the foundation of the Ka`bah when it was reconstructed. (<a href="http://mdarik.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?cid=1123996015596&amp;counsel=aaislam&amp;pagename=IslamOnline-Mobile%2FWapCounselDetailE" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Source<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>)</p>
<p>Now some Hindus would say Kissing the Black Stone was a pagan ritual, Do they have any authentic proof for this? Kissing is an act of respect, So kissing the Black Stone is also an act of respect because it was sent from Heaven[7], as we have seen above it is not obligatory to kiss the Black Stone, it’s optional, If Muslims worships the Black stone (as the Anti Muslims claims) then it would have been obligatory to kiss it physically as the Idolators adore their Idols physically. The Black Stone is a starting point for circumambulation.</p>
<p>We circumambulate around the Kaaba because the Kaaba is the Qiblah (Direction) and what is the wisdom behind circumambulation is explained here</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Circumambulating the Kaaba represents the idea of oneness. Its meaning regarding the social life is not to leave unity and to try to maintain this unity. Its meaning regarding individual life contains deep truths. The sky has seven layers; man has seven souls. Each turning around the Kaaba represents a phase, a stage; man covers a phase and is elevated up to the seventh sky, above the material realm&#8230;  (<a href="http://www.questionsonislam.com/index.php?s=show_qna&amp;id=2952" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Source<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>)</p>

<p><em>3. We muslims only bow towards ONE Kaaba unlike hindus who have countless amount of statues, so what have you got to say about that?</em></p>
<p><strong>Comment-</strong> Hindus don’t have any idols we have PROVED that. So Muslims worship Kaaba idol whereas Hindus don’t. Even if I agree that Hindus worship idols, we are not having a competition here where the person who worships fewer idols is the winner. Our discussion is about idolatry itself, so whether, you bow towards one, or ten million idols, it does not make a difference here. It is like, if you jump into a pool of water which is 1 meter deep, or you jump into an ocean which is 7 miles deep, either way you will become wet. So, we are discussing whether you become wet or not. In contrast, whether you are an idolater or not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>‘’ <em>Even if I agree that Hindus worship idols, we are not having a competition here</em>’’ What do he mean by such statement, Hindus clearly profess to worship the Idol believing it to be God, Which is contradictory to our way of worship, Hindus having many idols is a very important point here, Don’t Agniveer know why the Hindus take Idols for worship? A famous verse from Bhagvad Gita can be used in many places in this article to refute the deception of Anti Muslims about Kaaba,</p>
<p>Gita 12.5 ’But, greater is the difficulty of those whose minds cling to the Unmanifested; for the goal of the Unmanifested is hard for the embodied being to reach.’’</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bhagavad Purana 1.9<strong>.</strong>41. At the Rajasuya-yajna (sacrifice) performed by Maharaja Yudhisthira, there was the greatest assembly of all the elite men of the world, the royal and learned orders, and in that great assembly Lord Sri Krsna was worshiped by one and all as the most exalted Personality of Godhead [as Idol]. This happened during my presence, and I remembered the incident in order to keep my mind upon the Lord.</p>
<p>Swami Prabhupada writes on this verse<strong>:</strong> So in that great assembly, Lord Sri Krsna was the cynosure of neighboring eyes. Everyone wanted to see Lord Krsna, and everyone wanted to pay his humble respects to the Lord. Bhismadeva remembered all this and was glad that his worshipful Lord, the Personality of Godhead [Idol], was present before him in His actual formal presence. So to meditate on the Supreme Lord is to meditate on the activities, form, pastimes, name and fame of the Lord. That is easier than what is imagined as meditation on the impersonal feature of the Supreme. In the Bhagavad-gita (12.5) it is clearly stated that to meditate upon the impersonal feature of the Supreme is very difficult. It is practically no meditation or simply a waste of time because very seldom is the desired result obtained. The devotees, however, meditate upon the Lord&#8217;s factual form and pastimes, and therefore the Lord is easily approachable by the devotees…</p>
<p>42. Now I can meditate with full concentration upon that one Lord, Sri Krsna, now present before me because now I have transcended the misconceptions of duality in regard to His presence in everyone&#8217;s heart, even in the hearts of the mental speculators. He is in everyone&#8217;s heart. The sun may be perceived differently, but the sun is one.</p>
<p>Bhagavat Purana 11.9.22 If out of love, hate or fear an embodied soul fixes his mind with intelligence and complete concentration upon a particular <strong>bodily form</strong>, he will certainly attain the form that he is meditating upon</p>
<p>The Idolators uses the Idols for concentration of God, thinking the Idol to be God or form of God, In this way they need Idol in front of them every time they worship as mentioned in Puranas</p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 11.23.21-33 … one is to worship one’s own Deity <strong>in front</strong> of fire or the <strong>image of any god</strong>…</p>
<p>They must face the Idol, they should ask the Idol, they think the Idol is god, We Muslims don’t have Holy Kaaba in the Mosques or houses when we worship, There are Muslims across the globe in USA, in China, in Indonesia which are miles away from the Holy Kaaba and we just bow towards the Kaaba living far away from it, Can any Idolator keep his Idol In Japan and worship it from England? Some fanatics might say YES due to their stubbornness so my counter question would be how can they concentrate on the Idol? As your own scripture says to keep the Idol for concentration, and several other verses from Puranas says to offer oblations to the Idol (Hindu God), to wash it etc.</p>
<p>It is obligatory for them to offer oblations to the Idol which I think has the origin of Vedas, In the Vedic period people used to offer oblation to the gods while worshiping them[8] and in the Puranas it is said that you should worship the God (Idols of God) by offering the oblations to them</p>
<p>Garuda Purana 13.72-74. Thus he should place the handsful of flowers before the Brahmin and the image of Hari, and then the bed-gift with its accompaniments, according to the rite.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Garuda Purana 112:1 The food is placed near the idol, and passes of the hands are made as though a influence it towards the image.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Bhagavat Purana 11:30:7 There we should bathe for purification, fast, and fix our minds in meditation. We should then worship the demigods by bathing their images, anointing them with sandalwood pulp, and presenting them various offerings</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the way Hindus worships the Idol, They offer oblations/offerings to the Idol just like people in the Vedic period used to offer oblations to the Vedic Gods, Does any Muslims offer oblations to the Kaaba? Does any Muslims keeps offering near the Kaaba, and then says facing the Kaaba ‘’O Allah this is for you, we are presenting this oblation to you please accept it’’ do any Muslim do that? It is prohibited to present food to the idols or to eat the food which is slaughtered for Idols or brought as offering to the Idol [9]
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So how can you do all those things (presenting offerings) living miles away from the Idol? The concept of fanatics doesn’t support their definition of idol worship. The Idol is a must for Hindus for the worship while Muslims even in <em>Masjid Al Haram</em> offer Salat standing many feet high above the Kaaba, the Hindus asks the Idol facing it, And It’s not obligatory for Muslims to face the Kaaba when we supplicate</p>
<p>…when a person making supplication (du&#8217;a) faces the sky&#8211;just as those performing the prayer (salat) face the Ka‘bah, since the sky is the qiblah of those who supplicate, as the Ka‘bah is the qiblah of those who perform the … <em>(Sahih Muslim bi Sharh al-Nawawi. 18 vols. Cairo 1349/1930. Reprint (18 vols. in 9). Beirut: Dar al-Fikr, 1401/1981, 5.24)</em></p>
<p>If Muslims worships the Kaaba then we would have commanded to face the Kaaba while we supplicate, just like the Hindus faces their Idols while asking them. Imam Ibn Kathir explains on facing the Qiblah while we are uncertain of the position of Kaaba</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tawaf is done around the Ka`bah and prayer is offered facing its direction in the majority of cases, with a few exceptions, such as when one is uncertain of the direction of the  Qiblah, during battle and when praying optional prayers while traveling. -Tafsir Ibn Kathir on the commentary of verses 22:26-27</p>
<p>Sayyidna Abdullah ibn Aamir ibn Rabi’ah reported from his father that hesaid, “We were travelling with the Prophet -‘&#8211;i on a dark night and did not know the direction of the qiblah. So everyone prayed in the direction opposite him. In the morning, we mentioned that to the Prophet (SAW) and the verse was revealed 1)I .m, i L.- (so withersoever you turn, there is Allah’s countenance. &#8211; Jamia Al Tirmizi 345</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If we worship the Kaaba then it would been obligatory for us to face Kaaba in any way when we are uncertain of the direction. No Idolator can face somewhere else other than his Idol when worshiping it because Idol is used for concentration which must be placed in front of them and they are commanded to do so.</p>

<p><em>4. No Muslim thinks of Kaaba stone as God/creator. But Hindus think of their idols as Gods and creator.</em></p>
<p><strong>Comment-</strong> No Hindu thinks his idol (as per your definition) as creator or God. That is why they throw them into rivers after many of their rituals. But as per our definition of idol, Non Muslims don’t have any idols in first place They use some stones to remember God because their God has commanded this. But on the other hand, Muslims worship Kaaba idol. They might not think Kaaba as their creator but they think it as house of their creator! So again they are found guilty of worshipping house. So they are house worshippers as well in addition to idol.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>MY RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before I proceed to other points, I want to clarify one point which is often raised by Arya Samaji Fanatics i.e., ‘’ <em>That is why they throw them into rivers after many of their rituals</em>.’’ Hindus submerge only Ganesh Idol with respect not as Agniveer says ‘’THROW into the rivers’’ the Hindus says they get bliss by doing it which is Shirk as they believe they get bliss from the Idol and they think the idol will return to heaven, Here is the video of Hindus submerging their Ganesh idol which is called <em>Ganesh Visarjan</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1JejGdCTsM" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">httpv://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1JejGdCTsM<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can anyone tell me whether the Hindus threw the Idol or immersed it with respect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>‘’ <em>They might not think Kaaba as their creator but they think it as house of their creator! So again they are found guilty of worshipping house. So they are house worshippers as well in addition to idol.</em>’’ Oh my God, Let me remind Agniveer the definition of Idol Worship</p>
<p>Idol Worship = An Image or Idol of God that is worshiped, Worshiping the Idol ‘’AS’’ God.</p>
<p>If someone don’t think their Idol to be God or thinks the Idol does not possess any power then it’s not Idol worship.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>‘’ <em>No Hindu thinks his idol (as per your definition) as creator or God.</em>’’ It’s just another personal view of Agniveer, We have already seen above from Hindu scholars themselves that the Hindus think theirs Idols to be God, I shall provide you with few more proofs</p>
<p>Chandogya Upanishad Commentary by Shankarcharya on 12.1.4 … think of the name as Brahman, and meditate upon it, <strong>just as people worship the idol, thinking it to be Vishnu Himself.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To the worshipper who believes the symbol, any kind of image is the body of the Lord under the form of stone, clay, brass, picture, Saligrama, etc. Such worship can never be idolatry. All matter is a manifestation of God. God is present in everything which exists. Everything is an object of worship, for all is a manifestation of God who is therein worshipped. &#8211; All About Hinduism Pg 72, By Swami Sivananda</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Swami Sivananda like many other Hindus is going to the extent and saying they don’t worship the Idol but they worship the God because Idol is also a manifestation/Form of God who is therein worshiped</p>
<p>Sanskrit version: dravyaiḥ prasiddhair mad-yāgaḥ pratimādiṣv amāyinaḥ bhaktasya ca yathā-labdhair hṛdi bhāvena caiva hi<br />
[Note: The Sanskrit word used in Bhagwat Purana is अर्चा (Arca/archa) and प्रतिमा (Pratima) which is translated as Idol, Image or Deity Form]
<p>Bhagavat Purana 11.27.15 One should worship Me in My Deity forms [Pratima] by offering the most excellent paraphernalia. But a devotee completely freed from material desire may worship Me with whatever he is able to obtain…</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Garuda Purana 12.6-10. One should make a golden image of Visnu, a silver one of Brahma, a copper one of Rudra, and an iron one of Yama, O Bird. To the west there should be a pot filled with Ganges water for Visnu; and upon it one should place Visnu, clad in yellow robes. To the east there should be a pot of milk and water for Brahma; and there one should place Brahma, clad in white robes. To the north there should be a pot of honey and clarified butter for Rudra, and there one should place Rudra, clad in red robes.</p>
<p>The above verse does not say ‘’To the east there should be a pot of milk and water for BRAHMA’S IDOL’’ rather it says ‘’there should be a pot of milk and water FOR BRAHMA’’ This implies the Hindu scripture does believe the Idols to be Gods themselves.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>‘’Therefore, the bhakti-yogi accepts the Deity of Krishna as worshipable because there is some bodily conception fixed in the mind, which can thus be applied. Of course, worship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His form within the temple is not idol worship. There is evidence in the Vedic literature that worship may be saguna and nirguna—of the Supreme possessing or not possessing attributes. Worship of the Deity in the temple is saguna worship, for the Lord is represented by material qualities. But the form of the Lord, though represented by material qualities such as stone, wood or oil paint, is not actually material. That is the absolute nature of the Supreme Lord…God has an authorized representation in the Deity form [Idol], which is called arca-vigraha. This arca-vigraha is an incarnation of the Supreme Lord <strong>Commentary by Srila Prabhupada</strong> on Gita 12:5’’</p>
<p>Srila Prabhupada says the same as Swami Sivananda that Hindus don’t worship Idols but they worship God because the Idol is not a material but it is a nature/form of the God.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bhagwat Purana 11.27.12 The Deity form[Idol] of the Lord is said to appear in eight varieties — stone, wood, metal, earth, paint, sand, the mind or jewels.</p>
<p>Bhagwat Purana 11.27.12 śailī dāru-mayī lauhī lepyā lekhyā ca saikatī mano-mayī maṇi-mayī pratimāṣṭa-vidhā smṛtā</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Swami Prabhupada states</strong>: <a href="http://srimadbhagavatam.com/s/srila" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Śrīla<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> <a href="http://srimadbhagavatam.com/j/jiva" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Jīva<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> Gosvāmī explains that certain Deity forms, such as those made of sand, are manifested for a brief time to fulfill a personal desire of the worshiper. Those, however, who desire to attain pure love of God should worship the permanent form of the Deity (made, for instance, of marble, gold or brass), and they should maintain continual worship. In <a href="http://srimadbhagavatam.com/k/krsna" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Kṛṣṇa<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> consciousness there is no scope for neglecting the worship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bhagwat Purana 11.27.48 arcādiṣu yadā yatra śraddhā māḿ tatra cārcayet sarva-bhūteṣv ātmani ca sarvātmāham avasthitaḥ</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bhagwat Purana 11.27.48 Whenever one develops faith in Me in <strong>My form [Idol] as the Deity</strong> or in other bona fide manifestations one should <strong>worship Me in that form</strong>. I certainly exist both within all created beings and also separately in My original form, since I am the Supreme Soul of all.</p>
<p><strong>Swami Prabhupada states</strong>: The Supreme Personality of Godhead is worshiped according to the faith of a particular worshiper. The Deity form, arcā, is specifically mentioned here because Deity worship is essential for spiritual progress. Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura mentions that inexperienced persons may think that the Deity [Idol] is meant for the sense gratification of the worshiper, since superficially the Deity [Idol] is made of external substances such as marble or brass. But through the process of installing the Deity by <strong>chanting of authorized mantras, one invites the Supreme Personality of Godhead to enter the Deity form [Idol].</strong> By regulated, faithful worship one gradually <strong>understands that the Deity [Idol] is completely nondifferent from the Supreme Lord Himself</strong>…</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So the Hindu God appears in eight varieties and they are his forms/incarnations, All these things  proves the Hindus believe their Idol to be God. The Idolators make the Idol with their hands, even at that time they don’t consider the idol to be God, They say the idol becomes God after it is being installed properly according to their rites and by reciting few Mantras and they say after reciting some Mantras the God comes into the Idol.</p>

<p><strong>Comment-</strong> It is proven that Hindus don’t worship idols (as per our definition of idolatry). They don’t have idols in first place. They only worship God almighty. But question is why Muslims worship Kaaba idol? Can it slap the one who spits on it or kiss the one who loves it? If no, then why our Muslim friends worship Kaaba idol?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>‘<em>’ It is proven that Hindus don’t worship idols</em>’’ Really? Then could you please explain me these verses?</p>
<p>Garuda Purana 17-.19. Then the son should place upon the bed a golden image/Idol, <strong>and having worshiped it</strong> <strong>[The Idol]</strong>…</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 3.24.19 O sinless one! Establish my <strong>image</strong> in this city and <strong>worship it</strong> [The Idol] three times, morning, mid-day and evening carefully and with devotion</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These verses from Puranas makes all doubts clear, The Hindus Indeed worship their Idols.</p>
<p>Dayanand said,</p>
<p>The verse which they chant at the time of offering worship is written on page 92 of the Ratnasar Bhaga. Ti means, &#8220;May we worship the (idols of) the Tirthankars &#8211; who had completely mastered their passions and offer to them water, sandal, rice, flowers, incense.&#8221; This is the reason why we say that idol-worship is originated with the Jainees. <strong>Satyarth Prakash, chapter 12, page 562 </strong><a href="http://satyarthprakash.in/english/chapter-twelve/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">http://satyarthprakash.in/english/chapter-twelve/<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dayanand also said that ‘’<em>They too, whom you call image-worshippers, do not regard the image as God. They profess to worship God behind the image</em>’’ <strong>Satyarth Prakash, Chapter 14. Page 664</strong><br />

<p>Now you can see how Dayanand contradicted his own statements. Works of half cooked scholars like Dayanand will tend to have errors, so it’s not my problem. But the above quotation from Satyarth shows the Idolators worships the Idols</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>‘<em>’But question is why Muslims worship Kaaba idol? Can it slap the one who spits on it or kiss the one who loves it?</em>’’ Did any Muslim claimed the Kaaba will punish one who spits on it?</p>

<p>From the above replies, one can estimate <strong>how easy it becomes to argue when you take in assumption what you have to prove already! This is what Muslims do. First assume that Non Muslims are idolaters and they themselves are not and then start arguing as if they are universal monotheists and Non Muslims are universal idolaters/polytheists.</strong> This is ridiculous. Muslims need to come out of this hypocrisy soon because it is not going to last for a longer period now. Here is one example of a man suffering from <em>circular logic syndrome</em>, Zakir Naik, who is known more for his <a href="http://satyagni.com/5024/zakir-naik-patriot-or-traitor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">nexus with anti Indian elements<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> than Islamic preaching, sharing his views on idolatry of Hindus.</p>

<p><strong>MY RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>Islam is the true monotheistic religion on earth, Anti Muslims keeps on attacking Islam and all their arguments are being refuted. Agniveer thinks his statements are strong enough to ‘’EXPOSE’’ other religions. Not to forget Agniveer won’t end his article without criticizing Dr. Naik. The Arya Samajis are fanatics from the foundation of their sect, at that time they just criticized and had no reason to reply to why they are criticizing other religions, As Dr. Naik now brings some comparative studies of religions, these Arya Samajis have got a nice reason to criticize Islam, Though they cannot show a single line of Dr. Zakir Naik criticizing Vedas yet they consider him to be Anti Hindu.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>AGNIVEER WROTE:</strong></p>
<p>On the argument that idols are used by Hindus only for concentration, Zakir says that <em>those people who have lower level of consciousness need idols. But we Muslims have already reached the higher level of consciousness and thus we don’t need idols.</em></p>
<p>We have nothing to say on idol worship-consciousness issue. What we are interested in is Zakir’s logic behind lower consciousness of Hindus. One can ask few questions to the <em>highly conscious</em> Zakir here</p>
<p>1. Muslims as community are found at the bottom of the list of progressive communities worldwide. <em>Highly conscious</em> Muslims are nowhere found in the pool of eminent scientists/mathematicians. Is it due to the lower consciousness of the Kafir scientists and mathematicians that Muslims don’t want to share pool with them? If Zakir Bhai could ponder…</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>Now Agniveer has gone back to his habit of diverting the topic, is this article about Idol worship or about Muslims? In some parts of India such as Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Kerala… The literacy rate of Muslims is higher than the Hindus. These Hindus talks about progressive community as if India is a developed nation. By the grace of Muslims, India has gained a lot of things, India owe the Muslims, there is endless list of what Muslims have done for India. The Hindus should not be too happy, because much of the inventions and discoveries of India is contributed by Muslims and Buddhists in India and not by Hindus alone.

<p>3. Proclaiming high consciousness for self is not a smart idea anyway. Because as Zakir claims there is no need for Muslims to concentrate as they are already in higher consciousness, some Muslim might claim some day that I don’t need to worship Allah because I already remember Him all the time! What will happen then?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>MY RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>Worship is obligatory for Muslims, No Muslim can say ‘’we don’t need to worship’’ It’s one of the five pillars of Islam to offer Salat 5 times a day.</p>
<p>‘’ <em>because I already remember Him all the time</em>’’ Remembering Allah is called Zikr, it is also a kind of worship other than Salat. Agniveer thinks Salat means remembering God, Salat has many definitions as I stated earlier other than remembering Allah.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>AGNIVEER WROTE</strong>:</p>
<p>Actually Talibani ideology has severely damaged the analytical skills of Zakir Bhai. When someone says he needs to concentrate, it does not mean that he/she is of lower consciousness. Rather it means that he/she wants to uplift the current state of mind further to reach higher goals. It is similar to a scientist sitting alone in a peaceful room trying to concentrate on some topic. But Zakir Bhai will think of him as a man of lower consciousness or a psychiatric patient who can’t concentrate!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>MY RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now Agniveer has come into defensive mode for Idol worship of Hindus. I quoted from a book above which says ‘’Image-worship is very necessary for beginners’’ which shows the person who wants to concentrate on the Idol is of lower consciousness. If he is using the Idol for concentration then it means he is of lower consciousness because he would rather think about the form of God in his mind and worships the God, There is a good explanation for Agniveer from a commentary on Bhagwat Purana.</p>
<p><strong>‘’</strong>For those who cannot properly appreciate the activities of authorized devotees, Deity worship is the only way for spiritual advancement. In the Caitanya-caritämåta (Antya 7.11) it is clearly said, kåñëa-çakti vinä nahe tära pravartana: without being authorized by Kåñëa, one cannot preach the holy name of the Lord throughout the entire world. Nevertheless, a devotee who does so is criticized by neophyte devotees, kaniñöha-adhikärés, who are on the lower stages of devotional service. For them, Deity worship [arca/Idol Worship] is strongly recommended’’ <strong>Commentary on Bhagavad Purana 7.14.39 by Swami Prabhupada</strong></p>
<p>Can Agniveer now answer who needs Idol worship? People who are of lower consciousness needs Idol worship, after they become perfect focusing on the Form of their lord, theirs concentration power is advanced as mentioned by Swami ‘’ Deity worship is the only way for spiritual advancement’’. One commentary from Puranas will help you understand it</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam 4.30.27 Commentary by Swami Prabhupada: The form of the Lord as worshiped in the temples is called arca-vigraha or arcavatara, the worshipable form [Idol Worship], the Deity incarnation. This facility is offered to neophyte devotees so that they can see the real form of the Lord face to face and offer their respectful obeisances and sacrifices in the form of arca. Through such facilities the neophytes gradually invoke their original Krsna consciousness. Deity worship in the form of temple worship is the most valuable benediction <strong>given by the Lord to beginners</strong>. All neophytes must therefore engage in the worship of the Lord by keeping the arca-vigraha (arcavatara)[Idol] at home or in the temple.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Arya Samajis and other Anti Muslim fanatics are accusing us of worshiping the Kaaba on the basis that we the Muslims bow to the Kaaba so it is worship (according to their definition), If it’s all about bowing then why don’t they accept to be Rishi and the Arya Samaji women to be Husband worshipers because their own Vedas commands them to bow to Rishis and women to their Husbands</p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.139. 9 … I bow down with song, to Indra, Agni, bow with song.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="868" height="188" class="wp-image-7921" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201-36.png" alt="https://truthabouthinduism.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/rv-5-36-6.png" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201-36.png 868w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201-36-300x65.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201-36-768x166.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 868px) 100vw, 868px" /></p>
<p>Some fanatics replies to this by saying ‘<em>’We are not worshiping while bowing to them, We bow to them because to respect them</em>’’ Do we kiss the Black Stone to worship it? We kiss it because it’s an act of respect, why do they forget this why do they have such hypocrisy? They say they bow because it’s an act of respecting, first let me give the definition Idolatry according to Dayanad</p>
<p>‘’To bow down before an material object or worship it is idolatry’’ [Satyarth Prakash pg 445]
<p>The above reference from Satyarth Prakash says to ANY MATERIAL OBJECT, the cloth we wear is also a material as Agniveer also gives the definition of idol as anything that we can touch and see, so does that mean the people used to worship the cloths of Rishis? Or were the Rishis used to stand naked while people bowed before them? We should use their own concept to refute them, so now they might say ‘<em>’no we don’t bow down to the cloths we bow down to the rishis</em>’’ as I said we should use their own concept, we should reply ‘’the Idolators says the same that they don’t bow down to the idol but they bow down to the God’’ , Now wouldn’t this make the Vedic followers as Cloth Worshipers?</p>
<p>The Kaaba Idol topic is the most favorite topic of Arya Samajis, You can see it yourself by reading the comments in this site and other sites, after each and every discussion no matter what the topic is, suddenly they divert it to ‘’You are Kaaba Idol worshipers, You Idolator’’ topic, as usual they lose in this topic too which is their most favorite topic and the last thing they say after losing is ‘’Break the Kaaba to prove you don’t worship it’’ Agniveer had also said this</p>
<p>‘’<em>If Kaaba is just a Kibla (direction),</em> can Zakir Naik hammer it down <em>just like his Arab masters did with the idols of Hindus while they invaded India? (If anyone is hurt by this, please read those verses of Quran which order Muslims to break idols of others and kill the idolaters)’’</em></p>
<p>What will they do if I prove that Muslims had broken it earlier? Will they admit we don’t worship the Kaaba and later accept our challenges on their Monotheism? The Sahabas brought down the Kaaba to ground level for its reconstruction after it was burned when people of Sham raided Mecca</p>
<p><strong>Ibn Az-Zubayr rebuilds Al-Ka`bah the way the Prophet wished</strong> (<a href="http://www.qtafsir.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=303&amp;Itemid=36" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Source<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>)</p>
<p>Ibn Az-Zubayr did not touch the House until the people came for Hajj, for he wanted to incite them against the people of Ash-Sham. He said to them, `O people! Advise me regarding the Ka`bah, should we bring it down and rebuild it, or just repair the damage it sustained… When the three days had passed, he decided to bring the Ka`bah down. The people hesitated to bring it down, fearing that the first person to climb on the House would be struck down. A man went on top of the House and threw some stones down, and when the people saw that no harm touched him, they started doing the same. They brought the House down to ground level. &#8211; <strong>Tafsir ibn Kathir </strong><br />
<a href="http://www.qtafsir.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=303" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">http://www.qtafsir.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=303<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>The Kaaba was just damaged, the Sahabas (Companions of Prophet) could have repaired it, but instead they BROUGHT KAABA TO GROUND LEVEL, Just think about it, there were no latest machines available 1400 years ago so it must have taken a lot of time to rebuild the Kaaba and people still offered Salat.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Kaaba was again brought down to and then was rebuilt again Abdul-Malik wrote back, `We do not agree with Ibn Az- Zubayr&#8217;s actions. As, for the Ka`bah&#8217;s height, leave it  as it is. As for what he added from the  Hijr, bring it  down, and build the House as it was before and close the door.&#8217;  Therefore, Al-Hajjaj brought down the House and rebuilt it as it was.&#8221; – Ibid</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also find a story about rebuilding the Ka’bah during Prophet Muhammad S.A.W’s time [10]. Can the Idolators break their Idol? No! because they think their Idols are Gods, Even if their Idols are absent then they are commanded to make a form and then worship it[11] this shows Idol is very necessary for them, The Kaaba was brought down to ground level twice by the companions of Prophet and also by Prophet himself and people still offered Salat, So it’s impossible to worship the Kaaba without its presence. Hence this proves we Muslims are not Idolators and we don’t worship the Kaaba.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I said earlier if Islamic way of worship is Idolatry then it must match with Idolators way of worship, because if a teacher is accusing his/her student of copying from another student’s answer paper then both of their answers must match with each other. It is not necessary to keep on writing several lines to prove Muslims don’t worship the Kaaba, Just three points are enough to refute the claim of anti Muslims on ‘’Muslims worships the Kaaba’’</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>1)</strong>      Hindus uses the Idol for concentration and it must be in front of them</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>‘’But, greater is the difficulty of those whose minds cling to the Unmanifested; for the goal of the Unmanifested is hard for the embodied being to reach.’’ Gita 12:5</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bhagavat Purana 11.9.22 If out of love, hate or fear an embodied soul fixes his mind with intelligence and complete concentration upon a particular <strong>bodily form</strong>, he will certainly attain the form that he is meditating upon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 11.23.21-33 … one is to worship one’s own Deity <strong>in front</strong> of fire or the <strong>image of any god</strong>…</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2)</strong>       Hindus believe the Idols are forms of God or God himself present in the Idol</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bhagwat Purana 11.27.12 The Deity form[Idol] of the Lord is said to appear in eight varieties — stone, wood, metal, earth, paint, sand, the mind or jewels.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bhagwat Purana 11.27.48 Whenever one develops faith in Me in <strong>My form as the Deity [Idol]</strong> or in other bona fide manifestations one should <strong>worship Me in that form</strong>. I certainly exist both within all created beings and also separately in My original form, since I am the Supreme Soul of all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3)</strong>     Hindu scripture commands to worship the Idol as a form of God</p>
<p>Devi Bhagavatam 3.24.19 O sinless one! Establish my <strong>image</strong> in this city and <strong>worship it</strong> [The Idol] three times, morning, mid-day and evening carefully and with devotion</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the Islamic perspectives if someone believes that there is other being which possesses non-bestowed attributes of Allah then it is <em>Shirk</em>, And the teachings of Dayanand promotes <em>Shirk</em>, Now let’s compare our view to the views of Arya Samajis just like they do it in their articles, Dayanand said</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>40. Are the Vedas eternal or non-eternal?</p>
<p>A.- They are eternal. God being eternal, His knowledge and attributes must necessarily be eternal, because the nature, attributes and character of an eternal substance are also eternal and vice versa. &#8211; <em>Satyarth Prakash pg 241</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vixter who is one of the team member of Agniveer/Satyagni sites wrote in a comment</p>
<p>&#8221;Why do you have to write long baseless nonsense essays? Just think of it logically. Can I believe in Allah alone and escape suffering?? If yes, then people like Zakir Naik claim that I will burn in hell because I refused to believe in Mohammad or refused to think of him or take his name while I pray to Allah=&gt; If No, then Islam is not a monotheistic religion. Allah is one entity and Mohammad is another entity, now Mono means “one” so islam does not have the right to call itself Monotheism if one has to believe in Mohammad as well&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; We can only promise to believe in one entity, but if we are told to believe in Mohammad as well then that makes it two entities hence Islam cannot be monotheistic religion? Get my point.Islam will only be monotheistic if we believe in Allah alone without believing in Mohammad (either as a messenger, prophet, angel, or any other agent to God).As per Vedic Dharam, I do not have to believe in the rishis, I can alone just remember Ishwar and Ishwar only.’’</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>My Response</strong>: Dayanand wrote in his book</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. How many entities are eternal or beginningless….Q.What are your authorities for this statement?</p>
<p>A.- &#8220;Both God and the soul are eternal, they are alike in consciousness and such other attributes.  They are associated together &#8211; God pervading the soul &#8211; and are mutual companions. <em>Satyarth Prakash pg 241-</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If we use Vixter’s concept here then he is a worshiper of three entities they are God, Soul and <em>Prakriti</em> because they are ‘<em>’Mutual Companions</em>’’ and according to Vixter if there are 2 entities then it is polytheism. Also if he is supposed to believe in Ishwar and Ishwar only then why does the Vedas commands to kill the person who rejects Vedas?</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 12:5:62 Kill the people by cutting them by tearing them by burning them into ashes by blowing those who reject the Vedas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just like the Arya Samajis challenged us to break the Kaaba to prove we don’t worship it so now they should disrespect their God (The Vedas) to prove they don’t worship the Vedas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Satyarth Prakash Dayanand quoted couple of verses to show prohibition of Idol Worship, Here I will quote only one verse because the rest of the verses were taken from Keno Upanishad which is  not authoritative text according to Agniveer Samajis,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q. &#8211; If the Vedas do not explicitly sanction idol-worship, they do not condemn the practice either. If they do condemn it, the inference is clear that the practice must have existed in ancient times, for it has been said, &#8220;Only that can be condemned which prevails.&#8221;</p>
<p>A. ~ Of course there is no sanction for this practice (in the Veda and the Shaastraas), but on the other hand it is positively condemned thus:-</p>
<p>(1) &#8220;They are enveloped in darkness, in other words, are steeped in ignorance and sunk in the greatest depths of misery who worship the uncreated, eternal prakriti &#8211; the material cause of the world &#8211; in place of the All-pervading God, but those who worship visible things born of the prakriti, such as the earth, trees, bodies (human and the like) in place of God are enveloped in still greater darkness, in other words, they are extremely foolish, fall into an awful hell of pain and sorrow, and suffer terribly for a long time.&#8221; YAJUR VEDA 40: 9.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now let’s have a look what the Vedas says</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.27.1 WITH worship will I glorify thee, Agni, like a long-tailed steed, Imperial Lord of sacred rites.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="862" height="155" class="wp-image-7922" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201-37.png" alt="https://truthabouthinduism.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/rv-1-27-1.png" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201-37.png 862w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201-37-300x54.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201-37-768x138.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 862px) 100vw, 862px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rig Veda 2.2.1 WITH sacrifice exalt Agni who knows all life; worship him &#8216;with oblation and the song of praise…</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="864" height="183" class="wp-image-7923" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201-38.png" alt="https://truthabouthinduism.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/rv-2-2-1.png" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201-38.png 864w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201-38-300x64.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201-38-768x163.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 864px) 100vw, 864px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rig Veda 4.17.18 …Indra, we the priests have paid thee worship, exalting thee with these our sacrifices.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="850" height="193" class="wp-image-7924" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201-39.png" alt="https://truthabouthinduism.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/rv-4-17-18.png" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201-39.png 850w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201-39-300x68.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201-39-768x174.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to Vedas Indra and Agni were born[12].  If Yajur Veda 40.9 is a verse prohibiting Idol Worship then other verses permits and even recommends Idol Worship as Agni, Earth and other Deities are born out of Prakriti (Material) which is Idol worship. Agniveer said ‘’ <em>So idol is anything concrete we can touch and see</em>’’ In this way even the fire would become an Idol, now we will see what the Vedas says about Fire worship</p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.45.1 I WORSHIP the Vasus, Agni! here, the Rudras, the Adityas, all Who spring from Manu, those who know fair rites, who pour their blessings down.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rig Veda 5.28.6 Invoke and worship Agni while the sacrificial rite proceeds…</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="859" height="118" class="wp-image-7925" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201-40.png" alt="https://truthabouthinduism.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/rv-5-28-6.png" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201-40.png 859w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201-40-300x41.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201-40-768x105.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 859px) 100vw, 859px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This would not become Fire worship but Idol worship according to Agniveer’s statement, Agniveer said ‘’ <em>Oh!</em> <strong>I wonder how do our Jihadi friends kiss the “direction” and then circumambulate it’’</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If Circumambulating and Kissing means Idol worship then the Vedas strictly commands to worship Idols</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rig Veda 7.1.16 This is the Agni invoked in many places: Whom the prince, presenting oblations to, kindles, whom the ministrant priest circumambulates at sacrifices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rig Veda 5.60.1 &#8230;circumambulating (the fire), may I exalt the praise of the Maruts.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="859" height="188" class="wp-image-7926" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201-41.png" alt="https://truthabouthinduism.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/rv-5-60-1.png" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201-41.png 859w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201-41-300x66.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201-41-768x168.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 859px) 100vw, 859px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rig Veda 4.6.4-5 …Agni, the offerer of the oblation, ancient and multiplying (the offerings) thrice circumambulates (the victim) like a keeper of cattle&#8230;Agni, the sacrifices, the exhilarator, the sweet spoken, the object of the sacrifice, moving measuredly, circumambulates (the victim) of his own (accord)&#8230;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.80.5 With songs of praise the Rsis call on Agni; on Agni, heroes worsted in the foray. Birds flying in the region call on Agni around a thousand cattle Agni wanders.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="874" height="192" class="wp-image-7928" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201-43.png" alt="https://truthabouthinduism.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/rv-10-80-5.png" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201-43.png 874w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201-43-300x66.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-truthabouthinduism-files-wordpress-com-201-43-768x169.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 874px) 100vw, 874px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The above two verses says Agni circumambulated thousand cattle, Does that mean Agni worshipped cattle?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
[Horace] Rig Veda 1.144.1 The ministering priest, (qualified) by experience, and possessing exalted and graceful devotion, proceeds (to celebrate) his, (Agni&#8217;s), worship,having circumambulated (the altar), he takes up the ladles which are first to present the oblations.</p>

<p>The Vedas talks about circumambulating Agni and other things, if circumambulation is worship then Arya Samajis are Idol worshipers because they circumambulate cattle, Maruts (Air), Agni etc. which are born out of Prakriti and we can touch and see them (except for air), Also if kissing is an act of worship then the Vedas says to worship son and mother as it talks about kiss between the mother and son+. According to Islamic perspective invoking other things besides Allah like invoking Stone, Fire, Earthly gods… is <em>Shirk</em> and the Vedas speaks about invoking Agni</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rig Veda1.12.2 With callings ever they invoke Agni, Agni, Lord of the House, Oblation-bearer, much beloved</p>

<p>Now some Hindus might argue that this is not Idol worship, Even if we admit this is not Idol worship as per definition given by Maharishi Agniveer of Agniveer Samaj then it is a major sin according to Yajur Veda 40.9 which says not to worship the things born out of Prakriti (Material, Nature, Matter…), And even a child knows Fire (Agni) is born out of Prakriti</p>
<p>Sam Veda 1.1.1.9 When he enkindles Agni, man should with his heart attend the song:I kindle Agni till he glows.</p>

<p>This implies Idols were created during the Vedic period and could also be worshiped for concentration, This verse is used by the Orthodox Hindu scholars to show Idol Worship in Vedas.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>بِسۡمِ ٱللهِ ٱلرَّحۡمَـٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ</p>
<p>by Sulaiman Razvi</p>
<p>This is my rebuttal to a Arya Samaji who has made objections on Muslim festival Eid ul Azha popularly known as Bakird in the subcontinent. He has grossly misinterpreted many Quranic verses and has attempted to convince Muslims to give up meat consumption particularly animal slaughter during Eid ul Azha. I am not a scholar, so may Allah forgive me if I committ any error in explaining Quranic verses. Inshallah in this article I shall refute all objections raised by the Arya Samaji.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>AGNIVEER WROTE:</strong></p>
<p>2. And if a festival is called Cow-Id when the story is about sacrifice of a sheep, why not instead call it Grains-Id and simply distribute food-grains for needy ones? After all the resources spent on 1 kg of meat is able to produce more than 10 kg of food-grains. This shows that the person who started this festival was anyone but someone inspired from Allah. How can Allah be so wasteful and brutal?<span id="more-126"></span></p>
<p><strong>MY RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>Refer to my answer A) below, The grains which are used to feed the animals are not fit for humans to consume, So where is any wasting here, in fact, the grains which are inedible for humans are helpful in feeding the animals.</p>
<p><strong>AGNIVEER WROTE:</strong></p>
<p>3. Allah came in dream of Prophet Abraham to order him to kill his son. Does Allah come similarly in dreams of Muslims who butcher animals to celebrate Id? If not, why they try to imitate Abraham like a monkey? And if they still want to imitate Abraham, why not butcher their own children and wait for Allah to stop their hands if He wishes so? Why this double standard?</p>
<p>The reason is clear – All Muslims know clearly that no Allah ever appears in dreams or stands up to stop people from doing certain actions in such fantastic manners. So basically they are trying to fool Allah to make Him believe how much they love Him without giving an inch of sacrifice.</p>
<p><strong>MY RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>3) Allah did not come in the dream of Prophet Ibrahim A.S, Prophet Ibrahim first had a dream that he was sacrificing his son which was an inspiration from Allah SWT and he recognized it. Why would Muslim slaughter their children when Prophet Ibrahim A.S did not do and Allah did not command us to slaughter our children, The story of Prophet Ibrahim and Prophet Isameel is an example for Muslims to put our trust in Allah and to be patient.</p>
<p>Agnvieer states: ‘’ <em>if they still want to imitate Abraham, why not butcher their own children</em>’’</p>
<p>Its actually the Vedas which promotes human sacrifice, Vedas has story of Vedic god Varuna asking for sacrifice of a boy named Shunashepah, but this was not to test the father of Shunahshepa, Varuna was being serious when he asked for the slaughter of the child Shunahshepa, for more information one can read the article <a href="/index.php/2014/02/16/purushamedha-the-human-sacrifice/" data-wpel-link="internal">Purushamedha The Human Sacrifice</a>. Veda also speaks of the sacrifice of Purusha (man),</p>
<p>Rig Veda 10.90.6 When Gods prepared the sacrifice with Purusa as their offering…</p>
<p>The Human sacrifice is called as Purushamedha, Agniveer will know about it when he starts reading ‘’His Beloved Book’’ and the Yajur Veda 24.24-30 verses, These verses talk about Sacrifices of many animals and birds.</p>
<p><strong>AGNVIEER WROTE:</strong></p>
<p>4. Muslim scholars across the world have denounced this story as a fake one. They rightly state that Allah can never come in anyone’s dream to ask him to kill his children. When Allah has himself prohibited murder, how come He act as a criminal by asking anyone to do so. Ideally, even if Allah came in dream to ask Abraham to kill his son, he should have said clearly to Allah that he cannot disobey Allah’s original orders. This would have been the real passing of test of Allah.</p>
<p><strong>MY RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>4) When the Qur’an and Hadiths clearly speak about the sacrifice then who can falsify this story? I would like to know who are the Muslims scholars across the world who have denounced this story. Muslims must follow each and every command of Allah even if they don’t like it because it is for our benefit, that’s the moral of this story. How would this be a sin when Prophet Abraham A.S did not slaughter his child, It would have been cruel <strong>IF</strong> Allah S.W.T had commanded Prophet Abraham A.S to carry on the slaughter of Prophet Ibrahim’s innocent son which Allah did not do.</p>
<p><strong>AGNVIEER WROTE:</strong></p>
<p>Further, when Allah already knows everything, why does He need to take crazy tests? After all He also knows the answer that the examinee will give. Why such a drama then?</p>
<p><strong>MY RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>This is a stupid point, the stories of Prophets are examples to the believers so is Prophet Ibrahim A.S’s story which tells us to put our total trust in Allah SWT and to follow each and every command of Allah,</p>
<p>25:58 And put Thy trust In Him who lives and dies not; and celebrate His praise; and Enough is He to be acquainted with the faults of His servants;-</p>
<p>If Ishwar knew future then why did he create his enemies?</p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.176.3 Within whose hands deposited all the Five Peoples’ treasures rest. Mark thou the man who injures us and kill him like the heavenly bolt.</p>
<p>Rig Veda 3.3016 A cry is beard from enemies most near us: against them send thy fiercest-flaming weapon. Rend them from under, crush them and subdue them. Slay, Maghavan, and make the fiends our booty.</p>
<p>So why did Ishwar made his enemy when he already knew that they will try to kill him and then Ishwar will command his Agents to rend, cut, burn, crush them, Isn’t Ishwar all-knowing? Why such Drama then?</p>
<p><strong>AGNIVEER WROTE:</strong></p>
<p>But the fake Quran available today creates a villain out of Allah. Allah Himself creates rule and then instigates His followers to break those rules. For example, He asked everyone to bow down to none other than Allah Himself. But then He ordered Satan to bow down to Adam. When Satan refused, He was punished by Allah. To read this tragedy in poetic form, please visit Shaitan Ka Dukhda.</p>
<p><strong>MY RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>There is no fake Qur’an or original Qur’an, Anti Muslims can only make such bogus claims, The Qur’an is preserved according to both Sunni and Shia scholars and all the Muslims have the same version of Qur’an, But there are many versions of Vedas available today and they differ a lot, for instance, read the article <a href="/index.php/2014/01/02/textual-corruption-of-the-vedas/" data-wpel-link="internal">Textual Corruption of the Vedas</a>.</p>
<p>This is a stupid claim too, Before the law given to Prophet Muhammad P.B.U.H, doing <em>Sajdah</em> to anyone was allowed, There were two kinds of prostrations Sajdah E Tazimi and Sajdah E Ibadat, Sajdah E Tazimi could be done to any person to pay him/her respect and honour him/her and Sajdah E Ibadat must only be done for Allah and this kind of Sajdah (i.e Sajdah e Ibadat) is worship, we read about Prophet Yusuf A.S’s family prostrating before him to honour him (Sajdah e Tazimi) In Surah e Yusuf 12:100, at that time it was allowed to prostrate anyone for honouring the person, and it is prohibited in the law of Prophet Muhammad PBUH to prostrate to anyone may it be Sajdah E Tazimi or Sajdah E Ibadat except for Allah and Muslims can prostrate only to Allah alone now, If Agnvieer does not know about the Sharia then he should not comment on Qur’an and how can he say that <strong>FIRST</strong> Allah ordered not to bow down to anyone except Allah? Because this law was given to Prophet Muhammad S.A.W and not to Prophet Adam A.S.</p>
<p><strong>AGNIVEER WROTE:</strong></p>
<p>Just think, if instead of killing the son, what should Abraham have done if Allah had asked him to rape his child? Should he have followed the order of Allah? Incidentally, such stories have opened a Pandora’s Box. Refer http://www.dnaindia.com/world/odd-news_father-marries-daughter-citing-divine-sanction_1134275</p>
<p>Hence it is proven that such fake stories do not exist in original Quran. Muslims should reject all such fake verses that denigrate Allah and Muhammad who is alleged to have compiled such illogical verses under inspiration of Allah.</p>

<p>He said ‘’sees THE SAME everywhere’’ and Agniveer talked about “raping the child”, Agniveer must have experienced sexual exploitation by his own father (not Niyog father) after all Vedas of Arya Samaj permits all sort of immoral and obscene acts. <a href="/index.php/2014/05/15/there-is-indeed-obscenity-in-vedas/" data-wpel-link="internal">Vedas</a> has references of the sun god raping his wife after assuming the form of a horse, <a href="/index.php/2016/05/05/brahmas-incestuous-relationship-with-his-daughter/" data-wpel-link="internal">Veda</a> even has reference of Brahma raping his daughter. So followers of such book would definitely look for immorality in others as they have become accustomed to reading pornography in their texts. So such thing (citing divine inspiration) can be justified only in Hinduism, as Vedas also promote all sort of incest but doesn’t prohibit it even indirectly. A follower of such rapist religion will only talk about rapes where various Hindu scholars like <a href="https://daily.bhaskar.com/news/JM-revealed-asaram-pretended-to-be-lord-krishna-to-sleep-with-innocent-women-4399160-PHO.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Asaram<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, <a href="http://www.india.com/news/india/another-ram-rahim-raids-continue-at-rohini-ashram-of-baba-virendra-dev-who-wanted-16000-wives-same-as-lord-krishna-2784901/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Virendra Dev Dixit<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tv/news/hindi/swami-om-justifies-his-lap-dance-video-with-a-model-in-bikini-compares-himself-with-lord-krishna/articleshow/58592800.cms" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Swami Om<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> claimed to be avatars of Krishna to carry on rape of women.</p>
<p><strong>AGNVIEER WROTE:</strong></p>
<p>5. We provide two links of articles by eminent Muslim scholars who clearly proclaim that this is a fake story that insults Allah and hence should be rejected. They say that no such dream ever came and no such dream inspired by Allah can ever come. Whatever Abraham may have done was through his own hallucinations.</p>

<p>Summary conclusions of these articles are as follows:</p>
<p>&#8211; The story behind Bakr-Id is a fake one</p>
<p>&#8211; Allah can never ask anyone to do any evil act like killing one’s own innocent children</p>
<p>&#8211; Prophets are vulnerable to Satan’s attacks. Thus there is no guarantee that whatever Prophet Abraham or Prophet Muhammad is supposed to have stated, as per records of his followers who were not prophets, is not inspired from Satan.</p>
<p>&#8211; Allah never asked Abraham to even sacrifice a sheep or goat. There is no such mention in Quran.</p>
<p><strong>MY RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>5) Just because those sites are in favour of Agniveer he has converted those Qadiyanis into “<strong>MUSLIM SCHOLARS</strong>’’ now, Keep aside the Authentic Hadiths whoever rejected the fabricated Hadiths were regarded as ‘’Qadiyanis’’(This is the definition of “Qadiyani’s as given by Agniveer team)  by Agniveer team, and the links he provided belongs to the Submitters sect who don’t even believe in Sahih Hadiths, we can see how Agniveer changes his team’s stand to suit his vested interests.</p>
<p>As far as the links are concerned, they can be refuted easily just by quoting correct translation, I don’t agree with all the articles of Submitters sect. Their objection is ‘’ <em>Allah can never ask anyone to do any evil act like killing one’s own innocent children</em>’’, let’s read some Qur’anic verses to understand about it</p>
<p>37:102-113 And [one day,] when [the child] had become old enough to share in his [father&#8217;s] endeavours, the latter said: “O my dear son! I have seen in a dream that I should sacrifice thee: consider, then, what would be thy view!” [Ishmael] answered: “O my father! Do as thou art bidden: thou wilt find me, if God so wills, among those who are patient in adversity!” But as soon as the two had surrendered themselves to [what they thought to be] the will of God, and [Abraham] had laid him down on his face, We called out to him: “O Abraham, thou hast already fulfilled [the purpose of] that dreamvision!” Thus, verily, do We reward the doers of good: for, behold, all this was indeed a trial, clear in itself. And We ransomed him with a tremendous sacrifice, and left him thus to be remembered among later generations: “Peace be upon Abraham!” Thus do We reward the doers of good – for he was truly one of our believing servants And [in time] We gave him the glad tiding of Isaac, [who, too, would be] a prophet, one of the righteous; and We blessed him and Isaac: but among the offspring of these two there were [destined] to be both doers of good and such as would glaringly sin against themselves.</p>
<p>We can see Allah rewarded Hazrat Ibrahim and Hazrat Ismaeel for believing in the dream, if the dream was from Satan then why would Allah reward him for believing in the Satanic dream? ‘’ Thus, verily, do We reward the doers of good’’ Means Allah rewards the person who believes in him. And Allah rewarded Prophet Ibrahim for believing in the dream</p>
<p>According to all the commentaries and many Hadiths this dream was from Allah and not from Satan.</p>
<p>Imam Kathir states: `Ubayd bin Umayr said, “The dreams of the Prophets are revelation,” then he recited this Ayah: (he said: “O my son! I have seen in a dream that I am slaughtering you. So look what you think!”)[…] Or it was said that “submitted themselves” means that they submitted and followed the command of Allah; Ibrahim obeyed the command of Allah and Ismail obeyed Allah and his father […]We called out to him: “O Ibrahim! You have fulfilled the dream!” means, `the purpose of your dream has been fulfilled by your laying down your son to sacrifice him.’ As-Suddi and others said that; he passed the knife over Ismail’s neck, but it did not cut him at all, because a sheet of copper was placed between them. Ibrahim was called at that point, and it was said: (You have fulfilled the dream!) Allah says; Verily, thus do We reward the doers of good. means, `this is how We deal with those who obey Us in things that are difficult for them; We make for them a way out.’ As Allah says: And whosoever has Taqwa of Allah, He will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty). And He will provide him from (sources) he never could imagine. And whosoever puts his trust in Allah, then He will suffice him. Verily, Allah will accomplish his purpose. Indeed Allah has set a measure for all things. (65:2-3) On the basis of this Ayah and this story, some of the scholars of Usul have stated that it is valid for a ruling to be abrogated before anyone is able to act upon it — unlike some of the Mutazilah. The evidence for this is obvious, because Allah commanded Ibrahim, peace be upon him, to sacrifice his son, then He abrogated that and pointed out the ransom. The purpose of His command had been primarily to reward His close Friend for his patience and resolve in sacrificing his son. Allah says: Verily, that indeed was a manifest trial. meaning, it was clearly a test when he was commanded to sacrifice his son, so, he hastened to do it, in submission to the command of Allah and in obedience to Him. Allah said: And of Ibrahim who fulfilled all that. (53:37) and, And We ransomed him with a great sacrifice.</p>
<p>Now it’s very clear that the command to sacrifice his son was a revelation from Allah and the dreams of Prophets are revelation from Allah and not from Satan, concerning whether the animal sacrifice is mentioned in the Qur’an or not, Surah al Baqarah 2:196 talks about sacrificing the cattle. As far as the ‘’Scholars’’ are concerned let me quote one passage from the most renowned Hindu scholar Swami Vivekananda’s view on meat consumption,</p>
<p>“You will be astonished if I tell you that, according to old ceremonials, he is not a good Hindu, who does not eat beef. On certain occasions he must sacrifice a bull and eat it.<sup><a id="post-7903-footnote-ref-1" href="#post-7903-footnote-1" class="broken_link">[1]</a></sup></p>

<p>6. If we look into real Quran, it very clearly advocates vegetarianism and condemns those who kill innocent creatures. That is why a large number of progressive Muslims are turning vegetarian today. Please visit http://islamveg.com/ for one of the largest vegetarian groups of world.</p>
<p>It is not their meat nor their blood, that reaches Allah: it is your piety that reaches Him: He has thus made them subject to you, that ye may glorify Allah for His Guidance to you and proclaim the good news to all who do right. (Quran 22.37)</p>
<p>“There is not an animal in the earth, nor a flying creature flying on two wings, but they are peoples like unto you. We have neglected nothing in the Book (of Our decrees). Then unto their Lord they will be gathered.” (Quran 6:38)</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111108010157/http:/islamveg.com/fatwas.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">http://islamveg.com/fatwas.asp<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>  gives a list of fatwas favoring vegetarianism</p>
<p>This clearly shows that Allah does not ask for animal-killing. Wherever animal-sacrifice is mentioned, it simply means using animals for good purpose and caring for them.</p>
<p>And if that not be the case, it is better to reject false verses in name of Supreme than follow brutality blindly.</p>
<p><strong>MY RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>Ibn Abbas states on the explanation of verse 22:37: (Their flesh and their blood reach not Allah) because in the pre-Islamic time they used to splash the blood of sacrifices on the walls of the Holy House and sully themselves with this blood and so Allah forbade them from doing so; it is also said that this means: Allah does not accept their flesh or blood, (but the devotion from you reacheth Him) but He accepts your pure and sincere works. (Thus have We made them subject unto ye that you may magnify Allah that He hath guided you) as He guided you to His religion and wont. (And give good tidings to the good) to those who are good in their words and deeds; and it is said that the good means: the generous with their sacrifices.</p>
<p>Imam Suyuti states: [22:37] Neither their flesh nor their blood shall reach God, that is, neither of these shall be raised up to Him; rather it is your piety that shall reach Him, that is, it is your righteous action, performed purely for Him, together with [your] faith, that shall be raised up to Him. Thus has He disposed them for you, that you may magnify God for His guiding you, for His pointing out to you the [ritual] ceremonies of His religion and the rites of His pilgrimage. And give good tidings to the virtuous, namely, those who affirm the Oneness [of God].</p>
<p>And Yusuf Ali explains the reason of sacrifice</p>
[C2810]. This is the true end of sacrifice, not propitiation of higher powers, for Allah is One, and He does not delight in flesh or blood (22:37), but a symbol of thanksgiving to Allah by sharing meat with fellow-men.</p>
<p>Islam is unlike the pagan religions which says that the food sacrificed for their Idols/God will go to heaven to their Gods as the Veda says</p>
<p>Rig Veda 3.27.1 IN ladle dropping oil your food goes in oblation up to heaven, Goes to the Gods in search of bliss</p>

<p>Mahabharata Book 3, Section 207 “And in days of yore, O Brahmana, two thousand animals used to be killed every day in the kitchen of king Rantideva…’The sacred fire is fond of animal food,’ this saying has come down to us. And at sacrifices animals are invariably killed by regenerate Brahmanas, and these animals being purged of sin, by incantation of hymns, go to heaven. If, O Brahmana, the sacred fire had not been so fond of animal food in ancient times, it could never have become the food of any one. And in this matter of animal food, this rule has been laid down by Munis:–Whoever partakes of animal food after having first offered it duly and respectfully to the gods and the manes, is not polluted by the act. And such a man is not at all considered to have partaken of animal food…” Tr. K.M. Ganguli</p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.163.12-13 “The strong Steed hath come forward to the slaughter, pondering with a mind directed God-ward. The goat who is his kin is led before him the sages and the singers follow after. The Steed is come unto the noblest mansion, is come unto his Father and his Mother. This day shall he approach the Gods, most welcome: then he declares good gifts to him who offers.” Tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith</p>
<p>By their own logic, shouldn’t the Hinduvadis butcher themselves as a shortcut way to Heaven? So in the context, it means it’s our righteousness, our sincere work reaches him, it’s our pure intention that reaches him, but not the blood or meat as other pagan religions say because Allah does not need them.</p>
<p>Islam does speak about animal rights, Islam says we should not kill them without any reason except for eating their meat, the Qur’an allows us to eat some animals</p>
[5:1] O ye who believe! fulfil (all) obligations. lawful unto you (for food) are all four-footed animals, with the exceptions named: but animals of the chase are forbidden while ye are In the sacred precincts or In pilgrim garb: for Allah doth command according to His will and plan.</p>
[2:173] He only prohibits for you the eating of animals that die of themselves (without human interference), blood, the meat of pigs, and animals dedicated to other than GOD. If one is forced (to eat these), without being malicious or deliberate, he incurs no sin. GOD is Forgiver, Most Merciful.</p>
[16:5] And cattle He has created for you (men): from them ye derive warmth, and numerous benefits, and of their (meat) ye eat.</p>
<p>Many verses allow us to eat four-footed cattle. Look at the hypocrisy of Agniveer, according to him, verses which are in his favour must be accepted and which are not in his favour must be rejected. There are many sites created by non-Muslims Islamophobes by pretending to be Muslims, there are also some sites that indirectly permit pork. All the opinions and Fatwas that site has does not prohibit Muslims from eating meat, they only say a Muslim can be a good vegetarian too, that does not mean he should avoid meat, the argument here is not about eating beef or not, but it’s about stopping Muslims from eating all meats and forcing us to embrace their tradition. The Qur’an says</p>
[5:88] And eat from the good and lawful things that GOD has provided for you. You shall reverence GOD, in whom you are believers.</p>
[2:168] O people, eat from the earth’s products all that is lawful and good, and do not follow the steps of Satan; he is your most ardent enemy.</p>
<p>So we should not avoid eating meat because Allah has made it lawful for us.</p>
<p>Sayyidina Ibn Abbas (RA) reported that a man came to the Prophet (SAW) and said, O Messenger of Allah (SAW), when I consume meat, I long for women and am sexually excited very much. So I have forbidden myself meat.” So, Allah, the Exalted, revealed: “O you who believe! Forbid not the wholesome things which Allah has made lawful for you, and do not transgress. Surely Allah loves not the transgressors. And eat of that which Allah has provided you as lawful and wholesome.” (5: 87-88) [Sunan Al Tirmidhi 3085]
<p>Even if we avoid eating meat throughout the year then we can never avoid slaughtering animals at Id Al Zuha which Allah SWT has ordered to every Muslim to celebrate that festival and so-called Animal lovers wants us to avoid slaughtering animals even at Id.</p>
<p><strong>AGNIVEER WROTE:</strong></p>
<p>7. That is why during the period of Haj, no animal killing is allowed. Even killing of a lice in head is forbidden. No animal sacrifice takes place in Kaba. If indeed it were order of Allah, then Kaba should have been hottest destination for animal sacrifice.</p>
<p><strong>MY RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>Utterly false and baseless claim.</p>
<p><strong>AGNIVEER WROTE:</strong></p>
<p>Q: Ok, I understand that the story is fake and what we Muslims do on Bakr-Id is only a social ritual. But what is the harm in eating meat?</p>
<p>A: Several:</p>
<p>a. It is the most hazardous practice for environment and hygiene.</p>
<p>b. It is most inefficient form of food production and prime cause of hunger in world. Because the resources used to prepare meat of animals that gives 1 calorie of energy can grow more than 10 calories of vegetarian energy. In other words, if people turn vegetarian, more than ten times more people can feed their hunger. Also crops are renewable. One seed can grow many more plants. But animal, once killed, cannot come back and grow thousand other  animals. Taking this into consideration, vegetarian food can feed several hundred times more people than those fed by meat.</p>
<p>Since Muslim countries are among the poorest in the world, the ONLY relevant Zakat or charity for Muslims could be to turn vegetarian and feed their fellow brothers and sisters.</p>

<p>You can see the nutrition value of Spinach was based on 180 Grams even though it’s incomparable to the nutrition value of meat, There is not a single veg food which has complete essential and non-essential amino acids but meat has all the essential and non-essential amino acids which are very important for the physical development of children. If children eat only vegetables then they will have to rely upon supplements for their development (as vegetables don’t have sufficient nutrients), and supplements are much more expensive than meat so how can poor people afford it? Meat is digestable. The non Vegetarians have an advantage, non vegetarians can consume both veg and non-veg food. I would like to quote a few lines of Dr. Naik which he said in his debate</p>
<p>Then I tell, that the Vegetarians, they should thank the Non-Vegetarians, You know why? because if we would not have slaughtered the animals for food, it would have lived for another five to ten years, and in that time it would have the vegetables of 7 to 8 peoples for a few years. So you should thank us for preventing the animals from eating your vegetable food. Further more, he gave the calculation from some record… from where I do not know, 1:14 the land that you graze, required for animal, is 14 times more than the land</p>

<p>c. There are no health benefits associated with meat eating. On contrary, many diseases are nurtured and contracted solely through meat eating habits.</p>
<p>d. There is no evidence that meat-eating makes you stronger. Even the wrestling world champion these days, Sushil Kumar, is a vegetarian.</p>
<p><strong>MY RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>C) See my above response, meat has many health benefits and it’s recommended by Doctors <a href="http://agweb.okstate.edu/fourh/aitc/lessons/intermed/beef.pdf" class="broken_link wpel-icon-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">http://agweb.okstate.edu/fourh/aitc/lessons/intermed/beef.pdf<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> [Beef Is Good For You], I have seen many educated Brahmins eating chicken, mutton and even beef, If you are an Indian, you can ask any Brahman doctor about meat eating, (s)he will definitely recommend you eating meat, If we compare the diseases we get from food then veg food will top the list because there are a lot of harmful artificial, hybrid and adulterated Vegetables available in the Indian market today,</p>
[<a href="http://www.deccanherald.com/content/17663/menace-adulteration.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">http://www.deccanherald.com/content/17663/menace-adulteration.html<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>] From fruits to vegetables, from milk to cold drinks, from ghee to edible oils, from wheat atta to common dal, from spices to sweets, the chances are that you are consuming ‘poison.’ Almost every eatable that you buy from the market is probably adulterated… Most of the vegetables you buy from the market are treated with a heavy dose of pesticides. Some have even been dipped in harmful chemical solutions to make them look fresh and attractive. Many vegetables are given a dose of artificial colour to suit your eyes.</p>

<p>Every Indian is familiar with “Din ko Shakahari Raat ko Sharkhari’’ saga, so posting about vegetarian wrestlers is waste of time, There are over 95% of athletes who are non-veg, will that be a substantial proof to show meat makes you stronger? During the initial career of the Indian wrestler, Dalip Singh Rana (Great Khali) and his wife claimed to be pure vegetarians</p>
<p>“Rana says he is a vegetarian and abhors alcohol and tobacco.” <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7384920.stm" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7384920.stm<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>
<p>But later on, everyone came to know that he is a non Vegetarian who consumes over 50 eggs and 6 kilograms of meat per day, The so-called Vegetarians are trying their level best to show Vegetarianism as best and they are promoting Vegetarianism in India because of their culture. Doctors say that it is difficult for Vegetarians to maintain the athletic body because of the insufficient amount of nutrition found in vegetables.

<p>e. If meat-eating is justified, why should not even dead human beings, insane people, old people and small babies who are not productive in society be also eaten. Meat of Zakir Naik would perhaps be more beneficial than that of any goat, cow, camel or sheep. Zakir Naik says that Muslims are docile and non-violent because they eat non-violent and docile animals. By this logic itself, Muslims will become scholars if they eat meat of scholars like Zakir Naik and his IRF gang.</p>
<p><strong>MY RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>E) We are not Aghoris (Hindu saints of a Shaivite sect) to eat flesh of humans. Muslims cannot eat the meat of Humans, eating the meat of Human is prohibited, Agniveer stated ‘’ <em>why should not even dead human beings, insane people, old people and small babies who are not productive in society be also eaten</em>’’ let’s See what he said on eating Humans in point #2 below  ‘<em>’Now you would argue that this means that even coma patients should be eaten up. This only shows cannibalistic attitude desperate for sensations on tongue</em>’’</p>
<p>Agniveer is misquoting the lectures of Dr. Naik, Dr. Naik said ‘’ The diet does effect human beings, but these are arguments… do not effect–, And all the other arguments given, they do not carry weight actually.’’</p>
<p>Agniveer said ‘’ By <strong>this logic</strong> itself, Muslims will become scholars if they eat the meat of scholars like Zakir Naik and his IRF gang.’’</p>
<p>He denies that eating plants will change your behaviour as plants and eating animals would make you cruel, he also said ‘’ <em>4. Going further, even eating of peaceful humans should be justified because eating peaceful humans will make one loving and non-violent</em>!’’ [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111108010157/http:/agniveer.com/679/halal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Zakir Bhai defends Halal Meat<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>]
<p>I agree with him that the diet does not change the behaviour but it contradicts the view of Dayanand, As Agniveer is busy making his own sect, he always contradicts his Dayanand’s belief, Dayanand said</p>
<p><strong>O. </strong><em>Should their flesh, i.e., (of the animals thus killed) be thrown away?</em></p>
<p>A.~ It would do no harm to the world whether it be thrown away, given to dogs or such other carnivorous animals, cremated or even eaten by some meat-eater. But if [the flesh of animals] eaten by man, it will tend to change his disposition and make him cruel. <strong>[<em>Satyarth Prakash  pg 323</em>]</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now you see to whose logic Agniveer was making fun of, Then why didn’t Arya Samajis ate Dayanand’s flesh? Wouldn’t that have made Arya Samajis so-called intelligent?</p>
<p><strong>AGNIVEER WROTE:</strong></p>
<p>f. Would you volunteer to be eaten yourself to feed others? If no, then why kill innocent animals who also feel the same pain, grief and love life the way you do. In fact, you may still be susceptible t0 stress and tensions, so you enjoy life less. So if animals can be killed, even you, your children, your parents, your friends, your neighbors and all insane and dead people should also be eaten away.</p>
<p>This is not a treatise on vegetarianism, so I request everyone to research this topic themselves. But the basic point is that killing of innocent animals in name of pleasing the Supreme Allah is a most foolish and insulting act towards Allah.</p>
<p><strong>MY RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>If eating meat is so cruel, then why Ishwar created carnivorous animals and even <a href="https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/explore/awesome-8-hub/carnivorous-plants/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">carnivorous plants<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>? If eating meat is cruel then Ishwar is the biggest criminal because he created animals like Lion, Tiger, Leopard etc etc who can only digest Non-Veg food, they cannot survive on eating plants, so why did Ishwar create such beasts? Why  Ishwar created such food chain? Vedas and Dayanand has the answer to this question</p>
<p><strong>O. </strong><em>Were all people to live on non-flesh diet, lions and other carnivorous animals would multiply in such large number that they will kill all such useful animals as cows. Your attempt to prevent their slaughter would come to nothing.</em></p>
<p>A.~ It is the business of the State to punish or even kill all<strong> those</strong> men and animals that are injurious (to the community).</p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.87.16 The fiend (Rakshas, Dasyus) who smears himself with flesh of cattle, with flesh of horses and of human bodies, Who steals the milch-cow’s milk away, O Agni,-tear off the heads of such with fiery fury.</p>
<p>Vedas and Dayanand commands to kill the person and animal who eats non veg food, What example will killing carnivorous animals lead? If Ishwar already knew everything, then why did he create the carnivorous animals and then ordered to kill them? As Agniveer has already said above ‘’ Further, when Allah already knows everything, why does He need to take crazy tests? After all He also knows the answer that the examinee will give. Why such a drama then?’’</p>
<p>That shows Ishwar is not all knowing, otherwise why would he create carnivorous animals and then order to kill them as per the concept of Maharishi Agniveer the founder of Agniveer Samaj.</p>
<p>Even the Vedas whose followers insult other people for being meat eater supports killing animals in Yajna (ritual) and many verses speak about eating meat.</p>
<p>Hindus Arguing about meat eating makes no sense, they should first blame their Ishwar for creating ants, lions, fox etc., which are all carnivorous. If Hindus don’t eat meat because plants feel PAIN, then why did they used cows for ploughing the field, horses for traveling and warfare? Don’t animals feel when they are used in the fields and for rides? Why do the Hindus milk the cows? Don’t cows feel pain while their parts are squeezed? If Hindus want to show so much kindness then why did they use the animals? We can see in the Vedas horses were used in the battle, and cows were used for ploughing</p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.14.6 Let the swift steeds who carry thee, thought-yoked and dropping holy oil, Bring the Gods to the Soma draught.</p>
<p>Rig Veda 1.23.15 And may he. duly bring to me the six bound closely, through these drops, As one who ploughs with steers brings corn.</p>
<p>Rig Veda 4.45.4 Happily work our steers and men, may the plough furrow happily…</p>

<p>Q: But even plants have life. By that logic should we stop eating everything and die with hunger?</p>
<p>A: 1. No one, except the illiterate farmer in California whom Zakir Naik met (refer Zakir Naik on Halal Meat) ever proved that plants feel pain in same manner as animals.</p>

<p>When we tell the Hindus that ‘’Plants feel pain’’ we get a reply ‘’they don’t have nervous system’’, If Plants don’t have nervous system then how can Mimosa Pudica plant closes it’s leaves when someone touches it?

<p>2. Plants are in inert unconscious state and do not feel pain like patients in coma. There is no soul in plant that knows that ‘I’ am the mango tree the way you feel that ‘I’ am Zakir Naik and I am an ‘Indian Mujahideen’. So there is no harm in eating plants. Now you would argue that this means that even coma patients should be eaten up. This only shows cannibalistic attitude desperate for sensations on tongue. But fact is that a plant will never revive into consciousness, but a coma patient can. Further, from health reasons, eating meat is stupidity. Thus there is no reason why anything except plants be eaten by taking life.</p>
<p><strong>MY RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>2) Why take an example of a coma patient? If you inject anesthesia to the animal and then cut the animal into many pieces the animal would feel no pain, Vegetarians main objection is ‘’we should not eat animals because they feel PAIN’’, For instance, if someone kills Agniveer’s parents after proper anaesthesia is administered, will Agniveer say to the judge ‘’your honour don’t punish him because he had injected Anaesthetic syringe to my parents so they didn’t FEEL PAIN’’ will he say that? Definitely not! Rather he will tell the judge in his Vedic style ‘’Oh your honour rend rend thou, rend into pieces the killer and punish the killer by tearing him, by burning him, by crushing him, by cutting him who have killed my parents’’. Their logic was not ‘’we should not eat animal because they feel pain’’ but their logic was actually ‘’we should not eat animals because they have life’’</p>
<p>Manu 4. 54. Let him not place (fire) under (a bed or the like); nor step over it, nor place it (when he sleeps) at the foot-(end of his bed); let him not torment living creatures.</p>
<p>Manu Smriti 8.295. But if he is stopped on his way by cattle or by (another) carriage, and he causes the death of any living being, a fine shall without doubt be imposed.</p>
<p>Atharva Veda 20.141.1 Come as home-guardians, saving us from foemen, guarding our  living creatures and our bodies,</p>
<p>Rig Veda 8.9.11 Come as home-guardians, saving us from foemen, guarding our living creatures and our bodies, Come to the house to give us seed and offspring,</p>
<p>Tirukural 324 What is the good way? It is the path that reflects on how it may avoid killing any creature.</p>
<p>Tirukural 321, 312 What is virtuous conduct? It is never destroying life, for killing leads to every other sin.</p>
<p>Mahabharat 13.115 “… Thou hast said so while discoursing formerly upon the ordinances in respect of Sraddhas. How can meat, however, be procured without slaying a living creature? …Those fierce persons who are engaged in slaughter of living creatures, never find protectors when they are in need. Such persons should always be molested and persecuted even as beasts of prey…</p>
<p>Manu 5.46 He who does not seek to cause the sufferings of bonds and death to living creatures, (but) desires the good of all (beings), obtains endless bliss.</p>
<p>Manu 5.48. Meat can never be obtained without injury to living creatures, and injury to sentient beings is detrimental to (the attainment of) heavenly bliss; let him therefore shun (the use of) meat.</p>
<p><strong>O. </strong><em>Should their flesh, i.e., (of the animals thus killed) be thrown away?</em></p>
<p>A.~ … The use of all such food and drinks as are obtained through injuring or killing others or through theft, dishonesty, breach of faith, fraud or hypocrisy is forbidden, in other words they al come under the heading of forbidden articles of diet <strong>[<em>Satyarth Prakash Ch 10 pg 323]</em></strong></p>
<p>It is childish to say that there is no sin in eating meat, drinking wine and committing adultery, for meat cannot be had without <strong>killing</strong> animals, and it can never be right to hurt or kill animals without an offence. <strong>[<em>Satyarth Prakash pg 342]</em></strong></p>
<p>It’s clear from Maharishi Manu, Dayanand and Mahabharata on why we shouldn’t have meat, Because it includes the killing of living creatures/animals (but not because they feel pain), Today we know plants also have life, so when you cut the plants and vegetables they also DIE, in this way it also includes KILLING OF LIVING CREATURE. Thus The so called <em>Shudh Shakahari</em> (Pure Vegetarian) Hindus should start eating meat now.</p>
<p>My one question to all the Vegetarians ‘’Will you allow your family to be killed after they are injected Anaesthetic just because they didn’t feel pain?’’ if it’s all about PAIN, no one will allow that, everyone will say life is precious and life is life it’s very important, similarly, plants have a life too, when you don’t want others to stop eating meat then you should even stop bathing and inhaling because when you bath you kill bacteria when you inhale you kill the living creatures.</p>
<p><strong>AGNIVEER WROTE:</strong></p>
<p>3. Eating plants is a most environment friendly way of living and solves problem of hunger in world. So only plants should be eaten.</p>
<p>4. Even if you argue that plants may have soul that feels ‘I’ am mango-tree or carrot, even then it is better to eat plants and not animals. Because we know 100% that animals feel pain, have face and enjoy life the way we do. When they are butchered, they wriggle in pain in same manner that a Zakir Naik or Osama Bin Laden or Imam Bukhari or you would do. But for plants you are not 100% sure. In fact there is no evidence that they face the same pain as you do when butchered. So it’s better to eat plants even from a probabilistic standpoint.</p>
<p>After all if you know that eating plants is more healthy, safer, hygienic, environment friendly, poverty reducing and yet not brutal like animal killing, don’t you agree that only a fool will eat animals and make his or her own nature brutal.</p>
<p><strong>MY RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>Refer to my above point, and how is eating plants more healthy when meat is more nutritious than plants. And there are many artificial nuts, milk, curd, vegetables available in the Indian market today. The Hindu scriptures says to consume Panchgavya which includes 5 products of Cow they are urine, dung, milk, Ghee and Curd, and Ghee contains high fat which is very dangerous for health. Butter which is a vegetarian food has 82 grams of Fat and 740 calories based on 100 gm portions where as beef (which is a red meat) has 24 grams of fat and 310 calories and chicken has just 5 grams of Fat. If we compare the risks of food, the vegetarian food is more dangerous, Moreover the Vegetarians suffer from many Vitamin deficiencies like</p>

<p>Q: What about Hindus who kill during festivals like Kali Puja?</p>
<p>A: What do you expect us to say? They are also wrong and acting inhuman. Perhaps slightly less because they use ‘jhatka’ instead of ‘halal’ method but nonetheless a murder is a murder. Vedas nowhere sanction this in name of worship of God. Vedas, on contrary, loudly proclaim that compassion towards all animals is necessary to qualify as a human being. Refer No beef in Vedas. Had Hindus not succumbed to anti-Vedic practices, how could the brutal uncivilized invaders conquer them and still rule them despite a pseudo-independence!</p>

<p>Meat consumption is supported in the Vedas, Meat was eaten during occasions and specially during the <em>Yajna</em> (Sacrifice), read my article <a href="/index.php/2018/01/01/meat-consumption-in-hinduism/" data-wpel-link="internal">Meat consumption in Hinduism</a>.</p>

<p>We know that even Hindus visit shrines of Sufi saints with utmost respect to fulfill their wishes or to pay respect, but there are some people in the community who doesn&#8217;t want communal harmony. The Saffron nationalist are trying to demean the holy saints by calling them traitors. They claim that Sufi saints were sent here by the Muslim rulers with a mission to convert Indian people to Islam so it may become easier for them to rule. It&#8217;s a bogus claim, Sufi saints are known for their correct preaching of Islam which includes living peacefully with every human being irrespective of their religion or status. The Saffron terrorist quotes a letter of unknown Sufi saint addressed to a Muslim ruler and claim that all the saints were traitors. Right wing groups cannot digest facts that Islam was spread peacefully by Sufis so they have to distort history. When right wing outfit say that Sufis were traitors that means they are acknowledging the fact that Islam was spread peacefully, this is why they are trying to distort the history of Sufism in India.</p>

<p>There was a Hindu king named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raja_Ganesha" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Raja Ganesha<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> in Bengal who was persecuting Muslims and vandalizing mosques, so a Muslim saint named Shaikh Nur Qutb al Alam r.a sent letter to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaunpur_Sultanate" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Jaunpur Sultan<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaunpur_Sultanate#Ibrahim_Shah" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Ibrahim Shah Sharqi<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, with an appeal to invade Bengal and overthrow Raja Ganesha. Sultan Ibrahim Shah Sharqi successfully defeated Raja Ganesha and his son embraced Islam and took the name <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalaluddin_Muhammad_Shah" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Jalaluddin Muhammad Shah<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>. This letter of the Sufi saint is misrepresented by Hindutvadis to show that the saint had sent a letter asking the Sultan to persecute Hindus. There are many such incidents where Hindu Rajas oppressed Sufi saints for proselytizing or oppressing Muslims like the case of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bijapur#Sufis_of_Bijapur" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Sufi Sarmast<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> of Bijapur who along with his followers were going to be expelled by Hindu Raja Kumaram (Kumara Rama). So a war ensued between them and Lakhi Khan Afghan and Nimat Khan came from Delhi to help the Sufi saint and defeated the Raja.</p>
<p>In 1758, the Maratha armies occupied Lahore and evicted Timur, son of Ahmed Shah Abdali of Kabul. The Punjab is where the vast Islamic world meets up with the subcontinental Hindu culture. At this juncture, Shah Waliullah of Delhi wrote to Ahmed Shah Abdali, inviting him to enter Punjab and stop the Marathas. Three years later, in 1761, Ahmed Shah crossed the Indus and took Lahore. Third battle of Panipat was fought and Afghans were victorious. Hindutvadis are undermining the work of Sufis by accusing them of working under the control of rulers. Sufi saints had left everything behind and came to India to preach the message of Islam solely for the purpose of pleasing Allah and it is an insult to their devotion to god to say that they were agents of rulers. There are 50 crore or 500 million Muslims in the Indian subcontinent and Sufi saints played a major role in preaching of Islam. Hindutvadis believe in the proverb ‘tell a lie a hundred times and it becomes the truth’. They tried hard putting forth their sword of Islam thesis, to claim the Islam was spread by sword in India and when they thought that this is not going to work so they started tarnishing the image of Sufi saints.</p>
<p>The Gorakhpur-based Gorakhnath Peeth or Matth, was granted by a Muslim ruler, Nawab Asaf-ud-Daula of Awadh. Roshan Ali Shah, the great 18th century Sufi of Gorakhpur requested Asaf-ud-daula, the then Nawab of Avadh, to grant land for the Gorakhpur Matth. After posting this can one make a claim that Gorakhnath Mutth Yogis also worked for Muslim rulers?</p>
<p>Hazrat Nizamuddin Auliya R.A witnessed the reigns of seven Sultans, but he did not attend the darbar of any one of them. He was popularly known as Mahbub-i-Ilahi (Beloved of God)</p>
<p>Mahatma Gandhi, The father of the India said<br />
&#8216;&#8221;My association with the noblest of Mussalmans has taught me to see that Islam has spread not by power of sword but by the prayerful love of an unbroken line of saints and fakirs&#8230;&#8221; &#8211; Young India, 10-7-1942; Mahatma Gandhi and comparative religion By K.L.

<p>&#8221;It is incorrect to state that the Sufis followed the Muslim conquerors in the sub-continent. They were here, though in small numbers, and had started their work even before the arrival and triumph of Muslim armies. &#8221; We now know that a Sufi, Sh. Abdur Rahman, had settled in Ajmer even before Khwaja Moinuddin, and was the author of the first work in Hindi.&#8221;( Indian Muslims, By Prof. M.Mujeeb.). At this time Ajmer was ruled by Rajput Rajas. Similarly, Shaikh Ismail Bukhari came to Pakistan before Mahmud Ghaznavi. Mohammed Alfi who came as early as Mohd. Bin Qasim&#8217;s time began missionary work in Hindu-ruled Kashmir. &#8220;The Ismaili missionary Abdullah landed near Cambay in 1067A.D. and worked in Gujrat when the country was governed by Sidhraj Jai Singh. He and his Jain teacher Huma Charya are said to have been converted to Islam when there was no recorded Muslim invasion.&#8221; (The Shias of India, By John Norman Hollister). Such instances can be multiplied without end.&#8221; – Sufi Movement and Pakistan, Kemal Hasan</p>

<p>&#8221;From the fifteenth year after the death of the Prophet, when an Arab expedition was sent into Sind, up to the eighteenth century, a series of Muhammadan invaders, some founders of great empires, others mere adventurers, poured into India from the north-west. While some came only to plunder and retired laden with spoils, others remained to found kingdoms that have had a lasting influence to the present day. <span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;">But of none of these do we learn that they were accompanied by any missionaries or preachers</span>.&#8221; -The Preaching of Islam: A History of the Propagation of the Muslim Faith, pg 256, by T.W Arnold, Adam Publishers, 2002</p>
<p>&#8221;<span style="color:red;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">It would be important to note here that even before the invaders who came to conquer India in the name of Islam, a large number of Sufis and preachers had come to India to spread the word of Islam<span style="color:darkred;"><br />

<p>&#8221;Islam as having historically played a key role in the emancipation of the Dalit, a role which was gradually watered down over time. Islam spread in India principally through the agency of the Sufis whose teachings of love, brotherhood and social equality attracted many Dalit to the new faith, shackled as they were by the chains of the caste system and the Brahminical religion. Seeing the early Muslims eating from the same dish and praying together in the same mosque, the Dalit entered the Muslim fold in droves. It was not by the sword, but through the love and compassion that the Sufis exhibited in their behaviour towards the poor, principally the Dalit, that large numbers of Hindus converted to Islam.&#8217; Muslims in India Since 1947: Islamic Perspectives on Inter-Faith Relations, page 115, Yoginder Sikand, Routledge, 31-Jul-2004</p>
<p>&#8221;Indian Moslem merchants from Gujarat and Bengal also brought Islam to southeast Asia [pg15]&#8230; <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Islam was spread by the Sufi mystics who came and lived in their interpretation of Islam among the people <span style="color:red;">without any support of any external authority</span></span>&#8221; [Malay Muslims: The History and challenge of resurgent Islam in Southeast Asia By Robert Day McAmis p.17, Wm.

<p>He also writes,</p>
<p>&#8220;This does not contradict the fact that the Indian Muslims merchants helped in the spread of Islam. It is possible that these merchants were Sufis or greatly influenced by the Sufis.&#8221; ibid</p>
<p>&#8216;<span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;">&#8216;The Sufis were not part of an organized missionary program, nor did they work under the direct authority of the Muslim ruler</span>, instead they were inspired by the personal commitment to their faith. The Sufis helped spread Islam through Asia, Central Asia, India, China and Indonesia.<br />

<p>&#8221;the reaction of the Hindus to certain groups of Muslims men of letters remains insignificant compared to the profound popular work of conversion undertaken by Muslim mystics, which led more and more Hindu masses to embrace Islam [p 146]. from the sixth to the thirteenth century, the hermitages of Muslim saints, who were chased from Persia by the invading Mongols, multiplied in north India, and around their venerated tombs, villages were founded by Hindu converts who were attracted to Islam by the austerity and the gentile helpfulness of these hermits&#8230; it is not through war that Islam was spread in India, it is through the mystics and their great orders, Chistiyah, Kobrawaiyah, Shattariya and Naqshbandiya.&#8221;- On Becoming an Indian Muslim: French Essays on Aspects of Syncretism, page 52, by M.

<p>&#8221;<span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;">Conversion to Islam in this country is seen as the act of the Kings while in reality Islam spread in India because of the humane teachings of the Sufi saints</span>. Surely some individuals and landlords did convert to Islam out of fear or expectation of reward but those are few compared to the Shudras2 who embraced Islam in large numbers.&#8221; &#8211; Popular culture in a globalised India, pg 99, By K.

<p>&#8221;The spread of Islam throughout the western Punjab has been attributed to the efforts initiated by the grand Sufi masters of the Chishtiyya and Suhrawaridiya, baba Farid Ganj i Shakar (d. 664/1264) of Pakpattan and Bahauddin Zakariya (d.666/1267) of Multan, Respectiverly&#8221;-<br />

<p>The Awliya (Saints) used to distant themselves from politics, but some Saints had relation with the rulers, but this relation was limited to a Murshid and Murid relation (Student and teacher or disciple). I don&#8217;t want to speak about whether Shivaji was communal or not, but when trying to portray Shivaji as a secular king, Hindu brothers often say in defence that he used to revere a Sufi saint named Yakut Baba. Shivaji visiting Yakut Baba doesn&#8217;t mean he used to visit Yakut Baba for political gains. So it were not just Muslim rulers but even non Muslims rulers who were attracted towards the preaching of Sufi saints.</p>
<p>&#8221;The first Sufi to visit Jammu, according to available sources, was Pir Raushan &#8216;Ali shah. According to the Gulab Nama, a nineteenth century history of Jammu, he was a contemporary of the Prophet Muhammad and arrived in Jammu in the seventh century A.D, although this is not credible. He is said to have so impressed the Hindu ruler of Jammu, Raja Sarpala Dhar, that the king requested him to settle down.&#8221;- [Muslims in India: contemporary social and political discourses By Yoginder Sikand page 186]
<p>&#8221;The Buddhists were the first to embrace Islam in Kashmir. The firm Muslim ruler of Kashmir was Rinchana, a Buddhist prince of Ladakh, who embraced Islam at the behest of a Muslim saint. Rinchanas conversion should not, however be treated as an individual case&#8230;&#8221;[Perspectives on kashmi pg 127 , by Dr. M.I Khan] &#8211; Challenges to religions and Islam: a study of Muslim movements pg 1349, by Hamid Naseem Rafiabadi</p>
<p>However some consider Rinchana&#8217;s conversion to be for political gain. A historian writes,</p>
<p>&#8221;He [Raziuddin] also points out that some Sufis supported a king as long as he (the king) was accountable to God only and ensured peace and order he received Saint&#8217;s blessings but &#8220;if he failed to ensure peace and order in realm, and oppressed the subject, he could lose his &#8216;job&#8217; on account of the prayer of a saintly person, for example, a Sufi Shaykh. The sources mention several anecdotes in which a reigning king was removed from the throne by the Sufi saint, and the kingship was bestowed upon some one who was portrayed as a more deserving person.&#8221;- Sufism, Culture and Politics: Afghans and Islam in Medieval North India By Raziuddin Aquil</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a well-established fact that no Muslim army invaded Malaysia and Indonesia, yet Muslims make majority in those countries. Islam was spread in Malaysia and Indonesia due to the preaching by Sufis. If Sufi saints were sent by Muslim rulers in India then can Islamophobes tell us which Muslim ruler sent the Saints in Malaysia and Indonesia? It is substantial proof that saints were spiritually motivated to preach Islam.</p>
